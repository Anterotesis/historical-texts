            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HITHER TO we have purſued the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, both in their
ſucceſſes and their defeats, with peculiar attention: while they took the
lead in the affairs of Greece, it was neceſſary to place them on the fore
ground of the picture; but now we muſt change the ſcene; and, leaving the
Athenians acting an obſcure part, go to thoſe ſtates who
ſucceſſively took the lead after their downfal.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0813600202:4"/> Sparta ſeems to be the firſt ſtate now that
gave laws to the reſt of the Greeks; their old jealouſies began to revive
againſt the petty ſtates that had formerly ſided againſt them: and the
Eleans were the firſt upon whom they fell, under a pretence that they were
not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by that ſtate to the Olympic games as well as the reſt of the
Grecians. Having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly declared war, and being upon the point of plundering
the city of Elis, they were taken into the alliance of Sparta, and the
conquerors now aſſumed and enjoyed the title of the Protectors and
Arbitrators of Greece. Soon after, Age<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſilaus, who was choſen king of
Sparta, was ſent into Aſia with an army, under pretence of freeing the
Grecian cities: he gained a ſignal victory over Tiſſaphernes, near the
river Pactolus, where he forced the enemy's camp, and found conſiderable
plunder. This ſucceſs induced the Perſian monarch, inſtead of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Ageſilaus openly in the field, to ſubvert his intereſt among the Grecian
ſtates by the power of bribery; and indeed this confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy was now ſo
weakened, its concord and unanimity ſo totally deſtroyed, that they were
open to every offer: the love of money was now rooted in their affections; and
the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans were the only people that, for a while, <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0813600202:5"/>
ſeemed to diſdain it: but the contagion ſtill ſpreading, even they, at
laſt, yielded to its al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lurements; and every man ſought private emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lument,
without attending to the good of his country.</p>
            <p>The Thebans, as they were the firſt gained over to the Perſian
intereſt, ſo they were the moſt active in promoting it. To ſtrengthen
their alliance, they ſent ambaſſadors to the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, with a long
repreſentation of the preſent poſture of affairs, wherein they artfully
inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their zeal and affection to their ſtate; from thence they took
occaſion to inveigh againſt the tyranny of Sparta; and concluded with
telling them, that now was the time to throw off the yoke, and to recover their
former ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and authority. The Athenians, though they had no ſhare of
the Perſian money, needed not many arguments to engage them in a rupture of
this kind, for which they had been long waiting a fit opportunity.</p>
            <p>Ageſilaus, who had carried on the war in Perſia with
ſucceſs, received news of the war being again broke out in Greece, with
orders, at the ſame time, for him to return home. He had ſet his heart upon
the entire conqueſt of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, and was preparing to march farther into the
country; but ſuch was his deference to the laws, <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0813600202:6"/> and
ſuch his ſubmiſſion to the Ephori, that he inſtantly obeyed their
mandate; but left four thouſand men in Aſia to maintain his ſucceſſes
there. The Spartans, however, could not wait his arrival; they found
confederacies thicken on their hands, and they were ready to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked on
all ſides. The Athenians, Argives, Thebans, Corinthians, and Eubaeans joined
againſt them, and made up a body of twenty-four thouſand men; both ſides
encamped near Sicyon, at a ſmall diſtance from each other; and ſoon came
to a regular engagement. The Spartan allies at firſt were entirely routed;
but the Spartans themſelves turned the ſcale of victory by their ſingle
valour, and came off conquerors with the loſs of but eight men. This victory,
however, was in ſome meaſure overbalanced by a loſs at ſea, which the
Spartans ſuſtained near Cnidus. Conon, the Athenian General, being
appointed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Perſian fleet againſt them, took fifty of their
ſhips, and purſued the reſt into port. Ageſilaus, on the other hand,
gained a conſiderable victory over the Athenians and their allies upon the
plains of Coronea. Thus was the war continued by furious but unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive
engagements, in which neither ſide was a gainer; and in this manner did the
Spartans <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0813600202:7"/> maintain themſelves and their allies, without any
conſiderable increaſe or diminution of their power. In this general
ſhock, the Athenians ſeemed for a while to recover their former ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit;
being aſſiſted by Perſian money, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by Conon, an excellent
general, they took the field with ardour, and even rebuilt the walls of their
city. From the mutual jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of theſe petty ſtates among each other,
all were weakened, and the Perſian monarch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came arbitrator of Greece. In
this manner, after a fluctuation of ſucceſſes and intrigues, all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
began to grow tired of a war, and a peace enſued: this peace was concluded in
the ſecond year of the 98th Olympiad; and from the many ſtipulations in
favour of Perſia, Plutarch terms it, The reproach and ruin of Greece.</p>
            <p>The Spartans, thus freed from the terrors of a powerful foreign
enemy, went on to ſpread terror among the petty ſtates of Greece: they gave
peremptory orders to the Mantineans to throw down their walls, and compelled
them to obedience. They obliged the Corinthians to withdraw the garriſon from
Argoſi; and ſome other little ſtates they treated with an air of
ſuperiority that plainly marked, that they expected obedience. They marched
againſt the Olynthians, who had lately grown <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0813600202:8"/> into power,
and effectually ſubdued them. They interpoſed alſo in a domeſtic
quarrel which was carried on at Thebes. Phaebidas having ſeized upon the
citadel, they turned him out, and placed a garriſon of their own in that
fortreſs. They then procured arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to be exhibited againſt Iſmenias
his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt, for having taken money of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, and holding
intelligence with them; and for having been a principal promoter of their
inteſtine broils: upon which he underwent a formal trial before the
commiſſioners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted from Sparta; and one from each of the other great
cities of Greece, and was condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to death. Thus, having ſecured Thebes,
and having by a tedious war humbled the Olyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, they went on to
chaſtiſe the Phliaſians for having abuſed ſome exiles that had been
reſtored by the orders of Sparta. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they continued
diſtributing their orders with pride and ſeverity; no ſtate of Greece was
able to oppoſe their authority; and under the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of executing juſtice,
they were hourly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the way to ſupreme command. In the midſt of this
ſecurity, they were alarmed from a quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter where they leaſt expected. The
Thebans had, for four years ſince the ſeizing of their cita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,
ſubmitted to the Spartan yoke; but they <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0813600202:9"/> now took
occaſion, by a very deſperate at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, to throw it off; for which
purpoſe, there was a ſecret correſpondence carried on between the moſt
conſiderable of the exiles of Athens, and thoſe who were well affected to
them in Thebes; and meaſures were conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between them by Phyllidas,
ſecretary to the Theban governors, by whoſe contrivance a competent number
of the exiles were to get into the city; and Charon, a man of the firſt rank
there, offered his houſe for their reception. The day being fixed, they ſet
out from Athens; and twelve of the moſt active and reſolute among them were
detached to enter the city, the reſt remaining at a proper diſtance to wait
the event. The firſt who offered himſelf was Pelopidas, who was young and
daring, and had been very zealous in encouraging the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign; and, by the
ſhare he had in it, gave a ſufficient earneſt of what might be further
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from him in the ſervice of his country. The next man of
conſequence was Mellon, who, by ſome, is ſaid to have firſt projected
the ſcheme with Phyllidas. Theſe two, with their ten aſſociates,
dreſſed themſelves like peaſants, and beat about the fields with dogs
and hunting-poles, as in ſearch of game. Having thus paſſed
unſuſpected, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0813600202:10"/> themſelves into the city,
they met at Charon's houſe, as the general rendezvous, when they were ſoon
after joined by thirty-ſix more of their confederates. It was concerted, that
Phyllidas ſhould, on that day, give a great en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment to Archias and
Philip, the two governors who were appointed by the Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans; and, to make it
the more complete, he had engaged to provide ſome of the fineſt women in
the town to give them a meeting. Matters being thus prepared, the
aſſociates di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided themſelves into two bands; one of which, led by
Charon and Mellon, were to attack Archias and his company: and having put on
women's cloaths over their armour, with pine and poplar over their heads, to
ſhade their faces, they took their opportunity when the gueſts were well
heated with wine, to enter the room, and immediately ſtabbed Archias and
Philip, with ſuch others of the company as were pointed out to them by
Phyllidas. A little before this execution, Archias received an expreſs from
Athens, with all the particulars of the conſpiracy; and the courier conjured
him, in the name of the perſon who wrote the letters, that he ſhould read
them forthwith, for that they contained matter of great importance. But he laid
them by unopened; and, with a <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0813600202:11"/> ſmile, ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"Buſineſs to-morrow:"</q> which words, upon that
occaſion, grew into a proverb. The other band, headed by Pelopidas and
Damo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clides, went to attack Leontiades, who was at home, and in bed. They
ruſhed into his houſe by ſurprize; but he, ſoon taking the alarm,
leaped up, and, with his ſword in his hand, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them at his
chamber-door, and ſtabbed Cephiſodorus, who was the firſt man that
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to enter. Pelopidas was the next who encountered him; and, after a
long and difficult diſpute, killed him. From thence they went in purſuit of
Hypates, his friend and neighbour, and diſpatched him likewiſe; after which
they joined the other band, and ſent to haſten the exiles they had left in
Attica.</p>
            <p>The whole city was by this time filled with terror and confuſion;
the houſes full of lights, and the inhabitants running to and fro in the
ſtreets, in a wild, diſtracted manner, and waiting impatiently for
day-light, that they might diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh their friends from their foes,
ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determined what courſe to take. Early in the morning, the exiles
came in armed; and Pelopi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das appeared with his party, in a general
aſſembly of the people, encompaſſed by the prieſts, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying
garlands in their hands, proclaiming li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to the Thebans in general, and
exhorting <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0813600202:12"/> them to fight for their gods and their country;
for though they had made ſuch a proſperous beginning, the moſt difficult
part ſtill remained, whilſt the citadel was in the poſſeſſion of
the Spartans, with a garriſon of fifteen hundred men, beſides a great
number of citizens and others, who had fled to them for protection, and
declared themſelves on their ſide.</p>
            <p>Early the next morning, the Athenians ſent five thouſand foot,
and two thouſand horſe, to the aſſiſtance of Pelopidas: ſeveral
other bodies of troops alſo came in from all the cities of Boeotia; ſo that
the citadel being hemmed round, and deſpairing of ſuccours from without,
ſurrendered at diſcretion.</p>
            <p>The Thebans having thus acquired their freedom, the Spartans were
reſolved, at any rate, to take the lead in the affairs of Greece; and having
incenſed theſe beyond meaſure, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſeize upon the Pyraeus,
and thus made the Athenians their irreconcileable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Ageſilaus was
pitched upon to command the army that was to humble the Grecian ſtates. His
name ſtruck a terror into the Thebans; and his forces, which amounted to near
twenty thouſand men, increaſed their fears. The Thebans, therefore,
inſtead of attempting to attack, were contented to ſtand upon their
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0813600202:13"/> and poſſeſſed themſelves of a hill
near the city. Ageſilaus detached a party of light armed men, to provoke them
to come down and give him battle; which they declining, he drew out his whole
forces, in order to attack them. Chabrias, who commanded the merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries on
the part of the Thebans, ordered his men to preſent themſelves, and keep
their ranks in cloſe order, with their ſhields laid down at their feet, and
their ſpears advanced, and with one leg put forward, and the knee upon the
half-bent. Ageſilaus, finding them prepared in this manner to receive him,
and that they ſtood as it were in defiance of him, thought fit to withdraw
his army; and contented himſelf with ravaging the country. This was looked
upon as an extraordinary ſtratagem; and Chabrias va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued himſelf ſo much
upon it, that he procured his ſtatue to be erected in that poſture.</p>
            <p>Thus, through a ſucceſſion of engagements, both by ſea and
land, the Spartans, having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked a powerful confederacy, grew every day
weaker, and their enemies more daring. The Thebans continually grew bolder;
and, inſtead of continuing to defend themſelves with diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, attacked
the enemy with courage and ſucceſs. Though the battles fought between
theſe ſtates, were neither regular nor deciſive, <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0813600202:14"/> yet
they were ſuch as ſerved to raiſe the courage of the Thebans, to gain
them confidence, and to form them for thoſe great undertakings which were
ſhortly to follow. Pelopidas, who headed them at the battle of Tanagra,
ſlew the Spartan commander with his own hand. At the battle of Tegyra, with
very unequal forces, he put a large body of the enemy to rout. He himſelf
commanded a battalion of the Theban army, diſtinguiſhed by the name of the
Sacred Van. They were as remarkable for their fidelity to each other, as for
their ſtrength and courage: they were linked by the bonds of common
friendſhip; and were ſworn to ſtand by each other in the moſt dangerous
extremities. Thus united, they became invincible, and generally turned the
victory in their favour, for a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of years; until they were at
laſt cut down, as one man, by the Macedonian phalanx under Philip.</p>
            <p>A peace of ſhort continuance followed theſe ſucceſſes of
the Thebans; but they ſoon fell into tumults and ſeditions again. The
inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Xacinthus and Corcyra having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled their magiſtrates, put
themſelves under the protection of Athens, and repulſed the Spartans, who
attempted to reſtore their ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates by force.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0813600202:15"/> About the ſame time, the inhabitants of
Platea, applying to their old friends the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, for their protection and
alliance, the Thebans took offence at it, and demoliſhed the town; and ſoon
after, did the ſame by Theſpiae. The Athenians were ſo highly incenſed
at the treatment of thoſe two cities, which had deſerved ſo well of the
common cauſe in the Perſian war, that they would act no longer in
conjunction with them; and, upon their breaking with them, the affairs of
Greece took a new and unexpected turn.</p>
            <p>It now began to appear, that the Thebans were growing into power;
and while Sparta and Athens were weakening each other by mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual conteſts,
this ſtate, which had enjoyed all the emoluments, without any of the expences
of the war, was every day growing more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and independent. The Thebans,
who now began to take the lead in the affairs of Greece, were naturally a hardy
and robuſt people, of ſlow intellects, and ſtrong conſtitutions. It was
a conſtant maxim with them, to ſide either with Athens or Sparta, in their
mutual conteſts; and which ſoever they inclined to, they were generally of
weight enough to turn the balance. However, they had hitherto made no further
uſe of that weight, than to ſecure themſelves; <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0813600202:16"/> but
the ſpirit which now appeared among them; was firſt implanted by Pelopidas,
their deliverer from the Spartan yoke; but ſtill further carried to its
utmoſt height, by Epaminondas, who now began to figure in the affairs of
Greece.</p>
            <p>Epaminondas was one of thoſe few exalted characters, with ſcarce
any vice, and almoſt eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry virtue to diſtinguiſh him from the reſt of
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Though in the beginning poſſeſſed of every quality
neceſſary for the ſervice of the ſtate, he choſe to lead a private
life, employed in the ſtudy of philoſophy, and ſhewing an example of the
moſt rigid obſervance of all its doctrines.</p>
            <p>Truly a philoſopher, and poor out of taſte, he deſpiſed
riches, without affecting any repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from that contempt; and if Juſtin
may be believed, he coveted glory as little as he did money. It was always
againſt his will that commands were conferred upon him; and he behaved
himſelf in them in ſuch a manner, as did more honour to dignities, than
dignities to him.</p>
            <p>Though poor himſelf, and without any eſtate, his very poverty,
by drawing upon him the eſteem and confidence of the rich, gave him the
opportunity of doing good to others. One of his friends being in great
neceſſity, Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas ſent him to a very rich citizen, with 
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0813600202:17"/> orders to aſk him for a thouſand crowns in his name:
that rich man coming to his houſe, to know his motives for directing his
friend to him upon ſuch an errand, 
<q rend="inline">"Why," replied Epaminondas, "it is becauſe this
honeſt man is in want, and you are rich."</q> Fond of lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which he
devoted to the ſtudy of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, his darling paſſion, he ſhunned
public employments, and made no intereſt but to exclude himſelf from them.
His moderation concealed him ſo well, that he lived obſcure, and almoſt
unknown. His merit however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered him. He was taken from his ſolitude
by force, to be placed at the head of armies; and he demonſtrated, that
philoſophy, though generally in contempt with thoſe who aſpire at the
glory of arms, is wonderfully uſeful in forming heroes; for it was a great
advance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards conquering the enemy, to know how to conquer one's ſelf: in
this ſchool anciently were taught the great maxims of true policy, the rules
of every kind of duty, the motives for a due diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of them, what we owe
our country, the right uſe of authority, wherein true courage con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts;
in a word, the qualities that form the good citizen, ſtateſman, and great
captain; and in all theſe Epaminondas excelled.</p>
            <p>He poſſeſſed all the ornaments of the mind. He had the
talent of ſpeaking in perfection; <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0813600202:18"/> and was well verſed
in the moſt ſublime ſciences. But a modeſt reſerve threw a veil over
all thoſe excellent qualities, which ſtill augmented their value, and of
which he knew not what it was to be oſtentatious. Spintharus, in giving his
character, ſaid, That he never had met with a man who knew more, and ſpoke
leſs.</p>
            <p>Such was the general appointed to command the Theban army, and act
in conjunction with Pelopidas; with whom he had the moſt perfect and the
moſt diſintereſted friendſhip. This ſtate being left out in the
general treaty of peace, and thus having the Spartans and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians
confederated againſt it, they appeared under the utmoſt conſternation,
and all Greece looked upon them as loſt and undone. The Spartans ordered
levies to be made in all parts of Greece, that ſided with them; and
Cleom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brotus, their general, marched towards the frontiers of Boeotia, ſecure
of victory: willing, however, to give his hoſtilities an air of juſtice, he
ſent to demand of the Thebans, that they ſhould reſtore the cities that
they had uſurped, to their liberties; that they ſhould rebuild thoſe they
had demoliſhed before, and make reſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution for all their former wrongs.
To this it was replied, 
<q rend="inline">"That the Thebans were accountable to none but
Heaven for their <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0813600202:19"/> conduct."</q> Nothing now remained on
both ſides, but to prepare for action. Epaminondas immediately raiſed all
the troops he could, and began his march: his army did not amount to ſix
thouſand men; and the enemy had above four times that number. As ſeveral
bad omens were urged to prevent his ſetting out, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied only by a
verſe from Homer, of which the ſenſe is, There is but one good omen; to
fight for one's country. However, to reaſſure the ſoldiers, by nature
ſuperſtitious, and whom he obſerved to be diſcouraged, he inſtructed
ſeveral perſons to come from different places, and report auguries and
omens in his favour, which revived the ſpirit and hopes of the troops.</p>
            <p>Epaminondas had wiſely taken care to ſecure a paſs by
Cleombrotus, which might have ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened his march conſiderably. The
latter, after having taken a large compaſs, arrived at Leuctra, a ſmall
town of Boeotia, between Plataea and Theſpiae. Both parties conſulted
whether they ſhould give battle; which Cleombrotus reſolved, by the advice
of all his officers; who repreſented to him, that if he declined fighting
with ſuch a ſuperiority of troops, it would confirm the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent report,
that he ſecretly favoured the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans. The latter had an eſſential
reaſon for <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0813600202:20"/> haſtening a battle before the arrival of
the troops, which the enemy daily expected: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the ſix generals who
formed the council of war, differed in their ſentiments; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, who
was Epaminondas, came in very good time to join the three that were for
fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and his opinion carrying the queſtion, the battle was reſolved
upon.</p>
            <p>The two armies were very unequal in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: that of the
Lacedemonians, as has been ſaid, conſiſted of twenty-ſour thouſand
foot, and ſixteen hundred horſe; the Thebans had only ſix thouſand
foot, and four hundred horſe; but all of them choice troops, animated by
their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in war, and determined to conquer or die. The Lacedemonian
cavalry, compoſed of men picked up by chance, without valour, and ill
diſciplined, was as much inferior to their enemies in courage, as ſuperior
in number. The infantry could not be depended on, except the Lacedemonians; the
allies, as has been ſaid, having engaged in the war with reluctance,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they did not approve the motive of it, and being beſides
diffatisfied with the Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians.</p>
            <p>The ability of the generals of either ſide, ſupplied the place
of numerous armies, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the Theban, who was the moſt
accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0813600202:21"/> ſoldier of his times. He was ſupported
by Pelopidas, at the head of the ſacred battalion, compoſed of three
hundred Thebans, united in a ſtrict friendſhip and affection, and engaged,
under a particular oath, never to fly, but to defend each other to the
laſt.</p>
            <p>Upon the day of battle, the two armies drew up on a plain.
Cleombrotus was upon the right, at the head of a body conſiſting of
Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, on whom he confided moſt, and whoſe files were twelve deep:
to take the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, which his ſuperiority of horſe gave him in an open
country, he poſted them in front of his Lacedemonians. Archidamus, the ſon
of Ageſilaus, was at the head of the allies, who formed the left wing.</p>
            <p>Epaminondas, who reſolved to charge with his left, which he
commanded in perſon, ſtrengthened it with the choice of his heavy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed
troops, whom he drew up fifty deep: the ſacred battalion was upon his left,
and cloſed the wing: the reſt of his infantry were poſted upon his right,
in an oblique line; which, the farther it extended, was the more diſtant from
the enemy. By this uncommon diſpoſition, his deſign was to cover his
flank on the right; to keep off his right wing, as a kind of reſerved body,
that he might not hazard the event of <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0813600202:22"/> the battle upon the
weakeſt part of his army; and to begin the action with his left wing, where
his beſt troops were poſted, to turn the whole weight of the battle upon
Cleombro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus and the Spartans. He was aſſured that, if he could penetrate
the Lacedemonian pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanx, the reſt of the army would ſoon be put to the
rout. As for his horſe, he diſpoſed them, after the enemy's example, in
the front of his left.</p>
            <p>The action began with the cavalry. As the Thebans were better
mounted, and braver troops than the Lacedemonian horſe, the latter were not
long before they were broke, and driven upon the infantry, which they put into
ſome confuſion. Epaminondas, following his horſe cloſe, marched
ſwiftly up to Cleombrotus, and fell upon his phalanx with all the weight of
his heavy battalion. The latter, to make a diverſion, detached a body of
troops, with orders to take Epaminondas in flank, and to ſurround him.
Pelopidas, upon the ſight of that movement, advanced with incredible ſpeed
and boldneſs, at the head of the ſacred battalion, to prevent the enemy's
deſign, and flanked Cleombrotus himſelf; who, by that ſudden and
unexpected attack, was put into diſorder. The battle was very fierce and
obſtinate; and, whilſt <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0813600202:23"/> Cleombrotus could act, the
victory continued in ſuſpenſe, and declared for neither party. But when
he fell dead with his wounds, the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans, to complete the victory, and the
Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians, to avoid the ſhame of abandoning the body of their king,
redoubled their efforts, and a great ſlaughter enſued on both ſides. The
Spartans fought with ſo much fury about the body, that at length they gained
their point, and carried it off. Animated by ſo glorious an advantage, they
prepared to return to the charge, which would perhaps have proved
ſucceſsful, had the allies ſeconded their ardour: but the left wing,
ſeeing the Lacedemonian phalanx broken, and believing all loſt,
eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when they heard that the king was dead, took to flight, and drew
off the reſt of the army. Epaminondas followed them vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and killed
a great number in the purſuit. The Thebans remained maſters of the field of
battle, erected a trophy, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the enemy to bury their dead.</p>
            <p>The Lacedemonians had never received ſuch a blow. The moſt
bloody defeat, till then, had ſcarce ever coſt them more than four or five
hundred of their citizens. Here they loſt four thouſand men, of whom, one
thouſand <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0813600202:24"/> were Lacedemonians, and four hundred Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans,
out of ſeven hundred who were in the battle. The Thebans had only three
hundred men killed, among whom were four of their citizens.</p>
            <p>The city of Sparta was celebrating at that time the Gymnaſtic
games, and was full of ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, whom curioſity had brought thither. When
the couriers arrived from Leuctra with the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible news of their defeat, the
Ephori, though perfectly ſenſible of all the conſequences, and that the
Spartan empire had received a mortal wound, would not permit the
repreſentations of the theatre to be ſuſpended, nor any changes in the
celebration of the feſtival. They ſent to every family the names of their
relations who were killed, and ſtayed in the theatre to ſee that the dances
and games were continued, without interruption, to the end.</p>
            <p>The next day, in the morning, the loſs of each family being known,
the fathers and rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe who had died in the battle, met in the
public place, and ſaluted and embraced each other with great joy and
ſerenity in their looks, whilſt the others kept themſelves cloſe in
their houſes; or, if neceſſity obliged them to go abroad, it was with a
ſadneſs and dejection <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0813600202:25"/> of aſpect, which ſenſibly
expreſſed their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found anguiſh and affliction. That difference was
ſtill more remarkable in the women: grief, ſilence, tears diſtinguiſhed
thoſe who expected the return of their ſons; but ſuch as had loſt their
ſons, were ſeen hurrying to the temple, to thank the gods, and
congratulating each other upon their glory and good fortune.</p>
            <p>One great point under immediate conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, was concerning
thoſe who had fled out of the battle. They were, by the law, in that caſe,
to be degraded from all honour, and rendered infamous; inſomuch, that it was
a diſgrace to intermarry with them: they were to appear publicly in mean and
dirty habits, with patched and party-coloured garments, and to go half
ſhaved; and whoever met them in the ſtreets, might inſult and beat them,
and they were not to make any reſiſtance. This was ſo ſevere a law, and
ſuch numbers had incurred the penalties of it, many of whom were of great
families and intereſt, that they apprehended the execution of it might
occaſion ſome public commotions; beſides, that theſe citizens, ſuch
as they were, could very ill be ſpared at this time, when they wanted to
recruit the army. Under this difficulty, they gave Ageſilaus a 
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0813600202:26"/> power even over the laws, to diſpenſe with them, to
abrogate them, or to enact ſuch new ones as the preſent exigency required.
He would not aboliſh or make any variation in the law itſelf; but made a
public declaration, That it ſhould lie dormant for that ſingle day, but
revive and be in full force again on the morrow; and, by that expedient, he
ſaved the citizens from infamy.</p>
            <p>So great a victory was followed by inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous effects; numbers
of the Grecian ſtates that had hitherto remained neuter, now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in
favour of the conquerors, and increaſed their army to the amount of ſeventy
thouſand men. Epaminondas entered Laconia with an army, the twelfth part of
which were not The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans; and finding a country hitherto untouched by an enemy,
he ran through it with fire and ſword, deſtroying and plundering as far as
the river Eurotas.</p>
            <p>This river was, at that time, very much ſwoln by the melting of
the ſnow; and the Thebans ſound more difficulty in paſſing it than they
expected, as well from the rapidity as the extreme coldneſs of the water. As
Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas was paſſing at the head of his infantry, ſome of the
Spartans ſhewed him to Ageſilaus, <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0813600202:27"/> who, after having
attentively conſidered and followed him with his eyes a long time, could not
help crying out, in admiration of his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, 
<q rend="inline">
                  <hi>Oh! the wonder-working man!</hi>
               </q> The The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ban
general, however, contented himſelf with over-running the country, without
attempting any thing upon Sparta, and, entering Arcadia, reinſtated it in all
its former privileges and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties. The Lacedemonians had ſome time before
ſtripped the harmleſs natives of all their poſſeſſions, and obliged
them to take re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge among ſtrangers. Their country was equal in extent to
Laconia, and as fertile as the beſt in Greece. Its ancient inhabitants, who
were diſperſed in different regions of Greece, Italy and Sicily, on the
firſt notice given them, returned with incredible joy, animated by the love
of their country, natural to all men; and almoſt as much by the hatred of the
Spartans, which the length of time had only increaſed. They built
themſelves a city, which, from the ancient name, was called Meſſene.</p>
            <p>After performing ſuch ſignal exploits, Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas and
Epaminondas, the Theban generals, once more returned home, not to ſhare the
triumph and acclamations of their fellow-citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, but to anſwer the
accuſations that were <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0813600202:28"/> laid againſt them; they were now
both ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned as criminals againſt the ſtate, of having retained their
poſts four months beyond the time limited by law. This offence was capital by
the laws of Thebes; and thoſe who ſtood up for the conſtitution, were
very earneſt in having it obſerved with punctuality. Pelopidas was the
firſt cited before the tribunal: he defended himſelf with leſs force and
greatneſs of mind, than was expected from a man of his character, by nature
warm and fiery. That valour, haughty and intrepid in fight, forſook him
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his judges. His air and diſcourſe, which had ſomething timid and
creeping in it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted a man who was afraid of death, and did not in the
leaſt incline the judges in his favour, who acquitted him, not without
difficulty. Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas, on the contrary, appeared with all the confidence of
conſcious innocence: inſtead of juſtifying himſelf, he enumerated his
actions; he repeated, in haughty terms, in what manner he had ravaged Laconia,
re-eſtabliſhed Meſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, and re-united Arcadia in one body. He
concluded with ſaying, That he ſhould die with pleaſure, if the Thebans
would renounce the ſole glory of thoſe actions to him, and declare that he
had done them by his own authority, and without their participation. All 
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0813600202:29"/> the voices were in his favour; and he returned from his
trial, as he uſed to return from battle, with glory and univerſal
applauſe. Such dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity has true valour, that it in a manner ſeizes the
admiration of mankind by force. This manner of reproaching them had ſo good
an effect, that his enemies declined any further proſecution; and he, with
his colleague were honourably acquitted. His enemies, however, jealous of his
glory, with a deſign to affront him, cauſed him to be elected the city
ſcaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; he accepted the place with thanks, and aſſerted, That
inſtead of deriving honour from the office, he would give it dignity in his
turn.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Spartans, ſtruck with conſternation at
their late defeats, applied to the Athenians for ſuccour; who, after ſome
heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, determined to aſſiſt them with all their forces; and a
ſlight advantage the Spartans had gained over the Arcadians, in which they
did not loſe a man, gave a promiſing dawn of ſucceſs. The Perſian
king was alſo applied to for aſſiſtance in the confederacy againſt
Thebes; but Pelopidas, undertaking an embaſſy to that court, fruſtrated
their purpoſe, and induced that great monarch to ſtand neuter.</p>
            <p>Thebes being thus rid of ſo powerful an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, had leſs fears
of withſtanding the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0813600202:30"/> of Sparta and Athens:
but a new and an unexpected power was now growing up againſt them; a power
which was one day about to ſwallow up the liberties of Greece, and give laws
to all mankind.</p>
            <p>Some years before this, Jaſon the king of Pherae, was choſen
general of the Theſſalians by the conſent of the people; he was at the
head of an army of above eight thouſand horſe, and twenty thouſand heavy
armed foot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reckoning light infantry; and might have undertaken any
thing with ſuch a body of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciplined and intrepid troops, who had an
entire confidence in the valour and conduct of their commander. Death prevented
his deſigns; he was aſſaſſinated by perſons who had conſpired his
deſtruction. His two brothers, Polydorus and Poliphron, were ſubſtituted
in his place. Againſt him Pelopidas was ſent. The latter of whom killed the
other, for the ſake of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alone, and was ſoon after killed himſelf
by Alexander of Pherae, who ſeized the government, under the pretence of
revenging the death of Polydorus his father. The Theban general ſoon
compelled Alexander to make ſubmiſſion to him; and attempted by mild
uſage to change the natural brutality of his diſpoſition. But Alexander,
long addicted to a debauched life, <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0813600202:31"/> and poſſeſſed
of inſatiable avarice, ſecretly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew from all conſtraint, reſolved
to ſeize an opportunity of revenge. It was not till ſome time after that
this offered; for Pelopidas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appointed ambaſſador to Alexander, who
was at that time at the head of a powerful ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, he was ſeized upon, and
made priſoner, contrary to all the laws of nations and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. It was in
vain that the Thebans com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of this infraction; it was in vain that they
ſent a powerful army, but headed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different generals, to revenge the
inſult: their army returned without effect, and Alexander treated his
priſoners with the utmoſt ſeverity. It was left for Epaminondas only to
bring the tyrant to reaſon. Entering Theſſalia at the head of a powerful
army, his name ſpread ſuch terror, that the tyrant offered terms of
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and delivered up Pelopidas from priſon.</p>
            <p>Pelopidas was ſcarce freed from confinement, when he reſolved to
puniſh the tyrant for his perfidy and breach of faith. He led a body of
troops againſt Alexander, to a place called Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocephalus, where a bloody
battle enſued, in which the Thebans were victorious; but Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas was
unfortunately ſlain: his countrymen conſidered their ſucceſſes very
dearly earned <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0813600202:32"/> which they had obtained by his death. The
la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations for him were general; his funeral was magnificent, and his
praiſes boundleſs. Alexander himſelf ſoon after was killed by Theba his
wife, and his three brothers, who, long ſhocked at his cruelties, reſolved
to rid the world of ſuch a monſter. The account has it, that he ſlept
every night, guarded by a dog, in a chamber which was aſcended by a ladder.
Theba allured away the dog, and covered the ſteps of the ladder with wool to
prevent noiſe, and then, with the aſſiſtance of her brothers, ſtabbed
him in ſeveral parts of his body.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the war between the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans and the Spartans
proceeded with unabated vigour. The Theban troops were headed by their
favourite general Epaminondas; thoſe of Sparta by Ageſilaus, the only man
in Greece that was then able to oppoſe him.</p>
            <p>The firſt attempt of Epaminondas in this campaign, marked his
great abilities, and his ſkill in the art of war. Being informed that
Ageſilaus had begun his march with his army, and had left but few citizens to
defend Sparta at home, he marched directly thither by night, with a deſign to
take the city by ſurprize, as it had neither walls nor troops to defend it;
but luckily Ageſilaus was appriſed of his deſign, <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0813600202:33"/>
and diſpatched one of his horſe to adviſe the city of its danger; ſoon
after arriving with a powerful ſuccour in perſon, he had ſcarce en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the town, when the Thebans were ſeen paſſing the Eurotas, and coming on
againſt the city. Epaminondas, who perceived that his deſign was
diſcovered, thought it incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on him not to retire without ſome
attempt. He therefore made his troops advance, and making uſe of valour
inſtead of ſtratagem, he attacked the city at ſeveral quarters,
penetrated as far as the public place, and ſeized that part of Sparta which
lay upon the hither ſide of the river. Ageſilaus made head every where, and
defended himſelf with much more valour than could be expected from his years.
He ſaw well that it was not now a time, as before, to ſpare himſelf, and
to act only upon the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; but that he had need of all his courage and
daring, and to fight with all the vigour of deſpair. His ſon Archidamus, at
the head of the Spartan youth, behaved with incredible valour whenever the
danger was greateſt; and, with his ſmall troop, ſtopped the enemy, and
made head againſt them on all ſides.</p>
            <p>A young Spartan, named Iſadas, diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf
particularly in this action. He was very handſome in the face, perfectly well
ſhaped, <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0813600202:34"/> of an advantageous ſtature, and in the flower
of his youth; he had neither armour nor cloaths upon his body, which ſhone
with oil; he held a ſpear in one hand, and a ſword in the other. In this
condition he quitted his houſe with the utmoſt eagerneſs; and, breaking
through the preſs of the Spartans that fought, he threw himſelf upon the
enemy, gave mortal wounds at every blow, and laid all at his feet who
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed him, without receiving any hurt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Whether the enemy were
diſmayed at ſo aſtoniſhing a ſight, or, ſays Plutarch, the gods
took pleaſure in preſerving him upon account of his extraordinary valour;
it is ſaid, the Ephori decreed him a crown after the battle, in honour of his
exploits; but afterwards fined him a thouſand drachmas, for having expoſed
himſelf to ſo great a danger without arms.</p>
            <p>Epaminondas, thus failing in his deſign, was reſolved, before he
laid down his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, which was near expiring, to give the Lacedemonians and
Athenians battle, as they followed him cloſe in the rear.</p>
            <p>The Greeks had never fought among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with more numerous
armies. The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians conſiſted of more than twenty thouſand foot,
and two thouſand horſe; the <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0813600202:35"/> Thebans of thirty
thouſand foot, and three thouſand horſe. Upon the right wing of the
former, the Mantineans, Arcadians, and La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedemonians were poſted in one
line; the Eleans and Achaeans, who were the weakeſt of their troops, had the
centre; and the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians alone compoſed the left wing. In the other army,
the Thebans and Arcadians were on the left, the Argives on the right, and the
other allies in the centre: the cavalry on each ſide were diſpoſed in the
wings.</p>
            <p>The Theban general marched in the ſame order of battle in which he
intended to fight, that he might not be obliged, when he came up with the
enemy, to loſe, in the diſpoſition of his army, a time which cannot be
recovered when loſt in great enterprizes.</p>
            <p>He did not march directly, and with his front to the enemy, but in a
column upon the hills, with his left wing foremoſt; as if he did not intend
to fight that day. When he was over-againſt them, at a quarter of a league's
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he made the troops halt, and lay down their arms, as if he
deſigned to encamp there. The enemy, in effect, were deceived by his ſtand;
and reckoning no longer upon a battle, they quitted their arms, diſperſed
themſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the camp, and ſuffered that ardour to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0813600202:36"/> which a near approach of a battle is wont to kindle in the
hearts of the ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>Epaminondas, however, by ſuddenly wheel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his troops to the
right, having changed his column into a line, and having drawn out the choice
troops, whom he had expreſsly poſted in front upon his march, he made them
double their files upon the front of his left wing, to add to its ſtrength,
and to put it into a condition to attack in a point the Lacedemonian phalanx,
which, by the movement he had made, faced it directly. He ordered the centre
and right wing of his army to move very ſlow, and to halt before they came up
with the enemy, that he might not hazard the event of the battle upon troops of
which he had no great opinion.</p>
            <p>He expected to decide the victory by that body of choſen troops
which he commanded in perſon, and which he had formed into a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn to
attack the enemy in a wedge-like point. He aſſured himſelf, that if he
could penetrate the Lacedemonian phalanx, in which the enemy's principal force
conſiſted, he ſhould not find it difficult to rout the reſt of the
army, by charging upon the right and left with his victorious troops.</p>
            <p>But that he might prevent the Athenians in the left wing from coming
to the ſupport of <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0813600202:37"/> their right againſt his intended
attack, he made a detachment of his horſe and foot advance out of the line,
and poſted them upon a riſing ground, in readineſs to flank the
Athenians, as well to cover his right as to alarm them and give them reaſon
to apprehend being taken in flank and rear themſelves, if they advanced to
ſuſtain their right.</p>
            <p>After having diſpoſed his whole army in this manner, he moved on
to charge the enemy with the whole weight of his column. They were ſtrangely
ſurprized when they ſaw Epa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minondas advance towards them in this order;
and reſumed their arms, bridled their horſes, and made all the haſte they
could to their ranks.</p>
            <p>Whilſt Epaminondas marched againſt the enemy, the cavalry that
covered his flank on the left, the beſt at that time in Greece, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
compoſed of Thebans and Theſſalians, had orders to attack the enemy's
horſe. The Theban general, whom nothing eſcaped, had artfully beſtowed
bow-men, ſlingers, and dart-men in the intervals of his horſe, in order to
begin the diſorders of the enemy's cavalry, by a previous diſcharge of a
ſhower of arrows, ſtones, and javelins upon them. The other army had
neglected to take the ſame precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0813600202:38"/> and had made
another fault, not leſs conſiderable, in giving as much depth to the
ſquadrons as if they had been a phalanx. By this means their horſe were
incapable of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting long the charge of the Thebans. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having made
ſeveral ineffectual attacks with great loſs, they were obliged to retire
behind their infantry.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Epaminondas, with his body of foot, had charged
the Lacedemonian phalanx. The troops fought on both ſides with incredible
ardour, both the Thebans and Lacedemonians being reſolved to periſh ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than yield the glory of arms to their ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals. They began with fighting with
the ſpear; and thoſe firſt arms being ſoon broken in the fury of the
combat, they charged each other ſword in hand. The reſiſtance was equally
obſtinate; and the ſlaughter very great on both ſides. The troops
deſpiſing danger, and deſiring only to diſtinguiſh themſelves by
the greatneſs of their actions, choſe rather to die in their ranks, than to
loſe a ſtep of their ground.</p>
            <p>The furious ſlaughter on both ſides, having continued a great
while, without the victory inclining to either, Epaminondas, to force it to
declare for him, thought it his duty to make an extraordinary effort in
perſon, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0813600202:39"/> to the danger of his own life.
He form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therefore a troop of the braveſt and moſt determinate about him;
and, putting himſelf at the head of them, made a vigorous charge upon the
enemy, where the battle was moſt warm, and wounded the general of the
Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demonians with the firſt javelin he threw. This troop, by his example,
having wounded or killed all that ſtood in their way, broke and penetrated
the phalanx. The Lacedemonians, diſmayed by the preſence of Epaminondas,
and overpowered by the weight of that intrepid party, were reduced to give
ground. The groſs of the Theban troops, animated by their general's example
and ſucceſs, drove back the enemy upon his right and left, and made great
ſlaughter of them. But ſome troops of the Spartans, perceiving that
Epaminondas aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned himſelf too much to his ardour, ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly rallied,
and, returning to the fight, charged him with a ſhower of javelins. Whilſt
he kept off part of thoſe darts, ſhunned ſome of them, fenced off others,
and was fighting with the moſt heroic valour, to aſſure the victory to
his army, a Spartan, named Callicrates, gave him a mortal wound with a javelin
in the breaſt acroſs his cuiraſs. The wood of the ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velin being broke
off, and the iron head con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0813600202:40"/> in the wound, the
torment was inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, and he fell immediately. The battle began around
him with new fury; the one ſide uſing their utmoſt endeavours to take him
alive, and the other to ſave him. The The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans gained their point at laſt,
and carried him off, after having put the enemy to flight.</p>
            <p>After ſeveral different movements, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative loſſes and
advantages, the troops on both ſides ſtood ſtill, and reſted upon their
arms; and the trumpets of the two armies, as if by conſent, ſounded the
retreat at the ſame time. Each party pretended to the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and erected a
trophy; the Thebans, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they had defeated the right wing, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
maſters of the field of battle; the Athenians, becauſe they had cut the
detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in pieces. And, from this point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, both ſides refuſed
at firſt to aſk leave to bury their dead; which, with the ancients, was
confeſſing their defeat. The Lacedemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, however, ſent firſt to
demand that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; after which, the reſt had no thoughts but of
paying the laſt duties to the ſlain.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Epaminondas had been carried into the camp. The
ſurgeons, after having examined the wound, declared, that he would expire as
ſoon as the head of the dart <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0813600202:41"/> was drawn out of it.
Thoſe words gave all that were preſent the utmoſt ſorrow and
afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who were inconſolable on ſeeing ſo great a man upon the
point of expiring. For him, the only concern he expreſſed was about his
arms, and the ſucceſs of the battle. When they ſhewed him his ſhield,
and aſſured him that the Thebans had gained the victory, turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards
his friends with a calm and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene air, 
<q rend="inline">"All then is well,"</q> ſaid he; and ſoon after,
upon drawing the head of the ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velin out of his body, he expired in the arms
of Victory.</p>
            <p>As the glory of Thebes roſe with Epami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nondas, ſo it fell with
him; and he is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, the only inſtance of one man's being able to
inſpire his country with military glory, and lead it on to conqueſt,
without having had a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor, or leaving an imitator of his
example.</p>
            <p>The battle of Mantinea was the greateſt that ever was fought by
Grecians againſt Grecians; the whole ſtrength of the country being drawn
out, and ranged according to their different in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts; and it was fought
with an obſtinacy equal to the importance of it, which was the fixing the
empire of Greece. And this muſt of courſe have been transferred to the
The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans upon their victory, if they had not loſt <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0813600202:42"/> the
fruits of it by the death of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who was the ſoul of all their
counſels and deſigns. This blaſted all their hopes, and put out their
ſudden blaze of power, almoſt as ſoon as it was kindled. However, they
did not preſently give up their pretenſions; they were ſtill ranked among
the leading ſtates, and made ſeveral further ſtruggles; but they were
faint and ineffectual; and ſuch as were rather for life and being, than for
ſuperiority and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion. A peace, therefore, was propoſed; which was
ratified by all the ſtates of Greece, except Sparta; the conditions of which
were, that every ſtate ſhould maintain what they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed, and
hold it independent of any other power.</p>
            <p>A ſtate of repoſe enſued this peace; in which the Grecian
powers ſeemed to ſlacken from their former animoſities; and if we except
an expedition under Ageſilaus into Egypt, whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he went to aſſiſt
Tachos, who had uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that kingdom, and in which he died, there was little
done for ſeveral years following. The Athenians, more particularly, when they
found themſelves delivered from him who kept up their emulation, grew
indolent a nd re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs, and abandoned themſelves to their eaſe and
pleaſure, being wholly taken up with <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0813600202:43"/> ſhews, ſports
and feſtivals. They were na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally too much addicted to theſe
amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; and they had formerly been encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in them by Pericles, who
knew how to lead them by their inclinations, and took this method to ingratiate
himſelf, and to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert them from inſpecting too narrowly into his
adminiſtration. But they now carried their diverſions to a much higher
pitch of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance. They had ſuch a paſſion for the ſtage, that it
ſtifled in them all other thoughts either of buſineſs or of glory. In
ſhort, the decorations, and other charges attending the theatre, were ſo
exceſſive, that Plutarch ſays, It coſt more to repreſent ſome of
the famous pieces of Sophocles and Euripides, than it had done to carry on the
war againſt the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. And, in order to ſupport this charge, they
ſeized upon the fund which had been ſet apart for the war, with a
prohibition, upon pain of death, ever to adviſe the applying of it to any
other purpoſe. They not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed this decree, but went as far the
other way, making it death to propoſe the reſtoring the fund to the uſes
to which it had before been appropriated, under the ſame penalties. By
diverting the courſe of the ſupplies in ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary a manner, and
entertaining the <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0813600202:44"/> idle citizen at the expence of the
ſoldier and marinet, they ſeemed to have no remains of that ſpirit and
vigour which they had exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Perſian wars, when they demoliſhed
their houſes to furniſh out a navy; and when the women ſtoned a man to
death, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to appeaſe the Great King (as he was called) by paying
tribute, and doing homage.</p>
            <p>In this general remiſſneſs, it was not to be ſuppoſed,
that their allies would treat them with the reſpect they demanded. Moſt of
the ſtates, that had hitherto been in alliance with them,

under their protection, took up arms againſt them. In reducing theſe,
Chabrias, Iphicrates, and Timotheus gained great reputation; and are
ſuppoſed to have been conſummate generals; but their ſucceſſes are
too minute to rank them among the claſs of eminent commanders; and whatever
their ſkill might have been, there wanted a great occaſion for its
diſplay. This war opened with the ſiege of Chio, in which the Athenians
were repulſed; and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brias, unwilling to abandon his veſſel, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
death to flight. The ſiege of Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium followed; before which, the fleet of
the contending powers was diſperſed by a ſtorm; in conſequence of
which, the Athenian ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals <pb n="43" facs="tcp:0813600202:45"/> were recalled. Timotheus was
fined a great ſum; but, being too poor to pay, he went into voluntary
baniſhment. Iphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates was alſo obliged to anſwer for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but
got off by his eloquence; and, in the mean time, the affairs of Athens
ſucceeded but ill under the guidance of Charis, who was left ſole
commander. A peace was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, whereby every city and people were left to
the full enjoyment of their liberty: and thus the war of the allies ended,
after having continued three years.</p>
            <p>During theſe tranſactions, a power was grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up in Greece,
hitherto unobſerved, but now too conſpicuous and formidable to be
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked in the general picture; this was that of the Macedonians; a people
hitherto obſcure, and in a manner barbarous; and who, though warlike and
hardy, had never yet preſumed to intermeddle in the affairs of Greece: but
now ſeveral circumſtances concurred to raiſe them from obſcurity, and
to involve them in meaſures, which, by degrees, wrought a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough change in
the ſtate of Greece; it will be neceſſary, therefore, to begin with a
ſhort account of their power and origin, before we enter into a detail of
that conſpicuous part, which they afterwards performed on the theatre of the
world.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. From the Birth to the Death of PHILIP King of
MACEDON.</head>
            <p>THE people of Macedon were hitherto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as making no part
of the Grecian con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy; they were looked upon as borderers, as men, in a
meaſure, ſemi-barbarous; who boaſted indeed of taking their origin from
the Greeks; but who hitherto neither poſſeſſed their politeneſs, nor
enjoyed their freedom: they had little or no intercourſe with their
mother-country; they had contracted the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and manners of the natives
where they were ſettled, and from thence they were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſimilar
diſreſpect.</p>
            <p>The firſt king who is mentioned with any degree of certainty to
have reigned in Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, was Caranus, by birth an Argive, and ſaid to be
the ſixteenth in deſcent from Hercules. It was upon this foundation, that
Philip afterwards grounded his pretenſions to be of the race of Hercules, and
aſſumed to himſelf divine ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours. Caranus, therefore, is commonly
repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0813600202:47"/> to have led forth a body of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by
the advice of the oracle, into theſe parts where he ſettled, and made
himſelf king. Caranus having, according to the general ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, reigned
twenty-eight years; the ſucceſſion was continued after him to the times
we are now treating of. But there is very little worth notice recorded of
theſe kings; they being chiefly employed in defending themſelves againſt
the incurſions of their neighbours. And as to their domeſtic affairs, they
were remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able only for the frequent murders and uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations which
happened in the royal family.</p>
            <p>Amintas, father of Philip, began to reign the third year of the
ninety-ſixth Olympiad. Having the very year after been warmly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked by
the Illyrians, and diſpoſſeſſed of a great part of his kingdom, which
he thought it ſcarce poſſible for him ever to recover again, he
addreſſed himſelf to the Olynthians; and, in order to engage them the
more firmly in his intereſt, he had given up to them a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able track
of land in the neighbourhood of their city. He was reſtored to the throne by
the Theſſalians; upon which he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of reſuming the
poſſeſſion of the lands, which nothing but the ill ſituation of his
affairs had obliged him to reſign to the Olynthians. <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0813600202:48"/>
This occaſioned a war; but Amintas not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrong enough to make head
ſingly againſt ſo powerful a people, the Greeks and the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, in
particular, ſent him ſuccours, and enabled him to weaken the power of the
Olyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, who threatened him with a total and impending ruin.</p>
            <p>Amintas died, after having reigned twenty-four years; he left three
legitimate children, namely, Alexander, Perdicas, and Philip. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, the
eldeſt ſon, reigned but one year. Perdicas, the ſecond brother, was
oppoſed by Pauſanias, who began, by ſeizing ſome for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes; but,
by the aſſiſtance of Iphicrates, the Athenian general, the uſurper was
expelled, and Perdicas the lawful ſovereign confirmed on the throne. He did
not, however, long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue in tranquillity. Ptolemy, a natural ſon of
Amintas, laid claim to the crown, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted his title; which, by mutual
conſent, was referred to Pelopidas the Theban, a man more revered for his
probity than his valour. Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidas determined in favour of Perdicas; and,
having judged it neceſſary to take pledges on both ſides, in order to
oblige the two compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titors to obſerve the articles of the treaty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
by them, among other hoſtages, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Philip with him to Thebes, where
he <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0813600202:49"/> reſided ſeveral years. He was then ten years of
age. Eurydice, at her leaving this much-loved ſon, earneſtly beſought
Pelopidas to procure him an education worthy of his birth, and of the city to
which he was going, an hoſtage. Pelopidas placed him with Epaminondas, who
had a celebrated Pythagorean philoſopher in his houſe for the education of
his ſon. Philip improved greatly by the inſtructions of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor, and
much more by thoſe of Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das, under whom he undoubtedly made ſome
campaigns, though no mention is made of this. He could not poſſibly have
had a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent maſter, whether for war, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of life; for
this illuſtrious Theban was, at the ſame time, a great philoſopher; that
is to ſay, a wiſe and virtuous man, and a great commander, as well as a
great ſtateſman. Philip was very proud of being his pupil, and propoſed
him as a model to himſelf; moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, could he have copied him perfectly!
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he borrowed from Epaminondas his acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in war, and his promptitude
in improving occaſions; which, however, formed but a very inconſiderable
part of the merit of that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious perſonage. But, with regard to his
temperance, his juſtice, his diſintereſtedneſs, his ſincerity, his
magnanimity, his clemency, <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0813600202:50"/> which rendered him truly great,
theſe were virtues which Philip had not received from nature, and did not
acquire by imitation.</p>
            <p>The Thebans did not know that they were then forming and educating
the moſt danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemy of Greece. After Philip had ſpent nine or ten
years in their city, the news of a revolution in Macedon made him reſolve to
leave Thebes clandeſtinely. Accordingly he ſtole away, made the utmoſt
expedition, and found the Macedonians greatly ſurprized at ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving loſt
their king Perdicas, who had been killed in a great battle by the Illyrians;
but much more ſo, to find they had as many ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as neighbours. The
Illyrians were on the point of returning into the kingdom with a much greater
force; the Peonians infeſted it with perpetual incurſions; the Thracians
were determined to place Pauſanias on the throne, who had not abandoned his
preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and the Athenians were bringing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaeus, whom Mantias, their
general, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to ſupport with a ſtrong fleet, and a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
body of troops. Macedonia at that time wanted a prince of years to govern; and
had only a child, Amintas, the ſon of Perdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas, and lawful heir of the
crown. Philip governed the kingdom for ſome time, by the <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0813600202:51"/>
title of Guardian to the Prince; but the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, juſtly alarmed,
depoſed the nephew in favour of the uncle; and inſtead of the heir, whom
nature had given them, ſet him upon the throne whom the preſent conjuncture
of affairs required, perſuaded that the laws of neceſſity are ſuperior
to all others. According<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Philip, at twenty-four years of age, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended
the throne, the firſt year of the 105th Olympiad.</p>
            <p>Never did the preſent condition of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonians require a man
of more prudence and activity. They were ſurrounded with as many enemies as
they had neighbours. The Illyrians, ſluſhed with their late victory, were
preparing to march againſt them with a great army. The Paeonians were making
daily incurſions upon them; and, at the ſame time, the title to the crown
was conteſted by Pauſanias and Argaeus; the former whereof was ſupported
by the Thra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and the latter by the Athenians; who, for that purpoſe,
had ſent out a good fleet, and three thouſand land-men.</p>
            <p>Under theſe circumſtances, with ſo many enemies on his hands
at once, and that before he was ſettled on the throne, his firſt care was
to make ſure of his own people, to gain their affections, and to raiſe
their ſpirits; for they <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0813600202:52"/> were very much diſheartened,
having loſt above four thouſand men in the late action with the Illyrians.
He ſucceeded in theſe points, by the artfulneſs of his addreſs, and the
force of his elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, of which he was a great maſter. His next ſtep was
to train and exerciſe them, and reform their diſcipline; and it was at this
time that he inſtituted the famous Macedonian phalanx, which did ſo much
execution. It was an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement upon the ancient manner of fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among
the Grecians, who generally drew up their foot ſo cloſe, as to ſtand the
ſhock of the enemy without being broken. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete phalanx was thought to
contain above ſixteen thouſand men; though it was alſo taken in general
for any company or party of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, and frequently for the whole body of
foot. But this of Philip's invention is deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed by Polybius to be a long
ſquare, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of eight thouſand pike-men, ſixteen deep, and
five hundred in front; the men ſtanding ſo cloſe together, that the pikes
of the fifth rank were extended three foot beyond the line of the front. The
reſt, whoſe diſtance from the front made their pikes uſeleſs,
reſted them upon the ſhoulders of thoſe who ſtood before them, and ſo
locking them together in file, preſſed forward to ſupport and puſh on
the former <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0813600202:53"/> ranks, whereby the aſſault was rendered
more violent and irreſiſtible.</p>
            <p>When Philip had made ſome proper regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of his affairs at
home, he began to look abroad, in order to divert the ſtorms which threatened
him from all quarters. By money and promiſes, he made up matters for the
preſent with ſuch of his enemies as lay neareſt to him; and then turned
his forces againſt the Athenians, who were marched up to Methone, to
aſſiſt Argaeus. He gave them battle, and defeated them; and the death of
Argaeus, who was killed in the action, put an end to that diſpute: for he
permitted the Athenians, when they were in his power, to return home. This
inſtance of his moderation, gained ſo far upon them, that they ſoon after
concluded a peace with him; which yet he obſerved no longer than it ſerved
his deſign of ſecuring the other part of his dominions.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, he marched northward, where he declared war againſt
the Paeonians, and ſubdued them; then fell upon the Illyrians, and having
killed above ſeven thouſand of them in a pitched battle, obliged them to
reſtore all their conqueſts in Macedonia. He had alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the
paſſage of the Thaſians; but yet did not think it ſufficiently
ſecured, without making <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0813600202:54"/> himſelf maſter of
Amphipolis, which was very commodiouſly ſituated on the river Strymon, and
was the key of that ſide of his dominions. He knew the importance of it,
therefore he poſſeſſed himſelf of it in the beginning of his reign.
This was the ground of his quarrel with the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians; who claimed it as one
of their colonies, and made ſuch a point of it, that their ſetting up
Argaeus againſt him, was not ſo much for his own ſake, as for the credit
of impoſing a king upon the Macedonians; as it was with a view to get the
city reſtored to them by his means, in caſe he ſhould have ſucceeded in
his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Philip was ſenſible of their drift, and finding it
neceſſary at that time to keep ſome meaſures with them, would neither
keep the place himſelf, nor let them have it; but took a middle courſe, and
declared it a free city; thereby leaving the inhabitants to throw off their
dependence on their old maſters, and making it appear to be their own act.
But the city continued no longer in this ſtate, than until he ſound
himſelf at liberty to make a more tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough conqueſt of it; which at this
time he eaſily effected, through the remiſſneſs of the Athenians, who
refuſed to ſend any relief to it; alledging, in their excuſe, that it
would be a breach of the peace, which they had concluded <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0813600202:55"/>
with Philip the year before. But the truth is, he tricked them out of it by a
promiſe of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering it up to them. But inſtead of keeping his word with
them, he made further encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by ſeizing on Pydna and Potidea; the
latter of which being garriſoned by Athenians, he drew them out, and ſent
them home; but diſmiſſed them with ſuch marks of civility, as ſhewed
that he avoided coming to an open rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture with that ſtate, at leaſt until
his deſigns were more ripe for it; though at the ſame time he did what he
could to weaken them, and drive them out of his neighbourhood. Pydna, with the
territory belonging to it, he gave up to the Olynthians, who were his father's
inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate enemies. His hands were too full at this time to revive the quarrel
againſt ſo rich and powerful a city; which, for three years together, had
withſtood the united forces of Sparta and Macedonia; he therefore choſe to
buy their friendſhip for the preſent, and to amuſe them by the delivery
of this town, as he had done the Athenians by the peace, until he could attack
them at more advantage. In this ſtep alſo he over-reached the Athenians;
who were at the ſame time courting the alliance of the Olynthians, in order
to maintain their footing in thoſe parts. Which ſide ſoever the 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0813600202:56"/> Olynthians inclined to, they were ſtrong enough to turn
the balance; and therefore, the gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them became a matter of great
contention between Philip and the Athenians.</p>
            <p>From thence he proceeded to ſeize the city of Crenides, which had
been built two years before, and then called it Philippi, from his own name. It
was here that he diſcovered a gold mine, which every year produced an hundred
and forty-four thouſand pounds ſterling. This, which was an immenſe ſum
for that age, was much more ſerviceable than fleets or armies, in fighting
his battles; and he ſeldom failed uſing it in every negociation. It is
ſaid, that conſulting the oracle at Delphos, concerning the ſucceſs of
an intended expedition, he was anſwered by the prieſteſs, That with
ſilver ſpears he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer all things. He took the advice of the
oracle, and his ſucceſs was anſwerable to its wiſdom: indeed, he was
leſs proud of the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of a battle, than of a negociation; well
knowing, that his ſoldiers and generals ſhared in the one, but that the
honour of the latter was wholly his own.</p>
            <p>But a larger field was now opening to his ambition. The mutual
diviſions of the ſtates of Greece were at no time wholly cemented, and they
broke out now upon a very particular <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0813600202:57"/> occaſion. The
firſt cauſe of the rupture, (which was afterwards called the Sacred War)
aroſe from the Phocians having ploughed up a piece of ground belonging to the
temple of Apollo at Delphos. Againſt this all the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſtates
exclaimed as a ſacrilege: they were cited before the council of Amphyctions,
who particularly took cognizance of ſacred matters; they were caſt, and an
heavy fine was impoſed upon them. This the Phocians were unable to pay; they
refuſed to ſubmit to the decree: they alledged, that the care and
pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of the temple anciently belonged to them; and, to vindicate this,
they quoted a precedent from Homer.</p>
            <p>Philomelas, one of their chief citizens, was principally
inſtrumental in encouraging them to arms: he raiſed their ardour, and was
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed their general. He firſt applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Spartans, who
had likewiſe been fined by the Amphyctions, at the inſtance of the Thebans,
after the battle of Leuctra, for having ſeized the Cadmea: for this reaſon
they were very well diſpoſed to join with him, but did not yet think it
proper to declare them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: however, they encouraged his deſign, and
ſupplied him under-hand with money; by which means he raiſed troops, and,
without <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0813600202:58"/> much difficulty, got poſſeſſion of the
temple. The chief reſiſtance he met with in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, was from
the Locrians; but having worſted them, he eraſed the decree of the
Amphyctions, which was inſcribed on the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the temple. However, to
ſtrengthen his authority, and give a colour to his proceedings, he thought it
convenient to conſult the oracle, and to procure an anſwer in his favour.
But when he applied to the prieſteſs for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſhe refuſed
to officiate, until being inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midated by his threats, ſhe told him, the god
left him at liberty to act as he pleaſed; which he looked upon as a good
anſwer, and as ſuch took care to divulge it.</p>
            <p>The Amphyctions meeting a ſecond time, a reſolution was formed
to declare war againſt the Phocians. Moſt of the Grecian nations engaged in
this quarrel, and ſided with the one or the other party. The Boeotians, the
Locrians, Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians, and ſeveral other neighbouring people, declared
in favour of the god; whilſt Sparta, Athens, and ſome other cities of
Peloponeſus, joined with the Phocians. Philomelas had not yet touched the
treaſures of the temple; but being afterwards not ſo ſcrupulous, he
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the riches of the god could not be better employed, than in the
deity's defence; <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0813600202:59"/> for he gave this ſpecious name to this
ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legious attempt: and being enabled, by this freſh ſupply, to double
the pay of his ſoldiers, he raiſed a very conſiderable body of
troops.</p>
            <p>Several battles were fought; and the ſucceſs for ſome time
ſeemed doubtful on both ſides. Every one knows how much religious wars are
to be dreaded, and the prodigious lengths which a falſe zeal, when veiled
with ſo venerable a name, is apt to go. The Thebans having in a rencounter
taken ſeveral priſoners, condemned them all to die, as ſacrilegious
wretches who were excommunicated: the Phocians did the ſame, by way of
repriſal. Theſe had at firſt gained ſeveral advantages; but having been
defeated in a great battle, Philomelas their leader being cloſely attacked on
an eminence from which there was no retreating, defended himſelf for a long
time with invincible bravery; which however not availing, he threw himſelf
headlong from a rock, in order to avoid the torments he muſt undoubtedly have
undergone, had he fallen alive into the hands of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. Oenomarchus was
his ſucceſſor, and took upon him the command of the forces.</p>
            <p>Philip thought it moſt conſiſtent with his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to
remain neuter in this general move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Greeks, in favour either of the 
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0813600202:60"/> Phocians or the Thebans. It was conſiſtent with the
policy of this ambitious prince, who had little regard for religion, or the
intereſts of Apollo, but was always intent upon his own, not to engage in a
war by which he could not reap the leaſt benefit; and to take advantage of a
juncture in which all Greece, employed and divided by a great war, gave him an
oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to extend his frontiers, and puſh his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, without any
apprehenſion of oppoſition. He was alſo well pleaſed to ſee both
parties weaken and conſume each other; as he ſhould thereby be enabled to
fall upon them afterwards to greater advantage.</p>
            <p>Being deſirous of ſubjecting Thrace, and of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing the
conqueſts he had already made there, he determined to poſſeſs himſelf
of Methone, a ſmall city, incapable of ſupporting itſelf by its own
ſtrength, but which gave him diſquiet, and obſtructed his deſigns,
whenever it was in the hands of his enemies. Accordingly he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged that
city, made himſelf maſter of, and razed it. He loſt one of his eyes
before Methone, by a very ſingular accident. Aſter of Amphipolis had
offered his ſervices to Philip, as ſo excellent a markſman, that he could
bring down birds in their moſt rapid ſlight. The monarch made this
anſwer, 
<q rend="inline">"Well, I will take <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0813600202:61"/> you into my
ſervice, when I make war upon ſtarlings;"</q> which anſwer ſtung the
archer to the quick. A repartee proves often of fatal conſequence to him who
makes it; ſo that, Aſter having thrown himſelf into the city, he let fly
an arrow, on which was written, 
<q rend="inline">"To Philip's right eye."</q> This carried a moſt
cruel proof that he was a good markſman; for he hit him in the right eye; and
Philip ſent him back the ſame arrow, with this inſcription: 
<q rend="inline">"If Philip takes the city, he will hang up
Aſter;"</q> and accordingly he was as good as his word. A ſkilful ſurgeon
drew the arrow out of Philip's eye with ſo much art and dexterity, that not
the leaſt ſcar remained; and though he could not ſave his eye, he yet
took away the blemiſh.</p>
            <p>After taking the city, Philip, ever ſtudious either to weaken his
enemies by new conqueſts, or gain more friends by doing them ſome
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant ſervice, marched into Theſſaly, which had implored his
aſſiſtance againſt its tyrants. The liberty of that country ſeemed
now ſecure, ſince Alexander of Pherae was no more. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, his
brothers, who, in concert with his wife Thebe, had murdered him, grown weary of
having ſome time acted the part of deliverers, revived his tyranny, and
oppreſſed the Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0813600202:62"/> with a new yoke.
Lycophron, the eldeſt of the three brothers who ſucceeded Alexander, had
ſtrengthened himſelf by the protection of the Phocians Oenomarchus, their
leader, brought him a numerous body of forces, and at firſt gained a
conſiderable advantage over Philip; but engaging him a ſecond time, he was
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely defeated, and his army routed. The flying troops were purſued to
the ſea-ſhore; upwards of ſix thouſand men were killed on the ſpot,
among whom was Oenomarchus, whoſe body was hung upon a gallows; and three
thouſand, who were taken priſoners, were thrown into the ſea by Philip's
order, as ſo many ſacrilegious wretches, the profeſſed enemies of
religion.</p>
            <p>Philip, after having freed the Theſſalians, reſolved to carry
his arms into Phocis. This was his firſt attempt to get footing in Greece,
and to have a ſhare in the general affairs of the Greeks, from which the
kings of Macedon had always been excluded as foreigners. In this view, upon
pretence of going over into Phocis, in order to puniſh the ſacrilegious
Phocians, he marched towards Thermopylae, to poſſeſs himſelf of a
paſs which gave him a free paſſage into Greece, and eſpecially into
Attica.</p>
            <p>An admiſſion of foreigners into Greece, was a meaſure that was
always formidable to thoſe <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0813600202:63"/> who called themſelves
Grecians. The Athenians, upon hearing of a march which might prove of the
utmoſt conſequence, haſted to Thermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pylae, and poſſeſſed
themſelves of this important paſs, which Philip did not care attempting to
force. The Athenians were rouſed from their lethargy of pleaſure, to make
uſe of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution, by the perſuaſions of Demoſthenes, the
celebrated orator, who, from the beginning, ſaw the ambition of Philip, and
the power of which he was poſſeſſed to carry him through his
deſigns.</p>
            <p>This illuſtrious orator and ſtateſman, whom we ſhall
hereafter find acting ſo conſiderable a part in the courſe of this
hiſtory, was born in the laſt year of the ninety-ninth Olympiad, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to Dionyſius, who, in his epiſtle to Lammacus, hath accurately
diſtinguiſhed the different periods of his life, and the times in which his
ſeveral orations were delivered. He was the ſon not of a mean and obſcure
me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic, as the Roman ſatyriſt hath repreſented him, but of an eminent
Athenian citizen, who raiſed a conſiderable fortune by the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of
arms. At the age of ſeven years, he loſt his father; and to add to this
misfortune, the guardians to whom he was intruſted, waſted and embezzled a
conſiderable part of his inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance. <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0813600202:64"/> Thus
oppreſſed by fraud, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by a weak and effeminate habit of
body, he yet diſcovered an early ambition to diſtinguiſh himſelf as a
popular ſpeaker. The applauſe beſtowed on a public orator, who had
defended his country's right to the city of Oropus, in an elaborate harangue,
inflamed his youthful mind with an eager deſire of meriting the like honour.
Iſocrates and Iſaeus were then the two moſt eminent profeſſors of
eloquence at Athens. The ſoft and florid manner of the former did by no means
ſuit the genius of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes: Iſaeus was more vigorous and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getic,
and his ſtyle better ſuited to public bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs. To him therefore he
applied, and under his direction purſued thoſe ſtudies, which might
accompliſh him for the character to which he aſpired. His firſt eſſay
was made againſt his guardian, by whom he had been ſo injuriouſly
treated: but the goodneſs of his cauſe was here of more ſervice than the
abilities of the young orator; for his early attempts were unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing, and
ſoon convinced him of the neceſſity of a graceful and manly
pronunciation. His cloſe and ſevere application, and the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary
diligence with which he laboured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer his defects and natural
infirmities, are too well known, and have been too frequently the 
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0813600202:65"/> ſubjects of hiſtorians and critics, ancient and
modern, to need a minute recital. His cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as a ſtateſman will be
beſt collected from the hiſtory of his conduct in the preſent
tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſactions. As an orator, the reader perhaps is not to be informed of his
qualifications. Indeed, the ſtudy of oratory was at that time the readieſt
and almoſt the only means of riſing in the ſtate. His firſt eſſay
at the bar was two years after this incident, when he called his guardians to
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for embezzling his patrimony, and reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered ſome part of it. This
encouraged him ſome time after, to harangue before the people in their public
aſſembly; but he acquitted himſelf ſo ill, that they hiſſed him:
however, he ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured a ſecond time, but with no better ſucceſs than
before, ſo that he went away aſhamed, confounded, and quite in deſpair.
It was upon this occaſion that Satyrus the player accoſted him, and in a
friendly way encouraged him to proceed. With this view he aſked him to
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat to him ſome verſes of Sophocles, or Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripedes, which he
accordingly did: the other repeated them after him, but with ſuch a
dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpirit and cadence, as made him ſenſible that he knew very
little of elocution. But by his inſtructions, and his own perſeverance, he 
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0813600202:66"/> at length made himſelf maſter of it; and by the
methods before mentioned, corrected the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections which were born with
him, as well as the ill habits which he had contracted. It is not very clear
whether this paſſage be rightly aſcribed to Satyrus, who ſeems to be
confounded with Neoptolemus and Andronicus, who were likewiſe famous
comedians; and Demoſthenes is ſaid to have been inſtructed by all the
three.</p>
            <p>With theſe advantages and improvements, he appeared again in
public, and ſucceeded ſo well, that people flocked from all parts of Greece
to hear him. From thence he was looked upon as the ſtandard of true
eloquence; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that none of his countrymen have been put in
compariſon with him; nor even among the Romans, any but Cicero. And though it
has been made a queſtion by the ancient writers, to which of the two they
ſhould give the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerence, they have not ventured to decide it, but have
contented themſelves with deſcribing their different beauties, and
ſhewing, that they were both perfect in their kind. His eloquence was grave
and auſtere, like his temper; maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culine and ſublime, bold, forcible and
impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous; abounding with metaphors, apoſtrophes and interrogations; which,
with his ſolemn <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0813600202:67"/> way of invoking and appealing to the
gods, the planets, the elements, and the manes of thoſe who fell at Salamis
and Marathon, had ſuch a wonderful effect upon his hearers, that they thought
him inſpired. If he had not ſo much ſoftneſs and inſinuation as is
often requiſite in an orator, it was not that he wanted art and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy,
when the caſe required it: he knew how to ſound the inclinations of the
people, and to lead them to the point he aimed at; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, by
ſeeming to propoſe that which was directly the contrary. But his chief
character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtic was vehemence, both in action and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and indeed
that was the qualification of all others moſt wanted at this time: for the
people were grown ſo inſolent and imperious, ſo factious and divided,
ſo jealous of the power of the democracy, and withal ſo ſunk into a
ſtate of pleaſure and indolence, that no arts of perſuaſion would have
been ſo effectual, as that ſpirit and reſolution, that force and energy
of Demoſthenes, to humble them, to unite them, and to rouſe them into a
ſenſe of their common danger.</p>
            <p>But neither could Demoſthenes himſelf have made ſuch
impreſſions on them, if his talent of ſpeaking had not been ſupported
by their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his integrity. It was that which added <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0813600202:68"/> weight and emphaſis to every thing he ſaid, and animated the
whole. It was that which chiefly engaged their attention, and determined their
counſels; when they were convinced that he ſpoke from his heart, and had no
intereſt to manage, but that of the community: and this he gave the
ſtrongeſt proofs of, in his zeal againſt Philip, who ſaid, He was of
more weight againſt him than all the fleets and armies of the Athenians; and
that he had no enemy but Demoſthenes. He was not wanting in his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
to corrupt him, as he had moſt of the leading men in Greece: but this great
orator withſtood all his offers; and, as it was obſerved, all the gold in
Macedon could not bribe him.</p>
            <p>When Philip found himſelf ſhut out of Greece by the Athenians,
he turned his arms againſt thoſe remote places which depended on them,
either as colonies, or as conqueſts; and particularly againſt the
Olynthians, whom he had long looked upon with an evil eye; but had courted and
cajoled them, whilſt he was otherwiſe employed. But he came now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved
entirely to reduce them; and advancing towards the city, only ſent them a
ſhort meſſage, to let them know, that one of theſe two points was
become neceſſary; either that they muſt quit Olynthus, or he Macedonia.
Whereupon <pb n="67" facs="tcp:0813600202:69"/> they ſent immediately to Athens for relief.
The ſubject was debated there with great ſolemnity, and Demoſthenes was
very earneſt in ſending them ſuccours: he was oppoſed by Demades and
Hyperides. The opinion, however, of Demoſthenes prevailed; the people of
Athens reſolved to unite againſt Philip, but the great difficulty lay in
furniſhing the ſupplies: their principal fund, which had formerly ſerved
the purpoſes of war, had long been converted to the uſe of the ſtage. The
money ariſing from this fund was computed at a thouſand talents a-year; and
a certain proportion of it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to the citizens, to defray the charge
of their admittance into the theatre. This diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bution having been
continued to them from the time of Pericles, they claimed it now as their
right, eſpecially ſince they had lately obtained a law, which made it
capital to propoſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring the fund to the uſes for which it was
originally granted. Hence it was that, upon any preſſing emergency,
extraordinary taxes were to be raiſed; and they were laid ſo unequally, and
collected with ſo much difficulty, that they ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom anſwered the
ſervice for which they were intended.</p>
            <p>Demoſthenes treated this ſubject with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt art and
circumſpection. After ſhewing that <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0813600202:70"/> the Athenians were
indiſpenſibly obliged to raiſe an army, in order to ſtop the
enterprizes of their aſpiring enemy, he aſſerted, that the theatrical
fund was the only probable means of ſupply. Theſe remonſtrances had
ſome weight, but were not attended with deſerved ſucceſs. The Athenians
ſent a reinforcement to Olyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thus; but Philip, who had corrupted the
prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal men in the town, entered, plundered it, and ſold the inhabitants
among the reſt of the ſpoil. Here he found much treaſure, which ſerved
to aſſiſt him in his further encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the Thebans, being unable alone to terminate the
war, which they had ſo long carried on againſt the Phocians, addreſſed
Philip. Hitherto, as we before mentioned, he had obſerved a kind of
neutrality with reſpect to the Sacred War; and he ſeemed to wait for an
opportunity of declaring himſelf; that is, till both parties ſhould have
weakened themſelves by a long war, which equally exhauſted both. The
Thebans had now very much abated of that haughtineſs, and thoſe ambitious
views, with which the victories of Epaminondas had inſpired them. The
inſtant, therefore, they requeſted the alliance of Philip, he reſolved to
eſpouſe the intereſt of that republic, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0813600202:71"/> to the Phocians. He had not loſt ſight of the project
he had formed of obtaining an entrance into Greece, in order to make himſelf
maſter of it. To give ſucceſs to his deſign, it was proper for him to
declare in favour of one of the two parties, which at that time divided all
Greece; that is, either for the Thebans, or the Athenians and Spartans. He was
not ſo void of ſenſe as to imagine, that the latter party would
aſſiſt his deſign of carrying his arms into Greece. He therefore had no
more to do but to join the Thebans, who offered themſelves voluntarily to
him, and who ſtood in need of Philip's power, to ſupport themſelves in
their declining condition: he therefore declared at once in their favour. But
to give a ſpecious colour to his arms, beſides the gratitude he affected to
have at heart for Thebes, in which he had been educated, he alſo pretended to
make an honour of the zeal with which he was fired with regard to the violated
god, and was very glad to paſs for a religious prince, who warmly
eſpouſed the cauſe of the god and of the temple of Delphos, in order to
conciliate, by that means, the eſteem and friendſhip of the Greeks.</p>
            <p>There was nothing Philip had more at heart than to poſſeſs
himſelf of Thermopylae, as it <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0813600202:72"/> opened him a paſſage
into Greece; to appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate all the honour of the Sacred War to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as
if he had been principal in that affair; and to preſide in the Pythian games.
He was therefore deſirous of aiding the Thebans, and by their means to
poſſeſs himſelf of Phocis. But then, in order to put this double
deſign in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, it was neceſſary for him to keep it ſecret from
the Athenians, who had actually declared war againſt Thebes; and who, for
many years, had been in alliance with the Phocians. His buſineſs,
therefore, was to make them change their meaſures, by placing other objects
in their view; and, on this occaſion, the politics of Philip ſucceeded to a
wonder.</p>
            <p>The Athenians, who began to grow tired of a war, which was very
burthenſome, and of little benefit to them, had commiſſioned
Cteſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon, and Phrynon, to ſound the intentions of Philip, and in what
manner he ſtood diſpoſed in regard to peace. Theſe related, that Philip
did not appear averſe to it; and that he even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed a great
affection for the commonwealth. Upon this, the Athenians reſolved to ſend a
ſolemn embaſſy, to enquire more ſtrictly into the truth of things, and
to procure the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations, previouſly neceſſary to ſo
important a negociation. Aeſchines and Demoſthenes were <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0813600202:73"/> among the ten ambaſſadors, who brought back three from Philip;
<hi>viz.</hi> Antipater, Parmenio, and Eurylochus. All the ten executed their
commiſſion very faithfully, and gave a very good account of it. Upon this,
they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent back, with full powers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a peace, and
to ratify it by oaths. It was then Demoſthenes, who, in his firſt
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy, had met ſome Athenian captives in Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonia, and had
promiſed to return and ranſom them at his own expence, endeavoured to
enable himſelf to keep his word; and, in the mean time, adviſed his
colleagues to embark with the utmoſt expedition, as the republic had
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and to wait, as ſoon as poſſible, upon Philip, in what place
ſoever he might be. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, theſe, inſtead of making a ſpeedy
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, as they were deſired, went like ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors, proceeded to
Macedonia by land, ſtaid three months in that country, and gave Philip time
to poſſeſs himſelf of ſeveral other ſtrong places belonging to the
Athenians in Thrace. At laſt, meeting with the king of Macedonia, they agreed
with him upon articles of peace; but he, having lulled them aſleep with the
ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a treaty, deferred the ratification of it from day to
day. In the mean time he found means to corrupt the ambaſſadors, one after
another, <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0813600202:74"/> by preſents, Demoſthenes excepted; who being
but one, oppoſed his colleagues to no manner of purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Philip being ſuffered quietly to purſue his march into Phocis,
gained the ſtreights of Thermopylae, but did not immediately diſcover what
uſe he intended to make of his entrance into Greece; but went on, according
to his agreement with the Thebans, to put an end to the Phocian war, which he
eaſily effected. His name and appearance ſtruck ſuch a terror among the
Phocians, that though they had lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a reinforcement of a thouſand
heavy armed Spartans, under the command of their king Archidamus, they declined
giving him battle, and ſent to treat with him, or rather to ſubmit
themſelves to any terms that he would give them. He allowed Phalicus to
retire, with eight thouſand men, being mercenaries, into Peloponeſus; but
the reſt, who were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Phocis, were left at his mercy. As the
diſpoſing of them was a matter wherein Greece in general was concerned, he
did not think fit to act in it by his own private autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, but referred it
to the Amphyctions, whom he cauſed to be aſſembled for that purpoſe.
But they were ſo much under his influence, that they ſerved only to give a
ſanction to his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0813600202:75"/> They decreed, that all
the cities of Phocis ſhould be demoliſhed; that they who had fled, as being
principally concerned in the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege, ſhould be ſtigmatized as
accurſed, and proſcribed as outlaws; that they who remained as inhabitants,
ſhould be diſperſed in villages, and obliged to pay out of their lands a
yearly tribute of ſixty talents, until the whole of what had been taken out
of the temple ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored: they were likewiſe adjudged to loſe
their ſeat in the council of the Amphyctions, wherein they had a double
voice. This Philip got transferred to himſelf, which was a very material
point, and may be looked upon as the principal ſtep towards his gaining that
authority which he afterwards exerciſed in the affairs of Greece. At the
ſame time he gained, in conjunction with the Thebans and Theſſalians, the
ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendency of the Pythian games, which the Corinthians had forfeited,
for their having taken part with the Phocians.</p>
            <p>Philip having, by theſe plauſible methods, ſucceeded in this
expedition, did not think it adviſeable, by attempting any thing further at
preſent, to ſully the glory he had acquired by it, or to incenſe the body
of the Grecians againſt him; wherefore he returned, in a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant manner,
to his own dominions. After <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0813600202:76"/> ſettling his conqueſts at
home, he marched into Theſſaly; and having extirpated the remains of
tyranny in the ſeveral cities there, he not only confirmed the
Theſſalians in his intereſt, but gained over many of their
neighbours.</p>
            <p>It was upon this occaſion that Philip is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked for an act of
private juſtice, which far outweighs his public celebrity. A certain
ſoldier, in the Macedonian army, had, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, diſtinguiſhed
himſelf by extraordinary acts of valour, and had received many marks of
Philip's favour and approbation. On ſome occaſion he embarked on board a
veſſel, which was wrecked by a violent ſtorm, and he himſelf caſt on
the ſhore helpleſs and naked, and ſcarcely with the appearance of life. A
Macedonian, whoſe lands were contiguous to the ſea, came opportunely to be
witneſs of his diſtreſs; and, with all humane and charitable
tenderneſs, flew to the relief of the unhappy ſtranger. He bore him to his
houſe, laid him in his own bed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, cheriſhed, comforted, and for
forty days ſupplied him freely with all the neceſſaries and conveniencies
which his languiſhing condition could require. The ſoldier, thus happily
reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cued from death, was inceſſant in the warmeſt expreſſions of
gratitude to his benefactor, aſſured him, of his intereſt with the king,
and of his <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0813600202:77"/> power and reſolution of obtaining for him,
from the royal bounty, the noble returns which ſuch extraordinary benevolence
had merited. He was now completely recovered, and his kind hoſt ſupplied
him with money to purſue his journey. In ſome time after, he preſented
himſelf before the king; he recounted his mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, magnified his
ſervices; and this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human wretch, who had looked with an eye of envy on the
poſſeſſions of the man who had preſerved his life, was now ſo
abandoned to all ſenſe of gratitude, as to requeſt the king would
beſtow upon him the houſe and lands where he had been ſo tenderly and
kindly entertained. Unhappily Philip, without examination, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderately
and precipitately granted his infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous requeſt; and this ſoldier now
returned to his preſerver, repaid his goodneſs by driving him from his
ſettlement, and taking immediate poſſeſſion of all the fruits of his
honeſt induſtry. The poor man, ſtung with this inſtance of
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paralleled ingratitude and inſenſibility, boldly determined, inſtead
of ſubmitting to his wrongs, to ſeek relief; and, in a letter addreſſed
to Philip, repreſented his own, and the ſoldier's conduct, in a lively and
affecting manner. The king was inſtantly fired with indignation; he ordered
that juſtice ſhould be done without <pb n="76" facs="tcp:0813600202:78"/> delay; that the
poſſeſſions ſhould be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately reſtored to the man whoſe
charitable offices had been thus horridly repaid; and having ſeized his
ſoldier, cauſed theſe words to be branded on his forehead—The
Ungrateful Gueſt;—a character infamous in every age, and among all
nations; but particularly among the Greeks, who, from the earlieſt times,
were moſt ſcrupulouſly obſervant of the laws of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality.</p>
            <p>Having ſtrengthened himſelf in theſe parts, he went the next
year into Thrace, where he had formed a deſign againſt the Cherſoneſe.
This peninſula had, with ſome little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, been for many years in
the hands of the Athenians; but Cotys, as being king of the country, had lately
wreſted it from them, and left it in ſucceſſion to his ſon
Cherſobleptes. He not being able to defend himſelf againſt Philip, gave
it back to the Athenians, reſerving to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf only Cardia, the capital
city. But Philip having ſoon after ſpoiled him of the reſt of his
dominions, the Cardians, for fear of falling again under the power of the
Athenians, threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into his protection. Diopithes, who was the
chief of the Athenian colony lately ſent to the Cherſoneſe, conſidered
this proceeding of Philip, in ſupporting the Cardians, as an act of 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0813600202:79"/> hoſtility againſt Athens; whereupon he invaded the
maritime parts of Thrace, and carried away a great deal of booty. Philip being
at this time in the upper part of the country, was not in a condition to do
himſelf juſtice: but he wrote to complain of it at Athens, as an
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction of the peace; and his creatures there were not wanting on their
part to aggravate the charge againſt Diopithes, as having acted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
orders, and taking it upon himſelf to renew the war: they likewiſe
accuſed him of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting acts of piracy, and of laying their allies under
contribution. But whatever grounds there were for this part of the
accuſation, the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Athens was principally to blame in it; for
having no proper fund for the wars, they ſent out their generals without
money or proviſions, and left them to ſhift for themſelves, and yet made
them anſwerable for any miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages that ſhould happen, for want of
their being better ſupplied. This was a great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the
ſervice, and put thoſe who were employed in it upon pillaging and
plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, in ſuch a manner, as they would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have been aſhamed
of. Demoſthenes, in an harangue that he made upon the ſtage of the
Cherſoneſe, undertook the defence of Diopithes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="78" facs="tcp:0813600202:80"/> Philip, however, was no way intimidated at the
wordy reſiſtance of his eloquent antagoniſt; he went on with artful
induſtry, quelling thoſe by his power who were unable to reſiſt, and
thoſe by his preſents, whom he was unable to oppoſe. The diviſions that
then ſubſiſted in Peloponeſus, gave him a pretext for inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddling in
the affairs of the Greek confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracy. Theſe diviſions were chiefly owing
to the Spartans; who, having little to do in the late foreign tranſactions,
were recovering their ſtrength at home; and, according to their uſual
practice, as they increaſed in power, made uſe of it to inſult and
oppreſs their neighbours. The Argives and Meſſenians being at this time
perſecuted by them, put themſelves under the protection of Philip; and the
Thebans joining with them, they all together formed a powerful confederacy. The
natural balance againſt it, was an union between Athens and Sparta, which the
Spartans preſſed with great earneſtneſs, as the only means for their
common ſecurity; and Philip and the Thebans did all in their power to prevent
it. But Demoſthenes exerting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon this occaſion, rouſed up the
Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and put them ſo far upon their guard, that, without coming to an
open rupture with Philip, they obliged him to deſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0813600202:81"/> Philip, however, did not continue idle upon
this diſappointment. Ever reſtleſs and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, he turned his
views another way: he had long conſidered the iſland of Eubaea as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
from its ſituation, to favour the deſigns he meditated againſt Greece;
and, in the very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of his reign, had attempted to poſſeſs
himſelf of it. He indeed ſet every engine to work at that time, in order to
ſeize upon that iſland, which he called the ſhackles of Greece. But it
nearly concerned the Athenians, on the other ſide, not to ſuffer it to fall
into the hands of an enemy, eſpecially as it might be joined to the continent
of Attica, by a bridge: however, that people, according to their uſual
cuſtom, continued indolent, whilſt Philip purſued his conqueſts. The
latter, who was continually at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive and vigilant, endeavoured to carry on an
intelligence in the iſland; and, by dint of preſents, bribed thoſe who
had the greateſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority in it. At the requeſt of certain of the
inhabitants, he ſent ſome troops privately thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, poſſeſſed
himſelf of ſeveral ſtrong places, diſmantled Porthmos, a very important
fortreſs in Eubaea, and eſtabliſhed three tyrants, or kings, over the
country.</p>
            <p>The Athenians were conjured, in this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſing juncture, by
one Plutarch, who was at <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0813600202:82"/> that time upon the iſland, to
come and deliver the inhabitants from the yoke which Philip was going to
impoſe upon them. Upon this, they diſpatched a few troops thither under the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Phocion, a general of whom great expectations were formed, and
whoſe conduct well deſerved the favourable opinion the public had of
him.</p>
            <p>This man would have done honour to the early and leaſt corrupted
times of the Athenian ſtate. His manners were formed in the aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy, upon
the models of the moſt exact and rigid virtue. It was ſaid, that no
Athenian ever ſaw him laugh, or weep, or deviate in any inſtance from the
moſt fettled gravity and compoſure. He learned the art of war under
Chabrias, and frequently moderated the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, and corrected the errors
of that general: his humanity he admired and imitated, and taught him to exert
it in a more extenſive and liberal manner. When he had received his
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to ſail, with twenty ſhips, to collect the contributions of the
allies and dependent cities; 
<q rend="inline">"Why that force?" ſaid Phocion; "if I am to meet
them as enemies, it is inſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; if I am ſent to friends and allies, a
ſingle veſſel will ſerve."</q> He bore the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of a military
life with ſo much eaſe, that <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0813600202:83"/> if Phocion ever appeared
warmly cloathed, the ſoldiers at once pronounced it the ſign of a
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably bad ſeaſon. His outward appearance was forbidding, but his
converſation eaſy and obliging; and all his words and actions expreſſed
the utmoſt affection and benevolence. In po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular aſſemblies, his lively,
cloſe, and natural manner of ſpeaking, ſeemed as it were the echo of the
ſimplicity and integrity of his mind, and had frequently a greater effect
than even the dignity and energy of Demoſthenes, who called him the pruner of
his periods. He ſtudied only good ſenſe and plain reaſoning, and
deſpiſed every adventitious ornament. In an aſſembly, when he was to
addreſs the people, he was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed by a friend, wrapped up in thought:

<q rend="inline">"I am conſidering," ſaid he, "whether I cannot
retrench ſome part of my intended addreſs."</q> He was ſenſible of the
ill conduct of his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and ever treated them with the greateſt
ſeverity. He defied their cenſures; and ſo far did he affect to
deſpiſe their applauſe, that at a time when his ſentiments extorted
their appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, he turned about in ſurpriſe, and aſked a friend, If
any thing weak or impertinent had eſcaped him? His ſenſe of the
degeneracy of Athens, made him fond of pacific meaſures. <pb n="82" facs="tcp:0813600202:84"/>
He ſaw the deſigns of Philip, but imagined that the ſtate was too
corrupted to give him any effectual oppoſition; ſo that he was of the
number of thoſe men who, according to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes in his third Phillipic
oration, gave up the intereſts of the ſtate, not corruptly or ignorantly,
but from a deſperate purpoſe of yielding to the fate of a conſtitution,
thought to be irrecoverably loſt. He was of conſequence ever of the party
oppoſite to Demoſthenes; and having been taught, by experience, to
ſuſpect the popular leaders, conſidered his earneſtneſs to rouſe
the Athenians to arms, as an artifice to embroil the ſtate, and by that means
to gain an influence in the aſſembly. 
<q rend="inline">"Phocion," ſaid Demoſthenes, "the people, in
ſome mad fit, will certainly ſacrifice thee to their fury."</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Yes," replied he, "and you will be their victim, if
ever they have an interval of reaſon."</q> Yet they often pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on him
to act againſt his judgment, though never to ſpeak againſt his
conſcience. He never refuſed or declined the command, whatever might be his
opinion of the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. Forty five times was he choſen to lead their
armies; generally in his abſence, and ever without the leaſt application.
They knew his <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0813600202:85"/> merit; and, in the hour of danger, forgot
that ſeverity with which he uſually treated their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations and
opinions.</p>
            <p>It was to him the Athenians gave the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the forces they
ſent to the aid of Plutarch of Eretria. But this traitor repaid his
benefactors with ingratitude; he ſet up the ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dard againſt them, and
endeavoured openly to repulſe the very army he had requeſted. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
Phocion was not at a loſs how to act upon this unforeſeen perfidy; for he
purſued his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, won a battle, and drove Plutarch from Eretria.</p>
            <p>Theſe diſappointments, however, no way in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timidated Philip, or
rendered him the leaſt remiſs in proſecuting his original deſign. He
now, therefore, changed the method of his attack, and ſought for an
opportunity of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſing Athens another way. He knew that this city,
from the barrenneſs of Attica, ſtood in greater want of foreign corn than
any other. To diſpoſe, at diſcretion, of their tranſports, and by that
means ſtarve the Athenians, he marched towards Thrace, from whence that city
imported the greateſt part of its proviſions, with an intention to
beſiege Perinthus and Byzantium. To keep his kingdom in obedience 
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0813600202:86"/> during his abſence, he left his ſon Alexander be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
with ſovereign authority, though he was fifteen years old. This young prince
gave, even at that time, ſome proofs of his courage; having defeated certain
neighbouring ſtates, ſubject to Macedonia, who had conſidered the king's
abſence as a very proper time for exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the deſign they had formed of
revolting. This happy ſucceſs of Alexander's firſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, was
highly agreeable to his father, and at the ſame time an earneſt of what
might be expected from him. But fearing leſt, allured by this dangerous bait,
he ſhould abandon himſelf inconſiderately to his vivacity and fire, he
ſent for him in order to become his maſter; and form him, in perſon, for
the trade of war.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Philip opened the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign with the ſiege of
Perinthus, a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able city of Thrace, and firmly attached to the
Athenians. It was aſſiſted from Byzantium, a neighbouring city, which
threw in ſuccours as occaſion required. Philip, therefore, reſolved to
beſiege both at the ſame time. Still, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he was deſirous to appear
cautious and tender of diſpleaſing the Athenians, whom he endeavoured to
amuſe with the moſt profound <pb n="85" facs="tcp:0813600202:87"/> reſpect, mixed with
well-timed abuſes, and the moſt flattering ſubmiſſion. Upon this
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, he wrote them a letter, reproaching them, in the ſtrongeſt
terms, for their infraction of treaties, and his own religious obſervance of
them. 
<q rend="inline">"In the times of great enmity," ſays he, "the
moſt you did was to fit out ſhips of war againſt me, and to ſeize and
ſell the merchants that came to trade in my domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions; but now you carry
your hatred and injuſtice to ſuch prodigious lengths, as even to ſend
ambaſſadors to the king of Perſia, to make him declare againſt
me."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This letter gave the orators who undertook Philip's defence, a fine
opportunity of juſtifying him to the people. Demoſthenes alone ſtood
firm, and ſtill continued to expoſe his artful deſigns, and to break down
all thoſe laboured ſchemes which were undertaken to deceive the people.
Senſible, on this occaſion, how ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary it was to remove the firſt
impreſſions which the peruſal of this letter might make, he immediately
aſcended the tribunal, and from thence harangued the people, with all the
thunder of his eloquence. He told them, the letter was written in a ſtyle not
ſuitable to the people of Athens; that it was a plain decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration 
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0813600202:88"/> of war againſt them; that Philip had long ſince made
the ſame declaration by his actions; and that, by the peace he had concluded
with them, he meant nothing further than a bare ceſſation of arms, in order
to gain time, and to take them more unprepared. From thence he proceeded to his
uſual topic of reproving them for their ſloth, for ſuffering themſelves
to be deluded by their orators who were in Philip's pay. 
<q rend="inline">"Convinced by theſe truths," continued he, "O
Athenians! and ſtrongly perſuaded that we can no longer be allowed to
affirm that we enjoy peace, (for Philip has now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared war againſt us by
his letter, and has long done the ſame by his conduct) you ought not to
ſpare either the public treaſure, or the poſſeſſions of private
perſons, but when occaſion ſhall require, haſte to your reſpective
ſtandards, and ſet abler generals at your head, than thoſe you have
hitherto employed; for no one among you ought to imagine, that the ſame men
who have ruined your affairs, will have abilities to reſtore them to their
former happy ſituation. Think how infamous it is, that a man from Macedon
ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn dangers to ſuch a degree, that merely to aggrandiſe his
empire, he ſhould ruſh into <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0813600202:89"/> the midſt of combats,
and return from battle covered with wounds; and that the Athenians, whoſe
hereditary right it is to obey no man, but to impoſe law on others, ſword
in hand; that Athenians, I ſay, merely through dejection of ſpirit and
indolence, ſhould degenerate from the glory of their anceſtors, and
aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don the intereſt of their country!"</q> To this expoſtulation, Phocion
readily offered his voice and opinion. He urged the incapacity of the generals
already choſen; and, in conſequence of his advice, he himſelf was
appointed general of the army that was to go againſt Philip, who was ſtill
beſieging Byzantium.</p>
            <p>Phocion having led his troops to the ſuccour of the Byzantians,
the inhabitants, on his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, opened their gates to him with joy, and
lodged his ſoldiers in their houſes, as their own brothers and children.
The Athenian officers and ſoldiers, ſtruck with the confidence repoſed in
them, behaved with the utmoſt prudence and modeſty, and were entirely
irreproachable in their conduct; nor were they leſs admired for their
courage; and in all the attacks they ſuſtained, diſcovered the utmoſt
intrepidity, which danger ſeemed only to improve. Pho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion's prudence,
ſeconded by the bravery of his <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0813600202:90"/> troops, ſoon forced
Philip to abandon his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon Byzantium and Perinthus. He was beat out
of the Helleſpont, which diminiſhed very much his fame and glory; for he
hitherto had been thought invincible, and nothing had been able to oppoſe
him. Phocion took ſome of his ſhips, recovered many fortreſſes which he
had garriſoned, and having made ſeveral deſcents into different parts of
his territories, he plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered all the open country, till a body of forces
aſſembling to check his progreſs, he was obliged to retire.</p>
            <p>Philip, after having been forced to raiſe the ſiege of
Byzantium, marched againſt Atheas king of Scythia; from whom he had received
ſome perſonal cauſe of diſcontent, and took his ſon with him in this
expedition. Though the Scythians had a very numerous army, he defeated them
without any difficulty: he got a very great booty, which conſiſted not in
gold or ſilver, the uſe and value of which the Scythians were not as yet
ſo unhappy as to know, but in cattle, in horſes, and a great number of
women and children.</p>
            <p>At his return from Scythia, the Triballi, a people of Moeſia,
diſputed the paſs with him, laying claim to part of the plunder he was
car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0813600202:91"/> off. Philip was forced to come to a battle; and
a very bloody one was fought, in which great numbers on each ſide were killed
on the ſpot: the king himſelf was wounded in the thigh, and, with the
ſame thruſt, had his horſe killed under him. Alexander flew to his
father's aid, and covering him with his ſhield, killed, or put to flight all
who attacked him.</p>
            <p>The Athenians had conſidered the ſiege of Byzantium as an
abſolute rupture, and an open declaration of war. The king of Macedon, who
was apprehenſive of the conſequences of it, and dreaded very much the power
of the Athenians, whoſe hatred he had drawn upon himſelf, made overtures of
peace, in order to ſoften their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment. Phocion, little
ſuſpicious, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of the uncertainty of military wants, was
of opinion, that the Athenians ſhould accept his offers: but Demoſthenes,
who had ſtudied more than Phocion the genius and character of Philip, and was
perſuaded that, according to his uſual cuſtom, his only view was to
impoſe upon the Athenians, prevented their liſtening to his pacific
propoſals. When Philip found the Athenians would not treat with him, and that
they were acting offenſively againſt him, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially at ſea, where
they blocked up his <pb n="90" facs="tcp:0813600202:92"/> ports, and put an entire ſtop to his
commerce, he began to form new alliances againſt them, particularly with the
Thebans and Theſſalians, without whom he knew he could not keep open his
paſſage into Greece. At the ſame time he was ſenſible, that his
engaging theſe powers to act directly againſt Athens, and in his own
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal quarrel, would have ſo bad an aſpect, that they would not
eaſily come into it. For which reaſon he endeavoured, underhand, to create
new diſturbances in Greece, that he might take ſuch a part in them, as
would beſt anſwer his views: and when the flame was kindled, his point was
to appear rather to be called in as an aſſiſtant, than to act as a
principal.</p>
            <p>By the reſult of his machinations, he ſoon found an opportunity
of raiſing diviſions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Locrians of Amphiſſa, and their
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital city. They were accuſed of having pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned a ſpot of ſacred
ground, (which lay very near the temple of Delphos), by ploughing it, as the
Phocians had done upon a former occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. In order to produce and widen this
breach, Philip employed Aeſchines the orator, who by bribes was entirely
devoted to him, to harangue at the aſſembly of the Amphyctions againſt
this outrage upon the religion of their <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0813600202:93"/> country.
Aeſchines was a man of great abilities, and only ſecond in eloquence to
Demoſthenes. He had now a fair opportunity of raiſing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, by
appearing only intereſted for his country, and zealous for the glory and
defence of Athens. With a paſſionate warmth, which is frequently the effect
of artifice as well as of real patriotiſm, and which is moſt likely to
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and more particularly in popular aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, by being
conſidered as the indication of ſincerity, and the overflowings of a heart
ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly affected, he boldly delivered his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. His ſentiments were
echoed through the aſſembly by the friends of Philip; the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult was kept
up to drown all remonſtrances of caution and policy, and a reſolution was
paſſed, that a deputation ſhould be ſent to Philip king of Macedon,
inviting him to aſſiſt Apollo and the Amphyctions, and to repel the
outrages of the impious Amphiſſoeans; and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to declare, that he was
conſtituted, by all the Greeks, member of the council of Amphyctions, and
general and commander of their forces, with full and unlimited powers.</p>
            <p>This welcome invitation and commiſſion, the fruit of all his
ſecret practices, Philip received in Thrace, while he was yet on his return
to <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0813600202:94"/> Macedon. He bowed with an affectionate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence to
the venerable council, and declared his readineſs to execute their
orders.</p>
            <p>The inferior ſtates of Greece, and all thoſe whoſe
ſimplicity and weakneſs rendered them inſenſible to the deſigns now
forming by Philip, entirely approved of the act of the Amphyctions; and of the
nomination of a prince to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of their forces, ſo eminent and
illuſtrious for his piety, and ſo capable of executing the vengeance of
Heaven. At Sparta and at Athens, this event was conſidered in a different
manner. The firſt of theſe people, though poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed but of a
ſmall part of their ancient great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, yet ſtill retained their pride,
and ſeemed to have looked with a ſullen indignation at the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours paid to
Macedon: the Athenians had been long taught to dread the policy of Philip, and
now their great popular leader repeatedly urged the neceſſity of
ſuſpicion, and repreſented all the late tranſactions in the
Amphyctionic council as the effects of Philip's intrigues, and a deſign
againſt Greece in general, but more particularly againſt the welfare and
liberty of Athens.</p>
            <p>To counteract the zeal of Demoſthenes, and to prevent the effects
of his inceſſant remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0813600202:95"/> the minds of the
people were alarmed with oracles and predictions, uttered with all ſolemnity
from the ſacred tripod, and reported to the Athenians with all the veneration
due to the dictates of Apollo. Vengeance was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced againſt all thoſe
who ſhould preſume to oppoſe the king of Macedon, the deſtined
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of Divine Juſtice; and the people were exhorted not to ſuffer
artful and deſigning ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and popular leaders, to ſeduce them to their
ruin.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Philip immediately got his troops together, and,
with all the ſhow of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious veneration, began to march, in order to
chaſtiſe the irreverent Locrians: but he had far different aims; and
inſtead of proceeding upon ſo ridiculous a commiſſion, made a ſudden
turn, and ſeized upon Elatea, a capital city of Phocis, which was very well
ſituated for awing the Thebans, of whom he began to grow jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and for
preparing his way to Athens. But by ſo extraordinary a ſtep as this, he
fairly threw off the maſk, and bade defiance to the whole body of Grecians.
Thus was this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing prince, all of a ſudden, maſter of a port of
the utmoſt conſequence; at the head of an army, capable of ſtriking
terror into his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers; at the diſtance of but two days march 
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0813600202:96"/> from Attica; abſolute commander, as it were, of the
citadel and fortreſs, both of Thebes and Athens; conveniently ſituated for
receiving ſuccours from Theſſaly and Macedon; and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely at liberty
either to give battle to thoſe who might preſume to appear in arms
againſt him, or to protract the war to any length that might be found
convenient.</p>
            <p>The news of Philip's recent tranſaction was quickly ſpread
through the adjacent countries, and received with all the ſtupid and
helpleſs aſtoniſhment of men rouſed from a long le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy, and awakened
to a dreadful ſenſe of their danger, and of the real deſigns of their
enemy. It was late in the evening when a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier arriving at Athens, appeared
before the Prytanes, and pronounced the dreadful tidings, that the king of
Macedon had taken poſſeſſion of Elatea. Theſe magiſtrates, and all
the other citizens, were now at ſupper, indulging them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the
pleaſures and gaieties of the table, when the news, which in an inſtant
rung through all the city, rouſed them from their ſtate of eaſe, and put
an end to all their ſeſtivity. The ſtreets and public places were
inſtantly filled with a diſtracted concourſe; every man with terror and
confuſion in his countenance, and every man ſolicitous for an immediate
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0813600202:97"/> on an emergency ſo important and
alarming. At the dawn of the ſucceeding day, the aſſembly met together,
impreſſed with that conſternation which urgent danger naturally
inſpires. The whole body of the people flocked to the ſenate-houſe,
ſeized their places, and waited with the utmoſt anxiety for ſo important
a deliberation. The herald, as was the cuſtom at Athens, aroſe, and cried
out with a loud voice, 
<q rend="inline">"Who among you will aſcend the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal?"</q> All
however was ſilence, terror and diſmay: he again repeated the invitation;
but ſtill no one roſe up, though all the generals and orators were
preſent. At length Demoſthenes, animated with the greatneſs of the
approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing danger, aroſe, undaunted and unmoved in this ſcene of horror.
With a countenance of ſerenity, the firm compoſure of a patriot, and the
ſage diſcernment of a complete ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, he addreſſed himſelf
to the aſſembly, in the following manner:—
<q rend="inline">"Athenians! permit me to explain the circumſtances
of that ſtate which Philip has now ſeized upon. Thoſe of its citizens
whom his gold could corrupt, or his artifice deceive, are all at his devotion.
What then is his deſign? By drawing up his forces, and diſplaying his
powers on the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of Thebes, he hopes to inſpire his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents 
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0813600202:98"/> with confidence and elevation, and to terrify and controul
his adverſaries, that fear or force may drive them into thoſe meaſures
which they have hitherto oppoſed. If then we are reſolved, in this
conjuncture, to cheriſh the remembrance of every act of unkindneſs, which
the Thebans have done to Athens; if we regard them with ſuſpicion, as men
who have ranged themſelves on the ſide of our enemy; in the firſt place,
we ſhall act agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to Philip's warmeſt wiſhes; and then I am
apprehenſive, that the party, who now oppoſe him, may be brought over to
his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; the whole city ſubmit unanimouſly to his direction; and
Thebes and Macedon fall, with their united force, on Attica. Grant the due
attention to what I ſhall now propoſe; let it be calmly weighed, without
diſpute or cavil, and I doubt not but that my counſels may direct you to
the beſt and moſt ſalutary meaſures, and diſpel the dangers now
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending over the ſtate. What then do I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend?—Firſt, ſhake
off that terror which hath poſſeſſed your minds; and, inſtead of
fearing for yourſelves, let the Thebans be the objects of your
apprehenſions: they are more immediately affected; they are the firſt to
feel the dangers. In the next place, all thoſe of <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0813600202:99"/> the
age for military ſervice, both infantry and cavalry, ſhould march
inſtantly to Eleuſis, that Greece may ſee, that you are alſo
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled in arms; and your friends in Thebes be emboldened to aſſert
their rights, when they are aſſured, that as they who have ſold their
country to the Macedonians, have a force at Elatea to ſupport them, ſo you
are ready to aſſiſt the men who bravely contend for liberty. In the
laſt place, I recommend to you to nominate ten ambaſſadors, who, with the
generals, may have full authority to determine the time, and all other
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this march. When theſe ambaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors arrive at Thebes,
how are they to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct this great affair? This is a point worthy of your
moſt ſerious attention. Make no demands of the Thebans; at this conjuncture
it would be diſhonourable: aſſure them that your aſſiſtance is
ready for their acceptance, as you are juſtly affected by their danger, and
have been ſo happy as to foreſee and to guard againſt it. If they approve
of your ſentiments, and embrace your overtures, we ſhall effect our great
purpoſe, and act with a dignity worthy of our ſtate. But ſhould it happen
that we are not ſo ſucceſsful, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever misfortunes they may ſuffer,
to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0813600202:100"/> ſhall they be imputed; while your
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſhall appear, in no one inſtance, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the
honour and renown of Athens."</q>
            </p>
            <p>This oration, delivered with eaſe and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, did not want
its due effect; it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with univerſal applauſe, and Demoſthenes
himſelf was inſtantly choſen to head the embaſſy which he had now
propoſed. A decree, in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of his advice, was drawn up in form; with
an additional clauſe, that a fleet of two hundred ſail ſhould be fitted
out, to cruize near Thermopylae.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of this, Demoſthenes ſet out for Thebes, making
the more haſte, as he was ſenſible that Philip might over-run Attica in
two days. Philip, on the other hand, in order to oppoſe the eloquence of
Demoſthenes, ſent ambaſſadors to Thebes, among whom was Python, who
particularly diſtinguiſhed himſelf by the livelineſs of his orations.
But his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſive powers were far inferior to thoſe of Demoſthenes,
who overcame all oppoſition. The maſculine eloquence of Demoſthenes was
ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible; and kindled in the ſouls of the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans ſo warm a zeal
for their country, and ſo ſtrong a paſſion for freedom, that they were
no longer maſters of themſelves; laying aſide all <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0813600202:101"/>
fear and gratitude, and all prudential con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations.</p>
            <p>That which animated Demoſthenes, next to his public ſafety, was
his having to do with a man of Python's abilities; and he ſome time after
took occaſion to value himſelf upon the victory he had obtained over him, 
<q rend="inline">"I did not give way," ſaid he, "to the boaſting
Python, when he would have bore me down with a torrent of words."</q> He
gloried more in the ſucceſs of this negociation, than of any other he had
been employed in, and ſpoke of it as his maſterpiece in politics.</p>
            <p>Philip, quite diſconcerted by the union of theſe two nations,
ſent ambaſſadors to the Athenians, to requeſt them not to levy an armed
force, but to live in harmony with him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, they were too juſtly
alarmed and exaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated, to liſten to any accommodation; and would no
longer depend on the word of a prince, whoſe whole aim was to deceive. In
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, preparations for war were made with the utmoſt diligence, and
the ſoldiery diſcovered incredible ardour. However, many evil-diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
perſons endeavoured to extinguiſh or damp it, by relating fatal omens, and
terrible pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, which the prieſteſs of Delphos was ſaid to have
uttered. But Demoſthenes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0813600202:102"/> firmly in the
arms of Greece, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged wonderfully by the number and bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of the
troops, who deſired only to march againſt the enemy, would not ſuffer
them to be amuſed with theſe oracles and frivolous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. It was on
this occaſion, he ſaid, that the prieſteſs Philipized; meaning, that it
was Philip's money that inſpired the prieſteſs, opened her mouth, and
made the god ſpeak whatever ſhe thought proper. He bade the Thebans
remember their Epaminondas, and the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians their Pericles; who conſidered
theſe ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles and predictions as idle ſcare-crows, and conſulted only
their reaſon. The Athenian army ſet out immediately, and marched to
Eleuſis; and the Thebans, ſurpriſed at the diligence of their
confederates, joined them, and waited the approach of the enemy.</p>
            <p>Philip, on his part, well knowing that the bravery and ſpirit of
his enemies wanted that direction which might enable them to improve their
advantages, and conſcious alſo of his own abilities, and the weakneſs of
thoſe generals who commanded the Greeks, determined to bring on a general
engagement, where his ſuperior ſkill muſt appear of the greateſt
moment. For this purpoſe he took a favourable opportunity of decamping, and
led his army to the plain of <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0813600202:103"/> Chaeronea, a name rendered
famous by the event of this important conteſt. Here he choſe his ſtation,
in view of a temple dedicated to Hercules, the author of his race, as if
reſolved to fight in his preſence; to make him witneſs of the actions of
his deſcendant, and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his forces, and his cauſe, to the immediate
protection of this hero. Some ancient oracles were preſerved, which ſeemed
to point out the ſpot on which he now encamped, as the ſcene of ſome
dreadful calamity to Greece.</p>
            <p>His army was formed of thirty-two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, warlike,
diſciplined, and long enur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the toils and dangers of the field; but this
body was compoſed of different nations and countries, who had each their
diſtinct, and ſeparate views and intereſts. The army of the confederates
did not amount to thirty thouſand complete; of which the Athenians and
Thebans furniſhed the greateſt part: the reſt was formed of the
Corinthians and Pelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poneſians. The ſame motives, and the ſame zeal,
influenced and animated them. All were equally affected by the event; and all
equally reſolved to conquer or die in defence of liberty.</p>
            <p>On the eve of the deciſive day, Diogenes, the famous cynic, who
had long looked with <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0813600202:104"/> equal contempt on either party, was
led by curioſity to viſit the camps as an unconcerned ſpectator. In the
Macedonian camp, where his character and perſon were not known, he was
ſtopped by the guards, and conducted to Philip's tent. The king expreſſed
ſurpriſe at a ſtranger's preſuming to approach his camp; and aſked,
with ſeverity, Whether he came as a ſpy? 
<q rend="inline">"Yes," ſaid Diogenes, "I am come to ſpy upon
your vanity and ambition, who thus wantonly ſet your life and kingdom to the
hazard of an hour."</q>
            </p>
            <p>And now the fatal morning appeared, which was for ever to decide the
cauſe of liberty, and the empire of Greece. Before the riſing of the ſun,
both armies were ranged in order of battle. The Thebans, commanded by
Theogenes, a man of but moderate abilities in war, and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected of
corruption, obtained the poſt of honour on the right wing of the confederated
Greeks; with that famous body in the front, called the Sacred Band, formed of
generous and warlike youths, connected and endeared to each other by all the
noble enthuſiaſm of love and friendſhip. The center was formed of the
Corinthians and Peloponeſians; and the Athenians compoſed the left wing,
led by their generals, Lyſicles and Chares. On <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0813600202:105"/> the
left of the Macedonian army ſtood Alexander, at the head of a choſen body
of noble Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, ſupported by the famous cavalry of Theſſaly. As
this prince was then but nineteen years old, his father was careful to curb his
youthful impetuoſity, and to direct his valour; and for this purpoſe
ſurrounded him with a number of experienced officers. In the center were
placed thoſe Greeks who had united with Philip, and on whoſe courage he had
the leaſt dependence; while the king himſelf command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the right wing,
where his renowned phalanx ſtood, to oppoſe the impetuoſity with which
the Athenians were well known to begin their onſet.</p>
            <p>The charge began on each ſide with all the courage and violence
which ambition, revenge, the love of glory, and the love of liberty, could
excite in the ſeveral combatants. Alexander, at the head of the Macedonian
nobles, firſt fell, with all the fury of youthful courage, on the Sacred Band
of Thebas; which ſuſtained his attack with a bravery and vigour worthy of
its former fame. The gallant youths who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed this body, not being
timely, or not duly ſupported by their countrymen, bore up for a while
againſt the torrent of the enemy; till at <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0813600202:106"/> length,
oppreſſed and overpowered by ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior numbers, without yielding or
turning their backs on their aſſailants; they ſunk down on that ground
where they had been originally ſtationed, each by the ſide of his darling
friend, raiſing up a bulwark by their bodies againſt the progreſs of the
army. But the young prince and his forces, in all the enthuſiaſtic ardor of
valour, animated by ſucceſs, puſhed on through all the carnage, and over
all the heaps of ſlain, and fell furiouſly on the main body of the Thebans;
where they were oppoſed with obſtinate and deliberate cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and the
conteſt was for ſome time ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported with mutual violence.</p>
            <p>The Athenians at the ſame time on the right wing, fought with a
ſpirit and intrepidity, worthy of the character which they boaſted, and of
the cauſe by which they were animated. Many brave efforts were exerted on
each ſide, and ſucceſs was for ſome time doubtful; till at length part
of the center, and the left wing of the Macedonians, (except the phalanx)
yielded to the impetuous attack of the Athenians, and fled with ſome
precipitation. Happy had it been on that day for Greece, if the conduct and
abilities of the Athenian generals had been equal to the valour of their
ſoldiers! but theſe brave <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0813600202:107"/> champions of liberty were
led on by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable creatures of intrigue and cabal. Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by
the advantage now obtained, the preſumptuous Lyſicles cried out, 
<q rend="inline">"Come on, my gallant countrymen; the victory is
ours; let us purſue theſe cowards, and drive them to Macedon:"</q> and
thus, inſtead of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving their happy opportunity, by charging the phalanx
in flank, and ſo breaking this formidable body, the Athenians wildly and
precipitately preſſed forward, in purſuit of the flying enemy;
themſelves in all the tumult and diſorder of a rout. Philip ſaw this
fatal error with the contempt of a ſkilful general, and the ſecret
exultation ariſing from the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of approaching victory. He coolly
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved to thoſe officers that ſtood round him, That the Athenians knew
not how to conquer; and ordered his phalanx to change its poſition, and, by a
ſudden evolution, to gain poſſeſſion of an adjacent eminence. From
thence they marched deliberately down, firm and collected, and fell, with their
united force, on the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, now confident of ſucceſs, and blind to
their danger. The ſhock was irreſiſtible; they were at once overwhelmed;
many of them lay cruſhed by the weight of the enemy, and expiring by their
wounds; while the reſt eſcaped <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0813600202:108"/> from the dreadful
ſlaughter, by a ſhameful and precipitate flight; bearing down, and hurrying
away with them, thoſe troops which had been ſtationed for their ſupport.
And here the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned orator and ſtateſman, whoſe noble ſentiments and
ſpirited harangues had raiſed the courage on this day ſo eminently
exerted, betrayed that weakneſs which has ſullied his great character. He
alone, of all his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, advanced to the charge, cold and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed;
and, at the very firſt appearance of a reverſe of fortune, in an agony of
terror, turned his back, caſt away that ſhield which he had adorned with
this inſcription, in golden characters, To Good Fortune; and appeared the
foremoſt in the general rout. The ridicule and malice of his enemies,
related, or perhaps invented another ſhameful circumſtance; that being
impeded in his flight by ſome brambles, his imagination was ſo
poſſeſſed with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of an enemy, that he loudly cried out
for quarter.</p>
            <p>While Philip was thus triumphant on his ſide, Alexander continued
the conflict on the other wing, and at length broke the Thebans in ſpight of
all their acts of valour, who now fled from the field, and were purſued with
great carnage. The center of the confederates was <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0813600202:109"/> thus
totally abandoned to the fury of a victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enemy. But enough of ſlaughter
had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been made; more than one thouſand of the Athenians lay dead on
the field of battle, two thouſand were made priſoners, and the loſs of
the Thebans was not inferior. Philip therefore determined to conclude his
important victory, by an act of apparent clemency, which his ambition and
policy really dictated. He gave orders that the Greeks ſhould be ſpared,
conſcious of his own deſigns, and ſtill expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to appear in the field
the head and leader of that body which he had now completely ſubdued.</p>
            <p>Philip was tranſported with this victory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure, and
having drank to exceſs at an entertainment which he gave upon that
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, went into the field of battle, where he inſulted over the
ſlain, and upbraided the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners with their misfortunes. He leaped and
danced about in a frantic manner, and with an air of burleſque merriment
ſung the beginning of the decree, which Demoſthenes had drawn up as a
declaration of the war againſt him. Demades, who was of the number of the
priſoners, had the courage to reproach him with this unge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous behaviour,
telling him, That fortune had given him the part of Agamemnon, but 
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0813600202:110"/> that he was acting that of Therſites. He was ſo
ſtruck with the juſtneſs of this reproof, that it wrought a thorough
change in him; and he was ſo far from being offended at Demades, that he
immediately gave him his liberty, and ſhewed him afterwards great marks of
honour and friendſhip. He likewiſe relieved all the Athenian captives, and
without ranſom; and when they found him ſo generouſly diſpoſed
towards them, they made a demand of their baggage, with every thing elſe that
had been taken from them; but to that Philip replied, 
<q rend="inline">"Surely they think I have not beat them."</q> This
diſcharge of the priſoners was aſcribed in a great meaſure to Demades,
who is ſaid to have new-modelled Philip. and to have ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his temper
with the Attic graces, as Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorus expreſſes it: indeed Philip himſelf
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged upon another occaſion, that his fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent converſe with the
Athenian orators, had been of great uſe to him in correcting his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals.
Juſtin repreſents his carriage after the battle in a very different light;
alleging that he took abundance of pains to diſſemble his joy; that he
affected great modeſty and compaſſion, and was not ſeen to laugh; that
he would have no ſacriſice, no crowns nor perfumes; that he forbade all
kinds of ſports; and did nothing <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0813600202:111"/> that might make him
appear to the conquerors to be elated, nor to the conquered, to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolent.
But this account ſeems to have been confounded with others which were given
of him, after his being reformed by Demades. It is certain that after his
firſt tranſport was over, and that he began to recollect himſelf, he
ſhewed great humanity to the Athenians; and that in order ſtill to keep
meaſures with them, he renewed the peace. But the The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans, who had renounced
their alliance with him, he treated in another manner. He who affected to be as
much maſter of his allies as of his ſubjects, could not eaſily pardon
thoſe who had deſerted him in ſo critical a conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Wherefore he
not only took ranſom for their priſoners, but made them pay for leave to
bury their dead. After theſe ſeverities, and after having placed a ſtrong
garriſon over them, he granted them a peace.</p>
            <p>We are told that Iſocrates, the moſt cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated rhetorician of
that age, who loved his country with the utmoſt tenderneſs, could not
ſurvive the loſs and ignominy with which it was covered, by the loſs of
the battle of Chaeronea. The inſtant he received the news of its being
uncertain what uſe Philip would make of his victory, and determined to die a 
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0813600202:112"/> freeman, he haſtened his end by abſtaining from
food; he was fourſcore and eighteen years of age. This defeat was attributed
chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the ill conduct of the Generals Lyſicles and Chares; the former
whereof the Athenians put to death at the inſtance of Lycurgus, who had great
credit and influence with the people, but was a ſevere judge, and a moſt
bitter accuſer. 
<q rend="inline">"You Lyſicles, ſaid he, were general of the
army; a thouſand citizens were ſlain, two thouſand taken priſoners; a
trophy has been erected to the diſhonour of this city, and all Greece is
enſlaved. You had the command when all theſe things happened; and yet you
dare to live, and view the light of the ſun, and bluſh not to appear
publicly in the forum; you Lyſicles, who are born the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your
country's ſhame!"</q> This Lycur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus was one of the orators of the firſt
rank, and free from the general corruption which then reigned among them. He
managed the public treaſure for twelve years with great uprightneſs, and
had all his life long the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation of a man of honour and virtue. He
encreaſed the ſhipping, ſupplied the arſenal, drove the bad men out of
the city, and fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral good laws. He kept an exact re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of
every thing he did during his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration; <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0813600202:113"/> and
when that was expired, he cauſed it to be fixed up to a pillar, that every
body might be at liberty to inſpect it, and to cenſure his conduct. He
carried this point ſo far, that, in his laſt ſickneſs he ordered
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be carried to the Senate-houſe to give a public account of all
his actions, and after he had refuted one who accuſed him there, he went home
and died. Notwithſtanding the auſterity of his temper, he was a great
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courager of the ſtage; which though it had been carried to an exceſs
that was manifeſtly hurtful to the public, he ſtill looked upon as the
beſt ſchool to inſtruct and poliſh the minds of the people. And to this
end, he kept up a ſpirit of emulation among the writers of Tragedy, and
erected the ſtatues of Aeſchylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. He left three
ſons who were unworthy of him, and behaved ſo ill, that they were all put
in priſon; but Demoſthenes, out of regard to the memory of their father,
got them diſcharged.</p>
            <p>It does not appear that Chares underwent any proſecution for his
ſhare of this action; though according to his general character, he
deſerved it as much or more than his colleague. For he had no talent for
command, and was very little different from a common ſoldier. 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0813600202:114"/> Timotheus ſaid of him, 
<q rend="inline">"That inſtead of being a general, he was fitter to
carry the general's baggage."</q> His perſon indeed was of that robuſt kind
of make; and it was that which ſerved in ſome meaſure to recommend him to
the people. But he was more a man of pleaſure than fatigue. In his military
expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, he was wont to carry with him a band of muſic; and he defrayed
the expence of it out of the ſoldiers' pay. Notwithſtanding his want of
abilities, he had a thorough good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of himſelf. He was vain and
poſitive, bold and boiſterous; a great undertaker, and always ready to
warrant ſucceſs; but his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances ſeldom anſwered; and hence it
was, that the promiſes of Chares became a proverb: And yet as little as he
was to be depended on, he had his partizans among the people, and among the
orators, by whoſe means he got himſelf to be frequently employed, and
others to be excluded who were more capable.</p>
            <p>But it was Demoſthenes who ſeemed to have been the principal
cauſe of the terrible ſhock which Athens received at this time, and which
gave its power ſuch a wound, as it never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. However, at the very
inſtant the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians heard of this bloody overthrow, which affected ſo
great a number of families, when it <pb n="113" facs="tcp:0813600202:115"/> would have been no
wonder, had the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, ſeized with terror and alarms, given way to an
emotion of blind zeal, againſt the man whom they might have conſidered in
ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as the author of this dreadful calamity; even at this very
inſtant, I ſay, the people ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted entirely to the councils of
Demoſthenes. The precautions that were taken to poſt guards to raiſe the
walls, and to repair the ditches, were all in conſequence of his advice. He
himſelf was appointed to ſupply the city with proviſions, and to repair
the walls, which latter commiſſion he executed with ſo much
genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that it acquired him the greateſt honour; and for which, at
the requeſt of Cteſiphon, a crown of gold was decreed him as a reward for
his having preſented the commonwealth with a ſum of money out of his own
eſtate, ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to defray what was wanting of the ſums for repairing
the walls.</p>
            <p>On the preſent occaſion, that is, after the battle of Chaeronea,
ſuch orators as oppoſed Demoſthenes, having all riſen up in concert
againſt him, and having cited him to take his trial according to law, the
people not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared him innocent of the ſeveral accuſations laid to
his charge, but conferred more honours upon him than he had enjoyed before;
ſo <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0813600202:116"/> ſtrongly did the veneration they had for his zeal
and fidelity overbalance the efforts of calumny and malice.</p>
            <p>But the people did not ſtop here. The bones of ſuch as had been
killed in the battle of Chaeronea having been brought to Athens to be interred,
they appointed Demoſthenes to compoſe the eulogium of thoſe brave men; a
manifeſt proof that they did not aſcribe to him the ill ſucceſs of the
battle, but to Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence only, who diſpoſes of human events at
pleaſure.</p>
            <p>It was in this year that Aeſchines drew up an accuſation
againſt Cteſiphon, or rather againſt Demoſthenes, which was the moſt
remarkable that ever appeared before any tribunal; not ſo much for the object
of the conteſt, as for the greatneſs and ability of the ſpeakers.
Cteſiphon, a partizan and friend of Demoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes, brought a cauſe before
the aſſembly of the people, in which he urged that a decree ſhould be
paſſed, giving a golden crown to Demoſthenes. This decree was ſtrongly
op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by Aeſchines, the rival of Demoſthenes, as well in eloquence as
in ambition.</p>
            <p>No cauſe ever excited ſo much curioſity, nor was pleaded with
ſo much pomp. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple flocked to it from all parts, and <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0813600202:117"/> they had great reaſon for ſo doing; for what ſight could be
nobler, than a conflict be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two orators, each of them excellent in his
way, both formed by nature, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by art, and animated by perpetual
diſſentions, and an implacable animoſity againſt each other.</p>
            <p>The juncture ſeemed to favour Aeſchines very much; for the
Macedonian party, whom he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways befriended, was very powerful in Athens,
eſpecially after the ruin of Thebes. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs Aeſchines loſt his
cauſe, and was juſtly ſentenced to baniſhment for his raſh
accuſation. He thereupon went, and ſettled himſelf in Rhodes, where he
opened a ſchool of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, the fame and glory of which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for
many ages. He began his lectures with the two orations that had occaſioned
his baniſhment. Great encomiums were given to that of Aeſchines; but when
they heard that of Demoſthenes, the plaudits and acclamations were redoubled.
And it was then he ſpoke theſe words, ſo greatly laudable in the mouth of
an enemy and a rival: 
<q rend="inline">"Alas! what applauſes would you not have
beſtowed, had you heard Demoſthenes ſpeak it himſelf?"</q>
            </p>
            <p>Demoſthenes thus become victor, made a good uſe of his
conqueſt. For the inſtant Aeſchines left <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0813600202:118"/> Athens,
in order to embark for Rhodes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes ran after him, and forced him to
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of a purſe of money. On this occaſion, Aeſchines cried out, How
will it be poſſible for me not to regret a country, in which I leave an
enemy more generous, than I can hope to find friends in any other part of the
world?</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Philip had his ambition pleaſed, but not
ſatisfied with his laſt victory; he had one object long in view, and that
he never loſt ſight of; this was to get himſelf ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in the
Aſſembly of the Greeks, their chief general againſt the Perſians. It
had long been the object, not only of the confederate ſtates, but alſo of
the neighbouring Greek nations, to revenge upon the kingdom of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, the
injuries they had ſuſtained from it; and to work the total deſtruction of
that Empire. This was an object which had early inflamed the mind of Philip,
and his late victory paved the way to it. He therefore got himſelf de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
Generaliſſimo of the Greek forces, and accordingly made preparations to
invade that mighty Empire.</p>
            <p>But whilſt Philip was thus ſucceſsful in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics and war,
the domeſtic diviſions that reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his family, embittered his
happineſs, and at laſt cauſed his deſtruction. He had mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried 
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0813600202:119"/> Olympias, the daughter of the king of Epirus, and the
early part of their union was crowned with happineſs; but her ill temper
ſoon clouded that dawn which promiſed ſo much felicity; ſhe was
naturally jealous, vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictive and paſſionate, and their diſſentions
were carried to ſuch a degree, that Philip was often heard to wiſh for
death. But his paſſion for Cleopatra, niece to Attalus, his general,
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted their ſeparation. As Cleopatra was no leſs amiable in her temper
and accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than in the extraordinary graces of her perſon, Philip
conceived that he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult his own happineſs moſt effectually,
by form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an inviolable and perpetual union with this lady; and, without the
leaſt heſitation, reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſeparate himſelf for ever from the
prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs who had long appeared ſo great an enemy to his tranquillity. In
vain did Alexander his ſon remonſtrate, that by divorcing Olympias, and
engaging in a ſecond marriage, he expoſed him to the danger of contending
with a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of competitors for the crown, and render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſucceſſion
precarious. 
<q rend="inline">"My ſon, ſaid the king, if I create you a number
of competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, you will have the glorious opportunity of exerting yourſelf
to ſurpaſs them in merit. Thus ſhall their rivalſhip by no means affect
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0813600202:120"/> your title."</q> His marriage with Cleopatra was now
declared in form, and celebrated with all the grandeur and ſolemnity which
the great occaſion demanded. The young prince how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſſatisfied, was
yet obliged to attend on theſe ſolemnities, and ſat in ſilent
indignation at that feaſt which proclaimed the diſgrace of his mother. In
ſuch circumſtances, his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and impetuous mind could not but be
ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſceptible of the ſlighteſt irritation. Attalus the uncle of the new
queen, forgetting that juſt caution, which ſhould have taught him to be
ſcrupulouſly obſervant to avoid offending the prince, intoxicated by the
honours paid to his kinſwoman, as well as by the preſent feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, was
raſh enough to call publicly on the Macedonian nobles to pour out their
libations to the gods, that they might grant the king the happy fruits of the
preſent nuptials, and legitimate heirs to his throne. Wretch! cried
Alexander, with his eyes ſparkling with that fury and vexation which he had
till now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, doſt thou then call me baſtard? and inſtantly
darted his goblet at Attalus, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the outrage with double violence.
Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour and confuſion aroſe, and the king, in a ſudden fit of rage,
ſnatched his ſword, and flew directly towards his ſon. His
precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0813600202:121"/> his lameneſs, and the quantity of wine
in which he had by this time indulged, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily diſappointed his raſh
purpoſe; he ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled and fell on the floor, while Alexander, with an
unpardonable inſolence, cried out, 
<q rend="inline">"Behold, ye Macedonians! this is the king who is
preparing to lead you into Aſia; ſee where in paſſing from one table to
another, he is fallen to the ground."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Philip however, did not loſe ſight of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of
Aſia. Full of the mighty project he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved, he conſulted the gods to
know what would be the event of it; and the prieſteſs replied, The victim
is already crowned, his end draws nigh, and he will ſoon be ſacrificed.
Philip hearing this, did not heſitate a moment, but interpreted the oracle in
his own favour; the ambiguity of which ought at leaſt to have kept him in
ſome ſuſpence. In order therefore, that he might be in a condition to
apply entirely to his expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt the Perſians, and elevate
himſelf ſolely to the conqueſt of Aſia, he diſpatched with all
poſſible diligence his domeſtic affairs. After this, he offered up a
ſolemn ſacrifice to the gods; and prepared to celebrate with incredible
magnificence in Egae, a city of Macedonia, the nuptials of Cleopatra his
daughter, whom he gave in marriage to Alexander king of Epirus, 
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0813600202:122"/> and brother to Olympias his queen. He had invited to it
the moſt conſiderable perſons of Greece, and heaped upon them
friendſhip and honours of every kind, by way of gratitude for electing him
Generaliſſimo of the Greeks. The cities made their court to him in
emulation of each other, by ſending him gold crowns; and Athens
diſtinguiſhed its zeal above all the reſt. Neoptolemus, the poet, had
written purpoſely for that feſtival, a tragedy entitled Cinyras, in which
under borrowed names, he repreſented this prince as already victor over
Darius, and maſter of Aſia. Philip liſtened to theſe happy preſages
with joy; and, comparing them with the anſwer of the oracle, aſſured
himſelf of conqueſt. The day after the nuptials, games, and ſhows were
ſolemnized. As theſe formed part of the religious worſhip, there were
car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in it, with great pomp and ceremony, twelve ſtatues of the gods,
carved with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imitable art; a thirteenth that ſurpaſſed them all in
magnificence, repreſented Philip as a god. The hour for his leaving the
palace arrived, he went forth in a white robe; and advanced with an air of
majeſty, in the midſt of acclamations, towards the theatre, where an
infinite multitude of Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians, <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0813600202:123"/> as well as
foreigners, waited his coming with impatience.</p>
            <p>But this magnificence only ſerved to make the cataſtrophe more
remarkable, and to add ſplendor to ruin. Some time before, Attalus, inflamed
with wine at an entertainment, had inſulted in the moſt ſhocking manner
Pauſanias a young Macedonian nobleman. The latter had long endeavoured to
revenge the cruel affront, and was perpetually imploring the king's juſtice.
But Philip, unwilling to diſguſt Attalus, uncle to Cleopatra, whom, as was
before obſerved, he had married after his divorcing Olympias his firſt
queen, would never liſten to Pauſanias's complaints. However, to conſole
him in ſome meaſure, and to expreſs the high eſteem he had for, and the
great confidence he repoſed in him, he made him one of the chief officers of
his life-guard. But this was not what the young Macedonian required, whoſe
anger now ſwelling to fury againſt his judge, he formed the deſign of
wiping out his ſhame, by imbruing his hands in the blood of his
ſovereign.</p>
            <p>And now while this unhappy youth continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brooding over thoſe
malignant paſſions which diſtracted and corroded his mind, he happened to
go into the ſchool of one Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, who profeſſed to teach
philoſophy; to <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0813600202:124"/> whom he propoſed the following
queſtion: What ſhall that man do, who wiſhes to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit his name with
luſtre to poſterity? Hermo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, either artfully and from deſign, or
the natural malignity of his temper, replied, 
<q rend="inline">"He muſt kill him who hath atchieved the
greateſt actions; thus ſhall the memory of the hero be joined with his who
ſlew him, and both de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend together to poſterity."</q> This was a maxim
highly agreeable to Pauſanias, in the preſent diſpoſition of his mind;
and thus various ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents and circumſtances, concurred to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame thoſe
dangerous paſſions which now poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed him, and to prompt him to
the dreadful purpoſe of ſatiating his revenge.</p>
            <p>The preſent ſolemnity was that which Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanias choſe to put
his dreadful deſign into execution. Philip, cloathed in a white flowing robe,
waving in ſoft and graceful folds, the habiliments in which the Grecian
deities were uſually repreſented, moved forward with an heart filled with
triumph and exultation, while the admiring crowds ſhouted forth their
flattering applauſe. His guards had orders to keep at a conſiderable
diſtance from his perſon, to ſhew that the king confided in the
affections of his people, and had not the leaſt apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of danger
amidſt all this mixed concourſe <pb n="123" facs="tcp:0813600202:125"/> of different
ſtates and nations. Unhappily the danger was but too near him. The injured
Pauſanias had not yet forgot his wrongs, but ſtill retained thoſe
terrible impreſſions which the ſenſe of the indignity he had received,
and the artful and intereſted repreſentations of others, fixed deeply in
his mind. He choſe this fatal morning for the execution of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge on
the prince who had denied reparation to his injured honour. His deſign had
been for ſome time premeditated, and now was the dreadful moment of effecting
it. As Philip marched on in all his pride and pomp, this young Macedonian
ſlipped through the crowd, and with a deſperate and malignant reſolution
waited his approach in a narrow paſſage, juſt at the entrance into the
theatre. The king advanced towards him, Pauſanias drew his poniard, plunged
it into his heart, and the conqueror of Greece, and terror of Aſia, fell
proſtrate to the ground, and inſtantly expired.</p>
            <p>The murderer flew towards the gates of the city, where there ſtood
horſes ready to favour his eſcape, which Olympias herſelf is ſaid to
have prepared. The tumult and confuſion was ſuch as might be expected from
ſo fatal an event; ſome of the Macedonians crowded round the fallen king
with officious and ineffectual <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0813600202:126"/> care, while others
purſued Pauſanias. Among theſe were Perdicas, Attalus and Leonatus; the
firſt who excelled in ſwiftneſs came up to the aſſaſſin, where he
was juſt preparing to mount his horſe, but being by his precipitation
intangled in ſome vines, a violent effort to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate his foot, brought him
ſuddenly to the ground. As he prepared to riſe, Perdicas was upon him, and
with his companions, ſoon diſpatched him by the repeated wounds which their
fury inflicted. His body was immediately hung on a gibbet, but, in the morning
appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed crowned with a golden diadem; the only means by which Olympias could
now expreſs her implacable reſentment. In a few days in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſhe took a
further occaſion of publiſhing her triumph and exultation in her
huſband's fall, by paying the ſame funeral honours to Pauſanias, which
were prepared for Philip; both bodies were burnt on the ſame pile, and the
aſhes of both depoſited in the ſame tomb. She is even ſaid to have
prevailed on the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians to pay annual honours to Pauſanias; as if ſhe
feared that the ſhare ſhe had taken in the death of Philip, ſhould not be
ſufficiently known to the world. She conſecrated to Apollo the dagger which
had been the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the fatal deed, inſcribed with the name 
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0813600202:127"/> Myrtalis, the name which ſhe had borne when their
loves firſt began.</p>
            <p>Thus died Philip, whoſe virtues and vices were directed and
proportioned to his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. His moſt ſhining and exalted qualities were
influenced in a great meaſure by his love of power; and even the moſt
exceptionable parts of his conduct were principally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by their
conveniency and expediency. If he was unjuſt, he was, like Caeſar, unjuſt
for the ſake of Empire. If he gloried by the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs acquired by his
virtues and his intellectual accompliſhments, rather than in that which the
force of arms could gain, the reaſon which he himſelf aſſigned, points
out his true prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. 
<q rend="inline">"In the former caſe, ſaid he, the glory is
intirely mine; in the other, my ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals and ſoldiers have their
ſhare."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The news of Philip's death was a joyful ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize in Greece, and
particularly in Athens, where the people crowned themſelves with garlands,
and decreed a crown to Pauſanias. They ſacrificed to the gods for their
deliverance, and ſung ſongs of triumph; as if Philip had been ſlain by
them in battle. But this exceſs of joy did ill become them. It was looked
upon as an ungenerous and unmanly inſult upon the aſhes of a murdered
prince, and of <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0813600202:128"/> one whom they juſt before had revered,
and crouched to in the moſt abject manner. Theſe immoderate tranſports
were raiſed in them by Demoſthenes, who having the firſt intelligence of
Philip's death, went into the aſſembly unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally gay and chearful, with
a chaplet on his head, and in a rich habit, though it was then but the
ſeventh day after the death of his daughter. From this circumſtance,
Plutarch, at the ſame time that he condemns the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the Athenians
in general upon this occaſion, takes an opportunity to juſtify
Demoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henes, and extols him as a patriot, for not ſuffering his domeſtic
afflictions to interfere with the good fortune of the commonwealth. But he
certainly might have acted the part of a good citizen with more decency, and
not have given up to inſult, what was due to good manners.</p>

the throne upon the death of his father, and took poſſeſſion of a
kingdom rendered flouriſhing and powerful by the policy of the preceding
reign.</p>
            <p>He came into the world the very day the celebrated Temple of Diana
at Epheſus was burnt, upon which occaſion the report goes, that Hegeſias
the hiſtorian was heard to ſay, That it was no wonder the temple was burnt,
as Diana was that day employed at the delivery of Olympias, to facilitate the
birth of Alexander.</p>
            <p>The paſſion which prevailed moſt in Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, even from his
tender years, was ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and an ardent deſire of glory; but not for every
ſpecies of glory. Philip like a ſophiſt, valued himſelf upon his
eloquence, and the beauty of his ſtyle; and had the vanity to have engraved
on his coins the ſeveral victories he <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0813600202:130"/> had won at the
Olympick games in the chariot race. But it was not after ſuch empty honours
that his ſon aſpired. His friends aſked him one day, Whether he would not
be preſent at the games abovementioned, in order to diſpute the prize
beſtowed on that occaſion? for he was very ſwift of foot. He anſwered,
That he would contend in them, provided kings were to be his antagoniſts.</p>
            <p>Every time news was brought him that his father had taken ſome
city, or gained ſome great battle, Alexander ſo far from ſharing in the
general joy, uſed to ſay in a plaintive tone of voice, to the young
perſons that were brought up with him, Friends, my father will poſſeſs
himſelf of every thing, and leave nothing for me to do.</p>
            <p>One day ſome ambaſſadors from the king of Perſia being
arrived at court during Philip's abſence, Alexander gave them ſo kind and
ſo polite a reception, and regaled them in ſo noble and generous a manner
as charmed them all; but that which moſt ſurprized them was, the good
ſenſe and judgment he diſcovered in the ſeveral converſations they
had with him. He did not propoſe to them any thing that was trifling, and
like one of his age; ſuch for inſtance, as enquiring about the ſo much 
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0813600202:131"/> boaſted gardens ſuſpended in the air, the riches
and magnificence of the palace; and court of the king of Perſia, which
excited the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the whole world; the famous golden plantane-tree;
and that golden vine, the grapes of which were of emeralds, carbuncles, rubies,
and all ſorts of precious ſtones, under which the Perſian monarch was
ſaid frequently to give audience. Alexander, I ſay, aſked them
queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a quite different nature; enquiring which was the road to Upper
Aſia; the diſtance of the ſeveral places; in what the ſtrength and
power of the king of Perſia conſiſted; in what part of the battle he
fought; how he behaved towards his enemies, and in what manner he governed his
ſubjects. Theſe ambaſſadors ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired him all the while; and perceiving,
even at that time, how great he might one day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, they obſerved, in a
few words, the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference they found between Alexander and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taxerxes, by
ſaying one to another, 
<q rend="inline">"This young prince is great, and ours is rich: that
man muſt be vaſtly inſignificant, who has no other merit than his
riches!"</q>
            </p>
            <p>So ripe a judgment in this young prince, was owing as much to the
good education which had been given him, as to the happineſs 
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0813600202:132"/> of his natural parts. Several preceptors were appointed
to teach him all ſuch arts and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences as are worthy the heir to a great
king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and the chief of theſe was Leonidas, a perſon of the moſt
ſevere morals, and a relation to the queen. This Leonidas, in their journies
together, uſed frequently to look into the trunks where his beds and cloaths
were laid, in order to ſee if Olympias, his mother, had not put ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
ſuperfluous into them, which might ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter to delicacy and luxury.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt ſervice Philip did his ſon, was appointing
Ariſtotle his preceptor, the moſt famous and the moſt learned
philoſopher of his age, whom he intruſted with the whole care of his
education. One of the reaſons which prompted Philip to chuſe him a maſter
of ſo conſpicuous reputation and merit, was, as he himſelf tells us, that
his ſon might avoid committing a great many faults, of which he himſelf had
been guilty.</p>
            <p>Philip was ſenſible how great a treaſure he poſſeſſed
in the perſon of Ariſtotle; for which reaſon he ſettled a very genteel
ſtipend upon him, and afterwards rewarded his pains and care in an infinitely
more glorious manner; for hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſtroyed and laid waſte the city of
Stagira, <pb n="131" facs="tcp:0813600202:133"/> the native place of that philoſopher, he
rebuilt it, purely out of affection for him; reinſtated the inhabitants, who
had fled from it, or were made ſlaves, and gave them a fine park in the
neighbourhood of Stagira, as a place for their ſtudies and aſſemblies.
Even in Plutarch's time, the ſtone ſeats which Ariſtotle had placed there
were ſtanding; as alſo ſpacious viſtoes, under which thoſe who walked
were ſhaded from the ſun-beams.</p>
            <p>Alexander likewiſe diſcovered no leſs eſteem for his
maſter, whom he believed himſelf bound to love as much as if he had been
his father; declaring, That he was indebted to the one for living, and to the
other for living well. The progreſs of the pupil was equal to the care and
abilities of the preceptor. He grew vaſtly fond of philoſophy, and learned
the ſeveral parts of it; but in a manner ſuitable to his birth. Ariſtotle
endeavoured to improve his judgment, by laying down ſure and certain rules,
by which he might diſtinguiſh juſt and ſolid reaſoning from what is
but ſpeciouſly ſo; and by accuſtoming him to ſeparate in
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe all ſuch parts as only dazzle, from thoſe which are truly
ſolid, and conſtitute its whole value. But Alexander applied himſelf
chiefly <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0813600202:134"/> to morality, which is properly the ſcience of
kings, becauſe it is the knowledge of mankind, and of their duties. This he
made his ſerious and profound ſtudy; and conſidered it even at that time
as the foundation of prudence and wiſe policy.</p>
            <p>The greateſt maſter of rhetoric that antiquity could ever
boaſt, and who has left ſo excellent a treatiſe on that ſubject, took
care to make that ſcience part of his pupil's education; and we find that
Alexander, even in the midſt of his conqueſt, was often very urgent with
Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle to ſend him a treatiſe on that ſubject. To this we owe the
work entitled Alexander's Rhetoric; in the beginning of which, Ariſtotle
proves to him the vaſt advantages a prince may reap from eloquence; as it
gives him the greateſt aſcendant over the minds of men, which he ought to
acquire as well by his wiſdom as authority. Some anſwers and letters of
Alexander, which are ſtill extant, ſhew that he poſſeſſed, in its
greateſt perfection, that ſtrong, that manly eloquence, which abounds with
ſenſe and ideas, and which is ſo entirely free from ſuperfluous
expreſſions, that every ſingle word has its meaning; which, properly
ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is the eloquence of kings.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0813600202:135"/> His eſteem, or rather his paſſion for
Homer, ſhews, not only with what vigour and ſucceſs he applied to polite
literature, but the judicious uſe he made of it, and the ſolid advantages
he propoſed to himſelf from it. He was not only prompted to peruſe this
poet merely out of cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, or to unbend his mind, or from a great
fondneſs for poetry; but his view in ſtudy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this admirable writer, was
to borrow ſuch ſentiments from him, as were worthy a great king and
conqueror; courage, intrepidity, mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, temperance, prudence; the art of
commanding well in war and peace. The verſe which pleaſed him moſt in
Homer, was that where Agamemnon is repreſented as a good king and a brave
warrior.</p>
            <p>After this, it is no wonder that Alexander ſhould have ſo high
an eſteem for this poet. Thus when, after the battle of Arbela, the
Macedonians had found, among the ſpoils of Darius, a gold box (enriched with
precious ſtones) in which the excellent perfumes uſed by that prince were
put, Alexander, who was quite covered with duſt, and regardleſs of
eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſences and perfumes, ordered, that this box ſhould be employed to no
other uſe than to hold Homer's poems; which he believed the moſt perfect,
the moſt preciſe production of the <pb n="134" facs="tcp:0813600202:136"/> human mind. He
admired particularly the Iliad, which he called, The beſt proviſion for a
warrior. He always had with him that edition of Homer which Ariſtotle had
reviſed and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and to which the title of The Edition of the Box was
given; and he laid it with his ſword every night under his pillow.</p>
            <p>Fond, even to exceſs, of every kind of glory, he was
diſpleaſed with Ariſtotle his maſter, for having publiſhed, in his
abſence, certain meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical pieces, which he himſelf deſired to
poſſeſs only; and even at the time when he was employed in the conqueſt
of Aſia, and the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of Darius, he wrote to him a letter, which is
ſtill extant, wherein he complains upon that very account. Alexander ſays
in it, That he had much rather ſurpſs the reſt of men in the knowledge of
ſublime and excellent things, than in the greatneſs and extent of his
powers. He in like manner requeſted Ariſtotle not to ſhew the treatiſe
of rhetoric above mentioned to any perſon but himſelf.</p>
            <p>He had alſo a taſte for the whole circle of arts, but in ſuch
a manner as became a prince; that is, he knew the value and uſefulneſs of
them. Muſic, painting, ſculpture, architecture, flouriſhed in his reign;
becauſe they found him both a ſkilful judge and a generous protector; 
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0813600202:137"/> who was able to diſtinguiſh and to reward merit.</p>
            <p>But he deſpiſed certain trifling feats of dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, that were
of no uſe. Some Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians admired very much a man, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed himſelf
very attentively in throwing ſmall peas through the eye of a needle; which he
would do at a conſiderable diſtance, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out once miſſing.
Alexander ſeeing him at this exerciſe, ordered him, as we are told, a
preſent ſuitable to his employment; <hi>viz,</hi> a baſket of peas.</p>
            <p>Alexander was of a ſprightly diſpoſition, was reſolute, and
very tenacious of his opinion, which never gave way to force, but at the ſame
time would ſubmit immediately to reaſon and good ſenſe. It is very
difficult to treat with perſons of this turn of mind: Philip accordingly,
notwithſtanding his double authority of king and father, believed it
neceſſary to employ per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion rather than force with reſpect to his
ſon, and endeavoured to make himſelf beloved rather than feared by him.</p>
            <p>An accident made him entertain a very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous opinion of
Alexander. There had been ſent from Theſſaly to Philip a war-horſe; a
noble, ſtrong, fiery, generous beaſt, called <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0813600202:138"/>
Bucephalus. The owner would not ſell him under thirteen talents; an immenſe
ſum! The king went into the plains, attended by his courtiers, in order to
view the perfections of this horſe; but, upon trial, he appeared ſo very
fierce, and pranced about in ſo furious a manner, that no one dared to mount
him. Philip being angry that ſo furious and unmanageable a creature had been
ſent him, gave orders for their carrying him back again. Alexander, who was
preſent at that time, cried out, 
<q rend="inline">"What a noble horſe we are going to loſe, for
want of addreſs and boldneſs to back him!"</q> Philip at firſt
conſidered theſe words as the effect of folly and raſhneſs, ſo common
to young men; but as Alexander in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted ſtill more upon what he had
ſaid, and was very much vexed to ſee ſo noble a creature juſt going to
be ſent home again, his father gave him leave to try what he could do. The
young prince overjoyed at this permiſſion, goes up to Bucephalus, takes
hold of the bridle, and turns his head to the ſun, having obſerved, that
the thing which frighted him, was his own ſhadow; Alexander therefore firſt
ſtroked him gently with his hand, and ſoothed him with his voice; then
ſeeing his fierceneſs abate, and artfully <pb n="137" facs="tcp:0813600202:139"/> taking
this opportunity, he let fall his cloak, and ſpringing ſwiftly upon his
back, firſt ſlackened the rein, without once ſtriking or vexing him; and
when he perceived that his fire was cooled, that he was no longer ſo furious
and violent, and wanted only to move forward, he gave him the rein, and
ſpurring him with great vigour, animated him with his voice to his full
ſpeed. While this was doing, Philip and his whole court trembled for fear,
and did not once open their lips; but when the prince, after having run his
firſt heat, returned with joy and pride, at his having broke a horſe which
was judged abſolutely ungovernable, all the courtiers in general endeavoured
to outvie one another in their applauſes and congratulations; and we are
told, Philip ſhed tears of joy on this occaſion; and embracing Alexander,
after he was alighted, and kiſſing him, he ſaid to him, 
<q rend="inline">"My ſon, ſeek a kingdom more worthy of thee, for
Macedon is below thy merit."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Alexander upon his acceſſion to the throne, ſaw himſelf
ſurrounded with extreme dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers; the barbarous nations with whom Philip
contended during his whole reign, thought this change for their advantage, and
deſpiſing the youth and inexperience of the young mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch, 
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0813600202:140"/> reſolved to ſeize this opportunity of regaining
their freedom, for ſatiating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with plunder: nor had he leſs to
fear from the Greeks themſelves, who now thought this a convenient
opportunity to reſtore their ancient form of government, revenge their
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer injuries, and reclaim thoſe rights which they had enjoyed for
ages.</p>
            <p>Alexander however reſolved to prevent their machinations, and to
give them no time to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete their confederacies againſt him. After taking
revenge upon the conſpirators againſt his father, whom he ſlew upon his
tomb, he firſt conciliated the affections of the Macedonians to him, by
freeing them from a vexatious and bodily ſlavery, only commanding their
ſervice in his wars.</p>
            <p>The Macedonians reflecting on his precarious ſituation, adviſed
him to relinquiſh Greece, and not perſiſt in his reſolution of
ſubduing it by force; to recover by gentle methods the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians who had
taken arms; and to ſoothe, as it were, thoſe glimmerings of revolt and
inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, by prudent reſerve, complacency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuations, in order to
conciliate their affections. However, Alexander would not liſten to theſe
timorous counſels, but reſolved to ſecure and ſupport his affairs, by
boldneſs and magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0813600202:141"/> firmly perſuaded, that
ſhould he relax in any point at firſt, all his neighbours would fall upon
him; and that were he to endeavour to compromiſe matters, he ſhould be
obliged to give up all Philip's conqueſts, and by that means confine his
dominions to the narrow li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of Macedon. He therefore made all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
haſte to check the arms of the barbarians, by marching his troops to the
banks of the Danube, which he croſſed in one night. He defeated the king of
the Triballi in a great battle; made the Getae fly at his approach; ſubdued
ſeveral barbarous nations, ſome by the terror of his name, and others by
force of arms; and notwithſtanding the arrogant anſwers of their
ambaſſadors, he taught them to dread a danger, which they found but too
well prepared to overwhelm them.</p>
            <p>Whilſt Alexander was thus employed at a diſtance againſt the
barbarians, all the cities of Greece, who were animated more particularly by
Demoſthenes, formed a powerful alliance againſt him. A falſe report which
prevailed of his death, inſpired the Thebans with a boldneſs that proved
their ruin. They cut to pieces part of the Macedonian garriſon in their
citadel. Demoſthenes, on the other ſide, was every day haranguing the
people; and fired <pb n="140" facs="tcp:0813600202:142"/> with contempt for Alexander, whom he
called a child and a hair-brained boy, he aſſured the Athenians, with a
deciſive tone of voice, that they had nothing to fear from the new king of
Macedon, who did not dare to ſtir out of his kingdom, but would think
himſelf vaſtly happy could he ſit peaceably on his throne. At the ſame
time he wrote letters upon letters to Attalus, one of Philip's lieutenants in
Aſia Minor, to excite him to rebel. This Attalus was uncle to Cleopatra,
Philip's ſecond wife, and was very much diſpoſed to liſten to
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſthenes's propoſals. Nevertheleſs, as Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander was grown very
diſfident of him, for which he knew there was but too much reaſon, he
therefore, to eradicate from his mind all the ſuſpicions he might
entertain, and the better to ſcreen his deſigns, ſent all Demoſthenes's
letters to that prince: but Alexander ſaw through all his artiſices, and
thereupon ordered Hecataeus, one of his commanders, whom he had ſent into
Aſia for that purpoſe, to have him aſſaſſinated, which was executed
accordingly. Attalus's death reſtored tranquillity to the army, and entirely
deſtroyed the ſeeds of diſcord and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
            <p>The object which ſeized Alexander's earlieſt ambition, was the
conqueſt of Perſia; and he <pb n="141" facs="tcp:0813600202:143"/> now expected that he
would have leiſure and opportunity to prepare for ſo great an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize:
but he was ſoon called to a new under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; the Athenians, Thebans and
Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians united againſt him; hoping, by the aſſiſtance of
Perſia, to recover their former freedom. In order to perſuade the Greeks to
this, Demoſthenes made uſe of a device, which had more cunning in it than
wiſdom. He cauſed it to be reported that Alexander was ſlain in a battle
againſt the Triballi; and he produced a man to the aſſembly, who ventured
to affirm, that he was preſent, and wounded, when his general was ſlain.
Theſe falſe reports, which ſerve for a day, are but bad policy; like a
falſe alarm in battle, the people may ſometimes be mocked by them; but in
the end, the ſucceſs will prove as ridiculous as the invention; for as
thoſe that find themſelves at one time abuſed by ſuch, at other times
neglect the real call of truth, by being ſummoned without occaſion, they
fatally deſpiſe the hour of danger. This unfortunate obſtacle obliged
Alexander to turn his ſword from the Perſians againſt the Greeks, of
whoſe aſſiſtance he had but juſt before aſſured himſelf.</p>
            <p>Expedition and activity were the character<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtics of this
monarch's conduct; he led his <pb n="142" facs="tcp:0813600202:144"/> army againſt the Greeks
with ſo much celerity, that his appearance before them gave the firſt news
of his preparation. He appeared ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly in Boeotia, that the Thebans
could ſcarce believe their eyes; and being come before their walls, was
willing to give them time to repent; and only demanded to have Phoenix and
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thules, the two chief ringleaders of the revolt, delivered up to him; and
publiſhed, by ſound of trumpet, a general pardon to all who ſhould come
over to him. But the Thebans, by way of inſult, demanded to have Philotas and
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater delivered to them; and invited, by a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, all who were
ſolicitous for the liberty of Greece, to join with them in its defence.</p>
            <p>Alexander finding it impoſſible for him to get the better of
their obſtinacy by offers of peace, ſaw with grief that he ſhould be
forced to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his power, and decide the affair by force of arms. A great
battle was thereupon fought, in which the Thebans exerted themſelves with a
bravery and ardour much beyond their ſtrength, for the enemy exceeded them
vaſtly in numbers. But after a long and vigorous reſiſtance, ſuch as
ſurvived of the Macedonian garriſon in the citadel, coming down from it,
and charging the Thebans in the rear; being ſurrounded on all ſides, the
greateſt part of them were cut to pieces, and the city taken and
plundered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="143" facs="tcp:0813600202:145"/> It would be impoſſible for words to
expreſs the dreadful calamities which the Thebans ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered on this
occaſion. Some Thracians having pulled down the houſe of a virtuous lady of
quality, Timoclea by name, carried off all her goods and treaſures; and their
captain having ſeized the lady, and ſatiated his brutal luſt with her,
afterwards enquired whether ſhe had not concealed gold and ſilver.
Timoclea, animated by an ardent deſire of revenge, replying, That ſhe had
hid ſome, took him with herſelf only into her garden, and ſhewing him a
well, told him, That the inſtant ſhe ſaw the enemy enter the city, ſhe
herſelf had thrown into it the moſt precious things in her
poſſeſſion. The officer, overjoyed at what he heard, drew near the
well, and ſtoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down to ſee its depth, Timoclea, who was behind,
puſhing him with all her ſtrength, threw him in, and afterwards killed him
with great ſtones, which ſhe heaped upon him. She was inſtantly ſeized
by the Thracians, and being bound in chains, was carried before Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander. The
prince perceived immediately by her mien, that ſhe was a woman of quality,
and great ſpirit; for ſhe followed thoſe brutal wretches with a very
haughty air, and without diſcovering the leaſt fear. Alexander aſking her
who ſhe was, Timoclea replied, 
<q rend="inline">"I am ſiſter <pb n="144" facs="tcp:0813600202:146"/> to
Theagenes, who fought againſt Philip for the liberty of Greece, and was
killed in the battle of Chaeronea, where he commanded."</q> The prince,
admiring her generous anſwer, and ſtill more the action that ſhe had
done, gave orders that ſhe ſhould have leave to retire wherever ſhe
pleaſed with her children.</p>
            <p>Alexander then debated in council how to act with regard to Thebes.
The Phocians, and the people of Plataea, Theſpiae, and Orchomenus, who were
all in alliance with Alexander, and had ſhared in his victory, repreſented
to him the cruel treatment they had met with from the Thebans, who alſo had
deſtroyed their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral cities, and reproached them with the zeal which
they had always diſcovered in favour of the Perſians againſt the Greeks,
who held them in the utmoſt deteſtation; the proof of which was, the oath
they had all taken to deſtroy Thebes, after they ſhould have vanquiſhed
the Perſians.</p>
            <p>Cleades, one of the priſoners, being permitted to ſpeak,
endeavoured to excuſe in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the revolt of the Thebans; a fault
which in his opinion ſhould be imputed to a raſh and credulous imprudence,
rather than to depravity of will and declared perfidy. He remonſtrated, that
his countrymen, upon a falſe report of <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0813600202:147"/> Alexander's
death, had indeed too raſhly broke into rebellion, not againſt the king,
but againſt his ſucceſſors; that what crimes ſoever they might have
committed, they had been pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for them with the utmoſt ſeverity, by
the dreadful calamity which had befallen their city; that there now remained in
it none but women, children and old men, from whom they had nothing to fear;
and who were ſo much the greater objects of compaſſion, as they had been
no ways concerned in the revolt. He concluded with reminding Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, that
Thebes, which had given birth to ſo many gods and heroes, ſeveral of whom
were that king's anceſtors, had alſo been the ſeat of his father Philip's
riſing glory, and like a ſecond native country to him.</p>
            <p>Theſe motives which Cleades urged, were very ſtrong and
powerful; nevertheleſs, the anger of the conqueror prevailed, and the city
was deſtroyed. However, he ſet at liberty the prieſts; all ſuch as had
right of hoſpitality with the Macedonians; the deſcendants of Pindar, the
famous poet, who had done ſo much honour to Greece; and ſuch as had
oppoſed the revolt. But all the reſt, in number about thirty thouſand, he
ſold; and upwards of ſix thouſand had been killed in battle. The
Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians <pb n="146" facs="tcp:0813600202:148"/> were ſo ſenſibly afflicted at the ſad
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter which had befallen Thebes, that being about to ſolemnize the
feſtival of the great myſteries, they ſuſpended them upon account of
their extreme grief; and received, with the greateſt humanity, all thoſe
who had fled from the battle, and the plunder of Thebes, and made Athens their
aſylum.</p>
            <p>Alexander's ſo ſudden arrival in Greece, had very much abated
the haughtineſs of the Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, and extinguiſhed Demoſthenes's
vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence and fire; but the ruin of Thebes, which was ſtill more ſudden,
threw them into the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſternation. They therefore had recourſe to
intreaties, and ſent a deputation to Alexander to implore his clemency;
Demoſthenes was among them; but he was no ſooner arrived at Mount Cytheron,
than dreading the anger of that prince, he quitted the embaſſy, and
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home.</p>
            <p>Immediately Alexander ſent to Athens, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring the citizens to
deliver up to him ten orators, whom he ſuppoſed to have been the chief
inſtruments in forming the league which Philip his father had defeated at
Chaeronea. It was on this occaſion that Demoſthenes related to the people
the fable of the wolves and dogs; in which it is ſuppoſed, That the wolves
one day <pb n="147" facs="tcp:0813600202:149"/> told the ſheep, that in caſe they deſired
to be at peace with them, they muſt deliver up to them the dogs who were
their guard. The application was eaſy and natural; eſpecially with
reſpect to the orators, who were juſtly compared to dogs, whoſe duty it
was to watch, to bark, and to fight, in order to ſave the lives of the
flock.</p>
            <p>In this afflicting dilemma of the Athenians, who could not prevvail
with themſelves to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up their orators to certain death, though they
had no other way to ſave their city, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mades, whom Alexander had honoured
with his friendſhip, offered to undertake the embaſſy alone, and
intercede for them. The king, whether he had ſatiated his revenge, or
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to blot out, if poſſible, by ſome act of clemency, the
barbarous action he had juſt before committed; or rather to remove the
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral obſtacles which might retard the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his grand deſign,
and by that means not leave, during his abſence, the leaſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for
murmurs, waved his demand with regard to the delivery of the orators, and was
pacified by their ſending Caridemus into ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment; who being a native of
Oraea, had been preſented by the Athenians with his freedom, for the
ſervices he had done the <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0813600202:150"/> republic. He was ſon-in-law
to Cherſobleptus, king of Thrace; had learned the art of war under
Iphicrates; and had himſelf frequently commanded the Athenian armies. To
avoid the purſuit of Alexander, he took refuge with the king of Perſia.</p>
            <p>As for the Athenians, he not only forgave them the ſeveral
injuries he pretended to have received, but expreſſed a particular regard
for them, exhorting them to apply themſelves vigorouſly to public affairs,
and to keep a watchful eye over the ſeveral tranſactions which might
happen; becauſe, in caſe of his death, their city was to give laws to the
reſt of Greece. Hiſtorians relate, that many years after this expedition,
he was ſeized with deep remorſe for the calamity he had brought upon the
Thebans; and that this made him behave with much greater humanity towards many
other nations.</p>
            <p>So dreadful an example of ſeverity towards ſo powerful a city as
Thebes, ſpread the terror of his arms through all Greece, and made all things
give way before him. He ſummoned at Corinth, the aſſembly of the
ſeveral ſtates and free cities of Greece, to obtain from them the ſame
ſupreme command againſt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0813600202:151"/> which had
been granted his father a little before his death. No aſſembly ever debated
upon a more important ſubject. It was the weſtern world deliberating upon
the ruin of the eaſt; and the methods for executing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge which had been
ſuſpended more than an age. The aſſembly held at this time, gave riſe
to events, the relation of which appear aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and almoſt
incredible; and to revolutions which contributed to change the diſpoſition
of moſt things in the political world.</p>
            <p>To form ſuch a deſign, required a prince bold, enterpriſing,
and experienced in war; one of great views, who, having acquired a great name
by his exploits, was not to be intimidated by dangers, nor checked by
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles; but, above all, a monarch, who had a ſupreme authority over all
the ſtates of Greece, none of which, ſingly, was powerful enough to make
ſo arduous an attempt; and which required, in order for their acting in
concert, to be ſubject to one chief, who might give motion to the ſeveral
parts of that great body, by making them all concur to the ſame end. Such a
prince was Alexander: it was not difficult for him to rekindle in the minds of
the people their ancient hatred of the Perſians. <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0813600202:152"/> their
perpetual and irreconcileable enemies; whoſe deſtruction they had more than
once ſwore, and whom they had determined to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate, in caſe an
opportunity ſhould preſent itſelf for that purpoſe; a hatred which the
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine feuds of the Greeks might indeed have ſuſpended, but could
never extinguiſh. The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal retreat of the ten thouſand Greeks,
notwithſtanding the vigorous oppoſition of the prodigious army of the
Perſians, ſhewed plainly what might be expected from an army com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of
the flower of the forces of all the cities of Greece, and thoſe of Macedon,
commanded by generals and officers formed under Philip; and to ſay all in a
word, led by Alexander. The deliberations of the aſſembly were therefore
very ſhort; and that prince was unanimouſly appointed generaliſſimo
againſt the Perſians.</p>
            <p>Immediately a great number of officers, and governors of cities,
with many philoſophers, waited upon Alexander, to congratulate him upon his
election. He flattered himſelf, that Diogenes of Synope, who was then at
Corinth, would alſo come like the reſt, and pay his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments. This
philoſopher, who entertained a very mean idea of grandeur, thought it
improper to congratulate men juſt upon their exaltation; 
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0813600202:153"/> but that mankind ought to wait till thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
ſhould perform actions worthy of their high ſtations. Diogenes therefore
ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued at home; upon which Alexander, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by all his
courtiers, made him a viſit. The philoſopher was at that time lying down in
the ſun; but ſeeing ſo great a crowd of people advancing towards him, he
ſat up, and fixed his eyes on Alexander. This prince, ſurprized to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
ſo famous a philoſopher reduced to ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme poverty, after
ſaluting him in the kindeſt manner, aſked, Whether he wanted any thing?
Diogenes replied, 
<q rend="inline">"Yes, that you would ſtand a little out of my
ſun-ſhine."</q> This anſwer raiſed the contempt and indignation of all
the courtiers; but the monarch, ſtruck with the philoſopher's greatneſs
of ſoul, 
<q rend="inline">"Were I not Alexander," ſays he, "I would be
Diogenes."</q> In a word, all or nothing preſents us with the true image of
Alexander and Diogenes. How great and powerful ſoever that prince might think
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he could not deny himſelf, on this occaſion, inferior to a man
to whom he could give, and from whom he could take nothing.</p>
            <p>Alexander, before he ſet out for Aſia, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to
conſult the oracle of Apollo. He therefore went to Delphos, where he happened
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0813600202:154"/> to arrive in thoſe days which are called unlucky; a
ſeaſon in which people were forbid conſulting the oracle: and accordingly
the prieſteſs refuſed to go to the temple. But Alexander, who could not
bear any contradiction to his will, took her forcibly by the arm, and as he was
leading her to the temple, ſhe cried out, 
<q rend="inline">"My ſon, thou art irreſiſtible."</q> This was
all he deſired; and catching hold of theſe words, which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as
ſpoke by the oracle, he ſet out for Macedonia, in order to make
preparations for his great expedition.</p>
            <p>Alexander being arrived in his kingdom, held a council with the
chief officers of his army, and the nobles of his court, on the expedition he
meditated againſt Perſia, and the meaſures he ſhould take in order to
ſucceed in it. The whole aſſembly were unanimous, except in one article.
Antipater and Parmenio were of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that the king, before he engaged in an
enterprize which would neceſſarily be a long one, ought to make choice of a
conſort, in order to ſecure himſelf a ſucceſſor to his throne. But
Alexander, who was of a violent fiery tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, did not approve of this advice;
and believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that after he had been nominated generaliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimo of the
Greeks, and that his father had left <pb n="153" facs="tcp:0813600202:155"/> him an invincible
army, it would be a ſhame for him to loſe his time in ſolemnizing his
nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials, and waiting for the fruits of it; for which reaſon he determined
to ſet out immediately.</p>
            <p>Accordingly he offered up very ſplendid ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to the gods,
and cauſed to be celebrated at Dia, a city of Macedon, ſcenical games that
had been inſtituted by one of his anceſtors in honour of Jupiter and the
Muſes. This feſtival continued nine days, agreeable to the number of
thoſe goddeſſes. He had a tent raiſed large enough to hold an hundred
tables, on which conſequently nine hundred covers might be laid. To this
feaſt, the ſeveral princes of his family, all the ambaſſadors,
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals and officers were invited.</p>
            <p>Before he ſet out upon his great expedition, he ſettled the
affairs of Macedon, over which he appointed Antipater as viceroy, with twelve
thouſand foot, and near the ſame number of horſe. He alſo enquired into
the domeſtic affairs of his friends, giving to one an eſtate in land, to
another a village, to a third the revenues of a town, to a fourth the toll of
an harbour. As all the revenues of his demeſnes were already employed, and
exhauſted by his donations, Perdicas ſaid to him, 
<q rend="inline">"My lord, what is it <pb n="154" facs="tcp:0813600202:156"/> you
reſerve for yourſelf?"</q> Alexander replied, Hope: upon which Perdicas
ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"the ſame hope ought therefore to ſatisfy
us;"</q> and ſo refuſed very generouſly to accept of what the king had
appointed him.</p>
            <p>After having completely ſettled his affairs in Macedonia, and
uſed all the precautions imaginable to prevent any troubles from ariſing in
it during his abſence, he ſet out for Aſia in the beginning of the
Spring. His army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of little more than thirty thouſand foot, and
four or five thouſand horſe; but then they were all brave men, well
diſciplined, and enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to fatigues. They had made ſeveral cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns
under Philip, and were each of them in caſe of neceſſity capable of
commanding: moſt of the officers were near threeſcore years of age, and the
common men fifty; and when they were either aſſembled, or drawn up at the
head of a camp, they had the air of a venerable ſenate. Parmenio commanded
the infantry, Philotas his ſon, had eighteen hundred horſe under him; and
Callas, the ſon of Harpalus, the ſame number of Theſſalian cavalry. The
reſt of the horſe were compoſed of natives of the ſeveral ſtates of
Greece, and amounted to ſix hundred, had their particular commander. The 
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0813600202:157"/> Thracians and Poeonians, who were always in front, were
headed by Caſſander. Alexander began his march along the lake Cercinum,
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Amphipolis; croſſed the river Strymon, near its mouth; afterwards
the Hebrus, and arrived at Seſtos after twenty days march. He then commanded
Parmenio to croſs over from Seſtos to Abydos, with all the horſe, and
part of the foot; which he accordingly did with the aſſiſtance of an
hundred and threeſcore gallies, and ſeveral flat-bottomed veſſels;
while he himſelf croſſed over the Helleſpont, ſteering his gally with
his own hands: and when he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived near the ſhore, as if to take
poſſeſſion of the continent, he leaped from his ſhip in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete
armour, and teſtified many tranſports of joy.</p>
            <p>This confidence ſoon began to diffuſe itſelf over all the
reſt of his army; it inſpired his ſoldiers with ſo much courage and
ſecurity, that they fancied themſelves marching not to a precarious war,
but a certain victory.</p>
            <p>Being arrived at the city of Lampſacus, which he was determined to
deſtroy, in order to puniſh the rebellion of its inhabitants, Anaxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menes,
a native of that place, came to him. This man, who was a famous hiſtorian,
had been very intimate with Philip his father; and Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander 
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0813600202:158"/> himſelf had a great eſteem for him, having been his
pupil. The king ſuſpecting the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he came upon, to be
before-hand with him, ſwore, in expreſs terms, that he would never grant
his requeſt. The favour I have to deſire of you, ſays Anaximenes, is,
that you would deſtroy Lampſacus. By this witty evaſion, the hiſtorian
ſaved his country.</p>
            <p>From thence Alexander went to Troy, where he paid great honours to
the ſhade of Achilles, and cauſed games to be celebrated round his tomb. He
admired and envied the felicity of that Grecian hero, in having found during
life a faithful friend in Patroclus; and after death a noble panegyriſt in
Homer.</p>
            <p>When the news of Alexander's landing in Aſia was brought to
Darius, he teſtified the utmoſt contempt for the Macedonian army, and
indignation at the preſumption of their generals. In a letter which he wrote,
he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended his audacious inſolence, and gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to his various
governors, in the different parts of his dominions, that if they took
Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander alive, to whip him with rods, make pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of his whole army,
and ſend them as ſlaves to one of the moſt deſerted parts of his
dominions. Thus confiding in the glittering<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> 
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0813600202:159"/> but barbarous multitude which he commanded,
he diſpoſed of the enemy as already vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but confidence goes but
a ſhort part of the road to ſucceſs. The great numbers which he had
gathered, only brought unwiedly ſplendor into the field, and inſtead of
procuring him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, increaſed his embarraſſments.</p>
            <p>Alexander, being at length arrived on the banks of the Grannicus, a
river of Phrygia, there firſt found the Perſians diſpoſed to diſpute
his paſſage. The Perſian ſatrap taking poſſeſſion of the higher
banks, at the head of an army of one hundred thouſand foot, and upwards of
ten thouſand horſe, ſeemed to promiſe themſelves victory. Memnon, who
was a Rhodian, and commanded under Darius all the coaſt of Aſia, had
adviſed the generals not to venture a battle, but to lay waſte the plains,
and even the cities, thereby to ſtarve Alexander's army, and oblige him to
return back into Europe. Memnon was the beſt of all Darius's generals, and
had been the principal agent in his victories. It is not eaſily to determine
what we ought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire moſt in him; whether his great wiſdom in council,
his courage and capacity in the field, or his zeal and attachment to his
ſovereign. The council he gave on this occaſion was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, 
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0813600202:160"/> when we conſider that his enemy was fiery and
impetuous; had neither town, maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zine, or place of retreat; that he was
entering a country to which he was abſolutely a ſtranger, and inhabited by
enemies; that delays alone would weaken and ruin him; and that his only hopes
lay in giving battle immediately. But Arfites a Phrygian ſatrap oppoſed the
opinion of Memnon, and proteſted he would never ſuffer the Grecians to make
ſuch havock in the territories he governed. This ill council pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over
that of the Rhodian, whom the Perſians to their great prejudice ſuſpected
of a deſign to protract the war, and by that means of making himſelf
neceſſary to Darius.</p>
            <p>Alexander in the mean time marched on at the head of his heavy armed
infantry, drawn up in two lines, with the cavalry in the wings, and the baggage
following in the rear. Being ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived upon the banks of the Grannicus,
Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menio adviſed him to encamp there in battle array, in order that his
forces might have time to reſt themſelves, and not to paſs the river till
very early next morning, becauſe the enemy would then be leſs able to
prevent him: He added, that it would be too dangerous to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt croſſing
a river in ſight of an enemy, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0813600202:161"/> as that
before them was deep, and its banks very craggy; ſo that the Perſian
cavalry, who waited their coming in battle array, on the other ſide, might
eaſily defeat them before they were drawn up: That beſides the loſs which
would be ſuſtained on this occaſion, this enterprize, in caſe it
ſhould prove unſucceſsful, would be of dangerous conſequence to their
future affairs; the fame and glory of arms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending on the firſt
actions.</p>
            <p>However theſe reaſons were not able to make the leaſt
impreſſion on Alexander, who declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it would be a ſhame ſhould
he, after croſſing the Helleſpont, ſuffer his progreſs to be retarded
by a rivulet; for ſo he called the Grannicus out of contempt; that they ought
to take advantage of the terror which the ſuddenneſs of his arrival, and
the boldneſs of his attempt, had ſpread amongſt the Perſians; and
anſwer the high opinion the world conceived of his courage, and the valour of
the Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians. The enemy's horſe which was very nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, lined the whole
ſhore, and formed a large front, in order to oppoſe Alexander where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he
ſhould endeavour to paſs; and the foot, which conſiſted chiefly of
Greeks in Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius's ſervice, was poſted behind upon an eaſy aſcent.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0813600202:162"/> The two armies continued a long time in
ſight of each other, on the banks of the river, as if dreading the event. The
Perſians waited till the Macedonians ſhould enter the river, in order to
charge them to advantage upon their landing, and the latter ſeemed to be
making choice of a place proper for croſſing, and to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the
countenance of their enemies. Upon this, Alexander ordered his horſe to be
brought, commanded the noblemen of the court to follow him, and behave
gallantly. He himſelf com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the right wing, and Parmenio the left. The
king firſt cauſed a ſtrong detachment to march into the river, himſelf
following it with the reſt of the forces. He made Parmenio ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
afterwards with the left wing: he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf led on the right wing into the
river, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the reſt of the troops; the trumpets ſounding, and the
whole army raiſing cries of joy.</p>
            <p>The Perſians ſeeing this detachment advance forward, began to
let fly their arrows, and march to a place where the declivity was not ſo
great, in order to keep the Macedonians from landing. But now the horſe
engaged with great fury, one part endeavouring to land, and the other
ſtriving to prevent them. The Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians, whoſe cavalry was vaſtly
inferior in <pb n="161" facs="tcp:0813600202:163"/> number, beſides the advantage of the
ground, were wounded with the darts, that were ſhot from the eminence; not to
mention that the flower of the Perſian horſe were drawn toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this
place, and that Memnon in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert with his ſons, commanded there. The
Macedonians therefore at firſt gave ground, after having loſt the firſt
ranks which made a vigorous defence. Alexander, who had follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them cloſe,
and reinforced them with his beſt troops, headed them himſelf, animated
them by his preſence, puſhed the Perſians, and routed them; upon which
the whole army fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed after, croſs'd the river, and attacked the enemy on
all ſides.</p>
            <p>Alexander firſt charged the thickeſt part of the enemy's
horſe, in which the generals fought. He himſelf was particularly
conſpicuous by his ſhield, and the plume of feathers that over-ſhadowed
his helmet, on the two ſides of which, there roſe two wings, as it were, of
a great length, and ſo vaſtly white, that they dazzled the eyes of the
beholder. The charge was very furious about his perſon, and though only the
horſe engaged, they fought like foot, man to man, without giving way on
either ſide; every one ſtriving to repulſe his adverſary, and gain
ground of him. Spithrobates, lieutenant-governor <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0813600202:164"/> of
Ionia, and ſon-in-law to Darius, diſtinguiſhed himſelf above the reſt
of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals by his ſuperior bravery. Being ſurrounded by forty
Perſian lords, all of them his relations of experienced valour, and who never
moved from his ſide, he carried terror where-ever he went. Alexander
obſerving in how gallant a manner he ſignalized himſelf, clapt ſpurs to
his horſe, and advanced towards him. Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately they engaged, and each
having thrown a javelin, wounded the other ſlightly. Spithro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates falls
furiouſly ſword in hand upon Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, who being prepared for him,
thruſts his pike into his face, and laid him dead at his feet. At that very
moment, Raſaces, brother to that nobleman, charging him on the ſide, gave
him ſo furious a blow on the head with his battle-axe that he beat off his
plume, but went no deeper than the hair. As he was going to repeat his blow on
the head, which now appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through his fractured helmet, Clitus cut off
Raſaces's hand with one ſtroke of his ſcimetar, and by that means ſaved
his ſovereign's life. The danger to which Alexander had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
greatly animated the courage of his ſoldiers, who now performed wonders. The
Perſians in the center of the horſe, upon whom the light-armed troops, who
had been poſted <pb n="163" facs="tcp:0813600202:165"/> in the intervals of the horſe,
poured a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual diſcharge of darts, being unable to ſuſtain any
longer the attack of the Macedonians, who ſtruck them all in the face, the
two wings were immediately broke, and put to flight. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander did not
purſue them long, but turned about immediately to charge the foot.</p>
            <p>Theſe at firſt ſtood their ground, but when they ſaw
themſelves attacked at the ſame time by the cavalry, and the Macedonian
phalanx which had croſſed the river, and that the bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions were now
engaged, thoſe of the Perſians did not make either a long or a vigorous
reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and were ſoon put to flight; the Grecian infantry in
Darius's ſervice excepted. This body of foot retiring to a hill, demanded a
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe from Alexander to let them march away unmoleſted; but following
the dictates of his wrath, rather than thoſe of reaſon, he ruſhed into
the midſt of this body of foot, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently loſt his horſe, (not
Bucephalus) who was killed with the thruſt of a ſword. The battle was ſo
hot round him, that moſt of the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians, who loſt their lives on this
occaſion, fell here; for they fought againſt a body of men, who were well
diſciplined, had been inured to war, and fought in deſpair. They 
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0813600202:166"/> were all cut to pieces, two thouſand excepted, who
were taken priſoners.</p>
            <p>A great number of the Perſian commanders lay dead on the ſpot.
Ariſtes fled into Phrygia, where it is ſaid he laid violent hands on
him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for having been the cauſe that the battle was fought. Twenty
thouſand foot, and two thouſand five hundred horſe, were killed in this
engagement, on the ſide of the barbarians; and of the Macedonians,
twenty-five of the royal horſe were killed at the firſt attack. Alexander
ordered Lyſippus to make their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues in braſs, all of which were ſet
up in a city of Macedon, called Dia, from whence they were many years after
carried to Rome, by Metellus. About threeſcore of the other horſe were
killed, and near thirty foot, who, the next day, were all laid with their arms
and equipage in one grave; and the king granted an exemption to their fathers
and children, from every kind of tribute and ſervice.</p>
            <p>He alſo took the utmoſt care of the wounded, viſited them, and
ſaw their wounds dreſſed. He enquired very particularly into their
adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and permitted every one of them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late his actions in the
battle, and boaſt his bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. He alſo granted the rites of ſepulture to
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0813600202:167"/> the principal Perſians, and did not even refuſe it
to ſuch Greeks as died in the Perſian ſervice; but all thoſe whom he
took priſoners, he laid in chains, and ſent to work as ſlaves in
Macedonia, for having fought under the barbarian ſtandard againſt their
country, contrary to the expreſs prohibition made by Greece upon that
head.</p>
            <p>Alexander made it his duty and pleaſure to ſhare the honour of
his victory with the Greeks; and ſent particularly to the Athenians, three
hundred ſhields, being part of the plunder taken from the enemy, and cauſed
the glorious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription following to be inſcribed on the reſt of the
ſpoils: 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Alexander ſon of Philip, with the Greeks,
(the Lacedemonians excepted), gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe ſpoils from the barbarians, who
inhabit Aſia.</hi>"</q> The greateſt part of the gold and ſilver plate,
the purple carpets, and other furniture of the Perſian luxury, he ſent to
his mother.</p>
            <p>This victory not only impreſſed the Perſians with
conſternation, but ſerved to excite the ardour of the invading army. The
Perſians perceiving that the Greeks were not able to overcome them, though
poſſeſſed of manifeſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, ſuppoſed that they never could
be able to face them upon equal terms; and thus, from the firſt miſchance,
they gave up all hopes <pb n="166" facs="tcp:0813600202:168"/> of ſucceeding by valour.
Indeed, in all inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions where the nations invaded have been once beaten,
with great advantages of place on their ſide, ſuch as defenſive rivers,
ſtraits, and mountains; they ſoon begin to perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that
upon equal terms, ſuch an enemy muſt be irreſiſtible. It is the opinion
of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel, that he who reſolves to defend a paſſage, ſhould do it
with his ableſt forces; for few regions of any circuit are ſo well defended
by nature, that armies of ſuch force as may be thought ſufficient to
conquer them, cannot break through the natural difficulties of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance;
one paſſage or other is commonly left unguarded; and ſome place weakly
defended, will be the cauſe of a fatal triumph to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders. How often
have the Alps given way to armies breaking into Italy? and tho' they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
dreadful difficulties and dangers among thoſe that ſcaled them, yet they
were never found to give ſecurity to thoſe that lay behind. It was
therefore wiſely done of Alexander to paſs the river in the face of the
enemy, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out marching higher to ſeek an eaſier paſſage, or labouring
to convey his men over it by ſome ſaſer method. Having beaten the enemy
upon their own terms, he no leſs deſtroyed their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation than their
ſtrength, leaving the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0813600202:169"/> ſubjects of ſuch a
ſtate, no hopes of ſuccour from ſuch unable protectors.</p>
            <p>Soon after the battle of Grannicus, he recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sardis from the
enemy, which was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the bulwark of the Barbarian empire on the ſide
next the ſea; he took the inhabitants under his protection, received their
nobles with the utmoſt condeſcenſion, and permitted them to be governed
by their own laws and maxims, obſerving to his friends around him, That
ſuch as lay the foundations of a new dominion, ſhould always endeavour to
have the fame of being merciful. Four days after, he arrived at Epheſus,
carrying with him thoſe who had been baniſhed from thence for being his
adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, and reſtored its popular form of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He aſſigned to
the Temple of Diana, the tributes which were paid to the kings of Perſia.
Before he left Epheſus, the deputies of the cities of Trallis and Magneſia
waited upon him with the keys of thoſe places.</p>
            <p>He afterwards marched to Miletus; which city, flattered with the
hopes of a ſudden and powerful ſupport, ſhut their gates againſt him;
and indeed the Perſian fleet, which was very conſiderable, made a ſhew as
if it would ſuccour that city; but after having made ſeveral fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
attempts to engage that of the enemy, it <pb n="168" facs="tcp:0813600202:170"/> was forced to
ſail way. Memnon had ſhut himſelf up in this fortreſs, with a great
number of his ſoldiers who had eſcaped from the battle, and was determined
to make a good defence. Alexander, who would not loſe a moment's time,
attacked it, and planted ſcaling-ladders on all ſides. The ſcalade was
carried on with great vigour, and oppoſed with no leſs intrepidity, though
Alexander ſent freſh troops to relieve each other without the leaſt
intermiſſion; and this laſted ſeveral days. At laſt finding his
ſoldiers were every where repulſed, and that the city was provided with
every thing for a long ſiege, he planted all his machines againſt it, made
a great number of breaches, and whenever theſe were attacked, a new ſcalade
was attempted. The beſieged, after ſuſtaining all theſe efforts with
prodigious bravery, capitulat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prevent being taken by ſtorm. Alexander
treated the Mileſians with the utmoſt humanity, but ſold all the
foreigners who were found in it.</p>
            <p>After poſſeſſing himſelf of Miletus, he marched into
Caria, in order to lay ſiege to Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnaſſus. This city was of
prodigious difficult acceſs from its happy ſituation, and had been
ſtrongly fortified. Beſides Memnon, the ableſt as well as the moſt
valiant of all Darius's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders, had got into it with a body of choice 
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0813600202:171"/> ſoldiers, with a deſign to ſignalize his courage
and fidelity for his ſovereign. He accordingly made a very noble defence, in
which he was ſeconded by Ephialtes, another general of great merit. Whatever
could be expected from the moſt intrepid bravery and the moſt conſummate
knowledge in the ſcience of war, was conſpicuous on both ſides on this
occaſion. Memnon finding it impoſſible for him to hold out any longer,
was forced to abandon the city. As the ſea was open to him, after having put
a ſtrong garriſon into the citadel, which was well ſtored with
proviſions, he took with him the ſurviving inhabitants, with all their
riches, and conveyed them into the iſland of Cos, which was not far from
Halicarnaſſus. Alexander did not think proper to beſiege the citadel, it
being of little importance after the city was deſtroyed, which he
demoliſhed to the very foundations. He left it after having encompaſſed
it with ſtrong walls, and left ſome good troops in the country.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, he reſtored Ada queen of Caria to her kingdom, of
which ſhe had been diſpoſſeſſed ſome time before; and as a
teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of the deep ſenſe ſhe had of the favours received from
Alexander, ſhe ſent him every day meats dreſſed in the moſt
exquiſite manner, <pb n="170" facs="tcp:0813600202:172"/> and the moſt excellent cooks of
every kind. Alexander anſwered the queen on this occaſion, That all this
train was of no ſervice to him; for that he was poſſeſſed of much
better cooks, whom Leonidas his governor had given him, one of whom prepared
him a good dinner, and an excellent ſupper, and thoſe were Temperance and
Exerciſe.</p>
            <p>Several kings of Aſia Minor, ſubmitted vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily to
Alexander; Mithridates, king of Pontus, was one of theſe, who afterwards
adhered to this prince, and followed him in his expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He was ſon to
Ariobarzanes governor of Phrygia and king of Pontus, of whom mention has been
made elſewhere. He is computed to be the ſixteenth king from Artabanus, who
is conſidered as the founder of that kingdom, of which he was put in
poſſeſſion by Darius, ſon of Hyſtaſpes his father. The famous
Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates, who ſo long employed the Roman armies, was one of his
ſucceſſors.</p>
            <p>The year enſuing, Alexander began the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign very early. He had
debated whether it would be proper for him to march direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt Darius,
or firſt ſubdue the reſt of the maritime provinces. The latter opinion
appeared the ſafeſt, ſince he thereby would not <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0813600202:173"/> be
moleſted by ſuch nations as he ſhould leave behind him. This progreſs
was a little inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted at firſt. Near Phaſelis, a city ſituated
between Lyſia and Pamphilia, is a defile along the ſea ſhore, which is
always dry at low water, ſo that travellers may paſs it at that time; but
when the ſea riſes, it is all under water. As it was now winter, Alexander,
whom nothing could daunt, was deſirous of paſſing it before the waters
fell. His forces were therefore ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to march a whole day in the water,
which came up to their waſte.</p>
            <p>Alexander after having ſettled affairs in Cili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia and Pamphilia,
marched his army to Coelenae, a city of Phrygia watered by the river
Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyas, which the fictions of Poets have made ſo famous. He ſummoned
the garriſon of the citadel, whither the inhabitants were retired, to
ſurrender; but theſe believing it impregnable, anſwered haughtily, That
they would firſt die. However finding the attack carried on with great
vigour, they deſired a truce of ſixty days, at the expiration of which,
they promiſed to open their gates, in caſe they were not ſuccour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. And
accordingly, no aid arriving, they ſurrendered themſelves upon the day
fixed.</p>
            <p>From thence he marched into Phrygia, the ancient dominion of the
celebrated king Midas; <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0813600202:174"/> having taken the capital city, he
was deſirous of ſeeing the famous chariot to which the Gordian knot was
tied. This knot which faſtened the yoke to the beam, was tied with ſo much
intricacy, that it was impoſſible to diſcover where the ends begun, or
how they were concealed. According to an ancient tradition of the country, an
ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle had foretold that the man who could un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it, ſhould poſſeſs
the empire of Aſia. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander being firmly perſuaded that the oracle was
meant for him, after many fruitleſs trials, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of attempting to untie
it in the uſual manner, drew his ſword and cut it in pieces, crying out,
That that was the only way to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie it. The prieſt hailed the omen, and
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared that Alexander had fulfilled the oracle.</p>
            <p>Darius, who now began to be more alarmed than before, uſed all the
art in his power to raiſe an army, and encourage his forces: he ſent Memnon
into Greece to invade Macedon, in order to make a diverſion of the Grecian
forces; but this general dying upon that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, Darius's hopes vaniſhed
on that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and inſtead of invading the enemy, he was obliged to
conſult for the protection of his empire at home.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Alexander having leſt Gordion, marched into
Paphlogonia and Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia, <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0813600202:175"/> which he ſubdued. It was
there he heard of Memnon's death; the news whereof confirmed him in the
reſolution he had taken, of marching immediately into the provinces of Upper
Aſia. Accordingly he advanced, by haſty marches, into Cilicia, and arrived
in the country called Cyrus's Camp. From thence there is no more than fifty
ſtadia (two leagues and a half each) to the paſs of Cilicia, which is a
very narrow ſtrait, through which travellers are obliged to go from
Cappadocia to Tarſus. The officer who guarded it in Darius's name, had left
but few ſoldiers in it; and thoſe fled the inſtant they heard of the
enemy's arrival. Upon this, Alexander entered the paſs, and after viewing
very attentively the ſituation of the place, admired his own good fortune,
and confeſſed, He might have been very eaſily ſtopped and defeated
there, merely by the throwing of ſtones; for not to mention that this paſs
was ſo narrow, that four men, completely armed, could ſcarcely walk a
breaſt in it; the top of the mountain hung over the road, which was not only
ſtrait, but broke in ſeveral places, by the fall of torrents from the
mountains.</p>
            <p>Alexander marched his whole army to the city of Tarſus, where it
arrived the inſtant <pb n="174" facs="tcp:0813600202:176"/> the Perſians were ſetting fire
to that place, to prevent his plundering the great riches of ſo flouriſhing
a city. But Parmenio, whom the king had ſent thither with a detachment of
horſe, arrived very ſeaſonably to ſtop the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the fire, and
marched into the city, which he ſaved, the barbarians having fled the moment
they heard of his arrival.</p>
            <p>Through this city the Cydnus runs; a river not ſo remarkable for
the breadth of its channel, as for the beauty of its waters, which are vaſtly
limpid; but at the ſame time exceſſively cold, becauſe of the tufted
trees with which its banks are overſhadowed. It was now about the end of the
ſummer, which is exceſſively hot in Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licia, and in the hotteſt part
of the day; when the king, who was quite covered with ſweat and dirt,
arriving on its banks, had a mind to bathe, invited by the beauty and
clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſtream. However the inſtant he plunged into it, he was
ſeized with ſo violent a ſhivering, that all the by-ſtanders fancied he
was dying. Upon this, he was carried to his tent, after fainting away. The
phyſicians, who were ſenſible they ſhould be anſwerable for the
event, did not dare to hazard violent and extraordinary remedies. However,
Philip, one of his phyſicians, who had always attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="175" facs="tcp:0813600202:177"/> upon him from his youth, and loved him with the utmoſt
tenderneſs, not only as his ſovereign, but his child, raiſing himſelf
(merely out of affection to Alexander) above all prudential conſiderations,
offered to give him a doſe, which, though not very violent, would
nevertheleſs be ſpeedy in its effects; and deſired three days to prepare
it. At this propoſal every one trembled, but he only whom it moſt
concerned; Alexander being afflicted upon no other account, than becauſe it
would keep him three days from appearing at the head of his army.</p>
            <p>Whilſt theſe things were doing, Alexander received a letter from
Parmenio, who was left behind in Cappadocia, in whom Alexander put greater
confidence than in any other of his courtiers; the purport of which was, to bid
him beware of Philip his phyſician, for that Darius had bribed him, by the
promiſe of a thouſand talents, and his ſiſter in marriage. This letter
gave him great uneaſineſs; for he was now at full leiſure to weigh all
the reaſons he might have to hope or fear. But the conſidence in a
phyſician whoſe ſincere attachment and fidelity he had proved from his
infancy, ſoon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, and removed all ſuſpicions. He folded up the
letter, and put it under his bolſter, <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0813600202:178"/> without
acquainting his attendants with the contents; in the mean time, his phyſician
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, with a medicine in his hand, and offered the cup to Alexander. The
hero upon this, took the cup from him, and holding out the letter, deſired
the phyſician to read, while he drank off the draught with an intrepid
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, without the leaſt heſitation, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the leaſt
ſuſpicion or uneaſineſs. The phyſician, as he peruſed the letter,
ſhewed greater ſigns of indignation than of fear; he bid him, with a
reſolute tone, harbour no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, and that the recovery of his
health would in a ſhort time wipe off all ſuſpicion. In the mean time,
the phyſic wrought ſo vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, that the ſymptoms ſeemed to
ſtrengthen Parmenio's accuſation; but at laſt, the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine having
gained the aſcendant, he began to aſſume his accuſtomed vigour; and in
about three days, he was able to ſhew himſelf to his longing ſoldiers, by
whom he was equally beloved and reſpected.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Darius was on his march; filled with a vain
ſecurity in the ſuperiority of his numbers; and conſident not in the
valour, but in the ſplendor of his forces. The plains of Aſſyria, in
which he was encamped, gave him an opportunity of extending his horſe as he 
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0813600202:179"/> pleaſed, and of taking the advantage which the great
difference between the number of ſoldiers in each army gave him. But
inſtead of this, he reſolved to march to narrow paſſes, where his
cavalry, and the multitude of his troops, ſo far from doing him any
ſervice, would only incumber each other; and accordingly, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced towards
the enemy, for whom he ſhould have waited; and thus ran viſibly on his
deſtruction.</p>
            <p>His courtiers and attendants however, whoſe cuſtom it was to
flatter and applaud all his actions, congratulated him upon an approaching
victory, as if it had been certain and inevitable. There was at that time, in
the army of Darius, one Caridemus, an Athenian, a man of great experience in
war, who perſonally hated Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, for having cauſed him to be
barliſhed from Athens. Darius turning to this Athenian, aſked whether he
believed him powerful enough to defeat his army. Caridemus, who had been
brought up in the boſom of liberty, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting that he was in a country
of ſlavery, where to oppoſe the inclinations of the prince is of the moſt
dangerous conſequence, replied as follows: 
<q rend="inline">"Permit me, Sir, to ſpeak truth now, when only my
ſincerity may be of ſervice; your preſent ſplendor, your prodigious
num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0813600202:180"/> which have drained the eaſt, may be terrible
indeed to your effeminate neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, but can be no way dreadful to a
Macedonian army. Diſcipline, cloſe combat, courage, is all their care;
every ſingle man among them is almoſt himſelf a general. Theſe men are
not to be repulſed by the ſtones of ſlingers, or ſtakes burnt at the
end; none but troops armed like themſelves can ſtop their career; let
therefore the gold and ſilver which glitters in your camp, be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for
foldiers and ſteel, for weapons and for hearts that are able to defend
you."</q> Darius, though naturally of a mild diſpoſition, had all his
paſſions rouſed at the freedom of this man's advice; he ordered him at
once to be executed; Caridemus all the time crying out, that his avenger was at
hand: Darius too ſoon repented his raſhneſs, and experienced when it was
too late, the truth of all that had been told him.</p>
            <p>The emperor now advanced with his troops towards the river
Euphrates; over his tent was exhibited to the view of his whole army, the image
of the ſun in jewels; while wealth and magnificence ſhone in every quarter
of the army.</p>
            <p>Firſt they carried ſilver altars, on which lay fire, called by
them Sacred and Eternal; <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0813600202:181"/> and theſe were followed by
the Magi, ſinging hymns, after the manner of their country: they were
accompanied by three hundred and ſixty-five youths (equalling the number of
days in a year) cloathed in purple robes. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards came a chariot
conſecrated to Jupiter, drawn by white horſes, and followed by a courſer
of a prodigious ſize, to whom they gave the name of the Sun's Horſe; and
the equeries were dreſſed in white, each having a golden rod in his
hand.</p>
            <p>Ten chariots, adorned with ſculptures in gold and ſilver
followed after. Then marched a body of horſe, compoſed of twelve nations,
whoſe manners and cuſtoms were various, and all armed in a different
manner. Next advanced thoſe whom the Perſians called The Immortals,
amounting to ten thouſand, who ſurpaſſed the reſt of the barbarians
in the ſumptuouſneſs of their apparel. They all wore golden collars, were
cloathed in robes of gold tiſſue, with veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments having ſleeves to
them quite covered with precious ſtones.</p>
            <p>Thirty paces from them followed thoſe called the king's relations,
to the number of fifteen thouſand, in habits very much reſembling thoſe
of women; and more remarkable for the vain pomp of their dreſs, than the
glitter of their arms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0813600202:182"/> Thoſe called the Doriphori came after; they
carried the king's cloak, and walked before his chariot, in which he ſeemed
to ſit, as on a high throne. This chariot was enriched on both ſides with
images of the gods, in gold and ſilver; and from the middle of the yoke,
which was covered with jewels, roſe two ſtatues, a cubit in height, the one
repreſenting War, the other Peace, having a golden eagle between them, with
wings extended, as ready to take its flight.</p>
            <p>But nothing could equal the magnificence of the king: he was
cloathed in a veſt of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſtriped with ſilver, and over it a long
robe, glittering all over with gold and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſtones, that repreſented
two falcons, ruſhing from the clouds, and pecking at one another. Around his
waiſt he wore a golden girdle, after the manner of women, whence his
ſcymitar hung, the ſcabbard of which flamed all over with gems; on his head
he wore a tiara, or mitre, round which was a fillet of blue mixed with
white.</p>
            <p>On each ſide of him walked two hundred of his neareſt relations,
followed by two thouſand pike-men, whoſe pikes were adorned with ſilver,
and tipped with gold; and laſtly, thirty thouſand infantry, who compoſed
the rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard. <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0813600202:183"/> Theſe were followed by the king's
horſes four hundred in number, all which were led.</p>
            <p>About one hundred, or an hundred and twenty paces from thence, came
Syſigambis, Darius's mother, ſeated on a chariot, and his confort on
another; with the ſeveral female attendants of both queens, riding on
horſeback. Afterwards came fifteen large chariots, in which were the king's
children, and thoſe who had the care of their education, with a band of
eunuchs, who are to this day in great eſteem among thoſe nations. Then
marched the concubines, to the number of three hundred and ſixty, in the
equipage of queens, followed by ſix hundred mules, and three hundred camels,
which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the king's treaſure, and guarded by a great body of
archers.</p>
            <p>After theſe came the wives of the crown-officers, and of the
greateſt lords of the court; then the ſutlers, and ſervants of the army,
ſeated alſo in chariots.</p>
            <p>In the rear were a body of light-armed troops, with their
commanders, who cloſed the whole march.</p>
            <p>Such was the ſplendor of this pageant mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch; he took the field
encumbered with an unneceſſary train of concubines, attended with 
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0813600202:184"/> troops of various nations, ſpeaking different
lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, for their numbers impoſſible to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhalled, and ſo rich
and effeminate in gold and in garments, as ſeemed rather to invite than deter
an invader.</p>
            <p>Alexander, after marching from Tarſis, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Bactriana; from
thence, ſtill earneſt in coming up with his enemy, he came to Solae, where
he offered ſacrifice to Eſculapius; from thence he went forward to Pyramus,
to Malles, and at laſt to Cartabala: it was here that he firſt received
advice, that Darius, with his whole army, was encamped at Sochus in
Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria, two days journey from Cilicia. He therefore reſolved, without
delay, to meet him there, as the badneſs of the weather ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to
halt.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Darius led on his immenſe army into the plains of
Aſſyria, which they co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to a great extent; there he was adviſed by
the Grecian commanders who were in his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and who compoſed the
ſtrength of his army to halt, as he would there have ſufficient room to
expand his forces, and ſurround the invader. Darius rejected their advice;
and inſtead of waiting Alexander's approach, vainly puffed up with pride by
his ſurrounding courtiers, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to purſue the invader, who
wiſhed for <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0813600202:185"/> nothing more ardently than to come to an
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>
            <p>Accordingly, Darius having ſent his treaſures to Damaſcus, a
city of Aſſyria, he marched with the main body of his army towards Cilicia,
then turned ſhort towards Iſſus; and quite ignorant of the ſituation of
the enemy, ſuppoſed he was purſuing Alexander, when he had actually left
him in the rear. There is a ſtrange mixture of pride, cruelty, ſplendor and
magnanimity, in all the actions of this Perſian prince. At Iſſus he
barbarouſly put to death all the Greeks who were ſick in that city, a few
ſoldiers only excepted, whom he diſmiſſed, after having made them view
every part of his camp, in order to report his numbers and his ſtrength to
the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader: theſe ſoldiers accordingly brought Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander word of the
approach of Darius; and he now began to think ſeriouſly of preparing for
battle.</p>
            <p>Alexander fearing, from the numbers of the enemy, that they would
attack him in his camp, fortified it with a ditch and a rampart; but at the
ſame time diſcovered great joy to ſee the enemy haſtening to its own
deſtruction, and preparing to attack him in a place which was but wide enough
for a ſmall army to act and move at liberty in. Thus the two armies were 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0813600202:186"/> in ſome meaſure reduced to an equality: the
Macedonians had ſpace ſufficient to employ their whole force, while the
Perſians had not room for the twentieth part of theirs.</p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs, Alexander, as frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens to the greateſt
captains, felt ſome emotion when he ſaw that he was going to hazard all at
one blow. The more Fortune had favoured him hitherto, the more he now dreaded
her frowns; the moment approaching which was to determine his fate. But, on the
other ſide, his courage revived, from the reflection, that the rewards of his
toils exceeded the dangers of them; and though he was uncertain with regard to
the victory, he at leaſt hoped to die gloriouſly, and like Alexander.
However, he did not divulge theſe thoughts to any one; well knowing, that,
upon the approach of a battle, a general ought not to diſcover the leaſt
marks of ſadneſs or perplexity; and that the troops ſhould read nothing
but reſolution and intrepidity in the countenance of their commander.</p>
            <p>Having made his ſoldiers refreſh themſelves, and ordered them
to be ready for the third watch of the night, which began at twelve, he went to
the top of a mountain, and there, by torch-light, ſacrificed, after the
manner of his country, to the gods of the place. As ſoon as 
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0813600202:187"/> the ſignal was given, his army, which was ready to
march and fight, being commanded to make great ſpeed, arrived by day-break at
the ſeveral poſts aſſigned them. But now the ſpies bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing word
that Darius was not above thirty furlongs from them, the king cauſed his army
to halt, and then drew it up in battle array. The peaſants, in the greateſt
terror, came alſo, and acquainted Darius with the arrival of the enemy; which
he would not at firſt believe, imagining, as we have obſerved, that
Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander fled before him, and was endeavouring to eſcape. This news threw
his troops into the utmoſt confuſion; who, in their ſurpriſe, ran to
their arms with great precipitation and diſorder.</p>
            <p>The ſpot where the battle was fought, lay near the city of
Iſſus, which the mountains bounded on one ſide, and the ſea on the
other. The plain that was ſituated between them both muſt have been
conſiderably broad, as the two armies encamped in it; and I before
obſerved, that Darius's army was vaſtly numerous. The river Pinarius, ran
through the middle of this plain from the mountain to the ſea, and divided it
very near into two equal parts. The mountain formed a hollow kind of gulph, the
extremity of which in a curved line, bounded part of the plain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0813600202:188"/> Alexander drew up his army in the following
order. He poſted at the extremity of the right wing, which ſtood near the
mountains, the Argyraſpides, commanded by Nicanor; then the phalanx of
Coenus, and afterwards that of Perdicas, which terminated in the center of the
main army. On the extremity of the left wing, he poſted the phalanx of
Amyntas, then that of Ptolemy, and laſtly that of Meleager. Thus the famous
Macedonian phalanx was formed, which we find was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of ſix
diſtinct bodies. Each of thoſe was headed by able generals; but Alexander
being always generaliſſimo, had conſequently the command of the whole
army. The horſe were placed on the two wings; the Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians with the
Theſſalians on the right, and of Peloponneſians, with the other allies on
the left. Craterus commanded all the foot, which compoſed the left wing, and
Parmenio the whole wing. Alexander had reſerved to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the command of
the right. He had deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Parmenio to keep as near the ſea as
poſſible, to prevent the barbarians from ſurrounding him; and Nicanor on
the contrary, was ordered to keep at ſome diſtance from the mountains, to
keep himſelf out of the reach of the arrows diſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>charged by thoſe who were
poſted on them. He <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0813600202:189"/> covered the horſe on his right
wing with the light horſe of Protomachus and the Poeonians, and his foot with
the bowmen of Antiochus. He reſerved the Agrians (commanded by At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talus,) who
were greatly eſteemed, and ſome forces that were newly arrived from Greece,
to oppoſe thoſe Darius had poſted on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
            <p>As for Darius's army, it was drawn up in the following order. Having
heard that Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander was marching towards him in battle array, he commanded
thirty thouſand horſe, and twenty thouſand bowmen to croſs the river
Pinarius, that he might have an opportunity to draw up his army in a commodious
manner on the hither ſide. In the center he poſted the thirty thouſand
Greeks in his ſervice, who doubtleſs were the flower and chief ſtrength
of his army, and were not at all inferior in bravery to the Macedonian phalanx,
with thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Barbarians on their right, and as many on their left.
The field of battle not being able to contain a greater number, theſe were
all heavily armed. The reſt of the infantry diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by their
ſeveral nations, were ranged behind the firſt line. It is pity Arrian does
not tell us the depth of each of thoſe two lines; but it muſt have been
prodigious, if we conſider <pb n="188" facs="tcp:0813600202:190"/> the extreme narrowneſs of
the paſs, and the amazing multitude of the Perſian forces. On the mountain
which lay to their left, againſt Alexander's right wing, Darius poſted
twenty thouſand men, who were ſo ranged (in the ſeveral windings of the
mountain) that ſome were behind Alexander's army, and others be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</p>
            <p>Darius, after having ſet his army in battle array, made his
horſe croſs the river again, and diſpatched the greateſt part of them
towards the ſea againſt Parmenio, becauſe they could fight on that ſpot
with the greateſt advantage. The reſt of his cavalry he ſent to the left,
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the mountain. However, finding that theſe would be of no ſervice
on that ſide, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the too great narrowneſs of the ſpot, he
cauſed a great part of them to wheel about to the right. As for himſelf he
took his poſt in the center of his army, purſuant to the cuſtom of the
Perſian monarchs.</p>
            <p>The two armies being thus drawn up in order of battle, Alexander
marched very ſlowly, that his ſoldiers might take a little breath; ſo
that it was ſuppoſed they would not engage till very late. For Darius
ſtill continued with his army on the other ſide of the river, in order not
to loſe the advantageous ſituation of his poſt; <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0813600202:191"/>
and even cauſed ſuch parts of the ſhore as were not craggy to be
ſecured with paliſadoes, where the Macedonians concluded that he was
already afraid of being defeated. The two armies being come in ſight,
Alexander riding along the ranks, called by their ſeveral names, the
principal officers both of the Macedonians and foreigners; and exhorted the
ſoldiers to ſignalize themſelves, ſpeaking to each nation according to
its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar genius and diſpoſition. The whole army ſet up a ſhout and
eagerly deſired to be led on directly againſt the enemy.</p>
            <p>Alexander had advanced at firſt very ſlowly to prevent the ranks
on the front of his phalanx from breaking, and halted by intervals. But when he
was got within bow-ſhot, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded all his right wing to plunge
impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly into the river, purpoſely that he might ſurprize the
barbarians, come ſooner to a cloſe engagement, and be leſs expoſed to
the enemy's arrows; in all which he was very ſucceſsful. Both ſides
fought with the utmoſt bravery and reſolution; and being now forced to
fight cloſe, they charged both ſides ſword in hand, when a dreadful
ſlaughter enſued, for they engaged man to man, each aiming the point of his
ſword at the face of his opponent. Alexander who performed the duty both of a
private ſoldier <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0813600202:192"/> and of a commander, wiſhed nothing
ſo ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently as the glory of killing with his own hand Darius, who being
ſeated on a high cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot, was conſpicuous to the whole army; and by that
means was a powerful object both to encourage his own ſoldiers to defend, and
the enemy to attack him. And now the battle grew more furious and bloody than
before, ſo that a great number of Perſian noblemen were killed. Each ſide
fought with incredible bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very. Oxathres, brother to Darius, obſerving that
Alexander was going to charge that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch with the utmoſt vigour, ruſhed
before his chariot with the horſe under his command and diſtinguiſhed
himſelf above the reſt. The horſes that drew Darius's chariot loſt all
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and ſhook the yoke ſo violently, that they were upon the point of
overturning the king, who ſeeing himſelf going to fall alive into the hands
of his enemies, leaped down and mounted another chariot. The reſt obſerving
this fled as faſt as poſſible, and throwing down their arms, made the
beſt of their way. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander had received a ſlight wound in his thigh, but
happily it was not attended with ill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences. Whilſt part of the
Macedonian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry (poſted to the right,) were driving the advantages they
had gained againſt the Perſians, <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0813600202:193"/> the remainder of
them who engaged the Greeks, met with greater reſiſtance. Theſe
obſerving that the body of infantry in queſtion, were no longer covered by
the right wing of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander's army, which was purſuing the enemy, came and
attacked it in flank. The engagement was very bloody, and victory a long time
doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The Greeks endeavoured to puſh the Macedonians into the river, and
to recover the diſorder into which the left wing had been thrown. The
Macedonians alſo ſignalized them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the utmoſt bravery, in
order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the advantage which Alexander had juſt before gained and
ſupport the honour of their phalanx, which had always been conſidered as
invincible. There was alſo a perpetual jealouſy between the Greeks and
Macedonians, which greatly increaſed their courage, and made the
reſiſtance on each ſide very vigorous. On Alexander's ſide Ptolemy the
ſon of Seleucus, loſt his life with an hundred and twenty more
conſiderable officers, who all had behaved with the utmoſt gallantry.</p>
            <p>In the mean time the right wing, which was victorious under its
Monarch, after defeating all who oppoſed it, wheeled to the left againſt
thoſe Greeks who were fighting with the reſt of the Macedonian phalanx,
whom they <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0813600202:194"/> charged very vigorouſly; and attacking them
in flank entirely routed them.</p>
            <p>At the very beginning of the engagement the Perſian cavalry, which
was in the right wing (without waiting for their being attacked by the
Macedonians) had croſſed the river and ruſhed upon the Theſſalian
horſe, ſeveral of whoſe ſquadrons they broke. Upon this the remainder
of the latter, in order to avoid the impetuoſity of the firſt charge, and
oblige the Perſians to break their ranks, made a feint of retiring, as
terrified by the prodigious numbers of the enemy. The Perſians ſeeing this,
were filled with boldneſs and confidence; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, the greateſt part
of them advancing, without order or precaution, as to a certain victory had no
thoughts but of purſuing the enemy. Upon this the Theſſalians ſeeing
them in ſuch confuſion, faced about on a ſudden and renewed the fight
with freſh ardour. The Perſians made a brave defence, till they ſaw
Darius put to flight, and the Greeks cut to pieces by the phalanx, when they
fled in the utmoſt diſorder.</p>
            <p>With regard to Darius, the inſtant he ſaw his left wing broke,
he was one of the firſt who fled in his chariot; but get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting afterwards into
craggy rugged places, <pb n="193" facs="tcp:0813600202:195"/> he mounted on horſeback,
throwing down his bow, ſhield and royal mantle. Alexander, however did not
attempt to purſue him, till he ſaw his phalanx had conquered the Greeks,
and the Perſian horſe put to flight; which was of great advantage to the
prince that fled.</p>
            <p>Syſigambis, Darius's mother, and that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch's queen, who alſo
was his ſiſter, were found remaining in the camp, with two of the king's
daughters, his ſon (yet a child) and ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian ladies; for the reſt
had been carried to Damaſcus, with part of Darius's treaſure, and all
ſuch things as contributed only to the luxury and magnificence of his court.
No more than three thouſand talents were found in his camp; but the reſt of
the treaſure fell after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards into the hands of Parmenio, at the taking the
city of Damaſcus.</p>
            <p>As for the barbarians, having exerted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with bravery
enough in the firſt attack, they afterwards gave way in the moſt ſhameful
manner; and being intent upon nothing but ſaving themſelves, they took
different ways. Some ſtruck into the high road, which led directly to
Perſia; others ran into woods and lonely mountains; and a ſmall number
return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their camp, which the victorious enemy had already taken and
plundered. In this battle <pb n="194" facs="tcp:0813600202:196"/> threeſcore thouſand of the
Perſian infantry and ten thouſand horſemen were ſlain; forty
thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were taken priſoners, while of Alexander's army there fell but
two hundred and fourſcore men in all.</p>
            <p>The evening after the engagement, Alexander invited his chief
officers to a feaſt, at which he himſelf preſided, notwithſtanding he
had been wounded that day in battle. The feſtivity how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever had ſcarce
begun, when they were inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by ſad lamentations from a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
tent, which at firſt they conſidered as a freſh alarm, but they were
ſoon taught, that it came from the tent, in which the wife and mother of
Darius were kept, who were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing their ſorrow for the ſuppoſed
death of Darius. An eunuch, who had ſeen his cloak in the hands of a
ſoldier, imagining he was killed, brought them theſe dreadful tidings.
Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, however ſent one of his officers to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceive them, and to
inform them that the emperor was ſtill alive. The women little uſed to the
appearance of ſtrangers, upon the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of the Macedonian ſoldier,
imagining he was ſent to put them to death, threw themſelves at his feet,
and intreated him to ſpare them a little while. They were ready they ſaid
to die; and only deſired to bury Darius, before <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0813600202:197"/> they
ſhould ſuffer. The ſoldier aſſured them, that he came rather to
comfort than afflict them, that the monarch whom they deplored, was ſtill
living, and he gave Syſigambis his hand to raiſe her from the ground.</p>
            <p>The next day Alexander, after viſiting the wounded, cauſed the
laſt honours to be paid to the dead in preſence of the whole army, drawn up
in the moſt ſplendid order of battle. He treated the Perſians of
diſtinction in the ſame manner, and permitted Darius's mother, to bury
whatever perſons ſhe pleaſed according to the cuſtoms, and ceremonies
practiſed in her country. After this, he ſent a meſſage to the queens,
to inform them, that he was coming to pay them a viſit; and accordingly,
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding all his train to withdraw, he entered the tent accompanied only by
Hephoeſtion, who made ſo cautious and diſcreet a uſe of the liberty
granted him, that he ſeemed to take it not ſo much out of inclination, as
from a deſire to obey the king who would have it ſo. They were of the
ſame age, but Hephoeſtion was taller, ſo that the queens took him firſt
for the king, and paid him their reſpects as ſuch. But ſome captive
eunuchs ſhewing them Alexander, Syſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gambis fell proſtrate before him,
and intreated pardon for her miſtake, but the king raiſing 
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0813600202:198"/> her from the ground, aſſured her this his friend
alſo was another Alexander; and after com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting her and her attendants,
took the ſon of Darius that was yet but a child in his arms. The infant,
without diſcovering the leaſt terror, ſtretched out his arms to the
conqueror, who being affected with its confidence, ſaid to Hephoeſtion, Oh!
that Darius had ſome ſhare, ſome portion of this infant's
generoſity.—This interview has done more honour to Alexander's
character, than all the reſt of: his conqueſts: the gentleneſs of his
manners to the ſuppliant captives, his chaſtity and continence, when he had
the power to enforce obedience, were ſetting an example to heroes, which it
has been the pride of many ſince to imitate.</p>
            <p>After this overthrow, all Phoenicia, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital city of Tyre only
excepted, was yielded to the conqueror, and Parmenio was made gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. Good
fortune followed him ſo faſt, that it rewarded him beyond his expectations.
An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigonus his general in Aſia, overthrew the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocians, Paphlagonians,
and others lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted. Ariſtodemus the Perſian admiral, was overcome
at ſea, and a great part of his fleet taken. The city of Damaſcus alſo,
in which the treaſures of Darius were depoſited, was given up to Alexander.
The governor of this <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0813600202:199"/> place forgetting the duty he owed
his ſovereign, informed Alexander by letter upon a certain day, that he would
lead out his ſoldiers laden with ſpoil from the city, as if willing to
ſecure a retreat; and theſe with all their wealth might be taken with a
proper body of troops to intercept them. Alexander punctually followed the
go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor's inſtruction, and thus became poſſeſſed of an immenſe
plunder. Beſides money and plate which was afterwards coined, and amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to immenſe ſums, thirty thouſand men and ſeven thouſand beaſts
laden with baggage were taken. We find by Parmenio's letter to Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, that
he found in Damaſcus, three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty nine of Darius's concubines
all admirably well ſkilled in muſic, and alſo a multitude of officers,
whoſe buſineſs it was to regulate and prepare every thing relating to
that monarch's entertainments.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Darius having travelled on horſeback the whole
night, ſtruck with terror and conſternation, arrived in the morning at
Sochus, where he aſſembled the remains of his army: ſtill however his
pride would not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake him with his fortune; he wrote a letter to
Alexander, in which he rather treated him as an inferior; he commanded, rather
than re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted that Alexander would take a ranſom <pb n="198" facs="tcp:0813600202:200"/>
for his mother, wife and children. With re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the empire, he would fight
with him for it upon equal terms; and bring an equal number of troops into the
field. To this Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander replied, That he diſdained all correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
with a man whom he had already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; that in caſe he appeared before him
in a ſupplicating poſture, he would give up his wife and mother without
ranſom; that he knew how to conquer, and to oblige the conquered.</p>
            <p>Thus coming to no iſſue, the king marched from thence into
Phoenicia, the citizens of Byblos opening their gates to him. Every one
ſubmitted as he advanced, but no people did this with greater pleaſure than
the Sidonians: We have ſeen in what manner Ochus had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed their city
eighteen years before, and put all the inhabitants of it to the ſword. After
he was returned into Perſia, ſuch of the citizens, as, upon account of
their traffic or for ſome other cauſe, had been abſent, and by that means
had eſcaped the maſſacre, returned thither and rebuilt their city. But
they had retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo violent a hatred to the Perſians, that they were
overjoyed at this opportunity of throwing off their yoke; and indeed they were
the firſt in that country who ſubmitted to the king by their deputies, in
oppoſition to Strato their <pb n="199" facs="tcp:0813600202:201"/> king, who had declared in
favour of Darius. Alexander dethroned him, and permitted He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoeſtion to
elect in his ſtead, whomſoever of the Sidonians he ſhould judge worthy of
ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted a ſtation.</p>
            <p>This favourite was quartered at the houſe of two brothers who were
young, and of the moſt conſiderable family in the city; to theſe he
of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the crown. But they refuſed it, telling him that according to the
laws of their country, no perſon could aſcend the throne unleſs he were
of the blood royal. Hephoeſtion admiring this greatneſs of ſoul, which
could contemn what others ſtrive to obtain by fire and ſword; 
<q rend="inline">"Continue, ſays he to them, in this way of
thinking, you who before were ſenſible that it is much more glorious to
refuſe a diadem, than to accept it. However, name me ſome perſon of the
royal family, who may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber when he is king, that it was you ſet the
crown on his head."</q> The brothers obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſeveral through
exceſſive ambition; aſpired to this high ſtation, and to obtain it,
paid a ſervile court to Alexander's favourites, declared, that they did not
know any perſon more worthy of the diadem than one Abdolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymus, deſcended,
though at a great diſtance, from the royal line; but who, at the ſame time 
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0813600202:202"/> was ſo poor that he was obliged to get his bread by
day labour in a garden without the city. His honeſty and integrity had
reduced him, as well as many more, to ſuch extreme poverty. Solely intent
upon his labour, he did not hear the claſhing of the arms which had ſhaken
all Aſia.</p>
            <p>Immediately the two brothers went in ſearch of Abdolonymus, with
the royal garments, and found him weeding in his garden. When they ſaluted
him king, Abdolonymus looked upon the whole as a dream; and, unable to gueſs
the meaning of it, aſked if they were not aſhamed to ridicule him in that
manner? But as he made a greater reſiſtance than ſuited their
incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, they themſelves waſhed him, and threw over his ſhoulders a
purple robe, richly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered with gold; then after repeated oaths of their
being in earneſt, they conducted him to the palace.</p>
            <p>The news of this was immediately ſpread over the whole city.
Moſt of the inhabitants were overjoyed at it, but ſome murmured,
eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the rich, who deſpiſing Abdolonymus's former abject ſtate,
could not forbear ſhewing their reſentment upon that account in the king's
court. Alexander commanded the new-elected prince to be ſent for, and after
ſurveying him <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0813600202:203"/> attentively a long time, he ſpoke
thus: 
<q rend="inline">"Thy air and mien do not contradict what is related
of thy extraction; but I ſhould be glad to know with what frame of mind thou
didſt bear thy poverty?"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"Would to the gods (replied he) that I may bear this
crown with equal patience. Theſe hands have procured me all I deſired; and
whilſt I poſſeſſed nothing, I wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing."</q> This anſwer
gave Alexander an high idea of Abdolonymus's virtue; ſo that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
him, not only with the rich furniture which had belonged to Strato, and part of
the Perſian plunder, but likewiſe annexed one of the neighbouring provinces
to his dominions.</p>
            <p>Syria and Phoenicia, were already ſubdued by the Macedonians, the
city of Tyre except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This city was juſtly entitled the Queen of the Sea,
that element bringing to it the tribute of all nations. She boaſted her
having firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented navigation, and taught mankind the art of braving the
winds and waves by the aſſiſtance of a frail bark. The happy ſituation
of Tyre, the conveniency and extent of its ports, the character of its
inhabitants, who were induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, laborious, patient, and extremely
cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous to ſtrangers; invited thither merchants from all parts of the
globe, ſo that it might be conſidered, not ſo much as a city belonging to
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0813600202:204"/> any particular nation, as the common city of all
nations, and the center of their commerce.</p>
            <p>Alexander thought it neceſſary both for his pride and his
intereſt to take this city. The ſpring was now coming on. Tyre was at that
time ſeated in an iſland of the ſea, about a quarter of a league from the
continent. It was ſurrounded with a ſtrong wall, an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty feet
high, which the waves of the ſea waſhed, and the Carthaginians (a colony
from Tyre) a mighty people, and ſovereigns of the ocean, whoſe
ambaſſadors were at that time in the city offering to Hercules, according
to ancient cuſtom, an annual ſacrifice, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged themſelves to
ſuccour the Tyrians. It was this made them ſo haughty; firmly deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
not to ſurrender, they fix machines on the ramparts and on the towers, arm
their young men, and build workhouſes for the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, of whom there were
great numbers in the city, ſo that every part reſounded with the noiſe of
warlike preparations. They likewiſe caſt iron grapples to throw on the
enemy's works, and tear them away; as alſo cramp irons, and ſuch like
inſtruments formed for the defence of cities. So many difficulties oppoſing
ſuch a hazardous deſign, and ſo many reaſons ſhould have made
Alexander decline the ſiege.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:0813600202:205"/> It was impoſſible to come near this city
in order to ſtorm it, without making a bank, which would reach from the
continent to the iſland; and an attempt of this kind would be attended with
difficulties, that were ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly inſurmountable. The little arm of the
ſea, which ſeparated the iſland from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, was expoſed to the
weſt wind, which often raiſed ſuch dreadful ſtorms there, that the
waves would in an inſtant, ſweep away all works. Beſides, as the city was
ſurrounded on all ſides by the ſea, there was no fixing ſcaling
ladders, nor throwing up batteries, but at a diſtance in the ſhips; and the
wall which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected into the ſea towards the lower part, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented people
from landing; not to mention that the military engines, which might have been
put on board the gallies, could not do much execution, the waves were ſo very
tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>multuous.</p>
            <p>Theſe obſtacles however by no means retard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the enterprizing
reſolutions of Alexander, but willing to gain a place, rather by treaty than
by the ſword, he ſent heralds into the place, propoſing a peace, between
the Tyrians and him. The citizens however, a tumultuous un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable body,
inſtead of liſtening to his propoſals, inſtead of endeavouring to avert
his <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0813600202:206"/> reſentment, contrary to the law of nations, killed
his heralds, and threw them from the top of the walls into the ſea. This
outrage inflamed Alexander's paſſions to the higheſt degree, he
reſolved upon the city's deſtruction, and ſat down before it with
perſevering reſentment. His firſt endeavour was to form a pier jutting
from the continent, and reaching to the city which was built upon an iſland.
From the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of an ancient city upon the ſhore, he dug ſtones and
rubbiſh; from mount Lebanus, that hung over the city, he cut down cedars that
ſerved for piles; and thus he began his work without interruption. But the
farther they went from ſhore, the greater difficulties they met with,
becauſe the ſea was deeper, and the workmen were much annoyed by the darts
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the top of the walls. The enemy alſo who were maſters at
ſea, coming in great boats, prevented the Macedonians from carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their
work with vigour. At laſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the pile appeared above water, a level of
conſiderable breadth: then the beſieged at laſt perceived their
raſhneſs; they ſaw with terror the vaſtneſs of the work which the
ſea had till then kept from their ſight, and now began to attack the
workmen with javelins and wound them at a diſtance. It was therefore 
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0813600202:207"/> reſolved that ſkins and ſails ſhould be ſpread
to cover the workmen, and that two wooden towers ſhould be raiſed at the
head of the bank to prevent the approaches of the enemy. Yet theſe were
burned ſoon after by the beſieged, together with all the wood-work
compoſing the pile that could be touched by the fire.</p>
            <p>Alexander though he ſaw moſt of his deſigns defeated, and his
works demoliſhed, was not at all dejected upon that account. His ſoldiers
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured with redoubled vigour, to repair the ruins of the bank; and made
and planted new machines, with ſuch prodigious ſpeed as quite
aſtoniſhed the enemy. Alexander himſelf was preſent on all occaſions,
and ſuperintended every part of the works. His preſence and great
abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities advanced theſe ſtill more, than the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of hands employed
in them. The whole was near finiſhed, and brought almoſt to the wall of the
city, when there aroſe on a ſudden an impetuous wind, which drove the waves
with ſo much fury againſt the mole, that the cement and other things that
barr'd it, gave way, and the water ruſhing through the ſtones, broke it in
the middle. As ſoon as the great heap of ſtones which ſupported the earth
was thrown down, the whole ſunk at once as into an abyſs.</p>
            <p>Any warrior but Alexander would that inſtant have quite laid
aſide his enterprize; and indeed <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0813600202:208"/> he himſelf debated
whether he ſhould not raiſe the ſiege. But a ſuperior Power, who had
foretold and ſworn the ruin of Tyre, and whoſe orders this prince only
executed, prompted him to continue the ſiege; and, diſpelling all his fear
and anxiety, inſpired him with courage and confidence, and fired the
breaſts of his whole army with the ſame ſentiments. For now the
ſoldiers, as if but that moment arrived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the city, forgetting all the
toils they had undergone, began to raiſe a new mole, at which they worked
inceſſantly.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Alexander being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that while the enemy
remained maſters at ſea, the city could not be taken, with great diligence
procured a fleet from various parts, and embarking himſelf, with ſome
ſoldiers from among his guard, he ſet ſail towards the Tyrian fleet,
forming a line of battle. The Tyrians were at firſt determined to oppoſe
him openly; but perceiving the ſuperiority of his forces, they kept all the
gallies in their harbour, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the enemy from entering there. Alexander
therefore was contented to draw up his ſhips near the bank along the ſhore,
where they rode in ſafety, and kept the enemy from annoying his workmen, who
were employed upon the bank.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0813600202:209"/> The beſiegers, thus protected, went on with
great vigour. The workmen threw into the ſea whole trees, with all their
branches on them; and laid great ſtones over theſe, on which they put other
trees, and the latter they covered with clay, which ſerved inſtead of
mortar. Afterwards, heaping more trees and ſtones on theſe, the whole, thus
joined together, formed one entire body. This bank was made wider than the
former ones; in order that the towers that were built in the middle, might be
out of the reach of ſuch arrows as ſhould be ſhot from thoſe ſhips
which might attempt to break down the edges of the bank. Thus, after many
delays, the patience of the workmen ſurmounting every obſtacle, it was at
laſt finiſhed in its utmoſt perfection. The Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians placed military
engines of all kinds on the bank, in order to ſhake the walls with
battering-rams, and hurl on the beſieged ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, ſtones, and burning
torches. Thus, by degrees, approaching to the foot of the wall, the Tyrians
were attacked in cloſe combat, and inveſted on all ſides, both by ſea
and land.</p>
            <p>A general attack was now therefore thought neceſſary; and the
king manning his gallies, which he had joined to each other, ordered them to
approach the walls about midnight, <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0813600202:210"/> and attack the city
with reſolution. The Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians now gave themſelves over for loſt; when on
a ſudden the ſky was overſpread with ſuch thick clouds, as quite took
away the faint glimmerings of light which before darted through the gloom; the
ſea roſe by inſenſible degrees, and the billows being ſwelled by the
fury of the winds, encreaſed to a dreadful ſtorm; the veſſels daſhed
one againſt the other with ſo much violence, that the cables, which before
faſtened them together, were either looſened or broke to pieces; the planks
ſplit, and making a horrible craſh, carried off the ſoldiers with them;
for the tempeſt was ſo furious, that it was not poſſible to manage or
ſteer the gallies thus faſtened together. At laſt, however, they brought
them near the ſhore, but the greateſt part were in aſhattered
condition.</p>
            <p>This good fortune of the Tyrians was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbalanced by an
unexpected calamity; they had long expected ſuccours from Carthage, a
flouriſhing colony of their own, but they now received advice from thence
that the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians were abſolutely unable to give them any
aſſiſtance; being over-awed themſelves by a powerful army of
Syracuſans, who were laying waſte their country. The Tyrians therefore,
fruſtrated in their hopes, ſtill maintained their <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0813600202:211"/>
reſolution of defending themſelves to the laſt extremity; and accordingly
ſent off their women and children to Carthage, as being of no uſe in the
defence of their city.</p>
            <p>And now the engines playing, the city was warmly attacked on all
ſides, and as vigorouſly defended. The beſieged, taught and animated by
imminent danger, and the extreme neceſſity to which they were reduced,
invented daily new arts, to defend themſelves, and repulſe the enemy. They
warded off all the darts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the baliſtas againſt them, by
the aſſiſtance of turning-wheels, which either broke them to pieces, or
carried them another way. They deadened the violence of the ſtones that were
hurled at them, by ſetting up a kind of ſails and curtains, made of a
ſoft ſubſtance, which eaſily gave way. To annoy the ſhips which
advanced againſt their walls, they fixed grappling irons and ſcythes to
joiſts or beams; then ſtraining their catapultas (an enormous kind of
croſs-bow), they laid thoſe great pieces of timber upon them inſtead of
arrows, and ſhot them off on a ſudden at the enemy: theſe cruſhed
ſome to pieces by their great weight; and the hooks, or penſile ſcythes,
with which they were armed, tore others to pieces, and did conſiderable
damage to their ſhips. They alſo <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0813600202:212"/> had brazen
ſhields, which they drew red-hot out of the fire; and, filling theſe with
burning ſand, hurled them in an inſtant from the top of the wall upon the
enemy. There was nothing the Macedonians ſo much dreaded as this laſt
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention; for, the moment this burning ſand got to the fleſh, through the
crevices in the armour, it pierced to the very bone, and ſtuck ſo cloſe
that there was no pulling it off; ſo that the ſoldiers throwing down their
arms, and tearing their cloaths to pieces, were in this manner ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
naked and defenceleſs, to the ſhot of the enemy. It was now thought that
Alexander, quite diſcouraged with his loſs, was determined to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh
the ſiege; but he reſolved to make a laſt effort, with a great number of
ſhips, which he manned with the flower of his army. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, a ſecond
naval engagement was fought; in which the Tyrians, after fighting with
intrepidity, were obliged to draw off their whole fleet towards the city. The
king purſued their rear very cloſe, but was not able to enter the harbour,
being repulſed by arrows ſhot from the walls: however, he either took or
ſunk a great number of their ſhips.</p>
            <p>Both the attack and defence were now more vigorous than ever. The
courage of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batants increaſed with the danger; and each 
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0813600202:213"/> ſide, animated by the moſt powerful motives, fought
like lions. Wherever the battering-rams had beat down any part of the wall, and
the bridges were thrown out, inſtantly the Argy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſpides mounted the breach
with the utmoſt valour, being headed by Admetus, one of the braveſt
officers in the army, who was killed by the thruſt of a ſpear, as he was
encouraging his ſoldiers. The preſence of the king, and eſpecially the
example he ſet, fired his troops with unuſual bravery. He himſelf
aſcended one of the towers, which was of a prodigious height, and there was
expoſed to the greateſt dangers his courage had ever made him hazard; for
being immediately known, by his inſignia, and the richneſs of his armour,
he ſerved as a mark for all the arrows of the enemy. On this occaſion he
performed wonders; killing with javelins ſeveral of thoſe who defended the
wall; then advancing nearer to them, he forced ſome with his ſword, and
others with his ſhield, either into the city or the ſea; the tower where he
fought almoſt touching the wall. He ſoon aſcended the wall, by the
aſſiſtance of floating bridges; and, followed by the principal officers,
poſſeſſed himſelf of two towers, and the ſpace between them. The
battering-rams had already made ſeveral breaches; the fleet had forced into
the <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0813600202:214"/> harbour; and ſome of the Macedonians had
poſſeſſed themſelves of the towers which were abandoned. The Tyrians
ſeeing the enemy maſter of their rampart, retired towards an open place,
called Agenor, and there ſtood their ground; but Alexander marching up with
his regiment of body-guards, killed part of them, and obliged the reſt to
fly. At the ſame time Tyre being taken on that ſide which lay towards the
harbour, the Macedonians ran up and down every part of the city, ſparing no
perſon who came in their way, being highly exaſperated at the long
reſiſtance of the beſieged, and the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barities they had exerciſed
towards ſome of their comrades, who had been taken in their return to Sidon,
and thrown from the battle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, after their throats had been cut, in the
ſight of the whole army. The Tyrians, thus reduced to the laſt extremity,
ſhut themſelves up in their houſes, to avoid the ſword of the
conqueror; others ruſhed into the midſt of the enemy, to ſell their lives
as dearly as they could; and ſome threw ſtones from the tops of the
houſes, to cruſh the ſailors below: the old men waited at their doors,
expecting every inſtant to be ſacrificed, from the rage of the ſoldiers.
In this general carnage, the Sidonian ſoldiers alone, that were in
Alexander's army, ſeemed <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0813600202:215"/> touched with pity for the
fate of their wretched inhabitants: they gave protection to many of the
Tyrians, whom they conſidered as country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and carried great numbers of
them pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately on board their ſhips. The numbers that were thus
ſlaughtered by the enraged ſoldiers, were incredible: even after
conqueſt, the victor's reſentment did not ſubſide; he ordered no leſs
than two thouſand men, that were taken in the ſtorm, to be nailed to
croſſes along the ſhore. The number of priſoners amounted to thirty
thouſand, and were all ſold as ſlaves, in different parts of the world.
Thus fell Tyre, that had been for many ages the moſt flouriſhing city in
the world, and had ſpread the arts of commerce into the remoteſt
regions.</p>
            <p>Whilſt Alexander was carrying on the ſiege of Tyre, he received
a ſecond letter from Darius, in which that monarch ſeemed more ſenſible
of his power than before; he now gave him the title of king, and offered him
ten thouſand ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents as a ranſom for his captive mother and wife; he
offered him his daughter Statira in marriage, with all the country he had
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, as far as the river Euphrates; he hinted to him the inconſtancy
of fortune, and deſcribed at large the powers he was ſtill
poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of to oppoſe. Theſe terms were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, 
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0813600202:216"/> that when the king debated upon them in council,
Parmenio, one of his generals, could not help obſerving, That if he were
Alexander, he would agree to ſuch a propoſal; to which Alexander nobly
replied, 
<q rend="inline">"And ſo would I, were I Parmenio:"</q> He
therefore treated the propoſals of Darius with haughty contempt, and
refuſed to accept of treaſures which he already conſidered as his own.
From Tyre Alexander marched to Jeruſalem, fully reſolved to puniſh that
city, for having refuſed to ſupply his army with proviſions during the
late ſiege; but the reſentment of the conqueror was averted, by meeting a
proceſſion of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of that city on his way, marching out to
receive him, dreſſed in white, with a Jewiſh high-prieſt before them,
with a mitre on his head, on the front of which the name of God was written.
The moment the king perceived the high-prieſt, he advanced towards him with
an air of the moſt profound reſpect, bowed his body, adored the auguſt
name upon his front, and ſaluted him who wore it with religious veneration.
Then the Jews, ſurrounding Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, raiſed their voices to wiſh him
every kind of proſperity. All the ſpectators were ſeized with
inexpreſſible ſurpriſe; they could ſcarce believe their eyes; and did
not know <pb n="215" facs="tcp:0813600202:217"/> how to account for a ſight ſo contrary to
their expectation, and ſo vaſtly improbable.</p>
            <p>Parmenio, who could not yet recover from his aſtoniſhment,
aſked the king how it came to paſs that he who was adored by every one,
adored the high-prieſt of the Jews: 
<q rend="inline">"I do not," replied Alexander, "adore the
high-prieſt, but the God whoſe miniſter he is; for whilſt I was at Dia
in Macedonia, my mind wholly fixed on the great deſign of the Perſian
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>•…</desc>
                  </gap>ar, as I was revolving the methods
how to conquer Aſia, this very man, dreſſed in the ſame robes, appeared
to me in a dream, exhorted me to baniſh my fear, bade me croſs the
Helleſpont boldly, and aſſured me that God would march at the head of my
army, and give me the victory over that of the Perſians."</q> This ſpeech,
delivered with an air of ſincerity, no doubt had its effect in encouraging
the army, and eſtabliſhing an opinion that Alexander's miſſion was from
Heaven. Alexander having embraced the high-prieſt, was conducted by him to
the temple, where, after he had explained to him many prophecies in different
parts of the Old Teſtament, concerning his invaſion, he taught him to offer
up a ſacrifice in the Jewiſh manner.</p>
            <p>Alexander was ſo much pleaſed with his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception upon this
occaſion, that, before he left <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0813600202:218"/> Jeruſalem, he
aſſembled the Jews, and bade them aſk any favour they ſhould think
proper. Their requeſt was, To be allowed to live ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their ancient
laws and maxims; to be exempted from tribute every ſeventh year, as they were
by their laws exempted from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and could conſequently have no
harveſts: they requeſted, that ſuch of their brethren as were ſettled
in Aſia, ſhould be indulged in the ſame privileges. Thus, being gratified
in all their deſires, great numbers of them offered to enliſt themſelves
in his army. Soon after the Samaritans demanded the ſame favours; but he gave
them an evaſive anſwer, and promiſed to take the matter into
conſideration, upon his return.</p>
            <p>From this city he went on to Gaza, where he found a more obſtinate
reſiſtance than he had expected; but at length taking the town by ſtorm,
and having cut the garriſon, conſiſting of ten thouſand men, to pieces,
with brutal fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, he ordered Boetis, the governor, to be brought before
him; and having in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to intimidate him, commanded, at laſt,
that holes ſhould be bored through his heels, and thus to be tied by cords to
the back of his chariot, and in this manner to be dragged round the walls of
the city. This he did in <pb n="217" facs="tcp:0813600202:219"/> imitation of Achilles, whom
Homer deſcribes as having dragged Hector round the walls of Troy in the
ſame manner; but it was reading the poet to very little advantage, to imitate
his hero in the moſt unworthy part of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as Alexander had ended the ſiege of Gaza, he left a
garriſon there, and turned the whole power of his arms towards Egypt. In
ſeven days march he arrived before Peluſium, whither a great number of
Egyptians had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, with all imaginable diligence, to own him for
their ſovereign; being heartily diſpleaſed with the Perſian government,
as likewiſe the Perſian governors; as the one deſtroyed their liberty,
the other ridiculed their religion. Maſaeus, the Perſian governor, who
commanded in Memphis, finding it would be to no purpoſe for him to reſiſt
ſo triumphant an army, and that Darius, his ſovereign, was not in a
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to ſuccour him, ſet open the gates of the city to the conqueror,
and gave up eight hundred talents, (about one hundred and forty thouſand
pounds) and all the king's furniture. Thus Alexander poſſeſſed
himſelf of all Egypt, without meeting with the leaſt oppoſition.</p>
            <p>He now therefore formed a deſign of viſiting the temple of
Jupiter. This temple was ſituated <pb n="218" facs="tcp:0813600202:220"/> at a diſtance of
twelve days journey from Memphis, in the midſt of the ſandy deſarts of
Lybia. Alexander having read in Homer, and other fabulous authors of antiquity,
that moſt of the heroes were repreſented as the ſons of ſome deity, was
willing himſelf to paſs for a hero, and knew that he could bribe the
prieſts to compliment him, as of celeſtial origin. Setting out therefore
along the river Memphis, and after having paſſed Canopus, oppoſite the
iſland of Pharos, he there laid the foundation of the city of Alexandria,
which in a little time became one of the moſt flouriſhing towns for
commerce in the world. From thence he had a journey of three hundred and forty
miles to the temple of Jupiter; the way leading through inhoſpitable
deſarts, and plains of ſand. The ſoldiers were patient enough for the two
firſt days march, before they arrived amidſt the dreadful ſolitudes; but
as ſoon as they found themſelves in vaſt plains, covered with ſands of
a prodigious depth, they were greatly ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified. Surrounded as with a ſea,
they gazed round as far as their ſight could extend, to diſcover if
poſſible, ſome place that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited; but all in vain, for they could
not perceive ſo much as a ſingle tree, nor the leaſt footſteps of any
land that had been cultivated. <pb n="219" facs="tcp:0813600202:221"/> To increaſe their
calamity, the water that they had brought in goat-ſkins, upon camels, now
failed, and there was not ſo much as a ſingle drop in all that ſandy
deſart. They were however greatly refreſhed by the accidental falling of a
ſhower, which ſerved to encourage them in their progreſs, till they came
to the temple of the Deity. Nothing can be more fanciful than the deſcription
the hiſtorians have given us of this gloomy retreat: it is repreſented as a
ſmall ſpot of fertile ground, in the midſt of vaſt ſolitudes of
ſand; it is covered with the thickeſt trees, that exclude the rays of the
ſun; and watered with ſeveral ſprings, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it in perpetual
verdure; near the grove where the temple ſtood was the Fountain of the Sun,
which at day-break was luke-warm, at noon cold, then towards evening
inſenſibly grew warmer, and was boiling hot at midnight. The god
worſhipped in this place, had his ſtatue made of emeralds, and other
precious ſtones: and from the head to the navel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a ram. No
ſooner had Alexander appeared before the altar, than the high prieſt
declared him to be the ſon of Jupiter; the conqueror quite intoxicated with
adulation, aſked, Whether he ſhould have ſucceſs in his expedition; the
prieſt anſwered, That he ſhould <pb n="220" facs="tcp:0813600202:222"/> be monarch of the
world: the conqueror en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, If his father's murderers were puniſhed; the
prieſt replied, That his father Jupiter was immortal, but that the murderers
of Philip had been all extirpated.</p>
            <p>Alexander having ended his ſacrifice, and rewarded the prieſts,
who had been ſo liberal of their titles, from that time ſuppoſed
himſelf or would have it ſuppoſed, that he was the ſon of Jupiter. Upon
his return from the temple, and during his ſtay in Egypt, he ſettled the
government of that country upon the moſt ſolid foundation; he divided it
into diſtricts, over each of which he appointed a lieutenant, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
orders from himſelf alone. And thus having ſettled affairs there, he ſet
out, in the beginning of ſpring, to march againſt Darius<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> who was now preparing to oppoſe him.
He made ſome ſtay at Tyre, to ſettle the various affairs of the countries
he had left behind; and advanced towards new conqueſts. On his march<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

continued his journey towards the Tygris, where he at laſt expected to come
up with the enemy, and to ſtrik<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>

               </gap> nations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0813600202:223"/> Darius had already made overtures of peace to
him twice; but finding at laſt that there were no hopes of their concluding
one, unleſs he reſigned the whole empire to him, prepared himſelf again
for battle. For this purpoſe, he aſſembled in Babylon an army half as
numerous again as that at Iſſus, and marched it towards Nineveh. His forces
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all the plains of Meſopotamia. Advice being brought that the enemy
was not far off, he cauſed Satropates, colonel of the cavalry, to advance at
the head of a thouſand choſen horſe; and likewiſe gave ſix thouſand
to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaeus, governor of the province; all whom were to prevent Alexander
from croſſing the river, and to lay waſte the country through which that
monarch was to paſs. But he arrived too late.</p>
            <p>The Tygris is the moſt rapid river of all the eaſt; and it was
with ſome difficulty that Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander's ſoldiers were able to ſtem the
current, carrying their arms over their heads. The king walked on foot among
the infantry, and pointed out with his hand the paſſage to his ſoldiers:
he commanded them, with a loud voice, To ſave nothing but their arms; and let
their baggage that retarded them in the water, float away with the ſtream. At
length <pb n="222" facs="tcp:0813600202:224"/> they were drawn up in battle-array on the
oppoſite ſhore; and encamped two days near the river, ſtill prepared for
action. An eclipſe of the moon, which happened about that time, gave
Alexander's ſoldiers great unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; but he brought forward ſome
Egyptian ſoothſayers, who aſſured the army, That the moon portended
calamities not to the Greeks, but the Perſians. By this artifice the hopes
and the courage of the ſoldiers being revived once more, the king led them on
to meet the enemy, and began his march at midnight. On his right hand lay the
Tygris, and on his left the Gordylean mountains. At break of day, news was
brought, that Darius was but twenty miles from the place they then were. All
things now therefore threatened an approaching battle; when Darius, who had
already twice ſued for peace, ſent new conditions, ſtill more
advantageous than the former. But Alexander refuſed his offers; proudly
replying, That the world would not permit two ſuns nor two ſovereigns. Thus
all negociation being at an end, both ſides prepared for battle; equally
irritated, and equally ambitious. Darius pitched his camp near a village called
Gangamila, and the river Bumila, in a plain at a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable diſtance
from Arbela. He had before <pb n="223" facs="tcp:0813600202:225"/> levelled the ſpot, which he
pitched upon for the field of battle, in order that his chariots and cavalry
might have full room to move in; that his fighting in the ſtreights of
Cilicia, had loſt him the battle fought there.</p>
            <p>Alexander upon hearing this news, continued four days in the place
he then was to reſt his army, and ſurrounded his camp with trenches and
palliſadoes; for he was determined to leave all his baggage, and the
uſeleſs ſoldiers in it, and march the remainder againſt the enemy, with
no other equipage than the arms they car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. Accordingly he ſet out about
nine in the evening, in order to fight Darius at day break; who, upon this
advice had drawn up his army in order of battle. Alexander alſo marched in
battle-array; for both armies were within two or three leagues of each other.
When he was arrived at the mountains, where he could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the enemy's
army, he halted; and having aſſembled his general officers, as well
Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians as foreigners, he debated whether they ſhould engage
immediately, or pitch their camp in that place. The latter opinion being
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, becauſe it was judged proper for them to view the field of battle,
and the manner in which the enemy was drawn up, the army en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped in the
ſame order in which it had <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0813600202:226"/> marched; during which
Alexander at the head of his infantry lightly armed, and his royal regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
marched round the plain in which the battle was to be fought.</p>
            <p>Being returned, he aſſembled his general of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers a ſecond
time, and told them, that there was no occaſion for making a ſpeech,
becauſe their courage and great actions were alone ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to excite
them to glory; and he deſired them only to repreſent to the ſoldiers,
that they were not to fight on this occaſion for Phoenicia or Aegypt, but for
all Aſia, which would be poſſeſſed by him who ſhould conquer; and
tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> after having gone through ſo

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> victory. After this ſpeech, he ordered them to take
ſome repoſe.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid Parmenio adviſed him to attack the enemy in the night

               <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0813600202:227"/> it was running great hazard, to fall upon
ſo numerous an army in the night time and in an unknown country. Darius
fearing he ſhould be attacked at unawares, becauſe he had not intrenched
himſelf, obliged his ſoldiers to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the whole night under arms,
which prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the higheſt prejudice to him in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement. In the mean
time Alexander went to bed to repoſe himſelf the remaining part of the
night. As he revolved in his mind, not without ſome emotion, the
conſequence of the battle, which was upon the point of being fought, he could
not ſleep immediately. But his body being oppreſſed in a manner by the
anxiety of his mind, he ſlept ſoundly the whole night, contrary to his
uſual cuſtom, ſo that when his generals were aſſembled at day-break
before his tent, to receive his orders, they were greatly ſurprized to find
he was not awake; upon which they themſelves commanded the ſoldiers to take
ſome refreſhment. Parmenio having at laſt awaked him, and ſeeming
ſurprized to ſind him in ſo calm and ſweet a ſleep, juſt as he was
going to fight a battle in which his whole fortune lay at ſtake, How could it
be poſſible, ſaid Alexander, for me not to be calm, ſince the enemy is
coming to deliver himſelf into my hands? Upon this he immediately took up his
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0813600202:228"/> arms, mounted his horſe, and rode up and down the
ranks, exhorting the troops to behave gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantly, and if poſſible, to
ſurpaſs their-ancient fame, and the glory they had hitherto acquired.</p>
            <p>There was a great difference between the two armies in reſpect to
numbers, but much more with regard to courage. That of Darius con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted at
leaſt of ſix hundred thouſand foot and forty thouſand horſe; and the
other of no more than forty thouſand foot, and ſeven or eight thouſand
horſe, but the latter was all fire and ſtrength; whereas on the ſide of
the Perſians it was a prodigious aſſemblage of men, not of ſoldiers; an
empty phantom rather than a real army. Both ſides were diſpoſed in very
near the ſame array. The forces were drawn up in two lines, the cavalry on
the two wings, and the infantry in the middle; the one and the other being
under the particular conduct of the chiefs of each of the different nations
that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed them; and commanded in general, by the principal crown
officers. The front of the battle (under Darius) was covered with two hundred
chariots, armed with ſcythes, and with fifteen elephants, that king taking
his poſt in the center of the firſt line. Beſides the guards which were
the flower of his forces, he alſo had fortified himſelf with the Grecian
infantry, <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0813600202:229"/> whom he had drawn up near his perſon,
believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this body only capable of oppoſing the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedonian phalanx. As his
army ſpread over a much greater ſpace of ground, than that of the enemy, he
intended to ſurround and to charge them at one and the ſame time, both in
front and flank, which from Alexander's diſpoſition, he ſoon after found
impoſſible.</p>
            <p>Darius being afraid leſt the Macedonians ſhould draw him from
the ſpot of ground he had levelled, and carry him into another that was rough
and uneven, commanded the cavalry in his left wing, which ſpread much farther
than that of the enemy's right, to march direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forward, and wheel about
upon the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians in flank, to prevent them from extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their troops
farther. Upon which Alexander diſpatched againſt them the body of horſe
in his ſervice, commanded by Menidas; but as theſe were not able to make
head againſt the enemy, becauſe of their prodigious numbers, he rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced
them with the Paeonians, whom Aretas commanded, and with the foreign cavalry.
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the advantage of numbers, the Perſians had that alſo of coats of
mail, which ſecured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and their horſes much more, and by which
Alexander's cavalry was prodigiouſly annoyed. However, the Macedonians
marched to the <pb n="228" facs="tcp:0813600202:230"/> charge with great bravery, and at laſt
put the enemy to flight.</p>
            <p>Upon this the Perſians oppoſed the chariots armed with ſcythes
againſt the Macedonian phalanx, in order to break it, but with little
ſucceſs. The noiſe which the ſoldiers, who were lightly armed, made by
ſtriking their ſwords againſt their bucklers, and the arrows which flew
on all ſides, frighted the horſes, and made a great number of them turn
back againſt their own troops. Others laying hold of the horſes bridles,
pulled the riders down and cut them to pieces. Part of the chariots drove
between the battalions, which opened to make way for them as they had been
ordered to do, by which means they did little or no execution.</p>
            <p>Alexander ſeeing Darius ſet his whole army in motion, in order
to charge him, employed a ſtratagem to encourage his ſoldiers. When the
battle was at the hotteſt, and the Macedonians were in the greateſt danger,
Ariſtander the ſoothſayer, clothed in his white robes, holding a branch
of lawrel in his hand, advances among the combatants as he had been
inſtructed by the king; and crying, that he ſaw an eagle hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over
Alexander's head (a ſure omen of vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory) he ſhewed with his finger, the
pretended bird to the ſoldiers; who relying upon the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity 
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0813600202:231"/> of the ſoothſayer, fancied they alſo ſaw it; and
thereupon renewed the attack with greater chearfulneſs and ardour than ever.
Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander now preſſed to the place in which Darius was ſtationed, and
the preſence of the two op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing kings inſpired both ſides with
vigour. Darius was mounted on a chariot, and Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander on horſeback; both
ſurrounded with their braveſt officers and ſoldiers, whoſe only
endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours were to ſave the lives of their reſpective princes at the
hazard of their own. The battle was obſtinate and bloody. Alexander having
wounded Darius's equerry, with a javelin, the Perſians as well as Macedonians
imagined that the king was killed; upon which the former, breaking aloud into
the moſt diſmal ſounds, the whole army was ſeized with the greateſt
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation. The relations of Darius, who were at his left hand, fled away
with the guards, and ſo abandoned the chariot; but thoſe who were at his
right, took him into the center of their body. Hiſtorians relate, that this
prince hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawn his ſcymetar, reflected whether he ought not to lay
violent hands upon himſelf, rather than fly in an ignominious manner. But
perceiving from his chariot, that his ſoldiers ſtill fought, he was
aſhamed to forſake them; and as divided between hope and deſpair, the 
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0813600202:232"/> Perſians retired inſenſibly and thinned their
ranks, when it could no longer be called a battle, but a ſlaughter. Then
Darius turning about his chariot, fled with the reſt; and the conqueror was
now wholly employed in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing him. But in the mean time, finding that the
left wing of his army, which was commanded by Parmenio, was in great danger,
Alexander was obliged to deſiſt from purſuing Darius, whom he had
almoſt overtaken, and wheeled round to attack the Perſian horſe, that,
after plundering the camp, were retiring in good order; them he cut in pieces;
and the ſcale of battle turning in favour of the Macedonians, a total rout of
the Perſians enſued. The purſuit was warm, and the ſlaughter amazing:
Alexander rode as far as Arbela after Darius; every moment hoping to come up
with that monarch: he had juſt paſſed through when Alexander arrived, but
he left his treaſure, with his bow and ſhield, as a prey to the enemy.</p>
            <p>Such was the ſucceſs of this famous battle, which gave empire to
the conqueror. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Arrian, the Perſians loſt three hundred
thouſand men, beſides thoſe who were taken priſoners; which at leaſt
is a proof that the loſs was very great on their ſide. That 
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:0813600202:233"/> of Alexander's was very inconſiderable; he not
loſing, according to the laſt mentioned author, above twelve hundred men,
moſt of whom were horſe. This engagement was fought in the month of
October, about the ſame time, that two years before, the battle of Iſus was
fought. As Gangamela, in Aſſyria, the ſpot where the two armies engaged,
was a ſmall place of very little note, this was called the battle of Arbela,
that city being neareſt to the field of battle.</p>
            <p>Darius, after this dreadful defeat, rode to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the river Lycus,
with a very few attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants; he was adviſed to break down the bridges to
ſecure his retreat; but he refuſed, ſaying, He would not ſave his life,
at the expence of thouſands of his ſubjects. After riding a great number of
miles full ſpeed, he arrived, at midnight, at Arbela; from thence he fled
to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Media, over the Armenian mountains, followed by his ſatraps, and a
few of his guards, expecting the worſt, deſpairing of fortune, a wretched
ſurvivor of his country's ruin.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, Alexander approached near Babylon; and Mazaeus the
governor, who had retired thither after the battle of Arbela, 
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0813600202:234"/> ſurrendered it to him without ſtriking a blow.
Alexander therefore entered the city, at the head of his whole army, as if he
had been marching to a battle. The walls of Babylon were lined with people,
notwithſtanding the greateſt part of the citizens were gone out before,
from the impatient deſire they had to ſee their new ſovereign, whoſe
renown had far outſtripped his march. Bagophanes, governor of the fortreſs,
and guardian of the treaſure, unwilling to diſcover leſs zeal than
Mazaeus, ſtrewed the ſtreets with flowers, and raiſed on both ſides of
the way ſilver altars, which ſmoaked not only with frankincenſe, but the
moſt fragrant perfumes of every kind. Laſt of all came the preſents which
were to be made to the king; <hi>viz.</hi> herds of cattle, and a great number
of horſes; as alſo lions and panthers, which were carried in cages. After
theſe the Magi walked, ſinging hymns after the manner of their country;
then the Chaldeans, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by the Babyloniſh ſoothſayers and
muſicians. The rear was brought up by the Babyloniſh cavalry; of which,
both men and horſes were ſo ſumptuous, that imagination can ſcarce
reach their magnificence. The king cauſed the people to walk after the
infantry, <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0813600202:235"/> and himſelf, ſurrounded with his guards,
and ſeated on a chariot, entered the city, and from thence rode to the
palace, as in a kind of triumph. The next day he took a view of all Darius's
money and moveables, which amounted to incredible ſums, and which he
diſtributed with generoſity among his ſoldiers. He gave the government of
the province to Mazaeus; and the command of the forces he left there, to
Apollodorus of Amphipolis.</p>
            <p>From Rabylon Alexander marched to the province of Syraceni,
afterwards to Suſa, where he arrived after a march of twenty days, and found
treaſures to an infinite amount. Theſe alſo he applied to the purpoſes
of rewarding merit and courage among his troops. In this city he left the
mother and children of Darius; and from thence he went forward, till he came to
a river called, Paſitigris. Having croſſed it, with nine thouſand foot,
and three thouſand horſe, conſiſting of Agrians, as well as of Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian
mercenaries, and a reinforcement of three thouſand Thracians, he entered the
country of Uxii. This region lies near Suſa, and extends to the frontiers of
Perſia; a narrow paſs only lying between it and Suſiana. Madathes
commanded this province. He was not a time-ſerver, nor a follower of fortune;
but <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0813600202:236"/> faithful to his ſovereign; he reſolved to hold
out to the laſt extremity; and for this purpoſe, had withdrawn into his own
city, which ſtood in the midſt of craggy rocks, and was ſurrounded with
precipices. Having been forced from thence, he retired into the citadel, whence
the beſieged ſent thirty deputies to Alexander, to ſue for quarter, which
they obtained at laſt, by the interpoſition of Syſigambis. The king not
only pardoned Madathes, who was a near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that princeſs, but
likewiſe ſet all the captives, and thoſe who had ſurrendered
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at liberty, permitted them to enjoy their ſeveral rights and
privileges, would not ſuffer the city to be plundered, but let them plough
their lands, without paying any tribute. From thence he paſſed on to the
paſs of Suſa, defended by mountains almoſt inacceſſible, and by
Ariobarzanes, with a body of five thouſand men; he there ſtopped for a
while, but being led by a different rout among the mountains, he came over the
paſs and ſo cut the army that defended it in pieces.</p>
            <p>Alexander, from an effect of the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune which conſtantly
attended him in all his undertakings, having extricated himſelf hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily out
of the danger to which he was ſo lately expoſed, marched immediately
towards <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0813600202:237"/> Perſia. Being on the road, he received letters
from Tiridates, governor of Perſepolis, which informed him, that the
inhabitants of that city, upon the report of his advancing towards him, were
determined to plunder Darius's treaſures, with which he was intruſted; and
therefore, that it was neceſſary for him to make all the haſte imaginable
to ſeize them himſelf; that he had only the Araxes to croſs, after which
the road was ſmooth and eaſy. Alexander, upon this news, leaving his
infantry behind, marched the whole night at the head of his cavalry, who were
very much harraſſed by the length and ſwiftneſs of his march, and
paſſed the Araxes, on a bridge, which, by his order, had been but ſome
days before.</p>
            <p>But as he drew near the city, he perceived a large body of men, who
exhibited a memorable example of the greateſt miſery. Theſe were about
four thouſand Greeks, very far advanced in years, who having been made
priſoners of war, had ſuffered all the torments which the Perſian tyranny
could inflict. The hands of ſome had been cut off, the feet of others; and
others again had loſt their noſes and ears. They appeared like ſo many
ſhadows, rather than like men; ſpeech being almoſt the only thing by
which they were known to be ſuch. <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0813600202:238"/> Alexander could not
refrain from tears at this ſight; and as they irreſiſtably brought him to
commiſerate their condition, he bade them, with the utmoſt tenderneſs,
not to deſpond; and aſſured them, that they ſhould again ſee their
wives and country. They choſe, however, to remain in a place where misfortune
now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came habitual; wherefore he rewarded them li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berally for their
ſufferings, and commanded the governor of the province to treat them with
mildneſs and reſpect. The day following he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the city of
Perſepolis, at the head of his victorious ſoldiers; who, though the
inhabitants made no reſiſtance, began to cut in pieces all thoſe who
ſtill remained in the city. However, the king ſoon put an end to the
maſſacre, and forbid his ſoldiers further violence. The riches he had
found in other places, were but trifling, when compared to thoſe he found
here. This however, did not ſave the city; for being one day at a banquet
among his friends, and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to drink to exceſs, the converſation ran
upon the various cruelties exerciſed by the Perſians in Greece,
particularly at Athens Thais, an Athenian courtezan, urged the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimity
of not taking revenge for ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſlaughters. All the gueſts
applauded the diſcourſe; when immediately the king roſe from 
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0813600202:239"/> table (his head being crowned with flowers), and taking
a torch in his hand, he advanced forward, to execute his mad exploit. The whole
company followed him, breaking into loud acclamations, and, after ſinging and
dancing, ſurrounded the palace. All the reſt of the Macedonians, at this
noiſe, ran in crowds, with lighted tapers, and ſet fire to every part of
it. However, Alexander was ſorry not long after for what he had done; and
thereupon gave orders for extinguiſhing the fire; but it was too late.</p>
            <p>While Alexander was thus triumphing in all the exultation of
ſucceſs, the wretched Darius was by this time arrived at Ecbatana, the
ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital of Media. There remained ſtill with this fugitive prince thirty
thouſand foot; among whom were four thouſand Greeks, that were faithful to
him to the laſt: beſides theſe he had four thouſand ſlingers, and
upwards of three thouſand Bactrian horſe, whom Beſſus, their go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
commanded. Darius, even with ſo ſmall a force, ſtill conceived hopes of
oppoſing his rival; or at leaſt of protracting the war: but he was
ſurrounded with traitors; his want of ſucceſs had turned all mankind
againſt him; but Nabarzanes, one of the greateſt lords of Perſia, and
general of the horſe, had conſpired <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0813600202:240"/> with Beſſus,
general of the Bactrians, to commit the blackeſt of all crimes, and that was,
to ſeize upon the perſon of the king, and lay him in chains, which they
might eaſily do; as each of them had a great number of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers under his
command. Their deſign was, if Alexander ſhould purſue them, to ſecure
themſelves, by giving up Darius alive into his hands; and, in caſe they
eſcaped, to murder that prince, and afterwards uſurp his crown, and begin a
new war. Theſe traitors ſoon won over the troops, by repreſenting to
them, that they were going to their deſtruction; that they would ſoon be
cruſhed under the ruins of an empire, which was juſt ready to fall, at the
ſame time that Bactriana was open to them, and offered them immenſe riches.
Theſe promiſes ſoon prevailed upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious army; the traitors
ſeized, and bound their monarch in chains of gold, under the appearance of
honour, as he was a king; then encloſing him in a covered chariot, they ſet
out towards Bactriana. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they carried him, with the utmoſt
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch; until being informed that the Grecian army was ſtill hotly
purſuing them, they found it impoſſible either to conciliate the
friendſhip of Alexander, or to ſecure a throne for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: 
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0813600202:241"/> they therefore once more gave Darius his liberty, and
deſired him to make the beſt of his eſcape with them from the conqueror;
but he replied, That the gods were ready to revenge the evils he had already
ſuffered; and, appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Alexander for juſtice, refuſed to follow a
band of traitors. At theſe words they fell into the utmoſt fury,
thruſting him with their darts and their ſpears, and left him to linger in
this manner, unattended, the remains of his wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed life. The traitors then
made their eſcape dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ways; while the victorious Macedonians at length
coming up, found Darius in a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, lying in his chariot, and drawing
near his end. However, he had ſtrength enough before he died, to call for
drink; which a Macedonian, Polyſtratus by name, brought him. He had a
Perſian priſoner, whom he employed as his interpreter. Darius, after
drinking the liquor that had been given him, turned to the Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donian, and
ſaid, That in the deplorable ſtate to which he was reduced, he however
ſhould have the comfort to ſpeak to one who could underſtand him; and
that his laſt words would not be loſt. He therefore charged him to tell
Alexander, That he had died in his debt, that he gave him many thanks, for the
great hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity he had exerciſed towards his mother, <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0813600202:242"/>
his wife, and his children, whoſe lives he had not only ſpared, but
reſtored to their former ſplendor: that he beſought the gods to give
victory to his arms, and make him monarch of the univerſe; that he thought he
need not intreat him to revenge the execrable murder commited on his perſon,
as this was the common cauſe of kings.</p>
            <p> After this, taking Polyſtratus by the hand, 
<q rend="inline">"Give him," ſaid he, "thy hand, as I give thee
mine; and carry him, in my name, the only pledge I am able to give of my
grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and affections:"</q> ſaying theſe words, he breathed his
laſt.</p>
            <p>Alexander coming up a moment after, and ſeeing Darius's body, he
wept bitterly; and by the ſtrongeſt teſtimonies of affection that could
be given, proved how intimately he was affected with the unhappineſs of a
prince who deſerved a better fate. He immediately pulled off his military
cloak, and threw it on Darius's body; then cauſing it to be embalmed, and his
coffin to be adorned with royal magnificence, he ſent it to Syſigambis, to
be interred with the honours uſually paid to the deceaſed Perſian
monarchs, and entombed with his anceſtors. Thus died Darius, in the fiftieth
year of his age; ſix of which he reigned with felicity: in him 
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0813600202:243"/> the Perſian empire ended, after having exiſted, from
the time of Cyrus the Great, a period of two hundred and ninety-nine years.</p>
            <p>The death of Darius only ſerved to inflame the ſpirit of
ambition in Alexander to purſue further conqueſts. After having in vain
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to purſue Beſſus, who now aſſumed the name of king, he
deſiſted, in order to croſs Parthia; and in three days arrived on the
frontiers of Hyrcania, which ſubmitted to his arms. He afterwards ſubdued
the Mandii, the Arii, the Drangae, the Arachoſii, and ſeveral other
nations; into which his army marched with greater ſpeed, than people
ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally travel. He frequently would purſue an enemy for whole days and
nights together; almoſt without ſuffering his troops to take any reſt. By
this prodigious rapidity, he came unawares upon nations who thought him at a
great diſtance; and ſubdued them, before they had time to put themſelves
in a poſture of defence.</p>
            <p>It was upon one of theſe excurſions that Thaleſtris, queen of
the Amazons, came to pay him a viſit. A violent deſire of ſeeing
Alexander, had prompted that princeſs to leave her dominions, and travel
through a great number of countries to gratify her curioſity. 
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0813600202:244"/> Being come pretty near his camp, ſhe ſent word, That
a queen was come to viſit him; and that ſhe had a prodigious inclination to
cultivate his acquaintance; and accordingly was arrived within a little
diſtance from that place. Alexander having returned a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able anſwer,
ſhe commanded her train to ſtop, and herſelf came forward, with three
hundred women; and the moment ſhe perceived the king, ſhe leaped from her
horſe, having two lances in her right hand. She looked upon the king without
diſcovering the leaſt ſign of admiration, and ſurveying him
attentively, did not think his ſtature anſwerable to his fame; for the
Barbarians are very much ſtruck with a majeſtic air; and think thoſe only
capable of mighty atchievements, on whom nature has beſtowed bodily
advantages. She did not ſcruple to tell him that the chief motive of her
journey was to have poſterity by him; adding, that ſhe was worthy of giving
heirs to his empire. Alexander, upon this requeſt, was obliged to make ſome
ſtay in this place; after which, Thaleſtris returned to her kingdom, and
the king into the province inhabited by the Parthians.</p>
            <p>Alexander now enjoying a little repoſe, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dones himſelf to
ſenſuality, and he whom the <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0813600202:245"/> arms of the Perſians
could not conquer, fell a victim to their vices. Nothing was now to be ſeen
but games, parties of pleaſure, women and exceſſive feaſting; in which
he uſed to revel whole days and nights. Not ſatisfied with the buffoons,
and the performers on inſtrumental muſic, whom he had brought with him out
of Greece, he obliged the captive women, whom he carried along with him, to
ſing ſongs, after the manner of their country. He happened, among theſe
women, to perceive one who appeared in deeper affliction than the reſt; and
who, by a modeſt, and at the ſame time a noble confuſion, diſcovered a
greater re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance than the others to appear in public. She was a perfect
beauty, which was very much heightened by her baſhfulneſs; whilſt ſhe
threw her eyes to the ground, and did all in her power to conceal her face. The
king ſoon imagined, by her air and mien, that ſhe was not of vulgar birth,
and enquiring himſelf into it, the lady anſwered, That ſhe was
grand-daughter to Ochus, who not long before had ſwayed the Perſian
ſcepter, and daughter of his ſon; that ſhe had married Hyſtaſpes, who
was related to Darius, and general of a great army. Alexander being touched
with compaſſion, when he heard the unhappy fate of a princeſs 
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0813600202:246"/> of the blood royal, and the ſad condition to which
ſhe was reduced, not only gave her liberty, but returned all her
poſſeſſions; and cauſed her huſband to be ſought for, in order
that ſhe might be reſtored to him.</p>
            <p>But now the veteran ſoldiers who had fought under Philip, not
having the leaſt idea of ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, inveighed publickly againſt the
prodigious luxury, and the numerous vices which the army had learnt in Suſa
and Ecbatena. The king therefore thought that the ſafeſt remedy would be to
employ them, and for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe led them againſt Beſſus. But as the
army was incumbered with booty and an uſeleſs train of baggage, ſo that
it could ſcarce move, he firſt cauſed all his own baggage to be carried
into a great ſquare, and afterwards that of his army (ſuch things excepted
as were abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary;) then ordered the whole to be carried from
thence in carts to a large plain. Every one was in great pain to know the
meaning of all this; but after he had ſent away the horſes, he himſelf
ſet fire to his own things, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded every one to follow his
example.</p>
            <p>Hitherto we have ſeen Alexander triumphing by a courſe of
virtue, we are now to behold him ſwollen up by ſucceſs, ſpoiled by
flattery and enervated by vices, exhibiting a very <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0813600202:247"/>
doubtful character, and mixing the tyrant with the hero. A conſpiracy was
formed againſt him by one Dymnus; this was communicated by a Macedonian
ſoldier to Philotas one of Alexander's favourites. Philotas neglected
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulging it to his maſter; and thus became ſuſpected himſelf as being
concerned in the conſpiracy. Parmenio alſo the father of this young
favourite became equally obnoxious, and as the ſuſpicion of tyrants is
equally fatal with a conviction, Alexander doomed both to deſtruction.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the night various parties of guards having been
poſted in the ſeveral places neceſſary, ſome entered the tent of
Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotas, who was then in a deep ſleep; when ſtarting from his ſlumbers,
as they were putting manacles on his hands, he cried, Alas! my ſovereign, the
inveteracy of my enemies has got the better of your goodneſs. After this they
covered his face and brought him to the palace without uttering a ſingle
word. His hands were tied behind him, and his head cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a coarſe
worn-out piece of cloth. Loſt to himſelf, he did not dare to look up, or
open his lips; but the tears ſtreaming from his eyes, he fainted away in the
arms of the man who held him. As the ſtanders-by wiped off the tears in which
his face was bathed, recovering <pb n="246" facs="tcp:0813600202:248"/> his ſpeech and his
voice by inſenſible degrees, he ſeemed deſirous of ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>The reſult of this interview was, that Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotas ſhould be put
to the rack. The perſons who preſided on that occaſion, were his moſt
inveterate enemies, and they made him ſuffer every kind of torture. Philotas
at firſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the utmoſt reſolution and ſtrength of mind; the
torments he ſuffered not being able to force from him a ſingle word nor
even ſo much as a ſigh. But at laſt conquered by pain, he confeſſed
himſelf to be guilty, named ſeveral accomplices, and even accuſed his own
father. The next day the anſwers of Philotas were read in full aſſembly,
he himſelf being preſent. Upon the whole he was unanimouſly ſentenced
to die; immediately after which he was ſtoned, according to the cuſtom of
Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia, with ſome other of the conſpirators.</p>
            <p>The condemnation of Philotas brought on that of Parmenio: whether it
were that Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander really believed him guilty, or was afraid of the father,
now he had put the ſon to death. Polydamus one of the lords of the court, was
appointed to ſee the execution performed. He had been one of Parmenio's
moſt intimate friends, if we may give that name to courtiers, who affect only
their own fortunes. This was <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0813600202:249"/> the very reaſon of his
being nominated, becauſe no one could ſuſpect, that he was ſent with
any ſuch orders againſt Parmenio. He therefore ſet out for Media, where
that general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the army, and was intruſted with the king's
treaſure, which amounted to an hundred and fourſcore thouſand talents,
about twenty ſeven millions ſterling. Alexander had given him ſeveral
letters for Cleander the king's lieutenant in the province; and for the
prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal officers. Two were for Parmenio; one of them from Alexander, and the
other ſealed with Philotas's ſeal, as if he had been alive, to prevent the
father from harbouring the leaſt ſuſpicion. Polydamus was but eleven days
on his journey, and alighted in the night-time at Cleander's. After having
taken all the precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions neceſſary, they went together with a great
number of attendants to meet Parmenio, who at this time was walking in a park
of his own. The moment Polydamus ſpied him, though at a great diſtance, he
ran to embrace him with an air of the utmoſt joy; and after compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
intermixed with the ſtrongeſt indica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of friendſhip, had paſſed
on both ſides, he gave him Alexander's letter, which opening, and afterwards
that under the name of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotas, he ſeemed pleaſed with the contents. 
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0813600202:250"/> At that very inſtant Cleander thruſt a dagger into
his ſide, then made another thruſt in his throat; and the reſt gave him
ſeveral wounds, even after he was dead. He was at the time of his death
threeſcore and ten years of age, and had ſerved his maſter with a
fidelity and zeal which in the end was but very ill rewarded.</p>
            <p>In order to prevent the ill conſequences that might ariſe from
the contemplation of theſe cruelties, Alexander ſet out upon his march and
continued to purſue Beſſus, upon which occaſion he expoſed himſelf
to great hardſhips and dangers. Beſſus however was treated by his
followers in the ſame manner he had treated the king his maſter:
Spitamenes, his chief confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, having formed a conſpiracy againſt him,
ſeized his perſon, put him in chains, forced the royal robes from his back;
and with a chain round his neck, he was delivered up in the moſt ignominious
manner to Alexander. The king cauſed this man to be treated with his uſual
cruelty; after reproaching him for his treachery, and cauſing his noſe and
ears to be cut off, he ſent him to Ecbatana, there to ſuffer whatever
puniſhment Darius's mother ſhould think proper to inflict upon him. Four
trees were bent by main force, one towards the other, and to each of theſe
trees one of the <pb n="249" facs="tcp:0813600202:251"/> limbs of this traitor's body was
faſtened. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards theſe trees being let return to their natural
poſition, they flew back with ſo much violence, that each tore away the
limb that was fixed to it, and ſo quartered him.</p>
            <p>Thus uniting in his perſon at once great cruelty and great
enterprize, Alexander ſtill marched forward in ſearch of new nations whom
he might ſubdue. A city inhabited by the Branchid he totally overturned, and
maſſacred all the inhabitants in cool blood, only for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deſcended
from ſome traiterous Greeks, that had delivered up the treaſures of a
temple with which they had been intruſted. He then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to the river
Jaxerthes, where he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a wound in the leg; from thence he went forward
and took the capital of Sogdiana; he there received an embaſſy from the
Scy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians, who lived free and independent, but now ſubmitted to him. He then
marched to Cyropolis and beſieged it. This was the laſt city of the
Perſian empire, and had been built by Cyrus, after whom it was called, and
taking the place he abandoned it to plunder. In this manner he went on
capriciouſly deſtroying ſome towns and building others, ſettling
colonies in ſome places, and laying whole provinces waſte at his
pleaſure. Among his other projects an <pb n="250" facs="tcp:0813600202:252"/> invaſion of
the kingdom of Scythia was one; but the croſſing of the river Jaxerthes was
by no means an eaſy taſk; however Alexander being always foremoſt in
encountring dangers, led on his troops acroſs the ſtream, which was very
rapid, and gained a ſignal victory over the Scythians, who vainly attempted
to oppoſe him on the other ſide.</p>
            <p>A ſtrong hold called Petra Oxiani, defended by a garriſon of
thirty thouſand ſoldiers, with ammunition and proviſion for two years,
was ſtill conſidered as impregnable. However as difficulties only ſeemed
to excite his ambition, his ſoldiers ſcaled the cliff, and the barbarians
ſuppoſing that the whole Macedonian army was got over their heads,
ſurrendered upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition that their lives ſhould be ſpared; but
Alexander forgetting the faith of treaty and the humanity which became a
ſoldier on this occaſion, cauſed them all to be ſcourged with rods, and
afterwards to be fixed to croſſes at the foot of the ſame rock.</p>
            <p>After this having ſubdued the Maſſagetae and Dahae, he entered
the province of Barſaria, from thence he advanced to Maracander, and
appointed Clytus governor of that province. This was an old officer who had
fought under Philip, and ſignalized himſelf on many oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. 
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0813600202:253"/> At the battle of the Granicus, as Alexander was fighting
bare-headed and Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaces had his arm raiſed, in order to ſtrike him
behind, Clytus covered the king with his ſhield, and cut off the barbarian's
hand. Hellanice, his ſiſter, had nurſed Alexander; and he loved her with
as much tenderneſs as if ſhe had been his own mother.</p>
            <p>This favour however, only advanced Clytus to a poſt of greater
danger; one evening at an entertainment, the king after drinking immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derately,
began to celebrate his own exploits; his boaſting even ſhocked thoſe very
perſons, who knew that he ſpoke truth, but particularly the old generals of
his army, whoſe admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ingroſſed by the actions of his
fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Clytus was intoxicated, and turning about to thoſe who ſat below
him at table, quoted to them a paſſage from Euripides, but in ſuch a
manner that the king could only hear his voice, and not the words diſtinctly.
The ſenſe of the paſſage was, That the Greeks had done very wrong in
ordaining, that in the inſcriptions en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved on trophies, the names of kings
only ſhould be mentioned; becauſe by theſe means, brave men were robbed
of the glory they had purchaſed with their blood. The king ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
Clytus had let drop ſome diſobliging <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0813600202:254"/>
expreſſions, aſked thoſe who ſat neareſt him, what he had ſaid.
As no one anſwered, Clitus, raiſing his voice by degrees, began to relate
the actions of Philip, and his wars in Greece, prefering them to whatever was
doing at that time; which created a great diſpute between the young and old
men. Though the king was prodigiouſly vexed in his mind, he never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
ſtifled his reſentment, and ſeemed to liſten very patiently to all
Clitus ſpoke to his prejudice. It is probable he would have quite
ſuppreſſed his paſſion, had Clitus ſtopped there; but the latter
growing more and more inſolent as if determined to exaſperate and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
the king, he went ſuch lengths as to defend Parmenio publickly, and to
aſſert, that the deſtroying of Thebes was but trifling, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon
of the victory which Philip had gained over the Athenians; and that the old
Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, though ſometimes unſucceſsful, were greatly ſuperior to
thoſe who were ſo raſh as to deſpiſe them.</p>
            <p>Alexander telling him that in giving cowar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the name of ill
ſucceſs, he was pleading his own cauſe; Clitus riſes up, with his eyes
ſparkling with wine and anger, 
<q rend="inline">"It is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs this hand (ſaid he to him
extending it at the ſame time) that ſaved your life at the 
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0813600202:255"/> battle of Granicus. It is the blood and wounds of
theſe very Macedonians who are accuſed of cowardice, that raiſed you to
this grandeur; but the tragical end of Parmenio ſhews, what reward they and
myſelf may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect for all our ſervices."</q> This laſt reproach ſtung
Alexander, however he ſtill reſtrained his paſſion, and only commanded
him to leave the table. 
<q rend="inline">"He is in the right (ſays Clitus as he roſe up)
not to bear free-born men at his table, who can only tell him truth. He will do
well to paſs his life among barbarians and ſlaves, who will be proud to pay
their adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Perſian girdle and his white robe."</q> But now the
king, no longer able to ſuppreſs his rage, ſnatched a javelin from one of
his guards, and would have killed Clitus on the ſpot, had not the courtiers
with-held his arm, and Clitus been forced but with great difficulty out of the
hall. However he returned into it that moment by another door, ſinging with
an air of inſolence, verſes reflecting highly on the prince, who ſeeing
the general near him, ſtruck him with his javelin, and laid him dead at his
feet, crying out at the ſame time, go now to Philip, to Parmenio and to
Attalus.</p>
            <p>The king had no ſooner murthered his faithful ſervant than he
perceived the atroci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs <pb n="254" facs="tcp:0813600202:256"/> of the act; he threw
himſelf upon the dead body, forced out the javelin and would have deſtroyed
himſelf had he not been prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by his guards, who ſeized and carried
him forcibly to his own apartment, where the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery and the perſuaſions
of his friends at length ſerved to alleviate his remorſe. In order to
di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert his melancholy, Alexander having drawn his army out of the garriſons
where they had wintered three months, marched towards a country called Gabana.
In his way he met with a dreadful ſtorm, in which his army ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
greatly; from thence he went into the country of Sacae, which he ſoon
over-run and laid waſte. Soon after this Axertes one of its monarchs,
received him in his palace, which was adorned with barbarous magnificence. He
had a daughter called Roxana, a young lady whoſe exquiſite beauty was
heightened by all the charms of wit and good ſenſe. Alexander ſound her
charms irreſiſtible, and made her his wife; covering his paſſion with
the ſpecious pretence of uniting the two nations in ſuch bonds as ſhould
improve their mutual har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, by blending their intereſts, and throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
down all diſtinctions between the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors, and the conquered. This
marriage diſpleaſed the Macedonians very much, and <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0813600202:257"/>
exaſperated his chief courtiers, when it was ſeen that he made one of his
ſlaves his father-in-law. But as, after his murdering Clitus, no one dared to
ſpeak to him with freedom, they applauded what he did with their eyes and
countenances, for they had nothing elſe left that was free.</p>
            <p>Alexander having thus conquered all the Perſian provinces, now
with boundleſs ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſolved upon a perilous march into India. This
country was conſidered as the richeſt in the world, not only in gold but in
pearls and preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtones; with which the inhabitants adorned themſelves;
but being willing either to impreſs his ſoldiers with an idea of his
authority, or to imitate the barbarians in the magnificence of their titles, he
was reſolved not only to be called, but to be believed the ſon of Jupiter;
as if it had been poſſible for him to command as abſolutely over the mind
as over the tongue, and that the Macedonians would condeſcend to fall
proſtrate and adore him after the Perſian manner.</p>
            <p>To ſooth and cheriſh theſe ridiculous pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions, there
were not wanting flatterers, thoſe common peſts of a court, who are more
dangerous to princes than the arrows of their enemies. But the Macedonians
indeed would <pb n="256" facs="tcp:0813600202:258"/> not ſtoop to this baſe adulation; all
of them to a man, refuſing to vary in any manner, from the cuſtoms of their
country. Among the number who diſdained to offer theſe baſe adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations,
was Calliſthenes the philoſopher; but his integrity coſt him his life; he
was accuſed of being privy to a conſpiracy formed by Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molaus a young
officer, upon the life of the king, and for this reaſon he was thrown into a
dungeon and loaded with irons, he ſoon found that he had no mercy to expect;
the moſt grievous tortures were inflicted upon him, in order to extort a
confeſſion of guilt, but he perſiſted in his innocence to the laſt,
and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired in the midſt of his torments.</p>
            <p>The kingdom of India for which Alexander now ſet out was an
extenſive territory, which has been uſually divided into two
parts.—India on this ſide and India on the other ſide of the Ganges.
All the Indians at that time were free, nor even did they adopt the baſe
cuſtom of the Greeks, in purchaſing ſlaves to do the common offices of
life. The people of that country were then divided into ſeven claſſes;
the firſt and moſt honourable, though the ſmalleſt, were the guardians
of religion; the ſecond and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, was that of the huſbandman,
whoſe only employment was to cultivate the ground; the <pb n="257" facs="tcp:0813600202:259"/>
third was that of herdſmen and ſhepherds, who led the herds and flocks
among the mountains; the fourth conſiſted of tradeſmen and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants,
among whom pilots and ſeamen were included; the fifth was of ſoldiers,
whoſe only employment was war; the ſixth was of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, who
ſuperintended the actions of others, either in cities or in the country, and
reported the whole to the king; the ſeventh claſs conſiſted of
perſons employed in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick councils, and who ſhared the cares of
go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment with their ſovereign; theſe orders of ſtate never blended nor
intermarried with each other, none of theſe were permitted to follow two
profeſſions at the ſame time, nor quit one claſs for another.</p>
            <p>Alexander having entered India, all the petty kings of the country
came to meet him and make their ſubmiſſions. On his march he took the
city of Nyſa, he then marched to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Daedala and diſperſed his army
over the whole country, and took poſſeſſion of it without
reſiſtance. He afterwards went forward to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the city of Hagoſa, which
after being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged in form, ſurrendered at diſcretion. The rock of
Aornos, which was deemed inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſible and which it was ſaid Hercules
himſelf was not able to take, but the garriſon in a panic 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0813600202:260"/> delivered it up to his army. From thence he marched to
Acleſlimus, and after a march of ſixteen days, arrived on the banks of the
great river Indus, where he found that Hepheſtion had got all things ready
for his paſſage, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuant to the orders he had before received. Here he
was met by Omphis a king of the country, who did homage to Alexander, and made
him a preſent of fifty-ſix elephants, and other animals of prodigious
ſize. The ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors from Abiſaries a neighbouring monarch, came with
the ſame offers, ſent preſents and promiſed fidelity; there was ſtill
a third mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch whoſe name was Porus, from whom Alexander expected ſimilar
ſubmiſſion; he even went to require it of him, but Porus anſwered with
great coldneſs; that while he could fight, he ſhould diſdain to obey.</p>
            <p>In purſuance of this meſſage Alexander re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to enforce
obedience, and giving the ſuperintendance of his elephants to Omphis, who had
now changed his name to Taxilus; he advanced as far as the borders of the
Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſpes. Porus was encamped on the other ſide of it in order to diſpute
the paſſage with him, and had poſted at the head of his army eighty-five
elephants of a prodigious ſize, and behind them three hundred chariots
guarded by <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0813600202:261"/> thirty thouſand foot; not having at moſt
above ſeven thouſand horſe. This prince was mounted upon an elephant of a
much larger ſize than any of the reſt; and he himſelf exceeded the
uſual ſtature of men; ſo that, clothed in his armour, glittering with
gold and ſilver, he appeared at the ſame time terrible and majeſtic. The
greatneſs of his courage equalled that of his ſtature; and he was as wiſe
and prudent as it was poſſible for the monarch of ſo barbarous a people
to be.</p>
            <p>The Macedonians dreaded not only the enemy, but the river they were
obliged to paſs. It was four furlongs wide (about four hundred fathoms) and
ſo deep in every part, that it looked like a ſea, and was no where
fordable. It was vaſtly impetuous, notwithſtanding its great breadth; for
it rolled with as much vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence as if it had been confined to a narrow
channel; and its raging, foaming waves, which broke in many places,
diſcovered that it was full of ſtones and rocks. However, nothing was ſo
dreadful as the appearance of the ſhore, which was quite covered with men,
horſes and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants. Thoſe hideous animals ſtood like ſo many towers;
and the Indians exaſperated them, in order that the horrid cry they made
might fill the enemy with great terror. However, <pb n="258" facs="tcp:0813600202:262"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" resp="#OXF" extent="1 page">

               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:0813600202:264"/> this
could not intimidate an army of men whoſe courage was proof againſt all
attacks, and who were animated by an uninterrupted ſeries of proſperities;
but then they did not think it would be poſſible for them, as the banks
were ſo crazy, to ſurmount the rapidity of the ſtream, or land with
ſafety.</p>
            <p>Alexander was in great perplexity with the difficulties that
attended the paſſage of this nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row river; however, he reſolved to
attempt it by night, and choſe one whoſe lightening, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and
impetuous winds, conſpired to drown the noiſe of his troops in their
embarkation. Scarce any perſon appeared to oppoſe their deſcent; and the
moment Alexander was landed, he drew up the forces that had paſſed with
him, conſiſting of ſix thouſand foot, and five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſe, in
order of battle.</p>
            <p>Porus, upon hearing that Alexander had paſſed the river, had
ſent againſt him a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, commanded by one of his ſons, of two
thouſand horſe, and one hundred and twenty chariots. Alexander imagined
them at firſt to be the enemy's van-guard, and that the whole army was behind
them; but being informed it was but a detachment, he charged them with ſuch
vigour, that Porus's ſon was killed upon the ſpot, with four hundred
horſes, and all the chariots were taken.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:0813600202:265"/> Porus, upon receiving advice of the death of
his ſon, the defeat of the detachment, and of Alexander's approach,
reſolved to go and meet Alexander, whom he juſtly ſuppoſed to be at the
head of the choiceſt troops of his army. Accordingly, leaving only a few
elephants in his camp, to amuſe thoſe who were poſted on the oppoſite
ſhore, he ſet out, with thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot, four thouſand horſe,
three thouſand chariots, and two hundred elephants. Being come into a firm,
ſandy ſoil, in which his horſes and chariots might wheel about with
eaſe, he drew up his army in battle-array, with an intent to wait the coming
up of the enemy. He poſted in front, and on the firſt line, all the
elephants, at a hundred feet diſtance one from the other; in order that they
might ſerve as a bulwark to his foot, who were behind. It was his opinion,
that the enemy's cavalry would not dare to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in theſe intervals,
becauſe of the fear thoſe horſes would have of the elephants; and much
leſs the infantry, when they ſhould ſee that of the enemy poſted behind
the elephants, and in danger of being trod to pieces. He had poſted ſome of
his foot on the ſame line with the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants, in order to cover their right
and left; and this infantry was covered by his two wings of horſe; before
which the chariots were poſted. <pb n="262" facs="tcp:0813600202:266"/> Such was the order and
diſpoſition of Porus's army.</p>
            <p>Alexander being come in ſight of the enemy, waited the coming up
of his foot, which marched with the utmoſt diligence, and arrived a little
after; and in order that they might have time to take breath, and not to be
led, as they were very much fatigued, againſt the enemy, he cauſed his
horſe to make a great many evo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions, in order to gain time. But now every
thing being ready, and the infantry having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently recovered their
vigour, Alexander gave the ſignal of battle. He did not think proper to begin
by attacking the enemy's main body, where the infantry and the elephants were
poſted, for the very reaſon which had made Porus draw them up in that
manner. But his cavalry being ſtronger, he drew out the greateſt part of
them, and marching againſt the left wing, ſent Coenus, with his own
regiment of horſe, and that of Demetrius, to charge them at the ſame time;
ordering him to attack that cavalry on the left behind, during which he
himſelf would charge them both in front and flank. Seleucus, Antigonus, and
Tauron, who commanded the foot, were ordered not to ſtir from their poſts,
till Alexander's cavalry had put that of the enemy, as well as their foot, into
diſorder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:0813600202:267"/> Being come within arrow-ſhot, he detached a
thouſand bow-men on horſeback, with orders for them to make their
diſcharge on the horſe of Porus's left wing, in order to throw it into
diſorder, whilſt he himſelf would charge this body in flank, before it
had time to rally. The Indians having joined again their ſquadrons, and drawn
them up into a narrower compaſs, advanced againſt Alexander. At that
inſtant Coenus charged them in the rear, according to the orders given him;
inſomuch, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were obliged to face about on all ſides, to
defend themſelves from the thouſand bow-men, and againſt Alexander and
Coenus. Alexander, to make the beſt advantage of the confuſion into which
this ſudden attack had thrown them, charged with great vigour thoſe that
had made head againſt him; who being no longer able to ſtand ſo violent
an attack, were ſoon broke, and retired behind the elephants, as to an
impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable rampart. The leaders of the elephants made them advance againſt
the enemy's horſe; but, that very inſtant, the Macedonian phalanx moving on
a ſudden, ſurrounded thoſe animals, and charged with their pikes the
elephants themſelves, and their leaders. This battle was very different from
all thoſe which Alexander had hitherto fought; for the elephants ruſhing 
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0813600202:268"/> upon the battalions, broke, with inexpreſſible fury,
the thickeſt of them; when the Indian horſe, ſeeing the Macedonian foot
ſtopped by the elephants, returned to the charge: however, that of Alexander
being ſtronger, and having greater experience in war, broke this body a
ſecond time, and obliged it to retire towards the elephants; upon which the
Macedonian horſe, being all united in one body, ſpread terror and
confuſion wherever they attacked. The elephants, being all covered with
wounds, and the greateſt part having loſt their leaders, did not obſerve
their uſual order; but, diſtracted as it were with pain, no longer
diſtinguiſhed friends from foes; but, running about from place to place,
they overthrew every thing that came in their way. The Macedonians, who had
pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely left a greater interval between their bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talions, either made way
for them whenever they came forward, or charged with darts, thoſe that fear
and the tumult obliged to retire. Alexander, after having ſurrounded the
enemy with his horſe, made a ſignal to his foot to march up with all
imaginable ſpeed, in order to make a laſt effort, and to fall upon them
with his whole force; all which they executed very ſucceſsfully. In this
manner the greateſt part of the Indian cavalry were cut to pieces; and a 
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0813600202:269"/> body of their foot, which ſuſtained no
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſs loſs, ſeeing themſelves
charged on all ſides, at laſt fled. Catorus, who had continued in the camp
with the reſt of his army, ſeeing Alexander en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged with Porus,
croſſed the river, and charging the routed ſoldiers with his troops, who
were cool and vigorous, by that means killed as many enemies in the retreat, as
had fallen in the battle.</p>
            <p>The Indians loſt, on this occaſion, twenty thouſand foot, and
three thouſand horſe; not to mention the chariots, which were all broke to
pieces; and the elephants, that were either killed or taken. Porus's two ſons
fell in this battle; with Spitacus, governor of the province; all the colonels
of horſe and foot; and thoſe who guided the elephants and chariots. As for
Alexander, he loſt but fourſcore of the ſix thouſand ſoldiers who
were at the firſt charge; ten bow-men of the horſe, twenty of his
horſe-guards, and two hundred common ſoldiers.</p>
            <p>Porus, after having performed all the duty both of a ſoldier and a
general in the battle, and fought with incredible bravery, ſeeing all his
horſe defeated, and the greateſt part of his foot, did not behave like the
great Darius, who, in a like diſaſter, was the firſt that fled: on the
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he continued in the field as long as one <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0813600202:270"/>
battalion or ſquadron ſtood their ground; but, at laſt, having received a
wound in the ſhoulder, he retired upon his elephant; and was eaſily
diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, by the greatneſs of his ſtature, and his
unparelleled bravery. Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander finding who he was, by thoſe glorious marks,
and being deſirous of ſaving this king, ſent Taxilus after him, becauſe
he was of the ſame nation. The latter, advancing as near to him as he might,
without running any danger of being wounded, called out to him to ſtop, in
order to hear the meſſage he had brought him from Alexander. Porus turning
back, and ſeeing it was Taxilus, his old enemy, 
<q rend="inline">"How!" ſays he, "is it not Taxilus that calls;
that traitor to his country and kingdom!"</q> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after which, he
would have transfixed him with his dart, had he not inſtantly retired.
Notwithſtanding this, Alexander was ſtill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to ſave ſo brave
a prince; and thereupon diſpatched other officers, among whom was Meroe, one
of his intimate friends, who beſought him, in the ſtrongeſt terms, to
wait upon a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror altogether worthy of him: after much entreaty, Porus
conſented, and accordingly ſet forward. Alexander, who had been told of his
coming, advanced forwards, in order to receive him, with ſome of his train.
Being come pretty <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0813600202:271"/> near, Alexander ſtopped, purpoſely
to take a view of his ſtature and noble mien, he being about five cubits in
height. Porus did not ſeem dejected at his misfortune; but came up with a
reſolute countenance, like a valiant warrior, whoſe courage in defending
his dominions ought to acquire him the eſteem of the brave prince who had
taken him priſoner. Alexander ſpoke firſt; and, with an auguſt and
gracious air, aſked him how he deſired to be treated? 
<q rend="inline">"Like a king," replied Porus.</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"But," continued Alexander, "do you aſk nothing
more?"</q> 
               <q rend="inline">"No," replied Porus; "all things are included in
that ſingle word."</q> Alexander, ſtruck with this greatneſs of ſoul,
the magnanimity of which ſeemed heightened by diſtreſs, did not only
reſtore him his kingdom, but annexed other provinces to it, and treated him
with the higheſt teſtimonies of honour, eſteem, and friendſhip. Porus
was faithful to him till his death.—It is hard to ſay, whether the
victor or the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed beſt deſerved praiſe on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>Alexander built a city on the ſpot where the battle had been
fought; and another in that place where he had croſſed the river. He called
the one Nicaea, from his victory; and the other Bucephalus, in honour of his
horſe, who died there, not of his wounds, but of old age. After 
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0813600202:272"/> having paid the laſt duties to ſuch of his
ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers as had loſt their lives in battle, he ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed games and
offered up ſacrifices of thanks in the place where he had paſſed the
Hydeſpes.</p>
            <p>Alexander having now conquered Porus, advanced into India, which
having never been a warlike nation, he ſubdued with the rapidity rather of a
traveller than a conqueror. Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs petty ſtates ſubmitted to him,
ſenſible that his ſtay would be ſhort, and his conqueſts
evaneſcent.</p>
            <p>Alexander, paſſing near a city where ſeveral Brachmans or
Indian prieſts dwelt, was very deſirous to converſe with them, and if
poſſible to prevail with ſome of them to follow him. Being informed that
theſe philoſophers never made viſits, but that thoſe who had an
inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſee them muſt go to their houſes, he concluded, that it
would be beneath his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to go to them; and not juſt to force theſe
ſages to any thing contrary to their laws and uſages. Oneſicritus, the
philoſopher, who had been a diſciple of Diogenes the Cynick, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted
to them. He met not far from the city fifteen Boxamins, who from morning till
even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtood always naked, in the ſame poſture in which they at firſt
had placed themſelves, and <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0813600202:273"/> afterwards returned to the
city at night. He addreſſed himſelf firſt to Calanus an Indian,
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the wiſeſt man of his country, who, though he profeſſed the
practice of the moſt ſevere philoſophy, had however been perſuaded in
his extreme old age to attend upon the court; and him he told the occaſion of
his coming. The later gazing upon Oneſicritus's clothes and ſhoes, could
not forbear laughing; after which he told him, 
<q rend="inline">"That anciently the earth had been covered with
barley and wheat, as it was at that time with duſt, that beſides water, the
rivers uſed to flow with milk, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, oil and wine."</q> That man's guilt
had occaſioned a change of this happy condition; and that Jupiter, to
puniſh their ingratitude, had ſentenced them to a long painful labour. That
their repentance afterwards moving him to compaſſion, he had reſtored
them their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer abundance; however, that by the courſe of things, they
ſeemed to be returning to their ancient confuſion. This relation ſhews
evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, that theſe philoſophers, had ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the felicity of
the firſt man and of the evil to which he had been ſentenced for his
ſins.</p>
            <p> Oneſicritus was very urgent with both of them to quit their
auſtere way of life and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <pb n="270" facs="tcp:0813600202:274"/> the fortune of
Alexander, ſaying, 
<q rend="inline">"That they would find in him a generous maſter and
benefactor, who would heap upon them honour and riches of all kinds."</q> Then
Mandanis aſſuming a haughty philoſophical tone, anſwered, 
<q rend="inline">"That he did not want Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, and was the ſon
of Jupiter as well as himſelf. That he was exempted from want, deſire or
fear. That ſo long as he ſhould live, the earth would furniſh him with
all things neceſſary for his ſubſiſtence, and that death would rid
him of a troubleſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion (meaning his body) and ſet him at full
liberty."</q> Calodanus appeared more tractable, and notwithſtanding the
oppoſition, and even the prohibition of his ſuperior, who reproached him
for his abject ſpirit in ſtooping ſo low as to ſerve another maſter
beſides God, he followed Oneſicritus, and went to Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's court, who
received him with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations of joy. As it was Alexander's chief
ambition to imitate Bacchus and Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cules in their expeditions into the Eaſt,
he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved like them to penetrate as long as he could meet new nations to
conquer, however his ſoldiers ſatiated with ſpoil and fatigued with
repeated encounters, at laſt began to open their eyes at the wildneſs of
his ambition. <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0813600202:275"/> Some bewailed their calamities in ſuch
terms as raiſed compaſſion, others inſolently cried out, 
<q rend="inline">"That they would march no further;"</q> the chief
object of the King's wiſhes, was to invade the territories of Agramenes, a
prince who lived beyond the great river Ganges; and who was able to bring into
the field two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand foot, two thouſand elephants, twenty
thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſe, and two thouſand armed chariots. The ſoldiers however
refuſed to wander over thoſe great deſerts that lay beyond the Ganges,
and more terrible to them than the greateſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my the Eaſt could muſter;
he addreſſed them in the moſt perſuaſive terms not to leave their
general behind; he threatened them, that he would take his Scythian and his
Perſian ſoldiers, and with them alone he would make conqueſts worthy of
his name and of his glory; but ſtill the Macedonian ſoldiers, perſiſted
ſullen and inflexible, and only at laſt complied after many perſuaſive
orations to follow him towards the South, to diſcover the neareſt ocean,
and to take the courſe of the river Indus as their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible guide.</p>
            <p>For this expedition he embarked in a fleet conſiſting of eight
hundred veſſels as well gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies as boats, to carry the troops and
proviſions, after five days ſailing, the fleet arrived where 
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0813600202:276"/> the Hydeſpes and the Aceſines mixed their ſtreams,
there the ſhips were very much ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, becauſe theſe rivers unite
with prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous rapidity. At laſt he came to the country of the Oxydrace and
the Mallis, the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant people in the Eaſt, however Alexander
defeated them in ſeveral engagements, diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed them of their
ſtrong holds, and at laſt marched againſt their capital city, where the
greateſt part of their forces were retired. It was upon this occaſion that
ſeizing a ſcaling ladder, himſelf the firſt, he mounted the wall,
followed only by two of his officers; his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants believing him to be in
danger, mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſwiftly to ſuccour him, but the ladder break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was
left alone. It was now that his raſhneſs became his ſafety, for leaping
from the wall into the city which was crouded with enemies, ſword in hand, he
repulſed ſuch as were neareſt, and even killed the general who advanced
in the throng. Thus with his back to a tree that happened to be near, he
received all the darts of the enemy in a ſhield, and kept even the boldeſt
at a diſtance at laſt an Indian diſcharging an arrow of three feet long,
it pierced his coat of mail and his right breaſt, and ſo great a quantity
of blood iſſued from the wound, that he dropped his <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0813600202:277"/>
arms and lay as dead. The Indian came to ſtrip him, ſuppoſing him really
what he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared; but Alexander that inſtant recalled his ſpirits and
plunged the dagger in his ſide. By this time a part of the king's attendants
came to his ſuccour, and forming themſelves round his body, till his
ſoldiers without found means of burſting the gates, ſaved him, and put
all the inhabitants without diſtinction to the ſword.</p>
            <p>The wound which at firſt ſeemed dangerous, having in the ſpace
of ſix or ſeven days a moſt favourable appearance, Alexander mounted his
horſe, and ſhewed himſelf to the army, who ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to view him with
inſatiable pleaſure. Thus continuing his voyage, and ſubduing the country
on each ſide as he paſſed along, the pilots per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the
ſoftneſs of the breezes that the ocean was near. Nothing ſo much
aſtoniſhed the Macedonian ſoldiers as the ebbing and flowing of the tide.
They were amazed when they ſaw it riſe to a great height and overflow the
country, which they conſidered as a mark of divine reſentment; they were no
leſs terrified ſome hours after, when they ſaw the river for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake its
banks, and leave thoſe lands uncovered it had ſo lately overflowed. Thus,
after a voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of nine months, he at laſt ſtood upon the ſhore; and
after having offered ſacrifices to <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0813600202:278"/> Neptune, and having
looked wiſhfully on the broad expanſe of waters before him, he is ſaid to
have wept for having no more worlds left to conquer. Here he put an end to his
excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; and having appointed Nearchus admiral of his fleet, with orders
to coaſt along the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian ſhore as far as the Perſian gulph, he ſet
out with his army for Babylon.</p>
            <p>Nothing could exceed the hardſhips which his army ſuſtained in
their return: paſſing through a country deſtitute of all ſorts of
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, they were obliged to feaſt on the beaſts of burden, and were
forced to burn thoſe rich ſpoils for the ſake of which they had
encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſo many dangers; thoſe diſeaſes alſo, that generally
accompany famine, compleated their calamity, and deſtroyed them in great
numbers. After a march of threeſcore days, they arrived in the province of
Gedroſia, the fertility of which ſoon baniſhed from the minds of the
ſoldiery all their former difficulties. Alexander paſſed through the
country, not with the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary pomp of a conqueror, but in the licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
diſguiſe of an enthuſiaſt: ſtill willing to imitate Bacchus, he was
drawn by eight horſes, on a ſcaffold in the form of a ſquare ſtage,
where he paſſed the days and nights in feaſting. Along the roads where he
paſſed were placed <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0813600202:279"/> caſks of wine in great
abundance, and theſe the ſoldiery drained in honour of his mock deity. The
whole country echoed with the ſound of inſtruments and the howling of
bach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anals, who with their hair diſhevelled, with frantic mirth, ran up and
down, abandoning themſelves to every kind of lewdneſs. This vice produced
one of a much more formidable nature in the king's mind; for it always
en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed his paſſions to cruelty, and the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner generally followed
the feaſt.</p>
            <p>While he refreſhed his army in theſe parts, Nearchus was
returned from his expedition along the coaſt, and brought him ſtrange
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of the gold to be found in ſome iſlands, and of the wonders that
were to be ſeen in others; he was therefore commanded to make ſome further
diſcoveries; and then enter the mouth of the river Euphrates, to meet the
king at Babylon. He here alſo executed an act of rigorous juſtice upon
Cleander and others, who had formerly been the miniſters of his ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance in
cutting off Parmenio. Againſt theſe murtherers great complaints had been
made by the deputies of the provinces in which they had commanded; and ſuch
was the complexion of their crimes, that nothing but the certain expectation of
Alexander's never returning from <pb n="276" facs="tcp:0813600202:280"/> India, could encourage
them to commit ſuch. All men were glad to ſee them delivered over to
juſtice. Cleander, with ſix hundred ſoldiers, whom he had employed, were
publickly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted; every one rejoicing, that the anger of the king was at
laſt turned againſt the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of his vengeance. As Alexander drew
near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Babylon, he viſited the tomb of Cyrus, in the city of Paſargada;
and here he put a Perſian prince, whoſe name was Orſines, to death, at
the inſtigation of Bagoas, an eunuch, who falſely accuſed Orſines of
robbing the tomb; here alſo, Calanus, the Indian, having lived four-ſcore
and three years, without ever having been afflicted with ſickneſs, now
feeling the approaches of diſorder, reſolved to put himſelf to death.
Alexander imagined he might eaſily be diſſuaded from his deſign; but
finding, in oppoſition to all the arguments he could uſe, that Calanus was
inflexible, he gave orders for erecting a funeral pile for him, upon which the
Indian was reſolved to die.</p>
            <p>Calanus rode on horſeback to the foot of the funeral pile; offered
up his prayers to the gods; cauſed libations to be performed, and the reſt
of the ceremonies to be obſerved which are practiſed at funerals; cut off a
tuft of his hair, in imitation of victims; embraced ſuch 
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0813600202:281"/> of his friends as were preſent; intreated them to be
merry that day, and to feaſt and carouſe with Alexander; aſſuring them,
at the ſame time, that he would ſoon ſee that prince in Babylon. After
ſaying theſe words, he aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with the utmoſt chearfulneſs, the
fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neeral pile, laid himſelf down upon it, and covered his face; and, when
the flame reached him, he did not make the leaſt motion; but with a patience
and conſtancy that ſurpriſed the whole army, continued in the ſame
poſture in which he at firſt had laid himſelf, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated his
ſacrifice, by dying agreeably to the ſtrange ſuperſtitions of the
enthuſiaſts of his country. Alexander punctually obeyed him in his
admonitions to debauchery. A banquet followed the night after, in which
Promacus received a talent as a prize, for having drank the largeſt quantity
of wine; he ſurvived his victory, however, but three days, and of the reſt
of the gueſts, forty-one died of their intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance. From Paſargada,
Alexander proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Suſa, where he married Statira, the eldeſt daughter
of Darius, and gave her youngeſt ſiſter in marriage to his favourite
Hepheſtion. Fourſcore Perſian ladies of rank were given to the principal
favourites among his captains. The nuptials were ſolemnized after the
Perſian <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0813600202:282"/> manner. He likewiſe feaſted all the
Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians, who had married before in that country. It is related, that there
were nine thouſand gueſts at this feaſt, and that he gave each of them a
golden cup for their libations. Upon this occaſion, there appeared at Suſa,
three hundred young ſoldiers, dreſſed in the Macedonian manner, whom
Alexander intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed particularly to favour, in order to check the
licentiouſneſs of his veterans, who had but too juſt reaſons to
murmur.</p>
            <p>While Alexander was thus employed in Perſia, a new commotion was
carrying on in Greece. Harpalus, whom Alexander had appointed go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of
Babylon, being diſguſted with his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's cruelty, and ambitious of
power himſelf, went over into Greece, with immenſe ſums, which he
raiſed from the plundered priſoners of Perſia. He had credit enough to
aſſemble a body of ſix thouſand ſoldiers, and with theſe he landed
at Athens: money, at that time, being thought all-powerful in Greece, he
laviſhed immenſe ſums among the mercenary orators, whoſe buſineſs
it was to inflame the minds of the people. Of all theſe, Phocion alone, to
whom he offered ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred talents, preſerved his well-known integrity,
and remained inflexible; his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſtedneſs had long been the object
of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, <pb n="279" facs="tcp:0813600202:283"/> even in the time of Philip. Being
offered a great ſum of money, if not for his own acceptance, at leaſt for
the benefit of his children: If my children, cried Phocion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble me, the
little ſpot of ground, with the produce of which I have hitherto lived, and
which has raiſed me to the glory you mention, will be ſufficient to
maintain them; if it will not, I do not intend to leave them wealth, merely to
ſtimulate and heighten their luxury. Alexander having likewiſe ſent him
an hundred talents, Phocion aſked thoſe who brought them, why Alexander
ſent him ſo great a ſum, and did not remit any to the reſt of the
Athenians? It is, replied they, becauſe Alexander looks upon you as the only
juſt and virtuous man. Phocion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, let him ſuffer me ſtill to
enjoy that character, and be really what I am taken for. This, therefore, was
not a character to be corrupted; on the contrary, he uſed all his influence
to prevent the ſucceſs of Harpalus, who being ordered by the aſſembly
to depart the city, loſt all hopes of ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>This commotion was ſcarcely quelled when another enſued, in
conſequence of a declaration, by which all the Macedonians, who from their
age or infirmities were unable to bear the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues <pb n="280" facs="tcp:0813600202:284"/> of
war, ſhould be ſent back to Greece. They with ſeditious cries
unanimouſly demanded to be entirely diſcharged from his ſervice,
mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring againſt him as a deſpiſer of his braveſt troops, and as a
cruel king, who wanted not their abſence but their deſtruction. Alexander,
however, acted with that reſolution upon this occaſion, which always marked
his character. Being ſeated on his tribunal of juſtice, he ruſhed among
the principal mutineers, ſeized thirteen, and ordered them to be immediately
puniſhed. The ſoldiers, amazed at his intrepidity, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held their
complaints, and with down-caſt eyes ſeemed to beg for mercy. You deſired
a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge, cried he: go then, and publiſh to the world that you have
left your prince to the mercy of ſtrangers; from henceforth, the Perſians
ſhall be my guards. This menace ſerved only to increaſe the miſery and
the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation of his troops; they attended him with tears and
lamentations, till at laſt, ſoftened by their penitence, he once more took
them into favour and affection.</p>
            <p>Now ſecure from inſurrection, he gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to mirth and
feaſting; his army was ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by all the miniſters of pleaſure; he
ſpent whole nights and days in immoderate drinking, and in one of thoſe
exceſſes, Hepheſtion loſt <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0813600202:285"/> his life. This
courtier was the moſt intimate friend of Alexander. Craterus alone, of all
the Macedonians ſeemed to diſpute this honour with him. Craterus, as the
king uſed to ſay, loves the king, but Hepheſtion loves Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander. The
death of this favourite threw the monarch into exceſſive ſorrow; he
ſeemed to receive no conſolation; he even put to death the phyſician who
attended him, and the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary funeral honours celebrated at his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
in Babylon, marked the greatneſs of his affliction.</p>
            <p>After various combats, conqueſts, cruelties, follies, and
exceſſes, Alexander arrived at Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon; the Chaldeans, who pretended to
fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee future events, attempted to perſuade him not to enter that city.
The Greek philoſophers on the other hand, diſplayed the futility of their
predictions. Babylon was a theatre for him to diſplay his glory in; and
ambaſſadors from all the nations he had conquered were there in
rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs to celebrate his triumphs. After mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a moſt magnificent
entry, he gave audience to the ambaſſadors, with a grandeur and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
ſuitable to his power, yet with the affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and politeneſs of a private
courtier.</p>
            <p>At that time he wrote a letter, which was to have been read
publickly in the aſſembly at <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0813600202:286"/> the Olympic-games,
whereby the ſeveral cities of Greece were commanded to permit all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iles to
return into their native country, thoſe excepted, who had committed
ſacrilege, or any other crime deſerving death; ordering An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipater to
employ an armed force againſt ſuch cities as ſhould refuſe to obey.
This letter was read in the aſſembly. But the Athenians and Etolians did
not think themſelves obliged to put orders in execution which ſeemed to
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with their liberty.</p>
            <p>Finding Babylon, in extent and conveniency, ſuperior to all the
other cities of the Eaſt, he reſolved to make it the ſeat of his empire;
and for that purpoſe was deſirous of adding to it all the ornaments
poſſible. But though he was much employed in projects of this kind, and in
ſchemes even beyond human power to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute, he ſpent the greateſt part
of his time in ſuch pleaſures as this magnificent city afforded. He was
often preſent at new banquets, where he drank with his uſual intemperance.
On a particular occaſion, having ſpent the whole night in a debauch, a
ſecond was propoſed: he accepted the invitation, and drank to ſuch
exceſs, that, he fell upon the floor, dead to appearance; and in this
lifeleſs man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was carried, a ſad ſpectacle of debauchery, 
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0813600202:287"/> to his palace. The fever continued, with ſome
intervals, in which he gave the neceſſary orders for the ſailing of the
fleet, and the marching of his land forces, being perſuaded he ſhould
ſoon recover. But at laſt finding himſelf paſt all hopes, and his voice
beginning to fail, he gave his ring to Perdiccas, with orders to convey his
corpſe to the temple of Ammon. He ſtruggled however with death for ſome
time, and raiſing himſelf upon his elbow, he gave his hand to the
ſoldiers, who preſſed to kiſs it; being then aſked to whom he would
leave his empire, he anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, To the moſt worthy. Perdiccas enquiring at
what time he ſhould pay him divine honours, he replied, When you are happy.
With theſe words he expired, being thirty-two years and eight months old, of
which he had reigned twelve, with more fortune than virtue.</p>
            <p>In whatever light we view this monarch, we ſhall have little to
admire, and leſs to imitate. That courage for which he was celebrated, is but
a ſubordinate virtue; that fortune which ſtill attended him, was but an
accidental ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; that diſcipline which prevailed in his army, was
produced and cultivated by his father; but his intemperance, his cruelty, his
vanity, his paſſion for uſeleſs conqueſts, were all his own. His
victories however, ſerved to <pb n="284" facs="tcp:0813600202:288"/> crown the pyramid of
Grecian glory; they ſerved to ſhew, to what a degree the arts of peace can
promote thoſe of war. In this pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, we view a combination of petty
ſtates by the arts of refinement, growing more than a match for the reſt of
the world united; and leaving mankind an example of ſuperiority of intellect
over brutal force. After the death of this monarch, Greece was rather
conſidered as a ſeminary for the education and promotion of the laws of
other nations, than a confederacy for enforcing and promulgating her own. The
ſucceſſors of Alexander ſeized upon particular parts of his extenſive
empire; and what he gained with much fatigue and danger, became a prey to men
who ſheltered their ambition under the ſanction and glory of his name. They
had been taught by him a leſſon of pride; and as he would never ſuffer an
equal, his numerous ſucceſſors could not think of admitting a ſuperior.
They continued their diſputes for dominion until in ſome meaſure they
deſtroyed each other; and as no governments were ever worſe conducted than
their's, ſo no period of hiſtory was ever left in ſuch darkneſs, doubt,
and confuſion.</p>
