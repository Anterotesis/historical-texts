            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Deſire of ſhewing Miſs REYNOLDS to Advantage, was the firſt Motive for attempting an Alteration of WYCHERLEY'S COUNTRY WIFE. Tho' near half of the following Play is new written, the Alterer claims no Merit, but his Endeavour to clear one of our moſt celebrated Comedies from Immorality and Obſcenity. He thought himſelf bound to preſerve as much of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal, as could be preſented to an Audience of theſe Times without Offence; and if this Wanton of CHARLES'S Days is now ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, as to become innocent without being inſiped, the preſent Editor will not think his Time ill employed, which has enabled him to add ſome little Variety to the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Publick. There ſeems indeed an abſolute Neceſſity for reforming many Plays of our moſt eminent Writers: For no kind of Wit ought to be received as an Excuſe for for Immorality, nay it becomes ſtill more dangerous in proportion as it is more witty—Without ſuch a Reformation, our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies muſt be reduced to a very ſmall Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and would pall by a too frequent Repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, or what is worſe, continue ſhameleſs in ſpite of publick Diſapprobation.</p>
            <p>Whatever fate this Play may have in the Cloſet, it is much indebted to the Prefor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers for its favourable Reception upon the Stage.</p>

                  <p>What, my old friend Jack Moody! by thy long abſence from the town, the grumneſs of thy coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and the ſlovenlyneſs of thy habit, I ſhould give thee joy—you are certainly married.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Moody.</speaker>
                  <p>My long ſtay in the country will excuſe my dreſs, and I have a ſuit of law, that brings me up to town, and puts me out of humour—beſides, I muſt give Sparkiſh ten thouſand pounds to-morrow to take my ſiſter off my hands.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Harc.</speaker>
                  <p>Your ſiſter is very much obliged to you—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo much older than her, you have taken upon you the authority of a father, and have engaged her to a coxcomb.</p>

                  <speaker>Moody.</speaker>
                  <p>I have, and to oblige her—nothing but cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combs, or debauchees are the favourites now-a-days, and a coxcomb is rather the more innocent animal of the two.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Harc.</speaker>
                  <p>She has ſenſe, and taſte, and can't like him; ſo you muſt anſwer for the conſequences.</p>

                  <p>When ſhe is out of my hands, her huſband muſt look to conſequences. He's a faſhionable fool, and will cut his horns kindly.</p>

                  <p>And what is to ſecure your worſhip from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences—I did not expect marriage from ſuch a rake—one that knew the town ſo well: fye, fye, Jack.</p>

                  <p>That's all one—that grave circumſpection in marrying a country wife, is like refuſing a deceitful, pamper'd, Smithfield-jade, to go and be cheated by a friend in the country.</p>

                  <p>She has little beauty but her youth, nothing to brag of but her health, and no attraction but her modeſty—wholeſome, homely, and houſewifely—that's all.</p>

                  <p>What do you call him Bud for? Bud means huſband, and he is not your huſband yet—and I hope never will be—and if he was my huſband, I'd bud him, a ſurly unreaſonable beaſt.</p>

                  <p>Yes, you, to be ſure. Tell the dear object of my affections, I live but upon the hopes that ſhe is not married; and when thoſe hopes leave me—ſhe knows the reſt—then he caſt up his eyes thus—gnaſh'd his teeth—ſtruck his forehead—would have ſpoke again, but could not—fetch'd a deep ſigh, and vaniſh'd.</p>

                  <p>Ay, but Mr. Belville—I am as good as married already—my guardian has contracted me, and there wants nothing but church ceremony to make us one—I call him huſband, and he calls me wife already: He made me do ſo;—and we had been married in church long ago, if the writings could have been finiſhed.</p>

I have heard this diſtemper call'd a fever, but methinks it is liker an ague; for, when I think of my guardian, I tremble, and am in a cold ſweat; but when I think of my gallant, dear Mr. Belville, my hot fit comes, and I am all in a fever indeed: my own chamber is tedious to me, and I would fain be remov'd to his, and then methinks I ſhou'd be very well. Ah! poor Mr. Belville! Well, I cannot, will not ſtay here; therefore I'll make an end of my letter to him, which ſhall be a finer letter than my laſt, becauſe I have ſtudied it like any thing.

                  <p>How dare you look me in the face, Bud? Have you not given me to another, when you ought to have married me yourſelf? Have not you pretended to be married to me, when you knew in your conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence you was not?—And have not you been ſhilly ſhally for a long time? So that if I had not married dear Mr. Belville, I ſhould not have married at all—ſo I ſhould not.</p>

                  <p>I'm ſtupify'd with ſhame, rage, and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment—my fate has o'ercome me—I can ſtruggle no more with it. <stage>[ſighs.]</stage> What is left me?—I cannot bear to look, or be look'd upon—I will hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry down to my old houſe; take a twelvemonth's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion into it—cut down my draw-bridge, run wild about my garden, which ſhall grow as wild as myſelf—then will I curſe the world, and every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual in it—and when my rage and ſpirits fail me, I will be found dead among the nettles and thiſtles; a woeful example of the baſeneſs and treachery of one ſex, and of the falſehood, lying perjury, deceit, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and—damnation of the other.</p>

Bud was ſo paſſionate, and grown ſo thrifty,</l>
                  <l>Twas a ſad Lift!—and then, he was near fifty!</l>
