            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

SO much for <hi>Dreſs</hi> and <hi>Figure;</hi> now I ſhall proceed to the more difficult and phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical Parts of the Character, and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the <hi>Action, Speaking</hi> and <hi>Conception</hi> of our <hi>modern Heroe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE firſt Words of the Part,—<hi>So foul and fair a Day I have not ſeen,</hi> in my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion are ſpoke wrong; <hi>Mackbeth</hi> before his Entrance has been in a great Storm of Rain, Thunder, &amp;c. Now as the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence have been appriz'd of this, by the three<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Witches, he ſhould very <hi>empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically</hi> deſcribe the quick Tranſition from being <hi>wet to the Skin,</hi> to being almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneouſly <hi>dry'd again:</hi> Tho' I can't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey in Writing the Manner how it <hi>ſhould</hi> be ſpoke, yet every Reader may compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how it <hi>ought</hi> to be ſpoke, and know that in the Manner it is <hi>now</hi> ſpoke, the Sentiment is <hi>languid, unintelligible,</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcriptive.</hi> I ſhall now examine the moſt remarkable Scene in the whole Play, which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0246902000:18"/>
is that of the <hi>Air-drawn Dagger.</hi> This I ſhall make appear he has miſtook from the Beginning to the End.—<hi>Macbeth,</hi> as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for this Viſion, is ſo prepoſſeſs'd, from his Humanity, with the Horror of the Deed, which by his more prevailing Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition he is incited to, and for the Perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration of which, he lies under a promiſſary Injunction to his Lady, that his Mind being torn by theſe different and confus'd Ideas, his Senſes fail, and preſent that <hi>fatal Agent</hi> of his Cruelty,—the <hi>Dagger,</hi> to him:—Now in this viſionary Horror, he ſhould not rivet his Eyes to an <hi>imaginary</hi> Object, as if it <hi>really</hi> was there, but ſhould ſhew an <hi>unſettled Motion</hi> in his Eye, like one not quite awak'd from ſome diſordering Dream; his <hi>Hands</hi> and <hi>Fingers</hi> ſhould not be <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable,</hi> but <hi>reſtleſs,</hi> and endeavouring to diſperſe the Cloud that over ſhadows his optick Ray, and bedims his Intellects; here would be Confuſion, Diſorder, and Agony! <hi>Come let me clutch thee!</hi> is not to be done by <hi>one</hi> Motion only, but by ſeveral <hi>ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Catches</hi> at it, firſt with one Hand, and
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0246902000:19"/>
then with the other, preſerving the ſame Motion, at the ſame Time, with his Feet, like a Man, who out of his Depth, and half drowned in his Struggles, <hi>catches</hi> at <hi>Air</hi> for <hi>Subſtance:</hi> This would make the Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator's Blood run cold, and he would almoſt feel the Agonies of the Murderer himſelf. I have ſpoke of the Scene following the Murder, in my <hi>Eſſay on Acting,</hi> and ſhall only ſay, that the <hi>Daggers</hi> are near an Inch and half too long, in Proportion to the Heighth of the Murderer. The Night-Gown, he appears in, after the Murder, ought to be a <hi>Red Damask,</hi> and not the frippery<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flower'd one of a <hi>Foppington;</hi> but when <hi>Taſte</hi> is wanting in <hi>Trifles,</hi> and <hi>Judgment</hi> in <hi>Eſſentials,</hi> how can we hope to ſee the THEATRE flouriſh? I muſt make a Remark upon him in the <hi>Banquet Scene,</hi> which is the moſt glaring Abſurdity that ever was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by an Actor: When <hi>Banquo</hi>'s Ghoſt gets Poſſeſſion of <hi>Macbeth</hi>'s Chair, and the latter, frighted at his Appearance, by Words and Actions, ſays, <hi>Which of you have done this?</hi> Meaning the Murder of <hi>Banquo;</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0246902000:20"/>
here the Actor ſhould addreſs himſelf to the <hi>Gueſts,</hi> and not keep a <hi>fix'd Eye</hi> upon the <hi>Ghoſt;</hi> he ſhould turn his Head <hi>from Banquo,</hi> and ſay, to the Lords at Supper, <hi>Which of you have done this?</hi> For to ſpeak to the <hi>plural</hi> Number, and look at the <hi>ſingular (Banquo</hi> only) is moſt abſurd and ridiculous. Then at the <hi>ſecond</hi> Appearance of the Ghoſt, at the Words, <hi>Dare me to the Deſart with thy Sword, Macbeth</hi> ſhould draw his Sword, and put himſelf in a Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Defence; and when he comes to, <hi>Hence horrid Shadow!</hi> he ſhould make a home Thruſt at him, recover himſelf upon the <hi>Ghoſt</hi>'s moving, and keep paſſing at him till he has got him quite out of the Room: The Manner it has been done <hi>heretofore,</hi> which is keeping the Hand upon the Sword, and following him out, is not ſo natural and effecting, as the Way I propoſe; and if any Objection is made, that <hi>Macbeth</hi> ſhould know, that <hi>Ghoſts</hi> are not <hi>vulnerable,</hi> I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, <hi>Macbeth</hi>'s Horror confounds him, and his Actions muſt denote the <hi>Non Compos.</hi> Here I muſt take Notice of an Omiſſion in
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0246902000:21"/>
the Part of <hi>Banquo;</hi> when he appears at the Banquet, he ought to riſe in a <hi>Red Cloak,</hi> as he was ſeen to croſs the Stage in one, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately before his Murder; this would throw a great Solemnity upon the Figure of <hi>Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quo,</hi> and preſerve the Decorum of the Stage.—I muſt likewiſe obſerve, that in <hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s Time, the Actors wore their own Hair, and now, from the preſent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion of wearing Wigs, ſome Speeches are become abſurd, ſuch, for Inſtance, is this of <hi>Macbeth, Never ſhake thy Goary Locks at me;</hi> when at the ſame Time the Ghoſt is ſeen in a <hi>Tye Wig:</hi> If I might be allow'd to propoſe an Alteration (with all imaginable Deference to the immortal <hi>Shakeſpear)</hi> in order to avoid this Blunder, I would have the Actor ſay, <hi>Never ſhake thy Goary</hi> TYE <hi>at me;</hi> if the Word <hi>Wig</hi> is thought more Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical, it will be equally good, as they are both Monoſyllables.</p>
            <p>AS I have not yet left the <hi>Banquet Scene,</hi> I muſt obſerve that the <hi>Attitude G—k</hi> ſtands in, at the ſecond Appearance of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0246902000:22"/>
Ghoſt, is abſolutely wrong: <hi>Macbeth</hi> here ſhould <hi>ſink</hi> into <hi>himſelf,</hi> or rather, if I may be allow'd the Expreſſion, <hi>hide</hi> himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind <hi>himſelf;</hi> or to illuſtrate it more by Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, <hi>Si parvis comporere, &amp;c.</hi> he ſhould imitate the contracting Power of a <hi>Snail,</hi> preſerving at the <hi>ſame Time a ſlow awful manly</hi> folding up of his Faculties, and as his <hi>Body</hi> gathers up gradually at the Viſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his <hi>Mind</hi> ſhould keep the ſame Time, and denote its ſtrong Workings and Convulſions<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at his <hi>Eyes;</hi> the Glaſs of Wine in his Hand ſhould not be daſh'd upon the Ground, but it ſhould fall <hi>gently</hi> from him, and he ſhould not diſcover the leaſt Conſciouſneſs of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a Vehicle in his Hand, his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory being quite loſt in the preſent Guilt and Horror of his Imagination. <hi>The Banquet</hi> itſelf, which is ſuppos'd to be a <hi>Regal</hi> one, ſhould not be compos'd of a few <hi>Apples, Oranges,</hi> and ſuch like Traſh, but of <hi>hot</hi> coſtly <hi>Viands,</hi> and large Pyramids of <hi>wet Sweetmeats,</hi> and <hi>Savoy Biſcuits;</hi> this would caſt an inconceiveable Grandeur upon the Scene, and add greatly to the Horror of
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0246902000:23"/>
the Ghoſt.—<hi>Macbeth</hi> ſays, <hi>To Night we hold a</hi> SOLEMN <hi>Supper, Sir;</hi> which <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity</hi> ſhould be preſerv'd, by having ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>inferior Clergy</hi> at the Table, and of Conſequence the <hi>ſupernatural</hi> Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of <hi>Banquo,</hi> would ſtrike with dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Force on the Minds of the Audience, by their <hi>Spiritual</hi> Preſence. I could ſhew that this Play is even deficient in every <hi>little Decoration,</hi> but this one groſs Blunder will ſuffice to give us an Idea of all the reſt.</p>
            <p>AS my Criticiſms upon the three firſt Acts of <hi>Macbeth</hi> have been more full and extended than I at firſt deſign'd 'em, I ſhall reſerve my Obſervations upon the two laſt, for another <hi>Sixpenny</hi> Pamphlet, to which I ſhall ſubjoin a Criticiſm upon <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lombine Courtezan,</hi> which I ſhall examine critically, Scene by Scene, and lay open the Imperfections of that Piece, diſcernable to the meaneſt Capacity, and ſhall prove, by undeniable <hi>Concluſions,</hi> drawn from known <hi>Poſtulata,</hi> that the <hi>worſt</hi> Play that ever <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> wrote, is greatly preferable to the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0246902000:24"/>
whole Performance of <hi>Colombine Courtezan.</hi> I am very ſenſible what Difficulties and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices I have to ſurmount in ſuch an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking; but as I have the Reputation of my Country at Heart, I am reſolv'd to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute my laudable Intentions with indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable Care, and unwearied Diligence.</p>
            <p>IN ſhort, to ſum up the Whole of my preſent Obſervations upon this Head, as I profeſs the ſtricteſt Adherence to Truth, deſpiſe Flattery, and am incapable of Fear, I will venture to affirm, there is not one pleaſure-giving Scene throughout the whole Play of <hi>Macbeth,</hi> as it is now acted: But as I will ever do Juſtice to Merit, I muſt own I felt ſome Pleaſure at ſeeing Mr. <hi>Mills</hi>'s <hi>Green Ribbon and Star,</hi> in the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Duncan;</hi> the unexpected Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of the <hi>Scotch Order</hi> was an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Novelty, and diſcover'd great Fancy in the Actor; therefore I could not refrain from giving it <hi>here</hi> a deſerved Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and it ſhall always meet with my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation in the <hi>Theatre.</hi>

I think I cannot better finiſh a Criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm on <hi>Macbeth,</hi> than with a ſuccinct De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the Talents and Capacity of its Author. <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> was a Writer not to be confin'd by <hi>Rule;</hi> he had a <hi>deſpotick Power</hi> over all Nature; <hi>Laws</hi> would be an <hi>Infringement</hi> of his <hi>Prerogative;</hi> his <hi>ſcepter'd Pen</hi> wav'd Controul over every <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Humour;</hi> his <hi>Royal Word</hi> was not only <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute,</hi> but <hi>Creative; Ideas, Language,</hi> and <hi>Sentiment</hi> were his <hi>Slaves,</hi> they were <hi>chain'd</hi> to the <hi>Triumphal Car</hi> of his <hi>Genius;</hi> and when he made his <hi>Entry</hi> into the <hi>Temple of Fame,</hi> all <hi>Parnaſſus</hi> rung with <hi>Acclamations;</hi> the <hi>Muſes</hi> ſung his <hi>Conqueſts,</hi> crown'd him with never-fading <hi>Laurels,</hi> and pronounc'd him <hi>Immortal.</hi> AMEN.</p>
