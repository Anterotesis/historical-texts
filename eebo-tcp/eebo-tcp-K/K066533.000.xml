            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>SUFFER a word of exhortation from a heart that knows its own bitterneſs, and grones under the ruins of a ſinful nature and diſordered paſſions. Permit one who freely owns, with grief and ſhame, that he is naturally of a very haſty temper and paſſionate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, to addreſs you, on the evil of indulging and giving way to this. In this attempt I humbly crave your moſt ſerious attention and affectionate regard, hoping herein mine eye is ſingly directed to our Lord's glory, and my heart ſincerely engaged for your ſpiritual good and my own. Bear with my freedom, as I aſſure you, I deſire to write from <hi>my own</hi> ſenſe and experience of this evil, as well from obſervation of it in others. would apply to <hi>my own ſoul</hi> all that I write to you; and deſire to fall under every conviction <hi>myſelf,</hi> which I may bring againſt you.</p>
            <p>I am perſuaded, you muſt, you will join me, in freely confeſſing, that to indulge and exalt a ſpirit and temper contrary to meekneſs and quietneſs, is as oppoſite to our profeſſion of being diſciples and followers of the meek and lowly Jeſus, as light is to darkneſs, or heaven to hell; and that ſuch a conduct is to be condemned. But yet, how many ſuch profeſſors do day after day, live and act under the power of their uncontrouled tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and unſubdued paſſions of bitter anger, furious wrath, and unbridled reſentment? Yes, and what is moſt to be lamented, they do not ſeem to ſee the leaſt

evil in all this, are not humbled for it, nor are they ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving againſt it; but are rather ſaying, I do well to be angry. They find excuſes to palliate the evil, and to juſtify their bad conduct. O, my brethren, theſe things ought not ſo to be! Who can obſerve, without great concern of mind and grief of ſoul, what advantage ſatan gets over ſuch? One would therefore ſincerely wiſh to drop a word in ſeaſon to ſuch.</p>
            <p>In order therefore, through the bleſſing of our Lord, to faſten conviction upon your heart and mine for, and to prevent ſuch conduct, the Lord help us to conſider,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1ſt. The bleſſedneſs of a meek and quiet ſpirit.</item>
               <item>2dly. The evil of a contrary one. And,</item>
               <item>3dly. Point out ſome remedies againſt it.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. As to the bleſſedneſs of a meek and quiet ſpirit. It is the offspring of heaven—the gift of God—a fruit of the Holy Spirit—obtained for us by the blood of Jeſus—conferred on us, when we are born into him by his Spirit, and made new creatures in him, thro' the faith of the operation of God; and is enjoyed by walking in fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip with God the Father, and his Son Jeſus Chriſt. Hence, no marvel, that Peter ſays, "The ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit is in the ſight of God of great price," 1 Pet. iii. 4. The neceſſity of putting it on, and adorning ourſelves with it, from day to day, and from hour to hour, under all circumſtances and appearance of things, muſt be allowed to be abſolutely neceſſary, if we have any regard to the glory of God our loving Father; any concern for the honor of Jeſus our meek and lowly Saviour; any deſire to poſſeſs the peace of faith, the joy of hope, the comfort of love, and the witneſs of God the Holy Spirit in our own hearts; any
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0732201200:4"/>
zeal for the credit of our moſt holy religion, to make it honorable in the ſight of our brethren, and to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the world. A real, undiſſembled regard to all this, is cloſely connected with, and enters into the very eſſence of the bleſſedneſs of a meek and quiet ſpirit. Therefore, conſider,</p>
            <p>1ſt. The bleſſedneſs it is of to our own ſouls. For there are many great and precious promiſes which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to, and which meek and quiet ſpirits may joyfully claim, and be comforted by. But pride avaunt. For thou art at the bottom of every evil temper and ſinful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Think not that any one promiſe is made to us, or belongs to us for and on account of any inherent meekneſs of ſpirit, or quietneſs of temper we are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally poſſeſſed of. No. The promiſes are ALL IN CHRIST JESUS; are all made to him, as our covenant head, for and in behalf of all his members. "Unto us are <hi>given</hi> exceeding great and precious promiſes," 2 Pet. i. 4. Us! Who? even all who have obtained precious faith in the righteouſneſs of God our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; who are in him, united to him, and are one with him; partakers of the divine nature, ſo as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble it, and be made comformable to it. "Behold, thy King cometh unto thee <hi>meek,"</hi> Matt. xxi. 3. When we receive our meek King Jeſus into our hearts by faith, we then partake of his meekneſs and gentleneſs, our ſpirit is changed and conformed in our meaſure into his. Then we find, all the exceeding great and precious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, which are in him, to be ours alſo We claim them in him; and, poſſeſſing Chriſt, we may, we ought joyfully to take them to ourſelves. Hear, rejoice, and comfortably apply them, O ye meek ſpirited ſinners! <q>The <hi>meek</hi> will he guide in judgment, and the <hi>meek</hi> will he teach his way, <bibl>Pſalm xxv. 9.</bibl>
               </q> 
               <q>The LORD lifteth up the <hi>meek,</hi> 
                  <bibl>cxlvii. 6.</bibl>
               </q> 
               <q>He will beautify the <hi>meek</hi> with ſalvation, <bibl>cxlix. 4.</bibl>
               </q> 
               <q>The <hi>meek</hi> ſhall increaſe their
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0732201200:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>
joy in the LORD, <bibl>Iſaiah xxix. 19.</bibl>
               </q> Chriſt preaches good tidings to the <hi>meek,</hi> lxi. 1. and pronounces them bleſſed, Matt. v. 5. Such is the bleſſedneſs of the meek.</p>
            <p>Now by the <hi>meek,</hi> in all theſe places, and throughout the word of God is meant, the poor in ſpirit, the lowly in their own eyes, thoſe who are ſenſible of their own need and miſery, are humbled for it, and live under an abiding ſenſe of it None are real diſciples of Jeſus but ſuch. None are the children of God by faith in Chriſt Jeſus but ſuch. None will cleave to and follow our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour but ſuch. None but ſuch, will have any regard to honor and glorify him in the world. None but ſuch, can apply and enjoy the promiſes which are in Chriſt Jeſus. And it is impoſſible for any one to have the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Spirit with his ſpirit, that he is a child of God, that his ſins are pardoned in the blood of Chriſt, unleſs he is living and walking in lowlineſs of mind, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty of ſpirit, and meekneſs of temper. But the bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe who are of a meek and quiet ſpirit, conſiſts in the enjoyment of the comforts of the exceeding great and precious promiſes which are in Chriſt Jeſus, Yea and Amen, ſure and certain to all the heirs of promiſe, to the glory of God. Conſider,</p>
            <p>2dly, Thoſe who are of a meek and quiet ſpirit, are a bleſſing and comfort to others. For they adorn the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of God our Saviour, rejoice the hearts of their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Chriſt, and cauſe the way of truth to be well-ſpoken of in the world. O how ſweet is the company and converſation of a meek, lowly, poor in ſpirit ſinner! He is ever breathing a ſweet ſavor of the dear Redeemer's matchleſs love, rich grace, precious atonement, ſpotleſs righteouſneſs, and finiſhed ſalvation to others; yea, and though proud, ſtout-hearted, ſelf-righteous ſinners, do not approve of his faith and hope in the ſalvation of Chriſt, yet by his ſweetneſs of temper, and ſoftneſs of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior, in gentleneſs, ſhewing all meekneſs to all men,
<pb facs="tcp:0732201200:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and in meekneſs inſtructing thoſe who oppoſe themſelves, they will at leaſt be won to think, there is a certain ſomething which he poſſeſſes, which is truly amiable and praiſe worthy, and which deſerves imitation. And how happy does ſuch a ſoul make thoſe around him, or who dwell under the ſame roof with him? If a huſband, the meekneſs and quietneſs of his ſpirit, will not only be an example, but a bleſſing and comfort to the wife of his boſom. If a wife, ſhe will be ſo to her huſband. If a parent, the ſame to his or her children. If a maſter or miſtreſs, the ſame to his or her ſervants; and ſo each will be to the other in every ſtation and relation. Well then might Paul exhort, "I beſeech you that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called, with all lowlineſs and meekneſs, with long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in love," Eph. iv. 1, 2. But, above all,</p>
            <p>3dly, Such are bleſſed, in that they honor Chriſt and glorify the God of their ſalvation. By the meekneſs of your ſpirit and quietneſs of your temper, you make it manifeſt, that Jeſus is a Saviour, a real Saviour, a preſent Saviour, that you have been with him, and learned of him, and that he has ſaved you from the proud, boiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, raging waves of tumultuous paſſions; that he has ſpoken, <hi>Peace be ſtill,</hi> and the ſwelling ſea of unruly tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers is huſhed into a profound calm. So that now, you can no more delight in indulging your proud paſſions, and giving way to your bad tempers, than you can in gratifying your carnal luſts. Hence, as Paul ſays upon another occaſion, "Others will worſhip God, and report that God is in you of a truth:" that the God of peace and love is with you: that Chriſt is upon the throne of your heart; that he reigns in you, and rules over your evil tempers, and brings your unruly paſſions into captivity to the obedience of himſelf. Yea, to the honor and glory of our heavenly King, you will make it ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that his kingdom is not in the word of profeſſion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0732201200:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but in the power of the Holy Ghoſt. And that your tongue, which is naturally a fire of hell, and a world of iniquity, that defileth the whole body, ſetteth on fire the courſe of nature, and is ſet on fire of hell, which is an unruly member, full of deadly poiſon, which no man can tame, James iii. 6, 8. yet Jeſus, by the power of his goſpel, hath tamed and ſubdued. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore now, to the glory of your Saviour, the wild wolf can dwell with the tame Lamb; the ſavage leopard, lie down with the harmleſs kid; the fierce lion, with the inoffenſive calf; and a young child can lead thoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and paſſions of yours, which were heretofore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governable and untractable. O what glory does this bring to the God of all grace! what honor to our dear Saviour's power and love! how does it adorn his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious goſpel of peace! O, brethren, for our ſouls ſake, for our brethren in Chriſt's ſake, for the ſake of the honor of our God and Saviour, and for his goſpel's ſake, let us be all ſtrife and contention, who ſhall get moſt of the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit from Chriſt, to live moſt in it, and to glorify him moſt by it. It is moſt pleaſant to dwell on this. But it is neceſſary for us to turn to the dark ſide of the queſtion, and conſider,</p>
            <p>2dly, The evil of indulging a contrary ſpirit, and giving way to oppoſite tempers. This will appear very injurious in a perſonal and relative point of view.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Perſonal. It will be hurtful to ourſelves. Do we conſult the health of our bodies? Evil tempers and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate paſſions, have a very injurious effect upon the frame of the body. How many have ſacrificed their lives to a fit of anger? How many have loſt their ſenſes, others their health irrecoverably, in a fever of furious paſſion? Well might the heathens ſtile a fit of anger, <hi>brevis furor,</hi> ſhort madneſs. But my concern is not ſo much about the walls of your houſe, as for the good of the tenant which dwells within, your precious ſoul.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0732201200:8" rendition="simple:additions"/>
My meſſage is chiefly to thee, O thou immortal part, born of God, and formed for the enjoyment of God. How do ſinful anger and unbridled paſſions affect, wound, and diſtreſs thee! Say, Conſcience. Teſtify, thou faithful witneſs. How long ſince thou didſt feel the exaltings of deviliſh pride, and heardeſt the loud clamors of haughty paſſions, venting their rage and fury to thy wounding and pain? Was it lately? This day? this hour? juſt now? How doſt thou feel thyſelf after it?</p>
            <p>Let us firſt attend to the evil effects this hath upon the <hi>conſcience.</hi> A chriſtian's conſcience, is that inward know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it has of divine truths, and that teſtimony it bears to the bleſſed effects and holy influences which they have upon the ſoul. By the knowledge of the law, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience is filled with a ſenſe of wrath and condemnation; hence it becomes an evil conſcience; it bears teſtimony of evil, guilt and wrath to the ſoul. By the ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt upon the heart the conſcience is made a good one, Heb. x. 22. It knows and finds peace with God, pardon of ſin, and juſtification in his ſight; and it bears a good and comfortable teſtimony to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>Now the chriſtian is called to live under and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain conſtantly, the teſtimony of a good conſcience by the ſprinkling of the blood of Chriſt; and to have the anſwer of a good conſcience towards God, by the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt from the dead, 1 Pet. iii. 21. But giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to, and indulging of any ſpirit and temper, which is contrary to the purity and meekneſs of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, will rack and torture the conſcience, wound and grieve it, diſturb its peace, and deſtroy its comfort. Why? Becauſe there is a ceſſation of the chriſtian's liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by faith on Chriſt, cleaving to him, feeding upon him, and enjoying holy fellowſhip with him.</p>
            <p>Can we ſuppoſe, when we ſee a perſon violently agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by a fit of paſſion, that he is at that moment living
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0732201200:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
under the influence of faith in Jeſus, love to him, and peace with him? can we think that he then enjoys an inward calm, a ſunſhine of peace of conſcience? No; we may as well ſuppoſe, that the ſea is in a profound calm when a ſtorm of wind blows. O ye fretful, paſſionate ſouls, who at every turn that thwarts your purpoſe, and oppoſes your inclination, fly into a rage of unruly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, how do you exalt folly! folly of the moſt egregious kind: more ſo, than if ye were to wound your fleſh with lancets; for ye wound your conſciences, diſtract your minds, and diſtreſs your ſouls. You ſacrifice your peace of conſcience, your comfort of mind, your joy of ſoul in Jeſus—for what? for the indulging a fit of rage, giving way to wrathful reſentment, and gratifying a deviliſh paſſion. Hereby you make Chriſt's friends mourn, his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies rejoice, the devils ſport, and yourſelves—what ſhall I ſay? what compare you to? much worſe than Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon's madman, who "caſteth firebrands, arrows, and death, and ſaith, Am not I in ſport," Prov. xxvi. 19. Sad ſport! for hereby you deceive your own ſoul, and rob your conſcience of ſweet peace in Jeſus, and heavenly joy in the Holy Ghoſt. May the Lord ſet this home upon my heart as well as yours! O may conviction faſten upon each of us for having thus exalted folly! may Jeſus pardon what is paſt, and ſtrengthen our ſouls to reſiſt and overcome this evil in future!</p>
            <p>Suffer me here to drop a hint to your ſouls and mine. If after a fit of paſſion, and exalting any evil tempers, we do not find our conſcience wounded and pained, but ſtill poſſeſſing its courage and confidence; this is no good ſign. It argues a ſtupidity of conſcience, and of its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hardened through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.

pardon for it, and power over it. But to proceed. Conſider, 2dly, The evil of ſuch conduct, as it hinders our prayers. I do not mean, that it totally prevents our <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayers</hi> (though it is to be feared it often has this effect alſo) but it hinders the ſpirit of prayer. We may keep up the form, when the life and ſpirit of prayer is quite evaporated. It is no unuſual thing to have the form of prayer kept up in families, where the ſpirit of violent paſſions and evil tempers reign in the heads of thoſe families. They will ſay prayers with their families at night, after they have lived in the ſtorm of paſſion with them all the day. Yea, before they called them in to prayer, it was prefaced with a ſtorm, which only ſubſided till the prayers were over, and then the ſtorm was as vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent as before. Surely ſuch prayers, connected with ſuch conduct, muſt be an abomination to the Lord. O how are ſouls deceived herein, and their prayers hindred here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by! Says Paul, "I will that holy men pray every where, lifting up holy hands without wrath or doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing," 1 Tim. ii. 8. But where there is wrath of ſpirit, there will be doubting of heart, and hands cannot be lifted up to God with boldneſs, nor ſouls find freedom of acceſs to him. Where the ſpirit of meekneſs, quietneſs, and peace, does not reign in the tempers, the ſpirit of prayer doth not live in the heart, nor can fervent effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual prayers aſcend from the lips. Therefore our Lord ſays, "In your patience poſſeſs ye your ſouls," Luke xxi. 19. "Be patient towards all men," 1 Theſſ. 5. 14. "Let not the ſun go down upon your wrath, neither give place to the devil," Eph. iv. 27. from hence it plainly appears, that an impatient, paſſionate, wrathful man, is ſo deviliſh complaiſant, as to give place to the devil, to let him take the upper hand of him, by giving way to paſſions and tempers, which are agreeable to his proud and furious nature. Judge then. Can the Spirit of Chriſt, the ſpirit of prayer dwell in ſuch, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed

from ſuch? No marvel ſuch complain of the cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, deadneſs, and langour of their prayers, when their ſinful paſſions and evil tempers are ſo warm and lively. From hence we may conclude, he who lives and walks under the evil influence of them, has ſatan for his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion all day; he that lies down under the power of them, has ſatan for his bedfellow at night.

               </gap> of humility of heart and lowlineſs of mind, if you indulge your angry, paſſionate tempers? And, if theſe prevail over us, can we enjoy the comfort of faith, and the joy of hope within us? It is impoſſible. Do we believe Chriſt hath ſuffered for our ſins? Do we hope for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through his ſufferings and death? What! and not ſtudy to follow the example of his life, nor ſtrive to tread in his ſteps? Let us be aſſured, two more oppoſite cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters cannot poſſibly exiſt, than a meek, lowly, patient Saviour, and a furious, proud, impatient diſciple.</p>
            <p>Be aſſured, true faith leads the ſoul to look for conſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the life of Chriſt, as well as expects ſalvation from wrath by his death. The hope of ſeeing Jeſus in glory, purifies the heart from evil tempers, and the life from ſinful paſſions, even as Chriſt is pure; and in ſuch, the comfort of faith and the joy of hope abounds. But where there is the ſtriſe of paſſion, and the fury of anger, there is confuſion and every evil work. If the power of faith in Chriſt does not prevail over our ſinful paſſions, the peace of faith cannot rule in the heart. The joy of hope in Jeſus cannot be poſſeſſed, while the mind is
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0732201200:13"/>
agitated with the tumult of paſſion. The comfort of love will be baniſhed by anger and wrath. No marvel then, if our evil tempers and ſinful paſſions have the aſcendency over us, that we have not joy and peace in believing within us. Do you complain for want of the comfort of faith, and the joy of hope? Look to your conduct. See if you do not, by the fury of your paſſions, and giving way to your evil tempers, grieve the Spirit, and drive that peaceful gueſt from your boſom.</p>
            <p>The fruit of righteouſneſs is ſown in peace, of them who make peace, James iii. 18. But if you ſow to anger and paſſion, and war and ſtrife ſpring up, you can reap nothing but the fruit of diſcord and dejection. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-ſuffering, gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs, meekneſs, &amp;c. and the works of the fleſh are manifeſt, which are variance, emulation, wrath, ſtrife, &amp;c. Gal. v. xix. 22. Now ſee, whether you are of the Spirit, or of the fleſh. Which are you governed by and live under the influence of? what fruits do you bear and bring forth, in the general courſe of your life, and tenor of your behavior? Are they ſuch as are agreeable to faith and hope in our Lord? or, are they ſuch as are deſtructive of the peace of faith, the joy of hope, and the comfort of love in him? But,</p>
            <p>4thly, Indulging our unholy tempers and ſinful paſſions, will prevent our profiting by hearing of the goſpel of peace. What avails hearing a form of ſound words, if we are not caſt into the mould of them, and receive not the impreſſions of a peaceable ſpirit from them? The goſpel preaches peace by Jeſus Chriſt, from God to poor ſinners. But we cannot receive this in the ſpirit of peace, while our angry paſſions and evil tempers prevail over us. Though the ſeed of the word be ſown, it cannot take deep root, it will not ſpring up, nor bear any fruit in a paſſionate breaſt, but will ſoon be choaked by diſordered tempers. If we live under the power of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0732201200:14"/>
evil tempers and paſſions, though we may hear the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, like the goſpel, and delight to ſet under the preaching of it; yet it will be with us, as it was with the people who ſat under Ezekiel's miniſtry. Saith the Lord, "They ſit before thee as <hi>my people,</hi> and hear thy words, but they will not do them, for with their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their ſins, and lo, thou art unto them, as a very lovely ſong of one that hath a pleaſant voice, and can play well on an inſtrument: for they hear thy words, and do them not," Ezek. xxxiii. 31, 32. Now here is a true picture of unprofitable hearers. They like, they ſeem delighted with the ſound of the goſpel; it charms their paſſions into compoſure, and their tempers into ſerenity. How long? Till the ſound is paſſed from their ears, and their feet have reached their dwellings. There, inſtead of ſtriving to mix faith with the word, and caſting themſelves humbly down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, to ſteep the ſeed of the word in meditation and prayer, alas! the birds of prey, ſome fierce paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, ſome unruly tempers are exalted, which devour the ſeed, and no profit is gained by it. Though ſuch hear the word, "be at peace among yourſelves," 1 Theſſ. v. 13. "Follow peace with all men," Heb. xii. 4. "Seek peace and enſue it," 1 Pet iii. 11. Though peace flees from you, yet purſue and overtake it. Yet they do it not. But inſtead of this, every little thing calls up their paſſions to arms, and enrages their tempers, and they are ſoon engaged in the war of commotion. They do not as exhorted, "receive with <hi>meekneſs</hi> the engrafted word, which is able to ſave the ſoul: for if any man among you ſeem to be religious, and bridleth not his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion is vain," James i. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>1. The Lord help us to ſee and feel the evil of thus giving way in the leaſt herein. O may we not be ſuffered to be thus a ſhame to the goſpel, but
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0732201200:15"/>
may we find it to be the power of God, to the ſalvation of us, from our unruly tempers and unholy paſſions.</p>
            <p>But to proceed one ſtep farther, to conſider this evil in reſpect to others. We all ſtand in ſome, though dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent relations to each other in life. And we all may be, yea, certainly are, profitable or hurtful to each other, by the ſpirit and temper of our behavior. We are prone to catch evil tempers and ſinful paſſions from each other, and to provoke one another to wrath. We teach very powerfully by our examples. The tinder of paſſion ſoon catches the falling ſpark, and kindles into a flame; for we all have the tinder of it in our nature. The ſeeds of every evil temper and ſinful paſſion are in us all, and are ſoon brought forth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o fruit by bad example. My own ſoul is bowed down on account of paſt bad conduct herein. O what an evil, what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious example do we ſet our children, our ſervants, and all about us, by exciting a ſpirit and temper contrary to the profeſſion we make, of being diſciples and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the meek and lowly Jeſus! This calls for great humblings of ſoul before the Lord.</p>
            <p>Fiery tempers, and impetuous paſſions, give others but a very indifferent opinion, either of the holy truths we profeſs, or of the reality of our belief of them. You cannot, you dare not, you will not, have a heart, with boldneſs and conſiſtency, to reprove a child, a ſervant, or a friend, for paſſionate tempers, and angry words, when you live and act under the influence of them your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. They will gag your mouth, and ſtop your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof. If they do not, the natural reply to you may be, <hi>Phyſician, heal thyſelf.</hi> O how does ſuch an allowed evil, teach, confirm, and harden others in the ſame! What a reproach does it bring upon our holy profeſſion! How does it cauſe the name of God and his doctrine to be blaſphemed! Is it not very natural for others taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingly to ſay, "See, here are your ſaints of God! theſe
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0732201200:16" rendition="simple:additions"/>
are your believers in Chriſt! theſe are they who profeſs to believe their ſins are forgiven, and expect ſalvation by Chriſt; but behold they are ſlaves to their paſſions, carried away captives by their evil tempers, and live under the influence of anger, wrath, and contention, juſt like other men. What ſort of a Saviour do they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in? Theſe are the effects of ſuch doctrines they adhere to."</p>
            <p>O my brethren, have I not urged enough againſt this evil, fully to convince <hi>you</hi> of it? Sure I am I have ſaid enough to make <hi>me</hi> aſhamed of ever giving way to evil tempers, and indulging ſinful paſſions, and to humble my ſoul to the duſt before our Lord for them.

Is the gift of God eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord? Is Chriſt able to ſave us to the uttermoſt from our evil tempers and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? What remains then but that we ſtudy, ſtrive and pray, for the maſtery over thoſe evil tempers and ſinful paſſions which are in us, and which are prone to prevail over us.

Should imperious airs, paſſionate ſpeeches, and wrathful tempers be exalted by us? What! and theſe too, in the ſight and preſence of the Lord our judge? O how ill becoming ſuch a conduct! therefore, ſtudy and pray ever to maintain upon your mind, a conſtant ſenſe of your own vileneſs and poverty, that you may live in humbleneſs of mind and lowlineſs of ſpirit before the Lord. Yea, be conſtantly humbling yourſelves under the mighty hand of God, becauſe you find and feel in you ſuch tempers and paſſions which are contrary to the meek and lowly Spirit of your Lord, are inconſiſtent with your being a diſciple and follower of him, and if indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, will certainly prevent your peace of mind, comfort of heart, and joy of ſoul in him; and therefore muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely be ſubdued by the power of his grace.</p>
            <p>Beware, that you liſten not to any plauſible excuſes which ſatan and your own corrupt nature may urge, in any wiſe to juſtify your evil tempers and diſordered paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.

A rooted and abiding conviction of the evil of them, will prove a ſtrong anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt them. Meekneſs of temper proceeds from lowlineſs of mind; and lowlineſs of mind from a conſtant ſight and ſenſe of our extreme poverty and total vileneſs; and our conſtant need of, and dependence upon the riches of the grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt "He who is ſlow to anger, is better than the mighty, and he who

He lets the peace of God rule in his heart, as exhorted," C. l. iii. 15. and the grace of Chriſt reigns over all the pride and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his corrupt nature. Thus, while the proud heart is humbled, Jeſus is exalted, and the ſword of anger he beats into a ploughſhare; and the ſpear of wrath into a pruning hook. To know ourſelves, is the greateſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. To ſubdue ourſelves, the greateſt conqueſt. It is true wiſdom to avoid an evil, true patience to endure it, and true valour to conquer it. James gives moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious advice to us, "My beloved brethren, be ſwift to hear, ſlow to ſpeak, ſlow to wrath," James i. 19. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,</p>
            <p>2dly, Watch over your ſpirit and temper. It is the command of your Lord, WATCH. Why? Becauſe ye know not what hour the thief may come, Matt. xxiv. 42, 43. Conſide<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> every evil temper, every diſordered paſſion, as a thief which comes to rob you of your ſweet peace, heavenly comfort, and holy joy in your Lord. Watchfulneſs is like a ſtrong chai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to a wild beaſt. Such are your furious tempers. Chain them down by watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, within due bounds. David well knew the evil of giving vent to his ſinful paſſions. He was in a ſweet watchful frame, when he ſays, "Set a watch, O Lord, before my mouth, keep the door of my lips," Pſalm cxli. 3. "He regarded wiſdom's voice. He who is ſoon angry dealeth fooliſhly," Prov. xiv. 17. Why are we ſoon angry? Becauſe we are fo fooliſh as not to watch againſt it. It takes us by ſurprize, and overcomes us unawares. Therefore, the ſpirit of revelation, is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly exhorting us to watchfulneſs. The evil of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and the ſinfulneſs of anger are hereby prevented, and many comforts enjoyed. The duty is ours; prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe it. The power to perform it, and the bleſſings conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0732201200:19"/>
on it, are from the Lord: therefore, "Watch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prayer," 1 Pet. iv. 7.</p>
            <p>3dly. Keep under your body, and bring it into ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A pampered horſe is unruly. Living high, adds fuel to the fire of the paſſions. Self-denial, like an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, cools the fire of the tempers. Says our Lord, "If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs and follow me," Mat. xvi. 24. The more ſelf-denial for Chriſt, the more enjoyment of Chriſt: the more Chriſt is enjoyed, the more conformity to the lowlineſs of his mind, and meekneſs of his ſpirit will prevail. If a general cannot conquer a place by ſtorm, he will guard every avenue, and ſtarve out the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants. So-act by the fleſh and its ſinful paſſions. Tho' you cannot totally <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ſtroy the old man, yet do not pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but ſtarve him, ſo as to mortify and ſubdue his evil tempers. For "if ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die; but if ye through the Spirit do mortify the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live," Rom viii. 13. Live in the peace of God, the love of Chriſt, and the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt. Again,</p>
            <p>4thly, Let us ever conſider our high ſtate and glorious dignity. Are we believers in Chriſt? Then we are born again of the Spirit, are one with Chriſt, are heirs of God, and joint heirs with Chriſt. Hear what Paul ſays of us: "Ye are not in the fleſh, but in the Spirit," Rom. viii. 9. Not in the fleſh! How ſo? Do we not carry about us a body of ſin and death? Have we not all the corrupt affections, beaſtly lu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: but are in the Spirit; in a new ſtate, wherein all grace abounds to us, and all fulneſs of grace is treaſured up for us in Chriſt; yea, and every enemy conquered, and perfect victory obtained by him, in our nature,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0732201200:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and on our behalf; therefore; though we have no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent ſtock of grace in ourſelves, yet being united unto Chriſt, and having fellowſhip with him, we may, we ought, to be continually receiving out of his fulneſs, to ſtrengthen us to overcome our ſinful paſſions, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due our evil tempers. Aſſert, then, your dignity. Live above your low, earthly, groveling paſſions. Be not a ſlave to the uſurping tyranny of your evil tempers. Do they beſet you? Do they teaze you? Do they demand admiſſion, claim indulgence, and plead for gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Diſmiſs them with an air of triumph. Diſpatch them with, "Get ye to hell, from whence ye came, ye baſe-born offspring of ſin and ſatan; ye are unworthy my attention. I am a ſon of God, a companion of Jeſus, an inhabitant of the Spirit. Jeſus hath made me KING to reign over you, a PRIEST to ſacrifice you unto God, and an heir of glory to reign eternally with God." What then? Attend and obey the voice of the Spirit. "Put on therefore as the ELECT of God (holy and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved) bowels of mercies, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering: forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a quarrel againſt any: even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye," Col. iii. 12, 13. O let Chriſt and his forgiving love dwell with you, and be the rule and influence of your ſpirit, temper, and behavior.</p>
            <p>My dear Chriſtian brethren, we live too low, and do not enough conſider our high ſtate of dignity in Chriſt. Hence we do not act like ourſelves, but grovel in the kingdom of nature, give way to the paſſions thereof, when we ſhould be ſoaring to and living in the kingdom of Jeſus, and poſſeſſing thoſe heavenly tempers for which we are new formed by his grace. "Therefore ſtand faſt in the faith, quit yourſelves like men [men of God, born of his Spirit, and one with Chriſt]. Be ſtrong," 1 Cor. xvi. 13. Strong in the Lord Jeſus, and in the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0732201200:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
power of his might, ſo ſhall ye put to flight the army of the aliens, of evil tempers and ſinful paſſions. The bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle is the Lord's. Victory is ſure: it ſhall end in his glory, and iſſue in our comfort. Therefore,</p>
            <p>5thly, Do penance for them. Nay, don't ſtart. I mean not to make an atonement (the thought is the higheſt arrogance) but to mortify our proud ſpirits for them. Uſe this very humbling expedient. It will greatly tend to bring down your high ſtomach and lofty ſpirit, to lay your honor in the duſt, and to break your proud heart in pieces. Take the apoſtle's advice, "Confeſs your faults one to another," James v. 16. When over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken by paſſion, or ſurpriſed into anger, let your tongue confeſs your folly. Be not aſhamed to do it, even to your inferiors; yea, the more inferior any are to you, ſo much the more good will you get by it; and ſo much the more will it humble our proud ſpirits for it. Saul, though a king, confeſſes to David, "Behold, I have played the fool, and have erred exceedingly," 1 Sam. xxvi. 16. Thus freely and fully confeſs your folly to others. Do not extenuate, but magnify the evil of paſſion, the folly of anger, and the madneſs of wrath, and beg their prayers for you, that you may be healed. For it is indeed to play the fool, and to err exceedingly from the road of humility, the way of peace, and the path of comfort. To commit a fault, and to brave it out, is a double evil. To confeſs a fault with a good grace and an humble mind, is a victory gained over ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan and our proud ſpirit. It will powerfully work upon our brethren's paſſions for us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> greatly conciliate their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to us, and excite their prayers in our behalf. And ſure I am, ſuch humbling conduct muſt be well-pleaſing in the ſight of our dear Lord, who loves to ſee his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſubject one to another, and clothed with humility; for "he reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble," 1 Pet. v. 5.</p>
            <p>

Laſtly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Above all, and in the uſe of every means to ſubdue our evil tempers and angry paſſions, let us look unto Jeſus, come unto Jeſus, live upon Jeſus, and walk with Jeſus.</p>
            <p>1ſt. Look unto him; eye Chriſt, as ſeeing you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed with infirmities, knowing your weakneſs, yea, touched with a feeling of your infirmities, able to ſuccour you under them, to ſtrengthen you againſt them, and to give you victory over them. Though we ſee in our fleſh dwells no good thing: though every evil temper and ſinful paſſion dwell there, yet we ſee Jeſus ever lives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne for us; he is both able and willing to ſubdue them under us, and to ſave us from the power of them. Though they abound in us daily, yet let us be daily looking to Chriſt, in whom all fulneſs of grace dwells for us; and the more we feel the abounding of theſe paſſions and tempers in us, ſo much the more let us look to Chriſt for the ſuperabounding of his grace to us. For this is his moſt precious voice to us all through life, "Lock unto me, and be ye ſaved," Iſa. xlv. 22. And this is the ſweet, precious, bleſſed experience of every ſuch looking ſinner, "We all with open face, beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame image from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord," 2 Cor, iii. 18. When the eye of the ſoul is taken off from Chriſt, anger rages and paſſions pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. While the eye is fixed on him they ſubſide, and we are changed into lowlineſs of heart and meekneſs of ſpirit. O this looking unto Jeſus has an amazing effect on us; therefore is to be conſtantly practiſed by us. Glory to God's rich grace, that we poor ſinners have ſuch a precious Saviour to look to! Lord Jeſus help us to be ever looking unto thee for ſalvation from all ſin on earth, till we ſee thee, and are perfectly like thee in glory!</p>

2dly, Come unto Jeſus. This is his loving invitation, <q>"Come unto me, all ye"</q>—All who? Is it all ye who are free from your galling tempers and diſordered paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? ye, who are never diſtreſſed by them, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed with them? O no, but ALL YE who labor under them, are weary of them, and heavy laden with them. Then thou, even thou; and me, even me, fretful, haſty, and paſſionate, as our natural tempers and ſpirits are, may come, ought to come, yea are commanded by Jeſus, to come unto him. Go where and to whom we will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Jeſus, and we ſhall be like the poor woman who had ſpent all that ſhe had upon phyſicians, but they proved of no value, for ſhe only grew worſe. If we go to ſelf-righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous proud Phariſees, and tell our caſe, they will ſhake their heads at us, pronounce our caſe deſperate, our ſtate hopeleſs, and loftily turn away from us. Go we to our affectionate, ſympathizing brethren in Chriſt, they may pity and pray for us, but they cannot heal us. But, O ſweet compaſſion of our loving, tender hearted Jeſus, he ſays, "I WILL GIVE YOU REST." And at once to ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence every objection, and to revive every encouragement, our ever dear Lord adds, "I AM MEEK AND LOWLY IN HEART." <hi>Meek</hi> to receive you without cruel upbraid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings: <hi>lowly</hi> to teach you, without bitter reflections. "Come then unto me, and learn of me, and ye ſhall find what ye can no where elſe obtain, REST UNTO YOUR SOULS," Matt xi. 28, 29. Reſt from turbulent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>empers and tumultuous paſſions, even the reſt of a lowly heart and a meek ſpirit. O that we may honor Chriſt more, by the belief of his gracious words; and come to him daily for the fulfilment of his precious promiſes!</p>
            <p>3dly, Feed upon Jeſus. For he ſaith, "He who eateth me, even he ſhall live by me," John vi 57. Our paſſions live, are mighty in us, and prey upon us, becauſe we are not feeding upon and living by Chriſt. Spiritual feeding on Chriſt in our hearts by faith, nouriſhes our graces and ſtrengthens our ſouls; while it kills our car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0732201200:24"/>
tempers, and ſubdues nature's paſſions. Feeding upon Chriſt's love to us, will make us grow up into him in love. Feeding upon his life, will nouriſh us up into conformity to his meek ſpirit. Feeding upon his death, will mortify our old man with his tempers and paſſions. Feeding upon his ſalvation, will make us ſtrong in his might, and conquerors over our evil tempers. Feeding upon his meekneſs, gentleneſs, long-ſuffering, and kindneſs to us, will make us meek, gentle, long-ſuffering and kind to others. Feeding upon his preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous promiſes, that he will be with us, and guide us all through life, will be our ſtrength and ſupport in the hour of death, and will receive us to himſelf, to be with him in glory, will ſo ſwallow up our whole man, in the ſweet peace, holy love, and heavenly joy of Chriſt, that we ſhall be conſtrained to cry out,</p>
            <l>Let not a ſingle paſſion dare</l>
            <l>Diſturb my breaſt, my Lord is there.</l>
            <p>O for keener appetites, thus to feed on Chriſt by faith, that we may ſo live by him, as to glorify him, by the ſoftneſs of our paſſions and the ſweetneſs of our tempers on earth, till we come to live, reign with, and eternally enjoy our Saviour in glory.</p>
            <p>4thly, Walk with Chriſt. It is a common obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, A man is known by the company he keeps. It is natural to us to catch their manners, ſpirit and temper of behavior. This moſt certainly will hold good, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Chriſt and us. If we walk in cloſe fellowſhip with Chriſt, we ſhall be ſure to catch the fire of love from his heavenly flame, ſweet peace from him, who is the pacific ocean, and meekneſs of ſpirit from him, who is the gentle <hi>Lamb of God.</hi> I have often thought of poor Peter. O how much do I ſee of my own caſe in his! "Peter followed Chriſt afar off," Matt. xxvi. 58. What
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0732201200:25"/>
was the conſequence? A very awful one. As he was afar off from the preſence of Jeſus, ſo was he alſo from his ſpirit and temper. O what a rage of paſſionate mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeized him! Hear and tremble for yourſelf. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold (but not to take any licence from his example, or to juſtify yourſelf in any ſuch practice) behold, the diſciple of the meek and lowly Jeſus curſing and ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a Trooper. Well, Peter, if thou waſt aſhamed of thy Lord, he had now much more cauſe to be aſhamed of thee. See the dreadful effects of keeping at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from Chriſt. As Peter did not keep cloſe to his Lord, his Lord left him to his paſſions, which brought a hell of horror into his conſcience; and he would have dropped into hell itſelf, if his Lord had not looked him by love, into repentance unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>O my brethren, to walk with and keep cloſe to Chriſt in heart, hope, and affection, is to live above our ſinful paſſions, and at a diſtance from our evil tempers. They cannot prevail over us, while Jeſus is in company with us. What will conſtitute our bleſſedneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> in glory? The preſence of Jeſus. This, this is our heaven upon earth now. This makes paradiſe in a world of woe. This brings heaven into our ſoul, while it inhabits a body of ſin. This ſoothes our tempers, and charms our paſſions into a heavenly frame. Hence David, in the paſſion of love, and in the jealouſy of fear cries out, "Forſake me not, O my Lord: O God, be not far from me," Pſalm xxxviii. 21. To walk cloſe with Chriſt, is to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy fellowſhip with God the Father, and this deſtroys our fellowſhip with the unfruitful works of darkneſs, and ſubdues all the corrupt luſts and ſinful paſſions of our fleſh.</p>
            <p>Again. Walk with Chriſt, and you ſhall enjoy the comforts of the Holy Ghoſt. He will come and dwell in us, and bear his bleſſed witneſs to our ſpir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Conſider well this precious text; "God hath exalted Jeſus to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and remiſſion of ſins. Whereof the Holy Ghoſt is a witneſs, whom God hath given to them who <hi>obey him,"</hi> Acts v. 31, 32. The whole glory of the Godhead, centers in the work of Jeſus for us poor ſinners. Though the Holy Ghoſt at firſt enlightens and convinces us, when in a ſtate of enmity to God, and rebellion againſt Chriſt, and lead us to Chriſt for remiſſion of ſins; yet afterwards we cannot enjoy his comforts, but as we are living in obedience to the will of God the Father. And this is his will, that we ſhould conſtantly hear, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on, and walk in fellowſhip with his beloved Son, our Prince and our Saviour. To this bleſſed end the Holy Ghoſt bears witneſs of Chriſt in the word, and while we are thus living and walking with Chriſt in faith and love, we ſhall experience victory over our ſins, Iuſts, corruptions, evil tempers, and ſinful paſſions; and the Holy Ghoſt will bear his comfortable witneſs in our hearts, of God the Father's love to us, and of God the Son's ſalvation of us, and that we really are the children of God, by faith in Chriſt Jeſus. Now here is the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery of our moſt holy faith, to the ſubduing of the myſtery of iniquity in us. There is no victory over ſin, our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, the world, and ſatan, but in Chriſt.

ſin. For Chriſt is of God as much made <hi>ſanctification</hi> to us, as <hi>redemption</hi> of us. Hence, ſays our Lord, "If ye love me, keep my commandments;" and then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes the COMFORTER to abide with us for ever, John xiv. 15, 16.</p>
            <p>From what has been urged I draw this plain</p>

The goſpel of the grace of God, which brings ſalvation to us by Jeſus Chriſt ONLY, hath the moſt genuine and powerful influence upon the whole man, to engage the affections, to purify the heart, to ſubdue the paſſions, to regulate the whole conduct, and to bring every thought, word and work into captivity to the obedience of Chriſt. Therefore, where-ever there is true, living faith on the Son of God, as the Saviour of ſinners, that ſoul will be daily com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to him in poverty of ſpirit, feeding upon him in humbleneſs of mind, and walking with him in lowlineſs of hear<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

HE LIVES BY FAITH IN DIVINE TRUTHS, RELIES ON PRECIOUS PROMISES, AND WALKS IN OBEDIENCE TO HOLY COMMANDS. "As many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them, and mercy," Gal. vi. 16. I cannot conclude without adding the following</p>
            <p>CAUTION.</p>
            <p>Is it ſo? Beware then, of that curſed, Antinomian, licentious, anti-evangelical ſpirit, which ſo ſadly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in this day. Hence ſo many profeſſors reſt ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with a mere notion of a ſet of doctrines in their

heads, without experiencing the love of Chriſt in their hearts, and the power and influence of it over their lives, tempers and converſations. They talk very highly of the deep things of God, ſhew great zeal for the doctrines of grace, and are warm in defending them againſt error. But, alas! they live very low. Inſtead of ſtriving againſt ſin, they make light of it: Exerciſing no godly jealouſy over their tempers and paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: are not following after holineſs, nor zealous of good works to pleaſe the Lord. With all their head knowledge, they live under the influence of the ſame worldly ſpirit, and covetous diſpoſition; and exalt the ſame proud tempers and ſinful paſſions as others do, who are deſtitute of ſuch knowledge. Indeed they live as if they thought, becauſe they aſſent to ſome certain points of doctrine, that therefore they are indulged with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation to ſlight and diſregard practical godlineſs, and to look on it as the very eſſence of <hi>legality.</hi> They walk as if they believed God looks on ſin in them, and their neglect of obedience to the holy precepts and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations of the goſpel, with a more favorable eye than he does upon others. Hence, though they walk after the fleſh, and gratify the pride, pleaſures, luſts, tempers and paſſions of the fleſh, and do not bring forth the fruits of the Spirit; nor evidence in their lives the power and purity of the goſpel upon their hearts; yet, they are very confident of the ſafety of their ſtate now, and that all will go well with them at laſt.</p>
            <p>Moſt fatal deception! Moſt dreadful deluſion! O my brethren, e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>er remember, "the goſpel of Chriſt is the power of God unto ſalvation, to every one who believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth," Rom. i. 16. "It bringeth forth fruit in the heart and life of every one who hears it, and knows the grace of God in truth," Col. i. 6. The very end of our being married by faith to a riſen Saviour, Paul declares is, that "we ſhould bring forth fruit unto

And herein is my Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit, ſo ye ſhall be [appear to be] my diſciples," John xv. 5, 8. Judge now, where the love of ſin prevails in the heart, and the power of ſin in the life and tempers, can ſuch profeſſors be ſaid to have received the goſpel of Chriſt, and to experience it to be the power of God unto ſalvation? Where the fruits of the goſpel are not brought forth in the liſe, can the root of the goſpel be in ſuch hearts? What reaſon has any one to conclude that he is married to Chriſt, by the faith of the operation of God, if he doth not bring forth the fruits of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, which are by Jeſus Chriſt, to the glory of God? What reaſon has any one to think that he is a diſciple of Chriſt, unleſs from his very heart he finds power from Chriſt, to hate all ſin, ſo as ſtudiouſly to ſtrive againſt it; and ſo to love holineſs as conſtantly to follow after it? None at all. Why ſhould any one think that he abides in Chriſt, and Chriſt in him, if he has not the ſame mind in him which was alſo in Chriſt, even to walk as Chriſt alſo walked, in meckneſs of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, lowlineſs of heart, and obedience of life to the glory of God? No one could, if he did not deceive his own heart with a vain religion, and ſubſtitute a dead fancy, an empty ſpeculation, for a living faith. "For wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead?" James ii. 20. And he obſerves in the 17th verſe, "Faith, if it hath not works is dead, <hi>being alone."</hi> Mind that word <hi>alone.</hi> Such a dead faith, is deſtitute of Chriſt in his grace, preſence and power; of the pardon, peace, and love of God; and of the ſanctifying influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, comforting and joyful teſtimony of the Holy Ghoſt. As it is alone in the head, it brings none of this bleſſedneſs into the heart; and therefore it produceth not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0732201200:30"/>
the fruits of righteouſneſs, nor the works of holineſs in the life and converſation.</p>
            <p>O how many ſuch vain men are there amongſt us! How is ſuch a dead faith taken up with and reſted in by profeſſors, without <hi>looking</hi> to Chriſt, who is the life of our ſouls, and the life of our graces: <hi>coming</hi> to Chriſt, who is our ſalvation, to be daily ſaved by him: <hi>feeding</hi> upon Chriſt, who is our bread of life, to be nouriſhed up unto eternal life; and <hi>walking</hi> with Chriſt, who is our ſanctification, to receive out of his fulneſs every ſupply of grace, to conform our ſouls into his image, and our lives unto his obedience; ſo as to adorn his goſpel, and ſhew forth his praiſes, who hath called us out of nature's darkneſs, into the marvellous light of his precious love and glorious ſalvation? O the depths of ſatan! How does he transform himſelf into an angel of light, ſo as to deceive ſouls, to be content with the bare <hi>light</hi> of truth in the head, without enjoying the <hi>love</hi> of Chriſt in their hearts, and the influence of his goſpel upon their lives! But ſuch there ever were, and ſuch there now are in the viſible church, to the ſcandal of the goſpel, the diſhonor of Chriſt, and the grief of his ſaints. Such drew tears from the eyes of aged Paul. Says he, "Many walk, of whom I have often told you, and now tell you even weeping, that they are enemies to the croſs of Chriſt, whoſe end is deſtruction, whoſe God is their belly, whoſe glory is their ſhame, who mind earthly things," Phil. ii. 18, 19.</p>
            <p>O methinks I ſee the holy man of God, with a flame of burning zeal for his dear Lord's glory, and for the caution and comfort of his real members, crying out, "My beloved brethren in Chriſt, for your ſouls ſake take heed and beware, that you do not catch the ſpirit and temper, and are not infected by the walk and converſation of the <hi>many</hi> who profeſs to believe in our dear Saviour, and to be followers of him; but by their lives

and converſation, they manifeſt that they are not recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rucifixion of their luſts, paſhons and tempers, and thereby prove themſelves the worſt enemies to a crucified Chriſt and his cauſe. They have no love for Chriſt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in, nor conformity to him; but amidſt all their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, their God is their belly. Their chief ſtudy is to pleaſe themſelves. Gold is their idol: and their greateſt ambition is to get riches. What they ought to be moſt aſhamed of, they glory moſt in. Their ſouls are wholly ſwallowed up in earthlythings; and their time in the purſuit of the enjoyment of them. However they may flatter and deceive their ſouls for a ſeaſon, with the maſk of profeſſion, it will ſoon drop off, and their end will be deſtruction.</p>
            <p>My brethren, permit one, who through rich grace, has eſcaped (as with the ſkin of his teeth) this prevailing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion, of reſting in doctrinal notions, and empty ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, to apprize you of the evil of this; and to warn you againſt the danger of ſtopping ſhort of the experience of the life, love and power of the grace of Chriſt, and walking in fellowſhip with him. It is this will ſet our ſouls free from low and legal bondage, and ſervile ſlavery to our domineering tempers and lordly paſſions. While we walk in the liberty of Chriſt; in the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the goſpel of grace and peace we ſhall not ſet at nought, but conſtantly attend to, and joyfully obey, the precious exhortations of the Spirit in the word. And this from the moſt generous principles, the belief of the truth, the grace of God, and the love of Chriſt; and to the moſt valuable ends, the glory of God, the honor of Chriſt, and the adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his goſpel. And ſay now, let precious faith and heavenly love anſwer, Are we not under the moſt prevailing and powerful obligations to God and Chriſt, thus to live and walk?</p>

Conſider, Hath God ſo loved us, even when in our natural enmity to him, and rebellion againſt him, as to give his only begotten Son to redeem and ſave us? Hath he ſo commended, ſo ſet forth his love towards us, that while we were his enemies and ungodly, Chriſt died for us? Doth the goſpel proclaim this to us? Hath God the Holy Spirit, when dead in treſpaſſes and ſins, quickened our ſouls to hear and believe this joyful news; and to come unto Chriſt for preſent pardon, peace, and juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and to enjoy the lively hope in him, of eternal life and glory with him? And do we expect ſoon to be abſent from this body of ſin and death, and to be for ever preſent with our Lord? What concluſion doth generous faith and heaven-born love teach us to make from all this? Peter draws a moſt bleſſed one for us; and which faith, love and hope, will moſt joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully acquieſce in, "What manner of perſons ought we to be, in all holy converſation and godlineſs, looking for and haſting unto the coming of the day of God?" 2 Pet. iii. 11, 12.</p>
            <p>But, O my brethren, in how many inſtances of their command over their paſſions and tempers, do the very heathens ſhame us, and riſe up, and condemn us? One of them, having an entertainment, with a large company, his ſervant committing a fault, haſtily flew into a paſſion, and with great eagerneſs lifted up his hand in order to ſtrike him; but ſuddenly recollecting himſelf, that he was in the company and preſence of wiſe philoſophers, he kept his arm lifted up to the utmoſt ſtretch. This drew their attention to him. And one aſked, What is the matter? To which he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>eplied, Nothing, but only by this I am expoſing the folly of, and puniſhing an angry man." O let us always remember, that we<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ever live and act in the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0732201200:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſight and preſence of the moſt wiſe God, and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt. Let that be a curb to our tempers, and a bridle to our paſſions.</p>
            <p>The Lord is at hand. Let therefore our modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of temper and ſpirit, be known unto all men. Let our zeal for Chriſt's honor and glory, be our deepeſt concern. Let us be careful for nothing ſo much as to pleaſe him. Let us be fearful of nothing ſo much as to offend him. The Lord of all grace make us ſtrong in faith, and chearful in love, that we may be both willing and able to bring our every evil temper, ſinful paſſion, and inordinate affection, to the foot of his croſs, and to ſacrifice them daily to the glory of him who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured the death of the croſs for us. The Lord enable us to walk in love, even as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us, an offering and a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice to God, of a ſweet ſmelling ſavor. The Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt be with your ſpirits.</p>
