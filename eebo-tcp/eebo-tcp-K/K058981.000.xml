         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>When I firſt paid my addreſſes to Miſs Bloomer, ſuch were the beauties of her mind as well

                  <speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
                  <p>A fool's one, rather,—ſhe received me with ſuch a flattering diſtinction that I thought myſelf the happieſt of mortals, when unluckily, her guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian's dying put her into the immediate poſſeſſion of a large fortune.</p>
               </sp>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
                  <p>Quite the contrary,—thus freed from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, at the age of eighteen, ſhe emerged into all the faſhionable follies of the great world, without a real friend to adviſe, or direct her.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>I did, but ſoon found it was an ungrateful one—ſo fine a girl, independent of intereſted mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, cou'd not fail of attracting a crowd of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers; and—</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
                  <p>Jealous! My heart was torn in pieces.—'Twas then I diſcover'd a levity of temper, a thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs, a love of pleaſure, that deſtroy'd my hopes.</p>

                  <speaker>Sedl.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, but in time they threaten a total eclipſe.—No character, however contemptible, but was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged as a lover.—No ſcene of gaiety, however cenſurable, but was purſued with avidity.—A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand inſtances did I patiently bear with, in hopes of amendment.—Oft in the gentleſt terms, did I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey advice, and repreſent the hazards ſhe ran; as oft was I forbad her preſence.</p>

                  <speaker>Sedl.</speaker>

<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0569000100:12"/>Woodford; though never man was more ſenſible of beauty's charms than I, yet unleſs thoſe charms are adorned with virtue, they make not half the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>

                  <p>Why, I am a little alarmed,—for to confeſs the truth ſincerely, which in thoſe caſes I very ſeldom do—Of all the men that ever addreſs'd me, he is the only one who has made an impreſtion on my heart.</p>

                  <speaker>Miſs Bloom.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis not in my nature to be ſerious long together, therefore why ſhould he expect it?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Miſs Belg.</speaker>
                  <p>Conſider the many obligations you are under to him.—The many dangers he reſcued you from, which your innocent levity expoſed you to.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Miſs Bloom.</speaker>
                  <p>That's true; but then he ſhould not have taken ſo ungenerous an advantage of them, as to tell me, that I did wrong, and preſcribe rules for my future conduct.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Miſs Belg.</speaker>
                  <p>Were not thoſe rules for your good?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Miſs Bloom.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, but we are not always diſpos'd to reliſh advice.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Miſs Belg.</speaker>
                  <p>I really think, if you loſe him, you'll never meet with ſuch another.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Miſs Bloom.</speaker>
                  <p>If I am diſappointed of him, I ſhall never have any other, that's paſt a doubt—And as a proof, were he now to return, I would frankly own, that, though I am innocent, even in intention of acting wrong, yet, my thoughtleſſneſs, many times, leads me into great errors, which nothing but the ſincerity of my heart can excuſe.</p>

                  <speaker>Miſs Bloom.</speaker>
                  <p>Pſha! he muſt take me, as he finds me.—Can he be ſo unconſcionable as to expect, that I ſhould draw up my head, hold down my eyes, put my hands together, drop him a low curteſy, and ſay,—I have been a naughty girl to be ſure, but, pray forgive me this time, and indeed, and double deed, I'll do ſo no more?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Miſs Belg.</speaker>
                  <p>No, but he might reaſonably expect, that you'd diſmiſs your numerous train of followers;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0569000100:25"/>—and, as you have often ſacrificed men of worth at the ſhrine of folly, ſo in return, to make a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral oblation—Offer up a hecatomb of fools, at the altar of diſcretion.</p>

                  <p>You ſee I am laid upon the ſtocks a little, but no matter for that—Tho' my out-works are ſomething damaged, yet my inſide is heart of oak.</p>

                  <speaker>Sedley.</speaker>
                  <p>I am glad to hear it—Preſuming, Captain, on the regard you always profeſt for me, I am now come to intercede in behalf of your nephew.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Helm.</speaker>
                  <p>Avaſt, avaſt, tack about, and pay away no more of that cable—My nephew, d'ye ſee, is a lazy land-lubber—If he had taken my advice, I would have made a man of him, and taught him to hand, reef, and ſteer, with e'er a ſeaman in the navy.</p>

                  <speaker>Helm.</speaker>
                  <p>Then their taſte is not worth a rope's end—I myſelf, tho' a younger brother, made my own for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune while his father was ſquandering away his—I was twice round the globe, before I was forty—In every birth, from cabbin-boy, up to Captain of the Terrible—And now, having ſufficient to lie by, I am reſolved to enjoy it, and ride in a ſmooth har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour all the reſt of my days.</p>

                  <p>But, Captain, tho' you was ſo fond of the ocean, and had ſuch ſucceſs, your nephew may not have the ſame inclinations, and you ſhould make ſome allowance.</p>

                  <p>No, the more danger, the more honour—Mayhap, you may think it ſtrange, that after ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long clear of a wife, I ſhould, all of a ſudden, veer about, and clap the matrimonial tack aboard.</p>

                  <p>UPON my word, Miſs, this is the moſt oddeſt affair I was ever extricated in during the whole current of my life—After getting ſo artificially off as you did, for Mr. Sedley to diſſuade your lovyer to return you to your mamma again, inſtead of flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing away to Scotland without redemption—Well! I own its above my compacity to find out.</p>

                  <p>Ay, or mine either—I'm ſure, I never looked ſo fooliſh in all my life, as when I found we were not to be married.</p>

                  <speaker>Flora.</speaker>
                  <p>And then, Frippery, to be diſappointed of ſuch a delightful jaunt, and expoſed to the ridicule of all one's acquaintance—'Tis, enough to make me cry my eyes out.</p>

                  <p>Why, as by ſuch a precipitate ſtep we ſhould entirely forfeit the favour of his uncle, and my mamma, without the leaſt chance of recovery, he perſuaded Woodford to wait the iſſue of a ſcheme which he is going to execute immediately—For my part, if it does ſucceed, I ſhall loſe half the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure I expected in being married in Scotland.</p>

                  <p>You are right, Miſs, and ſpeak the ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of moſt of the girls who go there—Why, I might have been married three years ago to Mr. Scraper, Lord Supple's footman, but that we could not raiſe
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0569000100:77"/>money enough between us to get there, and I was determined never to follow the vulgar faſhion, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſked in church.</p>

                  <p>The Frenchman, of character and probity, I admire and eſteem—Virtue is not confin'd to clime or complexion, its radient emanations illumine every nation—Yet ſtill, I would not faſhionably encourage the reſuſe of foreign countries, while native merit lies buried in oblivion.</p>

                  <p>True, Boy, and as this ſeems but a bad harbour to anchor long in, let us all ſteer away for my cabin, where you ſhall have the beſt cheer an old bachelor can give, and as hearty a welcome as the braveſt ſailor in the navy.</p>

                  <p>We accept your offer, Captain, happy in having our adventures brought to ſo agreeable a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion—I only beg leave to remark—That though our follies and vices juſtly deſerve the comic laſh—Yet, when, inſtead of perſevering, we nobly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our errors, and amend—Satire then loſes her ſting, our foibles turn to virtues, and, the moſt permanent felicity ariſes from THE MISTAKES OF THE HEART.</p>
