            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFATORY ADDRESS
FROM THE
PUBLISHER.</head>
            <p>SOLICITOUS as the public are to have
a perfect copy of the moſt eloquent
ſpeech that was ever delivered in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
their wiſhes muſt be in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
diſappointed from the very liberal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination
of <hi>Mr. Sheridan</hi> to give no
kind of aſſiſtance in reporting it publickly;
a determination that does as much honour
to his humanity, as his Oration does to his
abilities.—Having called forth his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful
talents whilſt in the double office of
a ſenator, and an accuſer of the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquent,
he now ſinks the apparent, tho' juſt
ſeverity of the <hi>public character,</hi> in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
ſenſibility of the <hi>private individual;</hi>
and generouſly withholds that torrent of
eloquence which muſt excite in every breaſt
ſentiments of indignation againſt the atrocity
which demanded it to flow.—The intention
of this publication is not to excite thoſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1125601100:3"/>
the noble-minded ſpeaker wiſhes to
ſuppreſs; it is not to hold forth the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of an Eaſtern ſpoiler, for "ſcorn to point
the finger at;" —it is meant to commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
the virtues of a patriot mind, vindicating
the honor of his country, and pleading the
cauſe of humanity; and, as near as is in the
power of recollection, to preſerve to the
public eye, partially at leaſt, one of the moſt
complete pieces of Oratory that ever graced
an Engliſh, or any other Senate.</p>
            <p>In doing this, the Reporter frankly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes
the fallibility of the means—all that
he can boaſt is, to have come as near the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
as the reminiſcent faculties of a perſon
habituated to parliamentary buſineſs, would
permit. How far they have ſucceeded, thoſe
who had the felicity of being preſent, are
the moſt competent to judge.</p>

            <head>Mr. SHERIDAN'S SPEECH,
<date>FEBRUARY 7, 1787,</date>
ON THE
Fourth Charge againſt Mr. Haſtings:</head>
            <opener>IN a Committee <hi>of the whole Houſe, Mr. St.
John</hi> in the chair.</opener>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Dempſter</hi> having communicated to the
houſe, that a paper, which he held in his
hand, had been received by him from Sir Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah
Impey, with a requeſt that he would read
it; as it was explanatory of ſome paſſages
which he had given in evidence at the bar of
the Houſe, but which explanation the Houſe
did not think proper to receive, but from the
mouth of Sir Elijah Impey himſelf, and he not
being preſent, Mr. SHERIDAN was called
upon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1125601100:5"/>
Mr. <hi>Sheridan,</hi> during a ſpeech which laſted
near five hours and three quarters, command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the moſt profound attention and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Houſe. His matchleſs oration
united the moſt ſolid argument with the
moſt perſuaſive eloquence. His ſound rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
giving additional energy to truth, and
his logical perſpicuity, and unerring judgment,
throwing a light upon, and pervading the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity,
of the moſt involved and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
ſubject.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan's pre-eminence and unrivalled
abilities, will, from this period, ſtand record<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
as having had power to aſſimilate the
moſt diſcordant ſentiments, upon a great and
trying occaſion, and (with a few exceptions,)
to unite the various opinions of the multitude in
one point.—He commenced his elegant ſpeech
by ſaying, that had it been poſſible to have
received, without the violation of the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
rules of Parliament, the paper which the
Honourable Gentleman (Mr. Dempſter) had
juſt now read, he ſhould willingly have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
from any forms of the Houſe, for the
purpoſe of obtaining farther illuſtration of the
ſubject then before them: yet he had not
come ſo ill prepared, as, by a trifling circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
to be prevented from proceeding to the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1125601100:6"/>
diſcharge of his duty, or that the want of it
could make any impreſſion on the body of
proof he was to bring forward that day a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
Warren Haſtings.</p>
            <p>In his opinion, the explanation of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
ſo far from throwing any new light upon
it and clearing it up, rendered it even more
obſcure and contradictory than before. Every
art was made uſe of to impreſs the Houſe
with an idea that this buſineſs was not of the
moſt ſerious nature. But this was far beneath
his notice. The juſtice and ſtrength of his
cauſe were not to be overcome by ſuch pitiful
and flimſey expedients; nor ſhould he waſte
his time in oppoſing meaſures which were as
paltry and inefficacious, as they were inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious.</p>
            <p>He would not, he ſaid, encroach upon the
time of the committee with any general argn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to prove, what was in itſelf ſo obvious,
that the ſubject of the charge, which it fell to
his lot to bring forward, was of great magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
The attention Parliament had beſtowed
upon Indian concerns for many ſeſſions paſt;
the voluminous productions of their commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees
on that ſubject, the various proceedings
in that Houſe reſpecting it, their own ſtrong
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1125601100:7"/>
and pointed reſolutions, the repeated recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations
of his Majeſty, and their repeated
aſſurances of paying due regard to thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendations,
as well as various acts of
the legiſlature, were, all of them, undeniable
proofs of the moment and magnitude of the
conſideration, and tended to eſtabliſh this
broad fact, that they acknowledged the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
name and character to have been diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured
and deteſted throughout India, by
the malverſation and crimes of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
of the Eaſt India Company. That fact
having been eſtabliſhed beyond all queſtion,
by themſelves and their own acts, there need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
no argument, on his part, to induce the
committee to ſee the importance of the ſubject
about to be diſcuſſed that day, in a more ſtrik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
point of view than they had themſelves
placed it in.</p>
            <p>There were, he knew, perſons, without
doors, who affected to ridicule the idea of
proſecuting Mr. Haſtings, and, in proportion
as the proſecution became more ſerious, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
their ſarcaſms upon the ſubject, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting
that Parliament might be more uſefully
employed; that there were matters of more
immediate moment to engage their attention;
that a Commercial Treaty with France had
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1125601100:8"/>
juſt been concluded, and that it was an object
of a vaſt comprehenſive nature, and was of it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſufficient to engroſs their conſideration.</p>
            <p>To all this he would oppoſe theſe queſtions:
Was Parliament miſpending its time, by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
into the oppreſſions practiſed on mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
of unfortunate perſons in India, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to bring the daring delinquents,
who had been guilty of the moſt flagrant acts
of enormous tyranny and rapacious pecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to exemplary and condign puniſhment?
Was it improperly employed in giving an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
but ſevere example to their future ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
of the madneſs and folly of relying on
corruption and ſycophancy for ſupport, in the
day of trial for their crimes? Was it a miſuſe
of their functions, to be dilligent in attempting,
by the moſt effectual means, to wipe off the
diſgrace that ſtood affixed to the Britiſh name
in India, and to reſcue the national character
from laſting infamy? Were the good faith
and credit of Britain of no conſequence in
the eyes of the repreſentatives of the nation?
Surely no man who felt for either the one or
the other, would think that a buſineſs of greater
moment or magnitude could occupy his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention,
or that the Houſe could with too much
ſteadineſs, too ardent a zeal, or too induſtrious
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1125601100:9"/>
a perſeverance, purſue its object. Indeed they
muſt all know and feel the neceſſity of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
this important caſe to the iſſue now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended.
Their conduct in this reſpect laſt
year had done them immortal honour, and
proved to all the world, that, however dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
an example of the conduct of Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
ſome of the Britiſh ſubjects had exhibited
in India, the people of England collectively,
ſpeaking and acting by their repreſentatives,
felt as men ſhould feel on ſuch an oecaſion;
that they were anxious to do juſtice, by redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
injuries and puniſhing offenders, however
high their rank, however elevated their ſtation.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan ſaid he would exhibit to their
view a body of information, which would prove
the commiſſion of the moſt horrid crimes ever
conceived by the fouleſt heart that ever inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
a human frame; facts which perſons
of every party, of every political bias in this
kingdom, had been aſſiſting in bringing to
view. In theſe had the indefatigable attention
and labour of ſeveral committees been employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
it was the work of many years: theſe were
fully demonſtrated in the various clear and
elaborate reports which had been long upon
their table; their long and intereſting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1125601100:10"/>
their ſolemn addreſs to the throne, and
their rigorous legiſlative acts.</p>
            <p>The vote of the Houſe laſt ſeſſion, wherein the
conduct of this pillar of India, this corner ſtone
of our ſtrength in the eaſt, this talliſman of
the Britiſh dominions in Aſia, was cenſured,
did the greateſt honour to that houſe, as it
muſt be the fore-runner of ſpeedy juſtice on
<hi>that character</hi> which was ſaid to be above cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and whoſe conduct, we were given to
underſtand, was above ſuſpicion, His deeds
were ſuch, they could not be juſtified by any
poſſible neceſſity; for no ſituation, however
elevated, however embarraſſed, could juſtify a
man for committing acts of rapacity upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals.
To the honour of that Houſe, they
had reſiſted the monſtrous argument attempted
to be ſet up, they had ſhewn their deteſtation
of that novel and baſe ſcepticiſm on the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of judicial enquiry, conſtantly the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage
of the Governor General's <hi>ſervile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents;</hi>
that ſuch horrid crimes ſhould be
compounded; that, though <hi>M. Haſtings</hi> might
be guilty of all the charges exhibited againſt
him, he ought not to be puniſhed; he ſhould
ſtill be conſidered as the <hi>ſaviour of India,</hi> and
that fortunate events were a full and complete
fet-off againſt a ſyſtem of oppreſſion, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1125601100:11"/>
breach of faith, peculation and treachery.
What though King, Lords, and Commons,
were againſt him, he was not a perſon to be
aſſailed; for he had a vote of thanks from the
Court of Proprietors in his pocket. The
committee had, however, nobly combated
ſuch doctrine, and declared that <hi>Mr. Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings</hi>'s
treatment of <hi>Cheyt Sing</hi> was unjuſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
upon any ground of political neceſſity.
Their ſolemn and awful judgment, that in the
caſe of Benares, Mr. Haſtings's conduct was
a proper object of parliamentary impeachment,
had covered them with applauſe, and brought
them forward in the face of all the world as
the objects of perpetual admiration. To uſe
the words of a Right Honourable Gentleman
(Mr. Pitt) on this ſubject, the committee had
found in the adminiſtration of Mr. Haſtings,
"<hi>Acts of ſtrong injuſtice, of grinding oppreſſion, and
nnprovoked ſeverity.</hi>" That committee had alſo
reſcued his Right Honourable Friend (Mr.
Burke) from the imputation of being a falſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer,
they had ſhewn that he was not moved by
envy, by malice, nor any unworthy motives to
blacken a ſpotleſs name; they had approved him
to be, what in reality he was, an indefatigable,
and, he was happy to add, a ſucceſsful, cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion
in the cauſe of truth, humanity, and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice.
With ſound judgment, with manly firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1125601100:12"/>
with unſhaken integrity, had his Right
Honourable Friend reſiſted the timid policy
of mere <hi>remedial</hi> acts. Even the high opinion
of Mr. Haſtings's ſucceſſor, even the admitted
worth of Lord Cornwallis's character, had
been deemed by him an inadequate atonement
to India for the injuries ſo heavily inflicted on
her. The committee had by their vote ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly
pledged themſelves to India. They
had audibly ſaid to the inhabitants of that
country; There ſhall be no more <hi>remedial</hi> acts:
You ſhall no longer be ſeduced into temporary
acquieſcence, by ſending out a titled governor,
or a vapouring ſet of reſolutions; It is not with
ſtars and ribbands, and all the badges of regal
favour, that weatone to you for paſt delinquen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
theſe ſhould bend to the ſacred ſhrine of
juſtice, and the people of India ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
of our honeſt intentions. You ſhall
have the ſolid conſolation of ſeeing an end to
your grievances, by an example of puniſhment
for paſt offences. The Houſe has ſet up a bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con,
which, while it ſerved as a guide to
themſelves, would alſo make their motions
more conſpicuous to the world that ſurrounded
and beheld them. He had no doubt of their
manly determination to go through the whole
of the buſineſs, with the ſame ſteadineſs which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1125601100:13"/>
gave ſuch ſterling brilliancy of character to
their outſet, and that they might ſafely chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge
the world, to obſerve and judge of them
by the reſult.</p>
            <p>After an exordium of this tendency, Mr.
Sheridan took notice of a paper, ſigned "War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren
Haſtings," which had been put into his
hand, as he entered the houſe that day, and
which he conſidered as a ſecond defence, and a
ſecond anſwer to the charge he was about to
bring forward; a charge, replete with proof of
criminality of the blackeſt die, of tyranny the
moſt baſe and unprecedented, of treachery the
moſt vile and premeditated, of corruption the
moſt open and ſhameleſs, of oppreſſion the moſt
grinding and ſevere, and cruelty the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
and unparalleled.</p>
            <p>There never was a queſtion ſince the creation
of the world, wherein ſo much cruelty, wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
inhumanity and depravity, were put to
the teſt, as in the preſent caſe. He was no
party accuſer: <q>I call, ſaid Mr. Sheridan,
upon his advocates to watch my words, and
to take them down. I will exhibit no charge
that has not ſolid truth for its foundation, for
I truſt nothing to declamation.</q> Mr. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridan
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1125601100:14"/>
added; he was far from meaning to reſt
the charge on aſſertion, or on any warm ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
that the impulſe of wounded feelings
might produce: He would eſtabliſh every part
of the charge, by the moſt unanſwerable proof,
and the moſt unqueſtionable evidence; the
witneſs, whom he would bring forth to ſupport
every fact he intended to ſtate, ſhould be, for the
moſt part, a witneſs that no man would venture
to contradict; no other than <hi>Warren Haſtings</hi>
himfelf!</p>
            <p>And yet ſuch a character had friends—he
blamed them not—they might poſſibly conclude
him innocent;—becauſe he himſelf aſſerted it
was ſo.</p>
            <p>The defence of Mr. Haſtings would eſtabliſh
every charge he had to make againſt him.
There was not one fact which was not founded
on, or mixed with falſehood; no one queſtion
that was truly given; nor one ſingle concluſion
which followed fairly from the premiſes laid
down: but of this aſſertion, the multiplied proofs
would ſhortly ariſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan ſaid he would go farther back
into a detail of facts than his Right Honourable
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1125601100:15"/>
friend had done in his charge, in order the
more clearly to ſhew the committee the ſituation
in which the Britiſh government of India ſtood
with reſpect to the Nabob of Oude and the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums,
till the deſign of obliging the Nabob to
plunder thoſe unfortunate Princeſſes (his mother
and grandmother) of their treaſures, to confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
their Jaghires and ſeize upon the miniſters,
throw them into a dungeon, there load them
with chains, and keep them for many months
cloſe priſoners, ſuffering incredible hardſhips,
was firſt entertained by the Governor General.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan here read a variety of extracts
from Mr. Haſtings's defence; wherein were
ſtated the various ſteps taken by Mr. <hi>Briſtow,</hi>
(the Company's Reſident at Fyzyabad,) in the
years 1775 and 1776, to procure aid for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bob,
from the Begum, (the dowager princeſſes of
that diſtrict,) and that he thought proper to
exact, by his ſole authority, thirty lacks of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pees,
for the uſe of the Nabob Vizier of Oude,
out of the treaſures bequeathed to the Begum
by her late huſband Sujah Dowla; obtaining
however the guarantee of the Governor and
Council that, that exaction, for which no ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
of right was ſhewn, ſhould be the laſt. Mr.
Haſtings, however, had not ſtated one of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1125601100:16"/>
facts truly. Groundleſs, nugatory and inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
were his affirmations, that the ſeizure of
treaſures from the Begums, and the expoſition
of their pilfered goods to public auction, (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallelled
acts of open injuſtice, oppreſſion and
inhumanity) were in any degree to be defended
by thoſe incroachments on their property, which
had taken place previous to his adminiſtration,
or by thoſe ſales which they themſelves had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited,
as a favourable mode of their ſupplying
a part of their aid to the Nabob. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of a ſeries of plain indiſputable facts, would
irrecoverably overthrow a ſubterfuge ſo pitiful, a
diſtinction ſo ridiculous. It muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
that, at that period, the Begums did not
<hi>merely deſire,</hi> but they moſt <hi>expreſly ſtipulated,</hi>
that of the thirty lacks promiſed, eleven ſhould
be paid in ſundry articles of manufacture. Was
it not obvious therefore, that the ſale of goods
in the firſt caſe, far from partaking of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of an act of plunder, became an extenſion
of relief, of indulgence, and of accommodation.
By the paſſages which he ſhould beg leave to
read, <hi>Mr. Haſtings</hi> wiſhed to inſinuate that a
claim was ſet up to the Begum's treaſure, as
belonging of right to the Nabob. In this
tranſaction Mr. Haſtings endeavoured to ſhift
the reſponſibility from himſelf to the majority
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1125601100:17"/>
of the Council, and under that authority to keep
alive the Nabob's right.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan, in order to prove the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of the Princeſſes in 1775, which
was much aggravated in 1781, read an extract
of a letter from the Bhow Begum, mother
of the Nabob, to Mr. Haſtings, received at
Calcutta December 22, 1775, wherein ſhe ſays,
<q>If it is <hi>your pleaſure</hi> that the mother of the
late Nabob, myſelf, and his other women,
and infant children, ſhould be reduced to a
ſtate of diſhonour and diſtreſs, we <hi>muſt ſubmit;</hi>
but if, on the contrary, you call to mind the
friendſhip of the late bleſſed Nabob, you will
exert yourſelf effectually in favour of us, who
are helpleſs.</q> And again, <q>If you do not
approve of my remaining at Fyzyabad, ſend
a perſon here, in your name, to remove the
mother of the late Nabob, myſelf, and about
2000 women and children, that we may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
with honour and reputation in ſome other
place.</q> This letter and ſeveral others were
read, to prove the controuling power of Mr.
Haſtings in Oude, at ſo late a period as before
mentioned; and to prove that every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of oppreſsion and exaction, practiſed on
theſe Princeſſes, was done by the orders, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1125601100:18"/>
and approbation, of the Governor, who
was ſuppoſed to be paramount in Oude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Treaſure,</hi> which was the true ſource of all
the cruelties, was the original pretence which
Mr. Haſtings made to the Company for the
meaſure; and through the whole of his conduct
he makes Mahomedaniſm an excuſe; as if he
meant to inſinuate, that there was ſomething in
Mahomedaniſm which made it impious in a
ſon, not to plunder his mother. But, to ſhew
how the queſtion preciſely ſtood when Mr.
Haſtings begun the attack, Mr. Sheridan read
the Minutes of General Clavering, Colonel
Monſon, and Mr. Francis, who ſeverally ſpoke
of a claim which had been made by the Nabob
on the Bhow Begum, in the year 1775, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to two and a half lacks. The opinion con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in thoſe minutes was, that women were,
on the death of their huſbands, entitled by the
Mahomedan law, only to the property within
the Zenana where they lived. This opinion
was deciſive. Mr. Briſtow uſed no threats; no
military execution or rigor was even menaced
the Begums complied with the requiſition then
made, and the diſputed property then claimed
was given up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1125601100:19"/>
After this, the farther treaſure that was
within the Zenana, was confeſſedly her own.
No farther right was ſet up, no pretence of any
kind was advanced, to claim the reſidue. Nay,
a treaty was ſigned by the Nabob, and ratified,
by the Reſident, Mr. Briſtow that, on her
paying thirty lacks, ſhe ſhould be freed from
all farther applications; and the Company were
bound, by Mr. Briſtow, to guarantee this treaty.
Here then was the iſſue. After this treaty thus
ratified, could there be an argument as to the
right of the treaſures of the Begums? If the
Mahomedan law had given a right, was not that
right concluded?</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan averred, that the Mahomedan
law did not authorize the ſeizure of the Princeſſes
property; that ſeveral jaghires were left them
by the late Nabob Sujah Doulah for their own
maintenance, and the education of their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren;
that the plunder was never authoriſed by
the Board; and that military execution being
uſed for the recovery of the exactions, was
contrary to every principle of juſtice; and that
the Nabob complied reluctantly in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances:
that Mr. Briſtow acted under the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
of his immediate ſuperior: that, when the
whole tranſaction was cenſured, Mr. Haſtings
then threw off all reſponſibility, and appealed
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1125601100:20"/>
pealed to the orders of the Board, at a
time, when he knew the authority of the
Board was veſted in himſelf alone, there
being only one other member; and the
Governor having the caſting voice, every
act muſt become his own. This, ſaid
Mr. Sheridan, is ſomewhat ſimilar to the
following caſe.—If, ſome five years
hence, I was to become a warm ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer
of Mr. Haſtings's late adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration,
and from friendſhip, become
his panegyriſt; would not ſome perſon
who hears me now, remind me of my
accuſations againſt him, and ſay to me,
Why this ſudden change of opinion?
I could only anſwer, that I thought ſo
then; but ſince that time I had changed
my opinion, and that I was not anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
now for what I then did in my
official capacity. What muſt the world
think of ſuch tergiverſation, of ſuch
meanneſs? Is there any man in this
Houſe that would countenance ſuch a
nefarious procedure? After a ſolemn gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee
and aſſignment is entered into, thus
to break the public faith, which was
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1125601100:21"/>
pledged to preſerve their property, is a
tranſaction that honor ſhrinks from. The
Begums were ſaid to be in the habits of
diſturbing the public peace; but there is
no inſtance on record of any ſuch attempt,
until the revolution of Benares; and then
all India ſeemed to be hoſtile to England.</p>
            <p>I would here ſit down, and reſt my
queſtion of cenſure, on the iſſue of what
has been produced; as it muſt be clear to
every member, that the princeſſes were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled
to our protection; and that every
hoſtile attempt, to wreſt their property
from them, was unjuſt and diſgraceful. I
require no other proof for this than Mr.
Haſtings's own words, wherein he ſays,
<q>That our officious interference made
us many foes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In 1778, we entered into another treaty
with the Nabob, which was negotiated
by Mr. Middleton, wherein it was ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated,
that the Bhow Begum was not to
be moleſted; and, not long after, Mr.
Haſtings tranſmits to the Court of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectors
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1125601100:22"/>
a diſtreſsful picture of the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Nabob, of the horrors and
famine which triumphed over his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
            <p>If it were poſſible for a country to be
ſtill more diſtreſſed, the Nabob's territo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
were ſo in the year 1780; but, at that
period, there was a majority in council,
whoſe ſentiments were by no means fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to the perſecuting ſchemes of the
Governor; and, for this reaſon, there was
then no offer to moleſt the property of
the Begums.</p>
            <p>In the ſubſequent year, however, the
Governor took eſpecial care to furniſh
himſelf with power. The treaty of <hi>Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar</hi>
was executed; and ſurely a treaty, ſo
marked with diſſimulation, was never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
entered into: the Governor made
himſelf reſponſible for every political tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaction
in that ravaged and oppreſſed
country.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:1125601100:23"/>
Mr. Sheridan ſaid he had now reached
the period, when Mr. Haſtings's firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
appeared, to enforce the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his projects at all events; when,
by <hi>Mr. Middleton,</hi> his private agent, he
urged the Nabob <hi>Aſoph ul Dowla,</hi> to
break this ſolemn engagement, ſanctioned
by the guarantee of the Company, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive
his mother, and the elder Begum, his
grandmother, of the jaghires which were
aſſigned for their ſupport; and proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſtill farther to plunder them of their
treaſures, which he had avowed to be their
ſole property, and which he had ſolemnly
pledged himſelf ſhould remain inviolate.
It was a little difficult, however, here to
ſay, what was the queſtion at iſſue. It
had ſometimes been ſaid, that the Nabob
had an inherent right to this wealth, as
the wealth of the ſtate; but when it was
recollected that it was not made up of the
produce of taxes, but collected by the
conqueſts of his father, Sujah Dowla, by
him bequeathed as a perſonal acquiſition,
(prudently for his ſon,) whom it would
only make the object of rapacious attack,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1125601100:24"/>
and to whom he, with more wiſdom, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed
neceſſity as his ſword, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty
as his ſhield; and when it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
in what manner, and on what
condition, it was relinquiſhed by the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bob,
and that dereliction guaranteed by the
Company, he thought that ground of
defence would ſcarcely be occupied on the
preſent day. Mr. Haſtings in his defence
had taken a more extended field, where
there was more ſcope for his deluſion,
more amplitude for his equivocation. He
had admitted the right to have reſted in
the Begums, but contended that it had
been forfeited by their frequent acts of
contumacy and rebellion. This allegation
againſt them had been divided into four
parts:—The charges were the following.</p>
            <p>1. That they had given diſturbances at
all times to the Nabob, and that they had
long manifeſted a ſpirit, hoſtile to his and
to the Engliſh government:</p>
            <p>2. That they excited the Zemindars to
revolt, at the time of the inſurrection at
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1125601100:25"/>
Benares, and of the reſumption of the
Jaghires:</p>
            <p>3. That they reſiſted by armed force
the reſumption of their own Jaghires: and</p>
            <p>4. That they excited and were acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
to the inſurrection at Benares.</p>
            <p>To each of theſe charges Mr. Sheridan
made diſtinct and ſeparate anſwers, by a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety
of extracts which he read; ſome of them
written by Mr. Haſtings himſelf, to prove
that they had particularly diſtinguiſhed
themſelves by their <hi>friendſhip</hi> for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,
and the various good offices they
had rendered Government. Againſt the
<hi>firſt</hi> charge <hi>Mr. Sheridan</hi> adduced proofs,
in the moſt pointed terms, from the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
letters which paſſed between Mr. Haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings
and Mr. Middleton, Colonel Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay
and the Nabob. By this correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
it was very evident, that their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
during the period from 1775 to 1781,
ſo far from being what it was repreſented,
had been mild and inoffenſive. Not a
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1125601100:26"/>
ſingle ſymptom of inveteracy, not one
ſolid proof of diſaffection, was mentioned
in theſe letters, but in all, their conduct
appeared as much the reverſe, as it was in
the nature of things to expect. The
<hi>ſecond</hi> charge fell to the ground the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
it was examined; for, ſo far from
any undue influence being uſed on the
part of the <hi>Begums,</hi> to ſtimulate the Jag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hirdars
to reſiſtance, it did not even appear
that the ſmalleſt reſiſtance was made by
the jaghirdars, againſt the violences which
they ſuſtained. The third charge was
equally falſe. Did they reſiſt the reſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their own jaghires? Though, if they
had actually reſiſted, it could not be deemed
criminal; for thoſe jaghires were their own
property, veſted in them and confirmed
to them by a ſolemn treaty. But is there,
in fact, one ſyllable of charge alledged
againſt them? With all the load of
obloquy which the Nabob incurred,
had he ever accuſed them of the crime of
reſiſting his authority? No; he had not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1125601100:27"/>
To prove the falſehood of the whole of
this charge, and to ſhew that Mr. Haſtings
originally projected the plunder; that he
threw the Odium in the firſt inſtance on
the Nabob; that he imputed the crimes
to them, before he had received one of the
rumours which he afterwards manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
into affidavits; he recommended a
particular attention to dates; and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
from the papers theſe clear facts—
that the firſt idea ſprung from Mr. Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
on the 25th of November, 1781;
that Mr. Middleton communicated it to
the Nabob, and procured from him a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal
propoſition on the 2d of December;
That on the 1ſt of December Mr. Haſtings
wrote a letter to Mr. Middleton, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the firſt ſuggeſtion made through Sir
Elijah, which letter came into the hands
of Mr. Middleton on the 6th of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
He ſtated all the circumſtances of
the pains taken by Mr. Middleton, who
was empowered by Mr. Haſtings to force
the Nabob, on whom all the blame is
laid, and whoſe act it was, to ſeize on his
mother's jaghires; and coupled this with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1125601100:28"/>
the extraordinary minute written by Mr.
Haſtings on his return to Calcutta, where
he ſtated the reſiſtance of the Begums to
the execution of the reſumption on the
7th of January, 1782, as the cauſe of the
meaſure in November, 1781. Mr. Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton
had proved that the Nabob had no
ſuch intention, for, in writing to Mr.
Haſtings, he ſays, <q>finding the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bob
wavering in his determination of
the reſumption of the Jaghires, I this
day, (6th Dec. 1781,) in the preſence of
his Miniſter informed him, that unleſs
he would iſſue <hi>his</hi> perwannahs for that
purpoſe, I would iſſue <hi>my</hi> perwannahs.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan then took pains to ſhew,
that the Begums were, by their condition,
their age, their infirmities, &amp;c. almoſt the
only two ſouls in India, who could not in
ſome meaſure have hurt the Government.
He did not, he ſaid, take pains to do this
from any idea, that, becauſe there was no
motive for plundering the women, it might
be aſſerted that it was an improbable falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood:
he was not to learn that there
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1125601100:29"/>
was ſuch a thing as wantonneſs of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.
Thoſe, who had doubts on this
point, had only to read the hiſtory of the
adminiſtration of Mr. Haſtings. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
by the documents, on the table, that
there was, and had always been, inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and diſorder in Oude. To aſcribe it
to the Begums was the moſt improbable
fiction: they might as well ſay, that
famine would not have pinched, that
thirſt would not have parched, that exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination
would not have depopulated,
but for the interference of theſe old women.
To uſe a ſtrong expreſſion of Mr. Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
on another occaſion, <q>The good
that thoſe women did was certain; the
ill was precarious.</q> He, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
took the converſe of the propoſition;
wanting a motive for his rapacity, he could
find it only in fiction. The ſimple fact
was, their treaſure was their treaſon.
They complained of injuſtice: God
of heaven! had they not a right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain?
After a ſolemn treaty violated,
plundered of all their property, and on the
eve of the laſt extremity of wretchedneſs,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1125601100:30"/>
were they to be deprived of the laſt reſource
of impotent wretchedneſs, complaint and
lamentation? Was it a crime that they
ſhould croud together in fluttering trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
like a flock of reſiſtleſs birds in the air,
on ſeeing the felon kite, who, having darted
at one devoted bird and miſſed his aim, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
out a new object, and was ſpringing on
his prey with more vigour in his wing, and
keener lightning in his eye. The fact with
Mr. Haſtings was preciſely this: having
failed in the cauſe of Cheyt Sing, he ſaw his
fate; he felt the neceſſity of procuring a
ſum of money ſomewhere, for he knew
that to be the never-failing receipt to
make his peace with the Directors at
home.</p>
            <p>Such, Mr. Sheridan added, were the
true, ſubſtantial motives of the horrid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes
perpetrated againſt the Begums!
Exceſſes, in every part of the deſcription
of which, he felt himſelf ſupported by the
moſt indiſputable evidence. Here he
would reſt his cauſe. Let gentlemen lay
their hands upon their hearts, and with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1125601100:31"/>
truth iſſuing in all its purity from their
lips, ſolemnly declare, whether they were,
or were not convinced, that the <hi>real</hi> ſpring
of the conduct of Mr. H. far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a deſire to cruſh rebellion, <hi>an ideal fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulous
rebellion!</hi> was a malignantly rapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
determination to ſeize, with lawleſs
hands, upon the treaſures of devoted, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable,
yet unoffending victims.</p>
            <p>Amongſt other proofs which Mr. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridan
brought againſt the ſecond and
fourth charges, was a minute of what
<hi>Mr. Stables</hi> propoſed at the Board, <q>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
any diſaffection to the Engliſh
Government appeared before the troubles
of Benares?</q> Mr. Haſtings remained
ſilent.</p>
            <p>In the farther diſcuſſion of the charges,
<hi>Mr. Sheridan</hi> ſaid, it would be neceſſary
for him to follow the Governor General in
his tour from <hi>Calcutta</hi> to <hi>Chunar,</hi> which
commenced the 8th of July, 1781, a
journey he thought neceſſary to take,
finding the Nabob unwilling to ſeize on
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1125601100:32"/>
his mother's jaghires. Mr. Haſtings had
himſelf ſaid, That he left Calcutta with
the ſtrongeſt idea of the reduced ſtate of
the Company's poſſeſſions, which the
event proved he went to recruit in the
moſt expeditious manner poſſible. Sir
Elijah Impey had ſaid, when under exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination,
that Mr. Haſtings went out
with only two reſources to retrieve the
circumſtances of the Company; namely,
Benares and Oude; Countries already
oppreſſed by the hand of Providence, but
more ſo by the wicked and arbitrary ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chinations
of man. What a horrid idea!
No other reſource but the plunder of a
famiſhed country! Can any ſimile equal
it? unleſs I ſuppoſe, a perſon determined
on a robbery, and having failed at Bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot,
reſolves to try his fortune at
Hounſlow.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Benares</hi> it was ſufficiently known
that Mr. Haſtings had failed. There
his prodigal revenge had diſappointed his
rapacity; whence the unfortunate victim of
malicious inſolence had been compelled to
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1125601100:33"/>
wander from his kingdom, a melancholy
example of the viciſſitude of human affairs.
The hopes of plunder at <hi>Oude,</hi> promiſed
to compenſate for his miſcarriage at <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nares.</hi>
Then, and not till then, not thro'
any former enmities ſhewn by the Begums,
not thro' any old diſturbances, but becauſe
he had failed in one place, and that he
had but two in his proſpect, did he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
the expedient of plundering theſe aged
women: he had no pretence, he had no
excuſe for his conduct, but the arrogant
and obſtinate determination to govern India
by his corrupt will. His diſappointment
at <hi>Benares</hi> urged him with rapid ſteps
to <hi>Oude,</hi> where indeed he was but too
ſucceſsful.</p>
            <p>Inflamed by diſappointment in his firſt
project, he haſtened to the fortreſs of
<hi>Chunar,</hi> to meditate the more atrocious
deſign of inſtigating a ſon againſt his
mother; of ſacrificing female dignity and
diſtreſs to parricide and plunder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:1125601100:34"/>
The treaty of <hi>Chunar,</hi> that nefarious
foundation of his future views, being
planned, Mr. Haſtings thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
whilſt he was invading the ſubſtance
of juſtice, to avail himſelf of her judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
forms, and accordingly ſent for Sir
Elijah Impey, the Chief Juſtice of India,
to aſſiſth im.</p>
            <p>Sir Elijah being arrived, Mr. Haſtings,
with much art, propoſed a queſtion of
opinion, involving an unſubſtantiated fact,
in order to obtain even a ſurreptitious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation
of the meaſures he had prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to adopt.</p>
            <p>With regard to the mode of ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
queſtions to Sir Elijah Impey, it
was, he obſerved, ſingular and curious.
In reſpect to the affairs of Cheit Sing,
Mr. Haſtings had ſtated the queſtion,
not in the abſtract merely, but accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
with the fact. To that queſtion
Sir Elijah demurred, not caring to
commit himſelf. With regard to the
Begums, Mr. Haſtings profits by his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1125601100:35"/>
and ſtates the queſtion in the
abſtract, ſaying, "The Begums being in
rebellion, is it not warrantable to ſeize
their treaſures?" To this, (which like
one of the Duke of Richmond's <hi>data,</hi>
carries with it its own anſwer, becauſe
<hi>being in rebellion,</hi> the ſeizure might have
been made,) Sir Elijah anſwers directly
and explicitly in the affirmative, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
not riſking any thing.</p>
            <p>Not a ſyllable of enquiry intervened as
to the exiſtence of the imputed rebellion;
nor a moment's pauſe, as to the ill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes
to which the deciſion of a Chief
Juſtice might be perverted. It was not
the office of a friend to mix the grave
caution and cold circumſpection of a
judge with an opinion taken in ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances;
and Sir Elijah had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly
declared, that he gave his advice
not as a judge, but as a friend; a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
he equally preferred in the ſtrange of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice
which he undertook of collecting de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
affidavits on the ſubject of Benares.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1125601100:36"/>
It was curious, Mr. Sheridan ſaid, to
reflect on the whole of Sir Elijah's cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit
at that perilous time. Sir Elijah had
ſtated his deſire of relaxing from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigues
of office, and unbending his mind
in a party of health and pleaſure; yet,
wiſely apprehending that very ſudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation
might defeat its purpoſe, he
contrived to mix ſome objects of buſineſs
with his amuſements. He had therefore
in his little airing of 900 miles, great part
of which he went poſt, eſcorted by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
ſelected thoſe very ſituations where
inſurrections ſubſiſted, and rebellion was
threatened, and had not only delivered his
deep and curious reſearches into the laws
and rights of nations, and of treaties, in
the capacity of the oriental Grotius, whom
Warren Haſtings was to ſtudy, but like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in the humbler and more practical
ſituation of a collector of <hi>ex parte</hi> evidence.
In the former quality his opinion was the
premature ſanction for plundering the
Begums. In the latter character he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
the poſthumous ſupporter of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1125601100:37"/>
and pillage of the Rajah Cheyt
Sing.</p>
            <p>With a generous oblivion of duty and
honour, with a proud ſenſe of having au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized
all future rapacity, and ſanction<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all paſt oppreſſion, this friendly judge
proceeded on his circuit of health and eaſe;
and while the Governor General, ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
by his ſolemn opinion, iſſued his
orders to plunder the Begums of their
treaſure, Sir Elijah purſued his progreſs,
paſſing through a wide region of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs
and miſery, in queſt of objects beſt
ſuited to his feelings, in anxious ſearch of
calamities moſt kindred to his invalid
imagination. Friendſhip, then, made Sir
Elijah forget what was due to himſelf,
what was due to the high office in
which he was placed, and to the power
which had placed him in it. He was
the laſt man who ought to have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
ſuch an office. He was bound
to have maintained a line of conduct more
conſonant with the elevation of his rank,
the dignity of his office, and the gravity of
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1125601100:38"/>
a judge; who ought to have felt himſelf
incapable of ſoiling his pure ermine, by
condeſcending to run about the country,
like an itinerant informer, with a pedlar's
pack of garbled evidence and ſurreptitious
affidavits.</p>
            <p>He could not be ignorant of the robbery
his errand was intended to cover; for his
firſt queſtion mooted the point. The judge
moſt gravely informs us, that he was cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
not to proceed from <hi>Chunar</hi> by way
of Fyzyabad, as <hi>the Begums were in rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion.</hi>
Moſt friendly advice indeed! Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zyabad
was many ſcore of miles out of
the route of <hi>Lucknow</hi> to <hi>Chunar;</hi> and,
at that moment, peace abſolutely prevailed
in every part of the country; his <hi>datum,</hi>
therefore would have been diſcovered to
be falſe. Nor would it have been very
pleaſant for him to be found at Fyzyabad,
with the actual order in his pocket, by
which they were to be plundered, which
happened to be the fact. Here Mr.
Sheridan proved what he aſſerted, by read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
extracts from authenticated papers.

            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1125601100:41"/>
When Mr. Haſtings arrived at <hi>Chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar,</hi>
he was met by the Nabob with an
open and unſuſpecting heart. Here the
moſt inſidious Treaty on the one part,
that ever was entered into, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed
and concluded; no one article
of it being intended for execution on
the part of the Governor. In the firſt
article it was ſtipulated with one he calls
an <hi>independent Prince</hi> 
               <q>That, as
great diſtreſs has ariſen to the Nabob's
government, from the military power
and dominion aſſumed by the Jag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hierdars,
he be <hi>permitted</hi> to reſume
ſuch as he may find neceſſary; with
a reſerve, that all ſuch, for the amount
of whoſe Jaghires the Company are
guarantees, ſhall, in caſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption
of their lands, be paid the
amount of their net collections, thro'
the Reſident, in ready money. And
that no Engliſh Reſident be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to Furruckabad.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was ſolemnly covenanted, in
direct infraction of a ſubſiſting guaran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1125601100:42"/>
for the protection of the Begum's
Jaghires. And how was this cloaked?
Why, by affidavits, taken extra-judicially
by his Majeſty's Chief Juſtice in Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal,
who ſays very guardedly in his
evidence, that ſeveral perſons depoſed
that a deſign was entered into to extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate
the Engliſh from India. But
when? Not till <hi>after</hi> the tranſactions
at Benares, when the weight of the arm
of power compelled that unfortunate
Prince, Cheyt Sing, to become an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
wanderer, and when the name
of <hi>Briton</hi> became deteſted throughout
Hindoſtan. This artifice was thin,
and the veil was eaſily ſeen through, for
the plan was preconcerted, long before
the revolution at Benares took place.</p>
            <p>This firſt article, containing a general
permiſſion to the Nabob to confiſcate,
and take into his hands ſuch Jaghiers as
he might find neceſſary, Mr. Haſtings
<hi>inverted</hi> ſingularly, by making him con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcate
whatever Jaghiers he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="tcp:1125601100:43"/>
The ſecond article ſtipulated for the
withdrawing of the Britiſh army from
the Province of Oude, which Mr.
Haſtings did, but inverted the article
ſingularly, by reſerving to himſelf a right
to ſend another army into the Province
when he thought proper. The two
other articles, the one for withdrawing
the Britiſh Preſident at Furruckabad, and
the other ſtipulating for putting Fizula
Cawn into the hands of the Nabob, both,
by a ſingular inverſion, Mr. Haſtings
rendered of no effect or avail.</p>
            <p>The unſuſpecting Nabob, in the
warmth of friendſhip, at meeting the
Governor, and concluding a Treaty
which he thought ſalutary to his intereſt,
made him a preſent of ONE HUNDRED
THOUSAND POUNDS. This, exclaimed
<hi>Mr. Sheridan,</hi> was rank corruption in
<hi>Mr. Haſtings.</hi> The circumſtances of
this preſent were as extraordinary as
the thing itſelf. Four months after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
and not till then, Mr. Haſtings
communicated the matter to the Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1125601100:44"/>
unfortunately for himſelf however,
this tardy diſcloſure was conveyed in
words which betray his original mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
for, with no common incaution, he
admits the preſent "<hi>was of a magnitude
not to be concealed.</hi>"</p>
            <p>Then it was publiſhed and made
known, that Bills on <hi>Gopaul Doſs,</hi> the
Banker, (then a priſoner,) were given to
the amount mentioned, payable in four
months. And this was to be extorted
from a country, at the time its Prince
declared his inability to pay his debts,
and when his miniſter <hi>Hyder Beg Cawn</hi>
declared it to be "<hi>a ſpeaking picture of
Famine and Woe.</hi>" <hi>Mr. Sheridan,</hi> in
ſtating all the circumſtances of this bribe,
averred that the whole had its riſe in a
principle of rank corruption; for what was
the price that hepaid? By the treaty he
agreed to withdraw all the Engliſh gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen,
and all the Engliſh army. He
agreed to this at the moment of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
and revolt. The other articles
of the treaty, as ſtrange, nothing but
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1125601100:45"/>
the bribe could have occaſioned, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with the reſerve which he had in
his own mind, of treachery to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bob;
for the only part of the treaty
which he ever attempted to carry into
execution, was to withdraw the Engliſh
gentlemen from <hi>Oude.</hi> The Nabob
conſidered this as eſſential to his deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance,
and his obſervation on the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
was curious; for, <q>though
Major Palmer, <hi>ſaid he,</hi> has not
aſked any thing, I obſerve it is the
cuſtom of the Engliſh gentlemen con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
to aſk for ſomething of me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
they go.</q> This imputation on
the Engliſh Mr. Haſtings countenanced,
moſt readily, and rejoiced at it, as it was
a ſcreen and ſhelter for his own aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
profligacy; and therefore, at the
very moment that he was himſelf plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
the Nabob, with his uſual gravity
and cant, making a feint of executing
this part of the Treaty; <q>Go, ſaid he,
to the Engliſh gentlemen; Go, you ſet
of oppreſſive raſcals; Go from this
worthy unhappy man, whom <hi>you</hi> have
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1125601100:46"/>
plundered, and leave him to <hi>my</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.
You have robbed him, you
have taken advantage of his accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
diſtreſſes; but, pleaſe God, he
ſhall in future be at reſt; for I have
promiſed he ſhall never ſee the face
of an Engliſhman again.</q> This how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
was the only part of the treaty
which he even attempted to fulfil; and
we learn from himſelf, that, at the very
moment he made it, he intended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Nabob. That he adviſed <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi>
inſtead of <hi>partial</hi> reſumption, in
order to defeat the end and view of the
Nabob; and, inſtead of having given
inſtant and unqualified aſſent to all the
articles of the treaty, he had perpetually
qualified, explained, and varied them
with new diminutions and reſervations.</p>
            <p>He had ſuffered the Nabob to take
their Jaghiers from ſeveral Jaghierdars;
but he had compelled him to deprive
others of their's according to his will:
he withdrew the army according to the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1125601100:47"/>
wiſh of the vizier, but it was only to
ſend back almoſt inſtantly an equivalent
force: he reſigned the fortreſſes, but to
garriſon them again immediately. This
might by the friends of Mr. Haſtings,
be deemed policy; but ſurely it was too
clumſy a fraud, too groſs a fallacy, to
deſerve that name. It was however like
the man, though unlike the greatneſs
aſcribed to him.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan put the whole of this
into a very glaring point of view, and
called upon gentlemen to ſay, if there
was any thing in Machiavel, any treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
upon record, if they had ever heard
of any cold Italian fraud, that could in
any degree be put in compariſon with
the diſguſting hypocriſy, and unequalled
baſeneſs, that Mr. Haſtings had ſhewn
on that occaſion.</p>
            <p>In his defence, Mr. Haſtings had made
it his boaſt, that the conduct of his life
had been uniformly governed by the
rules of <hi>honour and plain dealing.</hi> He
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1125601100:48"/>
aſked, how was this bold and daring
aſſertion to be reconciled to his whole
conduct throughout the affair of the
Begums? In every part of which, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquity,
fraud, falſehood, treachery, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
the moſt glaring violation of
juſtice, and the moſt open breach of
ſolemn engagements, were the great and
leading features. He had heard it ſaid by
ſome of his admirers, but who were not ſo
implicit as to give unqualified applauſe to
his crimes, that they found an apology for
the atrocity of his actions in the greatneſs
of his mind. He could not, upon the
cloſeſt examination of his conduct, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the ſmalleſt ſymptoms of either
a great mind, or great ability. To eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate
the ſolidity of ſuch a defence, it
would be ſufficient, merely to conſider
in what conſiſted this prepoſſeſſing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
this captivating characteriſtic of
greatneſs of mind. It was the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic
of magnanimity to aim at
attaining a great end by great means;
to ſupport truth, to protect the weak,
to relieve the oppreſſed, to right the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1125601100:49"/>
injured, to puniſh thoſe that had done
wrong; and, on no conſideration, to
countenance injuſtice. In theſe traits,
and theſe alone, we are to diſcover true
eſtimable magnanimity; to them alone
we can juſtly affix the ſplendid titles and
honours of real greatneſs. Were theſe
the characteriſticks of Mr. Haſtings?
Directly the reverſe. Mr. Haſtings, in
his conduct and in his writings, exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
a ſyſtem made up of things unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
conjoined. His letters and his
minutes were full of ſtrutting meanneſs,
bombaſtical prevarication, and ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly
violent contradictions in terms;
juſt as the maſs and magnitude of his
crimes were contraſted with the little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of his motives, and the low means
he could condeſcend to for the attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his objects. The moſt grovel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ideas, he conveyed in the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flated
language, giving mock conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to low cavils, and uttering quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles
in heroics; ſo that his compoſitions
diſguſted the mind's taſte, as much as
his actions excited the ſoul's abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence.
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1125601100:50"/>
In ſhort, he appeared to be a
mixture of the trickſter and the ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
at once a Scapin and a Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius.
It ſeemed that all his actions
were directed by a low, underhand,
crooked, policy; as well might the
writhing obliquity of the ſerpent be
compared to the direct and unvaried
ſwiftneſs of the arrow, as the duplicity
of Mr. Haſtings's ambition, to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſteadineſs of genuine magnanimity.
Mr. Haſtings, if he ever acted with
wiſdom, it was with perverted wiſdom.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan ſaid, that this mixture
of character ſeemed, by ſome unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable,
but inherent, quality, to be
appropriated in inferior degrees to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
thing that concerned his employers.
He remembered to have heard a learned
gentleman (Mr. Dundas) remark, that
there was ſomething in the original
frame and conſtitution of the Company,
which carried the ſordid ideas of the
mercantile principle on which it was
founded, always about them; ſo that,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1125601100:51"/>
even in all their meaſures and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
we ſaw the paltry character.
Their civil policy and their military
atchievements were connected with and
contaminated by the meanneſs of
pedlars, and the profligacy of pirates.
Thus we ſaw <hi>auctioneering ambaſſadors,</hi>
and <hi>trading generals.</hi>—And thus we ſaw
a revolution brought about by <hi>affidavits,</hi>
an army employed in <hi>executing an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,</hi>
a town beſieged on <hi>a note of hand;</hi>
a prince dethroned for <hi>the balance of
an account.</hi> They exhibited a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,
in which they had all the
mock majeſty of a <hi>bloody ſceptre;</hi> and the
little <hi>traffick of a merchant's counting
houſe,</hi> wielding a truncheon with one
hand, and he might truly ſay, <hi>picking
a pocket with the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He then proceeded to ſtate the conduct
of Mr. Haſtings, in enforcing the reſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jaghire, and the plunder of the
envied treaſure, of the Begums. On the
27th of Nov. 1781, his pleaſure concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that buſineſs was firſt ſent, through
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1125601100:52"/>
Sir Elijah Impey, to Mr. Middleton. On
the 1ſt of December this was backed by
a written order; and it was not, until
the 8th of January following, that the
Nabob could be prevailed on to diſmiſs
his ſcruples; nor, until threatened with
the ſevereſt diſpleaſure of the Governor
General, that he could be compelled to
repair to Fyzyabad, to obey the unnatural
mandate, by plundering his parents. A
reſiſtance was then made by the friends
of the Begums, on finding the violence
intended to them. But, ſtrange to tell!
this reſiſtance was abſolutely alledged by
Mr. Haſtings in his defence, as the ſole
cauſe of the violence! That is to ſay, the
reſiſtance of an unjuſt attack not made
until after the 8th of January, 1782, was
alledged as the foundation of the pleaſure
ſignified on the 27th of November, 1781,
of the written order by which that was
enforced, and all the determinations which
had ſo long preceded! Or, in other
words, the order was ſaid to be founded
on a reſiſtance made to its being executed,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1125601100:53"/>
near ſix weeks after that order was firſt
iſſued.</p>
            <p>Having gone through the facts of the
tranſactions which made up the charge,
<hi>Mr. Sheridan</hi> next adverted to the affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vits
exhibited, and ſworn before Sir Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah
Impey; and though he ſaid he might
fairly throw them aſide, and put them out
of the queſtion, on account of the indirect
manner in which they were obtained, and
the ſtrange and irrelevant teſtimony
they afforded, yet he would wave all
objection to them on thoſe grounds, and
examine them with as much ſeriouſneſs,
as if they were correctly formal, and
every way unexceptionable; they were
all, he ſaid, conceived in one ſpirit, and
formed upon one plan. He then read
the Affidavit of Mr. Middleton, and
clearly pointed out how futile and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
were the grounds upon
which he had, <hi>to the ſatisfaction of his
conſcience,</hi> proceeded to the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity
of violence againſt the Begums.
<q>The God of Juſtice, exclaimed he,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1125601100:54"/>
forbid that any man in this Houſe
ſhould make up his mind to accuſe
Mr. Haſtings on the ground that
Mr. Middleton condemned the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gums.</q>
He next animadverted on
the depoſitions of Colonel Hannay, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel
Gordon, Major M`Donald, Major
Williams, and others, from which he
ſtruck out a variety of ſuch brilliant
detections as baffle memory to follow.</p>
            <p>Amongſt a variety of glaring circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
he pointed out the following:</p>
            <p>Major Williams, amidſt other ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
ſtated one that "<hi>he had heard:</hi>"
That 50 Britiſh troops, watching 200
priſoners, had been ſurrounded by
6000 of the enemy, and muſt inevitably
have fallen a ſacrifice, if they had not
been relieved by the approach of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
of <hi>nine</hi> men. With this
aſſiſtance they had entirely driven away
the enemy, and ſlain ſeveral hundreds
of them. Conſidering the character
given by Mr. H. to the Britiſh army in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1125601100:55"/>
Oude, that they manifeſted a rage for
rapacity and peculation; it was extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
that there were no inſtances of
ſtouter ſwearing. Of Mr. M. he ſaid,
that he liked not the memory which
remembered things better at the end of
five years, than at the time, unleſs there
might be ſomething ſo relaxing in the
climate of India, affecting the memory
as well as the nerves, by which the
traces of actions were loſt; and that
men muſt return to their native air of
England and be braced up, and have
their memories like their ſinews, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrung.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan pointed out many other
improbabilities, and having in very
ſtrong colours painted the looſe quality
of the affidavits, and clearly and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trovertibly
ſhewn the partiality and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice,
which was contained in them
againſt the Begums, he ſolemnly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed
to that ſide of the Houſe which
was more peculiarly intereſted in law-proceedings.
They ſaw that, that Houſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1125601100:56"/>
was the path to fortune in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion;
that they might ſoon, and ſome
of them were, to be called to a dignified
ſituation, where the great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
truſt would be repoſed in them, of
protecting the lives and properties of
their fellow-ſubjects.</p>
            <p>One learned gentleman in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar,
was, if rumour ſpoke right, ſoon
to be called to ſucceed that bright lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary
of the law, whoſe ſun he feared
was ſetting, but whoſe departure from
the ſeat of active juſtice was ſplendid
and magnificent, in its being done while
he poſſeſſed a mind on which time had
not power to lay his hand: Of the
learned Gentleman, the ſucceſſor, he
muſt ſay, that there was not one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
of his life, except perhaps his
activity on an election conteſt, that did
not diſtinguiſh him as a moſt proper
perſon to fill the important ſeat. He
deſired to aſk that learned Gentleman,
and every other of the profeſſion, would
he lay his hand upon his breaſt, and
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1125601100:57"/>
ſolemnly declare, if upon ſuch evidence
as the maſs of depoſitions taken at
Lucknow, any one of them could ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſay that, ſitting as a Judge, he
would be legally warranted to convict
any, the meaneſt individual of an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,
however trivial. If any one would
ſay he could, he declared to God he
would ſit down, and not add a ſyllable
more to the too long treſpaſs he had
made on the patience of the committee.</p>
            <p>Here Mr. Sheridan craved the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of the Houſe (<hi>a general and loud
cry of hear! hear!</hi>) whilſt he for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
enquired into the <hi>ſpirit</hi> and <hi>temper</hi>
of the affidavits, on which the ruin of the
unfortunate Begums was founded. <hi>Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
Gordon</hi> had exhibited a flagrantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous
proof of the <hi>grateful ſpirit and
temper</hi> of affidavits, deſigned to plunge
theſe wretched women in irretrievable
ruin. Colonel Gordon was but juſt before
<hi>not merely releaſed from danger,</hi> but <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
from imminent death.</hi> That gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
was in the hands of the inſurgents,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1125601100:58"/>
and his releaſe was entirely effected by
the negociation of the Bhow Begum. Yet
even at the expiration of two little days
from his deliverance, he depoſes againſt
the diſtreſſed and unfortunate woman, who
had become his <hi>ſaviour;</hi> and <hi>only</hi> upon
<hi>hearſay evidence,</hi> accuſes her of crimes
and rebellion. Upon this occaſion ſhe
manifeſted the ſtrongeſt attachment to
the Engliſh intereſt; for, in her pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
letters and diſpatches to Colonel
Hannay, ſhe particularly deſired that the
Zemindars might not be informed of her
interpoſition in favor of the Colonel:
this was at once a bold and convincing
proof of her unalterable attachment.
Was this a proof of rebellion? <q>
                  <hi>Great
God of juſtice,</hi> (exclaimed the orator)
<hi>canſt thou from thy eternal throne look
down upon ſuch premeditated turpitude of
heart, and not fix ſome dreadful mark
of obloquy upon the perpetrators?</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If, continues Mr. Sheridan, theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidavits,
becauſe they are a mere collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of hearſays, without a tittle of any
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1125601100:59"/>
thing like legal evidence in their compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
could not (as I am certain is the
caſe) be received in a court of law, nor
be brought forward in a court of equity,
was it a ſpecies of evidence ſufficient to
juſtify a wanton act of oppreſſion, of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and groſs injuſtice, committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
two princeſſes; the one the wife,
the other the mother of the deceaſed
Nabob <hi>Sujah ul Dowlah.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Haſtings aſſerts, that the reſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Jaghires was no injury to the
Begums, for they had their revenue of
them delivered regularly.—But that was
not truth.—They never had an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
—they were referred for payment to a
bankrupt, on the faith of a broken gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantee.
There never was any informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
that could warrant the ſeizure of
the Jaghires. It was not done with the
conſent of the Nabob, though he was
forced by Mr. Middleton to give his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
aſſent thereto; for Mr. Middleton
had written to Mr. Haſtings, that <hi>a fixed
melancholy had ſeized the Nabob, on his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1125601100:60"/>
being forced to plunder his mother.</hi> Mr.
Middleton had written to Mr. Haſtings
for his orders, on the 1ſt of December,
1781, which arrived on the 6th, and on
the 29th of the ſame month the whole
was put in execution; but as they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
knew it was a matter that of courſe
muſt make much noiſe, it was deemed
neceſſary by Mr. Haſtings and his party,
to throw the whole of the odium on the
Nabob, by inſiſting that the propoſition
came from him.—But the very letter in
which it was aſſerted that, the Nabob
had not only given his conſent, but even
propoſed this deteſtable meaſure, could
not be produced; nor any one paper, arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle
or authentic evidence to that effect,
notwithſtanding the induſtry with which
it had been reported.</p>
            <p>The Nabob in his letter to Mr. Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
never gave the leaſt hint, that either
his mother or grandmother were in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion,
or that they had ſhewn an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to aſſiſt or join with <hi>Cheyt Sing,</hi>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1125601100:61"/>
or that they meant to extirpate the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh,
or dethrone him.</p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan proceeded to demonſtrate,
that the princeſſes were in every ſenſe of
the word, entitled to their Jaghires and
poſſeſſions, as much as any lady in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land
to her dower, on the death of her
Lord. That this opinion had not ſo much
as been called in queſtion, till the time
that Mr. Haſtings began to ſet his heart
upon their treaſures;—and that aſſerting
the contrary, under the Mahomedan law,
was neither founded in juſtice, reaſon, nor
even that law, and this, Mr. Sheridan
proved beyond the power of contradiction.</p>
            <p>He then ſhewed, from a variety of
ſtatements from Mr. Haſtings's own pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers,
that the Nabob never entertained an
idea that the poſſeſſions of his mother
were his, during her life—on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
that his father <hi>Sujah ul Dowlah,</hi> had
left her in the tranquil poſſeſſion of thoſe
eſtates and treaſures, for the mere purpoſe
of ſupporting her dignity in the ſtile be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1125601100:62"/>
her rank and birth.—Mr. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridan
obſerved, that when <hi>Aſoph ul Dowla</hi>
blamed his father for leaving ſo little
wealth, he thought like an unwiſe prince—
His father Sujah ul Dowla acted prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in leaving him with no temptation
about him, to invite acts of violence from
the rapacious. <q>He cloathed him with
poverty as a ſhield, and armed him
with neceſſity as a ſword.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In conſequence of his poverty and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes,
the <hi>Bhow Begum</hi> his mother it
was true, made her ſon many preſents,
and even lent him money, for which he
had given an equivalent; and once, on
his repreſenting his diſtreſſed ſituation,
ſhe had returned all his pledges and a
very large ſum of money, ſuch as ſhe
thought would finally put an end to his
diſtreſſes. The Nabob her ſon had
given a receipt to that effect, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt
was read by Mr. Sheridan, who
ſtrongly pointed out the obligation he was
under to her. He then enlarged upon the
character and eſtimation in which the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1125601100:63"/>
Princeſſes were held, and in the moſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic
language, dwelt on the purity of
their conduct, the reciprocal return of
filial and parental affection.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Middleton went to ſeize Fy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zyabad,
the eunuchs were taken priſoners,
as was the Fouzder of Tanda; him how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
it was not thought neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
he had not the key of the treaſure;
the eunuchs had that, and they of couſe
were the principal objects.—It was aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that the Nabob gave puerile excuſes for
not plundering his mother.—Reaſons for
not performing the worſt of actions, the
moſt unnatural crime, that of a child ruin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his parent, was by a Chriſtian Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor
thought puerile.—Was it to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that, two old, infirm women, whoſe
whole dependence was on the Britiſh poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion,
one of whom had been a witneſs
of the ſucceſs of the Britiſh arms, for the
Britiſh arms had depoſed her huſband,
Sujah ul Dowlah, and Britiſh generoſity
had again placed him in his dominions,
ſhould wiſh to extirpate the Engliſh?—
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1125601100:64"/>
Saib Ally's behaviour was paſſed over,
as having done more good, by preſerving
a few priſoners, than he had done harm;
Why was not the ſame favour ſhewn to
the Begums? When the foot of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſor
was taken off, the trodden on roſe
againſt the perſecutor, as againſt another
Sujah. What a miſerable ſituation muſt
the poor unfortunate wretches be in,
to have thoſe for their judges, who would
benefit by their deſtruction!</p>
            <p>When the Court of Directors ſent to
Mr. Haſtings, to reviſe the charge againſt
the Begums, and Mr. Stables moved that
reviſion in council, he was over-ruled by
Mr. Haſtings, who ſaid, that <q>
                  <hi>the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
of juſtice ought to be approached
with ſolicitation, and that it would debaſe
itſelf by the ſuggeſtion of wrongs, and the
promiſe of redreſs.</hi>
               </q>—Conſcious however
of the enormity of his conduct, he apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gizes
to the Court of Directors, by ſtating,
that it would be "<hi>a very ſevere taſk for a
mother to impeach her ſon;</hi>"—ſo that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to his idea, it was no crime for a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1125601100:65"/>
ſon to rob and plunder his parents, but it
was a crime of a very deep dye, for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured
parent to complain of the outrage
of her child.</p>
            <p>He next proceeded to ſhew, that Mr.
Haſtings, and <hi>he alone,</hi> was the actor
and perpetrator of thoſe crimes. That
he was regularly acquainted with all the
enormities committed, there was the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
proof. It was true that Middleton
was rebuked for not being more exact.
He did not, perhaps, deſcend to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tail;
he did not give him an account of
the number of groans, which were heaved,
of the quantity of tears which were ſhed,
of the weight of the fetters, or of the
depth of the dungeons; but he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
every ſtep that he took to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh
the baſe and unwarrantable end. He
proved by his letters, dated in Jan. 1782,
that he alone was reſponſible for the whole
proceedings. Mr. Haſtings well knew that,
the ja ghire and the treaſure were the only
means which the Begums were in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of, to ſupport the numerous family
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1125601100:66"/>
of the late Nabob, amounting to more
than two thouſand perſons.</p>
            <p>After having in the moſt pathetic and
forcible manner given an affecting deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription
of the diſtreſſes of theſe unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate
princeſſes, he went farther into the
expoſure of the evidence; into a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon
of dates and the ſubſequent cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
in order to prove that, all the
enormous conſequences that followed from
the reſumption, in the captivity of the
women and the impriſonment and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
practiſed upon their people, were ſolely
to be aſcribed and imputed to <hi>Mr. Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</hi>
He ſaid that Mr. Haſtings had
once remarked, <q>that a mind touched
with ſuperſtition might have contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plated
the fate of the Rohillas with
peculiar impreſſions.</q> But if indeed the
mind of Mr. Haſtings had been touched
with ſuperſtition; if <hi>his</hi> fancy could ſuffer
any diſturbance, and even in viſion, he could
imagine that he beheld the great ſpirit
of <hi>Sujah Dowlah</hi> looking down on the
ruin he had wrought on his houſe—in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1125601100:67"/>
that palace which Mr. Haſtings had firſt
wreſted from his hand, and afterwards
reſtored to him;—plundered by that
very army, by which Sujah Dowlah had
been able to vanquiſh the Mahrattas—
ſeizing on the very plunder which he had
ravaged from the Rohillas;—<hi>that</hi> MID<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DLETON
who had been engaged in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naging
the previous violations, moſt buſy
to perpetrate the laſt; <hi>that very</hi> HAST<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>INGS,
whom on his death-bed he
had left the guardian of his wife and
mother, and family; turning all thoſe
dear relatives, the objects of his ſolemn
truſt, forth to the mercileſs ſeaſon, and
to a more mercileſs ſoldiery!—A mind
touched with ſuperſtition, muſt indeed
have cheriſhed ſuch a contemplation with
very peculiar impreſſions.</p>
            <p>Mr. Haſtings had endeavoured to throw
a portion of the guilt upon the Council,
although Mr. Wheeler had never taken
any ſhare, and Mr. M`Pherſon was not
arrived in India when the ſcene began.
<hi>Mr. Sheridan</hi> remarked, that he had
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1125601100:68"/>
ſhrunk from the inquiry ordered by the
Court of Directors under the new, and
pompous doctrine, that the majeſty of
juſtice was to be approached with ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
and was not to degrade itſelf, by
hunting for crimes. If his picture of
juſtice was right, then the Committees
of this Houſe, in the examination of
Smith, were wrong—Mr. Dundas was
wrong.—He hoped however, that Mr.
Haſtings would be found wrong.</p>
            <p>
               <q>I truſt, ſaid the eloquent Speaker,
that this Houſe will vindicate the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
character of juſtice,—that they
will demonſtrate its true quality, eſſence,
and purpoſes,—that they will evidence
it to be, in the caſe of Mr. Haſtings,
<hi>active, inquiſitive,</hi> and <hi>avenging.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Sheridan</hi> having in the courſe of
his wonderful Speech taken a moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive
view of the buſineſs, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
with the moſt elaborate re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearch
and ſcrutinizing attention, every
circumſtance with which it was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected;
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1125601100:69"/>
having urged every thing which
he thought neceſſary to develope the
iniquitous conduct of Mr. Haſtings, to
ſubſtantiate the charge, and to eſtabliſh
it by the incontrovertible evidence of
an infinity of facts; he drew towards a
concluſion, by ſtating a ſummary of the
great points contained in it. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
and maintained that it was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
the Begums had done nothing to
merit ſuch violence, that the pretence
of their having been the fomenters of
rebellion, with a view to exterminate
the Engliſh from the province of Oude,
was a mere pretence, wholly unfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and not ſupported by any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
and that ſuch an idea had never
been conceived, until Mr. Haſtings con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
that to be the probable means, and
a favourite reſource for the obtainment of
money,—a reſource that he was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
in defiance of reaſon, juſtice,
and humanity, and at all events, to
make certain of. Mr. Haſtings had violat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the the ſolemn guarantee of the Company,
and had broken their faith, pledged by
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1125601100:70"/>
treaty; he had throughout his conduct
been guided by baſeneſs, falſehood, and
oppreſſion; entering into treaties, and
framing ſtipulations, which at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
he was concluding and agreeing
upon, he had no purpoſe of fulfilling.
—Mr. Haſtings had degraded and ſunk
the dignity and character of the higheſt
and moſt honourable office, that of a
<hi>Chief Juſtice,</hi> by making <hi>Sir Elijah
Impey</hi> run about the country collecting
affidavits.—He had, by paltry quib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles,
and pitiful evaſions, neglected to
proceed upon the enquiry directed by
the Board at the India-Houſe; taking a
mean advantage of the Directors orders,
and had cloathed that evaſion with a
pompous parade of words, and a ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous
diſplay of nonſenſical phraſes on
the majeſty of Juſtice.—That through
the whole of the tranſaction the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of the Governor-General had been
marked with the moſt ſcandalous du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity,
the baſeſt perfidy, the moſt
unparalleled and grinding oppreſſion,
and the moſt inſolent, wanton, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manly
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1125601100:71"/>
cruelty.—He had made a ſon
plunder his mother and grand-mother,
and reduced to diſtreſs two princeſſes
of high rank;—he had ſullied and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced
the Britiſh name and character.</p>
            <p>Mr. Haſtings, he obſerved, was a
man of wonderful preſcience, for it was
evident that he knew nothing of what
would lend his conduct a colour of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
till after it was over; but he
<hi>foreſaw</hi> that there would be proof of a
rebellion, and,—ſtrange to tell!—it turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
out exactly as he predicted.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Sheridan</hi> then made a ſolemn
appeal to the Houſe, conveyed in ſuch
a ſublime and aſtoniſhing ſtile of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance,
and worked up with ſuch pathos
and dignity, in ſuch faſcinating lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
that the Houſe was wrapped in
mute attention: To keep way with him
through ſuch a rapid ſtream of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
deſies all power of retention:
it was wholly impracticable to do more
than watch the current as it flowed,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1125601100:72"/>
and now and then caſually to graſp
ſome paſſing flowers, within our reach.</p>
            <p>He ſtated to the Houſe, that the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
of charge was no queſtion of party.
Factions and parties, he knew, exiſted
in that houſe. The prerogative of the
Crown found its advocates among the
people's repreſentatives. The privileges of
the people met with their opponents.
Habits, connections, parties, all led to a
diverſity of opinions. The meaſures of
every miniſter were ſupported by one body
of men, and thwarted by another; but on
great queſtions, they had, he was happy to
remark, often diſtinguiſhed themſelves, by
laying aſide all petty party conſiderations,
and acting with a firmneſs and deciſion
that reflected honour upon their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
—When Inhumanity preſented
itſelf, when the majeſty of Juſtice was
to be ſupported, he truſted no diviſion
could be found among them. When
the former became the object of their
attention, they would ſit upon it as their
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1125601100:73"/>
common enemy, as if the character of
the land were involved in their zeal for
its ruin, and they would leave it not,
till it was completely overthrown.—He
hoped they would now ſtep forward, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardleſs
of the miniſter,—regardleſs of
the influence of the Crown,—and vote
againſt the moſt enormous crimes that
ever diſgraced human nature.—On the
preſent occaſion, they were called upon
to retrieve millions of their fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
from a ſtate of miſery and oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
It was true, they could not ſee the
innumerable beings, whoſe wretchedneſs
they would relieve; the multitudes of
famiſhed females had not reached the
Houſe, and terrified it into a contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of their miſeries; but for that reaſon,
the more magnanimous would their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
be, the more glorious their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
to puniſh ſuch delinquency. Was
a Britiſh Parliament to wait for their bar
to be ſurrounded with the ſcreams of
expiring children, and the ſhrieks of ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
women, before they ſtooped to redreſs
their grievances?—No—Let the world
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1125601100:74"/>
behold an example, that the Commons
of Great-Britain will ſtretch the ſtrong
arm of juſtice acroſs the habitable globe,
to ſhew in glowing colours the greatneſs
and power of a Britiſh Parliament, in
reprobating injuſtice, in ſtigmatizing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity,
and in delivering over to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dign
puniſhment, thoſe who uſed unlimit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
power, merely for the purpoſes of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny,
oppreſſion, rapacity, and perfidy.
It was not given to that Houſe, as it was to
the officers who had the felicity to relieve,
and the ſtill greater tranſport of a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
mind, to perceive the extatic
emotions of gratitude in the inſtant of
deliverance. They could not behold the
workings of the heart, the quivering lips,
the trickling tears, the loud, though tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulous
joys of the millions, whom their
vote that night would ſnatch from the
tyranny of <hi>corrupt power.</hi> But, though
theſe circumſtances were not perceptible
to them, was not the true enjoyment of
benevolence encreaſed, by the bleſſing
being conferred unſeen: Would not the
<hi>omnipotence of Britiſh juſtice, and a Britiſh
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1125601100:75"/>
Parliament</hi> be demonſtrated, to the wonder
of nations, by ſtretching its mighty arm
acroſs the Globe, and ſaving by its <hi>fiat</hi>
millions from deſtruction! And would
the bleſſings of the people, thus ſaved,
diffuſe in empty air! No!—<q>Heaven,
ſays he, if I may dare to uſe the figure,
—Heaven itſelf ſhall become the Agent
to receive the bleſſings of their pious
gratitude, and to waft them to your
boſoms.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Sheridan returned his warmeſt
thanks to the Houſe for the indulgence
he had experienced in a ſpeech that car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
him beyond the limits of his ſtrength;
but he truſted, that ſtrength would ſoon
be repaired, from the conſideration of
having endeavoured to diſcharge his duty
in the ſupport of untainted innocence.</p>
            <p>He then concluded,</p>
            <p>
               <q>It is with confidence I now move
Sir, that Warren Haſtings be impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1125601100:76"/>
The queſtion was then read by the
clerk to the following purpoſe:</p>
            <p>
               <q>That the Committee, upon hearing
evidence, and conſidering the ſaid charge,
are of opinion, that there is ſufficient
ground to impeach Warren Haſtings,
<abbr>Eſq</abbr> of High Crimes and Miſdemean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours,
upon the matter of the ſaid
charge,</q>

            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Burgeſs</hi> ſpoke for nearly an hour
in defence of Mr. Haſtings, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
he grounded on the 10th report,
when</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sir William Dolben</hi> roſe, and obſerved,
that Mr. Sheridan having in his ſpeech
ſtated in ſo able a manner, ſuch a variety
of facts and arguments, as muſt have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
the ſpirits, as well as the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Committee, he therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
an adjournment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Stanhope</hi> was of the ſame opinion,
and was determined not to give his vote,
till he had again collected his reaſon, and
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1125601100:77"/>
had given the ſubject a new and ſerious
conſideration.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Fox</hi> argued againſt the adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Major Scott</hi> roſe, and accuſed Mr. She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridan
of having been guilty of <hi>moſt groſs
miſrepreſentations;</hi> that in referring to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
parts of the correſpondence relative
to the Begums, <hi>he had omitted ſeveral parts
of the letters,</hi> and offered to proceed to the
proof, when</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Chancellor of the Exchequer,</hi> in a
very candid and liberal manner, paſſed
many deſerving and high encomiums on
Mr. Sheridan's ſpeech, and was ſtrenuous
for the adjournment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Fox</hi> replied to Mr. Pitt, and in a
ſpeech of ſome length, ſtill oppoſed any
adjournment:—this brought up</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Wilberforce,</hi> who, for ſimilar rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
with Mr. Pitt, Sir William Dolben,
and Mr. Stanhope, was anxious to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journ.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:1125601100:78"/>
               <hi>Mr. Fox</hi> roſe to explain, and amongſt
other things ſaid, that an adjournment
would certainly impreſs the public mind
with a very unfavourable opinion of Mr.
Haſtings's cauſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Sheridan</hi> ſaid, that he ſhould not
again have troubled the Committee, had
it not been to clear up a foul, and he muſt
ſay, an unjuſt aſperſion caſt againſt him,
of <hi>miſrepreſenting,</hi> or of not reading the
evidence faithfully; he proteſted that he
had not, to the beſt of his knowledge,
omitted a ſingle ſentence that was mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial;
and that his wiſh was, to ſtate the
whole faithfully; as to the adjournment,
the Committee would ſee his reaſon for
not ſaying any thing on the ſubject.
<hi>Mr. Martin, Mr. Montague,</hi> and <hi>Mr. St.
John,</hi> ſeverally ſpoke, when</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Sheridan</hi> roſe a third time, and
ſaid, that if Gentlemen really meant to
preſs it to a deciſion, he did not wiſh to
take the ſenſe of the Houſe on the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of adjournment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:1125601100:79"/>
               <hi>Sir William Dolben</hi>'s motion was then
read, and paſſed without a diviſion; and
the Speaker having reſumed the chair, the
Houſe adjourned at half paſt <hi>One.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>THURSDAY the 8th.</q>
            <p>The Houſe having met, and reſolved
itſelf into a Committee, the ſubject was
reſumed. <hi>Mr. Pitt</hi> bore a conſpicuous
part in the debate. At the concluſion
of his ſpeech,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Mr. Sheridan</hi> roſe, and ſaid, that after
the extraordinary indulgence which he
had the honour to experience laſt night,
he would now treſpaſs but a few minutes
on their time. He felt himſelf, however,
called upon to congratulate the Right Hon.
Gentleman, <hi>(Mr. Pitt,)</hi> on the very able,
candid, and manly, manner in which he
had delivered his ſentiments on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
He congratulated the Houſe, he
congratulated his country, that in the
cauſe of humanity, they ſaw a Miniſter
who was not to be biaſſed by any motives
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1125601100:80"/>
of political intereſt, who by his conduct
on that day, had placed his character
above the reach of ſuſpicion. He was
not ſo vain as to imagine, that any argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
he had advanced on the ſubject
had made any impreſſion on the Right
Honourable Gentleman's mind; if they
had, it was more a tribute to the cauſe of
truth and juſtice than a compliment to
him.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to what the Hon. Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
(Major Scott) had mentioned, of
his being alluded to as one of the <hi>depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi>
of Mr. Haſtings, Mr. Sheridan de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
upon his honour, that, if he made
uſe of ſuch an expreſſion, he had not the
ſmalleſt intention of conveying any inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuation
that tended to reflect on the Hon.
Gentleman. He had every allowance to
make for opinions that were formed on
the prejudices of human nature. He was
not ſurpriſed that the Hon. Gentleman
viewed the conduct of Mr. Haſtings in a
light different from other men, for when
the <hi>heart</hi> acknowledged an obligation, it
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1125601100:81"/>
would never ſuffer the <hi>judgment</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
by it. If he had uttered harſh
expreſſions, he declared they were not the
reſult of malignity, or the offspring of
vindictive malice;—he thanked God, he
had a heart incapable of cheriſhing either,
and, if he had ſpoken warmly, it was on
a queſtion which, he confeſſed had deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
agitated his mind and excited his feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
That queſtion would ſoon come
before another tribunal, and which would
decide between the Houſe of Commons
and Mr. Haſtings.</p>
            <p>Several other Gentlemen having ſpoken,
the queſtion was at laſt put, and the
houſe divided, when the numbers were,
