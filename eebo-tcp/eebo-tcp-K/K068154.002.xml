            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I CANNOT reſiſt the inclination this opportunity gives me of noticing how ſincerely I rejoice that the tongue of malignity, which has ſo opened againſt me on the ſubject of theſe ſongs, is likely to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ſilenced.</p>
            <p>Let it however be underſtood that, for any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate uneaſineſs the ſaucy ſlander ever gave me, for any fear I entertained leſt it ſhould depreciate me in the opinion of the judicious and the worthy, for any perſonal enmity I feel towards the miſerable fools, who are puniſhed enough by the gnawings of their own rancour:—for any of theſe, or ſimilar conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I ſhould have ſuffered the noiſome ſnuff to linger, till it became choaked in its own fetid dregs: but it has annoyed the public, and therefore it is my duty to put on the extinguiſher.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0259200902:6"/>
The hiſtory of this buſineſs is very ſimple and ſelf-evident. I ſtarted in life with ſome popularity, and therefore became an object of envy. Thoſe who were galled at my ſucceſs, endeavoured to cruſh me. They knew they could not do ſo honeſtly, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they attempted it by villany. Public indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however, ſo aſtoniſhed the reptiles, that they were glad to ſlink into their filthy lurking places for ſafety.</p>
            <p>From that time onward, till within theſe three years—being connected with managers and muſic-ſhops, and working for mere hire—I lived pretty free from calumny. Throwing off every kind of yoke, however, and ſtanding upon my own foundation—at which time I pledged myſelf that my productions ſhould not, even in the minuteſt degree, receive aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from either manager, author, or compoſer—the vipers began again to rear their heads; and many—to the reproach of manhood, and the diſhonour of human nature—are the wanton and wicked proofs that they are only ſcotehed, not killed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0259200902:7"/>
This will be clearly evident if we notice that the medium through which they have attempted to emit their poiſon is a revival of the ſame ſlander which was originally levelled againſt my reputation, and which only ſhews that they have more wickedneſs than cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. They fancy that, could they induce a general belief that I impoſed upon the world the productions of ſome other perſon, as my own, I ſhould be held as a man void of faith or honour; but what proper indignation muſt fill every heart if it could be brought home to conviction that the principles of this perſon, of whom I am ſuppoſed to be merely the agent, are deteſted, and his memory execrated!</p>
            <p>Could this be maintained, it would cut two ways. It would hold me up, both profeſſionally and morally, as an impoſtor, and ſtimulate the public not only to damn my works, but my character. Poor, ſhallow-ſighted idiots! They indeed know nothing of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of public generoſity. They have never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced that it conſtantly follows laudable induſtry; that it ever encourages thoſe endeavours which aim at conveying reaſonable pleaſure and uſeful inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0259200902:8"/>
and that whom it protects, it raiſes far above the reach of malice or detraction. They only know, fallen as they are, that it is a bliſs they dare not hope to enjoy, becauſe they are unworthy to poſſeſs it.</p>
            <p>Having ſpoken of managers and muſic-ſhops, it may not be improper to notice, that in ſeparating myſelf from public connections, I am not actuated by any thing captious or capricious. I have no wiſh to cavil at men who have made bargains with me to their advantage. I cannot blame them for taking care of their intereſt, nor do I believe they blame me for taking care of mine: but, on the contrary—particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly thoſe with whom I have been moſt connected—wiſh well to my purſuits, and would lend my exertions every advantage in their power. Nor is there any thing wonderful in this; for it is a poor compliment to human integrity to ſuppoſe that it is not very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural in us to aſſiſt thoſe from whom we have received aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>Putting out of the queſtion the raſcality of my ſlanderers, I ſhall next examine whether there is any<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0259200902:9"/>
like probability in their ſlander; premiſing, that I ſhould not have condeſcended ſo far but for the only circumſtance in all this buſineſs that gives me any thing like pain; and it is, that many men of ſtrict honour, and cordial good wiſhes towards me, have, even in my preſence, apparently given into ſomething like a belief of what has been urged againſt me.</p>
            <p>Such a leaven is there in the compoſition of man, and ſo captivating is a novel opinion, that I am afraid, ſhould there be any malignity in it, there are very few who may not, under particular circumſtances, ſuffer a momentary ſuſpenſion of their integrity, to indulge an abſurd curioſity. I declare I have had ſuch queſtions aſked me, by even kind and worthy friends, that had I not known an anxious ſolicitude had for an inſtant obſcured probability, and outran re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, I muſt, for the ſake of my honour, have ſpit in their faces.</p>
            <p>Nor is this language too ſtrong. In what way can the beſt friend make me amends for having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgel, even for a ſingle moment, a belief that I am
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0259200902:10"/>
the wretch theſe execrable villains would fain deſcribe me? But my only revenge on thoſe who have been thus betrayed from their duty as men, and tricked out of their charity as chriſtians, ſhall be to ſhew upon how unſubſtantial a foundation they have grounded their belief.</p>
            <p>To go into this examination then. What is there in all we know of Mr. BICKERSTAFF to give the fainteſt colour to probability that he has written my ſongs, and that I always have been, and now am, his intimate friend? Is it becauſe whatever he has written and whatever I have written are of a totally different complexion? Does he write my ſea ſongs, becauſe thoſe in his <hi>Thomas and Sally</hi> are, taken technically, the abſurdeſt nonſenſe that ever diſgraced paper? Does the ſpirit of my poetry bear the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic of his, becauſe his was ſtudy and mine is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuition? Becauſe he was timid, and I am bold? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe what I write is temporary, and for the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when he was the tardieſt and moſt tedious of all writers? Did he, or could he, write any thing but ſongs? Do I write any thing but ballads? Have
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0259200902:11"/>
I not uniformly rejected all aſſiſtance?—nay the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of much better poets than he—and did he not court aſſiſtance from any body who would lend it him? Were not the ſuggeſtions of GOLDSMITH, KELLY, GARRICK, nay even SHUTER, and many others, caught at by him with avidity?</p>
            <p>But did not theſe plain and ſelf-evident facts laugh the aſſertion to ſcorn, is it likely that a man, as he was, of the moſt offenſive and inſufferable vanity, who never allowed the ſmalleſt ſpark of merit to his friends—no, not even in the moment they were lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantage to his productions—is it probable that ſuch a man, notwithſtanding the merited obloquy a diſcerning and virtuous public has properly heaped on his head, would not manifeſt in ſome way his title to a ſhare in my popularity? Or, to take it the other way, what ſtrange inconſiſtency, or what ſingular atrocity, has ſo marked my public career as to make me appear on one ſide ſuch a fool, and on the other ſuch a knave, as to riſk being firſt diſcovered, and afterwards betrayed, by the man of all others the moſt capable of ſuch conduct?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0259200902:12"/>
Again, what are the faſcinating qualities in Mr. BICKERSTAFF that ſhould induce me to imitate him as a man, and riſk public benevolence for private in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy? Am I impelled by gratitude in return for his driving hard bargains with me; of his taking ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of my inexperience, and rewarding me with a trifle, for labours by which he got large ſums of money; for being continually unfaithful to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, or for running away in my debt? Am I enamoured of that inſincerity for which he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable and notorious?—for that profligacy and immorality which characteriſed his opinions?—for that ſupercilious hauteur through which he would affront his friends?—or the puſillanimity which terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied him into begging their pardon! The climax of this paragraph I will not ſtain my paper with. My heart does not tell me that any ſingle diſpaſſionate man upon earth will accuſe me of an inclination to emulate the above qualities, and I flatter myſelf I ſhall not eaſily be ſuſpected of pre-eminence in iniquity. And now let my calumniaters, with their uſual truth and conſiſtency, aſſert that this is a panegyric on Mr. BICKERSTAFF, and that he wrote it!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0259200902:13"/>
But this dare not now be ventured. The public indignation is once more rouſed, and woe to thoſe who have provoked it! My cauſe is become the cauſe of every honeſt man in the kingdom. Every man's honour, every man's character, and every man's intereſt is involved in it. It is not now a queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion whether, in common with hundreds of high diſtinction, brilliant talents, and unſpotted honour, I ſhall, with indifference and contempt, ſee the lie of the day levelled at me, but it is a queſtion whether, as an innocent man, I ſhall be protected by ſociety, or, as a perjurer, driven from it.</p>
            <p>This ſlander became at length ſo rank, ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and was ſo univerſally diffuſed, that, in juſtice to myſelf as a man and a citizen, I have appealed to the laws of my country. Diſdaining to proceed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than by indictment, I have been granted a rule to ſhew cauſe why an information ſhould not be filed againſt the perſon who has thought proper to libel me; and, to obtain that rule, I have ſworn <q rend="inline">"that I have not, at any time, ſeen Mr. BICKERSTAFF, nor had any
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0259200902:14"/>
correſpondence with him, ſince he abſconded, and that I know not whether he be alive or dead."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The matter is therefore now brought to a moſt ſerious and ſolemn point. My reputation is in the hands of the public, and every man of virtue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour muſt pronounce for me, that no one, but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled villain, will hereafter dare to mention my name coupled with any inſinuation of the nature I complain of, unleſs he ſhall not only accuſe me, but convict me, of perjury.</p>
            <p>I have written this preface at the ſolicitation and for the ſatisfaction of thoſe many friends whoſe warm and kind anxiety ſhall be remembered by me while my heart feels that gratitude which is its ſweeteſt and deareſt ſenſation. In the courſe of it I have carefully ſtudied not to anticipate nor prejudge any thing before the court. I have only given an unqualified contradiction of what has been alledged againſt me, and maintained my poſition by ſuch probable circumſtances as ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted themſelves. This it was particularly my duty
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0259200902:15"/>
to do, on bringing out theſe ſongs; but I have not preſumed to teach, or dictate. The ſubject is open to liberal diſcuſſion. It is here at iſſue, as well as at the King's-bench; and I am neither aſhamed nor afraid of what may be the deciſion in either place.</p>
