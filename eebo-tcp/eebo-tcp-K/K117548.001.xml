            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I have aſſumed the character of CENSOR GENERAL, I
ſhall follow the example of the old Roman Cenſor; the firſt part of
whoſe duty was to review the people, and diſtribute them into their
ſeveral Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: I ſhall therefore enter upon my office, by taking a
curſory ſurvey of what is uſually called <hi>The</hi> TOWN. In this I
ſhall not confine myſelf to the exact method of a Geographer, but carry the
reader from one quarter to another, as it may ſuit my convenience, or beſt
contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to his entertainment.</p>
               <p>WHEN a Comedian, celebrated for his excellence in the part of
Shylock, firſt undertook that character, he made daily viſits to the center
of buſineſs, the 'Change, and the adjacent Coffee-houſes; that by a
frequent intercourſe and converſation with 
<q rend="inline">"the unforeſkinn'd race,"</q> he might
ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bituate himſelf to their air and deportment. A like deſire 
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1252700301:3"/> of penetrating into the moſt ſecret ſprings of action
in theſe people, has often led Me there; but I was never more diverted than
at <hi>Garraway</hi>'s a few days before the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the lottery. I not
only could read Hope, Fear, and all the various paſſions excited by a love
of gain, ſtrongly pictured in the faces of thoſe who came to buy; but I
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked with no leſs delight, the many little artifices made uſe of to
allure adventurers, as well as the viſible altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the looks of the
ſellers, according as the demand for tickets gave occaſion to raiſe or
lower their price. So deeply were the countenances of theſe Bubble-Brokers
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with an attention to the main chance, and their minds ſeemed
ſo dead to all other ſenſations, that one might almoſt doubt, where
money is out of the caſe, whether a Jew 
<q rend="inline">"has eyes, hands, organs, dimenſions,
ſenſes, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, paſſions."</q>
               </p>
               <p>FROM <hi>Garraway</hi>'s it is but a ſhort ſtep to a gloomy
claſs of mortals, not leſs intent on gain than the Stock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jobber: I mean the
diſpenſers of life and death, who flock together, like birds of prey
watching for carcaſes, at <hi>Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s. I never enter this place, but
it ſerves as a <hi>memento mori</hi> to me. What a formal aſſemblage of
ſable ſuits, and tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous perukes! I have often met here a moſt
intimate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, whom I have ſcarce known again; a ſprightly young
fellow, with whom I have ſpent many a jolly hour; but being juſt dubb'd a
Graduate in Phyſick, he has gain'd ſuch an entire conqueſt over the
riſible muſcles, that he hardly vouchſafes at any time to ſmile. I have
heard him harangue, with all the oracular importance of a veteran, on the
poſſibility of CANNING's ſubſiſting for a whole month on a few bits
of bread; and he is now preparing a treatiſe, in which will be ſet forth a
new and infallible method to prevent the ſpreading of the plague from
<hi>France</hi> into <hi>England. Batſon</hi>'s has been reckon'd the ſeat
of ſolemn ſtupidity: yet is it not totally devoid of taſte and common
ſenſe. They have among them Phyſicians who can cope with the moſt
eminent Lawyers or Divines; and Critics, who can reliſh the <hi>ſal
volatile</hi> of a witty compoſition, or <pb n="3" facs="tcp:1252700301:4"/> determine how
much <hi>fire</hi> is requiſite to <hi>ſublimate</hi> a tragedy
<hi>ſecundùm artem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>EMERGING from theſe diſmal regions, I am glad to breath the
pure air in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Coffee-houſe: where (as I profeſs the
higheſt veneration for our Clergy) I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contemplate the magnificence of
the cathedral without reflecting on the abject condition of thoſe 
<q rend="inline">"tatter'd crapes,"</q> who are ſaid to ply
here for an occaſional Burial or Sermon, with the ſame regularity as the
happier drudges, who ſalute us with the cry of 
<q rend="inline">"coach ſir,"</q> or 
<q rend="inline">"chair your honour."</q>
               </p>
               <p>And here my Publiſher would not forgive me, was I to leave the
neighbourhood without taking notice of the <hi>Chapter</hi> Coffee-houſe,
which is frequented by thoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragers of literature, and (as they are
ſtiled by an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Critic) 
<q rend="inline">"not the worſt judges of merit,"</q> the
Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers. The converſation here naturally turns upon the neweſt
publications, but their criticiſms are ſomething ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular. When they
ſay a <hi>good</hi> book, they do not mean to praiſe the ſtyle or
ſentiment, but the quick and extenſive ſale of it. That book in the
phraſe of the CONGER is beſt, which ſells moſt; and if the demand for
QUARLES ſhould be greater than for POPE, he would have the higheſt place on
the rubric poſt. There are alſo many parts of every work liable to their
remarks, which fall not within the notice of leſs accurate obſervers. A few
nights ago I ſaw one of theſe gentlemen take up a Sermon, and after
ſeeming to peruſe it for ſome time with great attention, he declared 
<q rend="inline">"it was very good <hi>Engliſh.</hi>"</q> The
reader will judge whether I was moſt ſurpriſed or diverted, when I
diſcovered, that he was not commending the purity and elegance of the
diction, but the beauty of the <hi>type,</hi> which, it ſeems, is known
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the printers by that appellation. We muſt not however think the
members of the CONGER ſtrangers to the deeper parts of literature; for as
Carpenters, Smiths, Maſons, and all Handicraftſmen ſmell of the trade
they labour at, Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers take a peculiar turn from their connexions with
books and authors. The character of the Bookſeller is commonly 
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1252700301:5"/> formed on the writers in his ſervice. Thus one is a
poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician or a deiſt; another affects humour, or aims at turns of wit and
repartee; while a third perhaps is grave, moral, and ſententious.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Temple</hi> is the barrier that divides the City and
Suburbs, and the gentlemen who reſide there ſeem influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the
ſituation of the place they inhabit. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plers are, in general, a kind of
citizen-courtiers. They aim at the air and mien of the drawing-room, but the
holiday ſmartneſs of a prentice, heightened with ſome additional touches
of the rake or coxcomb, betrays itſelf in every thing they do. The
<hi>Temple</hi> however is ſtock'd with it's peculiar beaus, wits, poets,
critics, and every character in the gay world. And it is a thouſand pities,
that ſo pretty a ſociety ſhould be diſgraced with a few dull fellows,
who can ſubmit to puzzle themſelves with Caſes and Reports, and have not
taſte enough to follow the genteel method of ſtudying the law.</p>
               <p>I SHALL now, like a true Student of the <hi>Temple,</hi> hurry
from thence to <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> the acknowledg'd region of gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
wit, and criticiſm; and hope to be excuſed for not ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at
<hi>George</hi>'s in my way, as the <hi>Bedford</hi> affords a greater variety
of nearly the ſame characters. This Coffee-houſe is every night crowded
with men of parts. Almoſt every one you meet is a polite ſcholar and a wit.
Jokes and <hi>bon mots</hi> are echo'd from box to box; every branch of
literature is critically exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, and the merit of every production of the
preſs, or performance at the theatres, weighed and determined. This ſchool
(to which I am myſelf indebted for a great part of my education, and in
which, though unworthy, I am now ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the honour of being a public
lecturer) has bred up many authors, to the amazing entertainment and
inſtruction of their readers. <hi>Button</hi>'s, the grand archetype of the
<hi>Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford,</hi> was frequented by <hi>Addiſon, Steele, Pope,</hi> and the
reſt of that celebrated ſet, who flouriſhed at the beginning of this
century, and was regarded with juſt deference on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the real
geniuſſes who frequented it. But we can now boaſt men of ſuperior
abilities; men, who without any one <pb n="5" facs="tcp:1252700301:6"/> acquired excellence, by
the mere dint of an happy aſſurance, can exact the ſame tribute of
veneration, and receive it as due to the illuſtrious characters, the
Scribblers, Players, Fidlers, Gamblers, that make ſo large a part of the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany at the <hi>Bedford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW, ſince Mr. MACKLIN is not yet prepared to receive us, I
ſhall take leave of <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> and deſire the Reader's company
to <hi>White</hi>'s. Here (as <hi>Vanbrugh</hi> ſays of <hi>Locket</hi>'s) 
<q rend="inline">"He may have a diſh no bigger than a ſaucer,
that ſhall coſt him fifty ſhillings."</q> The great people, who frequent
this place, do not interrupt their politer amuſements, like the wretches at
<hi>Garraway</hi>'s, with buſineſs, any farther than to go down to
Weſtminſter one Seſſions to vote for a Bill, and the next to repeal it.
Nor do they trouble themſelves with literary debates, as at the
<hi>Bedford.</hi> Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is beneath the notice of a Man of Quality. They
employ themſelves more faſhionably at whiſt for the trifle of a
thouſand pounds the rubber, or by making bets on the lye of the day.</p>
               <p>FROM this very genteel place the Reader muſt not be
ſurpriſed, if I ſhould convey him to a Cellar, or a common
Porter-houſe. For as it is my province to delineate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark on mankind
in general, whoever becomes my diſciple muſt not refuſe to follow me from
the <hi>King's-Arms</hi> to the <hi>Gooſe and Gridiron,</hi> and be content
to climb after me up to an Author's garret, or give me leave to introduce him
to a Route. In my preſent curſory view of the TOWN I have indeed confined
myſelf principally to Coffee-houſes, tho' I conſtantly viſit all places
that afford any matter for ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I am a Scotchman at
<hi>Forreſter</hi>'s, a Frenchman at <hi>Slaughter</hi>'s, and at the
<hi>Cocoa-Tree</hi> I am — an ENGLISHMAN. At the <hi>Robin Hood</hi> I am
a Politician, a Logician, a Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrician, a Phyſician, a Metaphyſician, a
Caſuiſt, a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt, a Theologiſt, a Mythologiſt, or any
thing—but an Atheiſt. Wherever the WORLD is, I am. You will therefore
hear of me ſometimes at the Theatres, ſometimes perhaps at the Opera; nor
ſhall I think the exhibitions of <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1252700301:7"/> 
                  <hi>Sadler's Wells,</hi>
or the Little Theatre in the <hi>Haymarket,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath my notice; but may
one day or other give a diſſertation upon <hi>Tumbling,</hi> or (if they
ſhould again become popular) a critique on <hi>Dogs</hi> and
<hi>Monkeys.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THOUGH the Town is the walk I ſhall general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear in, let
it not be imagined that Vice and Folly will ſhoot up unnoticed in the
Country. My cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin VILLAGE has undertaken that province, and will ſend me
the freſheſt advices of every fault or foible that takes root there. But as
it is my chief ambition to pleaſe and inſtruct the Ladies, I ſhall
embrace every opportunity of devoting my labours to their ſervice: and I may
with juſtice congratulate myſelf upon the happineſs of living in an age,
when the female part of the world are ſo ſtudious to find employment for a
CENSOR.</p>
               <p>THE character of Mr. TOWN is, I flatter myſelf, too well known
to need an explanation. How far, and in what ſenſe, I propoſe to be a
CONNOISSEUR, the learned reader will gather from my general Motto: 
<q> 
                     <l>—Non de villis domibuſve alienis,</l>

                  </q> As CRITIC and CENSOR GENERAL, I ſhall
take the liberty to animadvert on every thing that appears to me vicious or
ridiculous; always endeavouring 
<q rend="inline">"to hold, as 'twere, the mirrour up to Nature,
to ſhew Virtue her own feature, Scorn her own image, and the very age and
body of the Time his form and preſſure."</q>

                        <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>THE hurry in which I left <hi>England</hi> muſt have
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced you how much I was in earneſt, when I talked of making a valuable
collection of Pictures. By my fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent attendance on ſales, I already know
almoſt as much of Painting as I do of the Funds; and can talk as learnedly of
Light and Shade, Figure, Proportion, Drapery, &amp;c. as of the riſe and fall
of Stocks. I have however been very much embarraſſed in getting together a
collection ſuitable to the religion I profeſs. The famous Painters were
moſt of them ſuch bigots to their own way of thinking, that they have
ſcarce left any thing behind them but <hi>Holy Families, dead Chriſts,</hi>
and <hi>Madonas</hi>; ſubjects which to <pb n="10" facs="tcp:1252700301:11"/> Me and my Tribe
are odious and abominable. A Pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſince it has the property of being the
language of all mankind, ſhould never be particular in it's ſubject; but we
ſhould paint, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are taught to pray, 
<q rend="inline">"for all Jews, Turks, Infidels and
Hereticks."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>WHEN I have made the tour of <hi>Italy,</hi> I will ſend you
a complete liſt of all my purchaſes: in the mean time, the following
ſhort ſpecimen will enable you to judge of my precautions in ſelecting
Pieces ſuitable to my character, and not offenſive to my principles.</p>
                     <p>THE firſt that I bought was "the Elevation of the GOLDEN
CALF." This I ſhall ſet up in the <hi>Royal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change,</hi> as a typical
repreſentation of myſelf, to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipp'd by all Brokers, Inſurers,
Scriveners, and the whole fraternity of Stock-jobbers.</p>
                     <p>THE ſecond is "the Triumph of GIDEON." This I intended, if a
late project in favour of our brethren had not miſcarried, to have been hung
up in St. <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Chapel, as a memorial of our victory over the
Uncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed.</p>
                     <p>THE third and fourth are "PETER denying his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter," and
"JUDAS betraying him for thirty pieces of ſilver;" both which I deſign as
preſents to our two worthy friends the B—s of — and —.</p>
                     <p>THE next which I ſhall mention to you, deſerves
parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice; and this is "the Prophet of <hi>Nazareth</hi> himſelf,
conjuring the Devil into an Herd of Swine." From this piece, when I return to
<hi>England,</hi> I intend to have a Print engraved; being very proper to be
had in all <hi>Jewiſh</hi> fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, as a neceſſary preſervative
againſt Pork, and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E Writers of Eſſays, or (as they are termed) Periodical
Papers, juſtly claim to ourſelves a place among the modern improvers of
li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terature. Neither <hi>Bentley</hi> nor <hi>Burman,</hi> nor any equally
ſagacious Commentator, has been able to diſcover the leaſt traces of any
ſimilar produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions among the Ancients: except we can ſuppoſe, that the
Hiſtory of <hi>Thucydides</hi> was retailed weekly in ſix-penny numbers;
that <hi>Seneca</hi> dealt out his Morality every Saturday; or that
<hi>Tully</hi> wrote Speeches and Philoſophical Diſquiſitions, whilſt
<hi>Virgil</hi> and <hi>Horace</hi> clubb'd together to furniſh the Poetry
for a <hi>Roman</hi> Magazine.</p>
               <p>THERE is a word indeed, by which we are fond of
diſtinguiſhing our works, and for which we muſt confeſs 
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1252700301:19"/> ourſelves indebted to the <hi>Latin.</hi> Myſelf, and
every petty Journaliſt, affect to dignify our haſty performances by
ſtiling them LUCUBRATIONS: by which we mean, if we mean any thing, that as
the day is too ſhort for our labours, we are obliged to call in the
aſſiſtance of the night: not to mention the modeſt inſinuation, that
our compoſitions are ſo correct, that, like the Orations of
<hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> they may be ſaid to <hi>ſmell of the lamp.</hi> We
would be underſtood to follow the directions of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Satiriſt, 
<q rend="inline">"to grow pale by the midnight candle;"</q>
though perhaps, as our own Satiriſt expreſſes it, we may be thought 
<q> 
                     <l>"Sleepleſs ourſelves to give our readers
ſleep."</l>
                  </q> But, as a relief from the fatigue of ſo many reſtleſs
hours, we have frequently <hi>gone to ſleep</hi> for the benefit of the
public: and ſurely we, whoſe labours are confined to a ſheet and half,
may be indulged in taking a nap now and then, ſince a modern DREAMER has
outdone even BUNYAN in ſtile and ſentiment, and pompouſly dozed through
an whole Octavo.</p>
               <p>AFTER this preface, the reader will not be ſurprized if I take
the liberty to relate a Dream of my own. It is uſual on theſe occaſions
to be lulled to ſleep by ſome book; and moſt of my brethren pay that
compliment to <hi>Virgil</hi> or <hi>Shakeſpeare:</hi> but as I could never
diſcover any opiate quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in thoſe authors, I choſe to ſlumber
over ſome modern performance. I muſt beg to be excuſed from mentioning
particulars, as I would not provoke the reſentment of my cotemporaries:
Nobody will imagine, that I dipt into any of our modern Novels, or took up any
of our late Trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.—Let it ſuffice, that I preſently fell faſt
aſleep.</p>
               <p>I FOUND myſelf tranſported in an inſtant to the ſhore of
an immenſe ſea, covered with innumerable veſſels and tho' 
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1252700301:20"/> many of them ſuddenly diſappeared every minute, I
ſaw others continually launching forth, and purſuing the ſame courſe.
The Seers of Viſions, and Dreamers of Dreams, have their organs of ſight
ſo conſiderably improved, that they can take in any object, however
diſtant or minute. It is not therefore to be wonder'd at, that I could
diſcern every<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſtinctly, though the waters before me were of the
deepeſt black.</p>
               <p>WHILE I ſtood contemplating this amazing ſcene, one of
thoſe good-natured <hi>Genii,</hi> who never fail making their appearance to
extricate Dreamers from their difficulties, roſe from the ſable ſtream,
and planted himſelf at my elbow. His complexion was of the darkeſt hue, not
unlike the <hi>Daemons</hi> of a printing-houſe; his jetty beard ſhone like
the briſtles of a blacking-bruſh; on his head he wore a Turbant of Imperial
Paper; and 
<q> 
                     <l>"There hung a Calf-ſkin on his rev'rend limbs,"</l>
                  </q>
which was gilt on the back, and faced with robings of <hi>Morocco,</hi>
letter'd (like a Rubric-poſt) with the names of the moſt eminent authors.
In his right hand he bore a printed ſcroll, which from the marginal
corrections I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd to be a Proof-ſheet; and in his left he waved the
Quill of a Gooſe.</p>
               <p>HE immediately accoſted me.— 
<q rend="inline">"TOWN, ſaid he, I am the <hi>Genius</hi> who
is deſtined to conduct you thro' theſe turbulent waves. The ſea that you
now behold is <hi>The</hi> OCEAN <hi>of</hi> INK. Thoſe towers, at a great
diſtance, whoſe baſes are founded upon rocks, and whoſe tops ſeem
loſt in the clouds, are ſituated in <hi>The</hi> ISLES <hi>of</hi> FAME.
Contiguous to theſe, you may diſcern by the glittering of its golden
ſands <hi>The</hi> COAST <hi>of</hi> GAIN, which leads to a fertile and rich
country. All the veſſels, which <pb n="16" facs="tcp:1252700301:21"/> are yonder ſailing
with a fair wind on the main ſea, are making towards one or other of theſe:
but you will ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that on their firſt ſetting-out they were
irreſiſtibly drawn into <hi>The</hi> EDDIES <hi>of</hi> CRITICISM, where
they were obliged to encounter the moſt dreadful tempeſts and hurricanes.
In theſe dangerous ſtreights you ſee with what violence every bark is
toſt up and down; ſome go to the bottom at once; others, after a faint
ſtruggle, are beat to pieces; many are much damaged; while a few by ſound
planks and tight rigging are enabled to weather the ſtorm."</q>
               </p>
               <p>AT this ſight I ſtarted back with horror; and the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance ſtill dwells ſo ſtrong upon my fancy, that I even now
imagine the Torrent of Criticiſm burſting in upon me, and ready to
overwhelm me in an inſtant.</p>
               <p> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Caſt a look, reſumed my Inſtructor, on
that vaſt Lake divided into two parts, which lead to yonder magnificent
ſtructures, erected by the <hi>Tragic</hi> and <hi>Comic Muſe.</hi> There
you may obſerve many trying to force a paſſage without chart or
compaſs. Some have been overſet by crowding too much ſail, and others
have founder'd by carrying too much ballaſt. An <hi>Arcadian</hi> veſſel
(the maſter an <hi>Iriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man)</hi> was, thro' contrary ſqualls, ſcarce
able to live nine days: but you ſee that light <hi>Italian</hi> Gondola,
<hi>Gli Amanti Geloſi,</hi> ſkims along pleaſantly before the wind, and
out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrips the painted Frigates of her country, <hi>Didone</hi> and
<hi>Artaſerſe.</hi> Obſerve that triumphant Squadron, to whoſe flag all
the others pay homage. Moſt of them are ſhips of the firſt rate, and were
fitted out many years ago. Tho' ſomewhat irregular in their make, and but
little conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the exact rules of art, they will ever continue the
pride and glory of theſe ſeas: for, as it is remarked by 
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1252700301:22"/> the preſent Laureat in his Prologue to <hi>Papal
Tyranny,</hi>
                  </q> 
                  <q> 
                     <l>"<hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> whoſe art no play-wright cou'd
excell;</l> 
                     <l>"Has launch'd us fleets of plays, and built them
well."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Genius</hi> then bad me turn my eye, where the water
ſeemed to foam with perpetual agitation. 
<q rend="inline">"That, ſaid he, is the ſtrong CURRENT
<hi>of</hi> POLITICS, often fatal to thoſe who venture on it."</q> I could
not but take notice of a poor wretch on the oppoſite ſhore, faſten'd by
the ears to a terrible machine. This the <hi>Genius</hi> informed me was the
memorable DEFOE, ſet up there as a Land-mark, to prevent future mariners from
ſplitting on the ſame rock.</p>
               <p>TO this turbulent proſpect ſucceeded objects of a more
placid nature. In a little creek winding thro' flow'ry meads and ſhady
groves, I deſcried ſeveral gilded Yachts and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure-Boats, all of them
keeping due time with their ſilver oars, and gliding along the ſmooth,
even, calm, regularly-flowing RIVULETS <hi>of</hi> RHYME. Shepherds and
Shepherdeſſes play'd on the banks; the ſails were gently ſwelled with
the ſoft breezes of amorous Sighs, and little Loves ſported in the ſilken
cordage.</p>
               <p>MY attention was now called off from theſe pacific ſcenes to
an obſtinate engagement between ſeveral ſhips diſtinguiſh'd from all
others by bearing the <hi>Holy Croſs</hi> for their Colours. Theſe, the
<hi>Genius</hi> told me, were employed in the <hi>Holy War</hi> of
<hi>Religious Controverſy</hi>; and he pointed out to me a few
<hi>Corſairs</hi> in the ſervice of the <hi>Infidels,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
aiding one party, ſometimes ſiding with the other, as might beſt
contribute to the general confuſion.</p>
               <p>IT were needleſs to enumerate many other particulars that
engaged my notice. Among the reſt was a large Fleet of Annotators,
<hi>Dutch</hi>-built, which ſailed very heavy, were <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1252700301:23"/>
often a-ground, and continually ran foul on each other. The whole Ocean, I
alſo found, was infeſted by Pyrates, who ranſacked every rich veſſel
that came in their way. Moſt of theſe were endeavouring to make the
<hi>Coaſt of Gain</hi> by hanging out Falſe Colours, or by forging their
Paſs-ports, and pretending to be freighted by the moſt reputable
Traders.</p>
               <p>MY eyes were at laſt fix'd, I know not how, on a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
Channel running thro' the midſt of a great City. I felt ſuch a ſecret
impulſe at this ſight, that I could not help enquiring particularly about
it. 
<q rend="inline">"The diſcovery of that Paſſage, ſaid the
<hi>Genius,</hi> was firſt made by one <hi>Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff,</hi> in the good
ſhip call'd <hi>The</hi> TATLER, and who af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards embarked in the
SPECTATOR and GUARDIAN. Theſe have been followed ſince by a numerous
ſhoal of little Sloops, Skiffs, Hoys, and Cock-boats, which have been moſt
of them wreck'd in the attempt; and thither alſo muſt your courſe be
directed."</q> At this inſtant the <hi>Genius</hi> ſuddenly ſnatch'd me
up in his arms, and plunged me headlong into the inky flood. While I lay
gaſping and ſtruggling beneath the waves, methought I heard a familiar
voice calling me by my name; which awaking me, I with pleaſure recollected
the features of the <hi>Genius</hi> in thoſe of my Publiſher, who was
ſtanding by my bed ſide, and had called upon me for Copy.</p>

               <p>I MAY perhaps take a future opportunity of enlarging on this
very important ſubject, the MARRIAGE-BILL; but ſhall at preſent oblige
the ladies by celebrating an Order of Females lately ſprung up amongſt us,
uſually diſtinguiſh'd by the denomination of DEMI-REPS;—a word not
to be found in any of our Dictionaries.</p>
               <p>THIS Order, which ſeems daily encreaſing upon us, was
firſt inſtituted by ſome ladies eminent for their public ſpirit, with a
view of raiſing their half of the ſpecies to a level with the other in the
unbounded licence of their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. By this artifice the moſt open
violation of modeſty takes the name of innocent freedom and gaiety; and as
long as the laſt failing remains a ſecret, the lady's honour is
ſpotleſs and untainted. In a word, a DEMI-REP is a lady whom every body
thinks what no body chuſes to call her.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1252700301:26"/>IT is abſolutely neceſſary that every
lady of this Order ſhould be married. Cuſtom has given a certain charm to
wedlock, which changes the colour of our actions, and renders that behaviour
not improper, which in a ſtate of celibacy would be accounted indecent and
ſcandalous. As to the Promiſes made in marriage 
<q rend="inline">"to love, honour and obey,"</q> cuſtom has
made Them alſo merely ceremonial, and in fact as little binding as the
wedding-ring, which may be put on or pulled off at pleaſure.</p>
               <p>RELIGIOUS and political writers have both for different
reaſons endeavoured to encourage frequent marriages: but this Order, if it
maintains it's ground, will more certainly promote them. How inviting muſt
ſuch a ſtate appear to a woman of ſpirit! An <hi>Engliſh</hi> wife with
all the indiſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a girl may aſſume more than the privileges of a
woman, may trifle publicly with the beaux and ſmarts, introduce them to her
toilette, and fix it as a certain rule in all her converſation and behaviour,
that when once mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage has (in <hi>Lucy</hi>'s phraſe) 
<q rend="inline">"made an honeſt woman of her,"</q> ſhe is
intitled to all the licence of a courtezan.</p>
               <p>I HAVE lately ſeen, with a good deal of compaſſion, a few
forward maiden ladies inveſting themſelves with the dignities, and
incroaching on the privileges of this Order. It may not be improper to caution
them to recede in time. As their claim to theſe liberties is unwarranted by
cuſtom, they will not retain that ambiguous reputation enjoyed by the
DEMI-REPS, whoſe whole ſyſtem of conduct is founded on the baſis of
matrimony. Every lady therefore, inclined to indulge herſelf in all thoſe
little innocent freedoms, ſhould confine herſelf within the pale of
matrimony, to elude cenſure, as inſolvent debtors avoid a jail, by lodging
within the verge of the court.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1252700301:27"/>A DEMI-REP then muſt neceſſarily be
married: nor is it eaſy for a lady to maintain ſo critical a character
unleſs ſhe is a woman of faſhion. Titles and eſtate bear down all weak
cenſures, and ſilence ſcandal and detraction. That good-breeding too,
ſo inviolably preſerved among perſons of condition, is of infinite
ſervice. This produces that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful inſipidity ſo remarkable in
perſons of quality, whoſe converſation flows with one even tenor,
undiſturb'd by ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, and unruffled by paſſion: inſomuch that
huſbands and wives, brothers, ſiſters, couſins, and in ſhort the
whole circle of kindred and acquaintance, can entertain the moſt thorough
contempt and even hatred for each other, without tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing the
minuteſt article of good-breeding and civility. But thoſe females who want
the advantages of birth and fortune, muſt be content to wrap themſelves up
in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity; for the lower ſort are ſo notoriouſly deficient in
the requiſites of politeneſs, that they would not fail to throw out the
moſt cruel and bitter invectives againſt the pretty delinquents.</p>
               <p>THE Great World will, I doubt not, return me thanks for thus
keeping the <hi>canaille</hi> at a diſtance, and ſecuring to them a quiet
poſſeſſion of their enjoyments. And here I cannot but obſerve how
reſpectable an Order the DEMI-REPS compoſe, of which the lovely
ſiſterhood muſt all be married, and almoſt all Right Honourable.</p>
               <p>FOR this Order, among many other embelliſhments of modern
life, we are indebted to the <hi>French:</hi> ſuch flippant gaiety is more
agreeable to the genius of that nation. There is a native baſhfulneſs
inherent in my countrywomen, which it is not eaſy to ſurmount: but our
modern fine ladies, who take as much pains to poliſh their minds, as to adorn
their perſons, have got over this obſtacle with incredible fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility. 
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1252700301:28"/> They have ſo ſkillfully grafted the <hi>French</hi>
genius for intrigue upon <hi>Britiſh</hi> beauty and liberty, that their
conduct appears perfectly original. Though we muſt do the <hi>French</hi> the
juſtice to allow, that when a lady of this airy diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion viſits
<hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe returns moſt wonderfully improved. Upon the whole,
<hi>France</hi> appears the propereſt ſchool to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the ladies in
the theory of their conduct, but <hi>England,</hi> and more eſpecially
<hi>London,</hi> the moſt commodious place to put it in practice. In this
town, indeed, a lady ſtudious of improvement may, in a very ſhort time,
make a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proficiency by frequenting the ſeveral academies kept
conſtantly open for her profit and inſtruction. The Card-tables and
Maſquerades in particular have trained up ſome ladies to a ſurprizing
eminence without the leaſt aſſiſtance from a foreign education.</p>
               <p>IT is obſerved, that the difference between the ſeveral
ſpecies in the ſcale of beings is but juſt ſufficient to preſerve
their diſtinction; the higheſt of one Order approaching ſo near to the
loweſt of the other, that the gradation is hard to be determined; as the
colours of the rainbow, thro' an infinite variety of ſhades, die away into
each other imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly. The DEMI-REPS hold this intermediate ſtation in
the characters of females between the modeſt women and the women of
pleaſure; to both which they are in ſome meaſure connected, as they
ſtand upon the utmoſt verge of reputation, and totter on the brink of
infamy. It were therefore to be wiſhed, that the Ladies wore ſome ſymbol
of their Order, or were diſtinguiſhed by ſome peculiar mode of dreſs.
The <hi>Romans</hi> aſſigned different habits to perſons of different
ages and ſtations; and I hope, that when the buſtle of the enſuing
Election is over, the new Parliament will take this matter into
conſideration, and oblige the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1252700301:29"/> claſſes of
females to diſtinguiſh themſelves by ſome external marks and badges of
their principles.</p>
               <p>'TILL ſome Act of this nature ſhall take place, I ſhall
propoſe a method, by which every lady may exactly learn in what claſs ſhe
may be reckoned. The world muſt know then, that my very good friend Mr.
AYSCOUGH has at length, with infinite pains and ſtudy, conſtructed a
Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer, upon which he has delineated, after the manner that the degrees
of heat and cold are marked on the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſort, the whole ſcale of female
characters, from the moſt inviolable modeſty to the moſt abandoned
impudence. It is of a commodious ſize to wear at a watch: the liquor within
the tube is a chymical mixture, which being acted on by the circulation of the
blood and animal ſpirits, will riſe and fall according to the deſires and
affections of the wearer. He will very ſhortly publiſh a large
aſſortment of them, to be ſold at his ſhop on <hi>Ludgate-Hill:</hi>
and I flatter myſelf there are many women in <hi>England,</hi> who will be
glad to purchaſe ſuch an effectual regulator of their paſſions. Every
lady therefore may avail herſelf of the inſtructions of tills
pocket-monitor; a monitor who will give her the moſt profitable leſſons
without the uſual impertinence of advice. It will be of equal efficacy if
worn by the men: but I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect my friend will have but little of their
cuſtom; for as the reputation of chaſtity is the utmoſt aim of a fine
lady, to preſerve even that in a fine gentleman is accounted mean and
unmanly.</p>

melancholy ſubject; a ſubject which I fear will be attended with the moſt
dreadful conſequences to the whole nation. Notwithſtanding the laſt mail
brought the College poſitive aſſurances from the <hi>French</hi> King's
phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, that the late PLAGUE at <hi>Rouen</hi> was entirely ceaſed, I
have the ſtrongeſt reaſons to apprehend that the contagion is already
ſpread to this city. My own practice daily fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes me with lamentable
inſtances, that manifeſtly indicate a peſtilential diſorder in the
blood and humours.</p>
                     <p>I WAS firſt induced to ſuſpect that ſome Epidemical
Diſtemper was taking root among us, from my being called <pb n="26" facs="tcp:1252700301:31"/>
in to a noble patient, who (as the public prints have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd you) has lately
been afflicted with a violent boil on his back. From this patient there have
iſſued continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally great quantities of corruption of a yellow hue. His
complaint ſeems to be in ſome ſort conſtitutional, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly
breaks out with extraordinary virulence every ſeven year; and as this is the
criſis, we cannot pronounce our noble patient out of danger, 'till he has got
over the enſuing ſpring. It is moreover to be feared, that the contagion
has likewiſe reached <hi>Ireland</hi>; where we hear that the beſt
phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians are uſing the moſt forcing medicines, and are of opinion that
nothing can relieve the unhappy people, 'till they have <hi>voided a</hi>
STONE. A great man there labours alſo under the abovementioned complaint of
having a <hi>violent</hi> BOYLE <hi>on his back.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I SHALL now proceed to give you the hiſtory of ſome other
caſes, which have fallen under my notice, and are to me an indiſputable
proof that the PLAGUE has got footing among us. It's malignancy ſhews
itſelf particularly about the Court; and we are aſſured that ſome parts
of the Country are alſo tainted with it. I have had the honour to attend
ſeveral Members of Parliament, whoſe caſes are very deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate. Some I
found in a declining way, given over by all their friends; others are ſo
weak, that they can't ſtand alone; and many are ſo reſtleſs, that they
are continually turning from ſide to ſide. As I found they had great need
of ſupport, I have adviſed them to drink plentifully of ſtrong liquors,
and guard againſt the ill conſequences of a <hi>Return.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I VISITED the other day a young gentleman, who has lately been
promoted to a command in the ſquadron deſigned for the <hi>Eaſt
Indies.</hi> I found him in a moſt languiſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, his ſpirits
were quite depreſs'd, he had a violent palpitation of the heart, and the
whole nervous ſyſtem was relax'd. I would have preſcribed the well-known
diet-drink brought into practice by the late Biſhop of <hi>Cloyne</hi>; but
he told me every thing went againſt his <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1252700301:32"/> ſtomach that
favoured of <hi>Tar.</hi> However, I at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on him to ſubmit to
a long courſe of Sea Water. I have obſerv'd the ſame prognoſtics in
ſome of our land officers; to whom I have recommended the frequent uſe of
Exerciſe, together with a courſe of Steel, and a Powder compoſed of Nitre
and Brimſtone.</p>
                     <p>A FRIEND of mine, one of the common-council men of this city,
is infected to a ſtrong degree with the preſent peſtilence. His chief
complaint is a <hi>canine</hi> appetite, and his wife aſſures me ſhe has
often felt the wolf in his belly. The cauſe of this diſtemper is originally
in the palate, and diſcovers itſelf by a watering of the mouth from the
ſalival glands, and a grinding of the teeth as in the action of
maſtication. This diſorder being very common in the city, and likely to
ſpread among the Livery, I have directed him to <hi>perform Quarentine</hi>
by abſtaining from fleſh during the preſent Lent.</p>
                     <p>I KNOW another, a very worthy alderman, who now lies in a
moſt deplorable condition. He is ſwelled to a moſt enormous ſize; his
whole face, and particularly his noſe, is cruſted over with fiery
puſtules of the confluent kind. He is afflicted with an inſatiable
thirſt, and is very ſubject to <hi>epileptic</hi> fits. I was ſent for
laſt night, when one of theſe fits was very ſtrong upon him. He lay, to
all appearance, dead on the floor, wallowing in the midſt of a fetid maſs,
partly ſolid, partly fluid, which had iſſued from his mouth and
noſtrils with repeated eructations. I would immediately have adminiſtred to
him a proper doſe of <hi>aq. font. tepefact.</hi> but on offering him the
draught he ſhew'd the ſtrongeſt ſymptoms of a confirmed
<hi>Hydrophobia.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I WENT out of charity to ſee a poor tragic author (no
reflection upon any of the profeſſion, Mr. TOWN) who has been obliged to
keep his room all the winter, and is dying by inches of an inveterate
<hi>Atrophy.</hi> By his extravagant ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, ſudden ſtarts, incoherent
expreſſions, and paſſionate <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1252700301:33"/> exclamations, I judged
his diſorder to be ſeated in the brain, and therefore directed his head to
be bliſter'd all over. I cured another, a comic author, of a lethargy, by
making a revulſion of the bad humour from the part affected with
ſtimulating cathartics. A ſhort ſquabby gentleman of a groſs and
corpulent make was ſeiz'd with a kind of St. <hi>Vitus</hi>'s Dance, as he
was practiſing Harlequin for the maſquerade: his whole body was convulſed
with the moſt violent writh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and irregular twitches; but I preſently
removed his complaint by bleeding him in the foot.</p>
                     <p>THE PLAGUE, as I obſerved before, puts on different
appearances in different ſubjects. A perſon of quality, one of the club at
<hi>White</hi>'s, was ſeiz'd with the epidemical phrenzy raging there, which
propagates itſelf by certain black and red ſpots. He had ſuffered ſo
much loſs by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual evacuations, that his whole ſubſtance was
waſted; and when I ſaw him he was ſo reduc'd, that there were no hopes of
a recovery. Another nobleman caught the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> which
brought upon him ſuch a <hi>running,</hi> that he is now in the laſt
ſtage of a <hi>galloping</hi> conſumption. A reverend divine, lately made a
dignitary of the church, has unhappily loſt his memory, and is ſo blind
withal, that he hardly knows any of his old acquaintance: the muſcles of his
face are all contracted into an auſtere frown, his knees are ſtiff and
inflexible, and he is unable, poor gentleman! to bend his body, or move his
hand to his head. I have obſerv'd others ſeiz'd at times with a ſtrange
kind of deaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and at certain intervals I have found them ſo
prodigiouſly hard of hearing, that tho' a tradeſman has bawled ever ſo
loudly in their ears, it has had no effect upon them.</p>
                     <p>BY what means this PLAGUE has been introduc'd among us, cannot
eaſily be aſcertained;—whether it was imported in the ſame band-box
with the laſt new head, or was ſecretly convey'd in the plaits of an
embroider'd ſuit:—but that it came over hither from <hi>France,</hi>
plainly appears from the manner in which it affects our people of faſhion,
(eſpecially <pb n="29" facs="tcp:1252700301:34"/> the ladies) who bear about them the moſt
evident marks of the <hi>French Diſeaſe.</hi> This is known to affect the
whole <hi>habit of body,</hi> and extends it's influence from head to foot. But
it's ſtrongeſt attacks are levell'd at the face; and it has ſuch an
effect upon the complexion, that it entirely changes the natural colour of the
ſkin. At <hi>Paris</hi> the face of every lady you meet is beſmear'd with
unguent, ceruſs, and plaiſter; and I have lately remarked with infinite
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the native charms of my pretty countrywomen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by the ſame
cauſe. In this caſe I have always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed calling in the
aſſiſtance of a ſurgeon to pare off this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural <hi>Epidermis</hi>
or Scarf-ſkin, occaſion'd by the ignorance of Empirics in the immoderate
application of <hi>Alteratives.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>FROM what I have been able to collect from obſervations on
my female patients, I have found little variation in the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the PLAGUE
on that ſex. Moſt of them complain of a laſſitude, a
liſtleſsneſs, an uneaſineſs, pains they don't know where, vapours,
hyſterics, want of reſt, want of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and loſs of appetite:
conſequently the ſame regimen may ſerve for all. I adviſe them to uſe
a great deal of exerciſe in driving about the town, to dilute properly with
tea, to perſpire freely at public places, and in their ſeaſons to go to
<hi>Bath, Tunbridge, Cheltenham,</hi> or <hi>Scarborough.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I WAS indeed ſurpriz'd with an extraordinary new caſe the
other night, when I was called out of bed to attend a Maid of Honour, who is
frequently afflicted with fits of the mother. Her abdomen I found, upon
examination, to be preternaturally diſtended: the tumour has been gradually
increaſing; but I would not attempt to diſcuſs it, as it was not yet
arrived at maturity. I intend ſoon to remove her into the country for a
month, in order to deliver her from the complaint ſhe labours under.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE been induced, ſir, to write to you on this
oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as you are pleas'd to take this city under your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate care.
So alarming an evil calls upon us all to <pb n="30" facs="tcp:1252700301:35"/> oppoſe it's
progreſs; for my own part, nothing ſhall deter me from a diligent
diſcharge of the duty of my profeſſion, tho' it has already expoſed me
to the greateſt dangers in the execution of it. An old captain of a man of
war, who is grievouſly troubled with the <hi>cholera morbus,</hi> and
overflowing of the gall, on my only hinting a Clyſter ſwore vehemently that
I ſhould take one myſelf, and applying his foot di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to my fundament,
kick'd me down ſtairs. This very morning I eſcaped almoſt by miracle from
the contagion, which raged in the moſt violent degree through a whole family.
The maſter and miſtreſs are both of them in a very high fever, and quite
frantic and delirious: their tongues were prodigiouſly inflamed, the tip very
ſharp, and perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually vibrating without the leaſt intermiſſion. I
would have preſcribed ſome cooling and lenitive medicines, but the
huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in the height of his frenzy flung my wig into the fire, and his wife
ſluiced me with extravaſated urine. As I retired with precipitation, I
heard the ſame wild ravings from the nurſery, the kitchen, and every other
quarter, which convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced me that the peſtilence had ſeiz'd the whole
houſe. I ran out of doors as faſt as poſſible, reflecting with Terence,

<q> 
                           <l>—Ipſa ſi cupiat Salus,</l>

familiam.</l>
                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>UPON the whole, I may conclude with the Aphoriſm of
<hi>Hippocrates</hi>; that 
<q rend="inline">"no people can poſſibly be afflicted with

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> REMEMBER to have ſeen in ſome old <hi>Italian</hi> Poet a
fable call'd "The Education of the Muſes." <hi>Apollo</hi> is there ſaid to
have taken them at their birth under his immediate care, and as they grew up to
have inſtructed them according to their different capacities in the ſeveral
branches of playing and ſinging. <hi>Thalia,</hi> we are told, was of a
lively turn, and took delight in the moſt comic airs; but was at firſt with
difficulty reſtrained from falling into ridiculous drolleries, and what our
author calls <hi>extravaganzas</hi> in her manner. <hi>Melpomene,</hi> who was
of a ſerious and grave diſpoſition, indulged herſelf in ſtrains of
melancholy; but when ſhe aimed at the moſt pathetic ſtrokes, was often
harſh, or run into wild diviſions. <hi>Clio,</hi> and the reſt of the
Nine, had not yet learnt to temper their voices with ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs 
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1252700301:37"/> and variety; nor could they tell how to regulate the
ſtops of their flutes, or touch the ſtrings of their lyres, with judgment
and grace. However, by much practice, they improved gradually under the
inſtructions of <hi>Apollo,</hi> 'till at laſt they were able to exert all
the powers of muſic: and they now form a compleat concert, which fills all
<hi>Parnaſſus</hi> with the moſt enchanting harmony.</p>
               <p>THE moral to be drawn from this little fable is naturally
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to thoſe ſervants of the Muſes, Authors, who muſt
ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily riſe by the ſame ſlow degrees from their firſt lame
attempts in cultivating the arts of <hi>Apollo.</hi> The beſt of them,
without doubt, went through many more ſtages of writing than appears from the
palpable gradations ſtill remaining in their works. But as it is
impoſſible to trace them from their firſt ſetting out, I ſhall here
preſent the reader with the ſum of my own experience, and illuſtrate in
the life of Mr. TOWN, the Progreſs of an Author.</p>
               <p>RIGHT or wrong, I have ever been addicted to ſcribbling. I was
famous at ſchool for my readineſs at Crambo and capping verſes: I often
made themes for other boys, and ſold my copy for a tart or a cuſtard: at
nine years old I was taken notice of for an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Diſtich, and
afterwards immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talized myſelf by an Holyday's Taſk in the ſame
language, which my maſter, who was himſelf a poet, pronounc'd to be
ſcarce inferior to his favourite <hi>Blackmore.</hi> Theſe were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
by a multitude of little pieces, that, like other fruits which come before
their proper ſeaſon, had nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend them but their early
appearance.</p>
               <p>FILLED however with great conceptions of my genius and
importance, I could not but lament that ſuch extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary parts ſhould be
confined within the narrow circle of <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1252700301:38"/> my relations and
acquaintance. Therefore, in order to oblige and amaze the public, I ſoon
became a very large contributor to the Monthly Magazines. But I had the
un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable mortification to ſee my favours ſometimes not inſerted,
often poſtponed, often much altered, and you may be ſure for the worſe.
On all theſe occaſions I never failed to condemn the arrogance and folly of
the compilers of theſe miſcellanies, wondering how they could ſo
groſsly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake their own intereſt, and neglect the entertainment of
their readers.</p>
               <p>IN the mean time a maiden aunt with whom I lived, a very pious
old lady, turned Methodiſt, and often took me with her to the Tabernacle, the
Foundery, and many private meetings. This made ſuch an impreſſion upon my
mind, that I devoted myſelf entirely to ſacred ſubjects, and wrote
ſeveral Hymns, which were received with infinite applauſe by all the good
women who viſited my aunt; and (the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants being alſo Methodiſts)
they were often ſung by the whole family in the kitchen. I might perhaps in
time have rivalled <hi>Weſley</hi> in theſe divine compoſitions, and had
even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun an entire new verſion of the Pſalms, when my aunt, changing her
religion a ſecond time, became a Moravian. But the Hymns uſually ſung by
the United Brethren contain ſentiments ſo ſublime and ſo
incomprehenſible, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my late ſucceſs in that kind of
poetry, and the great opinion I entertained of my own talents, I durſt not
venture on their ſtile and manner.</p>
               <p>AS Love and Poetry mutually produce each other, it is no wonder
that before I was ſeventeen I had ſingled out my particular
<hi>Sachariſſa.</hi> This, you may ſuppoſe, gave birth to innumerable
Songs, Elegies, and Acroſtics. In the ſpace of two years I had written more
love-verſes than <pb n="34" facs="tcp:1252700301:39"/> 
                  <hi>Waller</hi> or any other poet;
when, juſt as I imagined I had ryhmed myſelf into her good graces, I had
the mortification to find that my miſtreſs was married to a Cornet of
Horſe, a fellow who, I am ſure, never wrote a line in his life. This threw
me into ſuch a violent rage againſt the whole ſex, that I immediately
burnt every ſyllable I had written in her praiſe, and in bitterneſs of
ſoul tranſlated the ſixth Satire of <hi>Juvenal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SOON after this the ſon and heir of Lord <hi>Townly,</hi> (to
whom I have the honour of being a diſtant relation) was in a treaty of
marriage with a rich heireſs. I ſat down im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately with great
compoſure to write an Epithalamium on this occaſion. I trimm'd
<hi>Hymen</hi>'s torch, and invited the <hi>Loves</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> to
the wedding: <hi>Concord</hi> was prepared to join their hands, and
<hi>Juno</hi> to bleſs them with a numerous race of children. After all
theſe pains, when every thing was ready for the wedding, and the laſt hand
put to the Epithalamium, the match was ſuddenly broke off, and my poem of
courſe rendered uſeleſs. I was more uneaſy under this diſappointment
than any of the parties could poſſibly be; 'till I was informed of the
ſudden marriage of a noble lord with a celebrated beauty. On this popular
occaſion, promiſing myſelf univerſal applauſe, I immediately
publiſhed my Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalamium; which, like <hi>Bayes</hi>'s Prologue, was
artfully contrived to ſerve one purpoſe as well as another.</p>
               <p>AS my notions had been hitherto confined within a narrow
ſphere of life, my literary purſuits were conſequently leſs important,
'till I had the opportunity of enlarging my ideas by going abroad. My travels,
of which I have before hinted ſomething to the reader, opened to me a new and
extenſive field for obſervation. I will not preſume to boaſt, that I
received any part of my education at <hi>Geneva,</hi> or any of thoſe 
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1252700301:40"/> celebrated foreign Univerſities, in which alone an
ENGLISH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MAN can be grounded in the principles of religion and
liberty:—but I may ſay without vanity that I gleaned ſome uſeful
knowledge from every place I viſited. My propenſity to writing followed me
wherever I went; and were I to meet with encouragement by a large
ſubſcription, I could publiſh ſeveral volumes of curious remarks which
I made in my tour. I had indeed like to have got into ſome unlucky ſcrapes,
by turning author in places where the liberty of the preſs was never ſo
much as heard of. At <hi>Paris</hi> I narrowly eſcaped being put into the
<hi>Baſtile</hi> for a little <hi>Chanſon à boire</hi> reflecting on
the Miſtreſs of the <hi>Grand Monarque</hi>; and I was obliged to quit
<hi>Rome</hi> a week ſooner than I intended, for fixing on <hi>Paſquin</hi>
a Prayer for the Pope's Toe, which was then laid up with the gout.</p>
               <p>IT was not 'till my return from abroad, that I formally
commenc'd a profeſſed Critic, for which I now thought myſelf thoroughly
qualified. I could draw parallels between <hi>Marſeilles</hi> and
<hi>Denoyer,</hi> compare the behaviour of the <hi>French</hi> Parterre with
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pit, and have lately made a figure by affecting an
indifference about the preſent Burlettas, as I took care to let every body
know that I had often ſeen them in <hi>Flanders.</hi> My knowledge in
theatrical affairs naturally led me to write a great number of occaſional
pamphlets on thoſe topics, ſuch as "Examens of New Plays, Letters to the
Managers," &amp;c. Not content with this, I had a ſtrong inclination to
ſhine in the Drama. I often pleaſed myſelf with computing— 
<q rend="inline">"three benefit nights—let me
ſee—ſix hundred pounds at leaſt—an hundred more for the
copy—beſides a perpetual freedom of the Houſe."</q>—Theſe
were temptations not to be reſiſted. I ſat down therefore to a Tragedy;
but before I got through the firſt act, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing to make it
ſufficiently <hi>pathetic</hi> for the modern taſte, <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1252700301:41"/> I
chang'd my ſcheme, and began a Comedy: then again reflecting that moſt of
our Comedies were in reality nothing but overgrown Farces, contented myſelf
with writing what authors are now pleaſed to call a Comedy of two Acts. This
I finiſhed with a great deal of pains, and very much to my own
ſatisfaction: but not being able to get it on the ſtage, as one houſe was
entirely taken up with Pantomimes, and the Manager of the other had ſo many
Farces of his own, I generouſly made a preſent of it to an actor for his
benefit;—when to my great ſurprize it was damn'd.</p>
               <p>I HAVE at laſt reſolv'd to bend all my attention, and
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all my powers, in the carrying on this my preſent ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
undertaking. I am ſorry to own that the ſucceſs has not at all anſwer'd
my expectations: I flatter'd myſelf with being univerſally known, read, and
admir'd; but I find quite the contrary. I went into a coffee-houſe the other
day by White-chapel Mount, where on aſking for the CONNOISSEUR the woman
ſtared at me, and ſaid ſhe did not know what I meant. I dined laſt week
at a foreign ambaſſador's, and not a word about me or my works paſſed
at table. I wrote to a relation at <hi>Caermarthen,</hi> deſiring to know
what reputation my paper has in Wales; but he tells me that nothing in the
li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terary way comes down there but the <hi>King's Speech</hi> and the
<hi>London Evening Poſt.</hi> I have enquired into the ſale of my firſt
number, my ſecond, my third, my fourth, and the laſt; yet I cannot
aſſure my readers that I have ſold three thouſand of any one of them.
In ſhort, I give this public notice once for all, that if I don't find
myſelf taken in all over <hi>England</hi> by the time I have publiſhed two
or three hundred papers,—let them look to it—let them look to
it—I'll bid adieu to my ungrateful country, go directly to
<hi>Berlin,</hi> and (as <hi>Voltaire</hi> is diſcarded) employ my pen in the
ſervice of that Encourager of Arts and Sciences, the King of
<hi>Pruſſia.</hi>

                     <p>I SHALL make no apology for recommending to your notice as
CENSOR GENERAL, a fault which is too common among married people. Love is
indeed a very rare ingredient in modern wedlock, nor can the 
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1252700301:43"/> parties entertain too much affection for each other; but
an open diſplay of it on all occaſions renders them ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous.</p>
                     <p>A FEW days ago I was introduced to a young couple, who were
but lately married, and are reckoned by all their acquaintance to be exceeding
happy in each other. I had ſcarce ſaluted the bride, when the huſband
caught her eagerly in his arms, and almoſt devoured her with kiſſes. When
we were ſeated, they took care to place themſelves cloſe to each other,
and during our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation he was piddling with her fingers, tapping her
cheek, or playing with her hair. At dinner they were mutually employed in
preſſing each other to taſte of every diſh, and the fond appellations
of 
<q rend="inline">"my dear, my love, &amp;c."</q> were
continually bandied acroſs the table. Soon after the cloth was removed, the
lady made a motion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, but the huſband prevented the compliments of
the reſt of the company by ſaying, 
<q rend="inline">"We ſhould be unhappy without her."</q> As
the bottle went round he join'd her health to every toaſt, and could not help
now and then riſing from his chair to preſs her hand, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the
warmth of his paſſion by the ardour of his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſes. This precious
fooling, though it highly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained them, gave me great diſguſt,
therefore, as my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany might very well be ſpared, I took my leave as
ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                     <p>THIS behaviour, though at all times improper, may in ſome
ſort be excuſed, where perhaps the match has been huddled up by the
parents, and the young people are ſuch new acquaintance, that they ſcarce
ever ſaw each other 'till their marriage. A pair of loving turtles may be
indulged in a little amorous billing at their firſt coming 
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1252700301:44"/> together, but this licence ſhould expire with the
Honey-moon, and even in that period be uſed but ſparingly.</p>
                     <p>NOTHING is more common than to ſee a new-married couple
ſetting out with a ſplendor in their equipage, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, and manner of
living, which they have been after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards obliged to retrench: thus it happens
when they have made themſelves remarkable by a ſhow of exceſſive love.
They begin with great <hi>eclat,</hi> are laviſh of their fondneſs at
firſt, but their whole ſtock is ſoon waſted, and their poverty is the
more inſupportable, as their former profuſion has made it more
conſpicuous. I have remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ill conſequence of this indiſcretion in
both caſes: one couple has at laſt had ſeparate beds, while the other
have been carried to the Opera in hackney chairs.</p>
                     <p>TWO people, who are to paſs their whole lives toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, may
ſurely find time enough for dalliance without playing over their pretty
tricks in public. How ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous would it appear, if in a large aſſembly
every one ſhould ſelect his mate, and the whole company ſhould fall into
couples, like the birds on St. <hi>Valentine's Day!</hi> It is equally abſurd
to ſee a man and his wife eternally tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling and toying together, 
<q> 
                           <l>Still amorous, and fond, and billing,</l> 
                           <l>Like <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> on a
ſhilling.</l>

                        </q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I HAVE often been reduced to a kind of aukward diſtreſs on
theſe occaſions, not knowing which way to look, or what to ſay. I
conſider them as playing a game in which the ſtander-by is not at all
intereſted, and would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <pb n="40" facs="tcp:1252700301:45"/> recommend it to every
third perſon in theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to take it as a hint that the
parties have a mind to be alone, and leave the room without further
ceremony.</p>
                     <p>A FRIEND of mine happened to be engaged in a viſit to one of
theſe loving couples. He ſat ſtill for ſome time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out interrupting
the little endearments that paſſed between them. Finding them at length
quite loſt in Nods, Whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, Ogles, and in ſhort wholly taken up with
each other, he rang the bell, and deſired the ſervant to ſend in my
lady's woman. When ſhe came, he led her very gravely to the ſettee, and
began to indulge himſelf in certain free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, which provoked the damſel to
complain loudly of his rudeneſs. The lady flew into a violent paſſion,
and rated him ſeverely for his monſtrous behaviour. My friend beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged her
pardon with great politeneſs, hoped ſhe was not offended, for that he
thought there had been no harm in amuſing himſelf a little while with Mrs.
<hi>Betty,</hi> in the ſame manner as Her Ladyſhip and Sir <hi>John</hi>
had been amuſing themſelves theſe two hours.</p>
                     <p>BUT if this conduct is blameable in young people, how very
abſurd is it in thoſe advanced in years! Who can help laughing when he
ſees a worn-out Beau and Belle practiſing at threeſcore the very follies
that are ridiculous at ſixteen? I could wiſh that ſuch a pair of
antiquated lovers were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated by the pencil of a Hogarth. How
humourouſly would he repreſent two emaciated wrinkled figures, with eyes
ſunk into their heads, lank cheeks, and toothleſs gums, affecting to leer,
ſmile, and languiſh at each other! But this affectation is ſtill more
remarkable, when a liquoriſh old fool is continually fondling a young wife:
though perhaps the ſight is not ſo diſguſting to a ſtranger, who may
reaſonably <pb n="41" facs="tcp:1252700301:46"/> ſuppoſe it to be the overflowings of a
father's tenderneſs for his daughter.</p>
                     <p>IT ſometimes happens that one of them perceives the folly of
this behaviour. I have ſeen a ſenſible man quite uneaſy at the
indiſcreet marks of kindneſs ſhewn by his lady. I know a clergyman in the
country, who is often put to the bluſh by the ſtrange familiarities, which
his wife's love induces her to take with him. As ſhe has had but an
indifferent education, you would often be at a loſs to know whether ſhe is
very kind, or very rude. If he dines abroad, ſhe always ſees him get on
horſeback, and before he has got twenty yards from the door, hollows after
him, 
<q rend="inline">"be at home in time, my dear dog, do."</q> I
have known her almoſt quarrel with him for not buttoning his coat in the
middle of Summer, and ſhe once had the good nature to burn a very valuable
collection of <hi>Greek</hi> Manuſcripts, leſt the poring over thoſe
horrid crooked letters ſhould put her dear <hi>Jack</hi>'s eyes out. Thus
does ſhe tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the poor parſon with her violent affection for him, and
according to the common phraſe, kills him with kindneſs.</p>
                     <p>I WOULD recommend it to all married people, but eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
to the ladies, not to be ſo ſweet upon their dears before company. But I
would not be underſtood to countenance that coldneſs and indifference,
which is ſo faſhionable in the polite world. Nothing is accounted more
ungenteel than for a huſband and wife to be ſeen together in public places;
and if they ſhould ever accidentally meet, they take no more notice of each
other, than if they were abſolute ſtrangers. The gentleman may laviſh as
much gallantry as he pleaſes on other women, and the lady give encouragement
to twenty pretty fellows without cenſure; <pb n="42" facs="tcp:1252700301:47"/> but they would
either of them bluſh at being ſurprized in ſhewing the leaſt marks of a
regard for each other.</p>
                     <p>BEFORE I conclude I cannot but take notice of thoſe
luſcious love-ſcenes, that have ſo great a ſhare in our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern plays;
which are rendered ſtill more fulſom by the officiouſneſs of the
player, who takes every opportunity of heightening the expreſſion by
kiſſes and embraces. In a Comedy, nothing is more reliſhed by the
audience than a loud ſmack which echoes through the whole houſe, and in the
moſt paſſionate ſcenes of a Tragedy, the Hero and Heroine are
continually flying into each others arms. For my part I am never preſent at a
ſcene of this kind, which produces a conſcious ſimper from the Boxes, and
a hearty chuckle of applauſe from the Pit and Galleries, but I am ready to
exclaim with old <hi>Renault</hi>— 
<q rend="inline">"I like not theſe huggers."</q>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> MUST acknowledge the receipt of many letters containing very
laviſh encomiums on my works. Among the reſt a correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, whom I
take to be a Bookſeller, is pleaſed to compliment me on the goodneſs of
my print and paper, but tells me that he is very ſorry not to ſee
ſomething expreſſive of my undertaking in the little cut that I carry in
front. It is true, indeed, that my printer and publiſher held ſeveral
conſultations on this ſubject; and I am aſhamed to confeſs that they
had once prevailed on me to ſuffer a profile of my face to be prefixed to
each number. But when it was finiſhed, I was quite mortified to ſee what a
ſcurvy figure I made in wood: nor could I ſubmit to be hung out, like
<hi>Broughton,</hi> at my own <pb n="44" facs="tcp:1252700301:49"/> door, or let my face
ſerve, like the canvaſs before a booth, to call people in to the
ſhow.</p>
               <p>I HOPE it will not be imputed to envy or malevolence, that I
here remark on this part of the productions of Mr. <hi>Fitz-Adam.</hi> When he
gave his paper the title of <hi>The</hi> WORLD, I ſuppoſe he meant to
intimate his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of deſcribing that part of it, who are known to
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all other perſons No Body, and are therefore empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically call'd
<hi>The</hi> WORLD. if this was to be pictured out in the head-piece, a lady at
her toilette, a party at whiſt, or the jovial member of the
<hi>Dilettanti</hi> tapping the world for champagne, had been the moſt
natural and obvious hieroglyphics. But when we ſee the portrait of a
philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher poring on the globe, inſtead of obſervations on modern life
we might more naturally expect a ſyſtem of geography, or an attempt towards
a diſcovery of the longitude.</p>
               <p>THE reader will ſmile perhaps at a criticiſm of this kind;
yet certainly even here propriety ſhould be obſerved, or at leaſt all
abſurdities avoided: but this matter being uſually left to the printer or
bookſeller, it is often attended with ſtrange blunders and
miſ-applications. I have ſeen a Sermon uſhered in with the
repreſentation of a ſhepherd and ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs ſporting on a bank of
flowers, with two little Cupids ſmiling over head; while perhaps an
Epithalamium or an Ode for a Birth-day has been introduced with death's heads
and croſs-marrow-bones.</p>
               <p>THE inhabitants of <hi>Grubſtreet</hi> are generally very
ſtudious of propriety in this point. Before the half-penny account of an
horſe-race, we ſee the jockeys whipping, ſpurring, joſtling, and the
horſes ſtraining within ſight of the poſt. The laſt dying ſpeech,
character, and behaviour of the <pb n="45" facs="tcp:1252700301:50"/> malefactors preſents us
with a proſpect of the place of execution; and the hiſtory of the London
Prentice exhibits the figure of a lad ſtanding between two lions, and
ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming his hands down their throats. A due regard has been paid to this
article in the ſeveral elegies from that quarter on the death of Mr.
<hi>Pelham.</hi> They are encom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed with diſmal black lines, and all
the ſable emblems of death; nor can we doubt but that an author, who takes
ſuch care to expreſs a decent ſorrow on the outſide of his work, has
infuſed a great deal of the pathetic into the piece itſelf.</p>
               <p>THESE little embelliſhments were originally deſigned to
pleaſe the eye of the reader, as we tempt children to learn their letters by
diſpoſing the alphabet into pictures. But in our modern compoſitions,
they are not only ornamental but uſeful. An angel or a flowerpot, at the
beginning and end of every chapter or ſection, enables the bookſeller to
ſpin out a novel, without plot or incident, to a great number of volumes; and
by the help of theſe decorations properly diſpoſed I have known a little
piece ſwell into a duodecimo, which had ſcarce matter enough for a
ſix-penny pamphlet.</p>
               <p>IN this place I might alſo take notice of the ſeveral new
improvements in the buſineſs of Typography. Though it is reckoned ungenteel
to write a good hand, yet every one is proud of appearing in a beautiful print;
and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of a man of quality come from the preſs in a very neat
letter, though perhaps the Manuſcript is hardly legible. Indeed, our modern
writers ſeem to be more ſollicitous a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout outward elegance than the
intrinſic merit of their compoſitions; and on this account it is thought no
mean recommendation of their works, to advertiſe that they are neatly printed
on an entire new letter. Nor are they only <pb n="46" facs="tcp:1252700301:51"/> indebted to the
preſs for the beauty of the type, but often call in it's aſſiſtance to
explain and enforce the ſentiment. When an author is in doubt whether the
reader will be able to comprehend his meaning, or indeed whether he has any
meaning at all, he takes care to ſprinkle the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence with
<hi>Italicks:</hi> but when he would ſurprize us with any thing more
ſtriking than ordinary, he diſtinguiſhes the emphatical words by large
ſtaring CAPITALS, which overtop the reſt of their fellows, and are
intended, like the grenadiers caps, to give us an idea of ſomething grand and
uncommon. Theſe are deſigned as ſo many hints to let the reader know
where he is to be particularly affected, and anſwer the ſame purpoſe with
the marginal direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in plays, which inform the actor when he is to laugh
or cry.</p>
               <p>THIS practice is moſt remarkable in pieces of modern wit and
humour; and it may be obſerved that where there is the leaſt of theſe
lively qualities, the author is moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of ſubſtituting theſe
arts in their room; imagining that by a judicious diſtribution of theſe
enlivening ſtrokes in different parts of it, his work, however dull in
itſelf, will become ſmart and brilliant. But it muſt not be
diſſembled that the hint was originally taken from the Theatres. The writer
of the play-bills deals out his capitals in ſo juſt a proportion, that you
may tell the ſalary of each actor by the ſize of the letter in which his
name is printed. When the preſent manager of <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> firſt came
upon the ſtage, a new ſet of types two inches long were caſt on purpoſe
to do juſtice to his extraordinary merit. This is ſo proper that the
ſevereſt critics on the Drama cannot be offended at this piece of
theatrical juſtice.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1252700301:52"/>THERE is lately ſprung up among us a new
ſpecies of writers, who are moſt of them perſons of the firſt rank and
faſhion. At this period the whole Houſe of Commons are turned authors; and
we cannot ſufficiently admire the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſtile and ſentiment in
thoſe elegant addreſſes, by which they humbly offer themſelves as
candidates, and beg the favour of your votes and intereſt. Theſe gentlemen
avail themſelves greatly of the arts of printing abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; whether
they would raiſe the merits of their own cauſe, or throw out invectives on
the oppoſite party. The Courtier ſets before your eyes his ſteady
attachment to King GEORGE, while his opponent diſplays in the ſame manner
his zeal for LIBERTY and the CONSTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUTION. This muſt undoubtedly have a
wonderful effect on the electors; and I could aſſure any patriot the moſt
certain ſucceſs, who ſhould manifeſt his regard for Old England by
printing his addreſſes in the Old Engliſh character.</p>
               <p>BUT in the whole republic of letters there are none perhaps who
are more obliged to the printer than the writers of periodical eſſays. The
SPECTATORS indeed came into the world without any of the advantages we are
poſſeſs'd of. They were originally publiſhed in a very bad print and
paper, and were ſo entirely deſtitute of all outward ornaments, that (like
<hi>Terence</hi>'s virgin) 
<q rend="inline">"unleſs the ſoul of beauty had breath'd
through the compoſitions themſelves, theſe diſadvantages would have
ſuppreſs'd the leaſt appearances of it."</q>

                     <l>—nî vis boni</l> 
                     <l>In ipſâ ineſſet formâ, haec formam
extinguerent.</l>
                  </q> 
               </p>
               <p>AS it requires no genius to ſupply a defect of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
our modern eſſays as much excell the SPECTATORS <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1252700301:53"/> in
elegance of form, as perhaps they may be thought to fall ſhort of them in
every other reſpect. But they have this additional advantage, that by the
fineneſs of their paper they are reſcued from ſerving many mean and
ignoble pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to which they might otherwiſe be applied. They alſo
form themſelves more commodiouſly into volumes, and become genteeler
appendages of the tea-table. The candid reader will undoubtedly impute this
extraordinary care about externals to the modeſty of us preſent
eſſayiſts, who are willing to compenſate for our poverty of genius by
beſtowing theſe outward graces and embelliſhments on our works. For my
own part I never reflect on the firſt unadorned publication of the SPECTATOR,
and at the ſame time take up one of my own papers ſet off with every
ornament of the preſs, but I am afraid that the critics will apply what a
facetious peer is ſaid to have remarked on a different occaſion, that 
<q rend="inline">"The firſt is a ſoul without a body, and the

               </p>
               <p>AS in this faſhionable age there are many of Lord
<hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pington</hi>'s opinion, that a book ſhould be recommended by it's
outſide to a man of quality and breeding, it is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on all authors to
appear as well dreſt as poſſible, if they expect to be admitted into
polite company: yet we ſhould not lay too much ſtreſs on the decorations
of our works, but rather remember <hi>Tully</hi>'s precept to all who build,
that

works has given new life and ſpirit to Freethinking. We ſeem at preſent
to be endeavouring to unlearn our Catechiſm, with all that we have been
taught about Religion, in order to model our faith to the faſhion of his
Lordſhip's ſyſtem. We have now nothing to do but to throw away our
Bibles, turn the churches into theatres, and rejoice that an act of Parliament
now in force gives us an opportunity of getting rid of the Clergy by
tranſportation. I was in hopes that the extraordinary price of theſe
volumes would have confined their influence to perſons of quality. As they
are placed above extreme indigence and abſolute want of bread, 
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1252700301:55"/> their looſe notions would have carried them no farther
than plundering their country: but if theſe opinions ſpread among the
vulgar, we ſhall be knocked down at noonday in our ſtreets, and nothing
will go forward but robberies and murders.</p>
               <p>THE inſtances I have lately ſeen of Freethinking in the
lower part of the world make me fear they are going to be as faſhionable and
as wicked as their betters. I went the other night to the <hi>Robin Hood,</hi>
where it is uſual for the advocates againſt religion to aſſemble, and
openly avow their infidelity. One of the queſtions for the night was, 
<q rend="inline">"Whether Lord <hi>Bolinbroke</hi> had not done
greater ſervice to mankind by his writings than the Apoſtles or
Evangeliſts?"</q> As this ſociety is chiefly compoſed of lawyers clerks,
petty tradeſmen, and the loweſt mechanics, I was at firſt ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized to
find ſuch amazing erudition among them. <hi>Toland, Tindal, Collins,
Chubb,</hi> and <hi>Mandeville,</hi> they ſeemed to have got by heart. A
ſhoemaker harangued his five minutes upon the excellence of the tenets
maintained by Lord <hi>Bolin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke</hi>; but I ſoon found that his reading
had not been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended beyond the <hi>Idea of a Patriot King,</hi> which he had
miſtaken for a glorious ſyſtem of Freethinking. I could not help
ſmiling at another of the company, who took pains to ſhew his diſbelief
of the Goſpel by unſainting the Apoſtles, and calling them by no other
title than plain <hi>Paul,</hi> or plain <hi>Peter.</hi> The proceedings of
this ſociety have, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, almoſt induced me to wiſh, that like the
Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics, they were not permitted to read the Bible, rather than they
ſhould read it, only to abuſe it.</p>
               <p>I HAVE frequently heard many wiſe tradeſmen ſettling the
moſt important articles of our faith over a pint of beer. A baker took
occaſion from <hi>Canning</hi>'s affair to maintain, in <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1252700301:56"/>
oppoſition to the Scriptures, that man might live by bread alone, at leaſt
that woman might; for elſe, ſaid he, how could the girl have been
ſupported for a whole month by a few hard cruſts? In anſwer to this, a
barber-ſurgeon ſet forth the improbability of that ſtory, and thence
inferred, that it was impoſſible for our Saviour to have faſted forty
days in the wilderneſs. I lately heard a midſhipman ſwear that the Bible
was all a lie: for he had ſailed round the world with Lord <hi>Anſon,</hi>
and if there had been any Red Sea, he muſt have met with it. I know a
bricklayer, who, while he was working by line and rule, and carefully laying
one brick upon another, would argue with a fellow-labourer, that the world was
made by chance; and a cook, who thought more of his trade than his bible, in a
diſpute about the miracles, made a pleaſant miſtake about the nature of
the firſt, and gravely aſked his antagoniſt what he thought of the SUPPER
at <hi>Cana.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS affectation of Freethinking, among the lower claſs of
people, is at preſent happily confined to the men. On Sundays, while the
huſbands are toping at the alehouſe, the good women their wives think it
their duty to go to church, ſay their prayers, bring home the text, and read
the leſſons with their families. But our polite ladies are, I fear, in
their lives and converſations little better than Freethinkers. Going to
church, ſince it is now no longer the faſhion to carry on intrigues there,
is almoſt wholly laid aſide; and I verily believe, that nothing but another
earthquake can ever fill the churches with people of quality. The fair ſex in
general are too thoughtleſs to concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in deep enquiries into
matters of religion. It is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient that they are taught to believe
themſelves angels: it would therefore be an ill compliment, while we talk of
the heaven they beſtow, to perſuade them into the <hi>Mahometan</hi> 
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:1252700301:57"/> notion, that they have no ſouls: tho' perhaps our fine
gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may imagine, that by convincing a lady ſhe has no ſoul, ſhe
will be leſs ſcrupulous about the diſpoſal of her body.</p>
               <p>THE ridiculous notions maintained by Freethinkers in their
writings ſcarce deſerve a ſerious refutation; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the beſt
method of anſwering them would be to ſelect from their works all the
abſurd and impoſſible notions, which they ſo ſtiffly maintain in
order to evade the belief of the Chriſtian Religion. I ſhall here throw

go Hand in Hand with Your Wiſdoms in <pb n="53" facs="tcp:1252700301:58"/> promoting the
Welfare and Proſperity of the People. The important Buſineſs of Taxes,
Marriages, Jews and Lot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries, We have left to Your weighty Conſideration,
while Ourſelves have been employed in the Regulation of Faſhions, the
Eſtabliſhment of Taſte, and Amendment of the Morals. We have the
Satisfaction to find that both Our Meaſures have hitherto met with Succeſs:
And the Public Affairs are at preſent in ſo proſperous a Condition, that
the National Vices ſeem as likely to decreaſe as the National Debt.</p>
                           <p>THE Diſſolution of Your Aſſembly is now at hand;
and as Your whole Attention will naturally be engaged in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing to
Yourſelves and Friends a Seat in the next Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is needleſs to
recommend to You, that Heads ſhould be broken, Drunkenneſs encouraged, and
Abuſe propagated; which has been found by Experience to be the beſt Method
of ſupporting the Freedom of Elections. In the mean Time, as the Care of the
Nation muſt be left to Us, it is neceſſary that during this Interval Our
Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as CENSOR GENERAL, ſhould be conſiderably ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, and that
We ſhould be inverted with the united Power of Lords and Commons.</p>
                           <p>WHEN We are entruſted with this important Charge, We
ſhall expect that every different Faction fhall concur in Our Meaſures for
the Public Utility; that Whig and Tory, High Church and Low Church, Court and
Country, ſhall all unite in this Common Cauſe; and that oppoſite Parties
in the Body Politic, like the Arms and Legs in the Body Natural, ſhall move
in Concert, though they are on different Sides. In Our Papers, which We ſhall
continue to publiſh every <hi>Thurſday</hi> under the Title of <hi>The</hi>
CONNOISSEUR, every Miſdemeanor ſhall be examined, and Offenders called to
the Bar of the Houſe. Be it therefore enacted, that theſe 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1252700301:59"/> Our Orders and Reſolutions have an equal Authority with
Acts of Parliament, as We doubt not They will be of equal Advantage to the
Community.</p>
                           <p>THE extraordinary Supplies requiſite for the Service
of the current Weeks, and for the Support of Our Own Privy Purſe, oblige Us
to demand of You, that a Sum, not exceeding Two-pence, be levied Weekly on each
Perſon, to be collected by Our truſty and well-beloved the Bookſellers.
We muſt alſo particularly requeſt of You, that the ſame Privilege and
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection be extended to Us which is enjoyed by Yourſelves, and is ſo
very convenient to many of your honourable Members. It is no leſs expedient
that We ſhould be ſecured from Let or Moleſtation: Be it therefore
provided, that no one preſume to arreſt or cauſe to be arreſted Our
Perſon, or the Perſons of Our Publiſher, Printer, Corrector, Devil, or
any other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Our Service.</p>
                           <p>WE have only to add, that You may rely on Our Care and
Diligence in diſcharging the high Truſt repoſed in Us, in ſuch Manner
as ſhall merit the Thanks of the next Parliament. We ſhall then recommend
it to Their Conſideration, whether it would not be for the Intereſt of
theſe Kingdoms, that We ſhould have a Woolpack allotted Us with the
Biſhops, or be allowed a Seat among the Commons, as the Repreſentative of
the whole People: But if this ſhould be deemed too great an Honour, it will
at leaſt be thought neceſſary that We ſhould be occaſionally called
in, like the Judges, to give Our Opinion on Caſes of Importance.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> AM obliged for to-day's paper to the ſame hand that
favoured me with the ſeventh number.</p>
               <p>LEARNING, as it poliſhes the mind enlarges our ideas, and
gives an ingenuous turn to all our conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation and behaviour, has ever been
eſteemed a liberal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment; and is indeed the principal
characteriſtic that diſtinguiſhes the gentleman from the mechanic.</p>
               <p>THIS axiom being univerſally allowed and approved of, I have
often obſerved with wonder the neglect of learning that prevails among the
gentlemen of the army; who, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding <pb n="56" facs="tcp:1252700301:61"/> their
ſhameful deficiency in this main requiſite, are generally propoſed as the
moſt exact models of good behaviour, and ſtandards of politeneſs.</p>
               <p>THE art of war is no eaſy ſtudy: it requires much labour and
application to go through what <hi>Milton</hi> calls 
<q rend="inline">"the rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſoldierſhip in all the
ſkill of embattling, march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, encamping, fortifying, beſieging and
battering, with all the helps of ancient and modern ſtratagems, Tactics, and
warlike maxims."</q> With all theſe every officer ſhould undoubtedly be
acquainted; for mere regimentals no more create a ſoldier, than the cowl a
monk. But, I fear, the generality of our army have made little proficiency in
the art they profeſs, have learnt little more than juſt to acquit
themſelves with ſome decency at a review, have not ſtudied and examined
as they ought the ancient and modern principles of war, 
<q> 
                     <l>"Nor the diviſion of a battle know,</l> 
                     <l>"More than a ſpinſter."</l> 
                     <bibl>SHAKESPEARE.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>BESIDES the ſtudy of the art of war itſelf, there are many
collateral branches of literature, of which, as gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and as ſoldiers,
they ſhould not be ignorant. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever bears a commiſſion in the army
ſhould be well read in hiſtory. The examples of <hi>Alexander,
Caeſar,</hi> or <hi>Marl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough,</hi> however illuſtrious, are of little
concern to the generality of readers, but are ſet up as ſo many beacons, to
direct thoſe who are purſuing the ſame courſe to glory. A thorough
knowledge of hiſtory would furniſh a commander with true courage, inſpire
him with an honeſt emulation of his anceſtors, and teach him to gain a
victory without ſhedding blood.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:1252700301:62"/>POETRY too, more eſpecially that of the
ancients, ſeems particularly calculated for the peruſal of thoſe
concerned in war. The ſubject of the <hi>Iliad</hi> is intirely martial, and
the principal characters are diſtinguiſhed from each other chiefly by their
different exertion of the ſingle quality of courage. It was, I ſuppoſe,
on account of this martial ſpirit that breathes throughout the
<hi>Iliad,</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> was ſo captivated with it that he is
ſaid to have laid it every night under his pillow. The principal character in
the <hi>Aeneid</hi> is a general of remarkable piety and courage, and great
part of the poem is made up of war. Theſe ſtudies cannot ſurely fail of
animating a modern breaſt, which often kindled ſuch a noble ardour in the
antients.</p>
               <p>IF we look into the lives of the greateſt generals of
anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, we ſhall find them no mean proficients in ſcience. They led
their armies to victory by their courage, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the ſtate by their
counſels. They revered the ſame <hi>Pallas</hi> as the goddeſs of war and
of wiſdom; and the <hi>Spartans</hi> in particular, before they entered on an
engagement, always ſacrificed to the <hi>Muſes.</hi> The exhortations given
by commanders before the onſet are ſome of the moſt animated pieces of
oratory in all antiquity, and frequently produced aſtoniſhing effects,
rouſing the ſoldiers from deſpair, and hurrying them on to victory. An
illiterate commander would have been the contempt of <hi>Greece</hi> and
<hi>Rome. Tully</hi> indeed was called <hi>the learned Conſul</hi> in
deriſion, but then, as <hi>Dryden</hi> obſerves, 
<q rend="inline">"His head was turned another way; when he read
the <hi>Tactics,</hi> he was thinking on the bar, which was his field of
battle."</q> I am particularly pleaſed with the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of <hi>Scipio
Aemilianus</hi> as drawn by <hi>Velleius Paterculus,</hi> and would recommend
it to the ſerious imitation of our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern officers. He was ſo great an
admirer of liberal ſtudies, that he always retained the moſt eminent wits
in his camp: <pb n="58" facs="tcp:1252700301:63"/> nor did any one fill up the intervals of
buſineſs with more elegance, retiring from war only to cultivate the arts
of peace; always employed in arms or ſtudy, always exerciſing his body with
perils, or diſciplining his mind with ſcience. The author contraſts this
amiable portrait with a deſcription of <hi>Mummius,</hi> a general ſo
little verſed in the polite arts, that hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken at <hi>Corinth</hi>
ſeveral pictures and ſtatues of the greateſt artiſts, he threatened the
perſons who were intruſted with the carriage of them to <hi>Italy,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"that if they loſt thoſe they ſhould give
new ones."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I WOULD fain have a <hi>Britiſh</hi> officer looked upon with
as much reſpect as thoſe of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Rome:</hi> but while
they neglect the acquiſition of the ſame accompliſhments, this can never
be the caſe. Inſtead of cultivating their minds, they are wholly taken up
in adorning their bodies, and look upon gallantry and intrigue as eſſential
parts of their character. To glitter in the boxes or at an aſſembly, is the
full diſplay of their politeneſs, and to be the life and ſoul of a lewd
brawl almoſt the only exertion of their courage; inſomuch that there is a
good deal of juſtice in <hi>Macheath's</hi> raillery, when he ſays, 
<q rend="inline">"if it was not for us, and the other gentlemen
of the ſword, <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> would be uninhabited."</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is ſomething ſtrange that Officers ſhould want any
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement to acquire ſo gentleman-like an accompliſhment as learning. If
they imagine it would derogate from their good-breeding, or call off their
attention from military buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, they are miſtaken. Pedantry is no more
connected with learning, than raſhneſs with courage. <hi>Caeſar,</hi> who
was the fineſt gentleman and the greateſt general, was alſo the beſt
ſcholar of his age.</p>
               <p>TO ſay the truth, learning wears a more amiable aſpect and
winning air in courts and camps, whenever it appears <pb n="59" facs="tcp:1252700301:64"/>
there, than amid the gloom of colleges and cloiſters. Mixing in genteel life
files off the ruſt that may have been contracted by ſtudy, and wears out
any little oddneſs or peculiarity that may be acquired in the cloſet. For
this reaſon the officer is more inexcuſable who neglects an
accompliſhment that would ſit ſo gracefully upon him: for this reaſon
too, we pay ſo great deference to thoſe few, who have enriched their minds
with the treaſures of antiquity. An illiterate officer either hardens into a
bravo, or refines into a fop: the inſipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of the fop is utterly
contemptible, and a rough brutal courage, unpoliſhed by ſcience, and
unaſſiſted by reaſon, has no more claim to heroiſm than the
caſe-harden'd valour of a bruiſer or prize-fighter. Agreably to this notion
<hi>Homer</hi> in the fifth <hi>Iliad</hi> repreſents the goddeſs
<hi>Minerva</hi> as wounding <hi>Mars,</hi> and driving the heavy deity off the
field of battle; implying allegorically, that wiſdom is capable of ſubduing
courage.</p>
               <p>I WOULD flatter myſelf that <hi>Britiſh</hi> minds are
ſtill as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and <hi>Britiſh</hi> genius as exuberant, as that of any
other nation or age whatever; but that ſome are debaſed by luxury, and
others run wild for want of proper cultivation. If <hi>Athens</hi> can boaſt
her <hi>Miltiades, Themiſtocles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rome</hi> her <hi>Camillus,
Fabius, Caeſar,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>England</hi> has had her <hi>Edwards,
Henrys,</hi> and <hi>Marlboroughs.</hi> It is to be hoped the time will come,
when learning will be reckoned as neceſſary to qualify a man for the army,
as for the bar or pulpit. Then we may expect to ſee the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
ſoldiery enter on the field of battle, as on a theatre, for which they are
prepared in the parts they are to act. 
<q rend="inline">"They will not then (as <hi>Milton</hi>
expreſſes himſelf with his uſual ſtrength in his <hi>Treatiſe on
Education)</hi> if intruſted with fair and hopeful armies, ſuffer them, for
want of juſt and wiſe diſcipline, to ſhed away from about 
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1252700301:65"/> them like ſick feathers, tho' they be never ſo oft
ſupplied: They would not ſuffer their empty and unrecruitible co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels of
twenty men in a company, to quaff out, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey into ſecret hoards, the
wages of a deluſive liſt and a miſerable remnant; yet in the mean while
to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter'd with a ſcore or two of drunkards, the only ſoldiery
left about them, or elſe to comply with all ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pines and violences. No
certainly, <hi>if they knew ought of that knowledge that belongs to good men
and good governors,</hi> they would not ſuffer theſe thing."</q>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE principal character in <hi>Steel</hi>'s comedy of the
<hi>Lying Lover</hi> is young <hi>Bookwit</hi>; an Oxonian, who at once throws
off the habit and manners of an academic, and aſſumes the dreſs, air, and
converſation of a man of the town. He is, like other fine Gentlemen, a
coxcomb, but a coxcomb of learning and parts. His erudition he renders
ſubſervient to his pleaſures: his knowledge in Poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try qualifies him for
a ſonneteer, his Rhetoric to ſay fine things to the ladies, and his
Philoſophy to regulate his equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page; for he talks of having
<hi>peripatetic</hi> footmen, a <hi>follower of Ariſtippus</hi> for a
<hi>Valet de Chambre,</hi> an <hi>epicurean</hi> cook, with an <hi>hermetical
chymiſt</hi> (who are good only at making fires) <pb n="62" facs="tcp:1252700301:67"/> for a
ſcullion. Thus he is in every particular a fop of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, a compleat
claſſical beau.</p>
               <p>BY a review I have lately made of the people in this great
metropolis, as CENSOR, I find that the town ſwarms with <hi>Bookwits.</hi>
The play-houſes, park, taverns and coffee-houſes are thronged with them.
Their manner, which has ſomething in it very characteriſtic, and different
from the town-bred coxcombs, diſcovers them to the ſlighteſt obſervers.
It is indeed no eaſy matter for one whoſe chief employment is to ſtore
his mind with new ideas, to throw that happy vacancy, that total abſence of
thought and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection into his countenance, ſo remarkable in our modern
fine gentlemen. The ſame lownging air too that paſſes for genteel in an
univerſity coffee-houſe is ſoon diſtinguiſh'd from the genuine
careleſs loll, and eaſy ſaunter, and brings us over to the notion of Sir
<hi>Willfull</hi> in <hi>The Way of the World,</hi> that a man ſhould be
bound 'prentice to a maker of fops, before he ventures to ſet up for
himſelf.</p>
               <p>YET, in ſpite of all theſe diſadvantages, the love of
pleaſure and a few ſupernumerary guineas draws the ſtudent from his
literary employment, and entices him to this theatre of noiſe and hurry, this
grand mart of pleaſure, where, as long as his purſe can ſupply him, he
may be as idle as he pleaſes. I could not help ſmiling at a dialogue
between two of theſe gentlemen which I overheard a few nights ago at the
Bedford coffee-houſe. 
<q rend="inline">"Ha! Jack! (ſays one accoſting the other) is
it you? How long have you been in town?"—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Two hours"—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"How long do you ſtay?"—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Ten guineas.—If you'll come to
<hi>Venable</hi>'s after the play is over, you'll find <hi>Tom Latine, Bob
Claſſic</hi> and two or three more who will be very glad to ſee you. What
you're in town upon the ſober plan at your father's? But hark ye
<hi>Frank,</hi> if you'll call in I'll <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1252700301:68"/> tell your friend
<hi>Harris</hi> to prepare for you. So your ſervant; for I'm going to meet
the fineſt girl upon the town in the green boxes.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I LEFT the coffee-houſe pretty late, and as I came into the
piazza the fire in the <hi>Bedford's Arms</hi> kitchen blazed ſo chearfully
and invitingly before me, that I was eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded by a friend that was
with me, to paſs the evening at that houſe. Our good fortune led us into
the next room to this knot of academical rakes. Their merriment being pretty
boiſterous gave us a good pretext to enquire what company were in the next
room. The waiter told us, with a ſmartneſs which thoſe fellows frequently
contract from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending on beaux and wits, 
<q rend="inline">"Some gentlemen from <hi>Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> with
ſome ladies, ſir. My maſter is always very glad to ſee them, for while
they ſtay in town, they never dine or ſup out of his houſe, and eat and
drink, and pay better than any nobleman in town.</q>
               </p>
               <p>AS it grew later, they grew louder: 'till at length an unhappy
diſpute aroſe between two of the company con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the preſent grand
conteſt between the Old and New Intereſt, which has lately inflamed
<hi>Oxfordſhire.</hi> This accident might have been attended with ugly
conſequences: but as the ladies are great enemies to quarrelling, unleſs
themſelves are the occaſion, a good-natured female of the company
interpoſed, and quelled their animoſity. By the mediation of this fair one,
the diſpute ended very faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, in a bet of a dozen of claret to be
drank there by the company then preſent, whenever the wager ſhould be
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided. There was ſomething ſo extraordinary in their whole evening's
converſation, ſuch an odd mixture of the town and univerſity, that I am
perſuaded, if Sir <hi>Richard</hi> had been witneſs to it, he could have
wrought it into a ſcene as lively and entertaining as any he has left us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:1252700301:69"/>THE whole time theſe lettered beaux remain
in <hi>London</hi> is ſpent in a continual round of diverſion. Their
ſphere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is ſomewhat confined, for they generally eat, drink, and
ſleep within the precincts of <hi>Covent-Garden</hi>; where after having
paſſed a day or two in the higheſt ſcenes of luxury and debauch, they
return (as <hi>Bookwit</hi> has it) to ſmall beer and three-half-penny
commons.</p>
               <p>I SHALL enlarge no further on this ſubject at preſent, but
conclude theſe reflexions with an ode which I have received from an unknown
correſpondent, who tells me it was lately ſent to one of theſe gentlemen,
(who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned himſelf wholly to theſe polite enjoyments, and
ſeemed to have forgot all his connexions with the univerſity) from an
academical friend. All who peruſe this elegant little piece will, I doubt
not, thank me for inſerting it, and the learned reader will have the
additional pleaſure of admiring it as a pleaſant and humourous imitation of
<hi>Horace.</hi>

                     <p>BESIDES the common objections made to the late Marriage-Bill,
my own family furniſhes me with a peculiar inſtance of the inconveniences
ariſing from it, which (though I dare ſay many others have experienc'd) has
not yet been taken notice of. You muſt know, Sir, that I have two daughters,
and it has ever been my greateſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern <pb n="66" facs="tcp:1252700301:71"/> to ſee them
well ſettled. They have had ſeveral very advantageous offers, which I
ſhould have been very well pleaſed with, and would have come down very
handſomely; but they always put me off with ſaying, that indeed they could
not think of leaving their dear papa, that they ſhould never be ſo happy
with huſbands, as with each other,—and twenty excuſes of the like
nature. But the caſe is now quite altered: and ſince the clamour about the
above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Act they are frighted out of their wits, leſt they ſhould
get no huſbands at all. My eldeſt girl has juſt taken it into her head to
be in love; and ſhe is very uneaſy that I am againſt her having an idle
young fellow, who is not worth a penny, and whom till lately ſhe uſed to
look upon with contempt. As to poor <hi>Betſy,</hi> my youngeſt girl, ſhe
has taken to the trick of eating chalk, oatmeal, and the like kind of traſh,
which young girls are apt to grow fond of, when their thoughts are turned upon
an huſband. I don't chuſe to ſpeak to them myſelf on this head; but as
the girls read your paper, I take this method of informing them that the
Marriage-Bill does not at all affect them, as they may depend on my not making
an ill uſe of my authority.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>URNING over the laſt volume of Lord <hi>Bolinbroke</hi>'s
works a few days ago, I could not help ſmiling at his extraordinary man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of commenting on ſome parts of the Scriptures. Among the reſt he
repreſents <hi>Moſes</hi> as making beaſts accountable to the community
for crimes as well as men: whence his lordſhip infers, that the Jewiſh
Legiſlator ſuppoſed them capable of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between right and
wrong, and acting as moral agents. The oddity of this remark led me to reflect,
that if ſuch an opinion ſhould prevail in any country, what whimſical
laws would be enacted, and how ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous they would appear when put in
execution: as if <pb n="68" facs="tcp:1252700301:73"/> the horſe that carried the highwayman
ſhould be ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned for taking a purſe, or a dog indicted for
feloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly ſtealing a ſhoulder of mutton. Such a country would ſeem
to go upon the ſame principles, and to entertain the ſame notions of
juſtice, as the puritannical old woman that hanged her cat for killing mice
on the ſabbath-day.</p>
               <p>THESE reflections were continued afterwards in my ſleep; when
methought that ſuch proceedings were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in our own courts of judicature.
I imagined my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a ſpacious hall like the <hi>Old Bailey,</hi> where
they were preparing to try ſeveral animals, who had been guilty of offences
againſt the laws of the land. The walls I obſerved were hung all round with
bulls-hides, ſheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkins, foxes tails, and the ſpoils of other brute
malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and over the juſtice-ſeat, where the <hi>King's-Arms</hi> are
commonly placed, there was fixed a large ſtag's head, which overſhadowed
the magiſtrate with it's branching horns. I took particular notice that the
galleries were very much crouded with ladies; which I could not tell how to
account for, 'till I found it was expected that a Goat would be that day tried
for a rape.</p>
               <p>THE ſeſſions ſoon opened; and the firſt priſoner
that was brought to the bar was a Hog, who was proſecuted at the ſuit of
the Jews on an indictment for burglary, in break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into their ſynagogue. As
it was apprehended that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion might be affected by this cauſe, and as the
proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appeared to be malicious, though the fact was plainly proved
againſt him, the Hog, to the great joy of all true chriſtians was allowed
<hi>benefit of clergy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AN indictment was next brought againſt a Cat for killing a
favourite Canary-bird. This offender belonged to an old <pb n="69" facs="tcp:1252700301:74"/>
woman, who was believed by the neighbourhood to be a witch. The jury therefore
were unanimous in their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that ſhe was the devil in that ſhape, and
brought her in guilty. Upon which the judge formally pronounced ſentence upon
her, which I remember concluded with theſe words: 
<q rend="inline">"you muſt be carried to the place of
exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, where you are to be hanged by the neck nine times, 'till you are
dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead; and the fidlers have
mercy upon your guts."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A PARROT was next tried for <hi>Scandalum Magnatum.</hi> He was
accuſed by the Chief magiſtrate of the city, and the whole court of
Aldermen, for defaming them as they paſſed along the ſtreet on a public
feſtival, by ſinging 
<q rend="inline">"Room for cuckolds, here comes a great company;
room for cuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olds here comes my Lord Mayor."</q> This PARROT was a very old
offender, much addicted to ſcurrility, and had been ſeveral times convicted
of prophane curſing and ſwearing. He had even the impudence to abuſe the
whole court by calling the Jury rogues and raſcals, and frequently
interrupted my Lord Judge in ſumming up the evidence by crying out, Old
Bitch. The court however were pleaſed to ſhew mercy to him upon the
petition of his miſtreſs, a ſtrict methodiſt, who gave bail for his
good behaviour, and delivered him to Mr. <hi>Whitefield,</hi> who undertook to
make a thorough convert of him.</p>
               <p>AFTER this a Fox was indicted for robbing an hen-rooſt. Many
farmers appeared againſt him, who depoſed that he was a very notorious
thief, and had long been the terror of ducks, geeſe, turkies and all other
poultry. He had infeſted the country long time and had often been purſued,
but they could never take him before. As the Evidence was very 
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1252700301:75"/> full againſt him, the jury readily brought him in
guilty; and the judge was proceeding to condemn him, when the ſly villain
watering his bruſh flirted it in the Face of the jai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, and made off. Upon
this a country 'ſquire who was preſent, hollowed out <hi>ſtole away,</hi>
and a hue and cry was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſent after him.</p>
               <p>WHEN the uproar which this occaſioned was over, a MILCH-ASS
was brought to the bar, and tried for contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liouſly braying, as ſhe
ſtood at the door of a ſick lady of quality. It appeared that this lady was
terribly afflicted with the vapours, and could not bear the leaſt noiſe;
had the knocker always tyed up, and ſtraw laid in the ſtreet.
Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding which this audacious creature uſed every morning to give
her foul language, which broke her reſt, and flung her into hyſterics. For
this repeated abuſe the criminal was ſentenced to the pillory, and ordered
to loſe her ears.</p>
               <p>AN information was next laid againſt a Shepherd's DOG upon the
GAME-ACT for poaching. He was accuſed of killing an hare without being
properly qualified. But the plaintiff thought it adviſeable to quaſh the
indictment, as the owner of the dog had a vote to ſell at the next
election.</p>
               <p>THERE now came on a very important cauſe, in which ſix of
the moſt eminent council learned in the law were retained on each ſide. A
MONKEY, belonging to a lady of the firſt rank and faſhion, was indicted,
for that he with malice prepenſe did commit wilful murder on the body of a
lap-dog. The council for the proſecutor ſet forth, that the unfortunate
deceaſed came on a viſit with another lady; when the Priſoner at the bar,
without the leaſt provocation, and contrary to the laws of hoſpitality,
perpetrated this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1252700301:76"/> fact. The council for the
priſoner being called upon to make the MONKEY's defence, pleaded his
privilege, and inſiſted on his being tried by his peers. This plea was
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted without demurr, and a jury of beaux was immediately impannelled, who
without going out of court honourably acquitted him.</p>
               <p>THE proceedings were here interrupted by a HOUND, who came
jumping into the Hall, and running to the Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice-Seat lifted up his leg
againſt the Judge's robe. For this contemptuous behaviour he was directly
ordered into cuſtody, when to our great ſurprize he caſt his ſkin, and
became an OSTRICH; and preſently after ſhed his feathers, and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied us
in the figure of a BEAR. Then he was a LION, then an HORSE, then again a
BABOON; and after many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other amazing transformations leaped out an HARLEQUIN,
and before they could take hold of him ſkipped away to
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent-Garden</hi> theatre.</p>
               <p>IT would be tedious to recount the particulars of ſeveral
other trials. A ſportſman brought an action againſt a RACE-HORSE for
running on the wrong ſide of the poſt, by which he loſt the
<hi>Plate</hi> and many conſiderable betts. For this the criminal was
ſentenced to be burnt in the forehand, and to be whipt at the Cart's tail. A
Mare would have undergone the ſame puniſhment for throwing her rider in a
Stag-hunt, but eſcaped by pleading her belly; upon which a jury of grooms was
impannelled, who brought her in quick. The company of DOGS and MONKEYS together
with the DAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CING BEARS, who were taken up on the LICENSE-ACT, and indicted for
Strollers, were tranſported for life.</p>
               <p>THE laſt trial was for high treaſon. A LION, who had been
long confined as a State-priſoner in the TOWER, having <pb n="72" facs="tcp:1252700301:77"/>
broke goal, had appeared in open rebellion, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſeveral acts of
violence on his MAJESTY's liege-ſubjects. As this was a noble animal, and a
prince of the blood in his own native country, he was condemned to be beheaded.
It came into my thoughts, that this LION's HEAD might vie with that famous one
formerly erected at <hi>Button</hi>'s for the ſervice of the GUARDIAN: I was
accordingly going to peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for leave to ſet it up in <hi>Macklin</hi>'s
new Coffee-houſe; when methought the Lion, ſetting up a moſt horrible
roar, broke his chains and put the whole court to flight; and I awaked in the
utmoſt conſternation, juſt as I imagined he had got me in his gripe.</p>

inſtructed to liſp out the names of the favourite chiefs of each fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
and I have more than once been in danger of being knocked off my horſe, as I
rode peaceably on, becauſe I did not declare with which party I ſided,
though I knew nothing at all of either. Every petty village abounds with the
moſt profound ſtateſmen: it is common to ſee our ruſtic politicians
aſſembling after ſermon, and ſettling the good of their country
acroſs a tomb-ſtone, like ſo many <hi>Dictators from the plough</hi>; and
every cottage can boaſt its patriot, who, like the old <hi>Roman,</hi> would
not exchange his turnip for a bribe.</p>
                     <p>I AM at preſent in —, where the election is juſt
coming on, and the whole town conſequently in an uproar. They have for
ſeveral parliaments returned two members, who recommended themſelves by
conſtantly oppoſing the court: but there came down a few days ago a banker
from <hi>London,</hi> who has offered himſelf a candidate, and is backed with
the moſt powerful of all intereſts, money. Nothing has been ſince thought
of but feaſting and revell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and both parties ſtrive to outdo each other
in the frequency and expence of their entertainments. This indeed is the
general method made uſe of to gain the favour of electors, and manifeſt a
zeal for the conſtitution. I have known a candidate depend more upon the
ſtrength of his liquor than his arguments; and the merits of a treat has
often recommended a member, who has had no merits of his own; for it is
certain, that people, however they may differ in other points, are unanimous in
promoting the grand buſineſs of eating and drinking.</p>
                     <p>IT is impoſſible to give a particular account of the
various diſorders occaſioned by the conteſt in this town. The 
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1252700301:80"/> ſtreets ring with the different cry of each party, and
every hour produces a ballad, a ſet of queries, or a ſerious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to
the worthy electors. I have ſeen the Mayor with half the Corporation roaring,
hollowing, and reeling along the ſtreets, and yet threatening to clap a poor
fellow in the ſtocks for making the ſame noiſe, only becauſe he would
not vote as they do. It is no wonder that the ſtrongeſt connexions ſhould
be broken, and the moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friends ſet at variance, through their
difference of opinion. Not only the men, but their wives alſo are engaged in
the ſame quarrel. Mr. <hi>Staunch</hi> the haberdaſher uſed to ſmoke
his pipe conſtantly in the ſame kitchen-corner every evening at the ſame
alehouſe with his neighbour Mr. <hi>Veer</hi> the chandler, while their
ladies chatted together at the ſtreet-door: but now the huſbands never
ſpeak to each other; and conſequently Mrs. <hi>Veer</hi> goes a quarter of
a mile for her inkle and tape, rather than deal at Mr. <hi>Staunch</hi>'s
ſhop; and Mrs. <hi>Staunch</hi> declares, ſhe would go without her tea,
though ſhe has always been uſed to it twice a day, rather than fetch her
half quartern from that turn-coat <hi>Veer</hi>'s.</p>
                     <p>WHEREVER Politics are introduc'd, Religion is always drawn
into the quarrel. The town I have been ſpeaking of is divided into two
parties, who are diſtinguiſh'd by the appellation of <hi>Chriſtians</hi>
and <hi>Jews.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> it ſeems, are thoſe, who are in the
intereſt of a nobleman who gave his vote for paſſing the
<hi>Jew</hi>-bill, and are held in abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by the <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
The zeal of the latter is ſtill further inflamed by the vicar, who every
ſunday thunders out his anathemas, and preaches up the pious doctrine of
perſecution. In this he is ſeconded by the clerk, who is careful to enforce
the arguments from the pulpit by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting ſtaves proper for the
occaſion.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="tcp:1252700301:81"/>THIS truly <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſpirit
is no where more manifeſt than at their public feaſts. I was at one of
their dinners, where I found great variety of pig-meat was provided. The table
was covered from one end to the other with hams, legs of pork, ſpare-ribs,
griſkins, haſlets, feet and ears, brawn, and the like: in the middle there
ſmoaked a large barbicued hog, which was ſoon devour'd to the bone; ſo
deſirous was every one to prove his <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> by the quantity
he could ſwallow of that <hi>Anti-Judaic</hi> food. After dinner there was
brought in, by way of deſert, a diſh of hogs puddings; but as I have a
diſlike to that kind of diet, (though not from any ſcruple of
conſcience,) I was regarded as little better than a <hi>Jew</hi> for
declining to eat of them.</p>
                     <p>THE great ſupport of this party is an old neighbouring
knight; who, ever ſince the late naturalization-act, has conceived a violent
antipathy to the <hi>Jews,</hi> and takes every opportunity of railing at the
above-mentioned nobleman. Sir <hi>Rowland</hi> ſwears that his lordſhip is
worſe than <hi>Judas,</hi> that he is actually circumciſed, and that the
chapel in this nobleman's houſe is turned into a ſynagogue. The knight had
never been ſeen in a church, 'till the late clamour about the
<hi>Jew</hi>-bill; but he now attends it regularly every ſunday, where he
devoutly takes his nap all the ſervice; and he lately beſtowed the beſt
living in his gift, which he had before promiſed to his chaplain, on one whom
he had never ſeen, but had read his name in the title-page to a ſermon
againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> He turned off his butler, who had lived with him
many years, and whoſe only crime was a ſwarthy complexion, becauſe the
dog looked like a <hi>Jew.</hi> He feeds hogs in his park and the court-yard,
and has Guinea-pigs in his parlour. Every ſaturday he has an hunt, becauſe
it is the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> ſubbath; and in the evening he 
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1252700301:82"/> is ſure to get drunk with the vicar in defence of
religion. As he is in the commiſſion, he ordered a poor <hi>Jew</hi>
pedlar, who came to hawk goods at his houſe, to <hi>Bridewell</hi>; and he
was once going to ſend a little pariſh-boy to the ſame place, for
preſuming to play in his worſhip's hearing on that unchriſtian-like
inſtrument the <hi>Jews-Harp.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE fair ſex here are no leſs ambitious of diſplaying
their affection for the ſame cauſe, and they manifeſt their ſentiments
by the colour and faſhion of their dreſs. Their zeal more particularly
ſhews itſelf in a variety of poſies for rings, buckles, knots, and
garters. I obſerved the other night at the aſſembly, that the ladies
ſeemed to vie with each other in hanging out the enſigns of their faith in
orthodox ribbands, bearing the inſcription of NO JEWS, CHRISTIANITY FOR EVER.
They likewiſe wore little croſſes at their breaſts; their
<hi>pompons</hi> were formed into crucifixes, their knots diſpoſed in the
ſame angles, and ſo many parts of their habits moulded into that ſhape,
that the whole aſſembly looked like the court on St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s day.
It was remarkable that the vicar's lady, who is a thorough-paced
High-Churchwoman, was more religious in the decorations of her dreſs than any
of the company: in a word, ſhe was ſo ſtuck over from head to foot with
croſſes, that a wag juſtly compared her to an old <hi>Popiſh</hi>
tomb-ſtone in a <hi>Gothic</hi> cathedral.</p>
                     <p>I SHALL now conclude my letter with the relation of an
adventure, that happened to myſelf at my firſt coming into this town. I
intended to put up at the <hi>Catherine-Wheel,</hi> as I had often uſed the
houſe before, and knew the landlord to be a good civil kind of fellow. I
accordingly turned my horſe into the yard, when to my great ſurprize the
landlord, as ſoon as he ſaw me, gave me an hearty <pb n="78" facs="tcp:1252700301:83"/>
curſe, and told me I might go about my buſineſs, 
<q rend="inline">"for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he would not entertain any ſuch
raſcals."</q> Upon this he ſaid ſomething to two or three ſtrapping
country-fellows, who immediately came towards me, and if I had not rode away
directly, I ſhould have met with a very rough ſalutation from their
horſe-whips. I could not ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine what offence I had commited, that could
give occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for ſuch ill uſage, 'till I heard the maſter of the inn
hollowing after me 
<q rend="inline">"that's the ſcoundrel that came here ſome
time ago with <hi>Tom T'otherſide</hi>;"</q> who, I have ſince learnt, is
an agent for the other party.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the ladies are naturally become the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate objects of
your care, will you permit a complaint to be inſerted in your paper, which is
founded upon a matter of fact? They will pardon me, if by laying before you a
particular inſtance I was lately witneſs to of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper behaviour, I
endeavour to expoſe a reigning evil which ſubjects them to many ſhameful
imputations.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="tcp:1252700301:85"/>I RECEIVED laſt week a dinner-card from
a friend, with an intimation that I ſhould meet ſome very agreeable ladies.
At my arrival I found that the company conſiſted chiefly of females, who
indeed did me the honour to riſe, but quite diſconcerted me in paying my
reſpects by their whiſpering each other and appearing to ſtifle a laugh.
When I was ſeated, the ladies grouped themſelves up in a corner, and
entered into a private cabal, ſeemingly to diſcourſe upon points of great
ſecreſy and importance, but of equal merriment and diverſion.</p>
                     <p>THE ſame conduct of keeping cloſe to their ranks was
obſerved at table, where the ladies ſeated themſelves together. Their
converſation was here alſo confined wholly to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſeemed
like the myſteries of the <hi>Bona Dea,</hi> in which men were forbidden to
have any ſhare. It was a continued laugh and a whiſper from the beginning
to the end of dinner. A whole ſentence was ſcarce ever ſpoken aloud.
Single words indeed now and then broke forth; ſuch as <hi>odious, horrible,
deteſtable, ſhocking,</hi> HUMBUG. This laſt new-coined expreſſion,
which is only to be found in the nonſenſical vocabulary, ſounds abſurd
and diſagreeable when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is pronounced; but from the mouth of a lady it
is 
<q rend="inline">"ſhocking, deteſtable, horrible, and
odious."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>MY friend ſeemed to be but in an uneaſy ſituation at his
own table: but I was far more miſerable. I was mute, and ſeldom dared to
lift up my eyes from my plate, or turn my head to call for ſmall beer, leſt
by ſome aukward poſture I might draw upon me a whiſper or a laugh.
<hi>Sancho,</hi> when he was forbid to eat of a delicious banquet ſet before
him, could ſcarce appear more melancholy. The rueful length of my face might
poſſibly encreaſe the mirth of my tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors: at leaſt their joy
ſeemed to riſe in exact proportion with <pb n="81" facs="tcp:1252700301:86"/> my miſery.
At length, however, the time of my delivery approached. Dinner ended, the
ladies made their exits in pairs, and went off hand in hand, whiſpering like
the two Kings of <hi>Brentford.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>MODEST men, Mr. TOWN, are deeply wounded, when they imagine
themſelves the objects of ridicule or contempt; and the pain is the greater,
when it is given by thoſe whom they admire, and from whom they are ambitious
of receiving any marks of countenance and favour. Yet we muſt allow that
affronts are pardonable from ladies, as they are often prognoſtics of future
kindneſs. If a lady ſtrikes our cheek, we can very willingly follow the
precept of the Goſpel, and turn the other cheek to be ſmitten. Even a blow
from a fair hand conveys pleaſure:—but this battery of whiſpers is
againſt all legal rights of war;—poiſoned arrows, and ſtabs in the
dark, are not more repugnant to the general laws of humanity.</p>
                     <p>MODERN writers of comedy often introduce a pert wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling into
their pieces, who is very ſevere upon the reſt of the company; but all his
waggery is ſpoken <hi>aſide.</hi> Theſe giglers and whiſperers ſeem
to be acting the ſame part in company, that this arch rogue does in the play.
Every word or motion produces a train of whiſpers; the dropping of a
ſnuff-box, or ſpilling the tea, is ſure to be accompanied with a titter;
and upon the entrance of any one with ſomething particular in his perſon or
manner, I have ſeen a whole room in a buzz like a bee-hive.</p>
                     <p>THIS practiſe of whiſpering, if it is any where allowable,
may perhaps be indulged the fair ſex at church, where the converſation can
only be carried on by the ſecret ſymbols of a curtſy, an ogle, or a nod.
A whiſper in this place is very <pb n="82" facs="tcp:1252700301:87"/> often of great uſe, as
it ſerves to convey the moſt ſecret intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, which a lady would be
ready to burſt with, if ſhe could not find vent for it by this kind of
auricular confeſſion. A piece of ſcanda1 tranſpires in this manner from
one pew to another, then preſently whizzes along the chancel, from whence it
crawls up to the galleries, till at laſt the whole church hums with it.</p>
                     <p>IT were alſo to be wiſhed, that the ladies would be
pleaſed to confine themſelves to whiſpering in their <hi>tête
à tête</hi> conferences at an opera or the play-houſe; which
would be a proper deference to the reſt of the audience. In <hi>France,</hi>
we are told, it is common for the <hi>Parterre</hi> to join with the performers
in any favourite air; but we ſeem to have carried this cuſtom ſtill
further, as our boxes, without concerning themſelves in the leaſt with the
play, are even louder than the players. The wit and humour of a
<hi>Vanbrugh</hi> is frequently interrupted by a brilliant dialogue between two
perſons of faſhion; and a love-ſcene in the ſide-box has often been
more attended to than that on the ſtage. As to their loud burſts of
laughter at the theatre, they may very well be excuſed, when they are excited
by any lively ſtrokes in a comedy: but I have ſeen our ladies titter at the
moſt diſtreſsful ſcenes in <hi>Romeo</hi> and <hi>Juliet,</hi> grin
over the anguiſh of a <hi>Monimia</hi> or <hi>Belvidera,</hi> and fairly
laugh King <hi>Lear</hi> off the ſtage.</p>
                     <p>THUS the whole behaviour of theſe ladies is in direct
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to good manners. They laugh when they ſhould cry, are loud
when they ſhould be ſilent, and are ſilent when their converſation is
deſirable. If a man in a ſelect company was thus to laugh or whiſper me
out of countenance, I ſhould be apt to conſtrue it as an affront, and
demand an explanation. As to the ladies, I would deſire them to reflect how
much <pb n="83" facs="tcp:1252700301:88"/> they would ſuffer, if their own weapons were turned
againſt them, and the gentlemen ſhould attack them with the ſame arts of
laughing and whiſpering. But, however free they may be from our reſentment,
they are ſtill open to ill-natured ſuſpicions. They do not conſider,
what ſtrange conſtructions may be put on theſe laughs and whiſpers. It
were, indeed, of little conſequence, if we only imagined that they were
taking the reputations of their acquaintance to pieces, or abuſing the
company round; but when they indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in this behaviour, ſome
perhaps may be led to conclude, that they are diſcourſing upon topics,
which they are afraid or aſhamed to ſpeak of in a leſs private
manner.</p>
                     <p>IF the miſconduct which I have deſcribed had been only to
be found, Mr. TOWN, at my friend's table, I ſhould not have troubled you with
this letter: but the ſame kind of ill-breeding prevails too often and in too
many places. The giglers and the whiſperers are innumerable; they beſet us
wherever we go; and it is obſervable, that after a ſhort murmur of
whiſpers out comes the burſt of laughter:—like a gun-powder
ſerpent, which, after hiſſing about for ſome time, goes off in a
bounce.</p>
                     <p>SOME excuſe may perhaps be framed for this ill-timed
merriment in the fair ſex. <hi>Venus,</hi> the goddeſs of beauty, is
frequently called the <hi>laughter-loving dame</hi>; and by laughing our modern
ladies may poſſibly imagine, that they render themſelves like
<hi>Venus.</hi> I have indeed remarked, that the ladies commonly adjuſt their
laugh to their perſons, and are merry in proportion as it ſets off their
particular charms. One lady is never further moved than to a ſmile or a
ſimper, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe nothing elſe ſhows her dimples to ſo much advantage;
another, who has a very fine ſet of teeth, runs into the broad grin; while a
third, who is admired for a well-turned <pb n="84" facs="tcp:1252700301:89"/> neck and graceful
cheſt, calls up all her beauties to view by breaking out in violent and
repeated peals of laughter.</p>
                     <p>I WOULD not be underſtood to impoſe gravity or too great a
reſerve on the fair ſex. Let them laugh at a feather, but let them declare
openly that it is a feather which occaſions their mirth. I muſt confeſs,
that laughter becomes the young, the gay, and the handſome: but a whiſper
is unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming at all ages and in both ſexes; nor ought it ever to be
practiſed, except in the round gallery at St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s, or in the
famous whiſpering place in <hi>Glouceſter</hi> cathedral, where two
whiſperers hear each other at the diſtance of five and twenty yards.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> FRIEND of mine who belongs to the Stamp-Office acquaints me,
that the revenue ariſing from the duty on cards and dice continues to
increaſe every year, and that it now brings in near ſix times more than it
did at firſt. This will not appear very wonderful, when we conſider that
gaming is now become rather the buſineſs than amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our perſons
of quality; that their whole attention is employed in this important article,
and that they are more concerned about the tranſactions of the two clubs at
<hi>White</hi>'s than the proceedings of both Houſes of Parliament. Thus it
happens that eſtates are now almoſt as frequently made over by whiſt and
hazard as by deeds and ſettlements; and <pb n="86" facs="tcp:1252700301:91"/> the chariots of
many of our nobility may be ſaid (like Count <hi>Baſſet</hi>'s in the
play) 
<q rend="inline">"to roll upon the four aces."</q>
               </p>
               <p>THIS love of gaming has taken ſuch entire poſſeſſion
of their ideas, that it infects their common converſation. The management of
a diſpute was formerly attempted by reaſon and argument; but the new way of
adjuſting all difference in opinion is by the ſword or a wager: ſo that
the only gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel method of diſſent is to riſk a thouſand pounds, or
take your chance of being run through the body. The ſtrange cuſtom of
deciding every thing by a wager is ſo univerſal, that if (in imitation of
<hi>Swift)</hi> any body was to publiſh a ſpecimen of <hi>Polite
Converſation,</hi> inſtead of old ſayings and trite repar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees he would
in all probability fill his dialogues with little more than bet after bet, or
now and then a calculation of the odds.</p>
               <p>WHITE's, the preſent grand ſcene of theſe tranſactions
was formerly diſtinguiſhed by gallantry and intrigue. During the
publication of the <hi>Tatler,</hi> Sir <hi>Richard Steel</hi> thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
to date all his love-news from that quarter: but it would now be as abſurd to
pretend to gather any ſuch intelligence from <hi>White</hi>'s; as to ſend
to <hi>Batſon</hi>'s for a lawyer, or to the <hi>Roll</hi>'s Coffee-houſe
for a man-midwife.</p>
               <p>THE gentlemen who now frequent this place profeſs a kind of
univerſal Scepticiſm; and as they look upon every thing as dubious, put the
iſſue upon a wager. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing however trivial or ridiculous, which
is not capable of producing a bet. Many pounds have been loſt upon the colour
of a coach-horſe, an article in the news, or the change of the weather. The
birth of a child has brought great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to perſons not in the leaſt
related to the family it was born in; and the breaking off a match has affected
many in their fortunes, beſides the parties immediately concerned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:1252700301:92"/>BUT the moſt extraordinary part of this
faſhionable practice is what in the gaming dialect is called, <hi>pitting one
man againſt another</hi>; that is, in plain Engliſh, wagering which of the
two will live longeſt. In this manner people of the moſt oppoſite
characters make up the ſubject of a bet. A player perhaps is pitted againſt
a duke, an alderman againſt a biſhop, or a pimp with a privy-counſellor.
There is ſcarce one remarkable perſon, upon whoſe life there are not many
thouſand pounds depending, or one perſon of quality whoſe death will not
leave ſeveral of theſe kinds of mortgages upon his eſtate. The various
changes in the health of one, who is the ſubject of many bets, occaſions
very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reflections in thoſe who have ventured large ſums on his
life and death. Thoſe who would be gainers by his deceaſe, upon every
flight indiſpoſition, watch all the ſtages of his illneſs, and are as
impatient for his death, as the undertaker who expects to have the care of his
funeral; while the other ſide are very ſollicitous about his recovery,
ſend every hour to know how he does, and take as much care of him, as a
clergyman's wife does of her huſband who has no other fortune than his
living. I remember a man with the conſtitution of a porter, upon whoſe life
very great odds were laid; but when the perſon he was pitted againſt was
expected to dye every week, this man unexpectedly ſhot himſelf through the
head, and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ones were taken in.</p>
               <p>THOUGH moſt of our follies are imported from <hi>France,</hi>
this has had its riſe and progreſs entirely in <hi>England.</hi> In the
laſt illneſs of <hi>Louis</hi> the fourteenth Lord <hi>Stair</hi> laid a
wager on his death; and we may gueſs what the <hi>French</hi> thought of it,
from the manner in which <hi>Voltaire</hi> mentions it in his <hi>Siécle
de Louis</hi> xiv. 
<q rend="inline">"Le Roi fut attaquè vers le milieu 
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1252700301:93"/> mois d'Août. Le Comte de Stair Ambaſſadeur
d'Angle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terre PARIA, <hi>ſelon le genie de ſa nation,</hi> que le Roi ne
paſſeroit pas le mois de Septembre."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"The King, ſays he, was taken ill about the
middle of Auguſt; when Lord <hi>Stair,</hi> the ambaſſador from
<hi>England</hi> BETTED, <hi>according to the genius of his nation,</hi> that
the King would not live beyond September.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I AM in ſome pain leſt this cuſtom ſhould get among the
ladies. They are at preſent very deep in cards and dice; and while my lord is
gaming abroad, her ladyſhip has her rout at home. I am inclined to
ſuſpect that our women of faſhion will alſo learn to divert
themſelves with this polite practice of laying wagers. A birthday ſuit, the
age of a beauty, who invented a particular faſhion, or who were ſuppos'd to
be together at the laſt maſquerade, would frequently give occaſion for
bets. This would alſo afford them a new method for the ready propagation of
ſcandal, as the truth of ſeveral ſtories which are continually flying
about the town would naturally be brought to the ſame teſt. Should they
proceed further to ſtake the lives of their acquaintance againſt each
other, they would doubtleſs bet with the ſame fearleſs ſpirit as they
are known to do at brag: one huſband perhaps would be pitted againſt
another, or a woman of the town againſt a maid of honour. In a word, if this
once becomes faſhionable among the ladies, we ſhall ſoon ſee the time,
when an allowance for <hi>bet-money</hi> will be ſtipulated in the Marriage
Articles.</p>
               <p>AS the vices and follies of perſons of diſtinction are very
apt to ſpread, I am much afraid leſt this branch of gaming ſhould
deſcend to the common people. Indeed it ſeems already to have got among
them. We have frequent <pb n="89" facs="tcp:1252700301:94"/> accounts in the daily papers of
tradeſmen riding, walking, eating and drinking for a wager. The conteſted
election in the city has occaſioned ſeveral extraordinary bets: I know a
butcher in <hi>Leadenball</hi> market, who laid an ox to a ſhin of beef on
the ſucceſs of Sir <hi>John Barnard</hi> againſt the field; and have been
told of a Publican in <hi>Thames</hi> ſtreet, who ventured an hogſhead of
intire butt on the candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date who ſerves him with beer.</p>
               <p>WE may obſerve that the ſpirit of gaming diſplays itſelf
with as much variety among the loweſt as the higheſt order of people. It is
the ſame thing, whether the dice rattle in an orange barrow or at the Hazard
table. A couple of chairmen in a night-cellar are as eager at put or all-fours,
as a party at St. <hi>James</hi>'s at a rubber of whiſt; and the E. O. table
is but an higher ſort of <hi>Merry-go-round,</hi> where you may get ſix
halfpence for one, ſix pence for one, and ſix twopences for one. If the
practiſe of pitting ſhould be alſo propagated among the vulgar, it will
be common for prize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fighters to ſtake their lives againſt each other, and
two pickpockets may lay which of them ſhall firſt go to the gallows.</p>
               <p>TO give the reader a full idea of one wholly employed in this
manner, I ſhall conclude my paper with the character <hi>Montano.
Montano</hi> was born heir to a nobleman remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for deep play, from whom
he very early imbibed the principles of gaming. When he was at ſchool, he was
the moſt expert of any of his playfellows at taw, and would often ſtrip
them of their whole week's allowance at chuck. He was afterwards at the head of
every match at football or cricket; and when he was captain he made a lottery,
but went away without drawing the prizes. He is ſtill <pb n="90" facs="tcp:1252700301:95"/>
talked of at the ſchool for a famous diſpute he had with another of his own
caſt about their ſuperiority in learning; which they decided by toſſing
up heads or tails who was the beſt ſcholar. Being too great a genius for
our univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at home, he was ſent abroad on his travels, but never got
further than <hi>Paris</hi>; where having loſt a conſiderable bet of four
to one concerning the taking a town in <hi>Flanders,</hi> he was obliged to
come back with a few guineas he bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed to bring him over. Here he ſoon
became univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally known by frequenting every gaming-table and attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every horſe-race in the kingdom. He firſt reduced betting into an art, and
made <hi>White</hi>'s the grand market for wagers. He is at length ſuch an
adept in this art, that whatever turn things take, he can never loſe: this he
has effected by what he has taught the world to call <hi>hedging a bet.</hi>
There is ſcarce an election in the kingdom which will not end to his
advantage; and he has lately ſent over commiſſions to <hi>Paris</hi> to
take up bets on the recall of the parliament. He was the firſt that ſtruck
out the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned practice of pitting, in which he is ſo thoroughly
verſed, that the death of every perſon of quality may be ſaid to bring
him a legacy; and he has ſo contrived the bets on his own life, that, live or
die, the odds are in his favour.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OUR laſt week's paper on the ſubject of Bets put me in
mind of an extract I lately met with in ſome news papers, from the "Life of
Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth, written by Mr. <hi>Farnworth.</hi>" The
paſſage is as follows.</p>
                     <q>IT was reported in <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Drake</hi> had
taken and plundered St. <hi>Domingo</hi> in <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and carried
off an immenſe booty. This account came in a private letter to <hi>Paul
Secchi,</hi> a very conſiderable merchant in the city, who had large concerns
in thoſe parts, which he had inſured. Upon receiving this news, he ſent
for the inſurer <hi>Samſon</hi> 
                        <pb n="92" facs="tcp:1252700301:97"/> 
                        <hi>Ceneda,</hi> a
Jew, and acquainted him with it. The Jew, whoſe intereſt it was to have
ſuch a report thought falſe, gave many reaſons why it could not
poſſibly be true; and at laſt worked himſelf up into ſuch a
paſſion, that he ſaid I'll lay you a pound of my fleſh it is a lye.
<hi>Secchi,</hi> who was of a fiery hot temper, replied, I'll lay you a
thouſand crowns againſt a pound of your fleſh, that it is true. The Jew
accepted the wager, and articles were immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted betwixt them, That
if <hi>Secchi</hi> won, he ſhould him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf cut the fleſh with a ſharp
knife from whatever part of the Jew's body he pleaſed. The truth of the
account was ſoon confirmed; and the Jew was almoſt diſtracted when he was
informed that <hi>Secchi</hi> had ſolemnly ſworn he would compel him to the
exact literal performance of his contract. A report of this tranſaction was
brought to the Pope, who ſent for the parties, and being informed of the
whole affair, ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"When contracts are made, it is juſt they
ſhould be fulfilled, as this ſhall. Take a knife therefore,
<hi>Secchi,</hi> and cut a pound of fleſh from any part you pleaſe of the
Jew's body. We adviſe you however to be very careful; for if you cut but a
ſcruple more or leſs than your due, you ſhall certainly be
hanged."</q>
                     </q>
                     <p>WHAT induced me to trouble you with this is a remark made by
the editor, 
<q rend="inline">"that the ſcene between <hi>Shylock</hi> and
<hi>Antonio</hi> in the <hi>Merchant of Venice</hi> is borrowed from this
ſtory."</q> I ſhould perhaps have acquieſced in this notion, if I had not
ſeen a note in the "Obſervations on <hi>Spenſer's Faerie Queene</hi>"
juſt publiſhed by Mr. <hi>T. Warton of Trinity College,</hi> where He has
plainly diſcovered the real ſource from which <hi>Shakeſpere</hi> drew
his fable, which He informs us is founded upon an ancient ballad. The admirers
of <hi>Shakeſpere</hi> are obliged to him for this curious diſcovery; but
as Mr. <hi>Warton</hi> has only given ſome extracts, they would undoubtedly
be glad to ſee the whole. This Ballad is moſt probably no where to be met
with, but in the <hi>Aſhmolean Muſaeum</hi> in this Univerſity, where it
is preſerved by that famous Antiquary <hi>Anthony à Wood:</hi> I have
therefore ſent you a faithful tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript <pb n="93" facs="tcp:1252700301:98"/> of it; and
you will agree with me that it will do you more credit, as a CONNOISSEUR, to
draw this hidden trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure into light, than if you had diſcovered an
<hi>Otho</hi> or a <hi>Niger.</hi>

                     <p>IT will be proper to ſubjoin what the ingenious Mr.
<hi>Warton</hi> has obſerved upon this ſubject.— 
<q rend="inline">'It may be objected, ſays he, that this
ballad might have been <pb n="95" facs="tcp:1252700301:100"/> written after, and copied from,
<hi>Shakeſpere</hi>'s play. But if that had been the caſe, it is moſt
likely, that the author would have preſerved <hi>Shakeſpere</hi>'s name of
<hi>Shylock</hi> for the Jew; and nothing is more likely, than that
<hi>Shakeſpere</hi> in copying from this ballad, ſhould alter the name from
<hi>Gernu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus</hi> to one more Jewiſh. Another argument is, that our ballad
has the air of a narrative written before <hi>Shakeſpere</hi>'s play; I mean,
that, if it had been written after the play, it would have been much more full
and circumſtantial: At preſent, it has too much the nakedneſs of an
original.'</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>IT would indeed be abſurd to think that this ballad was
taken from <hi>Shakeſpere</hi>'s play, as they differ in the moſt
eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial circumſtances. The ſum borrowed is in the former three
thouſand ducats, in the latter an hundred crowns: the time limited for
payment in the one is only three months, in the other a year and a day: In the
play the merchant's motive for borrowing, (which is finely imagined by
<hi>Shakeſpere,</hi> and is conducive to the general plot,) is not on account
of his own neceſſities, but for the ſervice of his friend. To th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                           <desc>•…</desc>
                        </gap> we may add, that the cloſe of the ſtory is finely
height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by <hi>Shakeſpere.</hi> A mere copyiſt, ſuch as we may
ſuppoſe a balladmonger, would not have given himſelf the trouble to alter
circumſtances: at leaſt he would not have changed them ſo much for the
worſe. But this matter ſeems to be placed out of all doubt by the firſt
ſtanza of the ballad, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us that the ſtory was taken from
ſome Italian novel. 
<q rend="inline">'Thus much therefore is certain, (as Mr.
<hi>Warton</hi> obſerves) that <hi>Shakeſpere</hi> either copied from that
Italian novel, or from this ballad: Now we have no tranſlation, I preſume,
of ſuch a novel into Engliſh; if then it be granted that
<hi>Shakeſpere</hi> generally took his Italian ſtories from their
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh tranſlations, and that the arguments above, concerning the prior
antiquity of this ballad are true, it will follow that <hi>Shakeſpere</hi>
copied from this ballad.'</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>UPON the whole it is very likely that the <hi>Italian</hi>
novel, upon which this ballad ſeems founded, took its riſe (with an 
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1252700301:101"/> inverſion of the circumſtances) from the
abovementioned ſtory in "The Life of Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> the Fifth," the
memory of which muſt have been then recent. I ſhould be glad if any of your
readers can give any further light into this affair, and, if poſſible,
acquaint the Public, from whence <hi>Shakeſpere</hi> borrowed the other part
of his fable concerning <hi>Portia and the Caſkets</hi>; which it is more
than probable is drawn from ſome other novel well known in his time.</p>
                     <p>I CANNOT conclude without remarking with what art and judgment
<hi>Shakeſpere</hi> have wove together theſe different ſtories of the
<hi>Jew,</hi> and the <hi>Caſkets</hi>; from both which he has form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one
general fable, without having recourſe to the ſtale artifice of eking out a
barren ſubject with impertinent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derplots.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HOUGH many hiſtorians have deſcribed the City of
<hi>London</hi> (in which we may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>) with great
accuracy, yet they have not ſet it out in the full light, which at preſent
it deſerves. They have not diſtinguiſhed it as an Univerſity.
<hi>Paris</hi> is an Univerſity, <hi>Dublin</hi> is an Univerſity, even
<hi>Moſcow</hi> is an Univerſity. But <hi>London</hi> has not yet been
honoured with that Title. I will allow our Metropolis to have been intended
originally, only as a City of Trade, and I will farther own that ſcarce any
Sciences, except ſuch as were purely mercantile, were cultivated in it 'till
within theſe laſt thirty years; but from <pb n="98" facs="tcp:1252700301:103"/> period of
time, I may ſay an whole army, as it were, of Arts and Sciences have marched
amicably in upon us, and have fixed themſelves as auxiliaries to our
Capitol.</p>
                     <p>THE four greater faculties, I mean Theology, Law, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine,
and Philoſophy, which are taught in other Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, are in their
higheſt perfection here. The proſperity of the firſt may be ſeen by the
crouded churches every Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and the diſcipline of the ſecond by the
numberleſs young Students who conſtantly dine in their reſpective halls
at the ſeveral inns of court. Theſe two faculties have of late received
conſiderable improvements, but particularly that of Theology, as is
manifeſt from ſeveral new and aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing opinions which have been
ſtarted among us. There have riſen, within theſe few years, very numerous
tribes of Methodiſts, Moravians, Middletonians, Hutchinſonians, &amp;c. in
a word our ſects are multiplied to ſuch an infinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that (as
<hi>Voltaire</hi> has before obſerved) every Man may now go to heaven his own
way. Can the Divinity Schools boaſt ſuch ſound doctrine as the Foundery
in <hi>Moorfields?</hi> or were ever fellows of colleges ſuch adepts in
Matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony as the reverend doctors of the <hi>Fleet,</hi> or the primate of
<hi>May-Fair?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE theory of Medicine may undoubtedly be taught at
<hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge</hi> in a tolerable manner, but the art
itſelf can only be learnt, where it flouriſhes, at <hi>London.</hi> Do not
our daily papers give us a longer liſt of medicines than are contained in any
of the Diſpenſatories? And are we not conſtantly told of ſurprizing
antidotes, certain cures, and never failing remedies for every complaint, and
are not each of theſe ſpecifies equally efficacious in one diſtemper as
another, from the grand reſtorative elixir of life down to the inſallible
corn ſalve? With what pleaſure and admiration <pb n="99" facs="tcp:1252700301:104"/> have I
beheld the <hi>Machaon</hi> of our times Dr. <hi>Richard Rock</hi>
diſpenſing from his one-horſe-chaiſe his cathartic antivene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
electuary, his itch powder, and his quinteſſence of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers! It may be
aſked, is he a graduate? Is he a regular phyſician? no, he is ſuperior to
regularity. He deſpiſes the formality of academical degrees. He ſtiles
himſelf M. L. He is a London Phyſician, or as <hi>Moliere</hi> would
expreſs it, <hi>C' eſt un Medecin de Londres.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>AFTER Medicine let us conſider Logic. How is that moſt
uſeful art taught in the two Univerſities? Is it not clogged with ſuch
barbarous terms, as tend to puzzle and confound, rather than enlighten or
direct the underſtanding? Is it not taught in a dead, I had almoſt ſaid
in a popiſh Tongue? Is it not overrun with dry diſtinctions, and
uſeleſs ſubtleties? Where then is it to be learnt in all the purity of
reaſon, and the dignity of language? Neither at <hi>Oxford</hi> nor at
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> but at the Robin Hood Alehouſe in Butcher Row, near
Temple Bar.</p>
                     <p>FROM Logic let us proceed to Eloquence: And let us
ingenuouſly confeſs that neither of our Univerſities can boaſt an
orator equal to the renown'd <hi>Henley.</hi> Has he not all the qualifications
required by <hi>Tully</hi> in a complete Orator? Has he not been followed by
the greateſt men of the nation? Yet has this modeſt divine never derived
any title to himſelf from his own rhetoric, except ſuch an one as his
extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary elocution naturally beſtowed upon him. Might he not have
called himſelf <hi>Preſident</hi> of the Butchers? <hi>Dean</hi> of
Marrowbones and Cleavers? or <hi>Warden</hi> of <hi>Clare Market?</hi>
certainly he might. Therefore if it were for his ſake only, in my humble
opinion, London ought immediately to aſſume the title of an Univerſity;
and the Butchers of Clare Market, who have ſo conſtantly attended Mr.
<hi>Henley</hi>'s Lectures, ought to be preſented with honorary degrees.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="100" facs="tcp:1252700301:105"/>I KNOW not what pretenſions the
Univerſities may have had originally to adopt <hi>Muſic</hi> among the
reſt of their Sciences: perhaps they have aſſumed a right of beſtowing
Degrees in <hi>Muſic,</hi> from their being called the ſeats of the
Muſes; as it is well known that <hi>Apollo</hi> was a fidler as well as a
poet and phyſician; and the Muſes are ſaid to have delighted in fidling
and piping. The young ſtudents, I am told, of either Univerſity are more
ambitious to excel in this ſcience than any other, and ſpend moſt of
their time in the ſtudy of the <hi>Gamut:</hi> but their knowledge in
<hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monics</hi> is ſeldom carried farther than <hi>I love Sue,</hi> or
<hi>Ally Croker.</hi> In this point <hi>London</hi> has undoubtedly a better
title to be called an Univerſity. Did <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge</hi>
ever produce an Opera, though they have the advantage of languages ſo very
little known as the <hi>Greek</hi> and even <hi>Hebrew</hi> to compoſe in?
Had ever any of their profeſſors the leaſt idea of a Burletta? or are any
of their moſt ſublime anthems half ſo raviſhing as <hi>Foote's
Minuet</hi> from the hand-organ of the little <hi>Savoyard Dutcheſs?</hi> Are
thoſe claſſical inſtruments the <hi>Doric Lute,</hi> the
<hi>Syrinx,</hi> or the <hi>Fiſtula,</hi> to be compared to the melody of the
<hi>Wooden Spoons,</hi> the <hi>Jews Harp</hi> and <hi>Salt-Box</hi> at Mrs.
<hi>Midnight</hi>'s?</p>
                     <p>BUT there is no doctrines more forcibly inculcated among us
than thoſe of <hi>Ethics,</hi> or moral Philoſophy. What are the precepts
of <hi>Plato, Epictetus,</hi> or <hi>Tully</hi> in compariſon to the moral
leſſons delivered by our periodical writers? And are not you, Mr. TOWN, a
wiſer man than <hi>Socrates?</hi> But the age is more particularly indebted,
for it's preſent uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal purity of manners, to thoſe excellent rules
for the conduct of life contained in our modern novels. From theſe moral
works might be compiled an entire new ſyſtem of Ethics, far ſuperior to
the exploded notions of muſty <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demics,</hi> and adapted to the
practiſe of the preſent times. <pb n="101" facs="tcp:1252700301:106"/> 
                        <hi>Cato,</hi> we are
told, commended a young man who he ſaw coming out of the publick ſtews,
becauſe he imagined it might preſerve him from the crime of adultery; and
the <hi>Spartans</hi> uſed to make their ſlaves drunk in the preſence of
their youth, that they might be deterred from the like debaucheries. For the
ſame reaſons we may ſuppoſe that our taverns and bagnios are ſo much
frequented by our young people, and in this light we may fairly conſider them
as ſo many <hi>ſchools of Moral Philoſophy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>IF we are willing to turn our thoughts towards Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimental
Philoſophy, can the ſeveral Univerſities of the whole world produce
ſuch a variety of inſtruments, ſo ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly collected, for
aſtronomical, geographical, and all other ſcientific obſervations, as are
to be ſeen in the two amazing repoſitories of Mr. Profeſſor
<hi>Deard</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> and of Mr. Profeſſor Ruſſel at
<hi>Charing Croſs?</hi> It were endleſs to enumerate particulars; but I
cannot help ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king notice of thoſe elegant little portable teleſcopes,
that are made uſe of in all public places; by which it is evident that even
our fine ladies and gentlemen are become pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficients in <hi>Optics.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Univerſities ſeem to pride themſelves greatly on
their choice collections of curious and invaluable trifles, which are there
preſerved, only becauſe they were not thought worth preſerving any where
elſe. But is the <hi>Aſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molean</hi> collection of rarities comparable to
the nicknackatory of Mr. <hi>Pinchbeck?</hi> or are any of their Muſaeums
ſtored with ſuch precious curioſities, as are frequently ſeen in Mr.
<hi>Langford</hi>'s Auction-Room? Strangers, who think it worth while to go
ſo far as <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge</hi> to ſee ſights, may
ſurely meet with as much ſatisfaction at <hi>London.</hi> Are the two
little Pigmies ſtriking a clock at <hi>Carſax</hi> within 
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1252700301:107"/> any degree of compariſon with the two noble Giants at
St. <hi>Dunſtan's</hi> church in <hi>Fleet Street</hi>; to ſay nothing of
their enormous brethren at <hi>Guildhall?</hi> Are any of the College Halls in
either of the Univerſities ſo magnificent as thoſe belonging to our
worſhipful companies? or can the Theatre at <hi>Oxford,</hi> or the
Senate-houſe at <hi>Cambridge,</hi> vie with that ſtupendous piece of
architecture the Manſion Houſe, ſet apart for our Chancellor the Lord
Mayor? It may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged perhaps that theſe are trifling examples of
ſuperiority, which the younger ſiſter bears over her two elder; but at
the ſame time it cannot be denied, that ſhe excells them both even in the
minutiae of learning and antiquity.</p>
                     <p>I MUST confeſs that Hydraulics, or the motion of Fluids,
ſeem to be taught exactly in the ſame manner, and with the ſame degree of
knowledge, in <hi>London</hi> as in <hi>Oxford</hi> or <hi>Cambridge.</hi> The
glaſs Tubes, and the Syphons, are formed very much in the ſame ſhape and
faſhion. The great hydroſtatical law, 
<q rend="inline">"That all fluids gravitate in <hi>proprio
loco,</hi>"</q> is proved by the ſame kind of experiments. The ſeveral
ſtudents, of whatever age or ſtation, vie with each other in an unwearied
application, and a conſtant attendance to this branch of mixed Mathematics.
The Profeſſors in each of the three Univerſities, are confeſſedly
very great men: but I hope I may be forgiven if I wiſh to ſee my friend Mr.
<hi>Ryan,</hi> Preſident of the <hi>King's Arms</hi> in <hi>Pall Mall,</hi>

farthing merely as a farthing, and look upon a copper coin of a <hi>Roman
Emperor</hi> as no better than a King <hi>George</hi>'s half-penny.</p>
               <p>I CANNOT indeed, without great concern, as a CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOISSEUR,
reflect on the known diſhoneſty of my learned brethren. Their ſcandalous
practiſes, wherever their darling paſſion is intereſted, are too
notorious to be denied. The moment they conceive a love for rarities and
antiques, their ſtrict notions of honour diſappear; and Taſte, the more
it eſtabliſhes their veneration for <hi>Virtù,</hi> the more
certainly deſtroys their integrity; as ruſt enhances the value of an old
coin by eating up the figure and inſcription.</p>
               <p>MOST people are maſters of a kind of Logic, by which they
argue their conſciences to ſleep, and acquit themſelves of doing what is
wrong. The country 'ſquire, of confirmed honeſty in all other reſpects,
thinks it very fair to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reach you in the ſale of a horſe; the man of
pleaſure, who would ſcorn to pick your pocket, or ſtop you on the road,
regards it rather as gallantry than baſeneſs to intrigue with your wife or
daughter; while the pick-pocket and highwayman value themſelves on their
honour in being true to the gang. In the ſame manner the <hi>Virtuoſo</hi>
does not look on his thefts as real acts of felony, but while he owns that he
would take any pains to ſteal an old ruſty piece of braſs, boaſts that
you may ſafely truſt him with untold gold: though he would break open your
cabinet for a ſhell or a butterfly, he would not attempt to force your
eſcritoire or your ſtrong box; nor would he offer the leaſt violence to
your wife or daughter, though perhaps he would run away with the little finger
of the <hi>Venus de Medicis.</hi> 
                  <pb n="105" facs="tcp:1252700301:110"/> Upon theſe
principles he proceeds, and lays hold of all opportunities to increaſe his
collection of rarities: and as <hi>Mahomet</hi> eſtabliſhed his religion by
the ſword, the <hi>Connoiſſeur</hi> enlarges his Muſaeum, and adds to
his ſtore of knowledge, by fraud and petty larceny.</p>
               <p>IF the libraries and cabinets of the curious were, like the
peacock in the fable, to be ſtripped of their borrowed ornaments, we ſhould
in many ſee nothing but bare ſhelves and empty drawers. I know a medaliſt
who at firſt ſet up with little more than a paltry ſeries of Engliſh
coins ſince the Reformation, which he had the good luck to pick up at their
intrinſic value. By a pliant uſe of his fingers he ſoon became
poſſeſt of moſt of the <hi>Traders,</hi> and by the ſame ſlight of
hand he in a ſhort time after made himſelf maſter of great part of the
<hi>Caeſars.</hi> He was once taken up for coining; a forge, a crucible, and
ſeveral dies being found in his cellar: but he was acquitted, as there was no
law which made it high-treaſon to counterfeit the image of a
<hi>Tiberius</hi> or a <hi>Nero</hi>; and the coin which he imitated was
current only among <hi>Virtuoſos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I REMEMBER another, who picqued himſelf on his collection of
ſcarce editions and original manuſcripts, moſt of which he had purloined
from the libraries of others. He was continually borrowing books of his
acquaintance, with a reſolution never to return them. He would ſend in a
great hurry for a particular edition, which he wanted to conſult only for a
moment; but when it was aſked for again, he was not at home, or he had lent
it to another, or he had loſt it, or he could not find it; and ſometimes he
would not ſcruple to ſwear, that he had himſelf delivered it into the
owner's hands. He would frequently ſpoil a ſet by ſtealing a volume, and
then purchaſe the reſt for <pb n="106" facs="tcp:1252700301:111"/> a trifle. After his death
his library was ſold by auction; and many of his friends bought up their own
books at an exorbitant price.</p>
               <p>A THOROUGHBRED <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> will ſurmount all
ſcruples of conſcience, or encounter any danger to ſerve his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
Moſt of them are chiefly attached to ſome particular branch of knowledge,
but I remember one who was paſſionately fond of every part of
<hi>Virtù.</hi> At one time, when he could find no other way of carrying
off a medal, he run the riſk of being choaked by ſwallowing it, and at
another broke his leg in ſcaling a garden wall for a tulip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>root. But nothing
gave him ſo much trouble and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty as the taking away pictures and
antient marbles; which being heavy and unwieldy, he often endangered his life
to gratify his curioſity. He was once locked up all night in the Duke of
<hi>Tuſcany</hi>'s gallery, where he took out an original painting of
<hi>Raphael,</hi> and dextrouſly placed a copy of it in the frame. At
<hi>Venice</hi> he turned Roman Catholic, and became a Jeſuit, in order to
get admittance into a convent, from whence he ſtole a fine head of
<hi>Ignatius Loyola</hi>; and at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> he had almoſt
formed a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of qualifying himſelf for the Seraglio, that he might
find means to carry off a picture of the Grand Signior's chief
miſtreſs.</p>
               <p>THE general diſhoneſty of <hi>Connoiſſeurs</hi> is
indeed ſo well known, that the ſtricteſt precaution is taken to guard
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it. Medals are ſecured under lock and key, pictures ſcrewed to
the walls, and books chained to the ſhelves; yet cabinets, galleries, and
libraries are continually plundered. Many of the maimed ſtatues at
<hi>Rome</hi> perhaps owe their preſent ruinous condition to the depredations
made on them by <hi>Virtuoſos:</hi> the head of <hi>Henry</hi> the Fifth 
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1252700301:112"/> in <hi>Weſtminſter Abby</hi> was in all probability
ſtolen by a <hi>Connoiſſeur</hi>; and I know one who has at different
times pilfered a great part of Queen <hi>Catherine</hi>'s bones, and hopes in a
little while to be maſter of the whole ſkeleton. This gentleman has been
detected in ſo many little thefts, that he has for ſeveral years paſt
been refuſed admittance into the Muſaeums of the curious; and he is lately
gone abroad with a deſign upon the ancient <hi>Greek</hi> manuſcripts
lately diſcovered at <hi>Herculaneum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT may ſeem ſurprizing that theſe gentlemen ſhould have
hitherto been ſuffered to eſcape unpuniſhed for their repeated thefts,
and that a <hi>Virtuoſo</hi> who robs you of an <hi>Unic</hi> of
ineſtimable value ſhould even glory in the action, while a poor dog who
picks your pocket of ſixpence ſhall be hanged for it. What a ſhocking
diſgrace would be brought upon Taſte, ſhould we ever ſee the dying
ſpeech, confeſſion, and behaviour of a <hi>Connoiſſeur</hi> related
in the Account of Malefactors by the Ordinary of <hi>Newgate!</hi> Such an
accident would doubtleſs bring the ſtudy of <hi>Virtù</hi> into
ſtill more contempt among the ignorant, when they found that it only brought
a man to the gallows; as the country fellow, when he ſaw an attorney ſtand
in the pillory for forgery, ſhook his head, and cried, 
<q rend="inline">"Ay, this comes of your writing and
reading."</q> It were perhaps worthy the conſideration of the legiſlature
to deviſe ſome puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for theſe offenders, which ſhould bear
ſome analogy with their crimes; and as common malefactors are delivered to
the ſurgeons to be anatomized, I would propoſe that a
<hi>Connoiſſeur</hi> ſhould be made into a Mummy, and preſerved in the
Hall of the Royal Society, for the terror and admiration of his brethren.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:1252700301:113"/>I SHALL conclude this paper with the
relation of a circumſtance which fell within my own knowledge when I was
abroad, and in which I declined a glorious opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſignalizing
myſelf as a <hi>Connoiſſeur.</hi> While I was at <hi>Rome</hi> a young
phyſician of our party, who was eaten up with <hi>Virtù,</hi> made a
ſerious propoſal to us of breaking into St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s by night, and
taking away the famous painting over the altar-piece. As I had not quite
Taſte enough to come at once into his ſcheme, I could not help objecting to
him that it was a robbery. <hi>Poh,</hi> ſays he, <hi>it is a moſt
exquiſite picture!</hi>—Ay, but it is not only a robbery, but
ſacrilege.—<hi>Oh it is a moſt charming piece!</hi>—Zouns,
doctor, but if we ſhould be taken, we ſhall all be broke upon the
wheel.—<hi>Then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>we ſhall die</hi> MARTYRS.</p>

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>WHEN you was got into <hi>White</hi>'s, I was in hopes that
you would not have confin'd yourſelf merely to the gaming-table, but have
given us an account of the entertainment at their ordinaries. A bill of fare
from thence would have been full as diverting to your readers 
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1252700301:115"/> as the laws of the game, or a liſt of their bets.
Theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, we are told, are no leſs adepts in the ſcience of
Eating than of Gaming; and as <hi>Hoyle</hi> has reduc'd the latter into a new
and complete ſyſtem, I could wiſh that their cook (who to be ſure is a
<hi>Frenchman</hi>) would alſo oblige the world by a treatiſe on the Art
and Myſtery of Sauces.</p>
                     <p>INDEED, Mr. TOWN, it ſurprizes me that you have ſo long
neglected to make ſome reflections on the Diet of this great city. Dr.
<hi>Martin Liſter,</hi> who was univerſally allowed to be a great
<hi>Connoiſſeur,</hi> and publiſhed ſeveral learned trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes upon
cockle-ſhells, did not think it beneath him to comment on the works of
<hi>Apicius Caelius,</hi> who had collected together many valuable receipts in
cookery, as practiſed by the <hi>Romans.</hi> If you would preſerve your
papers from the indignity of covering breaſts of veal, or wrapping up outlets
<hi>à la Maintenon,</hi> I would adviſe you to lard them now and then
with the ragouts of <hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> or a parallel between our modern
ſoups and the <hi>Lacedaemonian</hi> black broth. Your works might then be
univerſally read, from the miſtreſs in the parlour down to the cookmaid
and ſcullion.</p>
                     <p>IT is abſolutely neceſſary for people of all tempers,
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexions, perſuaſions, habits and ſtations of life, however they may
differ in other particulars, to concur in the grand article of Eating; and as
the humours of the body ariſe from the food we take in, the diſpoſitions
of the mind ſeem to bear an equal reſemblance to our places of
refreſhment. You have already taken a review of our ſeveral
coffee-houſes; and I wiſh you would proceed to delineate the different
cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters that are to be found in our taverns and chop-houſes. A friend of
mine always judges of a man of taſte and faſhion, by aſking who is his
peruke-maker, or his taylor? Upon the ſame principles, when I would form a
juſt opinion <pb n="111" facs="tcp:1252700301:116"/> any man's temper and inclinations, I
always enquire, where does he dine?</p>
                     <p>THE difference between the taverns near St. <hi>James</hi>'s
and thoſe about the <hi>'Change</hi> conſiſts not ſo much in the
coſtli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as the ſubſtance of their viands. The round-bellied
alderman, who breathes the foggy air of the city, requires a more ſolid diet
than the high kickſhaws of our meagre perſons of quality. My Lord, or Sir
<hi>John,</hi> after having whiled away an hour or two at the
Parliament-houſe, drive to the <hi>Star and Garter</hi> to regale on
Macaroni, or pid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with an Ortolan; while the merchant, who has plodded all
the morning in the Alley, ſits down to a Turtle-Feaſt at the <hi>Crown</hi>
or the <hi>King's Arms,</hi> and crams himſelf with Calipaſh and Calipee.
As the city taverns are appropriated to men of buſineſs, who drive bargains
for thouſands over their morning's gill, the taverns about the court are
gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally filled with an inſipid race of mortals who have nothing to do.
Among theſe you may ſee moſt of our young men of faſhion and young
officers of the guards, who meet at theſe places to ſhew the elegance of
their taſte by the expenſiveneſs of their dinner; and I know an Enſign
with ſcarce any income but his commiſſion, who prides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on
keeping the beſt company, and throws down more than a week's pay for his
reckoning.</p>
                     <p>THE taverns about the purlieus of <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> are
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated to <hi>Venus</hi> as well as <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Liber</hi>; and
you may frequently ſee the jolly meſſmates of both ſexes go in and come
out in couples, like the clean and unclean beaſts in <hi>Noah</hi>'s ark.
Theſe houſes are equally indebted for their ſupport to the Cook and that
worthy perſonage whom they have dignified with the title of Pimp. Theſe
gentlemen contrive to play into each other's hands: The firſt by his 
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:1252700301:117"/> high ſoups and rich ſauces prepares the way for the
occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the other, who having reduced the patient by a proper exerciſe
of his art, returns him back again to go through the ſame regimen as before.
We may therefore ſuppoſe that the culinary arts are no leſs ſtudied
here than at <hi>White</hi>'s or <hi>Pontac</hi>'s. True geniuſes in Eating
will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually ſtrike out new improvements; but I dare ſay neither
<hi>Braund</hi> nor <hi>Lebeck</hi> ever made up a more extraordinary diſh
than I once remember at the <hi>Caſtle.</hi> Some bloods being in company
with a celebrated <hi>fille de joye,</hi> one of them pulled off her ſhoe,
and in exceſs of gallantry filled it with Champagne, and drank it off to her
health: in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious draught he was immediately pledged by the reſt;
and then, to carry the compliment ſtill further, he ordered it to be dreſt,
and ſerved up for ſupper. The cook ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſeriouſly to work
upon it: He pulled the upper part (which was of damaſk) into fine ſhreds,
and toſſed it up in a ragout; minced the ſole; cut the wooden heel into
very thin ſlices, fried them in butter, and placed them round the diſh for
garniſh. The company, you may be ſure, teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their affection for the
lady by eating very heartily of this exquiſite <hi>impromptu</hi>; and as
this tranſaction happened juſt after the <hi>French</hi> King had taken a
cobler's daughter for his miſtreſs, <hi>Tom Pierce</hi> (who has the
ſtile as well as art of a <hi>French</hi> cook) in his bill politely called
it, in honour of her name, <hi>De ſoulier á la Murphy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>TAVERNS, Mr. TOWN, ſeem contrived for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting of
luxury; while the humbler Chop-houſes are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned only to ſatisfy the
ordinary cravings of nature. Yet at theſe you may meet with a variety of
characters: at <hi>Dolly</hi>'s and <hi>Horſeman</hi>'s you commonly ſee
the hearty lovers of a beef-ſteak and gill ale; and at <hi>Betty</hi>'s and
the chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes about the Inns of Court, a pretty maid is as inviting 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1252700301:118"/> as the proviſions. In theſe common refectories you
may always find the jemmy attorney's clerk, the prim curate, the walking
phyſician, the ſhabby valet de chambre upon board wages, and the foreign
count or marquis in diſhabille, who has refuſed to dine with a duke or an
ambaſſador. At a little eating-houſe in a dark alley behind the
<hi>'Change</hi> I once ſaw a grave citizen, worth a plumb, order a two-penny
meſs of broth with a boiled chop in it: when it was brought him, he ſcooped
the crumb out of a half-penny roll, and ſoaked it in the porridge for his
preſent meal; then carefully placing the chop between the upper and under
cruſt, he wrapped it up in a checked handkerchief, and carried it off for the
morrow's repaſt.</p>
                     <p>I SHALL leave it to you, ſir, to make further reflections on
this ſubject, and ſhould be glad to dine with you at any tavern, dive with
you into any cellar, take a beef-ſteak in <hi>Ivy lane,</hi> a mutton-chop
behind St. <hi>Clement</hi>'s, or, if you chuſe it, an extempore ſauſage
or black-pudding over the farthing fries at <hi>Moor-Fields</hi> or the
<hi>Horſe-Guards.</hi>

                     <p>BY <hi>Jove</hi> it is a ſhame, a burning ſhame, to ſee
the honour of <hi>England,</hi> the glory of our nation, the greateſt pillar
of life, ROAST BEEF, utterly baniſhed from our tables. This evil, like many
others, has been growing upon us by degrees: it was begun by wickedly placing
the Beef upon a ſide table, and ſcreening it by a parcel of queue-tailed
fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in laced waiſtcoats. However, the odorous effluvia generally
affected the ſmell of every true <hi>Briton</hi> in the room. The butler was
fatigued with carving: the maſter of the houſe grew pale, and ſickened at
the ſight of thoſe juicy collops of fat and lean that came ſwimming in
gravy <pb n="114" facs="tcp:1252700301:119"/> and ſmoaking moſt deliciouſly under our
noſtrils. Other methods therefore were to be purſued. The Beef was ſtill
ſerved up, but it was brought up cold. It was put upon a table in the
darkeſt part of the room, and immured between four walls formed artificially
by the ſervants with the hats of the company. When the jellies and the
ſlip-ſlops were coming in, the Beef was carried off in as ſecret a manner
as if it had gone through the ceremonies of concoction. But ſtill, ſir,
under all theſe diſadvantages we had a chance of getting a ſlice as it
paſſed by. Now alas! it is not ſuffered to come up ſtairs. I dare ſay
it is generally baniſhed from the ſteward's table; nor do I ſuppoſe
that the powdered footmen will touch it, for fear of dawbing their ruffles. So
that the diſh that was ſerved up to the royal tables, the diſh that was
the breakfaſt of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her maids of honour, the diſh
that received the dignity of knighthood from King <hi>James</hi> the Firſt,
is now become the food only of ſcullions and ſtable-boys. In what words can
I vent my reſentment upon this occaſion? eſpecially when I reflect that
innovations ſeldom come alone. Toaſted cheeſe is already buried in
rammekins: plumb-porridge has been long ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: I tremble for
plumb-pudding. May we not live to ſee a leg of pork deteſted as carrion?
and a ſhoulder of mutton avoided as if it were horſe-fleſh? Our only
hopes are in the Clergy, and in the Beef-ſteak Club. The former ſtill
preſerve, and probably will preſerve, the rectitude of their appetites; and
will do juſtice to Beef, wherever they find it. The latter (who are
compoſed of the moſt ingenious artiſts in the kingdom) meet every
Saturday in a noble room at the top of <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> theatre, and
never ſuffer any diſh except Beef-ſteaks to appear. Theſe indeed are
moſt glorious examples: but what alas! are the weak endeavours of a few to
oppoſe the daily inroads of fricaſſees and ſoup-maigres? This, Mr.
TOWN, is a national concern, as it may prove more deſtructive to Beef than
the diſtemper among the horned cattle: and ſhould the modiſh averſion
againſt rumps and ſirloins continue, it will be abſolutely neceſſary
to enforce the love of Beef by act of parliament.</p>

fair damſels of old were chiefly to be found in woods and foreſts; but our
preſent heroines are diſtinguiſhed by an utter averſion to the country,
and would as ſoon be confin'd by a giant in an enchanted caſtle, as immured
with old maiden aunts in the family manſion houſe. Nothing is more dreadful
to our ladies of quality than the approach of ſummer: for what woman of
ſpirit would chuſe to leave the <pb n="116" facs="tcp:1252700301:121"/> town to wander in
ſolitudes and deſarts; or what pleaſure can the long days give to our
fine ladies, when the pretty crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are conſcious that they look beſt
by candlelight? The general complaint againſt the country is want of
amuſement, or want of company: but theſe common inconveniences are trifles
in compariſon to the ſufferings of the poor lady who writes the following
letter, which was communicated to me with leave to make it public.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">

                     <opener>
                        <salute>Dear Lady CHARLOTTE,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I HAVE been plagued, peſtered, teized to death, and hurried
out of my wits, ever ſince I have been in this odious country. O my dear, how
I long to be in town again! <hi>Pope</hi> and the poets may talk what they will
of their purling ſtreams, ſhady groves, and flowery meads: but I had rather
live all my days among the cheeſemongers ſhops in <hi>Thames Street,</hi>
than paſs ſuch another ſpring in this filthy country. Would you believe
it? I have ſcarce touched a card ſince I have been here; and then there has
been ſuch ado with us about election matters, that I am ready to die with the
vapours: ſuch a rout with their hiſſing and hollow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, my head is ready
to ſplit into a thouſand pieces! If my Sir <hi>John</hi> muſt be in
parliament, why cannot he do as your lord does, and be content with a borough,
where he might come in without all this trouble; and take his ſeat in the
houſe, though he has never been within a hundred miles of the place.</p>
                     <p>OUR houſe, my dear, has been a perfect inn, ever ſince we
came down; and I have been obliged to trudge about as much as a fat landlady.
Our doors are open to every dirty fellow in the county that is worth forty
ſhillings; all my beſt floors are ſpoiled by the hobnails of farmers
ſtumping about them; every room is a pigſtye, and the <hi>Chineſe</hi>
paper <pb n="117" facs="tcp:1252700301:122"/> in the drawing-room ſtinks ſo abominably of
punch and tobacco, that it would ſtrike you down to come into it. If you knew
what I have ſuffered, you would think I had the conſtitution of a chairman
to go through it. We never ſit down to table without a dozen or more of
boiſterous two-legged creatures as rude as bears; and I have nothing to do
but to heap up their plates, and drink to each of their healths: what is
worſe than all, one of the beaſts got tipſy, and nothing would ſerve
him but he muſt kiſs me, which I was obliged to ſubmit to for fear of
loſing his vote and intereſt. Would you think it, dear
<hi>Charlotte?</hi>—do not laugh at me—I ſtood godmother in
perſon to a huge lubberly boy at a country farmer's, and they almoſt
poiſoned me with their hodgepodge they called caudle, made of ſour ale and
brown ſugar. All this and more I have been obliged to comply with, that the
country fellows might not ſay my lady is proud and above them.</p>
                     <p>BESIDES, there is not a woman creature within twenty miles of
the place that is fit company for my houſekeeper, and yet I muſt be
intimate with them all. Lady <hi>B—</hi> indeed is very near us; but
though we are very well acquainted in town, we muſt not be ſeen to ſpeak
to each other here, becauſe her lord is in the oppoſition. Poor
<hi>Thomas</hi> got a ſad drubbing at her houſe, when I innocently ſent
him at my firſt coming into the country with a how d'ye to her lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
The greateſt female acquaintance I have here are Mrs. Mayoreſs, a taylor's
wife, and Mrs. Alderman <hi>Gaſcoyne</hi> who ſells pins and needles on one
ſide of the ſhop, while her huſband works at his peſtle and mortar on
the other. Theſe ordinary wretches are conſtant attendants on my tea-table;
I am obliged to take them and their brats out an airing in my coach every
evening; and am afterwards often doomed to ſit down to whiſt and
ſwabbers, or one and thirty bone-ace <pb n="118" facs="tcp:1252700301:123"/> for farthings.
Mrs. Mayoreſs is a very violent party woman; and ſhe has two pug-dogs, one
of which ſhe calls Sir <hi>John</hi> and the other Colonel, in compliment you
muſt know to my huſband and his brother candidate.</p>
                     <p>WE had a ball the other day; and I opened it with Sir
<hi>Humphrey Chaſe,</hi> who danced in his boots, and hobbled along for all
the world like the dancing bears which I have ſeen in the ſtreets at
<hi>London.</hi> A terrible miſtake happened about precedence, which I fear
will loſe Sir <hi>John</hi> a good many votes: an attorney's wife was very
angry that her daughter, who is a little pert chit juſt come from the
board<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſchool, was not called out to dance before Miſs <hi>Norton</hi>
the brewer's daughter, when every body knew, ſhe ſaid, that her girl was a
gentlewoman bred and born.</p>
                     <p>I wiſh, my dear, you were to ſee my dreſſing-room; you
would think it was a ribband-ſhop. <hi>Lettice</hi> and I have been buſy
all this week in making up knots and favours, and yeſterday no milliner's
prentice could work harder than I did in tying them on to the ſweaty hats of
country bumpkins. And is not it very hard upon me? I muſt not even dreſs as
I pleaſe; but am obliged to wear blue, though you know it does not ſuit my
complexion, and makes me look as horrid as the witches in <hi>Macbeth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>BUT what is worſe than all, Sir <hi>John</hi> tells me the
election expences have run ſo high that he muſt ſhorten my allowance of
pin-money. He talks of turning off half his ſervants; nay, he has even hinted
to me that I ſhall not come to town all the winter. Barbarous creature! but
if he dares ſerve me ſo, he ſhall poſitively loſe his election next
time; I will raiſe ſuch a ſpirit of oppoſition in all the wives and
daughters in the county againſt him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="119" facs="tcp:1252700301:124"/>YOU ſee, my dear, what a miſerable
life I have led ever ſince I have been baniſhed into this odious country. I
wiſh I had married an earl or a duke, and then I ſhould not have been
plagued with this fuſs about elections. I dont know why Sir <hi>John</hi>
ſhould be ſo deſirous to be choſen; for I dont find a parliament man's
lady a bit more reſpected among the polite world. You will excuſe my
employing <hi>Lettice</hi> to write this, while I dictated: as the girl was a
parſon's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſhe has a good education, and can ſpell tolerably
well: and really my eyes are ſo bad, (from not being able to ſleep at

               <p>THIS lady's caſe, as related above, is indeed a very
diſtreſsful one; but as Sir <hi>John</hi> has had the good luck to gain his
point after a ſtrong oppoſition, he will doubtleſs be ſenſible of the
great ſhare his lady had in his ſucceſs. For my own part, when I
conſider the vaſt influence which the fair ſex muſt naturally have over
my fellow countrymen, I cannot help looking on their intereſting themſelves
in theſe matters as a very ſerious affair. What ſucceſs muſt a fine
lady meet with on her canvaſs! No gentleman to be ſure could be ſo rude
or ſo cruel as to refuſe ſuch a pretty beggar any thing ſhe could
aſk; and an honeſt country farmer, who could withſtand any other
arguments, might be coaxed and wheedled, or bribed with a ſmile, into voting
againſt his conſcience. Many inſtances have been found during the late
election, of huſbands who have been forced to poll as their wives would have
them; and I know a young fellow that was brought over to give a vote againſt
his inclination <pb n="120" facs="tcp:1252700301:125"/> by his ſweetheart, who refuſed to
receive his addreſſes if he did not change his party.</p>
               <p>IT may not perhaps be too bold an aſſertion, that half the
members in the preſent parliament owe their ſeats to the direct or indirect
influence of the other ſex: It would there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be highly proper for the
legiſlature to provide againſt this evil for the future, and I hope
ſhortly to ſee among the Votes the following Reſolution.</p>

Chief Captain over the Sixteen Nations of <hi>Caffraria.</hi> He was
deſcended from <hi>N'oh</hi> and <hi>Hingn'oh,</hi> who dropt from the Moon;
and his power extended over all the <hi>Kraals</hi> of the
<hi>Hottentots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Prince was remarkable for his proweſs and activity: his
ſpeed was like the torrent that ruſhes down the preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice, and he would
overtake the Wild Aſs in her flight: his Arrows brought down the Eagle from
the clouds, the Lion fell before him, and his Launce drank the blood of the
Rhinoceros. He fathomed the waters of the deep, and buffeted the billows in the
tempeſt: he drew the Rock-Piſh from their lurking-holes, and rifled the
beds of Coral. <pb n="122" facs="tcp:1252700301:127"/> Trained from his infancy in the
exerciſe of war, to wield the Haſſagaye with dexterity, and break the
Wild Bulls to battle, he was a ſtranger to the ſoft dalliance of love; and
beheld with indifference the thicklipped damſels of <hi>Gongeman,</hi> and
the flatnoſed beauties of <hi>Hauteniqua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS TQUASSOUW was one day giving inſtructions for ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
toils for the Elk, and digging pitfalls for the Elephant, he received
information, that a Tyger prowling for prey was committing ravages on the
<hi>Kraals</hi> of the <hi>Chamtouers.</hi> He ſnatched up his Bow of
Olive-wood, and bounded, like the Roe-Buck on the mountains, to their
aſſiſtance. He ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived juſt at the inſtant, when the enraged animal
was about to faſten on a Virgin, and aiming a poiſoned arrow at his heart
laid him dead at her feet. The Virgin threw herſelf on the ground, and
covered her head with duſt, to thank her deliverer; but when ſhe roſe,
the Prince was dazzled with her charms. He was ſtruck with the gloſſy hue
of her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, which ſhone like the jetty down of the Black Hog of
<hi>Heſſaqua</hi>: he was raviſhed with the preſt griſtle of her
noſe; and his eyes dwelt with admiration on the flaccid beauties of her
breaſts, which deſcended to her navel.</p>
               <p>KNONMQUAIHA, (for that was the Virgin's name,) was daughter to
the <hi>Kouqucqua</hi> or Leader of the <hi>Kraal</hi>; who bred her up with
all the delicacy of her ſex. She was fed with the entrails of Goats, ſhe
ſucked the eggs of the Oſtrich, and her drink was the milk of Ewes. After
gazing for ſome time upon her charms, the Prince in great tranſport
embraced the ſoles of her feet: then ripping up the beaſt he had juſt
killed, took out the Caul, and hung it about her neck, in token of his
affection. He afterwards ſtripped the Tyger of his ſkin, and ſending it
to the <hi>Kouqucqua</hi> her father demanded the damſel in marriage.</p>
               <p>THE eve of the full moon was appointed for the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
the nuptials of TQUASSOUW and KNONMQUAIHA. When the day arrived, the
magnificence in which the Bridegroom was arrayed amazed all <hi>Caffraria.</hi>
Over his <pb n="123" facs="tcp:1252700301:128"/> ſhoulders was caſt a <hi>Kroſſe</hi> or
Mantle of Wild Cat-ſkins: he cut Sandals for his feet from the raw hide of an
Elephant; he hunted down a Leopard, and of the ſpotted fur formed a ſuperb
Cap for his head; he girded his loins with the Inteſtines, and the Bladder of
the beaſt he blew up and faſtened to his hair.</p>
               <p>NOR was KNONMQUAIHA leſs employed in adorning her perſon.
She made a varniſh of the fat of Goats mixed with ſoot, with which ſhe
anointed her whole body as ſhe ſtood beneath the rays of the ſun: her
locks were clotted with melted greaſe, and powdered with the yellow duſt of
<hi>Buchu:</hi> her face, which ſhone like the poliſhed Ebony, was
beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully varied with ſpots of Red Earth, and appeared like the ſable
curtain of the night beſpangled with ſtars: ſhe ſprinkled her limbs
with wood-aſhes, and perfumed them with, the dung of the
<hi>Stinkbingſem.</hi> Her arms and legs were entwined with the ſhining
entrails of a Heifer: from her neck there hung a pouch compoſed of the
ſtomach of a Kid: the wings of an Oſtrich overſhadowed the fleſhy
promontories behind; and before ſhe wore an apron formed of the ſhaggy ears
of a Lion.</p>
               <p>THE Chiefs of the ſeveral <hi>Kraals,</hi> who were ſummoned
to aſſiſt at their nuptials, formed a circle on the ground, ſitting
upon their heels, and bowed their heads between their knees in token of
reverence. In the centre the illuſtrious Prince with his ſable Bride
repoſed upon ſoft cuſhions of Cow-dung. Then the <hi>Surri</hi> or Chief
Prieſt approached them, and in a deep voice chaunted the nuptial rites to the
melodious grumbling of the <hi>Gom-Gom</hi>; and at the ſame time (according
to the manner of <hi>Caffraria</hi>) bedewed them plentifully with the urinary
benediction. The Bride and Bridegroom rubbed in the precious ſtream with
extaſy; while the briny drops trickled from their bodies, like the oozy
ſurge from the Rocks of <hi>Chirigriqua.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE <hi>Hottentots</hi> had ſeen the increaſe and wane of
two moons ſince the happy union of TQUASSOUW and KNONM<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>QUAIHA, 
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1252700301:129"/> when the <hi>Kraals</hi> were ſurpriſed with the
appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of a moſt extraordinary perſonage, that came from the ſavage
people who roſe from the ſea, and had lately fixed themſelves on the
borders of <hi>Caffraria.</hi> His body was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrapped with ſtrange
coverings, which concealed every part from ſight except his face and hands.
Upon his ſkin the ſun darted his ſcorching rays in vain, and the colour
of it was pale and wan as the watry beams of the moon. His hair, which he could
put on and take off at pleaſure, was white as the bloſſoms of the Almond
Tree, and buſhy as the fleece of the Ram. His lips and cheeks reſembled the
Red Oker, and his noſe was ſharpened like the beak of an Eagle. His
language, which was rough and inarticulate, was as the language of beaſts;
nor could TQUASSOUW diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his meaning, till a <hi>Hottentot</hi> (who at
the firſt coming of theſe people had been taken priſoner, and had
afterwards made his eſcape) interpreted between them. This interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
informed the Prince, that the ſtranger was ſent from his fellow countrymen
to treat about the enlargement of their territories, and that he was called
among them MYNHEER VAN SNICKERSNEE.</p>
               <p>TQUASSOUW, who was remarkable for his humanity, treated the
ſavage with extraordinary benevolence. He ſpread a mantle of Sheep-ſkins
anointed with fat for his bed, and for his food he boiled in their own blood
the tripes of the fatteſt herds, that grazed in the rich paſtures of the
<hi>Heykoms.</hi> The ſtranger in return inſtructed the Prince in the
manners of the ſavages, and often amuſed him with ſending fire from a
hollow engine, which rent the air with thunder. Nor was he leſs ſtudious to
pleaſe the gentle KNONMQUAIHA. He bound bracelets of poliſhed metal about
her arms, and encircled her neck with beads of glaſs: he filled the
Cocoa-ſhell with a delicious liquor, and gave it her to drink, which
exhilarated her heart, and made her eyes ſparkle with joy: he alſo taught
her to kindle fire through a tube of clay with the dried leaves of
<hi>Dacha,</hi> and to ſend forth rolls of odorous ſmoke from her mouth.
After having <pb n="125" facs="tcp:1252700301:130"/> ſojourned in the <hi>Kraals</hi> for the
ſpace of half a moon, the ſtranger was diſmiſſed with magnificent
preſents of the teeth of Elephants; and a grant was made to his countrymen of
the fertile meadows of <hi>Kochoqua,</hi> and the foreſts of
<hi>Stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood</hi> bounded by the <hi>Palamite</hi> River.</p>
               <p>TQUASSOUW and KNONMQUAIHA continued to live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the
moſt cordial affection; and the <hi>Surris</hi> every night invoked the great
<hi>Gounja Ticquoa,</hi> who illuminates the Moon, that he would give an heir
to the race of <hi>N'oh</hi> and <hi>Hingn'oh.</hi> The Princeſs at length
manifeſted the happy tokens of pregnancy; her waiſt encreaſed daily in
circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and ſwelled like the Gourd. When the time of her delivery
approached, ſhe was committed to the care of the Wiſe Women, who placed her
on a couch of the reeking entrails of a Cow newly ſlain, and to facilitate
the birth gave her a potion of the milk of Wild Aſſes, and fomented her
loins with the warm dung of Elephants. When the throes of child-birth came on,
a terrible hurricane howled along the coaſt, the air bellowed with thunder,
and the face of the Moon was obſcured as with a veil. The <hi>Kraal</hi>
echoed with ſhrieks and lamentations, and the Wiſe Women cried out, that
the Princeſs was delivered of a MONSTER.</p>
               <p>THE product of her womb was WHITE.—They took the child,
and waſhed him with the juice of Aloes:—they expoſed his limbs to the
ſun, anointed them with the fat, and rubbed them with the excrement of Black
Bulls:—but his ſkin ſtill retained it's deteſted hue, and the child
was ſtill WHITE. The venerable <hi>Surris</hi> were aſſembled to
deliberate on the cauſe of this prodigy; and they unanimouſly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced,
that it was owing to the evil machinations of the Daemon <hi>Cham-ouna,</hi>
who had practiſed on the virtue of the Princeſs under the appearance of
MYNHEER VAN SNICKERSNEE.</p>
               <p>THE inceſtuous parent with her unnatural offspring were judged
unworthy to live. They bowed a branch of an Olive Tree in the Foreſt of
Lions, on which the white monſter was ſuſpended by the heels; and
ravenous beaſts feaſted on <pb n="126" facs="tcp:1252700301:131"/> the iſſue of
KNONMQUAIHA. The Princeſs herſelf was ſentenced to the ſevere
puniſhment allotted to the heinous crime of Adultery. The
<hi>Kouquequas,</hi> who ſcarce twelve moons before had met to celebrate her
nuptials, were now ſummoned to aſſiſt at her unhappy death. They were
collected in a circle, each of them wielding a huge club of Cripplewood. The
beauteous criminal ſtood weeping in the midſt of them, prepared to receive
the firſt blow from the hand of her injured Huſband. TQUASSOUW in vain
aſſayed to perform the ſad office: thrice he uplifted his ponderous mace
of iron, and thrice dropt it ineffectual on the ground. At length from his
reluctant arm deſcended the fell ſtroke, which lighted on that noſe,
whoſe flatneſs and expanſion at firſt captivated his heart. The
<hi>Kouquequas</hi> then ruſhing in, with their clubs redoubled their blows
on her body, 'till the pounded KNONMQUAIHA lay as an heap of mud, which the
retiring flood leaves on the ſtrand.</p>
               <p>HER battered limbs, now without form and diſtinction, were
encloſed in the paunch of a Rhinoceros, which was faſtened to the point of
a bearded arrow, and ſhot into the Ocean. TQUASSOUW remained inconſolable
for her loſs: he frequently climbed the lofty Cliffs of <hi>Chirigriqua,</hi>
and caſt his eyes on the watry expanſe. One night, as he ſtood howling
with the Wolves to the Moon, he deſcried the paunch that contained the
precious relicks of KNONMQUAIHA, dancing on a wave, and floating towards him.
Thrice he cried out with a lamentable voice, <hi>Bo, Bo, Bo:</hi> then
ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the cliff, he darted like the Eagle ſouſing on his prey.
The paunch burſt in ſunder beneath his weight; the green wave was
diſcoloured with the gore; and TQUAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOUW was inveloped in the maſs. He was
heard of no more; and it was believed, that he was ſnatched up into the
Moon.</p>
               <p>THEIR unhappy fate is recorded among the Nations of the
<hi>Hottentots</hi> to this day; and their Marriage-rites have ever ſince
concluded with a wiſh, 
<q rend="inline">"That the Huſband may be happier than
TQUASSOUW, and the Wife more chaſte than KNONMQUAIHA."</q>

                     </opener>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> REMEMBER, in a match between two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of different
religions, it was ſtipulated in the marriage articles, that the boys ſhould
be bred up in the perſuation of the father, and the girls in that of the
mother. The conſequence of this was, that one part of the family was taught
to look upon the other with a moſt pious comtempt; and in the end it produced
a ſeparaſion. The ſons followed the example of their father, and in order
to avoid the leaſt appearance of ſuperſtition and bigotry, turned out
free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinkers: the lady of the houſe retired with her daughters 
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1252700301:133"/> to <hi>France,</hi> and to preſerve them from a
communication with heretics confined them in a nunnery.</p>
                     <p>THE like method ſeems to be obſerved in the general
education of children; who as ſoon as they leave the nurſery, are
reſigned over to the care and direction of their reſpective parents
according to their ſex: whence it often happens, that families are as much
diſtinguiſhed by their peculiar manners, as by a certain caſt of features
or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion. My young 'ſquire is put upon a little horſe before he can
well walk, and becomes (as his father was before him) the pupil and companion
of the groom and the game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper: And if miſs's mamma ſhould chance to be
the daughter of a poor man of quality, and the wife of a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial
tradeſman, the little lady is early inſtructed to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue herſelf on her
blood, and to deſpiſe her father's dirty connections with buſineſs.</p>
                     <p>TO this method of education it is owing, that the ſame vices
and follies are delivered down from one generation to another. The modiſh
exceſſes of theſe times are in their nature the ſame with thoſe which
were formerly in vogue, though they differ ſomewhat in their ſhape and
appearance. The preſent race of bucks, bloods, and freethinkers, are but the
ſpawn of the <hi>Mohocks</hi> and the <hi>Hell-Fire Club:</hi> and if our
modern fine ladies have had their Maſquerades, their <hi>Vauxhalls,</hi>
their Sunday Tea Drinkings at <hi>Ranelagh,</hi> and their Morning Chocolate in
the <hi>Hay-Market,</hi> they have only improved upon the <hi>Ring,</hi> the
<hi>Spring-Gardens,</hi> the <hi>New-Exchange</hi> Aſſignations, and the
Morning Puppet-ſhew, which employed the attention of their grandmothers: and
as it is not apparent that our people of faſhion are more wicked, ſo
neither are they wiſer than their predeceſſors.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="129" facs="tcp:1252700301:134"/>WHEN I contemplate the manner in which
the younger part of the polite world is brought up, I am apt to carry my
reflections farther than what merely concerns their own perſons. Let our
young men of faſhion expoſe their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance abroad, rather than improve at
our Univerſities at home;—let them trifle away their Time in inſipid
amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and run looſe about the town in one continued round of
extravagance and debauchery;—let our young ladies be taught nothing but
gallantry and whiſt, and be ſeen only at routes and aſſemblies, if the
conſequence extend not beyond themſelves. But as theſe are to be the
fathers and mothers, the guardians and tutors, on whom the morals of our next
race muſt depend; it becomes a public concern, leſt the reign of vice and
ignorance ſhould be ſupported, as it were, by hereditary ſucceſſion,
and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated to diſtant generations.</p>
                     <p>THE modern method of education is indeed ſo little
cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to promote virtue and learning, that it is almoſt impoſſible
the children ſhould be wiſer or better than their parents. The country
'ſquire ſeldom fails of ſeeing his ſon as dull and aukward a looby as
himſelf; while the debauch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or foppiſh man of quality breeds up a rake or
an empty coxcomb, who brings new diſeaſes into the family, and freſh
mortgages on the eſtate. If you would therefore favour us, Mr. TOWN, with a
few remarks on this ſubject, you would do ſervice to poſterity: for the
preſent, give me leave to illuſtrate what I have ſaid by the example of a
very faſhionable family.</p>
                     <p>LADY BELLE MODELY was one of the fineſt women in the laſt
reign, as the Colonel her huſband was one of the ſmarteſt fellows. After
they had aſtoniſhed the world ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gly with the <hi>eclat</hi> of their
actions, they came together: her <pb n="130" facs="tcp:1252700301:135"/> ladyſhip was proud of
fixing a man who was thought to have intrigued with half the women of
faſhion; while the Colonel fell a ſacrifice to her beauty, only becauſe
ſhe was admired by every body elſe. They lived together for ſome time in
great ſplendor; but as matrimony was a conſtraint upon their freedom, they
at length parted by a private agreement. Lady BELLE keeps the beſt company,
is at the head of every party of pleaſure, never miſſes a maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade,
and has card-tables conſtantly at her own houſe on Sundays. The Colonel is
one of the oldeſt members of the Club at <hi>White</hi>'s, runs horſes at
<hi>Newmarket,</hi> has an act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſs in keeping, and is protected from the
impertinence of duns, by having purchaſed a ſeat in parliament at almoſt
as great an expence as would have ſatisfied the demands of his creditors.</p>
                     <p>THEY have two children: the one has been educated by the
direction of his father, the other has been bred up under the eye of her mamma.
The boy was indeed put to a grammar-ſchool for a while; but <hi>Latin</hi>
and <hi>Greek</hi> or indeed any language except <hi>French,</hi> are of no
ſervice to a gentleman: and as the lad had diſcovered early marks of
ſpirit, (ſuch as kicking down wheel-barrows and ſetting old women on
their heads,) the Colonel ſwore <hi>Jack</hi> ſhould be a ſoldier, and
accordingly begged a pair of colours for him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was fifteen. The
Colonel who had ſerved only in the peaceful campaigns of <hi>Covent
Garden,</hi> took great pains to inſtil into <hi>Jack</hi> all that proweſs
ſo remarkable in the modern heroes of the army. He enumerated his victories
over bullies, his encounters with ſharpers, his midnight ſkirmiſhes with
conſtables, his ſtorming of bagnio's, his impriſonment in round-houſes,
and his honourable wounds in the ſervice of proſtitutes. The Captain could
not fail of improving under ſo excellent a tutor, and ſoon became as 
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1252700301:136"/> eminent as his father. He is a Blood of the firſt
rate; <hi>Sherlock</hi> has inſtructed him in the uſe of the broad ſword,
and <hi>Broughton</hi> has taught him to box. He is a fine Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man at
aſſemblies, a ſharper at the gaming-table, and a bully at the bagnios. He
has not yet killed his man in the <hi>honourable</hi> way; but he has gallantly
crippled ſeveral watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and moſt couragiouſly run a drawer through
the body. His ſcanty pay will not allow him to keep a miſtreſs; but it is
ſaid that he is privately married to a woman of the town.</p>
                     <p>SUCH is the conſequence of the ſon's education; and by
this our people of diſtinction may learn, how much better it is to let a lad
ſee the world (as the phraſe is) than to laſh him through a
grammar-ſchool like a pariſh-boy, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine him with dull pedants in a
college cloiſter. Lady BELLE has not been leſs careful of her daughter
Miſs HARRIOT. Thoſe who undertake the buſineſs of educating polite
females have laid it down as a rule to conſider women merely as Dolls; and
therefore never attempt the cultivation of their principles, but employ their
whole attention on adorning their perſons. The romantic notions of honour and
virtue are only fit for poor aukward creatures, who are to marry a ſhopkeeper
or a parſon, but they can be of no uſe to a fine girl who is deſign'd to
make a figure. Accordingly Miſs HARRIOT was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the care of
<hi>Madame Governante</hi> who never ſuffered her to ſpeak a word of
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> and a <hi>French</hi> dancing-maſter who taught her to
hold up her head, and come into the room like a little lady. As ſhe grew up,
her mamma in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed her in the niceſt points of ceremony and good
breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: ſhe explained to her the laws and regulations of dreſs; directed
her in the choice of her brocades, told her what faſhions beſt became her,
and what colours beſt ſuited her complexion. Theſe excellent rules were
conſtantly enforced <pb n="132" facs="tcp:1252700301:137"/> by examples drawn from her
ladyſhip's own practice: above all, ſhe unravelled the various arts of
gallantry and intrigue; recounted the ſtratagems ſhe had herſelf employed
in gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing new conqueſts, taught her when to advance and when to retreat,
and how far ſhe might venture to indulge herſelf in certain freedoms
without endangering her reputation.</p>
                     <p>MISS HARRIOT ſoon became the public admiration of all the
pretty fellows, and was allowed to be a lady of the moſt elegant
accompliſhments. She was reckoned to play a better game at Whiſt than Mrs.
<hi>Sharply,</hi> and bets with more ſpirit at Brag than the bold Lady
<hi>Atall.</hi> She was carried about to <hi>Tunbridge, Bath, Cheltenham,</hi>
and every other place of diverſion by the mother; where ſhe was expoſed
as at a public mart for beauty, and put up to the beſt bidder. But as Miſs
had ſome fortune in her own diſpoſal, ſhe had not the patience to wait
the formal delays of marriage articles, jointures, ſettlements, and
pin-money; and (juſt before the late Act took place) eloped with a gentleman,
who had long been very intimate with her mamma, and recommended himſelf to
MISS HARRIOT by a ſtature of ſix foot and a ſhoulder-knot.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>WHEREVER the Town goes, thoſe who live by the Town naturally
follow: the facetious and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining gentry, who during the winter amuſed
the world within the bills of mortality, are now diſperſed into differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
parts of the country. We have had moſt of them here already. The
<hi>Coloſſus,</hi> the <hi>Dwarf,</hi> the <hi>Female Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> made
ſome ſtay with us. We went for a week toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſee Mr.
<hi>Powell</hi> eat red hot tobacco pipes, and ſwallow fire and brimſtone:
the <hi>Hermaphrodite</hi> was obliged to leave the town on a ſcandalous
report, that a lady uſed fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to viſit him in private. Mr.
<hi>Church</hi> for ſome time charmed us with concertos and ſonatas on the
Jew's-Harp; and at our laſt ball we footed it to our uſual melody of the
Tabor and Pipe, accompanied with the Cymbal and Wooden Spoons.</p>
                     <p>I WILL not tire you with a particular detail of all our
Entertainments, but confine myſelf at preſent to thoſe of the Stage.
About the middle of laſt month, there came <pb n="135" facs="tcp:1252700301:140"/> among us
one of thoſe gentlemen, who are famous for the cure of every diſtemper, and
eſpecially thoſe pronounced incurable by the Faculty. The vulgar call him a
<hi>Mounte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank</hi>;—and when I conſidered his impaſſioned
ſpeeches, and the extempore ſtage from which he uttered them, I was apt to
compare them to <hi>Theſpis</hi> and his Cart. Again, when I beheld the
Doctor dealing out his drugs, and at the ſame time ſaw his <hi>Merry
Andrew</hi> play over his tricks it put me in mind of a Tragi-Comedy, where the
pathetic and the ludicrous are ſo intimately connected, and the whole piece
is ſo merry and ſo ſad, that the audience is at a loſs whether they
ſhall laugh or cry.</p>
                     <p>AFTER the Doctor had been here ſome time, there came down
two or three emiſſaries from a Strolling Company, in order (according to
the Player's phraſe) to <hi>take the Town</hi>; but the Mayor being a
ſtrict Preſbyterian, abſolutely refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to licence their exhibitions.
The Players you muſt know finding this a good town, had taken a leaſe
laſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of an old Synagogue deſerted by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and were
therefore much alarmed at this diſappointment: but when they were in the
utmoſt deſpair, the ladies of the place joined in a petition to Mrs.
Mayoreſs, who prevailed on her huſband to wink at their performances. The
Company immediately opened their Synagogue-Theatre with the <hi>Merchant of
Venice</hi>; and finding the Doctor's <hi>Zany</hi> a droll fellow, they
decoyed him into their ſervice; and he has ſince performed the part of the
<hi>Mock Doctor</hi> with univerſal applauſe. Upon his revolt the Doctor
himſelf found it abſolutely neceſſary to enter of the Company, and
having a talent for Tragedy has performed with great ſucceſs the Apothecary
in <hi>Romeo and Juliet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="136" facs="tcp:1252700301:141"/>THE Performers at our Ruſtic Theatre
are far beyond thoſe paltry Strollers, who run about the country, and exhibit
in a barn or a cowhouſe: for (as their bills declare) they are a Company of
Comedians from the Theatres Royal; and I aſſure you, they are as much
applauded by our country critics, as any of your capital actors. The ſhops of
our tradeſmen have been almoſt deſerted, and a croud of weavers and
hardware-men have elbowed each other two hours before the opening of the doors,
when the bills have informed us in enormous red letters that the part of
<hi>George Barnwell</hi> was to be performed by Mr. —, at the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
deſire of ſeveral ladies of diſtinction. It is true in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that our
principal actors have moſt of them had their education in <hi>Covent
Garden</hi> or <hi>Drury Lane</hi>; but they have been employed in the
buſineſs of the Drama in a degree but juſt above a Scene-ſhifter. An
heroine, to whom your managers in town (in envy to her riſing merit) ſcarce
allotted the humble part of a Confidante, now blubbers out <hi>Andromache</hi>
or <hi>Belvidera:</hi> the attendants on a monarch now ſtrut monarchs
themſelves, mutes find their voices, and meſſage-bearers riſe into
heroes. The humour of our beſt Commedian conſiſts in ſhrugs and
grimaces; he jokes in a wry mouth, and repartees in a grin: in ſhort he
practiſes on <hi>Congreve</hi> and <hi>Vanbrugh</hi> all thoſe
diſtortions, which gained him ſo much applauſe from the galleries in the
drubs which he was condemned to undergo in Pantomimes. I was vaſtly diverted
at ſeeing a fellow in the character of Sir <hi>Harry Wildair,</hi> whoſe
chief action was a continual preſſing together of the thumb and
fore-finger, which, had he lifted them to his noſe, I ſhould have thought
he deſigned as an imitation of taking ſnuff: but I could eaſily account
for the cauſe of this ſingular geſture, when I diſcovered 
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1252700301:142"/> that Sir <hi>Harry</hi> was no leſs a perſon than
the dextrous Mr. <hi>Clippit</hi> the Candle-ſnuffer.</p>
                     <p>YOU would laugh to ſee how ſtrangely the parts of a play
are caſt. They played <hi>Cato</hi>; and their <hi>Marcia</hi> was ſuch an
old woman, that when <hi>Juba</hi> came on with his— 
<q rend="inline">"Hail! charming maid!"</q>—the fellow
could not help laughing. Another night I was ſurprized to hear an eager lover
talk of ruſhing into his miſtreſs's arms, rioting on the nectar of her
lips, and deſiring (in the tragedy rapture) to hug her thus and thus for
ever; though he always took care to ſtand at a moſt ceremonious diſtance.
But I was afterwards very much diverted at the cauſe of this extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary
reſpect, when I was told that the lady laboured under the misfortune of an
ulcer in her leg, which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned ſuch a diſagreable ſtench that the
performers were obliged to keep her at arm's length. The entertainment was
<hi>Lethe:</hi> and the part of the <hi>Frenchman</hi> was performed by a
<hi>South-Briton,</hi> who, as he could not pronounce a word of the
<hi>French</hi> language, ſupplied its place by gabbling in his native
<hi>Welch.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Decorations, or (in the Theatrical dialect) the
<hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty</hi> of our Company is as extraordinary as the Performers.
<hi>Othello</hi> raves about a checked handkerchief, the Ghoſt in
<hi>Hamlet</hi> ſtalks in a poſtilion's leather jacket for a coat of mail,
and <hi>Cupid</hi> enters with a fiddle-caſe ſlung over his ſhoulders for
a quiver. The apothecary of the town is free of the houſe for lending them a
peſtle and mortar to ſerve as the bell in <hi>Venice Preſerved</hi>; and
a barber-ſurgeon has the ſame privilege for furniſhing them baſons of
blood to beſmear the daggers in <hi>Macheth. Macheth</hi> himſelf carries a
rolling-pin in his hand for a truncheon, and as the <pb n="138" facs="tcp:1252700301:143"/>
breaking of glaſſes would be very expenſive, he daſhes down a pewter
pint pot at the ſight of <hi>Banquo</hi>'s ghoſt.</p>
                     <p>A FRAY happened here the other night, which was no ſmall
diverſion to the company. It ſeems there had been a great conteſt between
two of theſe mimic heroes, which was the fitteſt to play <hi>Richard the
Third.</hi> One of them was reckoned to have the better perſon, as he was
very round ſhoulder'd, and one of his legs was ſhorter than the other; but
his antagoniſt carried the part, becauſe he ſtarted beſt in the
Tent-Scene. However, when the curtain drew up, they both ruſhed in upon the
ſcene at once, and bawling out together 
<q rend="inline">"Now are our brows bound with victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
wreaths,"</q> they both went through the whole ſpeech without ſtopping.</p>

world. A Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> made himſelf remarkable by a
Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe on Horſemanſhip; a <hi>Rocheſter</hi> ſupplied the place of
<hi>Ovid</hi> in the cloſets of men of pleaſure; and even the ladies of
former ages ſacrificed to love in Novels and Romances.—I will not
mention a <hi>Shaftſbury,</hi> as our preſent age has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a
<hi>Bolinbroke.</hi>—We of this generation are wiſer than to ſuffer
our youth of quality to loſe their precious time in ſtudying the <hi>belles
lettres,</hi> while our only care is to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <pb n="140" facs="tcp:1252700301:145"/> them
into the <hi>beau monde.</hi> A modern peer, inſtead of laying down the
theory of horſemanſhip, is perfect in the practice, and commences jockey
himſelf; and our rakes of faſhion are content with acting the ſcenes
which <hi>Rocheſter</hi> deſcribed. Our ladies are, indeed, very well
qualified to publiſh a recital of amours; and one in particular has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
entertained the world with memoirs of her own intrigues, cuckoldoms and
elopements.</p>
               <p>I AM very glad to find the preſent age ſo entirely free from
pedantry: ſome part of the polite world read indeed, but they are ſo wiſe
as to read only for amuſement; or at leaſt only to improve themſelves in
the more modern and faſhionable ſciences. A Treatiſe on Whiſt has more
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers than a Syſtem of Logic, and a New Atalantis would be more
univerſally read than a Practice of Piety. A fine gentleman or lady would no
more chuſe the mind of a pedant, than the perſon of a cook-maid or a
porter. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not therefore but approve of the plan laid down by the writer of
the following letter, and would recommend it to all perſons of faſhion to
ſubſcribe to his propoſals.</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>To Mr. TOWN.</head>
                     <opener>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I HAVE long obſerved with infinite regret the little care
that is taken to ſupply perſons of diſtinction with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per books for
their inſtruction and amuſement. It is no wonder that they ſhould be ſo
averſe to ſtudy, when learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is rendered ſo diſagreeable. Common
creatures indeed, as ſoon as they can ſpell, may be made to read a dull
chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Teſtament; after which the Whole Duty of Man, or ſome other
uſeleſs good book, may be put into their hands: <pb n="141" facs="tcp:1252700301:146"/> but
theſe can never inſtruct a man of the world to ſay fine things to a lady,
or to ſwear with a good grace. Among a few dirty pedants the knowledge of
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> may be cultivated; but among fine gentlemen
theſe are juſtly diſcarded for <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian.</hi> Why
ſhould perſons of quality trouble themſelves about Mathematics and
Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, or throw away their time in ſcratching circles and triangles
on a ſlate, and then rubbing them out again? All the Algebra requiſite for
them to know, is the combi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of figures on the dice; nor could
<hi>Euclid</hi> be of any uſe to them, except he had repreſented the moſt
graceful attitudes in fencing, or drawn out the lines of a minuet.</p>
                     <p>IN order to remedy theſe inconveniences, and that the
erudition of perſons of faſhion may be as different from the vulgar
knowledge of the reſt of mankind as their dreſs, I have formed a project
for regulating their ſtudies. An old crabbed Philoſopher once told a
monarch, that there was no Royal way of learning the Mathematics:—Firſt
then, as to the muſty volumes which contain <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> and the
Sciences, (ſince there is no genteel method of coming at the knowledge of
them,) I would baniſh them intirely from the polite world, and have them
chained down in univerſity libraries, the only places where they can be
uſeful or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining. Having thus cleared the ſhelves of this learned
lumber, we ſhall have room to fill them more elegantly. To this end I have
collected all ſuch books as are proper to be peruſed by people of quality,
and ſhall ſhortly make my Scheme public by opening a handſome room under
the title of the <hi>Polite Circulating Library.</hi> Many of my books are
entirely new and original: all the modern novels, and moſt of the periodical
papers fall ſo directly in with my plan, that they will be ſure to find a
place in my library; and <pb n="142" facs="tcp:1252700301:147"/> if Mr. TOWN ſhews himſelf
an encourager of my ſcheme, I ſhall expect to ſee peers and peereſſes
take up the pen, and ſhine in the CONNOISSEUR.</p>
                     <p>I INTEND in the beginning of the winter to publiſh my
propoſals at large, and in the mean time beg you to ſubmit the following

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> LITTLE <hi>Frenchman,</hi> commonly known in town by the name
of <hi>Count,</hi> and whoſe figure has been long ſtuck up in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of printſhops, was always remarkable for the meanneſs and at the ſame
time the foppery of his appearance. His ſhoes, though perhaps capped at the
toe, had red heels to them; and his ſtock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, though often full of holes,
were conſtantly rolled up over his knees. By good luck he was once maſter
of half a guinea; and having a great longing for a feather to his hat, and a
very preſſing neceſſity for a pair of breeches, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated with
himſelf about the diſpoſal of his money. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever his vanity got the
better of his neceſſity; and the next <pb n="146" facs="tcp:1252700301:151"/> time the
<hi>Count</hi> appeared in the Mall, by the ornaments of his head you would
have imagined him a Beau, and by the nether part of his dreſs you would have
taken him for a Heathen Philoſopher.</p>
               <p>THE conduct of this <hi>Frenchman,</hi> however ridiculous, is
copied by a multitude of people in this town. To the ſame little pride of
deſiring to appear finer than they can afford, are owing the many ruſty
ſuits of black, the tyes that ſeem taken from the baſket of a ſhoeboy,
and the ſmart waiſtcoats edged with a narrow cord, which ſerves as an
apology for lace. I know a man of this caſt who has but one coat; but by now
and then turning the cuffs, and chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cape, it paſſes for two. He
uſes the ſame artifice with his peruke, which is naturally a kind of
flowing Bob; but by the occaſional addition of two tails to it, it
ſometimes appears as a Major. Of this ſort of men are compoſed the
numerous fraternity of the ſhabby-genteel, who are the chief ſupport of the
clothiers in <hi>Monmouth-ſtreet,</hi> and the barbers in <hi>Middle
Row.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WOMEN are naturally ſo fond of ornament, that it is no wonder
we ſhould meet with ſo many ſecond-hand gentry in that ſex. Hence
ariſe the red-armed Belles that appear in the Park every Sunday; hence it is
that Sacks and Peten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lairs may be ſeen at <hi>Moor-Fields</hi> and
<hi>Whitechapel</hi>; and that thoſe, who are ambitious to ſhine in
diamonds, glitter in paſte and Scotch pebbles. When I ſee the wives and
daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of tradeſmen and mechanics make ſuch attempts at finery, I
cannot help pitying their poor fathers and huſbands, and at the ſame time
am apt to conſider their dreſs as a robbery on the ſhop. Thus when I
obſerve the tawdry gentility of a tallow-chandler's daughter, I look upon her
as hung round with long ſixes, ſhort eights, and ruſh-lights; and If I
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template <pb n="147" facs="tcp:1252700301:152"/> the aukward pride of dreſs in a butcher's
wife, I ſuppoſe her carrying about her ſirloins of beef, fillets of veal,
and ſhoulders of mutton. I was vaſtly diverted with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery I made a
few days ſince. Going upon ſame buſineſs to a tradeſman's houſe, I
ſurprized in a very extraordinary diſhabille two females, whom I had been
frequently uſed to ſee ſtrangely dizened out in the Mall. Theſe fine
Ladies, it ſeems, were no other than my honeſt friend's daughters; and one,
who always dreſſes the family-dinner, was gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teelly employed in winding up
the jack, while the other was up to the elbows in ſoap-ſuds.</p>
               <p>A DESIRE of grandeur and magnificence is often abſurd in
thoſe who can ſupport it; but when it takes hold of thoſe who can
ſcarce furniſh themſelves with neceſſaries, their poverty, inſtead
of demanding our pity, becomes an object of ridicule. Many families among
thoſe who are called middling people, are not content without living
elegantly as well as comfortably, and often involve themſelves in very
comical diſtreſſes. When they aim at appearing grand in the eye of the
world, they grow proportionably mean and ſordid in private. I went the other
day to dine with an old friend; and as he uſed to keep a remarkable good
table, I was ſurprized that I could ſcarce make a meal with him. After
dinner he rung the bell, and ordered the chariot to be got ready at ſix; and
then turning to me with an air of ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, aſked if he ſhould ſet
me down. Here the riddle was out; and I found that his equipage had eat up his
table, and that he was obliged to ſtarve his family to feed his horſes.</p>
               <p>I AM acquainted with another family, where the maſter keeps an
account againſt himſelf. This account is exactly ſtated in a large
ledger-book. What he ſaves from his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary expences he places under the
title of DEBTOR, and what <pb n="148" facs="tcp:1252700301:153"/> he runs out is ranged under
CREDITOR. I had lately an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of turning over this curious account,
and could not help ſmiling at many of the articles. Among the reſt I
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the following, with which I ſhall preſent the reader.</p>

                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:1252700301:154"/>TRUE oeconomy does not merely conſiſt
in not exceeding our income, but in ſuch a judicious management of it as
renders our whole appearance equal and conſiſtent. We ſhould laugh at a
nobleman, who to ſupport the expence of running horſes ſhould abridge his
ſet to a pair, and that his jockey's might come in firſt for the plate be
content to have his family dragged to his country-ſeat, like ſervant-maids
in the Caravan. There are many well-meaning peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who have the pride of
living in a polite quarter of the town, though they are diſtreſſed to pay
the taxes: and what is more common than to ſee one particular room in an
houſe furniſhed like a palace, while the reſt have ſcarce the
neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary accommodations of an inn? ſuch a conduct appears to me equally
ridiculous with that of the <hi>Frenchman,</hi> who (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the jeſt)
for the ſake of wearing ruffles is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to go without a ſhirt.</p>
               <p>THIS endeavour to appear grander than our circumſtances will
allow, is no where ſo contemptible as among thoſe men of pleaſure about
town, who have not fortunes in any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their ſpirit. Men of
quality have wiſely contrived that their ſins ſhould be expenſive: for
which reaſon thoſe, who with equal taſte have leſs money, are obliged
to be oeconomiſts in their ſins, and are put to many little ſhifts to
appear tolerably profligate and debauched. They get a knowledge of the names
and faces of the moſt noted women upon town, and pretend an intimate
acquaintance with them, though they know none of that order of ladies above the
draggle-tailed proſtitutes who walk the <hi>Strand.</hi> They talk very
familiarly of the <hi>King's Arms,</hi> and are in raptures with Mrs.
<hi>Allen</hi>'s Claret; though they always dine ſnugly at a Chop-houſe,
and ſpend their evening at an Ale-houſe or Cyder-cellar. The moſt
ridiculous character I know of <pb n="150" facs="tcp:1252700301:155"/> this ſort is a young
fellow, the ſon of a rich tobacconiſt in the city, who (becauſe it is the
faſhion) has taken a girl into keeping. He knows the world better than to
ſet her up a chariot, or let her have money at her own diſpoſal. He
regulates her expences with the niceſt oeconomy, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys every morning
in ſetting down what is laid out upon her. He very ſeriouſly takes an
account of Rolls and Butter, two-pence.—For Ribband, one ſhilling and
four pence.—Pins, a half-penny, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> Thus does he
reconcile his extravagance and frugality to each other, and is as penurious and
exact as an uſurer, that he may be as genteel and as wicked as a lord.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> GENTLEMAN of my acquaintance lately laid before me an
eſtimate of the conſumption of bread and cheeſe, cakes, ale, &amp;c. in
all the little towns near <hi>London</hi> every Sunday. It is incredible how
many thouſand buns are devoured in that one day at <hi>Chelſea</hi> and
<hi>Paddington</hi>; and how much beer is ſwallowed at <hi>Pancras</hi> and
<hi>Mile End.</hi> Upon the whole I was vaſtly entertained with a review of
this eſtimate, and could not help approving the obſervation of <hi>Tom
Brown,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"that the Sabbath is a very fine inſtitution,
ſince the very breaking it is the ſupport of half the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages about our
metropolis."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:1252700301:157"/>OUR common people are very obſervant of
that part of the commandment, which enjoins them to do no manner of work on
that day, which they alſo ſeem to underſtand as a licence to devote it to
pleaſure. They take this opportunity of thruſting their heads into the
pillory at <hi>Georgia,</hi> being ſworn at <hi>Highgate,</hi> and rolling
down <hi>Flamſtead Hill</hi> in the Park at <hi>Greenwich.</hi> As they all
aim at going into the country, nothing can be a greater misfortune to the
meaner part of the inhabitants of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>
than a rainy Sunday; and how many honeſt people would be baulked of a ride
once a week, if the legiſlature was to limit the hired one-horſe-chaiſes
working on that day to a certain number as well as the hackney coaches.</p>
               <p>THE ſubſtantial tradeſman is carried to his ſnug-box,
which has nothing rural about it except the ivy that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runs the front, and
is placed as near to the road ſide as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, where the pleaſure of
ſeeing carriages paſs under his window amply compenſates for his being
almoſt ſmothered with duſt. The few ſmart 'prentices, who are able to
ſit a horſe, may be ſeen ſpurring their broken-winded hacks up the
hills; and the good-natured huſband together with his mate is dragged along
the road to the envy and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the foot-paſſenger, who (to
compleat the Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day picture) trudges patiently with a child in one arm, while
his beloved doxy leans on the other and waddles at his ſide ſweltering
beneath the unuſual weight of an hoop-petticoat.</p>
               <p>IT is not to be ſuppoſed, that the country has in itſelf
any peculiar attractive charms to thoſe who think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of the
world, if they are not within the ſound of <hi>Bow Bell.</hi> To moſt of
our Cockneys it ſerves only as an excuſe for eating and drinking; and they
get out of town, <pb n="153" facs="tcp:1252700301:158"/> merely becauſe they have nothing to
do at home; a brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiln ſmells as ſweet to them as a farm-yard: they would
paſs by a barn or a hay-ſtack without notice; but they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice at the
ſight of every hedge ale-houſe, that promiſes good home-brew'd. As the
reſt of a cit's life is regular and uniform, his Sunday diverſions have as
little variety; and if he was to take a journal of them, we might ſuppoſe
that it would run much in the following manner.</p>

               <p>AS to perſons of quality, like Lady <hi>Loverule</hi> in the
farce, they can not ſee why one day ſhould be more holy than ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther:
therefore Sunday wears the ſame face with them as the reſt of the week.
Accordingly, for ſome part of this ſummer <hi>Ranelagh</hi> was opened on
Sunday evenings; and I cannot help wondering that the cuſtom did not
continue. It muſt have been very convenient to paſs away the time there;
till the hour of meeting at the card-table; and it was certainly more decent to
fix aſſignations, there, than at church.</p>
               <p>GOING to Church may indeed be reckoned among our Sunday
amuſements, as it is made a mere matter of diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion among many
well-meaning people, who are induced to appear in a place of worſhip from the
ſame motives that they frequent other public places. To ſome it anſwers
all the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of a route or aſſembly,—to ſee and be ſeen by
their acquaintance; and from their bows, nods, curt'ſies, and loud
converſations one might conclude that they imagined them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a
drawing-room. To others it affords the cheap op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſhewing their
taſte for dreſs: not a few, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, are drawn together in our
cathedrals and larger churches by the influence of the muſic more than the
prayers, and are kept awake by a jig from the organ-loft, tho they lulled to
ſleep by the harangue from the pulpit. A well diſpoſed Chriſtian will
go a mile from his own houſe to the Temple-Church, <pb n="155" facs="tcp:1252700301:160"/>
Church, not becauſe a <hi>Sherlock</hi> is to preach, but to hear a Solo from
<hi>Stanley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BUT though going to church may be deemed a kind of amuſement,
yet upon modern principles it appears ſuch a very odd one, that I am at at a
loſs to account for the reaſons which induced our anceſtors to give into
that method of paſſing their Sunday. At leaſt it is ſo wholly
incompatible with the polite ſyſtem of life, that a perſon of faſhion
(as affairs are now managed) finds it abſolutely impoſſible to comply
with this practice. Then again the ſervice always begins at ſuch
unfaſhionable hours, that in the morning a man muſt huddle on his cloaths
like a boy to run to ſchool, and in an afternoon muſt inevitably go without
his dinner. In order to remove all theſe objections, and that ſome Ritual
may be eſtabliſhed in this kingdom agreeable to our inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and
conſiſtent with our practice, the following SCHEME has been lately ſent
me in order to ſubmit it to the ſerious conſideration of the public.</p>
               <q> 
                  <list>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Imprimis,</hi> IT is humbly propoſed, that
Chriſtianity be entirely aboliſhed by Act of Parliament, and that no other
religion be impoſed on us in it's ſtead; but as the age grows daily more
and more enlightened, we may at laſt be quite delivered from the influence of
ſuperſtition and bigotry.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Secondly,</hi> THAT in order to prevent our ever
relapſing into pious errors, that the common people may not loſe their
holiday, every Sunday be ſet apart to commemorate our victory over all
religion; that the Churches be turned into Free-thinking Meeting-Houſes, and
diſcourſes read in them to confute the Doctrine of a future ſtate, the
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality of the ſoul, and other abſurd notions which ſome people now
regard as objects of belief.</item>
                     <item>
                        <pb n="156" facs="tcp:1252700301:161"/>
                        <hi>Thirdly,</hi> THAT a Ritual be
compiled exactly oppoſite to our preſent Liturgy; and that inſtead of
reading portions of Scripture, the firſt and ſecond leſſons ſhall
conſiſt of a Section of the Poſthumous Works of Lord <hi>Bolinbroke,</hi>
or of a few pages from the writings of <hi>Spinoza, Chubb, Maundeville, Hobbes,
Collins, Tindal, &amp;c.</hi> from which writers the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhall alſo
take their text.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Fourthly,</hi> THAT the uſual Feaſts and Faſts,
viz. Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Day, Eaſter Sunday, Trinity Sunday, &amp;c. be ſtill
preſerved; but that on thoſe days diſcourſes be delivered ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to the occaſion, containing a refutation of the Nativity, the Reſurrection,
the Trinity, &amp;c.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Fifthly,</hi> THAT inſtead of the vile melody of a
Clerk bawling out two Staves of <hi>Sternhold</hi> and <hi>Hopkins,</hi> or a
Cathedral Choir ſinging Anthems from the Pſalter, ſome of the moſt
faſhionable Cantatas, Opera Airs, Songs, or Catches, be performed by the
beſt voices for the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of the company.</item>
                     <item>
                        <hi>Laſtly,</hi> THAT the whole Service be conducted
with ſuch taſte and elegance as may render theſe Free-thinking
Meeting-Houſes as agreeable as the Theatres; and that they may be even more

the <hi>Robin Hood</hi> Society or the Oratory in <hi>Clare Market.</hi>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is a heavy tax upon authors that they ſhould always be
expected to write ſenſe. Some few indeed, who are rich in ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, pay
this tax very chearfully, but the generality endeavour one way or another to
elude it. For this purpoſe ſome have moulded their pieces into the form of
wings, axes, eggs, and altars; while others have laced down the ſide of a
copy of verſes with the letters of their miſtreſs's name, and called it
an acroſtic: not to mention the curious inventions of rebuſſes and
anagrams. For the ſame reaſons, the modern ſong-writers for our public
gardens, who are our principal love-poets at preſent, entertain us with
ſonnets and madigrals in <pb n="158" facs="tcp:1252700301:163"/> Crambo. Authors who promiſe
wit, pay us off with puns and quibbles; and with our writers of comedy, long
ſwords, ſhort jerkins, and tables with carpets over them paſs for
incident and humour.</p>
               <p>BUT no artifice of this ſort has been ſo often and ſo
ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully practiced as the immoderate uſe of uncouth terms and
expreſſions. Words that mean nothing, provided they ſound big, and fill
the ear, are the beſt ſuccedanium for ſenſe. Nothing ſo effectually
anſwers Mr. <hi>Bayes</hi>'s endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to <hi>elevate and ſurprize</hi>;
and the reader, tho' he ſees nothing but ſtraws float on the ſurface,
candidly ſuppoſes that there are pearls and diamonds at the bottom. Several
dull authors by availing themſelves of this ſecret have paſſed for very
deep writers, and arrant Nonſenſe has as often laid ſnugly beneath hard
words, as a ſhallow pate beneath the ſolemn appearance of a full-bottomed
periwig.</p>
               <p>THOSE who are employed in what they call abſtract
ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations moſt commonly have recourſe to this method. Their
diſſertations are naturally expected to illuſtrate and explain, but this
is ſometimes a taſk above their abilities; and when they have led the
reader into a maze, from which they cannot deliver him, they very wiſely
bewilder him the more. This is the caſe with thoſe profound writers who
have treated concerning the eſſence of matter, who talk very gravely of
cuppeity, tableity, tallow-chandleity, and twenty other things with as much
ſound and as little ſignification. Of theſe we may very well ſay with
the poet, 
<q> 
                     <l>Such labour'd nothings in ſo ſtrange a ſtile,</l> 
                     <l>Amaze th'unlearn'd, and make the learned ſmile.</l> 
                     <bibl>POPE.</bibl>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:1252700301:164"/>NO mode of expreſſion throws ſuch an
impenetrable miſt over a work as an unneceſſary profuſion of Technical
Terms. This will appear very plainly to thoſe who will turn over a few pages
of a modern Collection of Voyages. Deſcriptions of a ſtorm make ſome of
the fineſt and moſt ſtriking paſſages in the beſt poets, and it is
for theſe in particular that <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginus</hi> admires the
<hi>Odyſſey.</hi> The real circumſtances of a ſtorm are in themſelves
without the aid of poetical ornaments very affecting, yet whoever reads an
account of them in any of our writers of Voyages, will be ſo puzzled and
perplexed with <hi>Starboard</hi> and <hi>Larboard,</hi> the
<hi>Main-maſt</hi> and <hi>Mizen-maſt,</hi> and a multitude of Sea-terms,
that he will not be the leaſt moved at the diſtreſs of the ſhip's crew.
The abſurdity of this did not eſcape <hi>Swift,</hi> who has ridiculed it
by a mock deſcription of the ſame kind in his <hi>Gulliver.</hi> Thoſe
who treat military ſubjects are equally ridiculous: they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelm you with
<hi>Counterſcarps, Paliſades, Baſtions,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo fortify
their no-meaning with hard words, that it is abſolutely impoſſible to
beat them out of their intrenchments. Such writers, who abound in Technical
Terms, always put me in mind of <hi>Ignoramus</hi> in the play, who courts his
miſtreſs out of the law-dictionary, runs over a long catalogue of the
meſſuages, lands, tenements, barns, outhouſes, &amp;c. of which he will
put her in poſſeſſion, if ſhe will <hi>join iſſue</hi> with him,
and manifeſts his paſſion in the ſame manner that he would draw up a
leaſe.</p>
               <p>THIS affectation is never more offenſive than when it gets
into the Pulpit. The greater part of almoſt every audience that ſits under
our preachers are ignorant and illiterate, and ſhould therefore have every
thing delivered to them in as plain, ſimple, and intelligible a manner as
poſſible. Hard words, if they have any meaning, can only 
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1252700301:165"/> ſerve to make them ſtare, and they can never be
edified by what they do not underſtand. Young clergymen juſt come from the
Univerſity, are proud of ſhewing the world that they have been reading the
Fathers, and are fond of entering on the moſt abſtruſe points of
Divinity. But they would employ their time more to their own credit as well as
the improvement of their hearers, if they would rather endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to explain
and inforce the precepts of the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, than retail the
confuſed hypotheſes of crab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed metaphyſicians.</p>
               <p>AS to eſſays, and all other pieces that come under the
denomination of familiar writings, one would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that they muſt
neceſſarily be written in the eaſy language of Nature and Common-Senſe.
No writer can flatter himſelf that his productions will be an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part
of the equipage of the tea-table, who writes almoſt too abſtruſely for
the ſtudy, and involves his thoughts in hard words and affected latiniſms.
Yet this has been reckoned by many the ſtandard ſtile for theſe looſe
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatched pieces. <hi>Addiſon</hi> was proud that he could boaſt of having
drawn learning out of ſchools and colleges into clubs and coffee-houſes, as
<hi>Socrates</hi> was ſaid to draw morality from the clouds to dwell among
men: but theſe people (as Lord <hi>Bolinbroke</hi> pretends to ſay of the
ſame <hi>Socrates</hi>) mount the Clouds themſelves. This new-fangled
manner of delivering our ſentiments is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led writing ſound ſenſe: if
I find this mode ſeems likely to prevail, I ſhall certainly think it
expedient to give into it, and very ſuddenly oblige the world with a
CONNOISSEUR ſo <hi>ſenſible</hi> that it will be impoſſible to
underſtand it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="tcp:1252700301:166"/>BUT hard words and uncouth ways of
expreſſing ourſelves never appear with ſo ill a grace as in our common
converſation: in writings we expect ſome degree of exactneſs and
preciſion, but if even there they ſeem harſh and diſagreeable, when
they obſtruct the freedom of our familiar chat, they either make us laugh or
put us out of patience. However ſome gentlemen, who would be accounted
fine-ſpoken perſons, make uſe of them upon all occaſions, and ſcarce
enquire how you do, or bid you good-morrow in any phraſe that is
intelligible. It always puts me in pain to find a lady give into this practice:
if ſhe makes no blunder, it ſets very ungracefully upon her; but it is ten
to one that the rough uncouth ſyllables that form theſe words are too
harſh and big for the pretty creature's mouth, and then ſhe maims them and
breaks them to her uſe ſo whimſically, that one can ſcarce tell whether
ſhe is talking <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Engliſh.</hi>—I ſhall make no
more reflections on this ſubject at preſent, but conclude my paper with a
ſhort ſtory.</p>
               <p>A MERRY fellow, who was formerly of the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, going
through <hi>Cambridge</hi> on a journey, took it into his head to call on his
old tutor. As it is no great wonder that pedantry ſhould be found in a
college, the tutor uſed to lard his converſation with numberleſs hard
words and forced derivations from the <hi>Latin.</hi> His pupil, who had a mind
to banter the old gentleman on his darling foible, when he viſited him
entered his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers with his hat in one hand, and a dictionary in the other.
The firſt compliments were ſcarce over before the tutor bolted out a word
big enough for the mouth of <hi>Garagantua.</hi> Here the pupil begged that he
would ſtop a little, and after turning over his dictionary deſired him 
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1252700301:167"/> to proceed. The learned gentleman went on, and the pupil
ſeem'd to liſten with great attention, till another word came out as hard
as the former, at which he again interrupted him, and again had recourſe to
his dictionary. This put the Old Don ſo much out of patience, that he roſe
in a rage, and bid him get out of the room for an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant impudent
coxcomb.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">"Take away that old fellow—He would have
carried us to the Round-Houſe—I knocked him down with his own ſtaff,
but I did not think the poor dog would have died by it."</q> When the nurſe
offered him a draught to take, 
<q rend="inline">"Why, ſaid he, will you ply me with
Champagne?—'tis a dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable liquor, and I'll drink no more of it."</q> In
one of his lucid intervals he graſped my hand vehemently, and burſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
into tears, 
<q rend="inline">"Would to God, ſaid he, I had died twenty
years ago."</q> At length his unwilling ſoul parted from the body, and the
laſt words we heard from him were a faint ejaculation to his Maker, whom he
had blaſphemed all his life. His ſhocking exit made me reflect on that fine
paſſage in the ſcriptures, 
<q rend="inline">"Let me die the death of the righteous, and let
my laſt end be like his."</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE behaviour of this unhappy wretch afforded a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
inſtance of the truth of that maxim, There is no hell like a troubled
conſcience. 
<q rend="inline">"There needs indeed no ghoſt to tell us
this:"</q>—but it were to be wiſhed, that the conſcience of every
living reprobate could work on his imagination in the ſame manner, and
raiſe up ſuch horrid apparitions to torment him. Where is the Wretch ſo
hardened, who would not be diſmayed at theſe terrors? Or who could
perſevere in a courſe of wickedneſs, when every freſh offence would
create a new fury to haunt him for his crimes?</p>
               <p>LET us, for inſtance take a view of the moſt glaring
circumſtances in the life of that arch-infidel TOM DARE-DEVIL: and let us at
the ſame time conceive (if poſſible) what pangs he muſt have felt, had
every flagitious act been <pb n="165" facs="tcp:1252700301:170"/> attended with the ſame
phantoms that diſtracted him on his death-bed. Firſt then, let us
contemplate him as a Parracide; for ſo he may be called, who by repeated
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience broke the heart of a moſt affectionate father. Could filial
ingratitude receive a ſharper puniſhment, than in the midſt of his
debaucheries to have this father continually before his eyes, expoſtulating
with him on his unnatural behaviour? O my ſon, (might he hear him ſay) was
it for 
<q rend="inline">"this that thy mother, who died in giving thee
life, begged me with her laſt breath to be kind to the boy? Was it for this,
that the country rung with joy for my being bleſſed with an heir?—O
my child, who can I now call my heir? That eſtate which I was ſo
ſollicitous to improve for thy ſake, is diſſipated among jockeys,
gamblers, pimps, and proſtitutes.—If you ever ſhould have a ſon,
may His ingratitude never make you think of Me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>TOM indeed took care never to have any vexation from children:
He had too great a ſpirit to bear the ſhackles of matrimony, and lived in a
ſtate of celibacy among bagnios. Sometimes he made inroads on private life,
and diſturbed the peace of families by debauching the wives and daughters of
his acquaintance. Among other gallant exploits he decoyed up to town the
daughter of a country gentleman, where he ruined her, and then left her to
linger under an infamous diſeaſe. At length the fruits of his amour
appeared in a child, which ſoon periſhed with it's unhappy parent in a
public hoſpital. By the ſame magic of the fancy let us raiſe up this poor
girl with the infant in her arms, while he is wantoning among his doxies, and
lording it like a Baſhaw over the vaſſals of his luſt. What remorſe
muſt this villain have felt, could he have imagined her to have addreſſed
him in the following terms! 
<q rend="inline">"Behold in the loathſome carcaſe of this
babe the image of thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <pb n="166" facs="tcp:1252700301:171"/> foul, rotten, and
corrupt.—How could I ſuffer ſo contemptible a creature to draw me
from the comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able protection of my parents?—It was juſt that I
ſhould fall a victim to my folly: but was this diſeaſed infant quickened
only to proclaim my diſhonour and thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy?—Why hadſt thou yet the
power left to propagate miſery even to the innocent?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>TOM had often ſignalized himſelf as a duelliſt: his
conſcience, as we have already mentioned, upbraided him at his dying moments
with the murder of a particular friend. He had once ill luck at cards; and
being irritated with his loſſes, and ſuſpecting foul play on the part
of his antagoniſt, he took him by the noſe, which conſequently produced a
challenge. He is haſtening to the field of battle:—but he fancies
himſelf followed by the Manes of his friend, whom on the ſame unhallowed
ground he had lately ſacrificed to that Idol HONOUR. He hears him call—

<q rend="inline">"Turn, mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, turn, and look on Me.—You
may remember with what reluctance I met you—You forced me to the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat—and I was even pleaſed that the victory was yours. You deprived
me of life in an idle quarrel about a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, whom at your return from the
murder of your friend you detected in the arms of another.—It was Honour
that induced you to wound the boſom of one you loved:—The ſame Honour
now calls you to give a fellow whom you deſpiſe, an opportunity to
retaliate the injury done to me.—What folly is it to put your life into
the hands of a ſcoundrel, who you ſuſpect has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready robbed you of your
fortune?—But go on, and let your death rid the world of a monſter, who
is deſperate enough to put his own life on the hazard, and wicked enough to
attempt that of another."</q>—It happened, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that TOM had no
occaſion for ſuch a monitor, as the <pb n="167" facs="tcp:1252700301:172"/> perſon whom he
went to meet proved as great a coward as he was a cheat; and our hero, after
waiting a full hour in his pumps, and parrying with the air, had no other
revenge for the loſs of his money than the ſatisfaction of poſting him
for a ſcoundrel.</p>
               <p>THOUGH the hero of our ſtory was cut off in the prime of his
life, yet he may be ſaid, like <hi>Neſtor,</hi> to have outlived three
generations. All the young fellows of ſpirit were proud to be enrolled in the
liſt of his companions; but as their conſtitutions were more puny than his,
three ſets of them had dropt into the grave, and left him at the head of the
fourth. He would often boaſt of the many promiſing ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuſſes, who had
fallen in the vain attempt of keeping pace with him in the various ſcenes of
debauchery. In this light we may conſider him as an acceſſary to ſo
many wanton murders. By the operation of his conſcience, at every tavern door
he might have met with an acquaintance to bar his paſſage; and in the
midſt of his jollity, like <hi>Macbeth,</hi> he would have daſhed down his
glaſs, and imagined that he ſaw a departed friend filling the vacant
chair.</p>
               <p>FROM the nature of the facts which have already been recorded of
TOM DARE-DEVIL, the reader will eaſily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that he muſt have been an
Atheiſt. No creature, who believed in a SUPREME BEING, could have acted ſo
vilely towards his fellow-creatures. TOM was preſident of an abominable club,
who met together every Sunday night to utter the moſt horrid blaſphemies.
The members of this moſt ſcandalous ſociety muſt have heard of the
manner of their great tutor's death:—let us imagine therefore, that they
could figure to themſelves his ghoſt appearing to them, warning them of
their errors, and exhorting them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. They might conceive him ſetting
forth, in the moſt pathetic manner, the conſequences of their folly, and
declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="168" facs="tcp:1252700301:173"/> to them how convinced he was of the certainty
of thoſe doctrines which they daily ridiculed. Such an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition would
indeed have an effect upon common ſinners; but in all probability a
thorough-paced infidel would not be reclaimed, even 
<q rend="inline">"though One roſe from the dead."</q>
               </p>
               <p>WHAT I have here ſuppoſed might have been the caſe of one
particular reprobate, is in the power of every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to put in practice for
himſelf. Nothing is a ſtronger inſtance of the goodneſs of the CREATOR,
than that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate inward feeling, ſo ſtrongly impreſſed on every
reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able creature. This internal ſenſe, if duly attended to, and
diligently cheriſhed and kept alive, would check the ſinner in his career,
and make him look back with horror on his crimes. An Antient is commended for
wiſhing, 
<q rend="inline">"that he had a window in his breaſt, that
every one might ſee into it:"</q> but it is certainly of more conſequence
to keep ourſelves free from the reproach of our own hearts, than from the
evil opinions of others. We ſhould therefore conſider Conſcience as a
Mirror, in which every one may ſee himſelf reflected, and in which every
action is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in its proper colours.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT there is a vanity inherent in every author muſt be
confeſſed, whatever pains they may take to conceal it from the reſt of
mankind. For my own part, I readily acknowledge, that I am always wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
delighted with my own productions. I ſnatch up the favourite ſheets wet
from the preſs, and devour every ſyllable: not the leaſt particle
eſcapes my notice, and I dwell with admiration on the beauties of an
expreſſive <hi>and</hi> or emphatical <hi>the.</hi> If every reader was to
pay the ſame at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention <pb n="170" facs="tcp:1252700301:175"/> to my works, or peruſe them
with half the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, Mr. TOWN might be fairly pronounced the
greateſt author of the age. But I am afraid I ſhall ſcarce find another
who will ſo heartily join in the good opinion I have conceived of myſelf;
and many a choice ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, many a culled expreſſion, which I have
repeated to myſelf over and over again with extacy, has by others perhaps
been as haſtily hurried over as any common ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle in a news-paper.</p>
               <p>AN Author, who is ever big with the idea of his own importance,
will gather matter for ſelf-flattery from the moſt trivial circumſtances.
On the mornings of publication I have ſometimes made it my buſineſs to go
round the coffee houſes, in order to receive whatever increaſe of praiſe
I could collect from the approbation of my readers. My heart you may imagine
has bounded with joy, when I have heard the room echo with calling for the
CONNOISSEUR: but how has it ſunk again, when I have found the ſame tokens
of eſteem ſhewn to a brother writer! I could have hugged any honeſt
fellow, that has chuckled over my performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and pointed out my good
things:—but I have been no leſs chagrined, when I have ſeen a coxcomb
coolly take up my paper, ſquint over the firſt page, and throw it down
again with all the indifference imaginable: though indeed I have never failed
within myſelf to pronounce on ſuch a perſon, that he is dull, ignorant
and illiterate. I once happened to be ſeated in the next box to two noted
critics, who were looking over the file of my papers, and ſeemed particularly
pleaſed with ſeveral parts of them. I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately conceived a very high
opinion of their taſte and judgment: I remarked with ſingular
ſatisfaction the effect which my wit and humour had on their countenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; 
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1252700301:176"/> and as they turned over the pages, I imagined I could
point out the very paſſages, which provoked them frequently to ſmile, and
ſometimes to burſt into a loud laugh. As ſoon as they were gone, I
ſeized the file; when lo! to my great mortification I found they had been
reading, not my own admirable works, but the lucubrations of a brother
eſſayiſt.</p>
               <p>MY vanity has often prompted me to wiſh, that I could
accompany my papers whereſoever they are circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. I flatter myſelf I
ſhould then be introduced to the politeſt men of quality, and admitted into
the cloſets of our fineſt ladies. This conſideration would doubtleſs
make me vain of myſelf: but my pride would be ſoon checked by reflecting
further, that were I obliged to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low my papers afterwards through all their
travels and mutations, I ſhould certainly undergo the ſhame of ſeeing
ſome of them proſtituted to the vileſt purpoſes. If in one place I
might be pleaſed to find them the entertainment of the tea-table, in another
I ſhould be no leſs vexed to ſee them degraded to the baſe office of
ſticking up candles. Such is the fatality attending theſe looſe ſheets,
that though at their firſt publication they may be thought as precious as the
<hi>Sibyl</hi>'s leaves, the next moment they may be thrown aſide as no
better than a laſt year's almanack.</p>
               <p>EVER ſince my firſt appearance in a ſheet and a half I
have felt great uneaſineſs on account of the rude treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which my
works have been ſubject to in their preſent form. I turned off my printer
for a very hei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous affront offered to my delicacy, having detected ſome foul
proofs of my firſt numbers lodged in a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly <pb n="172" facs="tcp:1252700301:177"/> place; and I almoſt came to an open rupture with my publiſher,
becauſe his wife had converted a ſupernumerary half-ſheet into a
thread-paper. A lady, whoſe ſenſe and beauty I had always admired,
forfeited my eſteem at once by cutting out a pattern for a cap from one of my
papers; and a young fellow, who had ſpoken very handſomely of one of my
eſſays, made no ſcruple to defile the blank margin with a filthy liſt
of foul ſhirts and dirty ſtockings. The repeated abuſes of illiterate
bakers, paſtry-cooks, and chandlers I know I am condemned to ſuffer in
common with other mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal writers. It was ever their priviledge to prey
indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminately on all authors good or bad: and as poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians, wits,
freethinkers, and divines, may have their duſt mingled in the ſame piece of
ground, ſo may their works be jumbled together in the lining of the ſame
trunk or band-box.</p>
               <p>ONE inſtance may indeed be brought, in which I am uſed to
hail as a lucky omen the damages that my papers appear to have ſuſtained in
their outward form and complexion. With what raptures have I traced the
progreſs of my fame, while I have contemplated my numbers in the public
coffee-houſes ſtrung upon a file, and ſwelling gradually into a little
volume! By the appearance which they make, when thus collected, I have often
judged of the reception they have ſingly met with from their readers: I have
conſidered every ſpeck of dirt as a mark of reputation, and have
aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to myſelf applauſe from the ſpilling of coffee or the print
of a greaſy thumb. In a word, I look upon each paper, when torn and ſullied
by frequent hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, as an old ſoldier battered in the ſervice, and
co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with honourable ſcars.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:1252700301:178"/>I WAS led into this train of thought by an
accident which happened to me the other evening, as I was walking in ſome
fields near the town. As I went along my curioſity tempted me to examine the
materials of which ſeveral paper kites were made up, from whence I had
ſufficient room to moralize on the ill fate of authors. On one I diſcovered
ſeveral pages of a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon expanded over the ſurface; on another the
wings fluttered with love ſongs; and a ſatire on the miniſtry furniſhed
another with ballaſt for the tail. I at length happened to caſt my eye on
one taller than the reſt, and beheld ſeveral of my own darling productions
paſted over it. My indignation was preſently raiſed, that I ſhould
become the plaything of children; and I was even aſhamed that the great name
of TOWN, which ſtared me full in the front, ſhould be expoſed, like the
compoſitions of Dr. <hi>Rock</hi> on the wall, to every idle gazer. However,
by a curious turn of thought I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted what at firſt ſeemed a diſgrace
into a compliment to my vanity. As the kite roſe into the air, I drew a
flattering parallel between the height of it's flight, and the ſoaring of my
own reputation: I imagined myſelf lifted up on the wings of fame, and like
<hi>Horace</hi>'s Swan towering above mortality: I fancied my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf borne like
a blazing ſtar among the clouds, to the admiration of the gazing multitude
below.

                  <hi>Harlſton in Norfolk, July</hi> 30.
Yeſterday in the afternoon <hi>Slack</hi> and <hi>Pettit</hi> met and fought.
At the firſt <hi>Set-to, Pettit</hi> ſeized <hi>Slack</hi> by the throat,
and held him up againſt the rails, and <hi>grain'd</hi> him ſo much as to
make him turn extremely black: this continued for half a minute before
<hi>Slack</hi> could break <hi>Pettit</hi>'s hold; after which for near ten
minutes <pb n="176" facs="tcp:1252700301:181"/> 
                  <hi>Pettit</hi> kept fighting and driving hard
at <hi>Slack,</hi> when at length <hi>Slack</hi> clos'd with his antagoniſt
and gave him a very ſevere fall, after that a ſecond and third; but between
theſe falls <hi>Pettit</hi> threw <hi>Slack</hi> twice off the Stage, and
indeed <hi>Pettit</hi> ſo much dreaded <hi>Slack</hi>'s falls, that he ran
directly at his hams and tumbled him down, and by that means gave
<hi>Slack</hi> an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of making the falls very eaſy: when they had
been fighting eighteen minutes, the odds ran againſt <hi>Slack</hi> a guinea
to a ſhilling; whereas on firſt ſetting out, it was three or four to one
on his head; but after this time <hi>Slack ſhortened Pettit</hi> ſo, as to
diſable him from running and throwing him down in the manner he had done
before, but obliged him to ſtand to cloſe fighting. <hi>Slack</hi> then
clos'd one of his eyes, and beat him very much about the face. At twenty
minutes <hi>Pettit</hi> grew weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Slack</hi> ſtronger; this was
occaſion'd by <hi>Slack's ſtrait</hi> way of fighting. At twenty-two
minutes the beſt judges allow'd <hi>Slack</hi> to have the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over
<hi>Pettit</hi> very considerably, as he was then recovering his <hi>Wind,</hi>
which was owing to <hi>Game:</hi> when they had box'd twenty-four mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes,
<hi>Pettit</hi> threw <hi>Slack</hi> again over the rails. This indeed
<hi>Slack</hi> ſuffered him to do, as by that means he fixed a blow under
<hi>Pettit</hi>'s ribs, that hurt him much. Whilſt <hi>Slack</hi> was again
getting upon the ſtage (it was not half a minute before he was remounted)
<hi>Pettit</hi> had ſo much the fear of his antagoniſt before his eyes,
that he walked off without ſo much as civilly taking leave of the
ſpectators, or ſaying any thing to any perſon. This the Cockers call
<hi>roguing of it</hi>; for it is generally thought that <hi>Pettit</hi> ran
away full ſtrong. The whole time of their fighting was twenty-five minutes;
and this morning the BATTLE was given to <hi>Slack,</hi> who drew the firſt
ten guineas out of the box. Thus ended this dreadful combat.</q>
               <p>EVERY man, who has the honour of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> fiſt

had been uſed to indent many a bruiſe, now clenches them only to graſp a
link; and <hi>Broughton</hi> employs the muſcles of his brawny arm in
ſqueezing a lemon or drawing a cork. His Amphitheatre itſelf is converted
into a Methodiſt Meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe! and perhaps (as laymen are there admitted
into the pulpit) thoſe very fiſts, which ſo lately dealt ſuch hearty
bangs upon the ſtage, are now with equal vehemence thumping the
cuſhion.</p>
               <p>THE dextrous uſe of the fiſt is a truly <hi>Britiſh</hi>
exerciſe: and the ſturdy <hi>Engliſh</hi> have been as much renowned for
their Boxing as their Beef; both which are by no means ſuited to the watry
ſtomachs and weak ſinews of their enemies the <hi>French.</hi> To this
nutriment and this art is owing that long-eſtabliſhed maxim, that one
<hi>Engliſhman</hi> can beat three <hi>Frenchmen.</hi> A <hi>Frenchman,</hi>
who piddles on <pb n="178" facs="tcp:1252700301:183"/> a fricaſſee of frogs, can no more
encounter with an <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman,</hi> who feeds upon beef, than the frog in
the fable could ſwell her little body to the ſize of an ox; and from hence
we may conclude, on the principles of philoſophy, that the elaſtic
ſpring, which darts from the knuckles of an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> falls into
the heels of a <hi>Frenchman.</hi> One of my correſpondents has already
remonſtrated againſt the degeneracy of the preſent times in our
ſhameful neglect of that ſupport of our national ſtrength, Old
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Roaſt Beef. Indeed we can never hope, that any of our
modern heroes would attempt to <hi>fix a blow under the ribs,</hi> when they
are afraid of plunging a knife into a Surloin: and I will venture to ſay,
that when the times come, that Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loins are no more brought upon the table, we
ſhall not be able to produce one <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> who can knock down an
ox.</p>
               <p>OUR preſent race of ſpindle-ſhanked beaux had rather
cloſe with an orange wench at the playhouſe, than engage in a bye battle at
<hi>Tottenham Court.</hi> It is therefore no wonder, that they ſhould object
to this manly practice, for which they are ſo ill fitted. How can we imagine,
that they could ſtand againſt the buffets of a bruiſer, when they might
almoſt be patted down with the fan of a lady? An attempt was once made by
<hi>Broughton</hi> to bring this ſtudy into vogue, by eſtabliſhing a
School for Boxing, in which he himſelf was to be the Lecturer. He invited the
young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the army, and all other men of ſpirit, to engage under
his directions; and promiſed to arm their feeble wriſts with mufflers, ſo
that nothing might be apprehended by the ſofteſt head or tendereſt
ſkin. A few indeed were hardy enough to try a fall with him: but moſt of
our young fellows gave up the gauntlet for ſcented gloves; and loathing the
mutton fiſts of vulgar carmen and porters, they rather choſe to hang their
hands in a ſling, to make them <pb n="179" facs="tcp:1252700301:184"/> white and delicate as a
lady's. I cannot but regret, that this deſign was not generally encouraged,
as it might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have aboliſhed almoſt the only uſe, that is at
preſent made of the ſword; and men of honour, inſtead of tilting at each
other, might have had ſatisfacion in a tight <hi>Set-to</hi> behind
<hi>Mountague Houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE amuſement of Boxing I muſt confeſs is more immediately
calculated for the vulgar, who can have no reliſh for the more refined
pleaſures of whiſt and the hazard table. Men of faſhion have found out a
more genteel employment for their hands in ſhuffling a pack of cards and
ſhaking the dice: and indeed it will appear upon a ſtrict review, that
moſt of our faſhionable diverſions are nothing elſe but different
branches of gaming. What lady would be able to boaſt a route at her houſe
conſiſting of three or four hundred perſons, if they were not to be drawn
together by the charms of playing a rubber? and the prohibition of our jubilee
maſquerades is hardly to be regretted, as they wanted the moſt
eſſential part of their entertainments, the E. O. table. To this polite
ſpirit of gaming, which has diffuſed itſelf through all the fashion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
world, is owing the vaſt encouragement that is given to the Turf; and
horſe-races are eſteemed only as they afford occaſion for making a bet.
The ſame ſpirit like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe draws the knowing ones together in a Cock-pit;
and cocks are reſcued from the dunghill, and armed with gaffles, to furniſh
a new ſpecies of gaming. For this reaſon among others I cannot but regret
the loſs of our ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant amuſements in <hi>Oxford Road</hi> and
<hi>Tottenham Court.</hi> A great part of the ſpectators uſed to be deeply
inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in what was doing on the ſtage, and were as earneſt to make
an advantage of the iſſue of the battle, <pb n="180" facs="tcp:1252700301:185"/> as the
champions themſelves to draw the largeſt ſum from the box. The
Amphitheatre was at once a ſchool for boxing and gaming. Many thouſands
have depended upon a match; the odds have often riſen at a black eye; a large
bet has been occaſioned by a croſs-buttock: and while the houſe has
reſounded with the luſty bangs of the combatants, it has at the ſame time
echoed with the cries of <hi>five to one, ſix to one, ten to one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE loſs of this branch of gaming is a public cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity; and I
doubt not but the gentlemen at <hi>White</hi>'s, and all others whom it
concerns, will uſe their endeavours to have it reſtored. The many plates
given all over the kingdom have undoubtedly improved our breed of horſes; and
if the diverſion of Boxing was to meet with equal encouragement, we ſhould
certainly have a more ſtout and hardy race of bruiſers. It might perhaps
become a faſhion for gentlemen, who were fond of the ſport, to keep
cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions in training, put them in ſweats, diet them, and breed up the human
ſpecies with the ſame care as they do cocks and horſes. In courſe of
time this branch of gaming, like all others, would doubtleſs be reduced to a
ſcience; and <hi>Broughton,</hi> in imitation of that great genius
<hi>Hoyle,</hi> might oblige the public with a Treatiſe on the Fiſt, and
Calculations for laying the Odds at any Match of Boxing.</p>

I ſhall therefore preſent it to the reader this day.</p>

                  <body>
                     <head>To Mr. TOWN.</head>
                     <opener>
                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>YOU muſt have obſerved a paragraph in the news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers
dated from <hi>Dublin,</hi> which informs us, that 
<q rend="inline">"the ſpirit of Duelling is now become ſo
common, that ſcarce a day paſſes without one or more being fought in or
near that Metropolis."</q> I am very much alarmed leſt this madneſs
ſhould croſs the ſeas: to ſay the truth, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt begin to think it
neceſſary, that the frequent impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation <pb n="182" facs="tcp:1252700301:187"/> of
<hi>Iriſhmen</hi> into this kingdom ſhould, for ſome time, be prohibited;
and an embargo laid on thoſe ſhips that are freighted with contraband
Duelliſts. The ladies perhaps may object to this propoſal, but it is your
duty, Mr. TOWN, at leaſt to do all in your power to prevent the influence
which the conduct of theſe heroic gentlemen, who cannot ſuffer their
ſwords to ſleep quietly in their ſcabbards, may have on our young
fellows: I muſt therefore beg of you to put together a few thoughts on this
occaſion, and though the ſubject has been often treated before, I cannot
but ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that there is ſufficient room left for You to expatiate on it.
It is uſual among the Biſhops, when they find any particular vice prevail,
to ſend orders to the Clergy of their reſpective dioceſes to preach
againſt it. In like manner it is your duty, as CENSOR GENERAL, to attack the
reigning follies: and it is ſurely as eaſy for You to throw them into a new
light, as it is for the Clergy to preach different ſermons on the ſame
text.</p>
                     <p>YOU will undoubtedly agree with me that Gaming is one of the
principal cauſes of Duels, and that many a young fellow has owed his death to
cards and dice. As the gaming-houſes are often filled with rogues in lace and
ſharpers in embroidery, an honeſt but raſh adventurer often loſes his
temper with his money, and begins to ſuſpect that the cards are packed, or
the dice loaded: and then very wiſely riſks his life becauſe he finds it
impoſſible to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his caſh. Upon this account I am never witneſs
to deep play, but it raiſes very ſerious reflections in me. When I have
ſeen a young nobleman offer a large ſtake, I have conſidered him as
ſetting his life upon a card, or (like King <hi>Richard)</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">"laying it upon a caſt, and ſtanding the
hazard of the die."</q> I have even imagined that I heard bullets rattle in the
dice-box, and that I ſaw challenges written upon every card on the table.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="183" facs="tcp:1252700301:188"/>THE ladies alſo are frequently the
cauſe of Duels; though it muſt be owned, in juſtice to the better part of
the ſex, that where one is fought on account of a modeſt woman, ten are
occaſioned by proſtitutes. The ſtout knights-errant, who entertain a
paſſion for the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs <hi>Dulcineas</hi> of <hi>Drury-Lane</hi> and
<hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> find frequent opportunities of manifeſting their
proweſs. They not only encounter with bullies and bravoes, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
meet with other enamoratoes as fond and as mad as themſelves. I am
perſonally acquainted with two gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of this turn, who held out
piſtols at each other acroſs a bed at one of theſe ladies lodgings, and
toſſed up which ſhould fire firſt. The piſtol however luckily miſt
fire, and gave them time to think better of it: ſo they very amicably ſhook
hands, laid down their piſtols, and went to bed to the lady together. Theſe
females are not content, it ſeems, with the conqueſts commonly made by the
fair, but often paſs a more cruel ſentence on their captives. Their lovers
not only ſuffer thoſe meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorical deaths which all their tribe muſt
endure, but are often really killed in ſerious truth and ſober ſadneſs.
They are not only ſhot through the heart by an accidental glance of the eyes,
but often have a brace of balls lodged in their heads; and are not only 
<q rend="inline">"ſtabbed through the liver (as
<hi>Mercutio</hi> has it) by the blind bow-boy's butt-ſhaft,"</q> but they
may perhaps be engaged in a duel with a rival, in which they are run through
the body.</p>
                     <p>A FOREIGN Count was once challenged by one of theſe
hot-headed gentlemen, and I ſhall conclude my letter by recommending his
method to our modern Dueliſts. The place of battle appointed was the Count's
houſe, and when the furious challenger came in, breathing nothing but
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, he was ſurprized to find the Count ſitting very 
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:1252700301:189"/> compoſedly with a candle and a barrel at his ſide. 
<q rend="inline">"This, Sir, ſaid the Count, is a barrel of
gunpowder, and if you pleaſe we will take our chance who ſhall ſet fire
to it, you or I."</q> The gentleman amazed at this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient made no anſwer;
upon which the Count lighted a match, and waving it over the mouth of the
barrel, cried out, 
<q rend="inline">"Get out of the room, Sir, or I will ſet
fire to the powder this inſtant."</q> This abated our challeger's wrath ſo
conſiderably, that the Count was rid of him in a moment, and he was glad to
leave the room without any ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—I ſhall expect ſomething
from you on this ſubject and am,</p>
                     <closer>
                        <salute>Sir!</salute>

MAKEPEACE.</signed>

               </floatingText>
               <p>I SHALL not refuſe my correſpondent my animadverſions on
this ſubject, but as I am not inclined to meaſure ſwords on this
occaſion with any of my predeceſſors or cotempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries, I ſhall
expatiate in an entire new field, and appear in the cauſe as an advocate for
Duelling. The vices and follies of the faſhionable world are ſo connected
with each other, that they almoſt form a regular ſyſtem, and the
prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of them all is abſolutely neceſſary to complete the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of a Fine Gentleman. A Fine Gentleman (in the modern ſenſe of the word) is
one that whores, games, and wears a ſword. Running after looſe women is
indeed in ſome meaſure common to this exhalted part of mankind with the
vulgar: but to live in bagnios, to be kept in repair by <hi>Rock</hi> or
<hi>Ward</hi> by the quarter, to be in a continual courſe of pill and
electuary, and to make a buſineſs of fornication is the peculiar privilege
of a Fine Gentleman. Gaming is alſo an eſſential requiſite to this
character, and is indeed capable of itſelf to create a perſon a Gentleman
who has no other pretenſions to that title. The greateſt ſcoundrels
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided <pb n="185" facs="tcp:1252700301:190"/> they were gameſters, have always been
permitted to aſſociate with people of faſhion; and perhaps they hold
their title to the beſt company by the ſame tenure that the Knaves keep
their rank among the honours in a pack of cards. But the grand
diſtinguiſhing mark of a Fine Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman is the wearing a ſword.
Gentility diſplays itſelf in a well-fancied ſword-knot, and honour lies
ſheathed in the ſcabbard. All who bear arms have a claim to this
charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: even our common ſoldiers (like the knights of old) are dubbed
Gentlemen on the ſhoulder with this only difference, that inſtead of the
ſword, the ceremony is performed by a brown muſket.</p>
               <p>UPON theſe and many other weighty conſiderations I have
reſolved not to diſturb the tranquility of the polite world by railing at
their darling vices. A CENSOR may endeavour to new-cock a hat, to raiſe the
ſtays, or write down the ſhort petticoat, at his pleaſure. Perſons of
quality will vary faſhions of themſelves, but will always adhere ſteadily
to their vices. I have lately received ſeveral letters from ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons and
younger brothers deſiring me to promote as far as lays in my power the modern
way of life, and eſpecially the practice of Duelling. The former open their
caſe in the moſt pathetic terms, and aſſure me that if it was not for
Duels, and the amorous rencontres of Fine Gentlemen with the other ſex, their
profeſſion would ſcarce ſupport them. As to the young gentlemen they
inveigh bitterly againſt the une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual distribution of property by the laws of
<hi>England,</hi> and offer me very conſiderable bribes if I will eſpouſe
the cauſe of Duels and Debauchey; without which they ſcarce have any
tolerable chance of coming in for the family eſtate.</p>
               <p>SWIFT ſomewhere obſerves that thoſe differences very
rarely happen among men of ſenſe, and he does not ſee any great harm, if
two worthleſs fellows ſend each other out of the world. I ſhall therefore
humbly propoſe, the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to keep up this ſpirit, that Duels
may be included in the Licence-Act among our other public diverſions, with 
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1252700301:191"/> a reſtraining clauſe taking away all power from the
Juſtices to prohibit theſe entertainments. I would alſo propoſe, for
the better accommodation of the public, that ſcaffolds be erected behind
<hi>Montague Houſe,</hi> or in any other convenient place, as there are now
at <hi>Tyburn</hi>; and that whenever any two Gentlemen quarrel, they ſhall
inſert their challenges in the Daily Papers after the following manner in

                     <p>I KNOW not whether you yourſelf are addicted to a filthy
practice, which is frequent among all ranks of people, though deteſtable even
among the loweſt. The practice I mean is that of ſnuff-taking; which I
cannot help regarding as a national plague, that like another epidemical
diſtemper <pb n="188" facs="tcp:1252700301:193"/> has taken hold of our noſes. You authors
may perhaps claim it as a priviledge, ſince ſnuff is ſuppoſed by you to
whet the invention, and every one is not poſſeſſed of BAYES's admirable
receipt, the "Spirit of Brains:"—but give me leave to tell you, that
ſnuff ſhould no more be adminiſtered in public, than that of
<hi>Major</hi>'s medicinal compoſition at fourpence a pinch, or any other
doſe of phyſick. I know not why people ſhould be allowed to annoy their
friends and acquaintance by ſmearing their noſes with a dirty pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, any
more than in uſing an eye-water, or rubbing their teeth with a
dentifrice.</p>
                     <p>IF a ſtranger to this naſty cuſtom was to obſerve
almoſt every one 
<q rend="inline">"drawing out his pouncet-box, and ever and

cram his noſtrils with a quantity of ſcented dirt, to fence them from the
diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effluvias of the reſt of the company. Indeed it might not be
abſurd in ſuch a ſtranger to imagine, that the perſon he converſed
with took ſnuff, for the ſame reaſon that another might preſs his
noſtrils together between his finger and thumb, to exclude an ill
ſmell.</p>
                     <p>IT is cuſtomary among thoſe polite people the
<hi>Dutch,</hi> to carry with them every where their ſhort dingy pipes, and
ſmoak and ſpit about a room even in the preſence of ladies. This piece of
good-breeding, however ridiculous it may ſeem, is not ſurely more
offenſive to good manners than the practice of ſnuff-taking: a very
<hi>Dutchman</hi> would think it odd, that a people who pretend to politeneſs
ſhould be continually ſnuffing up a parcel of tobacco duſt; nor can I
help laughing, when I ſee a man every minute ſtealing out a dirty
muckender, then ſneaking it in again, as much <pb n="189" facs="tcp:1252700301:194"/>
aſhamed of his pocket companion, as he would be to carry a diſhclout about
him.</p>
                     <p>IT is indeed impoſſible to go into any large company
without being diſturbed by this abominable practice. The church and the
playhouſe continually echoe with this mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of the noſe, and in every
corner you may hear them in concert ſnuffling, ſneezing, hawking, and
grunting like a drove of hogs. The moſt pathetic ſpeech in a tragedy has
been interrupted by the blowing of noſes in the front and ſide boxes; and I
have known a whole congregation ſuddenly raiſed from their knees in the
middle of a prayer by the violent coughing of an old lady, who has been
almoſt choaked by a pinch of ſnuff in giving vent to an ejacula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A
celebrated actor has ſpoiled his voice by this abſurd treatment of his
noſe, which has made his articulation like the hum of a bag-pipe; and the
parſon of our pariſh is often forced to break off in the middle of a period
to ſnort behind his white handkerchief.</p>
                     <p>IS it not a wonder, Mr. TOWN, that ſnuff, which is
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly an enemy to dreſs, ſhould yet gain admittance among thoſe who
have no other merit than their cloaths? I am not to be told, that your men of
faſhion take ſnuff only to diſplay a white hand perhaps, or the
brilliancy of a dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond ring: and I am confident that numbers would never have
defiled themſelves with the uſe of ſnuff, had they not been ſeduced by
the charms of a faſhionable box. The man of taſte takes his
<hi>Straſburgh veritable tabac</hi> from a right <hi>Paris</hi> paper-box,
and the pretty fellow uſes a box of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed metal, that by often opening
it he may have the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of ſtealing a glance at his own ſweet
perſon reflected in the lid of it.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="190" facs="tcp:1252700301:195"/>THOUGH I abhor ſnuff-taking myſelf,
and would as ſoon be ſmothered in a cloud raiſed by ſmoking tobacco as
I would willingly ſuffer the leaſt atom of it to tickle my noſe, yet am I
expoſed to many diſguſting inconveniences from the uſe of it by others.
Sometimes I am choaked by drawing in with my breath ſome of the fineſt
particles together with the air; and I am frequently ſet a ſneezing by the
odo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous effluvias ariſing from the boxes that ſurround me. But it is not
only my olfactory ſenſe that is offended: you will ſtare when I tell you,
that I am forced to taſte, and even to eat and drink this abominable ſnuff.
If I drink tea with a certain lady, I generally perceive what eſcapes from
her fingers ſwimming at the top of my cup; but it is always attributed to the
foulneſs of the milk or droſs of the ſugar: I never dine at a particular
friend's houſe, but I am ſure to have as much rappee as pepper with my
turnips; nor can I drink my table-beer out of the ſame mug with him, for fear
of coughing from his ſnuff, if not the liquor, going the wrong way. Such
eternal ſnuff-takers as my friend ſhould, I think, at meal-times have a
ſcreen flapping down over the noſe and mouth, under which they might convey
their food, as you may have ſeen at the Maſquerade: at leaſt they
ſhould be ſeparated from the reſt of the company, and placed by
themſelves at the ſide-table like the children.</p>
                     <p>THIS practice of ſnuff-taking, however inexcuſable in the
men, is ſtill more abominable in the other ſex. Neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and
cleanlineſs ought to be always cultivated among the women; but nothing is
more oppoſite to clean linnen than this trick of bedawbing themſelves with
ſnuff. I have with pain obſerved the ſnow-white ſurface of an
handkerchief or apron ſullied with the ſcatterings from the ſnuff-box;
and whenever I ſee a lady beſmeared thus with <hi>Scotch</hi> or
<hi>Havan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nah,</hi> I conſider her as no cleanlier than the kitchen wench 
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1252700301:196"/> ſcouring her braſſes, and begrimed with
brickduſt and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's earth. Houſewifely accompliſhments are at
preſent ſeldom required in a well-bred woman: or elſe I ſhould little
expect to find notableneſs in a wife who keeps up ſuch a conſtant
correſpondence between her fingers and noſe; nor indeed would any one think
her hands at all fit to be employed in making a pudding.</p>
                     <p>IT ſhould be remembered by the younger part of your fair
readers, Mr. TOWN, that ſnuff is an implacable enemy to the complexion, which
in time is ſure to take a tinge from it: they ſhould therefore be as
cautious of acquiring a ſallow hue from this bane of a fair ſkin, as of
being tanned or freckled by expoſing their delicate faces to the ſcorching
rays of the ſun. Beſides, as the noſe has been always reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned a
principal if not the chief ornament of the face, they ſhould be as careful to
preſerve the beauty of it as of any other feature, and not ſuffer it to be
undermined or bloated by ſo pernicious an application as ſnuff-taking. For
my own part, I ſhould as ſoon admire a celebrated toaſt with no noſe at
all, as to ſee it proſtituted to ſo vile a purpoſe. They ſhould
alſo conſider, that the noſe is ſituated very near the lips: and what
reliſh can a lover find in the honey of the latter, if at the ſame time he
is obliged to come into cloſe contact with the former. Rather than
ſnuff-taking ſhould prevail among the ladies, I could wiſh it were the
faſhion for them to wear rings in their noſes like the ſavage nations:
nay, I would even carry it ſtill farther, and oblige thoſe pretty females,
who could be ſtill ſlaves to ſnuff, to have their noſtrils bored
through as well their ears, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of jewels to bear rolls of pigtail
bobbing over their upper lips.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="192" facs="tcp:1252700301:197"/>WE cannot otherwiſe account for this
faſhion among the women ſo unnatural to their ſex, than that they want
em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment for their hands. It was formerly no reflection for a young lady to
be ſeen in the beſt company buſied with her work: but a girl now a days
would as ſoon be ſurprized in twirling a ſpinning wheel as in handling a
thread-paper. The fan or the ſnuff-box are now the only implements they dare
to uſe in publick: yet ſurely it would be much more becoming to have the
fore-finger pricked and ſcarified with the point of a needle, than to ſee
it embrowned with ſqueezing together a filthy pinch of ſnuff.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE ſaid enough, I dare ſay, already to make many of
your readers turn up their noſes at me in diſdain; but however let them
<hi>take ſnuff</hi> as much as they will, you may depend on the good word of
one at leaſt, and that is</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> REMEMBER to have ſeen a little <hi>French</hi> Novel
giving an account of a citizen of <hi>Paris</hi> making an excurſion into the
country. He imagines himſelf about to undertake a long voyage to ſome
ſtrange region, where the natives were as different from the inhabitants of
his own city as the moſt diſtant nations. He accordingly takes boat, and is
landed at a villiage about a league from the capital. When he is ſet on
ſhore, he is amazed to find the people <pb n="194" facs="tcp:1252700301:199"/> talk the ſame
language, wear the ſame dreſs, and uſe the ſame cuſtoms with
himſelf. He who had ſpent all his life within the ſight of <hi>Pont
Neuf,</hi> looked upon every one who lived out of <hi>Paris</hi> as a
foreigner; and though the utmoſt extent of his travels was not three miles,
he was as much ſurprized, as he would have been to meet with a colony of
<hi>Frenchmen</hi> on the <hi>Terra Incognita.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>MOST of our late novels are, with ſome little variation of
circumſtances, borrowed from the <hi>French:</hi> but if we ſhould
endeavour to adapt the novel I have been ſpeaking of to a citizen of
<hi>London,</hi> the humour of the whole piece would evaporate, and the fiction
become unnatural and improbable. A <hi>London</hi> tradeſman is as well
acquainted with <hi>Turnham-Green</hi> or <hi>Kentiſh-Town</hi> as
<hi>Fleet-ſtreet</hi> or <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and talks as familiarly of
<hi>Richmond</hi> or <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> as of the <hi>Change</hi> or the
<hi>Cuſtom Houſe.</hi> In your late paper On the Amuſements of Sunday you
have ſet forth in what manner our citizens paſs that day, which moſt of
them devote to the country: but I wiſh you had been more particular in your
deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe elegant rural manſions, which at once ſhew the
opulence and the taſte of our principal merchants, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics, and
artificers.</p>
                     <p>IN theſe duſty retreats, where the want of <hi>London</hi>
ſmoke is ſupplied by the ſmoke of <hi>Virginia</hi> tobacco, our chief
citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens are accuſtomed to paſs the end and the beginning of every week.
Their Boxes (as they are modeſtly called) are generally built in a row, to
reſemble as much as poſſible the ſtreets in <hi>London.</hi> Thoſe
edifices which ſtand ſingle, and at a diſtance from the road, have always
a ſummer-houſe at the end of a ſmall garden; which being erected upon a
wall adjoining to the highway commands a view of every carriage, and gives the
owner an opportunity of diſplaying <pb n="195" facs="tcp:1252700301:200"/> his beſt wig to
every paſſenger. A little artificial fountain, ſpouting water ſometimes
to the amazing height of four feet and in which frogs ſupply the want of
fiſhes, is one of the moſt exquiſite ornaments in theſe gardens. There
are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides (if the ſpot of ground allows ſufficient ſpace for them)
very curious ſtatues of <hi>Harlequin, Scaramouch, Pierrot,</hi> and
<hi>Columbine,</hi> which ſerve to remind their wives and daughters of what
they have ſeen at the play-houſe.</p>
                     <p>I WENT laſt Sunday, in compliance with a moſt preſſing
invitation from a friend, to ſpend the whole day with him at one of theſe
little ſeats, which he had fitted up for his retirement once a week from
buſineſs. It is pleaſantly ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted about three miles from
<hi>London,</hi> on the ſide of a public road, from which it is ſeparated
by a dry ditch, over which is a little bridge confirming of two narrow planks,
leading to the houſe. The hedge on the other ſide the road cuts off all
proſpect whatſoever, except from the garrets, from whence indeed you have a
beautiful viſta of two men hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in chains on <hi>Kennington</hi> Common,
with a diſtant view of St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Cupola enveloped in a cloud of
ſmoke. I ſet out on my viſit betimes in the morning, accompanied with my
friend's book-keeper, who was my guide, and carried over with him the
<hi>London Evening Poſt,</hi> his miſtreſs's hoop, and a dozen of pipes,
which they were afraid to truſt in the chair. When I came to the end of my
walk, I found my friend ſitting at the door in a black velvet cap, ſmoking
his morning pipe. He welcomed me into the country, and after having made me
obſerve the turnpike on my left and the <hi>Golden Wheatſheaf</hi> on my
right, he conducted me into his houſe, where I was received by his lady, who
made a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand apologies for being catched in ſuch a diſhabille.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="196" facs="tcp:1252700301:201"/>THE hall (for ſo I was taught to call
it) had its white wall almoſt hid by a curious collection of prints and
paintings. On one ſide was a large map of <hi>London,</hi> a plan and
elevation of the Manſion-Houſe, with ſeveral leſſer views of the
pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic buildings and halls; on the other was the Death of the Stag by the
happy pencil of Mr. <hi>Henry Overton,</hi> finely coloured: cloſe by the
parlour door there hung a pair of ſtag's horns, over which there was laid
acroſs a red Roccelo and an amber-headed cane. When I had declared all this
to be mighty pretty, I was ſhewn into the parlour, and was preſently
aſked, who that was over the chimney-piece. I pronounced it to be a very
ſtriking likeneſs of my friend, who was drawn bolt upright in a
full-bottomed perriwig, a laced cravat with the fringed ends appearing thro' a
button<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hole, a black livery gown, a ſnuff-coloured velvet coat with gold
buttons, a red velvet waiſtcoat trimmed with gold, one hand ſtuck in the
boſom of his ſhirt, and the other holding out a letter with the
ſuperſcription—<hi>To Mr. — Common-Council-Man of Faringdon
Ward Without.</hi> My eyes were then directed to another figure in a ſcarlet
gown, who I was informed was my friend's wife's great great uncle, and had been
ſheriff and knighted in the reign of King <hi>James</hi> the firſt. Madam
herſelf filled up a pannel on the oppoſite ſide, in the habit of a
ſhepherdeſs, ſmelling to a noſegay, and ſtroking a ram with gilt
horns.</p>
                     <p>I WAS then invited by my friend to ſee what he was pleaſed
to call his garden, which was nothing more than a yard about twenty feet in
length, and contained about a dozen little pots ranged on each ſide with
lillies and coxcombs, ſupported by ſome old laths painted green, with bowls
of tobacco-pipes on their tops. At the end of this garden he bade me take
notice of a little ſquare building ſurrounded <pb n="197" facs="tcp:1252700301:202"/> with
filleroy, which he told me an Alderman of great taſte had turned into a
Temple, by erecting ſome battlements and ſpires of painted wood on the
front of it; but concluded with an hint, that I might retire to it upon
occaſion.</p>
                     <p>AFTER dinner, when my friend had finiſhed his pipe, he
propoſed taking a walk, that we might enjoy a little of the country: ſo I
was obliged to trudge along the foot path by the road-ſide, while my friend
went puffing and blowing, with his hat in his hand, and his wig half off his
head. At laſt I told him it was time for me to return home, when he
inſiſted on going with me as far as the half-way houſe, to drink a
decanter of Stingo before we parted. We here fell into company with a brother
liveryman of the ſame ward, and I left them both together in an high
diſpute about <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning</hi>; but not before my friend had made me
promiſe to repeat my viſit to his country-houſe the next Sunday.</p>
                     <p>AS the riches of a country are viſible in the number of its
inhabitants, and the elegance of their dwellings, we may venture to ſay that
the preſent ſtate of <hi>England</hi> is very flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and
proſperous: and if the taſte for building encreaſes with our opulence for
the next century, we ſhall be able to boaſt of finer country ſeats
belonging to our ſhop-keepers, artificers, and other plebeians, than the
moſt pompous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of <hi>Italy</hi> or <hi>Greece</hi> have ever
recorded. We read it is true of country-ſeats, belonging to <hi>Pliny,
Hortenſius, Lucullus,</hi> and other <hi>Romans.</hi> They were patricians of
great rank and fortune: there can therefore be no doubt of the excellence of
their <hi>Villas.</hi> But who has ever read of a <hi>Chineſe</hi>-bridge
belonging to a <hi>roman</hi> paſtry-cook? or could any of their Shoemakers
or taylors boaſt a <hi>Villa</hi> with his tin caſcades, paper ſtatutes,
and <hi>Gothic</hi> root-houſes? Upon <pb n="198" facs="tcp:1252700301:203"/> the above
principles we may expect, that poſterity will perhaps ſee a cheeſmonger's
<hi>Apiarium</hi> at <hi>Brentford,</hi> a poul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terer's <hi>Theriotrophium</hi>
at <hi>Chiſwick,</hi> and an <hi>Ornithon</hi> in a fiſhmonger's garden at
<hi>Putney.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>AS a patriot and an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> I cannot but wiſh,
that each ſucceſſive century ſhould encreaſe the opulence of
<hi>Great Britain:</hi> but I ſhould be ſorry, that this abundance of
wealth ſhould induce our good citizens to turn their thoughts too much upon
the country. At preſent we are deprived of our moſt eminent tradeſmen two
days out of ſix. It is true the ſhopkeeper and the travelling part of his
family, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally of himſelf, his wife, and his two eldeſt
daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, are ſeldom ſufficiently equipped to take leave of
<hi>London,</hi> till about three o'clock on Saturday in the afternoon; but the
whole morning of that day is conſumed in papering up cold chickens, bottling
brandy-punch, ſorting clean ſhifts, and night-caps for the children,
pinning baſkets, and cord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trunks; as again is the whole afternoon of the
Monday following, in unpinning, uncording, locking up foul linnen, and
replacing empty bottles in the cellar. I am afraid there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if the
<hi>Villas</hi> of our future tradeſmen ſhould become ſo very elegant,
that the ſhop-keepers will ſcarce ever be viſible behind their counters
above once in a month.</p>

uſe of on the ſtage to deceive the audience, by the expreſſion of
<hi>Jeu de Theâtre,</hi> which we may tranſlate "the Juggle of the
Theatre." When theſe little arts are exerciſed merely to aſſiſt
nature and ſet her off to the beſt advantage, none can be ſo critically
nice as to object to them; but when tragedy by theſe means is lifted into
rant, and comedy diſtorted into buffoonery, though the deceit may ſucceed
with the multitude, men of ſenſe will always be offended at it. This
conduct, whether of the poet or the player, reſembles in ſome ſort the
poor contrivance of the ancients, who mounted their heroes upon ſtilts, and
expreſſed the manners of their characters by the groteſque figures of
their maſks.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="tcp:1252700301:205"/>AS the playhouſes are now opened, I
cannot better intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the remarks which I may ſometimes take occaſion to
make on the theatrical world, than by throwing together a few reflections on
this "Juggle of the Theatre;" which at preſent I ſhall conſider, only as
it relates to the actors. And I hope to merit the thanks of theſe gentlemen,
who while they are ſollicitous to acquire new beauties, ſhould at the
ſame time endeavour to unlearn their faults and imperfections.</p>
               <p>WE are indebted to the preſent times for a judicious
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation of the ſtage in point of acting: and (by the bye) I could
wiſh, that the ſame good conſequences had been produced with reſpect to
our poets. If a perfect tragedy may be conſidered as the moſt difficult
production of human wit, the ſame thing muſt hold in proportion with
reſpect to an exact repreſentation of it: for if it is neceſſary for
the writer to work up his imagination to ſuch a pitch as to fancy himſelf
in the circumſtances of the character he draws; what leſs muſt the actor
do, who muſt look as the perſon repreſented would look, ſpeak as he
would ſpeak, and be in every point the very man? The generation of players,
that immediately preceded the preſent, prided themſelves on what they
called <hi>fine ſpeaking:</hi> the emotions of the ſoul were diſregarded
for a diſtinct delivery; and with them, as Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> has
obſerved of ſome tragic writers, 
<q> 
                     <l>"Declamations roar'd, while paſſion ſlept."</l>
                  </q>
And, indeed, to this ſuperficial taſte for acting we may partly attribute
that enervate way of writing ſo much in vogue among the frenchified
play-wrights of thoſe times; ſince nothing could be ſo well ſuited to
the mouths of thoſe actors, as golden lines, round periods, florid
deſcriptions, and a diſpaſſionate amplification of ſentiment.

               <p>THE falſe majeſty, with which our mimic heroes of the
ſtage had been uſed to expreſs themſelves, was for a long time as
diſtinguiſhing a mark of tragedy, as the plumed hat and full-bottomed
perriwig; and we may remember for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, when every line in Othello, (a
character remarkable for variety of paſſions,) was drawn out in the ſame
pompous manner. But as I mean to promote the art, rather than reprove the
artiſts, I ſhall dwell on this no longer: for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks I hear a veteran
performer calling out to me in the voice of honeſt <hi>Jack Falſtaff,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"no more of that, if thou loveſt me,
<hi>Hal.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is ſufficient to remark that, as the dignity of the
buſkin would be degraded by talking in a ſtrain too low and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar, the
manner of elocution in a tragedy ſhould not on either hand be more remote
from our natural way of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing ourſelves, than blank verſe (which
is the only proper meaſure for tragedy) is from proſe. Our preſent ſet
of actors have in general diſcarded the dead inſipid pomp applauded in
their predeceſſors, and have wiſely endeavoured to join with the poet in
exciting pity and terror. But as many writers have miſtaken rant for
paſſion, and fuſtian for ſublime, ſo our players have perhaps too
much given into unnatural ſtartings, roarings, and whinings. For this
reaſon our late writers (to accommodate their pieces to the preſent
taſte) have placed their chief <hi>pathos</hi> in exclamations and broken
ſentences, have endeavoured to alarm us with <hi>Ahs</hi> and <hi>Ohs,</hi>
and pierce our ſouls with interjections. Upon the whole, it muſt be
acknowled, that the ſtage is conſiderably improved in the Art of Speaking.
Every paſſion is now diſtinguiſhed by it's proper tone of voice: I
ſhall therefore <pb n="202" facs="tcp:1252700301:207"/> only add, that when I hear a player
laboriouſly placing an unnatural ſtreſs upon particular words, and
panting with emphaſis, I cannot help comparing him to the paviour, who at
every thump of his rammer cries <hi>hem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I HAVE obſerved, that the tragedians of the laſt age
ſtudied <hi>fine ſpeaking</hi>; in conſequence of which, all their Action
conſiſted in little more than ſtrutting with one leg before the other,
and waving one or both arms in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual ſee-ſaw. Our preſent actors
have perhaps run into a contrary extreme: their geſtures ſometimes
reſemble thoſe afflicted with <hi>St. Vitus</hi>'s Dance; their whole frame
appears to be convulſed; and I have ſeen a player in the laſt act ſo
miſerably diſtreſſed, that a deaf ſpectator would be apt to imagine
he was complaining of the cholic and the tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach. This has alſo given
riſe to that unnatural cuſtom of throwing the body into various ſtrange
ATTITUDES. There is not a paſſion neceſſary to be expreſſed, but
has produced diſpoſitions of the limbs not to be found in any of the
paintings or ſculptures of the beſt maſters. A graceful geſture and
eaſy deportment is indeed worthy the care of every performer: but when I
obſerve him writhing his body into more unnatural contortions than a tumbler
at <hi>Sadler's Wells,</hi> I cannot help being diſguſted to ſee him 
<q rend="inline">"imitate humanity ſo abominably."</q> Our
Pantomime authors have already begun to reduce our comedies into groteſque
ſcenes; and if this taſte for <hi>attitude</hi> ſhould continue to be
popular, I would recommend it to thoſe ingenious gentlemen to adapt our
beſt tragedies to the ſame uſe, and entertain us with the jealouſy of
<hi>Othello</hi> in dumb ſhew, or the tricks of <hi>Harlequin
Hamlet.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>BEFORE I diſmiſs this article, it may be expected that I
ſhould ſay ſomething concerning the behaviour proper for 
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1252700301:208"/> our ladies. We muſt allow them on all occaſions to
roll the eye, ſtretch up the neck, heave the cheſt, and with a thouſand
little tricks ſet off their perſon, if not their part, to the moſt
advantage. The pomp of the old ſtage has not yet been altogether reformed,
either with reſpect to our heroines or our heroes. A weeping princeſs
(though per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſhe is hurried on the ſtage with grief and deſpair)
cannot decently make her entrance without being led in between two mourning
damſels in black; and an heroine muſt always be accompanied by one or more
pages, to ſmooth her train when ruffled by paſſion. The heroe now
ſeldom ſweats beneath the weight of a nodding plume of ſwan feathers, or
has his face half hid within an enormous buſh of white horſe hair: I could
alſo wiſh (if poſſible) that the manager was ſaved the
unneceſſary expence of three yards of velvet for the trains of his Amazons,
and that the chambermaids (as well as the militia of the theatres) were
diſmiſſed, and the pages, together with the dirty lords in waiting,
blotted out of the mute <hi>Dramatis Perſonae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE mention of theſe particulars naturally reminds me to
conſider how far "the Juggle of the Theatre" is concerned in the affair of
Dreſs. Many will agree with me, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the only diſtreſs of the
laſt act in the <hi>Fair Penitent</hi> ariſes from the pitiful appearance
of <hi>Caliſta</hi> in weeds, with every thing hung in black bays about her;
and they are afraid we ſhould loſe ſight of <hi>Hamlet</hi>'s pretended
madneſs, if the black ſtocking, diſcovering a white one underneath, was
not rolled half-way down the leg. A propriety in dreſs is abſolutely
neceſſary to keep up the general decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and a performer properly
habited, who by his whole deportment enters deeply into the circumſtances of
the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter he repreſents, makes us for a while fancy every thing before
us real; but when, by ſome ill-judged piece of art, <pb n="204" facs="tcp:1252700301:209"/> he
departs from the ſimplicity of imitation, and 
<q rend="inline">"overſteps the modeſty of nature,"</q> he
calls us back to the theatre, and excites paſſions very different from
thoſe he aims at.</p>
               <p>I CANNOT better illuſtrate what has been ſaid on this laſt
ſubject, than by giving inſtances of two artifices of this kind; one of
which is employed (as I conceive) to raiſe pity and the other terror. When
the <hi>Romeo</hi> of <hi>Drury Lane</hi> comes to die at <hi>Juliet</hi>'s
monument we are ſurprized to ſee him enter in a ſuit of black. This I
ſuppoſe is entended as a ſtroke of the pathetic: but not to dwell on the
poverty of the artifice, it is in this place a manifeſt violation of the
poet's meaning. <hi>Romeo</hi> is ſuppoſed to come poſt from
Mantua— 
<q rend="inline">"get me poſt-horſes, I will hence to
night"</q>—ſo that if our <hi>Roſcius</hi> muſt be ſo very exact
in dreſſing the character, he ſhould appear at the tomb in a riding frock
and boots. But a mourning coat will excite <hi>pity,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"and let the devil wear black, (ſays our
<hi>Hamlet-Romeo</hi>) for I'll have a ſuit of ſables."</q>—The
ſame player, after having acted that noble ſcene in the ſecond act of
<hi>Macbeth</hi> in ſo fine a manner, that one would almoſt imagine both
the poet and player muſt have murderers to repreſent one ſo well, goes
out to execute the ſuppoſed murder. After a ſhort ſpace he returns as
from the fact: but though the expreſſion in his face is ſtill remarkably
excellent, one cannot but ſmile to obſerve that he has been employing
himſelf behind the ſcenes in putting his wig awry, and untying one of the
tyes to it. This doubtleſs is deſigned to raiſe <hi>terror</hi>; but to
every diſcerning ſpectator it muſt appear moſt abſurdly ridiculous;
for who can forbear laughing, when he finds that the player would have us
imagine, that the ſame deed, which has thrown all that horror and confuſion
into his countenance, has alſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twiſted one of the tails of his
perriwig?</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>THAT part of your laſt paper, in which you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the
Art of Speaking as far as it regards the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atrical performances, gives me
reaſon to hope that you will not overlook the merits of the <hi>Robin
Hood</hi> Society, where that Art is practiſed in it's greateſt perfection.
You would do well to recommend it to the gentlemen of the theatre to attend
thoſe weekly meetings for their improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <pb n="206" facs="tcp:1252700301:211"/> as often
as poſſible; and I dare ſay you will join with me in giving the ſame
advice to the younger part of our clergy and our lawyers, as well as our
members of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. The ſtage, the pulpit, the bar, and the
ſenate-houſe cannot furniſh us with ſuch glorious examples of the power
of Oratory, as are to be met with in this ſociety; where the moſt important
queſtions in every branch of knowledge are diſcuſſed, and where the
diſputants are all of them equally verſed in religion, law, politics, and
the drama.</p>
                     <p>THE inſtitution of this School of Eloquence far exceeds any
thing that the ancients could boaſt. Every ſect, that was known among the
<hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> has it's votaries here alſo. I have
ſeen a taylor a <hi>Stoic,</hi> a ſhoemaker a <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſt,</hi> and a
cook an <hi>Epicurean.</hi> They affect to entertain a profound veneration for
<hi>Socrates,</hi> often preferring him to any of the Apoſtles: but inſtead
of declaring with that wiſe philoſopher that they know nothing, the members
of the <hi>Robin Hood</hi> Society profeſs to know every thing.</p>
                     <p>FOR my own part, I confeſs myſelf ſo charmed with their
proceedings, that I conſtantly attend them: and when I ſee all their
members aſſembled with each his pewter mug before him, I cannot help
preferring this ſocial meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any ancient <hi>Sympoſium</hi> whatever;
and when I further obſerve them firſt take a ſwig, and then ſpeak with
ſuch amazing force of argument, I am apt to conclude that truth, inſtead of
being hid in a well (as was ſaid by an old philoſopher) muſt lay at the
bottom of a tankard of porter.</p>
                     <p>THERE is no grace or excellence in Oratory; but is
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the <hi>Robin Hood</hi> Society to the greateſt advantage.
<hi>Demoſthenes</hi> being aſked what was the firſt quality in an orator,
replied—action; what the ſecond,—action; what 
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1252700301:212"/> the third,—action. Upon this principle one of the
mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, for whom I have a vaſt reſpect, is the greateſt orator that
ever lived. He never troubles himſelf about the order or ſubſtance of
what he delivers, but waves his hand, toſſes his head, abounds in ſeveral
new and beautiful geſtures, and from the beginning of his ſpeech to the end
of it takes no care but to ſet it off with action. <hi>Tully</hi> tells us,
that it is the buſineſs of an orator 
<q rend="inline">"to prove, delight, and convince."</q> Proof
and conviction our Society is always ſure to give us; for elſe how could it
ever come to paſs, that ſo many young men ſhould have learned from
theſe diſquiſitions, that there is no God, that the ſoul is mortal,
that religion is a jeſt, and many other truths, which they would otherwiſe
never have diſcovered. The nature of their queſtions is alſo for the
moſt part ſo entertaining, that the diſputes about them cannot fail of
giving delight: and there is a peculiarity in the oratory of the place, which
greatly conduces to that end. The ſpeakers do not always think themſelves
obliged to drive in the dull direct road to the point, but indulge themſelves
in a larger ſcope that allows room for novelty and entertainment. When the
queſtion has been concerning the veracity of the bible, I have known a
gentleman get up, and beginning with <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror give the
audience an abſtract of as many reigns, as his five minutes would allow him
to diſpatch. I lately remember the queſtion to have been 
<q rend="inline">"Whether a bridge from <hi>Black Fryars</hi>
to <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark</hi> would be of public benefit;"</q> when a facetious
gentleman employed himſelf in demonſtrating the great utility of the bridge
of the noſe, and the bridge of a fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. In a word, our orators are at once
ſerious and comi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal; and they make gravity and mirth almoſt conſtantly
at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend each other, like their own <hi>Robin Hood</hi> and <hi>Little
John.</hi> The ſolidity, and at the ſame time the ſmartneſs of 
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1252700301:213"/> their ſpeeches, are equally remarkable. They pun with
a grave face, and make quibbles and conundrums with the air of a philoſopher.
The writings of different authors have been compared to wines: but the orations
delivered here can be reſembled to nothing ſo properly as the liquors of
the Society; for while they are at once ſo weighty and ſo ſharp, they
ſeem to be an equal mixture of porter and lemonade.</p>
                     <p>IT would be endleſs to enumerate the advantages reſulting
from this Society: The wonderful improvement it has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready made in our
mechanics is very evident: It calls off our tradeſmen from the
<hi>practice</hi> of honeſty in their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon dealings, and ſets them upon
<hi>enquiries</hi> concerning right and wrong, and the moral fitneſs of
things. The SPECTATOR has told us of the rhetoric of a toyman: but you, Mr.
TOWN, might acquaint poſterity of the eloquence of bakers, barbers,
carpenters, and blackſmiths: you may every day hear diſcourſes on
religion from the ſhopboard, and reſearches into philoſophy from behind
the counter. When you took notice of the want of learning in our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of
quality, you ought in juſtice to have acknowledged the amazing erudition of
our tradeſmen. The Plebeians of <hi>Rome</hi> were mere brutes to our common
people; and I am of opinion that the public room under that in which this
weekly meeting is held, inſtead of being furniſhed with the buſts of our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> poets, ſhould be adorned with the heads of the learned
ſhoemakers, tallow-chandlers, ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers, &amp;c. that conſtitute this
excellent Society.</p>
                     <p>WE may venture to ſay that the Royal Society and the
<hi>Robin Hood</hi> Society are the two greateſt ornaments of this nation:
and as the former now and then give us an account of their tranſactions, it
were to be wiſhed that the fellows <pb n="209" facs="tcp:1252700301:214"/> of the latter would
alſo from time to time oblige us with an hiſtory of their proceedings. We
ſhould then ſee by what means ſo many proſelytes have been made from
bigotry and ſuperſtition; by what degrees a young diſputant from a raw
Chriſtian ripens into a deiſt, from a deiſt into a freethinker, and from
a freethinker (by a very ſhort ſtep) into an atheiſt. We ſhould alſo
know the effect, that the diſputations at this weekly meeting has upon our
lives and converſations; and from thence judge how much a deſign of this
nature deſerves public encouragement. I have here flung together a ſhort
account of ſome of the former members, and upon a review of it cannot but
lament that it ſeems to be the peculiar fate of great orators, ſuch as
<hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Tully</hi> for example, to come to an unhappy
end.</p>

                  <pb n="212" facs="tcp:1252700301:217"/>IN the days of queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> it
was the faſhion for the ladies to conceal and wrap up as much of their bodies
as they could: their necks were encompaſſed with a broad ruff, which
likewiſe ſpread itſelf over their boſoms; and their ſleeves were
continued down and faſtened cloſe to their wriſts, while only their feet
were allowed juſt to peep from beneath the modeſt fardingale; ſo that
nothing was expoſed to the impertinent eye of man but their faces. Our
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern ladies have run into the direct contrary extreme, and appear like ſo
many rope-dancers: they have diſcarded as much of their cloaths as with any
tolerable decency can be thrown off, and may be ſaid (like the
<hi>Indian)</hi> to be all face: the neck and boſom are laid bare, and
diſentangled from the invidious vail of an handkerchief; the ſtays are
ſunk half way down the waiſt, and the petticoat has riſen in the ſame
proportion from the ancle. Nor is the lover only captivated by the naked charms
which meet his ſight before; but our ladies, like the <hi>Parthians,</hi>
have alſo learned the art of wounding from behind, and attract our attention
no leſs by laying their ſhoulders open to the view, which (as a young
phyſician of my acquaintance once obſerved) makes them look as if they were
prepared to receive a bliſter. A Naked Lady is no longer the admiration only
of a maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade: every public aſſembly will furniſh us with
<hi>Iphigenias</hi> undreſt for the ſacrifice; and if the next ſummer
ſhould prove an hot one, our ladies will perhaps improve on the thin
veſture of the <hi>Spartan</hi> virgins, and appear abroad in nothing but a
lawn ſhade and gauſe petticoat. If the men ſhould take the hint from the
other ſex, and begin to ſtrip in their turn, I tremble to think what may be
the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: for if they go on in proportion with the women, we may
ſoon expect to ſee our fine gentlemen, like the Highlanders, without
breeches.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:1252700301:218"/>IT would be endleſs to trace the
ſtrange revolutions that have happened in every part of the female dreſs
within theſe few years. The hoop has been known to expand and contract
itſelf from the ſize of a butter churn to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference of three
hogſheads; at one time it was ſloped from the waiſt in a pyramidical
form; at another it was bent upwards like an inverted bow, by which the two
angles, when ſqueezed up on each ſide, came in contact with the ears. At
preſent it is nearly of an oval form, and ſcarce meaſures from end to end
above twice the length of the wearer. The hoop has at preſent loſt much of
its credit in the female world, and has ſuffered much from the innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of
ſhort ſacks and negligées, which it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed are
equally becoming to the lady of pleaſure and the lady of quality: for as the
men will agree, that next to no cloaths at all nothing is more raviſhing than
an eaſy diſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bille, our ladies for that reaſon perhaps come into public
places, as if they were juſt got out of bed, or as if they were ready to go
into it. This, while it is the faſhion, muſt be agreeable; but I muſt own
that I could ſooner approve of their encirling themſelves in ſo many ells
of whalebone, than to ſee them affect to appear with their cloaths huddled on
ſo looſely and indecently. This manner of dreſſing, or rather not
dreſſing, was brought from <hi>Paris:</hi> but I would have my fair readers
conſider, that as this looſe method of dreſs is calculated to hide any
defects in the body, it is very impolitic to ſuffer all that ſymmetry and
elegant turn of ſhape they are miſtreſſes of, to be ſmothered under
it; ſince theſe habits can be of no more ſervice to their perſons, than
paint (that other <hi>Paris</hi> commodity) can add to the natural red and
white of their complexion, though perhaps it may heighten the ſallow
viſages of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="214" facs="tcp:1252700301:219"/>BUT of all the branches of female dreſs
none has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone more alterations than that of the head. The long lappets,
the horſe-ſhoe cap, the <hi>Bruſſels</hi> head, and the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh mob
pinned under the chin, have all of them had their day. The preſent mode has
rooted out all theſe ſuperfluous excreſcences, and in the room of a
ſlip of cambrick or lace has planted a whimſical ſprig of ſpangles or
artificial flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rets. We may remember, when for a while the hair was tortured
into ringlets behind: at preſent it is braided into a <hi>queüe,</hi>
(like thoſe formerly worn by the men, and ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the original
name of <hi>Ramillies,)</hi> which, if it were not reverted upwards, would make
us imagine that our fine ladies were afflicted with the <hi>Plica
Polonica.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF the caps have paſſed through many metamorphoſes, no
leſs a change has been brought about in the other cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings contrived for
the head. The diminitive high-crowned hat, the bonnet, the hive, and the
milkmaid's chip hat, were reſcued for a time from old women and ſervant
girls, to adorn heads of the firſt faſhion: nor was the method of cocking;
hats leſs fluctuating, till they were at length ſettled to the preſent
mode; by which it is ordered that every hat, whether of ſtraw or ſilk,
whether of the chambermaid or the miſtreſs, muſt have their flaps turned
up perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly both before and behind. If the end of a fine lady's dreſs
was not rather ornamental than uſeful, we ſhould think it a little odd that
hats, which ſeem naturally intended to ſcreen their faces from the heat or
ſeverity of the weather, ſhould be moulded into a ſhape that prevents
their anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either of theſe purpoſes: but we muſt indeed allow it
to be highly ornamental, as the preſent hats worn by the women are more bold
and impudent than the broad-brimmed ſtaring <hi>Kavenhullers</hi> worn a few
years ago by <pb n="215" facs="tcp:1252700301:220"/> the men. Theſe hats are alſo decorated
with two waving pendants of ribband, hanging down from the brim on the left
ſide. I am not ſo much offended at the flaming air which theſe
ſtreamers carry with them, as I am afraid leſt it ſhould ſpoil the
charming eyes of my pretty country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women, which are conſtantly provoked to
caſt a glance at them; and I have myſelf often obſerved, an obliging ogle
or raviſhing leer intercepted by theſe mediums, ſo that when a lady has
intended to charm her lover, ſhe has ſhocked him with an hideous
ſquint.</p>
               <p>THE ladies have long been ſeverely rallied on their too great
attention to finery: but to own the truth dreſs ſeems at preſent to be as
much the ſtudy of the male part of the world as the female. We have
gentlemen, who 
<q rend="inline">"will lay a whole night (as <hi>Benedick</hi>
ſays) carving the faſhion of a new doublet:"</q> they have their toilettes
too, as well as the ladies, ſet out with waſhes, perfumes and coſmetics,
and will ſpend the whole morning in dreſſing their hair, ſcenting their
linnen, and arching their eyebrows. Their heads (as well as the ladies) have
undergone various muta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and have worn as many different kinds of wigs, as
the block at their barbers. About fifty years ago they buried their heads in a
buſh of hair; and the beaux (as <hi>Swift</hi> ſays) lay hid beneath the
penthouſe of a full-bottomed perriwig. But as they then ſhewed nothing but
the noſe, mouth and eyes, the fine gentlemen of our time not only oblige us
with their full faces, but have drawn back the ſide curls quite to the tip of
the ear.</p>
               <p>AS <hi>France</hi> appears to be the wardrobe of the world, I
ſhall conclude my paper with a piece of ſecret hiſtory, which gives us
ſome inſight into the origin of deriving all our faſhions from
thence.—The celebrated Lord <hi>Foppington</hi> among his other amours
had once an intrigue with a milliner <pb n="216" facs="tcp:1252700301:221"/> of
<hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> who after ſome time brought a lovely girl into the
world, and called her after his lordſhip's ſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, FASHION. The milliner
brought up the child in her own houſe till the age of fifteen, at which time
ſhe grew very preſſing with Lord <hi>Foppington</hi> to make ſome
proviſion for his daughter. My lord, who was never much pleaſed with this
conſequence of his amours, that he might be rid of the girl for ever, put her
into the hands of a friend, who was going abroad, to place her in a nunnery:
but the girl, who had very little of the veſtal in her diſpoſition,
contrived to eſcape from her conductor, and fly to <hi>Paris.</hi> There her
beauty and ſprightlineſs ſoon ſecured her many friends; and ſhe
opened a genteel ſhop in her mother's buſineſs. She ſoon made herſelf
remarkable for contriving the moſt ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant head-dreſſes, and cutting out
ruffles with the moſt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhing ſlope: her fancy was beſides ſo
inexhauſtible, that ſhe almoſt every day produced a great variety of new
and beautiful patterns. She had many adorers, and at laſt mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his Moſt
Chriſtian Majeſty's taylor. This alliance brought the dreſs of all
<hi>Paris</hi> under their juriſdiction; and the young lady, out of a natural
love to her native country, propoſed the extending their care to the fine
gentlemen and ladies of <hi>London.</hi> In purſuance of this
<hi>Monſieur</hi> her huſband, two or three times in the year, ſends over
a ſuit of cloaths entirely <hi>à la Paris</hi> as a pattern to
<hi>Meſſieurs Regnier</hi> and <hi>Lynch</hi> of <hi>Leiceſter
Fields</hi> and <hi>Pall Mall,</hi> while his wife ſends over a little wooden
<hi>Mademoiſelle</hi> to her relations in <hi>Taviſtock Street.</hi>

the Art of Speaking in the Theatre, as alſo celebrated the practice of it in
the <hi>Robin Hood</hi> Society, my remarks will not be compleat, except I take
notice of the extraordinary eloquence of the <hi>Clare-Market</hi> Orator. He
deſires me to remember, that this Univerſal Genius has from time to time
declared from his Roſtrum with a thundering elocution,— 
<q rend="inline">"that there is but one Orator in the world, and
He is the man—that Sir <hi>Robert Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole</hi> and all the great men in
the kingdom, have been His ſcholars—and that Biſhops have come to His
Oratory to learn to preach."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="tcp:1252700301:223"/>I HAVE indeed obſerved with a good deal
of concern, that the Orator has of late diſcontinued to oblige the public
with his ſunday evening lectures as uſual. Inſtead of ſeeing his
Oratory-Chapel ſhut up, I was in hopes that every pariſh church in the
kingdom would be opened on the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. How much more ſalutary
were His tenets, ſetting forth the ſufficiency of Reaſon, than the cold
doctrine of our clergy preaching up the neceſſity of Faith! how ſuperior
was his form of prayer to our whole liturgy, and how much better adapted to
particular occaſions!— 
<q rend="inline">"A prayer for a ſinking bridge!—prayer
for the White Roſe!— prayer for <hi>Jackſon</hi>'s
Journal!—prayer for the heads on <hi>Temple-Bar!</hi>"</q>—In
theſe pious addreſſes he would firſt invoke the Supreme Being in the
moſt ſolemn manner; then ſuddenly ſlide into the familiar, and
pray,— 
<q rend="inline">"that we might not hear the croaking of
<hi>Dutch Nightingales</hi> in the king's chambers;"</q>—or on another
occaſion, 
<q rend="inline">"that our clergy might not ſtudy
<hi>Shakeſpear</hi> more than the Goſpel, and that they might be rather
employed on the Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, than <hi>As you like it,</hi> or <hi>Much ado
about nothing.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>I CANNOT but likewiſe lament the loſs of the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which his Advertiſements uſed to give us every Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turday in the
news-papers. The terms in which they were commonly expreſſed were clear and
elegant, and furniſhed the reader with an admirable idea of the Doctor's
manner from the pulpit. For inſtance, when he told you his text was from
<hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and quoted theſe words— 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Strt!</hi> 10 <hi>Jun! No Hnvr! Down with
the Rmp!</hi>"</q>—we might form a tolerable judgement of the great
reverence he paid the Bible; and when he called his Aſſembly— 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>The</hi> ORATORY—P. <hi>Charles's
Chapel</hi>"</q>—we might gueſs at his loyalty and patriotiſm.
Theſe were the advantages, which we derived <pb n="219" facs="tcp:1252700301:224"/> from his
Chapel; and if the Oratory remains ſhut, I ſhall begin to fear that things
will continue in their preſent ſhocking ſtate; and that the Scheme lately
propoſed in one of my papers <hi>for aboliſhing Chriſtianity</hi> will
not take effect; at which I am more particularly concerned, as it will hinder
the advancement of this great man. For if ſuch a revolution ſhould happen
in the church, the Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's principles would be found ſo entirely
fundamental, that he would probably then hold ſome honourable ſtation equal
to our preſent Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE public for theſe reaſons will doubtleſs join with me
in a petition, that this illuſtrious Divine would again reſume his
ſtation in the pulpit: at leaſt I could wiſh, that ſome able
Theologiſt, who has been long practiſed in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciding on the moſt
abſtruſe points of religion in the <hi>Robin Hood</hi> Society, may be
deputed in the abſence of the Orator to officiate as his curate. I would
alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to the above-mentioned Society to attend theſe lectures
regularly; from, whence they may gather ſtronger arguments for their
diſputations, than from reading <hi>Collins, Chubb, Tindal, Bolingbroke,</hi>
or any other orthodox free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinker whatever. Upon the whole I cannot conclude
without obſerving, that ſuch is the ingratitude of the age, that the
ſingular merits of our Orator are not ſufficiently regarded. He is indeed
deſervedly careſſed by the Butchers of <hi>Clare-Market:</hi> but had our
Orator been born at <hi>Athens</hi> or <hi>Rome,</hi> he would certainly have
been deified as the God of Butchers, have been worſhipped like
<hi>Iſis</hi> under the figure of a Calf, or have had a ſtatue erected to
him in the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum</hi> or <hi>Market</hi>-place among the Shambles.</p>
               <p>THUS much I thought myſelf bound to ſay in praiſe of the
Orator and Oratory; as he has ſome time ago done <pb n="220" facs="tcp:1252700301:225"/> me
the honour of a letter, which I am very glad of this opportunity to communicate
to my readers. The private epiſtles of <hi>Tully</hi> are very unequal to his

kept by a pretty coquet, a piece of furniture almoſt as neceſſary for a
coffee-room in that ſituation as the news papers. This lady, you may be
ſure, has many admirers, who are now and then glad of an opportunity to
relieve themſelves from the ſevere ſtudy of the law by a ſoft
converſation with this fair one, and repeating on the occaſion all the
tender things they can remember from plays, or whatever elſe <hi>Orgeat</hi>
or <hi>Cappillaire</hi> can inſpire. Among the many pretenders to her favour
there is one faithful ſwain, who has long entertained a ſerious paſſion
for her. This tender-hearted gentleman, who is grown ſo lean with living upon
love, that one would imagine 
<q rend="inline">"the blaſts of <hi>January</hi> 
                     <pb n="224" facs="tcp:1252700301:229"/> would blow him through and through,"</q> comes every
evening, and ſits whole hours by the bar, gazing at his miſtreſs, and
taking in large draughts of love and Hyſon tea. Never was ſwain in ſuch
cruel circumſtances. He is forced to bear with patience all the haughty
inſolence of this goddeſs of bread and butter; who, as ſhe knows him in
her power, keeps him at a diſtance, though ſhe behaves with the perteſt
familiarity to the other coxcombs, who are continually buzzing about her. At
eleven he ſneaks off pale and diſcontented; but cannot forbear coming again
the next evening, though he knows how vilely he ſhall be uſed by his
miſtreſs, and that he is laughed at even by the waiters.</p>
               <p>IF all true lovers were obliged, like this unhappy gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman,
to carry on their courtſhips in public, we ſhould be witneſs to many
ſcenes equally ridiculous. Their aukward deſire of pleaſing influences
every trivial geſture, and when once love has got poſſeſſion of a
man's heart, it ſhews itſelf down to the tips of his fingers. The
converſation of a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing <hi>inamorato</hi> is made up chiefly of
dumb ſigns, ſuch as ſighs, ogles, or glances: but if he offers to break
his paſſion to his miſtreſs, there is ſuch a ſtammering, faultering
and half-wording the matter, that the language of love, ſo much talked of by
poets, is in truth no language at all. Whoever ſhould break in upon a
gentleman and lady, while ſo critical a converſation is going forward,
would not forbear laughing at ſuch an extraordinary <hi>téte á
téte,</hi> and would perhaps cry out with <hi>Ranger,</hi> that 
<q rend="inline">"nothing looks ſo ſilly as a pair of your
true lovers."</q>
               </p>
               <p>SINCE true and ſincere love is ſure to make it's votaries
thus ridiculous, we cannot ſufficiently commend our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent people of
quality, who have made ſuch laudable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to deliver themſelves and
poſterity from its bondage. <pb n="225" facs="tcp:1252700301:230"/> In a faſhionable wedding
the man or woman are neither of them conſidered as reaſonable creatures,
who come together in order to 
<q rend="inline">"comfort, love, cheriſh, honour or obey,"</q>
according to their reſpective duties, but are regarded merely as
inſtruments of joining one eſtate to another. Acre marries acre; and to
increaſe and multiply their fortunes is in genteel matches the chief
conſideration of man and wife. The courtſhip is carried on by the council
of each party, and they pay their addreſſes by billet-deux upon parchment.
The great convenience of expelling love from matrimony is very evident: Married
perſons of quality are never troubled with each others company abroad, or
fatigued with dull matrimonial diſcourſes at home: My lord keeps his girl,
my lady has her gallant; and they both enjoy all the faſhionable privileges
of wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock without the inconveniences. This would never be the caſe, if
there was the leaſt ſpark of love ſubſiſting between them, but they
muſt be reduced to the ſame ſituation with thoſe wretches, who (as they
have nothing to ſettle on each other but themſelves) are obliged to make up
the deficiencies of fortune by affection. But while theſe miſerable, fond,
doating, unfaſhionable cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are obliged to content themſelves with love
and a cottage, people of quality enjoy the comforts of indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and a
coach and ſix.</p>
               <p>THE late Marriage Act is excellently adapted to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote this
prudential proceeding with reſpect to wedlock. It will in time inevitably
aboliſh the old ſyſtem of found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matrimony on affection; and marrying
for love will be given up for the ſake of marrying according to Act of
Parliament. There is now no danger of an handſome worthy young fellow of
ſmall fortune running away with an heireſs; for it is not ſufficient to
inſinuate himſelf into <pb n="226" facs="tcp:1252700301:231"/> the lady's favour by a
voluble tongue and a good per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, unleſs he can alſo ſubdue the
conſiderate parents or guardians by the merits of his rent-roll. As this Act
promotes the method of diſpoſing of children by way of bargain and ſale,
it conſequently puts an end to that ridiculous courtſhip, ariſing from
ſimple love. In order therefore to confirm (as far as poſſible) the happy
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of this act, I have been long endeavouring to hit on ſome
expedient, by which all the circumſtances preparatory to wedlock may be
carried on in a proper manner. A <hi>Smithfield</hi> bargain being ſo common
in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor, I had once ſome thoughts of propoſing to realize it, and had
almoſt completed a plan, by which all the young perſons (like ſervant
girls at a ſtatute-fair in the country) were to be brought to market, and
diſpoſed of in one part of <hi>Smithfield,</hi> while the ſheep and
horſes were on ſale in another.</p>
               <p>IN the midſt of theſe ſerious conſiderations I received
a ſcheme of this nature from my good friend Mr. KEITH, whoſe chapel the
late Marriage Act has rendered uſeleſs on its original principles. This
reverend gentleman, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that all huſbands and wives are henceforward to
be put up to ſale, propoſes ſhortly to open his chapel on a more new and
faſhionable plan. As the ingenious Meſſieurs <hi>Henſon</hi> and
<hi>Bever</hi> have lately opened in different quarters of the town
Repoſitories for all horſes to be ſold by auction; Mr. KEITH intends
ſetting up a Repoſitory for all young males and females to be diſpoſed
of in marriage. From theſe ſtuds (as the Doctor himſelf expreſſes it)
a lady of beauty may be coupled to a man of fortune, and an old gentleman, who
has a colt's tooth remaining, may match himſelf with a tight young filly.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:1252700301:232"/>THE Doctor makes no doubt but his Chapel
will turn out even more to his advantage on this new plan than on it's firſt
inſtitution, provided he can ſecure his ſcheme to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and reap
the benefits of it without interlopers from the <hi>Fleet.</hi> To prevent his
deſign being pirated, he intends peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the Parliament, that as he has
been ſo great a ſufferer by the Marriage Act, the ſole right of opening a
Repoſitory of this ſort may be veſted in him, and that his place of
reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in May Fair may ſtill continue the grand mart for marriages. Of

                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S I was paſſing the other night through a narrow little
lane in the ſkirts of the city, I was ſtopped by a grand proceſſion of
a hearſe and three mourning-coaches drawn by ſix horſes, accompanied with
a great number of flambeaus and attendants in black. I naturally concluded,
that all this parade was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to pay the laſt honours to ſome eminent
perſon, whoſe conſequence in life required that his aſhes ſhould
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all the reſpect which his friends and relations could pay to them:
but I could not help ſmiling, when upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry I was told, that the
corpſe (on whom all this expence had been laviſhed) was no other than
<hi>Tom Taſter</hi> the cheeſemonger, who had lain in ſtate all the week
at his <pb n="230" facs="tcp:1252700301:235"/> houſe in <hi>Thames-ſtreet,</hi> and was
going to be depoſited with his anceſtors in <hi>White-chapel</hi>
burying-ground. This illuſtrious perſonage was, I believe, the firſt of
his family, that ever thought of riding in a coach, living or dead: he was the
ſon of a butcher in <hi>White-chapel,</hi> and died indeed but in
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different circumſtances: his widow however, for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of
<hi>her</hi> family, was reſolved at all events to <hi>bury him
handſomely.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>YOU have already, Mr. <hi>TOWN,</hi> taken notice of that
ridiculous affectation among the middling ſort of people, which induces them
to make a figure beyond their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: I could wiſh that you would
alſo expoſe this equally abſurd vanity, which extends to the duſt, and
by which the dead are made acceſſory in robbing the living. I have
fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently known a greater ſum expended at the funeral of a tradeſman,
than would have kept his whole family for a twelvemonth; and it has more than
once happened, that the next heir has been flung into gaol for not being able
to pay the undertaker's bill.</p>
                     <p>THIS abſurd notion of being <hi>handſomely buried</hi> has
given riſe to the moſt contradictory cuſtoms, that could poſſibly be
contrived for the advantage of death-hunters. As funerals are at preſent
conducted, all diſtinction is loſt among us; and there is no more
difference between the duke and the dancing-maſter in the manner of their
burial, than is to be found between their duſt in the grave. It is eaſy to
account for the introduction of the hearſe and mourning-coach in our funeral
ceremonies, though their propriety is entirely deſtroyed by the promiſcuous
uſe of them. Our ancient and noble families may be ſuppoſed to have
particular family-vaults near their manſion-houſes in the country, and in
which their progenitors have been depoſited for ages. It is therefore very
natural that perſons of diſtinction, who had been uſed to be conveyed to
their country-ſeats by a ſet of horſes, ſhould be alſo tranſported
to their graves by the ſame number; and be attended with the ſame
magnificence at their deaths, which they had been accuſtomed to in their
lives. The ſpirit of affecting the manners of the great has 
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1252700301:236"/> from hence made others vie (as far as they can) with
people of quality in the pomp of their burials: a tradeſman, who has trudged
on foot all his life, ſhall be carried after death, ſcarce an hundred yards
from his houſe, with the equipage and retinue of a lord; and the plodding
cit, whoſe ambition never ſoared beyond the occaſional one-horſe-chair,
muſt be dragged to his long home by ſix horſes. Such an ill-timed
oſtentation of grandeur appears to me no leſs ridiculous than the vanity of
the highwayman, who ſold his body to the ſurgeons, that he might hire a
mourning-coach, and go to the gallows like a gentleman.</p>
                     <p>THERE is another cuſtom, which was doubtleſs firſt
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by the great, but has been ſince adopted by others, who have not
the leaſt title to it. The herald's office was originally inſtituted for
the diſtinction and preſervation of gentility; and nobody is allowed to
bear a coat of arms, but what belongs to the family, and who is intitled to
that honourable badge. From this conſideration we may account for the
practice of hanging the hearſe round with eſcutcheons, on which the arms of
the deceaſed were blazoned, and which ſerved to denote whoſe aſhes it
conveyed. For the ſame purpoſe an atchievement was afterwards fixed over
the door of the late habitation of the deceaſed. This enſign of death may
fairly be indulged, where the perſons are enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by their birth or
ſtation, and where it ſerves to remind the paſſer-by of any great or
good actions performed by the deceaſed, or to inſpire the living with an
emulation of their virtues. But why, forſooth, cannot an obſcure or
inſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant creature go out of the world, without advertiſing it by the
atchievement? For my part, I generally conſider it as a bill on an empty
houſe, which ſerves the widow to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that the former tenant is
gone, and that another occupier is wanted in his room. Many families have
indeed been very much perplexed in making out their right to this mark of
gentility, and great profit has ariſen to the herald's office by the
purchaſe of arms for this purpoſe. Many a worthy tradeſman of
<hi>plebeian</hi> extraction has been made a gentleman after his deceaſe by
the courteſy of his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker; and I once knew a keeper of a tavern, who
not <pb n="232" facs="tcp:1252700301:237"/> being able to give any account of his wife's
genealogy, put up his ſign, the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Arms,</hi> for an
atchievement at her death.</p>
                     <p>IT was the cuſtom, in the time of the plague, to fix a mark
on thoſe houſes, in which any one had died. This probably may have given
riſe to the general faſhion of hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up an atchievement. However this
be, it is now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned as a polite token, that a death has happened in the
family, and might reaſonably be underſtood as a warning to keep people from
intruding on their grief. No ſuch thing is, indeed, intended by it: I am
therefore of opinion, that it ought every-where to be taken down after the
firſt week. Whatever outward ſigns of mourning may be preſerved, no
regard is ever paid to them within: the ſame viſitings, the ſame
card-playings, are carried on as before; and ſo little reſpect is ſhewn
to the atchievement, that if it happens (as it often does) to interſect one
of the windows in the grand apartment, it is occaſionally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, whenever
the lady dowager has a route or drum-major.</p>
                     <p>THIS naturally leads me to conſider how much 
<q rend="inline">"the cuſtomary ſuits of ſolemn
black,"</q> and the other 
<q rend="inline">"trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings and ſigns of woe,"</q> are
become a mere farce and matter of form only. When a perſon of diſtinction
goes out of the world, not only the relations, but the whole houſehold,
muſt be cloathed in ſable. The kitchen-wench ſcours her diſhes in
crape, and the helper in the ſtables rubs down his horſes in black-leather
breeches. Every thing muſt put on a diſmal appearance: even the coach
muſt be covered and lined with black. This laſt particular, it is
reaſonable to imagine, is intended (like a death's head on the toilet) to put
the owner conſtantly in mind, that the pomp of the world and all gay
purſuits are but vain and periſhable. Yet what is more common than for
theſe diſmal vehicles to wait at the doors of the theatres, the
opera-houſe, and other public places of diverſion? Thoſe who are carried
in them are as little affected by their diſmal appearance as the horſes
that draw them; and I once ſaw <pb n="233" facs="tcp:1252700301:238"/> with great ſurprize
an harlequin, a ſcaramouch, a ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herdeſs, and a black ſattin devil,
get into a mourning coach to go to a jubilee maſquerade.</p>
                     <p>IF I ſhould not be thought to lay too much ſtreſs on the
leſſer formalities obſerved in mourning, I might mention the admirable
method of qualifying the melancholy hue of the mourning ring, by enlivening it
with the brilliancy of a diamond. I knew a young lady, who wore on the ſame
finger a ring ſet round with death's heads and croſs marrow bones for the
loſs of her father, and another prettily em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſhed with burning hearts
pierced through with darts, in reſpect to her lover. But what I moſt of all
admire is the odd contrivance, by which perſons ſpread the tidings of the
death of their relations to the moſt diſtant parts, by the means of
black-edged paper and black ſealing wax. If it were poſſible to inſpect
the ſeveral letters that bear about them theſe external tokens of grief, I
believe we ſhould hardly ever find the contents of the ſame gloomy
complexion: a luſcious ſonnet, or an amorous <hi>billet-doux,</hi> would be
much oftener found to be conveyed under theſe diſmal paſsports, than
doleful ditties or reflections on mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality: and indeed theſe mock ſigns
of woe are ſo little attended to, that a perſon opens one of theſe
letters with no more concern than is felt by the poſtman who brings it. Here
I muſt not forget mentioning the excellent fancy of a friend of mine, who has
greatly improved this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle: ever ſince the death of his wife he has made
uſe of black ſand, and writes with nothing but a crow-quill pen.</p>
                     <p>WE cannot ſuppoſe that black-edged paper was ever intended
to be defiled by vulgar hands, but contrived (like gilt paper) for the uſe of
the polite world only. But alas! we muſt always be aping the manners of our
betters! My agent ſends me letters about buſineſs upon gilt paper; and a
ſtationer near the <hi>'Change</hi> tells me, that he not only ſells a
great quantity of mourning paper to the citizens, but that he has lately
blacked the edges of <pb n="234" facs="tcp:1252700301:239"/> the ſhop-books for ſeveral
tradeſmen. You muſt have ſeen, Mr. <hi>TOWN,</hi> an elegant kind of
paper, imported from <hi>France</hi> for the uſe of our fine ladies and
gentlemen. An acquaintance of mine has contrived a new ſort of mourning paper
on the ſame plan: and as the margin of the other is prettily adorned with
flowers, true lovers knots, little cupids, and amorous poſies, in red ink; he
intends that the margin of his paper ſhall be diſmally ſtamped in black
ink with the figures of tomb-ſtones, hour-glaſſes, bones, ſkulls, and
other emblems of death, to be uſed by perſons of quality, when in
mourning.</p>

                     <p>THE whole tribe of Gameſters may be ranked under two

envy and admiration. The Dupe is generally a perſon of great fortune and weak
intellects,

                           <l>"Who will as tenderly be led by th' noſe</l> 
                           <l>"As aſſes are."</l> 
                           <bibl>SHAKESPEAR.</bibl>
                        </q> He plays, not that he has any
delight in cards or dice, but becauſe it is the faſhion; and if whiſt or
hazard are propoſed, he will no more refuſe to make one at the table, than
among a ſet of hard drinkers he would object drinking his glaſs in turn,
becauſe he is not dry.</p>
                     <p>THERE are ſome few inſtances of men of ſenſe, as well
as family and fortune, who have been dupes and bubbles. Such an unaccountable
itch of play has ſeized them that they have ſacrificed every thing to it,
and have ſeemed wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to ſeven's the main, and the odd trick. There is
not a more melancholy object than a gentleman of ſenſe thus infatuated. He
makes himſelf and family a prey to a gang of villains more infamous than
highwaymen; and perhaps when his ruin is completed, he is glad to join with the
very ſcoundrels that deſtroyed him, and live upon the ſpoils of others,
whom he can draw into the ſame follies that proved ſo fatal to
himſelf.</p>
                     <p>HERE we may take a ſurvey of the character of a Shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
and that he may have no room to complain of foul <pb n="237" facs="tcp:1252700301:242"/> play,
let us begin with his excellencies. You will perhaps be ſtartled, Mr. TOWN,
when I mention the excellencies of a Sharper; but a Gameſter who makes a
decent figure in the world, muſt be endued with many amiable qualities, which
would undoubtedly appear with great luſtre, were they not eclipſed by the
odious character affixed to his trade. In order to carry on the common
buſineſs of his profeſſion, he muſt be a man of quick and lively
parts, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a Stoical calmneſs of temper, and a conſtant
preſence of mind. He muſt ſmile at the loſs of thouſands, and is not
to be diſcompoſed, though ruin ſtares him in the face. As he is to live
among the great, he muſt not want politeneſs and affability; he muſt be
ſubmiſſive, but not ſervile; he muſt be maſter of an ingenuous
liberal air, and have a ſeeming openneſs of behaviour.</p>
                     <p>THESE muſt be the chief accompliſhments of our Hero: but
leſt I ſhould be accuſed of giving too favourable a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him,
now we have ſeen his outſide, let us take a view of his heart. There we
ſhall find avarice the main ſpring that moves the whole machine. Every
Gameſter is eaten up with avarice, and when this paſſion is in full
force, it is more ſtrongly predominant than any other. It conquers even
luſt; and conquers it more effectually than age. At ſixty we look at a fine
woman with pleaſure: but when cards and dice have engroſſed our
attention, women and all their charms are ſlighted at five and twenty. A
thorough Gameſter renounces <hi>Venus</hi> and <hi>Cupid</hi> for
<hi>Plutus</hi> and Ams<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ace, and owns no miſtreſs of his heart except the
Queen of Trumps. His inſatiable avarice can only be gratified by hypocriſy;
ſo that all thoſe ſpecious virtues already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and which, if
real, might be turned to the benefit of mankind, muſt be directed in a
Gameſter towards the deſtruction of his fellow-creatures. His quick and
lively <pb n="238" facs="tcp:1252700301:243"/> parts are only to inſtruct and aſſiſt him
in the moſt dextrous method of packing the cards and cogging the dice: his
for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, which enables him to loſe thouſands without emotion, muſt
often be practiſed againſt the ſtings and reproaches of his own
conſcience; and his liberal deportment and affected openneſs is only to
recommend and conceal the blackeſt villainy.</p>
                     <p>IT is now neceſſary to take a ſecond ſurvey of his
heart, and as we have ſeen it's vices let us conſider it's miſeries. The
covetous man who has not ſufficient cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage or inclination to encreaſe his
fortune by bets, cards, or dice, but is contented to hoard up his thouſands
by thefts leſs public, or by cheats leſs liable to uncertainty, lives in a
ſtate of perpetual ſuſpicion and terror; but the avaritious fears of the
Gameſter, are infinitely greater. He is conſtantly to wear a maſk, and
like <hi>Monſieur St. Croix,</hi> coadjutor to that famous
<hi>empoiſonneuſe Madame Brinvillier,</hi> if his maſk falls off, he runs
the hazard of being ſuffocated by the ſtench of his own poiſons. I have
ſeen ſome ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of this ſort, not many years ago at <hi>White</hi>'s.
I am uncertain whether the wretches are ſtill alive, but if they are, they
breath like toads under ground, crawling amidſt old walls, and paths long
ſince unfrequented.</p>
                     <p>BUT ſuppoſing that the Sharper's hypocriſy remains
undetected, in what a ſtate of mind muſt that man be whoſe fortune
depends upon the inſincerity of his heart, the diſingenuity of his
behaviour, and the falſe biaſs of his dice? What ſenſations muſt he
ſuppreſs when he is obliged to ſmile, although he is provoked: when he
muſt look ſerene in the height of deſpair, and when he muſt act the
Stoic, without the conſolation of one virtuous ſentiment, or one moral
principle? How unhappy muſt he be even in <pb n="239" facs="tcp:1252700301:244"/> that
ſituation, from which he hopes to reap moſt benefit? I mean, amidſt
ſtars, garters, and the various herds of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility? Their lordſhips are not
always in an humour for play: they chuſe to laugh; they chuſe to joke; in
the mean while our hero muſt patiently await the good hour, and muſt not
only join in the laugh, and applaud the jokes, but muſt humour every turn and
caprice, to which that ſet of ſpoiled children called bucks of quality are
liable. Surely his brother <hi>Thicket</hi>'s employment of ſauntring on
horſeback in the wind and rain till the <hi>Reading</hi> coach paſſes
through <hi>Smallberry-Green,</hi> is the more eligible, and no leſs
honeſt, occupation.</p>
                     <p>THE Sharper has alſo frequently the mortification of being
thwarted in his deſigns. Opportunities of fraud will not for ever preſent
themſelves. The falſe die cannot be conſtantly produced, nor the packed
cards perpetually be placed upon the table. It is then our gameſter is in the
greateſt danger. But even then when he is in the power of fortune, and has
nothing but meer luck and fair play on his ſide, he muſt ſtand the brunt,
and perhaps give away his laſt guinea, as coolly as he would lend a nobleman
a ſhilling.</p>
                     <p>OUR hero is now going off the ſtage, and his cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe
is very tragical: the next news we hear of him is his death, atchieved by his
own hand, and with his own piſtol. An inqueſt is bribed, he is buried at
midnight, and forgotten before ſun-riſe.</p>
                     <p>THESE two portraits of a Sharper, wherein I have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to ſhew different likeneſſes in the ſame man, puts me in mind of an old
print, which I remember at <pb n="240" facs="tcp:1252700301:245"/> 
                        <hi>Oxford,</hi> of Count
<hi>Guiſcard.</hi> At firſt ſight he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in a full-bottom wig,
a hat and feather, embroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered cloaths, diamond buttons, and the full
court-dreſs of thoſe days: but by pulling a ſtring, the folds of the
paper were ſhifted, the face only remained, a new body came forward, and
Count <hi>Guiſcard</hi> appeared to be a DEVIL.</p>

                           <p> I WAS in hopes I ſhould have met you at
<hi>Newmarket</hi> races, but to ſay the truth, if your luck had turned out
ſo bad as mine, you did better to ſtay away. <hi>Dick Riot, Tom
Lowngeit,</hi> and I went together to <hi>Newmarket</hi> the firſt day of the
meeting. I was mounted on my little bay-mare that coſt me thirty guineas in
the North. I never croſſed a better tit in my life, and if her eyes
ſtand, as I dare ſay they will, ſhe will turn out as tight a little Thing
as any in <hi>England.</hi> Then ſhe is as fleet as the wind. Why, I raced
with <hi>Dick</hi> and <hi>Tom</hi> all the way from <hi>Cambridge</hi> to
<hi>Newmarket: Dick</hi> rode his roan gelding, and <hi>Tom</hi> his cheſnut
mare (which, you know, have both ſpeed) but I beat them <hi>hollow.</hi> I
cannot help telling you that I was dreſſed in my blue riding-frock with
plate-buttons, with a leather belt round my waſte, my jemmy turn-down boots
made by <hi>Tull,</hi> my brown ſcratch bob, and my hat with the
narrow-ſilver lace cocked in the true ſporting taſte: ſo that
altogether I don't believe there was a more <hi>knowing</hi> figure upon the
Courſe. I was very fluſh too, <hi>Jack</hi>; for <hi>Michaelmas-day</hi>
happening damned luckily juſt about the time of the races, I had juſt
received fifty guineas for my quarteridge. As ſoon as I came upon the
Courſe, I met with ſome jolly bucks from <hi>London.</hi> I never ſaw
them before; however we were ſoon acquainted, and I took up the Odds: but I
was damnably let in, for I loſt thirty pieces ſlap the firſt day. The day
or two after I had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable <pb n="243" facs="tcp:1252700301:248"/> luck one way or the
other; but at laſt I laid all the Caſh I had left upon Lord
<hi>March</hi>'s <hi>Smart,</hi> who loſt, you know, but between you and me,
I have a great notion <hi>Tom Marſhall</hi> rode booty. However I had a mind
to puſh my luck as far as I could; ſo I ſold my poor little mare for
twelve pieces, went to the coffee-houſe, and left them all behind me at the
gaming table; and I ſhould not have been able to have got back to
<hi>Cambridge</hi> that night, if <hi>Bob Whip</hi> of <hi>Trinity</hi> had not
taken me up into his Phaeton. We have had a round of dinners at our rooms
ſince, and I have been drunk every day to drive away care. However I hope to
recruit again ſoon: <hi>Frank Claſſic</hi> of <hi>Pembroke</hi> has
promiſed to make me out a long catalogue of <hi>Greek</hi> books, ſo I will
write directly to Old Squaretoes, ſend him the liſt, tell him I have taken
them up, and draw on him for money to pay the bookſeller's bill. Then I
ſhall be rich again, <hi>Jack</hi>; and perhaps you may ſee me at the

                     <p>I HAVE often lamented the narrow plan of our Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
Education, and always obſerve with pleaſure any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to enlarge and
improve it. In this light I cannot help looking on <hi>Newmarket</hi> as a
judicious ſupplement to the Univerſity of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and would
recommend it to the young ſtudents to repair duly thither twice a year. By
theſe means they may connect the knowledge of polite life with ſtudy, and
come from college as deeply verſed in the genteel myſteries of Gaming, as
in <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi> and the Mathematicks. Attending theſe ſolemnities
muſt indeed be of great ſervice to every rank of ſtudents. Thoſe who
are <pb n="244" facs="tcp:1252700301:249"/> intended for the Church have an opportunity of
tempering the ſeverity of their character by a happy mixture of the jockey
and clergyman. I have known ſeveral who by uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting theſe oppoſite
qualifications, and meeting with a patron of their own diſpoſition, have
rode themſelves into a living in a good ſporting country; and I doubt not,
if the excurſions of gownſmen to <hi>Newmarket</hi> meet with the
encouragement they deſerve, but we ſhall ſhortly ſee the Beacon
Courſe crouded with ordained ſportſmen in ſhort caſſocks. As to the
Fellow-Commoners, I do not ſee how they can paſs their time more
profitably. The ſole intention of their reſidence at the Univerſity is,
with moſt of them, to while away a couple of years, which they cannot
conveniently diſpoſe of otherwiſe. Their rank exempts them from the
common drudgery of lectures and exerciſes, and the Golden Tuft that adorns
their velvet caps is at once a badge of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and an apology for ignorance.
But as ſome of theſe gentlemen, though they never will be ſcholars, may
turn out excellent jockeys, it is but juſtice to let them carry ſome kind
of knowledge away with them; and as they can never ſhine as adepts in Sir
<hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s Philoſophy, or critics on <hi>Homer</hi> and
<hi>Virgil,</hi> ſuffer them to make a figure as arbiters of the Courſe,
and followers of <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Driver.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>I AM the more earneſt on this occaſion, becauſe I look
upon Races as a diverſion, peculiarly adapted to an Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, and
founded upon claſſical principles. Every author who has mentioned the
Antient Games, includes the Race, and deſcribes it with great dignity. This
Game was always celebrated with great pomp, and all the <hi>people of
faſhion</hi> of thoſe days were preſent at it. In the twenty third
<hi>Iliad</hi> in particular there is not only a diſpute at the Race, but a
bet propoſed in as expreſs terms as at <hi>Newmarket.</hi> The wager 
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1252700301:250"/> offered indeed is a goblet, which is not entirely in the
man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of our modern ſportſmen, who rather chuſe to melt down their
plate into the current ſpecie, and bring their ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boards to the courſe
in their purſes. I am aware alſo that the Races celebrated by the ancients
were Chariot-Races: but even in theſe our young ſtudents of the
Univerſity have great emulation to excell: There are among them many very
good coachmen who often make excurſions in thoſe noble vehicles with great
propriety called <hi>Phaetons,</hi> and drive with as much fury along the road,
as the charioteers in the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Game flew towards the goal. In a word, if we
have not ſuch noble Odes on this occaſion as were produced of old, it is
not for want of a <hi>Theron</hi> but a <hi>Pindar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE Advices which I have at ſeveral times received of the
influence of the Races at <hi>Newmarket</hi> on the Univerſity give me great
pleaſure. It has not only improved the beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the ſtudents but
enlarged their plan of ſtudy. They are now very deeply read in
<hi>Bracken</hi>'s <hi>Farriery</hi> and the <hi>Compleat Jockey,</hi> know
exactly how many ſtone they weigh, and are pretty competent judges of the
Odds. I went ſome time ago to viſit a fellow-commoner, and when I arrived
at his chambers, found the door open, but my friend was not at home. The room
was adorned with <hi>Seymour</hi>'s prints of horſes neatly framed and
glazed, a hat and whip hung on one hook, a pair of boots on another, and on the
table lay a formidable Quarto with the <hi>Sportſman</hi>'s <hi>Calendar</hi>
by <hi>Reginald Heber,</hi> Eſq<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. I had the curioſity to examine the book,
and as the college is remarkable for the ſtudy of philoſophy, I expected to
ſee <hi>Newton</hi>'s <hi>Principia,</hi> or perhaps <hi>Sanderſon</hi>'s
<hi>Algebra:</hi> but on opening it, this huge volume proved to be a pompous
edition of <hi>Gibſon</hi>'s <hi>Treatiſe on the Diſeaſes of
Horſes.</hi>

                        <pb n="246" facs="tcp:1252700301:251"/>THESE indeed are noble ſtudies, will
preſerve our youth from pedantry, and make them men of the world. Men of
genius who are pleaſed with the theory of any art, will not be contented
'till they arrive at the practice. I am told that the young gentlemen often try
the ſpeed of the <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge</hi> Nags on the Beacon Courſe, and that
ſeveral hacks are at preſent in training. I have often wondered that the
gentlemen who form the club at <hi>Newmarket</hi> never reflected on their
neighbourhood to <hi>Cambridge,</hi> nor eſtabliſhed (in honour of it) an
Univerſity Plate, to be run for by <hi>Camſbrige</hi> hacks, rode by young
gentlemen of the Univerſity. A hint of this kind will certainly be
ſufficient to have this laudable deſign put in practice the very next
meeting; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help reflecting on this occaſion, what an
unſpeakable ſatisfaction it muſt be to thoſe perſons of quality who
are conſtantly at <hi>Newmarket,</hi> to ſee their ſons cheriſh the

oration, interſperſed with encomiums on the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
is ſpoken in praiſe of the author, who, in the phraſe 
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1252700301:253"/> of the almanack, gives the red letter to the day. They
have alſo eſtabliſhed a fund, from which handſome rewards are allotted
to thoſe who ſhall ſupply the place of any exotic terms that have been
ſmuggled into our language by homeſpun <hi>Britiſh</hi> words equally
ſignificant and expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. An order is alſo made againſt importing
any contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band phraſes into the Club, by which heavy fines are laid on
thoſe who ſhall have any modiſh barbariſms found upon them: whether
they be foreign words, antient or modern, or any cant terms coined by <hi>The
Town</hi> for the ſervice of the current year.</p>
               <p>THE whole account which I received from my friend gave me great
ſatisfaction: and I never remember any ſociety that met together on ſuch
commendable principles. Their proceedings it muſt however be confeſſed
are ſomewhat unfaſhionable; for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue is become as
little the general care as <hi>Engliſh</hi> Beef, or <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Honeſty. Young gentlemen are obliged to drudge at ſchool for nine or ten
years in order to ſcrape together as much <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi>
as they can forget during their tour abroad, and have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly at the ſame
time a private maſter to give them <hi>French</hi> enough to land them with
ſome reputation at <hi>Calais.</hi> This is to be ſure very prudent as well
as genteel. Yet ſome people are perverſe enough to imagine that to teach
boys a foreign language, living or dead, without at the ſame time grounding
them in their Mother Tongue is a very prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous plan of education. The
<hi>Romans,</hi> though they ſtudied at <hi>Athens,</hi> directed their
ſtudies to the benefit of their own country, and though they read
<hi>Greek,</hi> wrote in <hi>Latin.</hi> There are at this day in
<hi>France</hi> Academies eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for the ſupport and preſervation
of the <hi>French</hi> lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage: and perhaps, if to the preſent
Profeſſorſhips of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> there ſhould be
added a Profeſſorſhip of the <pb n="249" facs="tcp:1252700301:254"/> 
                  <hi>Engliſh</hi>
language, it would be no diſgrace to our learned Univerſities.</p>
               <p>WHEN we conſider that our language is preferable to moſt if
not all others now in being, it ſeems ſomething extraordinary that any
attention ſhould be paid to a foreign Tongue that is refuſed to our own,
when we are likely to get ſo little by the exchange. But when we reflect
further on the remarkable purity to which ſome late authors have brought it,
we are ſtill more concerned at the preſent neglect of it. This ſhameful
neglect I take to be owing chiefly to theſe two reaſons, the falſe pride
of thoſe who are eſteemed men of learning, and the ridiculous affectation
of our fine gentlemen, and pretenders to wit.</p>
               <p>IN complaiſance to our fine gentlemen, who are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
the allowed ſtandards of politeneſs, I ſhall begin with them firſt.
Their converſation exactly anſwers the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which
<hi>Benedick</hi> gives of <hi>Claudio</hi>'s: 
<q rend="inline">"their words are a very fantaſtical banquet,
juſt ſo many ſtrange diſhes."</q> Theſe diſhes too are all
<hi>French</hi>; and I do not know whether their converſation does not a good
deal depend on their bill of fare, and whether the thin meagre diet, on which
our ſine gentlemen ſubſiſt, does not in ſome meaſure take away the
power of that bold articulation neceſſary to give utterance to manly
<hi>Britiſh</hi> accents: whence their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion becomes ſo 
<q rend="inline">"fantaſtical a banquet,"</q> and every
ſentence they deliver almoſt as heterogeneous a mixture as a ſalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy.
A faſhionable coxcomb now never complains of the vapours, but tells you that
he is very much <hi>ennuyèe.</hi>—He does not affect to be genteel
but <hi>degagèe</hi>—nor is he taken with an elegant ſimplicity
in a beautiful countenance, but breaks out in raptures on a <hi>je
ne-ſcay-quoi,</hi> and a certain <hi>naivetè.</hi> In a word, his head
as well as his heels is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely <pb n="250" facs="tcp:1252700301:255"/> 
                  <hi>French,</hi> and
he is a thorough <hi>petit maitre</hi> in his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as well as behaviour.
But notwithſtanding ail this, I do not know whether the converſation of our
pretenders to wit is not ſtill more barbarous. When they talk of
<hi>Humbug,</hi> &amp;c. they ſeem to be jabbering in the uncouth dialect of
the <hi>Huns,</hi> or the rude gabble of the <hi>Hottentots:</hi> or if their
words are at all allied to the language of this country, it probably comes
neareſt to the ſtrange cant ſaid to be in uſe among houſebreakers and
highwaymen; and if their jargon will bear any explanation, the curious are
moſt likely to meet with it in a polite vocabulary lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed under
the title of the <hi>Scoundrel's Dictionary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MANY who are accounted men of learning, if they do not join with
fops and coxcombs to corrupt our language, at leaſt do very little to promote
it, and are ſometimes very indifferently acquainted with it. There are many
perſons of both our Univerſities who can decypher an old <hi>Greek</hi>
manuſcript, and conſtrue <hi>Lycophron extempore,</hi> who ſcarce know
the idiom of their own language, and are at a loſs how to diſpatch a
familiar letter with tolerable facility. Theſe gentlemen ſeem to think that
learning conſiſts merely in being verſed in languages not generally
underſtood. But it ſhould be conſidered, that the ſame Genius which
animated the Ancients has diſpenſed at leaſt ſome portion of it's heat
to later ages, and particularly to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> Thoſe who are
really charmed with <hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Sophocles</hi> will hardly read
<hi>Shakeſpear</hi> and <hi>Milton</hi> without emotion, and if I was
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to carry on the parallel, I could perhaps mention as many great names
as <hi>Athens</hi> ever produced. 
<q> 
                     <l>Multa poetarum veniet manus, auxilio quae</l> 
                     <l>Sit mihi.—</l> 
                     <bibl>HOR.</bibl>
                  </q> The knowledge of <hi>Greek, Latin,</hi>
&amp;c. is certainly very <pb n="251" facs="tcp:1252700301:256"/> valuable, but this may be
attained without the loſs of their Mother Tongue: for theſe reverend
gentlemen ſhould know that languages are not like preferments in the Church,
too many of which cannot be held together.</p>
               <p>THIS great neglect of our own Tongue is one of the principal
reaſons that we are ſo ſeldom favoured with any publications from either
of our Univerſities, which we might expect very often in conſideration of
the great number of learned men who reſide there. The preſs being thus
deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe who might naturally be expected to ſupport it, falls
to the care of a ſet of illiterate hirelings, in whoſe hands it is no
wonder if the language is every day mangled, and ſhould at laſt be utterly
deſtroyed. Writing is well known to be at preſent as much a trade as any
handicraft whatever, and every man who can vamp up any thing for preſent
ſale, though void of ſenſe or Syntax, is liſted by the bookſellers as
an author. But allowing all our preſent writers to be men of parts and
learning (as there are doubtleſs ſome who may be reckoned ſo) is it
probable that they ſhould exert their abilities to the utmoſt, when they do
not write for fame, like the Ancients, but as a means of ſubſiſtance. If
<hi>Herodotus</hi> and <hi>Livy</hi> had ſold their hiſtories at ſo much
a ſheet, and all the other <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Claſſics had
written in the ſame circumſtances with many modern authors, they would
hardly have merited all that applauſe they ſo juſtly receive at
preſent. The plays of <hi>Sophocles</hi> and <hi>Euripides</hi> might perhaps
not have been much better than modern Tragedies; <hi>Virgil</hi> might have got
a dinner by half a dozen <hi>Town Eclogues</hi>; and <hi>Horace</hi> have wrote
Birth-day Odes, or now and then a lampoon on the company at the
<hi>Baiae.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A FALSE modeſty is another great cauſe of the few
publications by men of eminence and learning. However <pb n="252" facs="tcp:1252700301:257"/>
equal to the taſk, they have not ſufficient confidence to venture to the
preſs, but are rather guilty of wilful injuſtice to themſelves and to the
public. They are alſo aſhamed of appearing among the common herd of
authors. But the preſs, though it is often abuſed, ſhould by no means be
accounted ſcandalous or diſhonourable. Though a learned and ingenious
writer might not chuſe to be muſtered in the ſame roll with —
— — or Mr. TOWN, yet we have a HOOKE, a BROWNE, an AKINSIDE, and
many others in whoſe company it will be an honour to appear. I would not
willingly ſuppoſe that they are afraid to hazard the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters they now
maintain of being men of learning and abilities; for while we only take theſe
things for granted, their reputations are but weakly eſtabliſhed. To
reſcue our Native Language from the hands of ignorants and mercenaries is a
taſk worthy thoſe who are accounted orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of our Seats of Learning;
and it is ſurely more than common ingratitude in thoſe who eat the bread of
lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature to refuſe their utmoſt endeavours to ſupport it.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> FEW years ago an ingenious player gave notice in the bills
for his Benefit Night, that the Prologue ſhould be ſpoken by the Pit, which
he contrived to have repreſented on the ſtage. Another time he drew in the
whole houſe to act as Chorus to a new farce, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that in the
laſt rebellion the loyal acclamations of 
<q rend="inline">"God ſave the King"</q> might have been heard
from <hi>Drury Lane</hi> to <hi>Charing Croſs.</hi> Upon theſe and many
other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions the audience has been known to enter into the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
buſineſs of the Drama; and, to ſay the truth, I never go into the theatre
without looking on the ſpectators as playing a part almoſt as much as the
actors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. <pb n="254" facs="tcp:1252700301:259"/> All the company from the
ſtage-box to the upper gallery know their cues very well, and perform their
parts with great ſpirit. I begun the ſeaſon with a few ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions
on the chief faults to which our performers are liable. To-day I ſhall beg
leave to ſay a word or two to the Audience, as my reflections on the theatre
would otherwiſe be incomplete. On this occaſion I expect the thanks of the
managers, and would recommend it to them to put my thirty fourth number into a
frame and glaſs, and hang it up in the Green Room for the benefit of the
play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; and to diſpoſe three or four thouſand of the preſent number
into the ſeveral parts of the houſe, as <hi>Bayes</hi> diſperſed papers
to inſinuate the plot of his piece into the boxes.</p>
               <p>THE firſt part of the audience that demands our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is
ſo nearly allied to the actors that they always appear on the ſame level
with them: but while the performer endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to carry on the buſineſs of
the play, theſe gentlemen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind the ſcenes ſerve only to hinder and
diſturb it. There is no part of the houſe from which a play can be ſeen
to ſo little advantage as from the ſtage; yet this ſituation is very
convenient on many other conſiderations, of more conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to a fine
gentleman. It looks particular; it is the beſt place to ſhew a handſome
perſon, or an elegant ſuit of cloaths: a bow from the ſtage to a beauty
in the box is moſt likely to attract our notice; and a pretty fellow may
perhaps with tolerable management get the credit of an intrigue with ſome of
the actreſſes. But notwithſtanding all theſe advantages accruing to our
fine gentlemen, I could heartily wiſh they would leave a clear ſtage to the
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers; or at leaſt that none ſhould be admitted behind the ſcenes,
but ſuch as would ſubmit to be of ſome uſe there. As theſe gentlemen
are ready dreſt, they might help to ſwell the retinue of a monarch, join
the engagement in <pb n="255" facs="tcp:1252700301:260"/> a Tragedy-battle, or do any other
little office that might occur in the play, which requires but little ſenſe
and no memory. But if they have not any genius for acting, and are ſtill
deſirous of retaining their poſts by the ſide-ſcenes, they ſhould be
obliged to take a muſket, bayonet, pouch, and the reſt of the
accoutrements, and ſtand on guard quietly and decently with the
ſoldiers.</p>
               <p>THE boxes are often filled with perſons who do not come to the
theatre out of any regard to <hi>Shakeſpear</hi> or <hi>Garrick,</hi> but
like the fine lady in <hi>Lethe,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"becauſe every body is there."</q> As theſe
people cannot be expected to mind the play them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we can only deſire
them not to call off the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others; nor interrupt the dialogue on
the ſtage by a louder converſation of their own. The ſilent courtſhip
of the eyes, ogles, nods, glances, and curtſies from one box to another may
be allowed them the ſame as at church, but nothing more, except at
Coronations, Funeral Proceſſions and Pantomimes. Here I cannot help
recommending it to the gentlemen, who draw the pen from under their right ears
about ſeven o'clock, clap on a bag-wig and ſword, and drop into the boxes
at the end of the third act, to take their halfcrown's worth with as much
decency as poſſible; as well as the Bloods who reel from the taverns about
<hi>Covent Garden</hi> near that time, and tumble drunk into the boxes. Before
I quit this part of the houſe I muſt take notice of that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the
upper-boxes, properly diſtinguiſhed by the name of the Fleſh Market.
There is frequently as much art uſed to make the fleſh exhibited here look
wholſome, and (as <hi>Tim</hi> ſays in the farce) 
<q rend="inline">"all over red and white like the inſide of a
ſhoulder of mutton,"</q> as there is by the butchers to make their veal look
white; and it is as often rank carrion and flyblown. If theſe ladies would
appear <pb n="256" facs="tcp:1252700301:261"/> in any other quarter of the houſe, I would only
beg of Them and thoſe who come to market, to drive their bargains with as
little noiſe as poſſible: but I have lately obſerved with ſome
concern that theſe women begin to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the lower boxes to the
deſtruction of all order, and great confuſion of all modeſt ladies. It is
to be hoped that ſome of their friends will adviſe them not to pretend to
appear there any more than at court: for it is as abſurd to endeavour the
removal of their market into the front and ſide boxes, as it would be in the
butchers of St. <hi>James's Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> to attempt fixing the ſhambles in
St. <hi>James's Square.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I MUST now deſire the reader to deſcend with me among laced
hats and capuchines into the Pit. The Pit is the grand Court of Criticiſm,
and in the center of it is collected that awful body, diſtinguiſhed by the
title of <hi>the Town.</hi> Hence are iſſued the irrevocable decrees, and
here final ſentence is pronounced on plays and players. This Court has often
been very ſevere in its deciſions, and has been known to declare many old
plays barbarouſly murdered, and moſt of our modern ones <hi>Felo de
ſe;</hi> but it muſt not be diſſembled that many a cauſe of great
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence has been denied a fair hearing. Parties and private cabals have
often been formed to thwart the progreſs of merit, or to eſpouſe
ignorance and dullneſs; for it is not wonderfull that the Parliament of
Criticiſm, like all others, ſhould be liable to corruption. In this
aſſembly Mr. TOWN was firſt nominated CRITIC and CENSOR-GENERAL; but
conſidering the notorious bribery now prevailing, I think proper to declare,
(in imitation of <hi>Tom</hi> in the <hi>Conſcious Lovers)</hi> that I never
took a ſingle Order for my vote in all my life.</p>
               <p>THOSE who pay their two ſhillings at the door of the 
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1252700301:262"/> Middle Gallery ſeem to frequent the theatre purely for
the ſake of ſeeing the play. Though theſe peaceful regions are
ſometimes diſturbed by the incurſions of rattling ladies of pleaſure;
ſometimes contain perſons of faſhion in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, and ſometimes
critics in ambuſh. The greateſt fault I have to object to thoſe who fill
this quarter of the thea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, is their frequent and injudicious interruption of
the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the play by their applauſe. I have ſeen a bad actor
clapt two minutes together for ranting, or perhaps ſhrugging his ſhoulders,
and making wry faces: and I have ſeen the natural courſe of the
paſſions checked in a good one, by theſe ill-judged teſtimonies of
their approbation. It is recorded of <hi>Betterton</hi> to his honour, that he
thought a deep ſilence through the whole houſe, and a ſtrict attention to
his playing, the ſtrongeſt and ſureſt ſigns of his being well
received.</p>
               <p>THE inhabitants of the Upper-Gallery demand our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice as well
as the reſt of the theatre. The Trunk Maker of immortal memory was the moſt
celebrated hero of theſe regions; but ſince he is departed, and no
able-bodied critic appointed in his room, I cannot help giving the ſame
caution to the Upper-Gallery as to the gentry a pair of ſtairs lower. Some of
the under-comedians will perhaps be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed at this order, who are
proud of theſe applauſes, and rejoice to hear the luſty bangs from the
oaken towels of their friends againſt the wainſcoat of the Upper-Gallery;
but I think they ſhould not be allowed to ſhatter the pannels without
amending our taſte; ſince their thwacks, however vehement, are ſeldom
laid on with ſufficient judgment to ratify our applauſe. It were better
therefore if all the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent twelvepenny critics of this town, who preſide
over our diverſions in the Upper-Gallery, would content themſelves with the
inferior duties of their office; <hi>viz.</hi> to take care 
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:1252700301:263"/> that the play begins at the proper time, that the
muſic be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the acts is of a due length, and that the candles are
ſnuffed in tune.</p>
               <p>AFTER theſe brief admonitions concerning our behaviour at the
play, which are intended as a kind of <hi>vade mecum</hi> for the frequenters
of the theatre, I cannot conclude my paper more properly than with an extract
from the <hi>Tale of a Tub</hi> ſhewing the judicious diſtribution of our
playhouſes into Boxes, Pit, and Galleries.</p>
               <q>I CONFESS, that there is ſomething very refined in the
contrivance and ſtructure of our modern theatres. For, firſt; the pit is
ſunk below the ſtage that whatever <hi>weighty</hi> matter ſhall be
delivered thence (whether it be <hi>lead</hi> or <hi>gold)</hi> may fall plum
into the jaws of certain <hi>critics</hi> (as I think they are called) which
ſtand ready opened to devour them. Then, the boxes are built round, and
raiſed to a level with the ſcene, in deference to the ladies; becauſe,
that large portion of wit, laid out in raiſing pruriences and protuberances,
is obſerved to run much upon a line, and ever in a circle. The whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
paſſions, and little ſtarved conceits, are gently wafted up by their own
extreme levity, to the middle region, and there fix and are frozen by the
frigid under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings of the inhabitants. Bombaſtry and buffoonry, by
nature lofty and light, ſoar higheſt of all, and would be loſt in the
roof, if the prudent architect had not with much foreſight contrived for them
a fourth place, called <hi>the Twelve-Penny-Gallery,</hi> and there planted a
ſuitable co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, who greedily intercept them in their paſſage.</q>

The plain old <hi>Engliſh</hi> word Wife has long been diſcarded in our
converſation, as being only fit for the broad mouths of the vulgar. A
well-bred ear is ſtartled at the very ſound of Wife, as at a coarſe and
indelicate expreſſion; and I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to any faſhionable couple, whether
they would not be as much aſhamed to be mentioned together as man and wife,
as they would to appear together at court in a farthingale and trunk-breeches.
From <hi>Hyde Park Corner</hi> to <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> this monſter of a Wife
has not been heard of ſince the antiquated times of Dame and Your Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
and in the city every good houſe-wife is at leaſt <hi>a Lady of the other
end of the town.</hi> In the country you might as well diſpute the
pretenſions of every foxhunter to <pb n="261" facs="tcp:1252700301:268"/> the title of
Eſquire, as of his help-mate to that of Lady; and in every corporation town
whoever matches with a burgeſs becomes a Lady by right of charter. My
couſin VILLAGE, (from whom I have all my rural intelligence,) informs me,
that upon the ſtrictreſt enquiry there is but one Wife in the town where he
now lives, and that is the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's Wife, who is never mentioned by the
country Ladies but as a dowdy, and an old-faſhioned creature. Such is the
great privilege of matrimony, that every female is enno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled by changing her
ſurname: for as every unmarried woman is a Miſs, every married one by the
ſame courteſy is a Lady.</p>
               <p>THE next order of dignified females is compoſed of Maiden or
Young Ladies; which terms are ſynonymous, and are indifferently applied to
females of the age of fourteen or threeſcore. We muſt not therefore be
ſurprized to hear of Maiden Ladies, who are known to have had ſeveral
chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, or to meet with Young Ladies that look like old dowagers. At the
houſe of an acquaintance where I lately viſited, I was told that we were to
expect Mrs. <hi>Jackſon</hi> and the two Miſs <hi>Wrinkles.</hi> But what
was my ſurprize! when I ſaw on their arrival a blooming female of
twenty-five accoſted under the firſt denomination, and the two nymphs, as I
expected, come tottering into the room, the youngeſt of them to all
appearance on the verge of three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore. I could not help wiſhing on this
occaſion that ſome middle term was invented between <hi>Miſs</hi> and
<hi>Mrs.</hi> to be adopted, at a certain age, by all females not inclined to
matrimony. For ſurely nothing can be more ridiculous, than to hear a
greyhaired Lady paſt her Grand Climacteric mentioned in terms, that convey
the idea of youth and beauty, or perhaps of a bib and hanging-ſleeves. This
indiſcriminate appellation alſo unavoidably creates much 
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1252700301:269"/> confuſion: I know an eminent tradeſman who loſt a
very good cuſtomer for innocently writing <hi>Mrs.</hi> — at the head
of her bill: and I was lately at a ball, where, truſting to a friend for a
partner, I was obliged to do penance with an old withered beldam, who hobbled
through ſeveral country dances with me, though ſhe was ancient enough to
have been my grandmother. Excluding theſe Young Ladies of fifty and ſixty,
this order of females is very numerous; for there is ſcarce a girl in town or
country, ſuperior to a milk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid or cinderwench, but is comprehended in it.
The daughters are indiſputably Young Ladies, though their Papas may be
tradeſmen or mechanics. For the preſent race of ſhopkeepers &amp;c. have
wiſely provided, that their gentility ſhall be preſerved in the female
part of the family. Thus, although the ſon is called plain <hi>Jack,</hi> and
perhaps bound apprentice to his father, the daughter is taught to hold up her
head, make tea in the little parlour behind the ſhop, and inherits the title
of Lady from her Mama. To make theſe claims to dignity more ſure thoſe
excellent ſeminaries of genteel education, called Boarding-Schools, have been
contrived; where inſtead of teazing a ſampler, or conning a chapter of the
bible, the Young Ladies are inſtructed to hold up their heads, make a
curtſey, and to behave themſelves in every reſpect like pretty little
Ladies. Hence it happens, that we may often obſerve ſeveral of theſe
polite damſels in the ſkirts of <hi>White-Chapel,</hi> and in every petty
country town; nay, it is common to meet with Young Ladies <hi>born and
bred,</hi> who have ſubmitted to keep a chandler's ſhop, or had humility
enough even to go to ſervice.</p>
               <p>I PROCEED next to take into conſideration what is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
underſtood by Ladies of Quality. Theſe in other words may be more properly
called Ladies of Faſhion; for in the modiſh acceptation of the phraſe not
ſo much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <pb n="263" facs="tcp:1252700301:270"/> is had to their birth or ſtation, or
even to their co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronet, as to their way of life. The dutcheſs, who has not
taſte enough to act up to the character of a Perſon of Quality, is no more
reſpected in the polite world than a city knight's Lady; nor does ſhe
derive any greater honour from her title, than the hump-backed woman receives
from the vulgar. But what is immediately expected from a Lady of Quality, will
be ſeen under the next article: for to their praiſe be it ſpoken, moſt
of our modern Ladies of Quality affect to be Fine Ladies.</p>
               <p>TO deſcribe the life of a Fine Lady would be only to ſet
down a perpetual round of viſiting, gaming, dreſſing, and intriguing. She
has been bred up in the notion of making a figure, and of recommending
herſelf as a woman of ſpirit: for which end ſhe is always foremoſt in
the faſhion, and never fails gracing with her appearance every public
aſſembly, and every party of pleaſure. Though ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle, ſhe may coquet
with every fine gentleman; or if mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, ſhe may admit of gallantries
without reproach, and even receive viſits from the men in her bed-chamber. To
complete the character, and to make her a Very Fine Lady, ſhe ſhould be
celebrated for her wit and beauty, and be parted from her huſband: for as
matrimony itſelf is not meant as a reſtraint upon a pleaſure, a
ſeparate maintenance is underſtood as a licence to throw off even the
appearance of virtue.</p>
               <p>FROM the Fine Ladies it is a very natural tranſition to the
Ladies of Pleaſure; and indeed from what has already been ſaid concerning
Fine Ladies one might imagine that, as they make pleaſure their ſole
purſuit, they might pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be entitled Ladies of Pleaſure. But this gay
appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is reſerved for the higher rank of Proſtitutes, whoſe 
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1252700301:271"/> principal difference from the Fine Ladies conſiſts
in their profeſſing a trade, which the others carry on by ſmug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling. A
Lady of Faſhion, who refuſes no favours but the laſt, or even grants that
without being paid for it, is not to be accounted a Lady of Pleaſure, but
ranks in an order formerly celebrated under the title of DEMI-REPS. It is
whimſical enough to ſee the different complexions aſſumed by the ſame
vice, according to the difference of ſtations. The married Lady of Quality
may intrigue with as many as ſhe pleaſes, and ſtill remain <hi>Right
Honourable:</hi> The draggle-tailed Street-Walker is a <hi>Common Woman,</hi>
and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be ſent to <hi>Bridewell</hi>; but the Whore of High Life is a
<hi>Lady of Pleaſure,</hi> and rolls in a gilt chariot.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I firſt reſolved on appearing in my preſent
character, I had ſome thoughts of making my public entry in the front of one
or other of our News-papers; as I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered that the domeſtic
occurrences, which compoſe a part of their equipage, would make no bad figure
in my own retinue. Some reflections on the modiſh methods of gaming, would
receive an additional confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from a paragraph in the News, that 
<q rend="inline">"laſt Tueſday a game at Whiſt was played
at <hi>White</hi>'s for 1000<hi>l.</hi> a corner,"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"or that the match between his Grace the Duke of
— and Lord — was decided at <hi>Newmarket:</hi>"</q> and a
diſſerta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the luxury of the preſent age would be very aptly 
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1252700301:273"/> illuſtrated by an exact account of the weight of the
Turtle dreſſed a few days before for the gentlemen of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Chocolate-houſe.</p>
               <p>INDEED I have always looked upon the works of Mr.
<hi>Jenour</hi> in the <hi>Daily Advertiſer</hi> as a kind of ſupplement to
the intelligence of Mr. TOWN; as containing a more minute account of the
important tranſactions of that claſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, which has been
figuratively ſtiled <hi>The World.</hi> From theſe daily regiſters, you
may not only learn when any body is married or hanged, but you have immediate
notice, whenever his Grace goes to <hi>Newmarket,</hi> or her Ladyſhip ſets
out for <hi>Bath:</hi> and but laſt week, at the ſame time that the
gentlemen of the law were told that the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor could not ſit in the
Court of Chancery, people of faſhion had the melancholy news that Signor
<hi>Ricciarelli</hi> was not able to ſing.</p>
               <p>NOR is that part of Mr. <hi>Jenour</hi>'s lucubrations, which is
allotted to Advertiſements, leſs amuſing and entertaining: and many of
theſe articles might very properly come under my cognizance. It is here
debated, whether the prize of eloquence ſhould be given to Orator
<hi>Macklin</hi> or Orator <hi>Henley</hi>; and whether Mr. <hi>Stephen
Pitts</hi> is not the beſt qualified to furniſh gentlemen and ladies
libraries with tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſts in <hi>Octavo,</hi> and cloſe-ſtools in
<hi>Folio.</hi> And beſides the public notices to perſons of taſte, of
very rare and old Japan, and moſt curious and inimitable <hi>Epagnes</hi> for
deſerts, as alſo the moſt rich and elegant fancied ſilks to be ſold
by auction; many other advices not leſs intereſting to the Town, are here
given. We are daily put in mind, that Mrs. <hi>Phillips</hi> at the Green
Caniſter ſtill hopes for the favours of her former good cuſtomers as
uſual: that next door to <hi>Had<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docks</hi>'s <pb n="267" facs="tcp:1252700301:274"/> is
ſold an antidote againſt the poiſon imbibed at that bagnio: that Dr.
<hi>Rock</hi> infallibly cures a certain epidemical diſtemper by virtue of
the King's Patent: that a learned phyſician and ſurgeon will privately
accommodate any gentleman (as the Doctor modeſtly expreſſes it in his own
<hi>Latin) Pro Morbus Vaneria curandus:</hi> and that Y. Z. a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar-bred
ſurgeon and man-midwife, together with fifty others, will accommodate
gentlewomen, that are under a neceſſity of lying in privately.</p>
               <p>BUT not only the public tranſactions of Auctioneers, Brokers,
and Horſe-dealers, but the moſt private concerns of pleaſure and
gallantry may be alſo carried on by means of this paper. Aſſignations are
here made, and the moſt ſecret intrigues formed at the expence of two
ſhillings. If a genteel young body, who can do all kinds of work, wants a
place, ſhe will be ſure to hear of a maſter by advertiſing: Any
gentleman and lady of <hi>unexceptionable character</hi> may meet with lodgings
to be let, and no queſtions aſked: How often has <hi>Romeo</hi> declared in
print his unſpeakable paſſion for the charming <hi>Peachy!</hi> How many
gentlemen have made open profeſſions of the ſtricteſt honour and
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creſy! And how many ladies, dreſt in ſuch a manner, and ſeen at
ſuch a place, have been deſired to leave a line for <hi>A.B.</hi> Before
the late Marriage Act it was very uſual for young gentlemen and ladies
(poſſeſt of every qualification requiſite to make the marriage ſtate
happy) to offer themſelves as a good bargain to each other; and men took the
ſame mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of advertiſing to get an agreeable companion for life, as
they do for an agreeable companion in a poſt-chaiſe. As this traffick in
matrimony is now prohibited, it has given occaſion to the opening a new
branch of trade; and ſince huſbands and wives are hardly to be got for love
or money, ſeveral good-natured females have ſet themſelves up to ſale 
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1252700301:275"/> to the beſt bidder. The <hi>Daily Advertiſer</hi> is
therefore be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the univerſal regiſter for new faces; and every day's
advertiſements are crouded with offers of young ladies, who would be glad of
the company of any elderly gentleman, to paſs his leiſure hours with them,
and <hi>play at cards.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I LOOK upon the common intelligence in our public papers, with
the long train of advertiſements annexed to it, as the beſt account of the
preſent domeſtic ſtate of <hi>England,</hi> that can poſſibly be
compiled: nor do I know any thing which would give poſterity ſo clear an
idea of the taſte and morals of the preſent age, as a bundle of our daily
papers. They would here ſee what books are moſt read, what are our chief
amuſements and diverſions: and when they ſhould obſerve the daily
inquiries after eloped wives and apprentices, and the frequent accounts of
trials in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> for Perjury, Adultery, &amp;c. they
might form a tolerable notion even of our private life. Among many other
reaſons for lamenting that the Art of Printing was not more early
diſcovered, I cannot but regret that we have perhaps loſt many accounts of
this nature, which might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe have been handed down to us. With what
plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſhould we have peruſed an <hi>Athenian</hi> Advertiſer, or a
<hi>Roman</hi> Gazetteer! A curious critic or antiquarian would place them on
the ſame ſhelf with the Claſſics, and would be highly pleaſed at
diſcovering what days <hi>Tully</hi> went to his <hi>Tuſculum,</hi> or
<hi>Pliny</hi> to his magnificent <hi>Villa</hi>; who was the capital ſinger
at the <hi>Graecian</hi> Opera, and in what characters <hi>Roſcius</hi>
appeared with moſt ſucceſs. Theſe pieces of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence would
undoubtedly give great ſatisfaction; and I am myſelf acquainted with a very
learned gentleman, who has aſſured me, that he has been as much delighted
at diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering that the <hi>Soſii</hi> were <hi>Horace</hi>'s
bookſellers, that the <hi>Hecyra</hi> of <hi>Terence</hi> was damned, and
other little particulars <pb n="269" facs="tcp:1252700301:276"/> of that nature, as with an
account of the deſtruction of <hi>Carthage,</hi> or the death of
<hi>Caeſar.</hi> We ſhould alſo be glad to collect from their
advertiſements what things were moſt in requeſt at <hi>Athens</hi> and
<hi>Rome.</hi> Even our papers, (which perhaps are called <hi>Daily</hi> from
their laſting but a day) are, I fear, of too fugitive a nature to fall under
the inſpection of poſterity. To remedy, in ſome meaſure, this
inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience, I ſhall now conclude my paper with a few adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements,
which if they have not all actually been inſerted in our papers, are at
leaſt of the ſame nature with thoſe, that daily have a place there.</p>

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is whimſical to obſerve the miſtakes that we country
gentlemen are led into at our firſt coming to town. We are induced to think,
and indeed truly, that your fine ladies are compoſed of different materials
from our rural ones; ſince, though they ſleep all day and rake all night,
they ſtill remain as freſh and ruddy as a parſon's daughter or a farmer's
wife. At other times we are apt to wonder, that ſuch delicate creatures as
they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſhould yet be ſo much proof againſt cold, as to look as
roſy in <hi>January</hi> as in <hi>June,</hi> and even in the ſharpeſt
weather <pb n="272" facs="tcp:1252700301:279"/> to be very unwilling to approach the fire. I was
at a loſs to account for this unalterable hue of their complexions: but I
ſoon found that beauty was not more peculiar to the air of St.
<hi>James</hi>'s than of <hi>York</hi>; and that this perpetual bloom was not
native, but imported from abroad. Not content with that red and white which
nature gave, your belles are reduced (as they pretend) to the neceſſity of
ſupplying the fluſh of health with the <hi>rouge</hi> of vermilion, and
giving us <hi>Spaniſh</hi> wool for <hi>Engliſh</hi> beauty.</p>
                     <p>THE very reaſon alledged for this faſhionable practice is
ſuch, as (if they ſeriouſly conſidered it) the ladies would be
aſhamed to mention. 
<q rend="inline">"The late hours they are <hi>obliged</hi> to
keep, render them ſuch <hi>perfect frights,</hi> that they would be as loth
to appear abroad without paint as without cloaths."</q> This, it muſt be
acknowledged, is too true: But would they ſuffer their fathers or their
huſbands to wheel them down for one month to the old manſion-houſe, they
would ſoon be ſenſible of the change, and ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how much the
early walk exceeds the late aſſembly. The vigils of the card-table have
ſpoiled many a good face; and I have known a beauty ſtick to the midnight
rubbers, till ſhe has grown as homely as the Queen of Spades. There is
nothing more certain in all <hi>Hoyle</hi>'s caſes, than that Whiſt and
late hours will ruin the fineſt ſet of features: but if the ladies would
give up their routes for the healthy amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the country, I will
venture to ſay their carmine would be then as uſeleſs as their artificial
noſegays.</p>
                     <p>A MORALIST might talk to them of the heinouſneſs of this
practice; ſince all deceit is criminal, and painting is no better than
looking a lye. And ſhould they urge that nobody is deceived by it, he might
add, that the plea for admitting it is then at an end; ſince few are yet
arrived at <pb n="273" facs="tcp:1252700301:280"/> that height of <hi>French</hi> politeneſs,
as to dreſs their cheeks in public, and to profeſs wearing vermilion as
openly as powder. But I ſhall content myſelf with uſing an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more
likely to prevail: and ſuch I truſt will be the aſſurance, that this
practice is highly diſagreeable to the men. What muſt be the mortification,
and what the diſguſt of the lover, who goes to bed to a bride as blooming
as an angel, and finds her in the morning as wan and yellow as a corpſe? For
marriage ſoon takes off the maſk; and all the reſources of art, all the
my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of the toilet are then at an end. He that is thus wedded to a
cloud inſtead of a <hi>Juno,</hi> may well be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to complain, but
without relief: for this is a cuſtom, which once admitted ſo tarniſhes
the ſkin, that it is next to impoſſible ever to retrieve it. Let me
therefore caution thoſe young beginners, who are not yet diſcoloured paſt
redemption, to leave it off in time, and endeavour to procure and preſerve by
early hours that unaffected bloom, which art cannot give, and which only age or
ſickneſs can take away.</p>
                     <p>OUR beauties were formerly above making uſe of ſo poor an
artifice: They truſted to the lively colouring of nature, which was
heightened by temperance and exerciſe; but our modern belles are obliged to
retouch their cheeks every day, to keep them in repair. We were then as
ſuperior to the <hi>French</hi> in the aſſembly as in the field: but
ſince a trip to <hi>France</hi> has been thought a requiſite in the
education of our ladies as well as gentlemen, our polite females have thought
fit to dreſs their faces as well as their heads <hi>a là mode de
Paris.</hi> I am told, that when an <hi>Engliſh</hi> lady is at
<hi>Paris,</hi> ſhe is ſo ſurrounded with falſe faces, that ſhe is
herſelf obliged (if ſhe would not appear ſingular) to put on 
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:1252700301:281"/> the maſk. But who would exchange the brilliancy of the
diamond for the faint luſtre of <hi>French</hi> paſte? And for my part I
would as ſoon expect, that an <hi>Engliſh</hi> beauty at <hi>Morocco</hi>
would japan her face with lamb-black, in complaiſance to the ſable beauties
of that country. Let the <hi>French</hi> ladies white<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waſh and plaiſter
their fronts, and lay on their colours with a trowel: but theſe dawbings of
art are no more to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to the genuine glow of a <hi>Britiſh</hi>
cheek, than the coarſe ſtreaks of the painter's bruſh can reſemble the
native veins of the marble. This contraſt is placed in a proper light in Mr.
<hi>Addiſon</hi>'s fine epigram on Lady <hi>Mancheſter</hi>; which will
ſerve to convince us of the force of undiſſembled beauty. 
<q> 
                           <l>When haughty <hi>Gallia</hi>'s dames, that ſpread</l> 
                           <l>O'er their pale checks a lifeleſs red,</l> 
                           <l>Beheld this beauteous ſtranger there,</l> 
                           <l>In native charms divinely fair,</l> 
                           <l>Confuſion in their looks they ſhow'd,</l> 
                           <l>And with unborrow'd bluſhes glow'd.</l>
                        </q> I think, Mr.
TOWN, you might eaſily prevail on your fair readers to leave off this
unnatural practice, if you could once thoroughly convince them, that it impairs
their beauty inſtead of improving it. A lady's face, like the coats in the
<hi>Tale of a Tub,</hi> if left to itſelf, will wear well; but if you offer
to load it with foreign orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, you deſtroy the original ground.</p>
                     <p>AMONG other matter of wonder on my firſt coming to town, I
was much ſurpriſed at the general appearance of youth among the ladies. At
preſent there is no diſtinction in their complexions between a beauty in
her teens and a lady in her grand climacteric: yet at the ſame time I 
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1252700301:282"/> could not but take notice of the wonderful variety in
the face of the ſame lady. I have known an olive beauty on a Monday grow very
ruddy and blooming on Tueſday; turn pale on Wedneſday; come round to the
olive hue again on Thurſday; and in a word, change her complexion as often as
her gown. I was amazed to find no old aunts in this town, except a few
unfaſhionable people, whom no body knows; the reſt ſtill continuing in
the zenith of their youth and health, and falling off, like timely fruit,
without any previous decay. All this was a myſtery that I could not unriddle,
'till on being introduced to ſome ladies, I unluckily improved the hue of my
lips at the expence of a fair one, who unthinkingly had turned her cheek; and
found that my kiſſes were given, (as is obſerved in the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram) like
thoſe of <hi>Pyramus,</hi> through a wall. I then found, that this
ſurpriſing youth and beauty was all counterfeit; and that (as
<hi>Hamlet</hi> ſays) 
<q rend="inline">"God had given them one face, and they had
made themſelves another."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I HAVE mentioned the accident of my carrying off half a lady's
face by a ſalute, that your courtly dames may learn to put on their faces a
little tighter; but as for my own daughters, while ſuch faſhions prevail,
they ſhall ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi> There, I think, they are
pretty ſafe; for this unnatural faſhion will hardly make its way into the
country, as this vamped complexion would not ſtand againſt the rays of the
ſun, and would inevitably melt away in a country dance. The ladies have,
indeed, been always the greateſt enemies to their own beauty, and ſeem to
have a deſign againſt their own faces. At one time the whole countenance
was eclipſed in a black velvet maſk; at another it was blotted with
patches; and at preſent it is cruſted over with plaiſter of
<hi>Paris.</hi> In thoſe battered belles, who ſtill <pb n="276" facs="tcp:1252700301:283"/>
aim at conqueſt, this practice is in ſome ſort excuſable; but it is
ſurely as ridiculous in a young lady to give up beauty for paint, as it would
be to draw a good ſet of teeth merely to fill their places with a row of
ivory.</p>
                     <p>INDEED, ſo common is this faſhion among the young as well
as the old, that when I am in a groupe of beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, I conſider them as ſo
many pretty pictures; looking about me with as little emotion, as I do at
<hi>Hudſon</hi>'s: And if any thing fills me with admiration, it is the
judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious arrangement of the tints, and the delicate touches of the painter.
Art very often ſeems almoſt to vye with nature: but my attention is too
frequently diverted by conſidering the texture and hue of the ſkin beneath;
and the picture fails to charm, while my thoughts are engroſſed by the wood
and canvaſs.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T has hitherto been imagined, that though we have equalled, if
not ſurpaſſed, the ancients in other liberal arts, we have not yet been
able to arrive at that height of eloquence, which was poſſeſſed in ſo
amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a manner by the <hi>Grecian</hi> and <hi>Roman</hi> Orators. Whether
this has been owing to any peculiar organization of our tongues, or whether it
has proceeded from our national love of taciturnity, I ſhall not take upon me
to determine: but I will now venture to affirm, that the preſent times might
furniſh us with a more ſurpriſing number of Fine Speakers, than have been
ſet down by <hi>Tully</hi> in his treatiſe <hi>De Claris Oratoribus.</hi>
Foreigners can no longer object to us, that the northern coldneſs of our
climate has (as it were) <pb n="278" facs="tcp:1252700301:285"/> purſed up our lips, and that
we are afraid to open our mouths: The charm is at length diſſolved; and our
people, who before affected the gravity and ſilence of the <hi>Spaniard,</hi>
have adopted and naturalized the volubility of ſpeech, as well as the gay
manners, of the <hi>French.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS change has been brought about by the public-ſpirited
attempts of thoſe elevated geniuſſes, who have inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted certain
ſchools for the cultivation of eloquence in all its branches. Hence it is,
that inſtead of languid diſcourſes from the pulpit, ſeveral tabernacles
and meeting-houſes have been ſet up, where lay-preachers may diſplay all
the powers of oratory in ſighs and groans, and emulate a <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>
or a <hi>Weſley</hi> in all the figures of rhetoric.—And not only the
enthuſiaſt has his conventicles, but even the free-thinker boaſts his
Societies, where he may hold forth againſt reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in tropes, metaphors,
and ſimilies. The declamations weekly thundered out at <hi>Clare-Market,</hi>
and the ſubtle argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations at the <hi>Robin Hood,</hi> I have formerly
celebrated: It now remains to pay my reſpects to the <hi>Martin Luther</hi>
of the age, (as he frequently calls himſelf,) the great <hi>Orator</hi>
MACKLIN; who by declaiming himſelf, and opening a ſchool for the
diſputations of others, has joined both the above plans together, and formed
the BRITISH INQUISITION. Here, whatever concerns the world of taſte and
literature, is debated: Our rakes and bloods, who had been uſed to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<hi>Covent-Garden</hi> merely for the ſake of whoring and drinking, now
reſort thither for reaſon and argument; and the <hi>Piazza</hi> begins to
vie with the ancient <hi>Portico,</hi> where <hi>Socrates</hi> diſputed.</p>
               <p>BUT what pleaſes me moſt in Mr. MACKLIN's Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution is,
that he has allowed the tongues of my fair country-women their full play. Their
natural talents for <pb n="279" facs="tcp:1252700301:286"/> Oratory are ſo excellent and
numerous, that it ſeems more owing to the envy than prudence of the other
ſex, that they ſhould be denied the opportunity of exerting them. The
remarkable tendency in our politeſt ladies 
<q rend="inline">"to talk, though they have nothing to
ſay;"</q> and the torrent of eloquence that pours (on the moſt trivial
occaſions) from the lips of thoſe females, called Scolds; give abundant
proofs of that command of words, and flow of eloquence, which ſo few men have
been able to attain. Again, if action is the life and ſoul of an oration, how
many advantages have the ladies in this particular? The waving of a ſnowy
arm, art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſhaded with the enchanting ſlope of a double ruffle, would
have twenty times the force of the ſtiff ſee-ſaw of a male orator: and
when they come to the moſt ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated parts of the oration, which demand
uncommon warmth and agitation, we ſhould be vanquiſhed by the heaving
breaſt, and all thoſe other charms, which the modern dreſs is ſo well
calculated to diſplay.</p>
               <p>SINCE the ladies are thus undeniably endued with theſe and
many other accompliſhments for Oratory, that no place ſhould hitherto have
been opened for their exerting them, is almoſt unaccountable. The lower order
of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males have, indeed, long ago inſtituted an academy of this kind at the
other end of the town, where oyſters and eloquence are in equal perfection:
but the politer part of the female world have hitherto had no further
opportunity of exerciſing their abilities, than the common occaſions which
a new cap or petenlair, the tea or the card table, have afforded them. I am
therefore heartily glad, that a plan is at length put in execution, which will
encourage their propenſity to talking, and enlarge their topics of
converſation: but I would more particularly recommend <pb n="280" facs="tcp:1252700301:287"/>
it to all ladies of a clamorous diſpoſition, to attend at MACK<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIN's; that
the impetuous ſtream of eloquence, which, for want of another vent, has long
been poured on their ſervants or huſbands, may now be carried off by
another more agreeable channel.</p>
               <p>I COULD not have thought it poſſible, that this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
would have ſubſiſted two nights without ſetting all the female tongues
from <hi>St. James's</hi> to <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> in motion. But the ladies have
hitherto been dumb; and Female Eloquence ſeems as unlikely to diſplay
itſelf in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick as ever. Whether their modeſty will not permit them to
open their mouths in the unhallowed air of <hi>Covent-Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,</hi> I know not:
but I am rather inclined to think, that the Queſtions propoſed have not
been ſufficiently calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the female part of the aſſembly. They
might perhaps be tempted to debate, 
<q rend="inline">"whether <hi>Fanny Murray</hi> or Lady —
were the propereſt to lead the faſhion;"—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"to what lengths a lady might proceed without
the loſs of her reputation;"—</q>or 
<q rend="inline">"whether the Beautifying Lotion or the Royal
Waſhball were the moſt excellent Coſmetics."</q> It might alſo be
expected, in complaiſance to the fair ſex, that the INQUISITOR ſhould now
and then read a diſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation on Natural and Artificial Beauty; in which he
might (with that ſoftneſs and delicacy peculiar to himſelf) analyſe a
lady's face, and give examples of the ogle, the ſimper, the ſmile, the
languiſh, the dimple, &amp;c. with a word or two on the uſe and benefit of
paint.</p>
               <p>BUT theſe points I ſhall leave to Mr. MACKLIN's
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: In the mean time, as it is not in my power to oblige the
public with a Lady's Speech, I ſhall fill up the remainder of my paper with
an Oration, which my correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondent is deſirous ſhould appear in print,

                           <p>THE ancient drama had, we know, a religious as well as
political view; and was deſigned to inſpire the audience with a reverence
to the Gods and a love of their country. Our own Stage, upon particular
occaſions, has been made to anſwer the ſame ends: Thus we may remember
during the laſt rebellion, beſides the loyalty of the fiddles in the
Orcheſtra, we were inſpired with a deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the pope and pretender
by the <hi>Nonjuror,</hi> the <hi>Jeſuit Caught,</hi> and ſuch other
politico-religious dramas; among which I muſt not forget to
mention—(what's the name on't, Mr. INQUISITOR?—what's the name
on't?—oh)—<hi>Perkin Warbeck, Or the Popiſh Impoſtor.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>BUT there is a ſpecies of the drama, which has not yet
been mentioned by any of the gentlemen who have ſpoke to the queſtion, and
which is very deficient in point of moral: I mean, Pantomimes. Mr.
<hi>Laws</hi> has been very ſevere on the impiety of repreſenting heathen
gods and goddeſſes before a truly Chriſtian audience: and to this we may
add, that Harlequin is but a wicked ſort of fellow, and is always running
after the girls. For my part I have often bluſhed to ſee this impudent rake
endeavouring to creep under Columbine's petticoats, and at other times patting
her neck, and laying his legs upon her lap. Nobody will ſay indeed, that
there is much virtue or morality in theſe entertainments: though it muſt be
confeſſed to the honour of our neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing houſe here, that the
<hi>Necromancer</hi> and the <hi>Sorcerer,</hi> after having played many
unchriſtian pranks upon the ſtage, are at laſt fairly ſent to the
devil. I would therefore recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to our Pantomime-writers, that inſtead
of the <pb n="282" facs="tcp:1252700301:289"/> 
                              <hi>Pantheon,</hi> or lewd comedies, they would
take their ſubjects from ſome Old Garland, Moral Ballad, or Penny Hiſtory
Book. Suppoſe, for example, they were to give us the ſtory of <hi>Patient
Grizzle</hi> in dumb ſhew; ſetting forth, as how a noble lord fell in love
with her, as he was hunting;—and there you might have the ſcene of the
Spinning Wheel, and the ſong of the <hi>Early Horn</hi>;—and as how,
after many tryals of her patience, which they might repreſent by machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery,
this lord at laſt married her;—and then you may have a Grand Temple and
a Dance. The other houſe have already revived the good old ſtory of
<hi>Fortunatus</hi>'s Wiſhing-cap; and as they are fond of introducing little
children in their entertainments, ſuppoſe they were to exhibit a Panto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mime
of the <hi>Three Children in the Wood:</hi>—'twould be vaſtly pretty to
ſee the paſte-board robin-red-breaſts let down by wires upon the ſtage,
to cover the poor innocent babes with paper leaves. But if they muſt have
<hi>Fairies,</hi> and <hi>Genii,</hi> I would adviſe them to take their
ſtories out of that pretty little book, called the <hi>Fairy Tales.</hi> I am
ſure, inſtead of oſtriches, dogs, horſes, lions, monkeys, &amp;c. we
ſhould be full as well pleaſed to ſee the <hi>Wolf and little red
Riding-Hood</hi>; and we ſhould laugh vaſtly at the adventures of
<hi>Puſs in Boots.</hi> I need not point out the excellent moral, which would
be inculcated by repreſentations of this kind; and I am confident they would
meet with the deſerved applauſe of all the old women and children in both
galleries.</p>

benefactors; while ſome of a more elevated genius among them cloath their
thoughts in a kind of holiday dreſs, and once in the year riſe into poets.
Thus the bellman bids good night to all his maſters and miſtreſſes in
couplets; the news-carrier hawks his own verſes; and the very lamp-lighter
addreſſes his worthy cuſtomers in rhyme. As a ſervant to the public, I
ſhould be wanting in the due reſpect to my readers, if I alſo did not
take this earlieſt opportunity of paying them the compliments of the
ſeaſon, and (in the phraſe of their barbers, taylors, ſhoemakers, and
other tradeſmen) wiſh them a merry <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> and a happy New
Year.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:1252700301:291"/>THOSE old-faſhioned mortals who have
been accuſtomed to look upon this ſeaſon with extraordinary devotion, I
leave to con over the explanation of it in <hi>Nelſon:</hi> It ſhall at
preſent be my buſineſs to ſhew the different methods of celebrating it
in theſe kingdoms. With the generality, <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> is looked upon
as a feſtival in the moſt literal ſenſe, and held ſacred by good
eating and drinking. Theſe, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, are the moſt diſtinguiſhing marks
of <hi>Chriſtmas:</hi> The revenue from the malt-tax and the duty upon wines,
&amp;c. on account of theſe twelve days, has always been found to encreaſe
conſiderably: And it is impoſſible to conceive the ſlaughter that is
made among the poultry and the hogs in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parts of the country, to
furniſh the prodigious numbers of turkeys and chines, and collars of brawn,
that travel up, as preſents, to the metropolis on this occaſion. The jolly
cit looks upon this joyous time of feaſting, with as much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as on
the treat of a new-elected alderman, or a lord-mayor's day. Nor can the country
farmer rail more againſt the Game-Act, than many worthy citizens, who have
ever ſince been debarred of their annual hare; while their ladies can never
enough regret their loſs of the opportunity of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing their ſkill,
in making a moſt excellent pudding in the belly. But theſe notable
houſe-wives have ſtill the conſolation of hearing their gueſts commend
the mince-pies without meat, which we are aſſured were made at home, and
not like the ordinary heavy things from the paſtry-cooks. Theſe good people
would look upon the abſence of mince-pies as the higheſt violation of
<hi>Chriſtmas</hi>; and have remarked with concern the diſregard that has
been ſhewn of late years to that Old <hi>Engliſh</hi> repaſt: For this
excellent <hi>Britiſh Ollio</hi> is as eſſential to <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi>
as pancake to Shrove Tueſday, tanſy to Eaſter, furmity to Midlent-Sunday,
or gooſe to Michaelmas Day. And they think it no wonder, 
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1252700301:292"/> that our finical gentry ſhould be ſo looſe in
their principles, as well as weak in their bodies, when the ſolid,
ſubſtantial, Proteſtant mince-pie has given place among them to the Roman
Catholic <hi>Aumlets,</hi> and the light, puffy, heterodox <hi>Pets de
Religieuſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AS this ſeaſon uſed formerly to be welcomed in with more
than uſual jollity in the country, it is probable that the
<hi>Chriſtmas</hi> remembrances, with which the waggons and ſtage-coaches
are at this time loaded, firſt took their riſe from the laudable cuſtom
of diſtributing proviſions at this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere quarter of the year to the
poor. But theſe preſents are now ſeldom ſent to thoſe who are really
in want of them, but are deſigned as compliments to the great from their
inferiors, and come chiefly from the tenant to his rich land-lord, or from the
rector of a fat living, as a kind of tythe, to his patron. Nor is the old
hoſpitable <hi>Engliſh</hi> cuſtom, of keeping open houſe for the poor
neighbourhood, any longer regarded. We might as ſoon expect to ſee
plumb-porridge fill a terrene at the ordinary at <hi>White</hi>'s, as that the
lord of the manour ſhould aſſemble his poor tenants to make merry at the
great houſe. The ſervants ſwill the <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> ale by
themſelves in the hall, while the ſquire gets drunk with his brother
foxhunters in the ſmoking-room.</p>
               <p>THERE is no rank of people ſo heartily rejoiced at the arrival
of this joyful ſeaſon, as the order of ſervants, journey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and
apprentices, and the lower ſort of people in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral. No maſter or
miſtreſs is ſo rigid, as to refuſe them an holiday; and by remarkable
good luck the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which gives them an opportunity of
diverting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, procures then money to ſupport it, by the tax which
cuſtom has impoſed upon us in the article of <hi>Chriſtmas-Boxes.</hi> 
                  <pb n="286" facs="tcp:1252700301:293"/> The butcher and the baker ſend their journey-men and
apprentices to levy contributions on their cuſtomers, which are paid back
again in the uſual fees to Mr. <hi>John</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Mary.</hi> This
ſerves the tradeſman as a pretence to lengthen out his bill, and the
maſter and miſtreſs to lower the wages on account of the vails. The
<hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Box was formerly the bounty of well-diſpoſed people,
who were willing to contribute ſomething towards rewarding the
induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious, and ſupplying them with neceſſaries. But the gift is now
almoſt demanded as a right; and our journeymen, apprentices &amp;c. are grown
ſo polite, that inſtead of reſerving their <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Box for
its original uſe, their ready caſh ſerves them only for preſent
pocket-money; and inſtead of viſiting their friends and relations, they
commence the fine gentlemen of the week. The ſixpenny hop is crouded with
ladies and gentlemen from the kitchen; the Syrens of <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine Street</hi>
charm many an holiday gallant into their ſnares; and the play-houſes are
filled with beaux, wits and critics, from <hi>Cheapſide</hi> and
<hi>White-Chapel.</hi> The barrows are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with raw lads ſetting
their halfpence againſt oranges; and the greaſy cards and dirty
cribbage-board employ the genteeler gameſters in every ale-houſe. A merry
<hi>Chriſtmas</hi> has ruined many a promiſing young fellow, who has been
fluſh of money at the beginning of the week, but before the end of it has
committed a robbery on the till for more.</p>
               <p>BUT in the midſt of this general feſtivity there are ſome
ſo far from giving into any extraordinary merriment, that they ſeem more
gloomy than uſual, and appear with faces as diſmal as the month in which
<hi>Chriſtmas</hi> is celebrated. I have heard a plodding citizen moſt
grievouſly complain of the great expence of houſe-keeping at this
ſeaſon, when his own and his wife's relations claim the privilege of
kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred <pb n="287" facs="tcp:1252700301:294"/> to eat him out of houſe and home: Then again,
conſidering the preſent total decay of trade, and the great load of taxes,
it is a ſhame that poor ſhopkeepers ſhould be ſo fleeced and plundered,
under the pretence of <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Boxes. But if tradeſmen have any
reaſon to murmur at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> many of their cuſtomers, on the
other hand, tremble at its approach; as it is made a ſanction to every petty
mechanic, to break in upon their joy, and diſturb a gentleman's repoſe at
this time, by bringing in his bill.</p>
               <p>OTHERS, who uſed to be very merry at this ſeaſon, have
within this year or two been quite diſconcerted. To put them out of their old
way, is to put them out of humour: they have therefore quarrelled with the
almanack, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to keep their <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> according to Act of
Parliament. My Couſin VILLAGE informs me, that this obſtinacy is very
common in the country; and that many ſtill perſiſt in waiting eleven days
for their mirth, and defer their <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> till the blowing of the
<hi>Glaſtonbury Thorn.</hi> In ſome, indeed, this cavilling with the
calendar has been only the reſult of cloſe oeconomy; who by evading the
expence of keeping <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> with the reſt of the world, find
means to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect it, when the general time of celebrating it is over. Many
have availed themſelves of this expedient: and I am acquainted with a couple,
who are enraged at the New Style on another account; becauſe it puts them to
double expences, by robbing them of the opportunity of keeping
<hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Day and their Wedding Day at the ſame time.</p>
               <p>AS to perſons of faſhion, this annual Carnival is worſe to
them than Lent, or the empty town in the middle of ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. The boiſterous
merriment, and aukward affectation of politeneſs among the vulgar, interrupts
the courſe of their refined pleaſures, and drives them out of town for the
Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days. <pb n="288" facs="tcp:1252700301:295"/> The few who remain are very much at a loſs
how to diſpoſe of their time; for the theatres at this ſeaſon are
opened only for the reception of ſchool-boys and appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices, and there is
no public place where a perſon of faſhion can appear, without being
ſurrounded with the dirty inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>St. Giles</hi>'s, and the
brutes from the <hi>Wapping</hi> ſide of <hi>Weſtminſter.</hi> Theſe
unhappy ſufferers are really to be pitied; and ſince <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>
day has to perſons of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a great deal of inſipidity about it, I
cannot enough ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud an ingenious lady, who ſent cards round to all her
acquaintance, inviting them to a route; which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared was the happieſt
thought in the world, becauſe <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Day is ſo like
Sunday.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">C</seg>ONTESTED Elections and Double Returns being at preſent the
general topic of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, a ſubject in which the ladies me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks are
but little concerned, I have a Scheme to propoſe to you in their behalf,
which I doubt not but you, as their profeſſed patron, will uſe your
eloquence to recommend, and your authority to enforce. It has long been a
matter of real concern to <pb n="290" facs="tcp:1252700301:297"/> every well-wiſher to the
fair ſex, that the men ſhould be allowed the free choice of
repreſentatives, to whom they can make every real or pretended grievance
known, while the women are deprived of the ſame privilege; when in reality
they have many grievances utterly unknown and unthought of by the men, and
which cannot be redreſſed but by a FEMALE PARLIAMENT.</p>
                     <p>I DO not, indeed, pretend to the honour of firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting
this Scheme, ſince an Aſſembly of this nature has been propoſed before:
but as it appears to me ſo neceſſary, I would adviſe that writs be
immediately iſſued out for calling a Parliament of Women, which for the
future ſhould aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble every winter, and be diſſolved every
<hi>third</hi> year. My rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for ſhortening the time of their ſitting
proceeds from the reflection, that full as much buſineſs will be done, at
leaſt as many ſpeeches will be made, by women in three years, as by men in
ſeven. To this Aſſembly every county and city in <hi>England</hi> ſhall
ſend two members; but from this privilege I would utterly exclude every
borough, as we ſhall preſently ſee that they can have no buſineſs to
tranſact there. But as I would have their number at leaſt equal to that of
the other Parliament, the deficiency ſhould be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied by the ſquares
and great ſtreets at the court end of the town, each of which ſhould be
repreſented by one of their own inhabitants. In humble imitation of the
Houſes of Lords and Commons, the ladies of peers (whether ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or
temporal) ſhould ſit here in their own right, the others by election only;
any woman to be qualified, whoſe huſband, or even whoſe father (for I
would by no means exclude the unmarried ladies) are qualified to be choſen
into the other. In the ſame manner, whatever entitles the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or
father to vote at that election, ſhould entitle his wife or daughter to vote
at this.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="291" facs="tcp:1252700301:298"/>HAVING ſettled this point, it now
remains to adjuſt the ſubjects which they are to treat of; and theſe we
ſhall find to be indeed of the laſt importance. What think you, Sir, of the
riſe and fall of faſhions, of as much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to them as the riſe
and fall of kingdoms is to us? of the commencing a new acquaintance, equivalent
to our making a new alliance? and the ceremonial of a route or a ball, as
intereſting as the preliminaries of a treaty or a congreſs? Theſe
ſubjects, and theſe alone, will ſufficiently employ them every
ſeſſions; and as their judgment muſt be final, how delightful will it
be to have bills brought in to determine how many inches of the leg or neck may
law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be expos'd, how many curteſies at a public place amount to an
acquaintance, and what are the preciſe privileges of birth or fortune, that
entitle the poſſeſſors to give routs or drums, on week-days or on
ſundays. Whoever ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to tranſgreſs againſt theſe
laws, might be puniſhed ſuitably to their offences: and be baniſhed from
public places, or be condemned to do penance in linſey-woolſey: or if any
female ſhould be convicted of immodeſty, ſhe might be outlawed, and then
(as theſe laws would not bind the nymphs of <hi>Drury)</hi> we ſhould
eaſily diſtinguiſh a <hi>modeſt woman</hi> as the phraſe is, if not
by her looks, at leaſt by her dreſs and appearance, and the victorious
<hi>Fanny</hi> might then be ſuffer'd to ſtrike bold ſtrokes without
rivalry or imitation. If any man too ſhould be found ſo groſly of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending
againſt the laws of faſhion as to refuſe a member a bow at a play or a
ſalute at a wedding, how ſuitably would he be puniſhed by being
reprimanded on his knees in ſuch an aſſembly, and by ſo fine a woman as
we may ſuppoſe the ſpeaker would be? Then doubtleſs would a grand
committee ſit on the affair of hoops; and were they eſtabliſhed in their
preſent form by proper authority, doors <pb n="292" facs="tcp:1252700301:299"/> and boxes
might be alter'd and enlarg'd accordingly. Then ſhould we talk as familiarly
of the viſit bill as of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage bill, and with what pleaſure ſhould
we peruſe the regulations of the committee of dreſs? Every lover of
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum would be pleaſed to hear that refractory females were taken into
cuſtody by the uſher of the black fan: The double return of a viſit would
occaſion as many debates as the dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble return for a certain county, and at
the eve of an election how pretty would it be to ſee the ladies of the
ſhire going about mounted on their white palfreys and canvaſſing for
votes.</p>
                     <p>TILL this great purpoſe is attain'd, I ſee not how the
viſible enormities in point of dreſs, and failures in point of ceremony can
effectually be prevented. But then, and not before, I ſhall hope to ſee
politeneſs and good breeding di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from formality and
affectation, and dreſſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented that will improve, not diminiſh the
charms of the fair, and rather become than diſguiſe the wearers.</p>

               <p>I AM much obliged to my correſpondent for his letter, and
heartily wiſh that this Scheme was carried into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The liberties
daily taken in point of dreſs demand proper reſtrictions. The ancients
ſettled the national habit by law: but the dreſs of our own country is ſo
very fluctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, that if the great grandmothers of the preſent generation
were to ariſe, they would not be able to gueſs at their poſterity from
their dreſs, but would fancy themſelves in a ſtrange country. As theſe
affairs fall more immediately under the cognizance of the ladies, the female
world in general would ſoon be ſenſible of the advantages accruing from a
female parliament: and tho' ladies of faſhion might <pb n="293" facs="tcp:1252700301:300"/>
probably claim ſome peculiar liberties in dreſs by their privilege, it
might naturally be expected that this wiſe aſſembly would at leaſt keep
the reſt of the ſex in order; nor ſuffer enormous hoops to ſpread
themſelves acroſs the whole pavement, to the detriment of all honeſt men
going upon buſineſs along the ſtreet; nor permit the chandler's wife to
retail half-quarterns from behind the counter, in a ſhort ſtomacher and
without an hankerchief.</p>
               <p>I AM aware that a conſiderable objection may be brought
againſt this Scheme: to wit, that a Female Parliament (like thoſe of the
men) may be ſubject to corruption, and be made dependant on a court. The
enormous <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> Ruff, and the aukward Queen of <hi>Scots</hi> Mob,
are fatal inſtances of the evil influence which courts have upon faſhions:
and as no one can tell the power which a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Queen might have
over the councils of a Female Parliament, future ages might perhaps ſee the
ſtays bolſtered out into hump-backs, or the petticoats let down to conceal
a bandy leg, from the ſame ſervile complaiſance which warped the necks of
<hi>Alexander</hi>'s courtiers.</p>
               <p>BUT though a Parliament on the foregoing ſcheme has not yet
taken place, an inſtitution of the like nature has been contrived among the
order of females, who (as I mentioned in a former paper) advertiſe for
gentlemen to <hi>play at cards</hi> with them. The reader may remember, that
ſome time ago an advertiſement appeared in the public papers, from the
<hi>Covent-Garden</hi> Society; in which it was ſet forth, that one of their
members was voted <hi>common.</hi> This very ſociety is compoſed of theſe
Agreeable Young Ladies, whole buſineſs it is to <hi>play at cards</hi> with
thoſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, who have good-nature and fortune ſufficient to ſit down
contented with being loſers. It is divided, like the <pb n="294" facs="tcp:1252700301:301"/>
upper and lower Houſes of Parliament, into <hi>Ladies</hi> and
<hi>Commons.</hi> The upper order of <hi>Card-players</hi> take their ſeats
according to the rank of thoſe who game at high ſtakes with them; while the
<hi>Commons</hi> are made up of the lower ſort of gamblers within the
hundreds of <hi>Drury</hi> and <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi> Every one is obliged to
pay a certain tax out of her <hi>Card-money</hi>; and the revenue ariſing
from it is applied to the levying of hoop-petticoats, ſacks, petenlairs,
caps, handkerchiefs, aprons, &amp;c. to be iſſued out nightly according to
the exigence and degree of the members. Many revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions have happened in this
ſociety ſince its inſtitution: A <hi>Commoner</hi> in the ſpace of a
few weeks has been called up to the Houſe of Ladies; and another, who at
firſt ſat as Peereſs, has been ſuddenly degraded, and voted
<hi>common.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>MORE particulars of this Society have not come to my knowledge:
but their deſign ſeems to be, to erect a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Wealth of themſelves,
and to reſcue their liberties from being invaded by thoſe who have
preſumed to tyrannize over them. If this practice of playing their own cards,
and ſhuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for themſelves, ſhould generally prevail among all the
Agreeable Young Gameſters of <hi>Covent-Garden,</hi> I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to think
what will become of the venerable ſiſterhood of <hi>Douglaſs,
Haddocks,</hi> and <hi>Noble,</hi> as well as the fraternity of <hi>Harris,
Derry,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe gentlemen, who have hitherto acted as
Groom-Porters, and had the principal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the game. From ſuch a
combination it may greatly be feared, that the honourable profeſſion of
Pimp will in a ſhort time become as uſeleſs as that of a
Fleet-Parſon.</p>

principles and practice to the <hi>Mohocks</hi> and <hi>Hell Fire Club</hi> of
tremendous memory. This Society was compoſed of a few broken gameſters and
deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate young rakes, who threw the ſmall remains of their bankrupt

who boldly ſtake their whole fortunes at the gaming-table, in the ſame view
with theſe deſperadoes; and they may even go ſo far as to regard the
polite and honourable aſſembly at <hi>White</hi>'s as a kind of Laſt
Guinea Club. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they will ſay, is ſo fluctuating as the property of
a gameſter, who (when luck runs againſt him) throws away whole acres at
every caſt of the dice, and whoſe houſes are as unſure a
poſſeſſion, as if they were built with cards. Many, indeed, have been
reduced to their laſt guinea at this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teel gaming-houſe: but the moſt
inveterate enemies to <hi>White</hi>'s muſt allow, that it is but now and
then, that a gameſter of quality, who looks upon it as a toſs-up whether
there is another world, takes his chance, and diſpatches him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when the
odds are againſt him in this.</p>
               <p>BUT however free the gentlemen of <hi>White</hi>'s may be from
any imputation of this kind, it muſt be confeſſed that Suicide begins to
prevail ſo generally, that it is the moſt gallant exploit, by which our
modern heroes chuſe to ſignalize themſelves; and in this, indeed, they
behave with uncommon proweſs. From the days of <hi>Plato</hi> down to 
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:1252700301:304"/> theſe a Suicide has always been compared to a
ſoldier on guard deſerting his poſt; but I ſhould rather conſider a
ſet of theſe deſperate men, who ruſh on certain death, as a body of
troops ſent out on the Forlorn Hope. They meet every face of death, however
horrible, with the utmoſt reſolution: ſome blow their brains out with a
piſtol; ſome expire like <hi>Socrates,</hi> by poiſons; ſome fall, like
<hi>Cato,</hi> on the point of their own ſwords; and others, who have lived
like <hi>Nero,</hi> affect to die like <hi>Seneca,</hi> and bleed to death. The
moſt exalted geniuſſes I ever remember to have heard of, were a party of
reduced gameſters, who bravely reſolved to pledge each other in a bowl of
laudanum. I was alſo lately informed of a gentleman, who went among his
uſual companions at the gaming-table the day before he made away with
himſelf, and coolly queſtioned them, which they thought the eaſieſt and
genteeleſt method of going out of the world: for there is as much difference
between a mean perſon and a man of quality in their manner of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying
themſelves, as in their manner of living. The poor ſneaking wretch,
ſtarving in a garret, tucks himſelf up in his liſt garters; a ſecond,
croſt in love, drowns himſelf, like a blind puppy, in <hi>Roſamond's
Pond;</hi> and a third cuts his throat with his own razor. But the man of
faſhion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt always dies by a piſtol; and even the cobler of any
ſpirit goes off by a doſe or two extraordinary of gin.</p>
               <p>BUT this falſe ſpirit of courage, however noble it may
appear to the deſperate and abandoned, in reality amounts to no more than the
reſolution of the highwayman, who ſhoots himſelf with his own piſtol,
when he finds it impoſſible to avoid being taken. All poſſible means
therefore ſhould be deviſed to extirpate ſuch abſurd bravery, and to
make it appear every way horrible, odious, contemptible, and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous. From
reading the public prints a foreigner might be naturally led to imagine, that
we are the moſt lunatic <pb n="298" facs="tcp:1252700301:305"/> people in the whole world.
Almoſt every day informs us, that the coroner's inqueſt has ſat on the
body of ſome miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Suicide, and brought in their verdict
<hi>Lunacy</hi>; but it is very well known that the inquiry has not been made
into the ſtate of mind of the deceaſed, but into his fortune and family.
The law has indeed provided, that the deliberate Self-Murderer ſhould be
treated like a brute, and denied the rites of burial: but among hundreds of
<hi>lunatics by purchaſe,</hi> I never knew this ſentence executed but on
one poor cobler who hanged himſelf in his own ſtall. A pennyleſs poor dog
who has not left enough to defray the funeral charges, may perhaps be excluded
the church-yard; but Self-murder by a piſtol genteely mounted, or the
<hi>Paris</hi>-hilted ſword qualifies the polite owner for a <hi>ſudden
death,</hi> and entitles him to a pom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pous burial, and a monument ſetting
forth his virtues in <hi>Weſtminſter Abbey.</hi> Every man in his ſober
ſenſes muſt wiſh that the moſt ſevere laws that could poſſibly
be contrived were enacted againſt Suicides. This ſhocking bravado never did
(and I am confident never will) prevail among the more deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and tender
ſex in our own nation: tho' hiſtory informs us that the <hi>Roman</hi>
Ladies were once ſo infatuated as to throw off the ſoftneſs of their
nature, and commit violence on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 'till the madneſs was curbed by
expoſing their naked bodies in the public ſtreets. This, I think, would
afford a hint for fixing the like marks of ignominy on our Male-Suicides, and I
would have every lower wretch of this ſort dragged at the cart's tail, and
afterwards be hung in chains at his own door, or have his quarters put up
<hi>in terrorem</hi> in the moſt public places as a rebel to his Maker. But
that the Suicide of quality might be treated with more reſpect, he ſhould
be indulged in having his wounded corpſe and ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered brains lay (as it
were) in ſtate for ſome days, of which dreadful ſpectacle we may conceive
the horror from the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing picture drawn by <hi>Dryden.</hi> 
                  <q> 
                     <l>The SLAYER OF HIMSELF too ſaw I there:</l> 
                     <l>The gore congealed was clotted in his hair:</l> 
                     <l>With eyes half-cloſed, and mouth wide ope he lay,</l> 
                     <l>And grim as when he breathed his ſullen ſoul away.</l> 
                     <bibl>DRYDEN's FABLES.</bibl>

               <p>
                  <pb n="299" facs="tcp:1252700301:306"/>THE common murderer has his ſkeleton
preſerved at <hi>Surgeon's Hall</hi> in order to deter others from being
guilty of his crimes; and I think it would not be improper to have a
charnel-houſe ſet apart to receive the bones of theſe more unnatural
Self-Murderers, in which monuments ſhould be erected giving an account of
their deaths, and adorned with the glorious enſigns of their raſhneſs,
the rope, the knife, the ſword, or the piſtol.</p>
               <p>THE cauſe of theſe frequent ſelf-murders among us has been
generally imputed to the peculiar temperature of our climate. Thus a dull day
is looked upon as a natural order of execution, and <hi>Engliſhmen</hi>
muſt neceſſarily ſhoot, hang, and drown themſelves in
<hi>November.</hi> That our ſpirits are in ſome meaſure influenced by the
air cannot be denied, but we are not ſuch meer Barometers as to be driven to
deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair and death by the ſmall degree of gloom that our winter brings with
it. If we have not ſo much ſunſhine as ſome countries in the world, we
have infinitely more than many others, and I do not hear that men diſpatch
themſelves by dozens in <hi>Ruſſia</hi> or <hi>Sweden,</hi> or that they
are unable to keep up their ſpirits even in the total darkneſs of
<hi>Greenland.</hi> Our climate exempts us from many diſeaſes to which
other more ſouthern nations are naturally ſubject, and I can never be
perſuaded that being born near the North-pole is a phyſical cauſe for
Self-Murder.</p>
               <p>DESPAIR indeed is the natural cauſe of theſe ſhocking
actions; but this is commonly deſpair brought on by wilful extravagance and
debauchery. Theſe firſt involve men in difficulties, and then death at once
delivers them of their lives and their cares. For my part, when I ſee a young
profligate wantonly ſquandering his fortune in bagnios or at the
gaming-table, I cannot help looking on him as haſtening his own death, and in
a manner digging his own grave. As he is at laſt induced to kill himſelf by
motives ariſing from his vices, I conſider him as dying of ſome
diſeaſe, which thoſe vices naturally produce. If his extravagance has
been chiefly in luxurious eating and drinking, I imagine him poiſoned by his
wines, or ſurfeited by a favourite diſh; and if he has thrown away his
eſtate in bawdy-houſes, I conclude him deſtroyed by rottenneſs and
filthy diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:1252700301:307"/>ANOTHER principal cauſe of the frequency
of Suicide is the noble ſpirit of Freethinking which has diffuſed itſelf
among all ranks of people. The libertine of faſhion has too refined a taſte
to trouble himſelf at all about a ſoul or an hereafter: but the vulgar
infidel is at wonderful pains to get rid of his bible, and labours to
perſuade himſelf out of his religion. For this purpoſe he attends
conſtantly at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putant ſocieties, where he hears a great deal about
free will, free agency, and predeſtination, 'till at length he is convinced
that man is at liberty to do as he pleaſes, lays his misfortunes to the
charge of providence, and comforts himſelf that he was inevitably deſtined
to be tyed up in his own garters. The courage of theſe heroes proceeds from
the ſame principles whether they fall by their own hands, or thoſe of
<hi>Jack Ketch:</hi> The Suicide of whatever rank looks death in the face
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhrinking; as the gallant rogue affects an eaſy unconcern under
<hi>Tyburn,</hi> throws away the pſalm-book, bids the cart drive off with an
oath, and ſwings like a gentleman.</p>
               <p>IF this madneſs ſhould continue to grow more and more
epidemical, it will be expedient to have a Bill of Suicide, diſtinct from the
common bill of mortality, brought in yearly, in which ſhould be ſet down
the number of Suicides, their methods of deſtroying themſelves, and the
likely cauſes of their doing ſo. In this, I believe, we ſhould find but
few martyrs to the weather, but their deaths would commonly be imputed to
deſpair, produced by ſome cauſes ſimilar to the following. In the
little ſketch of a Bill of Suicide under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, I have left blanks for the
date of the year, as well as for the number of Self-Murderers, their manner of
dying, &amp;c. which would naturally be filled up by the proper perſons if
ever this ſcheme ſhould be put in execution.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>INCE pleaſure is almoſt the only purſuit of a fine
gentleman, it is very neceſſary, for the maintaining his conſequence and
cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that he ſhould have a girl in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Intriguing with women of
faſhion, and debauching tradeſmen's daughters, naturally happen in the
common courſe of gallantry; but this convenient fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, to fill up the
intervals of buſineſs, is the principal mark of his ſuperior taſte and
quality. Every priggiſh clerk to an attorney, or pert apprentice can throw
away his occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional guinea in <hi>Covent-Garden</hi>; but the ſhortneſs
of their <pb n="302" facs="tcp:1252700301:309"/> finances will not permit them to perſevere in
debauchery with the air and ſpirit of a man of quality. The Kept
Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs (which thoſe half-reprobates dare not think of) is a conſtant
part of the retinue of a complete fine gentleman, and is, indeed, as
indiſpenſible a part of his equipage, as a <hi>French valet de chambre</hi>
or a four-wheeled poſt-chaiſe.</p>
               <p>IT was formerly the faſhion among the ladies to keep a monkey:
At that time every woman of quality thought herſelf obliged to follow the
mode; and even the merchants wives in the city had their faſhionable pugs to
play tricks and break china. A Girl in Keeping is as diſagreeable to ſome
of our men of pleaſure, as pug was to ſome ladies; but they muſt have one
to ſpend money and do miſchief, that they may be reckoned young fellows of
ſpirit. Hence it happens, that many gentlemen maintain girls, who in fact are
little more than their nominal miſtreſſes; for they ſee them as
ſeldom, and behave to them with as much indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as if they were their
wives: however, as the woman in a manner bears their name, and is maintained by
them, they may appear in the world with the genteel character of a Keeper. I
have known ſeveral gentlemen take great pains to heighten their reputation in
this way; and turn off a firſt miſtreſs, merely becauſe ſhe was not
ſufficiently known, for the ſake of a celebrated woman of the town, a
dancer, or an actreſs: and it is always the firſt ſtep of an
<hi>Engliſhman</hi> of faſhion after his arrival at <hi>Paris,</hi> to take
one of the <hi>Filles d' Opera</hi> under his protection. It was but the other
day, that <hi>Florio</hi> went abroad, and left his girl to roll about the town
in a chariot, with an unlimited order on his banker; and almoſt as ſoon as
he got to <hi>France,</hi> took a ſmart girl off the ſtage, to make as
genteel a figure at <hi>Paris.</hi> In ſhort, as a gentleman keeps running
horſes, goes to <hi>White</hi>'s, and gets into parliament, for the name of
the <pb n="303" facs="tcp:1252700301:310"/> thing; ſo muſt he likewiſe have his Kept
Miſtreſs, becauſe it is the faſhion: and I was mightily pleaſed with
hearing a gentleman once boaſt, that he lived like a man of
quality—For, ſays he, I have a poſt-chaiſe and never ride in it, I
have a wife and never ſee her, and I keep a miſtreſs and never lie with
her.</p>
               <p>BUT if theſe ſort of Keepers, who never care a farthing for
their miſtreſſes, are to be laughed at, thoſe who are really fond of
their <hi>Dulcineas</hi> are to be pitied. The moſt hen-pecked huſband,
that ever bore the grievous yoke of a ſhrew, is not half ſo miſerable, as
a man who is ſubject to the humours and unaccountable caprice of a cunning
ſlut, who finds him in her power. Her behaviour will continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally give him
new occaſion of jealouſy; and perhaps ſhe will really diſpenſe her
favours to every rake in town, that will bid up to her price. She will ſmile
when ſhe wants money, be inſolent when ſhe does not, and in ſhort leave
no artifice untried, to plague his heart, and drain his pocket. A friend of
mine uſed conſtantly to rail at the ſlaviſh condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of married men,
and the tyranny of petticoat-government: he therefore prudently reſolved to
live an uncontrouled batchelor, and for this reaſon pitched upon a country
girl, who ſhould ſerve him as an handmaid. Determining to keep her in a
very ſnug and retired manner, he had even calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated how much ſhe would
ſave him in curtailing his ordinary expences at taverns and bagnios: but this
ſcheme of oeconomy did not laſt long; for the artful jade ſoon contrived 
<q rend="inline">"to wind her cloſe into his eaſy heart,"</q>
and inveigled him to maintain her in all the ſplendor and <hi>eclat</hi> of a
firſt rate lady of pleaſure. He at firſt treated her with all the
indifference of a faſhionable huſband; but as ſoon as ſhe found
herſelf to be entire miſtreſs of his affections, it is ſurpriſing to
think what pains ſhe took, to bring him to the moſt abject compliance 
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:1252700301:311"/> with all her whimſies, and to tame him to the patient
thing he now is. A frown on his part would frequently coſt him a brocade, and
a tear from her was ſure to extort a new hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief or an apron. Upon any
ſlight quarrel—O ſhe would leave him that moment;—and though
the baggage had more cunning than to hazard an intrigue with any one elſe,
ſhe would work upon his jealouſy by continually twit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him
with—She knew a gentleman, who would ſcorn to uſe her ſo
barbarouſly,—and ſhe would go to him, if ſhe could be ſure ſhe
was not with child.—This laſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was a <hi>coup de
reſerve,</hi> which never failed to bring about a reconciliation: nay, I have
known her make great uſe of breeding qualms upon occaſion; and things were
once come to ſuch an extremity, that ſhe was even forced to have recourſe
to a ſham miſcarriage to prevent their ſeparation. He has been often
heard to declare, that if he ever had a child by her, it ſhould take its
chance at the <hi>Foundling Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital.</hi> He had lately an opportunity of
putting this to a trial: but the bare hinting of ſuch a barbarous deſign
threw the lady into hyſterics. However, he was determined, that the babe, as
ſoon as it was born, ſhould be put out to nurſe,—he hated the
ſquall of children. Well! madam was brought to bed: ſhe could not bear the
dear infant out of her ſight; and it would kill her not to ſuckle it
herſelf. The father was therefore obliged to comply; and an acquaintance
caught him the other morning, ſtirring the pap, holding the clouts before the
fire, (and in a word) dwindled into a mere nurſe. Such is the transformation
of this <hi>Kind Keeper,</hi> whoſe character is ſtill more ridiculous than
that of a <hi>Fondle-wife</hi> among huſbands. The amours, indeed, of theſe
fond ſouls commonly end one of theſe two ways: they either find
themſelves deſerted by their miſtreſs, when ſhe has effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ruined their conſtitution and eſtate; or after as many years cohabitation,
as would have tired them of a wife, they <pb n="305" facs="tcp:1252700301:312"/> grow ſo
doatingly fond of their whore, that by marriage they make her an honeſt
woman, and perhaps a lady of quality.</p>
               <p>THE moſt unpardonable ſort of Keepers are Married Men, and
Old Men. I will give the reader a ſhort ſketch of each of theſe
characters, and leave him to judge for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. <hi>Cynthio</hi> about two
years ago was married to <hi>Clarinda,</hi> one of the fineſt women in the
world. Her temper and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition was as agreeable as her perſon, and
her chief endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour was to pleaſe her huſband. But <hi>Cynthio</hi>'s
folly and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſoon got the better of his conſtancy and gratitude, and
it was not ſix months after his marriage, before he took a girl he was
formerly acquainted with into keeping. His dear <hi>Polly</hi> uſes him like
a dog, and he is cruel enough to revenge the ill-treatment he receives from her
upon his wife. He ſeldom viſits her, but when his wench has put him out of
humour, and once, though indeed unknowingly, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to her a filthy
diſeaſe, for which he was obliged to his miſtreſs. Yet is he ſtill
ſo infatuated as to doat on this vile huſſy, and wiſhes it in his power
to annul his marriage, and legitimate his baſtards by <hi>Polly.</hi> Yet is
it palpable to every one but <hi>Cynthio,</hi> that <hi>Polly</hi> has no
attraction but the name of Miſtreſs, and <hi>Clarinda</hi> no fault but
being his wife.—Sir <hi>Thrifty Gripe</hi> is arrived at his Grand
Climac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teric, and has juſt taken a girl into keeping. Till very lately the
multiplication-table was his rule of life, and 
<q rend="inline">"a penny ſaved is a penny got"</q> was his
favourite maxim. But he has ſuddenly deſerted <hi>Wingate</hi> for
<hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and the <hi>Change</hi> for <hi>Covent-Garden.</hi> Here
he met with the buxom <hi>Charlotte,</hi> who at once opened his heart and his
purſe, and ſoon begun to ſcatter his guineas in paying her debts, and
ſupply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her freſh expences. Her equipage is as genteel and ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant as
that of a dutcheſs, and the wiſe men in the alley ſhake their heads at
Sir <hi>Thrifty</hi> as the greateſt ſpendthrift in town. Sir
<hi>Thrifty</hi> was formerly married to a merchant's daughter who brought him
a fortune of 20,000 l. but after ſhe had two ſons by him, he ſent her
into the North of <hi>Wales</hi> to live cheap, and prevent the probable
expence of more children. His ſons were obliged to an uncle for education, 
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:1252700301:313"/> and Sir <hi>Thrifty</hi> now ſcarce allows them enough
to ſupport them. His miſtreſs and he almoſt always appear together at
public places, where ſhe conſtantly makes a jeſt of him, while the old
dotard dangles at her elbow, like <hi>January</hi> by the ſide of
<hi>May.</hi> Thus Sir <hi>Thrifty</hi> lives, curſed by his own ſons,
jilted by his miſtreſs, and laughed at by the reſt of the world.</p>
               <p>IT is very diverting to obſerve the ſhifts to which
perſons in middling or low life are reduced, in order to bear this new
incumbrance with which they ſometimes chuſe to load them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The
extravagances of a girl has put many a clerk on defrauding his maſter, ſent
many a diſtreſſed gentleman's watch to the pawnbroker's, and his cloaths
to <hi>Monmouth Street,</hi> as well as the poor gentleman himſelf to the
gaming-table, or perhaps to <hi>Hounſlow Heath.</hi> I know a templar who
always keeps a girl for the firſt month after he receives his allowance, when
his poverty obliges him to diſcard her, and live on mutton-chops and porter
for the reſt of the quarter: and it was but lately that my mercer
diſcovered his appren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to be concerned with two others in an
aſſociation for maintaining one trull common to the whole three.</p>
               <p>THIS review of one of the chief ſources of extravagance in the
higher and middling walks of life will help us in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting for the frequent
mortgages and diſtreſſes in families of faſhion, and the numerous
bankruptcies in trade. Here alſo I cannot help obſerving that in this
caſe the miſbehaviour of the women is in great meaſure to be charged to
the men; for how can it be expected that a lady ſhould take any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
in diſcharging the domeſtic duties of a wife, when ſhe ſees her
huſband's affections placed abroad. Nothing indeed can be advanced in
vindication of looſe conduct in the fair ſex, but, conſidering our modern
morals, it is ſurely not much to be wondered at, when the huſband openly
affronts his family by keeping a wench, if the wife alſo takes care to
provide herſelf a gallant.</p>

                     <p>ROCKS, deſarts, wilds, waſtes, ſavages, and barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians
make up the ſum total of the odious country: I am juſt returned from a
viſit there, and would not <pb n="308" facs="tcp:1252700301:315"/> paſs another three weeks
in the ſame way to be lord of the manor.</p>
                     <p>HAVING received frequent invitations from Sir <hi>Sampſon
Fivebars,</hi> and having heard much of the beauty of his three ſiſters, in
an evil hour I took a reſolution to ſacrifice this <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> to
him at his ſeat in <hi>Wiltſhire.</hi> I flattered myſelf with the hopes
that the novelty and oddneſs of the ſcene would ſerve me at leaſt to
laugh at, and that if the ruſtics were not mere ſtocks and ſtones, my
cloaths and diſcourſe would have taught them to talk and dreſs like human
crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. Need I tell you that I was diſappointed? Sir <hi>Sampſon</hi>
is what the country people call a hearty man. He has the ſhape and
conſtitution of a porter, and is ſturdy enough to encounter
<hi>Broughton</hi> without mufflers; 
<q rend="inline">"when he ſpeaks, thunder breaks;"</q> he
hunts almoſt every morning, and takes a toaſt and tankard for his
breakfaſt. You may eaſily imagine, that what was pleaſure to him muſt
be torture to me; and indeed I would as ſoon draw in a mill, or carry a chair
for my diverſion, as follow any of their horrid country amuſements. But Sir
<hi>Sampſon</hi> out of his abundant good-nature inſiſted on lending me a
gun, and ſhowing me a day's ſport of ſhooting. For this purpoſe he
loaded me with a huge gun, threw a bag and pouch acroſs my ſhoulders, and
made me look for all the world like <hi>Robinſon Cruſoe.</hi> After I had
followed him over three or four ploughed fields, a ſervant, who was with us,
hollowed out, <hi>Mark!</hi> when the Baronet's gun went off ſo ſuddenly
that it threw me into a ſwoon, and at laſt I could hardly be convinced that
Sir <hi>Sampſon</hi> had ſhot nothing but a partridge.</p>
                     <p>AFTER this you will conclude that I was not to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
on to hunt. Once indeed Miſs <hi>Fanny</hi> did tempt me to accompany her on
a morning-ride, but even of this I <pb n="309" facs="tcp:1252700301:316"/> heartily repented.
Miſs <hi>Fanny,</hi> I found, valued neither hedge nor ditch, has the
ſtrength of a chair-woman, and in ſhort is more like <hi>Trulla</hi> in
<hi>Hudibras,</hi> or <hi>Boadicia</hi> in the play, than a woman of faſhion.
Unluckily too the horſe I rode was ſkittiſh and unruly; ſo that while I
was ſcampering after Miſs <hi>Fanny</hi> a ſudden ſtart brought me to
the ground. I received no hurt, but the fall ſo fluttered my ſpirits, that
Miſs <hi>Fanny</hi> was obliged to take me up behind her. When we arrived at
the houſe I was in the utmoſt confuſion, for the booby ſervants ſtood
gaping and grinning at my diſtreſs, and Sir <hi>Sampſon</hi> himſelf
told me, with a laugh as horrible as <hi>Caliban</hi>'s, that he would lend me
one of his maids to carry me out airing every morning.</p>
                     <p>BESIDES theſe and fifty other mortifications I could
ſcarce get any reſt during the whole time I remained there: every other
morning I was conſtantly waked by the hungry knight, juſt returned from the
chace and bawling for dinner. My breakfaſt was what they called their
afternoon tea, at which I always aſſiſted the ladies, for I ſhould
infallibly have periſhed had I ſtayed in the hall amidſt the jargon of
toaſts and the fumes of tobacco. I thought indeed my time might be much more
agreeably employed in the parlour; but even here my diſappointment was
grievous paſt expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Theſe fair ones, for ſuch they were, were
hale indeed and ruddy, and having been always cooped up, like turkeys in a pen,
were really no better than <hi>belles ſauvages,</hi> being totally ignorant
of the faſhionable arts and languiſhing <hi>deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cateſſe</hi> of women
of faſhion. Their cloaths were huddled on merely with a view to cover their
nakedneſs, and they had no notion that their eyes were given them for any
other purpoſe than to ſee, and what is more ſtrange, to read, forſooth!
For my part, Mr. TOWN, unleſs a woman can uſe her eyes to more advantage, I
ſhould as ſoon fall in <pb n="310" facs="tcp:1252700301:317"/> love with my lap dog or my
monkey; and what conſtitutes the difference between a lady and her cookmaid
but her taſte in dreſs? Mobs and handkerchiefs anſwer the end of
covering, but the main purpoſe of dreſs is to reveal. I really almoſt
begin to think that theſe awkard creatures were ſo ſtupid and
unaccountable as to have no deſign upon me. To complete the oddity of their
characters, theſe girls are conſtant at church, but never dreamt of
promoting an intrigue there; employ their whole time there in praying, never
heard of ſuch things as cut fans, and are ſo attentive to the queer old put
of a preacher that they ſcarce look or liſten to any one elſe. After
ſervice too the doctor is always taken home to dinner, and is as conſtant
at table on Sunday as a roaſt ſirloin and a plumb pudding.</p>
                     <p>BUT even with theſe unaccountable females, I thought I could
have paſſed my evenings tolerably if I could have got them to cards, which
have the charming faculty of rendering all women equally agreeable. But
theſe, I found, they were almoſt wholly unaccuſtomed to. I once indeed
heard the dear cards mentioned, and was in hopes of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like an
aſſembly. But what was my mortification! when inſtead of ſeeing half a
dozen card-tables &amp;c. ſet out, and Whiſt, Brag, or Lanſquenet going
forward, I ſaw theſe ſtrange women place themſelves at a huge round
table with country girls and cherry-cheeked bumkins to play, according to
annual <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> cuſtom, at Pope Joan and
Snip-ſnap-ſnorum.</p>
                     <p>IT would be endleſs to recount the miſeries I ſuffered
in thoſe three weeks. Even the neceſſaries of life were denied me, and I
could ſcarce have been more at a loſs among the <hi>Hottentots.</hi> Would
you think it, Sir? tho' this houſe had a family in it, and a family of
females too, not a drop of <pb n="311" facs="tcp:1252700301:318"/> 
                        <hi>Benjamin</hi>-waſh, nor
a duſt of almond powder could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured there, nor indeed in all the
pariſh; and I was forced to ſcrub my hands with filthy waſh-ball, which
ſo ruined their complexion that laying in gloves will not recover them this
fortnight. Add to this that I never could dreſs for want of pomatum, ſo
that my hair was always in diſhevelle, and I am ſure I ſhould not have
been known at the <hi>Dilettantì.</hi> At length, Sir! my ſnuff and
ſalts were pretty nigh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted; and to add to my diſtreſs, I loſt
my ſnuff-box. Theſe loſſes, were irreparable there; not all the country
afforded ſuch ſnuff and ſalts as mine, I could as ſoon live without
food as without either, and not a box could I touch but one of
<hi>Deard</hi>'s, and of my own chuſing. So I hurried up to town, and being
juſt recovered from the fatigue of my journey I ſend you this, in hopes
that my woeful experience will deter all my friends from following a chaſe as
mad and hare-brained as any of Sir <hi>Sampſon</hi>'s; ſince it is
impoſſible to exiſt a day there with tolerable eaſe, and neither wit

ſuch of us as are <pb n="312" facs="tcp:1252700301:319"/> unmarried are ſtrictly virtuous.

profeſſions to recommend their wares to thoſe perſons who are moſt
likely to ſtand in need of them. Thus Mrs. <hi>Giles</hi> very properly
acquaints the fair ſex, that ſhe fells her fine compound for taking off
ſuperfluous hairs at a guinea an ounce: and ladies of quality are
conſtantly informed, where they may be furniſhed with the neweſt
brocades, or the choiceſt variety of <hi>Chelſea</hi> China figures for
deſerts. It is very neceſſary that the <hi>Beau Monde</hi> ſhould be
acquainted that <hi>Eau de Luce</hi> is prepared here in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the

ſeeing repeated advertiſements in the papers <pb n="314" facs="tcp:1252700301:321"/> from
the Rich Cordial Warehouſe, introduced by an addreſs "TO THE PEOPLE OF
FASHION." I cannot but look upon this as a libel on our perſons of

ſeveral vials with an innocent liquor, and directed them with—Poiſon
for the King,—Poiſon for the Dauphin,—Poiſon for the Prime
Miniſter,—and for all the principal courtiers. The ſame might be
ſaid of theſe Rich Cordial Liquors, which however they may recommend
themſelves to the People of Faſhion by their foreign titles and extraction,
are to be conſidered as poiſons in maſquerade: and inſtead of the
pompous names of <hi>Eau d'Or, Eau Divine,</hi> and the like, I would have
labels fixed on the bottles (in imitation of <hi>Rabelais)</hi>
with—Poiſon for my Lord Duke,—Poiſon for the
Viſcount,—Poiſon for the Counteſs.</p>
               <p>WE live, indeed, in ſo polite an age, that nothing goes down
with us, but what is either imported from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi>
or dignified with a foreign appellation. Our dreſs muſt be entirely
<hi>á la mode de Paris</hi>; and I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to enſure great
ſucceſs to the <hi>Monſieur</hi> taylor, who tells us in the public
papers, that he has juſt been to <hi>France</hi> to ſee the neweſt
faſhions. A dinner is not worth eating, if not ſerved up by a
<hi>French</hi> cook; our wines are of the ſame country; and the
Dram-drinkers of Faſhion comfort their ſpirits with Rich Cordials from
<hi>Chamberry, Neuilly,</hi> and <hi>l'Iſle de Rhè.</hi> A plain man
muſt undoubtedly ſmile at the alluring names which are given to many of
them; nor is it <pb n="315" facs="tcp:1252700301:322"/> poſſible to gueſs at their
compoſition from their title. The virtues, as well as the intent, of Viper
Water may be well known: but who would imagine, that <hi>Flora Granata,</hi> or
<hi>Belle de Nuit</hi> ſhould be intended only to ſignify a dram? For my
own part I ſhould rather have taken <hi>Maraſquino</hi> for an
<hi>Italian</hi> fidler, and have concluded that <hi>Jacomonodi</hi> was no
other than an Opera-Singer.</p>
               <p>BUT Dram-drinking, however different in the phraſe, is the
ſame in the practice, in every ſtation of life; and ſipping Rich Cordials
is no leſs deteſtable, than in the vulgar idiom Bunging your Eye. What
ſignifies it, whether we meddle with <hi>Eau de Millefleurs</hi> or plain
aniſeed? or whether we fetch our drams from the Rich Cordial Warehouſe, or
the Blackamoor and Golden Still? The lady of St. <hi>James</hi>'s, who paints
her face with frequent applications of coffee or chocolate water, looks as
hideous as the trollop of St. <hi>Giles</hi>'s, who has laid on the ſame
colours by repeated half-quarterns of Gin Royal. There are many cuſtoms among
the Great, which are alſo practiſed by the lower ſort of people: and if
perſons of faſhion muſt wrap up their drams in the diſguiſe of a
variety of ſpecious titles, in this too they are rivalled by the vulgar.
Madam Gin has been chriſtened by as many names as a <hi>German</hi>
princeſs: every petty chandler's ſhop will ſell you Sky-blue, and every
night-cellar furniſh you with <hi>Holland</hi> Tape, three yards a penny. Nor
can I ſee the difference between <hi>Oil of Venus,</hi> Spirit of
<hi>Adonis,</hi> and <hi>Parfait Amour,</hi> for the uſe of our Quality, and
what among the vulgar is called <hi>Cupid's</hi> Eye-water, <hi>Strip me
naked,</hi> and <hi>Lay me down ſoftly.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>TO theſe elegant and genteel appellations it is, indeed,
chiefly owing, that Drams are not confined merely to the vulgar, but are in
eſteem among all ranks of people, and <pb n="316" facs="tcp:1252700301:323"/> eſpecially
among the ladies. Many a good woman, who would ſtart at the mention of Strong
Waters, cannot conceive there can be any harm in a Cordial. And as the fair
ſex are more particularly ſubject to a depreſſion of ſpirits, it is
no wonder that they ſhould convert their apothecaries ſhops into Rich
Cordial Warehouſes, and take Drams by way of phyſick; as the common people
make Gin ſerve for meat, drink, and cloaths. The ladies perhaps may not be
aware that every time they have recourſe to their Hartſhorn or Lavender
Drops, to drive away the vapours, they in effect take a Dram; and they may be
aſſured, that their Cholic, Surfeit, and Plague Waters are to be ranked
among ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous liquors, as well as the common ſtuff at the Gin-ſhop.
The College of Phyſicians, in their laſt review of the <hi>London</hi>
Diſpenſatory, for this very reaſon expelled the Strong Water generally
known by the ſoothing name of Hyſteric Water; becauſe it was a lure to
the female ſex to dram it by autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and to get tipſy <hi>ſecundum
artem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF any of my fair readers have at all given into this
per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious practice of Dram-drinking, I muſt intreat them to leave it off
betimes, before it has taken ſuch hold of them, as they can never ſhake
off. For the deſire of Drams ſteals upon them, and grows to be habitual, by
imperceptible degrees: as thoſe, who are accuſtomed to take Opiates, are
obliged to encreaſe the doſe gradually, and at laſt cannot ſleep
without it. The following letter may ſerve to convince them of the deplorable
ſituation of a lady, who covers her drinking under the pretence of mending
her conſtitution.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE the misfortune to be married to a poor ſickly
creature, who labours under a complication of diſorders, and which nothing
can relieve but a continued courſe of <pb n="317" facs="tcp:1252700301:324"/> Strong Liquors;
though poor woman! ſhe would not elſe touch a Dram for the world. Sometimes
ſhe is vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently troubled with the tooth-ach; and then ſhe is o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to
hold a glaſs of Rum in her mouth, to numb the pain: at other times ſhe is
ſeized with a racking fit of the cholic, and nothing will ſo ſoon give
her eaſe as ſome Right <hi>Holland</hi>'s Gin. She has the gout in her
conſtitution, and whenever ſhe feels a twitch of it, the only thing is
ſheer Brandy to keep it from her head: but this is ſometimes too
<hi>cold</hi> for her, and ſhe is forced to drive it out of her ſtomach
with true <hi>Iriſh</hi> Uſquebaugh. She is never free from the vapours,
notwithſtanding ſhe is conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually drinking Hartſhorn and water: and
ever ſince ſhe miſcarried, ſhe is ſo hyſterical in the night time,
that ſhe never lies without a Cordial-Water bottle by her bedſide. I have
paid the apothecary about fifty pounds for her in one year, and his bill is
laced down with nothing but Drops, Pepper Mint Water, and the Cordial Draught
repeated.</p>
                     <p>HER very diet muſt always be made <hi>heartening,</hi>
other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will do her no good. Tea would make her low-ſpirited, except
ſhe was to qualify every diſh with a large ſpoonful of Rum. She has a
glaſs of Mountain with Bitters an hour before dinner to create an appetite:
and her ſtomach is ſo poor, that when ſhe is at table, ſhe muſt force
every bit down with a glaſs of Madeira. We uſually have a tiff of punch
together in the evening: but the acid would gripe her, and the water keep her
awake all the night, if it was not made <hi>comfortable</hi> with more than an
equal portion of Spirit.</p>
                     <p>BUT notwithſtanding the grievous complaints ſhe hourly
labours under, ſhe is very hale, and her complexion is, to 
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:1252700301:325"/> all appearance, as healthy and florid, as a milk-maid's:
except indeed that her noſe and forehead are ſubject to red pimples,
blotches, and breakings out, which the apothecary tells me are owing to a kind
of an acrimonious humour in her blood. For my part, conſidering the quantity
of combuſtibles ſhe continually pours down, I ſhould imagine the fire in
her ſtomach would kindle a flame in her countenance; and I ſhould not
wonder if her face looked as horrible, as thoſe who hang over a bowl of burnt
Brandy at Snap-Dragon.</p>

and utmoſt effort of his genius and pleaſantry is <hi>The</hi> FROLICK.
This piece of humour conſiſts in playing the moſt wild and extravagant
pranks that wantonneſs and debauchery can ſuggeſt; and is the
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing characteriſtic of the Buck and Blood. Theſe facetious
gentlemen, whenever Champagne has put them in ſpirits, ſally out 
<q rend="inline">"flown with inſolence and wine"</q> in queſt
of adventures. At ſuch a time the more harm they do the more they ſhew
their wit; and their Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks, like the mirth of a monkey, are made up of
miſchief.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:1252700301:327"/>THE Frolick formerly ſignified nothing
more than a piece of innocent mirth and gaiety; but the modern ſenſe of the
word is much more lively and ſpirited. The Mohocks and Hell Fire Club, the
heroes of the laſt generation, were the firſt who introduced theſe
elevated Frolicks, and ſtruck out mighty good jokes from all kinds of
violence and blaſphemy. The preſent race of Bucks commonly begin their
Frolick in a tavern, and end it in the round-houſe, and during the courſe
of it practiſe ſeveral mighty pretty pleaſantries. There is a great deal
of humour in what is called <hi>beating the rounds,</hi> that is in plain
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> taking a tour of the principal bawdy-houſes: breaking of
lamps and ſkirmiſhes with watchmen are very good jeſts; and the
inſulting any dull ſober fools that are quietly trudging about their
buſineſs, or a rape on a modeſt woman are particularly facetious.
Whatever is in violation of all decency and order is an exquiſite piece of
wit, and in ſhort a Frolick and <hi>playing the devil</hi> bear the ſame
explanation in a modern gloſſary.</p>
               <p>IT is ſurprizing how much invention there is in theſe
exploits, and how wine inſpires theſe gentlemen with thoughts more
extraordinary and ſublime than any ſober man could ever have deviſed. I
have known a whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſtart from their chairs, and begin tilting at
each other merely for their diverſion. Another time theſe exalted
geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſſes have caſt lots which ſhould be thrown out of the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow;
and at another make a bonfire of their cloaths and run naked into the
ſtreets. I remember a little gentleman not above five feet high, who was
reſolved, merely for the ſake of the Frolick, to lie with the Tall Woman,
but the joke ended in his receiving a ſound cudgelling from the hands of his
<hi>Thaleſtris.</hi> It was no longer ago than laſt winter that a party of
jovial Templars ſet out an hour or two after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night <pb n="321" facs="tcp:1252700301:328"/>
on a voyage to <hi>Liſbon</hi> in order to get good Port. They took boat at
the Temple-ſtairs, and prudently laid in by way of proviſions a cold
veniſon paſty and two bottles of raſberry brandy: but when they imagined
themſelves juſt arrived at <hi>Graveſend,</hi> they found themſelves
ſuddenly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet in <hi>Chelſea</hi>-Reach, and very narrowly eſcaped
being drowned. The moſt innocent Frolicks of theſe men of humour are
carried on in a literary way by advertiſements in the newſpapers, with
which they often amuſe the town; and alarm us with bottle-conjurors, and
perſons who will jump down their own throats. Sometimes they divert
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by impoſing on their acquaintance with fictitious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues,
and putting modeſt women to the bluſh by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing them in the publick
papers. Once, I remember, it was the Frolick to call together all the wet
nurſes that want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a place; at another time to ſummon ſeveral old women
to bring their male tabby cats, for which they were to expect a conſiderable
price; and not long ago, by the proffer of a curacy, they drew all the poor
parſons to St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Coffee-houſe, where the Bucks themſelves
ſat in another box to ſmoke their ruſty wigs and brown caſſocks.</p>
               <p>BUT the higheſt Frolick that can poſſibly be put in
execution is a genteel murder; ſuch as running a waiter through the body,
knocking an old feeble watchman's brains out with his own ſtaff, or taking
away the life of ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular ſcoundrel, who has not ſpirit enough to
whore and drink like a gentleman. The nobleſt Frolick of this kind I ever
remember happened a few years ago at a country town. While a party of Bucks
were making a riot at an inn, and toſſing the chairs and tables, and
looking-glaſſes into the ſtreet, the landlady was indiſcreet enough to
come up ſtairs, and interrupt their merriment with her imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
remonſtrances; upon which they immediately threw <pb n="322" facs="tcp:1252700301:329"/> her
out of the window after her own furniture. News was ſoon brought of the poor
woman's death, and the whole company looked upon it as a very droll accident,
and gave orders that ſhe ſhould be charged in the bill.</p>
               <p>THESE wild pranks are inſtances of great ſpirit and
invention, but, alas! the generality of mankind have no taſte for humour. Few
people care to have a ſword in their ribs for the ſake of the joke, or to
be beat to mummy or ſhot through the head for the diverſion of the good
company. They ſometimes imagine the jeſt is carried too far, and are apt to
apply the words of the old fable, 
<q rend="inline">"It may be ſport to you, but it is death to
us."</q> For theſe reaſons a ſet of theſe merry gentlemen are as
terrible to the ordinary part of the world as a troop of banditti; and an
affair which has been thought very high fun in. <hi>Pall Mall</hi> or
<hi>Covent Garden,</hi> has been treated in a very ſerious manner at
<hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> or the <hi>Old Baily.</hi> Our legiſlature has
been abſurd enough to be very careful of the lives of the loweſt among the
people, and the council for a highwayman would ſooner plead diſtreſs as
an excuſe for diſcharging his piſtol than mere wantonneſs and Frolick
Nor do the governments abroad entertain a better opinion of this ſort of
humour; for it is but a few years, ſince a gentleman on his travels who was
compleating a Town Education by the polite tour, ſhot a waiter through the
head: but the joke was ſo ill received, that the gentleman was hanged within
four and twenty hours. It would be adviſeable therefore for theſe
gentlemen, ſince the taſte of the age is ſo incorrigible, to lay aſide
this high-ſeaſoned humour. For their piſtol, as it were, recoils upon
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and ſince it may produce their own deaths, it would be more
prudent not to draw their wit out of their ſcabbards.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="323" facs="tcp:1252700301:330"/>OUR Ladies of quality, who have at length
adopted <hi>French</hi> manners with <hi>French</hi> faſhions, and thrown off
all ſtarchneſs and reſerve with the ruff and the farthingale, are very
fond of a Frolick. I have indeed lately obſerved with great pleaſure the
commendable attempts of the other ſex to ſhake of the ſhackles of
cuſtom, and I make no doubt but a libertine lady will ſoon become a very
common character. If their paſſion for Gaming continues to encreaſe in
the ſame proportion that it has for ſome time paſt, we ſhall very
ſoon meet with abundance of ſharpers in petticoats; and it will be
mentioned as a very familiar incident that a party of female gamblers were
ſiezed by the conſtables at the gaming-table. I am alſo informed that it
is grown very common among the ladies to toaſt pretty fellows; and that they
often amuſe themſelves with concerting ſchemes for an excellent Frolick.
A Frolick is indeed the moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient name in the world to veil an
intrigue, and it is a great pity that huſbands and fathers ſhould ever
object to it. I can ſee no harm in a lady's going diſguiſed to mob it in
the gallery at the play-houſe; and could not but ſmile at the pretty
innocent wanton who carried the joke ſo far as to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company a ſtrange
gentleman to a bagnio; but when ſhe came there, was ſurprized to find that
he was fond of a Frolick as well as herſelf, and offered her violence. But I
particularly admire the ſpirit of that lady, who had ſuch true reliſh for
a Frolick, as to go with her gallant to the Maſquerade, though ſhe knew he
had no breeches under his Domino.</p>
               <p>I MOST heartily congratulate the fine ladies and gentlemen of
the age on the ſpirit with which they perſue their diverſions; and I look
upon a bold Frolick as the peculiar privilege of a perſon of faſhion. The
ladies undoubtedly ſee a great deal of pleaſantry in an intrigue, and 
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:1252700301:331"/> mimick the dreſs and manners of the courtezans very
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily and facetiouſly: while the gentlemen, among many other new fancies,
have made the old blunder of the Merry Andrew, appear no longer ridiculous, and
are mightily pleaſed with the <hi>comical humours of a murder.</hi> The
Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks now in vogue will probably continue to be the amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the
polite world for a long time; but whenever the faſhion is about to vary, I
beg leave to propoſe the Frolick recommended, if I remember right, to the
Duke of <hi>Wharton</hi> by Dr. <hi>Swift.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"When you are tired of your other Frolicks, I
would have you take up the Frolick of BEING GOOD; and take my word for it, you
will find it the moſt agreeable Frolick you ever practiſed in your
life.</q>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE once prevailed among us a ſect called <hi>The</hi>
ADAMITES, whoſe doctrine, like that of our preſent <hi>Moravians,</hi> was
calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to comfort the fleſh as well as the ſpirit, and many things
generally accounted inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and immodeſt, were with them regarded as
principles of religion. The chief article maintained by this ſect was, that
it was proper, like our great forefather <hi>Adam,</hi> to go naked; and the
proſelytes to this faith came abroad in the public ſtreets and open
daylight without any cloathing. But this primitive ſimplicity did not agree
with the notions of thoſe degenerate days, and the ADAMITES were looked 
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:1252700301:333"/> upon as an intolerable nuſance. Their religion, like
all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, was ſoon attended with perſecution; and ſome of the converts
were dragged naked to the cart's tail, ſome ſet in the ſtocks, and others
ſent to <hi>Bridewell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>SINCE that remarkable period the male part of our ſpecies have
been decently covered; but the female world has made ſeveral bold attempts to
throw off the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of cloaths. Caps, handkerchiefs, tuckers, and
mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty-pieces have been long diſcarded; and the ladies have continued
every year to ſhed ſome other part of their dreſs as uſeleſs and
unornamental. But theſe are only half aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the female rights
and natural liberty, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon to the project, which, it is thought,
will be ripe for execution by ſummer. A ſet of ladies of the firſt
faſhion have agreed to found a ſect of <lb/>EVITES, <lb/>who are to appear in
public with no other covering than the original Fig-leaf. The primitive
ſimplicity of appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance will be reſtored: and, though ſome may be
cenſorious enough to imagine that their confidence ariſes from very
different principles, it may very juſtly be ſaid of our ladies of quality,
as of our firſt parents before the fall, 
<q rend="inline">"They are naked, and <hi>are not
aſhamed.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>MY country readers, and all thoſe who live at a diſtance
from the polite world, may perhaps look upon this ſcheme as merely
fantaſtical and imaginary; but nothing is more true. The milliners are at
this time all very buſy in making up artificial Fig-leaves, and adorning them
according to the different fancies of the wearers. There is more taſte
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in contriving an elegant Fig-leaf, than has hitherto been exerted
in forming a genteel ſword-knot. Some have <pb n="327" facs="tcp:1252700301:334"/> bunches of
the gayeſt coloured ribbons dangling looſely from the ſtalk, others
toſſels of gold and ſilver lace, and a few deſigned for ladies of the
higheſt diſtinction bunches of diamonds. This and the <hi>Pompon,</hi>
which it is ſaid has been lately worn merely as a type of the Fig-leaf, will
make up the common dreſs of the whole female world: but if ever the weather
ſhould be too ſevere for the ladies to appear (as <hi>Bayes</hi>
expreſſes it) <hi>in puris naturalibus,</hi> they are to wear
fleſh-coloured ſilks with <hi>Pompons</hi> and Fig-leaves as uſual.</p>
               <p>THERE are perhaps perſons who as they ſtill retain ſome of
the leaven of decency in their compoſition, will be ſtartled at this
project. I muſt own however that it does not appear to me to be in the
leaſt extraordinary or ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing: for conſidering the preſent dreſs
of our women of faſhion, there remains no further ſtep to be taken except
abſolute nakedneſs. The ſtays and petticoat have been ſo unmercifully
pruned and cut away in order to diſcover latent beauties, that if thoſe of
the preſent mode were to fall into the hands of our diſtant poſterity
they would conclude that the preſent race of women muſt have been a
generation of pigmies; for they could never poſſibly conceive that they
were of common ſize, and wore by way of dreſs any garments ſo little
calculated either for uſe or ornament. If one might judge by appearances, the
little modeſty that is left in the polite world ſeems to be among the men;
and one is almoſt tempted to look for the rakes, and perſons of intrigue in
the other ſex. I was preſent a few nights ago at the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of
<hi>The Chances</hi>; and when I looked round the boxes and obſerved the
looſe dreſs of all the ladies, and the great reliſh with which they
received the high-ſeaſoned jeſts in that Comedy, I was almoſt
apprehenſive that the old ſtory of the outrage of the <hi>Romans</hi> on
the <hi>Sabine</hi> women would be inverted, and that the ladies would riſe
up, and commit a rape on the men.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:1252700301:335"/>BUT notwithſtanding all that may be
ſaid againſt this project for eſtabliſhing nakedneſs, it is not
without example. Among the <hi>Hottentots,</hi> a very wiſe and polite
nation, the ladies at this day go quite naked, except a looſe mantle thrown
over their ſhoulders, and a ſhort apron before inſtead of a fig leaf. It
is alſo well known that the <hi>Spartans</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed their unmarried women
to wear a ſort of a looſe robe, which at every motion diſcovered their
charms through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral openings contrived for that purpoſe. There would
certainly be no harm in extending this liberty to the whole ſex, and I am not
in the leaſt inclined to liſten to the malignant inſinuations that when a
married woman endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to look particularly tempting, it is not merely to
pleaſe her huſband, but to captivate a gallant. It may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be further
objected that our Northern climate is too cold to ſtrip in: but this little
inconvenience is amply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated by the ſecurity the ladies will create
to themſelves by taking ſuch extraordinary liberties, and carrying matters
ſo very far that it will be indecent even to reprehend them.</p>
               <p>THERE is however a very large part of the ſex, for whom I am
greatly concerned on this occaſion. I mean the Old and the Ugly. Whatever the
Belles may get by this faſhion, theſe poor ladies will be great
ſufferers. Their faces are already more than is agreeable to be ſhewn; but
if they expoſe ſickly ſkins furrowed and purſed up like
waſher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>women's fingers, the ſight will become too diſguſting. During
the preſent mode I have obſerved that the diſplay of a yellow neck or
clumſy leg has created but few admirers: and it is reaſonable to conclude
that when the new faſhion begins to prevail univerſally, although our men
of pleaſure will be glad to ſee the young and beautiful ladies, whom they
would deſire to take into their arms, ſtripping as faſt as poſſible,
yet they are not ſo fond of primitive and original <pb n="329" facs="tcp:1252700301:336"/>
ſimplicity as to be captivated by a lady who has none of the charms of
<hi>EVE,</hi> except her nakedneſs.</p>
               <p>SOME perſons of more than ordinary penetration are apt to look
on this project in a political light, and conſider it as a ſcheme to
counter-work the Marriage-Act. But as the chief ladies who concerted it are
already provided with huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and are known to be very well affected to
the Government, this does not appear probable. It is more likely to be an
artifice of the Beauties to make their ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority inconteſtible, by
drawing in the dowdies of the ſex to ſuffer by ſuch an injurious
contraſt. However this may be, it is very certain that the moſt lovely of
the ſex are about to employ the whole artillery of their charms againſt us,
and indeed ſeem reſolved to ſhoot us flying. On this occaſion it is to
be hoped that the practice of painting, which is now ſo very faſhionable,
will be entirely laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide: for whoever incruſts herſelf in paint can
never be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be naked; and it is ſurely more elegant for a lady to be
covered even with ſilk and linen, than to be daubed, like an old wall, with
plaiſter and rough-caſt.</p>
               <p>AFTER this account of the ſchemes of our modiſh fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males now
in agitation, which the reader may depend upon as genuine, it only remains to
let him know how I came by my intelligence. <hi>The</hi> PARLIAMENT OF WOMEN
lately propoſed is now actually ſitting. Upon their firſt meeting after
the preliminaries were adjuſted, the whole houſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally reſolved
itſelf into a Committee on the affairs of Dreſs. The Fig-leaf Bill, the
purport of which is contained in this paper, was brought in a by noble
Counteſs, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned ſome very warm debates. Two ladies in
particular made ſeveral remarkable ſpeeches on this occaſion: but 
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:1252700301:337"/> they were both imagined to ſpeak, like our male
patriots, more for their own private intereſt than for the good of the
Public. For one of theſe ladies, who inſiſted very earneſtly on the
decency of ſome ſort of covering, and has a very beautiful face, is
ſhrewdly ſuſpected not to be ſo much above all rivalry in the turn and
proportion of her limbs: and the other, who was impatient to be undreſſed
with all expedition, was thought to be too much influenced by her known
partiality to a favourite mole, which now lays out of ſight. The Bill however
was paſſed by a very conſiderable majority, and is intended to be put in
force by Midſummer Day next enſuing.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE idle ſuperſtitions of the vulgar are no where ſo
conſpicuous as in the affairs of love. When a raw girl's brain is once turned
with a ſweetheart, ſhe converts every trifling accident of her life into a
good or bad omen, and makes every thing conſpire to ſtrengthen her in ſo
pleaſing a deluſion. <hi>Virgil</hi> repreſents <hi>Dido,</hi> as ſoon
as ſhe has contracted her fatal paſſion for <hi>Aeneas,</hi> as going to
the prieſts to have her fortune told. In like manner the loveſick girl runs
to the cunning-man, or croſſes the gipſy's <pb n="332" facs="tcp:1252700301:339"/> hand
with her laſt ſixpence, to know when ſhe ſhall be married, how many
children ſhe ſhall have, and whether ſhe ſhall be happy with her
huſband. She alſo conſults the cards, and finds out her lover in the
Knave of Hearts. She learns how to interpret dreams, and every night
furniſhes her with meditations for the next day. If ſhe happens to bring
out any thing in converſation which another perſon was about to ſay,
ſhe comforts herſelf that ſhe ſhall be married before them; and if
ſhe tumbles as ſhe is running up ſtairs, imagines ſhe ſhall go to
church with her ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart before the week is at an end. But if in the
courſe of their amour ſhe gives the dear man her hair wove in a
True-lover's Knot, or breaks a crooked nine pence with him, ſhe thinks
herſelf aſſured of his inviolable fidelity.</p>
               <p>IT would puzzle the moſt profound antiquary to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
what could give birth to the many ſtrange notions che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by fond nymphs
and ſwains. The God of Love has more ſuperſtitious votaries, and is
worſhipped with more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable rites than any fabulous deity whatever.
Nothing indeed is ſo whimſical as the imagination of a perſon in love.
The dying ſhepherd carves the name of his miſtreſs on the trees, while
the fond maid knits him a pair of garters with an amorous poſey; and both
look on what they do as a kind of charm to ſecure the affection of the other.
A lover will rejoice to give his miſtreſs a bracelet or a top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knot, and
ſhe perhaps will take pleaſure in working him a pair of ruffles. Theſe
they will regard as the ſoft bonds of love, but neither would on any account
run the riſk of <hi>cutting love,</hi> by giving or receiving ſuch a
preſent as a knife or a pair of ſciſſars. But to wear the picture of
the beloved object conſtantly near the heart is univerſally accounted a
moſt excellent and never-failing preſervative of affection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="333" facs="tcp:1252700301:340"/>SOME few years ago there was publickly
advertiſed, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the other extraordinary medicines whoſe wonderful
qualities are daily related in the laſt page of our news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers, a moſt
efficacious love-powder; by which a deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lover might create affection
in the boſom of the moſt cruel miſtreſs. Lovers have indeed always been
fond of enchantment. <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> has repreſented <hi>Othello</hi>
as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of winning his <hi>Deſdemona</hi> by 
<q rend="inline">"conjuration and mighty magic;"</q> and
<hi>Theocritus</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> have both in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced women into their
paſtorals uſing charms and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations to recover the affection of their
ſweethearts. In a word, Taliſmans, Genii, Witches, Fairies, and all the
inſtruments of magic and enchantment were firſt diſcovered by lovers, and
employed in the buſineſs of love.</p>
               <p>BUT I never had a thorough inſight into all this amorous
ſorcery till I received the following letter, which was ſent me from the
country, a day or two after <hi>Valentine</hi>'s Day, and I make no doubt but
all true lovers moſt religiouſly performed the previous rites mentioned by
my correſpondent.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>YOU muſt know I am in love with a very clever man, a
Londoner; and as I want to know whether it is my fortune to have him, I have
tried all the tricks I can hear of for that purpoſe. I have ſeen him
ſeveral times in Coffee-grounds with a ſword by his ſide; and he was once
at the bottom of a Tea-cup in a coach and ſix with two footmen behind it. I
got up laſt May morning, and went into the fields to hear the cuckow; and
when I pulled off my left ſhoe, I found an hair in it exactly the 
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:1252700301:341"/> ſame colour with his. But I ſhall never forget what
I did laſt Midſummer Eve. I and my two ſiſters tried the Dumb Cake
together: you muſt know, two muſt make it, two bake it, two break it, and
the third put it under each of their pillows, (but you muſt not ſpeak a
word all the time) and then you will dream of the man you are to have. This we
did; and to be ſure I did nothing all night, but dream of Mr.
<hi>Bloſſom.</hi> The ſame night, exactly at twelve o'clock, I ſowed
Hempſeed in our back yard, and ſaid to myſelf, 
<q rend="inline">"Hempſeed I ſow, Hempſeed I hoe, and he
that is my true-love, come after me and mow."</q> Will you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve me? I
looked back, and ſaw him behind me, as plain as eyes could ſee him. After
that, I took a clean ſhift, and turned it, and hung upon the back of a chair;
and very likely my ſweetheart would have come and turned it right again, (for
I heard his ſtep) but I was frightened, and could not help ſpeaking, which
broke the charm. I likewiſe ſtuck up two Midſummer Men, one for myſelf,
and one for him. Now if his had died away, we ſhould never have come
together: but I aſſure you he blowed and turned to me. Our maid
<hi>Betty</hi> tells me, that if I go backwards with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpeaking a word into
the garden upon Midſummer Eve, and gather a Roſe, and keep it in a clean
ſheet of paper, without looking at it, till <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> day, it will
be as freſh as in June; and if I then ſtick it in my boſom, he that is to
be my huſband will come and take it out. If I am not married before the time
comes about again, I will certainly do it; and only mind if Mr.
<hi>Bloſſom</hi> is not the man.</p>
                     <p>I HAVE tried a great many other fancies, and they have all
turned out right. Whenever I go to lye in a ſtrange bed, I always tye my
garter nine times round the bed-poſt, and <pb n="335" facs="tcp:1252700301:342"/> knit nine
knots in it, and ſay to myſelf, <hi>This knot I knit, this knot I tye, To
ſee my love as he goes by, In his apparel and array, As he walks in every
day.</hi> I did ſo laſt holidays at my uncle's; and to be ſure I ſaw
Mr. <hi>Bloſſom</hi> draw my cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and tuck up the cloaths at my bed's
feet. Couſin <hi>Debby</hi> was married a little while ago, and ſhe ſent
me a piece of Bride-Cake to put under my pillow; and I had the ſweeteſt
dream—I thought we were going to be married together. I have, many is the
time, taken great pains to pare an Apple Whole, and afterwards flung the Peel
over my head; and it always falls in the ſhape of the firſt letter of his
Sirname or Chriſtian name. I am ſure Mr. <hi>Bloſſom</hi> loves me,
becauſe I ſtuck two of the Kernels upon my forehead, while I thought upon
him and the lubberly ſquire my pappa wants me to have: Mr.
<hi>Bloſſom</hi>'s Kernel ſtuck on, but the other dropt off directly.</p>
                     <p>LAST Friday, Mr. TOWN, was <hi>Valentine</hi>'s Day; and I'll
tell you what I did the night before. I got five bay-leaves, and pinned four of
them to the four corners of my pillow, and the fifth to the middle; and then if
I dreamt of my ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heart, <hi>Betty</hi> ſaid we ſhould be married
before the year was out. But to make it more ſure, I boiled an egg hard, and
took out the yolk, and filled it up with ſalt; and when I went to bed, eat it
ſhell and all, without ſpeaking or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after it: and this was to have
the ſame effect with the bay-leaves. We alſo wrote our lovers names upon
bits of paper, and rolled them up in clay, and put them into wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and the
firſt that roſe up, was to be our Valentine. Would you think it? Mr.
<hi>Bloſſom</hi> was my man: and I lay a-bed and ſhut my eyes all the
morning, till he came to our houſe; for I would not have ſeen another man
before him for all the world.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="336" facs="tcp:1252700301:343"/>DEAR Mr. TOWN, if you know any other
ways to try our fortune by, do put them in your paper. My Mamma laughs at us,
and ſays there is nothing in them; but I am ſure there is, for ſeveral
Miſſes at our boarding ſchool have tried them, and they have all happened
true: and I am ſure my own ſiſter <hi>Hetty,</hi> who died juſt before

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HERE is no phraſe in the whole voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulary of modern
converſation, which has a more vague ſignification than the words 
<q rend="inline">"Good Company."</q> People of faſhion
modeſtly explain it to mean only them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and, like the old
<hi>Romans,</hi> look on all others as Barbarians. Thus a ſtar or a ribband,
a title or a place denotes Good Company; and a man riſes in the eſteem of
the polite circle according to his rank or his rent-roll. This way of
reaſoning is ſo well known and ſo generally adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we are not
ſurprized to hear polite perſons com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain at their return from the play,
that the houſe was very much crouded, but that there was no Company: though
indeed I could not help ſmiling at a lady's ſaying ſhe preferred St.
<hi>James</hi>'s church to St. <hi>George</hi>'s, becauſe the pews were
commonly filled with better Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:1252700301:345"/>I PROPOSE at preſent to conſider this
comprehenſive term only as it reſpects a ſociety of friends, who meet in
order to paſs their time in an agreeable manner. To do this the more
effectually I ſhall take a curſory view of the ſeveral methods now in
vogue, by which a ſet of acquaintance endeavour to amuſe each other. The
reader will here meet with ſome very extraordinary inventions for this
purpoſe; and when he has fixed his choice, may try to introduce himſelf
into that company he likes beſt.</p>
               <p>THERE is a great demand for wit and humour in ſome parts of
this metropolis. Among many he is reckoned the Beſt Company who can enliven
his converſation with ſtrokes of facetiouſneſs, and in
<hi>Shakeſpear</hi>'s words 
<q rend="inline">"ſet the table on a roar."</q> But as wit and
humour do not always fall to the ſhare of thoſe who aim at ſhining in
converſation, our jokers and witlings have wiſely deviſed ſeveral
mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical ways of gaining that end. I know one who is thought a very
facetious fellow by the club, of which he is a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe every night,
as ſoon as the clock ſtrikes twelve, he begins to crow like a cock. Another
is accounted a man of <hi>immenſe humour</hi> for entertaining his friends
with a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque hornpipe: and a third has the reputation of being excellent
Company by ſinging a ſong, and at the ſame time playing the tune upon the
table with his knuckles and elbows. Mimickry is in theſe ſocieties an
indiſpenſible re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite in a good companion. Imitations of the actors
and other well-known characters are very much admired. But the mimic is by no
means limited to an imitation of the human ſpecies; for an exact
repreſentation of the brute creation will procure him infinite applauſe.
Very many of theſe wits may be met with in different quarters of the town;
and it is but a week ago ſince I was invited to paſs the evening with a
ſociety, which, after a diſplay of their <pb n="339" facs="tcp:1252700301:346"/> ſeveral
talents, I found to conſiſt of a Dog, a Cat, a Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key, an Aſs, and a
couple of Dancing Bears.</p>
               <p>I CANNOT help looking with ſome veneration on the wit exerted
in ſocieties of this ſort, ſince it has the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary quality of
never creating either diſguſt or ſatiety. They aſſemble every night,
tell the ſame ſtories, repeat the ſame jokes, ſing the ſame ſongs;
and they are every night attended with the ſame applauſe and merriment.
Conſidering how much their wit is uſed, it is ſurpriſing that it
ſhould not be worn out. Sometimes however one of the ſociety makes a new
acquiſition, which is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately thrown into the common ſtock of humour,
and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly diſplayed as part of the entertainment of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. A
gentleman of this caſt lately ſhewed me with great joy the poſtſcript
of a letter, in which his correſpondent promiſed him <hi>huge fun</hi> the
next time he ſhould ſee him, for he had got two new ſtories and three or
four excellent ſongs from one of the actors.</p>
               <p>THESE are certainly very agreeable methods of paſſing the
evening, and muſt pleaſe all perſons who have any reliſh for wit and
humour. But theſe powers of entertaining are not every where the ſtandard
of Good Company. There are places in which he is the Beſt Company who drinks
moſt. A Boon Companion lays it down as a rule that 
<q rend="inline">"talking ſpoils converſation."</q> A bumper
is his argument, and his firſt care is to promote a briſk circulation of
the bottle. He ſhews his eſteem for an abſent friend by toaſting him in
a bumper extraordinary, and is frequently ſo good and loyal a ſubject as to
drink His Majeſty's health in half-pints. If he is deſired to ſing a
catch, he ſtill keeps the main point in view, and gives a ſong wrote in
ſo ingenious a ſtile, that it obliges the company to toſs off a glaſs
at the <pb n="340" facs="tcp:1252700301:347"/> end of every ſtanza. If he talks, it is of 
<q rend="inline">"healths five fathom deep,"</q> or a late
<hi>hard bout</hi> with another ſet of jolly fellows; and he takes care by a
quick round of Toaſts to ſupply the want of other converſation.</p>
               <p>I HAVE ever thought the invention of Toaſts very uſeful and
ingenious. They at once promote hard drinking, and ſerve as a kind of
memorials of every glaſs that has been drank: They alſo furniſh thoſe
with converſation who have nothing to ſay, or at leaſt, by baniſhing
all other topics, put the whole company on a level. Beſides all this three or
four rounds of Toaſts, where a good many are met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, muſt
unavoidably lift them all into Good Company. Theſe are no ſmall advantages
to ſociety; not to mention the wit and morality contained in many
Toaſts.</p>
               <p>TOASTS are doubtleſs very uſeful and entertaining; but the
wiſeſt inſtitution ever made in drinking ſocieties is the cuſtom of
appointing what is called an Abſolute Toaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter. The gentleman
inveſted with this dignity is created king of the company, and, like other
abſolute monarchs, he commonly makes great uſe of his power. It is
particularly his office to name the Toaſt, to obſerve that every man duly
toſſes off his bumper, and is in every reſpect Good Company. He is alſo
to correct all miſdemeanors, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly puniſhes an offender by
ſconcing him a bumper: that is, in the language of hard drinkers, not
unmercifully denying him his due glaſs, but obliging him to add another to it
of perhaps double the quantity. For offences of a very heinous nature, the
tranſgreſſor is ordered a decanter of water, or a tankard of ſmall
beer. The privilege of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting a bumper is exerted almoſt every moment,
for there is hardly any ſort of behaviour which does not produce this
puniſhment. I have known a man ſconced for drinking, <pb n="341" facs="tcp:1252700301:348"/>
for not drinking, for ſinging, for talking, for being ſilent, and at length
ſconced dead drunk, and made very Good Company.</p>
               <p>BUT none of theſe qualifications abovementioned conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute
Good Company in the genteel part of the world. Polite aſſemblies neither
aim at wit and humour, nor make the leaſt pretence to cultivate ſociety.
Their whole evenings are conſumed at the card-table, without the leaſt
attempt at any other converſation, but the uſual altercations of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
between the deals. Whiſt has deſtroyed converſation, ſpoilt ſociety,
and murdered ſleep. This kind of Good Company is as ridiculous, and more
inſipid than either the ſociety of witlings or hard drinkers. Toſſing
off bumpers is as rational, and an employment infinitely more joyous than
ſhuffling a pack of cards a whole night: and puns, jokes, and mimickry
however ſtale and repeated, furniſh the company with converſation of as
much uſe and variety as the odd trick, and four by Honours.</p>
               <p>SUCH are the agreeable evenings paſſed at <hi>White</hi>'s
and the other coffee-houſes about St. <hi>James</hi>'s. Such is the
happineſs of Routes, Drums, and Hurricanes; and without Gaming and intrigues
what inſipid things are even Maſquerades and Ridottos! At ſuch meetings,
the man who is Good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany plays the game very well, knows more caſes than
are in <hi>Hoyle,</hi> and often poſſeſſes ſome particular
qualifications, which would be no great recommendation to him any where elſe.
Inſtead of meeting together, like other companies, with a deſire of mutual
delight, they ſit down with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon the pockets of each other:
though indeed it is no wonder, when one has ſtripped another of two or three
thouſand pounds, if the ſuccesful gameſter thinks the perſon he has
fleeced very Good Company.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="342" facs="tcp:1252700301:349"/>BY what has been ſaid it appears that
the notion of Good Company excludes all uſeful converſation: which in
either of the above-mentioned ſocieties would undoubtedly be deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed as
ſtupid and pedantic. The witlings have too lively a genius, and too warm an
imagination to admit it. The Boon Companions can join nothing but love to a
bottle: and among Gameſters it would, like ſleep, be mere loſs of time,
and hinderance of buſineſs. Yet an accompliſhed member of either of
theſe ſocieties is called Good Company; which is juſt as proper an
expreſſion, as, according to Serjeant <hi>Kite, Carolus</hi> is good
<hi>Latin</hi> for Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> or a ſtout beating. But a ſet of
people who aſſemble for no other purpoſe than to game, have, in
particular, ſo very bad a title to the denomination of Good Company, that
they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me to be the very worſt.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg> MISFORTUNE, which happened to me the other day,
ſufficiently convinced me of the inconveniences ariſing from the
indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate power lodged in our Preſs Gangs. I would not have the
reader think, that I was preſſed myſelf:—but my Devil (that is, the
meſſenger of the printing-houſe) was carried off, as he was going with
the copy of a Connoiſſeur to preſs. Learning appears to me of ſo much
importance, that (in my opinion) the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of the loweſt retainers to it
ſhould be ſacred from <pb n="344" facs="tcp:1252700301:351"/> moleſtation; and it gives me
concern, (though a very loyal ſubject), that even a ballad-ſinger, or the
hawker of Bloody News ſhould be interupted in their literary vocations. I
have in vain endeavoured to recover my M.S. again: for, though I cannot but
think any one of my papers of almoſt as much conſequence to the nation as
the fitting out a fleet, the ignorant ſailors were ſo regardleſs of its
ineſtimable contents, that after much enquiry I detected them (with my Devil
in conjunction) lighting their pipes with it, at a low alehouſe by <hi>Puddle
Dock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS irretrievable loſs to the public, as well as myſelf,
led me to conſider, whether ſome other method might not be thought of, to
raiſe ſufficient forces for the fleet and army, without diſturbing poor
labourers and honeſt mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nics in their peaceful occupations. I have at
length, with great pains and expence of thought, hit upon a Scheme which will
effectually anſwer that end; and without further preface ſhall lay it
before the world.</p>
               <p>I WOULD propoſe, that every uſeleſs member of the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity ſhould be made of ſervice to his country, by being obliged to
climb the ropes, or carry a muſquet; and every detrimental one ſhould be
prevented from injuring his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, and ſent to annoy the common enemy.
To begin with the country. There is no occaſion to rob the fields of their
huſbandmen, or to fetch our ſoldiers, as the <hi>Romans</hi> took their
Dictator, from the plough. It is well known, that every county can ſupply us
with numerous recruits, if we were to raiſe them out of that idle body called
Country Squires; many of whom are born only for the deſtruction of game, and
diſturbance of their neighbours, They are mere vegetables, which grow up and
rot on the ſame ſpot of ground; except a few which are tranſplanted 
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:1252700301:352"/> into the Parliament Houſe. Their whole life is hurried
away in ſcampering after foxes, leaping five-bar gates, trampling upon the
farmers corn, and ſwilling October. As they are by their profeſſion
excellent markſmen, and have been uſed to carry a gun, they might employ
their powder to more purpoſe in fetching down a Frenchman than a pheaſant:
and moſt of them might be incorporated among Cavalry, or formed into
light-bodied troops, and mounted on their own Hunters. They might alſo be of
great uſe in maroding or getting in forage; and if they would follow an enemy
with the ſame alacrity and defiance of danger, as a fox, they might do great
execution in a purſuit. The greateſt danger would be, that if a fox
ſhould perchance croſs them in their march, they would be tempted to run
from their colours for the ſake of a chace; and we ſhould have them all
deſert, or (in the language of fox-hunters) <hi>gone away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IF the country is infeſted with theſe uſeleſs and
obnoxious animals, called Squires, this metropolis is no leſs over-run with a
ſet of idle and miſchievous creatures, which we may call Town Squires. We
might ſoon levy a very numerous army, were we to enliſt into it every
vagrant about town, who, not having any lawful calling, from thence takes upon
himſelf the title of gentleman, and adds an <hi>Eſquire</hi> to his name. A
very large <hi>corps</hi> too might be formed from the Students at the Inns of
Court, who under the pretence of following the law, receive, as it were, a
ſanction for doing nothing at all. With theſe the ſeveral tribes of
play-houſe and coffee-houſe Critics, and that collective body of them,
called the TOWN, may be allowed to rank: And though no great exploits can be
expected from theſe <hi>Invalids,</hi> yet (as they are of no other uſe
whatever) they may at leaſt ſerve in the army, like <hi>Falſtaff</hi>'s
men, as 
<q rend="inline">"food for powder."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="346" facs="tcp:1252700301:353"/>BUT a very formidable troop might be
compoſed of that part of them, diſtinguiſhed by the name of Bloods. The
fury of their aſſaults on drawers and watchmen, and the ſpirit
diſplayed in ſtorming a bagnio, would be of infinite ſervice in the field
of battle. But I would recommend it to the General, to have them ſtrictly
diſciplined; leſt they ſhould ſhoot ſome of their own comrades, or
perhaps run away, merely for the ſake of the joke. Under proper regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations
ſuch valiant gentlemen would certainly be of uſe. I had lately ſome
thoughts of recommending to the Juſtices, to liſt the Bloods among thoſe
brave, reſolute fellows em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed as Thief-takers. But they may now ſerve
nobler purpoſes in the army: And what may we not expect from ſuch intrepid
heroes, who for want of opportunity to exert their proweſs in warlike
ſkirmiſhes abroad, have been obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to vent their courage by breaking the
peace at home?</p>
               <p>EVERY one will agree with me, that thoſe Men of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, who
make fighting their buſineſs, and cannot let their ſwords reſt quietly
in their ſcabbards, ſhould be obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to draw them in the ſervice of His
Majeſty. What might we not expect from theſe furious
<hi>Drawcanſirs,</hi> if, inſtead of cutting one another's throats, their
ſkill in arms was properly turned againſt the enemy. A very little
diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline would make them admirable ſoldiers: for (as <hi>Mercutio</hi>
ſays) they are already 
<q rend="inline">"the very butchers of a ſilk button."</q> I
have known one of theſe Duelliſts, to keep his hand in, employ himſelf
every morning in thruſting at a bit of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſtuck againſt the
wainſcoat; and I have heard another boaſt, that he could ſnuff a candle
with his piſtol. Theſe gentlemen are, therefore, very fit to be employed in
cloſe engagements: But it will be neceſſary to keep them in continual
action; for otherwiſe they would breed a kind of <pb n="347" facs="tcp:1252700301:354"/> civil
war amongſt themſelves, and, rather than not fight at all, turn their
weapons upon one another.</p>
               <p>SEVERAL <hi>Iriſh</hi> Brigades, not inferior to thoſe of
the ſame country in the Service of the <hi>French</hi> King, may be formed
out of thoſe able bodied men, which are called Fortune-Hunters. The attacks
of theſe dauntleſs heroes have, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, been chiefly levelled at the other
ſex: but employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be found for theſe amourous knight-errants,
ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their known firmneſs and intrepidity; particularly in taking
places by ſtorm, where there is a neceſſity for raviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing virgins, and
committing outrages upon the women.</p>
               <p>But among the many uſeleſs members of ſociety, there are
none ſo unprofitable as the fraternity of Gameſters. I therefore, think
that their time would be much better em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in handling a muſquet, than in
ſhuffling a pack of cards or ſhaking the dice-box. As to the Sharpers, it
is a pity that the ſame dexterity, which enables them to palm an ace or cog a
die, is not uſed by them in going through the manual exerciſe in the
military way. Theſe latter might, indeed, be employed as marines, and
ſtationed in the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi>; as many of them have already croſt
the ſeas, and are perfectly well acquainted with the Plantations.</p>
               <p>THE laſt propoſal which I have to make on this ſubject, is
to take the whole body of Feeethinkers into the ſervice. For this purpoſe I
would impreſs all the members of the <hi>Robin-Hood</hi> Society; and in
conſideration of his great merit, I would adviſe, that the
<hi>Clare-Market</hi> Orator ſhould be made chaplain to the regiment. One of
the favourite tenets of a Freethinker is, that all men are in a natural ſtate
of warfare with each other: nothing therefore is ſo proper 
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:1252700301:355"/> for him, as to be actually engaged in war. As he has no
ſqueamiſh notions about what will become of him hereafter, he can have no
fears about death: I would, therefore, always have the Freethinkers put upon
the moſt dangerous exploits, expoſed to the greateſt heat of battle, and
ſent upon the Forlorn Hope. For, ſince they confeſs that they are born
into the world for no end whatever, and that they will be nothing after death,
it is but juſtice that they ſhould be <hi>annihilated</hi> for the good of
their country.</p>

ſeveral branches of magic made uſe of in the affairs of love. I have
my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf been very lately among the Seeers of Viſions and Dreamers of
Dreams: and hope you will not be diſpleaſed at an account of portents and
prognoſtics full as extravagant, though they are not all owing to the ſame
cauſe, as thoſe of your correſpondent Miſs <hi>Arabella Whimſey.</hi>
You muſt know, Couſin, that I am juſt returned from a viſit of a
fortnight to an old aunt <pb n="350" facs="tcp:1252700301:357"/> in the North; where I was
mightily diverted with the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional ſuperſtitions, which are moſt
religiouſly preſerved in the family, as they have been delivered down, time
out of mind, from their ſagacious grandmothers.</p>
                     <p>WHEN I arrived, I found the miſtreſs of the houſe very
buſily employed with her two daughters in nailing an horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhoe to the
threſhold of the door. This they told me, was to guard againſt the
ſpiteful deſigns of an old woman, who was a witch, and had threatened to do
the family a miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, becauſe one of my young couſins laid two ſtraws
acroſs, to ſee if the old hag could walk over them. The young lady
herſelf aſſured me, that ſhe had ſeveral times heard Goody
<hi>Cripple</hi> muttering to herſelf; and to be ſure ſhe was ſaying
the Lord's Prayer backwards. Beſides, the old woman had very often aſked
them for a pin: but they took care never to give her any thing that was
ſharp, becauſe ſhe ſhould not bewitch them. They afterwards told me
many other particulars of this kind, the ſame as are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, with
infinite humour by the SPECTATOR: and to confirm them, they aſſured me,
that the eldeſt Miſs, when ſhe was little, uſed to have fits, till the
mother flung a knife at another old witch, (whom the devil had carried off in a
high wind) and fetched blood from her.</p>
                     <p>WHEN I was to go to bed, my aunt made a thouſand apologies
for not putting me in the beſt room in the houſe, which ſhe ſaid had
never been lain in, ſince the death of an old waſher-woman, who walked
every night, and haunted that room in particular. They fancied that the old
woman had hid money ſomewhere, and could not reſt till ſhe had told
ſomebody; and my couſin aſſured me, that ſhe might have had it all to
herſelf, for the ſpirit came one night to her bed-ſide, and wanted to
tell her, but ſhe had not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage <pb n="351" facs="tcp:1252700301:358"/> to ſpeak to it. I
learned alſo that they had a footman once, who hanged himſelf for love; and
he walked for a great while, till they got the parſon to lay him in the Red
Sea.</p>
                     <p>I HAD not been here long, when an accident happened, which
very much alarmed the whole family. <hi>Towzer</hi> one night howled moſt
terribly; which was a ſure ſign, that ſomebody belonging to them would
die. The youngeſt Miſs declared that ſhe had heard the hen crow that
morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; which was another fatal prognoſtic. They told me, that juſt
before uncle died, <hi>Towzer</hi> howled ſo for ſeveral nights together,
that they could not quiet him; and my aunt heard the death-watch tick as
plainly as if there had been a clock in the room: the maid too, who ſat up
with him, heard a bell toll at the top of the ſtairs, the very moment the
breath went out of his body. During this diſcourſe, I overheard one of my
couſins whiſper the other, that ſhe was afraid their mamma would not live
long; for ſhe ſmelt an ugly ſmell, like a dead body. They had a
dairy-maid, who died the very week after an hearſe had ſtopt at their door
in its way to church; and the eldeſt miſs, when ſhe was but thirteen,
ſaw her own brother's ghoſt, (who was gone the <hi>Weſt-Indies)</hi>
walking in the garden; and to be ſure nine months after, they had an account,
that he died on board the ſhip, the very ſame day, and hour of the day,
that Miſs ſaw his apparition.</p>
                     <p>I NEED not mention to you the common incidents, which were
accounted by them no leſs prophetic. If a cinder popped from the fire, they
were in haſte to examine whether it was a purſe or a coffin. They were
aware of my arrival long before I came, becauſe they had ſeen a ſtranger
on the grate. The youngeſt Miſs will let nobody <pb n="352" facs="tcp:1252700301:359"/>
uſe the poker but herſelf; becauſe, when ſhe ſtirs it, it always
burns bright, which is a ſign ſhe will have a bright huſband: and ſhe
is no leſs ſure of a good one, becauſe ſhe generally has ill luck at
cards. Nor is the candle leſs ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular than the fire: for the ſquire of
the pariſh came one night to pay them a viſit, when the tallow
winding-ſheet pointed towards him, and he broke his neck ſoon after in a
fox-chaſe. My aunt one night obſerved with great pleaſure a letter in the
candle; and ſhe hoped it would be from her ſon in <hi>London.</hi> We knew,
when a ſpirit was in the room, by the candle burning blue: but poor couſin
<hi>Nancy</hi> was ready to cry one time, when ſhe ſnuffed it out and could
not blow it in again, though her ſiſter did it at a whiff.</p>
                     <p>WE had no occaſion for an almanack or the weather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glaſs,
to let us know whether it would rain or ſhine. One evening I propoſed to
ride out with my couſins the next day to ſee a gentleman's houſe in the
neigbourhood; but my aunt aſſured us it would be wet, ſhe knew very well
from the ſhooting of her corn. Beſides, there was a great ſpider crawling
up the chimney, and the blackbird in the kitchen began to ſing: which were
both of them as certain forerunners of rain. But the moſt to be depended on
in theſe caſes is a tabby cat, which is uſually baſking on the parlour
hearth. If the cat turned her tail to the fire, we were to have a hard froſt:
if ſhe licked her tail, rain would certainly enſue. They wondered what
ſtranger they ſhould ſee; becauſe Puſs waſhed her foot over her
left ear. The old lady complained of a cold, and her daughter remarked, it
would go through the family; for ſhe obſerved that poor <hi>Tab</hi> had
ſneezed ſeveral times. Poor <hi>Tab</hi> however once flew at one of my
couſins; for which ſhe had like to have been deſtroyed, as the whole
family began to think ſhe was no other than a witch.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="353" facs="tcp:1252700301:360"/>IT is impoſſible to tell you the
ſeveral tokens, by which they know whether good or ill luck will happen to
them. Spilling of ſalt, or laying knives acroſs, are every where ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted
ill omens; but a pin with the head turned towards you, or to be followed by a
ſtrange dog, I found were very lucky. I heard one of my couſins tell the
cookmaid, that ſhe boiled away all her ſweethearts, becauſe ſhe had let
her diſhwater boil over. The ſame young lady one morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing came down to
breakfaſt with her cap the wrong ſide out; which the mother obſerving,
charged her not to alter it all the day, for fear ſhe ſhould turn luck.</p>
                     <p>BUT, above all, I could not help remarking the various
prognoſtics, which the old lady and her daughters uſed to collect from
almoſt every part of the body. A white ſpeck upon the nails made them as
ſure of a gift, as if they had it already in their pockets. The eldeſt
ſiſter is to have one huſband more than the youngeſt, becauſe ſhe
has one wrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kle more in her forehead; but the other will have the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
of her in the number of children, as was plainly proved by ſnapping their
finger-joints. It would take up too much room, to ſet down every
circumſtance which I obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of this ſort during my ſtay with them: I
ſhall therefore conclude my letter with the ſeveral remarks on the reſt
of the body, as far as I could learn them from this prophetic family: for as I
was a relation, you know, they had leſs reſerve.</p>
                     <p>IF the head itches, it is a ſign of rain. If the head aches,
it is a profitable pain. If you have the tooth-ach, you don't love true. If
your eye-brow itches, you will ſee a ſtranger. If your right eye itches,
you will cry; if your left you will laugh. If your noſe itches, you will
ſhake hands, kiſs a fool, drink a glaſs of wine, run againſt a 
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:1252700301:361"/> cuckold's door, or miſs them all four. If your right
ear or cheek burns, your left friends are talking of you; if your left, your
right friends are talking of you. If your elbow itches, you will change your
bedfellow. If your right hand itches, you will pay away money; if your left,
you will receive. If your ſtomach itches, you will eat pudding. If your
gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering-place itches, you will go to a ſtrange place. If your back itches,
butter will be cheap when graſs grows there. If your ſide itches,
ſomebody is wiſhing for you. If your knee itches, you will kneel in a
ſtrange church: If your foot, you will tread upon ſtrange ground. Laſtly,
if you ſhiver, ſome body is walking over your grave.</p>

confeſs! It is now paſt four o'clock; and you and your companions have been
making ſuch a racket here, all ſober people muſt cry out ſhame upon
you. I wonder what pleaſure it can be for fifty or an hundred perſons to
meet together and employ the whole night at Cribbage, Brag, and Whiſt. For my
part, I am ſure I had rather live in an <pb n="356" facs="tcp:1252700301:363"/> herb-cellar,
and entertain waſherwomen over their half-quarterns of bohea with a glaſs
of gin between every cup, than lead ſuch an irregular life as you do.</p>

                              <p>And I, Madam, had rather live in a filthy ale-houſe,
and be poiſoned with the greaſy cards of porters and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, than lead
ſuch an inſipid life as you do. You are, indeed, the delight of city-wives

                              <p>Madam, if the truth was known, you have no reaſon to
boaſt much of your company. Is it not notorious that you entertain the very
worſt of people? People that want common honeſty, cheats of Quality, and
Right Honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſharpers. Who had you this night with you?—There was
my Lord —, and Lady —, and Sir <hi>John —.</hi> Theſe,
Indeed, are your perſons of the firſt rank and faſhion: but, to ſpeak
the truth, they are no better than pick-pockets.</p>

your ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent for ſcandal has always been remarkable. But pray, Madam, ſince
you talk of company, what ſort of people are your particular cronies? You are
pleaſed to upbraid me with conniving at ſharpers: and I am ſure you
aſſociate with vile pimps and go-betweens. Who are they that uſually
compoſe your morning-levee? A milliner perhaps, or a mantua-maker, or a
<hi>French</hi> hair-cutter: and theſe ſort of gentry, you muſt own, are
very commode in carrying on other buſineſs beſides what they profeſs.
Nay did not <pb n="357" facs="tcp:1252700301:364"/> you admit Captain — the other morning

obliged to you, Madam. The <hi>Debt of Honour,</hi> as you call it, in which
you had involved her ladyſhip over night, they thought fit to cancel the next

ſo much frequented your company, many of them have been firſt cheated of

                              <p>If they had not been very common, and taken out of a

more illiterate than your friends and acquaintance? <hi>Hoyle</hi>'s Treatiſe
on Whiſt is almoſt the only book they have ever read: and as the mind of
man, before it has received any ideas, has been compared to a white ſheet of

                              <p>To be ſure, Madam, I muſt acknowledge your
ſuperior underſtanding; you have ſuch prodigious opportunities of
improving yourſelf! Can any thing, for inſtance, be ſo plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant and
inſtructive as your chit-chats and goſſipings with the good city-wives
over their <hi>diſturbed</hi> tea and a huge plate of bread and butter!</p>

                              <p>But can any thing be ſo inſipid (to ſay no
worſe of it) as the polite jargon, which makes up the whole of your
converſation over a pack of cards! In this, indeed, you put thoſe of the
higheſt rank and ſenſe upon a level with the loweſt and moſt ignorant
of the vulgar; for gameſters have the ſame language whether in an
alehouſe or a draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-room: and I would as ſoon liſten to a ſet of
draymen ſquabbling about their half-pence at All-Fours and One-and-Thirty, as
to the club at <hi>White</hi>'s wrangling for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. The talk of either
party is altogether confined to their different games; and if the genteel
gameſter, upon every turn of the cards againſt him, damns himſelf with a
good grace, the drayman bluntly pours out a volley of the ſame oaths. But I
ſhould not ſo much quarrel with you for having ſeduced the men, if you
had not ſo ſtrangely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatuated the ladies, who ſeem more particularly
deſigned for my company. I am now looked upon as a mere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance; and
they think every moment that is loſt upon me, very tedious, while it detains
them from your refined pleaſures. The women of this country uſed to be
admired for their virtues as well as their beauty: but ſince you have
engroſſed ſo much of their time and thoughts, at the ſame time that you
have ſpoiled their faces, you have corrupted their morals.</p>

                              <p>I know you make a jeſt of morality; and every other
conſideration gives way, when once the love of play is predominant. For
example;—What an alteration have you made in the lady of this houſe? I
uſed to ſee her every morning as blooming as a roſe; nor had ſhe any
need of paint to repair the damages you have ſince done her, by keeping her
up all night. At preſent I am ſeldom admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her before the afternoon;
and till ſhe has new dreſſed her face, ſhe appears as hagged and as
frightful as your <hi>Queen of Clubs.</hi> Before ſhe fell into your company
ſhe had proper notions of virtue; but you ſoon reduced her to the
neceſſity of parting with both her honour and honeſty. In ſhort, ſhe
now is—what I don't chuſe to call her.</p>

diſregard to every thing ſacred. They particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly take a pride in
violating the Sabbath; and your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany is the more acceptable among people of

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is obſerved by the <hi>French</hi> that a Cat, a Prieſt,
and an Old Woman are ſufficient to conſtitute a religious Sect in
<hi>England.</hi> So univerſally it ſeems, are learning and genius
diffuſed through this iſland, that the loweſt plebeians are deep
caſuiſts in matters of faith as well as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics: and ſo many and
wonderful are the new lights con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually breaking in upon us, that we daily
make freſh diſcoveries, and ſtrike out unbeaten paths to future
hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. The above obſervation of our neighbours is in truth rather too
full: for a prieſt is ſo far from neceſſary, that a new ſpecies of
doctrine would be better received by our old women, and other well diſpoſed
good people, from a layman. The moſt extraordinary tenets of religion are
very ſuccesfully propagated under the ſanction of the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern apron
inſtead of the caſſock: Every corner of the town has a barber, maſon,
bricklayer, or ſome other handi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craft <pb n="362" facs="tcp:1252700301:369"/> teacher: and
there are almoſt as many ſects in this metropolis as there are pariſh
churches.</p>
               <p>AS to the Old Women, ſince the paſſions of females are
ſtronger in youth, and their minds weaker in age, than thoſe of the other
ſex, their readineſs in embracing any principles of religion preſſed on
them with particular earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and vehemence, is not very wonderful.
They hope, by the moſt rigid demeanor in the decline of life, to make amends
for that unbounded looſe given to their paſſions in their younger years.
The ſame violence however, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accompanies them in religion, as
formerly actuated them in their pleaſures; and their zeal entirely eats up
their charity. They look with a malevolent kind of pity on all who are ſtill
employed in <hi>worldly</hi> undertakings, 
<q rend="inline">"carry prayer books in their pockets,"</q> and
piouſly damn all their relations and acquaintance with texts of ſcripture.
I know an old gentlewoman of this caſt who has formed herſelf as a pattern
of ſtaid behaviour, and values herſelf for having given up at threeſcore
the vanities of ſixteen. She denounces heavy judgments on all frequenters of
public diverſions, and forebodes the worſt conſequences from every party
of pleaſure. I have known her foretell the ruin of her niece from a country
dance: nay, ſhe can perceive irregular deſires flaming from a gay coloured
topknot, and has even deſcried adultery itſelf lurking beneath the thin
veil of a worked apron, or beaming from a diamond girdle-buckle.</p>
               <p>BUT we might perhaps ſuffer a few good Old Ladies to go to
heaven their own way, if theſe Sects were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious on many other
accounts. Such ſtrange doctrines are wonderfully apt to unſettle the minds
of the common people, who often make an odd tranſition from infidelity to
enthuſiaſm, and become bigots from arrant freethinkers: Their faith
however, it may be well imagined, is not a ſaving faith; as they are worked
up to an adoration of the CREATOR, from the ſame ſlaviſh principle that
induces <pb n="363" facs="tcp:1252700301:370"/> the <hi>Indians</hi> to worſhip the Devil. It
is amazing how ſtrongly fear operates on theſe weak creatures, and how
eaſily a canting, whining raſcal can mould them to his purpoſe. I have
known many a rich tradeſman wheedled and threatned out of his
ſubſiſtence, and himſelf and unhappy family at laſt lectured into the
work-houſe. Thus do theſe vile hypocrites turn a poor convert's head to
ſave his ſoul; and deprive him of all happineſs in this world, under
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſecuring it to him eternally in the next.</p>
               <p>NOTHING can do religion more injury than theſe ſolemn
mockeries of it. Many of theſe Sects conſiſt almoſt entirely of
battered proſtitutes, and perſons of the moſt infamous character.
Reformation is their chief pretence; wherefore the more abandoned thoſe are
of whom they make proſelytes, the more they pride themſelves on their
converſion. I remember a debauched young fellow, who pretended a ſudden
amendment of his principles, in order to repair his ſhattered fortune. He
turned Methodiſt, and ſoon began to manifeſt a kind of ſpiritual
fondneſs for a pious ſiſter. He wooed her according to the directions of
the rubric, ſent her ſermons inſtead of billet-doux, 
<q rend="inline">"greeted her with a holy kiſs,"</q> and
obtained his miſtreſs by appearing in every reſpect a thorough devotee.
But alas! the good gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman could never be prevailed on to comply with
religious ordinances, or appear any more at church or meeting, after the
performance of the marriage-ceremony. The loweſt of the vulgar alſo, for
their peculiar ends, frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſectaries. They avail themſelves of
a mock conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to redeem their loſt characters, and, like criminals at
<hi>Rome,</hi> make the church a ſanctuary for villainy. By this artifice
they recommend themſelves to the charity of weak but well-meaning
Chriſtians, and often inſinuate themſelves as ſervants into Methodiſt
families.</p>
               <p>LE SAGE, with his uſual humour, repreſents <hi>Gil Blas</hi>
as wonderfully charmed with the ſeeming ſanctity of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broſe de
Lamela,</hi> when he took him into his ſervice: and <pb n="364" facs="tcp:1252700301:371"/>
                  <hi>Gil Blas</hi> is even not offended at his remiſſneſs the very firſt
night, when his new ſervant tells him that it was owing to his attending his
devotions. But it ſoon appears that this ſly valet had been employed in
concerting the robbery of his maſter. A due attention to religion is ſo
rare a quality in all ranks of people, that I am far from blaming it in
ſervants; but when I ſee their religion ſhewing itſelf in lazineſs,
and obſerve them neglecting their common bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs under the pretext of
performing acts of ſupererogation, I am apt to queſtion their ſincerity,
and to take every ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of that kind for a mere Saint <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>
An old <hi>Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> aunt of mine, of whom I have formerly made worthy
mention, would never have any ſervants, who did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the ſociety
of the United Brethren. But ſo little did the good lady's endeavours to
preſerve good order and a ſpirit of devotion in her houſe ſucceed; that
the generality of the men fell into evil courſes, and moſt of the pious
ſiſterhood left the family with big bellies.</p>
               <p>I WOULD not be thought to deny my fellow-ſubjects full liberty
of conſcience, and all the benefits of the Toleration-Act; yet I cannot help
regarding theſe weak, if not ill-meant diviſions from the eſtabliſhed
church as a dangerous kind of Freethinking: not ſo ſhocking indeed as the
impious avowal of atheiſm and infidelity, but often attended with the ſame
bad conſequences. A religion founded on mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and enthuſiaſm, is
almoſt as bad as no religion at all; and what is worſt, the unhappy errors
of particular ſects expoſe the pureſt religion in the world to the
ſcoffs of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believers. Shallow witlings exerciſe their little talents for
ridicule on matters of religion, and fall into atheiſm and blaſphemy in
order to avoid bigotry and enthuſiaſm. The weakneſs of the ſectaries
ſtrengthen them in their ridiculous notions, and produce many other evils, as
will appear from the following ſhort hiſtory.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="365" facs="tcp:1252700301:372"/>IN the glorious reign of Queen
<hi>Elizabeth</hi> there reſided in theſe kingdoms a worthy lady called
RELIGION. She was remarkable for the ſweetneſs of her temper; which was
chearful without levity, and grave without moroſeneſs. She was alſo
particularly decent in her dreſs as well as behaviour, and preſerved with
uncommon mildneſs the ſtricteſt regularity in her family. Though ſhe
had a noble genius, and led a very ſober life, yet in thoſe days ſhe kept
the beſt company, was greatly admired by the Queen, and was even intimate
with moſt of the maids of honour. What became of her and her family is not
known, but it is very certain that they have at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent no connection with
the polite world. Some affirm that the line is extinct; though I have indeed
been told that the late Biſhop <hi>Berkley</hi> and the preſent Biſhops
of — and — de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from principal branches of it, and that
ſome few of the ſame family are reſident on ſmall livings in the
country.</p>
               <p>WE are told by a certain faſhionable author, that there were
formerly two men in a madhouſe at <hi>Paris,</hi> one of whom imagined
himſelf <hi>The</hi> FATHER, and the other <hi>The</hi> SON. In like manner,
no ſooner did the good lady RELIGION diſappear, but ſhe was perſonated
by a crazy old beldam called SUPER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STITION. But the cheat was inſtantly
diſcovered; for inſtead of the mild diſcipline with which her
predeceſſor ruled her family, ſhe governed entirely by ſeverity, racks,
wheels, gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bets, ſword, fire and faggot. Inſtead of chearfulneſs ſhe
introduced gloom, was perpetually croſſing herſelf with holy water, and,
to avert the terrible judgments of which ſhe was hourly in fear, ſhe
compiled a new almanack, in which ſhe wonderfully multiplied the number of
red letters. After a miſerable life ſhe died melancholy-mad, but left a

hoſpital for religious lunatics; which I am informed, will ſpeedily be
built on the ſame ground, where the Foundery, the celebrated Methodiſt
meeting-houſe, now ſtands.</p>

abandoned fellow. He came very early upon town, and was a remarkable Blood.
Among his other frolicks he turned author, and is ſaid to have written in
concert with Lord <hi>Bolingbroke.</hi> After having ſquandered a large
fortune, he turned gameſter, then pimp, and then highwayman; in which laſt
occupation he was ſoon detected, taken, and thrown into <hi>Newgate.</hi> He
behaved very impudently in the Condemned Hole, abuſed the Ordinary whenever
that gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman attended him, and encouraged all his fellow priſoners, in the
<hi>Newgate</hi> phraſe, to die hard. When he came to the gallows, inſtead
of the pſalm he ſung a bawdy catch, threw away the book, and bid <hi>Jack
Ketch</hi> tuck him up like a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. Many of his relations were preſent

unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly occaſioned by a Motion that was made by Miſs
<hi>Graveairs.</hi> This Committee had long been looked upon as uſeleſs,
but for form ſake continued to meet, though it was adjourned immediately: but
one day, there being more members preſent than uſual, the Chair-woman was
no ſooner in the Chair, than the lady above-mentioned addreſſed her in

                           <p>IT is with no leſs ſurpriſe than concern, that I reflect
on the danger to which the greater part of my ſex, either through ignorance
or choice, are now expoſed; and <pb n="368" facs="tcp:1252700301:375"/> I have the
ſtrongeſt reaſons to believe, that nothing but the vigorous and timely
Reſolutions of this wiſe Aſſembly can prevent them from changing their
religion, and becoming ROMAN CATHOLICS. What ſubject can be more
intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and important to Us, whether we conſider ourſelves as a
Committee of Religion, a Parliament of Women, or an Aſſembly of
Proteſtants? Was ſuch a deſign to be carried into execution, the free
uſe of our tongues would be taken away; we ſhould never be ſuffered
perhaps to ſpeak to the other ſex but through grates and bars, and this
place of our Aſſembly would be probably the abode of Nuns and Fryars. But
leaſt you ſhould think me thus alarmed without reaſon, I ſhall now lay
before you the grounds of my complaint; that, if it is not too late we may
correct the evil, or if it is we may guard againſt it.</p>
                           <p>MY fears are grounded on thoſe remarks, that have long been
made on the Dreſs of the ſex. Conſtant as the men have ſtiled us to the
love of change, little have they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, that Popery was invariably the
object to which every innovation was deſigned to lead. So long ago as when,
to the honour of our ſex, a Queen was upon the throne, it was the faſhion,
as we may learn from <hi>Pope,</hi> for the ladies to wear upon their breaſts
a flaming CROSS. The ſame faſhion has been tranſmitted to the preſent
times. What, Madam, is this but downright Popery? In the Catholic countries
they are contented with erecting Crucifixes in their roads and churches; but
alas! in this Proteſtant kingdom Croſſes are alike to be ſeen in places
ſacred and profane, the court, the playhouſe, and (pardon me ladies!) this
venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Aſſembly itſelf is not without them. I am apt to ſuſpect,
that this heterodox introduction of the Croſs into the female dreſs had an
higher original, than the days of Queen <hi>Ann,</hi> 
                              <pb n="369" facs="tcp:1252700301:376"/>
whoſe affection for the Church, was very well known. It ſeems rather to
have been imported among us, together with the <hi>Jeſuits,</hi> by the
Popiſh Conſorts of the firſt or ſecond <hi>Charles</hi>: or perhaps the
ladies firſt wore it in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pope
<hi>Joan,</hi> Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> This much is certain, that at the ſame
time our pious Reformer Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> expelled the Croſs from our
altars, ſhe effectually ſecured the necks of our ladies from this
ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition by the introduction of the Ruff.</p>
                           <p>THE next part of our dreſs that I ſhall mention, which
favours of Popery, is the CAPUCHIN. This garment in truth has a near
reſemblance to that of the Fryar, whoſe name it bears. Our grandmothers had
already adopted the HOOD, their daughters by a gradual advance introduced the
reſt, but far greater improvements were ſtill in ſtore for Us. We all of
us remember, for it is not above two years ago, how all colours were neglected
for that of PURPLE. In Purple we glowed from the hat to the ſhoe, and in
ſuch requeſt were the ribbons and ſilks of that favourite colour, that
neither the milliner, mercer, nor dyer himſelf could anſwer the demand. Who
but muſt think that this aroſe from Popiſh principles? and though it may
be urged that the admired <hi>Fanny,</hi> who firſt introduced it, is no Nun,
yet you may all remember that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> herſelf has been
ſtyled, The SCARLET, or as ſome render it, The PURPLE WHORE.</p>
                           <p>BUT to prove indiſputably our manifeſt approaches to
Popery, let me now refer you to that faſhionable cloak, which, ſorry I am
to ſee it, is wore by the far greater part even of this Aſſembly, and
which indeed is with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety ſtyled, <hi>The</hi> CARDINAL. For were
his Holineſs the Pope to be introduced among us, he would almoſt fancy 
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:1252700301:377"/> himſelf in his own Conclave: and were I not too well
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my ſiſters principles, I myſelf ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to
think, that to thoſe in ſuch grave attire nothing but a cloyſter and a
grate was wanting. As to thoſe of gayer colours, you need not be told, that
there are White and Grey Fryars abroad as well as Black: and as the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> are ſo remarkable for improving on their originals, we
ſhall not be then ſurprized at the variety of colours that appears among
us.</p>
                           <p>IT has been whiſpered too, that ſome of my ſiſters
have been ſo fond of the Monkiſh auſterities, as to have their heads
ſhaved. This I do not aver of my own knowledge; but, if it is ſo, they
ſtill condeſcend to wear artificial locks, though it would not be at all
ſtrange, if they alſo ſhould ſoon be laid aſide, as they are already
prepared for it by leaving off their caps. I ſhall only deſire you ſtill
farther to reflect, how faſhionable it is for the ladies to ſhine with
borrowed faces; and then I believe you will readily allow, that their votaries,
the men, are in great danger alſo of being ſeduced to Popery; ſince do
they not already, by the compliments they pay to a painted face, addreſs an
<hi>Image</hi> and adore a <hi>Picture?</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>WHAT has now been ſaid will induce you, I hope, to pay a
proper regard to the following Reſolutions, which, I humbly move, may be
agreed to by this Committee, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to the Houſe.</p>

               <p>THIS Motion was ſtrongly ſeconded by Lady <hi>Mend'em,</hi>
who urged in its ſupport, that to her certain knowledge many of the ſex
very frequently aſſembled at one anothers houſes (and particularly on the
Sabbath) where Maſs Books were actually laid before them, and the warmeſt
adoration paid to ſoome ſmall Pictures or painted Images, which ſhe was
told, reſembled ſome Kings and Queens that had been long canonized. And the
Offerings that were conſtantly made at their Shrines would (ſhe ſaid) be
found on a moderate computation, to exceed thoſe that were formerly made at
the tomb of <hi>Thomas à Becket.</hi> She added, that after the Catholic
cuſtom they always faſted on thoſe nights, or if they ſupt at all it
was only on FISH.</p>
               <p>THE chief ſpeaker on the other ſide of the queſtion was
Lady <hi>Smart,</hi> one of the repreſentatives for
<hi>Groſvenor-Square,</hi> who by the way was ſtrongly ſuſpected of
being a preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced perſon, her enemies not denying that ſhe had charms,
which could almoſt ſanctify error itſelf. Nobody, ſhe ſaid, could
ſuſpect the ſex of inclining to Popery, who obſerved the averſion
they all diſcovered to a ſingle life. The <pb n="372" facs="tcp:1252700301:379"/> uſes of
the obnoxious garments were allowed to be many; the names at leaſt were
innocent; and the cry againſt them, ſhe was ſure, could only be raiſed
by the old and the ugly; ſince nothing could be ſo fantaſtic, as not to
become a pretty woman.</p>
               <p>HER ladyſhip was joined by the Beauties preſent; but they
being few, their objections were over-ruled, and the Motion was carried. The
next day the Houſe, on receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the report, after ſome debate agreed to
the Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and a Bill was ordered to be prepared and brought in
accordingly. Though at the ſame time they were of opinion, <hi>Nem. Con.</hi>
that if the FIG-LEAF BILL took place, theſe reſtrictions would be quite

                        <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F you are a true ſportſman, and have the honour of the
Turf at heart, you muſt have obſerved with the utmoſt concern a late
account in the news-papers, that WHITE-NOSE died at <hi>Doncaſter</hi> of a
mortification in his foot. An article of this nature, and at ſuch a time,
muſt ſtrike a damp on all gentlemen breeders; and for my part I cannot help
looking on the preſent races at <hi>New-Market,</hi> as funeral games in
honour of the memory of WHITE-NOSE. The death of a ſtallion of ſuch
conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is a public calamity to all knowing ones in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: nor
does ſuch an accident bring with it the leaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; 
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:1252700301:381"/> eſpecially ſince it is not the faſhion to
<hi>pit</hi> the lives of horſes, as well as men, againſt each other.</p>
                     <p>ITALIAN grey-hounds, Dutch lap-dogs, monkeys, and maccaws,
have been honoured with monuments and epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphs: But a race-horſe as much
ſurpaſſes theſe inſignificant animals, as WHITE-NOSE was ſuperior
to a pack-horſe: and I cannot but think, that an obeliſk (with a proper
inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion drawn up by Meſſieurs <hi>Heber</hi> and <hi>Pond)</hi>
ſhould be erected near the <hi>Devil's Ditch,</hi> or <hi>Choak-Jade,</hi> on
<hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>market Heath,</hi> in honour of his memory. With what rapture might we
then read of his <hi>powerful deep rate,</hi> by which all the horſes that
ran againſt him were <hi>no-where</hi>; of his rapid victories in the field,
(more ſurprizing than thoſe of the Duke of <hi>Marlborough,)</hi> by which
he WON <hi>Tewkſbury,</hi> WON <hi>Chipping-Norton,</hi> WON
<hi>Lincoln,</hi> WON <hi>York,</hi> &amp;c. But, above all, we ſhould admire
the noble BLOOD which flowed in his veins, and with reverence contemplate the
illuſtrious names of his great, great, great, great, great grandſires and
grandams. There is not the leaſt <hi>flaw</hi> in the BLOOD of WHITE-NOSE's
family: and his epitaph might conclude, in imitation of that famous one on the
Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>'s monument, 
<q rend="inline">"that all the Sons were remarkable Stallions,
and all the Daughters excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Breeders."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>THE pedigrees of our race-horſes have been always
preſerved with as much care and exactneſs, as the Tree of Deſcent among
the family of a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> grandee or <hi>Poliſh</hi> nobleman: nor
does the <hi>Welchman</hi> derive greater honour from proving himſelf the
fiftieth couſin to <hi>Cadwallader</hi> or <hi>Caractacus,</hi> through a
long line of <hi>David Ap Shenkins, Ap Morgans, Ap Powells, Ap Prices,</hi>
than the horſe by being <pb n="375" facs="tcp:1252700301:382"/> half brother to the
<hi>Godolphin Barb,</hi> or full couſin by the dam's ſide to the <hi>Bloody
Shoulder'd Arabian.</hi> The <hi>Romans</hi> were no leſs curious in the
breed of their horſes, and paid the greateſt honours to thoſe that beat
the whole <hi>Circus hollow.</hi> They even erectred monuments to their memory,
of which <hi>Lipſuis</hi> gives us the following remarkable inſtance.
<hi>Clariſſimè lapis vetus, quem Romae olim vidi et exſcripſi.
In medio vir eſt, qui dextrâ baculum, ſiniſtrâ pabulum tenet:
extrinſecus duo ſunt aſſilientes equi cum geminâ

itaque ipſum hìc</hi> HIRPINUM, <hi>atque adeo ejus avum</hi>
AQUILONEM. I could wiſh that the ſame honours were paid to our horſes: I
would at leaſt propoſe, that the the names, pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, and a liſt of the
plates won by victorious horſes ſhould be inſcribed on the poſts of all
courſes, where they have made themſelves famous. Theſe memorials might
ſerve to perpetuate the renown of our racers, and would furniſh poſterity
with a more complete hiſtory of the Turf than the <hi>Sportſman</hi>'s
<hi>Calendar.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>YOU will undoubtedly obſerve, Mr. TOWN, that in the extract
concerning horſes, with which I have juſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented you from
<hi>Lipſius,</hi> a man is alſo mentioned; the account of whom would, if
modernized, run in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms. 
<q rend="inline">"In the middle of the monument ſtood a man,
with a whip in his right hand, and a feed of corn in his left."</q> Hence it
appears, that the <hi>Romans</hi> intended to do honour to the charioteer as
well as the horſes; and it is a pity, that we do not alſo imitate them in
this particular, and pay equal reſpect to our Jockeys. <pb n="376" facs="tcp:1252700301:383"/>
The chariot-race was not more celebrated among the Ancients, than the
horſe-race is at preſent; and the <hi>Circus</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> never
drew together ſo noble an aſſembly as the modern courſe. Nor do I ſee
any reaſon, why <hi>Theron</hi> ſhould be more applauded for carrying off
the prize at <hi>Elis</hi> or <hi>Piſa,</hi> than <hi>Tom Marſhal</hi> for
winning the plate at <hi>York</hi> or <hi>Newmarket.</hi> The charioteers of
old were, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, compoſed of the greateſt princes, and perſons of the
firſt rank, who prided themſelves on their dexterity in managing the reins,
and driving their own chariots. In this they have been imitated by ſeveral of
our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern gentry, who value themſelves in being excellent coachmen. And it
is with infinite pleaſure, that I have lately obſerved perſons of
faſhion at all races affect the dreſs and manner of grooms. And as
gentlemen, like the ancient charioteers, begin to enter the race themſelves,
and ride their own horſes, it is probable that we ſhall ſoon ſee the
beſt jockeys among the firſt of our nobility.</p>
                     <p>THAT the encomiums of the horſe ſhould ſo frequently be
enlarged on, without entering into the praiſes of the Jockey, is indeed
ſomething wonderful; when we conſider how much the beaſt is under his
direction, and that the ſtrength and fleetneſs of <hi>Victorious</hi> or
<hi>Driver</hi> would be of no uſe without the ſkill and honeſty of the
rider. Large ſums have been loſt by a horſe running, accidentally without
doubt, on the wrong ſide of the poſt; and We Knowing Ones, Mr. TOWN, have
frequently ſeen great dexterity and management exerted, in contriving that
one of the beſt horſes in the field ſhould be diſtanced. The Joc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key
has indeed ſo great a ſhare in the ſucceſs of the race, 
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:1252700301:384"/> that every man, who has ever betted five pounds, is
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his conſequence, and does not want to be told, that the
victory depends at leaſt as often on the rider as the horſe.</p>
                     <p>I CANNOT help agreeing with Lady <hi>Pentweazle</hi> in the
farce, that 
<q rend="inline">"if there was as much care taken in the breed
of the human ſpecies, as there is in that of dogs and of horſes, we
ſhould not have ſo many puny half-formed animals as we daily ſee among
us:"</q> and indeed every thorough ſportſman very well knows, that as much
art is required in bringing up a Jockey, as the beaſt he is to ride. In every
reſpect the ſame care muſt be had to keep him in wind; and he muſt be
in like manner dieted, put in ſweats, and exerciſed to bring him down to a
proper weight. Much depends upon the ſize of the man as well as horſe: for
a rider of the ſame dimenſions with a grenadier would no more be fit to
come upon the Turf as a Jockey, than an awkward thing taken out of the ſhafts
of a dray could ever appear at the ſtarting-poſt as a race-horſe. This is
obvious to every one; and I could not help ſmiling at what my landlord at the
<hi>White Bear</hi> ſaid the other day to a fellow-commoner of <hi>St.
John</hi>'s, (who would fain be thought a Knowing One) by way of compliment: 
<q rend="inline">"My worthy maſter, ſaid the landlord, it

                     </p>
                     <p>MY chief inducement to write to you at preſent, Mr. TOWN,
was to deſire you to uſe your endeavours to bring the Jockey into equal
eſteem with the animal he beſtrides; and to beg that you would promote the
ſettling an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed <pb n="378" facs="tcp:1252700301:385"/> ſcheme for the
preſervation of his breed. In order to this I would humbly propoſe, that a
ſtud for the Jockeys ſhould be immediately built near the ſtables at
<hi>Newmarket,</hi> and that their genealogies ſhould be duly regiſtered;
that the breed ſhould be croſſed, as occaſion might require; and that
the beſt horſemen and of the lighteſt weights ſhould intermarry with
the full ſiſters of thoſe who had won moſt plates; and in a word the
ſame methods uſed for the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Jockeys as their horſes. I
have here ſent you the exact pedigree of a famous Jockey, taken with all that
care juſt now preſcribed; and I doubt not if my ſcheme was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
put in execution, but we ſhould excel all other nations in our horſemen, as
we already do in our horſes.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">R</seg>ETURNING the other night from the coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, where I had
juſt been reading the Votes, I found myſelf on a ſudden op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
with a drowſineſs, that ſeemed to promiſe me as ſound a repoſe in
my great chair, as my dog already enjoyed by the fire-ſide. I willingly
indulged it, and had hardly cloſed my eyes before I fell into the following
dream.</p>
               <p>METHOUGHT the door of my room on a ſudden flew open, and
admitted a great variety of Dogs of all ſorts and ſizes, from the maſtiff
to the lapdog. I was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at this appearance, but my amazement was much
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:1252700301:387"/> encreaſed, when I ſaw a large Grey-hound advancing
towards me, and heard him thus addreſs me in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man voice.</p>
               <q> 
                  <p> YOU cannot, Sir, be ignorant of the panic that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails among
all our ſpecies, on account of a ſcheme now on foot for our deſtruction.
That ſlaughter, which was formerly made among the wolves of this land, and in
which our anceſtors bore ſo large a ſhare, is now going to be revived
among us. I, for my own part, have no hopes of eſcaping, as you will eaſily
judge when you hear my caſe. My maſter owes his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence to his
labour, and with his wages can juſt main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain me and his three children. In
return, I now and then afford him a comfortable meal, by killing him a rabbit
in the ſquire's warren, or picking him up a hare on a <hi>Sunday</hi>
morning. The other ſervices I render him are of equal importance to him and
pleaſure to myſelf. I am his conſtant companion to the field in the
morning, and back again at night: he knows that his cloaths and his wallet are
ſafe in my keeping; and he is ſure to be rouzed on any midnight alarm, when
I am in the houſe.</p> 
                  <p> IT is with horror I reflect on the numbers of my relations, who
will ſwing their laſt, and againſt whom this law ſeems indeed to be
levelled. Is it not enough that our merits are neglected, and thought inferior
to thoſe of a ſlow-footed race, who inhabit a ſpacious ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel in the
ſquire's yard, and who are as many hours in killing a hare, as we are
minutes? Yet they are kept by the great, attended by the noble, and every day
treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <pb n="381" facs="tcp:1252700301:388"/> with horſe-fleſh: while I live among the
poor, am threatned by the rich, and now probably ſhall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by
public authority.</p> 
                  <p> I CANNOT deny, but that the favour of the ladies is frequently
extended to a ſmall and degenerate race; who, tho' they bear our name, may
very properly be ſtiled the <hi>Fribbles</hi> of our Species. 'Tis true, they
are of foreign extraction, which alone is ſufficient merit, and ſeem indeed
to be as much preferred by the <hi>Beau Monde</hi> to our <hi>Engliſh</hi>
greyhounds, as their countrymen in the <hi>Haymarket</hi> are to our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> ſingers. But tho' this breed is ſo diminutive, that I
myſelf have courſed one of them for a hare, yet I will venture to
pronounce, that be the tax what it will, not a <hi>Fido</hi> in the land will
be ſacrificed to the laws.</p> 
                  <p> OUR requeſt to you is to diſplay our merits to the world
and convince mankind of the innocence of our intentions, and the hardſhips
that we already labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Though I have enlarged on my own caſe; I have
the honour to addreſs you in the name of all my brethren; ſuch of them, I
mean, as think themſelves endangered by this ſcheme for our deſtruction.
At the ſame time we deſire you to apprize the Public of the hazard they may
run by coming to an open rupture; ſince, in ſuch a caſe, the Maſtiffs
and the Bull Dogs are determined to join their forces, and will ſell their
lives at the deareſt rate.</p> 
               </q>
               <p>THIS laſt reſolution was confirmed by a general growl. After
which I was thus accoſted by another of the company, of the
Pointing-breed.</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="382" facs="tcp:1252700301:389"/> 
                  <p> LITTLE did I think, that the pains I have taken, and the
blows I have ſuffered, to perfect me in the art I profeſs, would have been
thus requited. Having loſt the beſt of maſters by an accident from his
gun, which I can ſcarce ever think of without a howl, I have now, like my
friend <hi>Smoker,</hi> the misfortune to live with a poor man. A misfortune I
now call it, ſince alas! he will not be able to ſave me from the halter, by
paying my ranſom. He too, I am afraid, will be reduced to beggary; ſince at
preſent, I and his gun are his chief ſupport. If he is deprived of me, and
thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from what the rich maliciouſly term <hi>poaching,</hi> his
beſt reſource will be to diſpatch himſelf with his gun before he
ſurrenders it, or to hang himſelf with the ſame rope that ties up me.
When I was a puppy, I was every day fed in the kitchen, and careſſed in the
parlour; and I have now a brother, that always points for the beſt of
company. What though our race has been frequently reproached? What though we,
together with the Spaniels, have been accuſed, I do not ſay wrongfully, of
crouching to our enemies, and licking the hand that beats us? Is not this every
day practiſed among your ſpecies, and is it not countenanced by the
greateſt examples? In fawning and flattering we are by no means ſingular,
and crouching and cringing are not confined to the brute ſpecies.</p> 
                  <p> I VERY heartily ſecond the requeſt of my friend, and
doubt not but the arguments you will uſe in our behalf will be able to divert
the ſtorm that threatens us. This, you may be aſſured of, that if my life
is ſpared through your means, it ſhall be devoted to your ſervice; 
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:1252700301:390"/> and you ſhall ſup, as often as you pleaſe, oh a
brace of birds.</p>
               </q>
               <p>THIS ſpeech was attended with a bark of applauſe; and I was
next accoſted by a Lap-Dog, who, after dolefully ſhaking his ears, began
the following harangue.— 
<q rend="inline">"Though I am aware that many of my ſpecies
will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unhurt by this ſcheme deviſed for our deſtruction, yet I
have on my own account great reaſon to be alarmed. I was born indeed in a
noble family in <hi>St. James</hi>'s ſquare, but unfortunately was within
theſe three months reſigned over to my preſent miſtreſs, an old maid,
who had been through her whole life as frugal of her money as her favours. She
is indeed ſo very ſaving, that I have more than once been beat for lapping
up her breakfaſt cream, and it was but laſt week that I was ſeverely
corrected for devouring a ſheep's heart, for which ſhe had been to market
herſelf. Such a miſtreſs will undoubtedly ſacrifice me to this cruel
tax; and though you may perhaps imagine the loſs of life in theſe
circumſtances is not much to be regretted, yet death is a terrible remedy,
and a living dog is better than a dead lion. But if ſome of our ſpecies
muſt periſh, ſurely a regard ſhould be had to national merit; and the
ſtorm ſhould firſt fall on thoſe foreign intruders, who by the
flatneſs of their noſes are ſuppoſed to be of <hi>Dutch</hi>
extraction. If the ladies alſo have any regard to the honour of their
country, or any love remaining for Us, it becomes them to take our caſe into
conſideration. And I make no doubt, ſince <hi>The</hi> FEMALE PARLIAMENT is
now ſitting, but if you, Sir, would draw up a petition in our favour; as the
other ſex have taken necceſſary <pb n="384" facs="tcp:1252700301:391"/> precautions for
the preſervation of the Game, the ladies would in their turn bring in a bill
for the preſervation of Lap-Dogs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>VARIOUS were the arguments that many others uſed in their own
behalf. The Maſtiff inſiſted on the Protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he afforded us, and the
terror he ſtruck into thieves and houſe-breakers. King <hi>Charles</hi>'s
black favourites came fawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon me, and hoped that their breed might be
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in deference to the taſte of ſo witty a monarch. I could not
help ſmiling at the argument made uſe of by a Bull-Dog from
<hi>Norfolk:</hi> who declared that he was ſo inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to the mirth of
the county, that he firmly believed, they would never part with him; but begged
at the ſame time that, if ſentence <hi>muſt</hi> paſs, it might be
changed into baniſhment, and that <hi>Spain</hi> might be the place of his
tranſportation.</p>
               <p>THE eloquence and geſture of my four-footed viſiters had
ſuch an influence over me, that I was juſt going to anſwer them in the
manner they could wiſh; when my own Dog on a ſudden jumped into my lap, and
rouzed me from my dream.</p>

myſelf, I was highly pleaſed with a letter inſerted ſome time ago in
your pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ridiculing the deteſtable uſe of paint among the ladies. This
practice is indeed too general; and for my part, when I meet with a bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
freſh-coloured face in town, I no more take it for the real face belonging to
the lady, than I imagine Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s portrait delineated on a
ſign-poſt to be Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jedy's fleſh and blood.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="386" facs="tcp:1252700301:393"/>BUT this faſhion is not confined to
the ladies. I am aſhamed to tell you that we are indebted to <hi>Spaniſh
Wool</hi> for many of our maſculine ruddy complexions. A pretty fellow
lackers his pale face with as many varniſhes as a fine lady; and it is well
known that late hours at the card-table, amuſements at <hi>Haddock</hi>'s,
immoderate draughts of Champagne, and ſleeping all night upon a bulk, will
ſtrip the moſt healthy complexion of its roſes. Therefore to repair the
loſs, they are obliged to ſubſtitute the unwholeſome diſguiſe of
art, for the native hue of a vigorous conſtitution.</p>
                     <p>I MUST leave it to you, Mr. TOWN, or your inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious
correſpondent to enlarge upon this ſubject; and will only juſt appeal to
the ladies, whether a ſmooth fair face is a proper recommendation of a man to
their favour, and whether they do not look on thoſe of the other ſex as a
contemptible ſort of rivals, who aſpire to be thought charming and pretty?
As many females are alſo conſcious that they themſelves endeavour to
conceal by art the defects of nature, they are apt to ſuſpect thoſe of
our ſex, who are ſo very ſollicitous to ſet off their perſons: and
indeed I fear it will be found upon examination that our pretty fellows, who
lay on Carmine, are painting a rotten poſt.</p>

               <p>MANY of my readers will, I dare ſay, be hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded
that this cuſtom could have ever pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed as a branch of male foppery: but
it is too <pb n="387" facs="tcp:1252700301:394"/> notorious that our fine gentlemen, in many
other instances beſides the article of paint, affect the ſoftneſs and
deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the fair ſex. The male beauty has his waſhes, perfumes, and
coſmetics; and takes as much pains to ſet a gloſs on his complexion, as
the footman in japan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his ſhoes. He has his dreſſing-room and (which
is ſtill more ridiculous) his Toilette too; at which he ſits as many hours
repairing his battered countenance, as a decayed toaſt dreſſing for a
birth-night. I had once an opportunity of taking a ſurvey of one of theſe
Male-Toilettes; and as ſuch a curioſity may perhaps prove entertaining to
many of my readers, I ſhall here give a deſcription of it.</p>
               <p>HAVING occaſion one morning to wait on a very pretty fellow, I
was deſired by the <hi>Valet de Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre</hi> to walk into the dreſſing
room, till his maſter was ſtirring. I was accordingly ſhewn into a neat
little cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, hung round with <hi>India</hi> paper, and adorned with
ſeveral little images of pagods and bramins, and veſſels of <hi>Chelſea
China,</hi> in which were ſet various-coloured ſprigs of artificial
flowers. But the Toilette moſt excited my admiration; where I found every
thing was intended to be agreeable to the <hi>Chineſe</hi> taſte. A
looking-glaſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed in a whimſical frame of <hi>Chineſe</hi>
paling, ſtood upon a <hi>Japan</hi> table, over which was ſpread a coverlid
of the fineſt chints. I could not but obſerve a number of boxes of
different ſizes, which were all of them <hi>Japan,</hi> and were regularly
diſpoſed on the table. I had the curioſity to examine the contents of
ſeveral, and in one I found lip-ſalve; in another a roll of pigtail; and in
another the ladies black ſticking plaiſter: but the laſt which I opened 
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:1252700301:395"/> very much ſurpriſed me, as I found nothing in it but
a number of little pills. I likewiſe remarked in one part of the table a
tooth-bruſh and ſpunge with a pot of <hi>Delaſcot</hi>'s opiate, and on
the other ſide water for the eyes: in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle ſtood a bottle of <hi>Eau
de Luce,</hi> and a roll of perfumed pomatum: almond paſtes, powder-puffs,
hair combs, bruſhes, nippers, and the like, made up the reſt of this
fantaſtic equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page: but among many other wimſies, I could not conceive for
what uſe a very ſmall ivory comb could be deſigned, till the valet
informed me, that it was a comb for the eye-brows.</p>
               <p>IT muſt be confeſſed, that there are ſome men of ſuch
a delicate make and ſilky conſtitution, that it is no wonder if gentlemen
of ſuch a lady-like generation have a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tendency to the refinements
and ſoftneſſes of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males. Theſe tender dear creatures are generally
bred up immediately under the wing of their mamas, and ſcarce fed with any
thing leſs innocent than her milk. They are never permitted to ſtudy,
leaſt it ſhould hurt their eyes, and make their heads ache; nor ſuffered
to uſe any exerciſes, like other boys, leaſt a fine hand ſhould be
ſpoiled by being uſed too roughly. While other lads are flogged into the
five declenſions, and at length laſhed through a whole ſchool, theſe
pretty maſters are kept at home to improve in whip-ſillabubs, paſtry, and
<hi>face-painting.</hi> In conſequence of which, when other young fellows
begin to appear like men, theſe dainty creatures come into the world, with
all the accompliſhments of a lady's woman.</p>
               <p>BUT if theſe common foibles of the female world are ridiculous
even in theſe equivocal half-men, theſe neuter <pb n="389" facs="tcp:1252700301:396"/>
ſomethings between male and female, how awkardly muſt they ſit upon the
more robuſt and maſculine part of mankind? What indeed can be more
abſurd, than to ſee a huge fellow with the make of a porter, and fit to
mount the ſtage as a champion at <hi>Broughton</hi>'s Amphitheatre, ſitting
to varniſh his broad face with paint and <hi>Benjamin</hi>-waſh? For my
part I never ſee a great looby aiming at <hi>delicateſſe,</hi> but it
ſeems as ſtrange and uncouth a figure as <hi>Achilles</hi> in petticoats.
This folly is alſo to be particularly condemned, when it appears in the more
ſolemn characters of life, to which a gravity of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is
eſſential; and in which the leaſt marks of fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery ſeem as improper,
as a phyſician would ſeem ridiculous preſcribing in a bag-wig, or a
ſerjeant pleading at the <hi>King</hi>'s <hi>Bench</hi> in his own hair
inſtead of a night-cap periwig. As I think an inſtance or two of this kind
would ſhew this folly in the moſt ſtriking light, I ſhall here
ſubjoin two characters, in whom as it is moſt improper, it will
conſequently appear moſt ridiculous.</p>
               <p>JOHN HARDMAN is upwards of ſix feet high, and ſtout enough
to beat two of the ſturdieſt chairmen that ever came out of
<hi>Ireland.</hi> Nature indeed ſeems to have intended <hi>John</hi>
himſelf to carry a chair, but fortune has enabled him to appear in whatever
character he likes beſt, and he has wiſely diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that none will
ſit ſo eaſy on him as that of a pretty fellow. It is therefore his
ſtudy to new-mould his face, and perſon: He throws his goggle eyes into
leers, languiſhes and ogles; and endeavours to draw up his hideous mouth,
that extends from one ear to the other, into a ſimper. His voice, which is
naturally of a deeper baſe than an hurdy-gurdy, is in a manner ſet to a new
tune: and his ſpeech, which is very much tinctured with the broad dialect of
a particular county, <pb n="390" facs="tcp:1252700301:397"/> is delivered with ſo much nicety
and gentleneſs, that every word is minced and clipt in order to appear ſoft
and delicate. When he walks, he endeavours to move his unwieldy figure along in
the pert trip, or eaſy ſhambling pace of our pretty fellows; and commonly
carries a thin jemmy ſtick in his hand, which naturally reminds us of
<hi>Hercules</hi> with a diſtaff.</p>
               <p>THE Reverend Mr. JESSAMY, (who took orders only becauſe there
was a good living in the family,) is known among the ladies by the name of the
Beau-Parſon. He is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the moſt delicate creature imaginable; and
differs ſo much from the generality of the clergy, that I believe the very
ſight of a plumb-pudding would make him ſwoon. Out of his Canonicals, his
conſtant dreſs is what they call Parſon's-Blue, lined with white; a black
ſattin waiſtcoat, velvet breeches, and ſilk ſtockings: his pumps are of
dog-ſkin made by <hi>Tull</hi>; and it is ſaid that he had a joint of one
of his toes cut off, whoſe length being out of all proportion, prevented his
having a handſome foot. His very grizzle is ſcarce ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox: for, though
it would be open ſchiſm to wear a bag, yet his wig has always a bag-front,
and is properly cropped behind, that it may not eclipſe the luſtre of his
diamond ſtock-buckle. He cannot bear the thoughts of being ſea-ſick; or
elſe he declares he would certainly go abroad, where he might again reſume
his laced cloaths, and appear like a gentleman in a bag-wig, and ſword.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>MONG the many exotic diverſions, that have been
tranſplanted into this country, there is no one more cultivated, or which
ſeems to have taken deeper root among us, than that modeſt and rational
entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Maſquerade. This, as well as the Opera, is originally of
<hi>Italian</hi> growth; and was brought over hither by the celebrated
<hi>Heidegger,</hi> who thence juſtly acquired among his own countrymen the
honourable title of <hi>Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendant des plaiſirs d' Angleterre.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="392" facs="tcp:1252700301:399"/>I HAVE called the Maſquerade a modeſt
and rational entertainment. As to the firſt, no one can have the leaſt
ſcruple about its innocence, if he conſiders, that it is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways made a
part of the education of our polite females; and that the moſt virtuous woman
is not aſhamed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear there. If it be objected, that a lady is expoſed
to hear many indecencies from the men, (as the maſk gives them a privilege to
ſay any thing, though ever ſo rude) it may be anſwered, that no lady is
obliged to take the affront to herſelf; becauſe, as ſhe goes
diſguiſed, the indignity is not offered to her in her own proper perſon.
Beſides, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Dryden, 
<q> 
                     <l>She cannot bluſh, becauſe they cannot ſee.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>AS to the rationality of this entertainment, every one will
agree with me, that theſe midnight orgies are full as rational as ſitting
up all night at the card-table. Nor is it more ſtrange, that five or ſix
hundred people ſhould meet together in diſguiſes purpoſely to conceal
themſelves, than that the ſame number ſhould aſſemble at a route,
where moſt of the company are wholly unacquainted with each other.</p>
               <p>BUT we can never enough admire the wit and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of theſe
meetings; which greatly conſiſts in exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting the moſt fantaſtic
appearances, that the moſt whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical imagination can poſſibly
deviſe. A common perſon may be content with appearing as a Chineſe, a
Turk, or a Fryar; but the true genius will ranſack earth, air, and ſeas,
reconcile contradictions, and call in things inanimate, as well as animate, to
his aſſiſtance: and the more extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant and out of nature his dreſs
can be contrived, the <pb n="393" facs="tcp:1252700301:400"/> higher is the joke. I remember one
gentleman above ſix foot high, who came to the maſquerade dreſt, like a
child, in a white frock and leading ſtrings, attended by another gentleman of
exceeding low ſtature, who offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated as his nurſe. The ſame witty
ſpark took it into his head at another time to perſonate Fame, and was
ſtuck all over with peacock-feathers by way of eyes: but when he came to
faſten on his wings, they were ſpread to ſo enormous a length, that no
coach or chair was ſpacious enough to admit him; ſo that he was forced to
be conveyed along the ſtreets on a chair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's horſe, covered with a
blanket. Another gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of no leſs humour very much ſurpriſed the
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany by carrying a thatched houſe about him; which was ſo contrived,
that no part of him could be ſeen, except his face, which was looking out of
the caſement: but this joke had like to have coſt him dear, as another wag
was going to ſet fire to the building, becauſe he found, by the leaden
policy affixed to the front, that the tenement was inſured. In a word, dogs,
monkeys, oſtriches, and all kinds of monitors, are as frequently to be met
with at the maſquerade, as in the <hi>Covent-Garden</hi> pantomimes: and I
once ſaw with great delight a gentleman (who perſonated one of
<hi>Bayes</hi>'s recruits) prance a minuet on his hobby-horſe, with a dancing
bear for his partner.</p>
               <p>I HAVE ſaid before, that the Maſquerade is of foreign
extraction, and imported to us from abroad. But as the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
though ſlow at invention, are remarkable for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving on what has already
been invented, it is no wonder that we ſhould attempt to heighten the guſto
of this enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and even carry it beyond the licence of a foreign 
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:1252700301:401"/> Carnival. There is ſomething too inſipid in our fine
gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men ſtalking about in dominos; and it is rather cruel to eclipſe the
pretty faces of our fine ladies with hideous maſks: for which reaſons it
has been judged requiſite to contrive a maſquerade upon a new plan, and in
an entire new taſte. We may all remember, when (a few years ago) a celebrated
lady endeavoured to introduce a new ſpecies of Maſquerade among us, by
lopping off the exuberance of dreſs: and ſhe herſelf firſt ſet the
example, by ſtripping to the character of <hi>Iphigenia</hi> undreſt for
the ſacrifice. I muſt own, it is a matter of ſome ſurprize to me
(conſidering the propenſity of our modern ladies to get rid of their
cloaths,) that other <hi>Iphigenias</hi> did not immediately ſtart up, or
that nuns and veſtals ſhould be ſuffered ever after to be ſeen among
the maſks. But this project, it ſeems, was not then ſufficiently ripe for
execution, as a certain aukward thing, called Baſhfulneſs, had not yet been
baniſhed from the female world: and to the preſent enlightened times was
reſerved the honour of introducing (however contradictory the term may
ſeem) a NAKED MASQUERADE.</p>
               <p>WHAT the above-mentioned lady had the hardineſs to attempt
alone, will (I am aſſured) be ſet on foot by our perſons of faſhion,
as ſoon as the hot days come in. <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelagh.</hi> is the place pitched
upon for their meeting; where it is propoſed to have a Maſquerade <hi>Al
Freſco,</hi> and the whole company is to diſplay all their charms <hi>in
puris natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libus.</hi> The <hi>Pantheon of the Heathen Gods, Ovid's
Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſes,</hi> and <hi>Titian's Prints</hi> will ſupply them with a
ſufficient variety of undreſt characters. One ſet of ladies, I am told,
intend to perſonate <hi>Water-Nymphs</hi> bathing in the canal: 
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:1252700301:402"/> three ſiſters, celebrated for their charms, deſign
to appear together as the <hi>Three Graces</hi>; and a certain lady of quality,
who moſt reſembles the Goddeſs of Beauty, is now practiſing from a
model of the noted ſtatue of <hi>Venus de Medicis,</hi> the moſt ſtriking
attitudes for that character. As to the gentlemen, they may moſt of them
repreſent very ſuitably the half-brutal forms of <hi>Satyrs, Pans,
Fauns,</hi> and <hi>Centaurs:</hi> our beaux may aſſume the ſemblance of
the beardleſs <hi>Apollo,</hi> or (which would be more natural) may admire
themſelves in the perſon of <hi>Narciſſus:</hi> and our bucks might act
quite in character, by running about ſtark-naked with their
miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, and committing the maddeſt freaks, like the Prieſts and
Prieſteſſes of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> celebrating the <hi>Bacchanalian</hi>
myſteries.</p>
               <p>IF this ſcheme for a Naked Maſquerade ſhould meet with
encouragement, (as there is no doubt but it muſt,) it is propoſed to
improve it ſtill further. Perſons of faſhion cannot but lament, that
there are no diverſions allotted to Sunday, except the card-table; and they
can never enough regret, that the Sunday evening tea-drinkings at
<hi>Ranelagh</hi> were laid aſide, from a ſuperſtitious regard to
religion. They therefore intend to have a particular ſort of Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade on
that day, in which they may ſhew their taſte by ridiculing all the old
womens tales contained in that idle book of fables, the Bible; while the vulgar
are devoutly attending to them at church. This, indeed, is not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a
parallel: we have had an inſtance already of an <hi>Eve</hi>; and by
borrowing the ſerpent in <hi>Orpheus</hi> and <hi>Eurydice,</hi> we might
have the whole ſtory of the Fall of Man exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in a Maſquerade.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:1252700301:403"/>IT muſt, indeed, be acknowledged, that
this project has already taken place among the loweſt of the people, who
ſeem to have been the firſt contrivers of a Naked Maſquerade: and laſt
ſummer I remember an article in the news-papers, that 
<q rend="inline">"ſeveral perſons of both ſexes were
aſſembled naked at <hi>Pimlico,</hi> and being carried before a
magiſtrate were ſent to Bridewell."</q> This, indeed, is too refined a
pleaſure to be allowed the vulgar: and every body will agree with me, that
the ſame act, which at the <hi>Green Lamps,</hi> or <hi>Pimlico</hi> appears
low and criminal, may be polite, and extremely commendable at the
<hi>Haymarket</hi> or at <hi>Ranelagh.</hi>

                     <p>BAYES in the <hi>Rehearſal</hi> frequently boaſts it as
his chief excellence that he treads on no man's heels, that he ſcorns to
follow the ſteps of others; and when he is aſked the reaſon of
inſerting any abſurdity in his play, he anſwers, <hi>becauſe it is
new.</hi> The poets of the preſent time run into the contrary error: they are
ſo far from endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to elevate and ſurprize by any thing original,
that <pb n="398" facs="tcp:1252700301:405"/> their whole buſineſs is imitation; and they
jingle their bells in the ſame road with thoſe that went before them, with
all the dull exactneſs of a packhorſe.</p>
                     <p>THE generality of our writers wait till a new walk is pointed
out to them by ſome leading genius, when it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately becomes ſo
hackney'd and beaten, that an author of credit is almoſt aſhamed to appear
in it among ſuch bad company. No ſooner does one man of parts ſucceed in
any particular mode of writing, but he is followed by a thouſand dunces. A
good elegy makes the little ſcribblers direct their whole bent to ſubjects
of grief, and, for a whole winter, the preſs groans with melancholy. One
novel of reputation fills all the garrets of <hi>Grub Street</hi> with whole
reams of hiſtories and adventures, where volume is ſpun out after volume,
without the leaſt wit, humour, or incident. In a word, as <hi>Bayes</hi>
obviated all objections to his nonſenſe by ſaying <hi>it was new,</hi> if
a modern writer was aſked why he choſe any particular manner of writing, he
might reply, <hi>becauſe it is the faſhion.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>TRUE genius will not give into ſuch idle extravagant flights
of imagination as <hi>Bayes,</hi> it will not turn funerals into banquets, or
introduce armies in diſguiſe: but ſtill it will not confine itſelf to
the narrow track of imitation. I cannot help thinking that it is more owing to
this ſervile ſpirit in the authors of the preſent time, than to their
want of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that we cannot now boaſt a ſet of eminent writers: And
it is worthy obſervation that whenever any age has been diſtinguiſhed by
a great number of excellent authors, they have moſt of them cultivated
<hi>different</hi> branches of poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try from each other. This was the caſe in
the age of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus,</hi> 
                        <pb n="399" facs="tcp:1252700301:406"/> as appears from the
works of <hi>Virgil, Horace, Ovid,</hi> &amp;c. And to come down as late as
poſſible, this is evident from our laſt famous ſet of authors, who
flouriſhed in the beginning of this century. We admire <hi>Swift, Pope, Gay,
Bolinbroke, Addiſon,</hi> &amp;c. but we admire each for his particular
beauties, ſeparate and diſtinguiſhed from the reſt.</p>
                     <p>I FEAR Mr. TOWN, that my letter will appear too vague and
unconnected; but theſe looſe thoughts were thrown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether merely to
introduce the following little poem, which I think deſerves the attention of
the Public. It was writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by a very ingenious gentleman, as a letter to a
friend, who was about to publiſh a volume of miſcellanies; and contains all
that original ſpirit, which it ſo elegantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE various ſeaſons of the year produce not a greater
alteration in the face of nature, than in the polite manner of paſſing our
time. The diverſions of winter and ſummer are as diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent as the dog-days
and thoſe at <hi>Chriſtmas</hi>; nor do I know any genteel amuſement,
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Gaming, that prevails during the whole year. As the long days are now
coming on, the theatrical gentry, who contribute to diſſipate the gloom of
our winter evenings, begin to divide themſelves into ſtrolling companies;
and are packing up their tragedy wardrobes, together with a ſufficient
quantity of thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lightning, for the delight and amazement of the
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. In the mean time the ſeveral public Gardens near this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tropolis
are trimming their trees, levelling their walks, and bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing their lamps,
for our reception. At <hi>Vaux-hall</hi> (which is already opened) the
artificial ruins are repaired; the caſcade is made to ſpout with ſeveral
additional ſtreams of block-tin; <pb n="404" facs="tcp:1252700301:411"/> and they have touched
up all the pictures, which were da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged laſt ſeaſon by the fingering of
thoſe curious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeurs, who could not be ſatisfied without
<hi>feeling</hi> whether the figures were alive. The magazine at
<hi>Cuper</hi>'s, I am told, is furniſhed with an extraordinary ſupply of
gunpowder, to be ſhot off in ſquibs and ſky-rockets, or whirled away in
blaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuns and <hi>Catherine</hi> wheels. And it is not to be doubted, in
caſe of a war, but that <hi>Neptune</hi> and all his <hi>Tritons</hi> will
aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the <hi>Britiſh</hi> navy; and as we before took
<hi>Porto-Bello</hi> and <hi>Cape Breton,</hi> we ſhall gain new victories
over the <hi>French</hi> fleet every night upon that canal.</p>
               <p>HAPPY are they, who can muſter up ſufficient, at leaſt to
hire tickets at the door, once or twice in a ſeaſon! Not that theſe
pleaſures are confined to the rich and the great only; for the lower ſort
of people have their <hi>Ranelaghs</hi> and their <hi>Vaux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halls</hi> as well
as the quality. <hi>Perrot</hi>'s inimitable Grotto may be ſeen for only
calling for a pot of beer; and the royal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of duck-hunting, may be
had into the bargain, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with a decanter of <hi>Dorcheſter,</hi> for
your ſix-pence at <hi>Jenny</hi>'s <hi>Whim.</hi> Every ſkettle-alley half
a mile out of town is embelliſhed with green arbours and ſhady retreats;
where the company is generally entertained with the melodious ſcraping of a
blind fiddler. And who can reſiſt the luſcious temptation of a fine juicy
ham, or a delicious buttock of beef ſtuffed with parſley, accompanied with
a foaming decanter of ſparkling home-brew'd, which is ſo invitingly painted
at the entrance of almoſt every village ale-houſe?</p>
               <p>OUR Northern climate will not, indeed, allow us to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
ourſelves in all thoſe pleaſures of a garden, which are ſo feelingly
deſcribed by our poets. We dare not lay our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the damp ground in
ſhady groves, or by the purl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtream, but are obliged to fortify our
inſides againſt the cold by good ſubſtantial eating and drinking. For
this reaſon the extreme coſtlineſs of the proviſions at our public
Gardens has been grievouſly complained of by thoſe gentry, to whom a
ſupper at theſe places is as neceſſary a part of the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as
the ſinging or the fireworks. Poor Mr. <hi>John</hi> ſees with an heavy
heart the profits of a whole week's card-money de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured in tarts and
cheeſe-cakes by Mrs. Houſe-keeper or Mrs. Lady's own Woman: and the
ſubſtantial cit, who comes from behind the counter two or three evenings in
the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, can never enough regret the thin wafer-like ſlices of beef and
ham, that taſte of nothing but the knife.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="405" facs="tcp:1252700301:412"/>I WAS greatly diverted laſt Saturday
evening at <hi>Vaux-hall</hi> with the ſhrewd remarks made on this very head
by an honeſt citizen; whoſe wife and two daughters had, I found, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
on him to carry them to the Garden. As I thought there was ſomething curious
in their behaviour, I went into the next box to them, where I had an
opportunity of ſeeing and over-hearing every thing that paſt.</p>
               <p>AFTER ſome talk,— 
<q rend="inline">"Come, come, (ſaid the old don) it is high
time, I think, to go to ſupper."</q> To this the ladies readily aſſented;
and one of the miſſes ſaid, 
<q rend="inline">"do let us have a chick, papa."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Zounds (ſaid the father) they are half a
crown a-piece, and no bigger than a ſparrow."</q> Here the old lady took him
up— 
<q rend="inline">"You are ſo ſtingy, Mr. <hi>Roſe,</hi>
there is no bearing you. When one is out upon pleaſure, I love to appear like
ſomebody: and what ſignifies a few ſhillings once and away, when a body
is about it?"</q> This reproof ſo effectually ſilenced the old gentleman,
that the youngeſt miſs had the courage to put in a word for ſome ham
likewiſe: Accordingly the waiter was called, and diſpatched by the old lady
with an order for a chicken and a plate of ham. When it was brought, our
honeſt cit twirled the diſh about three or four times, and ſurveyed it
with a very ſettled counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; then taking up the ſlice of ham, and
dangling it to and fro on the end of his fork, aſked the waiter, 
<q rend="inline">"how much there was of it."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"A ſhilling's worth, Sir,"</q> ſaid the
fellow. 
<q rend="inline">"—Prithee, ſaid the don, how much doſt
think it weighs?—An ounce?—A ſhilling an ounce! that is ſixteen
ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings <hi>per</hi> pound!—A reaſonable profit truly!—Let
me ſee—ſuppoſe now the whole ham weighs thirty pounds:—at a
ſhilling <hi>per</hi> ounce, that is, ſixteen ſhillings <hi>per</hi>
pound, why your maſter makes exactly twenty-four pounds of every ham; and if
he buys them at the beſt hand, and ſalts them and cures them himſelf,
they don't ſtand him in ten ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a-piece."</q> The old lady bade him
hold his nonſenſe, declared herſelf aſhamed for him, and aſked him if
people muſt not live: then taking a coloured handkerchief from her own neck,
ſhe tucked it into his ſhirt-collar, whence it hung like a bib, and helped
him to a leg of the chicken. The old gentleman, at every bit he put in his
mouth, amuſed himſelf with ſaying, — 
<q rend="inline">"there goes two-pence—there goes
three-pence—there goes a groat.—Zounds a man at theſe places
ſhould not have a ſwallow ſo wide as a tom-tit."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="406" facs="tcp:1252700301:413"/>THIS ſcanty repaſt, we may imagine,
was ſoon diſpatched; and it was with much difficulty our citizen was
prevailed on to ſuffer a plate of beef to be ordered. This too was no leſs
admired, and underwent the ſame comments with the ham: at length, when only a
very ſmall bit was left, as they ſay, for manners in the diſh, our don
took a piece of an old news<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paper out of his pocket, and gravely wrapping up
the meat in it placed it carefully in his letter caſe. 
<q rend="inline">"I'll keep thee as a curioſity to my dying
day; and I'll ſhow thee to my neighbour <hi>Horſeman,</hi> and aſk him if
he can make as much of his ſtakes."</q> Then rubbing his hands, and
ſhrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging up his ſhoulders, 
<q rend="inline">"Why now, ſays he, to-morrow night I may eat
as much cold beef as I can ſtuff in any tavern in <hi>London,</hi> and pay
nothing for it"</q> A diſh of tarts, cheeſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cakes and cuſtards next made
their appearance at the requeſt of the young ladies, who paid no ſort of
regard to the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's remonſtrance, 
<q rend="inline">"that they were four times as dear as at the
paſtry-cook's."</q>
               </p>
               <p>SUPPER being ended, madam put her ſpouſe in mind to call for
wine.— 
<q rend="inline">"We <hi>muſt</hi> have ſome wine, my dear,
or we ſhall not be looked upon, you know."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Well, well, ſays the don, that's right
enough. But do they ſell their liquor too by the ounce?—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Here, drawer, what wine have you got?"</q> The
fellow, who by this time began to ſmoke his gueſts, anſwered— 
<q rend="inline">"We have exceeding good <hi>French</hi> wine of
all ſorts, and pleaſe your honour. Would your honour have a bottle of
Champagne, or Burgundy, or Claret, or"—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"No, no, none of your wiſhy-waſhy
outlandiſh rot-gut for me:"</q> interrupted the citizen.— 
<q rend="inline">"A tankard of the Alderman beats all the red
Claret wine in the <hi>French</hi> king's cellar.—But come, bring us a
bottle of ſound old Port; and d'ye hear? let it be good."</q>
               </p>
               <p>WHILE the waiter was gone, the good man moſt ſadly
la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, that he could not have his pipe; which the wife would by no means
allow, 
<q rend="inline">"becauſe (ſhe ſaid) it was ungenteel to
ſmoke, where there were any ladies in company."</q> When the wine came, our
citizen gravely took up the bottle, and holding it above his head, 
<q rend="inline">"Aye, aye, ſaid he, the bottom has had a good
kick—And mind how confoundedly it is warped on the ſides.—Not
above five gills, I warrant.—An old ſoldier at the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>
would beat two of them.—But let us ſee how it is brew'd."</q> He then
poured out a glaſs; and after holding it up before the candle, ſmelling to 
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:1252700301:414"/> it, ſipping it twice or thrice, and ſmacking with
his lips; drank it off: but declaring that ſecond thoughts were beſt, he
filled another bumper; and toſſing that off, after ſome pauſe, with a
very important air, ventured to pronounce it drinkable. The ladies, having
alſo drank a glaſs round, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed it was very good, and felt warm in the
ſtomach: and even the old gentleman relaxed into ſuch good humour by the
time the bottle was emptied, that out of his own free will and motion he moſt
generouſly called for another pint, but charged the waiter 
<q rend="inline">"to pick out an honeſt one."</q>
               </p>
               <p>WHILE the glaſs was thus circulating, the family amuſed
themſelves by making obſervations on the Garden. The ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen expreſſed
his wonder at the number of lamps; and ſaid it muſt coſt a great deal of
money every night to light them all: the eldeſt miſs declared, that for her
part ſhe liked the Dark Walk beſt of all, becauſe it was
<hi>ſolentary:</hi> little miſs thought the laſt ſong mighty pretty,
and ſaid ſhe would buy it, if ſhe could but remember the tune: and the
old lady ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that there was a great deal of good company indeed; but
the gentlemen were ſo rude, that they perfectly put her out of countenance by
ſtaring at her through their ſpy-glaſſes. In a word, the tarts, the
cheeſecakes, the beef, the chicken, the ounce of ham, and every thing,
ſeemed to have been quite forgot, till the diſmal moment approached, that
the reckoning was called for. As this ſolemn buſineſs concerns only the
gentlemen, the ladies kept a profound ſilence; and when the terrible account
was brought, they left the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter undiſturbed to enjoy the miſery by
himſelf: only the old lady had the hardineſs to ſquint at the ſum
total, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared 
<q rend="inline">"it was pretty reaſonable
<hi>conſidering.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>OUR citizen bore his misfortunes with a tolerable degree of
patience: he ſhook his head as he run over every article, and ſwore he
would never buy meat by the ounce again. At length, when he had carefully
ſummed up every figure, he bade the drawer bring change for ſix-pence: then
pulling out a leathern purſe from a ſnug pocket in the inſide of his
waiſtcoat, he drew out ſlowly, piece by piece, thirteen ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings; which
he regularly placed in two rows upon the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. When the change was brought,
after counting it very carefully, he laid down four half-pence in the ſame
exact or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; then calling the waiter,— 
<q rend="inline">"there, ſays he, there's your
damage—thirteen and two-pence—And hearkye, there's three-pence over
for yourſelf."</q> The remaining penny he <pb n="408" facs="tcp:1252700301:415"/> put into his
coat-pocket; and chinking it— 
<q rend="inline">"this, ſays he, will ſerve me to-morrow to
buy a paper of tobacco."</q>
               </p>
               <p>THE family now prepared themſelves for going; and as there
were ſome ſlight drops of rain, madam buttoned up the old gentleman's coat,
that he might not ſpoil his laced waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat, and made him flap his hat,
over which ſhe tyed his pocket handkerchief, to ſave his wig: and as the
coat itſelf, (ſhe ſaid) had never been worn but three Sundays, ſhe even
parted with her own Cardinal, and ſpread it the wrong ſide out over his
ſhoulders. In theſe accoutrements he ſallied forth, accompanied by his
wife with her upper petticoat thrown over her head, and his daughters with the
ſkirts of their gowns turned up, and their heads muffled up in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured
handkerchiefs. I followed them quite out of the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and as they were
waiting for their hack to draw up, the youngeſt miſs aſked, 
<q rend="inline">"When ſhall we come again, papa?—</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Come again? (ſaid he) what a pox would you
ruin me? Once in one's life is enough; and I think I have done very handſome.
Why it would not have coſt me above four-pence half-penny to have ſpent my
evening at <hi>Sots Hole:</hi> and what with the curſed coach hire, and all
together, here's almoſt a pound gone, and nothing to ſhow for it."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Fye, Mr. <hi>Roſe,</hi> I am quite aſhamed
for you,"</q> replies the old lady. 
<q rend="inline">"You are always grudging me and your girls the
leaſt bit of pleaſure: and you cannot help grumbling, if we do but go to
<hi>Little Hornſey</hi> to drink tea. I am ſure, now they are women grown
up, they ought to ſee a little of the world;—and they SHALL."</q> The
old don was not willing to purſue the argument any further; and the coach
coming up, he was glad to put an end to the diſpute by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,— 
<q rend="inline">"Come, come, let us make haſte, wife; or we

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N a viſit which I paid the other day to a lady of great
ſenſe and taſte, I was agreeably ſurpriſed by having two little
volumes put into my hands, which have been lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed under the title
of "POEMS by <hi>EMINENT LADIES.</hi>" Theſe volumes are, indeed, (as the
author of the preface has remarked) 
<q rend="inline">"the moſt ſolid compliment, that can
poſſibly be paid to the fair ſex."</q> I never imagined, that our nation
could boaſt ſo many excellent Poeteſſes, (whoſe works are an honour
to their country) as I found are here collected together: And it is with the
higheſt ſatisfaction I can aſſure my female readers in particular, that
I have found a great number of very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant pieces among the writings of
theſe ladies, which cannot be ſurpaſſed by the moſt celebrated of our
male-writers.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="410" facs="tcp:1252700301:417"/>THE pleaſure, which I received from
reading theſe poems, made ſuch an impreſſion on my mind, that at night,
as ſoon as I fell aſleep, my fancy preſented to me the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Dream.
I was tranſported, I know not how, to the regions of <hi>Parnaſſus</hi>;
and found myſelf in the Court of <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſurrounded by a great
number of our moſt eminent poets. A cauſe of the utmoſt importance was
then depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the debate was, whether the ladies, who had
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed themſelves in poetry, ſhould be allowed to hold the
ſame rank, and have the ſame honours paid them, with the men. As the
moderns were not allowed to plead in their own ſuit, <hi>Juvenal</hi> was
retained on the ſide of the male poets, and <hi>Sappho</hi> pleaded in
defence of the other ſex. The <hi>Roman</hi> ſatiriſt in his ſpeech at
the bar inveighed bitterly againſt women in general, and particularly
exclaimed againſt their dabbling in literature: but when <hi>Sappho</hi> came
to ſet forth the pretenſions, which the ladies juſtly had to poetry, and
eſpecially in love affairs, <hi>Apollo</hi> could no longer reſiſt the
importunity of the <hi>Muſes</hi> in favour of their own ſex. He therefore
decreed, that all thoſe females, who thought themſelves able to manage
<hi>Pegaſus,</hi> ſhould immediately ſhew their ſkill and dexterity in
riding him.</p>
               <p>PEGASUS was accordingly brought out of the ſtable, and the
<hi>Muſes</hi> furniſhed him with a ſide-ſaddle. All the ladies, who
had courage enough to venture on his back, were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to mount: but as a
great diſpute aroſe among ſome of the competitors about precedency, (each
of them claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a right to ride firſt,) it was at length agreed, that they
ſhould get into the ſaddle according to ſeniority.</p>
               <p>UPON this a lady advanced; who, though ſhe had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
rather extravagant in her air and deportment, yet ſhe <pb n="411" facs="tcp:1252700301:418"/>
had a noble preſence, that commanded at once our awe and admiration. She was
dreſſed in an old-faſhioned habit, very fantaſtic, and trimmed with
bugles and points; ſuch as was worn in the times of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
firſt. This lady, I was informed, was the Dutcheſs of NEWCASTLE. When ſhe
came to mount, ſhe ſprung into the ſaddle with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing agility;
and giving an entire looſe to the reins, <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſus</hi> directly ſet
up a gallop, and run away with her quite out of our ſight. However, it was
acknowledged, that ſhe kept a firm ſeat, even when the horſe went at his
deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt rate; and that ſhe wanted nothing but to ride with a curb-bridle.
When ſhe came to diſmount, <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> and <hi>Milton</hi> very
kindly offered their hand to help her down, which ſhe accepted. Then
<hi>Euterpe</hi> came up to her with a ſmile, and begged her to repeat
thoſe beautiful lines againſt Melancholy, which (ſhe ſaid) were ſo
extremely pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque. The Dutcheſs, with a moſt pleaſing air,
imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately began—

time. Her dreſs was ſimple, though of a very elegant make: it had no
profuſe ornaments, and approached very nearly to the cut and faſhion of the
preſent age. Though ſhe never ventured beyond a canter or an hand-gallop,
ſhe made <hi>Pegaſus</hi> do his paces with ſo much eaſe and
exactneſs, that <hi>Waller</hi> owned he could never bring him under ſo
much command. After her Mrs. KILLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GREW, aſſiſted by <hi>Dryden,</hi> and

agreed, that (making ſome allowances for their ſex) they could not be

acroſs it, ſaying that ſhe would never ride him but aſtride. She made

               <p>I HAD now the pleaſure to ſee many ladies of our own times,
whoſe names I was very well acquainted with, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance towards
<hi>Pegaſus.</hi> Among the reſt I could not but wonder at the
aſtoniſhing dexterity, with which the admired Mrs LEAPOR of
<hi>Brackley</hi> guided the horſe, though ſhe had not the leaſt
direction or aſſiſtance from any body. Mrs. BARBER of <hi>Ireland</hi>
was aſſiſted in getting upon the ſaddle by <hi>Swift</hi> himſelf,
who even condeſcended to hold the ſtirrup while ſhe mounted. Under the
Dean's direction ſhe made the horſe to pace and amble very prettily:
notwithſtanding <pb n="414" facs="tcp:1252700301:421"/> which ſome declared, that ſhe was
not equal to her friend and country-woman Mrs. GRIERSON.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER lady, a native of the ſame kingdom, then briſkly
ſtepped up to <hi>Pegaſus</hi>; and deſpiſing the weak efforts of her
huſband to prevent her, ſhe boldly jumped into the ſaddle, and whipping
and cutting rode away furiouſly helter ſkelter over hedge and ditch, and
trampled on every body who came in her road. She took particular delight in
driving the poor horſe, who kicked and winced all the while, into the moſt
filthy places; where ſhe made him fling about the dirt and mire, with which
ſhe beſpattered almoſt every one that came near her. Sometimes, however,
ſhe would put a ſtop to this mad career; and then ſhe plainly convinced
us, that ſhe knew as well how to manage <hi>Pegaſus</hi> as any of the
females, who had tried before her. Being told that this lady was no other than
the celebrated biographer of her own actions Mrs. PILKINGTON, I had the
curioſity to take a nearer view of her; when ſtepping up towards her, and
offering my aſſiſtance to help her down, methought ſhe returned my
civility with ſuch an uncourteous ſlap on the face, that (though I awaked
at the inſtant) I could not help fancying for ſome time, that I felt my
cheek tingle with the blow.</p>

               <p>THE contents of the poſtſcript I naturally referred to the
conſideration of my publiſher, who conſequently had a right to determine
on the goodneſs of my friend's eſſay: but, whatever was the reaſon, I
heard no more of it. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce between bookſeller and author is, indeed,
of very great ſervice, eſpecially to the latter: for though I myſelf
muſt undoubtedly be excepted out of the number, yet it muſt be
confeſſed, that the moſt famous wits have owed their ſupport to this
pecuniary intercourſe. Meat and drink, and the other conveniences of life,
are as neceſſary to an author, as pen, ink and paper: and I remember to
have ſeen in the poſſeſſion of Mr. <hi>Tonſon</hi> a curious
manuſcript of the great <hi>Dryden</hi> himſelf, wherein he petitions his
book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller to advance a ſum of money to his taylor.</p>
               <p>THE next letter comes likewiſe from an author, who complains
of an evil, which does not, indeed, often affect many of our fraternity; I
mean, the cuſtom of giving money to ſervants. Had this practice prevailed

                     <p>I HAVE been happy all this winter in having the run of a
nobleman's table, who was pleaſed to patronize a work of mine, and to which
he allowed me the honour of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing his name in a dedication. We
geniuſſes have a ſpirit, you know, far beyond our pockets: and (beſides
the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary expence of new cloaths to appear decent) I aſſure you I
have laid out every farthing, that I ever received from his lordſhip, in tips
to his ſervants. After every dinner I was forced to run the gauntlet through
a long line of powdered pick-pockets; and I could not but look upon it as a
very ridiculous circumſtance, that I ſhould be obliged to give money to a
fellow, who was dreſſed much finer than my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. In ſuch a caſe, I am
apt to conſider the ſhowy waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat of a foppiſh footman or butler out
of livery, as laced down with the ſhillings and half-crowns of the gueſts.
I would therefore beg of you, Mr. TOWN, to recommend the poor author's caſe
to the conſideration of the gentlemen of the cloth; humbly praying, that they
would be pleaſed to let us go ſcot-free as well as the clergy: for though a
good meal is in truth a very comfortable thing to us, it is enough to blunt the
edge of our appetites, to conſider that, we muſt afterwards pay ſo dear
for our ordinary.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I HAVE taken the pains as uſual to read your paper, and as
you receive letters, I thought proper among the reſt to ſend one alſo, to
let you know that I did not know that a cat was capable of conſtituting a
religious ſociety before. A prieſt may, tis true; and ſo may another
rational creature, and perhaps an old woman alſo. But, ſir, you argue, that
what a <hi>French</hi> fool or lunatic ſays on this head, is true; but you
make more out, I obſerve, from the old woman and the leathern apron, than you
do of the cat. For, if old women will, or does conſtitute a religious
ſociety, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand from the foundation you ſeem to argue, that you
are as much an old woman as they. For to argue or reaſon from an old woman's
ſtory, and for all your learning, and policy, and cunningneſs, and judgment
you ſeem to have, you have but little of yourſelf: and as you ſeem to
ridicule religion, and compare it to atheiſm or lunacy, I would beg the
favour to know, ſir, what religion You are of: but by your talk I fear you
are of none at all. This New Doctrine, ſir, that you revile, is the real
goſpel, which you will find ſo, if you hear it, and compare it with the
ſcriptures, if you believe any ſcripture at all. For you ſay, ſir, that
the moſt extraordinary tenets of religion are very ſucceſsfully
propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated under the ſanction of leathern aprons inſtead of caſſocks.
Well, and ſuppoſe it is: you acknowledge it is received by well
diſpoſed people; and if it is, then it is plain, us you ridicule it, you
are not one of theſe well diſpoſed. But, ſir, this New Doctrine, as you
call it, is not only propagated <pb n="419" facs="tcp:1252700301:426"/> under the ſanction of
leathern aprons, by barbers, brick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layers, and the like, but by many of the
clergy now in the eſtabliſhed church: and if you often went to hear them,
but not as a critic to carp at what is there ſpoken, you would underſtand
more what this New Doctrine meant, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it drives men to
enthuſiaſm, and the like, or no. Sir, what you touch on the Moravians, I
will not ſay any thing about or againſt; for perhaps it is too true. But,
ſir, I would adviſe you to know a little more of religion experimentally
for yourſelf, before you pretend to condemn others. And, ſir, if you are
informed, that there will be a mad-houſe built on the ground where the
Foundery ſtands, or the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodiſts meeting-houſe, as you call it,
perhaps there may be as many criticiſing lunatics in it, as religious ones;
and very likely more. Sir, I beg you would take care, you don't bother your
brains too much about other peoples affairs; leſt I ſhould have the pain,
not the pleaſure, of ſeeing you there. I have juſt given you a ſketch
of the ridiculing the New Doctrine, and wiſh you could find ſome better
employ, if ſo be it was with a leathern apron before you; for I think it
would become you better than this point does. Sir, I hope you will excuſe my
freedom with you, as others muſt yours with them.</p>

               <p>THE laſt letter, which I ſhall add, comes from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
correſpondent, who has already obliged me more than once, if I may judge from
the hand-writing.</p>

                     <p>SOME time ago you archly remarked that there was not one
<hi>Woman</hi> left, but that the whole ſex was elevated into
<hi>Ladies.</hi> You might at the ſame time have taken notice 
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:1252700301:427"/> of the wonderful increaſe among the other ſex in the
order of GENTLEMEN. Beſides thoſe, who are univerſally acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged of
this rank from their birth and ſituation in life, the courteſy of
<hi>England</hi> alſo entitles all perſons who carry arms to that dignity:
ſo that his Majeſty's three regiments of guards are compoſed entirely of
Gentlemen; and every prig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſh fellow, who can clap a queüe to his
peruke, and hang a ſword aukwardly dangling by his ſide, from thence
aſſumes the importance as well as name of a Gentleman. Idleneſs and
ignorance being too often the diſgrace of thoſe, who are Gentlemen born and
bred, many inveſt themſelves with that dignity, though with no other
qualifications. If the pride, poverty, or neglect of parents, has prevented
their ſon from being bound 'prentice, or if the idle raſcal has ſhewn his
indentures a light pair of heels, in either caſe <hi>Tom</hi> is of no trade,
and conſequently a Gentleman. I know at this time a man, who came from
<hi>Ireland</hi> laſt ſummer with a hayfork, but before winter raiſed
himſelf to the rank of a Gentleman: and every day I go to
<hi>Windmill-ſtreet,</hi> I ſee a very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Gentleman betting large
ſums of money, whom I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly remember Marker of the Tennis Court. Add to
this, that all attorneys clerks, prentices, and the like, are Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen every
evening; and the citizen, who drudges all the reſt of the week behind the
counter, every ſunday, together with his laced waiſtcoat and ruffles, puts
on the Gentleman. Every author, Mr. TOWN, is a Gentleman, if not an Eſquire,
by his profeſſion; and all the players, from King <hi>Richard</hi> to the
<hi>Lieutenant of the Tower,</hi> are Gentlemen. The body of Gentlemen is
ſtill more numerous; but I have not leiſure at preſent to climb up to
garrets, or dive into cellars after them: I ſhall only obſerve, that many
of the above-mentioned members of this order die with the ſame reputation
that they lived, and go out of the world like 'Squire <hi>Maclean,</hi> or
Gentleman <hi>Harry.</hi>
