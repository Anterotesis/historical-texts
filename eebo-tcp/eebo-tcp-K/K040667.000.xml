            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This is (in his own Words) all that he ſays about it: Which, for the Benefit of thoſe that don't underſtand <hi>French,</hi> I ſhall tranſlate into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> thus:</p>
            <p>
               <q>"He ſays, he had a Child about two Years old, who had a Stone in the Bladder as big as a Hen's Egg, brought to him to cut: He uſed all his Dexterity to force the Stone down to the Neck of the Bladder, but found it impoſſible to be done: The Child was in that Torture and Miſery, that the Parents wiſhed him rather dead, than he ſhould live longer in ſo doleful a Condition. <hi>De Franco,</hi> on the other Hand, thinking it would tend to his Diſhonour not to take away the Stone, at laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to make Tryal, whether he could not bring it to the very Groin, which he did, by putting his Fingers into the Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dament, and raiſing up the Stone, he caus'd his Servant, on the other Side oppoſite to him, to preſs it down to the Place in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for Inciſion; which he made, took out the Stone, and, tho' the Child was
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0153200200:5"/>very weak, recover'd him, and heal'd the Wound: But he adviſes others not to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low his Example; and, inſtead of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends the Operation which he calls his own Invention, and has deſcrib'd, in the foregoing Part of the ſame Chapter."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The next to him, that's ſaid to have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd it, is one <hi>Bonnet,</hi> of whom Monſ. <hi>Tollet,</hi> in the 5th Edition of his <hi>Lithotomy,</hi> publiſh'd at <hi>Paris</hi> 1708, gives the following Account, Page 139.</p>
            <p>
               <q>"<hi>Feu M.</hi> Jonnot <hi>m'a dit autrefois que M.</hi> Bonnet <hi>Chirurgien, qui praetiquoit il ya tres-long-temps la Lithotomie dans l'</hi> Hôtel Dieu <hi>de</hi> Paris, <hi>l'avoit aſſuré d'en avoir taillé de cette faaeon. M.</hi> Petit, <hi>Maitre Chirurgien faaeon de cet Hoſpital mà dit l'avoir vu pratique ſur une Petite fille par le même M.</hi> Bonnet."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>"Mr. <hi>Tollet</hi> ſays, that the late Mr. <hi>Jonnot</hi> (who was alſo a famous <hi>Lithotomiſt</hi>) told him formerly, that Mr. <hi>Bonnet,</hi> a Surgeon, who practis'd <hi>Lithotomy</hi> a conſiderable Time ago in the <hi>Hotel Dieu</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> aſſur'd him, (<hi>viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Jonnot</hi>) that he had cut after that Manner. Mr. <hi>Petit,</hi> Maſter-Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of that Hoſpital, alſo told our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, that he had ſeen it practiſed by the ſame <hi>Bonnet</hi> on a young Girl."</q>

            <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0153200200:6"/>
            <p>Monſ. <hi>Dionis,</hi> in the 2d Edition of his <hi>Courſe of Chirurgical Operations,</hi> publiſh'd at <hi>Paris</hi> 1714, Page 139, gives the following Account of the ſame Man, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>"<hi>On nous aſſure que Monſieur</hi> Bonnet <hi>a pratiqué ſovent cette Operation à l'</hi>Hôtel Dieu <hi>de</hi> Paris <hi>avec une heureux ſuccés, &amp; que même Monſieur Petit luy a vû faire.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>"We are aſſur'd, that Monſ. <hi>Bonnet,</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and with good Succeſs, perform'd this Operation at the <hi>Hotel Dieu</hi> in <hi>Paris;</hi> and that Monſ. <hi>Petit</hi> has ſeen him perform it."</q> This is all the Account that I have met with of this <hi>Bonnet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After him, Dr. <hi>Groenevelt</hi> was the next that perform'd it, of which he gives the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Account in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Edition of his <hi>Lithotomy,</hi> publiſh'd at <hi>London</hi> in 1710.</p>
            <p>
               <q>"I once had a Patient in <hi>Long Lane, Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields,</hi> upon whom I was oblig'd to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form this High Operation; and very ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully extracted the Stone, by making Inciſion near the Groin, the Patient ſoon recovering; which ſhews, that Wounds in the fibrous Part of the Bladder are not always mortal."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thoſe are the only Three that I have met with, that ever pretended to have cut above the <hi>Os Pubis, i. e.</hi> into the Belly.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0153200200:7"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Franco</hi> cut ſo firſt, becauſe he had a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient that he could not cut his own Way, tho', at the ſame Time, he had the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of one of the beſt <hi>Lithotomiſts</hi> of his Age. But tho' he ſucceeded, yet, it ſeems, he found ſuch Difficulties in it, that he would never do't again, and charges us never to follow his Example; which one would have expected that he ſhould have explain'd in his Account of it, the better to deter others from the like Practice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Bonnet</hi> is ſaid to have done it ſeveral Times with Succeſs; yet he don't recommend it to others as a Rule of Practice, nor was ever imitated by any of his Contemporaries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Groenevelt</hi> did it but once, and ſays, he was oblig'd to do it: I ſuppoſe, in ſome ſuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like Caſe as <hi>De Franco</hi>'s; and though he alſo ſucceeded, yet, inſtead of recommending it, he only draws this Conſequence from it, <hi>viz.</hi> That Wounds of the fibrous Part of the Bladder are not always mortal.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Franco</hi> cut on the Hair above the <hi>Pubis,</hi> a little on one Side; <hi>Groenevelt</hi> near the Groin: But not one of them tells us what luſtruments they uſed, or which Way they uſed them; whether they made a croſs, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, or longitudinal Inciſion; whether they made the Inciſion at once, or at ſeveral Times, or what Poſition they put their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient in; all which, and many more Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ought to have been exactly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrib'd, before any one could be ſaid to have
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0153200200:8"/>follow'd their Method; from whence I may very ſafely infer, that it will be no eaſy matter to tell which Way any of them made their Operations, and yet it's commonly aſſerted with the greateſt Aſſurance (not with any Deſign to raiſe <hi>De Franco</hi>'s Reputation, but to leſſen mine) that I made this Operation after <hi>De Franco</hi>'s Method, though he has told but very little of his Story, and I have told none of mine.</p>
            <p>Upon the Whole, I muſt ſay, that it's a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to me, that after ſo much Succeſs, either they, or thoſe that ſaw them do it, did not ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther continue the Practice of it, or give us more ſubſtantial Reaſons why they diſapprov'd of it; ſo far from that, they have not given us one Inſtance of a Patient's dying after this Section.</p>
            <p>This Operation is alſo recommended as a very probable Way by <hi>Rouſſecus, Dionis,</hi> &amp;c. yet not one of them was ever ſo far perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of it as to make the Experiment, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſeveral of them have undertaken (which none that ever made the Operation thought fit to do) to deſcribe the Method how it may be done, <hi>i. e.</hi> to teach others to perform what they can't do themſelves; (which, in my Opinion is the greateſt Abſurdity in Nature;) but to what Purpoſe, he that makes the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment will ſee.</p>
            <p>Having thus recited all the Inſtances that I have met with of the Stone in the Bladder, being extracted through the Belly, in the Words of the Authors, That every one may
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0153200200:9"/>be a Judge of the Encouragement I had to undertake this Operation from what has been done this Way before.</p>
            <p>I ſhall next give an Account of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections made againſt the fore-mention'd Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemens Operations, by ſome of the moſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Authors that have mention'd them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Some ſay that the Urine from the Bladder, and the Diſcharge from the Wound, will flow into the Cavity of the <hi>Abdomen</hi> or <hi>Pelvis,</hi> where Corrupting, will occaſion ſeveral grievous and incurable Symptoms, amongſt whom is Dr. <hi>Drelincount,</hi> &amp;c. who expreſſes himſelf thus:</p>
            <p>
               <q>"<hi>Operatio Franconiana ut inventa eſt ſic exolevit, quia dum perfunderetur Veſicae fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Urina Effluebat in Abdominis Cavum &amp; Mortem inducit,</hi> i. e."</q>

            <p>
               <q>"The <hi>Franconian</hi> Section, <hi>viz.</hi> the high Operation, died aſſoon as it was invented; becauſe when the Fund of the Bladder is perforated, the Urine flows into the Cavity of the Belly and cauſes Death."</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Others ſay that the Wound being made in the membranous Part of the Bladder, won't heal again, amongſt whom is <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bett,</hi> &amp;c. who has theſe Words:</p>

            </p>
            <p>
               <q>"Beſides the common Ways of Cutting, there's one <hi>Fr. Rouſettus,</hi> who affirms in his Book of the <hi>Caeſarian</hi> Birth, that the Operation would be ſafer and eaſier, if we cut through the Belly (a little below the Navel, and on one Side) and into the Bladder, and then extracted the Stone through the Wound. But that can't be, becauſe Wounds of the Bladder are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and cannot be conſolidated; altho' we have ſome Hiſtories of their being cur'd,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0153200200:12"/>it's a great Rarity, and therefore it's too raſh an Undertaking; and becauſe no Body practiſes it, I'll ſay no more on't."</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Anſwer to all which (not to deſcend to Particulars) is the happy Succeſs of my Operation.</p>
            <p>The next Queſtion that naturally follows, is, What could incite or encourage me to undertake this high Operation, which thoſe that had done it, had ſuch an indifferent Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of, which thoſe eminent Authors (juſt quoted, and almoſt every one elſe that have mention'd it) exclaim'd ſo warmly againſt, and which, by the common Conſent of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, was deem'd impracticable?</p>
            <p>To which I anſwer: That it was, firſt, becauſe I was fully perſwaded that the great Danger, Tediouſneſs, and frequent bad Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of the common Operations, were entirely owing to the Structure of the Parts concern'd, which the beſt Operator could not avoid, if the Stone was of any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable Bigneſs, or of a rugged irregular Figure.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Becauſe I was as firmly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded, that all the Objections made againſt the fore mention'd Gentlemens Operations, (ſo far as they concern mine) were very ill grounded; which is prov'd by the Succeſs.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0153200200:13"/>
            <p>The Two Operations that are only in Uſe now amongſt us are, <hi>Firſt,</hi> That which Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons call Cutting on the Staffe, <hi>i. e.</hi> When a furrow'd Probe is paſs'd into the Bladder, upon which they afterwards Cut.</p>
            <p>The other is call'd cutting on the Gripe, <hi>i. e.</hi> When they paſs their Fingers into the Fundament, and preſs the Stone outwards, and then cut upon it.</p>
            <p>In order to explain what I have juſt now aſſerted, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Danger, Tediouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the common Operations, are entirely owing to the Structure of the Parts concern'd. I ſhall firſt deſcribe the Parts concern'd in each, and then make ſuch Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions as naturally follow therefrom.</p>
            <p>Cutting on the Staffe is moſt in Uſe, and therefore I ſhall begin with it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parts concern'd in Cutting on the Staffe, or Great Apparatus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parts Cut:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>They cut firſt through the Skin, on one ſide of the <hi>Rapha</hi> of the <hi>Perinaeum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> Through the <hi>Accelerator Muſcle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> Through the Bulb of the <hi>Urethra.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Parts that are dilated.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Inciſion being made, opens a Paſſage into the membranous Part of the <hi>Uretha,</hi> at the upper-end of which is the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the Bladder, through both which the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0153200200:14"/>muſt paſs into the Bladder, and the Stone, tho' enlarg'd by the Thickneſs of the <hi>Forceps,</hi> muſt paſs out.</p>
            <p>They are both apt to be too much dilated by a large, and lacerated by a rugged Stone.</p>
            <p>The membranous <hi>Urethra,</hi> is about Two Inches long, more or leſs, according to the Bigneſs of the Perſon.</p>
            <p>It's about as big (in a middle-ſiz'd Man) as to admit of a Gooſe Quill.</p>
            <p>It's much longer, and not ſo thick and ſtrong, as the <hi>Urethra</hi> in Women, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more liable to be injur'd.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Sphincter</hi> is a few circular Fibres; which keep the Bladder ſhut, and ſo prevents the involuntary Diſcharge of the Urine.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Genital Parts, which by the Nearneſs of their Situation are liable to be injur'd, next after the foremention'd, are:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The <hi>Veſiculae Seminales,</hi> i. e. the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervatories of the Seed: They are ſituate im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately behind the <hi>Sphincter,</hi> between the Bladder and <hi>Rectum,</hi> i. e. the ſtraight Gut.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Their <hi>Ducts;</hi> which paſs from them, and open about the Middle of the membranous Part of the <hi>Urethra,</hi> by Two Orifices, which are cover'd by a ſort of a Caruncle, call'd, <hi>Caput Gallinaginis,</hi> or <hi>Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montanum;</hi> which ſerves inſtead of <hi>Valves,</hi> to hinder the involuntary emiſſion of the Seed.</p>
            <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0153200200:15"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The <hi>Proſtatae;</hi> which are ſituate a Little below the <hi>Veſiculae Seminoles,</hi> between the membranous <hi>Urethra</hi> and ſtraight Gut.</p>
            <p>The Structure and Situation of the Parts being thus ſtated, it will not be difficult to deduce all die foremention'd Inconveniencies from them, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Danger of this Operation (to ſay no more) will appear from a Computati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Number of thoſe that do and do not eſcape after it; which is (in general) oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd by the Length and Streightneſs of the Paſſage before deſcrib'd, Figure and Bigneſs of the Stones, Force requir'd to extract them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whence the foremention'd Parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are lacerated and contuſed to too great a Degree, and thence exceſſive Pain, Hemorrhagy, Loſs of Strength, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> too great to be maſter'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Every one that has made, or ſeen any Number of theſe Operations perform'd, cannot but be ſenſible of the Tediouſneſs of them (and conſequently of the Pain the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient muſt needs ſuffer) which is owing to the Length and Streightneſs of the Paſſage (which cannot be alter'd, as is commonly ſuppos'd, by enlarging the External Orifice,) Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and Neceſſary Largeneſs of the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments uſed; Number, Bigneſs, and Figure of the Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The bad Conſequences that fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently follow this Operation (in thoſe that
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0153200200:16"/>eſcape with Life) are, <hi>Incontinency of Urine, Impotency, Fiſtula's, &amp;c.</hi> which every one muſt be ſatisfy'd of, that have ſeen any Number of them: In ſome of whom you'll obſerve <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <div type="section">
               <head>Cauſe of the Incontinency of Urine.</head>
               <p>It's cauſed when the Sphincter of the Blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der is over-ſtretched by the Bigneſs, or lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by the Aſperitys of the Stone; becauſe it can never afterwards do its Office as before; And ſo the Urine flows involuntarily Day and Night; which keeps them always wet, from whence none of the moſt agreeable Scents ariſe.</p>
            </div>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Cauſe of the Impotency.</head>
               <p>It's occaſion'd by the Laceration of the Ducts of the <hi>Veſiculae Seminales,</hi> or the <hi>Veru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montanum;</hi> and that by the Bigneſs or Aſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritys of the Stone, as before: So when the Wound heals, the Ducts, or <hi>Verumonta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num;</hi> are ſtopp'd by the <hi>Callous,</hi> ſo that the Seed can no more flow into the <hi>Urethra.</hi>

               <head>Cauſe of Fiſtula's.</head>
               <p>Theſe Parts are Membranous, Nervous, or Spermatick, as Authors call them, and, of Courſe, very unapt to heal when wounded, lacerated, or contuſed; which is alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd by the conſtant Paſſage of the Urine, Gravel, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thro' the Wound, and ſo they turn fiſtulous; and then all or a great Part of the Urine, which ſhould paſs thro' the Yard, paſſes thro' the Fiſtula left in the Wound; whence People are made nauſeous to themſelves and others.</p>
               <p>The Great <hi>Hildanus, pag.</hi> 733, expreſſes the Danger of this Operation in theſe Words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>"<hi>Ingens ac magnus Calculus ut per Collum Veſicae extrabatur, propter ejus anguſtiam longum requirit tempus, interim aeger ingen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tibus affligitur Doloribus, Veſica, ipſiuſque Fibrae dilacerantur, Sanguis copioſè profluit, vires diſſolvuntur, maximoque cum Cruciatu aeger vel in ipſa Operatione aut paulò poſt extinguitur,</hi> i. e."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>"When a large Stone is extracted through the Neck of the Bladder, becauſe of its Streightneſs, it takes up a long Time: In the mean Time, the Patient ſuffers intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Pain, the Bladder and its Fibres are
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0153200200:18"/>tore, there's a great Flux of Blood, Loſs of Strength, and the Patient, by reaſon of the great Torture, dies, either in or ſoon after the Operation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The late Mr. <hi>Couper,</hi> in his Comment upon <hi>Bidloo,</hi> has the following Obſervations on the Accidents which happen from the Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of the Parts.</p>
               <p>
                  <q>"This Part of the <hi>Urethra, viz.</hi> that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Proſtatae</hi> and the <hi>Bulb,</hi> is liable to be wounded, and ſometimes perforated, by too haſtily introducing the Conductor into the Bladder, after an Inciſion is made in the <hi>Perinaeum</hi> in Cutting for the Stone; whereby the Operator afterwards thruſts his <hi>Forceps</hi> between the Bladder and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>"This Inadvertency, I'm perſuaded, is very often practiſed by the Pretenders to <hi>Lithotomy,</hi> and frequently proves fatal to the Patient: One would think it hardly poſſible, that a Man in his Senſes, and but tolerably acquainted with Anatomy, could commit ſuch Errors; yet, of this I have met with more than one Inſtance, when being called to diſſect the Deceaſed, in whom ſuch Operators have been ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate as to leave the Stone ſtill in the Bladder."</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0153200200:19"/>
               <p>So much to ſhew the unavoidable Danger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Cutting on the <hi>Staffe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The other Operation in uſe is Cutting on the <hi>Gripe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Parts cut.</p>
               <p>They cut (farther off of the <hi>Rapha</hi> of the <hi>Perinaeum</hi> than in the foregoing Operation) 1. Through the Skin: 2. The Fat: 3. Part of the <hi>Erector Penis:</hi> 4. Some confiderable Blood-Veſſels: 5. A Part of the <hi>Levator Ani:</hi> 6. Into the Body of the Bladder above the <hi>Sphincter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Operation can't always be practis'd, becauſe our Fingers are not long enough to bring down and keep the Stone faſt againſt the <hi>Perinaeum</hi> in grown People. Though, when it can be done,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Inconveniencies of it are,</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. When the Stone is rough, it's trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, painful, and tedious, to make the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion on it.</item>
                  <item>2. The Arteries, which are cut, are often very large.</item>
                  <item>3. When the Stone is rough, it pricks, and contuſes the Bladder in ſeveral Places, by being preſſed hard againſt the <hi>Perinaeum;</hi> whence ſeveral dangerous and deadly Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms enſue.</item>
                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0153200200:20"/>
                  <item>4. The Wound in the Bladder being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, is hinder'd from aglutinating, by the Gravel and Urine paſſing thro' it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>From all which, I think 'tis evident, that the rare Succeſs of theſe Operations, even in the beſt of Hands, (not to mention the Havock that is often made by Pretenders) is entirely owing to the Structure of the Parts concern'd; which is what I undertook to prove.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Advantages of this new Operation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas, in the other Operations, the Danger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are owing to the Structure of the Parts; in my Operation, by reaſon of the Structure of the Parts, they are ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully prevented. <hi>E. G.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. There can be no Impotency cauſed by it, becauſe there's none of the Genital Parts can be injur'd in doing it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There can be no Incontinency of Urine caus'd by it, becauſe the <hi>Sphincter</hi> of the Bladder cannot be hurt in making it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. There can be no Fiſtula after it, if pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Care is taken of the Wound.</p>
               <p n="4">4. There can be no ſuch Force requir'd to extract the Stone, as will contuſe and lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the Parts, which, in the other Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are the Cauſe of Symptoms too hard to be govern'd) becauſe the Wound may be
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0153200200:21"/>made as large as you pleaſe, which can't be done in them.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There can't be any Flux of Blood, becauſe there's no Occaſion to cut any of the great Veſſels, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus the Defects of the others are ſupply'd by this.</p>
               <p>My Patient was between ſixteen and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen Years of Age, and was cut two Days before laſt <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> and in a Month's Time the Wound was perfectly cicatriz'd, <hi>i.e.</hi> healed.</p>
               <p>The Operation was over in one Minute, and I believe will never be above two.</p>
               <p>He now performs all his natural Faculties as well as he had never been troubled with the Stone.</p>
               <p>There were two Phyſicians, two Surgeons, and an Apothecary, preſent at the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: But to ſave them the Trouble of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering every little Prig's impertinent Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, I don't think it's proper to mention them.</p>

                  <q>"<hi>De quarto operandi modo, in</hi> Lithotomia <hi>uſitato, qui merito</hi> Lithotomia Franconiana <hi>appellari poteſt.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo he goes on to deſcribe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend that Operation, which <hi>De Franco</hi> owns in the 33d Chapter of his Book, to be his proper Invention: But it's not the <hi>High,</hi> but an Operation in the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> that's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum'd by the one, and commended by the other.</p>
               <p>In Page 732, he has theſe Words:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>"Franciſcus Rouſettus <hi>Lib. de partu</hi> Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio <hi>concludere voluit, ſemper calculum eo in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0153200200:24"/>Loco exſecandum eſſe, illudque minori cum pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riculo fieri poſſe.</hi> Lithotomiam <hi>proinde illam</hi> Franconianam <hi>vocat, cum tamen D.</hi> Franc. <hi>eam minimè ad Imitationem praeſcripſerit, ſed expreſſè in Libro ſuo, ſe ſtolide egiſſe fateatur, adeoque unumquemque, ne ipſum hac in parte imitetur, ſed precedentem operandi modum amplectatur, Hortetur.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>"<hi>Franciſcus Rouſettus,</hi> in his Book on the <hi>Caeſarian</hi> Birth, aſſerts, that we ought al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways to cut for the Stone through the lower Part of the Belly, becauſe it can be done with a great deal leſs Danger; and then calls it <hi>De Franco</hi>'s Method, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding <hi>De Franco</hi> never preſcrib'd it as a Rule; ſo far from which, he confeſſes in his own Book, that he acted fooliſhly in doing it; and therefore adviſes us never to imitate him in it, but in the Operation juſt before deſcrib'd."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He concludes his Story thus:</p>
               <p>
                  <q>"<hi>Cum dicto igitur D.</hi> Franco, <hi>fideli atque induſtrio cuivis Chirurgo periculoſae hujus</hi> Lithotomiae <hi>Adminiſtrationem iterum atque iterum diſſuadeo.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>"Therefore, with the foremention'd <hi>De Franco,</hi> I again and again diſſuade every faithful and induſtrious Surgeon from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming this dangerous Operation."</q>
               </p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0153200200:25"/>
               <p>From all which I conclude, that inſtead of being an Honour to <hi>De Franco,</hi> to have had his Name put to it, it would have been a real Injury to the Memory of the Dead, to have made him the Author of an Operation, that he blam'd himſelf for doing when alive.</p>
               <p>Nay, I'm ſo far from having an Opinion of <hi>De Franco</hi>'s Operation, as he has deſcrib'd it, that I think it's fully as inconſiſtent and impracticable as <hi>Talicotius</hi>'s Project of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring loſt Noſes.</p>
               <p>All the Analogy between his and mine, is, that they are both made in the Belly. But his was made in one Place of the Belly, and mine in another: His, with his own Inſtruments, (which he has not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd) mine with mine: His were uſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter one Manner, mine after another: And thoſe, I think, are the moſt material Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences betwixt any two Operations, <hi>viz.</hi> The Variation of the Place upon which the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is made, of the Number, Figure, and Size of the Inſtruments, and of the Method of uſing them.</p>
               <p>The two foremention'd Operations, call'd, Cutting on the <hi>Staffe,</hi> and Cutting on the <hi>Gripe,</hi> are both made on the <hi>Perinaeum:</hi> The Deſign of both is the ſame, <hi>viz.</hi> To extract
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0153200200:26"/>the Stone out of the Bladder; yet no Man ever was ſo abſurd as to call them both the ſame Operations, for the Reaſons before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd.</p>
               <p>The late famous Mr. <hi>Rau,</hi> Profeſſor of Phyſick and Surgery at <hi>Leyden,</hi> and the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd <hi>De Franco,</hi> and ſeveral others, as <hi>Celſus, Guido, Marianus, &amp;c.</hi> had each a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Method of Cutting on the <hi>Perinaeum,</hi> to which every one gave his own Name, and why ſhould not I be allow'd the ſame Liberty.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing that my Operation was, in every Tittle, the ſame as <hi>De Franco</hi>'s; yet, if it's found to be a ſafer and eaſier Way of relieving the Miſerable, it's nevertheleſs new; for that Operation was as much dead, before mine, and thought as much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, (which the general Opinion of the Town on this Occaſion abundantly proves) as it was 150 Years before <hi>De Franco</hi> was born.</p>
               <p>I readily grant, that one Operation, tho' ſucceſsfully perform'd, is not enough to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the Publick that it's the ſafeſt Method; but it's enough to me, who, before the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, thought myſelf very ſure of Succeſs, elſe I had never attempted it. But now I have perform'd it, and ſeen the whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Cure, I'm in no manner of Pain
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0153200200:27"/>about the future Succeſs of if; nay, I dare venture to prophecy, that not one in ten will die, nor one in fifty want a perfect Cure, that do after the common Methods; and there fore do (what never any did before) recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it as the moſt eaſy ſafe, and ſpeedy Method of extracting the Stone, (excluſive of all others) in Males, and when the Stone is large, in Females.</p>
               <p>I have had a great many vile, malicious and ſalfe Reflections caſt upon me, on this Occaſion, by a Set of <hi>Scioli,</hi> who (becauſe they never did anything out of the common Road themſelves) envy every Man elſe that does.</p>
               <p>The Imputation of Novelty (ſays the great Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>) is a terrible Charge among thoſe who judge of Mens Heads, as they do of their Perukes, by the Faſhion, and can allow none to be right but the receiv'd Doctrines. Truth ſcarce ever carry'd it by Vote any where at its firſt Appearance: New Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions are always ſuſpected, and uſually op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, without any other Reaſon, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are not already common: But Truth, like Gold, is not the leſs ſo, for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing newly brought out of the Mine.</p>
