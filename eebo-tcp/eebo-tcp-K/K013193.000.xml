            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>SHORT ESSAY, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THOUGH there is nothing ſhould leſs plead for an apology to the public than addreſſing them on what ſo immediately and import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly concerns them, the <hi>continuance and reſtoration of their health;</hi> yet in a metropolis like this, — where the <hi>neceſſitous,</hi> the <hi>ignorant,</hi> and <hi>adventurous</hi> are every hour practiſing on the conſtitutions of their fellow-creatures;—the moſt diſtant poſſibility of my being claſſed in this number would have prevented this addreſs, was I not at the ſame time ſo conſcious, from many years abſolute experience in a variety of caſes, of the ſuperior efficacy of this medicine; that, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted from all other conſiderations, I ſhould hold myſelf chargeable, in point of duty, to omit making it as univerſal as poſſible.</p>
            <p>Upon this principle, then, and the corroborating ſucceſs of this medicine for many years I beg leave to recommend to the Public
<q>NORRIS's ANTIMONIAL DROPS;</q> which, upon a certainty of their compoſition and ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary effects, I pronounce a <hi>ſpecific</hi> in the following
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0492000400:4"/>diſorders — <hi>Inflammatory Fevers, Putrid Bilious Fevers, Slow Latent</hi> (commonly called) <hi>Nervous Fevers,</hi> and <hi>Putrid Sore Throats,</hi> &amp;c. inſomuch that, in a vaſt variety of caſes, where life has been often deſpaired of, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome of the moſt reſpectable of the faculty, there has been no one inſtance (at leaſt that has ever come to my knowledge) of their being found ineffectual.</p>
            <p>I am however aware, that, from the <hi>title</hi> of this medicine, many may have their doubts; as <hi>Antimony,</hi> of all other phyſical productions, has been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as the moſt violent, and dangerous in it's effects: I will not contradict this popular appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion; on the contrary, I think it generally well founded; but this I will pledge myſelf to ſay, that from my particular manner of preparing it, it's <hi>efficacy</hi> can only be equalled by it's <hi>ſafety;</hi> that it is a medicine of ſuch ſingular or <hi>unique</hi> quality, that it may be taken with equal ſafety in infancy or old age, by delicate or robuſt conſtitutions in ſmall or large quantities; and ſo far from producing any of thoſe violent operations, the uſual effects of Antimony, it recovers nature in the moſt friendly manner imaginable, operating without any ſenſible difference than a degree of perſpiration, &amp;c. propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the neceſſity of the diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>It is to be lamented, that, upon many occaſions, in fevers, phyſicians are obliged to wait for what they call the criſis of the diſorder, and many days are often elapſed in this intermediate, doubtful ſtate, before any thing can be pronounced in reſpect to an opinion on the patient; but this medicine is ſo immediate, yet
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0492000400:5"/>innocent, in it's effects, that it waits for no criſis or particular period; it may be taken in the firſt, mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle, or latter ſtages of the diſorder, and in any quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities, with ſafety; in ſhort, it wants but to meet the diſeaſe to give it an abſolute overthrow.</p>
            <p>From theſe <hi>poſitive</hi> declarations, I am not inſen2ible what a riſque I may be thought to run, both in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to my own character and fortune; and indeed I ſhould feel myſelf unworthy not only of the public patronage I have received, but of the common bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of mankind, could I be ſo loſt to my own honour and conſcience, for the mere ſake of intereſted views, thus to recommend a medicine, which I even remotely doubted of it's ſucceſs; but the repeated proofs I have had of it's <hi>never-failing efficacy,</hi> it's immediate, powerful, and ſafe effects, all give me a conſciouſneſs of communicating it to the world under the moſt po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive and certain aſſurances.</p>
            <p>Theſe drops, beſides being a ſpecific for fevers, I have often known ſucceed in a variety of other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, ſuch as <hi>bad digeſtion, nervous head-aches, latent ſcurvies,</hi> (the ſource of many evils) and infallably in <hi>gouty habits,</hi> where <hi>inſenſible perſpiration</hi> is ſuppreſſed. And indeed when the extent of their powers, as an univerſal deobſtruent, which lead to a general ſtrengthening and reſtoration of nature, are conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, the univerſality of their effects will ceaſe to be wondered at.</p>
            <p>Having thus given a ſummary account of the virtues of theſe <hi>Antimonial Drops,</hi> I am aware of the objections which will naturally ariſe from a compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0492000400:6"/>view of the general mode of medicinal admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, and that which prevails in this eſſay: I am likewiſe aware of the formidable oppoſition which every great diſcovery in medicine muſt unavoidably meet with, not only from it's oppoſition to eſtabliſhed practice, but the uncharitable endeavours of intereſted men, who, under the ſpecious pretence of it's not being in <hi>common uſe,</hi> have invariably reprobated all ſuch (however beneficial to mankind) as dangerous or uncertain. Though the <hi>uſe</hi> of theſe <hi>Antimonial Drops</hi> would be a convincing anſwer to ſuch inſinuations; yet, as many have not experienced their effects; and as I would willingly obviate every difficulty, as well for the ſake of my own reputation as the ſatisfaction of the Public; I ſhall ſubmit the following apology for my conduct.</p>
            <p>It is generally objected to thoſe, who have labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through a painful courſe of years, and have been at great expences in the diſcovery, and preparation of medicine, that to make a myſtery for private emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what ſo eſſentially affects public benefit, is repugnant to thoſe principles of univerſal charity, which ſhould actuate the human breaſt:—This, at firſt bluſh, I own ſeems plauſible, but then it ſhould be conſidered, that the <hi>means</hi> of throwing this into <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Uſe,</hi> may deſtroy its effects; as the excellency of a medicine depends not ſo much on the ſubject from which it is taken, as the great care and judgement in the preparation. A common chemiſt, in ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the neceſſary period of preparation, diſpenſing with accidents ſubſtituting apparently-ſimilar bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0492000400:7"/>or by any of thoſe various means, which may ſave his time, or increaſe his profits, may think himſelf ſufficiently juſtified for ſo doing by <hi>the uſage of trade:</hi> But the more careful chemiſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious that the leaſt accident or miſmanagement is frequently ſufficient to extinguiſh the virtues of his proceſs, and having nothing ſo much at heart, as the credit of his medicine, is barred by no labour, no time, no expences, no diſappointments, in bringing to perfection this his favourite object.</p>
            <p>Permit me then to rank myſelf in this laſt claſs, who, from dedicating the beſt part of my life to Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical proceſſes, muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed to be well acquainted with the minuteſt preparation of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine; and on the credit of this experience let me add; that, what from the judgment and accuracy required, together with the many accidents to which it is liable, the proceſs of my <hi>Antimonial Drops</hi> can ſcarcely be compleated in the way of <hi>Common buſineſs.</hi> This conſideration then alone, I flatter myſelf, will fully juſtify my conduct to the judicious and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial part of mankind.</p>
            <p>I have already been ſufficiently explicit in enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merating the virtues of this medicine; I do not therefore mean to take up any more of the attention of the Public; otherwiſe, than as the PRESERVATION and RESTORATION of health form the principal and greateſt bleſſing of life, that they ſtrictly examine into it's merits. If it turns out to be productive of thoſe benefits I have mentioned; ſurely I cannot be thought preſuming to expect that a public reward ſhould follow ſo public a benefit. If on the contrary I ſhould
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0492000400:8"/>be found one of thoſe forward daring empyricks, who are heedleſs what ſacrifices they make to their own intereſts; let me be branded with that infamy, which thoſe who endeavour to deceive mankind in ſuch important matters deſerve.</p>
            <p>And here I beg leave to requeſt all thoſe who have honoured me with their confidence, and who by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience or obſervation are vouchers of the efficacy of this medicine, to favor me with their names and addreſs, that, by the permitted publication of ſuch authority, to be from time to time added to this eſſay, I may be the better enabled to render as univerſal as poſſible ſo great a benefit to mankind.</p>

                     <p>MY ſervant was delirious, and in all reſpects ſo bad in an Inflammatory Fever, attended with a putrid diſpoſition, that it was generally thought ſhe could not recover; but on taking theſe Drops ſhe preſently began to mend, and the continuance of one ſmall bottle perfected her cure.</p>

                     <p>A daughter of mine, ſixteen years of age, of a delicate conſtitution, was laſt autumn ſeized with a Putrid Fever and ſore throat; ſo rapid was the diſeaſe in it's progreſs, that ſhe was near a diſſolution before your Drops were adminiſtered.

                     <p>MR. <hi>F.</hi> a reſpectable tradeſman in the city of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. His daughter, a weakly delicate child, about five years of age, was ſorely afflicted with a ſwelled ſtomach, and conſtipation in her bowels; together with indigeſtion, a Slow Fever, and a ſharp corroſive humour in her blood. To the inexpreſſible joy of her parents, who had deſpaired of her recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſhe is happily reſtored to health, by the virtues of this invaluable medicine. Two of his ſervants were cured of a Putrid Fever; the one in his own houſe, very ſpeedily, and went about his buſineſs in a few days; the other ſoon after was attacked with the ſame diſorder: for reaſons beſt known to his maſter he ſent him to Iſlington, and put him under the care of an apothecary there, but hearing very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favorable accounts of him daily, he went to ſee him, and ſent for the apothecary, who told him, among other things, that his Fever was a very dangerous one, and muſt wait for a criſis, &amp;c. This not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing ſatisfactory to the old gentleman, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged the apothecary, and immediately ſent for me.
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0492000400:14"/>Let it ſuffice to ſay that I was under the neceſſity of giving this young man three times more in quantity of the Drops than is ordinarily preſcribed, before the deſired effect was produced; he began to take them about eight o clock in the morning, and between that and five in the evening he had taken four fifths of a half guinea bottle, without their having the leaſt ſenſible effect; he then called for a large baſon of tea, which he drank, and about ſix had a very profuſe ſweat, in which he continued the whole night, and ſlept comfortably. I made him a viſit the next day, and found him equal to my wiſhes; and the day following pronounced him out of danger, which I reported to his maſter. In a week or ten days after I ſaw him about his buſineſs.</p>

               <p>This young man after bleeding, bliſtering, leeches applied to his temples, and every other means in common practice made uſe of to no good purpoſe; his brother, with whom he lives, was adviſed to try in this deſperate caſe my Antimonial Drops; he made ſome enquiries about me at the Carolina Coffee-houſe in Birchin-lane, where I frequently go when in the city; ſatisfied with Mr. Carr's, and ſeveral gentlemens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of me there, the Drops were immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter'd according to directions; the next day I happened to call at the coffee-houſe, when Mr. Carr, who keeps it, after reciting what had paſt, was ſorry to inform me the young man was no better, and then paſt all hope; that as I was ſo near he thought it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeable I ſhould call; I did; and, never did I ſee a human being ſo near death: I could feel no pulſe; he lay on his back with his eyes wide open and fixed, ſpeechleſs, and motionleſs to all appearance. Being the firſt inſtance of my Antimonial Drops failing in Fevers, at leaſt that ever came to my knowledge, made me more particularly inquiſitive about the adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, when, (to my great ſurprize) the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my patient aſſured me with much concern, they

There was no time to be loſt in reproof; it was now one o'clock at noon, I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſpatched a meſſenger to Mr. Parker's, for a half guinea bottle of Drops, a table ſpoonful of which was poured down that inſtant, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, if he lived an hour and an half, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it, and continue to give him that quantity every two hours after, till a ſweat or ſome viſible ſigns of amendment were diſcovered; and then to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the doſe gradually; that no other medicine ſhould be adminiſtered on any account, but, to let him have as much baum tea, or any ſimple di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting liquor as they could get down, by little and little, every now and then; the blunder committed before, made them now doubly diligent and punctual; I called the next day, and found the Fever was quite gone; but ſuch a laſſitude and ſtupidity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained as exceeds all deſcription. The nurſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me he lay very quiet till five o'clock; about ſix, he began to perſpire, and continued ſo to do the whole night plentifully; ſleeping all the time; which from his laying very ſtill and motionleſs, and as ſhe thought breathleſs too, made her ſeveral times conclude he was dead, till by laying on her hand every now and then ſhe was ſatisfied to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. I then ordered the Drops to be given very ſparingly, not above twenty or thirty, every two or three hours, till I called the next day, when I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced him out of danger, and ordered him to be

When he arrived at St. Kitt's the doctor quitted the ſhip, and the captain then had about ſeventy ſlaves left, which he was to take to Carolina: in the paſſage ten or twelve of them were ſeized with the ſame Fever the others died of; being then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſurgeon, he had recourſe to my Antimonial Drops, which recovered them; verily believing, if
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0492000400:21"/>timely adminiſtered, nine out of ten of thoſe that were loſt might have been ſaved. Theſe Drops were ſent, by way of experiment, at the inſtance of a worthy gentleman, a merchant in the city, much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in African affairs, and under the peculiar care of Captain Reynolds, the only one, he ſaid, he could depend upon to make a juſt report; before which, and ſince, ſeveral ſmall boxes were ſent to merchants at Liverpool, for the ſame purpoſe, and ſome few from the port of London alſo; but, ſtrange to tell! when immediately under the care and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the ſurgeon, all their influence were gone, and they became of none effect. It would be no very eaſy matter to prevail upon many commanders of ſhips who ſail without ſurgeons, to credit this report from their own experience. This I am very well aſſured of, and could venture my credit, reputation, and fortune, upon the event, that if the ſurgeons of ſhips were actuated by the ſame diſintereſted principles; my Antimonial Drops would prove a great acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion not only to the African company in preſerving their negroes, but the lives of thouſands ſubject to putrid fevers in hot climates.</p>

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0492000400:22"/>of the effects of your Antimonial Drops, in the courſe of my late voyage to and from Falkland's Iſland.</p>
                     <p>In the outward paſſage, by the ſurgeon of the ſhip's report to me, of the 5th of April laſt, it appeared, that Geo. Hunter, and Laur.

                     <p>On the 27th of July following, being in the ſouthern part of the Torrid zone, Mr. Joſlin, the boatſwain of the ſhip, was taken ill of the ſame Fever, with the like ſymptoms as the two former, and after the ſurgeon had repreſented to me, that he had uſed all the means in his power for his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0492000400:23"/>to no purpoſe, the Antimonial Drops were given, and had the deſired effect, by his imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate recovery.</p>
                     <p>Sometime afterwards, in the ſouthern ocean, Ja.

                     </opener>
                     <p>THY favour, with a box of Antimonial Drops, I received by means of our Friend Eyre, about 16 laſt 12 mo. They have gained great reputation in theſe parts, and being the time of our general aſſembly in Newbern, and my own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance being very extenſive in this province, I had an opportunity of recommending them to many people; carried ſome to our good governor Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin. Immediately on receiving them, I gave ſome to my own child, about two years old, who was feveriſh, and much out of order. Every one in my family could obſerve a ſudden change for the better: I have continued to give him a few at times, and the child is brave and hearty. Another child, about twelve months old, that had been long ſick, had loſt all appetite, I adviſed them, which in a few days recovered his health and appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite. A negro man in my own employ, about 23 years of age, by much wading in the water, got a ſevere pleuriſy; it being about 20 miles from where I reſide myſelf, they bled him, after ſome days ſweated him; he went out before his ſweat was off, and grew ſo bad, they ſent me word they thought he would die. I immediately diſpatched orders to
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0492000400:26"/>give him the Antimonial drops, and he ſoon reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
                     <p>Two perſons, that had them of me, were cured of ſtubborn coughs, which, I believe, would ſoon have terminated in conſumptions.</p>
                     <p>A married woman, not with child, catched a conſiderable cold, which occaſioned a ſuppreſſion of the m—, with fever and great pains. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the uſe of the drops, which ſoon abated the pains, fever, and head-ach, and in about two days time ſet nature to act for herſelf in the natural way.</p>
                     <p>I mention thoſe few particulars, more for the conviction of others than thy own confirmation. Indeed, for my own part, I believe the drops to be the moſt ſovereign remedy ever yet found out, for what thou recommends them, and may prove advantageous in many caſes which are not mentioned in thy directions."</p>

                     <p>AS you ſeem deſirous of communicating to the public the obſervations which have been made by thoſe who have either taken themſelves, or adminiſtered to others, your Antimonial prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, (of which ſo formidable a notion has been entertained) I cannot but think it incumbent on me, in conſequence of the good effects I have experienced from it, both in myſelf and family, to tranſmit you a ſhort account of the reſult. With regard to myſelf, my conſtitution is rather valetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, and has been ſo as long as I can remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. It is now about fifteen years ſince it was firſt invaded by the gout, which I think I may call hereditary, as I cannot accuſe myſelf of any irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities adequate to the ſeverity with which I have been viſited by this formidable enemy.</p>
                     <p>Among many cauſes that combine to bring on the gout, I was always of opinion, that <hi>an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrncted perſpiration was one.</hi> To remove this, I was adviſed, <hi>when perſpiration was ſuppreſſed, to take your Antimonial Drops frequently and plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully; theſe, by promoting a good digeſtion, and it's conſequent attendant, a briſk circulation of the fluids, kept open my pores, which before, upon any ſudden change in the air from heat to cold, were generally cloſed.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the fits of the gout I frequently take them in ſmall quantities, and find them <hi>promote, aſſiſted
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0492000400:29"/>by ſmall dilutive liquors, ſenſible perſpiration in a high degree; and, upon any uneaſy ſenſations in the ſtomach or bowels, during the fit, they ſeldom fail to remove the cauſe.</hi> In Fevers, either Putrid or Inflammatory, frequent occaſions have offered to try their effects in a numerous family of my own; and, from repeated experience, I never found them fail of ſucceſs, and that by removing the diſeaſe in a very few days.</p>
                     <p>Thus much I am warranted to ſay in their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and think them poſſeſſed of much greater virtues than even I have deſcribed.</p>
