            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE History, and Present State of China, as far as relates to its government, its sciences, and its arts, has long been considered worthy of the deepest research; and much information has been collected on these subjects, with considerable labour and expence, under the auspices of several of the most powerful courts in Europe. If the natural productions of that country have attracted less attention, it is only because their value and importance are less generally known; upon better acquaintance they would at once excite our astonishment, and convince us of their utility.</p>
            <p>General readers are sometimes disposed to consider the Insect World as too minute and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous to deserve investigation. Let them remember, however, that to a foreign Insect the staple commodity of this kingdom is indebted for its richest dye; that from another we derive the most costly articles of dress, and splendid ornaments of luxury; and the utility of many others is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in various branches of medicine, the arts, and domestic economy.</p>
            <p>Prompted by these reflections, the Author determined to submit to the Public a Series of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravings illustrative of the Entomology of China.—But flattering as the prospect of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to his project appeared, he would not presume to publish his Work till the result of the late Embassy of Earl Macartney to that country was fully known: of that the public are now in pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session; and, though, in common with every friend to the commercial advantages and scientific inquiries of this country, the Author must regret its issue, it is perhaps, on the whole, more favourable to the present Publication than if the event had been different. If indeed a more general intercourse had been established between the two nations, and the language of China had been better understood, it is impossible to calculate the advantages which Entomology, amongst other sciences, might have derived; for the Chinese, like their neighbours the Japanese, are well acquainted with the natural productions of their empire, and Zoology and Botany, in particular, are favourite studies amongst them. To what degree of excellence they have arrived in their scientific researches we are not informed, but we must not affect to despise the instruction of a people amongst whom the most useful arts, and sciences, first dawned and acquired a high degree of perfection, when "Europe had scarcely a few savages scattered over her forests."</p>
            <p>The few, but interesting hints, which Sir George Staunton has given on the practical Ento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mology of China, induces us to look forward to a period when some of the Insects, as well as Plants, of that vast empire may be no less objects of curiosity, than of national utility and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; the Chinese Cochineal Insect<note n="a" place="bottom">Dr. Anderson has found eight species of Cocci at Madras. One of these, he says, was found on a young citron-tree, Citrus Sinensis, just landed from China; it was more deeply intersected between the alxlominal rings than any of thoſe of the coast, and he names it therefore C. Diacopeis.—<hi>Collection of Letters from Madras, Jan.</hi> 28, 1788.—The Cactus Cochinilifer has lately been found by Mr. Kincaid, at Canton; its Chineſe name is <hi>Pau wang.</hi>—This has been transmitted to the <hi>Nopalry</hi> of the Hon. East India Company, at Madras, and promises to be of future advantage to the commercial concerns of Great Britain. We have been unable to procure any of the Chinese Cochineal insects, and purposely omit that species which Sir G. Staunton has noticed, because it has no relation to the productions of China.</note> and that from which the wax of the cast is procured, 
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:3"/>are two species that deserve particular attention. The medical precepts of the Chinese will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly find few votaries in Europe, but as articles of medicine, amongst others, the Meloe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chorei, which were the cantharides of the ancients, and are now used by the Chinese, may be of importance, as it possesses more virtues than the Meloe Vesicatorius used in our pharmacy: the Curculio regalis, Buprestis vittata, and many others, are also employed in articles of jewellery in the eastern parts of the world, and may vie with the richest gems in beauty and splendour.</p>
            <p>These observations we presumed to offer on the Entomology of China, in submitting the Design of this undertaking to the public. We have solicitously endeavoured to gratify the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riosity and expectation such observations were calculated to excite, and trust not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>successfully. On the economical purposes of the Chinese Insects we can offer little except con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures; those may, however, assist the inquiries of future observers; and the general reader will not be disposed to regard it with less favour, if novelty and beauty supply the deficiency of useful information. It embraces, in one view, a variety of the most uncommon and brilliant species of that fertile region, portrayed in an elegant and faithful manner; and classically arranged accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the favourite system of <hi>Linnaeus.</hi> Thus, whilst our Epitome of the Chinese Insects ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits a splendid display of this beauteous race, it may insensibly lead to a comprehensive survey of the system itself; and, by conveying instruction in its most pleasing form, facilitate the study of this charming, but much neglected science.</p>
            <p>From its commencement, the Author has been encouraged by the liberal attention of several persons, whose names would reflect honour on this undertaking, were he at liberty to mention them. He has already observed that his own collection includes several thousand specimens, collected by amateurs of the first celebrity<note n="b" place="bottom">The late Duchess Dowager of Portland, —Tunstall, Esq. Governor Holford, Smeethman, Ellis, Keate, Yeats, Forster, Baily, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
               </note>. To this he may add, that every other collection he was desirous of consulting, has been kindly open to his inspection; and every information com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated with a readiness that merits his warmest thanks. Amongst these, he cannot refrain noticing the valuable collection of Drawings and MSS before alluded to; the specimens of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sects collected in the journey of his Excellency Earl MACARTNEY, in the late embassy to China; and the very magnificent collections of Mr. FRANCILLON and Mr. DRURY, from both of whom he had unreserved permission to figure and describe whatever his own cabinet could not furnish. And, finally, he must own himself particularly indebted to the favours of the Right Hon. Sir J. BANKS, Bart. K. B. whose invaluable cabinet and library have afforded him every assistance in completing his design, and for which he begs leave to testify his most grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful acknowledgments.</p>

                     <p>S. Moloſſus and S. Bucephalus are very common in China. The firſt ſeems a local ſpecies, the latter is ſaid to be found in other parts of the Eaſt Indies. <hi>Olivier</hi> has given three varieties of Scarabaeus Moloſſus. The ſpecimen figured in the annexed plate is the <hi>var. c.</hi> of that author.</p>
                     <p>The larvae of the larger kinds of coleopterous inſects, abounding in unctuous moiſture, are not leſs eſteemed as food among ſome modern nations, than they were by the epicures of antiquity.

                        </note> larva is an article of luxurious food; and in China moſt inſects in that ſtate are appropriated to the ſame purpoſe. Thus alſo the Romans introduced the larvae of the Lucani<note n="b" place="bottom">Stag beetles.</note> and Cerambyes<note n="c" place="bottom">Capricorn, or Goat beetles.</note> in their voluptuous repaſts; previouſly feeding them on farinaceous ſubſtances to give conſiſtence to the animal juices.</p>
                     <p>The learned author of the laſt account we have of China, ſays, "Under the roots of the canes is found a large white grub, which being fried in oil is eaten as a dainty by the Chineſe." Perhaps this is the larva of Scarabaeus Moloſſus, which, like many other of the Scarabaei,<note n="d" place="bottom">The larvae of the Scarabaei live in the trunks of decayed trees, in putrid and filthy animal ſubſtances, or in the earth.

The theological definition of the two powers being independent, yet centering in one ſpirit, is implied by the figurative union of two ſexes in the Scarab. In the latter ſenſe it ſignified therefore but one omnipotent power. The Scarab, typifying Neith, was carved or painted on a
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:7"/>ring, and worn by the ſoldiers, as a token of homage to that power who diſpoſed of the fate of battles;<note n="l">Authors quote a doubtful paſſage in <hi>Herapollo Hieroglyph. lib.</hi> 1. to ſupport this opinion. That ſuch rings were worn by the ancient Egyptians is beyond conjecture, many remains of them, and ſome very perfect, have been found in the ſubterranean caverns and ſepulchres in the Plain of Mummies near Saccara and Giza. Thoſe which we have examined, are remarkable for the convexity, or full <hi>relievo</hi> of the figure ſculptured on them, in ſome it is of the natural ſize of the inſect, but generally ſmaller; the ſtone, cornelian, without a rim, and turning on a ſwivel ring of gold.</note> and ſculptured on aſtronomical tables, or on columns,<note n="m" place="bottom">Linnaeus ſays the Scarabaeus facer is ſculptured on the antique Egyptian columns in Rome.

Nat.</hi> Does Linnaeus allude to any remains of thoſe coloſſal obeliſks, which Auguſtus tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to Rome when he ſubjugated Egypt, or others of more recent date? It would increaſe the intereſt of our enquiries, to learn, that the Scarabaeus was among the hieroglyphics, on the two very ancient obeliſks, carried from Heliopolis, the city of the Sun.
<p>The indefinite and viſionary interpretations, impoſed on moſt Egyptian hieroglyphics through a long ſeries of ages, will barely ſupport a few conjectures on their original ſignification. Thoſe which related to local incidents, hiſtory, or the arts, are veiled in profound obſcurity. The phaenomena of nature, and aſtronomical calculations, inſcribed in thoſe characters, are ſcarcely better underſtood, though the knowledge of thoſe ſciences have been in part handed down to us from the learned Egyptians in remote ages. We are informed by ancient writers, that the Scarabaeus engraved on the aſtronomical tables of theſe people, implied the divine Wiſdom which governed the motion and order of the celeſtial bodies; that thoſe tables were huge and maſſy ſtones, or columns of granite, with the characters and figures, large, and highly emboſſed; in ſhort, ſuch as were ſuppoſed capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of long reſiſtance to the corroding hand of time. Among thoſe the Scarab was probably the moſt conſpicuous, its ſize gigantic, and the figure frequently repeated; for this we have obſerved, even on ſmall Egyptian antiques.</p>
                           <p>Various valuable remains of tablets, with figures of the <hi>Scarabaeus ſacer,</hi> are preſerved in the Britiſh Muſeum and other col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections of antiquities in this country. Thoſe we have examined are of various deſcriptions, ſome ſmaller than the inſect itſelf, others of a monſtrous ſize. The ſtones on which they are ſculptured generally <hi>green nephritic</hi> or <hi>jade ſtone,</hi> or a kind of <hi>baſaltes,</hi> and black marble; the figure <hi>baſſo relievo,</hi> on a tablet or ſlab, but oftener in <hi>relievo,</hi> with the prominent characters of the inſect very accurately defined, particularly the ſix dentations of the clypeo, and thoſe of the tibiae. The reverſe of the emboſſed ſide is flat and ſmooth, and abounds in characters altogether unknown, though, from the number of religious objects of worſhip occaſionally interſperſed, we may preſume they contain an ample ſtore of the ancient ſacerdotal language: the moſt remarkable were the ſcarab, the ſceptre and eye,<note n="a" place="bottom">
                                 <hi>Oſyris,</hi> or the ſun.</note> the human figure with a dog's head,<note n="b" place="bottom">Anubis.</note> the hawk,<note n="c" place="bottom">

                           <p>The digreſſion on the mythological hiſtory of this inſect may be conſidered by ſome as a tedious deviation from the purſuit of the naturaliſt; with others we truſt it will be more favourably received; for it proves to the unprejudiced mind how deeply the hiſtory of nature, and in the preſent inſtance the ſcience of Entomology, involves a moſt important enquiry into the firſt philoſophical opinions of the human race.

                     <p>The Bupreſtides form an extenſive, and moſt brilliant tribe of coleopterous inſects. Braſil and New Holland produce ſome gigantic ſpecies, but none more beautiful than thoſe of India. We need adduce no other proof of this, than Bupreſtis chryſis, ſternicorus, attenuata, ocellata, and vittata. Theſe wrought into various devices, and trinkets, decorate the dreſſes<note n="x" place="bottom">A pair of ſlippers embroidered with little pieces of the wing caſes of this inſect is preſerved in the Leverian Muſeum</note> of the natives in many parts of India. The Bupreſtis vittata in particular, is much admired among them. It is, we believe, entirely peculiar to China, where it is found in vaſt abundance, and diſtributed from thence at a low price among the other Indians. The Chineſe, who always profit by the curioſity of Europeans, collect vaſt quantities of this Bupreſtis, and other gay inſects, in the interior of the country, and traffic with them.</p>
                     <p>A conſiderable error ſeems to have ariſen concerning this ſpecies, and the true Bupreſtis ignita of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus. All authors, except Fabricius and Olivier, have conſidered the Bupreſtis vittata, and ignita, the ſame. Fabricius, in his <hi>Species Inſectorum,</hi> refers to <hi>Muſ. Dom. Banks</hi> only, for the Bupreſtis vittata; and to the 14th figure, plate 6, in <hi>Sulzer</hi>'s work, for a figure of Bupreſtis ignita. In the <hi>Entomologia Syſtematica</hi> we however find the ſame reference to the figure of <hi>Sulzer,</hi> for B. vittata<note n="y" place="bottom">Vol. 1. part 2. p. 186. 5.</note>; and, to increaſe the perplexity, preciſely the ſame reference under that of B. ignita<note n="z" place="bottom">Vol. 1. part 2. p. 192. 28.</note> alſo.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:0808300200:24"/>The Bupreſtis ignita of Linnaeus, we imagined, was unknown in the cabinets of the curious in this country, till we diſcovered an inſect nearly correſponding in character with it, in the collection of Mr. Drury, and which we preſume is the B. ignita, or at leaſt a variety of it. It has not the brilliance of colours that ſo eminently diſtinguiſhes B. vittata, but in form and ſize it agrees with it. The only figure of that ſpecies is given by Olivier, from a ſpecimen formerly in the cabinet of Gigot d'Orcy, of Paris. We have exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the ſpecimen in the cabinet of Sir J. Banks, referred to by Fabricius as B. vittata, and find the figure in Sulzer is of that ſpecies, as well as the ſpecimen we have repreſented.</p>
                     <p>Fabricius has given as a part of the ſpecific diſtinction of theſe inſects, that B. ignita has <hi>three ſpines</hi> at the end of each wing caſe, or elytron, and B. vittata no more than <hi>two.</hi> This may form a ſufficient cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic in thoſe ſpecies; but we muſt remark, that it is not ſo in Bupreſtis ocellata. We have two ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens that have two ſpines at the end of each elytron, and another with three, as Fabricius has deſcribed it. We alſo find ſeveral inſects nearly allied to B. vittata, the ſtripe of gold on each ſide excepted; one of theſe has ſix teeth, another four teeth, and a third only two.</p>
                     <p>The Bupreſtides are ſuppoſed, for the moſt part, to undergo their transformations in the water, or marſhy ground.</p>

                     <p>The Bupreſtis ocellata is a native of China, and is very rare: ſpecimens of it have been found in parcels of the common ſort. Olivier ſays it is from <hi>Chandernagore</hi> in the Eaſt Indies. Mr. Drury has an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary variety of this inſect from China, in which the two ſpots unite at the future ſo as to form only one large ſpot on the back when the wing caſes are cloſed.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ſpots on the wing caſes are ſtrikingly characteriſtic of this ſpecies; at leaſt we have not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them in any other of the Bupreſtis genus. They are uſually ſituated in the centre of each elytron; are ſomewhat pellucid, and in fine ſpecimens are cream colour, ſurrounded with a crimſon circle. Theſe ſpots are ſometimes brown; probably they become ſo after the inſect dies.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:29"/>rare, but is, probably, only a variety of the other ſort. According to Olivier, the Meloe cichorei is uſed by the Chineſe in their medical preparations inſtead of the Cantharis veſicatorius of the Europeans, and is ſuppoſed to be more efficacious in certain caſes. The ſame author quotes a paſſage in <hi>Dioſcoride Med.

                           <p>The Cantharides of the ancients, are by no means to be confounded with thoſe of medical writers in the laſt century. By the term Cantharides, in an European <hi>Pharmacopeia,</hi> we underſtand the Meloe veſicatorius<note n="*" place="bottom">Geoffroy calls this a Cantharis. The Linnaean Cantharis is a diſtinct genus.</note> of Linnaeus, an inſect whoſe medicinal properties are very generally known<note n="†" place="bottom">Applied externally to raiſe bliſters. It is a violent poiſon taken inwardly, except in ſmall portions.</note>. The Cantharides of the ancients can ſcarcely be aſcertained; it was a term indiſcriminately applied to ſeveral kinds of inſects, and too often without regard to their phyſical virtues. Pliny ſpeaks of the Cantharis as a ſmall beetle that eats and conſumes corn; and of another that breeds in the tops of aſhes and wild olives, and ſhines like gold. The ancients were certainly well acquainted with our common ſort, though it is confounded with others in a general appellation<note n="‡" place="bottom">The common sort has been called <hi>Muſca Hiſpanica</hi> by ſome Latin authors, and hence Spaniſh fly by Boyle.</note>. <hi>Hippocrates, Galen, Pliny, Matthiclus,</hi> and other phyſical writers of antiquity, treat of the medicinal uſes of Cantharides; but it is not clear that they alluded to only one ſpecies<note n="§" place="bottom">Olivier endeavours to prove that the Mylabris Cichorei is the ancient Cantharides; the authority of his opinion is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible, and the inference natural, if not concluſive. But if it were in uſe, ſo alſo might the common ſort, for Dioſcoride, whom he quotes, mentions thoſe of only one colour alſo. The ancients often confounded the term Scarabaeus with Cantharis; but whether becauſe they knew that the common kinds of Scarabaei produce the ſame effects as the Cantharis, is uncertain.—<hi>The Scarabaeus auratus,</hi> and <hi>Melolontha,</hi> ſeveral <hi>Coccinellae, Cimex nigro-lineatus, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> have a place in the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> as <hi>Cantharides.</hi>

                     <p>Two figures of the Mantis, very much reſembling our ſpecies, is given in the work of Stoll on <hi>Cicadae &amp;c.</hi> one kind he calls <hi>La Mante ètroitement cornue,</hi> the other <hi>La Mante Chinoiſe ètroites cornue.</hi> The firſt is from the coaſt of Coromandel and Tranquebar, the other, as its name implies, is a Chineſe inſect.

                     <p>This Mantis is deſcribed by Fabricius only. Stoll has given the figure of an inſect not unlike it in his publication; and we have ſeen a ſpecimen ſimilar to it, which was found by Profeſſor Pallas near the Caſpian ſea. It is allied to Mantis Gongyloides, a native of Africa and Aſia, but bears a cloſer affinity to Mantis Pauperata<note n="a" place="bottom">Figured by Stoll under the name of <hi>La Mante Goutteuſe Brune?</hi>
                        </note> from Java, Molucca, and perhaps other iſlands in the Indian ſea.</p>
                     <p>Fabricius enumerates fifty-one ſpecies of this genus in his laſt ſyſtem; a conſiderable portion of theſe are from Aſia: had he included the lately diſcovered kinds in America and New Holland, his genus would have been far more comprehenſive. Few naturaliſts have had the opportunity of obſerving the manners of theſe creatures in diſtant countries; nor can we always rely on the information thoſe few have given. Of the European ſpecies we can ſpeak with more preciſion, becauſe ſome indefatigable naturaliſts have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended minutely to them; Roeſel in particular has treated at conſiderable length on the manners of the Mantis Religioſa of Linnaeus.</p>
                     <p>Deſcriptions can only convey an imperfect idea of the extraordinary appearance of many creatures in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the Mantis and Locuſta genera. Among them are found ſpecies that bear a ſimilitude to the uſual forms of other inſects; but, from theſe we almoſt imperceptibly deſcend to others, bearing as ſtrong a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude to the vegetable part of creation; ſeeming as if Nature deſigned them to unite the appearance of a vegetable with the vital functions of an animal, to preſerve them from the ravages of voracious creatures, or to connect that chain of progreſſive and univerſal being, which</p>
                     <q>" The great directing MIND of ALL ordains."</q>
                     <p>Many of theſe creatures aſſume ſo exactly the appearance of the leaves of different trees, that they fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:33"/>the entomologiſt with unerring ſpecific diſtinctions; thus we have <hi>L. citrifolia, laurifolia, myrtifolia, oleifolia, graminifolia,</hi> and others, equally expreſſive of their reſemblance in form, and colours, to the leaves of thoſe reſpective plants. Travellers in countries that produce theſe creatures, have been ſtruck with the phaenomenon, as it muſt appear, of animated vegetable ſubſtances; for the manners of the Mantis, in addition to its ſtructure, are very likely to impoſe on the ſenſes of the uninformed. They often remain on the trees for hours without motion, then ſuddenly ſpring into the air, and, when they ſettle, again appear lifeleſs. Theſe are only ſtratagems to deceive the more cautious inſects which it feeds upon; but ſome travellers who have obſerved it, have declared they ſaw the leaves of thoſe trees become living crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and take flight.</p>
                     <p>M. Merian informs us of a ſimilar opinion among the Indians, who believed theſe inſects grow like leaves on the trees, and when they were mature, looſened themſelves and crawled, or flew; away. From the credulous, and unſcientific, marvellous reports of ſuch extraordinary creatures may be expected; but, to theſe we muſt add the authority of a naturaliſt, whoſe works are a valuable addition to our preſent knowledge of the hiſtory of nature: theſe are the works of Piſo<note n="b" place="bottom">Gulielmi Piſonis, Amſterl. <hi>1657.</hi>
                        </note>.</p>
                     <p>"Thoſe little animals," ſays that author, "change into a green and tender plant, which is of two hands breadth. The feet are fixed into the ground firſt; from theſe, when neceſſary humidity is attracted, roots grow out, and ſtrike into the ground; thus they change by degrees, and in a ſhort time become a perfect plant. Sometimes only the lower part takes the nature and form of a plant, while the upper part remains as before, living and moveable: after ſome time the animal is gradually converted into a plant. In this Nature ſeems to operate in a circle, by a continual retrograde motion."</p>

<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:34"/>cenſure, let us attend to the opinion of a few authors, nearly contemporary with himſelf: we find theſe collected in the criticiſms of Roeſel on that paſſage.</p>
                     <p>From theſe it appears that the works of Piſo were much admired when firſt publiſhed, but we rely leſs implicitly on the information it contains, than his readers in the laſt century. Roeſel treats his account with more than merited ſeverity; not becauſe he could contradict the relation of Piſo, but, becauſe he had never obſerved the ſame circumſtance attend the Wandering Leaf, or Mantis Oratoria, in Europe<note n="d" place="bottom">Among the annotations on the laſt edition of Roeſel's <hi>Inſecten Belluſtigung</hi> we find one relating to this part of the works of Piſo. "<hi>Der ſeel Her geheime Rath Trew, &amp;c.</hi> Counſ. Trew aſſures Mr. Roeſel that <hi>Piſo</hi> not only very often gave out the credible obſervations of others, as his own, but himſelf believed the moſt incredible relations, and pretended to be an eye witneſs thereof." We quote this in juſtice to the remarks of Roeſel. <hi>Note in page</hi> 10, <hi>ſection Das Wandlende Blat.</hi>
                        </note>. This reaſoning is neither ſo concluſive, or liberal, as we ſhould expect from Roeſel; and more eſpecially as he afterwards deſcribes even the firſt ſymptom of the transformation as related by Piſo. When he ſpeaks of the death of the European ſpecies his words are, "As their diſſolution approaches, their green eyes become brown, and they unavoidably loſe their ſight: they remain a long while on the ſame ſpot, till at laſt they fall quite exhauſted and powerleſs, as if aſleep." What is this but ſubſtantiating part of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of Piſo, which he has laboured before to diſcredit? As to the change after they remained long on the ground, ſuch as ſending forth fibres, roots, and ſtems, from the body of the inſect, it is only aſtoniſhing ſuch a well-informed naturaliſt ſhould have deemed it matter of ſurpriſe. Could he be ignorant of the many inſtances that occur, of animal ſubſtances producing plants<note n="e" place="bottom">Such as Mucor cruſtaceus, &amp;c.</note>? or was lie not informed that the pupa which commonly ſends forth a bee, a waſp, or cicada; has ſometimes become the nidus of a plant, thrown up ſtems from the fore part of the head, and changed in every reſpect into a vegetable, though ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſhell and exterior appearance of the parent inſect at the root<note n="f" place="bottom">Specimens of theſe vegetated animals, are frequently brought from the Weſt Indies; we have one of the cicada from the pupa, as well as others produced from waſps and bees in the perfect or winged ſlate. Mr. Drury has a beetle in the perfect ſlate, from every part of which, ſmall ſtalks and ſibies have ſprouted forth; they are very different from the tufts of hair that are obſerved on a few coleopterous inſects, ſuch as the Bupreſtis ſaſcicularis, of the Cape of Good Hope; they are certainly a vegetable production.</note>? We own at firſt ſight with Roeſel that the account of Piſo ſeems " an inattentive and confounded obſervation," but that an inſect may ſtrike root into the earth, and, from the co-operation of heat, and moiſture, congenial to vegetation, produce a plant of the <hi>cryptogamia</hi> kind, cannot be diſputed. We have ſeen ſpecies of <hi>clavaria</hi> both of the undivided and branched kinds, four times larger than the inſect from which they ſprang; and can we then deny that the inſect mentioned by Piſo might not produce a plant of a proportionate magnitude? In ſhort, are we ſo well acquainted with the productions of Braſil as to contradict any of his aſſertions, concerning this transformation? Piſo does not ſay of what kind this vegetable was; it muſt ſurely be of the fungi
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:35"/>kind: reaſoning then from analogy, it might be an unknown ſpecies of <hi>clavaria</hi> with numerous and ſpreading branches; and, finally, the colour of his plant, on which authors lay much ſtreſs, might be green, though a colour not ſo predominant in that tribe of vegetables as ſome others.</p>
                     <p>The largeſt and moſt intereſting of the Indian ſpecies of Mantis is found in the iſle of Amboyna. Stoll contradicts the account of <hi>Renard</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="bottom">Poiſſons des Molucques par M. Renard, Amſterl. 1754.</note>, who ſays theſe creatures are ſometimes thirteen inches in length; but we have a ſpecimen almoſt of that ſize. It is related by Renard, and others, that the larger kinds of Mantes go in vaſt troops, croſs hills, rivers, and other obſtacles that oppoſe their march, when they are in queſt of food. If they ſubſiſted entirely on vegetables, a troop of theſe voracious creatures would deſolate the land in their excurſions; but they prefer inſects, and clear the earth of myriads that infeſt it: if theſe become ſcarce from their ravages, they fight and devour one another. When they attack the plants, they do great miſchief. It is ſaid of ſome Locuſts and Mantes that the plants they bite wither, and appear as if ſcorched with fire: we have not heard of this peſtilential property in any of the larger ſpecies of Mantes.</p>
                     <p>Of the ſmaller kinds, the Mantis Oratoria is the moſt widely diffuſed, being found in Africa and Aſia as well as in all the warmer parts of Europe. Theſe creatures are eſteemed ſacred by the vulgar in many countries, from their devout or ſupplicating poſture. The Africans worſhip them; and their trivial names in many European languages imply a ſuperſtitious reſpect for them<note n="h" place="bottom">Louva Dios by the Portugueſe. Preſque Dieu by the French.</note>.</p>
                     <p>England produces no ſpecies of this tribe. The entomologiſts in this country muſt conſequently rely on the accounts of thoſe, who have obſerved them in other parts of the world. We ſhall ſelect a few remarks from Roeſel's extenſive deſcription of Mantis Oratoria and Gongyloides, becauſe, if we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume from the analogy they bear in form to Mantis Flabellicornis, the hiſtory of one will clearly elucidate that of the other.</p>
                     <p>Roeſel ſays, ſome of the Mantes are local in Germany; they are found chiefly in the vintages at Moedting in <hi>Moravia,</hi> where they are called <hi>Weinhandel</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="bottom">Probably a provincial term for a dealer in wine.</note>. The males die in October, the females ſoon after<note n="k" place="bottom">Goetz, in his Beytrage, obſerves, that they live ſometimes ten years.</note>. The young brood are preſerved in the egg ſtate, in a kind of oblong bag, of a thick ſpongy ſubſtance; this bag is imbricated on the outſide; it is faſtened lengthwiſe to the branch of ſome plant<note n="l" place="bottom">To that of the vine in Mantis Oratoria.</note>. As the eggs ripen they are protruded through the thick ſubſtance of the bag, and the larva, which are about half an inch in length, burſt from them. Roeſel, wiſhing to obſerve the gradual progreſs of theſe creatures, to the winged ſtate, placed the bag containing the eggs in a large glaſs, which he cloſed, to prevent their eſcape. From the time they were firſt hatched they exhibited marks of a ſavage diſpoſition. He put different ſorts of plants into the glaſs, but they refuſed them, to prey on one another: this determined him to ſupply them with other inſects to eat: he put <hi>ants</hi> into the glaſs to them, but they then betrayed as much cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice,
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:36"/>as they had barbarity before; for the inſtant the Mantes ſaw the ants they tried to eſcape in every direction. By this Roeſel found the ants were the greateſt perſecutors of the Mantes. He next gave them ſome of the common muſca (houſe flies), which they ſeized with eagerneſs in their fore claws, and tore in pieces: but, though theſe creatures ſeemed very fond of the flies, they continued to deſtroy one another through ſavage wantonneſs. Deſpairing at laſt, from their daily decreaſe, of rearing any to the winged ſtate, he ſeparated them into ſmall parcels in different glaſſes; but, here, as before, the ſtrongeſt of each community deſtroyed the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Another time, he received ſeveral pair of Mantes in the winged ſtate; profiting by his former obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he put each pair [a male and female] into a ſeparate glaſs, but they ſtill ſhewed ſigns of an eternal enmity towards one another, which neither ſex nor age could ſoften; for the inſtant they were in ſight of each other, they threw up their heads, brandiſhed their fore legs, and waited the attack: they did not remain long in this poſture, for the boldeſt throwing open its wings, with the velocity of lightning, ruſhed at the other, and often tore it in pieces with the crockets and ſpines of the fore claws. Roeſel compares the attack of theſe creatures to that of two huſſars; for they dexterouſly guard and cut with the edge of the fore claws, as thoſe ſoldiers do with their ſabres, and ſometimes at a ſtroke, one cleaves the other through, or ſevers its head from the thorax. After this the conqueror devours his vanquiſhed antagoniſt.</p>
                     <p>We learn from Roeſel alſo, the manner in which this creature takes its prey, in which reſpect we find it agrees with what is related of the extra European ſpecies. The patience of this Mantis is remarkable, and the poſture to which ſuperſtition has attributed devotion, is no other, than the means it uſes to catch it. When it has fixed its eyes on an inſect, it very rarely loſes ſight of it, though it may coſt ſome hours to take. If it ſees the inſect a little beyond its reach, over its head, it ſlowly erects its long thorax, by means of the moveable membranes that connect it to the body at the baſe; then, reſting on the four poſterior legs, it gradually raiſes the anterior pair alſo; if this brings it near enough to the inſect, it throws open the laſt joint, or crocket part, and ſnaps it between the ſpines, that are ſet in rows on the ſecond joint. If it is unſucceſsful, it does not retract its arms, but holds them ſtretched out, and waits again till the inſect is within its reach, when it ſprings up and ſeizes it. This is the uncommon poſture before alluded to. Should the inſect go far from the ſpot, it flies, or crawls after it, ſlowly on the ground like a cat, and when the inſect ſtops, erects itſelf as before. They have a ſmall black pupil or ſight which moves in all directions within the parts we uſually term the eyes, ſo that it can ſee its prey in any direction without having occaſion to diſturb it, by turning its head.</p>
                     <p>The moſt prevalent colour of this tribe of inſects is fine green, but many of theſe fade or become brown after the inſect dies: ſome are finely decorated with a variety of vivid hues; the moſt beautiful of theſe, that we have ſeen, are from the Moluccas.</p>

                     <p>The Gryllus morbilloſus appears in the early addition of the <hi>Syſtema Naturae,</hi> and the works of Roeſel, as an Indian ſpecies: Mr. Drury aſſures us he has received it ſeveral times from China. Another ſort is
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:44"/>alſo found at the Cape of Good Hope, which is rather larger and deeper in colour than the Chineſe variety.</p>

The elytra are purple, variegated with yellow: the wings of a glowing crimſon, ſpotted with black.

                     <p>The phenomena reſulting from the properties and effects of light, having engaged the attention of the earlieſt philoſophers, we muſt conclude, that phoſphorical appearances, and thoſe eſpecially of animated bodies, could not fail to attract their particular notice. Indeed it is evident, from the writings of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate obſervers of nature in remote ages, that they were acquainted with certain inſects that have the property of ſhining in the night. Theſe were known only by general terms, expreſſive of that property; yet it is probable that ſome of the Linnaean lampyrides, which are abundant in the ſouth of Europe, as well as in Aſia, and ſome parts of Africa, were the firſt of the illuminated inſects known to them<note n="a" place="bottom">The lampyris of <hi>Pliny</hi> is expreſsly the inſect with a ſhining tail.</note>. Some of the males which are furniſhed with wings, and are illuminated like the ſemales, were ſtriking objects of natural hiſtory, and could ſcarcely have eſcaped their notice. The Greeks included all ſhining inſects under the name lampyris; and the Latins called them cicindela, noctiluca, luciola. lucernata, &amp;c. Whether any of the <hi>Fulgorae,</hi> were known to the ancients is uncertain: probably they were not, the moſt remarkable ſpecies being peculiar to the warmeſt parts of America. Aſia, once the feat of learning, does indeed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a few ſpecies; but we have no account of theſe in ancient natural hiſtory.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:0808300200:47"/>The Fulgorae ſeem to have been entirely unknown in Europe till the latter end of the laſt century; when two writers publiſhed deſcriptions and figures of <hi>Fulgora Lanternaria.</hi> Madame Merian, of Holland, in her ſplendid work on the Metamorphoſis of the Inſects of Surinam, and Dr. Grew, of London, in his Rarities of Greſham College.</p>
                     <p>Reaumur<note n="b" place="bottom">Memoires pour ſervir a l'Hiſtoire des Inſectes. 1734.</note> is the next author who deſcribed the <hi>Fulgora Lanternaria,</hi> and after him Roeſel, in his "Amuſing Hiſtory (or recreation) of Inſects<note n="c" place="bottom">Inſecten Beluſtigung.</note>." This brings us to the period in which <hi>Fulgora Candelaria,</hi> our Chineſe ſpecies, was firſt known in Europe: a circumſtance of much importance to naturaliſts at that time, becauſe the firſt mentioned ſpecies was a ſolitary example of its ſingular genus. The tranſactions of the Stockholm academy includes the earlieſt figure and deſcription of this extraordinary inſect; from theſe Linnaeus deſcribed it in his <hi>Syſtema Naturae;</hi> but his arrangement has undergone many alterations ſince that time. At firſt he included it among the Coleopterous inſects; then he called them Lanternariae; and again, they were claſſed with the Cicadae;. Theſe have been ſince corrected, and a new genus formed of inſects with elongated trunks on their foreheads excluſively, under the name Fulgora, a name that has been adopted by later authors, and finally by Fabricius.</p>
                     <p>Roeſel has given three figures and a deſcription of the <hi>Fulgora Candelaria;</hi> from his account we learn that it was known in England before he was acquainted with it. On its peculiar qualities, he obſerves he muſt be entirely ſilent, becauſe he had been unable to derive any information concerning it; his deſcription is notwithſtanding extremely prolix, and occupies four quarto pages; as he notices every trifling particular of the ſpots, colours, &amp;c. of the inſect. We have ſelected the moſt intereſting paſſage, becauſe it clearly marks the progreſſive advancement of the knowledge of natural hiſtory in Europe, ſo late as the middle of the preſent century.</p>
                     <p>"According to my promiſe," ſays Roeſel<note n="d" place="bottom">Verſprochener maſſen lieſeve ich nunmehr die zwente Sorte des Lanternen-Tragers, &amp;c. Vol. 1. pl. 30. Locuſt, page 189.</note>, "I now produce the ſecond ſort of Lantern-carrier, which I never ſaw before; and of which I have never read in any work on inſects. The ſcarcer however it may be, the more I am indebted to Mr. Beurer, apothecary of this place<note n="e" place="bottom">Nurenberg.</note>, &amp;c. for the permiſſion he has granted me to draw and enrich my collection with it. Mr. Collinſon has ſent it to him from London, under the name Lanternaria Chinenſis, for which reaſon I have called it the Aſiatic or Chineſe Lantern-carrier." Roeſel being a reſpectable entomological writer of his time, we muſt infer that <hi>Fulgora Candelaria</hi> was extremely ſcarce in Europe when his plate and deſcriptions were publiſhed. The commercial concerns of Europeans with the Chineſe having greatly increaſed ſince that period, has facilitated many inquiries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the natural productions of China; and a mongſt a variety of other inſects that are now uſually brought from that country, ſpecimens of Fulgora Candelaria are not uncommon. In China few inſects are found in greater abundance.</p>

De Geer gives a very conciſe deſcription, and no figure; and Seba merely obſerves, in his deſcription of Fulgora Candelaria, "La Chine produit une autre eſpéce du même genre mais beaucoup plus petite et toute differente." Edwards has given a figure of it in one of the plates in his work of Birds. His deſcription is certainly unintereſting<note n="k" place="bottom">"I take it to be a kind of fire-fly, and that part on the head the lantern.

                     <p>Having noticed the ſeveral authors who have treated on this inſect, we come to conſider the peculiar properties of its fingular genus; and among theſe we find the moſt aſtoniſhing that inſects can poſſeſs, that of emanating light: not merely a momentary ſhining appearance, as is produced by many viſcous ſubſtances, but a clear and conſtant reſemblance to the element, fire; and capable of diffuſing light to ſur-rounding objects, though totally deſtitute of every principle that can do miſchief. To the unphiloſophical mind it appears at firſt impoſſible, and it cannot fail to aſtoniſh the beſt informed. Indeed, ſome readers might be inclined to doubt the veracity of travellers in foreign countries, who have ſeen a vegetable<note n="l" place="bottom">An inſtance of this occurs its the ſouth of Europe. An account in the Philoſophical Tranſactions relates of the Dictamnus Albus (Fraxinella), that "it in the ſtill evenings of dry ſeaſons it emits a n inflammable air, or gas, and flaſhes at the appproach of a candle. There are certain inſtances of human creatures who have taken fire ſpontaneouſly, and been totally conſumed."</note> or an animal produce light, if our own country could not ſupply us with abundant analogous proofs of ſuch phaenomenae. The preſence of this animated phoſphorus, if we may ſo expreſs it, is obſerved on ſeveral inſects that are natives of England: it is needleſs to enumerate them, becauſe the moſt ſtriking example muſt be recollected by every rural inhabitant, or admirer of poetical ſimplicity.</p>

<p>"Once," ſays Madame Merian, "when the Indians brought me a number of theſe Lantern carriers, I put them into a wooden box, without being aware of their ſhining at night; but one night, being awakened by an unuſual noiſe, and much frightened, I jumped out of bed, and ordered a light, not knowing whence this noiſe proceeded. We ſoon perceived that it originated in the box, we opened with ſome inquietude, but were ſtill more alarmed, after opening it, and letting it fall on the ground, for a <hi>flame</hi> appeared to iſſue from it, which ſeemed to receive additional luſtre, as often as another inſect ſlew out of it.

It is admitted, that the <hi>Chineſe Fulgora</hi> has an illuminated appearance in the night.

                     <p>The light of the Fulgorae is generally imagined to iſſue from the trunk, or elongated projection of the forehead; but Roeſel offers a conjecture on the light of the Fulgora Lanternaria, which, on further inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigation, may enable naturaliſts to determine whether the light is entirely produced by an innate property of the trunk, or receives additional ſplendour from ſome external cauſe. He notices a white farinaceous ſubſtance on ſeveral parts of the wings and body, as well as the trunk, which, he obſerves, looks like the decayed wood which ſhines at night. We mention this conjecture of Roeſel, though the ſame occurred to us before we peruſed his obſervations. We have invariably found a ſimilar white powder on other inſects of this genus, but uſually upon the trunk only. The remarks of Roeſel were neceſſarily very limited, two ſpecies of the Fulgorae only being then known. We poſſeſs twelve diſtinct ſpecies, and have made diſſections and obſervations on ſeveral others; from all which we are inclined to imagine, that the white powder has a phoſphoric appearance in the living inſect, and increaſes the light, when the end of the trunk is illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated.</p>
                     <p>One of the Fulgorae of conſiderable magnitude, from the interior of India, enabled us to make many obſervations, The trunk is of the ſame form as that of the <hi>Fulgora Candelaria.</hi> The colour is a dark but beautiful purple: the apex ſcarlet, of a perfectly pellucid appearance, and ſtill retains a reddiſh glare. The ſpots of while, ſprinkled on the purple colour of the trunk, exhibit alſo a ſlight appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of phoſphoric matter. On the trunk of the Fulgora Candelaria theſe white ſpots are very conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous.</p>
                     <p>Though the generic name Fulgora ſeems to imply ſome effulgent property in the inſects that compoſe the genus, it is uncertain whether all poſſeſs that property. They are indeed furniſhed with a trunk, but it is ſmaller in proportion, in ſeveral ſpecies, than in F. Lanternaria, Candelaria, Flammea, Phoſpho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea,
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:50"/>and ſome others. It has not been determined whether any of the European Fulgorae ſhine in the night time. The genus is very limited, including the diſcoveries of modern naturaliſts. Fabricius de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes only twenty-five ſpecies; of theſe, ſeven are European, and eighteen extra-European. Two ſpecies are found in England.</p>
                     <p>Chryſanthemum Indicum.—Indian Chryſanthemum.</p>
                     <p>This is a very lately introduced ſpecies in England. It is mentioned by Sir G. Staunton among the plants collected in the provinces of <hi>Shan-tung</hi> and <hi>Kiang-nan.</hi> Thunberg deſcribes it as a native of Japan in the <hi>Flora Japonica.</hi> A variety of it is figured in the <hi>Hortus Malabaricus;</hi> and in the <hi>Herbarium Amboinenſe</hi> is another. We obſerve a great diſſimilarity between the figures of this plant in different works. That figured in the <hi>Herb. Amb.</hi> has very ſmall flowers, ſcarcely broader than our large daiſy<note n="q" place="bottom">Chryſanthemum Leucanthemum.</note>: the leaves in cluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſome very large, and others ſmall. In the <hi>Hort. Malab.</hi> the flowers are twice the ſize of the former, and the leaves are placed much aſunder. The flowers of our ſpecimen are conſiderably larger than either of theſe; yet not of the magnitude repreſented in the plate of Mr. Curtiss Botanical Magazine.</p>
                     <p>This Chryſanthemum is not peculiar to China, though it has been long cultivated in that country. It grows ſpontaneouſly in ſome parts of Japan; and from the name it bears in the Arabic, Perſic, and other languages, is probably known in moſt parts of Aſia.</p>

                     <p>Though the obſervations that Sir G. Staunton has made on the natural production of China, in his late publication, were neceſſarily very general, the ſcience of inſects appears to have engaged his particular attention; and on that account we muſt lament, that untoward events, precluded him from obſerving more minutely, the peculiarities of ſome kinds, and the economical purpoſes of others.</p>
                     <p>In the general hiſtories of unknown countries, (and we can ſcarcely conſider China in any other view) the entomologiſt muſf expect to find his favourite ſcience neglected, or treated in a manner more likely to excite curioſity than reward enquiry. The work of this learned writer is an exception to our remark; though a few inaccuracies occur in it. We peruſe the following account of an unknown ſpecies of Cicada with particular regret, becauſe, it withholds information intereſting to the naturaliſt, and, from its air of novelty, is likely to promote an erroneous opinion concerning that ſingular tribe of inſects.</p>
                     <p>"The low and ſometimes marſhy country, through which the river<note n="a" place="bottom">Pei-ho.</note> paſſes, is favourable to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of inſects; and many of them were troubleſome, ſome principally by their ſting; and others by their conſtant ſtunning noiſe. The muſic emitted by <hi>a ſpecies of Cicada</hi> was not of the vocal kind; but produced by the motion of two flaps or lamellae which cover the abdomen or belly of the inſect. It is the ſignal of invitation from the male of <hi>that ſpecies</hi> to allure the female, which latter is quite unprovided with theſe organs of courtſhip<note n="b" place="bottom">Chap. 3. Vol. II. octavo.</note>."</p>
                     <p>Again, when deſeribing a town higher up the river, that author ſays, "The ſhops of Hai-tien, in addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to neceſſaries, abounded in toys and trifles, calculated to amuſe the rich and idle of both ſexes, even to cages containing inſects, ſuch as the <hi>noiſy Cicada,</hi> and a large ſpecies of the Gryllus<note n="c" place="bottom">Chap. 4. Vol. II.</note>."</p>
                     <p>The reader may imagine from the firſt account, that the muſic of every other ſpecies of Cicada is of the vocal kind, or that it is peculiar to this Chineſe inſect to be furniſhed with lamellae that cauſe a ſound. The latter account confirms ſuch conjecture, by alluding in a ſpecific manner to the <hi>noiſy Cicada,</hi> as to an inſect deſcribed in a former part of the work. We muſt remark, that not only the males of the ſpecies mentioned by that author, are furniſhed with thoſe lamellae, but the whole of that ſection of the Linnaean Cicadae which Fabricius has called Tettiogonia<note n="d" place="bottom">This includes all the larger ſpecies of Linnaean Cicadae, ſuch as <hi>C.

The males of the ſpecies included in the other ſections of that genus are certainly furniſhed with them alſo; though ſome of them are too minute to be obſerved without a glaſs. Theſe lamellae vary in ſize in different ſpecies; but the accounts we have of them from travellers in foreign countries, and naturaliſts both ancient and modern, prove they all emit a certain ſound to allure the female. As we are unable to aſcertain the Chineſe ſpecies Sir George mentions, neither figure or deſcription accompanying his account of it, we muſt therefore, ſpeak generally of the whole genus, and then confine our remarks to thoſe ſpecies we are acquainted with from China. Among theſe are C. <hi>ſpendidula, ſanguinea,</hi> and <hi>atrata.</hi> The latter, we believe, is the largeſt ſpecies of the Chineſe Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadae known in Europe.</p>
                     <p>Some ſpecies of this tribe were known to the ancients. With them it was the emblem of happineſs and eternal youth<note n="e" place="bottom">Probably becauſe it was ſuppoſed to live only a ſhort time. The renewal of youth is illuſtrated by the ſtory of the Tithonus transformed by Aurora into a Cicada.</note>; and if we examine the legends of pagan mythology, we find they were deemed a race of creatures beloved by gods<note n="f" place="bottom">

On la tire en raclant les branches dans la ſaiſon de l'Automne; on la fait fondre ſur le feu, et l'ayant paſſée, on la verſe dans l'eau froide ougrave; elle ſe fige, et ſe forme en pains. Quand on l'a rompuë, on voit dans les morceaux briſez, des veines comme dans la pierre blanche ou congélation nommée Pe che cao; elle est polie et brilliante: on la mêle avec de l'huile, et on en fait des chandelles. Elle eſt beaucoup ſuperiéure à celles que font les Abeilles.</p>

Il s'en trouve dans les Provinces de <hi>Se tchuen,</hi> de <hi>Hou quang,</hi> de <hi>Yunnan,</hi> de <hi>Fo kien,</hi> de <hi>Tche kiang,</hi> de <hi>Kiang nan,</hi> et genéralement dans tous les quartiers du Sud-Eſt.

                                          <p>L'arbre qui porte cette cire, a les branches, et les feüilles ſemblables à celles du <hi>Tong çin.</hi> Il conſerve ſa verdure durant toutes les ſaiſons : Il pouſſe des fleurs-blanches en bouquets durant la cinquiéme Lune; il porte des fruits en bayes, gros comme le fruit du <hi>Kin</hi> rampant.</p>
                                          <p>Quand ils ne ſont pas mûrs, ils ſont de couleur verte; et ils deviennent noirâtres, lorſqu'ils mûriſſent, au lieu que le fruit de <hi>Tong çin</hi> eſt rouge. Les inſectes que s'y attachent ſont fort petits. Quand le ſoleil parcourt les quinze derniers dégrez des Gemeaux, ils ſe répandent en grimpant ſur les branches de l'arbre; ils en tirent le ſue, et jettent par la bouche une certaine bave, qui s'attachant aux branches encore tendres, ſe changent en une graiſe blanche, laquelle ſe durcit, et prend la forme de cire. On diroit que c'eſt de la gelée blanche que le froid a durcie.</p>
                                          <p>Quand le ſoleil parcourt les quinze premiers dégrez du Signe de la Vierge, on fait la récolte de la Cire, en l'enlevant de deſſus les branches.

Ils ſont attachez anx branches de l'arbre en forme de grapes, et à les voir, on diroit que l'arbre eſt chargé de fruits.

                        <hi>&amp; l'arbre qui porte le ſuif.</hi> His relations are, perhaps, too prolix, but they are evidently the reſult of attentive obſervation, and ſerve to illuſtrate the Natural Hiſtory, and economical purpoſes, of the ſubjects we are noticing: they are briefly theſe. The white wax of China is called <hi>Tchang pe la;</hi> it is not the ſame as the white wax of bees, but is the produce of a ſort of inſect that feeds on a tree called <hi>Tong tçin:</hi> theſe inſects form a kind of white greaſe which attaches to the branches of the tree, hardens, and becomes wax. It is ſcraped from the branches of the trees in autumn, melted on the fire, ſtrained; then poured into cold water, where it coagulates and forms itſelf into cakes. This wax is very white and gloſſy; it is mixed with oil and made into candles, and is much ſuperior to the wax of bees for that purpoſe.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:0808300200:61"/>
                        <hi>Chi tchin,</hi> a Chineſe writer, ſays, it was not till the dynaſty of <hi>Yuen</hi> that the wax made by theſe inſects began to be known; the cuſtom then became very general to employ it both in medicine and making candles. Its medicinal virtues are highly extolled by the Chineſe phyſicians, and particularly by <hi>Tchi hen.</hi> It is ſaid to be a drug abſolutely neceſſary to ſurgeons, that it makes the fleſh cloſe, ſtops bleeding, appeaſes pain, unites the nerves, rejoints the bones, and taken in pills, kills the worms that occaſion conſumptions. It is found in moſt of the ſouth-eaſt provinces of China; but the beſt is brought from <hi>Sc tchuen</hi> and <hi>Yunnan,</hi> and from the territories of <hi>Hen tcheou,</hi> and <hi>Yung tcheou.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Theſe inſects are white when young, and it is then they make their wax. When old, they are of a blackiſh cheſnut colour, and form little pelotons on the branches of trees. Theſe pelotons, at firſt, are about the ſize of a grain of millet; towards the beginning of the ſpring they increaſe in bulk and ſpread; they are attached to the branches like grapes, and at firſt ſight, the trees that bear them, appear loaded with fruit. About the beginning of May, they gather them, and having enveloped them in the leaves of <hi>Yo</hi> (a ſpecies of broad-leaved graſs), they are ſuſpended to the trees. At the end of June, and in July, the pelotons open, and the inſects come forth, crawl about the leaves, and form their wax.</p>
                     <p>Sir G. Staunton, in his learned work, has alſo deſcribed the Wax inſect; he found it at Turon Bay, in Cochin China, and has cauſed it to be repreſented in a vignette plate, with the following deſcription. "Among other objects of natural curioſity, accident led to the obſervation of ſome ſwarms of uncommon
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:62"/>inſects buſily employed upon ſmall branches of a ſhrub, then neither in fruit or flower, but in its general habit bearing ſomewhat the appearance of a privet. Theſe inſects, each not much exceeding the ſize of the domeſtic fly, were of a curious ſtructure, having pectinated appendages riſing in a curve, bending to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the head, not unlike the form of the tail feathers of the common fowl, but in the oppoſite direction. Every part of the inſect was, in colour, of a perfect white, or at leaſt completely covered with a white powder. The particular ſtem frequented by thoſe inſects, was entirely whitened by a ſubſtance or powder of that colour, ſtrewed upon it by them. The ſubſtance or powder was ſuppoſed to form the white wax of the Eaſt. This ſubſtance is aſſerted, on the ſpot, to have the property, by a particular manipulation, of giving in certain proportions, with vegetable oil, ſuch ſolidity to the compoſition as to render the whole equally capable of being moulded into candles. The fact is aſcertained, indeed, in ſome degree, by the ſimple experiment of diſſolving one part of this wax in three parts of olive oil made hot. The whole, when cold, will coagulate into a maſs, approaching to the firmneſs of bees wax."</p>
                     <p>From the accurate deſcription and figures of the latter author, it is evident, the creature that produces the white wax of China, is an imperfect inſect, or, technically ſpeaking, the pupa of an inſect, which, in its mature ſtate, is furniſhed with wings. This is clearly the fact, for the rudiments of wings are viſible in the figures alluded to<note n="g" place="bottom">This may account for a paſſage in <hi>Gordon</hi>'s deſcription of China, where he ſays, "In the plains" of Houquang "are vaſt numbers of little <hi>worms</hi> that produce wax, in the ſame manner as bees do honey," if we underſtand by <hi>worms,</hi> inſects not arrived at maturity; for the larva of Bombyx Mori, is alſo termed a ſilk worm, though it belongs to the moth tribe when perfect.</note>. The metamorphoſe of inſects are ſo various, and their appearance ſo changed in paſſing from one ſtate to another, that the identity of any ſpecies in the larva or pupa can only be proved by actual obſervation; neither do the larva or pupa poſſeſs thoſe characteriſtic differences by which naturaliſts determine one ſpecies from another; and this conſideration deters us from deciding on the preciſe ſpecies, to which the pupa before us ſhould be referred.</p>
                     <p>STOHL, a Dutch author, has been more fortunate; he has aſcertained this identical creature to be the pupa of Cicada Limbata, and in his work on <hi>Cimices</hi> and <hi>Cicades,</hi> gives a figure of it under the title of <hi>De Waldraagſter</hi> (Nymphe) or <hi>La Cigale Porte Laine,</hi> fig. 144, together with the winged inſect at fig. 145; and it is on this authority Cicada Limbata is introduced in the annexed plate.</p>
                     <p>We are ſtrongly inclined to credit the accuracy of Stohl in this inſtance; there is much ſimilarity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the pupa and the cicada, and ſome ſtriking characteriſtics are common to both. They agree in the ſtructure of the antennae, and proboſcis, or ſucking trunk; the abdomen of the winged inſect is alſo loaded with a fine white powder, and is furniſhed at the extremity with a tuft of down and hairs, ſimilar to that ſo eminently conſpicuous in the pupa ſtate. We have, however, obſerved the white powder, and tuft on the abdomen of Cicada lanata, and have reaſon to imagine it alſo forms a white wax, ſimilar to that of the preſent ſpecies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:0808300200:63"/>The Cicada limbata is of a light green colour, with a red margin; that which Stohl has figured is of a pale brown, with a black margin. Theſe are the <hi>ſpecies</hi> and <hi>variety</hi> Fabricius deſcribes, for the ſpecimens he refers to, in the collection of Sir Joſeph Banks, agree preciſely with our inſects. Fabricius notes the <hi>habitat</hi> Africa. Stohl received the green ſpecimen from the Iſland of Ceylon; the pale ſort from Africa. The larva we have repreſented is from China; and the Cicada was brought from the Eaſt Indies, by the late Mr. Ellis.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Croton Sebiferum—Poplar-leaved Croton, or Tallow-tree.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Tallow-tree is not the natural food of the Wax inſect, but as they mutually illuſtrate the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, they are repreſented in the ſame plate; and it is further preſumed, that a ſhort account of this uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful plant, will be deemed a proper ſequel to the hiſtory of the inſect.</p>
                     <p>Du Halde, when deſcribing the Tallow-tree, ſays, "Il eſt de la hauteur d'une grande cerifier. Le fruit eſt renfermée dans un écorce qu'on appelle <hi>Yen Kiou,</hi> et qui s'ouvre par le milieu quand il eſt mûr, comme celle de la châtaigne. Il conſiſte en des grains blancs de la groſſeur d'un noiſette, dont la chair a les qualitez du ſuif; auſſi en fait-on des chandelles, après l'avoir fait fondre, en y mêlant ſouvent un pen d'huile ordinaire, et trempant les chandelles dans la cire qui vient fur l'arbre dont je vais parler: il s'en forme autour du ſuif une eſpéce de croûte qui l'empêche de couler<note n="h" place="bottom">"It is of the height of a large cherry-tree; the fruit is incloſed in a ſhell, called <hi>Yen Kiou,</hi> which, when ripe, opens in the middle like the cheſnut. The fruit conſiſts of white kernels of the ſize of a ſmall, or hazel nut, whoſe ſubſtance has all the qualities of tallow; ſo that they make candles of it, after having melted and mixed it with a ſmall portion of common oil, and then dipping the candles into the wax before mentioned, it forms a kind of cruſt round the tallow that prevents its run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or waſting.</note>. Page 18. Vol. I.</p>
                     <p>Sir G. Staunton ſpeaks nearly to the ſame effect: "From the fruit of the <hi>Croton ſebiferum,</hi> of Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus, the Chineſe obtain a kind of vegetable fat, with which they make a great proportion of their candles. This fruit, in its external appearance, bears ſome reſemblance to the berries of the ivy. As ſoon as it is ripe, the capſule opens and divides into two, or, more frequently, three diviſions, and falling off, diſcovers as many kernels, each attached by a ſeparate foot-ſtalk, and covered with a fleſhy ſubſtance of a ſnowy whiteneſs, contraſting beautifully with the leaves of the tree, which, at this ſeaſon, are of a tint between a purple and a ſcarlet. The fat, or fleſhy ſubſtance, is ſeparated from the kernels by cruſhing and boiling them in water. The candles made of this fat are firmer than thoſe of tallow, as well as free
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:64"/>from all offenſive odour. They are not, however, equal to thoſe of wax or ſpermaceti." This author further adds, "The wax for candles, is generally the produce of inſects, feeding chiefly on the privet, as is mentioned in the chapter of Cochin China. It is naturally white, and ſo pure as to produce no ſmoke; but is collected in ſuch ſmall quantities, as to be ſcarce and dear. Cheap candles are alſo made of tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, and even of greaſe of too little conſiſtence to be uſed, without the contrivance of being coated with the firmer ſubſtance of the tallow-tree or of wax." <hi>Vide Chapter on Sou-choo foo.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The tallow-tree is now cultivated in the Weſt Indies, where it thrives well, and produces fruit, and by proper attention may hereafter become uſeful.</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:0808300200:65"/>In the infant ſtate of muſic, men, ſeem to have preferred the natural ſounds of ſome animals, to thoſe of their uncouth inſtruments. We cannot otherwiſe account for the extravagant praiſe, beſtowed on the noiſe of this little creature. It is true, authors agree that the ſounds of ſome kinds are exceeding loud and harmonious, and in the early ages of the world theſe might have a powerful influence on the human mind. It is related that the <hi>ancient Locri,</hi> a people of Greece, were ſo charmed with the ſong of the Cicada, that they erected a ſtatue to its honour<note n="i" place="bottom">Some ſay that once a certain player of <hi>Locri,</hi> conteſting in the art of muſic with another, would have loſt the victory, by the breaking of two ſtrings of his inſtrument; but a <hi>Cicada</hi> flew to his aid, and reſting on the broken inſtrument, ſung ſo well, that the Locrian was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared victor. The Locrians erected a ſtatue to the Cicada as a teſtimony of their gratitude. It repreſented the player with the inſect on his inſtrument.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The ancients had attentively obſerved the manners of its life, though they indulged in many poetical fictions concerning it; and particularly, when they affirmed that it ſubſiſted on dew.

Ariſtotle alſo knew the ſexual difference of them; he mentions them as a delicious food: he preferred the males when young, but more ſo the females before ſhe laid her eggs.</note>; though it was reſerved for more accurate naturaliſts to diſcover the complex organs by which it was cauſed and modulated. Aldrovandus, near two centuries ago, deſcribed the lamellae, which he compares to the fruit of ſome herbs, called by modern botaniſts <hi>Thlaſpi</hi>

                           <hi>Scopoli carn.</hi> Yeats deſcribes the Kakkerlak of the American iſlands as a ſpecies of <hi>Blatta,</hi> cock-roaches. Are there not two inſects of that name?—one of them is, we believe, a <hi>Blatta.</hi>
                        </note> in the Indies, perhaps becauſe the ſound emitted by it may be likened to the pronunciation of that word. Mr. Abbot, an accurate obſerver and collector of natural hiſtory in <hi>North America,</hi> has diſcovered four new ſpecies of Cicada, one of them nearly equal in ſize to our Cicada Atrata. This, he ſays, was found in great abundance one ſeaſon, in ſome ſwampy grounds near Suſquehanna river, and was remarkable on account of their loud noiſe, which at a little diſtance reſembled the ringing of <hi>horſe-bells.</hi>

                     <p>Some naturaliſts have ſuppoſed that the ſound of the Cicada, is cauſed by the flapping of the lamellae againſt the abdomen; and others, that it is only a noiſe occaſioned by the ruſtling of the ſegments of the body in the contractile motion of that part.

                     </p>
                     <p>Reaumur and Roeſel have diſſected ſeveral of the Cicadae, and diſcovered that the lamellae cannot have that free motion neceſſary to cauſe ſuch a ſound; but that it is produced by ſome internal organs of the inſect, and only iſſues through the opening, concealed under the lamellae, as through the mouth of a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical inſtrument<note n="x" place="bottom">For the ſatisfaction of the curious reader, we detail the moſt intereſting particulars concerning the organization of theſe parts from <hi>Reaumur's Hiſtoire des Inſectes,</hi> and <hi>Roeſel's Verſchiedene auſlaendiſche ſorten von Cicaden, &amp;c.</hi>
                           <p>The muſic of the Cicada is not cauſed by the motion of the <hi>lamellae,</hi> as ſome have ſuppoſed. Reaumur obſerves, that although the <hi>lamellae</hi> have a kind of moveable hinge, they have alſo a ſtiff and pointed tooth, or ſpine, that prevents them from being liſted far back; and, if ſtrained, are very liable to be broken.</p>
                           <p>From the anatomical deſcription of Roeſel, we find that, within the two hollows that are ſeen when the lamellae are liſted up, two very ſmooth ſkins are viſible; theſe are highly poliſhed, of nearly a ſemicircular ſhape, and reſlect priſmatic colours: there is between thoſe a hard brown projection, or corner which unites with another piece above them in a longitudinal direction, to the under part of the breaſt. This longitudinal piece divides a triangular red ſpace or field into two parts, one on the right ſide, and the other on the left. Above theſe, in a tranſverſe direction, is ſeen two ſmall yellow ſkins; the lamellae in their natural poſition conceal theſe organs becauſe they fold exactly over them.</p>
                           <p>Reaumur, in the exterior appearance of theſe parts, could diſcover nothing that could lead to determine the organs of the ſound; and he was not ſatisfied that the ſlight motion of the lamellae on theſe parts could produce the loud ſinging noiſe of the Cicada. He opened a few cicadae on the back part of the body, ſo that the inner ſtructure of the under ſide was diſplayed, and eſpecially the parts connected to the curious organs he had diſcovered under the lamellae. At laſt he diſcovered two large muſcles, which at their point of union formed a ſpace almoſt ſquare, and were connected with the red triangular fields he had obſerved on the under ſide: as he concluded theſe formed a material part of the organs he wiſhed to diſcover, he examined them attentively, and found that, by moving them backwards and forwards, he could make a cicada ſing that had been dead many months. Although the ſound was not ſtrong, it tended to prove that he had diſcovered the inſtrument that produced it.—In another part he ſays it is evident the ſound is cauſed by the little ſkins connected to the muſcles, becauſe when they were rubbed: with a bit of paper they emitted that kind of ſound.</p>
                           <p>Roeſel has diſcovered two little pieces of horny ſubſtance that arc connected by a ſort of fibre within the ſkins, in the body, and he ſuppoſes when this is in motion, it ſtrikes againſt the before-mentioned thin ſkins, and produces a ſound, by the ſame means as a hollow body, or drum, when ſtruck with a ſtick: and alſo that this noiſe may be varied or modulated by a ſlight motion of the lamellae, but cannot be produced without the aſſiſtance of the internal nerves and muſcles connected with the organs firſt deſcribed.</p>
                           <p>Authors agree that the Cicadae of hot countries emit the loudeſt ſound. It appears from the papers of Mr. Smeethman (who reſided it conſiderable time in Africa) publiſhed by Mr. Drury, that the ſound of ſome kinds peculiar to that part of the world is ſo loud as to be heard at half a mile diſtance; and that the ſinging of one within doors, ſilences a whole company.— The ſame attentive obſerver ſays, the open parts of the country are never without their muſic, ſome ſinging in the evening and others only in the day.</p>
                        </note>.</p>
                     <p>The ſuppoſitions of theſe authors ſeem well founded; we have examined many ſpecies that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them, and find the ſpine before mentioned, ſo placed in many inſects, as to prevent the motion
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:67"/>of the lamellae. We have a ſpecimen from America, which, in addition to the uſual organs of ſound, have two large hollow protuberances or drums; one on each ſide of the abdomen; and muſt, we imagine, produce a louder ſound than any yet diſcovered: a ſpecies very ſimilar to this is alſo brought from New Holland.</p>
                     <p>The proboſcis of thoſe inſects is a hard or horny tube, in which a very acute; ſlender ſucking-pipe is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. The horny tube is not unlike a gimlet in form, and is uſed by thoſe creatures to bore through the bark of trees, to extract the juices, on which it feeds. Linnaeus has named the ſpecies of one diviſion in his Syſtem, <hi>Mannifera,</hi> becauſe they had been obſerved to fly among aſh trees, bore many holes in them, and when the manna had oozed out, return and carry it off.</p>
                     <p>With this proboſcis they bore holes in the ſmall twigs of the extreme branches of trees, and depoſit their eggs in them, ſometimes to the amount of ſix or ſeven hundred. As each cell contains no more than from twelve to twenty eggs, it does great damage to the trees they frequent. Stohl ſays, "the common one<note n="y" place="bottom">Lu Cigale Vicilleuſe. Cicad. Tibicien.</note>, which is ſound at Surinam in the coffee plantations, greatly injures thoſe trees; the females depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their eggs in the young ſhoots, and in holes they bore with their ſheath. They live on the juices of the trees."</p>

                        <pb facs="tcp:0808300200:68"/>M. Merian gives a figure and account of the metamorphoſe of a cicada found in Surinam. She has miſtaken the winged inſect to be only the pupa of the <hi>Fulgora Lanternaria,</hi> which is too abſurd to deſerve contradiction; in other reſpects her account is intereſting, and particularly that part which relates to the pupa ſtate, or chafer, as it is termed. "The pomegranate tree," ſays Merian, "ſo well known in all other countries, grows alſo in the fields of Surinam. On them I have found a ſpecies of chafer, which is naturally very lazy, and conſequently very eaſy to be caught. It carries underneath the head a long trunk, with which it eaſily penetrates the flowers, in order to extract the honey from them. On the 20th of May, when they were laying quite quiet, the ſkin of the back burſt open, and green flies, with tranſparent wings, iſſued from them. Theſe flies are found in abundance in Surinam, and have ſuch a rapid flight, that it took me many hours to catch one."</p>
                     <p>The pupa we received from China with our Cicada atrata, very much reſembles that figured by Merian. It has the long ſucking trunk or proboſcis; but the moſt formidable of its weapons ſeem to be the fore feet, which are thick, ſtrong, and armed with ſpines or teeth; with theſe it may do more injury to the plants, by tearing off the tender ſhoots, than by wounding the trunk to extract the moiſture.</p>
                     <p>We have repreſented the upper and under ſide of a male of this intereſting ſpecies, Cicada atrata, not only to illuſtrate our preceding remarks, but becauſe we believe no figure has been given of it by any author, unleſs <hi>De Zwarte Chineeſche cicade</hi>

                     <p>The general appearance of both ſexes of Cicada atrata is very ſimilar, except that the female is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a ſheath, and the male with lamellae. The ſheath of the female is partly concealed within a valve at the extremity of the abdomen, and is only protruded when the creature lays her eggs. In the figure of the under ſurface of a male inſect, exhibited in the annexed plate, the lamellae are diſtinguiſhed by two ſtars: the ſingle ſtar denotes the ſituation of the ſpine, mentioned by Roeſel and Reaumur.</p>

                     <p>The tree which produces the uſeful drug <hi>camphor</hi> is very abundant in Japan and China. Sir G. Staunton ſays it is the only ſpecies of the laurel genus growing in China, where it is a large and valuable timber, and is never cut up for the ſake of the drug; but that ſubſtance is obtained by decocting the ſmall branches, twigs, and leaves, and ſubliming the camphor in luted earthen veſſels. A purer ſort is brought from the iſland of Borneo and Japan, which is ſuppoſed to be a natural exudation from the tree when the bark is wounded. Sir G. Staunton ſays the Camphor-tree is felled in thoſe countries for the ſole purpoſe of finding the drug in ſubſtance among the ſplinters.</p>

                     <p>M. Merian has given a plate and deſcription of this ſpecies in her work on the Inſects of Surinaim.

The pupat<note n="t" place="bottom">Theſe are <hi>ſemi-completa:</hi> unlike the pupa of the Lepidoptera, &amp;c. theſe ſcarcely diſſer in appearance or manners of life from the complete inſect, but have only the rudiments of the wings.</note> is repreſented on the back of a large frog in the water, and is deſigned to pourtray the manner in which it faſtens on thoſe creatures, holds them between its ſtrong curved fore feet<note n="u" place="bottom">If theſe correſpond with the antennae of other inſects, the Nepa has only ſour feet.</note>, and extracts the juices of their bodies, through its ſingularly conſtructed beak. M. Merian ſays the winged inſect came out of one of theſe creatures on the twelfth of May 1701.</p>
                     <p>Every writer on this inſect ſince M.

                     <p>Inſects in general diſcover an extraordinary degree of care, and ingenuity, in depoſiting their eggs in the moſt ſecure ſituations, or places where the infant brood, when hatched, may be provided with proper ſuſtenance. Thoſe of the aquatic kind uſually lay them in receſſes in the mud or ſand, or under looſe ſtones that lie at the bottom of the water: others, with as much care, and more ingenuity, hollow out the interior ſubſtance of the large ſtalks of water plants, and depoſit their eggs in them; or, riſing out of the water, lay them in the extreme branches of thoſe plants, to ſecure them from other aquatic depredators. The Nepa ruſtica diſplays even more ſagacity, or attachment for its eggs, than thoſe creatures; for it never leaves them. Till they are hatched, it bears them on its back, in a cluſter of an oval ſhape; theſe eggs are of an oblong form, and are faſtened by the narroweſt end to a thin film, or plate of cement, that cauſes them to adhere to the poliſhed ſurface of the wing caſes; when theſe eggs, about an hundred in number, are hatched, it caſts off the exuviae of the cluſter, and differs no longer in general appearance from the male of the ſame ſpecies.</p>

                     <p>The ſimile propoſed by Linnaeus for the arrangement of Butterflies, is gleaned from ancient and fabulous hiſtory. The ſpecies are divided into ſections of Trojan and Greek princes, heroes, deities, nymphs, and plebeians: this allegorical ſyſtem, which is well conducted, ſeems liable to leſs objection, than the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters aſſigned to each ſection: for many ſpecies placed among the Equites, and a more conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber with the Plebeii, are inconſiſtent with the eſſential criterion Linnaeus has given. This arrangement has undergone ſome material alterations in the <hi>Entomologia Syſtematica</hi> of Fabricius; alterations, perhaps juſtified, by the comprehenſive view, its author has taken of this pleaſing branch of Entomology. The Equites, with many additions, and a few exceptions, are the ſame as thoſe in the two Linnaean ſections: Papilio Priamus, is however, removed from the head of the <hi>Equites Trojani,</hi> and the precedence given to Papilio Paris.</p>
                     <p>Papilio Paris is an inſect of conſiderable beauty. The general colour on the upper ſurface obſcure brown, nearly approaching black, but finely contraſted with brilliant green atoms, that are profuſely ſprinkled over it. The poſterior wings are adorned with a large blue ſpot, which derives additional luſtre from the duſky colour ſurrounding it. Another ſpecies, very ſimilar to Papilio Paris, but without this ſpot, is alſo found in China. It is the ſuppoſed female of our ſpecies. Fabricius names it Bianor, after <hi>Cramer, pl.</hi> 103. <hi>fig.</hi> 6.</p>

                     <p>The ſingular delicacy and beauty of this Papilio is not the only claim it has to the particular attention of Entomologiſts: it is clearly an undeſcribed ſpecies; and perhaps the only ſpecimen of it yet brought to Europe, is that from which our figure is copied. It was taken near Pekin, by a gentleman in the ſuite of Earl Macartney, in the late embaſſy to China; and is at this time in the poſſeſſion of Mr. Francillon of London, who has kindly permitted us to make drawings and deſcriptions of this, and every other inſect in his magnificent collection that could enhance the value of this publication.</p>
                     <p>Papilio Telamon bears a diſtant reſemblance to P. Proteſilaus, but a much ſtronger to P. Ajax: pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing then the metaphorical method of arranging the butterflies in the Linnaean manner, we have given it the name of the father of Ajax, who was one of the diſtinguiſhed Grecian Princes at the ſiege of Troy.</p>

                  <div type="description">
                     <p>Moſt naturaliſts are undetermined whether Papilio Menelaus and the ſuppoſed variety, Papilio Rhetenor, ſhould not be conſidered diſtinct ſpecies. The colour of the upper ſide is nearly the ſame in both inſects; but the under ſides are very different. The Linnaean deſcription of the male, P. Menelaus, agrees with Papilio Rhetenor, and probably he conſidered them the two ſexes of one inſect. Fabricius would certainly have made a new ſpecies of it, if he had not been of the ſame opinion. We have both inſects before us, and ſhould moſt aſſuredly make a new ſpecies of P. Rhetenor, as Cramer and Sulzer have done, if the authority of the laſt work of Fabricius were not oppoſed to us.</p>
                     <p>Papilio Menelaus is a native of South America. Sulzer's ſpecimen of Papilio Rhetenor came from China. Foreign Entomologiſts, for this and other reaſons, have conſidered them diſtinct ſpecies. The curious in inſects, ſays Cramer, call this butterfly <hi>Le Satiré bleu oblong,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from P. Menclaus, or <hi>Le Satiné bleu vulgaire.</hi>—Cramer has alſo given a third and much ſmaller kind of theſe blue butterflies, <hi>Pap. Adonis,</hi> which Fabricius alſo conſiders a variety of Menclaus.</p>
                     <p>Whatever effect the artiſt can produce by a combination of the moſt brilliant colours employed in painting, he muſt ſhrink from compariſon of it with this ſplendid creature. It is impoſſible to find in any part of the animal creation colours more beautiful or changeable. Pale blue is the principal colour, but new tints meet the eye in every direction, varying from a ſilvery green to the deepeſt purple; and the whole ſurface glittering with the reſplendence of highly poliſhed metal.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>Sir G. Staunton ſays the bohea tea is ſupplied in China from the province of Fochen: the green tea from Kiang-nan. The leaves of theſe teas vary in ſome degree in form according to the age of the plant; thoſe of the bohea are the broadeſt; Thea ſtricta has much longer leaves, they are lanceolated, and more deeply ſerrated than thoſe of the bohea. Many authors have conſidered them varieties of the ſame ſpecies. —Flowers in England in Auguſt and September.</p>

                     <p>The number of Chineſe ſpecies of this genus, already deſcribed, is very limited: our preſent inſect is the largeſt of them; but, as this is inferior in ſize to ſeveral kinds found in Europe, we conceive there muſt remain many larger ſpecies of the genus unknown to collectors of foreign inſects, and yet very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in China. In the latter part of Sir G. Staunton's work, that author mentions the larva of a <hi>Sphinx Moth</hi> which furniſh an article for the table of the Chineſe. We regret that the indefinite expreſſion can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not not aſſiſt us to determine the ſpecies, and ſcarcely the genus, of the inſect alluded to<note n="e" place="bottom">European naturaliſts are entirely ignorant of the Chineſe inſects in the ſtate of larva and pupa, if we except a ſew ſpecies of the Cimices, Cicada, and ſome altogether unintereſting inſects, that have been accidentally brought among others from that country. Hence it muſt remain undetermined whether they correſpond in form with thoſe of other parts of the world. It is, however, highly probable, from their great affinity to thoſe, in the perfect ſtate, that in the ſtate of larva they may alſo agree. The extenſive collection of the larva of ſphinges made by Mr. Abbot in North America affords no ſingularly conſtructed animal diſtinct from thoſe ſound in Europe; they vary indeed in their colours, but preſerve uniformly the characters found on the ſame genus in other countries. We noticed among the drawings of the late Mr. Bradſhaw the figure of a Chineſe ſphinx, apparently <hi>S. Hylas,</hi> together with a larva ſimilar to that of the Sphinx Stellatarum: it was green, and, like all the known larva of the genus, (except the <hi>Adſcitae</hi> diviſion) was perfectly free from hairs: it was alſo furniſhed with a horn at the poſterior part of the body.</note>.</p>
                     <p>The ſpecimen figured in the annexed plate, is in the collection of Mr. Francillon, who received it from China.

                     <p>It is altogether perplexing, and myſterious to us, that Fabricius, throughout all his works, and even in his laſt enlarged and corrected ſyſtematic arrangement, has given a Papilio Thallo in the <hi>Heliconii</hi> diviſion of that genus, when it is clear no ſuch Papilio has exiſtence. Linnaeus has, undoubtedly, ſo named an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſect figured in a plate of Edwards's birds, tab. 226, with a reference to that work; yet it is certain the inſect there figured is not a butterfly, but a lepidopterous Inſect, to which antennae of dubious ſtructure have been added, to perfect its appearance<note n="f" place="bottom">Coincident obſervations on perfect ſpecimens of ſeveral inſects, nearly allied to this ſpecies, tend to convince us, that the artiſt had only a mutilated ſpecimen to copy from. Indeed, though the antennae in his figure are terminated in a kind of capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulum, like that of the butterflies, the filaments are ſomewhat jagged, as if intended to appear ſlightly pectinated. Cramer notices the very cloſe affinity between his inſect, <hi>P. Tiberina,</hi> and that in Edwards's work; which, he obſerves, differs neither in form nor colour, but only in having clubbed antennae: thoſe parts of his inſect being pectinated or feathered.—"Mr. Edwards a repréſenté un Papillon, qui ne differe de celui-ci, ni pour la coleur, ni pour la deſſein, mais qui a des antennes à boutons. Celui que nous donnons ici eſt gravé d'apres une Phalêne qui a des antennes plumacées," &amp;c. <hi>Cram.</hi> C. D. Pl. 32.
<p>Edwards calls this inſect the little black and white Butcher fly, becauſe it is figured on a plate with the black and white Butcher bird.</p>
                        </note>. No later author has figured the ſame ſpecies; and ſpecimens of it being extremely ſcarce, it is probable Fabricius has been unable to detect the error. In admitting this, however, we muſt neceſſarily notice the ſynonyms of <hi>Sphinx pectinicornis,</hi> where he alſo quotes the ſame figure in the works of Edwards. Thus we find, throughout all the editions of the Fabrician Syſtem, a <hi>Papilio Thallo</hi> and <hi>Sphinx pectinicornis</hi> formed of the ſolitary figure of one inſect. Cramer has finally increaſed the ambiguity of its genera, by making an inſect of cloſe affinity, perhaps the ſame ſpecies, a Phalaena. <hi>Vide P. Tiberina.</hi>

In removing our inſect to the ſphinx genus, we have retained the ſpecific name <hi>Thallo,</hi> as more likely to denote the ſpecies than any newly adopted name. The inſect figured by Cramer does not preciſely agree with Edwards's figure. In the firſt, the diſk of the poſterior wings are yellowiſh, with a deep border of black: in the other, the yellow occupies only a ſpace near the baſe, and forms a ſemi-lunar mark near the anterior margin of thoſe wings. We ſuſpect, with Cramer, that they are but the two ſexes of one ſpecies. Cramer ſays both his ſpecimens came from China, from whence our inſects were alſo received.</p>

                     <p>The Phalaenae are a tribe of inſects remarkable for the neatneſs and ſimplicity of their colours. Their elegancies conſiſt in the infinite variety, and delicacy of intermingled tints: the contraſt of ſpots, ſpeck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and lineations, which conſtitute the minutiae of inſect beauty. Some ſpecies are to be excepted in this remark; the larger kinds are often gaudy, and the ſmalleſt exhibit a diſplay of the richeſt colours, fancifully diſpoſed, and moſt elegantly diverſified.</p>
                     <p>The European ſpecies are numerous, and pretty well aſcertained: thoſe of remote countries remain in great obſcurity. The ſpecies inhabiting China are almoſt unknown<note n="o" place="bottom">
                           <hi>Fab. Ent. Syſt.</hi> Theſe are chiefly deſcribed from inſects in the collection of <hi>Monſon Londini,</hi> of which no figures are extant, and the collection unknown.</note>; for the lateſt ſyſtematic writer deſcribes not more than twenty ſpecies in all the cabinets in Europe. From this ſcanty number a few are ſelected to illuſtrate the genus, and if theſe appear deficient in point of intereſt or variety, it may ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late others to collect new ſpecies, whenever an opportunity occurs. The Phalaena tribe, not only of China, but every country, except of Europe, are a <hi>deſideratum</hi> of entomology. In Europe the number of this tribe exceeds that of any other: on the contrary, the extra European ſpecies are comparatively the moſt inconſiderable of our acquiſitions. The Papiliones, or Butterflies, are a ſhowy and lively race: they ſport in the open fields in day, and attract the traveller's curioſity; hence our cabinets abound with them. But the moth, infinitely more numerous, and not leſs pleaſing, is ſeldom ſeen; in the gloomineſs of its diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:125"/>it ſeeks the obſcurity of the foreſt in the day, and only ventures on the wing when the ſun is down. In Europe we viſit its nocturnal haunts without difficulty or dread; but in hotter climates theſe are often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times impenetrable, or the lurking places of ferocious animals; and few will expoſe themſelves to their attacks, to increaſe the catalogue of exotic Phalaenae<note n="p" place="bottom">The far greater number of Phalaenae can only be taken in the woods at night. This is termed <hi>mothing</hi> by collectors. The moths begin to ſtir about twilight, and when almoſt dark, commence their flight. The collector is furniſhed with a large gauze folding-net, in which the inſects are caught indiſcriminately, for it is impoſſible to diſtinguiſh one ſpecies from another, and often is ſo dark, that the object itſelf can barely be diſcerned. Different ſpecies have their favourite haunts, ſome the lanes, and ſkirts of woods, but many of them prefer the open breaks in the moſt retired places. As it would be unſafe, or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, to penetrate the woods in many countries, it it better to collect the larva, or caterpillar, for theſe may be found on the trees in day-time, and if kept in little gauze cages, and carefully fed, will change into chryſalis, and produce the fly. This is certainly tedious, and few travellers will divert their attention from more important obſervations; but were they to appropriate their leiſure to this branch of ſcience, they would materially improve entomology. Mr. Abbot has inveſtigated a ſmall diſtrict of Georgia, in North America, in this manner, and our cabinet is indebted to his labours for ſeveral hundred ſpecies, altogether new in Europe. The reader may eſtimate the importance of theſe diſcoveries, by referring to the two expenſive volumes of North American Inſects, lately publiſhed; and reflecting, that the originals of all the ſpecies included in that work, are but a ſmall ſelection from thoſe he has furniſhed us with. Viewing theſe as the reſult of one man's reſearch, in an inconſiderable portion of North America, what a variety of new and ſplendid kinds would be the reward of thoſe, who ſhould explore the more genial regions of Aſia, Africa, and South America, with equal diligence and information!
<p>We have hazarded an aſſertion which may ſeem inadmiſſible, that the Phalaenae are infinitely more numerous than the Papiliones, or any other tribe of inſects. Not that we poſſeſs more; but becauſe, in every country that has been inveſtigated, experience juſtifies ſuch opinion. For inſtance, in Great Britain, we have only ſixty Papiliones, and by mere accident two or three local ſpecies have lately been added; of the Phalaenae we have more than 900. The ſame comparative proportion is obſerved throughout the countries of the European continent; and it is ſingularly analogous, that our opinion is confirmed, by the recent diſcoveries of Mr. Abbot in America alſo.</p>

                     <p>Phalaena Atlas is the firſt ſpecies we have to notice. It is the largeſt of the moth tribe<note n="q" place="bottom">When Linnaeus deſcribed it, few of the very large ſpecies of Phalaena were known. We have two ſpecies from the interior of Africa, that are larger than the Chineſe <hi>var.</hi> of Atlas, and ſeveral others ſcarcely inferior in magnitude.</note>, and is, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, gigantic creature. The ſpecies is common, but not peculiar to China, being found in other parts of Aſia, and in America. The influence of climate is eaſily traced in the <hi>varicties</hi> from different countries; that from Surinam is the largeſt, and of the deepeſt colours. The Chineſe kind is the next in ſize; the colours incline to orange, and the anterior wings are more falcated or hooked at the ends. We have two other Aſiatic <hi>varieties</hi> ſtill ſmaller, with the wings extremely falcated.</p>
                     <p>The larva of Phalaena Atlas is figured by <hi>M. Merian,</hi> in the <hi>Inſecta Surinamenſia,</hi> plate 52: it is about four inches in length, green, with a yellow ſtripe diſpoſed longitudinally. Upon each ſegment are four diſtinct round tubercles of a coral-like orange colour, which are ſurrounded with very delicate hairs. The pupa is large, and is incloſed in a web of an ochre colour. The ſilk of this web is of a ſtrong texture, and it has been imagined, if woven, would be ſuperior in durability to that of the common ſilk worm. <hi>Seba</hi> has alſo repreſented the larva at fig. 1. plate 57. vol. 4. <hi>Theſaurus Naturae.</hi> It is nearly ſix inches in length, and bulky in proportion; the Phalaena is alſo larger than that figured by Merian, which is a
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:126"/>ſmall ſpecimen of the Surinam kind. According to Merian, there are three broods of this inſect in a year; they are very common, and feed on the orange trees. Linnaeus ſays, they adhere ſo tenaciouſly to the leaves, that they can ſcarcely be taken off<note n="r" place="bottom">Larva verticillata verrucis piloſis nec folliculos grandes, tenaces, vix extricandos. <hi>Linn.

                     <p>The common ſilk worm, or Phalaena Mori, is of this family, and merits obſervation as a native of China. The art of weaving its threads into ſilk is of the earlieſt date. The diſcovery is attributed to the <hi>Seres,</hi> a people of the Eaſt Indies, ſuppoſed the Chineſe<note n="s" place="bottom">Velleraque ut foliis depectant tenuia Seres. <hi>Virg. Georg.</hi> II. 122.</note>. In the days of Solomon, we are told, a woman named Pamphilia, of the Iſland of Co, was ſkilled in the art of making cloth, of the ſilk brought from the country of the Seres. The moſt ancient of the Chineſe writers aſcribe the invention to one of the women of the emperor <hi>Hoang ti,</hi> named <hi>Si ling,</hi> and in honour <hi>Yuen fei</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="bottom">DU HALDE, <hi>Des Soycries.</hi> Les plus anciens écrivans de cet Empire, en attribuent la découverte à une des femmes de l'Empereur <hi>Hoang ti,</hi> nommée <hi>Si ling,</hi> et furnommée par honneur <hi>Yuen fei.</hi>
                        </note>. When Rome degenerated into voluptuouſneſs, Perſia, its dependency, furniſhed this article of luxury; but it is ſuppoſed they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to the Chineſe for it, and being ſupplied only in ſmall quantities, it was conſequently dear. In Rome it was ſo ſcarce, as to be worn only by perſons of the firſt diſtinction.</p>
                     <p>The Chineſe hiſtorians affirm, that the diſcovery was conſidered at firſt of ſuch importance, that all the women in the palace of the emperor were engaged in rearing the inſect, and weaving its ſilk. In after times, the ſilk of China was a principal article of commerce, but latterly its value has been materially leſſened, by the culture and fabrication of ſilk in other countries. As the Chineſe know little of the uſe of linen, the ſilk is a ſtaple article of their own conſumption. The jeſuit miſſionaries mention ſeveral ſorts of it, in uſe among the Chineſe; ſome admired for beauty, and others for durability. It is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuppoſed theſe are not merely the effect of different manufacture, but are the produce of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct inſects<note n="u" place="bottom">M. Merian ſays, in the deſcription of the Surinam variety of Phalaena Atlas: "Telam ducunt fortem, quare bonum fore ſericum rata, iſtius aliquam collegi copiam &amp; in Belgium tranſmiſi, ubi eadem optima judicata eſt: ut itaque, ſi quis Erucas iſtas congregandi laborem non detrectaverit, et bonae notae bombycem, et maximum hinc lucrum ſibi comparare poſſet." The thread of which this coccon's web is compoſed, is ſo ſtrong, that it has been imagined it would make good ſilk. I have brought ſome of it into Holland, which has been eſteemed ſuch. So that if any one would take the trouble to collect a number of theſe caterpillars, they would be found good ſilk worms, and produce great profit. MERIAN.—Abbot informs us, the Moths of the Emperor tribe, in general, are called Silk worms by the people of Georgia, and in the deſcription of Phalaena cecropia, is ſtill more explicit: for he ſays, "the caterpillar ſpins on a twig. The outſide web is coarſe, the inner covered with ſilk, like a ſilk worm's coccon. It is ſaid this ſilk has been carded, ſpun, and made into ſtockings, and that it will waſh like linen." <hi>Abbot's Inſ. by Dr. J. E. Smith.</hi>—Theſe inſects are all of the ſame natural order, P. Cecropia is rather ſmaller, but very ſimilar to P. Atlas, and this information at leaſt corroborates the aſſertion of Merian.
<p>An opinion, that the Chineſe rear ſeveral kinds of inſects for the ſake of their ſilk, has long been prevalent. Dr. Lettſom propoſes a query on this ſubject, "Which ſpecies of moth or butterfly is it, the caterpillar of which, in China, affords that ſtrong grey kind of ſilk, and how is it manufactured or wore? How are theſe ſilk worms or caterpillars preſerved, fed, and managed? The introduction of ſuch a new ſilk into England would be it uſeful acquiſtion, and redeem entomology from the cenſure it is now branded with, of being a mere curioſity, void of any real utility<note n="*" place="bottom">Naturaliſt and Traveller's Companion, 1774.</note>." If <hi>Leſſer</hi> and <hi>Lyonet</hi> are to be relied on, The <hi>Theologie des Inſectes</hi> anſwers this query. "At this day there are to be found in China, in the province of Canton, ſilk worms in a wild ſtate, which, without any care being taken of them, make in the woods a kind of ſilk which the inhabitants afterwards gather from the trees. It is grey, without luſtre, and is uſed to make a very thick and ſtrong cloth, named there Kien Tcheon. It may be waſhed like linen cloth, and does not ſtain." A Gentleman reſident in the Eaſt Indies, ſpeaks of a large Phalaena, producing ſilk in that country. "We have a beautiful ſilk worm north-eaſt of Bengal, that feeds on the Ricinus, whence I call it Phalaena Ricini: it is ſea green, with ſoft ſpines, very large, and voracious, and ſpins a coarſe, but ſtrong and uſeful ſilk. The moth is of great ſize, with elegant dark plumage.—Is it known to European Naturaliſts?"—<hi>In a collection of papers published by</hi> Dr. ANDERSON, <hi>in</hi> MADRAS, 1788, 1789.—M. Le Bon, Reaumur, Roeſel, and ſeveral others, have attempted to weave the ſilk of ſpiders, as a ſubſtitute for that of ſilk worms, but their experiments rather amuſe, and point out the ingenuity of the propoſers, than promiſe to be uſeful; for after many trials, it appears that the ſilk of ſpiders would be inferior in luſtre, and far more expenſive than that of ſilk worms. Sir G. Staunton alludes to theſe experiments in his deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Java foreſts. "In ſome open ſpots were found webs of ſpiders, woven with threads of ſo ſtrong a texture, as not eaſily to be divided without a cutting inſtrument; they ſeemed to render feaſible the idea of him, who, in the ſouthern provinces of Europe, propoſed a manufacture from ſpiders' threads; which is ſo ridiculous to the eyes of thoſe who have only viewed the flimſy webs ſuck inſects ſpin in England."—Many other ſubſtances of a ſoft texture have alſo been wrought into a variety of trifling articles, as gloves, ſtockings, &amp;c. of the fibres of Aſbeſtos earth, or mountain flax, beard of the large <hi>Pinna</hi> ſhell, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                        </note>. Sir. G. Staunton ſpeaks of the culture of ſilk worms in China, but only of the common ſort. It will gratify curioſity, if not prove advantageous, ſhould future obververs aſcertain what kind of
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:127"/>inſect the Chineſe appropriate to making ſilk, and whether P. Atlas is of the number, as has been conjectured.</p>

                        <note n="c" place="bottom">Fabricius divides theſe two families of Linnaean Libellulae into three diſtinct genera; the firſt retains the Linnaean name, the ſecond and third are called Aeſhna and Agrion. Their moſt eſſential charaſters are taken from the form and ſituation of the mouth, and therefore require a deep magnifier to determine then with accuracy. We have examined thoſe parts in the greater number of the ſpecies Fabricius has deſcribed, and find his characters agree, except in one inſtance; but, which alone proves the impracticability of adopting the whole of his ſyſtem: he deſcribes <hi>Libellula Chinenſis,</hi> and refers to the only figure that has been given of it, in one of the plates of Edwards's Natural Hiſtory of Birds, 1745. Had he ever ſeen and examined this rare ſpecies, he muſt have referred it to his genus <hi>Agrion,</hi> each of the lips being biſid, or two-cleſt, as in Libellula virgo and puella,—the eſſential characteristic of the genus Agrion; for the mouths of the Libellulae of Fabricius differ altogether in ſtructure, and are not notched in the ſlighteſt degree, as Libellula clavata, ferruginea, 6 maculata, and the European ſpecies Libellula depreſſa, will ſufficiently illuſtrate.</note>. We reject his generic definition, becauſe it clearly belongs to the Linnaean Libellulae. Libellula clavata muſt be placed with the European L. grandis and forcipata.—It is ſcarce, and has never been figured before.</p>

                     <p>This remarkable creature is peculiar to ſome parts of the Chineſe empire. It is not the largeſt of the genus, known; yet it is of ſufficient magnitude to excite terror and diſguſt. To an European, who has ſeen only the indigenous ſpiders of his own country, a ſpecies five or ſix inches in length, and nearly the ſame in breadth, muſt appear a frightful creature: Aranea Maculata ſometimes exceeds that ſize; but it has not the forbidding aſpect of moſt inſects of the ſame genus. The legs are unuſually long, and the body ſlender. In its general appearance, it reſembles ſome kinds of the <hi>Phalangiae</hi> that are known in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land by the vulgar name <hi>Harveſt men,</hi> being generally ſeen about that time of the year.</p>
                     <p>It has been obſerved, that nature oftentimes adorns the moſt deformed and loathſome of her creatures in the richeſt diſplay of colours; and this is eſpecially noticed in many ſorts of ſnakes, toads, lizards, —c. Spiders ſeem alſo of this deſcription: to a form the moſt hideous we frequently find united a brilliance of colours, and elegance of marking, that is ſcarcely excelled by any of the butterfly tribe,—the moſt beautiful of all lepidopterous inſects. Our preſent ſubject is a ſtriking proof of the latter part of this obſervation. The three figures in our plate of Aranca Maculata exhibit a front and a profile view of the inſect, together with the front of the head at the third figure. The head is furniſhed with two very ſtrong black mandi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, each terminated in an extremely acute point. The fore part of the thorax, which is wholly of a fine ſilky appearance, and the colour of ſilver, bending over the mandibles in the form of an arch, or circular head-piece, give it the reſemblance of a black head with a crown of ſilver on the brow. This appearance is heightened in no ſmall degree by three rugged prominences, one in the centre, and another on each ſide, on the upper part; and by the minute black eyes, which, like thoſe of moſt ſpiders, ſparkle with the luſtre
<pb facs="tcp:0808300200:138"/>of ſmall gems. Theſe eyes are eight in number, four are placed immediately in the front of the ſilver-coloured circular front piece, and on each ſide are two more at equal diſtances, but rather in oblique positions.</p>
                     <p>The body is really beautiful, the chief colour is deep brown, ſtrongly tinged with bright purple; a broad ſtripe of orange colour paſſes down the abdomen from the thorax to the apex: the whole is elegantly marked with a variety of cream-coloured lines and ſpots interſecting each other. Very little hair is found on any part of this ſpider except on the thorax, which being rubbed off, diſcovers a hard teſtaceous black ſubſtance beneath.</p>
                     <p>Fabricius is the only author who has deſcribed this inſect: it has never been figured in any work what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as appears by the lateſt works of Fabricius, and our own obſervation. It is not always the moſt deciſive method to determine the ſpecies from a conciſe deſcription; but this is ſometimes unavoidable, and in the preſent inſtance the deſcription given by Fabricius accords in every reſpect with our ſpecimen. The only inſect with which it could poſſibly be confounded is Aranea Pilipes, which alſo has never been figured; it differs however from Aranea Maculata in the very hairy clothing of the legs, and it has alſo two ſilver ſtripes down the back: a ſtriking ſpecific diſtinction to ſeparate it from our inſect. It is alſo a native of the Eaſt Indies, but not of China, that we are informed.</p>

                     <p>The Linnaean <hi>Cancri</hi> are numerous, and include many ſpecies not leſs ſingular in appearance than the extraordinary creature before us. Indeed, ſome ſpecies are ſo extremely different from the reſt, both in ſtructure and manners of life, that we cannot heſitate in concluding the Linnaean character of the genus defective and indefinite. This may be obſerved in ſeveral of the ſpecies Linnaeus himſelf deſcribed, and throughout a more extenſive number of thoſe diſcovered ſince the time of that author. It is evident Linnaeus could never reconcile the ſubdiviſions of the two principal families; the <hi>Brachyuri</hi> and <hi>Macrouri;</hi> or crabs with ſhort and long tails; and later naturaliſts have ventured, with propriety, to alter this part of his arrangement. The <hi>Pagarus, Hippa, Scyllaris, Aſtacus, Squilla,</hi> and <hi>Gammarus,</hi> are ſo many new genera, formed of the Linnaean tribes of <hi>Cancri</hi> in the laſt Syſtem of Fabricius. The genus, to which Fabricius retains the name <hi>Cancer,</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from the reſt, by having four ſhort filiform antennae; with the extreme articulation bifid, as we obſerve in the preceding ſpecies. This author follows Degeer in deſcribing the Cancer Mantis, and alters the generic name to Squilla: he obſerves, that this genus is entirely diſtinct from the <hi>Cancri,</hi> and we are of the ſame opinion, but adhere to the Linnaean genera, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſpecies, <hi>Mantis,</hi> was deſcribed by Linnaeus, and it may be improper therefore to remove it, to a new genus, in any partial ſurvey of his ſyſtem.

Theſe noiſome creatures were known only by deſcription to ſome of the gentlemen in the embaſſy, who had not viſited the ſouthern parts of Europe: the ſight of ſuch, for the firſt time, excited a degree of hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in their minds; and it ſeemed to them to be a ſufficient objection to the country, that it produced theſe animals." Sir George however adds, that no accident happened in that inſtance.—The ſpecies of Scolopendra he alludes to, is probably <hi>Morſitans,</hi> which is common in many parts of the world, but is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſound of a frightful ſize, and in vaſt abundance, in the two Indies.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="tcp:0808300200:145"/>Many authors have deſcribed this creature. In the voluminous works of Seba we find ſeveral ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens of it from different countries, differing materially in ſize, and ſome trifling particulars, but all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing the diſtinguiſhing characters of Scolopendra Morſitans. The largeſt of theſe exceed our figure in magnitude, being near fourteen inches in length: this he calls <hi>Millepeda major</hi> ex nova Hiſpania. His figure of <hi>Millepeda Africanae</hi> is about the ſize of our Chineſe ſpecimen. He has alſo a third and fourth figure, <hi>Millepeda Orientalis</hi> and <hi>Millepeda Celonica, mas:</hi> the latter is the ſame length as our figure, but the body is very narrow. Millepeda Orientalis is alſo the ſame length, but the body is very broad. Some of theſe inſects are not four inches in length.</p>
                     <p>Authors agree that they vary exceedingly in ſize<note n="s" place="bottom">Theſe creatures differ from moſt inſects in their manner of growth, inſomuch that it it impoſſible to aſcertain when they are of their full ſize. The ſegments of the body increaſe as they advance in age, which circumſtance renders it difficult oftentimes to determine the ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, without a minute examination of its other characters.</note> and colour. De Geer deſcribes them to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times deep reddiſh brown; at others the colour of yellow ochre. The figure in Cateſby's Natural Hiſtory of Carolina is light brown; we have ſpecimens of a livid yellow, and have ſeen others ſtrongly tinged with red.</p>
                     <p>The laſt pair of legs are conſiderably larger than the others, and are armed with ſmall black ſpines. The legs terminate in very ſharp hooks or nails of a ſhining black colour. All the other legs are alſo fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a ſmaller nail of the ſame ſhape and colour.</p>
                     <p>M. Gronovius ſays that all its feet are very venemous; but the moſt formidable of its weapons are the two ſharp, hooked inſtruments that are placed under the mouth, and with which it deſtroys its prey.</p>
                     <p>Lewenhoeck having examined theſ inſtruments with a microſcope, he found a ſmall opening at the extremity of each, and a channel from them into the body of the creature. Through this channel he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed poſes the Scolopendra emits the poiſonous fluid into the wound it makes with the hooked inſtrument. That author further remarks, that he has ſeen a liquor on that part of living ſcolopendras. A figure of theſe inſtruments on the under ſide of the head, is repreſented in one of the diſſections in our plate.</p>
                     <p>The ſame author, wiſhing to aſcertain the influence of the poiſon of Scolopendra morſitans, placed a large fly within its reach. The Scolopendra at firſt took it between a pair of its middle feet, then paſſed it from one pair of feet to the next, till the fly was brought under the ſharp pointed inſtrument or crotchets at the head, which it plunged into the fly, and it died inſtantly. Notwithſtanding this experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, De Geer, Cateſby, and other authors, aſſert, that its bite ſeldom proves fatal to larger animals; but all agree that its poiſon is as dangerous as that of the ſcorpion.</p>
                     <p>This Scolopendra has eight eyes: they are very ſmall; four are placed on each ſide of the head near the antennae. In the diſſections a figure is given to exhibit the manner in which the four eyes are placed on one ſide.</p>
