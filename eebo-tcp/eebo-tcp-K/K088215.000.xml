            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

DEFENCE
OF
FREE-THINKING
IN
MATHEMATICS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </head>
            <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>HEN I read your Defence of
the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Mathematicians,
I could not, Sir, but admire
your Courage in aſſerting with
ſuch undoubting Aſſurance
things ſo eaſily diſproved. This to me
ſeemed unaccountable, till I reflected on
what you ſay (<hi>p.</hi> 32.) when upon my having
appealed to every thinking Reader, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
it be poſſible to frame any clear Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of Fluxions, you expreſs yourſelf
in the following manner, "Pray, Sir,
who are thoſe thinking Readers you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0030601100:3"/>
to? Are they Geometricians, or
Perſons wholly ignorant of Geometry?
If the former, I leave it to them: If the
latter, I ask how well are they qualified
to judge of the Method of Fluxions"?
It muſt be acknowledged you ſeem by this
Dilemma ſecure in the favour of one Part
of your Readers, and the ignorance of the
other. I am nevertheleſs perſuaded there
are fair and candid Men among the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians.
And for thoſe who are not
Mathematicians, I ſhall endeavour ſo to
unveil this Myſtery, and put the Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy
between us in ſuch a Light, as
that every Reader of ordinary Senſe and
Reflection may be a competent Judge
thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">II. "YOU expreſs an extreme Surprize
and Concern, that I ſhould take ſo
much Pains to depreciate one of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſt
Sciences, to diſparage and traduce
a Set of learned Men, whoſe Labours
ſo greatly conduce to the Honour of
this Iſland, (<hi>p.</hi> 5.) to leſſen the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
and Authority of Sir <hi>Iſaac New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
and his Followers, by ſhewing that
they are not ſuch Maſters of Reaſon as
they are generally preſumed to be; and
to depreciate the Science they profeſs,
by demonſtrating to the World, that it
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0030601100:4"/>
is not of the Clearneſs and Certainty as
is commonly imagined. All which, you
inſiſt, appears very ſtrange to you and
the reſt of that famous Univerſity, who
plainly ſee of how great Uſe Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Learning is to Mankind." Hence
you take occaſion to declaim on the
Uſefulneſs of Mathematics in the ſeveral
Branches, and then to redouble your Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize
and Amazement (<hi>p.</hi> 19. and 20.). To
all which Declamation I reply, that it is
quite beſide the Purpoſe. For I allow,
and always have allowed, its full claim of
Merit to whatever is uſeful and true in
the Mathematics: But that which is not
ſo, the leſs it employs Men's time and
thoughts, the better. And after all you
have ſaid or can ſay, I believe the unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced
Reader will think with me, that things
obſcure are not therefore ſacred; and that
it is no more a Crime to canvaſs and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect
unſound Principles or falſe Reaſonings
in Mathematics, than in any other Part
of Learning.</p>
            <p n="3">III. YOU are, it ſeems, much at a loſs
to underſtand the Uſefulneſs or Tendency
or Prudence of my Attempt. I thought I
had ſufficiently explained this in the <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſt.</hi>
But for your further Satisfaction ſhall
here tell you, it is very well known, that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0030601100:5"/>
ſeveral Perſons who deride Faith and Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries
in Religion, admit the Doctrine of
Fluxions for true and certain. Now if it be
ſhewn that Fluxions are really moſt incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible
Myſteries, and that thoſe, who
believe them to be clear and ſcientific, do
entertain an implicite Faith in the Author
of that Method; will not this furniſh a fair
<hi>Argumentum ad Hominem</hi> againſt Men, who
reject that very thing in Religion which they
admit in human Learning? And is it not a
proper Way to abate the Pride, and diſcredit
the Pretenſions of thoſe, who inſiſt upon
clear Ideas in Points of Faith, if it be ſhewn
that they do without them even in
Science?</p>
            <p n="4">IV. AS to my timeing this Charge; why
now and not before, ſince I had publiſhed
Hints thereof many Years ago? Surely I
am obliged to give no Account of this: If
what hath been ſaid in the Analyſt be not
ſufficient; ſuppoſe that I had not Leiſure,
or that I did not think it expedient, or that
I had no Mind to it. When a Man thinks
fit to publiſh any Thing, either in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics,
or in any other Part of Learning;
what avails it, or indeed what Right hath
any one to ask, why at this or that Time;
in this or that Manner; upon this or that
Motive? Let the Reader judge, if it ſuffice
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0030601100:6"/>
not, that what I publiſh is true, and that I
have a Right to publiſh ſuch Truths, when
and how I pleaſe, in a free Country.</p>
            <p n="5">V. I DO not ſay, that Mathematicians,
as ſuch, are Infidels; or that Geometry is
a Friend to Infidelity; which you untruly
inſinuate, as you do many other Things;
whence you raiſe Topics for invective: But
I ſay there are certain Mathematicians, who
are known to be ſo; and that there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers,
who are not Mathematicians, who
are influenced by a Regard for their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.
Some, perhaps, who live in the
Univerſity, may not be appriſed of this;
but the intelligent and obſerving Reader,
who lives in the World, and is acquainted
with the Humour of the Times, and the
Characters of Men, is well aware, there
are too many that deride Myſteries, and
yet admire Fluxions; who yield that Faith
to a mere Mortal, which they deny to
<hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe Religion they make it
their Study and Buſineſs to diſcredit. The
owning this is not to own, that Men who
reaſon well, are Enemies to Religion, as you
would repreſent it: On the contrary, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
to ſhew, that ſuch Men are defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
in Point of Reaſon and Judgment, and
that they do the very Thing they would
ſeem to deſpiſe.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0030601100:7"/>
VI. THERE are, I make no doubt,
among the Mathematicians many ſincere
Believers in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>; I know ſeveral
ſuch my ſelf; but I addreſſed my Analyſt
to an Infidel; and on very good Grounds,
I ſuppoſed that beſides him, there were
other Deriders of Faith, who had never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
a profound Veneration for Fluxions;
and I was willing to ſet forth the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
of ſuch Men. If there be no ſuch
Thing as Infidels, who pretend to Knowledge
in the modern Analyſis, I own my ſelf miſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
and ſhall gladly be found in a Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take;
but even in that Caſe, my Remarks
upon Fluxions are not the leſs true; nor
will it follow, that I have no Right to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
them on the Foot of humane Science,
even though Religion were quite uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,
and though I had no End to ſerve
but Truth. But you are very angry (<hi>P.</hi> 13
<hi>and</hi> 14.) that I ſhould enter the Liſts with
reaſoning Infidels, and attack them upon
their Pretenſions to Science: And hence
you take Occaſion to ſhew your Spleen a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
the Clergy. I will not take upon me
to ſay, that I know you to be a Minute
Philoſopher your ſelf: But I know, the
Minute Philoſophers make juſt ſuch Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments
as you do to our Church, and are
juſt as angry, as you can be, at any who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
to defend Religion by Reaſon. If
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0030601100:8"/>
we reſolve all into Faith, they laugh at us
and our Faith: And if we attempt to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
they are angry at us: They pretend
we go out of our Province, and they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
to us a blind implicite Faith.
Such is the Inconſiſtence of our Adverſaries.
But it is to be hoped, there will never be
wanting Men to deal with them at their
own Weapons; and to ſhew, they are by
no Means thoſe Maſters of Reaſon, which
they would fain paſs for.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. I DO not ſay, as you would repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
me, that we have no better Reaſon for
our Religion, than you have for Fluxions:
But I ſay, that an Infidel, who believes the
Doctrine of Fluxions, acts a very incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
Part, in pretending to reject the
Chriſtian Religion, becauſe he cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
what he doth not comprehend; or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he cannot aſſent without Evidence;
or becauſe he cannot ſubmit his Faith to
Authority. Whether there are ſuch Infidels,
I ſubmit to the Judgment of the Reader.
For my own Part I make no Doubt of it,
having ſeen ſome ſhrewd Signs thereof my
ſelf, and having been very credibly informed
thereof by others. Nor doth this Charge
ſeem the leſs credible, for your being ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
touched, and denying it with ſo much
Paſſion. You, indeed, do not ſtick to affirm,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0030601100:9"/>
that the perſons, who informed me are <hi>a
pack of baſe, profligate, and impudent liars,</hi>
(<hi>P.</hi> 27.) How far the Reader will think fit
to adopt your paſſions, I cannot ſay; but I
can truly ſay, the late celebrated Mr <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon</hi>
is one of the perſons, whom you are
pleaſed to characterize in thoſe modeſt and
mannerly terms. He aſſured me that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity
of a certain noted Mathematician,
ſtill living, was one principal reaſon aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by a witty man of thoſe times for his
being an Infidel. Not, that I imagine Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry
diſpoſeth Men to Infidelity; but that
from other cauſes, ſuch as Preſumption, Ig<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>norance,
or Vanity, like other Men, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metricians
alſo become Infidels, and that
the ſuppoſed light and evidence of their
Science gains credit to their Infidelity.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. "YOU reproach me with Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny,
detraction and artifice (<hi>P.</hi> 15.)
You recommend ſuch means as are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent
and juſt, rather than the crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
method of leſſening or detracting
from my opponents (<hi>ibid.</hi>) You accuſe
me of the <hi>Odium Theologicum,</hi> the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate
Zeal of Divines, that I do
<hi>ſtare ſuper vias antiquas,</hi>" (<hi>P.</hi> 13.) with
much more to the ſame effect. For all
which charge I depend on the reader's
candour, that he will not take your word,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0030601100:10"/>
but read and judge for himſelf. In which
caſe he will be able to diſcern (though he
ſhould be no Mathematician) how paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
and unjuſt your reproaches are, and
how poſſible it is for a Man to cry out
againſt Calumny and practiſe it in the
ſame breath. Conſidering how impatient
all Mankind are when their prejudices are
looked into, I do not wonder to ſee you
rail and rage at the rate you do. But if
your own Imagination be ſtrongly ſhocked
and moved, you cannot therefore conclude,
that a ſincere endeavour to free a ſcience,
ſo uſeful and ornamental to Humane Life,
from thoſe ſubtilties, obſcurities, and para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes,
which render it inacceſſible to moſt
Men, will be thought a criminal under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
by ſuch as are in their right Mind.
Much leſs can you hope that an illuſtrious
ſeminary of Learned Men, which hath
produced ſo many free-ſpirited inquirers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Truth, will at once enter into your paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and degenerate into a neſt of Bigots.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. I OBSERVE upon the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency
of certain Infidel Analyſts. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
ſome defects in the principles of the
modern Analyſis. I take the liberty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently
to diſſent from Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton.</hi> I
propoſe ſome helps to abridge the trouble
of Mathematical Studies, and render them
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0030601100:11"/>
more uſeful. What is there in all this,
that ſhould make you declaim on the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs
of practical Mathematics? that
ſhould move you to cry out <hi>Spain, Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
Odium Theologicum</hi>? By what figure
of Speech, do you extend, what is ſaid of
the modern Analyſis, to Mathematics in
general, or what is ſaid of Mathematical
Infidels to all Mathematicians, or the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futing
an errour in Science to burning or
hanging the Authors? But it is nothing
new or ſtrange, that Men ſhould chooſe to
indulge their paſſions, rather than quit
their opinions how abſurd ſoever. Hence
the frightful viſions and tragical uproars of
Bigotted Men, be the Subject of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry
what it will. A very remarkable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
of this you give (<hi>P.</hi> 27.) where,
upon my having ſaid that a deference to
certain Mathematical Infidels, as I was
credibly informed, had been one motive to
Infidelity, you ask with no ſmall emotion,
"For God's ſake are we in <hi>England</hi> or in
<hi>Spain</hi>? Is this the language of a Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
who is whiſpering an Inquiſitor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>"
And, the page before, you exclaim in the
following Words; "Let us burn or hang
up all the Mathematicians in <hi>Great
Britain,</hi> or halloo the mob upon them to
tear them to pieces every Mother's Son
of them, <hi>Tros Rutuluſve fuat,</hi> Laymen
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0030601100:12"/>

to ſee how vain all this Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy
of yours is. And if he be as tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly
ſatisfied as I am, that the cauſe
of Fluxions cannot be defended by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
he will be as little ſurpriſed as I am,
to ſee you betake your ſelf to the arts of
all bigotted men, raiſing terror, and cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
in the paſſions to your aſſiſtance.
Whether thoſe Rhetorical flouriſhes about
the Inquiſition and the Gallows are not
quite ridiculous, I leave to be determined
by the Reader. Who will alſo judge
(though he ſhould not be skilled in Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metry)
whether I have given the leaſt
grounds for this and a World of ſuch

honoured or obliged by you, for
having defended their Doctrine, in the
ſame manner as any declaiming Bigot
would defend Tranſubſtantiation? The
ſame falſe colours, the ſame intemperate
Sallies, and the ſame Indignation againſt
common Senſe!</p>
            <p n="12">XII. IN a matter of mere Science,
where authority hath nothing to do, you
conſtantly endeavour to overbear me with
authorities, and load me with envy. If I
ſee a Sophiſm in the writings of a great
Author, and, in compliment to his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
ſuſpect he could hardly be
quite ſatisfy'd with his own demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:
This ſets you on declaiming for
ſeveral pages. It is pompouſly ſet forth,
as a criminal method of detracting from
great men, as a concerted project to leſſen
their reputation, as making them paſs for
impoſtors. If I publiſh my free thoughts,
which I have as much right to publiſh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0030601100:14"/>
and vanity and the love of oppoſition.
Though perhaps my late publication, of
what had been hinted twenty five years
ago, may acquit me of this charge in the
eyes of an impartial Reader. But when I
conſider the perplexities that beſet a man,
who undertakes to defend the doctrine
of Fluxions, I can eaſily forgive your
anger.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. TWO ſorts of learned men there
are; one, who candidly ſeek Truth by
rational means. Theſe are never averſe
to have their principles looked into, and
examined by the teſt of Reaſon. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſort there is, who learn by <hi>route</hi> a

which happen to be in vogue. Theſe
betray themſelves by their anger and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe,
whenever their principles are freely
canvaſſed. But you muſt not expect, that
your Reader will make himſelf a party to
your paſſions or your prejudices. I freely
own that Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> hath ſhew'd
himſelf an extraordinary Mathematician,
a profound Naturaliſt, a Perſon of the
greateſt Abilities and Erudition. Thus far
I can readily go, but I cannot go the
lengths that you do. I ſhall never ſay of
him as you do, <hi>Veſtigia pronus adoro,</hi>
(<hi>p.</hi> 70.) This ſame adoration that you pay
to him, I will pay only to Truth.</p>

XIV. YOU may, indeed, your ſelf be
an Idolater of whom you pleaſe: But
then you have no right to inſult and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim
at other men, becauſe they do not
adore your Idol. Great as Sir <hi>Iſaac New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
was, I think he hath, on more occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
than one, ſhew'd himſelf not to be
infallible. Particularly, his demonſtration
of the Doctrine of Fluxions I take to be
defective, and I cannot help thinking that
he was not quite pleaſed with it himſelf.
And yet this doth not hinder but the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
may be uſeful, conſidered as an art
of Invention. You, who are a Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tician,
muſt acknowledge, there have been
divers ſuch methods admitted in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics,
which are not demonſtrative. Such,
for inſtance, are the Inductions of Doctor
<hi>Wallis</hi> in his Arithmetic of Infinites, and
ſuch, what <hi>Harriot</hi> and, after him, <hi>Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cartes</hi>
have wrote concerning the roots of
affected Aequations. It will not, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs,
thence follow that thoſe methods are
uſeleſs; but only, that they are not to
be allowed of as Premiſſes in a ſtrict
Demonſtration.</p>
            <p n="15">XV. NO great Name upon earth ſhall
ever make me accept things obſcure for
clear, or Sophiſms for Demonſtrations.
Nor may you ever hope to deter me from
freely ſpeaking what I freely think, by
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0030601100:16"/>
thoſe arguments <hi>ab invidia</hi> which at every
turn you employ againſt me. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
your ſelf (<hi>P.</hi> 52.) as a man, <hi>whoſe
higheſt Ambition is in the loweſt degree to
imitate Sir</hi> Iſaac Newton. It might, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
have ſuited better with your appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of <hi>Philalethes,</hi> and been altogether
as laudable, if your higheſt ambition had
been to diſcover Truth. Very conſiſtently
with the character you give of your ſelf,
you ſpeak of it as a ſort of crime (<hi>P.</hi> 70.)
to think it poſſible, you ſhould ever <hi>ſee
further, or go beyond Sir</hi> Iſaac Newton.
And I am perſuaded you ſpeak the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of many more beſides your ſelf.
But there are others who are not afraid to
ſift the Principles of human Science, who
think it no honour to imitate the greateſt
man in his Defects, who even think it no
crime to deſire to know, not only beyond
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> but beyond all Mankind.
And whoever thinks otherwiſe, I appeal
to the Reader, whether he can properly be
called a Philoſopher.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. BECAUSE I am not guilty
of your mean Idolatry, you inveigh againſt
me as a perſon conceited of my own Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities;

to ſay) that a Fluxion is incomprehenſible:

this? Do you attempt to clear up the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of a Fluxion or a Difference? Nothing
like it; "you only aſſure me (upon your

may be clearly conceived and diſtinctly
comprehended; and that if I am puz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zled

yet others do". But can you think, Sir,
I ſhall take your word when I refuſe to

XVIII. UPON this point every Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
of common ſenſe may judge as well as
the moſt profound Mathematician. The
ſimple apprehenſion of a thing defined is
not made more perfect by any ſubſequent
progreſs in Mathematics. What any man
evidently knows, he knows as well as you
or Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton.</hi> And every one can
know whether the object of this method
be (as you would have us think) clearly
conceivable. To judge of this, no depth
of Science is requiſite, but only a bare at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to what paſſes in his own mind.
And the ſame is to be underſtood of all
definitions in all Sciences whatſoever. In
none of which can it be ſuppoſed, that
a man of Senſe and Spirit will take any
definition or principle upon truſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
ſifting it to the bottom, and trying
how far he can or he cannot conceive it.
This is the courſe I have taken and ſhall
take, however you and your Brethren may
declaim againſt it, and place it in the moſt
invidious Light.</p>
            <p n="19">XIX. IT is uſual with you to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
me to look over a ſecond time, to
conſult, examine, weigh the words of Sir
<hi>Iſaac.</hi> In anſwer to which I will ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſay, that I have taken as much
pains as (I ſincerely believe) any man
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0030601100:19"/>
living, to underſtand that great Author,
and to make ſenſe of his principles. No
induſtry nor caution nor attention, I aſſure
you, have been wanting on my part. So
that, if I do not underſtand him, it is not
my fault but my misfortune. Upon other
ſubjects you are pleaſed to compliment me
with depth of thought and uncommon
abilities, (<hi>P.</hi> 5. and 84.) But I freely own,
I have no pretence to thoſe things. The
only advantage I pretend to, is that I have
always thought and judged for my ſelf.
And, as I never had a maſter in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics,
ſo I fairly followed the dictates of
my own mind in examining, and cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
the authors I read upon that ſubject,
with the ſame freedom that I uſed upon
any other; taking nothing upon truſt, and
believing that no writer was infallible.
And a man of moderate parts, who takes
this painful courſe in ſtudying the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of any Science, may be ſuppoſed
to walk more ſurely than thoſe of greater
abilities, who ſet out with more ſpeed and
leſs care.</p>
            <p n="20">XX. WHAT I inſiſt on is, that the
idea of a Fluxion, ſimply conſidered, is
not at all improved or amended by any
progreſs, though ever ſo great, in the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis:
neither are the demonſtrations of the
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0030601100:20"/>
general rules of that method at all cleared
up by applying them. The reaſon of
which is, becauſe in operating or calculat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
men do not return to contemplate the
original principles of the method, which
they conſtantly preſuppoſe, but are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
in working, by notes and ſymbols,
denoting the Fluxions ſuppoſed to have
been at firſt explained, and according to
rules ſuppoſed to have been at firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated.
This I ſay to encourage
thoſe, who are not far gone in theſe
Studies, to uſe intrepidly their own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
without a blind or a mean de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
to the beſt of Mathematicians, who
are no more qualify'd than they are, to
judge of the ſimple apprehenſion, or the
evidence of what is delivered in the firſt
elements of the method; men by further
and frequent uſe or exerciſe becoming only
more accuſtomed to the ſymbols and rules,
which doth not make either the foregoing
notions more clear, or the foregoing proofs
more perfect. Every Reader of common
ſenſe, that will but uſe his faculties, knows
as well as the moſt profound Analyſt what
idea he frames or can frame of Velocity
without motion, or of motion without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion,
of magnitude which is neither fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite
nor infinite, or of a quantity having
no magnitude which is yet diviſible, of a
figure where there is no ſpace, of proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0030601100:21"/>
between nothings, or of a real product
from nothing multiplied by ſomething. He
need not be far gone in Geometry to know,
that obſcure principles are not to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
in Demonſtration: That if a man
deſtroys his own Hypotheſis, he at the
ſame time deſtroys what was built upon it:
That error in the premiſes, not rectified,
muſt produce error in the concluſion.</p>
            <p n="21">XXI. IN my opinion the greateſt men
have their Prejudices. Men learn the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Science from others: And every
learner hath a deference more or leſs to
authority, eſpecially the young learners,
few of that kind caring to dwell long up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
principles, but inclining rather to take
them upon truſt: And things early admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
by repetition become familiar: And
this familiarity at length paſſeth for Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
Now to me it ſeems, there are
certain points tacitly admitted by Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticians,
which are neither evident nor
true. And ſuch points or principles ever
mixing with their reaſoning do lead them
into paradoxes and perplexities. If the
great author of the fluxionary method was
early imbued with ſuch notions, it would
only ſhew he was a man. And if by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
of ſome latent error in his principles
a man be drawn into fallacious reaſonings,
it is nothing ſtrange that he ſhould take
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0030601100:22"/>
them for true: And, nevertheleſs, if; when
urged by perplexities and uncouth conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences,
and driven to arts and ſhifts, he
ſhould entertain ſome doubt thereof, it is
no more than, one may naturally ſuppoſe,
might befall a great genious grappling with
an inſuperable difficulty: Which is the
light in which I have placed Sir <hi>Iſaac New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Analyſt,</hi> Sect. xviij</note>.
Herereupon you are pleaſed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
that I repreſent the great author
not only as a weak but an ill man, as a
Deceiver and an Impoſtor. The Reader will
judge how juſtly.</p>
            <p n="22">XXII. AS to the reſt of your colourings
and gloſſes, your reproaches and inſults
and outcries, I ſhall paſs them over, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deſiring the Reader not to take your
word, but read what I have written, and
he will want no other anſwer. It hath
been often obſerved that the worſt cauſe
produceth the greateſt clamour, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
you are ſo clamorous throughout
your defence that the Reader, although
he ſhould be no Mathematician, provided
he underſtands common ſenſe and hath
obſerved the ways of men, will be apt to
ſuſpect you are in the wrong. It ſhould
ſeem, therefore, that your Brethren the
Analyſts are but little obliged to you, for
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0030601100:23"/>
this new method of declaiming in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics.
Whether they are more obliged
by your Reaſoning I ſhall now examine.</p>
            <p n="23">XXIII. YOU ask me (<hi>p.</hi> 32.) where I
find Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> uſing ſuch expreſſions
as the Velocities of Velocities, the ſecond,
third, and fourth Velocities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This you
ſet forth as a pious fraud and unfair repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation.
I anſwer, that if according to
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> a Fluxion be the veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of an increment, then according to him
I may call the Fluxion of a Fluxion the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
of a Velocity. But for the truth of the
antecedent ſee his introduction to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drature
of Curves, where his own words are,
<hi>motuum velincrementorum velocitates nominan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do
Fluxiones.</hi> See alſo the ſecond Lemma of
the ſecond Book of his mathematical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of natural Philoſophy, where he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth
himſelf in the following manner,
<hi>velocitates incrementorum ac decrementorum,
quas etiam, motus, mutationes &amp; fluxiones
quantitatum nominare licet.</hi> And that he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
Fluxions of Fluxions, or ſecond, third,
fourth Fluxions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſee his Treatiſe of the
Quadrature of Curves. I ask now, Is it
not plain, that if a Fluxion be a Velocity,
then the Fluxion of a Fluxion may agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
thereunto be called the Velocity of a
Velocity? In like manner if by a Fluxion
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0030601100:24"/>
is meant a naſcent augment, will it not then
follow, that the Fluxion of a Fluxion, or
ſecond Fluxion is the naſcent augment of
a naſcent augment? Can any thing be plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er?
Let the Reader now judge who is unfair.</p>
            <p n="24">XXIV. I HAD obſerved, that the Great
Author had proceeded illegitimately, in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the Fluxion or moment of the Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
of two flowing quantities; and that
he did not fairly get rid of the Rectangle of
the moments. In anſwer to this you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
that the error ariſing from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſuch rectangle (allowing it to be
an error) is ſo ſmall that it is inſignificant.
This you dwell upon and examplify to no
other purpoſe, but to amuſe your Reader
and miſlead him from the Queſtion; which
in truth is not concerning the accuracy of
computing or meaſuring in practice, but
concerning the accuracy of the reaſoning
in ſcience. That this was really the caſe,
and that the ſmallneſs of the practical error
no wiſe concerns it, muſt be ſo plain to
any one who reads the Analyſt, that I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
how you could be ignorant of it.</p>
            <p n="25">XXV. YOU would fain perſuade your
Reader, that I make an abſurd quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
errors of no ſignificancy in practice,
and repreſent Mathematicians as proceeding
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0030601100:25"/>
blindfold in their approximations; in all
which I cannot help thinking there is on
your part either great ignorance or great
diſingenuity. If you mean to defend the
reaſonableneſs and uſe of approximations, or
of the method of Indiviſibles, I have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to ſay. But then you muſt remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
this is not the Doctrine of Fluxions:
It is none of that Analyſis with which I
am concerned. That I am far from quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>relling
at approximations in Geometry is
manifeſt from the thirty third and fifty
third Queries in the Analyſt. And that
the method of Fluxions pretends to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more than the method of Indiviſibles
is plain; becauſe Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> diſclaims this
method as not Geometrical<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>See the Schelium at the end of the firſt Section,</hi> Lib. 1. Phil. Nat. Princip. Math..</note> And that
the method of Fluxions is ſuppoſed accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
in Geometrical rigour is manifeſt, to
whoever conſiders what the Great Author
writes about it; eſpecially in his Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction
to the Quadrature of Curves, where
he ſaith <hi>In rebus mathematicis errores quam

and yet you ſeem ignorant thereof,
and indeed, of the very End and Deſign

Fluxions.</p>
            <p n="26">
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0030601100:26"/>
XXVI. AS oft as you talk of finite quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities
inconſiderable in practice, Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>
diſowns your apology. <hi>Cave,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellexeris
finitas.</hi> And although Quantities
leſs than ſenſible may be of no account in
practice, yet none of your maſters, nor will
even you yourſelf venture to ſay, they are
of no account in Theory and in Reaſoning.
The application in groſs practice is not the
point queſtioned, but the rigour and juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the reaſoning. And it is evident
that, be the ſubject ever ſo little, or ever
ſo inconſiderable, this doth not hinder but
that a perſon treating thereof may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
very great errors in Logic, which Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical
errors are in no wiſe to be meaſured
by the ſenſible or practical inconveniences
thence ariſing, which, perchance, may be
none at all. It muſt be owned, that after
you have miſlead and amuſed your leſs qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified
Reader (as you call him) you return
to the real point in controverſy, and ſet
your ſelf to juſtifie Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s method of
getting rid of the abovementioned Rectan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle.
And here I muſt intreat the Reader to
obſerve how fairly you proceed.</p>
            <p n="27">XXVII. FIRST then you affirm (<hi>P.</hi> 44.)
"that, neither in the Demonſtration of the
Rule for finding the Fluxion of the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle
of two flowing quantities, nor in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0030601100:27"/>
any thing preceding or following it, is
any mention ſo much as once made of
the increment of the rectangle of ſuch
flowing quantities." Now I affirm the
direct contrary. For in the very paſſage by
you quoted in this ſame page, from the firſt
caſe of the ſecond lemma of the ſecond
Book of Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Principles, beginning
with <hi>Rectangulum quodvis motu perpetuo
auctum,</hi> and ending with <hi>igitur laterum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementis
totis a et b generatur rectanguli
incrementum a B</hi> x <hi>b A Q. E. D.</hi> In this
very paſſage, I ſay, is expreſs mention made
of the increment of ſuch rectangle. As this
is matter of fact, I refer it to the Reader's
own eyes. Of what rectangle have we here
the Increment? Is it not plainly of that
whoſe ſides have <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b</hi> for their <hi>Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menta
tota,</hi> that is, of <hi>AB</hi>? Let any Reader
judge whether it be not plain from the
words, the ſenſe, and the context, that the
Great Author in the end of his demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
underſtands his <hi>incrementum</hi> as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the <hi>Rectangulum quodvis</hi> at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.
Is not the ſame alſo evident from the
very Lemma it ſelf prefixed to the Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration?
The ſenſe whereof is (as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
there explains it) that if the moments
of the flowing quantities <hi>A</hi> and <hi>B</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<hi>a</hi> and <hi>b,</hi> then the <hi>momentum vel mutatio
geniti rectanguli AB</hi> will be <hi>a B</hi> x <hi>b A.</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0030601100:28"/>
Either therefore the concluſion of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration
is not the thing which was to
be demonſtrated, or the <hi>rectanguli incremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum

            <p n="28">XXVIII. ALL this is ſo plain that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can be more ſo; and yet you would
fain perplex this plain caſe by diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between an increment and a moment.
But it is evident to every one, who has any
notion of Demonſtration, that the <hi>incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi>
in the Concluſion muſt be the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum</hi>
in the Lemma; and to ſuppoſe it
otherwiſe is no credit to the Author. It is
in effect ſuppoſing him to be one who did
not know what he would demonſtrate. But
let us hear Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s own words: <hi>Earum
(quantitatum ſcilicet fluentium) incrementa
vel decrementa momentanea ſub nomine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentorum
intelligo.</hi> And you obſerve your
ſelf that he uſeth the word <hi>moment</hi> to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify
either an increment or decrement.
Hence, with an intention to puzzle me, you
propoſe the increment and decrement of
<hi>AB,</hi> and ask which of theſe I would call the
moment? The caſe, you ſay, is difficult. My
anſwer is very plain and eaſy, to wit, Either
of them. You, indeed, make a different
anſwer, and from the Author's ſaying that,
by a moment he underſtands either the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaneous
increment or decrement of the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0030601100:29"/>
flowing quantities, you would have us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
by a very wonderful inference, that
his moment is neither the increment nor
decrement thereof. Would it not be as good
an inference, Becauſe a number is either
odd or even, to conclude it is neither? Can
any one make ſenſe of this? Or can even
your ſelf hope that this will go down with
the Reader, how little ſoever qualified? It
muſt be owned, you endeavour to obtrude
this inference on him, rather by mirth and
humour than by reaſoning. You are merry,
I ſay, and (<hi>P.</hi> 46.) repreſent the two ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
quantities as pleading their
rights, as toſſing up croſs and pile, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting
amicably. You talk of their claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
preference, their agreeing, their boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs
and their gravity. And after this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
digreſſion you addreſs me in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
words.—Believe me there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy,
you muſt acquieſce. But my anſwer
is, that I will neither believe you nor ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce;
there is a plain remedy in common
ſenſe; and, to prevent ſurpriſe, I deſire the
Reader always to keep the controverted
point in view, to examine your reaſons,
and be cautious how he takes your word,
but moſt of all when you are poſitive or

XXIX. A PAGE or two after, you
very candidly repreſent your caſe to be that
of an Aſs between two bottles of hay; it
is your own expreſſion. The cauſe of your
perplexity is, that you know not whether
the velocity of <hi>AB</hi> increaſing or of <hi>AB</hi>
decreaſing is to be eſteemed the Fluxion, or
proportional to the moment of the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle.
My opinion, agreeably to what
hath been premiſed, is that either may be
deemed the Fluxion. But you tell us
"(<hi>P.</hi> 49.) that you think, the venerable
ghoſt of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> whiſpers you,
The Velocity you ſeek for is neither the
one nor the other of theſe, but is the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
which the flowing rectangle hath,
not while it is greater or leſs than <hi>AB,</hi>
but at that very inſtant of time that it is
<hi>AB.</hi>" For my part, in the rectangle
<hi>AB</hi> conſidered ſimply in it ſelf, without
either increaſing or diminiſhing, I can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
no velocity at all. And if the Reader
is of my mind, he will not take either your
word, or even the word of a Ghoſt, how
venerable ſoever, for velocity without mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
You proceed and tell us that, in like
manner, the moment of the rectangle is
neither its increment or decrement. This
you would have us believe on the authority
of his Ghoſt, in direct oppoſition to what
Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> himſelf aſſerted when alive. <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crementa</hi>

your ſtyle bid the Reader believe me, but
believe his eyes.</p>
            <p n="30">XXX. TO me it verily ſeems, that you
have undertaken the defence of what you
do not underſtand. To mend the matter,
you ſay, "you do not conſider <hi>AB</hi> as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
at either extremity of the moment,
but as extended to the middle of it; as
having acquired the one half of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and as being about to acquire the
other; or, as having loſt one half of it,
and being about to loſe the other." Now,
in the name of Truth, I intreat you to
tell what this moment is, to the middle
whereof the rectangle is extended? This
moment, I ſay, which is acquired, which
is loſt, which is cut in two, or diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into halfs? Is it a finite quantity, or an
infiniteſimal, or a mere limit, or nothing
at all? Take it in what ſenſe you will, I
cannot make your defence either conſiſtent
or intelligible. For if you take it in either
of the two former ſenſes, you contradict
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton.</hi> And if you take it in
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0030601100:32"/>
either of the latter, you contradict common
ſenſe; it being plain, that what hath no
magnitude, or is no quantity, cannot be
divided. And here I muſt intreat the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
to preſerve his full freedom of mind
intire, and not weakly ſuffer his judgment
to be overborn by your imagination and
your prejudices, by great names and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities,
by Ghoſts and Viſions, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
all by that extreme ſatisfaction and
complacency with which you utter your
ſtrange conceits; if words without a mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
may be called ſo. After having given
this unintelligible account, you ask with
your accuſtomed air, "What ſay you, Sir?
Is this a juſt and legitimate reaſon for
Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s proceeding as he did? I think
you muſt acknowledge it to be ſo." But
alas! I acknowledge no ſuch thing. I find
no ſenſe or reaſon in what you ſay. Let
the Reader find it if he can.</p>
            <p n="31">XXXI. IN the next Place (<hi>P.</hi> 50.) you
charge me with want of caution. "Inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much
(ſay you) as that quantity which
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> through his whole
Lemma, and all the ſeveral Caſes of it,
conſtantly calls a <hi>Moment,</hi> without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining
it to be either an increment or
decrement, is by you inconſiderately and
arbitrarily, and without any Shadow of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0030601100:33"/>
of Reaſou given, ſuppoſed and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to be an increment." To which
Charge I reply that it is as untrue as it is
peremptory. For that, in the foregoing
citation from the firſt caſe of Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s
Lemma, he expreſly determines it to be an
Increment. And as this particular Inſtance
or Paſſage was that which I objected to, it
was reaſonable and proper for me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the Moment in that ſame Light. But
take it increment or decrement as you will,
the Objections ſtill lie, and the Difficulties
are equally inſuperable. You then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to extoll the great Author of the fluxio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary
Method, and to beſtow ſome <hi>Bruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queries</hi>
upon thoſe who unadviſedly dare to
differ from him. To all which I ſhall give
no anſwer.</p>
            <p n="32">XXXII. AFTERWARDS to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
(as you ſay) all Scruple and Difficulty
about this affair, you obſerve that the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Rectangle determined by Sir
<hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> and the Increment of the
Rectangle determined by me, are perfectly
and exactly equal, ſuppoſing <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b</hi> to be
diminiſhed <hi>ad infinitum</hi>: and for proof of
this, you refer to the firſt Lemma of the
firſt Section of the firſt Book of Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s
Principles. I anſwer, that if <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b</hi> are
real quantities, then <hi>a b</hi> is ſomething, and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0030601100:34"/>
conſequently makes a real difference: but
if they are nothing, then the Rectangles
whereof they are coefficients become
nothing likewiſe: and conſequently the
<hi>momentum</hi> or <hi>incrementum,</hi> whether Sir
<hi>Iſaac</hi>'s or mine, are in that Caſe nothing
at all. As for the abovementioned Lem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,
which you refer to, and which you
wiſh I had conſulted ſooner, both for my
own ſake and for yours; I tell you I had
long ſince conſulted and conſidered it. But
I very much doubt whether you have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently
conſidered that Lemma, its De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,
and its Conſequences. For,
however that way of reaſoning may do in
the Method of <hi>exhauſtions,</hi> where quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
leſs than aſſignable are regarded as
nothing; yet for a Fluxioniſt writing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
momentums, to argue that quantities
muſt be equal becauſe they have no aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
difference, ſeems the moſt injudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Step that could be taken: it is direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
demoliſhing the very Doctrine you
would defend. For it will thence follow,
that all homogeneous momentums are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual,
and conſequently the velocities,
mutations, or fluxions proportional thereto,
are all likewiſe equal. There is, therefore,
only one proportion of equality through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
which at once overthrows the whole
Syſtem you undertake to defend. Your
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0030601100:35"/>
moments (I ſay) not being themſelves aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignable
quantities, their differences cannot
be aſſignable: and if this be true, by that
way of reaſoning it will follow, they are all
equal, upon which Suppoſition you cannot
make one Step in the Method of Fluxiors.
It appears from hence, how unjuſtly you
blame me (<hi>P.</hi> 32.) for omitting to give
any Account of that firſt Section of the
firſt Book of the <hi>Principia,</hi> wherein (you
ſay) the Foundation of the Method of
Fluxions is geometrically demonſtrated and
largely explained, and difficulties and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
againſt it are clearly ſolved. All
which is ſo far from being true, that the
very firſt and fundamental Lemma of that
Section is incompatible with, and ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
of the doctrine of Fluxions. And,
indeed, who ſees not that a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<hi>ad abſurdum more veterum</hi> proceeding
on a Suppoſition, that every difference
muſt be ſome given quantity, cannot be
admitted in, or conſiſt with, a method,
wherein Quantities, leſs than any given, are
ſuppoſed really to exiſt, and be capable of
diviſion?</p>
            <p n="33">XXXIII. THE next point you under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
to defend is that method for obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a rule to find the Fluxion of any
Power of a flowing Quantity, which is
delivered in the introduction to the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratures,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0030601100:36"/>
and conſidered in the Analyſt<note n="*" place="bottom">Sect. 13, 14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note>.
And here the queſtion between us is,
whether I have rightly repreſented the ſenſe
of thoſe words, <hi>evaneſcant jam augmenta
illa,</hi> in rendering them, let the increments
vaniſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> let the increments be nothing,
or let there be no increments? This you
deny, but, as your manner is, inſtead of
giving a reaſon you declaim. I, on the
contrary affirm, the increments muſt be
underſtood to be quite gone and abſolutely
nothing at all. My reaſon is, becauſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
that ſuppoſition you can never bring the
quantity or expreſſion <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> down to <gap reason="math">
                  <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the very thing aimed
at by ſuppoſing the evaneſcence. Say whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this be not the truth of the caſe?
Whether the former expreſſion is not to
be reduced to the latter? And whether this
can poſſibly be done ſo long as <hi>o</hi> is ſuppoſed
a real Quantity? I cannot indeed ſay
you are ſcrupulous about your affirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and yet I believe that even you will
not affirm this; it being moſt evident, that
the product of two real quantities is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
real; and that nothing real can be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0030601100:37"/>
rejected either according to the <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of
Geometry, or according to Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s own
principles; for the truth of which I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal
to all who know any thing of theſe
matters. Further by <hi>evaneſcent</hi> muſt either
be meant, let them (the increments) vaniſh
and become nothing, in the obvious ſenſe,
or elſe let them become infinitely ſmall.
But that this latter is not Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s ſenſe
is evident from his own words in the
very ſame page, that is, in the laſt of the
Introduction to his Quadratures, where he
expreſsly ſaith <hi>volui oſtendere quod in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodo
Fluxionum non opus fit figuras infinitè
parvas in Geometriam introducere.</hi> Upon
the whole, you ſeem to have conſidered this
affair ſo very ſuperficially, as greatly to
confirm me in the opinion, you are ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry
with, to wit, that Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s followers
are much more eager in applying his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod,
than accurate in examining his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.
You raiſe a duſt about evaneſcent
augments which may perhaps amuſe and
amaze your Reader, but I am much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
if it ever inſtructs or enlightens him.
For, to come to the point, thoſe evaneſcent
augments either are real quantities, or they
are not. If you ſay they are; I deſire to
know, how you get rid of the rejectaneous
quantity? If you ſay they are not; you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
get rid of thoſe quantities in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
whereof they are coefficients; but
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0030601100:38"/>
then you are of the ſame opinion with me,
"which opinion you are pleaſed to call
(<hi>P.</hi> 58.) a moſt palpable, inexcuſable,
and unpardonable blunder, although it
be a Truth moſt palpably evident".</p>
            <p n="34">XXXIV. NOTHING, I ſay, can be
plainer to any impartial Reader, than that
by the Evaneſcence of augments, in the
above cited paſſage, Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> means their
being actually reduced to nothing. But
to put it out of all doubt, that this is the
truth, and to convince even you, who ſhew
ſo little diſpoſition to be convinced, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you to look into his <hi>Analyſis per aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiones
infinitas</hi> (<hi>P.</hi> 20.) where, in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration
for demonſtrating the firſt rule
for the ſquaring of ſimple Curves, you
will find that on a parallel occaſion, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of an augment which is ſuppoſed to
vaniſh, he interprets the word <hi>evaneſcere</hi>
by <hi>eſſe nihil.</hi> Nothing can be plainer than
this, which at once deſtroys your defence.
And yet, plain as it is, I deſpair of making
you acknowledge it; though I am ſure
you feel it, and the Reader if he uſeth his
eyes muſt ſee it. The words <hi>Evaneſcere five
eſſe nihil</hi> do (to uſe your own expreſſion)
ſtare us in the face. Lo! "This is what
you call (<hi>P.</hi> 56.) ſo great, ſo unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
ſo horrid, ſo truly <hi>Boeotian</hi> a blunder"
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0030601100:39"/>
that, according to you, it was not poſſible
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> could be guilty of it.
For the future, I adviſe you to be more
ſparing of hard words: Since, as you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautiouſly
deal them about, they may
chance to light on your friends as well as
your adverſaries. As for my part, I ſhall
not retaliate. It is ſufficient to ſay you are
miſtaken, But I can eaſily pardon your
miſtakes. Though, indeed, you tell me
on this very occaſion, that I muſt expect
no quarter from Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s followers. And
I tell you that I neither expect nor deſire
any. My aim is truth. My reaſons I have
given. Confute them, if you can. But
think not to overbear me either with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities
or harſh words. The latter will
recoil upon your ſelves: The former in a
matter of ſcience are of no weight with
indifferent Readers; and as for Bigots, I
am not concerned about what they ſay or
think.</p>
            <p n="35">XXXV. IN the next place you pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
to declaim upon the following paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
taken from the ſeventeenth ſection of
the Analyſt. "Conſidering the various
arts and devices uſed by the great au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor

and in what different ways he attempts to

This paſſage you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain

to ſhew that placing the ſame

not the hard uſage it contains: But on the
contrary, that it is too modeſt, and not
ſo full and expreſſive of my ſenſe, as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps

it better if I ſhould ſay, the various <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent</hi>
accounts, which this great author
gives of his momentums and his fluxions,
may convince every intelligent Reader
that he had no clear and ſteady notions of
them, without which there can be no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration?
I own frankly that I ſee no
clearneſs or conſiſtence in them. You tell
me indeed, in <hi>Miltonic</hi> verſe, that the fault
is in my own eyes,
<q>
                  <l>So thick a drop ſerene has quench'd their orbs.</l>
                  <l>Or dim Suffuſion veil'd.</l>
               </q>
At the ſame time you acknowledge your

have enabled you to underſtand his Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.

But as for me who do not underſtand

not ſtill underſtand him"? May not I
anſwer, that I am offended for this very
reaſon; becauſe I cannot underſtand him
or make ſenſe of what he ſays? You ſay

clearly, to help me out.</p>
            <p n="36">XXXVI. YOU, Sir, with the bright
eyes, be pleaſed to tell me, whether Sir

ſhould be very glad, a perſon of ſuch lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous

and having interpreted them in what ſenſe
you will, that you would then conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend
to explain the Doctrine of ſecond,
third, and fourth Fluxions, and ſhew it
to be conſiſtent with common ſenſe if you
can. You ſeem to be very ſanguine when
you expreſs your ſelf in the following
terms. "I do aſſure you, Sir, from my
own Experience, and that of many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
whom I could name, that the
Doctrine may be clearly conceived and
diſtinctly comprehended" (<hi>p.</hi> 31.) And it
may be uncivil not to believe what you
ſo ſolemnly affirm, from your own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
But I muſt needs own, I ſhould
be better fatisfied of this, if, inſtead of
entertaining us with your Rhetoric, you
would vouchſafe to reconcile thoſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,

that ſeveral will be obliged to you who,
I may venture to ſay, underſtand thoſe
matters no more than my ſelf. But, if
I am not much miſtaken, you and your
friends will modeſtly decline this task.</p>
            <p n="37">XXXVII. I HAVE long ago done
what you ſo often exhort me to do, dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
read and conſidered the ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of this Doctrine given by the great
Author in different parts of his writings: and
upon the whole I could never make it out
to be conſiſtent and intelligible. I was
even led to ſay, "that one would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
to think, He was himſelf ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
of the juſtneſs of his own demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations:
and that he was not enough
pleaſed with any one Notion ſteadily
to adhere to it." After which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
"Thus much is plain that he own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf ſatisfied concerning certain
points, which nevertheleſs he could not
undertake to demonſtrate to others."
See the ſeventeenth ſection of the Analyſt.
It is one thing when a Doctrine is placed
in various lights: and another, when the
principles and notions are ſhifted. When
new devices are introduced and ſubſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
for others, a Doctrine inſtead of being
illuſtrated may be explained away. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
there be not ſomething of this in
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0030601100:44"/>
the preſent caſe I appeal to the writings
of the Great Author. His <hi>methodus ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionum
primarum et ultimarum,</hi> His ſecond
Lemma in the ſecond book of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
his Introduction and Treatiſe of
the Quadrature of Curves. In all which
it appears to me, there is not one uniform
doctrine explained and carried throughout
the whole, but rather ſundry inconſiſtent
accounts of this new Method, which ſtill
grows more dark and confuſed the more
it is handled: I could not help thinking,
the greateſt genius might lie under the
influence of falſe principles; and where
the object and notions were exceeding ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,
he might poſſibly diſtruſt even his
own demonſtrations. "At leaſt thus
much ſeemed plain, that Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> had
ſometime owned himſelf ſatisfied, where
he could not demonſtrate to others. In
proof whereof I mentioned his letter
to Mr. <hi>Collins</hi>; Hereupon you tell me:
there is a great deal of difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
ſaying, I cannot undertake to
prove a thing, and I will not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
it." But in anſwer to this, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire
you will be pleaſed to conſider, that
I was not making a preciſe extract out of
that letter, in which the very words of
Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhould alone be inſerted. But
I made my own remark and inference,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0030601100:45"/>
from what I remembred to have read in
that letter; where, ſpeaking of a certain
Mathematical matter, Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> expreſſeth
himſelf, in the following terms. "It is
plain to me by the fountain I draw it
from; though I will not undertake to
prove it to others." Now whether my
inference may not be fairly drawn from
thoſe words of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>; and
whether the difference as to the ſenſe be
ſo great between <hi>will</hi> and <hi>can</hi> in that
particular caſe, I leave to be determined
by the Reader.</p>
            <p n="38">XXXVIII. IN the next paragraph you
talk big, but prove nothing. You ſpeak of
driving out of intrenchments, of ſallying
and attacking and carrying by aſſault; of
ſlight and untenable works, of a new-raiſed
and undiſciplined militia, and of veteran
regular troops. Need the Reader be a Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematician
to ſee the vanity of this para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph?
After this you employ (<hi>p.</hi> 65) your
uſual colouring, and repreſent the great
Author of the method of Fluxions "as
a Good old Gentleman faſt aſleep, and
ſnoring in his eaſy chair; while dame
Fortune is bringing him her apron full
of beautiful theorems and problems,
which he never knows or thinks of."
This you would have paſs for a conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0030601100:46"/>
of my notions. But I appeal to all
thoſe who are ever ſo little knowing in
ſuch matters, whether there are not divers
fountains of Experiment, Induction, and
Analogy, whence a man may derive and
ſatisfy himſelf concerning the truth of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
points in Mathematics and Mechanical
Philoſophy, although the proofs thereof
afforded by the modern Analyſis ſhould
not amount to demonſtration? I further
appeal to the conſcience of all the moſt
profound Mathematicians, whether they
can, with perfect acquieſcence of mind free
from all ſcruple, apply any propoſition
merely upon the ſtrength of a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
involving ſecond or third Fluxions,
without the aid of any ſuch experiment or
analogy or collateral proof whatſoever?
Laſtly, I appeal to the Reader's own heart,
whether he cannot clearly conceive a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium
between being faſt aſleep and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating?
But you will have it, that I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent
Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Concluſions as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
out right, becauſe one error is compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated
by another contrary and equal error,
which perhaps he never knew himſelf nor
thought of: that by a twofold miſtake he
arrives though not at ſcience yet at Truth:
that he proceeds blindfold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All which
is untruly ſaid by you, who have miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
to Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> what was intended for
the Marquis <hi>de l' Hoſpital</hi> and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0030601100:47"/>
for no other end (as I can ſee) but
that you may have an opportunity to draw
that ingenious portraiture of Sir <hi>Iſaac
Newton</hi> and Dame Fortune, as will be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
to whoever reads the Analyſt.</p>
            <p n="39">XXXIX. YOU tell me (<hi>p.</hi> 70), if I
think fit to perſiſt in aſſerting, "that this
affair of a double error is entirely a new
diſcovery of my own, which Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>
and his followers never knew nor
thought of, that you have unqueſtiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
evidence to convince me of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
and that all his followers are
already appriſed, that this very objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of mine was long ſince foreſeen,
and clearly and fully removed by
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> in the firſt ſection
of the firſt book of his <hi>Principia</hi>".
All which I do as ſtrongly deny as
you affirm. And I do aver, that this is
an unqueſtionable proof of the matchleſs
contempt which you, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> have for
Truth. And I do here publickly call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
you, to produce that evidence which
you pretend to have, and to make good
that fact which you ſo confidently affirm.
And, at the ſame time, I do aſſure the
Reader that you never will, nor can.</p>
            <p n="40">
               <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0030601100:48"/>
XL. IF you defend Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s notions
as delivered in his <hi>Principia,</hi> it muſt be
on the rigorous foot of rejecting nothing,
neither admitting nor caſting away infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
ſmall quantities. If you defend the
Marquis, whom you alſo ſtile your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,
it muſt be on the foot of admitting
that there are infiniteſimals, that may be
rejected, that they are nevertheleſs real
quantities, and themſelves infinitely ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diviſible.
But you ſeem to have grown
giddy with paſſion, and in the heat of
controverſy to have miſtaken and forgot
your part. I beſeech you, Sir, to conſider,
that the Marquis (whom alone, and not
Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi> this double error in finding the
ſubtangent doth concern) rejects indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteſimals,
but not on the foot that you
do, to wit, their being inconſiderable in
practical Geometry or mixed Mathematics.
But he rejects them in the accuracy of Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative
Knowledge: in which reſpect
there may be great Logical errors, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
there ſhould be no ſenſible miſtake
in practice: which, it ſeems, is what you
cannot comprehend. He rejects them like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
in virtue of a Poſtulatum, which I
venture to call rejecting them without ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony.
And though he inferreth a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion
accurately true, yet he doth it,
contrary to the rules of Logic, from inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curate
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0030601100:49"/>
and falſe premiſes, And how this
comes about, I have at large explained in
the Analyſt, and ſhewed in that particular
caſe of Tangents, that the Rejectaneous
Quantity might have been a finite quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
of any given magnitude, and yet the
concluſion have come out exactly the ſame
way; and conſequently, that the truth of
this method doth not depend on the reaſon
aſſigned by the Marquis, to wit, the <hi>poſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latum</hi>
for throwing away Infiniteſimals;
and therefore that he and his followers
acted blindfold, as not knowing the true
reaſon for the concluſion's coming out ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately
right, which I ſhew to have been
the effect of a double error.</p>
            <p n="41">XLI. THIS is the truth of the matter,
which you ſhamefully miſrepreſent and
declaim upon, to no ſort of purpoſe but
to amuſe and miſlead your Reader. For
which conduct of yours throughout your
remarks, you will pardon me if I cannot
otherwiſe account, than from a ſecret
hope that the reader of your defence would
never read the Analyſt. If he doth, He
cannot but ſee what an admirable Method
you take to defend your cauſe: How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of juſtifying the Reaſoning, the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic
or the Theory of the caſe ſpecified,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0030601100:50"/>
which is the real point, you diſcourſe of
ſenſible and practical errors: And how all
this is a manifeſt impoſition upon the
Reader. He muſt needs ſee that I have
expreſly ſaid, "I have no controverſy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
only about your Logic and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod:
that I conſider how you demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate;
what objects you are converſant
about; and whether you conceive them
clearly? That I have often expreſſed
my ſelf to the ſame effect, deſiring the
Reader to remember, that I am only
concerned about the way of coming at
your theorems, whether it be legitimate
or illegitimate, clear or obſcure, ſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic
or tentative: That I have on this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
occaſion, to prevent all poſſibility of
miſtake, repeated and inſiſted that I
conſider the Geometrical Analyſt as a
Logician, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo far forth as he reaſons
and argues; and his mathematical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
not in themſelves but in their
premiſes; not as true or falſe, uſeful or
inſignificant, but as derived from ſuch
principles, and by ſuch inferences"<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Analyſt,</hi> Sect. XX.</note>.
You affirm (and indeed what can you not
affirm?) that the difference between the
true ſubtangent and that found without
any compenſation is abſolutely nothing at
all. I profeſs my ſelf of a contrary opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0030601100:51"/>
My reaſon is becauſe nothing cannot
be divided into parts. But this difference
is capable of being divided into any, or
into more than any given number of parts;
For the truth of which conſult the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit
<hi>de l' Hoſpital.</hi> And, be the error in
fact or in practice ever ſo ſmall, it will
not thence follow that the error in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning,
which is what I am alone con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
about, is one whit the leſs, it being
evident that a man may reaſon moſt abſurd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
about the minuteſt things.</p>
            <p n="42">XLII. PRAY anſwer me fairly, once
for all, whether it be your opinion that
whatſoever is little and inconſiderable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
to be rejected without inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience
in practice, the ſame may in like
manner be ſafely rejected and overlooked
in Theory and Demonſtration. If you ſay
<hi>no,</hi> it will then follow, that all you have
been ſaying here and elſewhere, about
yards and inches and decimal fractions, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
forth and inſiſting on the extreme ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the rejectaneous quantity, is quite
foreign to the argument, and only a piece
of skill to impoſe upon your Reader. If
you ſay <hi>yes,</hi> it follows that you then give
up at once all the orders of Fluxions and
Infiniteſimal Differences; and ſo moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudently
turn all your ſallies and attacks
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0030601100:52"/>
and Veterans to your own overthrow. If
the Reader is of my mind, he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair
of ever ſeeing you get clear of this
Dilemma. The points in controverſy have
been ſo often and ſo diſtinctly noted in the
Analyſt, that I very much wonder how
you could miſtake if you had no mind to
miſtake. It is very plain, if you are in
earneſt, that you neither underſtand me
nor your Maſters. And what ſhall we
think of other ordinary Analyſts, when it
ſhall be found that even you, who, like a
Champion ſtep forth to defend their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
have not conſidered them.</p>
            <p n="43">XLIII. THE impartial Reader is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
to remark throughout your whole
performance, how confident you are in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerting,
and withall how modeſt in proving
or explaining: How frequent it is with
you to employ Figures and Tropes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead
of Reaſons: How many difficulties
propoſed in the Analyſt are diſcreetly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked
by you, and what ſtrange work
you make with the reſt: How groſly you
miſtake and miſrepreſent, and how little
you practiſe the advice which you ſo libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
beſtow. Believe me, Sir, I had long
and maturely conſidered the principles of
the modern Analyſis, before I ventured to
publiſh my thoughts thereupon in the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0030601100:53"/>
Analyſt. And ſince the publication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
I have my ſelf freely converſed with
Mathematicians of all ranks, and ſome of
the ableſt Profeſſors, as well as made it my
buſineſs to be informed of the Opinions of
others, being very deſirous to hear what
could be ſaid towards clearing my diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
or anſwering my objections. But
though you are not afraid or aſhamed to
repreſent the Analyſts as very clear and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
in their Conception of theſe matters,
yet I do ſolemnly affirm (and ſeveral of
themſelves know it to be true) that I found
no harmony or agreement among them,
but the reverſe thereof, the greateſt diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
and even contrariety of Opinions,
employed to explain what after all ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
inexplicable.</p>
            <p n="44">XLIV. SOME fly to proportions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
nothings. Some reject quantities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
infiniteſimal. Others allow only finite
quantities, and reject them becauſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable.
Others place the method of
Fluxions on a foot with that of <hi>Exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions,</hi>
and admit nothing new therein.
Some maintain the clear conception of
Fluxions. Others hold they can demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
about things incomprehenſible. Some
would prove the Algoriſm of Fluxions
by <hi>reductio ad abſurdum</hi>; others <hi>a priori.</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0030601100:54"/>
Some hold the evaneſcent increments to
be real quantities, ſome to be nothings,
ſome to be limits. As many Men, ſo
many minds: Each differing one from
another, and all from Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton.</hi>
Some plead inaccurate expreſſions in the
great Author, whereby they would draw
him to ſpeak their ſenſe, not conſidering
that if he meant as they do, he could not
want words to expreſs his meaning.
Others are magiſterial and poſitive, ſay
they are ſatisfied, and that is all, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
that we, who deny Sir <hi>Iſaac
Newton</hi>'s Authority, ſhall not ſubmit to
that of his Diſciples. Some inſiſt, that
the Concluſions are true, and therefore the
principles, not conſidering what hath been
largely ſaid in the Analyſt<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Sect.</hi> XIX, XX. &amp;c.</note> on that head.
Laſtly ſeveral (and thoſe none of the
meaneſt) frankly owned the objections to
be unanſwerable. All which I mention
by way of Antidote to your falſe Colours:
and that the unprejudiced Inquirer after
Truth may ſee, it is not without founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that I call on the celebrated Mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticians
of the preſent Age to clear up
theſe obſcure Analytics, and concur in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the publick ſome conſiſtent and
intelligible account of the principles of
their great Maſter: which if they do not,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0030601100:55"/>
I believe the World will take it for gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
that they cannot.</p>
            <p n="45">XLV. HAVING gone through your
Defence of the Britiſh Mathematicians, I
find in the next place, that you attack me
on a point of Metaphyſics, with what
ſucceſs the Reader will determine. I had
upon another Occaſion many years ago
wrote againſt Abſtract general Ideas<note n="*" place="bottom">Introduction to a Treatiſe concerning the Principles of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Knowledge, printed in the Year MDCCX.</note>. In
oppoſition to which, you declare your ſelf
to adhere to the vulgar opinion, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Geometry nor any other general Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
can ſubſiſt without general Ideas.
(<hi>P.</hi> 74.) This implies that I hold there are
no general Ideas. But I hold the direct
contrary, that there are indeed general Ideas,
but not formed by abſtraction in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
ſet forth by Mr. <hi>Locke.</hi> To me it
is plain, there is no conſiſtent Idea, the
likeneſs whereof may not really exiſt.
Whatſoever therefore is ſaid to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
which cannot exiſt, the Idea thereof
muſt be inconſiſtent. Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
it doth require Pains and Skill to form
his general Idea of a Triangle. He further
expreſly ſaith, it muſt be neither oblique
nor rectangular, neither equilateral, equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crural,
nor ſcalenum; but all and none
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0030601100:56"/>
of theſe at once. He alſo ſaith, it is an
Idea wherein ſome parts of ſeveral diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
and inconſiſtent Ideas are put toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Eſſay on Humane Underſtanding.</hi> b. iv. c. vii. §. ix.</note>.
All this looks very like a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.
But to put the Matter paſt
diſpute, it muſt be noted, that he affirms
it to be ſomewhat imperfect that cannot ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt;
conſequently the Idea thereof is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
or inconſiſtent.</p>
            <p n="46">XLVI. I DESIRE to know, whether
it is not poſſible for any thing to exiſt,
which doth not include a contradiction:
And if it is, whether we may not infer,
that what cannot poſſibly exiſt, the ſame
doth include a contradiction: I further
deſire to know, whether the reader can
frame a diſtinct idea of any thing that
includes a contradiction? For my part, I
cannot, nor conſequently of the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Triangle; Though you (who it
ſeems know better than my ſelf what I
can do) are pleaſed to aſſure me of the
contrary. Again, I ask whether that,
which it is above the power of man to
form a compleat idea of, may not be
called incomprehenſible? And whether the
Reader can frame a compleat idea of this
imperfect, impoſſible Triangle? And if
not, whether it doth not follow that it
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0030601100:57"/>
is incomprehenſible? It ſhould ſeem, that
a diſtinct aggregate of a few conſiſtent
parts was nothing ſo difficult to conceive,
or impoſſible to exiſt; and that, therefore
your Comment muſt be wide of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
meaning. You give me to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
(<hi>P.</hi> 82.) that this account of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Triangle was a trap which Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>
ſet to catch fools. Who is caught therein
let the Reader judge.</p>
            <p n="47">XLVII. IT is Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s opinion,
that every general name ſtands for a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
abſtract idea, which preſcinds from
the ſpecies or individuals comprehended
under it. Thus, for example, according
to him, the general name <hi>Colour</hi> ſtands
for an idea, which is neither Blue, Red,
Green nor any other particular colour, but
ſomewhat diſtinct and abſtracted from them
all. To me it ſeems, the word <hi>Colour</hi> is
only a more general name applicable to
all and each of the particular colours;
while the other ſpecific names, as Blue,
Red, Green, and the like are each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to a more limited ſignification.
The ſame may be ſaid of the word Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle.
Let the Reader judge whether
this be not the caſe; and whether he can
diſtinctly frame ſuch an idea of colour
as ſhall preſcind from all the ſpecies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0030601100:58"/>
or of a triangle which ſhall anſwer
Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s account, preſcinding and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracting
from all the particular ſorts of
triangles, in the manner aforeſaid.</p>
            <p n="48">XLVIII. I intreat my Reader to think.
For if he doth not, he may be under ſome
influence from your confident and poſitive
way of talking. But any one who thinks
may, if I miſtake not, plainly perceive
that you are deluded, as it often happens,
by miſtaking the terms for ideas. Nothing
is eaſier, than to define in terms or words
that which is incomprehenſible in idea,
foraſmuch as any words can be either ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated
or joined as you pleaſe, but ideas
always cannot. It is as eaſy to ſay a round
ſquare as an oblong ſquare, though the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
be inconceivable. If the Reader will
but take a little care to diſtinguiſh between
the Definition and the Idea, between words
or expreſſions and the conceptions of the
mind, he will judge of the truth of what
I now advance, and clearly perceive how
far you are miſtaken, in attempting to illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate
Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s Doctrine, and where your
miſtake lies. Or, if the Reader is minded to
make ſhort work, he needs only at once to
try whether laying aſide the words he can
frame in his mind the idea of an impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
triangle; upon which trial the iſſue of
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0030601100:59"/>
this diſpute may be fairly put. This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
of abſtract general ideas ſeemed to
me a capital error, productive of number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
difficulties and diſputes, that runs not
only throughout Mr. <hi>Locke</hi>'s book, but
through moſt parts of Learning. Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
my animadverſions thereupon
were not an effect of being inclined to carp
or cavil at a ſingle paſſage, as you would
wrongfully inſinuate, but proceeded from
a love of Truth and a deſire to baniſh, ſo
far as in me lay, falſe principles and wrong
ways of thinking, without reſpect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.
And indeed, though you and other
Party-men are violently attached to your
reſpective Maſters, yet I, who profeſs my
ſelf only attached to Truth, ſee no reaſon
why I may not as freely animadvert on
Mr. <hi>Locke</hi> or Sit <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> as they
would on <hi>Ariſtole</hi> or <hi>Deſcartes.</hi> Certainly
the more extenſive the influence of any
Error, and the greater the authority which
ſupports it, the more it deſerves to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
and detected by ſincere Inquirers
after Knowledge.</p>
            <p n="49">XLIX. IN the cloſe of your perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance,
you let me underſtand, that your

be owned you have ſhewn a ſingular talent

ſeverity of your reprehenſions, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
the weakneſs of your arguments,
which, were they as ſtrong as your reproofs,
could leave no doubt in the mind of the
Reader concerning the matters in diſpute
between us. As it is, I leave him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect
and examine by your light, how clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
he is enabled to conceive a fluxion, or
the fluxion of a fluxion, a part infinitely

which is neither ſomething nor nothing, a

had ſome thoughts of adviſing you how
to conduct your ſelf for the future, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
for the advice you have ſo freely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted

me rather to inform my ſelf than inſtruct
others, I ſhall, for my further information,
take leave to propoſe a few Queries to

            <p n="50">L. I deſire to know, whether thoſe

ought to ſurpriſe either Chriſtians or Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars?
Whether in an age wherein ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
pretenders to ſcience attack the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, we may not be allowed
to make repriſals, in order to ſhew that
the Irreligion of thoſe men is not to be
preſumed an effect of deep and juſt think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?
Whether an attempt to detect falſe
reaſonings, and remedy defects in Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matics,
ought to be ill received by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians?
Whether the introducing
more eaſy methods and more intelligible
principles in any ſcience ſhould be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countenanced?
Whether there may not be
fair objections as well as cavils? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to inquire diligently into the meaning
of terms and the proof of propoſitions,
not excepting againſt any thing without
aſſigning a reaſon, nor affecting to miſtake
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0030601100:62"/>
the ſignification of words, or ſtick at an
expreſſion where the ſenſe was clear, but
conſidering the ſubject in all lights, ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely
endeavouring to find out any ſenſe
or meaning whatſoever, candidly ſetting
forth what ſeems obſcure and what fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious,
and calling upon thoſe, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
the knowledge of ſuch matters, to
explain them; whether, I ſay, ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
can be juſtly called cavilling?
Whether there be an <hi>ipſe dixit</hi> erected?
And if ſo, when, where, by whom, and
upon what Authority? Whether even
where Authority was to take place, one
might not hope the Mathematics, at leaſt,
would be excepted? Whether the chief
end, in making Mathematics ſo conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
a part of Academical Education, be
not to form in the minds of young Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents
habits of juſt and exact Reaſoning?
And whether the ſtudy of abſtruſe and
ſubtile matters can conduce to this end,
unleſs they are well underſtood, examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and ſifted to the bottom? Whether,
therefore, the bringing Geometrical demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations
to the ſevereſt teſt of Reaſon
ſhould be reckoned a diſcouragement to
the ſtudies of any learned Society? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to ſeparate the clear parts of things
from the obſcure, to diſtinguiſh the real
Principles, whereon Truths reſt, and
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0030601100:63"/>
whence they are derived, and to propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
the juſt meaſures of aſſent according
to the various degrees of evidence, be an
uſeleſs or unworthy Undertaking? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the making more of an argument
than it will bear, and placing it in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
rank of evidence, be not the likely
way to diſparage it? Whether it may not
be of ſome uſe, to provoke and ſtir up
the learned profeſſors to explain a part of
Mathematical Learning, which is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
to be moſt profound, difficult, and
obſcure, and at the ſame time ſet forth
by <hi>Philalethes</hi> and many others, as the
greateſt inſtance that has ever been given
of the extent of humane abilities? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
for the ſake of a Great man's diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries,
we muſt adopt his errors? Laſtly,
whether in an age wherein all other prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
are canvaſſed with the utmoſt free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
the principles of Fluxions are to
be alone excepted?</p>

APPENDIX
CONCERNING
Mr. WALTON's
VINDICATION
Of Sir ISAAC NEWTON'S Principles
of FLUXIONS.</head>
            <p n="1">I. <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAD no ſooner conſidered
the performance of <hi>Philale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,</hi>
but Mr. <hi>Walton</hi>'s Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
of Fluxions was put
into my hands. As this <hi>Dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin</hi>
Profeſſor gleans after the <hi>Cantabrigian,</hi>
only endeavouring to tranſlate a few paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
from Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>'s <hi>Principia,</hi>
and enlarge on a hint or two of <hi>Philale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes,</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0030601100:65"/>
he deſerves no particular notice. It
may ſuffice to advertiſe the Reader, that
the foregoing Defence, contains a full and
explicite Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Walton,</hi> as he will
find, if he thinks it worth his pains to
read what this Gentleman hath written,
and compare it therewith: Particularly
with Sect. 18, 20, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36,
43. It is not, I am ſure, worth mine to
repeat the ſame things, or confute the ſame
notions twice over, in mere regard to a
writer who hath copied even the manners
of <hi>Philalethes,</hi> and whom in anſwering the
other I have, if I am not much miſtaken,
ſufficiently anſwered.</p>
            <p n="2">II. MR. <hi>Walton</hi> touches on the ſame
points that the other had touched upon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
him. He purſues a hint which the other
had given<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Philalethes,</hi> p. 32.</note>, about Sir <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s firſt Section
concerning <hi>Rationes primae &amp; ultimae.</hi> He
diſcreetly avoids, like the other, to ſay one
ſyllable of ſecond, third, or fourth Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,
and of divers other points mentioned
in the Analyſt, about all which I obſerve
in him a moſt prudent and profound ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.
And yet he very modeſtly gives his
Reader to underſtand, that he is able to
clear up all difficulties and objections, that
have ever been made (<hi>P.</hi> 5.). Mr. <hi>Walton</hi> in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0030601100:66"/>
the beginning, like <hi>Philalethes,</hi> from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
caſe makes a general in erence,
ſuppoſing that Infidelity to be imputed to
Mathematicians in general, which I ſuppoſe
only in the perſon to whom the Analyſt
was addreſſed, and certain other perſons of
the ſame mind with him: Whether this
extraordinary way of reaſoning be the cauſe
or effect of his paſſion, I know not: But
before I had got to the end of his Vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation,
I ceaſed to be ſurprized at his Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic
and his temper in the beginning. The
double error, which in the Analyſt was
plainly meant to belong to others, he with
<hi>Philalethes</hi> (whoſe very overſights he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opts)
ſuppoſeth to have been aſcribed to
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> (<hi>P.</hi> 38.) And this wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
alſo, as well as the <hi>Cantabrigian,</hi> muſt
needs take upon him to explain the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of my writing againſt Fluxions:
which he gives out, with great aſſurance,
to have been, becauſe Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>
had preſumed to interpoſe in Prophecies
and Revelations, and to decide in religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
affairs (<hi>P.</hi> 4.) which is ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
true, that, on the contrary, I have a
high value for thoſe learned remains of
that Great Man, whoſe original and free
Genius is an eternal reproach to that tribe
of followers, who are always imitating,
but never reſemble him. This ſpecimen
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0030601100:67"/>
of Mr. <hi>Walton</hi>'s truth will be a warning
to the Reader to uſe his own eyes, and
in obſcure points never to truſt the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman's
Candour, who dares to miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
the plaineſt.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I WAS thinking to have ſaid no
more concerning this Author's perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
But leſt he ſhould imagine himſelf
too much neglected, I intreat the Reader
to have the patience to peruſe it; and if
he finds any one point of the doctrine of
Fluxions cleared up, or any one objection
in the Analyſt anſwered, or ſo much
as fairly ſtated, let him then make his
compliments to the Author. But if he
can no more make ſenſe of what this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman
has written than I can, he will
need no anſwer to it. Nothing is eaſier,
than for a man to tranſlate or copy, or
compoſe a plauſible diſcourſe of ſome pages
in technical terms, whereby he ſhall
make a ſhew of ſaying ſomewhat, although
neither the Reader nor himſelf underſtand
one Title of it. Whether this be the
caſe of Mr. <hi>Walton,</hi> and whether he un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
either Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> or me,
or himſelf, (whatever I may think) I ſhall
not take upon me to ſay. But one thing
I know, that many an unmeaning Speech
paſſeth for ſignificant by the mere aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0030601100:68"/>
of the Speaker, till he cometh to
be catechiſed upon it; and then the truth
ſheweth it ſelf. This Vindicator, indeed,
by his diſſembling nine parts in ten of the
difficulties propoſed in the Analyſt, ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
no inclination to be catechiſed by me.
But his Scholars have a right to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.
I, therefore, recommend it to
them, not to be impoſed on by hard
words and magiſterial aſſertions, but care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
to pry into his ſenſe, and ſift his
meaning, and particularly to inſiſt on a
diſtinct anſwer to the following queſtions.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. LET them ask him, whether he
can conceive velocity without motion, or
motion without extenſion, or extenſion
without magnitude? If he anſwers that
he can, let him teach them to do the
ſame. If he cannot, let him be asked,
how he reconciles the idea of a Fluxion
which he gives (<hi>P.</hi> 13.) with common
ſenſe? Again, let him be asked, whether
nothing be not the product of nothing
multiplied by ſomething? And if ſo, when
the difference between the Gnomon and
the ſum of the rectangles<note n="*" place="bottom">See Vindication, p. 17.</note> vaniſheth,
whether the rectangles themſelves do not
alſo vaniſh? <hi>i. e.</hi> when <hi>a b</hi> is nothing,
whether <hi>A b</hi> + <hi>B a</hi> be not alſo nothing?
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0030601100:69"/>
               <hi>i. e.</hi> whether the momentum of <hi>AB</hi> be not
nothing? Let him then be asked, what his
momentums are good for, when they are thus
brought to nothing. Again, I wiſh he
were asked to explain the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a magnitude infinitely ſmall and a
magnitude infinitely diminiſhed. If he ſaith
there is no difference: Then let him be
further asked how he dares to explain the
method of Fluxions by the <hi>Ratio</hi> of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes
infinitely diminiſhed (<hi>P.</hi> 9.) when
Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> hath expreſsly excluded
all conſideration of quantities infinitely
ſmall<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Introduction to his Quadratures.</note>? If this able Vindicator ſhould ſay
that quantities infinitely diminiſhed are
nothing at all, and conſequently that, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to him, the firſt and laſt <hi>Ratio</hi>'s
are proportions between nothings, let him
be deſired to make ſenſe of this, or explain
what he means by <hi>proportion between no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things.</hi>
If he ſhould ſay the ultimate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
are the <hi>Ratio</hi>'s of mere limits, then
let him be asked how the limits of lines
can be proportioned or divided? After all,
who knows but this Gentleman, who hath
already complained of me for an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
way of treating Mathematics and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematicians
(<hi>P.</hi> 5.) may (as well as the
<hi>Cantabrigian</hi>) cry out, <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition,</hi>
when he finds himſelf thus cloſely
purſued and beſet with Interrogatories?
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0030601100:70"/>
That we may not, therefore, ſeem too hard
on an innocent man, who probably meant
nothing, but was betray'd by following
another into difficulties and ſtraits that he
was not aware of, I ſhall propoſe one ſingle
expedient, by which his Diſciples (whom
it moſt concerns) may ſoon ſatisfy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
whether this Vindicator really un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands
what he takes upon him to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate.
It is in ſhort, that they would ask
him to explain the ſecond, third or fourth
Fluxions upon his Principles. Be this the
Touchſtone of his Vindication. If he can
do it, I ſhall own my ſelf much miſtaken:
If he cannot, it will be evident that he was
much miſtaken in himſelf, when he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
to defend Fluxions without ſo much
as knowing what they are. So having put
the merits of the cauſe on this iſſue, I leave
him to be tried by his Scholars.</p>
