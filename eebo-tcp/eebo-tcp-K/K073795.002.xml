            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>As the Author of the following Work does not presume either to support or deny the REALITY of APPARITIONS, he chuses to decline all unneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary suggestions on a subject, wherein every person has a right to enjoy his own opinion undisturbed; and, as it was conceived with a view of instruction, and the whole tendency is moral and just, he hopes, with the generality of readers, to pass uncensured for treating them with SO PECULIAR A STORY.</p>
                  <p>If there should remain any over-scrupulous, or over-witty persons, who are inclined per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emptorily
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0184701002:123"/>
to condemn, or illiberally to deride him, he begs leave to answer them with the sentiments of Mr. ADDISON on such subjects, and those of LUCRETIUS and JOSEPHUS, quoted by him, in the second volume of his Spectator.</p>
                  <q>I think a person, who is thus terrified with the imaginations of GHOSTS and SPECTRES, much more reasonable than one, who, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the reports of all historians, sacred and profane, antient and modern, and to the traditions of all nations, thinks the APPEAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANCE of SPIRITS fabulous and groundless.—Could I not give myself up to this general testimony of mankind, I should to the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of particular persons, who are now liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and whom I cannot distrust in other matters of fact.</q>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0184701002:124"/>
So far Mr. ADDISON's own opinion—he then proceeds—</p>
                  <q>LUCRETIUS himself, though, by the course of his philosophy, he was obliged to maintain that the soul did not exist separate from the body, makes no doubt of the REALITY OF AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PARITIONS, AND THAT MEN HAVE OFTEN AP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PEARED AFTER THEIR DEATH.</q>
                  <p>And further having related, from JOSEPHUS, a circumstance of this kind, which befel GLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHIRA, daughter of ARCHELAUS, he closes his discourse thus: <q>The example deserves to be taken notice of, as it contains a most certain proof of the IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL, and of DIVINE PROVIDENCE.—If any man thinks these facts incredible, let him enjoy his own
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0184701002:125"/>
opinion to himself; but let him not endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to disturb the belief of others, who, by INSTANCES OF THIS NATURE ARE EXCITED TO THE STUDY OF VIRTUE.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the testimony of this excellent modern writer might likewise be added the many striking uses which have been made, and the noble purposes of justice which have been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, through the means of such EXTRAORDI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NARY APPEARANCES, by several of our ancient Poets, and particularly by that honour to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Genius, our own immortal SHAKE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SPEARE.</p>

                     <l>Stands in his path, and intercepts his walk;</l>
                     <l>Makes ev'n the rushing wind alarm his sense,</l>
                     <l>As if some power, more than natural,</l>

                     <l>The herald of his dreadful end, appears,</l>

                     <l>A being which he loaths—in his last pang,</l>
                     <l>Vainly he rolls his struggling eye-balls round,</l>
