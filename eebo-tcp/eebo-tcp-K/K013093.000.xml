            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following account of Factitious Airs, has been drawn up in the hopes of render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pneumatic method of treating diſeaſes more generally underſtood than it hitherto appears to have been. The author has endeavoured to bring together under one point of view, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal facts and diſcoveries relating to the ſubject. In the preſent inſtance he is little more than a mere expoſitor; but on a future occaſion he hopes to add to the ſtock of obſervations furniſhed by others, ſomething of his own.</p>
            <p>That the medicinal application of aëriform fluids ſhould meet with much oppoſition, he is not ſurpriſed. Diſſatisfied with the theory of the hyperoxygenation of the blood in phthiſis pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalis, he will frankly own that he was for a long time inclined to view the new propoſal for curing diſeaſes by modified air, as a viſionary thing; but on reconſidering the ſubject, abſtracted
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0493301800:3"/>from theory (and this is the way in which it ſhould be conſidered) he ſaw analogy on its ſide; and after he had beſtowed further attention upon it, he ſaw it was ſupported by facts. He could therefore no longer reſiſt.</p>
            <p>If, as there is little doubt, ſubſtances are more operative upon the living body, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they are of a finer and more ſubtile na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, certainly medicines in an aërial form ought to have more effect than thoſe which are admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered in a ſolid or liquid ſtate: And, if the vapour of water and other <hi>condenſable fluids,</hi> have been inhaled with advantage in certain af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the lungs, analogy points out that the like advantages, or even greater, ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the inhalation of <hi>incondenſable fluids.</hi> This analogical induction has been confirmed by experiments, the reſults of which are ſtated in the following pages.</p>

            <p>IN order to give a juſt notion of Pneumatic Medicine, it is neceſſary to mention what takes place in the proceſs of breathing in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon air. The cheſt, in which the ſoft and ſpongy organs, called the lungs, are placed, is capable of having its capacity altered by the action of the muſcles which belong to the ribs, by the action of the diaphragm, and by other co-operating cauſes. When, in conſequence of the elevation of the ribs, and deſcent of the diaphragm, its capacity is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, the lungs are at liberty to expand, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come filled with air; i. e. we inſpire. On the other hand, by the depreſſion of the ribs, by the aſcent of the diaphragm, and by the contraction of the muſcles of the belly, the capacity of the cheſt is diminiſhed, the lungs are compreſſed, and the air that was juſt before drawn in, is now forced out again; i. e. we expire. It is this alternate dilata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and compreſſion of the lungs that is termed <hi>reſpiration;</hi> a proceſs which is continually going on in the living body, and which cannot be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended (except in animals of a particular conſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) for much length of time without fatal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0493301800:5"/>
            <p>Why reſpiration is ſo neceſſary to the life of man, and moſt other animals, is a queſtion which for ages has engaged the attention of phyſiologiſts and phyſicians; but it was not till of late years properly explained. It was generally ſuppoſed that the air which we breathe ſerved no other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes than to expand the lungs, and thereby allow a free circulation through them, to cool the blood, and carry off moiſture. But this account of the matter is now found to be not only imperfect, but in ſome degree erroneous. It is true that, without a due dilatation of the lungs, the blood cannot cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate freely and completely through them; but that this is not the principal uſe of breathing is evident from this circumſtance, that foul air, though it is equally capable with good air of filling and expanding the lungs, is nevertheleſs not capable of ſupporting life. It is alſo true, that a great quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of moiſture, ſimilar to the perſpirable matter from the ſkin, is diſcharged from the lungs: but it is not ſo clear that the blood is cooled by the atmoſpheric air that we inſpire: on the contrary, it appears to receive a ſupply of heat from it.</p>
            <p>When it was conſidered that air which has been frequently breathed becomes unfit for further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration, it was natural to conclude, that, during
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0493301800:6"/>its application to the lungs, it muſt have been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of ſome principle neceſſary to life. It has been proved within theſe few years by very deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive experiments that this is the caſe.</p>
            <p>The atmoſphere which we breathe has been found to conſiſt of two kinds of air. That part of it which is conſumed by the act of reſpiration (and by ſome other proceſſes) is called <hi>Dephlogiſticated Air, Vital Air,</hi> or <hi>Oxygene Air.</hi> During its application to the lungs, this air, or ſome part of it, is abſorbed by the blood, to which it imparts a florid colour, and a quantity of heat<note n="*" place="bottom">Not all the oxygene air that diſappears, after an animal has repeatedly reſpired a given quantity of atmoſpheric air, is abſorbed by the blood. Much, and perhaps the greateſt part of it, is uſed in the formation of fixed or carbonic acid air, which is produced in great plenty by the proceſs of breathing. This air ſeems to be formed in the lungs by the union of the coaly matter of the blood with the baſis of the oxygene air. Hence, in reſpiration, not only is ſomething added to the blood, but ſomething alſo (beſides the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirable vapour before-mentioned) is taken from it.</note>. Animals live much longer in a ſmall quantity of this than of any other air. When breathed in a larger proportion than that in which it naturally occurs in the atmoſphere, it raiſes the ſpirits, promotes the circulation, increaſes the heat of the body, and heightens the colour of the blood. If it be breathed alone by healthy animals, in large quantities, and for any length of time, its
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0493301800:7"/>ſtimulant effects are carried to exceſs, and febrile and inflammatory ſymptoms enſue. This air is further diſtinguiſhed from all other kinds of elaſtic fluids, by its property of promoting combuſtion, and increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the vehemence and vividneſs of flame. It may be procured from various ſubſtances; but for me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical uſe, it is beſt obtained by ſubjecting the mineral called manganeſe to a red heat. At the firſt time of uſing it, this air ſhould be mixed with eight or ten times its bulk of atmoſpheric air.</p>
            <p>The other kind of air which enters into the compoſition of the atmoſphere, and which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes by far the greateſt part of it (amounting to nearly three-fourths of the whole<note n="*" place="bottom">According to late experiments, 100 parts of atmoſpheric air conſiſt of <hi>about</hi> 28 oxygene, and 72 azote. I ſay about; for it is never (at leaſt to a certain height from the ſurface of the earth) free from a ſmall quantity of fixed or carbonic acid air; and in the neighbourhood of marſhes, moats, ſinks, &amp;c. in ſhort, wherever animal ſubſtances, or mixtures of animal and vegetable ſubſtances, are putrefying in ſtagnant water, the atmoſphere contains ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable air. But theſe are to be conſidered as accidental admix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.
<p>From all the experiments that have hitherto been made upon the ſubject, the conſtituent parts of the atmoſphere appear to be mixed together in the proportions above-mentioned. But it is to be wiſhed, that theſe experiments were more extenſively repeated in different latitudes, and in different places of the ſame latitude, by ſea and by land, among mountains and in plains, in open ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in countries covered with woods. We know not yet what variations, in this reſpect, may be produced by difference of climate, difference of elevation above the ſea, proximity to, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moteneſs from the ſea, expoſure to particular winds, &amp;c. Amid ſuch a variety of local differences, it is to be ſuſpected (as a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man well verſed in chemiſtry hinted to me) that the aſſigned pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions are not in every place, and at all times, the ſame.</p>
               </note>) is called <hi>Phlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſticated Air,</hi> or <hi>Azote.</hi> If this air is applied to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0493301800:8"/>the animal body with a leſs proportion of oxygene than that which is naturally mixed with it in the atmoſphere, it lowers the ſpirits, weakens the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, and darkens the blood: and if it be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely deprived of oxygene, it becomes unfit for the ſupport of life and flame. This air is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from the other unreſpirable airs, which are afterwards mentioned, by not being abſorbed by water, by not precipitating lime from lime-water, and by not being inflammable. Beſides its uſe as a diluent of the oxygene, it may ſerve ſome other purpoſe with which we are yet unacquainted.</p>
            <p>This air may be eaſily deprived of its natural admixture of oxygene, by burning a candle, or any other combuſtible body, in a quantity of it properly incloſed. If the remaining air be afterwards ſhaken together with a ſufficient quantity of lime-water, the fixed air produced by the burning candle will be ſeparated from it, and pure azote will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; or it may be procured in large quantities, by agitating with lime-water the mixture of fixed
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0493301800:9"/>and azotic air, obtained, according to Mr. Watt's method, by paſſing common air through burning charcoal. The fixed air will be ſeparated and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed by the lime-water, and the azotic air will be left unmixed.</p>
            <p>At the firſt time of uſing it, this air ſhould be mixed with four or five times its quantity of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpheric air. The proportion may afterwards be increaſed according to its effects.</p>
            <p>Now, as neither of theſe airs could for any length of time be ſafely breathed alone, Providence has made the atmoſphere to conſiſt of both, mixed together in ſuch proportions as doubtleſs are moſt fit for the ſupport of animal and vegetable life in general. But although theſe proportions are beſt adapted to the maintenance of animated beings in a healthy ſtate, yet there is reaſon to think, they are not ſo well ſuited to every diſeaſed ſtate of the living frame. Thus, in certain caſes, where the circulation is languid, the heat deficient, and the powers of motion and ſenſation nearly exhauſted, a greater quantity of oxygene, i. e. a greater quantity of vital ſtimulus than the common air affords, ſhould be of uſe: on the other hand, in an oppoſite ſtate of diſeaſe, leſſening the quantity of oxygene by applying a greater proportion of azote, in other
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0493301800:10"/>words, withdrawing a part of the atmoſpheric ſtimulus, ought to give relief.</p>
            <p>On this is founded one part of the pneumatic medicine; and the trials that have already been made of it, have been attended with ſo much ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, that there is every reaſon to expect, that, by means of it, phyſicians may now be enabled to afford great relief, if not to effect a cure, in many diſeaſes which have hitherto reſiſted the uſual modes of treatment.</p>
            <p>Beſides the airs above-mentioned, of which the atmoſphere is compoſed, there are various other kinds of airs, or permanently elaſtic fluids; and as they have active properties different from thoſe which the conſtituent parts of the atmoſphere poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs, it was thought that they, too, might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageouſly applied in certain deviations from health. Experience has proved this reaſoning to be juſt. They have been applied with great ſucceſs in ſeveral diſorders.</p>
            <p>As in certain eſſential properties, ſuch as levity, tenuity, tranſparency, compreſſibility, expanſibility, and <hi>permanent elaſticity,</hi> theſe fluids agree with the common atmoſpherical fluid (though they differ from it very materially in other reſpects, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0493301800:11"/>in the circumſtance of being alone unfit for the ſupport of life) they go under the general name of <hi>Airs</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">They are alſo called <hi>Gaſes.</hi>
               </note>, and though ſome of them are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the operations of nature, yet as they may at any time be obtained by artificial proceſſes, they are called <hi>Factitious Airs.</hi> The names and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of ſuch as are uſed in medicine, are now to be mentioned.</p>
            <p>They may be referred to two heads, the <hi>Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable</hi> and <hi>Uninflammable.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>inflammable air,</hi> called alſo <hi>Hydrogene,</hi> is meant that kind of permanently elaſtic fluid, which, though incapable by itſelf of ſupporting flame, does, when mixed or brought into contact with atmoſpheric or oxygene air, take fire on the approach of an ignited body, or on the application of the electrical ſpark. Alone, though it produces no irritating effects, it is unfit for reſpiration. Its other diſtinguiſhing properties are, that it is not abſorbed by water, and that it is by far the lighteſt of all known fluids.</p>
            <p>There are ſeveral ſpecies or varieties of this kind of air, differing in their ſpecific properties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the different nature of the ſubſtances
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0493301800:12"/>from which they are produced. For our preſent purpoſe, it will be ſufficient to mention three dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſorts, viz. inflammable air from heated iron and water, or <hi>martial hydrogene;</hi> inflammable air from melted zinc and water, or <hi>zincic hydrogene;</hi> and, laſtly, inflammable air from red hot charcoal and water, or <hi>carbonated hydrogene,</hi> called alſo <hi>hydro carbonate.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All theſe ſpecies or varieties of inflammable air, when breathed along with atmoſpheric air, have one common operation upon the human body, though ſome of them produce their effects more ſuddenly, and in a more powerful degree than the reſt. All of them diminiſh the heat and lower the pulſe. Hence they have a cooling and ſedative effect; and in this way are ſerviceable in ſome kinds of conſumption and other inflammatory affections of the lungs.</p>
            <p>The martial and zincic inflammable airs may, eſpecially if they are ſet by a few hours before they are uſed, be adminiſtered pretty freely, viz. in the proportion of one part to five or ſix parts of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſpheric air; but the doſes of inflammable air from charcoal, ſhould be conſiderably ſmaller, viz. it ſhould at firſt be mixed with as much as fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen or twenty times its bulk of common air. For further remarks on the proportions in which theſe
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0493301800:13"/>airs ſhould be diluted before they are applied to the lungs, the medical reader is referred to the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion quoted at the end of this pamphlet.</p>
            <p>Under the head of uninflammable air, it is only neceſſary on the preſent occaſion to take notice of <hi>Fixed</hi> or <hi>Carbonic Acid Air.</hi> Like azotic and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable air, it extinguiſhes flame; but, unlike to them, it is abſorbed by water, to which it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates acid properties, and it precipitates lime from lime water. It is heavier than any of the other elaſtic fluids of which we have been treating. This air is produced in the proceſs of reſpiration, as we have before mentioned. It is thrown out by wort and the juices of vegetables, while they are undergoing fermentation. It is alſo let looſe when vinegar or oil of vitriol is poured upon lime-ſtone, marble, or chalk; but for medicinal uſe, it is beſt procured from chalk by heat alone. Applied to the lungs, fixed or carbonic acid air produces effects ſomewhat ſimilar to thoſe produced by the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable airs: It is cooling; but, when properly diluted, by no means ſo depreſſing or ſedative as they are; and it further differs from them in its property of checking putrefaction, and correcting the foetor of mucous and purulent matter. Hence it has proved ſerviceable in ulcerations and abſceſſes of the lungs<note n="*" place="bottom">Percival's Eſſays, Vol. 1, p. 308, and Withering on Fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glove, p. 205.</note>.

Hence, when the excoriation is of conſiderable extent, violent fever, delirium, &amp;c. ſupervene; and in young ſubjects, convulſions and death: All which might poſſibly, in many caſes, be prevented by a ſpeedy removal of the pain.</note>, and gradually improves the diſcharge; and in one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it has cauſed a remarkably large ulcer of this kind to heal<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſtory of two Caſes of Cancer, &amp;c. by Dr. Ewart. The cure of ulcerated cancer of the mamma, in the inſtance of Suſan Alford, of the Bath Infirmary, would have been very deciſive in favour of fixed air, if arſenic had not been preſcribed at the ſame time. But it may be aſked, whether it is probable that ſuch an active ſubſtance, given in the doſe of the <hi>16th part of a grain, three times a day for nine or ten weeks,</hi> ſhould produce no ſort of effect? If it produced any, it muſt have been a good effect, as the amendment was progreſſive during its uſe. The abatement of pain and irritation, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved ſmell, and improved appearance of the diſcharge, were evidently owing to the topical application; but as there was not ſuch a rapid amendment in another patient, in which arſenic was not given, it may be queſtioned whether this mineral had not ſome ſhare in the cure of the firſt.
<p>Whatever might be the operation of the arſenic in Alford's caſe, the good effects of carbonic acid air applied to cancerous ulcers in Dr. Ewart's way are ſo conſpicuous, that every perſon who has the misfortune to be afflicted with ſores of that nature muſt be eager to have it tried.</p>
                  <p>If Mr. Juſtamond did not ſucceed ſo well with the ſame remedy in ſuch caſes, it was probably owing to ſome imperfection in the mode of applying it. Had the atmoſpheric air been entirely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, and the fixed air conſtantly applied, the event of his trials might have been different. Whoever wiſhes for further informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the internal and external uſe of this ſpecies of elaſtic fluid, ſhould conſult <hi>Dobſon's Commentary on Fixed Air.</hi>
                  </p>
               </note>. When applied to the lungs, this air ſhould be diluted with ten or twelve times its
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0493301800:15"/>bulk of atmoſpherical air; but when applied to external ſores, it ſhould be uſed unmixed.</p>
            <p>If to theſe airs, of which we have juſt given an account, we add the two kinds before deſcribed, which enter into the compoſition of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, we ſhall have ſix ſorts of air for medicinal uſe, viz. oxygene and azote, three ſpecies of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammable air, and fixed or carbonic acid air. Theſe are by no means all the different kinds of airs that may be obtained, nor perhaps all that may be found uſeful in the cure of diſeaſes; but they are as many as have yet been tried with this intention, and therefore as many as it is neceſſary to notice on the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p>From all that has been ſaid, it appears that there is in fact but one kind of air, viz. oxygene, that is capable of ſupporting of life; but, that being of a highly ſtimulant nature, it is largely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted in the atmoſphere with another kind of air
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0493301800:16"/>(azote) of directly oppoſite qualities: That the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural mixture of theſe airs, though beſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated to the healthy ſtate of animal life in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, does not appear to be beſt ſuited to every morbid ſtate of the living body; and, therefore, that by varying their proportions, ſuch mixtures may be obtained as are capable of mitigating or curing many formidable diſeaſes: That, moreover, there are various other kinds of airs, beſides thoſe which enter into the compoſition of the atmoſphere, which poſſeſs peculiar and active virtues, and which, under proper management, may alſo be applied to the ſame purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Thus, then, it appears that the pneumatic me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine comprehends not merely the application of more or leſs oxygene, more or leſs azote; but the application alſo of various other kinds of airs, mixed and diluted in proper proportions.</p>
            <p>How much may be done by applying elaſtic fluids directly to the lungs, it is eaſy to conceive after what has been ſaid on the ſubject of reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Part of the air thus applied, is, in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, taken into the blood, and quickly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to every part of the body<note n="*" place="bottom">In explaining the manner in which factitious airs produce their medicinal effects, we are far from attributing ſo much to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorption as others might do. It appears to us, that the ſubject has been treated by an author of great abilities ſomewhat too chemically. Before we place the origin of diſeaſes in chemical changes of the blood, we ſhould prove that theſe changes are antecedent, and not conſequent to the altered action of the ſolids. But this, in moſt caſes, will be no eaſy matter. In the mean time it is well for pneumatic medicine, that it is not to ſtand or fall according to the validity or invalidity of any hypotheſis, but is to reſt on the baſis of fact and experience.</note>. In other inſtances
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0493301800:17"/>the inhaled air acts upon the ſecreted and effuſed hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, correcting their foetor, conſiſtence, and che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical properties; or, acts immediately upon the ulcerated parts, abating inflammation, irritation, and pain<note n="†" place="bottom">In ulcerations and abſceſſes of the lungs, the abatement pain and inflammation which generally attends or follows the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halation of inflammable and fixed air, is perhaps not entirely ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the peculiar action of theſe airs, but in ſome degree to the excluſion of a quantity of the common atmoſpheric ſtimulus, namely, oxygene air, which proves ſo irritating to ulcers in other parts. White (of York) Beddoes, Darwin.</note>. And, laſtly, in other inſtances the inſpired air produces a powerful effect upon the ſyſtem at large, by its action upon the nerves.</p>
            <p>In which ſoever of theſe ways their effects are produced, certain it is that great benefit has been derived from ſome of them in diſorders of the lungs, and other complaints. In conſumptions, in particular, the inflammable airs have afforded ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing relief; and it is ſaid that in ſome paralytic and nervous affections, good effects have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0493301800:18"/>by means of oxygene air. This air has alſo been employed with great ſucceſs in caſes of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>focation from drowning, or other cauſes.</p>
            <p>We ſhall not attempt to enumerate all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in which pneumatic medicine promiſes to be of uſe. It will be ſufficient to ſtate in a general way, that thoſe are proper caſes for the application of factitious airs, which reſiſt, or do not readily give way to the common modes of treatment: ſuch are conſumption, aſthma, ſcrophula, palſy, &amp;c. It ſhould be underſtood, that the application of mixed airs to the lungs, is not to prevent medicines from being taken into the ſtomach in the ordinary way; and in thoſe caſes in which ſpeedy and effectual relief is procured by the remedies already in uſe, the pneumatic method is of courſe ſuperfluous.</p>
            <p>Under proper management, the application of modified airs to the lungs is perfectly ſafe and eaſy. The mixed airs are breathed out of bags; and no trouble or exertion is required on the part of the patient. That ſome of them poſſeſs very powerful and active properties, is no objection to their uſe; for the ſame may be ſaid of opium, and certain preparations of antimony and mercury, which are daily preſcribed, and which only do miſchief in the hands of unqualified perſons. Theſe airs, like all
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0493301800:19"/>other medicines, may be overdoſed; but prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners, who are acquainted with their effects, will take care that they are not too freely or too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently applied. With ſuch precautions they may be pronounced to be as ſafe as moſt other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of the ſucceſs which has already attended the medicinal application of factitious airs at Briſtol and other places, a propoſal has been made for the eſtabliſhment of a public Pneumatic Inſtitution in London, for which ſubſcriptions are now opened in this and ſeveral other towns. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratuſes for obtaining the different kinds of airs, have been introduced into the Hoſpital and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſary here; and in proceſs of time, when the preparation and uſes of theſe elaſtic fluids come to be generally underſtood, we may expect that theſe apparatuſes will be found in the laboratories of moſt of the apothecaries. Phyſicians will then have opportunities of preſcribing the pneumatic treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all caſes in which they may judge it to be proper.</p>
            <p>The writer of this tract has aimed at nothing more than to give a general view of the ſubject. Medical readers and others, who wiſh for further infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation concerning the effects of elaſtic fluids, and the

            <head>Miſcellaneous Obſervations ON <hi>Some</hi> REMEDIES <hi>uſed in</hi> CONSUMPTIONS.</head>
            <p>CONSUMPTIONS are very rare in the Weſt-Indies; but the Negroes employed in the plantations, are not wholly exempt from them. When they happen to be attacked with ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, it is a practice in ſome of the iſlands to ſend them to the ſugar-houſes, the air and vapour of which are, according to the teſtimony of a
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0493301800:21"/>French author, Raullin, a remedy in ſuch caſes<note n="*" place="bottom">Finke mediciniſche Geographie, <hi>1</hi> band. <hi>464.</hi>
               </note>. In the ſpace of two months the conſumptive ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are (we are told) generally greatly relieved, or quite cured, by this method. Doubtleſs the air of the boiling-houſes is an atmoſphere of a lowered ſtandard, containing much fixed air, beſides ſome oily matter, extricated from the juice of the cane, during the boiling. And the air of the ſtill-houſes muſt be ſtrongly impregnated with carbonic acid, thrown out from the open ciſterns in which the melaſſes, ſcummings, and lees, are ſet to ferment.</p>
            <p>THE relief which ſome conſumptive perſons are ſaid to have received from breathing the air of cow-houſes, is too much connected with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſubject to be paſſed unnoticed. The anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phthiſical effects of this remedy, ſeem to be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as Dr. Beddoes has ſuggeſted, to the ſubtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of oxygene; and I would add, in ſome degree alſo to the fixed air largely produced by the reſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the cattle. Bergius has well remarked, that this remedy is generally tried in ſuch a random manner, as is more likely to do harm than good.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0493301800:22"/>Perſons have gone in the depth of winter, and dwelt for ſeveral weeks ſucceſſively in common cow-houſes, wet, filthy, and full of air-holes, with thin walls and ſlight doors. No wonder, if under ſuch unfavourable circumſtances, they have often become worſe than they were before. He ſoon ſaw that the only way of aſcertaining the effects of this mode of treatment, would be to fit up a room for the purpoſe. This was accordingly done by a gentleman of rank and fortune at Stockholm, whoſe lady was ill of a conſumption. Stalls for four cows were put up in a large hall on the ground floor, and a ſtage was raiſed in the middle, ſo high as to be even with the heads of the cattle. This ſtage was large enough to hold the patient's bed, a table, chairs, &amp;c. The windows and other open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings were properly cloſed; and though the heat of the cattle kept the room tolerably warm, yet a little fire was lighted in the ſtove every morning. The patient went into this apartment in the month of September. She was very far gone in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. For two years paſt ſhe had been gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually loſing ſtrength, had ſpit blood, laboured under difficulty of breathing, hectic fever, night ſweats, cough, and great expectoration, and was exceedingly emaciated. Her breathing was ſo difficult, that ſhe was obliged to be raiſed in her bed; and ſhe was now affected with a conſtant
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0493301800:23"/>diarrhaea and ſwelling of the ankles. She was given up by her phyſicians.</p>
            <p>Her new abode at firſt appeared very ſtrange to her. The noiſe which the cattle made deprived her of reſt; for no ſooner had ſhe fallen aſleep, than ſhe ſuddenly awoke in a fright. By degrees, however, and under the hopes of a recovery, ſhe became reconciled to her new ſituation. In about a month's time, there was ſome appearance of amendment. The diarrhaea was leſs urgent, and her breathing was ſo much eaſier, that ſhe could diſpenſe with ſome of the pillows that had been uſed to ſupport her. Before Chriſtmas ſhe was ſurpriſingly better. The fever was abated. The pulſe was become ſlow and natural, and ſhe coughed and expectorated little in the day time. The ſwelling of the feet had nearly ſubſided, the diarrhaea had almoſt ceaſed, the difficulty of breathing was much leſs, and ſhe had now a pretty good appetite. After Chriſtmas there was an unpleaſant occurrence, viz. an inflammation in her eyes; which, however, was removed by proper remedies. She remained in this apartment during the reſt of the winter and ſpring, till the beginning of June; when the weather becoming warm, ſhe removed into the country, where ſhe paſſed the ſummer, and by the help of milk and Seltzer water, and daily exerciſe on foot, ſhe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0493301800:24"/>gained fleſh, had her catamenia again, but ſtill had ſome little cough, and ſhortneſs of breath when ſhe walked. This amendment continued throughout the ſummer. In the autumn, when the weather became cold, her phyſicians adviſed her to have recourſe to the cows-breath again. She could not now be prevailed upon to remain conſtantly in the hall where the cattle were, as before; but conſented to paſs her nights there, which ſhe continued to do during the ſeverity of the winter. The ſpring following ſhe caught cold, was ſeized with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the lungs, fever, &amp;c. which reduced her conſiderably. However, during the ſummer ſhe in ſome meaſure recovered; but in the autumn the phthiſical ſymptoms again returned. She could not now be prevailed upon to try the air breathed by the cows. She kept to her own room, and died at the end of the winter. She had borne children, and was about thirty years of age. <hi>Bergius über Lungensüchtiger Cur im Viehſtalle. N. Swed. Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>handl. 3r. Band.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The inflammation of the eyes with which this patient was affected is, according to Bergius, a common occurrence to thoſe who continue for any length of time in the atmoſphere of cow-houſes. He aſcribes it to the ammoniacal effluvium con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ariſing from the excrementitious diſcharges
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0493301800:25"/>from the cattle. But if this vapour or effluvium is ſo highly acrid and ſtimulant as to produce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation in the eyes, it is not likely that it ſhould be a proper application to inflamed and ulcerated ſurfaces of the lungs. Yet the irritation that might ariſe from this ſource, ſeems to have been counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted by the lowered ſtate of the atmoſphere of the apartment, in conſequence of the ſubduction of a portion of the common vital ſtimulus (dephlo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſticated air) and of the production of a quantity of fixed air, by the reſpiration of the cattle.</p>
            <p>Although no cure was accompliſhed, yet the relief was ſo conſiderable, that this patient's caſe may be adduced as an inſtance of the anti-phthiſical effects of an atmoſphere of a lowered ſtandard. When ſhe firſt breathed the air altered by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the cattle, ſhe was rapidly ſinking under hectic fever, conſtant expectoration, profuſe ſweats, and colliquative diarrhaea. In a few weeks theſe ſymptoms abated; at the end of three months ſhe was in every reſpect ſurpriſingly better; and in the beginning of ſummer ſhe was ſo much reſtored as to be able to remove into the country, where ſhe walked out in the open air, and quickly recovered ſtrength and fleſh. On the return of winter, had ſhe perſevered in uſing the remedy in the ſame manner as ſhe did before, more laſting benefit might
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0493301800:26"/>have been obtained; but now ſhe would only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to try it during the night. Still, however, ſome advantage was derived, and ſhe got over an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other winter; and if ſhe had not imprudently ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured into the country again before the warm weather ſet in, and could have been prevailed upon to have continued the remedy on the approach of the third winter, the event might have been dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
            <p>The remark we would make upon this caſe is, that if the above-mentioned rude and diſguſting mode of applying modified air in conſumptive caſes is capable of affording ſo much relief, how much more may we not expect from a proper and well-regulated application of the ſame? Certainly the Weſt Indian treatment, and the cow-houſe remedy, are ſtrong recommendations of the pneumatic method.</p>
            <p>It may be proper to add, that in the above-mentioned caſe, little other medicine, beſides the modified air, was made uſe of. What ſhe took conſiſted chiefly of milk and Seltzer-water, and Chervil-whey<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Seandix cerefolium Linn.</hi> Chervil-whey (ſerum lactis cerefo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liatum) is prepared according to Bergius (Mat. Med. tom. 1, p. 218) by ſteeping the freſh herb in common whey made hot, and afterwards expreſſing the liquor from it. This ſeems to be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite remedy in conſumptions with the Swediſh phyſicians; but Britiſh practitioners will not be diſpoſed to have great faith in it. Indeed it is not probable that it contributed much, if at all, to the amendment that took place.</note>.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0493301800:27"/>
            <p>If this experiment had been made in England, where the air of our rooms is ſo partially heated, moſt of the ſalutary alterations which took place might have been attributed to the equal degree of temperature which was conſtantly kept up in the apartment by the warmth of the cattle; but in Sweden, where the houſes are warmed by means of ſtoves, and the external air is well excluded by double windows, this explanation will not hold. In all probability the patient breathed in her own room an atmoſphere of the like equal temperature, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, however, experiencing any kind of benefit. Therefore the good effects which enſued, muſt be aſcribed to ſomething more than to warmth alone.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH it does not ſtrictly belong to pneumatic medicine, the writer of the preceding obſervations cannot let go this opportunity of men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning, that he has found the <hi>Vapour of Aether</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably ſerviceable in phthiſical caſes. It abates the hectic fever, checks the ſweats, removes the dyſpnaea, and greatly improves the ſmell, colour,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0493301800:28"/>and other qualities of the expectorated matter. Like the inflammable airs, it abſtracts heat; but it does not like them induce languor, nauſea, or gid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs. On the contrary, like fixed air, it has a refreſhing effect. Patients who have inhaled it two or three times, find it ſo grateful to their feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, that they are diſpoſed to have recourſe to it too often, and cannot readily be prevailed upon to lay it aſide when it is no longer neceſſary.</p>
            <p>His mode of applying it, is to direct one or two tea-ſpoonfuls of aether to be poured into a tea-ſaucer, which is held up to the mouth, and the vapour ariſing from it is drawn in with the breath. The inhalation is continued till the ſaucer becomes dry. This is repeated two or three times a day, or oftener if neceſſary.</p>
            <p>When he firſt preſcribed this application, he direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſaucer containing the aether to be placed over a tea-cup filled with hot water, in order to promote the evaporation; but he ſoon found this to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, as this highly volatile fluid aſſumes the form of vapour rapidly enough in the common temperature of our dwelling-rooms, even in the winter time. Beſides, when the ſaucer is heated, the aether evaporates ſo faſt, that much of it is waſted; and the laſt part of the vapour ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires

            <p>None but well rectified aether ſhould be uſed for this purpoſe. Leſt it ſhould contain any looſe acid, it is adviſeable to put a little alkaline ſalt into the bottle in which it is kept, and to ſhake them together now and then. Hitherto he has only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed vitriolic aether. Nitrous and muriatic aethers would be highly improper.</p>
            <p>Aether impregnated with muſk, camphor, opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, aſafoetida, and the like, may in ſome caſes be preferable to pure aether. Theſe ingredients, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhould be added only in ſmall quantities; otherwiſe ſickneſs, giddineſs, and other unpleaſant ſymptoms will ariſe.</p>
            <p>Where, as in certain aſthmatic affections, the object is to remove ſpaſmodic conſtriction of the bronchia, and to promote expectoration, the aether may be impregnated with ſquill, by adding to it either tincture of ſquill, or ſquill triturated with a little water of ammonia, as aether alone does not ſeem to diſſolve this drug in any great quantity. The finer particles of the ſquill applied to the lungs in this manner along with the vapour of aether,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0493301800:32"/>gently ſtimulate the ſecreting ſurfaces of the bron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chia, and promote the mucous diſcharge; and if applied in ſufficient quantity produce ſickneſs, which takes off the ſpaſm, and is otherwiſe ſerviceable in ſuch caſes. An emetic given in this manner is very different from an emetic thrown into the ſtomach in the ordinary way; for beſides having the ſame general effect upon the ſyſtem with this laſt, it has at the ſame time a peculiar topical ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>But on this ſubject the author refrains from further remarks at preſent, intending to give a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular account of the uſes of the <hi>Vapour of Aether</hi> on a future occaſion.</p>
            <p>In the mean time this vapour is not to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as equal in power with Factitious Airs. Where-ever they can be had, they ſeem to be entitled to the preference; but where they cannot be procured, or where there are objections to their uſe, this eaſy and ſimple application will in many caſes be found to be no bad ſubſtitute.</p>
