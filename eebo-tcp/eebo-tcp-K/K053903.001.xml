            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>ON the pleaſant banks of the Garonne,
in the province of Gaſcony, ſtood, in the
year 1584, the chateau of Monſieur St.
Aubert. From its windows were ſeen
the paſtoral landſcapes of Guienne and
Gaſcony, ſtretching along the river, gay
with luxuriant woods and vines, and
plantations of olives. To the ſouth, the
view was bounded by the majeſtic Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nées,
whoſe ſummits, veiled in clouds, or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0247300301:4"/>
exhibiting awful forms, ſeen, and loſt
again, as the partial vapours rolled along,
were ſometimes barren, and gleamed
through the blue tinge of air, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
frowned with foreſts of gloomy
pine, that ſwept downward to their
baſe. Theſe tremendous precipices were
contraſted by the ſoft green of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
and woods that hung upon their
ſkirts; among whoſe flocks, and herds,
and ſimple cottages, the eye, after having
ſcaled the cliffs above, delighted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
To the north, and to the eaſt, the
plains of Guienne and Languedoc were
loſt in the miſt of diſtance; on the weſt,
Gaſcony was bounded by the waters of
Biſcay.</p>
            <p>M. St. Aubert loved to wander, with
his wife and daughter, on the margin of
the Garonne, and to liſten to the muſic
that floated on its waves. He had known
life in other forms than thoſe of paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſimplicity, having mingled in the gay
and in the buſy ſcenes of the world; but
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0247300301:5"/>
the flattering portrait of mankind, which
his heart had delineated in early youth,
his experience had too ſorrowfully cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected.
Yet, amidſt the changing viſions
of life, his principles remained unſhaken,
his benevolence unchilled; and he retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from the multitude "more in <hi>pity</hi>
than in anger," to ſcenes of ſimple na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to the pure delights of literature,
and to the exerciſe of domeſtic virtues.</p>
            <p>He was a deſcendant from the younger
branch of an illuſtrious family, and
it was deſigned, that the deficiency of
his patrimonial wealth ſhould be ſupplied
either by a ſplendid alliance in marriage,
or by ſucceſs in the intrigues of public
affairs. But St. Aubert had too nice a
ſenſe of honour to fulfil the latter hope,
and too ſmall a portion of ambition to
ſacrifice what he called happineſs, to the
attainment of wealth. After the death
of his father he married a very amiable
woman, his equal in birth, and not his
ſuperior in fortune. The late Monſieur
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0247300301:6"/>
St. Aubert's liberality, or extravagance,
had ſo much involved his affairs, that his
ſon found it neceſſary to diſpoſe of a part
of the family domain, and, ſome years
after his marriage, he ſold it to Monſieur
Queſnel, the brother of his wife, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to a ſmall eſtate in Gaſcony, where
conjugal felicity, and parental duties, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
his attention with the treaſures of
knowledge and the illuminations of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.</p>
            <p>To this ſpot he had been attached from
his infancy. He had often made excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
to it when a boy, and the impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of delight given to his mind by the
homely kindneſs of the grey-headed pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
to whom it was intruſted, and
whoſe fruit and cream never failed, had
not been obliterated by ſucceeding cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
The green paſtures along
which he had ſo often bounded in the
exultation of health, and youthful free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom—the
woods, under whoſe refreshing
ſhade he had firſt indulged that penſive
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0247300301:7"/>
melancholy, which afterwards made a
ſtrong feature of his character—the wild
walks of the mountains, the river, on
whoſe wavés he had floated, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
plains, which ſeemed boundleſs as
his early hopes—were never after re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
by St. Aubert but with enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm
and regret. At length he diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
himſelf from the world, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
hither, to realize the wiſhes of
many years.</p>
            <p>The building, as it then ſtood, was
merely a ſummer cottage, rendered inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting
to a ſtranger by its neat ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
or the beauty of the ſurrounding
ſcene; and conſiderable additions were
neceſſary to make it a comfortable fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſidence. St. Aubert felt a kind of
affection for every part of the fabric,
which he remembered in his youth, and
would not ſuffer a ſtone of it to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved,
ſo that the new building, adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the ſtyle of the old one, formed
with it only a ſimple and elegant reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0247300301:8"/>
The taſte of Madame St. Aubert
was conſpicuous in its internal finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
where the ſame chaſte ſimplicity
was obſervable in the furniture, and in
the few ornaments of the apartments,
that characteriſed the manners of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants.</p>
            <p>The library occupied the weſt ſide of
the chateau, and was enriched by a col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of the beſt books in the ancient and
modern languages. This room opened
upon a grove, which ſtood on the brow
of a gentle declivity, that fell towards the
river, and the tall trees gave it a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
and pleaſing ſhade; while from
the windows the eye caught, beneath the
ſpreading branches, the gay and luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riant
landſcape ſtretching to the weſt,
and overlooked on the left by the bold
precipices of the Pyrenées. Adjoining
the library was a green-houſe, ſtored with
ſcarce and beautiful plants; for one of
the amuſements of St. Aubert was the
ſtudy of botany, and among the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0247300301:9"/>
mountains, which afforded a lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious
feaſt to the mind of the naturaliſt,
he often paſſed the day in the purſuits
of his favourite ſcience. He was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
accompanied in theſe little excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
by Madame St. Aubert, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
by his daughter; when, with a
ſmall oſier baſket to receive plants, and
another filled with cold refreſhments,
ſuch as the cabin of the ſhepherd did
not afford, they wandered away among
the moſt romantic and magnificent ſcenes,
nor ſuffered the charms of Nature's low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
children to abſtract them from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance
of her ſtupendous works. When
weary of ſauntering among cliffs that
ſeemed ſcarcely acceſſible but to the
ſteps of the enthuſiaſt, and where no
track appeared on the vegetation, but
what the foot of the izard had left; they
would ſeek one of thoſe green receſſes,
which ſo beautiſully adorn the boſom of
theſe mountains, where, under the ſhade
of the lofty larch, or cedar, they enjoyed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0247300301:10"/>
their ſimple repaſt, made ſweeter by the
waters of the cool ſtream, that crept
along the turf, and by the breath of wild
flowers and aromatic plants, that fringed
the rocks, and inlaid the graſs.</p>
            <p>Adjoining the eaſtern ſide of the green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe,
looking towards the plains of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,
was a room, which Emily called
hers, and which contained her books, her
drawings, her muſical inſtruments, with
ſome favourite birds and plants. Here ſhe
uſually exerciſed herſelf in elegant arts,
cultivated only becauſe they were conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
to her taſte, and in which native ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
aſſiſted by the inſtructions of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
and Madame St. Aubert, made her
an early proſicient. The windows of
this room were particularly pleaſant;
they deſcended to the floor, and, opening
upon the little lawn that ſurrounded the
houſe, the eye was led between groves of
almond, palm-trees, flowering-aſh, and
myrtle, to the diſtant landſcape, where
the Garonne wandered.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0247300301:11"/>
The peaſants of this gay climate were
often ſeen on an evening, when the day's
labour was done, dancing in groups on
the margin of the river. Their ſprightly
melodies, <hi>debonnaire</hi> ſteps, the fanciful
figure of their dances, with the taſteful
and capricious manner in which the girls
adjuſted their ſimple dreſs, gave a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
to the ſcene entirely French.</p>
            <p>The front of the chateau, which, having
a ſouthern aſpect, opened upon the gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of the mountains, was occupied on
the ground floor by a ruſtic hall, and two
excellent ſitting rooms. The firſt floor, for
the cottage had no ſecond ſtory, was laid
out in bed-chambers, except one apartment
that opened to a balcony, and which was
generally uſed for a breakfaſt-room.</p>
            <p>In the ſurrounding ground, St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
had made very taſteful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
yet, ſuch was his attachment to
objects he had remembered from his boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
days, that he had in ſome inſtances
ſacrificed taſte to ſentiment. There were
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0247300301:12"/>
two old larches that ſhaded the building,
and interrupted the proſpect; St. Aubert
had ſometimes declared that he believed
he ſhould have been weak enough to have
wept at their fall. In addition to theſe
larches he planted a little grove of beech,
pine, and mountain-aſh. On a lofty terrace,
formed by the ſwelling bank of the river,
roſe a plantation of orange, lemon and
palm-trees, whoſe fruit, in the coolneſs
of evening, breathed delicious fragrance.
With theſe were mingled a few trees of
other ſpecies. Here, under the ample
ſhade of a plane-tree, that ſpread its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtic
canopy towards the river, St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
loved to ſit in the fine evenings of
ſummer, with his wife and children,
watching, beneath its foliage, the ſetting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſun,
the mild ſplendour of its light, fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from the diſtant landſcape, till the
ſhadows of twilight melted its various
features into one tint of ſober gray. Here,
too, he loved to read, and to converſe
with Madame St. Aubert; or to play
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0247300301:13"/>
with his children, reſigning himſelf to
the influence of thoſe ſweet affections,
which are ever attendant on ſimplicity
and nature. He has often ſaid, while
tears of pleaſure trembled in his eyes, that
theſe were moments infinitely more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
than any paſſed amid the brilliant and
tumultuous ſcenes that are courted by the
world. His heart was occupied; it had,
what can be ſo rarely ſaid, no wiſh for a
happineſs beyond what it experienced.
The conſciouſneſs of acting right diffuſed
a ſerenity over his manners, which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
elſe could impart to a man of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
perceptions like his, and which refin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his ſenſe of every ſurrounding bleſſing.</p>
            <p>The deepeſt ſhade of twilight did not
ſend him from his favourite plane-tree.
He loved the ſoothing hour, when the
laſt tints of light die away; when the
ſtars, one by one, tremble through aether,
and are reflected on the dark mirror of
the waters; that hour, which, of all
others, inſpires the mind with penſive ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0247300301:14"/>
and often elevates it to ſublime
contemplation. When the moon ſhed
her ſoft rays among the foliage, he ſtill
lingered, and his paſtoral ſupper of cream
and fruits was often ſpread beneath it.
Then, on the ſtillneſs of night, came the
ſong of the nightingale, breathing ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and awakening melancholy.</p>
            <p>The firſt interruptions to the happineſs
he had known ſince his retirement, were
occaſioned by the death of his two ſons.
He loſt them at that age when infantine
ſimplicity is ſo faſcinating; and though,
in conſideration of Madame St. Aubert's
diſtreſs, he reſtrained the expreſſion of
his own, and endeavoured to bear it, as
he meant, with philoſophy, he had, in
truth, no philoſophy that could render
him calm to ſuch loſſes. One daughter was
now his only ſurviving child; and, while he
watched the unfolding of her infant cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,
with anxious fondneſs, he endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
with unremitting effort, to counteract
thoſe traits in her diſpoſition, which might
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0247300301:15"/>
hereafter lead her from happineſs. She had
diſcovered in her early years uncommon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy
of mind, warm affections, and ready
benevolence; but with theſe was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
a degree of ſuſceptibility too exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
to admit of laſting peace. As ſhe
advanced in youth, this ſenſibility gave a
penſive tone to her ſpirits, and a ſoftneſs
to her manner, which added grace to
beauty, and rendered her a very intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
object to perſons of a congenial diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
But St. Aubert had too much
good ſenſe to prefer a charm to a virtue;
and had penetration enough to ſee, that
this charm was too dangerous to its poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſor
to be allowed the character of a
bleſſing. He endeavoured, therefore, to
ſtrengthen her mind; to enure her to ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits
of ſelf-command; to teach her to
reject the firſt impulſe of her feelings, and
to look, with cool examination, upon the
diſappointments he ſometimes threw in
her way. While he inſtructed her to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0247300301:16"/>
firſt impreſſions, and to acquire that
ſteady dignity of mind, that can alone
counterbalance the paſſions, and bear us,
as far as is compatible with our nature,
above the reach of circumſtances, he
taught himſelf a leſſon of fortitude; for
he was often obliged to witneſs, with
ſeeming indifference, the tears and ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles
which his caution occaſioned her.</p>
            <p>In perſon, Emily reſembled her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
having the ſame elegant ſymmetry
of form, the ſame delicacy of features,
and the ſame blue eyes, full of tender
ſweetneſs. But, lovely as was her perſon,
it was the varied expreſſion of her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
as converſation awakened the
nicer emotions of her mind, that threw
ſuch a captivating grace around her:</p>
            <q>
               <l>Thoſe tend'rer tints, that ſhun the careleſs eye,</l>
               <l>And, in the world's contagious circle, die.</l>
            </q>
            <p>St. Aubert cultivated her underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with the moſt ſcrupulous care. He
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0247300301:17"/>
gave her a general view of the ſciences,
and an exact acquaintance with every
part of elegant literature. He taught
her Latin and Engliſh, chiefly that ſhe
might underſtand the ſublimity of their
beſt poets. She diſcovered in her early
years a taſte for works of genius; and it
was St. Aubert's principle, as well as his
inclination, to promote every innocent
means of happineſs. "A well-inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
mind," he would ſay, "is the beſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity
againſt the contagion of folly and
of vice. The vacant mind is ever on the
watch for relief, and ready to plunge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
error, to eſcape from the languor of
idleneſs. Store it with ideas, teach it the
pleaſure of thinking; and the tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the world without, will be coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracted
by the gratifications derived
from the world within. Thought, and
cultivation, are neceſſary equally to the
happineſs of a country and a city life;
in the firſt they prevent the uneaſy ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of indolence, and afford a ſublime
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0247300301:18"/>
pleaſure in the taſte they create for the
beautiful, and the grand; in the latter,
they make diſſipation leſs an object of
neceſſity, and conſequently of intereſt.</p>
            <p>It was one of Emily's earlieſt pleaſures
to ramble among the ſcenes of nature;
nor was it in the ſoft and glowing land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape
that ſhe moſt delighted; ſhe loved
more the wild wood-walks, that ſkirted
the mountain; and ſtill more the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's
ſtupendous receſſes, where the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
and grandeur of ſolitude impreſſed
a ſacred awe upon her heart, and lifted
her thoughts to the GOD OF HEAVEN
AND EARTH. In ſcenes like theſe ſhe
would often linger alone, wrapt in a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
charm, till the laſt gleam of day
faded from the weſt; till the lonely ſound
of a ſheep-bell, or the diſtant bark of a
watch-dog, were all that broke on the
ſtillneſs of the evening. Then, the gloom
of the woods; the trembling of their
leaves, at intervals, in the breeze; the bat,
flitting on the twilight; the cottage-lights,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0247300301:19"/>
now ſeen, and now loſt—were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
that awakened her mind into ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort,
and led to enthuſiaſm and poetry.</p>
            <p>Her favourite walk was to a little fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe,
belonging to St. Aubert, in a
woody glen, on the margin of a rivulet
that deſcended from the Pyrenées, and,
after foaming among their rocks, wound
its ſilent way beneath the ſhades it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected.
Above the woods, that ſcreened
this glen, roſe the lofty ſummits of the
Pyrenées, which often burſt boldly on
the eye through the glades below. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
the ſhattered face of a rock only was
ſeen, crowned with wild ſhrubs; or a
ſhepherd's cabin ſeated on a cliff, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed
by dark cypreſs, or waving aſh.
Emerging from the deep receſſes of the
woods, the glade opened to the diſtant
landſcape, where the rich paſtures and
vine covered ſlopes of Gaſcony gradually
declined to the plains; and there, on the
winding ſhores of the Garonne, groves,
and hamlets, and villas,—their outlines
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0247300301:20"/>
ſoftened by diſtance, melted from the
eye into one rich harmonious tint.</p>
            <p>This, too, was the favourite retreat of
St. Aubert, to which he frequently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
from the fervour of noon, with his
wife, his daughter, and his books; or
came at the ſweet evening hour to wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
the ſilent duſk, or to liſten for
the muſic of the nightingale. Sometimes,
too, he brought muſic of his own, and
awakened every fairy echo with the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
accents of his oboe; and often have
the tones of Emily's voice drawn ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
from the waves, over which they
trembled.</p>
            <p>It was in one of her excurſions to this
ſpot, that ſhe obſerved the following lines
written with a pencil on a part of the
wainſcot:</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <head>SONNET.</head>
                  <l>Go, pencil! faithful to thy maſter's ſighs!</l>
                  <l>Go—tell the Goddeſs of this fairy ſcene,</l>
                  <l>When next her light ſteps wind theſe wood-walks
green,</l>
                  <l>Whence all his tears, his tender ſorrows, riſe:</l>
                  <l>
                     <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0247300301:21"/>
Ah! paint her form, her ſoul-illumin'd eyes,</l>
                  <l>The ſweet expreſſion of her penſive face,</l>
                  <l>The light'ning ſmile, the animated grace—</l>
                  <l>The portrait well the lover's voice ſupplies;</l>
                  <l>Speaks all his heart muſt feel, his tongue would
ſay:</l>
                  <l>Yet ah! not all his heart muſt ſadly feel!</l>
                  <l>How oft the flow'ret's ſilken leaves conceal</l>
                  <l>The drag that ſteals the vital ſpark away!</l>
                  <l>And who that gazes on that angel-ſmile,</l>
                  <l>Would fear its charm, or think it could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guile!</l>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Theſe lines were not inſcribed to any
perſon; Emily therefore could not apply
them to herſelf, though ſhe was undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly
the nymph of theſe ſhades. Having
glanced round the little circle of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
without being detained by a
ſuſpicion as to whom they could be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed,
ſhe was compelled to reſt in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty;
an uncertainty which would
have been more painful to an idle mind
than it was to hers. She had no leiſure
to ſuffer this circumſtance, trifling at firſt,
to ſwell into importance by frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0247300301:22"/>
The little vanity it had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
(for the incertitude which forbade
her to preſume upon having inſpired the
ſonnet, forbade her alſo to diſbelieve it)
paſſed away, and the incident was diſmiſſed
from her thoughts amid her books, her ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
and the exerciſe of ſocial charities.</p>
            <p>Soon after this period, her anxiety was
awakened by the indiſpoſition of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was attacked with a fever;
which, though not thought to be of a
dangerous kind, gave a ſevere ſhock to
his conſtitution. Madame St. Aubert
and Emily attended him with unremitting
care; but his recovery was very ſlow,
and, as he advanced towards health, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
ſeemed to decline.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſcene he viſited, after he was
well enough to take the air, was his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
fiſhing-houſe. A baſket of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
was ſent thither, with books, and
Emily's lute; for fiſhing-tackle he had
to uſe, for he never could find amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in torturing or deſtroying.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0247300301:23"/>
After employing himſelf, for about an
hour, in botanizing, dinner was ſerved.
It was a repaſt, to which gratitude, for
being again permitted to viſit this ſpot,
gave ſweetneſs; and family happineſs once
more ſmiled beneath theſe ſhades. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
St. Aubert converſed with unuſual
cheerfulneſs; every object delighted his
ſenſes. The refreſhing pleaſure from the
firſt view of nature, after the pain of ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and the confinement of a ſick-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
is above the conceptions, as well as
the deſcriptions, of thoſe in health. The
green woods and paſtures; the flowery
turf; the blue concave of the heavens;
the balmy air; the murmur of the limpid
ſtream; and even the hum of every little
inſect of the ſhade, ſeem to revivify the
ſoul, and make mere exiſtence bliſs.</p>
            <p>Madame St. Aubert, reanimated by
the cheerfulneſs and recovery of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,
was no longer ſenſible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition
which had lately oppreſſed
her; and, as ſhe ſauntered along the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0247300301:24"/>
wood walks of this romantic glen, and
converſed with him, and with her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
ſhe often looked at them alternately
with a degree of tenderneſs, that filled her
eyes with tears. St. Aubert obſerved
this more than once, and gently reproved
her for the emotion; but ſhe could only
ſmile, claſp his hand, and that of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
and weep the more. He felt the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
enthuſiaſm ſtealing upon himſelf in a
degree that became almoſt painful; his
features aſſumed a ſerious air, and he
could not forbear ſecretly ſighing—"Perhaps
I ſhall ſome time look back to
theſe moments, as to the ſummit of my
happineſs, with hopeleſs regret. But let
me not miſuſe them by uſeleſs anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
let me hope I ſhall not live to
mourn the loſs of thoſe who are dearer
to me than life."</p>
            <p>To relieve, or perhaps to indulge, the
penſive temper of his mind, hebade Emily
fetch the lute ſhe knew how to touch with
ſuch ſweet pathos. As ſhe drew near the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0247300301:25"/>
fiſhing-houſe, ſhe was ſurpriſed to hear
the tones of the inſtrument, which were
awakened by the hand of taſte, and ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
a plaintive air, whoſe exquiſite me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lody
engaged all her attention. She liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in profound ſilence, afraid to move
from the ſpot, leſt the ſound of her ſteps
ſhould occaſion her to loſe a note of the
muſic, or ſhould diſturb the muſician.
Every thing without the building was
ſtill, and no perſon appeared. She conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to liſten, till timidity ſucceeded to
ſurpriſe and delight; a timidity, increaſed
by a remembrance of the pencilled lines
ſhe had formerly ſeen, and ſhe heſitated
whether to proceed, or to return.</p>
            <p>While ſhe pauſed, the muſic ceaſed;
and, after a momentary heſitation, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected
courage to advance to the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe,
which ſhe entered with falter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſteps, and found unoccupied! Her lute
lay on the table; every thing ſeemed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed,
and ſhe began to believe it was
another inſtrument ſhe had heard, till ſhe
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0247300301:26"/>
remembered, that, when ſhe followed M.
and Madame St. Aubert from this ſpot,
her lute was left on a window ſeat. She
felt alarmed, yet knew not wherefore;
the melancholy gloom of evening, and
the profound ſtillneſs of the place, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
only by the light trembling of
leaves, heightened her fanciful apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and ſhe was deſirous of quitting
the building, but perceived herſelf grow
faint, and ſat down. As ſhe tried to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
herſelf, the pencilled lines on the
wainſcot met her eye; ſhe ſtarted, as if
ſhe had ſeen a ſtranger; but, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to conquer the tremour of her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
roſe, and went to the window. To
the lines before noticed ſhe now perceived
that others were added, in which her name
appeared.</p>
            <p>Though no longer ſuffered to doubt
that they were addreſſed to herſelf, ſhe
was as ignorant, as before, by whom
they could be written. While ſhe muſed,
ſhe thought ſhe heard the found of a
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0247300301:27"/>
ſtep without the building, and again
alarmed, ſhe caught up her lute, and hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
away. Monſieur and Madame St.
Aubert ſhe found in a little path that
wound along the ſides of the glen.</p>
            <p>Having reached a green ſummit, ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed
by palm-trees, and overlooking
the vallies and plains of Gaſcony, they
ſeated themſelves on the turf; and while
their eyes wandered over the glorious
ſcene, and they inhaled the ſweet breath
of flowers and herbs that enriched the
graſs, Emily played and ſung ſeveral of
their favourite airs, with the delicacy of
expreſſion in which ſhe ſo much excelled.</p>
            <p>Muſic and converſation detained them
in this enchanting ſpot, till the ſun's laſt
light ſtept upon the plains; till the white
ſails that glided beneath the mountains,
where the Garonne wandered, became
dim, and the gloom of evening ſtole over
the landſcape. It was a melancholy but
not unpleaſing gloom. St. Aubert and
his family roſe, and left the place with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0247300301:28"/>
regret; alas! Madame St. Aubert knew
not that ſhe left it for ever.</p>
            <p>When they reached the fiſhing-houſe
ſhe miſſed her bracelet, and recollected
that ſhe had taken it from her arm after
dinner, and had left it on the table when
ſhe went to walk. After a long ſearch,
in which Emily was very active, ſhe was
compelled to reſign herſelf to the loſs of
it. What made this bracelet valuable
to her was a miniature of her daughter
to which it was attached, eſteemed a
ſtriking reſemblance, and which had been
painted only a few months before. When
Emily was convinced that the bracelet
was really gone, ſhe bluſhed, and became
thoughtful. That ſome ſtranger had
been in the fiſhing-houſe, during her ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
her lute, and the additional lines of
a pencil, had already informed her: from
the purport of theſe lines it was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable
to believe, that the poet, the
muſician, and the thief were the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
But though the muſic ſhe had heard
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0247300301:29"/>
the written lines ſhe had ſeen, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appearance
of the picture, formed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination
of circumſtances very remarkable,
ſhe was irreſiſtibly reſtrained from men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning
them; ſecretly determining, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
never again to viſit the fiſhing-houſe
without Monſieur or Madame St. Aubert.</p>
            <p>They returned penſively to the chateau,
Emily muſing on the incident which had
juſt occurred; St. Aubert reflecting, with
placid gratitude, on the bleſſings he poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
and Madame St. Aubert ſomewhat
diſturbed, and perplexed, by the loſs of
her daughter's picture. As they drew
near the houſe, they obſerved an
unuſual buſtle about it; the ſound of
voices was diſtinctly heard, ſervants and
horſes were ſeen paſſing between the trees,
and, at length, the wheels of a carriage
rolled along. Having come within view of
the front of the chateau, a landau, with
ſmoking horſes, appeared on the little
lawn before it. St. Aubert perceived the
liveries of his brother-in-law, and in the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0247300301:30"/>
parlour he found Monſieur and Madame
Queſnel already entered. They had left
Paris ſome days before, and were on the
way to their eſtate, only ten leagues diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
from La Vallée, and which Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
Queſnel had purchaſed ſeveral years
before of St. Aubert. This gentleman
was the only brother of Madame St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert;
but the ties of relationſhip having
never been ſtrengthened by congeniality
of character, the intercourſe between them
had not been frequent. M. Queſnel had
lived altogether in the world; his aim
had been conſequence; ſplendour was
the object of his taſte; and his addreſs and
knowledge of character had carried him
forward to the attainment of almoſt all
that he had courted. By a man of ſuch
a diſpoſition, it is not ſurpriſing that the
virtues of St. Aubert ſhould be overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
or that his pure taſte, ſimplicity, and
moderated wiſhes, were conſidered as
marks of a weak intellect, and of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
views. The marriage of his ſiſter
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0247300301:31"/>
with St. Aubert had been mortifying to
his ambition, for he had deſigned that
the matrimonial connection ſhe form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
ſhould aſſiſt him to attain the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
which he ſo much deſired; and
ſome offers were made her by perſons
whoſe rank and fortune flattered his
warmeſt hope. But his ſiſter, who was
then addreſſed alſo by St. Aubert, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived,
or thought ſhe perceived, that
happineſs and ſplendour were not the
ſame, and ſhe did not heſitate to forego
the laſt for the attainment of the former.
Whether Monſieur Queſnel thought them
the ſame, or not, he would readily have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed
his ſiſter's peace to the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of his own ambition; and, on her
marriage with St. Aubert, expreſſed in
private his contempt of her ſpiritleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,
and of the connection which it per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
Madame St. Aubert, though ſhe
concealed this inſult from her huſband,
felt, perhaps, for the firſt time, reſentment
lighted in her heart; and, though a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0247300301:32"/>
for her own dignity, united with
conſiderations of prudence, reſtrained her
expreſſion of this reſentment, there was
ever after a mild reſerve in her manner
towards M. Queſnel, which he both un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
and felt.</p>
            <p>In his own marriage he did not follow
his ſiſter's example. His lady was an
Italian, and an heireſs by birth; and, by
nature and education, was a vain and fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous
woman.</p>
            <p>They now determined to paſs the
night with St. Aubert; and as the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau
was not large enough to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
their ſervants, the latter were diſmiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to the neighbouring village. When
the firſt compliments were over, and the
arrangements for the night made, M.
Queſnel began the diſplay of his intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
and his connections; while St.
Aubert, who had been long enough in
retirement to find theſe topics recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by their novelty, liſtened, with
a degree of patience and attention, which
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0247300301:33"/>
his gueſt miſtook for the humility of
wonder. The latter, indeed, deſcribed
the few feſtivities which the turbulence
of that period permitted to the court of
Henry the Third, with a minuteneſs, that
ſomewhat recompenſed for his oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
but, when he came to ſpeak of the
character of the Duke de Joyeuſe, of a
ſecret treaty, which he knew to be nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating
with the Porte, and of the light
in which Henry of Navarre was received,
M. St. Aubert recollected enough of
his former experience to be aſſured, that
his gueſt could be only of an inferior
claſs of politicians; and that, from the
importance of the ſubjects upon which he
committed himſelf, he could not be of
the rank to which he pretended to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long.
The opinions delivered by M.
Queſnel, were ſuch as St. Aubert forbore
to reply to, for he knew that his gueſt
had neither humanity to feel, nor diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to perceive, what is juſt.</p>
            <p>Madame Queſnel, meanwhile, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0247300301:34"/>
to Madame St. Aubert her aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
that ſhe could bear to paſs her life
in this remote corner of the world, as ſhe
called it, and deſcribing, from a wiſh, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably,
of exciting envy, the ſplendour of
the balls, banquets, and proceſſions which
had juſt been given by the court, in ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of the nuptials of the Duke de Joyeuſe
with Margaretta of Lorrain, the ſiſter of
the Queen. She deſcribed with equal mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteneſs
the magnificence ſhe had ſeen,
and that from which ſhe had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded;
while Emily's vivid fancy, as
ſhe liſtened with the ardent curioſity of
youth, heightened the ſcenes ſhe heard of;
and Madame St. Aubert, looking on her
family, felt, as a tear ſtole to her eye,
that though ſplendour may grace happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
virtue only can beſtow it.</p>
            <p>"It is now twelve years, St. Aubert," ſaid
M. Queſnel, "ſince I purchaſed your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
eſtate."—"Somewhere thereabout,"
replied St. Aubert, ſuppreſſing a ſigh. "It
is near five years ſince I have been there,"
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0247300301:35"/>
reſumed Queſnel; "for Paris and its neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
is the only place in the world
to live in, and I am ſo immerſed in politics,
and have ſo many affairs of moment on
my hands, that I find it difficult to ſteal
away even for a month or two." St.
Aubert remaining ſilent, M. Queſnel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded:
"I have ſometimes wondered
how you, who have, lived in the capital,
and have been accuſtomed to company,
can exiſt elſewhere;—eſpecially in ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
a country as this, where you can
neither hear nor fee any thing, and can in
ſhort be ſcarcely conſcious of life."</p>
            <p>"I live for my family and myſelf," ſaid:
St. Aubert; "I am now contented to know
only happineſs;—formerly I knew life."</p>
            <p>"I mean to expend thirty or forty
thouſand livres on improvements," ſaid.
M. Queſnel, without ſeeming to notice
the words of St. Aubert; "for I deſign,
next ſummer, to bring here my friends,
the Duke de Durefort and the Marquis
Ramont, to paſs a month or two with
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0247300301:36"/>
me." To St. Aubert's enquiry, as to
theſe intended improvements, he replied,
that he ſhould take down the old eaſt wing
of the chateau, and raiſe upon the ſite a
ſet of ſtables. "Then I ſhall build," ſaid
he, "<hi>a ſalle à manger,</hi> a <hi>ſalon,</hi> a <hi>ſalle au
commune,</hi> and a number of rooms for ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants;
for at preſent there is not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation
for a third part of my own
people."</p>
            <p>"It accommodated our father's houſe-hold,"
ſaid St. Aubert, grieved that the
old manſion was to be thus improved,
"and that was not a ſmall one."</p>
            <p>"Our notions are ſomewhat enlarged
ſince thoſe days," ſaid M. Queſnel;—"what
was then thought a decent ſtyle of
living would not now be endured." Even
the calm St. Aubert bluſhed at theſe
words, but his anger ſoon yielded to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.
"The ground about the chateau
is encumbered with trees; I mean to cut
ſome of them down."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0247300301:37"/>
"Cut down the trees too!" ſaid St.
Aubert.</p>
            <p>"Certainly. Why ſhould I not? they
interrupt my proſpects. There is a
cheſhut which ſpreads its branches be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the whole ſouth ſide of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,
and which is ſo ancient that they
tell me the hollow of its trunk will
hold a dozen men. Your enthuſiaſm will
ſcarcely contend that there can be either
uſe, or beauty, in ſuch a ſapleſs old tree
as this."</p>
            <p>"Good God!" exclaimed St. Aubert,
"you ſurely will not deſtroy that noble
cheſnut, which has flouriſhed for centuries,
the glory of the eſtate! It was in its ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity
when the preſent manſion was
built. How often, in my youth, I have
climbed among its broad branches, and
ſat embowered amidſt a world of leaves,
while the heavy ſhower has pattered above,
and not a rain drop reached me! How
often I have ſat with a book in my hand,
ſometimes reading, and ſometimes look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0247300301:38"/>
out between the branches upon the
wide landſcape, and the ſetting ſun, till twi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
came, and brought the birds home
to their little neſts among the leaves!
How often—but pardon me," added St.
Aubert, recollecting that he was ſpeaking
to a man who could neither comprehend,
nor allow for his feelings, "I am talking of
times and feelings as old-faſhioned as the
taſte that would ſpare that venerable tree."</p>
            <p>"It will certainly come down," ſaid
M. Queſnel; "I believe I ſhall plant
ſome Lombardy poplars among the
clumps of cheſnut, that I ſhall leave of
the avenue; Madame Queſnel is partial to
the poplar, and tells me how much it
adorns a villa of her uncle, not far from
Venice."</p>
            <p>"On the banks of the Brenta, indeed,"
continued St. Aubert, "where its ſpiry
form is intermingled with the pine, and
the cypreſs, and where it plays over light
and elegant porticos and colonnades, it,
unqueſtionably, adorns the ſcene; but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0247300301:39"/>
among the giants of the foreſt, and near
a heavy gothic manſion—"</p>
            <p>"Well, my good ſir," ſaid M. Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,
"I will not diſpute with you. You
muſt return to Paris before our ideas can<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
at all agree. But <hi>à-propos</hi> of Venice; I
have ſome thoughts of going thither, next
ſummer; events may call me to take poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion
of that ſame villa, too, which they
tell me is the moſt charming that can be
imagined. In that caſe I ſhall leave the
improvements<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I mention to another
year, and I may, perhaps, be tempted to
ſtay ſome time, in Italy."</p>
            <p>Emily was ſomewhat ſurpriſed to hear
him talk of being tempted to remain
abroad, after he had mentioned his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
to be ſo neceſſary at Paris, that it
was with difficulty he could ſteal away
for a month or two; but St. Aubert un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
the ſelf-importance of the man
too well to wonder at this trait; and the
poſſibility, that theſe projected improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
might be deferred, gave him
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0247300301:40"/>
a hope, that they might never take
place.</p>
            <p>Before they ſeparated for the night, M.
Queſnel deſired to ſpeak with St. Aubert
alone, and they retired to another room,
where they remained a conſiderable time.
The ſubject of this converſation was not
known; but, whatever it might be, St.
Aubert, when he returned to the ſupper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room,
ſeemed much diſturbed, and a
ſhade of ſorrow ſometimes fell upon his
features, that alarmed Madame St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.
When they were alone ſhe was
tempted to enquire the occaſion of it,
but the delicacy of mind, which had ever
appeared in his conduct, reſtrained her:
ſhe conſidered that, if St. Aubert wiſhed
her to be acquainted with the ſubject of his
concern, he would not wait for her enquiries.</p>
            <p>On the following day, before M. Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
departed, he had a ſecond conference
with, St. Aubert.</p>
            <p>The gueſts, after dining at ſhe chateau,
ſet out in the cool of the day for Epourville,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0247300301:41"/>
whither they gave him and Madame St.
Aubert a preſſing invitation, prompted
rather by the vanity of diſplaying their
ſplendour, than by a wiſh to make their
friends happy.</p>
            <p>Emily returned, with delight, to the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
which their preſence had reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to her books, her walks, and the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
converſation of M. and Madame St.
Aubert, who ſeemed to rejoice, no leſs,
that they were delivered from the ſhackles,
which arrogance and frivolity had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed.</p>
            <p>Madame St. Aubert excuſed herſelf
from ſharing their uſual evening walk,
complaining that ſhe was not quite
well, and St. Aubert and Emily went
out together.</p>
            <p>They choſe a walk towards the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
intending to viſit ſome old penſioners
of St. Aubert, which, from his very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
income, he contrived to ſupport,
though it is probable M. Queſnel, with
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0247300301:42"/>
his very large one, could not have afforded
this.</p>
            <p>After diſtributing to his penſioners
their weekly ſtipends, liſtening patiently
to the complaints of ſome, redreſſing the
grievances of others, and ſoftening the
diſcontents of all, by the look of ſympathy,
and the ſmile of benevolence, St. Aubert
returned home through the woods,</p>
            <q>
               <l>—where</l>
               <l>At fall of eve the fairy-people throng,</l>
               <l>In various games and revelry to paſs</l>
               <l>The ſummer night, as village ſtories tell,<note n="*" place="bottom">THOMPSON.</note>
               </l>
            </q>
            <p>"The evening gloom of woods was
always delightful to me," ſaid St. Aubert,
whoſe mind now experienced the ſweet
calm, which reſults from the conſciouſneſs
of having done a beneficent action, and
which diſpoſes it to receive pleaſure from
every ſurrounding object. "I remember
that in my youth this gloom uſed to call
forth to my fancy a thouſand fairy viſions,
and romantic images; and, I own, I am not
yet wholly inſenſible of that high enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0247300301:43"/>
which wakes the poet's dream. I can
linger, with ſolemn ſteps, under the deep
ſhades, ſend forward a transforming eye
into the diſtant obſcurity, and liſten with
thrilling delight to the myſtic murmuring
of the woods."</p>
            <p>"O my dear father," ſaid Emily, while
a ſudden tear ſtarted to her eye, "how
exactly you deſcribe what I have felt ſo
often, and which I thought nobody had
ever felt but myſelf! But hark! here
comes the ſweeping ſound over the wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops;—now
it dies away;—how ſolemn
the ſtillneſs that ſucceeds! Now the
breeze ſwells again. It is like the
voice of ſome ſupernatural being—the
voice of the ſpirit of the woods, that
watches over them by night. Ah! what
light is yonder? But it is gone. And
now it gleams again, near the root of that
large cheſnut: look, ſir!"</p>
            <p>"Are you ſuch an admirer of nature,"
ſaid St. Aubert, "and ſo little acquainted
with her appearances as not to know that
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0247300301:44"/>
for the glow-worm? But come," added
he gaily, "ſtep a little further, and we
ſhall ſee fairies, perhaps; they are often
companions. The glow-worm lends his
light, and they in return charm him with
muſic, and the dance. Do you ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
tripping yonder?"</p>
            <p>Emily laughed. "Well, my dear ſir,"
ſaid ſhe, "ſince you allow of this alliance,
I may venture to own I have anticipated
you; and almoſt dare venture to repeat
ſome verſes I made one evening in theſe
very woods."</p>
            <p>"Nay," replied St. Aubert, "diſmiſs
the <hi>almoſt,</hi> and venture quite; let us hear
what vagaries fancy has been playing in
your mind. If fhe has given you one of
her ſpells, you need not envy thoſe of the
fairies."</p>
            <p>"If it is ſtrong enough to enchant
your judgment, ſir," ſaid Emily, "while
I diſcloſe her images, I need <hi>not</hi> envy
them. The lines go in a ſort of trip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
meaſure, which I thought might ſuit
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0247300301:45"/>

            <p>St. Aubert continued ſilent till he
reached the chateau, where his wife had
retired to her chamber. The languor and
dejection, that had lately oppreſſed her,
and which the exertion called forth by the
arrival of her gueſts had ſuſpended, now
returned with increaſed effect. On the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
day, ſymptoms of fever appeared,
and St. Aubert, having ſent for medical
advice, learned, that her diſorder was a
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0247300301:49"/>
fever of the ſame nature as that, from
which he had lately recovered. She had,
indeed, taken the infection, during her
attendance upon him, and, her conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
being too weak to throw out the
diſeaſe immediately, it had lurked in her
veins, and occaſioned the heavy languor
of which ſhe had complained. St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,
whoſe anxiety for his wife overcame
every other conſideration, detained the
phyſician in his houſe. He remembered
the feelings and the reflections that had
called a momentary gloom upon his mind,
on the day when he had laſt viſited the
fiſhing-houſe, in company with Madame
St. Aubert, and he now admitted a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiment,
that this illneſs would be a
fatal one. But he effectually concealed
this from her, and from his daughter,
whom he endeavoured to re-animate wit
hopes that her conſtant aſſiduities woul
not be unavailing. The phyſician, whe<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
aſked by St. Aubert for his opinion <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>
the diſorder, replied, that the event of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0247300301:50"/>
depended upon circumſtances which he
could not aſcertain. Madame St. Aubert
ſeemed to have formed a more decided
one; but her eyes only gave hints of
this. She frequently fixed them upon
her anxious friends with an expreſſion
of pity, and of tenderneſs, as if ſhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipated
the ſorrow that awaited them,
and that ſeemed to ſay, it was for their
ſakes only, for their ſufferings, that ſhe
regretted life. On the ſeventh day, the
diſorder was at its criſis. The phyſician
aſſumed a graver manner, which ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
and took occaſion, when her
family had once quitted the chamber, to
tell him, that ſhe perceived her death was
approaching. "Do not attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
me," ſaid ſhe, "I feel that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
long ſurvive. I am prepared for
the event, I have long, I hope, been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring
for it. Since I have not long
to live, do not ſuffer a miſtaken com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
to induce you to flatter my
family with falſe hopes, If you do, their
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0247300301:51"/>
affliction will only be the heavier when it
arrives: I will endeavour to teach them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation
by my example."</p>
            <p>The phyſician was affected; he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed
to obey her, and told St. Aubert, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
abruptly, that there was nothing to
expect. The latter was not philoſopher
enough to reſtrain his feelings when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
this information; but a conſideration
of the increaſed affliction which the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
of his grief would occaſion his wife,
enabled him, after ſome time, to command
himſelf in her preſence. Emily was at firſt
overwhelmed with the intelligence; then,
deluded by the ſtrength of her wiſhes, a
hope ſprung up in her mind that her mother
would yet recover, and to this ſhe perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly
adhered almoſt to the laſt hour.</p>
            <p>The progreſs of this diſorder was marked,
on the ſide of Madame St. Aubert, by
patient ſuffering, and ſubjected wiſhes. The
compoſure, with which ſhe awaited her
death, could be derived only from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſpect
of a life governed, as far as human
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0247300301:52"/>
frailty permits, by a conſciouſneſs of being
always in the preſence of the Deity, and by
the hope of an higher world. But her piety
could not entirely ſubdue the grief of part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from thoſe whom ſhe ſo dearly loved.
During theſe her laſt hours, ſhe converſed
much with St. Aubert and Emily, on the
proſpect of futurity, and on other religious
topics. The reſignation ſhe expreſſed, with
the firm hope of meeting in a future world
the friends ſhe left in this, and the effort
which ſometimes appeared to conceal her ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
at this temporary ſeparation, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
affected St. Aubert ſo much as to oblige
him to leave the room. Having indulged
his tears awhile, he would dry them and
return to the chamber with a countenance
compoſed by an endeavour which did but
increaſe his grief.</p>
            <p>Never had Emily felt the importance of
the leſſons, which had taught her to reſtrain
her ſenſibility, ſo much as in theſe moments,
and never had ſhe practiſed them with a
triumph ſo complete. But when the laſt
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0247300301:53"/>
was over, ſhe ſunk at once under the preſſure
of her ſorrow, and then perceived that it was
hope, as well as fortitude, which had hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
ſupported her. St. Aubert was for a time
too devoid of comfort himſelf to beſtow any
on his daughter.</p>

            <p>MADAME St. Aubert was interred in
the neighbouring village church; her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band
and daughter attended her to the
grave, followed by a long train of the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantry,
who were ſincere mourners of this
excellent woman.</p>
            <p>On his return from the funeral, St. Aubert
ſhut himſelf in his chamber. When he
came forth, it was with a ſerene countenance,
though pale in ſorrow. He gave orders that
his family ſhould attend him. Emily only
was abſent; who, overcome with the ſcene
ſhe had juſt witneſſed, had retired to her
cloſet to weep alone. St. Aubert followed her
thither: he took her hand in ſilence, while ſhe
continued to weep; and it was ſome moments
before he could ſo far command his voice as
to ſpeak. It trembled while he ſaid, "My
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0247300301:55"/>
Emily, I am going to prayers with my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily;
you will join us. We muſt aſk ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
from above. Where elſe ought we to
ſeek it—where elſe can we find it?"</p>
            <p>Emily checked her tears, and followed
her father to the parlour, where, the ſervants
being aſſembled, St. Aubert read, in a low
and ſolemn voice, the evening ſervice, and
added a prayer for the ſoul of the departed.
During this, his voice often faltered, his
tears fell upon the book, and at length he
pauſed. But the ſublime emotions of pure
devotion gradually elevated his views above
this world, and finally brought comfort to
his heart.</p>
            <p>When the ſervice was ended, and the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants
were withdrawn, he tenderly kiſſed
Emily, and ſaid, "I have endeavoured to
teach you, from your earlieſt youth, the duty
of ſelf-command; I have pointed out to you
the great importance of it through life,
not only as it preſerves us in the various
and dangerous temptations that call us from
rectitude and virtue, but as it limits the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0247300301:56"/>
indulgences which are termed virtuous, yet
which, extended beyond a certain boundary,
are vicious, for their conſequence is evil.
All exceſs is vicious; even that ſorrow, which
is amiable in its origin, becomes a ſelfiſh and
unjuſt, paſſion, if indulged at the expence of
our duties—by our duties I mean what we
owe to ourſelves, as well as to others. The
indulgence of exceſſive grief enervates the
mind, and almoſt incapacitates it for again
partaking of thoſe various innocent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
which a benevolent God deſigned to
be the ſun-ſhine of our lives. My dear
Emily, recollect and practiſe the precepts I
have ſo often given you, and which your
own experience has ſo often ſhewn you to
be wiſe.</p>
            <p>"Your ſorrow is uſeleſs. Do not receive
this as merely a common-place remark, but
let reaſon <hi>therefore</hi> reſtrain ſorrow. I would
not annihilate your feelings, my child, I
would only teach you to command them;
for whatever may be the evils reſulting from
a too ſuſceptible heart, nothing can be hoped
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0247300301:57"/>
from an inſenſible one; that, on the other
hand, is all vice—vice, of which the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity
is not ſoftened, or the effect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoled
for, by any ſemblance or poſſibility
of good. You know my ſufferings, and
are, therefore, convinced that mine are not
the light words which, on theſe occaſions,
are ſo often repeated to deſtroy even the
ſources of honeſt emotion, or which merely
diſplay the ſelfiſh oſtentation of a falſe phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.
I will ſhew my Emily, that I can
practiſe what I adviſe. I have ſaid thus
much, becauſe I cannot bear to ſee you waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in uſeleſs ſorrow, for want of that reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
which is due from mind; and I have
not ſaid, it till now, becauſe there is a period
when all reaſoning muſt yield to nature;
that is paſt: and another, when exceſſive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence,
having ſunk into habit, weighs
down the elaſticity of the ſpirits ſo as to
render conqueſt nearly impoſſible; this is
to come. You, my Emily, will ſhew that
you are willing to avoid it."</p>
            <p>Emily ſmiled through her tears upon her
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0247300301:58"/>
father: "Dear Sir," ſaid ſhe, and her voice
trembled; ſhe would have added, "I will
ſhew myſelf worthy of being your daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;"
but a mingled emotion of gratitude,
affection, and grief overcame her. St.
Aubert ſuffered her to weep without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption,
and then began to talk on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
topics.</p>
            <p>The firſt perſon who came to condole
with St. Aubert was an M. Barreaux, an
auſtere and ſeemingly unfeeling man. A
taſte for botany had introduced them to each
other, for they had frequently met in their
wanderings among the mountains. M. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaux
had retired from the world, and almoſt
from ſociety, to live in a pleaſant chateau,
on the ſkirts of the woods, near La Vallée.
He alſo had been diſappointed in his opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of mankind; but he did not, like St.
Aubert, pity and mourn for them; he felt
more indignation at their vices, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
for their weakneſſes.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert was ſomewhat ſurpriſed to ſee
him; for, though he had often preſſed him
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0247300301:59"/>
to come to the chateau, he had never till
now accepted the invitation; and now he
came without ceremony or reſerve, entering
the parlour as an old friend. The claims
of misfortune appeared to have ſoftened
down all the ruggedneſs and prejudices of
his heart. St. Aubert unhappy, ſeemed to
be the ſole idea that occupied his mind. It
was in manners, more than in words, that he
appeared to ſympathize with his friends: he
ſpoke little on the ſubject of their grief; but
the minute attention he gave them, and the
modulated voice, and ſoftened look that
accompanied it, came from his heart, and
ſpoke to theirs.</p>
            <p>At this melancholy period, St. Aubert
was likewiſe viſited by Madame Cheron, his
only ſurviving ſiſter, who had been ſome
years a widow, and now reſided on her own
eſtate near Tholouſe. The intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them had not been very frequent. In
her condolements, words were not wanting;
ſhe underſtood not the magic of the look
that ſpeaks at once to the ſoul, or the voice
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0247300301:60"/>
that ſinks like balm to the heart: but ſhe
aſſured St. Aubert that ſhe ſincerely ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathized
with him, praiſed the virtues of
his late wife, and then offered what ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
to be conſolation. Emily wept un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſingly
while ſhe ſpoke; St. Aubert was
tranquil, liſtened to what ſhe ſaid in ſilence,
and then turned the diſcourſe upon another
ſubject.</p>
            <p>At parting ſhe preſſed him and her niece
to make her an early viſit. "Change of
place will amuſe you," ſaid ſhe, "and it is
wrong to give way to grief." St. Aubert
acknowledged the truth of theſe words of
courſe; but, at the ſame time, felt more
reluctant than ever to quit the ſpot which
his paſt happineſs had conſecrated. The
preſence of his wife had ſanctified every ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
ſcene, and, each day, as it gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually
ſoftened the acuteneſs of his ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
aſſiſted the tender enchantment that
bound him to home.</p>
            <p>But there were calls which muſt be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
with, and of this kind was the viſit he
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0247300301:61"/>
paid to his brother-in-law M. Queſnel. An
affair of an intereſting nature made it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
that he ſhould delay this viſit no longer,
and, wiſhing to rouſe Emily from her dejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he took her with him to Epourville.</p>
            <p>As the carriage entered upon the foreſt
that adjoined his paternal domain, his eyes
once more caught, between the cheſnut
avenue, the turreted corners of the chateau.
He ſighed to think of what had paſſed
ſince he was laſt there, and that it was now
the property of a man who neither revered
nor valued it. At length he entered the
avenue, whoſe lofty trees had ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
him when a boy, and whoſe melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
ſhade was now ſo congenial with the
tone of his ſpirits. Every feature of the edifice,
diſtinguiſhed by an air of heavy grandeur,
appeared ſucceſſively between the branches
of the trees—the broad turret, the arched
gate-way that led into the courts, the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,
and the dry foſſe which ſurrounded
the whole.</p>
            <p>The found of carriage wheels brought a
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0247300301:62"/>
troop of ſervants to the great gate, where St.
Aubert alighted, and from which he led
Emily into the gothic halsl, now no longer
hung with the arms and ancient banners of
the family. Theſe were diſplaced, and the
oak wainſcotting, and beams that croſſed the
roof, were painted white. The large table,
too, that uſed to ſtretch along the upper
end of the hall, where the maſter of the
manſion loved to diſplay his hoſpitality, and
whence the peal of laughter, and the ſong of
conviviality, had ſo often reſounded, was
now removed; even the benches that had
ſurrounded the hall were no longer there.
The heavy walls were hung with frivolous
ornaments, and every thing that appeared
denoted the falſe taſte and corrupted ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of the preſent owner.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert followed a gay Pariſian ſervant
to a parlour, where sat Monſ. and Madame
Queſnel, who received him with a ſtately
politeneſs, and, after a few formal words of
condolement, ſeemed to have forgotten that
they ever had a ſiſter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0247300301:63"/>
Emily felt tears ſwell into her eyes, and
then reſentment checked them. St. Aubert,
calm and deliberate, preſerved his dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
without aſſuming importance, and
Queſnel was depreſſed by his preſence
without exactly knowing wherefore.</p>
            <p>After ſome general conversation, St. Aubert
requeſted to ſpeak with him alone; and
Emily, being left with Madame Queſnel,
ſoon learned that a large party was invited
to dine at the chateau, and was compelled
to hear that nothing which was paſt and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remediable
ought to prevent the feſtivity of
the preſent hour.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert, when he was told that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
were expected, felt a mixed emotion
of diſguſt and indignation againſt the inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility
of Queſnel, which prompted him to
return home immediately. But he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed,
that Madame Cheron had been aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to meet him; and, when he looked at
Emily, and conſidered that a time might
come when the enmity of her uncle would
be prejudicial to her, he determined not to
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0247300301:64"/>
incur it himſelf, by conduct which would be
reſented as indecorous, by the very perſons
who now ſhewed ſo little ſenſe of decorum.</p>
            <p>Among the viſitors aſſembled at dinner
were two Italian gentlemen, of whom one
was named Montoni, a diſtant relation of
Madame Queſnel, a man about forty, of an
uncommonly handſome perſon, with fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
manly and expreſſive, but whoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
exhibited, upon the whole, more of
the haughtineſs of command, and the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of discernment, than of any other cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>Signor Cavigni, his friend, appeared to
be about thirty—his inferior indignity, but
equal to him in penetration of countenance,
and ſuperior in inſinuation of manner.</p>
            <p>Emily was ſhocked by the ſalutation with
which Madame Cheron met her father—"Dear
brother," ſaid ſhe, "I am concerned
to ſee you look ſo very ill; do, pray, have
advice!" St. Aubert anſwered, with a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
ſmile, that he felt himſelf much as
uſual; but Emily's fears made her now fancy
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0247300301:65"/>
that her father looked worſe than he really
did.</p>
            <p>Emily would have been amuſed by the
new characters ſhe ſaw, and the varied
converſation that paſſed during dinner,
which was ſerved in a ſtyle of ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
ſhe had ſeldom ſeen before, had her
ſpirits been leſs oppreſſed. Of the gueſts,
Signor Montoni was lately come from
Italy, and he ſpoke of the commotions
which at that period agitated the country;
talked of party differences with warmth, and
then lamented the probable conſequences
of the tumults. His friend ſpoke with
equal ardour, of the politics of his country;
praiſed the government and proſperity of
Venice, and boaſted of its decided ſuperio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
over all the other Italian ſtates. He
then turned to the ladies, and talked with
the ſame eloquence, of Pariſian faſhions, the
French opera, and French manners; and on
the latter ſubject he did not fail to mingle
what is ſo particularly agreeable to French
taſte. The flattery was not detected by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0247300301:66"/>
thoſe to whom it was addreſſed, though its
effect, in producing ſubmiſſive attention, did
not eſcape his obſervation. When he could
diſengage himſelf from the aſſiduities of the
other ladies, he ſometimes addreſſed Emily:
but ſhe knew nothing of Pariſian faſhions,
or Pariſian operas; and her modeſty, ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city,
and correct manners formed a decided
contraſt to thoſe of her female companions.</p>
            <p>After dinner, St. Aubert ſtole from the
room to view once more the old cheſnut
which Queſnel talked of cutting down. As
he ſtood under its ſhade, and looked up
among its branches, ſtill luxuriant, and ſaw
here and there the blue ſky trembling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
them; the purſuits and events of his
early days crowded faſt to his mind, with
the figures and characters of friends—long
ſince gone from the earth; and he now felt
himſelf to be almoſt an inſulated being,
with nobody but his Emily for his heart to
turn to.</p>
            <p>He ſtood loſt amid the ſcenes of years
which fancy called up, till the ſucceſſion
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0247300301:67"/>
cloſed with the picture of his dying wife,
and he ſtarted away, to forget it, if poſſible,
at the ſocial board.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert ordered his carriage at an early
hour, and Emily obſerved, that he was more
than unuſually ſilent and dejected on the way
home; but ſhe conſidered this to be the
effect of his viſit to a place which ſpoke ſo
eloquently of former times, nor ſuſpected
that he had a cauſe of grief which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
from her.</p>
            <p>On entering the chateau ſhe felt more
depreſſed than ever, for ſhe more than ever
miſſed the preſence of that dear parent, who,
whenever ſhe had been from home, uſed to
welcome her return with ſmiles and fond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
now, all was ſilent and forſaken.</p>
            <p>But what reaſon and effort may fail to
do, time effects. Week after week paſſed
away, and each, as it paſſed, ſtole ſomething
from the harſhneſs of her affliction, till it was
mellowed to that tenderneſs which the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
heart cheriſhes as ſacred. St. Aubert,
on the contrary, viſibly declined in health;
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0247300301:68"/>
though Emily, who had been ſo constantly
with him, was almoſt the laſt perſon who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
it. His conſtitution had never reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
from the late attack of the fever, and
the ſucceeding ſhock it had received from
Madame St. Aubert's death had produced
its preſent infirmity. His phyſician now
ordered him to travel; for it was percepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that ſorrow had ſeized upon his nerves,
weakened as they had been by the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
illneſs; and variety of ſcene, it was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,
would, by amuſing his mind, reſtore
them to their proper tone.</p>
            <p>For ſome days Emily was occupied in
preparations to attend him; and he, by
endeavours to diminiſh his expences at
home during the journey—a purpoſe which
determined him at length to diſmiſs his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics.
Emily ſeldom oppoſed her father's
wiſhes by queſtions or remonſtrances, or
ſhe would now have aſked why he did not
take a ſervant, and have repreſented that his
infirm health made one almoſt neceſſary.
But when, on the eve of their departure, ſhe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0247300301:69"/>
found that he had diſmiſſed Jacques, Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis,
and Mary, and detained only Thereſa
the old houſekeeper, ſhe was extremely ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed,
and ventured to aſk his reaſon for
having done ſo. "To ſave expences, my
dear," he replied—"we are going on an
expenſive excurſion."</p>
            <p>The phyſician had preſcribed the air of
Languedoc and Provence; and St. Aubert
determined, therefore, to travel leiſurely
along the ſhores of the Mediterranean, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Provence.</p>
            <p>They retired early to their chamber on
the night before their departure; but Emily
had a few books and other things to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,
and the clock had ſtruck twelve before
ſhe had finiſhed, or had remembered that
ſome of her drawing inſtruments, which ſhe
meant to take with her, were in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
below. As ſhe went to fetch theſe,
ſhe paſſed her father's room, and, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the door half open, concluded that he
was in his ſtudy—for, ſince the death of
Madame St. Aubert, it had been frequently
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0247300301:70"/>
his cuſtom to riſe from his reſtleſs bed, and
go thither to compoſe his mind. When ſhe
was below ſtairs ſhe looked into this room,
but without finding him; and as ſhe returned
to her chamber, ſhe tapped at his door, and
receiving no anſwer, ſtepped ſoftly in, to be
certain whether he was there.</p>
            <p>The room was dark, but a light glim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mered
through ſome panes of glaſs that
were placed in the upper part of a cloſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>door.
Emily believed her father to be in
the cloſet, and, ſurpriſed that he was up at
ſo late an hour, apprehended he was unwell,
and was going to enquire; but, conſidering
that her ſudden appearance at this hour
might alarm him, ſhe removed her light to
the ſtair-cafe, and then ſtepped ſoftly to the
cloſet. On looking through the panes of
glaſs, ſhe ſaw him ſeated at a ſmall table, with
papers before him, ſome of which he was
reading with deep attention and intereſt,
during which he often wept, and ſobbed
aloud. Emily, who had come to the door
to learn whether her father was ill, was
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0247300301:71"/>
now detained there by a mixture of curioſity
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd tenderneſs. She could not witneſs his
sorrow, without being anxious to know the
subject of it; and ſhe therefore continued
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o obſerve him in ſilence, concluding that
thoſe papers were letters of her late mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
Preſently he knelt down, and with
look ſo ſolemn as ſhe had ſeldom ſeen him
aſſume, and which was mingled with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
wild expreſſion, that partook more of
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>orror than of any other character, he pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>d
ſilently for a conſiderable time.</p>
            <p>When he roſe, a ghaſtly paleneſs was on
<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>is countenance. Emily was haſtily retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

but ſhe ſaw him turn again to the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>apers, and ſhe ſtopped. He took from

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0247300301:72"/>
ſhe ſaw to be real. She never knew till now
that he had a picture of any other lady than
her mother, much leſs that he had one which
he evidently valued ſo highly; but having
looked repeatedly, to be certain that it was
not the reſemblance of Madame St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,

            <p>At length St. Aubert returned the pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
into its caſe; and Emily, recollecting

ſoftly withdrew from the chamber.</p>

            <p>ST. Aubert, inſtead of taking the more
direct road, that ran along the feet of the
Pyrenées to Languedoc, choſe one that,
winding over the heights, afforded more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive
views and greater variety of romantic
ſcenery. He turned a little out of his way
to take leave of M. Barreaux, whom he
found botanizing in the wood near his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,
and who, when he was told the purpoſe
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0247300301:74"/>
of St. Aubert's viſit, expreſſed a degree of
concern, ſuch as his friend had thought it
was ſcarcely poſſible for him to feel on any
ſimilar occaſion. They parted with mutual
regret.</p>
            <p>"If any thing could have tempted me
from my retirement," ſaid M. Barreaux, "it
would have been the pleaſure of accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying
you on this little tour. I do not often
offer compliments; you may, therefore, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve
me, when I ſay, that I ſhall look for
your return with impatience."</p>
            <p>The travellers proceeded on their journey.
As they aſcended the heights, St. Aubert
often looked back upon his chateau, in the
plain below; tender images crowded to his
mind; his melancholy imagination ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
that he ſhould return no more; and
though he checked this wandering thought,
ſtill he continued to look, till the hazineſs
of diſtance blended his home with the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
landſcape, and St. Aubert ſeemed to
"Drag at each remove a lengthening chain."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0247300301:75"/>
He and Emily continued ſunk in muſing
ſilence for ſome leagues, from which melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
reverie Emily firſt awoke, and her
young fancy, ſtruck with the grandeur of
the objects around, gradually yielded to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
impreſſions. The road now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended
into glens, confined by ſtupendous
walls of rock, grey and barren, except
where ſhrubs fringed their ſummits, or
patches of meagre vegetation tinted their
receſſes, in which the wild goat was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
browſing. And now, the way led
to the lofty cliffs, from whence the landſcape
was ſeen extending in all its magnificence.</p>
            <p>Emily could not reſtrain her tranſport as
ſhe looked over the pine foreſts of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
upon the vaſt plains, that, enriched with
woods, towns, bluſhing vines, and planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of almonds, palms and olives, ſtretched
along, till their various colours melted in
diſtance into one harmonious hue, that
ſeemed to unite earth with heaven. Through
the whole of this glorious ſcene the majeſtic
Garonne wandered; deſcending from its
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0247300301:76"/>
ſource among the Pyrenées, and winding its
blue waves towards the Bay of Biſcay.</p>
            <p>The ruggedneſs of the unfrequented road
often obliged the wanderers to alight from
their little carriage, but they thought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
amply repaid for this inconvenience
by the grandeur of the ſcenes; and, while
the muleteer led his animals ſlowly over the
broken ground, the travellers had leiſure to
linger and theſe ſolitudes, and to indulge
the ſublime reflections, which ſoften, while
they elevate, the heart, and fill it with the
certainty of a preſent God! Still the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of St. Aubert was touched with that
penſive melancholy, which gives to every
object a mellower tint, and breathes a ſacred
charm over all around.</p>
            <p>They had provided againſt part of
the evil to be encountered from a want
of convenient inns, by carrying a ſtock of
proviſions in the carriage, ſo that they
might take refreſhment on any pleaſant ſpot,
in the open air, and paſs the nights where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
they ſhould happen to meet with a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0247300301:77"/>
comfortable cottage. For the mind, alſo,
they had provided, by a work on botany,
written by M. Barreaux, and by ſeveral of
the Latin and Italian poets; while Emily's
pencil enabled her to preſerve ſome of
thoſe combinations of forms, which charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her at every ſtep.</p>
            <p>The lonelineſs of the road, where, only
now and then, a peaſant was ſeen driving his
mule, or ſome mountaineer-children at play
among the rocks, heightened the effect of
the ſcenery. St. Aubert was ſo much ſtruck
with it, that he determined, if he could
hear of a road, to penetrate further among
the mountains, and, bending his way rather
more to the ſouth, to emerge into Rouſillon,
and coaſt the Mediterranean along part of
that country to Languedoc.</p>
            <p>Soon after mid-day, they reached the
ſummit of one of thoſe cliffs, which, bright
with the verdure of palm trees, adorn,
like gems, the tremendous walls of the
rocks, and which overlooked the greater
part of Gaſcony, and part of Languedoc.
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0247300301:78"/>
Here was ſhade, and the freſh water of a
ſpring, that, gliding among the turf, under
the trees, thence precipitated itſelf from
rock to rock, till its daſhing murmurs were
loſt in the abyſs, though its white foam
was long ſeen amid the darkneſs of the
pines below.</p>
            <p>This was a ſpot well ſuited for reſt, and
the travellers alighted to dine, while the
mules were unharneſſed to browſe on the
ſavoury herbs that enriched this ſummit.</p>
            <p>It was ſome time before St. Aubert or
Emily could withdraw their attention from
the ſurrounding objects, ſo as to partake of
their little repaſt. Seated in the ſhade of
the palms, St. Aubert pointed out to her
obſervation the courſe of the rivers, the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of great towns, and the boundaries of
provinces, which ſcience, rather than the eye,
enabled him to deſcribe. Notwithſtanding
this occupation, when he had talked awhile
he ſuddenly became ſilent, thoughtful, and
tears often ſwelled to his eyes, which Emily
obſerved, and the ſympathy of her own
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0247300301:79"/>
heart told her their cauſe. The ſcene
before them bore ſome reſemblance, though
it was on a much grander ſcale, to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
one of the late Madame St. Aubert,
within view of the fiſhing-houſe. They
both obſerved this, and thought how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
ſhe would have been with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
landſcape, while they knew that her eyes
muſt never, never more open upon this
world. St. Aubert remembered the laſt
time of his viſiting that ſpot in company
with her, and alſo the mournfully preſaging
thoughts which had then ariſen in his mind,
and were now, even thus ſoon, realized!
The recollections ſubdued him, and he
abruptly roſe from his ſeat, and walked
away to where no eye could obſerve his grief.</p>
            <p>When he returned, his countenance had
recovered its uſual ſerenity; he took Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's
hand, preſſed it affectionately, without
ſpeaking, and ſoon after called to the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leteer,
who ſat at a little diſtance, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a road among the mountains towards
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0247300301:80"/>
Rouſillon. Michael ſaid, there were ſeveral
that way, but he did not know how far they
extended, or even whether they were paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able;
and St. Aubert, who did not intend
to travel after ſun ſet, aſked what village
they could reach about that time. The mule<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer
calculated, that they could eaſily reach
Mateau, which was in their preſent road; but
that, if they took a road that ſloped more to
the ſouth, towards Rouſillon, there was a
hamlet, which he thought they could gain
before the evening ſhut in.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert, after ſome heſitation, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined
to take the latter courſe, and Michael,
having finiſhed his meal, and harneſſed his
mules, again ſet forward, but ſoon ſtopped;
and St. Aubert ſaw him doing homage to a
croſs, that ſtood on a rock impending over
their way. Having concluded his devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
he ſmacked his whip in the air, and,
in ſpite of the rough road, and the pain of his
poor mules, which he had been lately lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
rattled, in a full gallop, along the edge
of a precipice, which it made the eye dizzy
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0247300301:81"/>
to look down. Emily was terrified almoſt
to fainting; and St. Aubert, apprehending
ſtill greater danger from ſuddenly ſtopping
the driver, was compelled to ſit quietly, and
truſt his fate to the ſtrength and diſcretion
of the mules, who ſeemed to poſſeſs a greater
portion of the latter quality than their maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
for they carried the travellers ſafely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
the valley, and there ſtopped upon the
brink of the rivulet that watered it.</p>
            <p>Leaving the ſplendour of extenſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
they now entered this narrow valley
ſcreened by</p>
            <q>
               <l>Rocks on rocks piled, as if by magic ſpell,</l>
               <l>Here ſcorch'd by lightnings, there with ivy green.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The ſcene of barrenneſs was here and
there interrupted by the ſpreading branches
of the larch and cedar, which threw their
gloom over the cliff, or a hwart the torrent
that rolled in the vale. No living creature
appeared, except the izard, ſcrambling
among the rocks, and often hanging upon
points ſo dangerous, that fancy ſhrunk from
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0247300301:82"/>
the view of them. This was ſuch a ſcene
as <hi>Salvator</hi> would have choſen, had he then
exiſted, for his canvaſs; St. Aubert, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
by the romantic character of the
place, almoſt expected to ſee banditti ſtart
from behind ſome projecting rock, and be
kept his hand upon the arms with which
he always travelled.</p>
            <p>As they advanced, the valley opened; its
ſavage features gradually ſoftened, and, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
evening, they were among heathy
mountains, ſtretched in far perſpective,
along which the ſolitary ſheep-bell was
heard, and the voice of the ſhepherd calling
his wandering flocks to the nightly fold.
His cabin, partly ſhadowed by the cork-tree
and the ilex, which St. Aubert obſerved to
flouriſh in higher regions of the air than any
other trees, except the fir, was all the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
habitation that yet appeared. Along
the bottom of this valley the moſt vivid
verdure was ſpread; and, in the little hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
receſſes of the mountains, under the
ſhade of the oak and cheſnut, herds of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0247300301:83"/>
were grazing. Groups of them, too,
were often ſeen repoſing on the banks of
the rivulet, or laving their ſides in the
cool ſtream, and ſipping its wave.</p>
            <p>The ſun was now ſetting upon the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley;
its laſt light gleamed upon the water,
and heightened the rich yellow and purple
tints of the heath and broom, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread
the mountains. St. Aubert enquired
of Michael the diſtance to the hamlet he had
mentioned, but the man could not with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty
tell; and Emily began to fear that
he had miſtaken the road. Here was no
human being to aſſiſt, or direct them; they
had left the ſhepherd and his cabin far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind,
and the ſcene became ſo obſcured in
twilight, that the eye could not follow the
diſtant perſpective of the valley in ſearch of a
cottage or a hamlet. A glow of the horizon
ſtill marked the weſt, and this was of ſome
little use to the travellers. Michael ſeemed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring
to keep up his courage by ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
his muſic, however, was not of a kind
to diſperſe melancholy; he ſung, in a ſort of
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0247300301:84"/>
chant, one of the moſt diſmal ditties his
preſent auditors had ever heard, and St.
Aubert at length diſcovered it to be a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-hymn
to his favourite ſaint.</p>
            <p>They travelled on, ſunk in that thoughtful
melancholy, with which twilight and ſolitude
impreſs the mind. Michael had now ended
his ditty, and nothing was heard but the
drowſy murmur of the breeze among the
woods, and its light flutter, as it blew freſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
into the carriage. They were at length
rouſed by the ſound of fire-arms. St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
called to the muleteer to ſtop, and
they liſtened. The noiſe was not repeated;
but preſently they heard a ruſtling among
the brakes. St. Aubert drew forth a piſtol,
and ordered Michael to proceed as faſt as
poſſible; who had not long obeyed, before
a horn ſounded, that made the mountains
ring. He looked again from the window,
and then ſaw a young man ſpring from the
buſhes into the road, followed by a couple
of dogs. The ſtranger was in a hunter's
dreſs. His gun was ſlung acroſs his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0247300301:85"/>
the hunter's horn hung from his belt,
and in his hand was a ſmall pike, which, as
he held it, added to the manly grace of his
figure, and aſſiſted the agility of his ſteps.</p>
            <p>After a moment's heſitation, St. Aubert
again ſtopped the carriage, and waited till
he came up, that they might enquire con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the hamlet they were in ſearch of.
The ſtranger informed him, that it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
half a league diſtant, that he was going
thither himſelf, and would readily ſhew the
way. St. Aubert thanked him for the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and, pleaſed with his chevalier-like air
and open countenance, aſked him to take a
ſeat in the carriage; which the ſtranger, with
an acknowledgment, declined, adding that
he would keep pace with the mules. "But
I fear you will be wretchedly accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated,"
ſaid he: "the inhabitants of theſe
mountains are a ſimple people, who are not
only without the luxuries of life, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
deſtitute of what in other places are
held to be its neceſſaries."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0247300301:86"/>
"I perceive you are not one of its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants,
ſir," ſaid St. Aubert.</p>
            <p>"No, ſir, I am only a wanderer here."</p>
            <p>The carriage drove on, and the increaſing
duſk made the travellers very thankful that
they had a guide; the frequent glens, too,
that now opened among the mountains, would
likewiſe have added to their perplexity. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
as ſhe looked up one of theſe, ſaw ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at a great diſtance like a bright cloud
in the air. "What light is yonder, ſir?"
ſaid ſhe. St. Aubert looked, and perceived
that it was the ſnowy ſummit of a mountain,
ſo much higher than any around it, that it
ſtill reflected the ſun's rays, while thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
lay in deep ſhade.</p>
            <p>At length, village lights were ſeen to
twinkle through the duſk, and, ſoon after,
ſome cottages were diſcovered in the valley,
or rather were ſeen by reflection in the ſtream,
on whoſe margin they ſtood, and which ſtill
gleamed with the evening light.</p>
            <p>The ſtranger now came up, and St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0247300301:87"/>
on further enquiry, found not only
that there was no inn in the place, but not
any ſort of houſe of public reception. The
ſtranger, however, offered to walk on, and
enquire for a cottage to accommodate them;
for which further civility St. Aubert return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his thanks, and ſaid, that, as the village
was ſo near, he would alight, and walk with
him. Emily followed ſlowly in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.</p>
            <p>On the way, St. Aubert aſked his companion
what ſucceſs he had had in the chaſe. "Not
much, ſir," he replied, "nor do I aim at it.
I am pleaſed with the country, and mean to
ſaunter away a few weeks among its ſcenes.
My dogs I take with me more for compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionſhip
than for game. This dreſs, too,
gives me an ostenſible buſineſs, and procures
me that reſpect from the people, which
would, perhaps, be refuſed to a lonely ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
who had no viſible motive for coming
among them."</p>
            <p>"I admire your taſte," ſaid St. Aubert,
"and, if I was a younger man, ſhould like to
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0247300301:88"/>
paſs a few weeks in your way exceedingly.
I, too, am a wanderer, but neither my plan
nor purſuits are exactly like yours—I go in
ſearch of health, as much as of amuſement."
St. Aubert ſighed, and pauſed; and then,
ſeeming to recollect himſelf, he reſumed:
"If I can hear of a tolerable road, that ſhall
afford decent accommodation, it is my inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to paſs into Rouſillon, and along the
ſea-ſhore to Languedoc. You, ſir, ſeem to
be acquainted with the country, and can,
perhaps, give me information on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject."</p>
            <p>The ſtranger ſaid, that what information
he could give was entirely at his ſervice;
and then mentioned a road rather more to
the eaſt, which led to a town, whence it
would be eaſy to proceed into Rouſillon.</p>
            <p>They now arrived at the village, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced
their ſearch for a cottage, that would
afford a night's lodging. In ſeveral, which
they entered, ignorance, poverty, and mirth
ſeemed equally to prevail; and the owners
eyed St. Aubert with a mixture of curioſity
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0247300301:89"/>
and timidity. Nothing like a bed could be
found, and he had ceaſed to enquire for one,
when Emily joined him, who obſerved the
languor of her father's countenance, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented,
that he had taken a road ſo ill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
with the comforts neceſſary for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid.
Other cottages, which they examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
ſeemed ſomewhat leſs ſavage than the
former, conſiſting of two rooms, if ſuch they
could be called; the firſt of theſe occupied
by mules and pigs, the ſecond by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
which generally conſiſted of fix or
eight children, with their parents, who ſlept
on beds of ſkins and dried beech leaves,
ſpread upon a mud floor. Here, light was
admitted, and ſmoke diſcharged, through
an aperture in the roof; and here the ſcent
of ſpirits (for the travelling ſmugglers, who
haunted the Pyrenées, had made this rude
people familiar with the uſe of liquors)
was generally perceptible enough. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
turned from ſuch ſcenes, and looked
at her father with anxious tenderneſs, which
the young ſtranger ſeemed to obſerve; for,

               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0247300301:94"/>
drawing St. Aubert aſide, he made him an
offer of his own bed. "It is a decent
one," ſaid he, "when compared with what
we have juſt ſeen, yet ſuch as in other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.
I ſhould be aſhamed to offer
you." St. Aubert acknowledged how much
he felt himſelf obliged by this kindneſs, but
refuſed to accept it, till the young ſtranger
would take no denial. "Do not give me
the pain of knowing, ſir," ſaid he, "that
an invalid, like you, lies on hard ſkins,
while I ſleep in a bed. Beſides, ſir, your
refuſal wounds my pride; I muſt believe
you think my offer unworthy your accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.
Let me ſhew you the way. I have
no doubt my landlady can accommodate this
young lady alſo."</p>
            <p>St. Aubert, at length, confented, that, if
this could be done, he would accept his
kindneſs, though he felt rather ſurpriſed,
that the ſtranger had proved himſelf ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
in gallantry, as to adminiſter to the
repoſe of an infirm man, rather than to that
of a very lovely young woman, for he had
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0247300301:95"/>
not once offered the room for Emily. But
ſhe thought nor of herſelf, and the animated
ſmile ſhe gave him, told how much ſhe felt
herſelf obliged for the preference of her
father.</p>
            <p>On their way, the ſtranger, whoſe name
was Valancourt, ſtepped on firſt to ſpeak to
his hoſteſs, and ſhe came out to welcome St.
Aubert into a cottage, much ſuperior to any
he had ſeen. This good woman ſeemed
very willing to accommodate the ſtrangers,
who were ſoon compelled to accept the
only two beds in the place. Eggs and milk
were the only food the cottage afforded;
but againſt ſcarcity of proviſions St. Aubert
had provided and he requeſted Valancourt
to ſtay, and partake with him of leſs home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
fare; an invitation, which was readily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted,
and they paſſed an hour in intelligent
converſation. St. Aubert was much pleaſed
with the manly frankneſs, and
keen ſuſceptibillty to the grrandeur of nature,
which his new acquaintance diſcovered;
and, indeed, he had often been heared to ſay,








<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0247300301:96"/>
that, without a certain ſimplicity of heart,
this taſte could not exiſt in any ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree.</p>
            <p>The converſation was interrupted by a
violent uproar without, in which the voice
of the muleteer was heard above every other
ſound. Valancourt ſtarted from his ſeat,
and went to enquire the occaſion; but the
diſpute continued ſo long afterwards, that
St. Aubert went himſelf, and found Michael
quarrelling with the hoſteſs, becauſe ſhe had
refuſed to let his mules lie in a little room
where he and three of her ſons were to paſs
the night. The place was wretched enough,
but there was no other for theſe people to
ſleep in; and, with ſomewhat more of deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
than was uſual among the inhabitants
of this wild tract of country, ſhe perſiſted in
refuſing to let the animals have the ſame
<hi>bed-chamber</hi> with her children. This was a
tender point with the muleteer; his honour
was wounded when his mules were treated
with diſreſpect, and he would have received
a blow, perhaps, with more meekneſs. He
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0247300301:97"/>
declared that his beaſts were as honeſt beaſts,
and as good beaſts, as any in the whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince;
and that they had a right to be well
treated wherever they went. "They are
as harmleſs as lambs," ſaid he, "if people
don't affront them. I never knew them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have
themſelves amiſs above once or twice
in my life, and then they had good reaſon
for doing ſo. Once, indeed, they kicked
at a boy's leg that lay aſleep in the ſtable,
and broke it; but I told them they were out
there, and by Saint Anthony! I believe
they underſtood me, for they never did ſo
again."</p>
            <p>He concluded this eloquent harangue
with proteſting, that they ſhould ſhare with
him, go where he would.</p>
            <p>The diſpute was at length ſettled by Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
who drew the hoſteſs aſide, and
deſired ſhe would let the muleteer and his
beaſts have the place in queſtion to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
while her ſons ſhould have the bed
of ſkins deſigned for him, for that he would
wrap himſelf in his cloak, and ſleep on the
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0247300301:98"/>
bench by the cottage door. But this ſhe
thought it her duty to oppoſe, and ſhe felt
it to be her inclination to diſappoint the
muleteer. Valancourt, however, was poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
and the tedious affair was at length ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled.</p>
            <p>It was late when St. Aubert and Emily
retired to their rooms, and Valancourt to his
ſtation at the door, which, at this mild ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
he preferred to a cloſe cabin and a bed
of ſkins. St. Aubert was ſomewhat ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to find in his room volumes of Homer,
Horace, and Petrarch; but the name of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
written in them, told him to whom
they belonged.</p>

            <p>ST. Aubert awoke at an early hour, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhed
by ſleep, and deſirous to ſet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
He invited the ſtranger to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt
with him; and, talking again of the
road, Valancourt ſaid, that, ſome months
paſt, he had travelled as far as Beaujeu,
which was a town of ſome conſequence on
the way to Rouſillon. He recommended
it to St. Aubert to take that route, and the
latter determined to do ſo.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0247300301:100"/>
"The road from this hamlet," ſaid Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
"and that to Beaujeu, part at the
diſtance of about a league and an half from
hence; if you will give me leave, I will di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect
your muleteer ſo far. I muſt wander
ſomewhere, and your company would make
this a pleaſanter ramble than any other I
could take."</p>
            <p>St. Aubert thankfully accepted his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer,
and they ſet out together, the young
ſtranger on foot, for he refuſed the invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of St. Aubert to take a ſeat in his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
carriage.</p>
            <p>The road wound along the feet of the
mountains through a paſtoral valley, bright
with verdure, and varied with groves of
dwarf oak, beech, and ſycamore, under
whoſe branches herds of cattle repoſed.
The mountain-aſh too, and the weeping
birch, often threw their pendant foliage
over the ſteeps above, where the ſcanty ſoil
ſcarcely concealed their roots, and where
their light branches waved to every breeze
that fluttered from the mountains.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0247300301:101"/>
The travellers were frequently met at
this early hour, for the ſun had not yet riſen
upon the valley, by ſhepherds driving im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
flocks from their folds to feed upon
the hills. St. Aubert had ſet out thus
early, not only that he might enjoy the firſt
appearance of ſun-riſe, but that he might
inhale the firſt pure breath of morning,
which above all things is refreſhing to the
ſpirits of the invalid. In theſe regions it
was particularly ſo, where an abundance of
wild flowers and aromatic herbs breathed
forth their eſſence on the air.</p>
            <p>The dawn, which ſoftened the ſcenery
with its peculiar grey tint, now diſperſed,
and Emily watched the progreſs of the
day, firſt trembling on the tops of the
higheſt cliffs, then touching them with ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
light, while their ſides and the vale be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
were ſtill wrapt in dewy miſt. Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while,
the ſullen grey of the eaſtern clouds
began to bluſh, then to redden, and then to
glow with a thouſand colours, till the
golden light darted over all the air, touched
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0247300301:102"/>
the lower points of the mountain's brow,
and glanced in long ſloping beams upon
the valley and its ſtream. All nature
ſeemed to have awakened from death into
life; the ſpirit of St. Aubert was reno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated.
His heart was full; hewept, and his
thoughts aſcended to the Great Creator.</p>
            <p>Emily wiſhed to trip along the turf, ſo
green and bright with dew, and to taſte the
full delight of that liberty, which the
izard ſeemed to enjoy as he bounded along
the brow of the cliffs; while Valancourt
often ſtopped to ſpeak with the travellers,
and with ſocial feeling to point out to them
the peculiar objects of his admiration. St.
Aubert was pleaſed with him: "Here is
the real ingenuouſneſs and ardour of
youth," ſaid he to himſelf; "this young
man has never been at Paris."</p>
            <p>He was ſorry when they came to the ſpot
where the roads parted, and his heart took
a more affectionate leave of him than is
uſual after ſo ſhort an acquaintance. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
talked long by the ſide of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0247300301:103"/>
ſeemed more than once to be
going, but ſtill lingered, and appeared to
ſearch anxiouſly for topics of converſation
to account for his delay. At length he
took leave. As he went, St. Aubert ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
him look with an earneſt and penſive
eye at Emily, who bowed to him with a
countenance full of timid ſweetneſs, while
the carriage drove on. St. Aubert, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
reaſon, ſoon after looked from the
window, and ſaw Valancourt ſtanding upon
the bank of the road, reſting on his pike
with folded arms, and following the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
with his eyes. He waved his hand,
and Valancourt, ſeeming to awake from
his reverie, returned the ſalute, and ſtarted
away.</p>
            <p>The aſpect of the country now began
to change, and the travellers ſoon found
themſelves among mountains covered from
their baſe nearly to their ſummits with
foreſts of gloomy pine, except where a
rock of granite ſhot up from the vale, and
loſt its ſnowy top in the clouds. The ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulte,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0247300301:104"/>
which had hitherto accompanied
them, now expanded into a river; and,
flowing deeply and ſilently along, reflected,
as in a mirror, the blackneſs of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending
ſhades. Sometimes a cliff was
ſeen lifting its bold head above the woods
and the vapours, that floated mid-way down
the mountains; and ſometimes a face of
perpendicular marble roſe from the water's
edge, over which the larch threw his gigan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
arms, here ſcathed with lightning, and
there floating in luxuriant foliage.</p>
            <p>They continued to travel over a rough
and unfrequented road, ſeeing now and
then at a diſtance the ſolitary ſhepherd,
with his dog, ſtalking along the valley,
and hearing only the daſhing of torrents,
which the woods concealed from the eye,
the long ſullen murmur of the breeze, as it
ſwept over the pines, or the notes of the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
and the vulture, which were ſeen tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering
round the beetling cliff.</p>
            <p>Often, as the carriage moved ſlowly
over uneven ground, St. Aubert alighted,
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0247300301:105"/>
and amuſed himſelf with examining the
curious plants that grew on the banks
of the road, and with which theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions
abound; while Emily, wrapt in
high enthuſiaſm, wandered away under the
ſhades, liſtening in deep ſilence to the
lonely murmur of the woods.</p>
            <p>Neither village nor hamlet was ſeen for
many leagues; the goat-herd's or the
hunter's cabin, perched among the cliffs of
the rocks, were the only human habitations
that appeared.</p>
            <p>The travellers again took their dinner in
the open air, on a pleaſant ſpot in the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,
under the ſpreading ſhade of cedars;
and then ſet forward towards Beaujeu.</p>
            <p>The road now began to aſcend, and,
leaving the pine foreſts behind, wound
among rocky precipices. The evening
twilight again fell over the ſcene, and
the travellers were ignorant how far they
might yet be from Beaujeu. St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,
however, conjectured that the diſtance
could not be very great, and comforted
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0247300301:106"/>
himſelf with the proſpect of travelling on a
more frequented road after reaching that
town, where he deſigned to paſs the night.
Mingled woods, and rocks, and heathy
mountains were now ſeen obſcurely through
the duſk; but ſoon even theſe imperfect
images faded in darkneſs. Michael pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
with caution, for he could ſcarcely
diſtinguiſh the road; his mules, however,
ſeemed to have more ſagacity, and their
ſteps were ſure.</p>
            <p>On turning the angle of a mountain, a
light appeared at a diſtance, that illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
the rocks, and the horizon to a great
extent. It was evidently a large fire, but
whether accidental, or otherwiſe, there
were no means of knowing. St. Aubert
thought it was probably kindled by ſome of
the numerous banditti, that infeſted the Py<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renées,
and he became watchful and anxious
to know whether the road paſſed near this
fire. He had arms with him, which, on an
emergency, might afford ſome protection,
though certainly a very unequal one, againſt
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0247300301:107"/>
a band of robbers, ſo deſperate too as thoſe
uſually were who haunted theſe wild re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions.
While many reflections roſe upon
his mind, he heard a voice ſhouting
from the road behind, and ordering the
muleteer to ſtop. St. Aubert bade him
proceed as faſt as poſſible; but either Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael,
or his mules were obſtinate, for they
did not quit the old pace. Horſes' feet were
now heard; a man rode up to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
ſtill ordering the driver to ſtop; and
St. Aubert, who could no longer doubt
his purpoſe, was with difficulty able to
prepare a piſtol for his defence, when his
hand was upon the door of the chaiſe.
The man ſtaggered on his horſe, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of the piſtol was followed by a groan,
and St. Aubert's horror may be imagined,
when in the next inſtant he thought he
heard the faint voice of Valancourt. He
now himſelf bade the muleteer ſtop; and,
pronouncing the name of Valancourt, was
anſwered in a voice, that no longer ſuffered
him to doubt. St. Aubert, who inſtantly
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0247300301:108"/>
alighted and went to his aſſiſtance, found
him ſtill ſitting on his horſe, but bleeding
profuſely, and appearing to be in great
pain, though he endeavoured to ſoften the
terror of St. Aubert by aſſurances that he
was not materially hurt, the wound being
only in his arm. St. Aubert, with the
muleteer, aſſiſted him to diſmount, and he
ſat down on the bank of the road, where
St. Aubert tried to bind up his arm, but his
hands trembled ſo exceſſively that he could
not accompliſh it; and, Michael being now
gone in purſuit of the horſe, which, on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
diſengaged from his rider, had gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loped
off, he called Emily to his aſſiſtance.
Receiving no anſwer, he went to the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
and found her ſunk on the ſeat in a
fainting fit. Between the diſtreſs of this
circumſtance and that of leaving Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
bleeding, he ſcarcely knew what he
did; he endeavoured, however, to raiſe
her, and called to Michael to fetch water
from the rivulet that flowed by the road,
but Michael was gone beyond the reach of
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0247300301:109"/>
his voice. Valancourt, who heard theſe
calls, and alſo the repeated name of Emily,
inſtantly underſtood the ſubject of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs
and, almoſt forgetting his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
he haſtened to her relief. She was
reviving when he reached the carriage; and
then, underſtanding that anxiety for him had
occaſioned her indiſpoſition, he aſſured her,
in a voice that trembled, but not from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
that his wound was of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
While he ſaid this St. Aubert
turned round, and perceiving that he was
ſtill bleeding, the ſubject of his alarm
changed again, and he haſtily formed ſome
handkerchiefs into a bandage. This ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
the effusion of the blood; but St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,
dreading the conſequence of the
wound, enquired repeatedly how far they
were from Beaujeu; when, learning that it
was at two leagues diſtance, his diſtreſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
ſince he knew not how Valancourt,
in his preſent ſtate, would bear the motion
of the carriage, and perceived that he was
already faint from loſs of blood. When he
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0247300301:110"/>
mentioned the ſubject of his anxiety, Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
entreated that he would not ſuffer
himſelf to be thus alarmed on his account,
for that he had no doubt he ſhould be able
to ſupport himſelf very well; and then he
talked of the accident as a ſlight one. The
muleteer being now returned with Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court's
horſe, aſſiſted him into the chaiſe;
and, as Emily was now revived, they moved
ſlowly on towards Beaujeu.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert, when he had recovered from
the terror occaſioned him by this accident,
expreſſed ſurpriſe on ſeeing Valancourt,
who explained his unexpected appearance
by ſaying, "You, Sir, renewed my taſte
for ſociety; when you had left the hamlet,
it did indeed appear a ſolitude. I deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined,
therefore, ſince my object was merely
amuſement, to change the ſcene; and I took
this road, becauſe I knew it led through a
more romantic tract of mountains than the
ſpot I have left. Beſides," added he, heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating
for an inſtant, "I will own, and
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0247300301:111"/>
why ſhould I not? that I had ſome hope of
overtaking you."</p>
            <p>"And I have made you a very unexpected
return for the compliment," ſaid St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,
who lamented again the raſhneſs
which had produced the accident, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
the cauſe of his late alarm. But
Valancourt ſeemed anxious only to remove
from the minds of his companions every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſant
feeling relative to himſelf; and, for
that purpoſe, ſtill ſtruggled againſt a ſenſe
of pain, and tried to converſe with gaiety.
Emily meanwhile was ſilent, except when
Valancourt particularly addreſſed her, and
there was at thoſe times a tremulous tone
in his voice that ſpoke much.</p>
            <p>They were now ſo near the fire, which had
long flamed at a diſtance on the blackneſs
of night, that it gleamed upon the road,
and they could diſtinguiſh figures moving
about the blaze. The way winding ſtill
nearer, they perceived in the valley one of
thoſe numerous bands of gipſies, which
at that period particularly haunted the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0247300301:112"/>
wilds of the Pyrenées, and lived partly by
plundering the traveller. Emily looked
with ſome degree of terror on the ſavage
countenances of theſe people, ſhewn by the
ſire, which heightened the romantic effect
of the ſcenery, as it threw a red duſky gleam
upon the rocks and on the foliage of the
trees, leaving heavy maſſes of ſhade and
regions of obſcurity, which the eye feared
to penetrate.</p>
            <p>They were preparing their ſupper; a
large pot ſtood by the fire, over which ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
figures were buſy. The blaze diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
a rude kind of tent, round which
many children and dogs were playing, and
the whole formed a picture highly gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſque.
The travellers ſaw plainly their
danger. Valancourt was ſilent, but laid
his hand on one of St. Aubert's piſtols;
St. Aubert drew forth another, and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael
was ordered to proceed as faſt as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible.
They paſſed the place, however,
without being attacked; the rovers being
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0247300301:113"/>
probably unprepared for the opportunity,
and too buſy about their ſupper to feel
much intereſt, at the moment, in any thing
beſides.</p>
            <p>After a league and a half more, paſſed
in darkneſs, the travellers arrived at Beaujeu,
and drove up to the only inn the place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded;
which, though ſuperior to any they
had ſeen ſince they entered the mountains,
was bad enough.</p>
            <p>The ſurgeon of the town was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
ſent for, if a ſurgeon he could be
called, who preſcribed for horſes as well as
for men, and ſhaved faces at leaſt as dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly
as he ſet bones. After examining
Valancourt's arm, and perceiving that the
bullet had paſſed through the fleſh without
touching the bone, he dreſſed it, and left
him with a ſolemn preſcription of quiet,
which his patient was not inclined to obey
The delight of eaſe had now ſucceeded to
pain; for eaſe may be allowed to aſſume
a poſitive quality when contraſted with
anguiſh; and, his ſpirits thus re-animated,

he wiſhed to partake of the converſation of
St. Aubert and Emily, who, releaſed from
ſo many apprehenſions, were uncommonly
cheerful. Late as it was, however, St.
Aubert was obliged to go out with the
landlord to buy meat for ſupper; and
Emily, who, during this interval, had been
abſent as long as ſhe could, upon excuſes of
looking to their accommodation, which ſhe
found rather better than ſhe expected, was
compelled to return, and converſe with
Valancourt alone. They talked of the
character of the ſcenes they had paſſed, of
the natural hiſtory of the country, of poetry,
and of St. Aubert; a ſubject on which
Emily always ſpoke and liſtened to with
peculiar pleaſure.</p>
            <p>The travellers paſſed an agreeable even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
but St. Aubert was fatigued with his
journey; and, as Valancourt ſeemed again
ſenſible of pain, they ſeparated ſoon after
ſupper.</p>
            <p>In the morning St. Aubert found that
Valancourt had paſſed, a reſtleſs night;
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0247300301:119"/>
that he was feveriſh, and his wound very
painful. The ſurgeon, when he dreſſed it,
adviſed him to remain quietly at Beaujeu;
advice which was too reaſonable to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.
St. Aubert, however, had no fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
opinion of this practitioner, and
was anxious to commit Valancourt into
more ſkilful hands; but learning, upon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
that there was no town within ſeveral
leagues which ſeemed more likely to afford
better advice, he altered the plan of, his
journey, and determined to await the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
of Valancourt, who, with ſomewhat
more ceremony than, ſincerity, made, many
objections to this delay.</p>
            <p>By order of his furgeon, Valancourt did
not go out of the houſe that day; but St.
Aubert and Emily ſurveyed with delight
the environs of the town, ſituated at the feet
of the Pyrenean Alps, that roſe, ſome in
abrupt precipices, and others ſwelling with,
woods of cedar, ſir, and cypreſs, which
ſtretched nearly to their, higheſt ſummits.
The cheerful green of the beech and
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0247300301:120"/>
mountain-aſh was ſometimes ſeen, like a
gleam of light, amidſt the dark verdure of
the foreſt; and ſometimes a torrent poured
its ſparkling flood, high among the woods.</p>
            <p>Valancourt's indiſpoſition detained the
travellers at Beaujeu ſeveral days, during
which interval St. Aubert had obſerved his
diſpoſition and his talents with the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic
enquiry ſo natural to him. He ſaw a
frank and generous nature, full of ardour,
highly ſuſceptible of whatever is grand and
beautiful, but impetuous, wild, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
romantic. Valancourt had known
little of the world. His perceptions were
clear, and his feelings juſt; his indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of an unworthy, or his admiration of
a generous action, were expreſſed in terms
of equal vehemence. St. Aubert ſometimes
ſmiled at his warmth, but ſeldom checked it,
and often repeated to himſelf, "This young
man has never been at Paris." A ſigh ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
followed this ſilent ejaculation. He
determined not to leave Valancourt till he
ſhould be perfectly recovered; and, as he was
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0247300301:121"/>
now well enough to travel, though not able
to manage his horſe, St. Aubert invited
him to accompany him for a few days in the
carriage. This he the more readily did,
ſince he had diſcovered that Valancourt
was of a family of the ſame name in Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony,
with whoſe reſpectability he was well
acquainted. The latter accepted the offer
with great pleaſure, and they again ſet
forward among theſe romantic wilds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
Rouſillon.</p>
            <p>They travelled leiſurely; ſtopping where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
a ſcene uncommonly grand appeared;
frequently alighting to walk to an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence,
whither the mules could not go,
from which the proſpect opened in greater
magnificence; and often ſauntering over
hillocks covered with lavender, wild thyme,
juniper, and tamariſc; and under the
ſhades of woods, between whoſe boles they
caught the long mountain-viſta, ſublime
beyond any thing that Emily had ever ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0247300301:122"/>
St. Aubert ſometimes amuſed himſelf
with botanizing, while Valancourt and
Emily ſtrolled on; he pointing out to her
notice the objects that particularly charmed
him, and reciting beautiful paſſages from
ſuch of the Latin and Italian poets as he
had heard her admire. In the pauſes of
converſation, when he thought himſelf not
obſerved, he frequently fixed his eyes pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively
on her countenance, which expreſſed
with ſo much animation the taſte and energy
of her mind; and when he ſpoke again,
there was a peculiar tenderneſs in the tone
of his voice, that defeated any attempt to
conceal his ſentiments. By degrees theſe
ſilent pauſes became more frequent; till
Emily, only, betrayed an anxiety to inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
them; and ſhe, who had been hitherto
reſerved, would now talk again, and again,
of the woods and the vallies and the
mountains, to avoid the danger of ſympa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy
and ſilence.</p>
            <p>From Beaujeu the road had conſtantly
aſcended, conducting the travellers into the
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0247300301:123"/>
higher regions of the air, where immenſe
glaciers exhibited their frozen horrors, and
eternal ſnow whitened the ſummits of the
mountains. They often pauſed to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate
theſe ſtupendous ſcenes, and, ſeated on
ſome wild cliff, where only the ilex or the
larch could flouriſh, looked over dark
foreſts of fir, and precipices where human
foot had never wandered, into the glen—ſo
deep, that the thunder of the torrent,
which was ſeen to foam along the bottom,
was ſcarcely heard to murmur. Over theſe
crags roſe others of ſtupendous height,
and fantaſtic ſhape; ſome ſhooting into
cones; others impending far over their
baſe, in huge maſſes of granite, along
whoſe broken ridges was often lodged a
weight of ſnow, that, trembling even to the
vibration of a found, threatened to bear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction
in its courſe to the vale. Around,
on every ſide, far as the eye could penetrate,
were ſeen only forms of grandeur—the
long perſpective of mountain tops, tinged
with ethereal blue, or white with ſnow;
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0247300301:124"/>
vallies of ice, and foreſts of gloomy fir.
The ſerenity and clearneſs of the air in
Theſe high regions were particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
to the travellers; it ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire
them with a finer ſpirit, and diffuſed
an indeſcribable complacency over their
minds. They had no words to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the ſublime emotions they felt. A so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
expreſſion characterized the feelings of
St. Aubert; tears often came to his eyes,
and he frequently walked away from his
companions. Valancourt now and then
ſpoke, to point to Emily's notice ſome fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the ſcene. The thinneſs of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere,
through which every object
came ſo diſtinctly to the eye, ſurpriſed and
deluded her; who could ſcarcely believe
that objects, which appeared ſo near, were,
in reality, ſo diſtant. The deep ſilence of
theſe ſolitudes was broken only at intervals
by the ſcream of the vultures, ſeen cowering
round ſome cliff below, or by the cry of
the eagle ſailing high in the air; except
when the travellers liſtened to the hollow
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0247300301:125"/>
thunder that ſometimes muttered at their
feet. While, above, the deep blue of the
heavens was unobſcured by the lighteſt
cloud, half way down the mountains, long
billows of vapour were frequently ſeen roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
now wholly excluding the country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
and now opening, and partially reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its features. Emily delighted to obſerve
the grandeur of theſe clouds as they
changed in ſhape and tints, and to watch
their various effect on the lower world,
whoſe features, partly veiled, were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
aſſuming new forms of ſublimity.</p>
            <p>After traverſing theſe regions for many
leagues, they began to deſcend towards
Rouſillon, and features of beauty then min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
with the ſcene. Yet the travellers did
not look back without ſome regret to the
ſublime objects they had quitted; though
the eye, fatigued with the extenſion of its
powers, was glad to repoſe on the verdure
of woods and paſtures, that now hung on
the margin of the river below; to view
again the humble cottage ſhaded by cedars,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0247300301:126"/>
the playful group of mountaineer-children,
and the flowery nooks that appeared among
the hills.</p>
            <p>As they deſcended, they ſaw at a diſtance,
on the right, one of the grand paſſes of the
Pyreneáes into Spain, gleaming with its bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements
and towers to the ſplendour of the
ſetting rays, yellow tops of woods colouring
the ſteeps below, while far above aſpired the
ſnowy points of the mountains, ſtill reflect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
a roſy hue.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert began to look out for the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
town he had been directed to by the
people of Beaujeu, and where he meant to
paſs the night; but no habitation yet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
Of its diſtance Valancourt could
not aſſiſt him to judge, for he had never
been ſo far along this chain of Alps before.
There was, however, a road to guide them;
and there could be little doubt that it was
the right one; for, ſince they had left
Beaujeu, there had been no variety of tracks
to perplex or miſlead.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0247300301:127"/>
The ſun now gave his laſt light, and St.
Aubert bade the muleteer proceed with all
Poſſible diſpatch. He found, indeed, the
laſſitude of ilineſs return upon him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
a day of uncommon fatigue, both of
body and mind, and he longed for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
His anxiety was not ſoothed by
Obſerving a numerous train, conſiſting of
men, horſes, and loaded mules, winding
down the ſteeps of an oppoſite mountain,
appearing and diſappearing at intervals
among the woods, ſo that its numbers could
not be judged of. Something bright, like
arms, glanced in the ſetting ray, and the
military dreſs was diſtinguiſhable upon the
men who were in the van, and on others
ſcattered among the troop that followed.
As theſe wound into the vale, the rear of
the party emerged from the woods, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
a band of ſoldiers. St. Aubert's
apprehendſions now ſubſided; he had no
doubt that the train before him conſiſted of
ſmugglers, who, in conveying prohibited
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0247300301:128"/>
goods over the Pyrenées, had been encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
and conquered by a party of troops.</p>
            <p>The travellers had lingered ſo long among
the ſublimer ſcenes of theſe mountains,
that they found themſelves entirely miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in their calculation that they could reach
Montigny at ſun-ſet; but, as they wound
along the valley, they ſaw, on a rude
Alpine bridge, that united two lofty crags
of the glen, a group of mountaineer-children,
amuſing themſelves with dropping
pebbles into a torrent below, and watching
the ſtones plunge into the water, that threw
up its white ſpray high in the air as it received
them, and returned a ſullen found, which
the echoes of the mountains prolonged.
Under the bridge was ſeen a perſpective of
the valley, with its cataract deſcending
among the rocks, and a cottage on a cliff,
overſhadowed with pines. It appeared,
that they could not be far from ſome ſmall
town. St. Aubert bade the muleteer ſtop,
and then called to the children to enquire
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0247300301:129"/>
if he was near Montigny; but the diſtance,
and the roaring of the waters, would not
ſuffer his voice to be heard; and the crags,
adjoining the bridge, were of ſuch tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
height and ſteepneſs, that to have
climbed either would have been ſcarcely
practicable to a perſon unacquainted with
the aſcent. St. Aubert, therefore, did not
waſte more moments in delay. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to travel long after twilight had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured
the road, which was ſo broken, that,
now thinking it ſafer to walk than to ride,
they all alighted. The moon was riſing, but
her light was yet too feeble to aſſiſt them.
While they ſtepped carefully on, they heard
the veſper-bell of a convent. The twilight
would not permit them to diſtinguiſh any
thing like a building, but the ſounds ſeemed
to come from ſome woods, that overhung
an acclivity to the right. Valancourt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to go in ſearch of this convent. "If
they will not accommodate us with a night's
lodging," ſaid he, "they may certainly
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0247300301:130"/>
inform us how far we are from Montigny,
and direct us towards it." He was bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
forward, without waiting St. Aubert's
reply, when the latter ſtopped him. "I
am very weary," ſaid St. Aubert, "and
wiſh for nothing ſo much as for immediate
reſt. We will all go to the convent; your
good looks would defeat our purpoſe; but
when they ſee mine and Emily's exhauſted
countenances, they will ſcarcely deny us
repoſe."</p>
            <p>As he ſaid this, he took Emily's arm
within his, and, telling Michael to wait a
while in the road with the carriage, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan
to aſcend towards the woods, guided
by the bell of the convent. His ſteps
were feeble, and Valancourt offered him his
arm, which he accepted. The moon now
threw a faint light over their path, and,
ſoon after, enabled them to diſtinguiſh ſome
towers riſing above the tops of the woods.
Still following the note of the bell, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the ſhade of thoſe woods, lighted
only by the moon-beams, that glided down
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0247300301:131"/>
between the leaves, and threw a tremulous
uncertain gleam upon the ſteep track they
were winding. The gloom and the ſilence
that prevailed, except when the bell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
upon the air, together with the wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the ſurrounding ſcene, ſtruck Emily
with a degree of fear, which, however, the
voice and converſation of Valancourt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
repreſſed. When they had been ſome
time aſcending, St. Aubert complained of
wearinſs, and they ſtopped to reſt upon a
little green ſummit, where the trees opened,
and admitted the moon-light. He fat down
upon the turf, between Emily and Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.
The bell had now ceaſed, and the
deep repoſe of the ſcene was undiſturbed
by any found, for the low dull murmur
of ſome diſtant torrents might be ſaid to
ſooth, rather than to interrupt, the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>Before them, extended the valley they
had quitted; its rocks, and woods to the
left, juſt ſilvered by the rays, formed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſt
to the deep ſhadow, that involved the
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0247300301:132"/>
oppoſite cliffs, whoſe fringed ſummits only
were tipped with light; while the diſtant
perſpective of the valley was loſt in the yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
miſt of moon-light. The travellers ſat
for ſome time wrapt in the complacency
which ſuch ſcenes inſpire.</p>
            <p>"Thefe ſcenes," ſaid Valancourt, at length,
"ſoften the heart, like the notes of ſweet
muſic, and inſpire that delicious melancholy
which no perſon, who had felt it once, would
reſign for the gayeſt pleaſures. They waken
our beſt and pureſt feelings, diſpoſing us to
benevolence, pity, and friendſhip. Thoſe
whom I love—I always ſeem to love more
in ſuch an hour as this." His voice trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
and he pauſed.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert was ſilent; Emily perceived a
warm tear fall upon the hand he held; ſhe
knew the object of his thoughts; hers too
had, for ſome time, been occupied by the
remembrance of her mother. He ſeemed
by an effort to rouſe himfelf. "Yes," ſaid
he, with an half-ſupperſſed ſigh, "the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of thoſe we love—of times for ever
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0247300301:133"/>
paſt! in ſuch an hour as this ſteals upon
the mind, like a ſtrain of diſtant muſic in
the ſtillneſs of night;—all tender and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious
as this landſcape, ſleeping in the
mellow moon-light." After the pauſe of
a moment, St. Aubert added, "I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
fancied, that I thought with more
clearneſs, and preciſion, at ſuch an hour than
at any other, and that heart muſt be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in a great degree, that does not ſoften
to its influence. But many ſuch there are."</p>
            <p>Valancourt ſighed.</p>
            <p>"Are there, indeed, many ſuch?" ſaid
Emily.</p>
            <p>"A few years hence, my Emily," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
St. Aubert, "and you may ſmile at
the recollection of that queſtion—if you do
not weep to it. But come, I am ſomewhat
refreſhed, let us proceed."</p>
            <p>Having emerged from the woods, they
few, upon a turfy hillock above, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
of which they were in ſearch. An high
wall, that ſurrounded it, led them to an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
gate, at which they knocked; and the
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0247300301:134"/>
poor monk, who opened it, conduced them
into a ſmall adjoining room, where he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
they would wait while he informed the
ſuperior of their requeſt. In this interval,
ſeveral friars came in ſeparately to look at
them; and at length the firſt monk return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and they followed him to a room, where
the ſuperior was ſitting in an arm chair,
with a large folio volume, printed in black
letter, open on a deſk before him. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
them with courteſy, though he did
not riſe from his feat; and, having aſked
them a few queſtions, grafted their requeſt.
After a ſhort converſation, formal and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
on the part of the ſuperior, they with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
to the apartment where they were to
ſup, and Valancourt, whom one of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
friars civilly deſired to accompany,
went to ſeek Michael and his mules. They
had not deſcended half way down the cliffs,
before they heard the voice of the muleteer
echoing far and wide. Sometimes he called
on St. Aubert, and ſometimes on Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
who having, at length, convinced him
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0247300301:135"/>
that he had nothing to fear either for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
or his maſter; and having diſpoſed of
him, for the night, in a cottage on the ſkirt
of the woods, returned to ſup with his friends,
on ſuch ſober fare as the monks thought it
prudent to ſet before them. While St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
was too much indiſpoſed to ſhare it,
Emily, in her anxiety for her father, forgot
herſelf; and Valancourt, ſilent and thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
yet never inattentive to them, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
particularly ſolicitous to accommodate
and relieve St. Aubert, who often obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
while his daughter was preſſing him to
eat, or adjuſting the pillow ſhe had placed
in the back of his arm-chair, that Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
fixed on her a look of penſive tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
which he was not diſpleaſed to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand.</p>
            <p>They ſeparated at an early hour, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to their reſpective apartments. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
was ſhown to hers by a nun of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
whom ſhe was glad to diſmiſs, for
her heart was melancholy, and her attention
ſo much abſtracted, that converſation with
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0247300301:136"/>
a ſtranger was painful. She thought her
father daily declining, and attributed his
preſent fatigue more to the feeble ſtate of
his frame, than to the difficulty of the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney.
A train of gloomy ideas haunted her
mind, till ſhe fell aſleep.</p>
            <p>In about two hours after, ſhe was awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the chiming of a bell, and then heard
quick ſteps paſs along the gallery, into
which her chamber opened. She was ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
accuſtomed to the manners of a convent,
as to be alarmed by this circumſtance; her
fears, ever alive for her father, ſuggeſted
that he was very ill, and ſhe roſe in haſte
to go to him. Having pauſed, however, to
let the perſons in the gallery paſs before
ſhe opened her door, her thoughts, in the
mean time, recovered from the confuſion
of ſleep, and ſhe underſtood that the bell
was the call of the monks to prayers. It
had now ceaſed, and, all being again ſtill, ſhe
forbore to go to St. Aubert's room. Her
mind was not diſpoſed for immediate ſleep,
and the moon-light, that ſhone into her
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0247300301:137"/>
chamber, invited her to open the caſement,
and look out upon the country.</p>
            <p>It was a ſtill and beautiful night, the ſky
was unobſcured by any cloud, and ſcarce a
leaf of the woods beneath trembled in the
air. As ſhe liſtened, the mid-night hymn
of the monks roſe ſoftly from a chapel,
that ſtood on one of the lower cliffs, an
holy ſtrain, that ſeemed to aſcend through
the ſilence of night to heaven, and her
thoughts aſcended with it. From the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
of his works, her mind aroſe to
the adoration of the Deity, in his goodneſs
and power; wherever ſhe turned her view,
whether on the ſleeping earth, or to the vaſt
regions of ſpace, glowing with worlds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
the reach of human thought, the ſublimity
of God, and the majeſty of his preſence
appeared. Her eyes were filled with tears
of awful love and admiration; and ſhe felt
that pure devotion, ſuperior to all the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions
of human ſyſtem, which lifts the
ſoul above this world, and ſeems to expand
it into a nobler nature; ſuch devotion as
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0247300301:138"/>
can, perhaps, only be experienced, when
the mind, reſcued, for a moment, from the
humbleneſs of earthly conſiderations, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires
to contemplate His power in the ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of His works, and His goodneſs in the
infinity of His bleſſings.</p>

ſhade, and willing to prolong her preſent

            <p>St. AUBERT, ſufficiently reſtored by a
night's repoſe to purſue his journey, ſet out
in the morning, with his family and Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
for Rouſillon, which he hoped to
reach before night-fall. The ſcenes, through
which they now paſſed, were as wild and
romantic, as any they had yet obſerved, with
this difference, that beauty, every now and
then, ſoftened the landſcape into ſmiles.
Little woody receſſes appeared among the
mountains, covered with bright verdure
and flowers; or a paſtoral valley, opened its
graſſy boſom in the ſhade of the cliffs, with
flocks and herds loitering along the banks
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0247300301:140"/>
of a rivulet, that refreſhed it with perpetual
green. St. Aubert could not repent the
having taken this fatiguing road, though
he was this day, alſo, frequently obliged to
alight, to walk along the rugged precipice,
and to climb the ſteep and flinty mountain.
The wonderful ſublimity and variety of the
Proſpects repaid him for all this, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm,
with which they were viewed by
his young companions, heightened his own,
and awakened a remembrance of all the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
emotions of his early days, when
the ſublime charms of nature were firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veiled
to him. He found great pleaſure in
converſing with Valancourt, and in liſtening
to his ingenuous remarks. The fire and
ſimplicity of his manners ſeemed to render
him a characteriſtic figure in the ſcenes
around them; and St. Aubert diſcovered in
his ſentiments the juſtneſs and the dignity
of an elevated mind, unbiaſſed by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
with the world. He perceived, that
his opinions were formed, rather than im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed;
were more the reſult of thought,
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0247300301:141"/>
than of learning. Of the world he ſeemed
to know nothing; for he believed well of
all mankind, and this opinion gave him the
reflected image of his own heart.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert, as he ſometimes lingered
to examine the wild plants in his path, often
looked forward with pleaſure to Emily and
Valancourt, as they ſtrolled on together; he,
with a countenance of animated delight,
pointing to her attention ſome grand ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
of the ſcene; and ſhe, liſtening and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
with a look of tender ſeriouſneſs,
that ſpoke the elevation of her mind. They
appeared like two lovers who had never
ſtrayed beyond theſe their native mountains;
whoſe ſituation had ſecluded them from the
frivolities of common life, whoſe ideas were
ſimple and grand, like the landſcapes among
which they moved, and who knew no other
happineſs, than in the union of pure and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
hearts. St. Aubert ſmiled, and
ſighed at the romantic picture of felicity his
fancy drew; and ſighed again to think, that
nature and ſimplicity were ſo little known
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0247300301:142"/>
to the world, as that their pleaſures were
thought romantic.</p>
            <p>"The world," ſaid he, purſuing this train
of thought, "ridicules a paſſion which it
ſeldom feels; its ſcenes, and its intereſts, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract
the mind, deprave the taſte, corrupt
the heart, and love cannot exiſt in a heart
that has loſt the meek dignity of innocence,
Virtue and taſte are nearly the lame, for
virtue is little more than active taſte, and
the moſt delicate affections of each com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine
in real love. How then are we to look
for love in great cities, where ſelfiſhneſs,
diſſipation, and inſincerity ſupply the place
of tenderneſs, ſimplicity and truth?"</p>
            <p>It was near noon, when the travellers,
having arrived at a piece of ſteep and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
road, alighted to walk. The road
wound up an aſcent, that was clothed with
wood, and, inſtead of following the carriage,
they entered the refreſhing. ſhade. A dewy
coolneſs was diffuſed upon the air, which,
with the bright verdure of turf, that grew
under the trees, the mingled fragrance of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0247300301:143"/>
flowers and of balm, thyme, and lavender,
that enriched it, and the grandeur of the
pines, beech, and cheſnuts, that overſhadow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
them, rendered this amoſt delicious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat.
Sometimes, the thick foliage exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
all view of the country; at others, it ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
ſome partial catches of the diſtant
ſeenery, which gave hints to the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to picture, landſcapes more interesting,
more impreſſive, than any that had been
preſented to the eye. The wanderers often
lingered to indulge in theſe reveries of fancy.</p>
            <p>The pauſes of ſilence, ſuch as had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
interrupted the converſations of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
and Emily, were more frequent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
than ever. Valancourt often dropped
ſuddenly from the moſt animating vivacity
into fits of deep muſing, and there was,
ſometimes, an unaffected melancholy in his
ſmile, which Emily could not avoid under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
for her heart was intereſted in the
ſentiment it ſpoke.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert was refreſhed by the ſhades,
and they continued to ſaunter under them,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0247300301:144"/>
following, as nearly as they could gueſs,
the direction of the road, till they perceived
that they had totally loſt it. They had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
I near the brow of the precipice, allur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the ſcenery it exhibited, while the road
wound far away over the cliff above. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
called loudly to Michael, but heard
no voice, except his own, echoing among
the rocks, and his various efforts to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
the road were equally unſucceſsful.
While they were thus circumſtanced, they
perceived a ſhepherd's cabin, between the
boles of the trees at ſome diſtance, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
bounded on firſt to aſk aſſiſtance.
When he reached it, he ſaw only two little
children, at play, on the turf before the door.
He looked into the hut, but no perſon was
there, and the, eldeſt of the boys told him
that their father was with his ſlocks, and
their mother was gone down into the vale,
but would be back preſently. As he ſtood,
considering what was further to be done, on
a ſudden he heard Michael's voice roaring
forth moſt manfully among the cliffs above,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0247300301:145"/>
till he made their echoes ring. Valancourt
immediately anſwered the call, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to make his way through the thicket
that clothed the ſteeps, following the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection
of the ſound. After much ſtruggle
over brambles and precipices, he reached
Michael, and at length prevailed with him
to be ſilent, and to liſten to him. The road
was at a conſiderable diſtance from the ſpot
where St. Aubert and Emily were; the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
could not eaſily return to the entrance
of the wood, and, ſince it would be very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguing
for St. Aubert to climb the long
and ſteep road to the place where it now
ſtood, Valancourt was anxious to find a
more eaſy aſcent, by the way he had him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
paſſed.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile St. Aubert and Emily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
the cottage, and reſted themſelves
on a ruſtic bench, ſaſtened between two
pines, which overſhadowed it, till Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
whoſe ſteps they had obſerved, ſhould
return.</p>
            <p>The eldeſt of the children deſiſted from
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0247300301:146"/>
his play, and ſtood ſtill to obſerve the
ſtrangers, while the younger continued his
little gambols, and teaſed his brother to join
in them. St. Aubert looked with pleaſure
upon this picture of infantine ſimplicity,
till it brought to his remembrance his own
boys, whom he had loſt about the age of
theſe, and their lamented, mother; and he
ſunk into a thoughtfulneſs, which Emily
obſerving, ſhe immediately began to ſing
one of thoſe ſimple and lively airs he was ſo
fond of, and which ſhe knew how to give
with the moſt captivating ſweetneſs St.
Aubert ſmiled on her through his tears,
took her hand and preſſed it affectionately,
and then tried to diſſipate the melancholy
reflections that lingered in his mind.</p>
            <p>While ſhe ſung, Valancourt approached,
who was unwilling to interrupt her, and
pauſed at a little diſtance to liſten. When
ſhe had concluded, he joined the party, and
told them, that he had found Michael, as
well as a way, by which he thought they
could aſcend the cliff to the carriage. He
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0247300301:147"/>
pointed to the woody ſteeps above, which
St. Aubert ſurveyed with an anxious eye.
He was already wearied by his walk, and
this aſcent was formidable to him. He
thought, however, it would be leſs toilſome
than the long and broken road, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
to attempt it; but Emily, ever
watchful of his eaſe, propoſing that he ſhould
reſt, and dine before they proceeded further,
Valancourt went to the carriage for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhments
depoſited there.</p>
            <p>On his return, he propoſed removing a
little higher up the mountain, to where the
woods opened upon a grand and extenſive
proſpect; and thither they were preparing to
go, when they ſaw a young woman join the
children, and careſs and weep over them.</p>
            <p>The travellers, intereſted by her diſtreſs,
ſtopped to obſerve her. She took the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
of the children in her arms, and, perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the ſtrangers, haſtily dried her tears, and
proceeded to the cottage, St. Aubert, on en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
the occaſion of her ſorrow, learned
that her huſband, who was ſhepherd, and
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0247300301:148"/>
lived here in the ſummer months to watch
over the flocks he led to feed upon theſe
mountains, had loſt, on the preceding
night, his little all. A gang of gipſies,
who had for ſome time infeſted the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood,
had driven away ſeveral of his
matter's ſheep. "Jacques," added the ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd's
wife, "had ſaved a little money, and
had bought a few ſheep with it, and now
they muſt go to his maſter for thoſe that are
ſtolen; and what is worſe than all, his maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
when he comes to know how it is, will
truſt him no longer with the care of his
flocks, for he is a hard man! and then what
is to become of our children!"</p>
            <p>The innocent countenance of the woman,
and the ſimplicity of her manner in relating
her grievance, inclined St. Aubert to believe
her ſtory; and Valancourt, convinced that
it was true, aſked eagerly what was the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of the ſtolen ſheep, on hearing which he
turned away with a look of diſappointment,
St. Aubert put ſome money into her hand,
Emily too gave ſomething from her little
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0247300301:149"/>
purſe, and they walked towards the cliff;
but Valancourt lingered behind, and ſpoke
to the ſhepherd's wife, who was now weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
with gratitude and ſurpriſe. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
how much money was yet wanting
to replace the ſtolen ſheep, and found, that
it was a ſum very little ſhort of all he had
about him. He was perplexed and diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
"This ſum then," ſaid he to himſelf,
"would make this poor family completely
happy—it is in my power to give it—to
make them completely happy! But what
is to become of me?—how ſhall I contrive
to reach home with the little money that
will remain?" For a moment he ſtood,
unwilling to forego the luxury of raiſing a
family from ruin to happineſs, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
the difficulties of purſuing his
journey with ſo ſmall a ſum as would be
left.</p>
            <p>While he was in this ſtate of perplexity,
the ſhepherd himſelf appeared: his children
ran to meet him; he took one of them in
his arms, and, with the other clinging to
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0247300301:150"/>
his coat, came forward with a loitering ſtep.
His forlorn and melancholy look determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Valancourt at once; he threw down all
the money he had, except a very few louis,
and bounded away after St. Aubert and
Emily, who were proceeding ſlowly up the
ſteep. Valancourt had ſeldom felt his heart
ſo light as at this moment; his gay ſpirits
danced with pleaſure; every object around
him appeared more intereſting, or beautiful,
than before. St. Aubert obſerved the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
vivacity of his countenance:
"What has pleaſed you ſo much?" ſaid he.
"O what a lovely day," replied Valancourt,
"how brightly the ſun ſhines, how pure is
this air, what enchanting ſcenery!" "It
is indeed enchanting," ſaid St. Aubert,
whom early experience had taught to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand
the nature of Valancourt's preſent
feelings. "What pity that the wealthy,
who can command ſuch ſunſhine, ſhould
ever paſs their days in gloom—in the cold
ſhade of ſelfiſhneſs! For you, my young
friend, may the ſun always ſhine as bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0247300301:151"/>
as at this moment; may your own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
always give you the ſunſhine of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence
and reaſon united!"</p>
            <p>Valancóurt, highly flattered by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment,
could make no reply but by a ſmile
of gratitude.</p>
            <p>They continued to wind under the woods,
between the graſſy knolls of the mountain, and,
as they reached the ſhady ſummit, which he
had pointed out, the whole party burſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
an exclamation. Behind the ſpot where
they ſtood, the rock roſe perpendicularly in
a maſſy wall to a conſiderable height, and
then branched out into overhanging crags.
Their grey tints were well contraſted by the
bright hues of the plants and wild flowers,
that grew in their fractured ſides, and were
deepened by the gloom of the pines and cedars,
that waved above. The ſteeps below, over
which the eye paſſed abruptly to the valley,
were fringed with thickets of alpine ſhrubs;
and, lower ſtill, appeared the tufted tops of
the cheſnut woods, that clothed their baſe,
among which peeped forth the ſhepherd's
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0247300301:152"/>
cottage, juſt left by the travellers, with its
blueiſh ſmoke curling high in the air. On
every ſide appeared the majeſtic ſummits
of the Pyrenées, ſome exhibiting tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous
crags of marble, whoſe appearance was
changing every inſtant, as the varying lights
fell upon their ſurface; others, ſtill high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
diſplaying only ſnowy points, while
their lower ſteeps were covered almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably
with foreſts of pine, larch, and oak,
that ſtretched down to the vale. This was
one of the narrow vallies, that open from the
Pyrenées into the country of Rouſillon, and
whoſe green paſtures, and cultivated beauty,
form a decided and wonderful contraſt to
the romantic grandeur that environs it.
Through a viſta of the mountains appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the lowlands of Rouſillon, tinted with
the blue haze of diſtance, as they united with
the waters of the Mediterranean; where, on
a promontory, which marked the boundary
of the ſhore, ſtood a lonely beacon, over
which were ſeen circling flights of ſea-fowl.
Beyond, appeared, now and then, a ſtealing
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0247300301:153"/>
ſail, white with the ſun-beam, and whoſe
progreſs was perceivable by its approach to
the light-houſe. Sometimes, too, was ſeen
a ſail ſo diſtant, that it ſerved only to mark
the line of ſeparation between the ſky and
the waves.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide of the valley, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately,
oppoſite to the ſpot where the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers
reſted, a rocky paſs opened toward
Gaſcony. Here no ſign of cultivation ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.
The rocks of granite, that ſcreen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the glen, roſe abruptly from their baſe,
and ſtretched their barren points to the
clouds, unvaried with woods, and uncheered
even by a hunter's cabin. Sometimes, indeed,
a gigantic larch threw its long ſhade over the
precipice, and here and there a cliff rear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on its brow a monumental croſs, to tell
the traveller the fate of him who had ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
thither before. This ſpot ſeemed the very
haunt of banditti; and Emily, as ſhe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
down upon it, almoſt expected to ſee them
ſtealing out from ſome hollow cave to look
for their prey. Soon after an object not leſs
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0247300301:154"/>
terrific ſtruck her,—a gibbet ſtanding on a
point of rock near the entrance of the paſs,
and immediately over one of the croſſes ſhe
had before obſerved. Theſe were hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphics
that told a plain arid dreadful
ſtory. She forbore to point it out to St.
Aubert, but it threw a gloom over her ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
and made her anxious to haſten for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
that they might with certainty
reach Rouſillon before night-fall. It was
neceſſary, however, that St. Aubert ſhould
take ſome refreſhment, and, ſeating them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
on the ſhort dry turf, they opened the
baſket of proviſions, while</p>
            <q>
               <l>—by breezy murmurs cool'd,</l>
               <l>Broad o'er <hi>their</hi> heads the verdant cedars wave,</l>
               <l>And high palmetos lift their graceful ſhade.</l>
               <l>—<hi>they</hi> draw</l>
               <l>Ethereal ſoul, there drink reviving gales</l>
               <l>Profuſely breathing from the piney groves,</l>
               <l>And vales of fragrance; there at diſtance hear</l>
               <l>The roaring floods, and cataracts<note n="*" place="bottom">THOMPSON.</note>.</l>
            </q>
            <p>St. Aubert was revived by reſt, and by
the ſerene air of this ſummit; and Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0247300301:155"/>
was ſo charmed with all around, and
with the converſation of his companions,
that he ſeemed to have forgotten he had
any further to go. Having concluded their
ſimple repaſt, they gave a long farewell look
to the ſcene, and again began to aſcend.
St. Aubert rejoiced when he reached the
carriage, which Emily entered with him;
but Valancourt, willing to take a more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive
view of the enchanting country, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
which they were about to deſcend, than
he could do from a carriage, looſened his
dogs, and once more bounded with them
along the banks of the road. He often
quitted it for points that promiſed a wider
proſpect, and the ſlow pace, at which the
mules travelled, allowed him to overtake
them with eaſe. Whenever a ſcene of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
magnificence appeared, he haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to inform St. Aubert, who, though he
was too much tired to walk himſelf, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
made the chaiſe wait, while Emily
went to the neighbouring cliff.</p>
            <p>It was evening when they deſcended the
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0247300301:156"/>
lower alps, that bind Rouſillon, and form a
majeſtic barrier round that charming coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
leaving it open only on the eaſt to the
Mediterranean. The gay tints of cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
once more beautified the landſcape;
for the lowlands were coloured with the
richeſt hues, which a luxuriant climate, and
an induſtrious people can awaken into life.
Groves of orange and lemon perfumed the
air, their ripe fruit glowing among the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liage;
while, ſloping to the plains, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
vineyards ſpread their treaſures. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
theſe, woods and paſtures, and min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
towns and hamlets ſtretched towards
the ſea, on whoſe bright ſurface gleamed
many a diſtant ſail; while, over the whole
ſcene, was diffuſed the purple glow of even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
This landſcape with the ſurrounding
alps did, indeed, preſent a perfect picture
of the lovely and the ſublime, of "beauty
ſleeping in the lap of horror."</p>
            <p>The travellers, having reached the plains,
proceeded, between hedges of flowering
myrtle and pomegranate, to the town of
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0247300301:157"/>
Arles, where they purpoſed to reſt for the
night. They met with ſimple, but neat ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation,
and would have paſſed an
happy evening, after the toils and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights
of this day, had not the approaching
ſeparation thrown a gloom over their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.
It was St. Aubert's plan to proceed,
on the morrow, to the borders of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean,
and travel along its ſhores
into Languedoc; and Valancourt, ſince he
was now nearly recovered, and had no longer
a pretence for continuing with his new
friends, reſolved to leave them here. St.
Aubert, who was much pleaſed with him,
invited him to go further, but did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the invitation, and Valancourt had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
enough to forego the temptation
of accepting it, that he might prove him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
not unworthy of the favour. On the
following morning, therefore, they were to
part, St. Aubert to purſue his way to Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,
and Valancourt to explore new
ſcenes among the mountains, on his return
home. During this evening he was often
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0247300301:158"/>
ſilent and thoughtful; St. Aubert's manner
towards him was affectionate, though grave,
and Emily was ſerious, though ſhe made
frequent efforts to appear cheerful. After
one of the moſt melancholy evenings they
had yet paſſed together, they ſeparated for
the night.</p>

            <p>IN the morning, Valancourt breakfaſted
with St. Aubert and Emily, neither of
whom ſeemed much refreſhed by ſleep.
The languor of illneſs ſtill hung over St.
Aubert, and to Emily's fears his diſorder
appeared to be increaſing faſt upon him.
She watched his looks with anxious affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and their expreſſion was always faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
reflected in her own.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0247300301:160"/>
At the commencement of their acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
Valancourt had made known his
name and family. St. Aubert was not a
ſtranger to either, for the family eſtates,
which were now in the poſſeſſion of an elder
brother of Valancourt, were little more than
twenty miles diſtant from La Vallée, and
he had ſometimes met the elder Valancourt
on viſits in the neighbourhood. This
knowledge had made him more willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
his preſent companion; for, though his
countenance and manners would have won
him the acquaintance of St. Aubert, who
was very apt to truſt to the intelligence of
his own eyes, with reſpect to countenances,
he would not have accepted theſe, as ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
introductions to that of his daughter.</p>
            <p>The breakfaſt was almoſt as ſilent as the
ſupper of the preceding night; but their
muſing was at length interrupted by the
ſound of the carriage-wheels, which were to
bear away St. Aubert and Emily. Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
ſtarted from his chair, and went to the
window; it was indeed the carriage, and
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0247300301:161"/>
he returned to, his ſeat without ſpeaking.
The moment was now come when they
muſt part. St. Aubert told Valancourt,
that he hoped he would never paſs La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lée
without favouring him with a viſit;
and Valancourt, eagerly thanking him, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
him that he never would; as he ſaid
which he looked timidly at Emily, who
tried to ſmile away the ſeriouſneſs of her
ſpirits. They paſſed a few minutes in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting
converſation, and St. Aubert then
led the way to the carriage, Emily and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
following in ſilence. The latter
lingered at the door ſeveral minutes after
they were ſeated, and none of the party ſeemed
to have courage enough to ſay—Farewell. At
length, St. Aubert pronounced the melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
word, which Emily paſſed to Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
who returned it, with a dejected
ſmile, and the carriage drove on.</p>
            <p>The travellers remained, for ſome time,
in a ſtate of tranquil penſiveneſs, which is
not unpleaſing. St. Aubert interrupted it
by obſerving, "This is a very promiſing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0247300301:162"/>
young man; it is many years ſince I have
been ſo much pleaſed with any perſon, on
ſo ſhort an acquaintance. He brings back
to my memory the days of my youth, when
every ſcene was new and delightful!" St.
Aubert ſighed, and ſunk again into a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie;
and, as Emily looked back upon the
road they had paſſed, Valancourt was ſeen,
at the door of the little inn, following them
with his eyes. He perceived her, and
waved his hand; and ſhe returned the
adieu, till the winding road ſhut her from,
his ſight.</p>
            <p>"I remember when I was about his age,"
reſumed St. Aubert, "and I thought, and
felt exactly as he does. The world was
opening upon me then, now—it is cloſing."</p>
            <p>"My dear ſir, do not think ſo gloomily,"
ſaid Emily in a trembling voice, "I hope
you have many, many years to live—for
your own ſake—for <hi>my</hi> ſake."</p>
            <p>"Ah, my Emily!" replied St. Aubert,
"for thy ſake! Well—I hope it is ſo."
He wiped away a tear, that was ſtealing
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0247300301:163"/>
down his cheek, threw a ſmile upon his
countenance, and ſaid in a cheering voice,
"There is ſomething in the ardour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuouſneſs
of youth, which is particularly
pleaſing to the contemplation of an old
man, if his feelings have not been entirely
corroded by the world. It is cheering and
reviving, like the view of ſpring to a ſick
perſon; his mind catches ſomewhat of the
ſpirit of the ſeaſon, and his eyes are lighted
up with a tranſient ſunſhine. Valancourt
is this ſpring to me."</p>
            <p>Emily, who preſſed her father's hand af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately,
had never before liſtened with
ſo much pleaſure to the praiſes he beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;
no, not even when he had beſtowed
them on herſelf.</p>
            <p>They travelled on, among vineyards,
woods, and paſtures, delighted with the
romantic beauty of the landſcape, which
was bounded, on one ſide, by the grandeur
of the Pyrenées, and, on the other, by the
ocean; and, ſoon after noon, they reached,
the town of Colioure, ſituated on the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean.
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0247300301:164"/>
Here they dined, and reſted
till towards the cool of day, when they
purſued their way along the ſhores—thoſe
enchanting ſhores! which extend to Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc.
Emily gazed with enthuſiaſm on
the vaſtneſs of the ſea, its ſurface varying,
as the lights and ſhadows fell, and on its
woody banks, mellowed with autumnal
tints.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert was impatient to reach Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pignan,
where he expected letters from M.
Queſnel; and it was the expectation of
theſe letters, that had induced him to leave
Colioure, for his feeble frame had required
immediate reſt. After travelling a few
miles, he fell aſleep; and Emily, who had
put two or three books into the carriage, on
leaving La Vallée, had now the leiſure
for looking into them. She ſought for one,
in which Valancourt had been reading the
day before, and hoped for the pleaſure of
re-tracing a page, over which the eyes of a
beloved friend had lately paſſed, of dwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the paſſages, which he had admired,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0247300301:165"/>
and of permitting them to ſpeak to her in
the language of his own mind, and to bring
himſelf to her preſence. On ſearching for
the book, ſhe could find it no where, but in
its ſtead perceived a volume of Petrarch's
poems, that had belonged to Valancourt,
whoſe name was written in it, and from
which he had frequently read paſſages to
her, with all the pathetic expreſſion, that
characterized the feelings of the author.
She heſitated in believing, what would have
been ſufficiently apparent to almoſt any
other perſon, that he had purpoſely left,
this book, inſtead of the one ſhe had loſt,
and that love had prompted the exchange;
but, having opened it with impatient plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,
and obſerved the lines of his pencil
drawn along the various paſſages he had
read aloud, and under others more deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
of delicate tenderneſs than he had dared
to truſt his voice with, the conviction came,
at length, to her mind. For ſome moments
ſhe was conſcious only of being beloved;
then, a recollection of all the variations of
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0247300301:166"/>
tone and countenance, with which he had
recited theſe ſonnets, and of the ſoul, which
ſpoke in their expreeſſion, preſſed to her me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory,
and ſhe wept over the memorial of
his affection.</p>
            <p>They arrived at Perpignan ſoon after ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet,
where St. Aubert found, as he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
letters from M. Queſnel, the contents
of which ſo evidently and grievouſly affected
him, that Emily was alarmed, and preſſed
him, as far as her delicacy would permit, to
diſcloſe the occaſion of his concern; but he
anſwered her only by tears, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
began to talk on other topics. Emily,
though ſhe forbore to preſs the one moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting
to her, was greatly affected by her
father's manner, and paſſed a night of ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
ſolicitude.</p>
            <p>In the morning they purſued their jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
along the coaſt towards Leucate, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
town on the Mediterranean, ſituated
on the borders of Languedoc and Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillon.
On the way, Emily renewed the
ſubject of the preceding night, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0247300301:167"/>
ſo deeply affected by St. Aubert's
ſilence and dejection, that he relaxed from
his reſerve. "I was unwilling, my dear
Emily," ſaid he, "to throw a cloud over
the pleaſure you receive from theſe ſcenes,
and meant, therefore, to conceal, for the
preſent, ſome circumſtances, with which,
however, you muſt at length have been
made acquainted. But your anxiety has
defeated my purpoſe; you ſuffer as much
from this, perhaps, as you will do from a
knowledge of the facts I have to relate.
M. Queſnel's viſit proved an unhappy one
to me; he came to tell me a part of the
news he has now confirmed. You may
have heard me mention an M. Motteville,
of Paris, but you did not know that the
chief of my perſonal property was inveſted
in his hands. I had great confidence in
him, and I am yet willing to believe, that
he is not wholly unworthy of my eſteem.
A variety of circumſtances have concurred
to ruin him, and—I am ruined with him."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="158" facs="tcp:0247300301:168"/>
St. Aubert pauſed, to conceal his emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>"The letters I have juſt received from
M. Queſnel," reſumed he, ſtruggling to
ſpeak with firmneſs "encloſed others
from Motteville, which confirmed all I
dreaded."</p>
            <p>"Muſt we then quit La Vallée?" ſaid
Emily, after a long pauſe of ſilence. "That
is yet uncertain," replied St. Aubert, "it
will depend upon the compromiſe Motte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville
is able to make with his creditors.
My income, you know, was never large,
and now it will be reduced to little indeed!
It is for you, Emily, for you, my child,
that I am moſt afflicted." His laſt words
faltered; Emily ſmiled tenderly upon him
through her tears, and then, endeavouring
to overcome her emotion, "My dear fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,"
ſaid ſhe, "do not grieve for me, or
for yourſelf; we may yet be happy;—if
La Vallée remains for us, we muſt be
happy. We will retain only one ſervant,
and you ſhall ſcarcely perceive the change
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0247300301:169"/>
in your income. Be comforted, my dear
ſir; we ſhall not-feel the want of thoſe
luxuries, which others value ſo highly,
ſince we never had a taſte for them; and
poverty cannot deprive us of many conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.
It cannot rob us of the affection
we have for each other, or degrade us in
our own opinion, or in that of any perſon,
whoſe opinion we ought to value."</p>
            <p>St. Aubert concealed his face with his
handkerchief, and was unable to ſpeak;
but Emily continued to urge to her father
the truths, which himſelf had impreſſed
upon her mind.</p>
            <p>"Beſides, my dear ſir, poverty cannot
deprive us of intellectual delights. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
deprive you of the comfort of affording
me examples of fortitude and benevolence;
nor me of the delight of conſoling a beloved
parent. It cannot deaden our taſte for the
grand, and the beautiful, or deny us the
means of indulging it; for the ſcenes of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture—thoſe
ſublime ſpectacles, ſo infinitely
ſuperior to all artificial luxuries! are open
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0247300301:170"/>
for the enjoyment of the poor, as well as of
the rich. Of what, then, have we to complain,
ſo long as we are not in want of neceſſaries?
Pleaſures, ſuch as wealth cannot buy, will
ſtill be ours. We retain, then, the ſublime
luxuries of nature, and loſe only the frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
ones of art."</p>
            <p>St. Aubert could not reply: he caught
Emily to his boſom, their tears flowed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether,
but—they were not tears of ſorrow.
After this language of the heart, all other
would have been feeble, and they remained
ſilent for ſome time. Then, St. Aubert
converſed as before; for, if his mind had
not recovered its natural tranquillity, it at
leaſt aſſumed the appearance of it.</p>
            <p>They reached the romantic town of Leu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
early in the day, but St. Aubert was
weary, and they determined to paſs the
night there. In the evening, he exerted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
ſo far as to walk with his daughter to
view the environs that overlook the lake of
Leucate, the Mediterranean, part of Rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillon,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0247300301:171"/>
with the Pyrenées, and a wide extent
of the luxuriant province of Languedoc,
now bluſhing with the ripened vintage,
which the peaſants were beginning to ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
St. Aubert and Emily ſaw the buſy
groups, caught the joyous ſong, that was
waſted on the breeze, and anticipated, with
apparent pleaſure, their next day's journey
over this gay region. He deſigned, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
ſtill to wind along the ſea-ſhore. To
return home immediately was partly his
wiſh, but from this he was with-held by a
deſire to lengthen the pleaſure, which the
journey gave his daughter, and to try the
effect of the ſea air on his own diſorder.</p>
            <p>On the following day, therefore, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commenced
their journey through Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc,
winding the ſhores of the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean;
the Pyrenées ſtill forming the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent
back-ground of their proſpects,
while on their right was the ocean, and, on
their left, wide extended plains melting
into the blue horizon. St. Aubert was
pleaſed, and converſed much with Emily,
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0247300301:172"/>
yet his cheerfulneſs was ſometimes artificial,
and ſometimes a ſhade of melancholy would
ſteal upon his countenance, and betray him.
This was ſoon chaſed away by Emily's
ſmile, who ſmiled, however, with an aching
heart, for ſhe ſaw that his misfortunes preyed
upon his mind, and upon his enfeebled
frame.</p>
            <p>It was evening when they reached a ſmall
village of Upper Languedoc, where they
meant to paſſ the night, but the place could
not afford them beds; for here, too, it was
the time of the vintage, and they were
obliged to proceed to the next poſt. The
languor of illneſs and of fatigue, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
upon St. Aubert, required imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
repoſe, and the evening was now far
advanced; but from neceſſity there was no
appeal, and he ordered Michael to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</p>
            <p>The rich plains of Languedoc, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
all the glories of the vintage, with
the gaieties of a French feſtival, no longer
awakened St. Aubert to pleaſure, whoſe
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0247300301:173"/>
condition formed a mournful contraſt to the
hilarity and youthful beauty which ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
him. As his languid eyes moved
over the ſcene, he conſidered, that they
would ſoon, perhaps, be cloſed for ever on
this world. "Thoſe diſtant and ſublime
mountains," ſaid he ſecretly, as he gazed
on a chain of the Pyrenées that ſtretched
towards the weſt, "theſe luxuriant plains,
this blue vault, the cheerful light of day,
will be ſhut from my eyes! The ſong
of the peaſant, the cheering voice of man—will
no longer ſound for me!"</p>
            <p>The intelligent eyes of Emily ſeemed to
read what paſſed in the mind of her father,
and ſhe fixed them on his face, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of ſuch tender pity, as recalled
his thoughts from every deſultory object of
regret, and he remembered only, that he
muſt leave his daughter without protection.
This reflection changed regret to agony;
he ſighed deeply, and remained ſilent, while
ſhe ſeemed to underſtand that ſigh, for ſhe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0247300301:174"/>
preſſed his hand affectionately, and then
turned to the window to conceal her tears.
The ſun now threw a laſt yellow gleam on the
waves of the Mediterranean, and the gloom
of twilight ſpread faſt over the ſcene, till
only a melancholy ray appeared on the
weſtern horizon, marking the point where
the ſun had ſet amid the vapours of an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumnal
evening. A cool breeze now came
from the ſnore, and Emily let down the
glaſs; but the air, which was refreſhing
to health, was as chilling to ſickneſs, and
St. Aubert deſired, that the window might
be drawn up. Increaſing illneſs made him
now more anxious than ever to finiſh the
day's journey, and he ſtopped the muleteer
to enquire how far they had yet to go to the
next poſt. He replied, Nine miles. "I
feel I am unable to proceed much further,"
ſaid St. Aubert; "enquire, as you go, if
there is any houſe on the road that would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate
us for the night." He ſunk
back in the carriage, and Michael, crack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
his whip in the air, ſet off, and continued
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0247300301:175"/>
on the full gallop, till St. Aubert, almoſt
fainting, called to him to ſtop. Emily looked
anxiouſly from the window, and ſaw a pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
walking at ſome little diſtance on the
road, for whom they waited, till he came
up, when he was aſked, if there was any
houſe in the neighbourhood that accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated
travellers. He replied, that he knew
of none. "There is a chateau, indeed,
among thoſe woods on the right," added
he, "but I believe it receives nobody, and
I cannot ſhew you the way, for I am almoſt
a ſtranger here." St. Aubert was going
to aſk him ſome further queſtion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the chateau, but the man abruptly paſſed
on. After ſome conſideration, he ordered
Michael to proceed ſlowly to the woods.
Every moment now deepened the twilight,
and increaſed the difficulty of finding the
road. Another peaſant ſoon after paſſed.
"Which is the way to the chateau in the
woods?" cried Michael.</p>
            <p>"The chateau in the woods!" exclaimed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0247300301:176"/>
the peaſant, "Do you mean that, with the
turret, yonder?"</p>
            <p>"I don't know as for the turret, as you
call it," ſaid Michael, "I mean that white
piece of a building, that we ſee at a diſtance
there, among the trees."</p>
            <p>"Yes, that is the turret; why, who are
you, that you are going thither?" ſaid the
man with ſurpriſe.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert, on hearing this odd queſtion,
and obſerving the peculiar tone in which it
was delivered, looked out from the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.
"We are travellers," ſaid he, "who
are in ſearch of a houſe of accommodation
for the night; is there any hereabout?"</p>
            <p>"None, Monſieur, unleſs you have a
mind to try your luck yonder," replied the
peaſant, pointing to the woods, "but I
would not adviſe you to go there."</p>
            <p>"To whom does the chateau belong?"</p>
            <p>"I ſcarcely know myſelf, Monſieur."</p>
            <p>"It is uninhabited, then." "No, not
uninhabited; the ſteward and houſekeeper
are there, I believe."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:0247300301:177"/>
On hearing this, St. Aubert determined
to proceed to the chateau, and riſque the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal
of being accommodated for the night;
he therefore deſired the countryman would
ſhew Michael the way, and bade him expert
reward for his trouble. The man was for
a moment ſilent, and then ſaid, that he was
going on other buſineſs, but that the road
could not be miſſed, if they went up an
avenue to the right, to which he pointed.
St. Aubert was going to ſpeak, but the
peaſant wiſhed him good night, and walked
on.</p>
            <p>The carriage now moved towards the
avenue, which was guarded by a gate, and
Michael having diſmounted to open it,
they entered between rows of antient oak
and cheſnut, whoſe intermingled branches
formed a lofty arch above. There was
ſomething ſo gloomy and deſolate in the
appearance of this avenue, and its lonely
ſilence, that Emily almoſt ſhuddered as ſhe
paſſed along; and, recollecting the manner
in which the peaſant had mentioned the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0247300301:178"/>
chateau, ſhe gave a myſterious meaning to
his words, ſuch as ſhe had not ſuſpected
when he uttered them. Theſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
however, ſhe tried to check, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
that they were probably the effect of
a melancholy imagination, which her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
ſituation, and a conſederation of her
own circumſtances, had made ſenſible to
every impreſſion.</p>
            <p>They paſſed ſlowly on, for they were now
almoſt in darkneſs, which, together with the
unevenneſs of the ground, and the frequent
roots of old trees, that ſhot up above the
ſoil, made it neceſſary to proceed with cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
On a ſudden Michael ſtopped the
carriage; and, as St. Aubert looked from
the window to enquire the cauſe, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a figure at ſome diſtance moving up
the avenue. The duſk would not permit
him to diſtinguiſh what it was, but he bade
Michael go on.</p>
            <p>"This ſeems a ſtrange wild place," ſaid
Michael; "there is no houſe hereabout,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0247300301:179"/>
don't your honour think we had better turn
back?"</p>
            <p>"Go a little further, and if we ſee no
houſe then, we will return to the road,"
replied St. Aubert.</p>
            <p>Michael proceeded with reluctance,
and the extreme ſlowneſs of his pace made
St. Aubert look again from the window to
haſten him, when again he ſaw the ſame
figure. He was ſomewhat ſtartled: proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
the gloomineſs of the ſpot made him
more liable to alarm than uſual; however
this might be, he now ſtopped Michael, and
bade him call to the perſon in the avenue.</p>
            <p>"Pleaſe your honour, he may be a rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,"
ſaid Michael. "It does not pleaſe
me," replied St. Aubert, who could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear
ſmiling at the ſimplicity of his phraſe,
"and we will, therefore, return to the road,
for I ſee no probability of meeting here
with what we ſeek."</p>
            <p>Michael turned about immediately, and
was retracing his way with alacrity, when a
voice was heard from among the trees on
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0247300301:180"/>
the left. It was not the voice of command,
or diſtreſs, but a deep hollow tone, which
ſeemed to be ſcarcely human. The man
whipped his mules till they went as faſt as
poſſible, regardleſs of the darkneſs, the
broken ground, and the necks of the whole
party, nor once ſtopped till he reached the
gate, which opened from the avenue into
the high-road, where he went into a more
moderate pace.</p>
            <p>"I am very ill," ſaid St. Aubert, taking
his daughter's hand. "You are worſe,
then, ſir!" ſaid Emily, extremely alarmed
by his manner, "you are worſe, and here is
no aſſiſtance. Good God! what is to be
done!" He leaned his head on her
ſhoulder, while ſhe endeavoured to ſupport
him with her arm, and Michael was again
ordered to ſtop. When the rattling of the
wheels had ceaſed, muſic was heard on the
air; it was to Emily the voice of Hope.
"Oh! we are near ſome human habitation!"
ſaid ſhe, "help may ſoon be had."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0247300301:181"/>
She liſtened anxiouſly; the ſounds were
diſtant, and ſeemed to come from a remote
part of the woods that bordered the road;
and, as ſhe looked towards the ſpot whence
they iſſued, ſhe perceived in the faint
moon-light ſomething like a chateau. It
was difficult, however, to reach this; St.
Aubert was now too ill to bear the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the carriage; Michael could not
quit his mules; and Emily, who ſtill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
her father, feared to leave him, and
alſo feared to venture alone to ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
ſhe knew not whither, or to whom.
Something, however, it was neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine
upon immediately; St. Aubert,
therefore, told Michael to proceed ſlowly;
but they, had not gone far, when he fainted,
and the carriage was again ſtopped. He
lay quite ſenſeleſs.—"My dear, dear fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,"
cried Emily in great agony, and who
began to fear that he was dying, "ſpeak,
if it is only one word to let me hear the
ſound of your voice!" But no voice ſpoke
in reply. In an agony of terror ſhe bade
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0247300301:182"/>
Michael bring water from the rivulet, that
flowed along the road; and, having received
ſome in the man's hat, with trembling hands
ſhe ſprinkled it over her father's face, which,
as the moon's rays now fell upon it, ſeemed
to bear the impreſſion of death. Every emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſelfiſh fear now gave way to a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
influence, and, committing St. Aubert to
the care of Michael, who refuſed to go far
from his mules, ſhe ſtepped from the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
in ſearch of the chateau ſhe had ſeen
at a diſtance. It was a ſtill moon-light
night, and the muſic, which yet ſounded on
the air, directed her ſteps from the high
road, up a ſhadowy lane, that led to the
woods. Her mind was for ſome time ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
occupied by anxiety and terror for
her father, that ſhe felt none for herſelf, till
the deepening gloom of the overhanging fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liage,
which now wholly excluded the moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
and the wildneſs of the place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called
her to a ſenſe of her adventurous
ſituation. The muſic had ceaſed, and ſhe
had no guide but chance. For a moment
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0247300301:183"/>
ſhe pauſed in terrified perplexity, till a ſenſe
of her father's condition again overcoming
every consideration for herſelf, ſhe proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
The lane terminated in the woods, but
ſhe looked round in vain for a houſe, or a
human being, and as vainly liſtened for a
ſound to guide her. She hurried on, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
not knowing whither, avoiding the
receſſes of the woods, and endeavouring to
keep along their margin, till a rude kind of
avenue, which opened upon a moon-light
ſpot, arreſted her attention. The wildneſs
of this avenue brought to her recollection
the one leading to the turreted chateau, and
ſhe was inclined to believe, that this was a
part of the ſame domain, and probably led to
the ſame point. While ſhe heſitated, whether
to follow it or not, a ſound of many voices in
loud merriment burſt upon her ear. It ſeemed
not the laugh of cheerfulneſs, but of riot,
and ſhe ſtood appalled. While ſhe pauſed,
ſhe heard a diſtant voice, calling from the
way ſhe had come, and, not doubting but
it was that of Michael, her firſt impulſe
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0247300301:184"/>
was to haſten back; but a ſecond thought
changed her purpoſe; ſhe believed that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
leſs than the laſt extremity could have
prevailed with Michael to quit his mules, and
fearing that her father was now dying, ſhe
ruſhed forward, with a feeble hope of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
aſſiſtance from the people in the
woods. Her heart beat with fearful expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as ſhe drew near the ſpot whence the
voices iſſued, and ſhe often ſtartled when
her ſteps diſturbed the fallen leaves. The
ſounds led her towards the moon-light glade
ſhe had before noticed; at a little diſtance
from which ſhe ſtopped, and ſaw, between
the boles of the trees, a ſmall circular level
of green turf, ſurrounded by the woods,
on which appeared a group of figures.
On drawing nearer, ſhe diſtinguiſhed theſe,
by their dreſs, to be peaſants, and perceived
ſeveral cottages ſcattered round the edge of
the woods, which waved loftily over this
ſpot. While ſhe gazed, and endeavoured
to overcome the apprehenſions that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
her ſteps, ſeveral peaſant girls came
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0247300301:185"/>
out of a cottage; muſic inſtantly ſtruck up,
and the dance began. It was the joyous
muſic of the vintage! the ſame ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
heard upon the air. Her heart, occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
with terror for her father, could not
feel the contraſt, which this gay ſcene offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to her own diſtreſs; ſhe ſtepped haſtily
forward towards a group of elder peaſants,
who were ſeated at the door of a cottage,
and, having explained her ſituation, entreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
their aſſiſtance. Several of them roſe
with alacrity, and, offering any ſervice in
their power, followed Emily, who ſeemed
to move on the wind, as faſt as they could
towards the road.</p>
            <p>When ſhe reached the carriage, ſhe found
St. Aubert reſtored to animation. On the
recovery of his ſenſes, having heard from
Michael whither his daughter was gone,
anxiety for her overcame every regard for
himſelf, and he had ſent him in ſearch of
her. He was, however, ſtill languid, and,
perceiving himſelf unable to travel much
further, he renewed his enquiries for an
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0247300301:186"/>
inn, and concerning the chateau in the
woods. "The chateau cannot accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date
you, ſir," ſaid a venerable peaſant who
had followed Emily from the woods, "it is
ſcarcely inhabited; but, if you will do me
the honour to viſit my cottage, you ſhall
be welcome to the beſt bed it affords."</p>
            <p>St. Aubert was himſelf a Frenchman;
he, therefore, was not ſurpriſed at French
courteſy; but, ill as he was, he felt the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue
of the offer enhanced by the manner
which accompanied it. He had too much
delicacy to apologize, or to appear to heſitate
about availing himſelf of the peaſant's hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality,
but immediately accepted it with
the ſame frankneſs with which it was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
            <p>The carriage again moved ſlowly on;
Michael following the peaſants up the lane,
which Emily had juſt quitted, till they came
to the moon light glade. St. Aubert's ſpirits
were ſo far reſtored by the courteſy of his
hoſt, and the near proſpect of repoſe, that
he looked with a ſweet complacency upon
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0247300301:187"/>
the moon-light ſcene, ſurrounded by the
ſhadowy woods, through which, here and
there, an opening admitted the ſtreaming
ſplendour, diſcovering a cottage, or a ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
rivulet. He liſtened, with no painful
emotion, to the merry notes of the guitar
and tamborine; and, though tears came
to his eyes, when he ſaw the <hi>debonnaire</hi>
dance of the peaſants, they were not merely
tears of mournful regret. With Emily it
was otherwiſe; immediate terror for her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had now ſubſided into a gentle melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
which every note of joy, by awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
compariſon, ſerved to heighten.</p>
            <p>The dance ceaſed on the approach of the
carriage, which was a phenomenon in theſe
ſequeſtered woods, and the peaſantry flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
round it with eager curioſity. On learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that it brought a ſick ſtranger, ſeveral
girls ran acroſs the turf, and returned with
wine and baſkets of grapes, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
to the travellers, each with kind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
preſſing for a preference. At length,
the carriage ſtopped at a neat cottage, and
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0247300301:188"/>
his venerable conductor, having aſſiſled St.
Aubert to alight, led him and Emily to
a ſmall inner room, illumined only by
moon-beams, which the open caſement ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.
St. Aubert, rejoicing in reſt, ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
himſelf in an arm-chair, and his ſenſes
were refreſhed by the cool and balmy air,
that lightly waved the embowering honey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuckles,
and wafted their ſweet breath into
the apartment. His hoſt, who was called
La Voiſin, quitted the room, but ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
with fruits, cream, and all the paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
luxury his cottage afforded; having ſet
down which, with a ſmile of unfeigned
welcome, he retired behind the chair of his
gueſt. St. Aubert inſiſted on his taking
a ſeat at the table, and, when the fruit
had allayed the fever of his palate, and he
found himſelf ſomewhat revived, he began
to converſe with his hoſt, who communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
ſeveral particulars concerning himſelf
and his family, which were intereſting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were ſpoken from the heart, and
delineated a picture of the ſweet courteſies
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0247300301:189"/>
of family kindneſs. Emily ſat by her father,
holding his hand, and, while ſhe liſtened to
the old man, her heart ſwelled with the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate
ſympathy he deſcribed, and her
tears fell to the mournful conſideration, that
death would probably ſoon deprive her of
the deareſt bleſſing ſhe then poſſeſſed. The
ſoft moon-light of an autumnal evening,
and the diſtant muſic, which now ſounded
a plaintive ſtrain, aided the melancholy of
her mind. The old man continued to talk
of his family, and St. Aubert remained
ſilent. "I have only one daughter living,"
ſaid La Voiſin, "but ſhe is happily mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
and is every thing to me. When I
loſt my wife," he added with a ſigh, "I
came to live with Agnes, and her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
ſhe has ſeveral children, who are all
dancing on the green yonder, as merry as
graſshoppers—and long may they be ſo!
I hope to die among them, monſieur. I
am old now, and cannot expect to live
long, but there is ſome comfort in dying
ſurrounded by one's children."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0247300301:190"/>
"My good friend," ſaid St. Aubert,
while his voice trembled, "I hope you will
long live ſurrounded by them."</p>
            <p>"Ah, ſir! at my age I muſt not expect
that!" replied the old man, and he pauſed:
"I can ſcarcely wiſh it," he reſumed, "for
I truſt that whenever I die I ſhall go to
heaven, where my poor wife is gone before
me. I can ſometimes almoſt fancy I ſee her
of a ſtill moon-light night, walking among
theſe ſhades ſhe loved ſo well. Do you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,
monſieur, that we ſhall be permitted
to reviſit the earth, after we have quitted
the body?"</p>
            <p>Emily could no longer ſtifle the anguiſh
of her heart; her tears fell faſt upon her
father's hand, which ſhe yet held. He
made an effort to ſpeak, and at length ſaid
in a low voice, "I hope we ſhall be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to look down on thoſe we have left
on the earth, but I can only hope it. Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity
is much veiled from our eyes, and
faith and hope are our only guides concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it. We are not enjoined to believe, that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0247300301:191"/>
diſembodied ſpirits watch over the friends
they have loved, but we may innocently
hope it. It is a hope which I will never
reſign," continued he, while he wiped the
tears from his daughter's eyes, "it will ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
the bitter moments of death!" Tears
fell ſlowly on his cheeks; La Voiſin wept
too, and there was a pauſe of ſilence. Then,
La Voiſin, renewing the ſubject, ſaid, "But
you believe, ſir, that we ſhall meet in another
world the relations we have loved in this; I
muſt believe this." "Then do believe it,"
replied St. Aubert, "ſevere, indeed, would
be the pangs of ſeparation, if we believed it
to be eternal. Look up, my dear Emily,
we ſhall meet again!" He lifted his eyes
towards heaven, and a gleam of moon-light,
which fell upon his countenance, diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
peace and reſignation, ſtealing on the
lines of ſorrow.</p>
            <p>La Voiſin felt that he had purſued the
ſubject too far, and he dropped it, ſaying,
"We are in darkneſs, I forgot to bring a
light"</p>
            <p>"No," ſaid St. Aubert, "this is a light
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0247300301:192"/>
I love. Sit down, my good friend. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
my love, I find myſelf better than I
have been all day; this air refreſhes me.
I can enjoy this tranquil hour, and that
muſic, which floats ſo ſweetly at a diſtance.
Let me ſee you ſmile. "Who touches that
guitar ſo taſtefully? are there two inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
or is it an echo I hear?"</p>
            <p>"It is an echo, monſieur, I fancy. That
guitar is often heard at night, when all
is ſtill, but nobody knows who touches it,
and it is ſometimes accompanied by a voice
ſo ſweet, and ſo ſad, one would almoſt
think the woods were haunted." "They
certainly are haunted," ſaid St. Aubert with
a ſmile, "but I believe it is by mortals."
"I have ſometimes heard it at midnight,
when I could not ſleep," rejoined La
Voiſin, not ſeeming to notice this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark,
"almoſt under my window, and
I never heard any muſic like it. It has
often made me think of my poor wife till I
cried. I have ſometimes got up to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow
to look if I could ſee any body, but
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0247300301:193"/>
as ſoon as I opened the caſement all was
huſhed, and nobody to be ſeen; and I have
liſtened, and liſtened till I have been ſo ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morous,
that even the trembling of the
leaves in the breeze has made me ſtart.
They ſay it often comes to warn people of
their death, but I have heard it theſe many
years, and outlived the warning."</p>
            <p>Emily, though ſhe ſmiled at the mention
of this ridiculous ſuperſtition, could not, in
the preſent tone of her ſpirits, wholly reſiſt
its contagion.</p>
            <p>"Well, but, my good friend," ſaid St.
Aubert, "has nobody had courage to follow
the ſounds? If they had, they would probably
have diſcovered who is the muſician." "Yes,
ſir, they have followed them ſome way into
the woods, but the muſic has ſtill retreated,
and ſeemed as diſtant as ever, and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
have at laſt been afraid of being led in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
harm, and would go no further. It is
very ſeldom that I have heard theſe ſounds
ſo early in the evening. They uſually come
about midnight, when that bright planet,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0247300301:194"/>
which is riſing above the turret yonder, ſets
below the woods on the left."</p>
            <p>"What turret?" aſked St. Aubert with
quickneſs, "I ſee none."</p>
            <p>"Your pardon, monſieur, you do ſee
one indeed, for the moon ſhines full upon
it;—up the avenue yonder, a long way off;
the chateau it belongs to is hid among the
trees."</p>
            <p>"Yes, my dear ſir," ſaid Emily pointing,
"don't you ſee ſomething glitter above the
dark woods? It is a fane, I fancy, which
the rays fall upon."</p>
            <p>"O yes, I ſee what you mean; and who
does the chateau belong to?"</p>
            <p>"The Marquis de Villeroi was its own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,"
replied La Voiſin, emphatically.</p>
            <p>"Ah!" ſaid St. Aubert with a deep ſigh,
"are we then ſo near Le-Blanc!" He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
much agitated.</p>
            <p>"It uſed to be the Marquis's favourite
reſidence," reſumed La Voiſin, "but he
took a diſlike to the place, and has not been
there for many years. We have heard
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0247300301:195"/>
lately that he is dead, and that it is fallen
into other hands." St. Aubert, who had
ſat in deep muſing, was rouſed by the laſt
words. "Dead!" he exclaimed, "Good
God! when did he die?"</p>
            <p>"He is reported to have died about five
weeks ſince," replied La Voiſin. "Did you
know the Marquis, ſir?"</p>
            <p>"This is very extraordinary!" ſaid St.
Aubert without attending to the queſtion.
"Why is it ſo, my dear ſir?" ſaid Emily,
in a voice" of timid curioſity. He made no
reply, but ſunk again into a reverie; and
in a few moments, when he ſeemed to have
recovered himſelf, aſked who had ſucceeded
to the eſtates. "I have forgot his title,
monſieur," ſaid La Voiſin; "but my lord
reſides at Paris chiefly; I hear no talk of
his coming hither."</p>
            <p>"The chateau is ſhut up then, ſtill?"</p>
            <p>"Why, little better, ſir; the old houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper,
and her huſband the ſteward, have
the care of it, but they live generally in a
cottage hard by."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:0247300301:196"/>
"The chateau is ſpacious, I ſuppoſe,"
ſaid Emily, "and muſt be deſolate for the
teſidence of only two perſons."</p>
            <p>Deſolate enough, mademoiſelle," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
La Voiſin, "I would not paſs one
night in the chateau, for the value of the
whole domain."</p>
            <p>"What is that?" ſaid St. Aubert, rouſed
again from thoughtfulneſs. As his hoſt
repeated his laſt ſentence, a groan eſcaped
from St. Aubert, and then, as if anxious
to prevent it from being noticed, he haſtily
aſked La Voiſin how long he had lived
in this neighbourhood. "Almoſt from my
childhood, ſir," replied his hoſt.</p>
            <p>"You remember the late marchioneſs,
then?" ſaid St. Aubert in an altered voice.</p>
            <p>"Ah, monſieur!—that I do well. There
are many beſide me who remember her."</p>
            <p>"Yes—" ſaid St. Aubert, "and I am
one of thoſe."</p>
            <p>"Alas, ſir! you remember, then, a moſt
beautiful and excellent lady. She deſerved
a better fate."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0247300301:197"/>
Tears ſtood in St. Aubert's eyes;
"Enough," ſaid he, in a voice almoſt ſtifled
by the violence of his emotions,—"it is
enough, my friend."</p>
            <p>Emily, though extremely ſurpriſed by
her father's manner, forbore to expreſs her
feelings by any queſtion. La Voiſin began
to apologize, but St. Aubert interrupted
him; "Apology is quite unneceſſary,"
ſaid he, "let us change the topic. You
was ſpeaking of the muſic we juſt now
heard."</p>
            <p>"I was, monſieur,—but hark!—it comes
again; liſten to that voice!" They were
all ſilent;
<q>
                  <l>At laſt a ſoft and ſolemn-breathing
ſound</l>
                  <l>Roſe, like a ſtream of rich diſtilled perſumes,</l>
                  <l>And ſtole upon the air, that even Silence</l>
                  <l>Was took ere ſhe was 'ware, and wiſhed ſhe might</l>
                  <l>Deny her nature, and be never more</l>
                  <l>Still, to be ſo diſplaced<note n="*" place="bottom">MILTON.</note>.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>In a few moments the voice died into air,
and the inſtrument, which had been heard
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0247300301:198"/>
before, ſounded in low ſymphony. St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
now obſerved, that it produced a tone
much more full and melodious than that of
a guitar, and ſtill more melancholy and ſoft
than the lute. They continued to liſten, but the
ſounds returned no more. "This is ſtrange!"
ſaid St. Aubert, at length interrupting the
ſilence. "Very ſtrange!" ſaid Emily. "It
is ſo," rejoined La Voiſin, and they were
again ſilent.</p>
            <p>After a long pauſe, "It is now about
eighteen years ſince I firſt heard that mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic,"
ſaid La Voiſin; "I remember it was
on a fine ſummer's night, much like this,
but later, that I was walking in the woods,
and alone. I remember, too, that my ſpirits
were very low, for one of my boys was ill,
and we feared we mould loſe him. I had
been watching at his bed-ſide all the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
while his mother ſlept; for ſhe had ſat
up with him the night before. I had been
watching, and went out for a little freſh air,
the day had been very ſultry. As I walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
under the ſhades and muſed, I heard mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0247300301:199"/>
at a diſtance, and thought it was Claude
playing upon his flute, as he often did of a
fine evening, at the cottage door. But,
when I came to a place, where the trees
opened, (I ſhall never forget it!) and ſtood
looking up at the north-lights, which ſhot
up the heaven to a great height, I heard all
of a ſudden ſuch ſounds!—they came ſo as
I cannot deſcribe. It was like the muſic of
angels, and I looked up again almoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting
to ſee them in the ſky. When I
came home, I told what I had heard, but
they laughed at me, and ſaid it muſt be ſome
of the ſhepherds playing on their pipes, and
I could not perſuade them to the contrary.
A few nights after, however, my wife her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
heard the ſame ſounds, and was as much
ſurpriſed as I was, and father Denis fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
her ſadly by ſaying, that it was muſic
come to warn her of her child's death, and
that muſic often came to houſes where there
was a dying perſon."</p>
            <p>Emily, on hearing this, ſhrunk with a
ſuperſtitious dread entirely new to her, and
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0247300301:200"/>
could ſcarcely conceal her agitation from
St. Aubert.</p>
            <p>"But the boy lived, monſieur, in ſpite
of father Denis."</p>
            <p>"Father Denis!" ſaid St. Aubert, who
had liſtened to "narrative old age" with
patient attention, "are we near a convent,
then?"</p>
            <p>"Yes, ſir, the convent of St. Clair ſtands
at no great diſtance, on the ſea ſhore
yonder."</p>
            <p>"Ah!" ſaid St. Aubert, as if ſtruck
with ſome ſudden remembrance, "the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of St. Clair!" Emily obſerved the
clouds of grief, mingled with a faint ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of horror, gathering on his brow;
his countenance became fixed, and, touched
as it now was by the ſilver whiteneſs of the
moon light, he reſembled one of thoſe mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
ſtatues of a monument, which ſeem to
bend, in hopeleſs ſorrow, over the aſhes of
the dead, ſhewn</p>
            <q>

"But, my dear ſir," ſaid Emily, anxious
to diſſipate his thoughts, "you forget that
repoſe is neceſſary to you. If our kind
hoſt will give me leave, I will prepare your
bed, for I know how you like it to be
made." St. Aubert, recollecting himſelf,
and ſmiling affectionately, deſired ſhe would
not add to her fatigue by that attention;
and La Voiſin, whoſe conſideration for his
gueſt had been ſuſpended by the intereſts,
which his own narrative had recalled, now
ſtarted from his ſeat, and, apologizing for
not having called Agnes from the green,
hurried out of the room.</p>
            <p>In a few moments he returned with his
daughter, a young woman of a pleaſing
countenance, and Emily learned from her,
what ſhe had not before ſuſpected, that, for
their accommodation, it was neceſſary part
of La Voiſin's family ſhould leave their
beds; ſhe lamented this circumſtance, but
Agnes, by her reply, fully proved that ſhe
inherited, at leaſt, a ſhare of her father's
courteous hoſpitality. It was ſettled, that
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0247300301:202"/>
ſome of her children and Michael ſhould
ſleep in the neighbouring cottage.</p>
            <p>"If I am better, to-morrow, my dear,"
ſaid St. Aubert when Emily returned to
him, "I mean to ſet out at an early hour,
that we may reſt, during the heat of the
day, and will travel towards home. In the
preſent ſtate of my health and ſpirits, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
look on a longer journey with pleaſure,
and I am alſo very anxious to reach La
Vallée." Emily, though ſhe alſo deſired
to return, was grieved at her father's ſudden
wiſh to do ſo, which ſhe thought indicated
a greater degree of indiſpoſition than he
would acknowledge. St. Aubert now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired
to reſt, and Emily to her little cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
but not to immediate repoſe. Her
thoughts returned to the late converſation,
concerning the ſtate of departed ſpirits; a
ſubject, at this time, particularly affecting
to her, when ſhe had every reaſon to believe,
that her dear father would ere long be num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered
with them. She leaned penſively on
the little open caſement, and in deep thought
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0247300301:203"/>
fixed her eyes on the heaven, whoſe blue
unclouded concave was ſtudded thick with
ſtars, the worlds, perhaps, of ſpirits, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphered
of mortal mould. As her eyes
wandered along the boundleſs aether, her
thoughts roſe, as before, towards the ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
of the Deity, and to the contemplation
of futurity. No buſy note of this world
interrupted the courſe of her mind; the
merry dance had ceaſed, and every cottager
had retired to his home. The ſtill air ſeemed
ſcarcely to breathe upon the woods, and,
now and then, the diſtant ſound of a ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
ſheep-bell, or of a cloſing caſement, was
all that broke on ſilence. At length, even
this hint of human being was heard no
more. Elevated and enwrapt, while her
eyes were often wet with tears of ſublime
devotion and ſolemn awe, ſhe continued at
the caſement, till the gloom of mid-night
hung over the earth, and the planet, which
La Voiſin had pointed out, ſunk below the
woods. She then recollected what he had
ſaid concerning this planet, and the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0247300301:204"/>
muſic; and, as ſhe lingered at the
window, half hoping and half fearing that
it would return, her mind was led to the
remembrance of the extreme emotion her
father had ſhewn on mention of the Marquis
La Villeroi's death, and of the fate of the
Marchioneſs, and ſhe felt ſtrongly intereſted
concerning the remote cauſe of this emotion.
Her ſurpriſe and curioſity were indeed the
greater, becauſe ſhe did not recollect ever
to have heard him mention the name of
Villeroi.</p>
            <p>No muſic, however, ſtole on the ſilence of
the night, and Emily, perceiving the lateneſs
of the hour, returned to a ſcene of fatigue,
remembered that ſhe was to riſe early in the
morning, and withdrew from the window to
repoſe.</p>

            <p>EMILY, called, as ſhe had requeſted, at
an early hour, awoke, little refreſhed by
ſleep, for uneaſy dreams had purſued her, and
marred the kindeſt bleſſing of the unhappy.
But, when ſhe opened her caſement, looked
out upon the woods, bright with the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſun, and inſpired the pure air, her
mind was ſoothed. The ſcene was filled
with that cheering freſhneſs, which ſeems to
breathe the very ſpirit of health, and ſhe heard
only ſweet and <hi>pictureſque</hi> ſounds, if ſuch an
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0247300301:206"/>
expreſſion may be allowed—the matin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell
of a diſtant convent, the faint murmur
of the ſea-waves, the ſong of birds, and
the far-off low of cattle, which ſhe ſaw
coming ſlowly on between the trunks of the
trees. Struck with the circumſtances of
imagery around her, ſhe indulged the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
tranquillity which they inſpired; and
while ſhe leaned on her window, waiting
till St. Aubert ſhould deſcend to break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt,
her ideas arranged themſelves in the
following lines:</p>
            <q>
               <lg>
                  <head>THE FIRST HOUR OF MORNING.</head>

                     <l>How ſweet to wind the foreſt's tangled ſhade,</l>
                     <l>When early twilight, from the eaſtern bound,</l>
                     <l>Dawns on the ſleeping landſcape in the glade,</l>
                     <l>And fades as morning ſpreads her bluſh around!</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>When ev'ry infant flower, that wept in night,</l>
                     <l>Lifts its chill head ſoft glowing with a tear,</l>
                     <l>Expands its tender bloſſom to the light,</l>
                     <l>And gives its incenſe to the genial air.</l>

                  <lg>
                     <l>How freſh the breeze that wafts the rich perfume,</l>
                     <l>And ſwells the melody of waking birds;</l>
                     <l>The hum of bees, beneath the verdant gloom,</l>

                     <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0247300301:207"/>
                     <l>Then, doubtful gleams the mountain's hoary head,</l>
                     <l>Seen through the parting foliage from afar;</l>
                     <l>And, farther ſtill, the ocean's miſty bed,</l>

                     <l>But, vain the ſylvan ſhade—the breath of May,</l>
                     <l>The voice of muſic floating on the gale,</l>
                     <l>And forms, that beam through morning's dewy veil,</l>
                     <l>If health no longer bid the heart be gay!</l>
                     <l>O balmy hour! 'tis thine her wealth to give,</l>
                     <l>Here ſpread her bluſh, and bid the parent live!</l>
                  </lg>
               </lg>
            </q>
            <p>Emily now heard perſons moving below
in the cottage, and preſently the voice of
Michael, who was talking to his mules, as
he led them forth from a hut adjoining.
As ſhe left her room, St. Aubert, who was
now riſen, met her at the door, apparently
as little reſtored by ſleep as herſelf. She
led him down ſtairs to the little parlour,
in which they had ſupped on the preceding
night, where they found a neat breakfaſt
ſet out, while the hoſt and his daughter
waited to bid them good morrow.</p>
            <p>"I envy you this cottage, my good
friends," ſaid St. Aubert, as he met them,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0247300301:208"/>
"it is ſo pleaſant, ſo quiet, and ſo neat;
and this air, that one breathes—if any thing
could reſtore loſt health, it would ſurely be
this air."</p>
            <p>La Voiſin bowed gratefully, and replied,
with the gallantry of a Frenchman, "Our
cottage may be envied, ſir, ſince you and
Mademoiſelle have honoured it with your
preſence." St. Aubert gave him a friendly
ſmile for his compliment, and ſat down to
a table, ſpread with cream, fruit, new
cheeſe, butter, and coffee. Emily, who
had obſerved her father with attention, and
thought he looked very ill, endeavoured to
perſuade him to defer travelling till the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon;
but he ſeemed very anxious to be
at home, and his anxiety he expreſſed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly,
and with an earneſtneſs that was
unuſual with him. He now ſaid, he found
himſelf as well as he had been of late, and
that he could bear travelling better in the
cool hour of the morning, than at any other
time. But, while he was talking with his
venerable hoſt, and thanking him for his
kind attentions, Emily obſerved his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0247300301:209"/>
change, and, before ſhe could reach
him, he fell back in his chair. In a few
moments he recovered from the ſudden
faintneſs that had come over him, but felt
ſo ill, that he perceived himſelf unable to
ſet out, and, having remained a little while,
ſtruggling againſt the preſſure of
indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
he begged he might be helped up
ſtairs to bed. This requeſt renewed all the
terror which Emily had ſuffered on the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
evening; but, though ſcarcely able
to ſupport herſelf, under the ſudden ſhock
it gave her, ſhe tried to conceal her appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions
from St. Aubert, and gave her
trembling arm to aſſiſt him to the door of
his chamber.</p>
            <p>When he was once more in bed, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired
that Emily, who was then weeping
in her own room, might be called; and, as
ſhe came, he waved his hand for every
other perſon to quit the apartment. When
they were alone, he held out his hand to
her, and fixed his eyes upon her counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
with an expreſſion ſo full of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and grief, that all her fortitude forſook
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0247300301:210"/>
her, and ſhe burſt into an agony of tears.
St. Aubert ſeemed ſtruggling to acquire
firmneſs, but was ſtill unable to ſpeak; he
could only preſs her hand, and check the tears
that ſtood trembling in his eyes. At length,
he commanded his voice, "My dear child,"
ſaid he, trying to ſmile through his anguiſh,
"my dear Emily!"—and pauſed again.
He raiſed his eyes to heaven, as if in prayer,
and then, in a firmer tone, and with a look,
in which the tenderneſs of the father was
dignified by the pious ſolemnity of the ſaint,
he ſaid, "My dear child, I would ſoften
the painful truth I have to tell you, but I
find myſelf quite unequal to the art. Alas!
I would, at this moment, conceal it from
you, but that it would be moſt cruel to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
you. It cannot be long before we
muſt part; let us talk of it, that our
thoughts and our prayers may prepare us
to bear it." His voice faltered, while
Emily, ſtill weeping, preſſed his hand cloſe
to her heart, which ſwelled with a convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
ſigh, but ſhe could not look up.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0247300301:211"/>
"Let me not waſte theſe moments," ſaid
St. Aubert, recovering himſelf, "I have
much to ſay. There is a circumſtance of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
conſequence, which I have to mention,
and a ſolemn promiſe to obtain from you;
when this is done I ſhall be eaſier. You
have obſerved, my dear, how anxious I am
to reach home, but know not all my reaſons
for this. Liſten to what I am going to ſay.—Yet
ſtay—before I ſay more give me
this promiſe, a promiſe made to your dying
father!"—St. Aubert was interrupted;
Emily, ſtruck by his laſt words, as if for
the firſt time, with a conviction of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
danger, raiſed her head; her tears
ſtopped, and, gazing at him for a moment
with an expreſſion of unutterable anguiſh,
a ſlight convulſion ſeized her, and ſhe ſunk
ſenſeleſs in her chair. St. Aubert's cries
brought La Voiſin and his daughter to the
room, and they adminiſtered every means
in their power to reſtore her, but, for a
conſiderable time, without effect. When
ſhe recovered, St. Aubert was ſo exhauſted
by the ſcene he had witneſſed, that it was
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0247300301:212"/>
many minutes before he had ſtrength to
ſpeak; he was, however, ſomewhat revived
by a cordial, which Emily gave him; and,
being again alone with her, he exerted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to tranquillize her ſpirits, and to offer
her all the comfort of which her ſituation
admitted. She threw herſelf into his arms,
wept on his neck, and grief made her ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible
to all he ſaid, that he ceaſed to offer
the alleviations, which he himſelf could not,
at this moment, feel, and mingled his ſilent
tears with hers. Recalled, at length, to a,
ſenſe of duty, ſhe tried to ſpare her father
from farther view of her ſuffering; and,
quitting his embrace, dried her tears, and
ſaid ſomething, which ſhe meant for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation.
"My dear Emily," replied St.
Aubert, "my dear child, we muſt look up
with humble confidence to that Being, who
has protected and comforted us in every
danger, and in every affliction we have
known; to whoſe eye every moment of our
lives has been expoſed; he will not, he does
not, forſake us now; I feel his conſolations
in my heart. I ſhall leave you, my child,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0247300301:213"/>
ſtill in his care; and, though I depart from
this world, I ſhall be ſtill in his preſence.
Nay, weep not again, my Emily. In
death there is nothing new, or ſurpriſing,
ſince we all know, that we are born to die;
and nothing terrible to thoſe, who can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
in an all-powerful God. Had my life
been ſpared now, after a very few years, in
the courſe of nature, I muſt have reſigned
it; old age, with all its train of infirmity,
its privations and its ſorrows, would have
been mine; and then, at laſt, death would
have come, and called, forth the tears you
now ſhed. Rather, my child, rejoice, that
I am ſaved from ſuch ſuffering, and that I
am permitted to die with a mind unim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
and ſenſible of the comforts of faith
and of reſignation." St. Aubert pauſed,
fatigued, with ſpeaking. Emily again en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to aſſume an air of compoſure;
and, in replying to what he had ſaid, tried
to ſooth him with a belief, that he had not
ſpoken in vain.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0247300301:214"/>
When he had repoſed a while, he reſumed
the converſation. "Let me return," ſaid
he, "to a ſubject, which is very near
my heart. I ſaid I had a ſolemn promiſe
to receive from you; let me receive it now,
before I explain the chief circumſtance
which it concerns; there are others, of
which your peace requires that you ſhould
reſt in ignorance. Promiſe, then, that you
will perform exactly what I ſhall enjoin."</p>
            <p>Emily, awed by the earneſt ſolemnity of
his manner, dried her tears, that had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
again to flow, in ſpite of her efforts to
ſuppreſs them; and, looking eloquently
at St. Aubert, bound herſelf to do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he ſhould require by a vow, at which
ſhe ſhuddered, yet knew not why.</p>
            <p>He proceeded: "I know you too well,
my Emily, to believe, that you would break
any promiſe, much leſs one thus ſolemnly
given; your aſſurance gives me peace, and
the obſervance of it is of the utmoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
to your tranquillity. Hear, then,
what I am going to tell you. The cloſet,
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0247300301:215"/>
which adjoins my chamber at La Vallée,
has a ſliding board in the floor. You will
know it by a remarkable knot in the wood,
and by its being the next board, except
one, to the wainſcot, which fronts the door.
At the diſtance of about a yard from that
end, nearer the window, you will perceive a
line acroſs it, as if the plank had been
joined;—the way to open it is this:—Preſs
your foot upon the line, the end of the
board will then ſink, and you may ſlide it
with eaſe beneath the other. Below, you
will ſee a hollow place." St. Aubert
pauſed for breath, and Emily ſat fixed in
deep attention. "Do you underſtand theſe
directions, my dear?" ſaid he. Emily,
though ſcarcely able to ſpeak, aſſured him,
that ſhe did.</p>
            <p>"When you return home, then," he
added with a deep ſigh—</p>
            <p>At the mention of her return home, all
the melancholy circumſtances, that muſt
attend this return, ruſhed upon her fancy;
ſhe burſt into convulſive grief, and St. Aubert
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0247300301:216"/>
himſelf, affected beyond the reſiſtance of
the fortitude which he had, at firſt, ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned,
wept with her. After ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
he compoſed himſelf. "My dear
child," ſaid he, "be comforted. "When I
am gone, you will not be forſaken—I leave
you only in the more immediate care of
that Providence, which has never yet for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken
me. Do not afflict me with this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
of grief; rather teach me by your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
to bear my own." He ſtopped
again, and Emily, the more ſhe endeavoured
to reſtrain her emotion, found it the leſs
poſſible to do ſo.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert, who now ſpoke with pain,
reſumed the ſubject. "That cloſet, my
dear,—when you return home, go to it;
and, beneath the board I have deſcribed,
you will find a packet of written papers.
Attend to me now, for the promiſe you
have given particularly relates, to what I
ſhall direct. Theſe papers you muſt burn—and,
ſolemnly I command you, <hi>without exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
them.</hi>"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0247300301:217"/>
Emily's ſurpriſe, for a moment, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
her grief, and ſhe ventured to aſk,
why this muſt be? St. Aubert replied,
that, if it had been right for him to explain
his reaſons, her late promiſe would have
been unneceſſarily exacted. It is ſufficient
for you, my love, to have a deep ſenſe of
the importance of obſerving me in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance."
Sr. Aubert proceeded. "Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
that board you will alſo find about
two hundred louis d'ors, wrapped in a ſilk
purſe; indeed, it was to ſecure whatever
money might be in the chateau, that this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
place was contrived, at a time when
the province was over-run by troops of
men, who took advantage of the tumults,
and became plunderers.</p>
            <p>"But I have yet another promiſe to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
froms you, which is—that you will
never, whatever may be your future cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<hi>ſell</hi> the chateau." St. Aubert
even enjoined her, whenever ſhe might
marry, to make it an article in the contract,
that the chateau ſhould always be hers.
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0247300301:218"/>
He then gave her a more minute account of
his preſent circumſtances than he had yet
done, adding, "The two hundred louis,
with what money you will now find in my
purſe, is all the ready money I have to
leave you. I have told you how I am cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced
with M. Motteville, at Paris.
Ah, my child! I leave you poor—but not
deſtitute," he added, after a long pauſe.
Emily could make no reply to any thing he
now ſaid, but knelt at the bed-ſide, with
her face upon the quilt, weeping over the
hand ſhe held there.</p>
            <p>After this converſation, the mind of St.
Aubert appeared to be much more at eaſe;
but, exhauſted by the effort of ſpeaking, he
ſunk into a kind of doze, and Emily conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to watch and weep beſide him, till a
gentle tap at the chamber-door rouſed her.
It was La Voiſin, come to ſay, that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor
from the neighbouring convent was
below, ready to attend St. Aubert. Emily
would not ſuffer her father to be diſturbed,
but deſired, that the prieſt might hot leave
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0247300301:219"/>
the cottage. When St. Aubert awoke
from this doze, his ſenſes were confuſed,
and it was ſome moments before he reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
them ſufficiently to know, that it was
Emily who ſat beſide him. He then moved
his lips, and ſtretched forth his hand to
her; as ſhe received which, ſhe ſunk back
in her chair, overcome by the impreſſion of
death on his countenance. In a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes
he recovered his voice, and Emily
then aſked, if he wiſhed to ſee the confeſſor,
he replied, that he did; and, when the holy
father appeared, ſhe withdrew. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
alone together above half an hour;
when Emily was called in, ſhe found St.
Aubert more agitated than when ſhe had
left him, and ſhe gazed, with a ſlight de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree
of reſentment, at the friar, as the cauſe
of this; who, however, looked mildly and
mournfully at her, and turned away. St.
Aubert, in a tremulous voice, ſaid, he
wiſhed her to join in prayer with him, and
aſked if La Voiſin would do ſo too. The
old man and his daughter came; they both
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0247300301:220"/>
wept, and knelt with Emily round the bed,
while the holy father read in a ſolemn voice
the ſervice for the dying. St. Aubert lay
with a ſerene countenance, and ſeemed to
join fervently in the devotion, while tears
often ſtole from beneath his cloſed eye-lids,
and Emily's ſobs more than once inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the ſervice.</p>
            <p>When it was concluded, and extreme
unction had been adminiſtered, the friar
withdrew. St. Aubert then made a ſign
for La Voiſin to come nearer. He gave
him his hand, and was, for a moment,
ſilent. At length, he ſaid, in a trembling
voice, "My good friend, our acquaintance
has been ſhort, but long enough to give
you an opportunity of ſhewing me much
kind attention. I cannot doubt, that you
will extend this kindneſs to my daughter,
when I am gone; ſhe will have need of it.
I entruſt her to your care during the few
days ſhe will remain here. I need ſay no
more—you know the feelings of a father,
for you have children; mine would be, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0247300301:221"/>
deed, ſevere if I had leſs confidence in you."
He pauſed. La Voiſin aſſured him, and
his tears bore teſtimony to his ſincerity,
that he would do all he could to ſoften her
affliction, and that, if St. Aubert wiſhed it,
he would even attend her into Gaſcony; an
offer ſo pleaſing to St. Aubert, that he had
ſcarcely words to acknowledge his ſenſe of
the old man's kindneſs, or to tell him, that
he accepted it. The ſcene, that followed
between St. Aubert and Emily, affected
La Voiſin ſo much, that he quitted the
chamber, and ſhe was again left alone with
her father, whoſe ſpirits ſeemed fainting faſt,
but neither his ſenſes, or his voice, yet failed
him; and, at intervals, he employed much
of theſe laſt awful moments in adviſing his
daughter, as to her future conduct. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
he never had thought more juſtly, or
expreſſed himſelf more clearly, than he did
now.</p>
            <p>"Above all, my dear Emily," ſaid he, "do
not indulge in the pride of fine feeling, the
romantic error of amiable minds. Thoſe,
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0247300301:222"/>
who really poſſeſs ſenſibility, ought early to
be taught, that it is a dangerous quality,
which is continually extracting the exceſs of
miſery, or delight, from every ſurrounding
circumſtance. And, ſince, in our paſſage
through this world, painful circumſtances
occur more frequently than pleaſing ones,
and ſince our ſenſe of evil is, I fear, more
acute than our ſenſe of good, we become
the victims of our feelings, unleſs we can
in ſome degree command them. I know you
will ſay, (for you are young, my Emily)
I know you will ſay, that you are contented
ſometimes to ſuffer, rather than to give up
your refined ſenſe of happineſs, at others;
but, when your mind has been long ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed by viciſſitude, you will be content to
reſt, and you will then recover from your
deluſion. You will perceive, that the
phantom of happineſs is exchanged for the
ſubſtance; for happineſs ariſes in a ſtate of
peace, not of tumult. It is of a temperate
and uniform nature, and can no more exiſt
in a heart, that is continually alive to mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0247300301:223"/>
circumſtances, than in one that is dead
to feeling. You ſee, my dear, that, though
I would guard you againſt the dangers of
ſenſibility, I am not an advocate for apa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy.
At your age I ſhould have ſaid <hi>that</hi> is
a vice more hateful than all the errors of
ſenſibility, and I ſay ſo ſtill. I call it a
<hi>vice,</hi> becauſe it leads to poſitive evil; in
this, however, it does no more than an ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>governed
ſenſibility, which, by ſuch a rule,
might alſo be called a vice; but the evil of
the former is of more general conſequence.
I have exhauſted myſelf" ſaid St. Aubert,
feebly, "and have wearied you, my Emily;
but, on a ſubject ſo important to your fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
comfort, I am anxious to be perfectly
underſtood."</p>
            <p>Emily aſſured him, that his advice was
moſt precious to her, and that ſhe would
never forget it, or ceaſe from endeavouring
to profit by it. St. Aubert ſmiled affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionately
and ſorrowfully upon her. "I
repeat it," ſaid he, "I would not teach you
to become inſenſible, if I could; I would
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0247300301:224"/>
only warn you of the evils of ſuſceptibility,
and point out how you may avoid them.
Beware, my love, I conjure you, of that ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deluſion,
which has been fatal to the peace of
ſo many perſons; beware of priding yourſelf
on the gracefulneſs of ſenſibility; if you
yield to this vanity, your happineſs is loſt
for ever. Always remember how much
more valuable is the ſtrength of fortitude,
than the grace of ſenſibility. Do not,
however, confound fortitude with apathy;
apathy cannot know the virtue. Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
too, that one act of beneficence, one
act of real uſefulneſs, is worth all the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
ſentiment in the world. Sentiment
is a diſgrace, inſtead of an ornament, unleſs
it lead us to good actions. The miſer,
who thinks himſelf reſpectable, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he poſſeſſes wealth, and thus miſtakes
the means of doing good, for the actual ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment
of it, is not more blameable
than the man of ſentiment, without active
virtue. You may have obſerved perſons,
who delight ſo much in this sort of ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0247300301:225"/>
to ſentiment, which excludes that to the
calls of any practical virtue, that they turn
from the diſtreſſed, and, becauſe their ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
are painful to be contemplated, do
not endeavour to relieve them. How de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable
is that humanity, which can be
contented to pity, where it might aſſuage!"</p>
            <p>St. Aubert, ſome time after, ſpoke of
Madame Cheron, his ſiſter. "Let me in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
you of a circumſtance, that nearly
affects, your welfare," he added. "We
have, you know, had little intercourſe for
ſome years; but, as ſhe is now your only
female relation, I have thought it proper to
conſign you to her care, as you will ſee in my
will, till yon are of age, and to recommend
you to her protection afterwards. She is
not exactly the perſon, to whom I would
have committed my Emily, but I had no
alternative, and I believe her to be upon
the whole—a good kind of woman. I
need not recommend it to your prudence,
my love, to endeavour to conciliate her
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0247300301:226"/>
kindneſs; you will do this for his ſake, who
has often wiſhed to do ſo for yours."</p>
            <p>Emily aſſured him, that, whatever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
ſhe would religiouſly perform to
the utmoſt of her ability. "Alas!" added
ſhe, in a voice interrupted by ſighs, "that
will ſoon be all which remains for me; it will
be almoſt my only conſolation to fulfil your
wiſhes."</p>
            <p>St. Aubert looked up ſilently in her face,
as if he would have ſpoken, but his ſpirit
ſunk a while, and his eyes became heavy
and dull. She felt that look at her heart.
"My dear father!" ſhe exclaimed; and
then, checking herſelf, preſſed his hand
cloſer, and hid her face with her handker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.
Her tears were concealed, but St.
Aubert heard her convulſive ſobs. His
ſpirits returned. "O my child!" ſaid
he, faintly, "let my conſolations be yours.
I die in peace; for I know, that I am about
to return to the boſom of my Father, who
will ſtill be your Father, when I am gone.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0247300301:227"/>
Always truſt in him, my love, and he will
ſupport you in theſe moments, as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
me."</p>
            <p>Emily could only liſten, and weep; but;
the extreme compoſure of his manner, and
the faith and hope he expreſſed, ſomewhat
ſoothed her anguiſh. Yet, whenever ſhe
looked upon his emaciated countenance,
and ſaw the lines of death beginning to
prevail over it—ſaw his ſunk eyes, ſtill bent
on her, and their heavy lids preſſing to a
cloſe, there was a pang in her heart, ſuch as
defied expreſſion, though it required filial
virtue, like hers, to forbear the attempt.</p>
            <p>He deſired once more to bleſs her;
"Where are you, my dear?" ſaid he, as he
ſtretched forth his hands. Emily had
turned to the window, that he might not
perceive her anguiſh; ſhe now underſtood,
that his ſight had failed him. When he
had given her his bleſſing, and it ſeemed to
be the laſt effort of expiring life, he ſunk
back on his pillow. She kiſſed his fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head;
the damps of death had ſettled there,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0247300301:228"/>
and, forgetting her fortitude for a moment,
her tears mingled with them. St. Aubert
lifted up his eyes; the ſpirit of a father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to them, but it quickly vaniſhed,
and he ſpoke no more.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert lingered till about three
o'clock in the afternoon, and, thus gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſinking into death, he expired without
a ſtruggle, or a ſigh.</p>
            <p>Emily was led from the chamber by La
Voiſin and his daughter, who did what they
could to comfort her. The old man ſat
and wept with her. Agnes was more erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neouſly
officious.</p>

            <p>THE monk, who had before appeared,
returned in the evening to offer conſolation
to Emily, and brought a kind meſſage from
the lady abbeſs, inviting her to the convent.
Emily, though ſhe did not accept the offer,
returned an anſwer expreſſive of her grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
The holy converſation of the friar,
whoſe mild benevolence of manners bore
ſome reſemblance to thoſe of St. Aubert,
ſoothed the violence of her grief, and lifted
her heart to the Being, who, extending
through all place and all eternity, looks
on the events of this little world as on
the ſhadows of a moment, and beholds
equally, and in the ſame inſtant, the ſoul
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0247300301:230"/>
that has paſſed the gates of death, and that,
which ſtill lingers in the body. "In the ſight
of God," ſaid Emily, "my dear father now
exiſts, as truly as he yeſterday exiſted to
me; it is to me only that he is dead; to God
and to himſelf he yet lives!"</p>
            <p>The good monk left her more tranquil
than ſhe had been ſince St. Aubert died;
and, before ſhe retired to her little cabin for
the night, ſhe truſted herſelf ſo far as to
viſit the corpſe. Silent, and without weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſhe ſtood by its ſide. The features,
placid and ſerene, told the nature of the laſt
ſenſations, that had lingered in the now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
frame. For a moment ſhe turned
away, in horror of the ſtillneſs in which
death had fixed that countenance, never till
now ſeen otherwiſe than animated; then
gazed on it with a mixture of doubt and
awful aſtoniſhment. Her reaſon could
ſcarcely overcome an involuntary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable
expectation of ſeeing that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved
countenance ſtill ſuſceptible. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to gaze wildly; took up the cold
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0247300301:231"/>
hand; ſpoke; ſtill gazed, and then burſt
into a tranſport of grief. La Voiſin, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſobs, came into the room to lead
her away, but ſhe heard nothing, and only
begged that he would leave her.</p>
            <p>Again alone, ſhe indulged her tears, and,
when the gloom of evening obſcured the
chamber, and almoſt veiled from her eyes
the object of her diſtreſs, ſhe ſtill hung over
the body; till her ſpirits, at length, were
exhauſted, and ſhe became tranquil. La
Voiſin again knocked at the door, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
that ſhe would come to the common
apartment. Before ſhe went, ſhe kiſſed the
lips of St. Aubert, as ſhe was wont to do
when ſhe bade him good night. Again ſhe
kiſſed them; her heart felt as if it would
break, a few tears of agony ſtarted to her
eyes, ſhe looked up to heaven, then at St.
Aubert, and left the room.</p>
            <p>Retired to her lonely cabin, her melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
thoughts ſtill hovered round the body
of her deceaſed parent; and, when ſhe ſunk
into a kind of ſlumber, the images of her
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0247300301:232"/>
waking mind ſtill haunted her fancy. She
thought ſhe ſaw her father approaching her
with a benign countenance; then, ſmiling
mournfully and pointing upwards, his lips
moved, but, inſtead of words, ſhe heard
ſweet muſic borne on the diſtant air, and
preſently ſaw his features glow with the
mild rapture of a ſuperior being. The
ſtrain ſeemed to ſwell louder, and ſhe awoke.
The viſion was gone, but muſic yet came
to her ear in ſtrains ſuch as angels might
breathe. She doubted, liſtened, raiſed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in the bed, and again liſtened. It was
muſic, and not an illuſion of her imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
After a ſolemn ſteady harmony, it
pauſed; then roſe again, in mournful ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and then died, in a cadence, that ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to bear away the liſtening ſoul to heaven.
She inſtantly remembered the muſic of the
preceding night, with the ſtrange circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
related by La Voiſin, and the affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
converſation it had led to, concerning
the ſtate of departed ſpirits. All that St.
Aubert had ſaid, on that ſubject, now preſſed
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0247300301:233"/>
upon her heart, and overwhelmed it. What
a change in a few hours! He, who then
could only conjecture, was now made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with truth; was himſelf become
one of the departed! As the liſtened, ſhe
was chilled with ſuperſtitious awe, her tears
ſtopped; and ſhe roſe, and went to the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow.
All without was obſcured in ſhade;
but Emily, turning her eyes from the maſſy
darkneſs of the woods, whoſe waving out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line
appeared on the horizon, ſaw, on the
left, that effulgent planet, which the old
man had pointed out, ſetting over the woods.
She remembered what he had ſaid concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it, and, the muſic now coming at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals
on the air, ſhe uncloſed the caſement to
liſten to the ſtrains, that ſoon gradually
ſunk to a greater diſtance, and tried to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
whence they came. The obſcurity
prevented her from diſtinguiſhing any ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
on the green platform below; and the
ſounds became fainter and fainter, till they
ſoftened into ſilence. She liſtened, but they
returned no more. Soon after, ſhe obſerved
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0247300301:234"/>
the planet trembling between the fringed
tops of the woods, and, in the next moment,
ſink behind them. Chilled with a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
awe, ſhe retired once more to her bed,
and, at length, forgot for a while her ſorrows
in ſleep.</p>
            <p>On the following morning, ſhe was viſited
by a ſiſter of the convent, who came, with
kind offices and a ſecond invitation from
the lady abbeſs; and Emily, though ſhe
could not forſake the cottage, while the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of her father were in it, conſented,
however painful ſuch a viſit muſt be, in the
preſent ſtate of her ſpirits, to pay her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
to the abbeſs, in the evening.</p>
            <p>About an hour before ſun-ſet, La Voiſin
ſhewed her the way through the woods to
the convent, which ſtood in a ſmall bay of
the Mediterranean, crowned by a woody
amphitheatre; and Emily, had ſhe been leſs
unhappy, would have admired the extenſive
ſea view, that appeared from the green ſlope,
in front of the edifice, and the rich ſhores,
hung with woods and paſtures, that extended
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0247300301:235"/>
on either hand. But her thoughts were now
occupied by one ſad idea, and the features
of nature were to her colourleſs and without
form. The bell for veſpers ſtruck, as ſhe
paſſed the ancient gate of the convent, and
ſeemed the funereal note for St. Aubert.
Little incidents affect a mind, enervated,
by ſorrow; Emily, ſtruggled againſt the
ſickening faintneſs, that came over her,
and was led into the preſence of the abbeſs,
who received her with an air of maternal,
tenderneſs; an air of ſuch gentle ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
and conſideration, as touched her with
an inſtantaneous gratitude; her eyes were
filled with tears, and the words ſhe' would
have ſpoken faltered on her lips. The
abbeſs led her to a ſeat, and ſat down beside
her, ſtill holding her hand and regarding
her in ſilence, as Emily dried her tears and
attempted to ſpeak. "Be compoſed, my
daughter," ſaid the abbeſs in a ſoothing
voice, "do not ſpeak yet; I know all you
would ſay. Your ſpirits muſt be ſoothed.
We are going to prayers;—will you attend:
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0247300301:236"/>
our evening ſervice? It is comfortable, my
child, to look up in our afflictions to a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who ſees and pities us, and who chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens
in his mercy."</p>
            <p>Emily's tears flowed again, but a thouſand
ſweet emotions mingled with them. The
abbeſs ſuffered her to weep without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption,
and watched over her with a look
of benignity, that might have characterized
the countenance of a guardian angel. Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
when ſhe became tranquil, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
to ſpeak without reſerve, and to
mention the motive, that made her unwill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to quit the cottage, which the abbeſs
did not oppoſe even by a hint; but praiſed
the filial piety of her conduct, and added a
hope, that ſhe would paſs a few days at the
convent, before ſhe returned to La Vallée.
"You muſt allow yourſelf a little time to
recover from your firſt ſhock, my daughter,
before you encounter a ſecond; I will not
affect to conceal from you how much I know
your heart muſt ſuffer, on returning to the
ſcene of your former happineſs. Here, you
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0247300301:237"/>
will have all, that quiet and ſympathy and
religion can give, to reſtore your ſpirits. But
come," added ſhe, obſerving the tears ſwell
in Emily's eyes, "we will go to the chapel."</p>
            <p>Emily followed to the parlour, where the
nuns were aſſembled, to whom the abbeſs
committed her, ſaying, "This is a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
for whom I have much eſteem; be ſiſters
to her."</p>
            <p>They paſſed on in a train to the chapel,
where the ſolemn devotion, with which the
ſervice was performed, elevated her mind,
and brought to it the comforts of faith and
reſignation.</p>
            <p>Twilight came on, before the abbeſs's
kindneſs would ſuffer Emily to depart, when
ſhe left the convent, with a heart much
lighter than ſhe had entered it, and was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conducted
by La Voiſin through the woods,
the penſive gloom of which was in uniſon
with the temper of her mind; and ſhe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
the little wild path, in muſing ſilence,
till her guide ſuddenly ſtopped, looked
round, and then ſtruck out of the path into
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0247300301:238"/>
the high graſs, ſaying he had miſtaken the
road. He now walked on quickly, and
Emily, proceeding with difficulty over the
obſcured and uneven ground, was left at
ſome diſtance, till her voice arreſted him,
who ſeemed unwilling to ſtop, and ſtill hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on. "If you are in doubt about the
way," ſaid Emily, "had we not better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
it at the chateau yonder, between the
trees?"</p>
            <p>"No," replied La Voiſin, "there is no
occaſion. When we reach that brook,
ma'amſelle, (you ſee the light upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
there, beyond the woods) when we
reach that brook, we ſhall be at home pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.
I don't know how I happened to
miſtake the path; I ſeldom come this way
after ſun-ſet."</p>
            <p>"It is ſolitary enough." ſaid Emily, "but
you have no banditti here." "No, ma' am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle—no
banditti."</p>
            <p>"What are you afraid of then, my good
friend? you are not ſuperſtitious?" "No,
not ſuperſtitious; but, to tell you the truth,
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0247300301:239"/>
lady, nobody likes to go near that chateau,
after duſk." "By whom is it inhabited,"
ſaid Emily, "that it is ſo formidable?"
"Why, ma'amſelle, it is ſcarcely inhabited,
for our lord the Marquis, and the lord of
all theſe fine woods, too, is dead. He had
not once been in it, for theſe many years,
and his people, who have the care of it, live
in a cottage cloſe by." Emily now under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
this to be the chateau, which La
Voiſin had formerly pointed out, as having
belonged to the Marquis Villeroi, on the
mention of which her father had appeared
ſo much affected.</p>
            <p>"Ah! it is a deſolate place now," con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
La Voiſin, "and ſuch a grand, fine
place, as I remember it!" Emily enquired
what had occaſioned this lamentable change;
but the old man was ſilent, and Emily,
whoſe intereſt was awakened by the fear he
had expreſſed, and above all by a recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her father's agitation, repeated the
queſtion, and added, "If you are neither
afraid of the inhabitants, my good friend,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0247300301:240"/>
nor are ſuperſtitious, how happens it, that
you dread to paſs near that chateau in the
dark?"</p>
            <p>"Perhaps, then, I am a little ſuperſtitious,
ma'amſelle; and, if you knew what I do,
you might be ſo too. Strange things have
happened there. Monſieur, your good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
appeared to have known the late Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chioneſs."
"Pray inform me what did
happen?" ſaid Emily, with much emotion.</p>
            <p>"Alas! ma'amſelle," anſwered La Voiſin,
"enquire no further: it is not for me to lay
open the domeſtic ſecrets of my lord."—Emily,
ſurpriſed by the old man's words,
and his manner of delivering them, forbore
to repeat her queſtion; a nearer intereſt, the
remembrance of St. Aubert, occupied her
thoughts, and ſhe was led to recollect the
muſic ſhe heard on the preceding night,
which ſhe mentioned to La Voiſin. "You
was not alone, ma'amſelle, in this," he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied,
"I heard it too; but I have ſo often
heard it, at the ſame hour, that I was ſcarcely
ſurpriſed."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0247300301:241"/>
"You doubtleſs believe this muſic to
have ſome connection with the chateau,"
ſaid Emily ſuddenly," and are, therefore,
ſuperſtitious." "It may be ſo, ma'amſelle,
but there are other circumſtances, belonging
to that chateau, which I remember, and ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
too." A heavy ſigh followed: but Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's
delicacy reſtrained the curioſity theſe
words revived, and ſhe enquired no further.</p>
            <p>On reaching the cottage, all the violence
of her grief returned; it ſeemed as if ſhe had
eſcaped its heavy preſſure only while ſhe was
removed from the object of it. She paſſed
immediately to the chamber, where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains
of her father were laid, and yielded to
all the anguiſh of hopeleſs grief. La Voiſin,
at length, perſuaded her to leave the room,
and ſhe returned to her own, where, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
by the ſufferings of the day, ſhe ſoon
fell into deep ſleep, and awoke conſiderably
refreſhed.</p>
            <p>When the dreadful hour arrived, in which
the remains of St. Aubert were to be taken
from her for ever, ſhe went alone to the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0247300301:242"/>
chamber to look upon his countenance yet
once again, and La Voiſin, who had waited
patiently below ſtairs, till her deſpair ſhould
ſubſide, with the reſpect due to grief, forbore
to interrupt the indulgence of it, till ſurpriſe,
at the length of her ſtay, and then appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
overcame his delicacy, and he went
to lead her from the chamber. Having tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
gently at the door, without receiving an
anſwer, he liſtened attentively, but all was
ſtill; no ſigh, no ſob of anguiſh was heard.
Yet more alarmed by this ſilence, he opened
the door, and found Emily lying ſenſeleſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acroſs
the foot of the bed, near which ſtood
the coffin. His calls procured aſſiſtance,
and ſhe was carried to her room, where pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
applications, at length, reſtored her.</p>
            <p>During her ſtate of inſenſibility, La Voiſin
had given directions for the coffin to be
cloſed, and he ſucceeded in perſuading
Emily to forbear reviſiting the chamber.
She, indeed, felt herſelf unequal to this, and
alſo perceived the neceſſity of ſparing her
ſpirits, and recollecting fortitude ſufficient to
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0247300301:243"/>
bear her through the approaching ſcene. St.
Aubert had given a particular injunction,
that his remains ſhould be interred in the
church of the convent of St. Clair, and,
in mentioning the north chancel, near the
ancient tomb of the Villerois, had pointed
out the exact ſpot, where he wiſhed to be
laid. The ſuperior had granted this place for
the interment, and thither, therefore, the ſad
proceſſion now moved, which was met, at the
gates, by the venerable prièſt, followed by a
train of friars. Every perſon, who heard the
ſolemn chant of the anthem, and the peal of
the organ, that ſtruck up, when the body
entered the church, and ſaw alſo the feeble
ſteps, and the aſſumed tranquillity of Emily,
gave her involuntary tears. She ſhed none,
but walked, her face partly ſhaded by a thin
black veil, between two perſons, who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
her, preceded by the abbeſs, and
followed by nuns, whoſe plaintive voices
mellowed the ſwelling harmony of the dirge.
When the proceſſion came to the grave the
muſic ceaſed. Emily drew the veil entirely
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0247300301:244"/>
over her face, and, in a momentary pauſe,
between the anthem and the reſt of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
her ſobs were diſtinctly audible. The
holy father began the ſervice, and Emily
again commanded her feelings, till the coffin
was let down, and ſhe heard the earth rattle
on its lid. Then, as ſhe ſhuddered, a groan
burſt from her heart, and ſhe leaned for
ſupport on the perſon who ſtood next to
her. In a few moments ſhe recovered; and,
when ſhe heard thoſe affecting and ſublime
words: "His body is buried in peace, and
his ſoul returns to Him that gave it," her
anguiſh ſoftened into tears.</p>
            <p>The abbeſs led her from the church into
her own parlour, and there adminiſtered all
the conſolations, that religion and gentle
ſympathy can give. Emily ſtruggled againſt
the preſſure of grief; but the abbeſs, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
her attentively, ordered a bed to be
prepared, and recommended her to retire to
repoſe. She alſo kindly claimed her promiſe
to remain a few days at the convent, and Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
who had no wiſh to return to the cottage,
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0247300301:245"/>
the ſcene of all her ſufferings, had leiſure,
now that no immediate care preſſed upon her
attention, to feel the indiſpoſition, which
diſabled her from immediately travelling.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the maternal kindneſs of the
abbeſs, and the gentle attentions of the nuns
did all, that was poſſible, towards ſoothing
her ſpirits and reſtoring her health. But the
latter was too deeply wounded, through the
medium of her mind, to be quickly revived.
She lingered for ſome weeks at the convent,
under the inſluence of a ſlow fever, wiſhing
to return home, yet unable to go thither;
often even reluctant to leave the ſpot where
her father's relics were depoſited, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
ſoothing herſelf with the conſideration,
that, if ſhe died here, her remains would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
beſide thoſe of St. Aubert. In the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>while,
ſhe ſent letters to Madame Cheron
and to the old houſekeeper, informing them
of the ſad event, that had taken place, and
of her own ſituation. From her aunt ſhe
received an anſwer, abounding more in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place
condolement, than in traits of
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0247300301:246"/>
real ſorrow, which aſſured her, that a ſervant
ſhould be ſent to conduct her to La Vallèe,
for that her own time was ſo much occupied
by company, that ſhe had no leiſure to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
ſo long a journey. However Emily
might prefer La Vallèe to Tholouſe, ſhe
could not be inſenſible of the indecorous
and unkind conduct of her aunt, in ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her to return thither, where ſhe had no
longer a relation to conſole and protect her; a
conduct, which was the more culpable, ſince
St. Aubert had appointed Madame Cheron
the guardian of his orphan daughter.</p>
            <p>Madame Cheron's ſervant made the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance
of the good La Voiſin unneceſſary;
and Emily, who felt ſenſibly her obligations
to him, for all his kind attention to her late
father, as well as to herſelf, was glad to ſpare
him a long, and what, at his time of life,
muſt have been a troubleſome journey.</p>
            <p>During her ſtay at the convent, the peace
and ſanctity that reigned within, the tranquil
beauty of the ſcenery without, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0247300301:247"/>
attentions of the abbeſs and the nuns,
were circumſtances ſo ſoothing to her mind,
that they almoſt tempted her to leave a
world, where ſhe had loſt her deareſt friends,
and devote herſelf to the cloiſter, in a ſpot,
rendered ſacred to her by containing the tomb
of St. Aubert. The penſive enthuſiaſm, too,
ſo natural to her temper, had ſpread a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
illuſion over the ſanctified retirement of
a nun, that almoſt hid from her view the
ſelfiſhneſs of its ſecurity. But the touches,
which a melancholy fancy, ſlightly tinctured
with ſuperſtition, gave to the monaſtic ſcene,
began to fade, as her ſpirits revived, and
brought once more to her heart an image,
which had only tranſiently been baniſhed
thence. By this ſhe was ſilently awakened
to hope and comfort and ſweet affections;
viſions of happineſs gleamed faintly at a
diſtance, and, though ſhe knew them to be
illuſions, ſhe could not reſolve to ſhut them
out for ever. It was the remembrance of
Valancourt, of his taſte, his genius, and of
the countenance which glowed with both,
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0247300301:248"/>
that, perhaps, alone determined her to return
to the world. The grandeur and ſublimity
of the ſcenes, amidſt which they had firſt met,
had faſcinated her fancy, and had imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly
contributed to render Valancourt
more intereſting by ſeeming to communicate
to him ſomewhat of their own character.
The eſteem, too, which St. Aubert had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly
expreſſed for him, ſanctioned this
kindneſs; but, though his countenance and
manner had continually expreſſed his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
of her, he had no otherwiſe declared
it; and even the hope of ſeeing him again
was ſo diſtant, that ſhe was ſcarcely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
of it, ſtill leſs that it influenced her
conduct on this occaſion.</p>
            <p>It was ſeveral days after the arrival of
Madame Cheron's ſervant before Emily was
ſufficiently recovered to undertake the jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
to La Vallée. On the evening pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
her departure, ſhe went to the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to take leave of La Voiſin and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
and to make them a return for their
kindneſs. The old man ſhe found ſitting
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0247300301:249"/>
on a bench at his door, between his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
and his ſon-in-law, who was juſt return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
from his daily labour, and who was play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
upon a pipe, that, in tone, reſembled
an oboe. A flaſk of wine ſtood beſide the
old man, and, before him, a ſmall table with
fruit and bread, round which ſtood ſeveral
of his grandſons, fine roſy children, who
were taking their ſupper, as their mother
diſtributed it. On the edge of the little
green, that ſpread before the cottage, were
cattle and a few ſheep repoſing under the
trees. The landſcape was touched with the
mellow light of the evening ſun, whoſe long
ſlanting beams played through a viſta of
the woods, and lighted up the diſtant turrets
of the chateau. She pauſed a moment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe emerged from the ſhade, to gaze
upon the happy group before her—on the
complacency and eaſe of healthy age, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pictured
on the countenance of La Voiſin;
the maternal tenderneſs of Agnes, as ſhe
looked upon her children, and the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency
of infantine pleaſures, reflected in their
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0247300301:250"/>
ſmiles. Emily looked again at the venc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
old man, and at the cottage; the, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of her father roſe with full force upon
her mind, and ſhe haſtily ſtepped forward,
afraid to truſt herſelf with a longer pauſe.
She took an affectionate and affecting leave of
La Voiſin and his family; he ſeemed to love
her as his daughter, and ſhed tears; Emily
ſhed many. She avoided going into the cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
ſince ſhe knew it would revive emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſuch as ſhe could not now endure.</p>
            <p>One painful ſcene yet awaited her, for
ſhe determined to viſit again her father's
grave; and that ſhe might not be interrupted,
or obſerved in the indulgence of her melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
tenderneſs, ſhe deferred her viſit, till
every inhabitant of the convent, except the
nun who promiſed to bring her the key of
the church, ſhould be retired to reſt. Emily
remained in her chamber, till ſhe heard the
convent bell ſtrike twelve, when the nun
came, as ſhe had appointed, with the key of
a private door, that opened into the church,
and they deſcended together the narrow
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0247300301:251"/>
winding ſtair-caſe, that led thither. The
nun offered to accompany Emily to the
grave, adding, "It is melancholy to go
alone at this hour;" but the former, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her for the conſideration, could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to have any witneſs of her ſorrow; and
the ſiſter, having unlocked the door, gave
her the lamp. "You will remember, ſiſter,"
ſaid ſhe, "that in the eaſt aiſle, which you
muſt paſs, is a newly opened grave; hold
the light to the ground, that you may not
ſtumble over the looſe earth." Emily,
thanking her again, took the lamp, and,
ſtepping into the church, ſiſter Mariette de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted.
But Emily pauſed a moment at
the door; a ſudden fear came over her, and
ſhe returned to the foot of the ſtair-caſe,
where, as ſhe heard the ſteps of the nun aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending,
and, while ſhe held up the lamp, ſaw
her black veil waving over the ſpiral baluſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
ſhe was tempted to call her back. While
ſhe heſitated, the veil diſappeared, and, in
the next moment, aſhamed of her fears, ſhe
returned to the church. The cold air of the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0247300301:252"/>
aiſles chilled her, and their deep ſilence and
extent, feebly ſhone upon by the moon-light,
that ſtreamed through a diſtant gothic win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
would at any other time have awed her
into ſuperſtition; now, grief occupied all her
attention. She ſcarcely heard the whiſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
echoes of her own ſteps, or thought of
the open grave, till ſhe found herſelf almoſt
on its brink. A friar of the convent had
been buried there on the preceding evening,
and, as ſhe had ſat alone in her chamber at
twilight, ſhe heard, at diſtance, the monks
chanting the requiem for his ſoul. This
brought freſhly to her memory the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances
of her father's death; and, as the
voices, mingling with a low querulous peal of
the organ, ſwelled faintly, gloomy and affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
viſions had ariſen upon her mind. Now
ſhe remembered them, and, turning aſide to
avoid the broken ground, theſe recollections
made her paſs on with quicker ſteps to the
grave of St. Aubert, when in the moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
that fell athwart a remote part of the
aiſle, ſhe thought ſhe ſaw a ſhadow gliding
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0247300301:253"/>
between the pillars. She ſtopped to liſten,
and, not hearing any footſtep, believed
that her fancy had deceived her, and, no
longer apprehenſive of being obſerved, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded.
St. Aubert was buried beneath a
plain marble, bearing little more than his
name and the date of his birth and death,
near the foot of the ſtately monument of the
Villerois. Emily remained at his grave,
till a chime, that called the monks to early
prayers, warned her to retire; then, ſhe wept
over it a laſt farewel, and forced herſelf
from the ſpot. After this hour of melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
indulgence, ſhe was refreshed by a
deeper ſleep, than ſhe had experienced for a
long time, and, on awakening, her mind was
more tranquil and reſigned, than it had been
ſince St. Aubert's death.</p>
            <p>But, when the moment of her departure
from the convent arrived, all her grief re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
the memory of the dead, and the
kindneſs of the living attached her to the
place; and for the ſacred ſpot, where her
father's remains were interred, ſhe ſeemed to
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0247300301:254"/>
feel all thoſe tender affections which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
for home. The abbeſs repeated many
kind aſſurances of regard at their parting,
and preſſed her to return, if ever ſhe ſhould
find her condition elſewhere unpleaſant;
many of the nuns alſo expreſſed unaffected
regret at her departure, and Emily left the
convent with many tears, and followed by
ſincere wiſhes for her happineſs.</p>
            <p>She had travelled ſeveral leagues, before
the ſcenes of the country, through which
ſhe paſſed, had power to rouſe her for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
from the deep melancholy, into which
ſhe was ſunk, and, when they did, it was only
to remind her, that, on her laſt view of them,
St. Aubert was at her ſide, and to call up to
herremembrance the remarks he had delivered
on ſimilar ſcenery. Thus, without any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
occurrence, paſſed the day in languor
and dejection. She ſlept that night at a
town on the ſkirts of Languedoc, and, on
the following morning, entered Gaſcony.</p>
            <p>Towards the cloſe of this day, Emily
came within view of the plains in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0247300301:255"/>
of La Vallée, and the well-known
objects of former times began to preſs upon
her notice, and with them recollections,
that awakened all her tenderneſs and grief.
Often, while ſhe looked through her tears
upon the wild grandeur of the Pyrenées,
now varied with the rich lights and ſhadows
of evening, ſhe remembered, that, when laſt
ſhe ſaw them, her father partook with her
of the pleaſure they inſpired. Suddenly
ſome ſcene, which he had particularly
pointed out to her, would preſent itſelf,
and the ſick languor of deſpair would ſteal
upon her heart. "There!" ſhe would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim,
"there are the very cliffs, there the
wood of pines, which he looked at with ſuch
delight, as we paſſed this road together for
the laſt time. There, too, under the crag
of that mountain, is the cottage, peeping
from among the cedars, which he bade me
remember, and copy with my pencil. O
my father, ſhall I never ſee you more!"</p>
            <p>As ſhe drew near the chateau, theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
memorials of paſt times multiplied.
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0247300301:256"/>
At length, the chateau itſelf appeared amid
the glowing beauty of St. Aubert's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
landſcape. This was an object,
which called for fortitude, not for tears;
Emily dried hers, and prepared to meet
with calmneſs the trying moment of her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
to that home, where there was no
longer a parent to welcome her. "Yes,"
ſaid ſhe, "let me not forget the leſſons he
has taught me! How often he has pointed
out the neceſſity of reſiſting even virtuous
ſorrow; how often we have admired toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
the greatneſs of a mind, that can at
once ſuffer and reaſon! O my father! if
you are permitted to look down upon, your
child, it will pleaſe you to ſee, that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>members,
and endeavours to practiſe, the
precepts you have given her."</p>
            <p>A turn on the road now allowed a nearer
view of the chateau, the chimneys, tipped
with light, riſing from, behind St. Aubert's
favourite oaks, whoſe foliage partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
the lower part of the building. Emily
could not ſuppreſs a heavy ſigh. "This,
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0247300301:257"/>
too, was his favourite hour," ſaid ſhe, as
ſhe gazed upon the long evening ſhadows,
ſtretched athwart the landſcape. "How
deep the repoſe, how lovely the ſcene!
lovely and tranquil as in former days!"</p>
            <p>Again ſhe reſiſted the preſſure of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
till her ear caught the gay melody of
the dance, which ſhe had ſo often liſtened
to, as ſhe walked with St. Aubert, on the
margin of the Garonne, when all her forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
forſook her, and ſhe continued to
weep, till the carriage ſtopped at the little
gate, that opened upon what was now her
own territory. She raiſed her eyes on the
ſudden ſtopping of the carriage, and ſaw
her father's old houſekeeper coming to open
the gate. Manchon alſo came running,
and barking before her; and, when his
young miſtreſs alighted, fawned, and played
round her, gaſping with joy."</p>
            <p>"Dear ma'amſelle!" ſaid Thereſa, and
pauſed, and looked as iſ ſhe would have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered
ſomething of condolement to Emily,
whoſe tears now prevented reply. The dog
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0247300301:258"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="247" facs="tcp:0247300301:259"/>
               <gap reason="duplicate" extent="1 page">
                  <desc>〈1 page duplicate〉</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:0247300301:260"/>
ſtill fawned and ran round her, and then
flew towards the carriage, with a ſhort
quick bark. "Ah, ma'amſlle!—my poor
maſter!" ſaid Thereſa, whoſe feelings were
more awakened than her delicacy, "Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chon's
gone to look for him." Emily
ſobbed aloud; and, on looking towards
the carriage, which ſtill ſtood with the door
open, ſaw the animal ſpring into it, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
leap out, and then with his noſe on
the ground run round the horſes.</p>
            <p>"Don't cry ſo, ma'amſelle," ſaid The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa,
"it breaks my heart to ſee you." The
dog now came running to Emily, then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to the carriage, and then back again
to her, whining and diſcontented. "Poor
rogue!" ſaid Thereſa, "thou haſt loſt thy
maſter, thou mayſt well cry! But come,
my dear young lady, be comforted. What
ſhall I get to refreſh you?" Emily gave
her hand to the old ſervant, and tried to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
her grief, while ſhe made ſome kind
enquiries concerning her health. But ſhe
ſtill lingered in the walk which led to the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0247300301:261"/>
chateau, for within was no perſon to meet her
with the kiſs of affection; her own heart no
longer palpitated with impatient joy to
meet again the well-known ſmile, and ſhe
dreaded to ſee objects, which would recall
the full remembrance of her ſormer happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
She moved ſlowly towards the door,
pauſed, went on, and pauſed again. How
ſilent, how forſaken, how forlorn did the
chateau appear! Trembling to enter it, yet
blaming herſelf for delaying what ſhe could
not avoid, she, at length, patted into the
hall; croſſed it with a hurried ſtep, as if
afraid to look round, and opened the door
of that room, which ſhe was wont to call
her own. The gloom of evening gave ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
to its ſilent and deſerted air. The
chairs, the tables, every article of furniture,
ſo familiar to her in happier times, ſpoke
eloquently to her heart. She ſeated herſelf,
without immediately obſerving it, in a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,
which opened upon the garden, and
where St. Aubert had often ſat with her,
watching the ſun retire from the rich and
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:0247300301:262"/>
extenſive proſpect, that appeared beyond
the groves.</p>
            <p>Having indulged her tears for ſome time,
ſhe became more compoſed; and, when
Thereſa, after ſeeing the baggage depoſited
in her lady's room, again appeared, ſhe had
ſo far recovered her ſpirits, as to be able to
converſe with her.</p>
            <p>"I have made up the green bed for you,
ma'amſelle," ſaid Thereſa, as ſhe ſet the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee
upon the table. "I thought you would
like it better than your own now; but I
little thought this day month, that you
would come back alone. A-well-a-day!
the news almoſt broke my heart, when
it did come. Who would have believed,
that my poor maſter, when he went from,
home, would never return again!" Emily
hid her face with her handkerchief, and
waved her hand.</p>
            <p>"Do taſte the coffee, ſaid Thereſa.
"My dear young lady, be comforted—we
muſt all die. My dear maſter is a ſaint
above." Emily took the handkerchief
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0247300301:263"/>
from her face, and raiſed her eyes full of
tears towards heaven; ſoon after ſhe dried
them, and, in a calm, but tremulous voice,
began to enquire concerning ſome of her
late father's penſioners.</p>
            <p>"Alas-a-day!" ſaid Thereſa, as ſhe
poured out the coſſee, and handed it to her
miſtreſs, "all that could come, have been
here every day to enquire after you and my
maſter." She then proceeded to tell, that
ſome were dead whom they had left well;
and others, who were ill, had recovered.
"And ſee, ma'amſelle," added Thereſa,
"there is old Mary coming up the garden
now; ſhe has looked every day theſe three
years as if ſhe would die, yet ſhe is alive ſtill.
She has ſeen the chaiſe at the door, and
knows you are come home."</p>
            <p>The ſight of this poor old woman would
have been too much for Emily, and ſhe beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
Thereſa would go and tell her, that ſhe
was too ill to ſee any perſon that night.
"To-morrow I ſhall be better, perhaps;
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0247300301:264"/>
but give her this token of my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance."</p>
            <p>Emily ſat for ſome time, given up to ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.
Not an object, on which her eye
glanced, but awakened ſome remembrance,
that led immediately to the ſubject of her
grief. Her favourite plants, which St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
had taught her to nurſe; the little
drawings, that adorned the room, which
his taſte had inſtructed her to execute; the
books, that he had ſelected for her uſe, and
which they had read together; her muſical
inſtruments, whose ſounds he loved ſo well,
and which he ſometimes awakened himſelf—every
object gave new force to ſorrow.
At length, ſhe rouſed herſelf from this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
indulgence, and, ſummoning all
her reſolution, ſtepped forward to go into
thoſe forlorn rooms, which, though ſhe
dreaded to enter, ſhe knew would yet more
powerfully affect her, if ſhe delayed to viſit
them.</p>
            <p>Having paſſed through the green-houſe,
her courage for a moment forſook her, when
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0247300301:265"/>
ſhe opened the door of the library; and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
the ſhade, which evening and the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liage
of the trees near the windows threw
acroſs the room, heightened the ſolemnity of
her feelings on entering that apartment, where
every thing ſpoke of her father. There
was an arm-chair, in which he uſed to
ſit; ſhe ſhrunk when ſhe obſerved it, for ſhe
had ſo often ſeen him ſeated there, and the
idea of him roſe ſo diſtinctly to her mind,
that ſhe almoſt fancied ſhe ſaw him before
her. But ſhe checked the illuſions of a
diſtempered imagination, though ſhe could
not ſubdue a certain degree of awe, which
now mingled with her emotions. She
walked ſlowly to the chair, and ſeated her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in it; there was a reading-deſk before
it, on which lay a book open, as it had been
left by her father. It was ſome moments
before ſhe recovered courage enough to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine
it; and, when ſhe looked at the open
page, ſhe immediately recollected, that St.
Aubert, on the evening before his departure
from the chateau, had read to her ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0247300301:266"/>
from this his favourite author. The
circumſtance now affected her extremely;
ſhe looked at the page, wept, and looked
again. To her the book appeared ſacred
and invaluable, and ſhe would not have
moved it, or cloſed the page, which he had
left open, for the treaſures of the Indies.
Still ſhe ſat before the deſk, and could not
reſolve to quit it, though the increaſing
gloom, and the profound ſilence of the
apartment, revived a degree of painful awe.
Her thoughts dwelt on the probable ſtate
of departed ſpirits, and ſhe remembered the
affecting converſation, which had paſſed
between St. Aubert and La Voiſin, on the
night preceding his death.</p>
            <p>As ſhe muſed ſhe ſaw the door ſlowly
open, and a ruſtling ſound in a remote part
of the room ſtartled her. Through the
duſk ſhe thought ſhe perceived ſomething
move. The ſubject ſhe had been conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and the preſent tone of her ſpirits,
which made her imagination reſpond to
every impreſſion of her ſenſes, gave her a
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0247300301:267"/>
ſudden terror of ſomething ſupernatural.
She ſat for a moment motionleſs, and then,
her diſſipated reaſon returning, "What
ſhould I fear?" ſaid ſhe. "It the ſpirits
of thoſe we love ever return to us, it is in
kindneſs."</p>
            <p>The ſilence, which again reigned, made
her aſhamed of her late fears, and ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
that her imagination had deluded
her, or that ſhe had heard one of thoſe unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable
noiſes, which ſometimes occur in
old houſes. The ſame ſound, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned;
and, diſtinguiſhing ſomething mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
towards her, and in the next inſtant
preſs beſide her into the chair, ſhe ſhrieked;
but her fleeting ſenſes were inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called,
on perceiving that it was Manchon
who ſat by her, and who now licked her
hands affectionately.</p>
            <p>Perceiving her ſpirits unequal to the talk
ſhe had aſſigned herſelf of viſiting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
rooms of the chateau, this night,
when ſhe left the library, ſhe walked into the
garden, and down to the terrace, that over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hung
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0247300301:268"/>
the river. The ſun was now ſet; but,
under the dark branches of the almond
trees, was ſeen the ſaffron glow of the weſt,
ſpreading beyond the twilight of middle
air. The bat ſlitted ſilently by; and, now
and then, the mourning note of the nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gale
was heard. The circumſtances of the
hour brought to her recolleſtion ſome lines,
which ſhe had once heard St. Aubert recite
on this very ſpot, and ſhe had now a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
pleſure in repeating them.</p>

Emily, wandering on, came to St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert's
favourite plane-tree, where ſo often,
at this hour, they had ſat beneath the ſhade
together, and with her dear mother ſo
often had converſed on the ſubject of a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
ſtate. How often, too, had her father
expreſſed the comfort he derived from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving,
that they ſhould meet in another
world! Emily, overcome by theſe recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
left the plane-tree, and, as ſhe leaned
penſively on the wall of the terrace, ſhe
obſerved a group of peaſants dancing gaily
on the banks of the Garonne, which ſpread
in broad expanſe below, and reflected
the evening light. What a contraſt they
formed to the deſolate, unhappy Emily!
They were gay and <hi>debonnaire,</hi> as they were
wont to be when ſhe, too, was gay—when
St. Aubert uſed to liſten to their merry mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic,
with a countenance beaming pleaſure
and benevolence. Emily, having looked
for a moment on this ſprightly band, turned
away, unable to bear the remembrances it
excited; but where, alas! could ſhe turn,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0247300301:270"/>
and not meet new objects to give acuteneſs
to grief?</p>
            <p>As ſhe walked ſlowly towards the houſe,
ſhe was met by Thereſa. "Dear ma'am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle,"
ſaid ſhe, "I have been ſeeking you
up and down this half hour, and was afraid
ſome accident had happened to you. How
can you like to wander about ſo in this
night air! Do come into the houſe. Think
what my poor maſter would have ſaid, if
he could ſee you. I am ſure, when my
dear lady died, no gentleman could take it
more to heart than he did, yet you know he
ſeldom ſhed a tear."</p>
            <p>"Pray, Thereſa, ceaſe," ſaid Emily, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to interrupt this ill-judged, but well-mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
harangue; Thereſa's loquacity, however,
was not to be ſilenced ſo eaſily. "And
when you uſed to grieve ſo," ſhe added,
"he often told you how wrong it was—for
that my miſtreſs was happy. And, if ſhe
was happy, I am ſure he is ſo too; for the
prayers of the poor, they ſay, reach hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven."
During this ſpeech, Emily had
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:0247300301:271"/>
walked ſilently into the chateau, and The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa
lighted her acroſs the hall into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſitting parlour, where ſhe had laid the
cloth, with one ſolitary knife and fork, for
ſupper. Emily was in the room before ſhe
perceived that it was not her own apartment,
but ſhe checked the emotion which inclined
her to leave it, and ſeated herſelf quietly by
the little ſupper table. Her father's hat
hung upon the oppoſite wall; while ſhe
gazed at it, a faintneſs came over her.
Thereſa looked at her, and then at the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
on which her eyes were ſettled, and
went to remove it; but Emily waved her
hand—"No," ſaid ſhe, "let it remain. I
am going to my chamber." "Nay, ma'am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle,
ſupper is ready." "I cannot take
it," replied Emily, "I will go to my room,
and try to ſleep. To-morrow I ſhall be
better."</p>
            <p>"This is poor doings!" ſaid Thereſa.
"Dear lady! do take ſome food! I have
dreſſed a pheaſant, and a fine one it is. Old
Monſieur Barreaux ſent it this morning, for
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0247300301:272"/>
I ſaw him yeſterday, and told him you were
coming. And I know nobody that ſeemed
more concerned, when he heard the ſad
news, than he."</p>
            <p>"Did he?" ſaid Emily, in a tender voice,
while ſhe felt her poor heart warmed for a
moment by a ray of ſympathy.</p>
            <p>At length, her ſpirits were entirely over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come,
and ſhe retired to her room.</p>

            <p>EMILY, ſome time after her return to
La Vallée, received letters from her aunt,
Madame Cheron, in which, after ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-place
condolement and advice, ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
her to Tholouſe, and added, that, as
her late brother had entruſted Emily's <hi>edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation</hi>
to her, ſhe ſhould conſider herſelf
bound to overlook her conduct. Emily, at
this time, wiſhed only to remain at La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lée,
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0247300301:274"/>
in the ſcenes of her early happineſs
now rendered infinitely dear to her, as the
late reſidence of thoſe, whom ſhe had loſt
for ever, where ſhe could weep unobſerved,
retrace their ſteps, and remember each mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
particular of their manners. But ſhe
was equally anxious to avoid the diſpleaſure
of Madame Cheron.</p>
            <p>Though her affection would not ſuffer her
to queſtion, even a moment, the propriety
of St. Aubert's conduct in appointing Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
for her guardian, ſhe was ſenſible, that
this ſtep had made her happineſs depend,
in a great degree, on the humour of her aunt.
In her reply, ſhe begged permiſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main,
at preſent, at La Vallée, mentioning
the extreme dejection of her ſpirits, and the
neceſſity ſhe felt for quiet and retirement to
reſtore them. Theſe ſhe knew were not to
be found at Madame Cheron's, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations
led her into a life of diſſipation,
which her ample fortune encouraged; and,
having given her anſwer, ſhe felt ſomewhat
more at eaſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:0247300301:275"/>
In the firſt days of her affliction, ſhe was
viſited by Monſieur Barreaux, a ſincere
mourner for St. Aubert. "I may well la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
my friend," ſaid he, "for I ſhall never
meet with his reſemblance. If I could have
found ſuch a man in what is called ſociety,
I ſhould not have left it."</p>
            <p>M. Barreaux's admiration of her father
endeared him extremely to Emily, whoſe
heart found almoſt its firſt relief in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of her parents, with a man, whom ſhe
ſo much revered, and who, though with
ſuch an ungracious appearance, poſſeſſed ſo
much goodneſs of heart and delicacy of
mind.</p>
            <p>Several weeks paſſed away in quiet retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and Emily's affliction began to ſoften
into melancholy. She could bear to read
the books ſhe had before read with her
father; to ſit in his chair in the library—to
watch the flowers his hand had planted—to
awaken the tones of that inſtrument his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers
had preſſed, and ſometimes even to play
his favourite air.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0247300301:276"/>
When her mind had recovered from the
firſt ſhock of affliction, perceiving the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
of yielding to indolence, and that activity
alone could reſtore its tone, ſhe ſcrupulouſly
endeavoured to paſs all her hours in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
And it was now that ſhe under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood
the full value of the education ſhe had
received from St. Aubert, for in cultivating
her underſtanding he had ſecured her an
aſylum from indolence, without recourſe to
diſſipation, and rich and varied amuſement
and information, independent of the ſociety,
from which her ſituation ſecluded her. Nor
were the good effects of this education con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to ſelfiſh advantages, ſince, St. Aubert
having nouriſhed every amiable quality of
her heart, it now expanded in benevolence
to all around her, and taught her, when ſhe
could not remove the misfortunes of others,
at lead to ſoften them by ſympathy and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs;—a
benevolence that taught her to
feel for all, that could ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Madame Cheron returned no anſwer to
Emily's letter, who began to hope, that ſhe
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0247300301:277"/>
ſhould be permitted to remain ſome time
longer in her retirement, and her mind had
now ſo far recovered its ſtrength, that ſhe
ventured to view the ſcenes, which moſt
powerfully recalled the images of part times.
Among theſe was the fiſhing-houſe; and,
to indulge ſtill more the affectionate melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
of the viſit, ſhe took thither her lute,
that ſhe might again hear there the tones, to
which St. Aubert and her mother had ſo
often delighted to liſten. She went alone,
and at that ſtill hour of the evening, which
is ſo ſoothing to fancy and to grief. The
laſt time ſhe had been here ſhe was in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
with Monſieur and Madame St. Aubert,
a few days preceding that, on which
the latter was ſeized with a fatal illneſs.
Now, when Emily again entered the woods,
that ſurrounded the building, they awakened
ſo forcibly the memory of former times,
that her reſolution yielded for a moment to
exceſs of grief. She ſtopped, leaned for
ſupport againſt a tree, and wept for ſome
minutes, before ſhe had recovered herſelf
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0247300301:278"/>
ſufficiently to proceed. The little path, that
led to the building, was overgrown with
graſs, and the flowers which St. Aubert had
ſcattered careleſsly along the border were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
choked with weeds—the tall thiſtle—the
fox-glove, and the nettle. She often
pauſed to look on the deſolate ſpot, now ſo
ſilent and forſaken, and when, with a trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
hand, ſhe opened the door of the fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-houſe,
"Ah!" ſaid ſhe, "every thing—every
thing remains as when I left it laſt—left
it with thoſe who never muſt return!"
She went to a window, that overhung the
rivulet, and, leaning over it, with her eyes
fixed on the current, was ſoon loſt in melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
reverie. The lute ſhe had brought
lay forgotten beſide her; the mournful ſigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
of the breeze, as it waved the high pines
above, and its ſofter whiſpers among the
oſiers, that bowed upon the banks below,
was a kind of muſic more in uniſon with
her feelings. It did not vibrate on the
chords of unhappy memory, but was ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to the heart as the voice of Pity. She
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0247300301:279"/>
continued to muſe, unconſcious of the gloom
of evening, and that the ſun's laſt light
trembled on the heights above, and would
probably have remained ſo much longer, if
a ſudden footſtep, without the building, had
not alarmed her attention, and firſt made
her recollect that ſhe was unprotected. In
the next moment, a door opened, and a
ſtranger appeared, who ſtopped on perceive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Emily, and then began to apologize for
his intruſion. But Emily, at the ſound of
his voice, loſt her fear in a ſtronger emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
its tones were familiar to her ear, and,
though ſhe could not readily diſtinguiſh
through the duſk the features of the perſon
who ſpoke, ſhe felt a remembrance too
ſtrong to be diſtruſted.</p>
            <p>He repeated his apology, and Emily then ſaid
ſomething in reply, when the ſtranger,
eagerly advancing, exclaimed, "Good God!
can it be—ſurely I am not miſtaken—ma'amſelle
St. Aubert—is it not?"</p>
            <p>"It is indeed," ſaid Emily, who was
confirmed in her firſt conjecture, for ſhe
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0247300301:280"/>
now diſtinguiſhed the countenance of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
lighted up with ſtill more than its
uſual animation. A thouſand painful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collections
crowded to her mind, and the
effort, which ſhe made to ſupport herſelf,
only ſerved to increaſe her agitation. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
meanwhile, having enquired anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
after her health, and expreſſed his
hopes, that M. St. Aubert had found benefit
from travelling, learned from the flood of
tears, which ſhe could no longer repreſs,
the fatal truth. He led her to a ſeat, and
ſat down by her, while Emily continued to
weep, and Valancourt to hold the hand,
which ſhe was unconſcious he had taken,
till it was wet with the tears, which grief for
St. Aubert and ſympathy for herſelf had
called forth.</p>
            <p>"I feel," ſaid he at length, "I feel how
inſufficient all attempt at conſolation muſt
be on this ſubject. I can only mourn with
you, for I cannot doubt the ſource of your tears.
Would to God I were miſtaken!"</p>
            <p>Emily could ſtill anſwer only by tears,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0247300301:281"/>
till ſhe roſe, and begged they might leave
the melancholy ſpot, when Valancourt,
though he ſaw her feebleneſs, could not
offer to detain her, but took her arm with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
his, and led her from the fiſhing-houſe.
They walked ſilently through the woods,
Valancourt anxious to know, yet fearing to
aſk any particulars concerning St. Aubert;
and Emily too much diſtreſſed to converſe.
After ſome time, however, ſhe acquired for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
enough to ſpeak of her father, and to
give a brief account of the manner of his
death; during which recital Valancourt's
countenance betrayed ſtrong emotion, and,
when he heard that St. Aubert had died on
the road, and that Emily had been left
among ſtrangers, he preſſed her hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
his, and involuntarily exclaimed,
"Why was I not there!" but in the next
moment recollected himſelf, for he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
returned to the mention of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
till, perceiving that her ſpirits were
exhauſted, he gradually changed the ſubject,
and ſpoke of himſelf. Emily thus learned,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0247300301:282"/>
that, after they had parted, he had wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered,
for ſome time, along the ſhores of
the Mediterranean, and had then returned
through Languedoc into Gaſcony, which
was his native province, and where he uſually
reſided.</p>
            <p>When he had concluded his little narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
he ſunk into a ſilence, which Emily was
not diſpoſed to interrupt, and it continued,
till they reached the gate of the chateau,
when he ſtopped, as if he had known
this to be the limit of his walk. Here, ſaying,
that it was his intention to return to Eſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viere
on the following day, he aſked her if
ſhe would permit him to take leave of her
in the morning; and Emily, perceiving that
ſhe could not reject an ordinary civility,
without expreſſing by her refuſal an expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of ſomething more, was compelled to
anſwer, that ſhe ſhould be at home.</p>
            <p>She paſſed a melancholy evening, during
which the retroſpect of all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened,
ſince ſhe had ſeen Valancourt, would
riſe to her imagination; and the ſcene of her
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0247300301:283"/>
father's death appeared in tints as freſh, as
if it had paſſed on the preceding day. She
remembered particularly the earneſt and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn
manner, in which he had required her
to deſtroy the manuſcript papers, and, awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kening
from the lethargy, in which ſorrow
had held her, ſhe was ſhocked to think ſhe
had not yet obeyed him, and determined,
that another day ſhould not reproach her
with the neglect.</p>

            <p>ON the next morning, Emily ordered a
fire to be lighted in the ſtove of the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
where St. Aubert uſed to ſleep; and,
as ſoon as ſhe had breakfaſted, went thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to burn the papers. Having faſtened
the door to prevent interruption, ſhe opened
the cloſet where they were concealed, as
ſhe entered which, ſhe felt an emotion of
unuſual awe, and ſtood for ſome moments
ſurveying it, trembling, and almoſt afraid
to remove the board. There was a great
chair in one corner of the cloſet, and, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
to it, ſtood the table, at which ſhe
had ſeen her father ſit, on the evening
that preceded his departure, looking over,
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0247300301:285"/>
with ſo much emotion, what ſhe believed
to be theſe very papers.</p>
            <p>The ſolitary life, which Emily had led
of late, and the melancholy ſubjects, on
which ſhe had ſuffered her thoughts to dwell,
had rendered her at times ſenſible to the
"thick-coming fancies" of a mind greatly
enervated. It was lamentable, that her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
underſtanding ſhould have yielded,
even for a moment, to the reveries of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition,
or rather to thoſe ſtarts of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,
which deceive the ſenſes into what
can be called nothing leſs than momentary
madneſs. Inſtances of this temporary failure
of mind had more than once occurred ſince
her return home; particularly when, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
through this lonely manſion in the
evening twilight, ſhe had been alarmed by
appearances, which would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen
in her more cheerful days. To this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
ſtate of her nerves may be attributed,
what, ſhe imagined, when, her eyes glancing
a ſecond time on the arm-chair, which
ſtood in an obſcure part of the cloſet, the
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0247300301:286"/>
countenance of her dead father appeared
there. Emily ſtood fixed for a moment to
the floor, after which ſhe left the cloſet. Her
ſpirits, however, ſoon returned; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
herſelf with the weakneſs of thus
ſuffering interruption in an act of ſerious
importance, and again opened the door.
By the directions which St. Aubert had
given her, ſhe readily found the board he
had deſcribed in an oppoſite corner of the
cloſet, near the window; ſhe diſtinguiſhed
alſo the line he had mentioned, and, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
it as he had bade her, it ſlid down,
and diſcloſed the bundle of papers, together
with ſome ſcattered ones, and the purſe of
louis. With a trembling hand ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
them, replaced the board, pauſed a
moment, and was riſing from the floor,
when, on looking up, there appeared to
her alarmed fancy the ſame countenance in
the chair. The illuſion, another inſtance
of the unhappy effect which ſolitude and
grief had gradually produced upon her
mind, ſubdued her ſpirits; ſhe ruſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:0247300301:287"/>
into the chamber, and ſunk almoſt
ſenſeleſs into a chair. Returning reaſon
ſoon overcame the dreadful, but pitiable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
of imagination, and ſhe turned to the
papers, though ſtill with ſo little recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that her eyes involuntarily ſettled on
the writing of ſome looſe ſheets, which lay
open; and ſhe was unconſcious, that ſhe
was tranſgreſſing her father's ſtrict injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
till a ſentence of dreadful import
awakened her attention and her memory to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.
She haſtily put the papers from
her; but the words, which had rouſed
equally her curioſity and terror, ſhe could not
diſmiſs from her thoughts. So powerfully
had they affected her, that ſhe even could
not reſolve to deſtroy the papers immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately;
and the more ſhe dwelt on the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance,
the more it inflamed her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
Urged by the moſt forcible, and
apparently the moſt neceſſary, curioſity to
enquire farther, concerning the terrible and
myſterious ſubject, to which ſhe had ſeen
an alluſion, ſhe began to lament her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0247300301:288"/>
to deſtroy the papers. For a moment,
ſhe even doubted, whether it could juſtly
be obeyed, in contradiction to ſuch reaſons
as there appeared to be for further informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
But the deluſion was momentary.</p>
            <p>"I have given a ſolemn promiſe," ſaid
ſhe, "to obſerve a ſolemn injunction, and
it is not my buſineſs to argue, but to obey.
Let me haſten to remove the temptation,
that would deſtroy my innocence, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter
my life with the conſciouſneſs of irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediable
guilt, while I have, ſtrength to, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
it."</p>
            <p>Thus re-animated with a ſenſe of her
duty, ſhe completed the triumph of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity
over temptation, more forcible than
any ſhe had ever known, and conſigned the
papers to the flames. Her eyes watched
them as they ſlowly conſumed, ſhe ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
at the recollection of the ſentence ſhe
had juſt ſeen, and at the certainty, that the
only opportunity of explaining it was then
paſſing away for ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="277" facs="tcp:0247300301:289"/>
It was long after this, that ſhe recollected
the purſe; and as ſhe was depoſiting it, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opened,
in a cabinet, perceiving that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
ſomething of a ſize larger than coin,
ſhe examined it. "His hand depoſited
them here," ſaid ſhe, as ſhe kiſſed ſome
pieces of the coin, and wetted them with
her tears, "his hand—which is now duſt!"
At the bottom of the purſe was a ſmall
packet, having taken out which, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded
paper after paper, ſhe found to be an
ivory caſe, containing, the miniature of a—lady!
She ſtarted—"The ſame," ſaid
ſhe, "my father, wept over!" On exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
the countenance ſhe could recollect
no perſon that it reſembled. It was of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common
beauty, and was characterized by
an expreſſion of ſweetneſs, ſhaded with, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,
and tempered by reſignation.</p>
            <p>St. Aubert had given no directions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
this picture, nor had even named
it; ſhe, therefore, thought herſelf juſtified
in preſerving it. More than once remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering
his manner, when he had ſpoken of
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0247300301:290"/>
the Marchioneſs of Villeroi, ſhe felt inclined
to believe that this was her reſemblance;
yet there appeared no reaſon why he ſhould
have preſerved a picture of that lady, or,
having preſerved it, why he ſhould lament
over it in a manner ſo ſtriking and affecting
as ſhe had witneſſed on the night preceding
his departure.</p>
            <p>Emily ſtill gazed on the countenance,
examining its features, but ſhe knew not
where to detect the charm that captivated
her attention, and inſpired ſentiments of
ſuch love and pity. Dark brown hair
played careleſsly along the open forehead;
the noſe was rather inclined to aquiline;
the lips ſpoke in a ſmile, but it was a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
one; the eyes were blue, and were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
upwards with an expreſſion of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
meekneſs, while the ſoft cloud of the
brow ſpoke the fine ſenſibility of the temper.</p>
            <p>Emily was rouſed from the muſing mood
into which the picture had thrown her, by
the cloſing of the garden gate; and, on
turning her eyes to the window, ſhe ſaw
Valancourt coming towards the chateau.
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:0247300301:291"/>
Her ſpirits agitated by the ſubjects that
had lately occupied her mind, ſhe felt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared
to ſee him, and remained a few
moments in the chamber to recover her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
            <p>When ſhe met him in the parlour, ſhe was
ſtruck with the change that appeared in his
air and countenance ſince they had parted
in Rouſillon, which twilight and the diſtreſs
ſhe ſuffered on the preceding evening had
prevented her from obſerving. But de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
and languor diſappeared, for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
in the ſmile that now enlightened his
countenance, on perceiving her. "You
ſee," ſaid he, "I have availed myſelf of the
permiſſion with which you honoured me—of
bidding <hi>you</hi> farewell, whom I had
the happineſs of meeting only yeſterday."</p>
            <p>Emily ſmiled faintly, and, anxious to ſay
ſomething, aſked if he had been long in Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony.
"A few days only," replied Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
while a bluſh paſſed over his cheek
"I engaged in a long ramble after I
had the misfortune of parting with the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0247300301:292"/>
friends who had made my wanderings
among the Pyrenees ſo delightful."</p>
            <p>A tear came to Emily's eye, as Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
ſaid this, which he obſerved; and,
anxious to draw off her attention from the
remembrance that had occaſioned it, as
well as ſhocked at his own thoughtleſſneſs,
he began to ſpeak on other ſubjects; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
his admiration of the chateau, and
its proſpects. Emily, who felt ſomewhat
embarraſſed how to ſupport a converſation,
was glad of ſuch an opportunity to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue
it on indifferent topics. They walked
down to the terrace, where Valancourt was
charmed with the river ſcenery, and the
views over the oppoſite ſhores of Guienne.</p>
            <p>As he leaned on the wall of the terrace,
watching the rapid current of the Garonne,
"I was a few weeks ago," ſaid he, "at the
ſource of this noble river; I had not then
the happineſs of knowing you, or I ſhould
have regretted your abſence—it was a ſcene
ſo exactly ſuited to your taſte. It riſes in a
part of the Pyrenées, ſtill wilder and more
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0247300301:293"/>
ſublime I think, than any we paſſed in the
way to Rouſillon." He then deſcribed its
fall among thé precipices of the mountains,
where its waters, augmented by the ſtreams
that deſcend from the ſnowy ſummits
around, ruſh into the Vallée d'Aran, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
whoſe romantic heights it foams
along, purſuing its way to the north weſt
till it emerges upon the plains of Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc.
Then, waſhing the walls of Tholouſe,
and turning again to the north weſt, it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes
a milder character, as it fertilizes the
paſtures of Gaſcony and Guienne, in its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs
to the Bay of Biſcay.</p>
            <p>Emily and Valancourt talked of the ſcenes
they had paſſed among the Pyrenean Alps;
as he ſpoke of which there was often a tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
tenderneſs in his voice, and ſometimes
he expatiated on them with all the fire of
genius, ſometimes would appear ſcarcely
conſcious of the topic, though he continued
to ſpeak. This ſubject recalled forcibly to
Emily the idea of her father, whoſe image
appeared in every landſcape which Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0247300301:294"/>
particularized, whoſe remarks dwelt
upon her memory, and whoſe enthuſiaſm
ſtill glowed in her heart. Her ſilence, at
length, reminded Valancourt how nearly
his converſation approached to the occaſion
of her grief, and he changed the ſubject,
though for one ſcarcely leſs affecting to
Emily. When he admired the grandeur of
the plane-tree, that ſpread its wide branches
over the terrace, and under whoſe ſhade they
now ſat, ſhe remembered how often ſhe had
ſat thus with St. Aubert, and heard him ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
the ſame admiration.</p>
            <p>"This was a favourite tree with my dear
father," ſaid ſhe; "he uſed to love to ſit
under its foliage with his family about him,
in the fine evenings of ſummer."</p>
            <p>Valancourt underſtood her feelings, and
was ſilent; had ſhe raiſed her eyes from the
ground ſhe would have ſeen tears in his.
He roſe, and leaned on the wall of the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race,
from which, in a few moments, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to his ſeat, then roſe again, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
to be greatly agitated; while Emily
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0247300301:295"/>
found her ſpirits ſo much depreſſed, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of her attempts to renew the converſation
were ineffectual. Valancourt again ſat down,
but was ſtill ſilent, and trembled. At length
he ſaid, with a heſitating voice, "This lovely
ſcene!—I am going to leave—to leave you—perhaps
for ever! Theſe moments may never
return; I cannot reſolve to neglect, though
I ſcarcely dare to avail myſelf of them. Let
me, however, without offending the delicacy
of your ſorrow, venture to declare the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
I muſt always feel of your goodneſs,—O!
that at ſome future period I might be
permitted to call it love!"</p>
            <p>Emily's emotion would not ſuffer her to
reply; and Valancourt, who now ventured
to look up, obſerving her countenance
change, expected to ſee her faint, and made
an involuntary effort to ſupport her, which
recalled Emily to a ſenſe of her ſituation,
and to an exertion of her ſpirits. Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
did not appear to notice her indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition,
but, when he ſpoke again, his voice
told the tendereſt love. "I will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,"
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0247300301:296"/>
he added, "to intrude this ſubject
longer upon your attention at this time, but I
may, perhaps, be permitted to mention, that
theſe parting moments would loſe much of
their bitterneſs if I might be allowed to hope
the declaration I have made would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
me from your preſence in future."</p>
            <p>Emily made another effort to overcome
the confuſion of her thoughts, and to ſpeak.
She feared to truſt the preference her heart
acknowledged towards Valancourt, and to
give him any encouragement for hope, on
ſo ſhort an acquaintance. For though in
this narrow period ſhe had obſerved much
that was admirable in his taſte and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and though theſe obſervations had been
ſanctioned by the opinion of her father, they
were not ſufficient teſtimonies of his general
worth to determine her upon a ſubject ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
important to her future happineſs
as that, which now ſolicited her attention.
Yet, though the thought of diſmiſſing Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
was ſo very painful to her, that
ſhe could ſcarcely endure to pauſe upon it,
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0247300301:297"/>
the conſiouſneſs of this made her fear the
partiality of her judgment, and heſitate ſtill
more to encourage that ſuit, for which her
own heart too tenderly pleaded. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily
of Valancourt, if not his circumſtances,
had been known to her father, and known to
be unexceptionable. Of his circumſtances,
Valancourt himſelf hinted as far as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacy
would permit, when he ſaid he had at
preſent little elſe to offer but an heart, that
adored her. He had ſolicited only for a
diſtant hope, and ſhe could not reſolve to
forbid, though ſhe ſcarcely dared to permit
it; at length, ſhe acquired courage to ſay,
that ſhe muſt think herſelf honoured by the
good opinion of any perſon, whom her father
had eſteemed.</p>
            <p>"And was I, then, thought worthy of
his eſteem?" ſaid Valancourt, in a voice
trembling with anxiety; then checking him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
he added, "But pardon the queſtion; I
ſcarcely know what I ſay. If I might dare to
hope, that you think me not unworthy ſuch
honour, and might be permitted ſometimes
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0247300301:298"/>
to enquire after your health, I ſhould now
leave you with comparative tranquillity."</p>
            <p>Emily, after a moment's ſilence, ſaid, "I
will be ingenuous with you, for I know you
will underſtand, and allow for my ſituation;
you will conſider it as a proof of my—my
eſteem that I am ſo. Though I live here
in what was my father's houſe, I live here
alone. I have, alas! no longer a parent—a
parent, whoſe preſence might ſanction
your viſits. It is unneceſſary for me to
point out the impropriety of my receiving
them."</p>
            <p>"Nor will I affect to be inſenſible of
this," replied Valancourt, adding mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully—"but
what is to conſole me for my
candour? I diſtreſs you, and would now
leave the ſubject, if I might carry with me
a hope of being ſome time permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new
it, of being allowed to make myſelf
known to your family."</p>
            <p>Emily was again confuſed, and again he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated
what to reply; ſhe felt moſt acutely
the difficulty—the forlornneſs of her ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0247300301:299"/>
which did not allow her a ſingle rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
or friend, to whom me could turn for
even a look, that might ſupport and guide
her in the preſent embarraſſing circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances.
Madame Cheron, who was her only
relative, and ought to have been this friend,
was either occupied by her / own amuſements,
or ſo reſentful of the reluctance her niece
had ſhewn to quit La Vallée, that ſhe ſeemed
totally to have abandoned her.</p>
            <p>"Ah! I ſee," ſaid Valancourt, after a
long pauſe, during which Emily had begun,
and left unfiniſhed two three ſentences, "I
ſee that I have nothing to hope; my fears
were too juſt, you think me unworthy of
your eſteem. That fatal journey! which I
conſidered as the happieſt period of my life—thoſe
delightful days were to embitter all
my future ones. How often I have looked
back to them with hope and fear—yet never
till this moment could I prevail with myſelf
to regret their enchanting influence."</p>
            <p>His voice faltered, and he abruptly quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
his ſeat and walked on the terrace.
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0247300301:300"/>
There was an expreſſion of deſpair on his
countenance, that affected Emily. The
pleadings of her heart overcame, in ſome
degree, her extreme timidity, and, when he
reſumed his ſeat, ſhe ſaid, in an accent that
betrayed her tenderneſs, "You do both
yourſelf and me injuſtice when you ſay I
think you unworthy of my eſteem; I will
acknowledge that you have long poſſeſſed
it, and—and—"</p>
            <p>Valancourt waited impatiently for the
concluſion of the ſentence, but the words
died on her lips. Her eyes, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected
all the emotions of her heart. Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
paſſed, in an inſtant, from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience
of deſpair, to that of joy and tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
"O Emily!" he exclaimed, "my own
Emily—teach me to ſuſtain this moment!
Let me ſeal it as the moſt ſacred of my life!"</p>
            <p>He preſſed her hand to his lips, it was
cold and trembling; and, raiſing his eyes,
he ſaw the paleneſs of her countenance.
Tears came to her relief, and Valancourt
watched in anxious ſilence over her. In a
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0247300301:301"/>
few moments, ſhe recovered herſelf, and
ſmiling faintly through her tears, ſaid,
"Can you excuſe this weakneſs? My ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
have not yet, I believe, recovered from
the ſhock they lately received."</p>
            <p>"I cannot excuſe myſelf," ſaid Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
"but I will forbear to renew the
ſubject;, which may have contributed to agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
them, now that I can leave you, with
the ſweet certainty of poſſeſſing your eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem.</p>
            <p>Then, forgetting his reſolution, he again
ſpoke of himſelf. "You know not," ſaid
he, "the many anxious hours I have paſſed
near you lately, when you believed me, if
indeed you honoured me with a thought, far
away. I have wandered, near the chateau, in
the ſtill hours of the night, when no eye could
obſerve me. It was delightful to know I was
ſo near you, and there was ſomething particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
ſoothing in the thought, that I watched
round your habitation, while you ſlept.
Theſe grounds are not entirely new to me.
Once I ventured within the ſence, and ſpent
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0247300301:302"/>
one of the happieſt, and yet moſt melancholy
hours of my life in walking under what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved
to be your window."</p>
            <p>Emily enquired how, long Valancourt had
been in the neighbourhood. "Several days,"
he replied. "It was my deſign to avail
myſelf of the permiſſion M. St. Aubert had
given me. I ſcarcely know how to account
for it; but, though I anxiouſly wiſhed to do
this, my reſolution always failed, when the
moment approached, and I conſtantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred
my viſit. I lodged in a village at
ſome diſtance, and wandered with my dogs,
among the ſcenes of this charming country,
wiſhing continually to meet you, yet not
daring to viſit you."</p>
            <p>Having thus continued to converſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
perceiving the flight of time, Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
at length, ſeemed to recollect himſelf.
"I muſt go," ſaid he mournſully, "but it
is with the hope of ſeeing you again, of being
permitted to pay my respects to your family,
let me hear this hope confirmed by your
voice." "My family will be happy to ſee
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0247300301:303"/>
any friend of my dear father," ſaid Emily.
Valancourt kiſſed her hand, and ſtill lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered,
unable to depart, while Emily ſat
ſilently with her eyes bent on the ground;
and Valancourt, as he gazed on her, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that it would ſoon be impoſſible for
him to recall, even to his memory, the exact
reſemblance of the beautiful countenance he
then beheld; at this moment an haſty foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtep
approached from behind the plane-tree,
and, turning her eyes, Emily ſaw Madame
Cheron. She felt a bluſh ſteal upon her
cheek, and her frame trembled with the
emotion of her mind; but ſhe inſtantly roſe
to meet her viſitor. "So niece," ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron, caſting a look of ſurpriſe and
enquiry on Valancourt, "ſo niece, how do
you do? But I need not aſk, your looks tell
me you have already recovered your loſs."</p>
            <p>"My looks do me injuſtice then, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
my loſs I know can never be reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered."</p>
            <p>"Well!—I will not argue with
you; I ſee you have exactly your father's
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0247300301:304"/>
diſpoſition; and let me tell you it would
have been much happier for him, poor
man! if it had been a different one."</p>
            <p>A look of dignified diſpleaſure, with
which Emily regarded Madame Cheron,
while ſhe ſpoke, would have touched almoſt
any other heart: ſhe made no other reply, but
introduced Valancourt, who could ſcarcely
ſtifle the reſentment he ſelt, and whoſe bow
Madame Cheron returned with a ſlight
curteſy, and a look of ſupercilious exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
After a few moments he took leave
of Emily, in a manner, that haſtily expreſſed
his pain both at his own departure, and at
leaving her to the ſociety of Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</p>
            <p>"Who is that young man?" ſaid her
aunt, in an accent, which equally implied
inquiſitiveneſs and cenſure. "Some idle
admirer of yours I ſuppoſe; but I believed
niece you had a greater ſenſe of propriety,
than to have received the viſits of any young
man in your preſent unfriended ſituation.
Let me tell you the world will obſerve thoſe
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0247300301:305"/>
things, and it will talk, aye and very freely
too."</p>
            <p>Emily, extremely ſhocked at this coarſe
ſpeech, attempted to interrupt it; but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron would proceed, with all the
ſelf-importance of a perſon, to whom power
is new.</p>
            <p>"It is very neceſſary you ſhould be under
the eye of ſome perſon more able to guide
you than yourſelf. I, indeed, have not much
leiſure for ſuch a taſk; however, ſince your
poor father made it his laſt requeſt, that I
ſhould overlook your conduct—I muſt even
take you "under my care. But this let me
tell you niece, that, unleſs you will deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine
to be very conformable to my direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
I ſhall not trouble myſelf longer about
you."</p>
            <p>Emily made no attempt to interrupt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron a ſecond time, grief and the
pride of conſcious innocence kept her ſilent,
till her aunt ſaid, "I am now come to
take you with me to Thoulouſe; I am ſorry
to find, that your poor father died, after all,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0247300301:306"/>
in ſuch indifferent circumſtances; however,
I ſhall take you home with me. Ah! poor
man, he was always more generous than pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident,
or he would not have left his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
dependent on his relations."</p>
            <p>"Nor has he done ſo, I hope, madam,"
ſaid Emily calmly, "nor did his pecuniary
misfortunes ariſe from that noble generoſity,
which always diſtinguiſhed him. The affairs
of M. de Motteville may, I truſt, yet
be ſettled without deeply injuring his credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
and in the mean time I ſhould be very
happy to remain at La Vallée."</p>
            <p>"No doubt you would," replied Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron, with a ſmile of irony, "and
I ſhall no doubt conſent to this, ſince I ſee
how neceſſary tranquillity and retirement
are to reſtore your ſpirits. I did not think
you capable of ſo much duplicity, niece;
when you pleaded this excuſe for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining
here, I fooliſhly believed it to be
a juſt one, nor expected to have found with
you ſo agreeable a companion as this M.
La Val—, I forget his name."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0247300301:307"/>
Emily could no longer endure theſe cruel
indignities. "It was a juſt one, madam,"
ſaid ſhe; "and now, indeed, I feel more than
ever the value of the retirement I then ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited;
and, if the purport of your viſit is
only to add inſult to the ſorrows of your
brother's child, ſhe could well have ſpared
it."</p>
            <p>"I ſee that I have undertaken a very
troubleſome taſk," ſaid Madame Cheron,
colouring highly. "I am ſure, madam,"
ſaid Emily mildly, and endeavouring to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain
her tears, "I am ſure my father did
not mean it ſhould be ſuch. I have the
happineſs to reflect, that my conduct under
his eye was ſuch as he often delighted to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove.
It would be very painful to me to
diſobey the ſiſter of ſuch a parent, and, if
you believe the taſk will really be ſo trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome,
I muſt lament, that it is yours."</p>
            <p>"Well! niece, fine ſpeaking ſignifies little.
I am willing, in conſideration of my poor
brother, to overlook the impropriety of your
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0247300301:308"/>
late conduct, and to try what your future
will be."</p>
            <p>Emily interrupted her, to beg ſhe would
explain what was the impropriety ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded
to.</p>
            <p>"What impropriety! why that of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
the viſits of a lover unknown to
your family," replied Madame Cheron, not
conſidering the impropriety of which ſhe
had herſelf been guilty, in expoſing her niece
to the poſſibility of conduct ſo erroneous.</p>
            <p>A faint bluſh paſſed over Emily's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance;
pride and anxiety ſtruggled in her
breaſt; and, till ſhe recollected, that appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances
did, in ſome degree, juſtify her aunt's
ſuſpicions, ſhe could not reſolve to humble
herſelf ſo far as to enter into the defence
of a conduct, which had been ſo innocent
and undeſigning on her part. She men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
the manner of Valancourt's introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to her father; the circumſtance of his
receiving the piſtol-ſhot, and of their after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
travelling together; with the acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dental
way, in which ſhe had met him, on
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0247300301:309"/>
the preceding evening. She owned he had
declared a partiality for her, and that he
had aſked permiſſion to addreſs her family.</p>
            <p>"And who is this young adventurer,
pray?" ſaid Madame Cheron, "and what
are his pretenſions?" "Theſe he muſt
himſelf explain, madam," replied Emily.
"Of his family my father was not igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
and I believe it is unexceptionable."
She then proceeded to mention what ſhe
knew concerning it.</p>
            <p>"O, then, this it ſeems is a younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,"
exclaimed her aunt, "and of courſe
a beggar. A very ſine tale indeed! And
ſo my brother took a fancy to this young
man after only a few days acquaintance!—but
that was ſo like him! In his youth
he was always taking theſe likes and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likes,
when no other perſon ſaw any reaſon
for them at all; nay, indeed, I have often
thought the people he diſapproved were
much more agreeable than thoſe he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired;—but
there is no accounting for
taſtes. He was always ſo much influenced
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0247300301:310"/>
by people's countenances; now I, for my
part, have no notion of this, it is all ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
enthuſiaſm. What has a man's face to
do with his character? Can a man of good
character help having a diſagreeable face?"—which
laſt ſentence Madame Cheron de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered
with the deciſive air of a perſon who
congratulates herſelf on having made a
grand diſcovery, and believes the queſtion
to be unanſwerably ſettled.</p>
            <p>Emily, deſirous of concluding the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
enquired if her aunt would accept
ſome reſreſhment, and Madame Cheron ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied
her to the chateau, but without
deſiſting from a topic, which ſhe diſcuſſed
with ſo much complacency to" herſelf, and
ſeverity to her niece.</p>
            <p>"I am ſorry to perceive, niece," ſaid ſhe,
in alluſion to ſomewhat that Emily had ſaid,
concerning phyſiognomy, "that you have
a great many of your father's prejudices,
and among them are thoſe ſudden predilec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
for people from their looks. I can
perceive, that you imagine yourſelf to be
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0247300301:311"/>
violently in love with this young adventurer,
after an acquaintance of only a few days.
There was ſomething, too, ſo charmingly
romantic in the manner of your meeting!"</p>
            <p>Emily checked the tears, that trembled in
her eyes, while ſhe ſaid, "When my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
mall deſerve this ſeverity, madam, you
will do well to exerciſe it; till then juſtice,
if not tenderneſs, ſhould ſurely reſtrain it. I
have never willingly offended you; now I
have loft my parents, you are the only perſon
to whom I can look, for kindneſs. Let me
not lament more than ever the loſs of ſuch
parents." The laſt words were almoſt ſtifled
by her emotions, and ſhe burſt into tears.
Remembering the delicacy and the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of St. Aubert, the happy, happy days
ſhe had paſſed in theſe ſcenes, and contraſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them with the coarſe and unfeeling be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
of Madame Cheron, and with the
future hours of mortification ſhe muſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to in her preſence—a degree of grief
ſeized her, that almoſt reached deſpair. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron, more offended by the reproof,
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0247300301:312"/>
which Emily's words conveyed, than touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the ſorrow they expreſſed, ſaid nothing,
that might ſoften her grief; but, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
an apparent reluctance to receive
her niece, ſhe deſired her company. The
love of ſway was her ruling paſſion, and ſhe
knew it would be highly gratified by taking
into her houſe a young orphan, who had no
appeal from her deciſions, and on whom ſhe
could exerciſe without controul the caprici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
humour of the moment.</p>
            <p>On entering the chateau, Madame Cheron
expreſſed a deſire, that ſhe would put up
what ſhe thought neceſſary to take to Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe,
as ſhe meant to ſet off immediately.
Emily now tried to perſuade her to defer
the journey, at leaſt, till the next day, and,
at length, with much difficulty, prevailed.</p>
            <p>The day paſſed in the exerciſe of petty
tyranny on the part of Madame Cheron,
and in mournful regret and melancholy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation
on that of Emily, who, when
her aunt retired to her apartment for the
night, went, to take leave of every other
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0247300301:313"/>
room in this her dear native home, which
ſhe was now quitting for ſhe knew not how
long, and for a world, to which ſhe was
wholly a ſtranger. She could not conquer
a preſentiment, which frequently occurred
to her, this night—that ſhe ſhould never
more return to La Vallée. Having paſſed
a considerable time in what had been her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
ſtudy, having ſelected ſome of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
authors, to put up with her clothes,
and ſhed many tears, as ſhe wiped the duſt
from their covers, ſhe ſeated herſelf in his
chair before the reading deſk, and ſat loſt
in melancholy reflection, till Thereſa opened
the door to examine, as was her cuſtom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
ſhe went to bed, if all was ſafe. She
ſtarted, on obſerving her young lady, who
bade her come in, and then gave her ſome
directions for keeping the chateau in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
for her reception at all times.</p>
            <p>"Alas-a day! that you ſhould leave it!"
ſaid Thereſa, "I think you would be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier
here than where you are going, if one
may judge." Emily made no reply to this
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0247300301:314"/>
remark; he ſorrow Thereſa proceeded to
expreſs at her departure aſſected her, but
ſhe ſound ſome comfort in the ſimple affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of this poor old ſervant, to whom ſhe
gave ſuch directions as might beſt conduce
to her comfort, during her own abſence.</p>
            <p>Having diſmiſſed Thereſa to bed, Emily
wandered through every lonely apartment of
the chateau, lingering long in what had been
her father's bed-room, indulging melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly,
yet not unpleaſing, emotions, and,
having often returned, within the door to
take another look at it, ſhe withdrew to her
own chamber. From her window ſhe gazed
upon the garden below, ſhewn faintly by the
moon, riſing over the tops of the palm-trees,
and, at length, the calm, beauty, of the night
increaſed a deſire of indulging the mournful
ſweetness of bidding farewel to the beloved
ſhades of her childhood, till ſhe was tempted
to deſcend. Throwing over her the light
veil, in which ſhe uſually walked, ſhe ſilently
paſſed into the garden, and, haſtening to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the diſtant groves, was glad to breathe
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0247300301:315"/>
once more the air of liberty, and to ſigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obſerved.
The deep repoſe of the ſcene,
the rich ſcents, that floated on the breeze,
the grandeur of the wide horizon and of the
clear blue arch, ſoothed and gradually ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
her mind to that ſublime compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency,
which renders the vexations of this
world ſo inſignificant and mean in our eyes,
that we wonder they have had power for a
moment to diſturb us. Emily forgot Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron and all the circumſtances of
her conduct, while her thoughts aſcended
to the contemplation, of thoſe unnumbered
worlds, that lie ſcattered in the depths of
aether, thauſands of them hid from human
eyes, and almoſt beyond the ſlight of human
fancy. As her imagination ſoared through
the regions of ſpace, and aſpired to that
Great Firſt Cauſe, which pervades and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns
all being, the idea of her father ſcarcely
ever leſt her; but it was a pleaſing idea,
ſince ſhe reſigned him to God in the full
confidence of a pure and holy faith. She
purſued her way through the groves to the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0247300301:316"/>
terrace, often pauſing as memory awakened
the pang of affection, and as reaſon antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated
the exile, into which ſhe was going.</p>
            <p>And now the moon was high over the
woods, touching their ſummits with yellow
light, and darting between the foliage long
level beams; while on the rapid Garonne
below the trembling radiance was faintly
obſcured by the lighteſt vapour. Emily
long watched the playing luſtre, liſtened to
the ſoothing murmur of the current, and
the yet lighter ſounds of the air, as it ſtirred,
at intervals, the lofty palm-trees. "How
delightful is the ſweet breath of theſe
groves," ſaid ſhe. "This lovely ſcene!—how
often ſhall I remember and regret it,
when I am far away. Alas! What events
may occur before I ſee it again! O, peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
happy ſhades!—ſcenes of my infant
delights, of parental tenderneſs now loſt for
ever!—why must I leave ye!—In your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treats
I ſhould ſtill ſind ſafety and repoſe.
Sweet hours of my childhood—I am now
to leave even your laſt memorials! No ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0247300301:317"/>
that would revive your impreſſions,
will remain for me!"</p>
            <p>Then drying her tears and looking up,
her thoughts roſe again to the ſublime ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
ſhe had contemplated, the ſame divine
complacency ſtole over her heart, and, huſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its throbs, inſpired hope and confidence
and reſignation to the will of the Deity,
whoſe works filled her mind with adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Emily gazed long on the plane-tree, and
then ſeated herſelf, for the laſt time, on the
bench under its ſhade, where ſhe had ſo
often ſat with her parents, and where, only
a few hours before, ſhe had converſed with
Valancourt, at the remembrance of whom,
thus revived, a mingled ſenſation of eſteem,
tenderneſs and anxiety roſe in her breaſt.
With this remembrance occurred a recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of his late confession—that he had
often wandered near her habitation in the
night, having even paſſed the boundary of
the garden, and it immediately occurred to
her, that he might be at this moment in the
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0247300301:318"/>
grounds. The fear of meeting him, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly
after the declaration he had made,
and of incurring a cenſure, which her aunt
might ſo reaſonably beſtow, if it was known,
that ſhe was met by her lover, at this hour,
made her inſtantly leave her beloved plane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,
and walk towards the chateau. She
caſt an anxious eye around, and often ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
for a moment to examine the ſhadowy
ſcene before ſhe ventured to proceed, but
ſhe paſſed on without perceiving any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
till, having reached a clump of almond
trees, not far from the houſe, ſhe reſted
to take a retroſpect of the garden, and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigh
forth another adieu: As her eyes wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
over the landſcape ſhe thought ſhe
perceived a perſon emerge from the groves,
and paſs ſlowly along a moon-light alley
that led between them, but the diſtance,
and the imperfect light would not ſuffer her
to judge with any degree of certainty whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
this was fancy or reality. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
to gaze for ſome time on the ſpot,
till an the dead ſtillneſs of the air ſhe heard
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0247300301:319"/>
a ſudden ſound, and in the next inſtant
fancied ſhe diſtinguiſhed footſteps near her.
Waſting not another moment in conjecture,
ſhe hurried to the chateau, and, having
reached it, retired to her chamber, where, as
ſhe cloſed her window ſhe looked upon the
garden, and then again thought ſhe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
a figure, gliding between the almond
trees ſhe had juſt left. She immediately
withdrew from the caſement, and, though
much agitated, ſought in ſleep the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of a ſhort oblivion.</p>

            </epigraph>
            <p>AT an early hour, the carriage, which
was to take Emily and Madame Cheron to
Tholouſe, appeared at the door of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,
and Madame was already in the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fast-room,
when her niece entered it. The
repaſt was ſilent and melancholy on the
part of Emily; and Madame Cheron,
whoſe vanity was piqued on obſerving her
dejection, reproved her in a manner that
did not contribute to remove it. It was
with much reluctance, that Emily's requeſt
to take with her the dog, which had been a
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0247300301:321"/>
favourite of her father, was granted. Her
aunt, impatient to be gone, ordered the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
to draw up; and, while ſhe paſſed to
the hall door, Emily gave another look
into the library, and another farewell glance
over the garden, and then followed. Old
Thereſa ſtood at the door to take leave of
her young lady. "God for ever keep you,
ma'amſelle!" ſaid ſhe, while Emily gave
her hand in ſilence, and could anſwer only
with a preſſure of her hand, and a forced
ſmile.</p>
            <p>At the gate, which led out of the grounds,
ſeveral of her father's penſioners were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled
to bid her farewell, to whom ſhe
would have ſpoken, if her aunt would have
ſuffered the driver to ſtop; and, having
diſtributed to them almoſt all the money ſhe
had about her, ſhe ſunk back in the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
yielding to the melancholy of her
heart. Soon after, ſhe caught, between
the ſteep-banks of the road, another view
of the chateau, peeping from among the
high trees, and ſurrounded by green ſlopes
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0247300301:322"/>
and tufted groves, the Garonne winding its
way beneath their ſhades, ſometimes loſt
among the vineyards, and then riſing in
greater majeſty in the diſtant paſtures. The
towering precipices of the Pyrenées, that roſe
to the ſouth, gave Emily a thouſand intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
recollections of her late journey; and
theſe objects of her former enthuſiaſtic admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration,
now excited only ſorrow and regret.
Having gazed on the chateau and its lovely
ſcenery, till the banks again cloſed upon
them, her mind became too much occupied
by mournful reflections, to permit her to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to the converſation, which Madame
Cheron had begun on ſome trivial topic,
ſo that they ſoon travelled in profound ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
            <p>Valancourt, mean while, was returned to
Eſtuviere, his heart occupied with the image
of Emily; ſometimes indulging in reveries
of future happineſs, but more frequently
ſhrinking with dread of the oppoſition he
might encounter from her family. He was
the younger ſon of an ancient family of
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0247300301:323"/>
Gaſcony; and, having loſt his parents at an
early period of his life, the care of his edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
and of his ſmall portion had devolved,
to his brother, the Count de Duvarney, his
ſenior by nearly twenty years. Valancourt
had been educated in all the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of his age, and had an ardour of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
and a certain grandeur of mind, that
gave him particular excellence in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes
then thought heroic. His little for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
had been diminiſhed by the neceſſary
expences of his education; but M. La Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
the elder, ſeemed to think, that
his genius and accompliſhments would am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
ſupply the deficiency of his inheritance.
They offered flattering hopes of promotion
in the military profeſſion, in thoſe times al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
the only one in which a gentleman
could engage without incurring a ſtain on
his name; and La Valancourt was of courſe
enrolled in the army. The general genius
of his mind was but little underſtood by
his brother. That ardour for whatever is
great and good in the moral world, as well as
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0247300301:324"/>
in the natural one, diſplayed itſelf in his
infant years; and the ſtrong indignation,
which he felt and expreſſed at a criminal,
or a mean action, ſometimes drew upon him
the diſpleaſure of his tutor; who reprobated
it under the general term of violence of
temper; and who, when haranguing on the
virtues of mildneſs and moderation, ſeemed
to forget the gentleneſs and compaſſion,
which always appeared in his pupil towards
objects of misfortune.</p>
            <p>He had now obtained leave of abſence
from his regiment when he made the excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
into the Pyrenées, which was the means
of introducing him to St. Aubert; and, as
this permiſſion was nearly expired, he was
the more anxious to declare himſelf to
Emily's family, from whom he reaſonably
apprehended oppoſition, ſince his fortune,
though, with a moderate addition from hers,
it would be ſufficient to ſupport them,
would not ſatisfy the views, either of vanity,
or ambition. Valancourt was not without
the latter, but he ſaw golden viſions of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0247300301:325"/>
in the army; and believed, that with
Emily he could, in the mean time, be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted
to live within the limits of his hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
income. His thoughts were now oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
in conſidering the means of making
himſelf known to her family, to whom,
however, he had yet no addreſs, for he was
entirely ignorant of Emily's precipitate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture
from La Vallée, of whom he hoped
to obtain it.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, the travelers purſued their
journey; Emily making frequent efforts to
appear chearful, and too often relapſing
into ſilence and dejection. Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
attributing her melancholy ſolely to the
circumſtance of her being removed to a
diſtance from her lover, and believing, that
the ſorrow, which her niece ſtill expreſſed
for the loſs of St. Aubert, proceeded partly
from an affectation of ſenſibility, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to make it appear ridiculous to her,
that ſuch deep regret mould continue to be
felt ſo long after the period uſually allowed
for grief.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="314" facs="tcp:0247300301:326"/>
At length, theſe unpleaſant lectures were
interrupted by the arrival of the travellers
at Tholouſe; and Emily, who had not
been there for many years, and had only a,
very faint recollection of it, was ſurpriſed
at the oſtentatious ſtyle exhibited in her
aunt's houſe and furniture; the more ſo,
perhaps, becauſe it was ſo totally different
from the modeſt elegance, to which ſhe had
been accuſtomed. She followed Madame
Cheron through a large hall, where ſeveral
ſervants in rich liveries appeared, to a kind
of ſaloon, fitted up with more ſhew than
taſte; and her aunt, complaining of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue,
ordered ſupper immediately. "I
am glad to find myſelf in my own houſe
again," ſaid ſhe, throwing herſelf on a large
ſettee, "and to have my own people about
me. I deteſt travelling; though, indeed, I
ought to like it, for what I ſee abroad al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
makes me delighted to return to my
own chateau. What makes you ſo ſilent,
child?—What is it that difturbs you now?"</p>
            <p>Emily ſuppreſſed a ſtarting tear, and
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0247300301:327"/>
tried to ſmile away the expreſſion of an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
heart; ſhe was thinking of <hi>her</hi>
home, and felt too ſenſibly the arrogance
and oſtentatious vanity of Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron's
converſation. "Can this be my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
ſiſter!" ſaid ſhe to herſelf; and then
the conviction that ſhe was ſo, warming her
heart with ſomething like kindneſs towards
her, ſhe felt anxious to ſoften the harſh im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
her mind had received of her aunt's
character, and to ſhew a willingneſs to
oblige her. The effort did not entirely
fail; ſhe liſtened with apparent chearfulneſs,
while Madame Cheron expatiated on the
ſplendour of her houſe, told of the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
parties ſhe entertained, and what ſhe
ſhould expect of Emily, whoſe diffidence aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
the air of a reſerve, which her aunt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving
it to be that of pride and ignorance
united, now took occaſion to reprehend.
She knew nothing of the conduct of a mind,
that fears to truſt its own powers; which,
poſſeſſing a nice judgment, and inclining to
believe, that every other perſon perceives
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0247300301:328"/>
ſtill more critically, fears to commit itſelf to
cenſure, and ſeeks ſhelter in the obſcurity
of ſilence. Emily had frequently bluſhed
at the fearleſs manners, which ſhe had ſeen
admired, and the brilliant nothings, which
ſhe had heard applauded; yet this applauſe,
ſo far from encouraging her to imitate the
conduct that had won it, rather made her
ſhrink into the reſerve, that would protect
her from ſuch abſurdity.</p>
            <p>Madame Cheron looked on her niece's
diffidence with a feeling very near to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt,
and endeavoured to overcome it by
reproof, rather than to encourage it by gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs.</p>
            <p>The entrance of ſupper ſomewhat inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
the complacent diſcourſe of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron and the painful conſiderations,
which it had forced upon Emily. When
the repaſt, which was rendered oſtentatious
by the attendance of a great number of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants,
and by a profuſion of plate, was over,
Madame Cheron retired to her chamber,
and a female ſervant came to ſhew Emily
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0247300301:329"/>
to hers. Having paſſed up a large ſtair
caſe, and through ſeveral galleries, they
came to a flight of back ſtairs, which led
into a ſhort paſſage in a remote part of the
chateau, and there the ſervant opened the
door of a ſmall chamber, which ſhe ſaid
was Ma'amſelle Emily's, who, once more
alone, indulged the tears ſhe had long
tried to reſtrain.</p>
            <p>Thoſe, who know, from experience, how
much the heart becomes attached even to
inanimate objects, to which it has been
long accuſtomed, how unwillingly it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
them; how with the ſenſations of an
old friend it meets them, after temporary
abſence, will underſtand the forlornneſs of
Emily's feelings, of Emily ſhut out from
the only home ſhe had known from her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy,
and thrown upon a ſcene, and among
perſons, diſagreeable for more qualities
than their novelty. Her father's favourite
dog, now in the chamber, thus ſeemed to
acquire the character and importance of a
friend; and, as the animal fawned over her
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0247300301:330"/>
when ſhe wept, and licked her hands,
"Ah, poor Manchon!" ſaid ſhe, "I have
nobody now to love me—but you!" and
ſhe wept the more. After ſome time, her
thoughts returning to her father's injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſhe remembered how often he had
blamed her for indulging uſeleſs ſorrow;
how often he had pointed out to her the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
of fortitude and patience, aſſuring
her, that the faculties of the mind ſtrengthen
by exertion, till they finally unnerve afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and triumph over it. Theſe recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
dried her tears, gradually ſoothed her
ſpirits, and inſpired her with the ſweet emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
of practiſing precepts, which her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
had ſo frequently inculcated.</p>

            <p>MADAME Cheron's houſe ſtood at a
little diſtance from the city of Tholouſe,
and was ſurrounded by extenſive gardens,
in which Emily, who had ariſen early,
amuſed herſelf with wandering before
breakfaſt, From a terrace, that extended
along the higheſt part of them, was a wide
view over Languedoc. On the diſtaht ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon
to the ſouth, ſhe diſcovered the wild
ſummits of the Pyrenées, and her fancy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
painted the green paſtures of
Gaſcony at their feet. Her heart pointed
to her peaceful home—to the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood
where Valancourt was—where St.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0247300301:332"/>
Aubert had been; and her imagination,
piercing the veil of diſtance, brought that
home to her eyes in all its intereſting and
romantic beauty. She experienced an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible
pleaſure in believing, that ſhe
beheld the country around it, though no
feature could be diſtinguiſhed, except the
retiring chain of the Pyrenées; and, inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
to the ſcene immediately before
her, and to the flight of time, ſhe continued
to lean on the window of a pavilion, that
terminated the terrace, with her eyes fixed
on Gaſcony, and her mind occupied with
the intereſting ideas which the view of it
awakened, till a ſervant came to tell her
breakfaſt was ready. Her thoughts thus
recalled to the ſurrounding objects, the
ſtraight walks, ſquare parterres, and artifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
fountains of the garden, could not fail,
as ſhe paſſed through it, to appear the
worſe, oppoſed to the negligent graces, and
natural beauties of the grounds at La Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lée,
upon which her recollection had been
ſo intenſely employed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="321" facs="tcp:0247300301:333"/>
"Whither have you been rambling ſo
early?" ſaid Madame Cheron, as her niece
entered the breakfaſt-room. "I don't ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
of theſe ſolitary walks," and Emily
was ſurpriſed, when, having informed her
aunt, that ſhe had been no further than the
gardens, ſhe underſtood theſe to be included
in the reproof. "I deſire you will not
walk there again at ſo early an hour unat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,"
ſaid Madame Cheron; "my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens
are very extenſive; and a young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who can make aſſignations by moon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light,
at La Vallée, is not to be truſted to
her own inclinations elſewhere."</p>
            <p>Emily, extremely ſurpriſed and ſhocked,
had ſcarcely power to beg an explanation of
theſe words, and, when ſhe did, her aunt
abſolutely refuſed to give it, though, by her
ſevere looks, and half ſentences, ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
anxious to impreſs Emily with a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief,
that ſhe was well informed of ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grading
circumſtances of her conduct. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
innocence could not prevent a bluſh
from ſtealing over Emily's cheek; ſhe trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0247300301:334"/>
and looked confuſedly under the bold
eye of Madame Cheron, who bluſhed alſo;
but hers was the bluſh of triumph, ſuch as
ſometimes ſtains the countenance of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
congratulating himſelf on the penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
which had taught him to ſuſpect ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
and who loſes both pity for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
criminal, and indignation of his guilt,
in the gratification of his own vanity.</p>
            <p>Emily, not doubting that her aunt's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
aroſe from the having obſerved her
ramble in the garden on the night preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her departure from La Vallée, now
mentioned the motive of it, at which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron ſmiled contemptuouſly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
either to accept this explanation, or
to give her reaſons for refuſing it; and,
ſoon after, ſhe concluded the ſubject by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
"I never truſt people's aſſertions, I
always judge of them by their actions; but
I am willing to try what will be your beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour
in future."</p>
            <p>Emily, leſs ſurpriſed by her aunt's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
and myſterious ſilence, than by the
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0247300301:335"/>
accuſation ſhe had received, deeply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the latter, and ſcarcely doubted, that
it was Valancourt whom ſhe had ſeen at
night in the gardens of La Vallée, and that
he had been obſerved there by Madame
Cheron; who now paſſing from one painful
topic only to revive another almoſt equally
ſo, ſpoke of the ſituation of her niece's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,
in the hands of M. Motteville. While
ſhe thus talked with oftentatious pity of
Emily's misfortunes, ſhe failed not to incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
the duties of humility and gratitude, or
to render Emily fully ſenſible of every cruel
mortification, who ſoon perceived, that ſhe
was to be conſidered as a dependent, not
only by her aunt, but by her aunt's ſervants.</p>
            <p>She was now informed, that a large party
were expected to dinner, on which account
Madame Cheron repeated the leſſon of the
preceding night, concerning her conduct in
company, and Emily wiſhed, that ſhe might
have courage enough to practiſe it. Her
aunt then proceeded to examine the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of her dreſs, adding, that ſhe expected
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0247300301:336"/>
to ſee her attired with gaiety and taſte;
after which me condeſcended to ſhew Emily
the ſplendour of her chateau, and to point
out the particular beauty, or elegance,
which ſhe thought diſtinguiſhed each of her
numerous ſuites of apartments. She then
withdrew to her toilet, the throne of her
homage, and Emily to her chamber, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pack
her books, and to try to charm her
mind by reading, till the hour of dreſſing.</p>
            <p>When the company arrived, Emily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the ſaloon with an air of timidity,
which all her efforts could not overcome,
and which was increaſed by the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Madame Cheron's ſevere obſervation.
Her mourning dreſs, the mild dejection of
her beautiful countenance, and the retiring
diffidence of her manner, rendered her a
very intereſting object to many of the
company, among whom ſhe diſtinguiſhed
Signor Montoni, and his friend Cavigni,
the late viſitors at M. Queſnel's, who now
ſeemed to converſe with Madame Cheron
with the familiarity of old acquaintance,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0247300301:337"/>
and ſhe to attend to them with particular
pleaſure.</p>
            <p>This Signor Montoni had an air of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious
ſuperiority, animated by ſpirit, and
ſtrengthened by talents, to which every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſeemed involuntarily to yield. The
quickneſs of his perceptions was ſtrikingly
expreſſed on his countenance, yet that
countenance could ſubmit implicitly to oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion;
and, more than once in this day,
the triumph of art over nature might have
been diſcerned in it. His viſage was
long, and rather narrow, yet he was called
handſome; and it was, perhaps, the ſpirit
and vigour of his ſoul, ſparkling through
his features, that triumphed for him. Emily
felt admiration, but not the admiration
that leads to eſteem; for it was mixed
with a degree of fear ſhe knew not exactly
wherefore.</p>
            <p>Cavigni was gay and inſinuating as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly;
and, though he paid almoſt inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
attention to Madame Cheron, he found
ſome opportunities of converſing with
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0247300301:338"/>
Emily, to whom he directed, at firſt, the
fallies of his wit, but now and then aſſumed
an air of tenderneſs, which ſhe obſerved,
and ſhrunk from. Though ſhe replied but
little, the gentleneſs and ſweetneſs of her
manners encouraged him to talk, and ſhe
felt relieved when a young lady of the
party, who ſpoke inceſſantly, obtruded her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
on his notice. This lady, who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
all the ſprightlineſs of a French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman,
with all her coquetry, affected to
underſtand every ſubject, or rather there
was no affectation in the caſe; for, never
looking beyond the limits of her own ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance,
ſhe believed ſhe had nothing
to learn. She attracted notice from all;
amuſed ſome, diſguſted others for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and was then forgotten.</p>
            <p>This day paſſed without any material oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence;
and Emily, though amuſed by the
characters ſhe had ſeen, was glad when ſhe
could retire to the recollections, which had
acquired with her the character of duties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="327" facs="tcp:0247300301:339"/>
A fortnight paſſed in a round of diſſipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and company, and Emily, who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Madame Cheron in all her viſits,
was ſometimes entertained, but oftener
wearied. She was ſtruck by the apparent
talents and knowledge diſplayed in the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
converſations ſhe liſtened to, and it
was long before ſhe diſcovered, that the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
were for the moſt part thoſe of impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and the knowledge nothing more than
was neceſſary to aſſiſt them. But what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
her moſt, was the air of conſtant
gaiety and good ſpirits, diſplayed by every
viſitor, and which ſhe ſuppoſed to ariſe from
content as conſtant, and from benevolence
as ready. At length, from the over-acting
of ſome, leſs accompliſhed than the others,
ſhe could perceive, that, though content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and benevolence are the only ſure
ſources of cheerfulneſs, the immoderate and
feveriſh animation, uſually exhibited in
large parties, reſults partly from an inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
to the cares, which benevolence muſt
ſometimes derive from the ſufferings of
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0247300301:340"/>
others, and partly from a deſire to diſplay
the appearance of that proſperity, which
they know will command ſubmiſſion and
attention to themſelves.</p>
            <p>Emily's pleaſanteſt hours were paſſed in
the pavilion of the terrace, to which ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired,
when ſhe could ſteal from obſervation,
with a book to overcome, or a lute to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge,
her melancholy. There, as ſhe ſat
with her eyes fixed on the far-diſtant Pyre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nées,
and her thoughts on Valancourt and
the beloved ſcenes of Gaſcony, ſhe would
play the ſweet and melancholy ſongs of her
native province—the popular ſongs ſhe had
liſtened to from her childhood.</p>
            <p>One evening, having excuſed herſelf from
accompanying her aunt abroad, ſhe thus
withdrew to the pavilion, with books and
her lute. It was the mild and beautiful
evening of a ſultry day, and the windows,
which fronted the weſt, opened upon all
the glory of a ſetting ſun. Its rays illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
with ſtrong ſplendour, the cliffs of
the Pyrenées, and touched their ſnowy tops
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0247300301:341"/>
with a roſeate hue, that remained, long after
the ſun had ſunk below the horizon, and
the ſhades of twilight had ſtolen over the
landſcape. Emily touched her lute with
that fine melancholy expreſſion, which came
from her heart. The penſive hour and the
ſcene, the evening light on the Garonne,
that flowed at no great diſtance, and whoſe
waves, as they paſſed towards La Vallée,
ſhe often viewed with a ſigh,—theſe united
circumſtances diſpoſed her mind to tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
and her thoughts were with Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court;
of whom ſhe had heard nothing ſince
her arrival at Tholouſe, and now that ſhe
was removed from him, and in uncertainty,
ſhe perceived all the intereſt he held in her
heart. Before ſhe ſaw Valancourt ſhe had
never met a mind and taſte ſo accordant
with her own, and, though Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
told her much of the arts of diſſimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and that the elegance and propriety of
thought, which ſhe ſo much admired in
her lover, were aſſumed for the purpoſe of
pleaſing her, ſhe could ſcarcely doubt their
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0247300301:342"/>
truth. This poſſibility, however, faint as it
was, was ſufficient to haraſs her mind with
anxiety, and ſhe found, that few conditions
are more painful than that of uncertainty,
as to the merit of a beloved object; an
uncertainty, which ſhe would not have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
had her confidence in her own opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
been greater.</p>
            <p>She was awakened from her muſing by
the ſound of horſes' feet along a road, that
wound under the windows of the pavilion,
and a gentleman paſſed on horſeback, whoſe
reſemblance to Valancourt, in air and figure,
for the twilight did not permit a view of
his features, immediately ſtruck her. She
retired haſtily from the lattice, fearing to
be ſeen, yet wiſhing to obſerve further,
while the ſtranger paſſed on without look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
up, and, when ſhe returned to the lattice,
ſhe ſaw him faintly through the twilight,
winding under the high trees, that led to
Tholouſe. This little incident ſo much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed
her ſpirits, that the temple and its
ſcenery were no longer intereſting to her,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0247300301:343"/>
and, after walking a while on the terrace, ſhe
returned to the chateau.</p>
            <p>Madame Cheron, whether ſhe had ſeen a
rival admired, had loſt at play, or had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed
an entertainment more ſplendid than
her own, was returned from her viſit with
a temper more than uſually diſcompoſed;
and Emily was glad, when the hour arrived,
in which ſhe could retire to the ſolitude of
her own apartment.</p>
            <p>On the following morning, ſhe was ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned
to Madame Cheron, whoſe counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
was inflamed with reſentment, and,
as Emily advanced, ſhe held out a letter to
her.</p>
            <p>"Do you know this hand?" ſaid ſhe, in
a ſevere tone, and with a look that was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
to ſearch her heart, while Emily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined
the letter attentively, and aſſured
her, that ſhe did not.</p>
            <p>"Do not provoke me," ſaid her aunt;
"you do know it, confeſs the truth imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately.
I inſiſt upon your confeſſing the
truth inſtantly."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="332" facs="tcp:0247300301:344"/>
Emily was ſilent, and turned to leave the
room, but Madame called her back. "O
you are guilty then," ſaid ſhe, "you do
know the hand." "If you was before in
doubt of this, madam," replied Emily calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
"why did you accuſe me of having
told a falſehood." Madame Cheron did not
bluſh; but her niece did, a moment after,
when ſhe heard the name of Valancourt. It
was not, however, with the conſciouſneſs of
deſerving reproof, for, if ſhe ever had ſeen
his hand-writing, the preſent characters did
not bring it to her recollection.</p>
            <p>"It is uſeleſs to deny it," ſaid Madame
Cheron, "I ſee in your countenance, that
you are no ſtranger to this letter; and, I
dare ſay, you have received many ſuch from
this impertinent young man, without my
knowledge, in my own houſe."</p>
            <p>Emily, ſhocked at the indelicacy of this
accuſation, ſtill more than by the vulgarity
of the former, inſtantly forgot the pride, that
had impoſed ſilence, and endeavoured to
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0247300301:345"/>
vindicate herſelf from the aſperſion, but Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron was not to be convinced.</p>
            <p>"I cannot ſuppoſe," ſhe reſumed, "that
this young man would have taken the liberty
of writing to me, if you had not encouraged
him to do ſo, and I muſt now"—"You
will allow me to remind you, madam," ſaid
Emily timidly, "of ſome particulars of a
converſation we had at La Vallée. I then
told you truly, that I had only not forbade
Monſieur Valancourt from addreſſing my
family."</p>
            <p>"I will not be interrupted," ſaid Madame
Cheron, interrupting her niece, "I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to ſay—I—I—have forgot what I was
going to ſay. But how happened it that you
did not forbid him?" Emily was ſilent.
"How happened it that you encouraged
him to trouble me with this letter?—A
young man that nobody knows;—an utter
ſtranger in the place,—a young adventurer,
no doubt, who is looking out for a good
fortune. However, on that point he has
miſtaken his aim."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="334" facs="tcp:0247300301:346"/>
"His family was known to my father,"
ſaid Emily modeſtly; and without appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to be ſenſible of the laſt ſentence.</p>
            <p>"O! that is no recommendation at all,"
replied her aunt, with her uſual readineſs
upon this topic; "he took ſuch ſtrange
fanciès to people! He was always judging
perſons by their countenances, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
deceived." "Yet it was but now,
madam, that you judged me guilty by my
countenance," ſaid Emily, with a deſign of
reproving Madame Cheron, to which ſhe
was induced by this diſreſpectful mention of
her father.</p>
            <p>"I called you here," reſumed her aunt,
colouring, "to tell you, that I will not be
diſturbed in my own houſe by any letters, or
viſits from young men, who may take a
fancy to flatter you. This M. de Valantine—I
think you call him, has the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence
to beg I will permit him to pay his
reſpects to me! I ſhall ſend him a proper
anſwer. And for you, Emily, I repeat it
once for all—if you are not contented to
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0247300301:347"/>
conform to my directions, and to my way
of life, I ſhall give up the taſk of overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
your conduct—I ſhall no longer trouble
myſelf with your education, but ſhall ſend
you to board in a convent."</p>
            <p>"Dear madam," ſaid Emily, burſting
into tears, and overcome by the rude ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions
her aunt had expreſſed, "how have
I deſerved theſe reproofs!" She could ſay
no more; and ſo very fearful was ſhe of
acting with any degree of impropriety in the
affair itſelf, that, at the preſent moment,
Madame Cheron might perhaps have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
with her to bind herſelf by a promiſe
to renounce Valancourt for ever. Her mind,
weakened by her terrors, would no longer
ſuffer her to view him as ſhe had formerly
done; ſhe feared the error of her own judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
not that of Madame Cheron, and
feared alſo, that, in her former converſation
with him, at La Vallée, ſhe had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
herſelf with ſufficient reſerve. She
knew, that ſhe did not deſerve the coarſe
ſuſpicions, which her aunt had thrown out,
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:0247300301:348"/>
but a thouſand ſcruples roſe to torment her,
ſuch as would never have diſturbed the
peace of Madame Cheron. Thus rendered
anxious to avoid every opportunity of er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,
and willing to ſubmit to any reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
that her aunt ſhould think proper,
ſhe expreſſed an obedience, to which Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron did not give much confidence,
and which ſhe ſeemed to conſider as the
conſequence of either fear, or artifice.</p>
            <p>"Well then," ſaid ſhe, "promiſe me
that you will neither ſee this young man,
nor write to him without my conſent."—"Dear,
madam," replied Emily, "can you
ſuppoſe I would do either, unknown to
you!" "I don't know what to ſuppoſe;
there is no knowing how young women will
act. It is difficult to place any confidence
in them, for they have ſeldom ſenſe enough
to wiſh for the reſpect of the world."</p>
            <p>"Alas, madam!" ſaid Emily, "I am
anxious for my own reſpect; my father
taught me the value of that; he ſaid if I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:0247300301:349"/>
my own eſteem, that of the world
would follow of courſe."</p>
            <p>"My brother was a good kind of a man,"
replied Madame Cheron, "but he did not
know the world. I am ſure I have always
felt a proper reſpect for myſelf, yet—"
She ſtopped, but ſhe might have added, that
the world had not always ſhewn reſpect to
her, and this without impeaching its judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>"Well!" reſumed Madame Cheron,
"you have not given me the promiſe,
though, that I demand." Emily readily
gave it, and, being then ſuffered to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw,
ſhe walked in the garden; tried to
compoſe her ſpirits, and, at length, arrived
at her favourite pavilion at the end of the
terrace, where, ſeating herſelf at one of the
embowered windows, that opened upon a
balcony, the ſtillneſs and ſecluſion of the
ſcene allowed her to recollect her thoughts,
and to arrange them ſo as to form a clearer
judgment of her former conduct. She en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to review with exactneſs all the
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0247300301:350"/>
particulars of her converſation with Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
at La Vallée, had the ſatisfaction to
obſerve nothing, that could alarm her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
pride, and thus to be confirmed in the
ſelf-eſteem, which was ſo neceſſary to her
peace. Her mind then became tranquil,
and ſhe ſaw Valancourt amiable and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent,
as he had formerly appeared, and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron neither the one, or the other.
The remembrance of her lover, however,
brought with it many very painful emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
for it by no means reconciled her to
the thought of reſigning him; and, Madame
Cheron having already ſhewn how highly
ſhe diſapproved of the attachment, ſhe fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw
much ſuffering from the oppoſition of
intereſts; yet with all this was mingled a
degree of delight, which, in ſpite of reaſon,
partook of hope. She determined, however,
that no conſideration ſhould induce her to
permit a ciandeſtine correſpondence, and to
obſerve in her converſation with Valancourt,
ſhould they ever meet again, the ſame nicety
of reſerve, which had hitherto marked her
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0247300301:351"/>
conduct. As ſhe repeated the words—"ſhould
we ever meet again!" ſhe ſhrunk
as if this was a circumſtance, which had
never before occurred to her, and tears came
to her eyes, which ſhe haſtily dried, for ſhe
heard footſteps approaching, and then the
door of the pavilion open, and, on turning,
ſhe ſaw—Valancourt. An emotion of mingled
pleaſure, ſurpriſe and apprehenſion preſſed
ſo ſuddenly upon her heart as almoſt to
overcome her ſpirits; the colour left her
cheeks, then returned brighter than before,
and ſhe was for a moment unable to ſpeak,
or to riſe from her chair. His countenance
was the mirror, in which ſhe ſaw her own
emotions reflected, and it rouſed her to self-command.
The joy, which had animated
his features, when he entered the pavilion,
was ſuddenly repreſſed, as, approaching, he
perceived her agitation, and, in a tremulous
voice, enquired after her health. Recovered
from her firſt ſurpriſe, ſhe anſwered him
with a tempered ſmile; but a variety of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite
emotions ſtill aſſailed her heart, and
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0247300301:352"/>
ſtruggled to ſubdue the mild dignity of her
manner. It was difficult to tell which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominated—the
joy of ſeeing Valancourt, or
the terror of her aunt's diſpleaſure, when ſhe
ſhould hear of this meeting. After ſome
ſhort and embarraſſed converſation, ſhe led
him into the gardens, and enquired if he
had ſeen Madame Cheron." "No," ſaid
he, "I have not yet ſeen her, for they told
me ſhe was engaged, and as ſoon as I
learned that you were in the gardens, I came
hither." He pauſed a moment, in great agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
and then added, "May I venture to
tell you the purport of my viſit, without
incurring your diſpleaſure, and to hope,
that you will not accuſe me of precipitation
in now availing myſelf of the permiſſion
you once gave me of addreſſing your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily?"
Emily, who knew not what to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
was ſpared from further perplexity, and
was ſenſible only of fear, when, on raiſing
her eyes, ſhe ſaw Madame Cheron turn into
the avenue. As the conſciouſneſs of inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
returned, this fear was ſo far diſſipated
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:0247300301:353"/>
as to permit her to appear tranquil, and,
inſtead of avoiding her aunt, ſhe advanced
with Valancourt to meet her. The look of
haughty and impatient diſpleaſure, with which
Madame Cheron regarded them, made Emily
ſhrink, who underſtood from a ſingle glance,
that this meeting was believed to have been
more than accidental: having mentioned
Valancourt's name, ſhe became again too
much agitated to remain with them, and
returned into the chateau; where ſhe
awaited long, in a ſtate of trembling anxiety,
the concluſion of the conference. She
knew not how to account for Valancourt's
viſit to her aunt, before he had received the
permiſſion he ſolicited, ſince ſhe was ignorant
of a circumſtance, which would have rendered
the requeſt uſeleſs, even if Madame Cheron
had been inclined to grant it. Valancourt,
in the agitation of his ſpirits, had forgotten
to date his letter, ſo that it was impoſſible
for Madame Cheron to return an anſwer;
and, when he recollected this circumſtance,
he was, perhaps, not ſo ſorry for the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:0247300301:354"/>
as glad of the excuſe it allowed him
for waiting on her before ſhe could ſend a
refuſal.</p>
            <p>Madame Cheron had a long converſation
with Valancourt, and, when ſhe returned to
the chateau, her countenance expreſſed ill
humour, but not the degree of ſeverity,
which Emily had apprehended. "I have
diſmiſſed this young man, at laſt," ſaid ſhe,
"and I hope my houſe will never again
be diſturbed with ſimilar viſits. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
me, that your interview was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerted."</p>
            <p>"Dear madam!" ſaid Emily in extreme
emotion, "you ſurely did not aſk him the
queſtion!" "Moſt certainly I did; you
could not ſuppoſe I ſhould be ſo imprudent
as to neglect it."</p>
            <p>"Good God!" exclaimed Emily, "what
an opinion muſt he form of me, ſince you,
Madam, could expreſs a ſuſpicion of ſuch
ill conduct!"</p>
            <p>"It is of very little conſequence what
opinion he may form of you," replied her
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:0247300301:355"/>
aunt, "for I have put an end to the affair;
but I believe he will not form a worſe opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of me for my prudent conduct. I let
him ſee, that I was not to be trifled with;
and that I had more delicacy, than to permit
any clandeſtine correſpondence to be carried
on in my houſe."</p>
            <p>Emily had frequently heard Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron
uſe the word delicacy, but ſhe was now
more than uſually perplexed to underſtand
how ſhe meant to apply it in this inſtance,
in which her whole conduct appeared to
merit the very reverſe of the term.</p>
            <p>"It was very inconſiderate of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,"
reſumed Madame Cheron, "to leave
the trouble of overlooking your conduct to
me; I wiſh you was well ſettled in life. But if
I find, that I am to be further troubled with
ſuch viſitors as this M. Valancourt, I ſhall
place you in a convent at once;—ſo remember
the alternative. This young man has the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence
to own to me,—he owns it! that
his fortune is very ſmall, and that he is
chiefly dependent on an elder brother and
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:0247300301:356"/>
on the profeſſion he has choſen! He ſhould
have concealed theſe circumſtances, at leaſt,
if he expected to ſucceed with me. Had he
the preſumption to ſuppoſe I would marry
my niece to a perſon ſuch as he deſcribes
himſelf!"</p>
            <p>Emily dried her tears when ſhe heard of
the candid confeſſion of Valancourt; and,
though the circumſtances it diſcovered were
afflicting to her hopes, his artleſs conduct
gave her a degree of pleaſure, that overcame
every other emotion. But ſhe was compelled,
even thus early in life, to obſerve, that good
ſenſe and noble integrity are not always ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to cope with folly and narrow cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
and her heart was pure enough to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
her, even at this trying moment, to look
with more pride on the defeat of the former,
than with mortification on the conqueſts of
the latter.</p>
            <p>Madame Cheron purſued her triumph.—"He
has alſo thought proper to tell me,
that he will receive his diſmiſſion from no
perſon but yourſelf; this favour, however,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:0247300301:357"/>
I have abſolutely refuſed him. He ſhall
learn, that it is quite ſufficient, that I diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
him. And I take this opportunity of
repeating,—that if you concert any means of
interview unknown to me, you ſhall leave
my houſe immediately."</p>
            <p>"How little do you know me, madam,
that you ſhould think ſuch an injunction
neceſſary!" ſaid Emily, trying to ſuppreſs
her emotion, "how little of the dear pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
who educated me!"</p>
            <p>Madame Cheron now went to dreſs for an
engagement, which ſhe had made for the
evening; and Emily, who would gladly
have been excuſed from attending her aunt,
did not aſk to remain at home leſt her requeſt
ſhould be attributed to an improper motive.
When ſhe retired to her own room, the little
fortitude, which had ſupported her in the
preſence of her relation, forſook her; ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered
only that Valancourt, whoſe cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
appeared more amiable from every
circumſtance, that unfolded it, was baniſhed
from her preſence, perhaps, for ever, and
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:0247300301:358"/>
ſhe paſſed the time in weeping, which, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to her aunt's direction, ſhe ought to
have employed in dreſſing. This important
duty was, however, quickly diſpatched;
though, when ſhe joined Madame Cheron
at table, her eyes betrayed, that ſhe had been
in tears, and drew upon her a ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof.</p>
            <p>Her efforts to appear cheerful did not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
fail when ſhe joined the company at the
houſe of Madame Clairval, an elderly widow
lady, who had lately come to reſide at Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louse,
on an eſtate of her late huſband. She had
lived many years at Paris in a ſplendid ſtyle;
had naturally a gay temper, and, ſince her
reſidence at Tholouſe, had given ſome of the
moſt magnificent entertainments, that had
been ſeen in that neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>Theſe excited not only the envy, but the
trifling ambition of Madame Cheron, who,
ſince ſhe could not rival the ſplendour of
her feſtivities, was deſirous of being ranked
in the number of her moſt intimate friends.
For this purpoſe ſhe paid her the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequious
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0247300301:359"/>
ſequious attention, and made a point of being
diſengaged, whenever ſhe received an invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
from Madame Clairval, of whom ſhe
talked, wherever ſhe went, and derived much
ſelf-conſequence from impreſſing a belief
on her general acquaintance, that they were
on the moſt familiar footing.</p>
            <p>The entertainments of this evening con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
of a ball and ſupper; it was a fancy
ball, and the company danced in groups in
the gardens, which were very extenſive.
The high and luxuriant trees, under which
the groups aſſembled, were illuminated with
a profuſion of lamps, diſpoſed with taſte and
fancy. The gay and various dreſſes of the
company, ſome of whom were ſeated on the
turf, converſing at their eaſe, obſerving
the cotillons, taking refreſhments, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
touching ſportively a guitar; the
gallant manners of the gentlemen, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely
capricious air of the ladies; the
light fantaſtic ſteps of their dances; the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
with the lute, the hautboy, and the
tabor, ſeated at the foot of an elm, and the
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:0247300301:360"/>
ſylvan ſcenery of woods around were cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances,
that unitedly formed a charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic
and ſtriking picture of French feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity.
Emily ſurveyed the gaiety of the ſcene
with a melancholy kind of pleaſure, and her
emotion may be imagined when, as ſhe ſtood
with her aunt, looking at one of the groups,
ſhe perceived Valancourt; ſaw him dancing
with a young and beautiful lady, ſaw him
converſing with her with a mixture of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
and familiarity, ſuch as ſhe had ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
obſerved in his manner. She turned
haſtily from the ſcene, and attempted to
draw away Madame Cheron, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versing
with Signor Cavigni, and neither
perceived Valancourt, or was willing to
be interrupted. A faintneſs ſuddenly came
over Emily, and, unable to ſupport herſelf,
ſhe ſat down on a turf bank beneath the
trees, where ſeveral other perſons were
ſeated. One of theſe, obſerving the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme
paleneſs of her countenance, enquired
if ſhe was ill, and begged ſhe would allow
him to fetch her a glaſs of water, for which
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:0247300301:361"/>
politeneſs ſhe thanked him, but did not
accept it. Her apprehenſion leſt Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
ſhould obſerve her emotion made her
anxious to overcome it, and ſhe ſucceeded
ſo far as to re-compoſe her countenance.
Madame Cheron was ſtill conversing with
Cavigni; and the Count Bauvillers, who
had addreſſed Emily, made ſome obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
upon the ſcene; to which ſhe anſwered
almoſt unconſciouſly, for her mind was ſtill
occupied with the idea of Valancourt, to
whom it was with extreme uneaſineſs that
ſhe remained ſo near. Some remarks, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
which the Count made upon the dance
obliged her to turn her eyes towards it, and,
at that moment, Valancourt's met hers. Her
colour faded again, ſhe felt, that ſhe was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapsing
into faintneſs, and inſtantly averted
her looks, but not before ſhe had obſerved
the altered countenance of Valancourt, on
perceiving her. She would have left the
ſpot immediately, had ſhe not been conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
that this conduct would have ſhewn
him more obviouſly the intereſt he held in
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:0247300301:362"/>
her heart; and, having tried to attend to
the Count's converſation and to join in it,
ſhe, at length, recovered her ſpirits. But,
when he made ſome obſervation on Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court's
partner, the fear of ſhewing, that ſhe
was intereſted in the remark, would have
betrayed it to him, had not the Count,
while he ſpoke, looked towards the perſon
of whom he was ſpeaking. "The lady,"
ſaid he, "dancing with that young cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier,
who appears to be accompliſhed in
every thing, but in dancing, is ranked
among the beauties of Tholouſe. She is
handſome, and her fortune will be very
large, I hope ſhe will make a better choice
in a partner for life than ſhe has done in a
partner for the dance, for I obſerve he has
juſt put the ſet into great confuſion; he does
nothing but commit blunders. I am ſurpriſed,
that, with his air and figure, he has
not taken more care to accompliſh himſelf
in dancing."</p>
            <p>Emily, whoſe heart trembled at every
word, that was now uttered, endeavoured to
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0247300301:363"/>
turn the converſation from Valancourt, by
enquiring the name of the lady, with whom
he danced; but, before the Count could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply,
the dance concluded, and Emily, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that Valancourt was coming towards
her, roſe and joined Madame Cheron.</p>
            <p>"Here is the Chevalier Valancourt, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,"
ſaid ſhe in a whiſper, "pray let us
go." Her aunt immediately moved on, but
not before Valancourt had reached them, who
bowed lowly to Madame Cheron, and with
an earneſt and dejected look to Emily, with
whom, notwithſtanding all her effort, an air
of more than common reſerve prevailed.
The preſence of Madame Cheron prevented
Valancourt from remaining, and he paſſed
on with a countenance, whoſe melancholy
reproached her for having increaſed it.
Emily was called from the muſing fit, into
which he had fallen, by the Count Bauvil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
who was known to her aunt.</p>
            <p>"I have your pardon to beg, ma'amſelle,"
ſaid he, "for a rudeneſs, which you will
readily believe was quite, unintentional. I
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:0247300301:364"/>
did not know, that the Chevalier was your
acquaintance, when I ſo freely criticiſed his
dancing." Emily bluſhed and ſmiled, and
Madame Cheron ſpared her the difficulty of
replying. "If you mean the perſon, who
has juſt paſſed us," ſaid ſhe, "I can aſſure
you he is no acquaintance of either mine, or
ma'amſelle St. Aubert's: I know nothing
of him."</p>
            <p>"O! that is the chevalier Valancourt,"
ſaid Cavigni careleſsly, and looking back.
"You know him then?" ſaid Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.
"I am not acquainted with him," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Cavigni. "You don't know, then, the
reaſon I have to call him impertinent;—he
as had the preſumption to admire my niece!"</p>
            <p>"If every man deſerves the title of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent,
who admires ma'amſelle St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,
"replied Cavigni, "I fear there are
a great many impertinents, and I am will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to acknowledge myſelf one of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber."</p>
            <p>"O ſignor!" ſaid Madame Cheron, with
an affected ſmile, "I perceive you have
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:0247300301:365"/>
learnt the art of complimenting, ſince you
came into France. But it is cruel to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
children, ſince they miſtake flattery
for truth."</p>
            <p>Cavigni turned away his face for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and then ſaid with a ſtudied air,
"Whom then are we to compliment, madam?
for it would be abſurd to compliment a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
of refined underſtanding; <hi>ſhe</hi> is above
all praiſe." As he finiſhed the ſentence
he gave Emily a ſly look, and the ſmile, that
had lurked in his eye, ſtole forth. She per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
underſtood it, and bluſhed for Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron, who replied, "You are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
right, ſignor, no woman of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
can endure compliment."</p>
            <p>"I have heard ſignor Montoni ſay," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined
Cavigni, "that he never knew but
one woman who deſerved it."</p>
            <p>"Well!" exclaimed Madame Cheron,
with a ſhort laugh, and a ſmile of unutterable
complacency, "and who could ſhe be?"</p>
            <p>"O!" replied Cavigni, "it is impoſſible
to miſtake her, for certainly there is not
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0247300301:366"/>
more than one woman in the world, who
has both the merit to deſerve compliment
and the wit to refuſe it. Moſt women re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
the caſe entirely." He looked again
at Emily, who bluſhed deeper than before
for her aunt, and turned from him with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
            <p>"Well, ſignor!" ſaid Madame Cheron,
"I proteſt you are a Frenchman; I never
heard a foreigner ſay any thing half ſo gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant
as that!"</p>
            <p>"True, madam," ſaid the Count, who
had been ſome time ſilent, and with a low
bow, "but the gallantry of the compliment
had been utterly loſt, but for the ingenuity
that diſcovered the application."</p>
            <p>Madame Cheron did not perceive the
meaning of this too ſatirical ſentence, and
ſhe, therefore, eſcaped the pain, which Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
felt on her account. "O! here comes
ſignor Montoni himſelf," ſaid her aunt, "I
proteſt I will tell him all the fine things
you have been ſaying to me." The ſignor,
however, paſſed at this moment into another
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0247300301:367"/>
walk. "Pray, who is it, that has ſo much
engaged your friend this evening?" aſked
Madame Cheron, with an air of chagrin,
"I have not ſeen him once."</p>
            <p>"He hid a very particular engagement
with the Marquis I a Rivière," replied Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigni,
"which has detained him, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive,
till this moment, or he would have
done himſelf the honour of paying his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spects
to you, madam, ſooner, as he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned
me to ſay. But, I know not how
it is—your converſation is ſo faſcinating—that
it can charm even memory, I think, or
I ſhould certainly have delivered my friend's
apology before."</p>
            <p>"The apology, fir, would have been more
ſatisfactory from himſelf," ſaid Madame
Cheron, whoſe vanity was more mortified by
Montoni's neglect, than flattered by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigni's
compliment. Her manner, at this
moment, and Cavigni's late converſation,
now awakened a ſuſpicion inEmily's mind,
which, notwithſtanding that ſome recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
ſerved to confirm it appeared prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous.
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:0247300301:368"/>
She thought ſhe perceived, that
Montoni was paying ſerious addreſſes to
her aunt, and that ſhe not only accepted
them, but was jealouſly watchful of any
appearance of neglect on his part.—That
Madame Cheron at her years ſhould
elect a ſecond huſband was ridiculous,
though her vanity made it not impoſſible;
but that Montoni, with his diſcernment,
his figure, and pretenſions, ſhould make a
choice of Madame Cheron—appeared moſt
wonderful. Her thoughts, however, did
not dwell long on the ſubject; nearer inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts
preſſed upon them; Valancourt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
of her aunt, and Valancourt dancing
with a gay and beautiful partner, alternately
tormented her mind. As ſhe paſſed along
the gardens ſhe looked timidly forward, half
fearing and half hoping that he might
appear in the crowd; and the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
ſhe felt on not ſeeing him, told her,
that ſhe had hoped more than ſhe had feared.</p>
            <p>Montoni ſoon after joined the party.
He muttered over ſome ſhort ſpeech about
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:0247300301:369"/>
regret for having been ſo long detained
elſewhere, when he knew he ſhould have the
pleaſure of ſeeing Madame Cheron here; and
ſhe, receiving the apology with the air of a
pettiſh girl, addreſſed herſelf entirely to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigni,
who looked archly at Montoni, as if
he would have ſaid, "I will not triumph
over you too much; I will have the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to bear my honours meekly; but look
ſharp, ſignor, or I ſhall certainly run away
with your prize."</p>
            <p>The ſupper was ſerved in different pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
in the gardens, as well as in one large
ſaloon of the chateau, and with more of
taſte, than either of ſplendour, or even of
plenty. Madame Cheron and her party
ſupped with Madame Clairval in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loon,
and Emily, with difficulty, diſguiſed
her emotion, when ſhe ſaw Valancourt placed
at the ſame table with herſelf. There, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron having ſurveyed him with
high diſpleaſure, ſaid to ſome perſon who
ſat next to her, "Pray, who <hi>is</hi> that young
man?" "It is the Chevalier Valancourt,"
was the anſwer. "Yes, I am not ignorant
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0247300301:370"/>
of his name, but who is this Chevalier Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
that thus intrudes himſelf at this
table?" The attention of the perſon, to
whom ſhe ſpoke, was called off before ſhe
received a ſecond reply. The table, at
which they ſat, was very long, and, Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
being ſeated, with his partner, near
the bottom, and Emily near the top, the
diſtance between them may account for his
not immediately perceiving her. She avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
looking to that end of the table, but,
whenever her eyes happened to glance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
it, ſhe obſerved him converſing
with his beautiful companion, and the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
did not contribute to reſtore her
peace, any more than the accounts ſhe
heard of the fortune and accompliſhments of
this ſame lady.</p>
            <p>Madame Cheron, to whom theſe remarks
were ſometimes addreſſed, becauſe they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
topics for trivial converſation, ſeemed
indefatigable in her attempts to depreciate
Valancourt, towards whom ſhe felt all the
petty reſentment of a narrow pride, "I
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:0247300301:371"/>
admire the lady," ſaid ſhe, "but I muſt
condemn her choice of a partner." "Oh,
the Chevalier Valancourt is one of the moſt
accompliſhed young men we have," replied
the lady, to whom this remark was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed;
"it is whiſpered, that Mademoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle
D'Emery, and her very large fortune,
are to be his."</p>
            <p>"Impoſſible!" exclaimed Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
reddening with vexation," it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
that ſhe can be ſo deſtitute of taſte; he
has ſo little the air of a perſon of condition,
that, if I did not ſee him at the table of
Madame Clairval, I ſhould never have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
him to be one. I have beſides par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
reaſons for believing the report to
be erroneous."</p>
            <p>"I cannot doubt the truth of it," replied
the lady gravely, diſguſted by the abrupt
contradiction ſhe had received, concerning
her opinion of Valancourt's merit. "You
will, perhaps, doubt it," ſaid Madame
Cheron, "when I aſſure you, that it was
only this morning that I rejected his ſuit."
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:0247300301:372"/>
This was ſaid without any intention of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
the meaning it conveyed, but ſimply
from a habit of conſidering herſelf to be the
moſt important perſon in every affair that
concerned her niece, and becauſe literally
ſhe had rejected Valancourt. "Your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
are indeed ſuch as cannot be doubted,"
replied the lady, with an ironical ſmile.—"Any
more than the diſcernment of the
Chevalier Valancourt," added Cavigni,
who ſtood by the chair of Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron,
and had heard her arrogate to herſelf,
as he thought, a diſtinction which had been
paid to her niece. "His diſcernment <hi>may</hi>
be juſtly queſtioned, ſignor," ſaid Madame
Cheron, who was not flattered by what ſhe
underſtood to be an encomium upon Emily.</p>
            <p>"Alas!" exclaimed Cavigni, ſurveying
Madame Cheron with affected ecſtaſy,
"how vain is that aſſertion, while that face—that
ſhape—that air—combine to refute
it! Unhappy Valancourt! his diſcernment
has been his deſtruction."</p>
            <p>Emily looked ſurpriſed and embarraſſed;
the lady, who had lately ſpoken, aſtoniſhed,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0247300301:373"/>
and Madame Cheron, who, though ſhe
did not perfectly underſtand this ſpeech,
was very ready to believe herſelf compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by it, ſaid ſmilingly, "O Signor!
you are very gallant; but thoſe, who hear
you vindicate the chevalier's diſcernment,
will ſuppoſe that I am the object of it."</p>
            <p>"They cannot doubt it," replied Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigni,
bowing low.</p>
            <p>"And would not that be very mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Signor?"</p>
            <p>"Unqueſtionably it would," ſaid Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigni.</p>
            <p>"I cannot endure the thought," ſaid
Madame Cheron.</p>
            <p>"It is not to be endured," replied Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigni.</p>
            <p>"What can be done to prevent ſo humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating a miſtake?" rejoined Madame Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</p>
            <p>"Alas! I cannot aſſiſt you," replied Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigni, with a deliberating air. "Your only
chance of refuting the calumny, and of
making people underſtand what you wiſh
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0247300301:374"/>
them to believe, is to perſiſt in your firſt
aſſertion; for, when they are told of the
chevalier's want of diſcernment, it is poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
they may ſuppoſe he never preſumed to
diſtreſs you with his admiration.—But then
again—that diffidence, which renders you
ſo inſenſible to your own perfections—they
will conſider this, and Valancourt's taſte
will not be doubted, though you arraign it.
In ſhort, they will, in ſpite of your endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours,
continue to believe, what might very
naturally have occurred to them without
any hint of mine—that the chevalier has
taſte enough to admire a beautiful woman."</p>
            <p>"All this is very diſtreſſing!" ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron, with a profound ſigh.</p>
            <p>"May I be allowed to aſk what is ſo
diſtreſſing?" ſaid Madame Clairval, who
was ſtruck with the rueful countenance and
doleful accent, with which this was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
            <p>"It is a delicate ſubject," replied Madame
Cheron, "a very mortifying one to me."
"I am concerned to hear it," ſaid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:0247300301:375"/>
dame Clairval, "I hope nothing has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred,
this evening, particularly to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs you?"
"Alas, yes! within this half
hour; and I know not where the report
may end;—my pride was never ſo ſhocked
before, but I aſſure yon the report is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
void of foundation." "Good God!"
exclaimed Madame Clairval, "what can be
done? Can you point out any way, by
which I can aſſiſt, or conſole you?"</p>
            <p>"The only way, by which you can do
either," replied Madame Cheron, "is to
contradict the report wherever you go."</p>
            <p>"Well! but pray inform me what I am
to contradict."</p>
            <p>"It is ſo very humiliating, that I know
not how to mention it," continued Madame
Cheron, "but you ſhall judge. Do you
obſerve that young man ſeated near the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom
of the table, who is converſing with
Mademoiſelle D'Emery?" "Yes, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
whom you mean." "You obſerve
how little he has the air of a perſon of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition;
I was ſaying juſt now, that I ſhould
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0247300301:376"/>
not have thought him a gentleman, if I
had not ſeen him at this table." "Well!
but the report," ſaid Madame Clairva,
"let me underſtand the ſubject of your di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs."
"Ah! the ſubject of my diſtreſs,"
replied Madame Cheron; "this perſon,
whom nobody knows—(I beg pardon, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,
I did not conſider what I ſaid)—this
impertinent young man, having had the
preſumption to addreſs my niece, has, I
fear, given riſe to a report, that he had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
himſelf my admirer. Now only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
how very mortifying ſuch a report muſt
be! You, I know, will feel for my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
A woman of my condition!—think
how degrading even the rumour of ſuch
an alliance muſt be."</p>
            <p>"Degrading indeed, my poor friend!"
ſaid Madame Clairval. "You may rely upon
it I will contradict the report wherever I
go;"
as ſhe ſaid which, ſhe turned her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
upon another part of the company;
and Cavigni, who had hitherto appeared a
grave ſpectator of the ſcene, now fearing
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:0247300301:377"/>
he ſhould be unable to ſmother the laugh,
that convulſed him, walked abruptly away.</p>
            <p>"I perceive you do not know," ſaid the
lady who ſat near Madame Cheron, "that
the gentleman you have been ſpeaking of is
Madame Clairval's nephew!" "Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble!"
exclaimed Madame Cheron, who now
began to perceive, that ſhe had been totally
miſtaken in her judgment of Valancourt,
and to praiſe him aloud with as much ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility,
as ſhe had before cenſured him with
frivolous malignity.</p>
            <p>Emily, who, during the greater part of
this converſation, had been ſo abſorbed in
thought as to be ſpared the pain of hearing
it, was now extremely ſurpriſed by her
aunt's praiſe of Valancourt, with whoſe
relationſhip to Madame Clairval ſhe was
unacquainted; but ſhe was not ſorry when
Madame Cheron, who, though ſhe now
tried to appear unconcerned, was really much
embarraſſed, prepared to withdraw imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
after ſupper. Montoni then came to
hand Madame Cheron to her carriage, and
Cavigni, with an arch ſolemnity of counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:0247300301:378"/>
nance, followed with Emily, who, as she
wiſhed them good night, and drew up the
glaſs, ſaw Valancourt among the crowd at
the gates. Before the carriage drove off,
he diſappeared. Madame Cheron forbore
to mention him to Emily, and, as ſoon as
they reached the chateau, they ſeparated for
the night.</p>
            <p>On the following morning, as Emily ſat
at breakfaſt with her aunt, a letter was
brought to her, of which ſhe knew the
hand-writing upon the cover; and, as ſhe
received it with a trembling hand, Madame
Cheron haſtily enquired from whom it
came. Emily, with her leave, broke the
ſeal, and, obſerving the ſignature of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
gave it unread to her aunt, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
it with impatience; and, as ſhe
looked it over, Emily endeavoured to
read on her countenance its contents. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
returned the letter to her niece, whoſe
eyes aſked if ſhe might examine it, "Yes,
read it, child," ſaid Madame Cheron, in
a manner leſs ſevere than ſhe had expected,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:0247300301:379"/>
and Emily had, perhaps, never before ſo
willingly obeyed her aunt. In this letter
Valancourt ſaid little of the interview of
the preceding day, but concluded with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,
that he would accept his diſmiſſion
from Emily only, and with entreating, that
ſhe would allow him to wait upon her, on
the approaching evening. When ſhe read
this, ſhe was aſtoniſhed at the moderation of
Madame Cheron, and looked at her with
timid expectation, as ſhe ſaid ſorrowfully—"What
am I to ſay, madam?"</p>
            <p>"Why—we muſt ſee the young man, I
believe," replied her aunt, "and hear what
he has further to ſay for himſelf. You
may tell him he may come." Emily dared
ſcarcely credit what ſhe heard. "Yet, ſtay,"
added Madame Cheron, "I will tell him ſo
myſelf." She called for pen and ink;
Emily ſtill not daring to truſt the emotions
ſhe felt, and almoſt ſinking beneath them.
Her ſurpriſe would have been leſs had ſhe
overheard, on the preceding evening, what
Madame Cheron had not forgotten—that
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0247300301:380"/>
Valancourt was the nephew of Madame
Clairval.</p>
            <p>"What were the "particulars of her aunt's
note Emily did not learn, but the reſult was
a viſit from Valancourt in the evening,
whom Madame Cheron received alone,
and they had a long converſation before
Emily was called down. When ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the room, her aunt was converſing
with complacency, and ſhe ſaw the eyes of
Valancourt, as he impatiently roſe, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated
with hope.</p>
            <p>"We have been talking over this affair,"
ſaid Madame Cheron," the chevalier has
been telling me, that the late Monſieur
Clairval was the brother of the Counteſs de
Duvarney, his mother. I only wiſh he had
mentioned his relationſhip to Madame
Clairval before, I certainly ſhould have
conſidered that circumſtance as a ſufficient
introduction to my houſe." Valancourt
bowed, and was going to addreſs Emily,
but her aunt prevented him. "I have,
therefore, conſented, that you ſhall receive
his viſits; and, though I will not bind
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0247300301:381"/>
myſelf by any promiſe, or ſay, that I ſhall
conſider him as my nephew, yet I ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
the intercourſe, and ſhall look forward
to any further connection as an event,
which may poſſibly take place in a courſe
of years, provided the chevalier riſes in his
profeſſion, or any circumſtance occurs,
which may make it prudent for him to
take a wife. But Monſ. Valancourt will
obſerve, and you too, Emily, that, till that
happens, I poſitively forbid any thoughts
of marrying."</p>
            <p>Emily's countenance, during this coarſe
ſpeech, varied every inſtant, and, towards
its concluſion, her diſtreſs had ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed,
that ſhe was on the point of leaving
the room. Valancourt, meanwhile, ſcarcely
leſs embarraſſed, did not dare to look at
her, for whom he was thus diſtreſſed; but,
when Madame Cheron was ſilent, he ſaid,
"Flattering, madam, as your approbation
is to me—highly as I am honoured by it—I
have yet ſo much to fear, that I ſcarcely
dare to hope." "Pray, ſir, explain your-ſelf,"
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0247300301:382"/>
ſelf," ſaid Madame Cheron; an unexpected
requiſition, which embarraſſed Valancourt
again, and almoſt overcame him with confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
at circumſtances, on which, had he been
only a ſpectator of the ſcene, he would have
ſmiled.</p>
            <p>"Till I receive Mademoiſelle St. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert's
permiſſion to accept your indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,"
ſaid he, falteringly—" till ſhe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
me to hope—"</p>
            <p>"O! is that all?" interrupted Madame
Cheron. "Well, I will take upon me to
anſwer for her. But at the ſame time, ſir,
give me leave to obſerve to you, that I am
her guardian, and that I expect, in every
inſtance, that my will is hers."</p>
            <p>As ſhe ſaid this, ſhe roſe and quitted the
room, leaving Emily and Valancourt in a
ſtate of mutual embarraſſment; and, when
Valancourt's hopes enabled him to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
his fears, and to addreſs her with the
zeal and ſincerity ſo natural to him, it was
a conſiderable time before ſhe was ſuſfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:0247300301:383"/>
recovered to hear with diſtinctneſs his
ſolicitations and enquiries.</p>
            <p>The conduct of Madame Cheron in this
affair had been entirely governed by ſelfiſh
vanity. Valancourt, in his firſt interview,
had with great candour laid open to her
the true ſtate of his preſent circumſtances,
and his future expectancies, and ſhe, with
more prudence than humanity, had abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely
and abruptly rejected his ſuit. She
wiſhed her niece to marry ambitiouſly, not
becauſe ſhe deſired to ſee her in poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of the happineſs, which rank and
wealth are uſually believed to beſtow, but
becauſe ſhe deſired to partake the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
which ſuch an alliance would give,
When, therefore, ſhe diſcovered that Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
was the nephew of a perſon of ſo
much conſequence as Madame Clairval, ſhe
became anxious for the connection, ſince
the proſpect it afforded of future fortune
and diſtinction for Emily, promiſed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation
ſhe coveted for herſelf. Her cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
concerning fortune in this alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:0247300301:384"/>
were guided rather by her wiſhes,
than by any hint of Valancourt or ſtrong
appearance of probability; and, when ſhe
reſted her expectation on the wealth of
Madame Clairval, ſhe ſeemed totally to have
forgotten, that the latter had a daughter.
Valancourt, however, had not forgotten this
circumſtance, and the conſideration of it
had made him ſo modeſt in his expectations
from Madame Clairval, that he had not even
named the relationſhip in his firſt converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
with Madame Cheron. But, whatever
might be the future fortune of Emily, the
preſent diſtinction, which the connection
would afford for herſelf; was certain, ſince
the ſplendour of Madame Clairval's eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
was ſuch as to excite the general
envy and partial imitation of the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood.
Thus had ſhe conſented to
involve her niece in an engagement, to
which ſhe ſaw only a diſtant and uncertain
concluſion, with as little conſideration of her
happineſs, as when ſhe had ſo precipitately
forbade it: for though ſhe herſelf poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0247300301:385"/>
the means of rendering this union not
only certain, but prudent, yet to do ſo was
no part of her preſent intention.</p>
            <p>From this period Valancourt made fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
viſits to Madame Cheron, and Emily
paſſed in his ſociety the happieſt hours ſhe
had known ſince the death of her father.
They were both too much engaged by the
preſent moments to give ſerious conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to the future. They loved and were
beloved, and ſaw not, that the very attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which formed the delight of their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent days, might poſſibly occaſion the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings
of years. Meanwhile, Madame
Cheron's intercourſe with Madame Clair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
became more frequent than before, and
her vanity was already gratified by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity
of proclaiming, wherever ſhe
went, the attachment that ſubſiſted between
their nephew and niece.</p>
            <p>Montoni was now alſo become a daily
gueſt at the chateau, and Emily was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to obſerve, that he really was a fui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor,
and a favoured ſuitor, to her aunt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="374" facs="tcp:0247300301:386"/>
Thus paſſed the winter months, not only
in peace, but in happineſs, to Valancourt
and Emily; the ſtation of his regiment be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo near Tholouſe, as to allow this fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
intercourſe. The pavilion on the
terrace was the favourite ſcene of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terviews,
and there Emily, with Madame
Cheron, would work, while Valancourt
read aloud works of genius and taſte, liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
to her enthuſiaſm, expreſſed his own,
and caught new opportunities of obſerving,
that their minds were formed to conſtitute
the happineſs of each other, the ſame taſte,
the ſame noble and benevolent ſentiments
animating each.</p>

            <p>MADAME Cheron's avarice at length
yielded to her vanity. Some very ſplendid
entertainments, which Madame Clairval had
given, and the general adulation, which was
paid her, made the former more anxious
than before to ſecure an alliance, that would
ſo much exalt her in her own opinion and
in that of the world. She propoſed terms
for the immediate marriage of her niece,
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:0247300301:388"/>
and offered to give Emily a dower, provided
Madame Clairval obſerved equal terms, on
the part of her nephew. Madame Clairval
liſtened to the propoſal, and, conſidering
that Emily was the apparent heireſs of her
aunt's wealth, accepted it. Meanwhile,
Emily knew nothing of the tranſaction, till
Madame Cheron informed her, that ſhe muſt
make preparation for the nuptials, which
would be celebrated without further delay,
then, aſtoniſhed and wholly unable to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
for this ſudden concluſion, which Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
had not ſolicited (for he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant
of what had paſſed between the elder
ladies and had not dared to hope ſuch good
fortune), ſhe deciſively objected to it. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame
Cheron, however, quite as jealous of
contradiction now, as ſhe had been formerly,
contended for a ſpeedy marriage with as
much vehemence as ſhe had formerly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
whatever had the moſt remote poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
of leading to it; and Emily's ſcruples
diſappeared, when ſhe again ſaw Valancourt,
who was now informed of the happineſs, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0247300301:389"/>
ſigned for him, and came to claim a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
of it from herſelf.</p>
            <p>While preparations were making for theſe
nuptials, Montoni became the acknowledged
lover of Madame Cheron; and, though
Madame Clairval was much diſpleaſed,
when ſhe heard of the approaching connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and was willing to prevent that of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt
with Emily, her conſcience told
her, that ſhe had no right thus to trifle with
their peace, and Madame Clairval, though a
woman of faſhion, was far leſs advanced
than her friend in the art of deriving ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
from diſtinction and admiration, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
than from conſcience.</p>
            <p>Emily obſerved with concern the aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dancy,
which Montoni had acquired over
Madame Cheron, as well as the increaſing
frequency of his viſits; and her own opinion
of this Italian was confirmed by that of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
who had always expreſſed a diſlike
of him. As ſhe was, one morning, ſitting
at work in the pavilion, enjoying the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
freſhneſs of ſpring, whoſe colours were
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0247300301:390"/>
now ſpread upon the landſcape, and liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to Valancourt, who was reading, but
who often laid aſide the book to converſe,
ſhe received a ſummons to attend Madame
Cheron immediately, and had ſcarcely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
the dreſſing-room, when ſhe obſerved
with ſurpriſe the dejection of her aunt's
countenance, and the contraſted gaiety of
her dreſs. "So, niece!"—ſaid Madame,
and ſhe ſtopped under ſome degree of embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment.—"I
ſent for you,—I—I wiſhed
to ſee you; I have news to tell you. From
this hour you muſt conſider the ſignor
Montoni as your uncle—we were married
this morning."</p>
            <p>Aſtoniſhed—not ſo much at the marriage,
as at the ſecrecy with which it had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
and the agitation with which it was
announced, Emily, at length, attributed
the privacy to the wiſh of Montoni, rather
than of her aunt. His wife, however, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
that the contrary ſhould be believed,
and therefore added, "You ſee I wiſhed to
avoid a buſtle; but now the ceremony is
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0247300301:391"/>
over I ſhall do ſo no longer; and I wiſh
to announce to my ſervants, that they muſt
receive the ſignor Montoni for their maſter."
Emily made a feeble attempt to congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
her on theſe apparently imprudent nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials.
"I ſhall now celebrate my marriage
with ſome ſplendour," continued Madame
Montoni, "and to ſave time I ſhall avail
myſelf of the preparation that has been made
for yours, which will, of courſe, be delayed
a little while. Such of your wedding clothes
as are ready I ſhall expect you will appear
in, to do honour to this feſtival. I alſo
wiſh you to inform Monſieur Valancourt,
that I have changed my name, and he will
acquaint Madame Clairval. In a few days
I ſhall give a grand entertainment, at which
I ſhall requeſt their preſence."</p>
            <p>Emily was ſo loſt in ſurpriſe and various
thought, that ſhe made Madame Montoni
ſcarcely any reply, but, at her deſire, ſhe
returned to inform Valancourt of what had
paſſed. Surpriſe was not his predominant
emotion on hearing of theſe haſty nuptials;
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0247300301:392"/>
and, when he learned, that they were to be
the means of delaying his own, and that the
very ornaments of the chateau, which had
been prepared to grace the nuptial day of his
Emily, were to be degraded to the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Madame Montoni's, grief and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
agitated him alternately. He could
conceal neither from the obſervation of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
whoſe efforts to abſtract him from theſe
ſerious emotions, and to laugh at the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive
conſiderations, that aſſailed him,
were ineffectual; and, when, at length, he
took leave, there was an earneſt tenderneſs
in his manner, that extremely affected her;
ſhe even ſhed tears, when he diſappeared at
the end of the terrace, yet knew not exactly
why ſhe ſhould do ſo.</p>
            <p>Montoni now took poſſeſſion of the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau
and the command of its inhabitants,
with the eaſe of a man, who had long conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it to be his own. His friend Cavigni,
who had been extremely ſerviceable, in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
paid Madame Cheron the attention and
flattery, which ſhe required, but from which
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0247300301:393"/>
Montoni too often revolted, had apartments
aſſigned to him, and received from the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtics
an equal degree of obedience with
the maſter of the manſion.</p>
            <p>Within a few days, Madame Montoni, as
ſhe had promiſed, gave a magnificent enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment
to a very numerous company,
among whom was Valancourt; but at which
Madame Clairval excuſed herſelf from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending.
There was a concert, ball and
ſupper. Valancourt was, of courſe, Emily's
partner, and though, when he gave a look
to the decorations of the apartments, he
could not but remember, that they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
for other feſtivities, than thoſe they
now contributed to celebrate, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
to check his concern by conſidering,
that a little while only would elapſe before
they would be given to their original deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.
During this evening, Madame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni
danced, laughed and talked inceſſantly;
while Montoni, ſilent, reſerved and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
haughty, ſeemed weary of the parade,
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0247300301:394"/>
and of the frivolous company it had drawn
together.</p>
            <p>This was the firſt and the laſt entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
given in celebration of their nuptials.
Montoni, though the ſeverity of his temper
and the gloomineſs of his pride prevented
him from enjoying ſuch feſtivities, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
willing to promote them. It was
ſeldom, that he could meet in any company
a man of more addreſs, and ſtill ſeldomer
one of more underſtanding, than himſelf;
the balance of advantage in ſuch parties, or
in the connections, which might ariſe from
them, muſt, therefore, be on his ſide; and,
knowing, as he did, the ſelfiſh purpoſes, for
which they are generally frequented, he had
no objection to meaſure his talents of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation
with thoſe of any other competitor
for diſtinction and plunder. But his wife,
who, when her own intereſt was immediately
concerned, had ſometimes more diſcernment
than vanity, acquired a conſciouſneſs of her
inferiority to other women, in perſonal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractions,
which, uniting with the jealouſy
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0247300301:395"/>
natural to the diſcovery, counteracted his
readineſs for mingling with all the parties
Tholouſe could afford. Till ſhe had, as
ſhe ſuppoſed, the affections of an huſband to
loſe, ſhe had no motive for diſcovering the
unwelcome truth, and it had never obtruded
itſelf upon her; but, now that it influenced
her policy, ſhe oppoſed her huſband's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination
for company, with the more eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
becauſe ſhe believed him to be really as
well received in the female ſociety of the
place, as, during his addreſſes to her, he had
affected to be.</p>
            <p>A few weeks only had elapſed, ſince the
marriage, when Madame Montoni informed
Emily, that the ſignor intended to return to
Italy, as soon as the neceſſary preparation
could be made for ſo long a journey. "We
ſhall go to Venice," ſaid ſhe, "where the
ſignor has a fine manſion, and from thence
to his eſtate in Tuſcany. Why do you
look ſo grave, child?—You, who are ſo fond
of a romantic country and fine views, will
doubtleſs be delighted with this journey."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="384" facs="tcp:0247300301:396"/>
"Am I then to be of the party, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam?"
ſaid Emily, with extreme ſurpriſe
and emotion. "Moſt certainly," replied
her aunt, "how could you imagine we
ſhould leave you behind? But I ſee you are
thinking of the Chevalier; he is not yet, I
believe, informed of the journey, but he very
ſoon will be ſo. Signor Montoni is gone to
acquaint Madame Clairval of our journey,
and to ſay, that the propoſed connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
the families muſt from this time be
thought of no more."</p>
            <p>The unfeeling manner, in which Madame
Montoni thus informed her niece, that ſhe
muſt be ſeparated, perhaps for ever, from
the man, with whom ſhe was on the point of
being united for life, added to the diſmay,
which ſhe muſt otherwiſe have ſuffered at
ſuch intelligence. When ſhe could ſpeak
ſhe aſked the cauſe of the ſudden change in
Madame's ſentiments towards Valancourt,
but the only reply ſhe could obtain was,
that the Signor had forbade the connection,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0247300301:397"/>
conſidering it to be greatly inferior to what
Emily might reaſonably expect.</p>
            <p>"I now leave the affair entirely to the Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,"
added Madame Montoni, "but I muſt
ſay, that M. Valancourt never was a favourite
with me, and I was overperſuaded, or I
ſhould not have given my conſent to the
connection. I was weak enough—I am ſo
fooliſh ſometimes!—to ſuffer other people's
uneaſineſs to affect me, and ſo my better
judgment yielded to your affliction. But
the Signor has very properly pointed out
the folly of this, and he ſhall not have to
reprove me a ſecond time. I am determined,
that you ſhall ſubmit to thoſe, who know
how to guide you better than yourſelf—I am
determined, that you ſhall be conformable."</p>
            <p>Emily would have been aſtoniſhed at the
aſſertions of this eloquent ſpeech, had not
her mind been ſo overwhelmed by the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ſhock it had received, that ſhe ſcarcely
heard a word of what was latterly addreſſed
to her. Whatever were the weakneſſes of
Madame Montoni, ſhe might have avoided
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:0247300301:398"/>
to accuſe herſelf with thoſe of compaſſion
and tenderneſs to the feelings of others, and
eſpecially to thoſe of Emily. It was the
ſame ambition, that lately prevailed upon
her to ſolicit an alliance with Madame
Clairval's family, which induced her to
withdraw from it, now that her marriage
with Montoni had exalted her ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence,
and, with it, her views for her
niece.</p>
            <p>Emily was, at this time, too much affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to employ either remonſtrance, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaty
on this topic; and when, at length,
ſhe attempted the latter, her emotion over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
her ſpeech, and ſhe retired to her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
to think, if in the preſent ſtate of her
mind to think was poſſible, upon this ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
and overwhelming ſubject. It was very
long, before her ſpirits were ſufficiently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to permit the reflection, which, when
it came, was dark and even terrible. She
ſaw, that Montoni sought to aggrandiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in his diſpoſal of her, and it occurred,
that his friend Cavigni was the perſon, for
<pb n="387" facs="tcp:0247300301:399"/>
whom he was intereſted. The proſpect of
going to Italy was ſtill rendered darker,
when ſhe conſidered the tumultuous ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of that country, then torn by civil com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion,
where every petty ſtate was at war
with its neighbour, and even every caſtle
liable to the attack of an invader. She conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
the perſon, to whoſe immediate guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
ſhe would be committed, and the vaſt
diſtance, that was to ſeparate her from Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
and, at the recollection of him, every
other image vaniſhed from her mind, and
every thought was again obſcured by grief.</p>
            <p>In this perturbed ſtate ſhe paſſed ſome
hours, and, when ſhe was ſummoned to din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner,
ſhe entreated permiſſion to remain
in her own apartment; but Madame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni
was alone, and the requeſt was refuſed.
Emily and her aunt ſaid little during the
repaſt; the one occupied by her griefs, the
otherengroſſed by the diſappointment, which
the unexpected abſence of Montoni occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned;
for not only was her vanity piqued
by the neglect, but her jealouſy alarmed by
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0247300301:400"/>
what ſhe conſidered as a myſterious engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.
When the cloth was drawn and they
were alone, Emily renewed the mention of
Valancourt; but her aunt, neither ſoftened
to pity, or awakened to remorſe, became
enraged, that her will ſhould be oppoſed,
and the authority of Montoni queſtioned,
though this was done by Emily with her
uſual gentleneſs, who, after a long, and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
converſation, retired in tears.</p>
            <p>As ſhe croſſed the hall, a perſon entered
it by the great door, whom, as her eyes
haſtily glanced that way, ſhe imagined to be
Montoni, and ſhe was paſſing on with quicker
ſteps, when ſhe heard the well-known voice
of Valancourt.</p>
            <p>"Emily, O! my Emily!" cried he in a tone
faltering with impatience, while ſhe turned,
and, as he advanced, was alarmed at the
expreſſion of his countenance and the eager
deſperation of his air. "In tears, Emily!
I would ſpeak with you," ſaid he, "I
have much to ſay; conduct me where we
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:0247300301:401"/>
may converſe. But you tremble—you are
ill! Let me lead you to a ſeat."</p>
            <p>He obſerved the open door of an apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and haſtily took her hand to lead
her thither; but ſhe attempted to withdraw
it, and ſaid, with a languid ſmile, "I am
better already; if you wiſh to ſee my aunt
ſhe is in the dining-parlour." "I muſt
ſpeak with <hi>you,</hi> my Emily," replied Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
"Good God! is it already come to
this? Are you indeed ſo willing to reſign
me? But this is an improper place—I am
overheard. Let me entreat your attention,
if only for a few minutes." "When you
have ſeen my aunt," ſaid Emily. "I was
wretched enough when I came hither," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
Valancourt, "do not increaſe my
miſery by this coldneſs—this cruel refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal."</p>
            <p>The deſpondency, with which he ſpoke
this, affected her almoſt to tears, but ſhe
perſiſted in refuſing to hear him, till he had
converſed with Madame Montoni. "Where
is her huſband, where, then, is Montoni?"
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0247300301:402"/>
ſaid Valancourt, in an altered tone, "it is
he, to whom I muſt ſpeak."</p>
            <p>Emily, terrified for the conſequence of
the indignation, that flaſhed in his eyes,
tremblingly aſſured him, that Montoni was
at home, and entreated he would endeavour
to moderate his reſentment. At the tremu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
accents of her voice, his eyes ſoftened
inſtantly from wildneſs into tenderneſs.
"You are ill, Emily," ſaid he, "they will
deſtroy us both! Forgive me, that I dared
to doubt your affection."</p>
            <p>Emily no longer oppoſed him, as he led
her into an adjoining parlour; the manner,
in which he had named Montoni, had ſo
much alarmed, her for his own ſafety, that
ſhe was now only anxious to "prevent the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences
of his juſt reſentment. He liſtened
to her entreaties, with attention, but replied
to them only with looks of despondency and
tenderneſs, concealing, as much as poſſible,
the ſentiments he felt toward Morrtoni, that
he might ſooth the apprehenſions, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed
her. But ſhe ſaw the veil he had
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0247300301:403"/>
ſpread over his reſentment, and, his aſſumed
tranquillity only alarming her more, ſhe
urged, at length, the impolicy of forcing
an interview with Montoni, and of taking
any meaſure, which might render their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
irremediable. Valancourt yielded
to theſe remonſtrances, and her affecting
entreaties drew from him a promiſe, that,
however Montoni might perſiſt in his deſign
of diſuniting them, he would not ſeek to
redreſs his wrongs by violence. "For my
ſake," ſaid Emily, "let the conſideration
of what I ſhould ſuffer deter you from ſuch
a mode of revenge!" "For your ſake,
Emily," replied Valancourt, his eyes filling
with tears of tenderneſs and grief, while he
gazed upon her. "Yes—yes—I ſhall ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due
myſelf. But, though I have given you
my ſolemn promiſe to do this, do not expect,
that I can tamely ſubmit to the authority or
Montoni; if I could, I ſhould be unworthy
of you. Yet, O Emily! how long may
he condemn me to live without you,—
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:0247300301:404"/>
how long may it be before you return to
France!"</p>
            <p>Emily endeavoured to ſooth him with
aſſurances of her unalterable affection, and by
repreſenting, that, in little more than a year,
ſhe ſhould be her own miſtreſs, as far as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
to her aunt, from whoſe guardianſhip
her age would then releaſe her; aſſurances,
which gave little conſolation to Valancourt,
who conſidered, that ſhe would then be in
Italy and in the power of thoſe, whoſe
dominion over her would not ceaſe with
their rights; but he affected to be conſoled
by them. Emily, comforted by the promiſe
ſhe had obtained, and by his apparent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure,
was about to leave him, when her
aunt entered the room. She threw a glance
of ſharp reproof upon her niece; who im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
withdrew, and of haughty diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
upon Valancourt.</p>
            <p>"This is not the conduct I ſhould have
expected from you, ſir;" ſaid ſhe, "I did
not expect to ſee you in my houſe, after
you had been informed, that your viſits
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0247300301:405"/>
were no longer agreeable, much leſs, that
you would ſeek a clandeſtine interview with
my niece, and that ſhe would grant one."</p>
            <p>Valancourt, perceiving it neceſſary to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate
Emily from ſuch a deſign, explained,
that the purpoſe of his own viſit had been
to requeſt an interview with Montoni, and
he then entered upon the ſubject of it, with
the tempered ſpirit which the ſex, rather
than the reſpectability, of Madame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni,
demanded.</p>
            <p>His expoſtulations were anſwered with
ſevere rebuke ſhe lamented again, that her
prudence had ever yielded to what ſhe termed
compaſſion, and added, that ſhe was ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of the folly of her former conſent, that,
to prevent the poſſibility of a repetition, ſhe
had committed the affair entirely to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Signor Montoni.</p>
            <p>The feeling eloquence of Valancourt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
at length, made her ſenſible in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
of her unworthy conduct, and ſhe became
ſuſceptible to ſhame, but not to remorſe: ſhe
hated Valancourt, who awakened her to this
painful ſenſation, and, in proportion as ſhe
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0247300301:406"/>
grew diſſatisfied with herſelf, her abhorrence
of him increaſed. This was alſo the more
inveterate, becauſe his tempered words and
manner were ſuch as, without accuſing her,
compelled her to accuſe herſelf, and neither
left her a hope, that the odious portrait was
the caricature of his prejudice, or afforded
her an excuſe for expreſſing the violent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment,
with which ſhe contemplated it.
At length, her anger roſe to ſuch an height,
that Valancourt was compelled to leave the
houſe abruptly, leſt he ſhould forfeit his
own eſteem by an intemperate reply. He
was then convinced, that from Madame
Montoni he had nothing to hope, for what of
either pity, or juſtice could be expected from
a perſon, who could feel the pain of guilt,
without the humility of repentance?</p>
            <p>To Montoni he looked with equal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondency,
ſince it was nearly evident, that
this plan of ſeparation originated with him,
and it was not probable, that he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh
his own views to entreaties, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances,
which he muſt have foreſeen
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0247300301:407"/>
and have been prepared to reſiſt. Yet,
remembering his promiſe to Emily, and
more ſolicitous, concerning his love, than
jealous of his conſequence, Valancourt was
careful to do nothing that might unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
irritate Montoni; he wrote to him,
therefore, not to demand an interview, but
to ſolicit one, and, having done this, he
endeavoured to await with calmneſs his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply.</p>
            <p>Madame Clairval was paſſive in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair.
When ſhe gave her approbation to
Valancourt's marriage, it was in the belief,
that Emily would be the heireſs of Madame
Montoni's fortune, and, though, upon the
nuptials of the latter, when ſhe perceived the
fallacy of this expectation, her conſcience
had withheld her from adopting any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
to prevent the union, her benevolence
was not ſufficiently active to impel her to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
any ſtep, that might now promote it.
She was, on the contrary, ſecretly pleaſed,
that Valancourt was releaſed from an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement,
which ſhe conſidered to be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0247300301:408"/>
in point of fortune, to his merit, as
his alliance was thought by Montoni to be
humiliating to the beauty of Emily; and,
though her pride was wounded by this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
of a member of her family, ſhe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained
to ſhew reſentment otherwiſe, than
by ſilence.</p>
            <p>Montoni, in his reply to Valancourt,
ſaid, that as an interview could neither re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move
the objections of the one, or overcome
the wiſhes of the other, it would ſerve only
to produce uſeleſs altercation between them.
He, therefore, thought proper to refuſe it.</p>
            <p>In conſideration of the policy, ſuggeſted
by Emily, and of his promiſe to her, Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
reſtrained the impulſe, that urged
him to the houſe of Montoni, to demand
what had been denied to his entreaties.
He only repeated his ſolicitations to ſee
him; ſeconding them with all the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
his ſituation could ſuggeſt. Thus
ſeveral days paſſed, in remonſtrance, on one
ſide, and inflexible denial, on the other;
for, whether it was fear, or ſhame, or the
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0247300301:409"/>
hatred, which reſults from both, that made
Montoni ſhun the man he had injured, he
was peremptory in his refuſal, and was
neither ſoftened to pity by the agony, which
Valancourt's letters pourtrayed, or awakened
to a repentance of his own injuſtice by the
ſtrong remonſtrances he employed. At length,
Valancourt's letters were returned unopened,
and then, in the firſt moments of paſſionate
deſpair, he forgot every promiſe to Emily,
except the ſolemn one, which bound him to
avoid violence, and haſtened to Montoni's
chateau, determined to ſee him by whatever
other means might be neceſſary. Montoni
was denied, and Valancourt, when he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
enquired for Madame, and Ma'am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelle
St. Aubert, was abſolutely refuſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittance
by the ſervants. Not chooſing to
ſubmit himſelf to a conteſt with theſe, he,
at length, departed, and, returning home in
a ſtate of mind approaching to frenzy,
wrote to Emily of what had paſſed, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
without restraint all the agony of his
heart, and entreated, that, ſince he muſt not
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0247300301:410"/>
otherwiſe hope to ſee her immediately, ſhe
would allow him an interview unknown to
Montoni. Soon after he had diſpatched this,
his paſſions becoming more temperate, he
was ſenſible of the error he had committed
in having given Emily new ſubject of diſtreſs
in the ſtrong mention of his own ſuffering,
and would have given half the world, had
it been his, to recover the letter. Emily,
however, was ſpared the pain ſhe muſt have
received from it by the ſuſpicious policy of
Madame Montoni, who had ordered, that
all letters, addreſſed to her niece, ſhould be
delivered to herſelf, and who, after having
peruſed this and indulged the expreſſions of
reſentment, which Valancourt's mention of
Montoni provoked, had conſigned it to the
flames.</p>
            <p>Montoni, meanwhile, every day more
impatient to leave France, gave repeated
orders for diſpatch to the ſervants employed
in preparations for the journey, and to the
perſons, with whom he was tranſacting ſome
particular buſineſs. He preſerved a ſteady
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0247300301:411"/>
ſilence to the letters in which Valancourt,
deſpairing of greater good, and having ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued
the paſſion, that had tranſgreſſed
againſt his policy, ſolicited only the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of being allowed to bid Emily fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.
But, when the latter learned, that ſhe
was really to ſet out in a very few days,
and that it was deſigned he ſhould ſee her
no more, forgetting every conſideration of
prudence, he dared, in a ſecond letter to
Emily, to propoſe a clandeſtine marriage.
This alſo was tranſmitted to Madame Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni,
and the laſt day of Emily's ſtay at
Tholouſe arrived, without affording Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
even a line to ſooth his ſufferings, or
a hope, that he ſhould be allowed a parting
interview.</p>
            <p>During this period of torturing ſuſpenſe
to Valancourt, Emily was ſunk into that
kind of ſtupor, with which ſudden and
irremediable misfortune ſometimes over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelms
the mind. Loving him with the
tendereſt affection, and having long been
accuſtomed to conſider him as the friend
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0247300301:412"/>
and companion of all her future days, ſhe
had no ideas of happineſs, that were not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected
with him. What, then, muſt have
been her ſuffering, when thus ſuddenly they
were to be ſeparated, perhaps, for ever, cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
to be thrown into diſtant parts of the
world, where they could ſcarcely hear of
each other's exiſtence; and all this in obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
to the will of a ſtranger, for ſuch
was Montoni, and of a perſon, who had
but lately been anxious to haſten their nup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials!
It was in vain, that ſhe endeavoured
to ſubdue her grief, and reſign herſelf to
an event, which ſhe could not avoid. The
ſilence of Valancourt afflicted more than
it ſurpriſed her, ſince ſhe attributed it to its
juſt occaſion; but, when the day, preceding
that, on which ſhe was to quit Tholouſe,
arrived, and ſhe heard no mention of his
being permitted to take leave of her, grief
overcame every conſideration, that had made
her reluctant to ſpeak of him, and ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
of Madame Montoni, whether this
conſolation had been refuſed. Her aunt
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0247300301:413"/>
informed her that it had, adding, that, after
the provocation ſhe had herſelf received from
Valancourt, in their laſt interview, and the
perſecution, which the Signor had ſuffered
from his letters, no entreaties ſhould avail
to procure it.</p>
            <p>"If the Chevalier expected this favour
from us," ſaid ſhe, "he ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
himſelf in a very different manner;
he ſhould have waited patiently, till he knew
whether we were diſpoſed to grant it, and
not have come and reproved me, becauſe
I did not think proper to beſtow my niece
upon him,—and then have perſiſted in
troubling the Signor, becauſe he did not
think proper to enter into any diſpute
about ſo childiſh an affair. His behaviour
throughout has been extremely preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and impertinent, and I deſire, that I
may never hear his name repeated, and
that you will get the better of thoſe fooliſh
ſorrows and whims, and look like other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
and not appear with that diſmal coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance,
as if you were ready to cry. For,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0247300301:414"/>
though you ſay nothing, you cannot conceal
your grief from my penetration. I can ſee
you are ready to cry at this moment, though
I am reproving you for it; aye, even now,
in ſpite of my commands."</p>
            <p>Emily, having turned away to hide her
tears, quitted the room to indulge them,
and the day was paſſed in an intenſity of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh,
ſuch as ſhe had, perhaps, never
known before. When ſhe withdrew to
her chamber for the night, ſhe remained in
the chair where ſhe had placed herſelf, on
entering the room, abſorbed in her grief,
till long after every member of the family,
except herſelf, was retired to reſt. She
could not diveſt herſelf of a belief, that ſhe
had parted with Valancourt to meet no
more; a belief, which did not ariſe merely
from foreſeen circumſtances, for, though
the length of the journey ſhe was about to
commence, the uncertainty as to the period
of her return, together with the prohibitions
ſhe had received, ſeemed to juſtify it, ſhe
yielded alſo to an impreſſion, which ſhe miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0247300301:415"/>
for a pre-ſentiment, that ſhe was going
from Valancourt for ever. How dreadful
to her imagination, too, was the diſtance
that would ſeparate them—the Alps, thoſe
tremendous barriers! would riſe, and whole
countries extend between the regions where
each muſt exiſt! To live in adjoining pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces,
to live even in the ſame country,
though without ſeeing him, was compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
happineſs to the conviction of this
dreadful length of diſtance.</p>
            <p>Her mind was, at length, ſo much agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by the conſideration of her ſtate, and
the belief, that ſhe had ſeen Valancourt for
the laſt time, that ſhe ſuddenly became very
faint, and, looking round the chamber for
ſomething, that might revive her, ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the caſements, and had juſt ſtrength
to throw one open, near which ſhe ſeated
herſelf. The air recalled her ſpirits, and
the ſtill moon-light, that fell upon the elms
of a long avenue, fronting the window,
ſomewhat ſoothed them, and determined
her to try whether exerciſe and the open air
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0247300301:416"/>
would not relieve the intenſe pain that
bound her temples. In the chateau all was
ſtill; and, paſſing down the great ſtair-caſe
into the hall, from whence a paſſage led im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to the garden, ſhe ſoſtly and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard,
as ſhe thought, unlocked the door,
and entered the avenue. Emily paſſed on
with ſteps now hurried, and now faltering,
as, deceived by the ſhadows among the trees,
ſhe fancied ſhe ſaw ſome perſon move in
the diſtant perſpective, and feared, that it
was a ſpy of Madame Montoni. Her deſire,
however, to re-viſit the pavilion, where ſhe
had paſſed ſo many happy hours with Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court,
and had admired with him the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
proſpect over Languedoc and her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Gaſcony, overcame her apprehenſion
of being obſerved, and ſhe moved on to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
the terrace, which, running along
the upper garden, commanded the whole of
the lower one, and communicated with it
by a flight of marble ſteps, that terminated
the avenue.</p>
            <p>Having reached theſe ſteps, ſhe pauſed a
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0247300301:417"/>
moment to look round, for her diſtance
from the chateau now increaſed the fear,
which the ſtillneſs and obſcurity of the
hour had awakened. But, perceiving no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
that could juſtify it, ſhe aſcended to
the terrace, where the moon-light ſhewed
the long broad walk, with the pavilion at
its extremity, while the rays ſilvered the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liage
of the high trees and ſhrubs, that bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
it on the right, and the tufted ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits
of thoſe, that roſe to a level with the
baluſtrade on the left, from the garden
below. Her diſtance from the chateau
again alarming her, ſhe pauſed to liſten; the
night was ſo calm, that no ſound could
have eſcaped her, but ſhe heard only the
plaintive ſweetneſs of the nightingale, with
the light ſhiver of the leaves, and ſhe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
her way towards the pavilion, having
reached which, its obſcurity did not prevent
the emotion, that a fuller view of its well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
ſcene would have excited. The
lattices were thrown back, and ſhewed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
their embowered arch the moon-light
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0247300301:418"/>
landſcape, ſhadowy and ſoft; its groves,
and plains extending gradually and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly
to the eye, its diſtant mountains
catching a ſtronger gleam, and the nearer
river reflecting the moon, and trembling to
her rays.</p>
            <p>Emily, as ſhe approached the lattice,
was ſenſible of the features of this ſcene
only as they ſerved to bring Valancourt
more immediately to her fancy. "Ah!"
ſaid ſhe, with a heavy ſigh, as ſhe threw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
into a chair by the window, "how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
have we ſat together in this ſpot—often
have looked upon that landſcape! Never,
never more ſhall we view it together—never—never
more, perhaps, ſhall we look upon
each other!"</p>
            <p>Her tears were ſuddenly ſtopped by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror—a
voice ſpoke near her in the pavilion;
ſhe ſhrieked—it ſpoke again, and ſhe diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
the well known tones of Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court.
It was indeed Valancourt who ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
her in his arms! For ſome moments
their emotion would not ſuffer either to
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:0247300301:419"/>
ſpeak. "Emily!" ſaid Valancourt at
length, as he preſſed her hand in his,
"Emily!" and he was again ſilent, but the
accent, in which he had pronounced her
name, expreſſed all his tenderneſs and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</p>
            <p>"O my Emily!" he reſumed, after a
long pauſe, "I do then ſee you once again,
and hear again the ſound of that voice! I
have haunted this place—theſe gardens, for
many—many nights, with a faint, very
faint hope of ſeeing you. This was the
only chance that remained for me, and,
thank heaven! it has at length ſucceeded—I
am not condemned to abſolute deſpair!"</p>
            <p>Emily ſaid ſomething, ſhe ſcarcely knew
what, expreſſive of her unalterable affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and endeavoured to-calm the agitation
of his mind; but Valancourt could for
ſome time only utter incoherent expreſſions
of his emotions; and, when he was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what
more compoſed, he ſaid, "I came hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
ſoon after ſun-ſet, and have been
watching in the gardens, and in this pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:0247300301:420"/>
ever ſince; for, though I had now gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
up all hope of ſeeing you, I could not
reſolve to tear myſelf from a place ſo near to
you, and ſhould probably have lingered
about the chateau till morning dawned.
O how heavily the moments have paſſed,
yet with what various emotion have they
been marked, as I ſometimes thought I
heard footſteps, and fancied you were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching,
and then again—perceived only
a dead and dreary ſilence! But, when you
opened the door of the pavilion, and the
darkneſs prevented my diſtinguiſhing with
certainty, whether it was ray love—my
heart beat ſo ſtrongly with hopes and fears,
that I could not ſpeak. The inſtant I
heard the plaintive accents of your voice,
my doubts vaniſhed, but not my fears, till
you ſpoke of me; then, loſing the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of alarming you in the exceſ of
my emotion, I could no longer be ſilent.
O Emily! theſe are moments, in which
joy and grief ſtruggle ſo powerfully for
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0247300301:421"/>
pre-eminence, that the heart can ſcarcely
ſupport the conteſt!"</p>
            <p>Emily's heart acknowledged the truth of
this aſſertion, but the joy ſhe felt on thus
meeting Valancourt, at the very moment
when ſhe was lamenting, that they muſt
probably meet no more, ſoon melted into
grief, as reflection ſtole over her thoughts,
and imagination prompted viſions of the
future. She ſtruggled to recover the calm
dignity of mind, which was neceſſary to
ſupport her through this laſt interview, and
which Valancourt found it utterly impoſſible
to attain, for the tranſports of his joy
changed abruptly into thoſe of ſuffering,
and he expreſſed in the moſt impaſſioned
language his horror of this ſeparation, and
his deſpair of their ever meeting again.
Emily wept ſilently as ſhe liſtened to him,
and then, trying to command her own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,
and to ſooth his, ſhe ſuggeſted every
circumſtance that could lead to hope. But
the energy of his fears led him inſtantly to
detect the friendly fallacies, which ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:0247300301:422"/>
to impoſe on herſelf and him, and
alſo to conjure up illuſions too powerful
for his reaſon.</p>
            <p>"You are going from me," ſaid he, "to
a diſtant country, O how diſtant!—to new
ſociety, new friends, new admirers, with
people too, who will try to make you forget
me, and to promote new connections! How
can I know this, and not know, that you
will never return for me—never can be
mine." His voice was ſtifled by ſighs.</p>
            <p>"You believe, then," ſaid Emily, "that
the pangs I ſuffer proceed from a trivial
and temporary intereſt; you believe—"</p>
            <p>"Suffer!" interrupted Valancourt, "ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
for me! O Emily—how ſweet—how
bitter are thoſe words; what comfort, what
anguiſh do they give! I ought not to doubt
the ſteadineſs of your affection, yet ſuch is
the inconſiſtency of real love, that it is always
awake to ſuſpicion, however unreaſonable;
always requiring new aſſurances from the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of its intereſt, and thus it is, that I always
feel revived, as by a new conviction, when
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0247300301:423"/>
your words tell me I am dear to you; and,
wanting theſe, I relapſe into doubt, and too
often into deſpondency. "Then ſeeming to
recollect him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he exclaimed, "But what
a wretch am I, thus to torture you, and in
theſe moments, too! I, who ought to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
and comfort you!"</p>
            <p>This reflection overcame Valancourt with
tenderneſs, but, relapſing into deſpondency,
he again felt only for himſelf, and lamented
again this cruel ſeparation, in a voice and
words ſo impaſſioned, that Emily, could no
longer ſtruggle to repreſs her own grief, or
to ſooth his. Valancourt, between theſe
emotions of love and pity, loſt the power,
and almoſt the wiſh, of repreſſing his agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation;
and, in the intervals of convulſive
ſobs, he, at one moment, kiſſed away her
tears, then told her cruelly, that poſſibly ſhe
might never again weep for him, and then
tried to ſpeak more calmly, but only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed,
"O Emily—my heart will break!—I
cannot—cannot leave you! Now—I
gaze upon that countenance, now I hold
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:0247300301:424"/>
you in my arms! a little while, and all this
will appear a dream. I ſhall look, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
ſee you; ſhall try to recollect your fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures—and
the impreſſion will be fled from
my imagination;—to hear the tones of your
voice, and even memory will be ſilent!—I
cannot, cannot leave you! Why ſhould
we confide the happineſs of our whole lives
to the will of people, who have no right
to interrupt, and, except in giving you to
me, have no power to promote it? O
Emily! venture to truſt your own heart,
venture to be mine forever!" His voice
trembled, and he was ſilent; Emily conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
to weep, and was ſilent alſo, when
Valancourt proceeded to propoſe an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
marriage, and that, at an early hour
on the following morning, ſhe ſhould quit
Madame Montoni's houſe, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted
by him to the church of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtines,
where a friar ſhould await to
unite them.</p>
            <p>The ſilence, with which ſhe liſtened to a
propoſal, dictated by love and deſpair, and
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:0247300301:425"/>
enforced at a moment, when it ſeemed
ſcarcely poſſible for her to oppoſe it;—when
her heart was ſoftened by the ſorrows
of a ſeparation, that might be eternal, and
her reaſon obſcured by the illuſions of love
and terror, encouraged him to hope, that
it would not be rejected. "Speak, my
Emily!" ſaid Valancourt eagerly, "let me
hear your voice, let me hear you confirm
my fate." She ſpoke not; her cheek was
cold, and her ſenſes ſeemed to fail her, but
ſhe did not faint. To Valancourt's terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied
imagination ſhe appeared to be dying;
he called upon her name, roſe to go to the
chateau for aſſiſtance, and then, recollect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her ſituation, feared to go, or to leave
her for a moment.</p>
            <p>After a few minutes, ſhe drew a deep
ſigh, and began to revive. The conflict
ſhe had ſuffered, between love and the duty
ſhe at preſent owed to her father's ſiſter;
her repugnance to a clandeſtine marriage, her
fear of emerging on the world with embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſments,
ſuch as might ultimately involve
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:0247300301:426"/>
the object of her affection in miſery and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;—all
this various intereſt was too
powerful for a mind, already enervated by
ſorrow, and her reaſon had ſuffered a tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient
ſuſpenſion. But duty, and good ſenſe,
however hard the conflict, at length, tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphed
over affection and mournful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentiment;
above all, ſhe dreaded to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve
Valancourt in obſcurity and vain
regret, which ſhe ſaw, or thought ſhe ſaw,
muſt be the too certain conſequence of a
marriage in their preſent circumſtances; and
ſhe acted, perhaps, with ſomewhat more than
female fortitude, when ſhe reſolved to endure
a preſent, rather than provoke a diſtant
misfortune.</p>
            <p>With a candour, that proved how truly
ſhe eſteemed and loved him, and which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared
her to him, if poſſible, more than
ever, ſhe told Valancourt all her reaſons for
rejecting his propoſals. Thoſe, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced
her concerning his future welfare,
he inſtantly reſuted, or rather contradicted;
but they awakened tender conſiderations
for her, which the frenzy of paſſion and
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:0247300301:427"/>
deſpair had concealed before, and love,
which had but lately prompted him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
a clandeſtine and immediate marriage,
now induced him to renounce it. The
triumph was almoſt too much for his heart;
for Emily's ſake, he endeavoured to ſtifle
his grief, but the ſwelling anguiſh would
not be reſtrained. "O Emily!" ſaid he,
"I muſt leave you—I <hi>muſt,</hi> leave you, and
I know it is for ever."</p>
            <p>Convulſive ſobs again interrupted his
words, and they wept together in ſilence,
till Emily, recollecting the danger of being
diſcovered, and the impropriety of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing
an interview, which might ſubject
her to cenſure, ſummoned all her fortitude
to utter a laſt farewell.</p>
            <p>"Stay!" ſaid Valancourt, "I conjure you
ſtay, for I have much to tell you. The
agitation of my mind has hitherto ſuffered
me to ſpeak only on the ſubject that occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied
it;—I have forborne to mention a doubt
of much importance, partly, leſt it ſhould
appear as if I told it with an ungenerous
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:0247300301:428"/>
view of alarming you into a compliance
with my late propoſal."</p>
            <p>Emily, much agitated, did not leave Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
but ſhe led him from the pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
and, as they walked upon the terrace,
he proceeded as follows:</p>
            <p>"This Montoni: I have heard ſome
ſtrange hints concerning him. Are you
certain he is of Madame Queſnel's family,
and that his fortune is what it appears to
be?"</p>
            <p>"I have no reaſon to doubt either," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Emily, in a voice of alarm. "Of the
firſt, indeed, I cannot doubt, but I have no
certain means of judging of the latter, and
I entreat you will tell me all you have
heard."</p>
            <p>"That I certainly will, but it is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect,
and unſatisfacotory information. I
gathered it by accident from an Italian,
who was ſpeaking to another perſon of this
Montoni. They were talking of his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage;
the Italian ſaid, that if he was the
perſon he meant, he was not likely to make
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:0247300301:429"/>
Madame Cheron happy. He proceeded to
ſpeak of him in general terms of diſlike,
and then gave ſome particular hints, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
his character, that excited my curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity,
and I ventured to aſk him a few queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
He was reſerved in his replies,
but, after heſitating for ſome time, he
owned, that he had underſtood abroad, that
Montoni was a man of deſperate fortune
and character. He ſaid ſomething of a
caſtle of Montoni's, ſituated among the
Apennines, and of ſome ſtrange circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
that might be mentioned, as to his
former mode of life. I preſſed him to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
me further, but I believe the ſtrong
intereſt I felt was viſible in my manner,
and alarmed him; for no entreaties could
prevail with him to give any explanation of
the circumſtances he had alluded to, or to
mention any thing further concerning Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toni.
I obſerved to him, that, if Montoni
was poſſeſſed of a caſtle in the Apennines,
it appeared from ſuch a circumſtance, that
he was of ſome family, and alſo ſeemed to
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:0247300301:430"/>
contradict the report, that he was a man of
entirely broken fortunes. He ſhook his
head, and looked as if he could have ſaid a
great deal, but made no reply.</p>
            <p>"A hope of learning ſomething more ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory,
or more poſitive, detained me in
his company a conſiderable time, and I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed
the ſubject repeatedly, but the Italian
wrapped himſelf up in reſerve, ſaid—that
what he had mentioned he had caught only
from a floating report, and that reports fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
aroſe from perſonal malice, and
were very little to be depended upon. I
forbore to preſs the ſubject farther, ſince it
was obvious that he was alarmed for the
conſequence of what he had already ſaid,
and I was compelled to remain in uncertainty
on a point where ſuſpenſe is almoſt intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.
Think, Emily, what I muſt ſuffer
to ſee you depart for a foreign country,
committed to the power of a man of ſuch
doubtful character as is this Montoni! But
I will not alarm you unneceſſarily;—it is
poſſible, as the Italian ſaid, at firſt, that
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0247300301:431"/>
this is not the Montoni he alluded to. Yet,
Emily, conſider well before you reſolve to
commit yourſelf to him. O! I muſt not
truſt myſelf to ſpeak—or I ſhall renounce
all the motives, which ſo lately influenced
me to reſign the hope of your becoming
mine immediately."</p>
            <p>Valancourt walked upon the terrace with
hurried ſteps, while Emily remained lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
on the baluſtrade in deep thought.
The information ſhe had juſt received ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited,
perhaps, more alarm than it could
juſtify, and raiſed once more the conflict of
contraſted intereſts. She had never liked
Montoni. The fire and keenneſs of his
eye, its proud exultation, its bold fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
its ſullen watchfulneſs, as occaſion,
and even ſlight occaſion, had called forth the
latent ſoul, ſhe had often obſerved with emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
while from the uſual expreſſion of his
countenance ſhe had always ſhrunk. From
ſuch obſervations ſhe was the more inclined
to believe, that it was this Montoni, of
whom the Italian had uttered his ſuſpicious
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0247300301:432"/>
hints. The thought of being ſolely in his
power, in a foreign land, was terrifying to
her, but it was not by terror alone that ſhe
was urged to an immediate marriage with
Valancourt. The tendereſt love had already
pleaded his cauſe, but had been unable to
overcome her opinion, as to her duty, her
diſintereſted conſiderations for Valancourt,
and the delicacy, which made her revolt from
a clandeſtine union. It was not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
that a vague terror would be more
powerful, than the united influence of love
and grief. But it recalled all their energy,
and rendered a ſecond conqueſt neceſſary.</p>
            <p>With Valancourt, whoſe imagination was
now awake to the ſuggeſtion of every paſſion;
whoſe apprehenſions for Emily had acquired
ſtrength by the mere mention of them, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
every inſtant more powerful, as his mind
brooded over them—with Valancourt no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
conqueſt was attainable. He thought
he ſaw in the cleareſt light, and love aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
the fear, that this journey to Italy
would involve Emily in miſery; he deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded,
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0247300301:433"/>
therefore, to perſevere in oppoſing
it, and in conjuring her to beſtow upon
him the title of her lawful protector.</p>
            <p>"Emily!" ſaid he, with ſolemn earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
"this is no time for ſerupulous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions,
for weighing the dubious and
comparatively trifling circumſtances, that
may affect our future comfort. I now ſee.,
much more clearly than before, the train of
ſerious dangers you are going to encounter
with a man of Montoni's character. Thoſe
dark hints of the Italian ſpoke much, but
not more than the idea I have of Montoni's
diſpoſition, as exhibited even in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.
I think I ſee at this moment all that
could have been hinted, written there. He is
the Italian, whom I fear, and I conjure you
for your own ſake, as well as for mine, to
prevent the evils I ſhudder to foreſee. O
Emily! let my tenderneſs, my arms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
you from them—give me the right to
defend you!"</p>
            <p>Emily only ſighed, while Valancourt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
to remonſtrate and to entreat with
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:0247300301:434"/>
all the energy that love and apprehenſion
could inſpire. But, as his imagination
magnified to her the poſſible evils ſhe was
going to meet, the miſts of her own fancy
began to diſſipate, and allowed her to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh
the exaggerated images, which im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
on his reaſon. She conſidered, that
there was no proof of Montoni being the
perſon, whom the ſtranger had meant;
that, even if he was ſo, the Italian had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed
his character and broken fortunes
merely from report; and that, though the
countenance of Montoni ſeemed to give pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability
to a part of the rumour, it was.
not by ſuch circumſtances that an implicit
belief of it could be juſtified. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations
would probably not have ariſen
ſo diſtinctly to her mind, at this time, had
not the terrors of Valancourt preſented to
her ſuch obvious exaggerations of her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,
as incited her to diſtruſt the fallacies of
paſſion. But, while ſhe endeavoured in
the gentleſt manner to convince him of his
error, ſhe plunged him into a new one.
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:0247300301:435"/>
His voice and countenance changed to an
expreſſion of dark deſpair. "Emily!"
ſaid he, "this, this moment is the bittereſt
that is yet come to me. You do not—cannot
love me!—It would be impoſſible for you to
reaſon thus coolly, thus deliberately, if you
did. I, <hi>I</hi> am torn with anguiſh at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of our ſeparation, and of the evils that
may await you in conſequence of it; I would
encounter any hazards to prevent it—to
ſave you. No! Emily, no!—you cannot
love me."</p>
            <p>"We have now little time to waſte in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation,
or aſſertion," ſaid Emily, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring
to conceal her emotion: "if you
are yet to learn how dear you are, and ever
muſt be, to my heart, no aſſurances of mine
can give you conviction."</p>
            <p>The laſt words faltered on her lips, and
her tears flowed faſt. Thoſe words and
tears brought, once more, and with inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous
force, conviction of her love to Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt.
He could only exclaim, "Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly!
Emily!" and weep over the hand he
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:0247300301:436"/>
preſſed to his lips; but ſhe, after ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
again rouſed herſelf from the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of ſorrow, and ſaid, "I muſt leave
you; it is late, and my abſence from the
chateau may be diſcovered. Think of me—love
me—when I am far away; the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief
of this will be my comfort!"</p>
            <p>"Think of you!—love you!" exclaimed
Valancourt.</p>
            <p>"Try to moderate theſe tranſports," ſaid
Emily, "for my ſake, try."</p>
            <p>"For your ſake!"</p>
            <p>"Yes, for my ſake," replied Emily, in a
tremulous voice, "I cannot leave you
thus!"</p>
            <p>"Then do not leave me!" ſaid Valancourt,
with quickneſs. "Why ſhould we part,
or part for longer than till to-morrow?"</p>
            <p>"I am, indeed I am, unequal to theſe
moments," replied Emily, "you tear my
heart, but I never can conſent to this haſty,
imprudent propoſal!"</p>
            <p>"If we could command our time, my
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:0247300301:437"/>
Emily, it ſhould not be thus haſty; we
muſt ſubmit to circumſtances."</p>
            <p>"We muſt, indeed! I have already told
you all my heart—my ſpirits are gone.
You allowed the force of my objections, till
your tenderneſs called up vague terrors,
which have given us both unneceſſary an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh.
Spare me! do not oblige me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat
the reaſons I have already urged."</p>
            <p>"Spare you!" cried Valancourt, "I am
a wretch—a very wretch, that have felt
only for myſelf!—I! who ought to have
ſhewn the fortitude of man, who ought
to have ſupported you, l! have increaſed
your ſufferings by the conduct of a child!
Forgive me, Emily! think of the diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of my mind now that I am about to
part with, all that is dear to me—and forgive
me! When you are gone, I ſhall recollect!
with bitter remorſe what I have made you
ſuffer, and ſhall wiſh in vain that I could
ſee you, if only for a moment, that I might
ſooth your grief."</p>
            <p>Tears again interrupted his voice, and
Emily wept with him. "I will ſhew my
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:0247300301:438"/>
ſelf more worthy of your love," ſaid Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancourt,
at length; "I will not prolong
theſe moments. My Emily—my own
Emily! never forget me! God knows
when we ſhall meet again! I reſign you to
his care—. O God!—O God!—protect
and bleſs her!"</p>
            <p>He preſſed her hand to his heart. Emily
ſunk almoſt lifeleſs on his boſom; and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
wept, nor ſpoke. Valancourt, now
commanding his own diſtreſs, tried to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort
and re-aſſure her, but ſhe appeared to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally
unaffected by what he ſaid, and a ſigh,
which ſhe uttered, now and then, was all
that proved ſhe had not fainted.</p>
            <p>He ſupported her ſlowly towards the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teau,
weeping and ſpeaking to her; but ſhe
anſwered only in ſighs, till, having reached
the gate, that terminated the avenue, ſhe
ſeemed to have recovered her conſciouſneſs,
and, looking round, perceived how near
they were to the chateau. "We muſt part
here," ſaid ſhe, ſtopping, "Why prolong
theſe moments? Teach me the fortitude
I have forgot."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="427" facs="tcp:0247300301:439"/>
Valancourt ſtruggled to aſſume a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
air. "Farewell, my love!" ſaid he,
in a voice of ſolemn tenderneſs—"truſt me
we ſhall meet again—meet for each other—meet
to part no more!" His voice fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered,
but, recovering it, he proceeded in a
firmer tone. "You know not what I
ſhall ſuffer, till I hear from you; I ſhall
omit no opportunity of conveying to you
my letters, yet I tremble to think how few
may occur. And truſt me, love, for your
dear ſake, I will try to bear this abſence
with fortitude. O how little I have ſhewn
to-night!"</p>
            <p>"Farewell!" ſaid Emily faintly. "When
you are gone, I ſhall think of many things I
would have ſaid to you." "And I of many—many!"
ſaid Valancourt; "I never left
you yet, that I did not immediately remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
ſome queſtion, or ſome entreaty, or ſome
circumſtance, concerning my love, that I ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
wiſhed to mention, and feel wretched
becauſe I could not. O Emily! this counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance,
on which I now gaze—will, in a
moment, be gone from my eyes, and not
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0247300301:440"/>
all the efforts of fancy will be able to recall
it with exactneſs. O! what an infinite
difference between this moment and, the
next! <hi>Now,</hi> I am in your preſence, can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
you! <hi>then,</hi> all will be a dreary blank—and
I ſhall be a wanderer, exiled from my
only home!"</p>
            <p>Valancourt again preſſed her to his heart,
and held her there in ſilence, weeping.
Tears once again calmed her oppreſſed mind.
They again bade each other farewell, lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered
a moment, and then parted, Valan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court
ſeemed to force himſelf from the ſpot;
he paſſed haſtily up the avenue, and Emily,
as ſhe moved ſlowly towards the chateau,
heard his diſtant ſteps. She liſtened to the
ſounds, as they ſunk fainter and fainter,
till the melancholy ſtillneſs of night alone
remained; and then hurried to her cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
to ſeek repoſe, which, alas! was fled
from her wretchedneſs.</p>
