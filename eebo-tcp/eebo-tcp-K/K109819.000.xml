            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Am ſenſible that this Performance will come into the World much more imperfect than I at firſt thought it would. But I have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour'd under ſo many Difficulties in the compiling of it, that when but a few of them are mentioned, I hope for a candid and favourable Judgment.</p>
            <p>AFTER I had collected in private what Materials I could, I was then obliged to go publickly in Queſt of more. Upon this I publiſh'd an <hi>Advertiſement,</hi> deſiring the Aſſiſtance of ſuch as had ancient Writings, or Deeds, or any other Things that might contribute to the helping of the Work.</p>
            <p>THIS immediately, occaſioned the following Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that it might be of dangerous Conſequence to ſhew ancient Writings, that He was but a Curate that under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took the Work, that his Abilities therefore of Pocket and
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0583000100:8"/>
Mind muſt be vaſtly unequal to ſuch a Task; in ſhort, above 12 Months before the Publication of it, ſome have made it their Buſineſs, (ſo great has been their Ill-nature and Prejudice) as to take all Ways and Methods of decry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; by Print, by Manuſcript, leſſening it in all Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies to hinder it's Publication, and ſpeaking as freely of of it, as if they were acquainted with every Line of it's Compoſition, and by a Prophetick Spirit knew it to be as they talk'd of it.</p>
            <p>BY theſe Means I am certain I have been hindred of many Materials.</p>
            <p>BUT there are two grand Diſappointments I met with in the Compiling of this Performance, which muſt not be untaken Notice of. The One is my not being ſo happy as to ſee Dr. <hi>Elliſon</hi>'s Collection of the Antiquities of this Town. A few indeed were ſent me, but having the ſame Copy from Mr. <hi>Douglas,</hi> they were of no Service; and excepting theſe I ſaw no more. 'Tis to be hoped, as the Dr. muſt have made a large Collection, having been about it, as is ſaid, for many Years; that the preſent Poſſeſſor of them will oblige the Town with the Publication of Them, and cure the Imperfections of the preſent Performance.</p>
            <p>THE other Diſappointment is the not Meeting with thoſe large Collections of Sir <hi>Robert Shaftoe,</hi> taken No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of by Biſhop <hi>Nicholſon</hi> in his <hi>Engliſh Hiſtorical Library.</hi> I endeavoured after a Sight of them, but they were then either loſt, or ſo miſlaid, that there was no coming at them.</p>
            <p>AND if I add to all this, an Illneſs of many Months, and which it pleaſes God ſtill to continue, <note n="*" place="bottom">The Author did live but few Months after he wrote this Preface, dying <hi>Feb. 16. 1732.</hi>
               </note> which too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obliges me to truſt the Copies of others, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them, I hope a few Errours and Failings will fall gently to my Share.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0583000100:9"/>HOWEVER in the midſt of all this Malice and Ill-nature and theſe Diſappointments, there were ſome ſo communicative, and generouſly aſſiſting, as to give all the Help they could. They are the Gentlemen following.</p>

            <p>IT will neither be neceſſary nor proper for me at this Time to anſwer the trifling Objections above-mention'd.

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Some Account of the Roman Walls in the Country of the <hi>OTTADINI;</hi> particularly the Walls of <hi>HADRIAN</hi> and <hi>SEVERUS,</hi> which went through this TOWN. The moſt ancient Name of this TOWN.</head>
               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T was about an hundred Years after the Landing of <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> in <hi>this Iſland,</hi> when the <hi>Brigantes,</hi> a popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and warlike Nation of the <hi>Britains,</hi> whoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try extended from the North of <hi>Humber</hi> to the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> containing the preſent Counties of <hi>Yorkſhire, Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Lancaſhire, Weſtmoreland,</hi> and <hi>Cumberland,</hi> were firſt aſſaulted by the <hi>Romans.</hi> The <hi>Britains</hi> behaved themſelves in the War with great Courage and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, 'till at laſt, in the Reign of <hi>Veſpaſian,</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part of them were conquered. After this in the Reign of <hi>Titus, Julius A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gricola,</hi> the Lieutenant of <hi>Britain,</hi> who was at leaſt equally Famous for his Conqueſts over the Cuſtoms and Manners of the <hi>Britains,</hi> as for his many Victories over them in Battle, did in the third Year of his Lieutenancy make a Diſcovery of other Parts of this Iſland, which were not brought under the <hi>Roman</hi> Yoke. Upon which he marched Northward into the Country of the <hi>Ottadini,</hi> which extends from the North of <hi>Tyne</hi> to the River <hi>Taus,</hi> wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and deſtroying all before him, 'till he came to the <hi>Tay</hi> it ſelf. And now according to ſome was the firſt Wall made in <hi>Britain:</hi> But it was not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0583000100:13"/>
a Wall, it was only a Line of Garriſons placed upon that Slip of Land between <hi>Edinburgh-Frith</hi> and <hi>Dun-Britain-Frith,</hi> for the Security of what they had already gain'd; and if the Valour of <hi>Agricola</hi>'s Army, and the Renown of the <hi>Roman</hi> Name could have ſuffer'd it, there was no Need of a further Search after the Bounds and Limits of <hi>Britain.</hi> The <hi>Friths</hi> above-mentioned, called then <hi>Glota</hi> and <hi>Bodotria,</hi> might have been very ſufficient, being the Arms of two oppoſite Seas, and only ſeparated by a ſmall Space of Land, which was well fortified with the <hi>Roman</hi> Garriſons; ſo that the <hi>Romans</hi> were Lords of the whole South, and had caſt the Enemy as it were into another Iſland <note n="a" place="margin">Tacit. in vit. Agricol.</note>. But what could ever bound the Roman Glory, and limit their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſatisfied Ambition? It was not enough that they had intirely ſecured them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for any Attempts of the <hi>Caledonians,</hi> but <hi>They</hi> alſo were to be ſubdued. This was effected in the 8th Year of <hi>Agricola</hi>'s Lieutenancy in the reign of <hi>Domitian.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>HOWEVER after this, <note n="b" place="margin">Cambd.</note> that further Part of the Iſland was left to the <note n="c" place="margin">The inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants went naked, had no Houſes to live in, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did they Till the Ground.

                  <hi>Barbarians,</hi> as neither Pleaſant nor Fruitful; but this nether Part was fairly reduc'd to a <hi>Roman</hi> Province; which was not governed by Conſular, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſular Deputies; but was counted Praeſidial, and appropriate to the <hi>Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars,</hi> as being a Province annex'd to the Empire, after the Diviſion of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces made by <hi>Auguſtus,</hi> and having <hi>Propraetors</hi> of its own.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>HADRIAN,</hi> who was made Emperor about the Year of our Lord 117, made the ſecond Wall. <note n="d" place="margin">Cambd.</note> He drew a Wall, ſays <hi>Spartian,</hi> of eighty Miles in Length, to divide the Barbarians from the <hi>Romans;</hi> which one may gather, from what follows in <hi>Spartian,</hi> to have been in the Faſhion of a <hi>Mural Hedge</hi> of large Stakes, fix'd deep in the Ground, and faſtned together with Wattles. The ſame Authority from the Scotch Hiſtorian who wrote the <hi>Rota Temporum,</hi> tells us, that <hi>Hadrian</hi> did firſt of all draw a Wall of a prodigious Bigneſs, made of Turf (of that Height that it look'd like a Mountain, and with a deep Ditch before it) From the Mouth of the <hi>Tyne</hi> to the River <hi>Eske,</hi> i. e. from the <hi>German</hi> to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Ocean. This is ſuppoſed to have been done about the Year 123.</p>
               <p>THE <note n="e" place="margin">Cambd.</note> Third Wall was built by <hi>Lollius Urbicus,</hi> Lieutenant of Britain, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>Antoninus Pius,</hi> about the Year 144, who by his great Succeſs removed back the Bounds to where <hi>Julius Agricola</hi> had ſet them, and raiſed a Wall there.</p>
               <p>THE <note n="f" place="margin">Cambd.</note> Fourth Wall was that of <note n="g" place="margin">This Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror died at <hi>York</hi> about the Year <hi>211,</hi> Feb. 4th.</note> 
                  <hi>Severus,</hi> which was built about the Year of Chriſt 210, which extended from Sea to Sea, quite croſs the Iſland. This was a Wall of Stone, built much about the ſame Place where the Wall of <hi>Hadrian</hi> was. It had it's Beginning at <hi>Bulneſs</hi> on the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Sea, and croſſing the Iſland, went as far as <hi>Walls-End,</hi> a Village about 3 Miles Eaſt of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A <note n="h" place="margin">Cambd.</note> Fifth Wall was built between the two Arms or Boſoms of the Seas for many Miles together, that where the Waters did not defend them, the Wall might be a Security againſt the Incurſions of the Enemy. This Wall was made by <hi>Carauſius,</hi> Governour of <hi>Britain,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> and ſtood in the ſame Place where <hi>Lollius Urbicus</hi> had built his.</p>
               <p>THIS being finiſhed, the <hi>Romans</hi> left the <hi>Britains</hi> to their own Valour and Conduct, being called away for the Defence of <hi>Gaul;</hi> But no ſooner were they gone, than their Enemies returned, and ſlew all before them: Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this they ſent Ambaſſadors to <hi>Rome</hi> to ſollicite the Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> which was granted them. For <hi>Valentinian</hi> ſent three Companies under the Conduct of <hi>Gallio</hi> of <hi>Ravenua,</hi> who routed the Enemy and relieved the Province. After this <note n="i" place="margin">Cambd. p. 86. <hi>ex Gild'.</hi>
                  </note> they made a Wall of Stone (not raiſed at the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and private Coſts, as the other was) with the Help of the poor Natives, built after the uſual Manner, quite croſs the Country from one Sea to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by thoſe Cities which were perhaps built there for fear of the Enemy: They exhorted them to be couragious, and left them Patterns to make their Weapons by. Upon the Southren Shore of <hi>Britain</hi> alſo, where their Ships
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0583000100:14"/>
lay, (becauſe the barbarous Enemy might enter there) they built <hi>Turrets</hi> at ſome Diſtance from one another, that lookt a long Way to the Sea. And ſo the <hi>Romans</hi> intending never to return more, about the Four Hundred Seventy Sixth Year from the coming of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> took their laſt Farewell.</p>
               <p>THIS laſt Wall, according to <hi>Bede,</hi> was eight Foot broad and twelve Foot high, and ſtood in the Place where the Walls of <hi>Hadrian</hi> and <hi>Severus</hi> had ſtood. <note n="k" place="margin">Cambd.</note> It had great Number of Towers or little <hi>Caſtles,</hi> a Mile one from another, called now <hi>Caſtleſteeds;</hi> and on the Inſide a Sort of <hi>fortified little Towns</hi> call'd <hi>Cheſters.</hi> The Inhabitants tell you there was alſo a <hi>Brazen Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet</hi> or <hi>Pipe,</hi> (whereof they now and then find Pieces) ſo artificially laid in the Wall between each <hi>Caſtle</hi> and Tower, that upon the Apprehenſion of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger at any ſingle Place, by the ſounding of it, Notice might be given to the next, then to the Third, and ſo on.</p>
               <p>THESE are all the Walls of the <hi>Romans;</hi> and that three of them went through this Town is ſomething more than probable. For <hi>Severus</hi>'s Wall was in the Place of <hi>Hadrian</hi>'s, and the laſt Wall mentioned, in the Place of <hi>Severus</hi>'s, and that laſt Wall went through this Town. Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> is ſo ſure of this, that he declares, <hi>'Tis moſt certain that the Rampier, and afterward the Wall paſſed through this Town; and that at</hi> Pandon-Gate <hi>there ſtill remains, as 'tis Thought, one of the little</hi> Turrets <hi>of that very Wall.</hi> There is indeed to this very Day a Part of that <hi>Turret</hi> in being, above <hi>Pandon-Gate,</hi> which, as the ſame Authority juſtly obſerved, is different from the Reſt both in Faſhon and Maſonry, and undoubtedly carrys along with it a very great Age.</p>
               <p>NEAR this <hi>Turret</hi> is the <hi>Wall-Knoll,</hi> a very ancient Place, which our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorian <hi>Grey</hi> ſays poſitively, <hi>Was a Part of the Picts-Wall;</hi> and indeed the very Name of it ſpeaks as much. For the Word <hi>Wall</hi> upon the <hi>Knoll,</hi> which ſignifies an <hi>Hill</hi> or <hi>Eminence,</hi> cannot be underſtood of any other than the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-Wall;</hi> Becauſe it had this Name from very ancient Times, long before the Building of the <hi>Town-Wall,</hi> to which it almoſt adjoins.</p>
               <p>A little above this Place is a <hi>Tower,</hi> commonly call'd the <note n="l" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide</hi> Wall-knoll Tower.</note> 
                  <hi>Carpenters-Tower.</hi> This was one of the <hi>Roman-Towers,</hi> as was very Viſible, before the taking down of the Upper-part of it. <note n="m" place="margin">Lib. de rebus Novo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt'.</note> For it was of the ſame Size, Model, and Stone with the Tower of <note n="n" place="margin">This Village is now in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>John Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> who has tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the inner Part of the Tower into Modern Rooms, but left the Walls of it ſtill intire.</note> 
                  <hi>Rutcheſter</hi> in <hi>Northumberland,</hi> which was undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly one of the <hi>Roman Towers,</hi> by the <hi>Picts-Wall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT muſt alſo not be omitted, that there is an ancient Tradition among the Inhabitants of this Town, that the <hi>Roman-Wall</hi> went through the <hi>Weſt-Gate,</hi> and the <hi>Vicar's Garden,</hi> along that Ground where St. <hi>Nicholas-Church</hi> now ſtands, along <hi>Nether-Dean-Bridge,</hi> by the <hi>Wall-Knoll, Sally-Port,</hi> and ſo on to <hi>Walls-End.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>THUS I think it very clear that theſe <hi>Roman-Walls</hi> went through this Town. Let us now ſee what this Town was in theſe ancient Times. <note n="u" place="margin">p. 779</note> Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> gives his Opinion thus: <hi>Gateſide</hi> is commonly believed to be of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Antiquity than <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> it ſelf. And if I ſhould ſay further, that this and <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> (for they ſeem formerly to have been only one Town parted by the River) were that Frontier-Garriſon, which in the Times of the later Emperors was called <hi>Gabroſentum,</hi> and defended by the <hi>ſecond Cohort of</hi> the <hi>Thraces;</hi> and that it retained it's old Name in a due Senſe and Signification, notwithſtanding <hi>this Newcaſtle</hi> has changed it's Name once or twice, I hope it will be no ways inconſiſtent with Truth. For <hi>Gaffr</hi> is uſed by the <hi>Britains</hi> for a <hi>Goat,</hi> and <hi>Hen,</hi> in Compoſition for <hi>Pen,</hi> which ſignifies an <hi>Head:</hi> And in this very Senſe and Meaning it is plainly called <hi>Caprae Caput,</hi> or <hi>Goats-Head</hi> by our old Latin Hiſtorians.</p>
               <p>THUS far this learned Antiquary. But notwithſtanding this his Judgment, and that no tollerable Reaſon can be brought againſt the two Places having been but one; yet ſome will ſtill have it, that <hi>Gateſide,</hi> excluſive of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> is the ancient <hi>Gabroſentum,</hi> becauſe of it's Name. For my Part I cannot help being of Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi>'s Opinion, and for this, among other Reaſons; that if the Name of <hi>Caprae Caput</hi> diſcovers the <hi>Gabroſentum,</hi> then it is more probable that the principal Part of it lay on the North-ſide of the River than on the South: Becauſe <hi>Gabroſentum</hi> was one of theſe <hi>Frontier Garriſons,</hi> which lay <hi>ad Lineam Valli,</hi> within the very Range of the Wall. For all theſe Garriſons <hi>ad Lineam Valli,</hi> were placed on the ſame Side of the River with the Wall it ſelf, conſequently <hi>Gateſide</hi> could but at moſt have been a Part of <hi>Gabroſentum,</hi> and the meaneſt Part of it too; a Sort of Suburbs to it, as it actually was to this Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward the Sixth,</hi> as ſhall be ſhown hereafter.</p>
               <p>BUT if this is not allowed, (and yet it muſt be allowed, if <hi>Gateſide</hi> has it's Name from the <hi>Gabroſentum</hi>) yet moſt certainly it was a <note n="w" place="margin">
                     <hi>Vide Chap.</hi> of the upper Parts of the Town.</note> 
                  <hi>garriſon'd Fort</hi> in theſe very Times. For ſtill there is the Remains of a <hi>Roman Turret,</hi> and the under Part of one of the <hi>Roman</hi> Towers to be ſeen, and the Name of <hi>Pandon</hi> is no ſmall Corroboration of the Truth of it, as may be ſeen in our Account of that Place.</p>
               <p>THUS I think whatever is boaſted of the Antiquity of <hi>Gateſide,</hi> it plainly appears, that if <hi>Caprae Caput,</hi> or <hi>Gateſide</hi> Points out the ancient <hi>Gabroſentum, Newcaſtle</hi> muſt be her elder Siſter; foraſmuch as a Town muſt be earlier than it's Suburbs. And if it does not <note n="x" place="margin">
                     <p>
                        <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> is by Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> called the old <hi>Gabrocentum</hi> where the 2d Cohort of the <hi>Thracians</hi> lay; but according to the Courſe of the Forts in the <hi>Notitia Imperii, Gabrocentum</hi> is the ſeventeenth Station on the Wall; if therefore we follow the <hi>Noticia</hi> ſtrictly, <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> would rather ſeem to be the <hi>Pons-Aelii,</hi> the 2d Station on the Wall, where the <hi>Cohort</hi> of the <hi>Cornovii</hi> lay. In this I have the concurring Opinion of the learned and judicious Antiquary Dr. <hi>Hunter</hi> of <hi>Durham. Gord. Itin. Septent. pag.</hi> 71. The ancient <hi>Orrhea,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> has been thought by ſome to have been the Original of this Town, but for what Reaſon I know not.</p>
                  </note> Point it out, it will then be a certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, that there is an indiſputable Account of <hi>this Town</hi> in theſe very Times of the <hi>Romans,</hi> which was ſome Hundreds of Years before <hi>Caprae Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>put,</hi> or <hi>Gateſide</hi> is mentioned by the moſt early of our Latin Hiſtorians.</p>

               <p>SOME, are of Opinion, that <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> got it's Name of <hi>Monkcheſter,</hi> becauſe the Monks in Time of Danger came for Protection to it, and not from their inhabiting it.

Mr. <hi>Eachard</hi> in his Hiſtory of <hi>England</hi> ſays, that <hi>Monkcheſter</hi> was ſo called from certain Monks who <hi>lived there</hi> in great

Auſterity and Retirement; and the <hi>Monaſticon</hi> gives us the following Account. In the Year 1074, there was a certain Man in the Province of the <hi>Mercians,</hi> a Presbyter and Prior of the Monaſtery of <hi>Wincheleſcumbe,</hi> who was a Monk, whoſe Name was <hi>Aldwin:</hi> This Man preferr'd a voluntary Poverty and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the World to all it's Honours and Riches; and having learned from the Hiſtory of the <hi>Northumbers,</hi> that that Land was formerly famous for Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Monks and religious Men, who tho' in the Fleſh, lived not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Fleſh, but whilſt they were on Earth, had their Converſation in Heaven: He deſired greatly to viſit the Monaſteries of theſe Places, (tho' He knew they were forſaken and left deſolate) and there to lead a poor Life in Imitation of them. Coming therefore as far as the Monaſtery of <hi>Eveſham,</hi> he made known his Purpoſe to certain of the Brethren; upon which, two of them aſſociated with him; one of them was named <hi>Elfwie,</hi> who was a Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, and after that a Prieſt; The other's Name was <hi>Renifrid;</hi> he was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Letters. Theſe the <hi>Abbot</hi> gave leave to accompany him, but not 'till he had ſet <hi>Aldwin</hi> over them, and committed to him the Care of their Souls. After this, they ſet forward on their Journey a Foot, having an Aſs to carry their Books, Neceſſaries, and their Sacerdotal Veſtments, to celebrate divine Service in. At length they came to <hi>York,</hi> deſiring of <hi>Hugh,</hi> the Son of <hi>Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drick,</hi> who was then Sheriff, <note n="b" place="margin">

               <p>AND now how long it had been in this deſolate Condition we may gather from <note n="c" place="margin">Mag. Brit. Nov. &amp; An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiq. ex <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biuſ.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Hollingſhead.</hi> By the Invaſion of the <hi>Danes,</hi> ſays he, the Churches and Monaſteries throughout <hi>Northumberland</hi> were ſo waiſted and ruined, that a Man could ſcarcely find a Church ſtanding at this Time in all that Country; and as for thoſe that remained, they were all covered with Broom or Thatch: And as for any <hi>Abby</hi> or <hi>Monaſtery</hi> there was not one left in all the Country; neither did any Man, for the Space of <hi>Two hundred Years,</hi> take Care for the repairing or building up of any Thing in Decay; ſo that the People of this County knew not what a Monk meant. And if they ſaw any, they wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the Strangeneſs of the Sight. One Place there was in this County, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for being the Habitation of Monks, from whence it was called <hi>Monk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> but that alſo was ſo ruinated and deſtroy'd, that when the Monks of <hi>Mercia</hi> (the Monks mentioned before) came to it, they found no Token or Remnant of any Religions Perſons who had had an Habitation there; all was defaced and gone.</p>
               <p>NOW with reſpect to <hi>Monkcheſter</hi> this ſeems to be punctually true. For as <hi>Hollingſhead</hi> obſerves that it was about 200 Years from the Ruin of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſteries to this Time after the Conqueſt <note n="d" place="margin">Anno 1074</note>; ſo it muſt be taken Notice of, that the <hi>Danes,</hi> in the Year <note n="e" place="margin">Hollin.</note> 875, which was the 4th of the Reign of King <hi>Alured,</hi> divided themſelves. So that King <hi>Haldon</hi> with one Part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of went into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and lay in the Winter Seaſon near <note n="‡" place="margin">He ſat down with his Men at <hi>Tames<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> which is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Gate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide</hi> and <hi>Whickham. Sim. Dunel'.</hi>
                  </note> to the River of <hi>Tyne,</hi> where he divided the Country amongſt his Men, and remained there for the Space of two Years, and oftentimes fetched thither Booties and Preys out of the Country of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT appears then from this, that the Monaſteries of <hi>Monkcheſter</hi> had been in Ruins about 200 Years, that is to ſay, from the Year 875 to the Year 1074, the Time of the Coming of the <hi>Mercian</hi> Monk.</p>
               <p>LET us now ſee if we can form any probable Conjecture when it was firſt inhabited by <hi>Monks,</hi> and got the Name of <hi>Monkcheſter.</hi> And this I imagine happen'd towards the later End of the 7th Century. For in the Year 635, the Monaſtical Life was brought in among the <hi>Northumbers</hi> by <hi>Aidan,</hi> who was

In their Return, they paſſed through <hi>Durham,</hi> which at this Time was a Place wild and not habitable, being all a Wood, full of thick Buſhes and Trees, ſaving only a little Plain upon the Top of the Hill, which was wont to be ſowed, and is the very Place where now the <hi>Church</hi> ſtandeth,) and were mightily taken with the Situation of it. Here <hi>Aldwinus</hi> firſt depoſited the Body of St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> and reſolved to make this Place his Epiſcopal Seat. Having therefore grubb'd up the Wood, he began to build a Church of Stone,<note place="margin">Mag. Britt. p. 742. ex Godwin.</note> and Houſes about it for his Company. The <hi>Governour</hi> of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> then named <hi>Uthred,</hi> and the People from the River <hi>Coqued</hi> to the <hi>Tees,</hi> came in ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to his Aſſiſtance, and continued their Help ſo long, that the Wood was ſoon grubbed up and the Church and Houſes finiſhed, inſomuch that <hi>Aldwin</hi> dedicated the Church in the 3d year after he began the Work, upon <hi>Sept.</hi> the 4th. This was the Beginning of the Church and City of <hi>Durham</hi> or <hi>Dunhelm</hi> more properly, which takes it Name from <hi>Dun,</hi> which ſignifies a Mountain, and <hi>Holm</hi> a River-Iſland in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Language, becauſe the River <hi>Were,</hi> with it's circling Stream, waſhes the Hill on which it ſtands on all Sides, ſo that it makes it almoſt an Iſland. — <hi>Aldwin</hi> died in the year <hi>1017,</hi> and was ſucceeded by <hi>Eadmund,</hi> who was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected the year <hi>1020,</hi> after the See had been vacant about <hi>3</hi> years, he died <hi>Anno 1040,</hi> and was buried in the Church of <hi>Durham.

                        <hi>Stavely</hi> in his Hiſtory of Churches gives us the following Account. That Privilege which I read to have been granted unto the Church of the once eminent Monaſtery of <hi>Hagulſtad</hi> is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable: That is, there were <hi>4 Croſſes</hi> ſet up at a certain Diſtance from the Church, in the four Ways leading thereto.

He was a Man, grave, modeſt, meek, courteous, aſſable, yet ſevere and rigid in puniſhing the Faults of thoſe under his Charge; learned and eloquent, and a diligent Searcher of Hiſtory and Antiquities, and tho' he taught Philoſophy and Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity publickly in his Monaſtery, yet in private He, as much as Time would permit, read Hiſtorians, and particularly venerable <hi>Bede.</hi> He made an Addition of <hi>25</hi> Years to the Hiſtory of <hi>Simeon</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> beginning at the 9th Year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 2d, and proceeding to the firſt of King <hi>Richard,</hi> calling it an Hiſtory of <hi>25</hi> Years.

                     <p>The other is <hi>Richard</hi> of <hi>Hexam,</hi> firſt Monk, and then Prior of that Monaſtery, educated there in Monaſtical and School Learning, and in all Sorts of Piety; ſo diligently imitated his Maſter, <hi>John,</hi> Prior of that Place, that he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him in that Employment, and in Teaching.

flouriſhed in this whole Kingdom. This Account <hi>Hollingſhead</hi> gives in the following Words: Great Numbers of Perſons daily offered themſelves to be baptized, inſomuch that within the Space of 7 Days (as is left in Writing) <hi>Aidan</hi> chriſtned 15 Thouſand Perſons, of the which no ſmall Part forſaking the World, betook themſelves to a Solitary kind of Life. Thus by continual Preaching the Goſpel in that Country, it came to paſs in the End, that the Faith was generally received of all the People; and ſuch Zeal to advance the Chriſtian Religion daily increaſed amongſt them, that no where could be found greater. Hereupon were no ſmall Number of Churches built in all Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces abroad in thoſe Parts by Procurement of King <hi>Oſwold,</hi> all Men liberally conſenting (according to the rated Subſtance) to be Contributors towards the Charges. By this Means the Kingdom of the <hi>Northumbers</hi> flouriſh'd, as well in Fame of Increaſe of Religion, as alſo in civil Policy and prudent Ordinances.</p>
               <p>When now it is conſidered that the Buſineſs of Religion went on ſo Brisk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly throughout the whole Kingdom of the <hi>Northumbers;</hi> it is rational to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that this Place, as it was not only convenient for the monaſtical Life as to Retirement, but alſo a Security to it too, (being at that Time a garriſon'd Fort) was certainly as early inhabited by the Monks as the abovementioned Time; and beſides if we conſider the Veneration it is mention'd with by many Hiſtorians for the ſevere rigid Lives of it's Monks; how it was the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Place in the North, for the monaſtical Life, ſo very famous on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as to change it's former Name to that of <hi>Monkcheſter:</hi> There can ſcarce be allowed it a later Time to arrive at ſuch a Pitch of Eminency and Glory. Before the Name of <hi>Monkcheſter,</hi> I imagine, from it's being a Place of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, that it had the Name of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> as <hi>Weremuth</hi> was the original Name of that Place, but was afterwards called <hi>Monkweremuth,</hi> from the Monks inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biting there. It ſeems all along to have been a Place of Defence and Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. It was the Ancient <hi>Gabroſentum,</hi> according to Mr. <hi>Cambden;</hi> or as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers more juſtly imagine the <hi>Pons Aelii</hi> of the <hi>Romans;</hi> was a garriſon'd Fort, 'till inhabited by the Monks; and was ſuch from the Time of the Monks 'till the Conqueſt.</p>
               <p>THE Name of <hi>Monkcheſter</hi> continued 'till the Building of the Caſtle, and after that, from the Building of it, it got the Name of <hi>New-caſtle:</hi> The Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of which was this. <hi>Malcolme</hi> King of <hi>Scotland</hi> having entred with his Army into the Confines of <hi>England,</hi> came with it into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and waiſted and plundered the whole Country as far as the River <hi>Tyne;</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror being all the while in <hi>Normandy,</hi> and alſo his Son <hi>Robert Curtois.</hi> But no ſooner were the King and his Son come into <hi>England,</hi> than <hi>Robert</hi> was ſent with an Army againſt <hi>Malcolme</hi> to drive him out of the Country. The <hi>Scots</hi> being appriz'd of this, retir'd into their own Country, and <hi>Robert</hi> with his Army encamp'd upon the Banks of the <hi>Tyne,</hi> where he built the <hi>Caſtle</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend theſe Northern Parts from the Incurſions of the <hi>Scots,</hi> for the <note n="h" place="margin">Mag.

               </p>
               <p>THUS the Town loſt it's Name of <hi>Monkcheſter</hi> for that of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> which it retains to this Day.

               <p>AFTER this the Town grew more populous, and increas'd in Trade and Wealth; had great Privileges granted them by the Kings, built Churches, Monaſteries, Walls, Bridges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as ſhall be ſeen in the following Treatiſe.</p>

               <p>IT is ſurrounded with a <hi>Stone-Wall,</hi> which at the Time it was built, and for many Ages after, was undoubtedly of very great Strength.

On the Out-ſide of it is a Ditch or Trench, and on the Inſide it is ramper'd with Earth.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Grey.</note>THE Cauſe of Building this great Wall was the often Invaſion of the <hi>Scots</hi> into this Place and Country; they continually infeſted it and the rich Monaſteries in theſe Northern Parts; the religious Houſes of this Town, and the adiacent Places being above Forty.</p>
               <p>SOME are of Opinion, that the Walls were begun in the Reign of <hi>King Henry the Third.</hi> But the Author juſt now mentioned, imagines Them to have been earlier. King <hi>John,</hi> he ſays, gave great Priviledges to this Town, and probably the <hi>New-gate,</hi> and Walls thereabout, were built in his Time; the North Part of the Wall being the oldeſt, and of another Faſhion than the other Walls.</p>
               <p>IN the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d, the ſame Author ſays, the Weſt part of the Wall was built; but I am rather inclined to believe, that that Part of the Wall was not built 'till the Reign of <hi>Edward the 1ſt.</hi> The Wall from

the Time it was begun, went on but ſlowly 'till this Reign, when an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hapned, which revived the former Fears of the Towns-Men, and put them in Mind of the neglected Wall, which, 'till that Time had got no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than <hi>Ever-Tower,</hi> as appears by the old Part of the Wall, ending there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. The Accident was this, <note n="b" place="margin">Cambden.</note> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 1ſt, a very <hi>rich Burgher</hi> being carried off a Priſoner by the <hi>Scots,</hi> out of the Middle of the Town, firſt paid a round Ranſom himſelf, and afterwards began the 1ſt For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of the Place.</p>
               <p>IT is true, that this Accident was the Occaſion of carrying on the Wall; but Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> is miſtaken in ſaying it occaſioned the Beginning of it. For it was begun ſome Years before the Reign of <hi>Edward the 1ſt.</hi> For from <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate</hi> to the <hi>Ever-Tower</hi> as has juſt now been obſerved, is a Work older, and vaſtly different from what the Wall is from <hi>Ever-Tower</hi> towards the <hi>Weſt-gate.</hi> This Wall, leading to the <hi>Weſt-gate,</hi> was it which was begun in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 1ſt, for in this Reign it was, (when Leave was granted to the preaching Friers to break out that <hi>Little Gate</hi> which now leads into the <hi>Wardens-Cloſe,</hi> then their Garden, that this Wall was called the <note n="c" place="margin">Vid. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham-Tower <hi>and</hi> Black-Friers.</note> 
                  <hi>New-Wall;</hi> and ſurely a New-Wall, will imply that there was an Old one before, was the thing itſelf not ſtill a Matter of Fact as it really is to any Obſerver.</p>
               <p>HOW long the Walls were a Building, or who they were in particular that contributed towards the Building of them, is a Matter pretty much in the Dark. However, 'tis <note n="d" place="margin">

He was a bitter Enemy to this Town, and did all the Miſchief to it that lay in his Power, as appears in every Page of his Book. In which are Numbers of Falſities.</p>
                  </note> ſuppoſed, that King <hi>Edward the 1ſt,</hi> was a Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butor to them. The Names of ſome of the Round-Towers alſo give us ſome Light, which to this Day do ſeemingly bear the Names of their ancient Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which may in ſome Meaſure occaſion a Gueſs at the Time of their Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.</p>
               <p>THE Town, after the compleating of the Walls, was divided into 24 <hi>Wards,</hi> according to the Number of the Gates, and round Towers in the Wall, which Towers and Gates were wont be defended in Times of Hoſtili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with the <hi>Scots,</hi> by the particular Wards appropriated to them.</p>
               <p>THE 1ſt Gate I ſhall begin with is the <hi>Cloſe-gate,</hi> which is ſo called, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſtands in a narrow Street called the Cloſe, it had in Ward, from the <hi>Cloſe-gate</hi> upon the <hi>South-rawe,</hi> ſo going Eaſtward unto the <hi>Javil-grippe,</hi> but nothing of <hi>Javil-grippe,</hi> then going Weſtward upon the North unto the <hi>Cloſe-gate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM the <hi>Cloſe-gate</hi> there are Stairs leading up to a <hi>Round-Tower</hi> called the <hi>White-Fryer-Tower.</hi> This Tower had in Ward, from the Eaſt-end of <hi>Bailiff-gate,</hi> oppoſite to the <hi>Javil-grippe,</hi> with all that dwell upon the <hi>High-Stairs</hi> in the <hi>Cloſe,</hi> unto and with the Weſt-ſide of theſe <hi>Stairs</hi> that lead unto the <hi>South-Poſtern</hi> of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> with all <hi>Javil-grippe</hi> Eaſtward, and from the <hi>Javil-grippe</hi> to the South-rawe of the Cloſe, and with all the <hi>Bridge-End.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Tower, with the Wall leading to the <hi>little Gate,</hi> (commonly called the <hi>Poſtern-gate,</hi> but originally the Gate of the <hi>White-Fryers,</hi> or <hi>White-Fryer-gate</hi>) were together with the Gate itſelf, probably built by the <hi>White-Fryers;</hi> for the <hi>White-Fryers</hi> were ſituated in the South-weſt-end of the Street of <hi>Weſt-gate,</hi> in the ſame Grounds were are now the Houſes of Mr. <hi>Anderſon, George Grey,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and others. And as it is reaſonable to believe, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>Religious Houſe,</hi> or <hi>Nobleman,</hi> built a Tower or Piece of the Wall, that it would be built chiefly for their own Security; ſo the Buildings now mentioned, being ſo ſituated as I have juſt now obſerved, are a Proof that the <hi>White-Fryers</hi> were the Founders. And if it be conſidered that the <hi>White-Fryers</hi> were <note n="e" place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> White-Fryers.</note> founded by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 1ſt, in whoſe Reign the above-mentioned Accident happened, which occaſioned a freſh Beginning of Building of the Wall; it will appear ſtill more probable, that theſe <hi>Fryers</hi> were the Builders. It may indeed be ſaid, that as they were ſounded in this
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0583000100:23"/>
Reign, it can't be imagin'd they had ſufficient Riches for ſuch an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. This is readily granted, but when it is conſidered, that theſe <hi>Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> were newly founded by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 1ſt, that they were the firſt of that Order that had been in this Place, that they were <hi>Carmelites,</hi> or original<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly coming from Mount <hi>Carmel</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> and that the Prayers of all Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were thought more particularly available for the Souls in Purgatory; it will follow I think rationally, that they were more able <hi>then</hi> to do ſuch a Thing by getting the Contributions of others, than they could have been of themſelves 200 Years after. The Name given to theſe Walls is alſo another Argument; it is more probable, that the <hi>White-Fryer-Tower,</hi> the <hi>Wall</hi> and <hi>Gate</hi> now mentioned, were ſo called, (as other Towers were) from their Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, than from their bare Situation. For the Walls behind the <hi>Black-Fryers</hi> are not called after their Name, becauſe they were not built by them, but by King <hi>Edward</hi> the 1ſt, as ſhall be ſhewn below.</p>
               <p>THIS Tower is now the <hi>Meeting-Houſe</hi> or <hi>Hall</hi> of the Company of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>GREY</hi> in mentioning the Ports or Gates of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> ſays, there were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Theſe, Poſtern-Gates</hi> belonging to the <hi>Religious Houſes;</hi> I have met with no more than three, and this <hi>White-Friers-gate</hi> is undoubtedly one of them. It ſeems to be much of the ſame Kind with that which leads into the <hi>Warden's-Cloſe.</hi> It has been an Out-let to the Fryers, that they might walk to the <hi>Forth</hi> and the <hi>neighbouring Fields;</hi> and that it might be of Uſe and Service to the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> in Times of Hoſtility with the <hi>Scots.</hi> I imagine it was out at this Gate, that the <hi>Townſmen</hi> made that famous Sally, mention'd by <hi>Grey,</hi> who ſays, that in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, <note n="f" place="margin">See a more perfect Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the Year of the Mayors, <hi>1342.</hi>
                  </note> Three hundred valiant Men iſſued out of the Town through a <hi>Poſtern-gate,</hi> and came ſuddenly in the Night up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a great Army of the <hi>Scots,</hi> which lay in the Weſt Part of the Town, and raiſed the Army, put them to flight, and took Earl <hi>Murray</hi> Priſoner in his Tent, and others.</p>
               <p>THE next Round Tower to <hi>White-Fryer-gate</hi> is <hi>Denton-Tower,</hi> or <hi>Nevil-Tower,</hi> which had in Ward all the <hi>Hairy-Hugh,</hi> on the South Side of the <hi>White-Fryers,</hi> with all the Houſes ſtanding there, upon the <hi>Burn-bank,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Fryer-Kirk,</hi> and a Burne, unto the Stone Bridge in <hi>Bailiff-gate,</hi> with all <hi>Bailiff-gate,</hi> upward that ſame Rawe unto <hi>Denton-Chare,</hi> with <hi>Denton-Chare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHY it was called <hi>Denton-Tower,</hi> I can give no Reaſon, unleſs it was from it's having in Ward the Lane called <hi>Denton-Chare;</hi> but it has the Name of <hi>Nevil-Tower,</hi> from the <hi>Nevil</hi> Family of <hi>Raby</hi> who built it, which Family was honoured with the Title of <hi>Earl</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d, <hi>Ralph Nevil</hi> Lord of <hi>Raby,</hi> being created <hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> in the 21ſt of that Reign: His Houſe in <hi>Weſt-gate,</hi> called <hi>Weſtmoreland-place,</hi> which ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered when we treat of that Street, had this Tower built behind it for it's Security and Defence. The Tower is now the Hall of the <hi>Wallers, Brick-layers</hi> and <hi>Plaiſterers,</hi> and was repair'd by them <hi>Anno Dom'</hi> 1711, <hi>Richard Flet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher,</hi> and <hi>William Johnſon,</hi> Wardens.</p>
               <p>THE next Round Tower is <hi>Weſt-ſpittle-Tower,</hi> which had in Ward the <hi>Side</hi> upon the Weſt Rawe under the Caſtle Moat, from the <hi>Caſtle-gate,</hi> ſo down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward on that Rawe, to and with a great Waſte belonging to <hi>Laurentius Acton,</hi> oppoſite to a Corner Shop of a Chauntery in St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Kirk,</hi> next the Pant; alſo from that Pant upwards upon the Eaſt-Rawe in the <hi>Side,</hi> with the <hi>South Kirk-Style</hi> of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> by the Eaſt-Side of St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Tower has it's Name from St. <hi>Mary the Virgin's Hoſpital,</hi> which was otherwiſe called <hi>Weſt-ſpittle,</hi> to which it almoſt adjoins; it muſt have been built by the Maſter and Brethren of that Hoſpital for the ſame Reaſons that the other two Towers before-mentioned were built by their ſuppoſed Founders.</p>

                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0583000100:24"/>THE Tower next to this has the Name of <hi>Stank-Tower.</hi> It had in Ward all <note n="*" place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>BETWEEN this Tower, and one next to it, is a <hi>Poſtern</hi> which leads to the Forth. It was made <hi>Anno</hi> 1705, when <hi>Thomas Waſs,</hi>

                  <hi>PILGRIM-STREET-GATE</hi> had it's Name from the <hi>Pilgrims</hi> who were wont to lodge in that Street, and go out of that Gate when they came to viſit the Shrine of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> at <hi>Geſmunde;</hi> to which Place with great Confluence and Devotion they came from all Parts of this Land in theſe Times of Superſtition. It is now the Hall of the Company of <hi>Joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> who repair'd it 1716, <hi>Thomas French</hi> and <hi>Paul Cook</hi> being Wardens.

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0583000100:27"/>
of them Magiſtrates of <hi>Newcaſtle:</hi> and as this appears probable from the Name, ſo it is alſo equally probable that the Founder of this Tower had his Houſe ſomewhere at the Head of <hi>Pilgrimſtreet,</hi> nigh his own Tower, as <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi>'s Tower was behind his Houſe; and that the Field called vulgarly <hi>Carling Croft,</hi> had it's Name of <hi>Carliol Croft,</hi> being at that Time of Day the Property of this Founder. The laſt Mayor of this Town of that Name, before the Completion of the Walls, was <hi>Nicholas de Carliol</hi> in the 2d Year of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, ſo that this Tower could not be much later in Building, to ſay the leaſt of it's Antiquity imaginable; but it is rather probable it was built a good while earlier. It has to Ward all the Eaſt Raw of <hi>Pilgrim-ſtreet</hi> within the Yate, and without the Yate, from and with the <hi>Maudlins,</hi> ſo coming inward upon the Eaſt-Raw, unto the <hi>Auſtin-Chair.</hi>

               <p>THIS Tower commonly called the <hi>Carpenters</hi> Tower, becauſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Carpenters or Ship-wrights meet in it, was one of the Towers of the <hi>Old Romans.</hi> This Company in the Year 1716, built upon the under Part of it a very grand and ſtately <hi>Square-Tower,</hi> adorn'd at the Top Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners with 4 <hi>fair Turrets</hi> built in the form of a Lanthorn.</p>

               </p>
               <p>THERE is under it an ancient Poſtern-gate, which leads into the Field called the <hi>Garth-Heads,</hi> the moſt part of which was laſt Year encloſed and turned into Garden-ground, by <hi>Richard Ridley,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>IT muſt not be forgot what is mentioned in the Manuſcript of Mr. <hi>John Milbank,</hi> that between every one of theſe Towers, there were for the moſt Part 2 <hi>Watch-Towers</hi> made ſquare, with the Effigies of Men cut in Stone up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Tops of them, as tho' they were <hi>watching,</hi> and they were called <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret,</hi> which had Square Holes over the Walls to through Sones down.</p>
               <p>WHEN theſe Walls were finiſhed is not exactly found. <hi>Grey</hi> 
                  <note n="o" place="margin">Grey 7.</note> ſeems to think they were finiſhed ſome little Time before the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th.</p>
               <p>BUT this I imagine is a Date too late for the finiſhing of them; for <hi>Henry</hi> the 4th, in the 4th Year of his Reign, <hi>Aug.</hi> 16, granted at the Caſtle of <hi>Port-tefract,</hi> that all Fines, Redemptions, Amerciaments, Iſſues, Forfeitures and Profits, as well of Pleas as that of Juſtices of the Peace, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> be received by the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> of this <hi>Town</hi> and their <hi>Officers,</hi> for ſupporting, amending, and repairing the <hi>Walls, Bridges</hi> and <hi>Gates of the Town.</hi> The Walls then in this Reign muſt have been compleated, foraſmuch as they then probably wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Repairs.</p>
               <p>BUT further had <hi>Grey</hi> remembered his own Story above-mention'd, of the 300 <hi>valiant Men,</hi> that iſſued out at the <hi>White-fryer-gate,</hi> and put the <hi>Scottiſh Army</hi> to flight, he would ſurely have concluded that the Walls were finiſhed before that Accident, which hapned in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d. Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Army, which is ſaid to have been a great one, would not have
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0583000100:29"/>
lodged without the Town if they could have lodged in it, and what ſhould hinder their lodging in it, but the Walls of the Town well guarded? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude therefore that the Walls of the Town at the lateſt were compleated in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, before the Year 1342 for it was in this Year that this Tranſaction hapned.</p>
               <p>AFTER they were finiſhed, it <note n="p" place="margin">Grey 27.</note> was famous for being a Bullwark againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> all the Power of <hi>Scotland</hi> could never win it, but of late, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Time of the Civil Wars, being aſſiſted by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it was ſtormed, and our Churches and Houſes defaced, and the Ornaments of both taken away.</p>
               <p>IT is now going faſt into Ruins, ſeveral of the <hi>Turrets</hi> and ſome of the <hi>round Towers</hi> being fallen; but the Towers which ſtand, together with ſome lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Parts of the Wall adjoining to them, are kept in good Repair by their reſpective Companies.</p>
               <p>THE Circumference of this Wall, from the <hi>Cloſe-gate,</hi> to the ſame, is two Miles and 175 Yards.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Dominicans</hi> commonly called <hi>Black-Fryers, Preaching-Fryers,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobine Fryers,</hi> came over into <hi>England</hi> in the Year of our Lord <note n="a" place="margin">Fuller C. Hiſt.</note> 1221, or as others ſay, 1217, and had their firſt Reſidence in <hi>Oxford,</hi> they were a <hi>Prior</hi> and 12 <hi>Brethren;</hi> their Prior's Name was <hi>Gilbert de Fraxineto;</hi> the Name of the Order was taken from St. <hi>Dominick,</hi> born at <hi>Cologona</hi> in <hi>Spain:</hi> Of this Order were no ſewer than fourſcore famous Engliſh Writers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <note n="b" place="margin">De reb. Novocaſt'.</note>This Monaſtery was founded by Sir <hi>Peter Scott,</hi> who was the firſt Mayor of <hi>Newcaſtle, Anno</hi> 1251, and Sir <hi>Nicholas Scott</hi> his Son, who was one of the 4 Bailiffs of the Town, 1254, 1257, and <hi>Capital Bailiff,</hi> 1269; but the Site of it was given by 3 Siſters, whoſe Names have long ſince been ingratefully buried in Oblivion.</p>
                  <p>WHEN was the particular Time of it's Building, I have met with no Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count; but it is not difficult to give a probable Gueſs; the Order itſelf of the <hi>Dominicans</hi> or <hi>Black-Fryes</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> as is mentioned above, in the Year 1221; conſequently it muſt have been founded after that Time: And that it muſt have been founded ſome Years before the Year 1280, is plain to a Demonſtration. For in that Year, which was the Eight of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, the <hi>Black-Fryers</hi> had Licence from the King to break a Door through this <hi>New Wall,</hi>

                     <note n="d" place="margin">Grey 20.</note>WE are told, that this Monaſtery was in old Time called the <hi>Grey-Fryers;</hi> which in my Opinion is a Thing highly Improbable; for the <hi>Grey-Fryers,</hi> or <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> came not into <hi>England</hi> 'till about the Year 1224; and if as I have proved above, the <hi>Black-fryers</hi> were a Settled Body ſome Years before the Year 1280; how is it poſſible to have been called of old Time the <hi>Grey-Fryers?</hi> This is therefore a Miſtake, and beſide, the <hi>Dominicans</hi> came into <hi>England</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> or <hi>Grey-Fryers,</hi> and therefore more probably were ſooner in this Place.</p>
                  <p>IT has been a very ſtately and Beautiful Building, as appears by the preſent Remains of it. The <hi>Area</hi> or <hi>Graſs-plat</hi> is about 87 Foot in Length, and as many in Breadth; on the Eaſt Side of it was the <hi>Chapel,</hi> which is now the <hi>Hall</hi> of the Company of <hi>Smiths</hi> in this Town. On the Weſt-ſide of it is a curious <hi>Old Well,</hi> which ſerved the Monaſtery with Water, called our <hi>Lady's Well.</hi> On the South may ſtill be ſeen the Ruins of a curious Front, on which Side is the <hi>Hall</hi> of the <hi>Cordwainers,</hi> in which I ſaw a Pair of winding Stairs, which they told me (before they were walled up) led by a Vault as far as the Nunnery of St. <hi>Bartholomew.</hi> On the North of it were their <hi>Gardens,</hi> a Part of which was the <hi>Warden</hi>'s <hi>Cloſe,</hi> before the Building of that Part of the <hi>Towns-wall.</hi> This appears by the Charter granted to this Monaſtery in the Reign of <hi>Edward the firſt,</hi> about breaking out that <hi>Narrow-Gate</hi> in the Wall between <hi>Weſtgate</hi> and <hi>Newgate;</hi> in which Grant it is ſaid, that the Wall went through the Middle of their Garden. This Monaſtery was dependant upon the Priory of <hi>Tinmouth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 2d, the Brethren of this Monaſtery had Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe granted them for the Building of a <hi>Drawbridge,</hi> beyond the <hi>New Ditch</hi> of the <hi>Caſtle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHO were the <hi>Priors</hi> of this Monaſtery, what eminent Men belonged to them, or what Things were tranſacted by them from their Beginning 'till their Diſſolution, were Things undoubtedly preſerved among themſelves whilſt they were a Body; but, after their Surrender, were either deſtroy'd, or have not yet come to Light.</p>
                  <p>ONE of the Priors of this Monaſtery was one <hi>Richard Marſhall.</hi> I take this Gentleman to have been the laſt <hi>Prior</hi> of this Monaſtery, for in the 28th of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, a Grant of a Tenement, nigh the White-Croſs, (ſigned by Fryer <hi>Richard Marſhal,</hi> Dr. and Prior; and Fryer <hi>David Simpſon,</hi> and Fryer <hi>John Sowrby</hi>) was given to <hi>Anthony Godſave,</hi> upon his paying to the ſaid Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory or Monaſtery 9 <hi>s.</hi> per Ann. This Grant is now in the Poſſeſſion of Mr. <hi>Thomas Marſhal,</hi> of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> Joyner, who purchaſed this Tenement, and has lately rebuilt it. He pays the ſame Rent to the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> which the Tenement pay'd to the Monaſtery.</p>
                  <p>ABOUT 2 Years after the Signing of this Deed, in <hi>January</hi> the 30th of this Reign this Monaſtery ſurrendered; it conſiſted of a <hi>Prior,</hi> and <hi>Twelve Fryers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Nature of ſurrendering was this, according to Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> who ſays, <note n="c" place="margin">

and other like papiſtical Ceremonies, wherein we have been moſt principally practiſed, and Noſe-led in Time paſt; but the very true Way to pleaſe God, and to live a true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Man, without all Hypocryſie and feigned Diſſimulation, is ſincerely declared to us by our Maſter Chriſt, his Evangeliſts and Apoſtles; being minded hereafter to follow the ſame, conforming ourſelves to the Will and Pleaſure of our Supreame-head, under God, on Earth, the King's Majeſty, and are not to follow henceforth the ſuperſtitious Traditions of any Forenſecal Potentate or Power, with mutual Aſſent and Conſent, do ſubmit ourſelves unto our ſaid Sovereign Lord, and with the like Aſſent and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent do ſurrender,</hi> &amp;c.

                     <hi>RICHARD Marſhal,</hi> Prior of the <hi>Black-Fryers</hi> in <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> about the Year 1551, went into <hi>Scotland</hi> and preach'd at St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> that the <hi>Pater Noſter</hi> ſhould be addreſſed to God, and not to the Saints. Some Doctors of the <hi>Univerſity</hi> being diſguſted at this Aſſertion, prevailed with one <hi>Tofts,</hi> a <hi>Grey-Fryer,</hi> to undertake to prove that the <hi>Pater-Noſter</hi> might be ſaid to the <hi>Saints;</hi> whoſe Ignorance in doing the ſame was ſo manifeſt, that he became the common Jeſt, and quitted the Town.</p>
                  <p>AFTER the Surrender of the Monaſtery on <hi>Jan.</hi> the 10th, 30th of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, the <hi>Black-Fryers</hi> was granted to the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> in Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of 53 <hi>l.</hi> 7 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi> The annual Value of it, was 2 <hi>l.</hi> 19 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King ſays in the Grant, that He gives to the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> the whole Houſe and Site, lately a <hi>Priory,</hi> or a <hi>Houſe of Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren,</hi> called vulgarly the <hi>Black-Fryers</hi> in <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne;</hi> The <hi>Chapel, Houſes, Edifices, Gardens,</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Hall,</hi> two <hi>Chambers,</hi> a Chamber called the <hi>Croſs-Chamber,</hi> and the two <hi>Gardens,</hi> with their Appurtenances, and the whole Cloſe within the <hi>Weſt-gate,</hi> and another Cloſe near the Site of the ſaid Priory on the North. And a Cloſe containing 3 Acres, and a Houſe in the ſame Cloſe without the Walls of the ſaid Town, and a Houſe called the <hi>Gate-houſe,</hi> ſituated near the Street.</p>
                  <p>IT alſo appears from the Grant, that the King reſerved to himſelf and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, the <hi>Bells</hi> and <hi>Lead</hi> that was upon the Church belonging to this Fryery, and the other Buildings of it; the Lead in the Gutters, together with the Stones and Iron of the Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Nine Crafts of this Town had their <hi>Meeting-houſes</hi> or <hi>Halls</hi> in it, and ſtill have, except two of them, the <hi>Taylors</hi> and the <hi>Cordwainers,</hi> who have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed theſe upon ſome poor Widows, and got themſelves others in other Places. Theſe Halls are of great Service to this ancient Building, in preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from an entire Ruin. Such is the Hall of the <hi>Smiths,</hi> which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired by them in the Year 1709, <hi>John Kellet, Thomas Turner, Jonathan Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Roger Haddock</hi> being Wardens; The Hall of the <hi>Dyers,</hi> The Hall of the <hi>Bakers</hi> and <hi>Brewers,</hi> which was repair'd <hi>Ann'</hi> 1711, <hi>Chriſtopher Rutter, Lionel Dixon, William Dove, John Make-piece,</hi> being then Wardens: Theſe Halls are on the Eaſt-ſide of the Fryery.

                     </note> 
                     <hi>Sadlers,</hi> which was repair'd by them in the Year 1729, <hi>Cuthbert Berkley</hi> and <hi>Matthew Anderſon,</hi> Wardens; and the Hall of the <hi>Skinners</hi> and <hi>Glovers,</hi> which was repaired by them in the Year, 1712, <hi>John Emmerſon, Robert Barnes, Robert Shutt, Philip Smith</hi> being Wardens. Such are thoſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo on the South-ſide of it, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Cordwainer</hi>'s Hall, which was turned into Appartments for three Widows, in the Year 1729, <hi>John Wheatley</hi> and <hi>George

Alder</hi> being Wardens; the Hall of the <hi>Butchers,</hi> and the Hall of the <hi>Tanners,</hi> was repair'd in the Year 1717, <hi>Thomas Anderſon, William Harriſon, Thomas Dixon, William Slaiter</hi> then Wardens.</p>
                  <p>BY Means of theſe Halls, there is ſtill ſome Viſage of the Fryery remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which had otherwiſe been intirely in the Duſt. 'Tis a Pity that thoſe People who are permitted by the Companies to reſide in ſome of thoſe Rooms are not threatned into more Cleanlineſs, and that the Companies themſelves are not at the Expence of repairing the Area; were theſe Things done, it would be a Beautiful Piece of Antiquity, and an Entertainment to the Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, from whenceſoever they came.</p>

                  <p>IN coming back by the narrow Lane which led to the <hi>Black-fryers,</hi> we face a little Street called <hi>Fennel Street,</hi> which leads into <hi>Weſtgate;</hi> a Street more retired than any other in this Town; there being no Artificers or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanicks in this Street, nor any Market. It is chiefly inhabited by the <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Gentry;</hi> and indeed it ſeems all along to have been inhabited by ſuch more than by others. In ſome Writings above 400 Years old, we meet with the Names of ſome <hi>Clergy-men</hi> who lived in this Street, <hi>viz. Robertus de Gonwerton, Thomas Abelot, &amp;c.</hi> not to mention thoſe who belonged to the Monaſteries and Hoſpitals; and <hi>Grey</hi> tells us, that the Men who lived in this Street in his Time, had Employment for both Town and Country, he ſays alſo that in old Time the Earl of <hi>Weſtmoreland</hi> had his Houſe in this Street.</p>
                  <p>AT preſent ſeveral of the Houſes in it, are large and beautiful; ſuch are the Houſes of the Lady <hi>Clavering,</hi> of <hi>Utrick Whitfield,</hi>

                  <p>ON the North Side of this Street, a little above St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church, is the <hi>Vicarage</hi> Houſe, the Dwelling of the <hi>Vicars</hi> of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> It ſtands, at leaſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually pleaſant with the other Houſes in this Place, being ſituated in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of Fields and Gardens, and more retir'd, being at ſome Diſtance from the Street.</p>
                  <p>WHO it was that built this Houſe, I have not been able to learn; but 'tis not improbable that it was the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> who has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways famous for it's Generoſity to it's Clergy; as the Vicarage itſelf in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular muſt always acknowledge.

                  </p>
                  <p>THERE is a <hi>Hall</hi> belonging to this Houſe, built in a very grand and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Manner, according to the Hoſpitality of the Times it was built in. In particular, it was the Place where the <hi>Vicars</hi> of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> were wont to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain the inferiour Officers of Churches, the <hi>Clarks, Sextons, &amp;c.</hi> at the Seaſon of <hi>Chriſtmas.</hi> If I am not very much miſtaken, there are many ſtill living, who remember this laudable Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Garden</hi> belonging to this Houſe, tho' beneath ſome others in this Street for Art and Curioſity, and Beauty of Flowers; yet in this it glories above all the others, that the <hi>Roman-Wall,</hi> which was undoubtedly one of the great Works of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> is ſaid to have paſſed through the middle of it.</p>

                  <p>THIS Church is ſituated almoſt cloſe to the Vicarage. It is dedicated to St. <hi>John the Baptiſt;</hi> but who was the Founder I never met with: I am inclinable to believe it was founded by the <hi>Towns-people,</hi> notwithſtanding a Conjecture of an <hi>Anonymous Gentleman,</hi> which is, that <hi>Robert Rhodes</hi> was the Builder of this Church. But this I think is impoſſible; for the earlieſt he can be ſuppoſed to have lived, is about the Year 1430, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th, when <hi>John Rhodes,</hi> who was perhaps his Father, was Mayor; whereas it is certain this Church was built at leaſt an Hundred Years before. For the Grant of <hi>Adam</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> to the the Prieſt of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Martyr's <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi> in this Church, bears Date the 26th of <hi>March,</hi> 1319, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 2d; conſequently then the Church muſt have been in being at this Time, and ſo could not have been built by <hi>Robert Rhodes.</hi> Nay, in a Charter dated 1287, belonging to the Rev. Mr. <hi>Smith</hi> of <hi>Melſomby,</hi> to whom I have been obliged for a Sight of a great many Writings, I meet with theſe Words, <hi>Venellum quo itur ad Eccleſiam Sancti Joannis.</hi> So that this Church was ſtill earlier in Being, <hi>viz.</hi> in the 15th of <hi>Edward</hi> the 1ſt. However, it is ſuppoſed that the <hi>Steeple</hi> of this Church was either built, or at leaſt beautified by him, as alſo the <hi>South-Croſs</hi> of the Church; for his <hi>Coat of Arms,</hi> as alſo theſe Words, <hi>Orate pro Anima Roberti Rhodes,</hi> are upon both of them; which indeed makes it ſomewhat probable.</p>
                  <p>THIS Church, as <hi>Grey</hi> informs us, was commended by an <hi>Arch-Prelate</hi> of this Kingdom, becauſe it reſembleth much a <note n="h" place="margin">Churches were uſually built in form of the Croſs, to repreſent and comme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morate the Croſs on which our Lord died.</note>

                  <p>WHEN this Prieſt of the Chantry dyed, another was to be choſen (after the Deceaſe of the Benefactor <hi>Adam</hi>) by the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Bailiffs</hi> of this Town for the Time being, together with four of the moſt diſcreet, and judicious Men of the Pariſh of St. <hi>John</hi> elected for that Purpoſe.

                  <p>THIS Writing was ſealed by the Seal of the Benefactor, and the <hi>Common Seal of the Town of Newcaſtle;</hi> and Witneſſed, by <hi>Richard de Emelden,</hi> then Mayor, <hi>Thomas de Friſmariſco, Richard de Acton, William de Burneton, Gilbert de Hankyn,</hi> Bailiffs of the Town, Sir <hi>Nicholas Scot,</hi> Knight, <hi>Nicholas de Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leol, Thomas de Carleol, Peter Graper,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>ANOTHER Chantry belonging to this Church, was that of <hi>our Lady,</hi> founded by <hi>Edward Scott,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d; the yearly Value of which was 4 <hi>l.</hi> 4 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> which aroſe out of Tenements in the <hi>Sandhill</hi> and <hi>Weſtgate.</hi>

                  <p>THE 3d Chantry was that of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> founded by <hi>John Dalton, William Atkinſhawe,</hi> and <hi>Andrew Accliffe,</hi> Clerks; the yearly Value of which was 5 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> which aroſe out of Tenements in <hi>Weſtgate, Side,</hi> without <hi>Weſtgate,</hi> and a Cloſe without <hi>Weſtgate.</hi>

                  <p>I have been told, that the <hi>Painted Glaſs</hi> on one of the South Windows of the Quire of this Church, had on it the Repreſentation of the <hi>Trinity.</hi> It does indeed ſtill reſemble ſome ſuch Thing, but, if the Knowledge of it was need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, it might be Queried whether it ever was any ſuch Repreſentation.</p>
                  <p>THERE is another Thing at the Top of this Quire, which tho' little known, is yet of greater Certainty; and that is, the <hi>Funnel,</hi> or <hi>Wood Box,</hi> in the Form of a <hi>Spout,</hi> which hangs from the Top of this Quire.

                  <p>THERE was formerly an <hi>Organ</hi> in this Church.

The old one muſt have been founded, not many Years after the <hi>Nunnery</hi> of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> which was founded by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt: For in a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter granted by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Second, to the <hi>Nuns</hi> of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> there is mention made of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s in this Town, as may be ſeen in our Account of <hi>theſe Nuns.</hi> But this Conjecture will be more confirm'd, if it be conſider'd that a Charity was beſtow'd on <hi>this Hoſpital</hi> by the Lord <hi>Walter de Bolbeck,</hi> (as is mention'd below) who,<note n="p" place="margin">Gib.

                     <hi>Aſelack</hi> of <hi>Killinghow</hi> or <hi>Killingworth,</hi> as he himſelf acknowledges in his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for that Purpoſe: I <hi>Aſelack</hi> of <hi>Killinghowe</hi> have founded the <hi>Hoſpital</hi> and <hi>Chapel</hi> of St. <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Virgin,</hi> upon my own Land, for <hi>Two Brethren</hi> to be <hi>Regulars,</hi> and one <hi>Chaplain</hi> to ſerve God and take Care of the Poor.</p>
                  <p>WE learn alſo from the ſame Charter, that the Founder devoted himſelf to God and Religion, as he himſelf ſays, (according to the Way of that Age) I render my ſelf to God, and the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> and the Brethren of the ſame Hoſpital there ſerving God; to do Works of Hoſpitality to the Poor,

the <hi>Needy Clergy</hi> and <hi>Pilgrims.</hi> And this, he ſays, he does for his own Soul,<note place="margin">St. <hi>MARY</hi>'s Hoſpital.</note> for the Soul of his Father and Mother, and his other Relations; together with the Souls of all the <hi>Benefactors</hi> of the Hoſpital.</p>
                  <p>SOME of the Witneſſes to this Foundation Charter, were <hi>Gilbert,</hi> Parſon of <hi>Eland, Richard,</hi> Parſon of <hi>Standfordham, Waldon</hi> Parſon of <hi>Newburne, Euſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chius,</hi> Parſon of <hi>Benton.</hi>

                  <p>THE particular Time when it was founded can't be exactly learned; there being no Date at the Charter. But it is probable from a Charter of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Firſt, that it was founded ſome little while before he began to Reign; for when he confirms the <note n="r" place="margin">Sciatis me dediſle &amp; conceſſiſſe Domino &amp; Sanctae Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae &amp; San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctimoniali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus de <hi>Novo Caſtello,</hi> pro ſalute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mae meae &amp; anteceſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum meo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, <hi>Aselack Burgeum me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um de Novo Caſtello,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p>WE meet alſo with an Account of a Third Foundation belonging to this <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> which Account is this. The <hi>Hoſpital</hi> of our <hi>Lady,</hi> called <hi>Weſtgate Spittle,</hi> was founded by the Inhabitants of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> for a <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Chaplain</hi> to ſay Divine Service for 6 <hi>Bede Folks</hi> in the <hi>Alms-houſe,</hi> and to lodge <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>way-faring People,</hi> and to <hi>bury</hi> ſuch as hapned to die there, and to diſtribute yearly <hi>Nine Chaldron</hi> of <hi>Coals</hi> among poor People. The yearly Value of this was 33 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s. De Rebus Novocaſt'.</hi>

                  <p>AFTER the founding of this <hi>Hoſpital</hi> and <hi>Chapel,</hi> there were ſeveral Dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Charities beſtowed upon it, as had been before upon the old one; ſome of the <hi>Benefactors</hi> of both which, and Maſters among a large Number which might be mentioned, are theſe following.</p>

                  <p>IN the 24th of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Weſtgate,</hi> and St. <hi>Mary Magdalene</hi> without <hi>Pilgrim-ſtreet-gate,</hi> were granted to <hi>Theophilus Adams</hi> and <hi>James Woodſhaw,</hi> under the yearly Rent of 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>Grammar-School</hi> of this Town, which is now at <hi>Weſt-ſpittle,</hi> was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally founded by <hi>Thomas Horſly,</hi> who was <hi>Mayor</hi> of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 1525. By his laſt Will he deviſed all his Lands in <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Death of him and his Wife, to erect a <hi>Grammar-School,</hi> which was to be free for any one within and without the Town, in the Manner directed by the ſaid Will.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>IT is very probable that the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> who always preſented a <hi>Maſter</hi> to this <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> as it did to St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi>'s and St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the <hi>Martyr</hi> upon <hi>Tyne-Bridge,</hi> did at this Time make the Maſter of the <hi>Grammar-School,</hi> Maſter alſo of the Hoſpital. <hi>Grey</hi> tells us, that the <hi>firſt Maſter</hi> of the <hi>head School,</hi> was the Rev. Maſter <hi>Robert Fowberry,</hi> a learned and painfull Man, to indoctrinate Youth in Greek and Latin: To be ſure he was the firſt Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter after the Removing of the <hi>School</hi> to the <hi>Weſt-ſpittle.</hi> For undoubtedly there were Maſters before that, as the School was ſo much earlier founded; And accordingly in the Manuſcript above-mentioned, 'tis ſaid, that when Mr. <hi>Burras</hi> gave over the the <hi>Free-School</hi> in St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Church-yard, the Mayor and 24 more ſent for Mr. <hi>Fowberry</hi> to <hi>Hull,</hi> and he came and firſt taught in the <hi>Writing-School,</hi> until the <hi>Chapel</hi> of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s <hi>Hoſpital</hi> was made into a <hi>School-houſe,</hi> and the <hi>Election-houſe</hi> was at the Eaſt-end of it, which had been the <hi>Veſtry;</hi> But Sir <hi>George Selby</hi> who was then <hi>Mayor,</hi> ſet up his Arms on the <hi>Eaſt-Window,</hi> made a <hi>Traverſe</hi> over it, and ſent to <hi>London</hi> for 24 <hi>Chairs</hi> of <hi>Muſtinie Leather,</hi> and there is the Election, tho' the Mayor lays down his Staff in the <hi>old School.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>NEXT to St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, on the ſame Side of this Street, is a very old Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, which was lately the Dwelling-houſe of Sir <hi>Robert Shaftoe,</hi> K<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. <hi>Recorder of this Town,</hi> now the Property and Dwelling-houſe of Mr. <hi>Charles Clark,</hi> Jun<hi rend="sup">r</hi>. It has the Magnificence and Grandure of Antiquity in it's Looks, but what it has been formerly I could never find out. <hi>Grey</hi> tells us, That in this Street the Earl of <hi>Weſtmoreland</hi> had his Houſe, which indeed is true. It was built by the Baron of <hi>Bywell</hi> and <hi>Bolbeck,</hi> about the 9th of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third. Much about the ſame Time he built a Houſe within the Bounds of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> for the Defence of it, as may be ſeen in our Account of the <hi>Caſtle.</hi> This Houſe in <hi>Weſtgate</hi> was called <hi>Bolbeck-Hall;</hi> but afterwards, upon it's Founder's being created <hi>Earl,</hi> which was in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, in the Year 1398, when <hi>Ralph Nevil,</hi> Lord of <hi>Raby</hi> was created <hi>Earl Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall,</hi> it got the Name of <hi>Weſtmoreland-Place</hi> in <hi>Weſgate.</hi> Some have conje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctured, that Sir <hi>Robert Shafto</hi>'s Houſe, above-mentioned, was part of it, and
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0583000100:47"/>
indeed it looks much liker a Part of ſuch a Building,<note place="margin">E. Weſtmor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<hi>'s houſe.</hi>
                     </note> than any other Thing remaining thereabouts. I am ſure much more ſo than the Houſe which is ſuppoſed to have been it, which I am told was the Houſe oppoſite to the Weſt End of <hi>Denton-Chair,</hi> which the Rev. Mr. <hi>Cowling</hi> lately lived in, and which belongs to Mr. <hi>Ord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HOWEVER, be this as it will, whether it was this Houſe now mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or whether <hi>Weſtmoreland-Place</hi> reached from this Houſe to Sir <hi>Robert Shafto</hi>'s, including it, which ſome have conjectured; yet this is certain, that it muſt have been hereabouts: for <hi>Nevil Tower</hi> is directly behind this Piece of Ground we are ſpeaking of, which is a ſure Token this muſt be the very Place, becauſe, whoever in the Town built a Tower at their own Expence, it was generally nigh them for their own Security. Thus the <hi>White-Fryers;</hi> the Brethren of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Hoſpital; the Brethren of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> &amp;c. Built their Towers over againſt their <hi>Monaſteries,</hi> for their own Safe-guard and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. But what I think puts it out of Diſpute, that Sir <hi>Robert Shafto</hi>'s Houſe was no Part of it, is that in the Eleventh of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> upon the Attainder of <hi>Charles,</hi> Earl of <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> this Houſe where Mr. <hi>Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> lived, was in Charge, which the other never was, before the Auditors; and in the Third of <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, was ſold to the Citizens of <hi>London.</hi>

                  <p>ON the Eaſt-Side of this Street, is a Street facing the Weſt-ſide of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> called <hi>Bailiff Gate,</hi> which is ſaid to have got it's Name from the Coming of the <hi>Fellons,</hi> of the County of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> along that Street at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the County Bailiffs. They came, as is ſaid, to the <hi>Weſtgate,</hi> then down an old Way, cloſe by the Out-ſide of the <hi>Town-Wall,</hi> and ſo in at the <hi>White-Fryer Gate,</hi> from whence they went along <hi>Bailiff Gate,</hi> and ſo were conveyed in at the <hi>Poſtern-Gate,</hi> on the Weſt-Side of the <hi>Caſtle,</hi> oppoſite to this Street of <hi>Bailiff Gate.</hi> This is only Traditional, and has been therefore deny'd by the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle. Grey</hi>'s Account is, That at this Gate the Priſoners were brought in, who were taken in Times of Hoſtility with <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and carry'd from thence privately into the Caſtle, where the Goal for the County is now.</p>
                  <p>THE ſame Author alſo tells us, that this Street of <hi>Bailiff Gate,</hi> formerly belonged to the <hi>Caſtle</hi> and County of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> But I imagine, had this been true, the <hi>King</hi> would long ago have had his Right. The Town of

                  <p>IN the Year 1649, the Year after the King was beheaded, there was a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey taken of <hi>Bailiff Gate,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>IN the Year following, <hi>April</hi> 25th, 1650, an Order was ſent down for an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulling and vacating the Survey made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was as follows;</p>

               <p>IT is probable that hereabouts was the ancient <hi>Monkche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> where the <hi>Monks</hi> and religious Men inhabited.

                  <hi>late ingenious Author.</hi> He ſays there muſt have been a <hi>Station in this Town,</hi> for theſe Reaſons: If we conſider the Importance of this Place, it's Diſtance from the firſt Station at the End of the Wall, and the Turns the Wall makes, (eſpecially at the Eaſt Side of the Town) in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to it's paſſing through the Heart of it; we can ſcarce Queſtion but there has been a Station here: And it's old Name of <hi>Monk-Cheſter</hi> ſeems to put it out of Doubt. The former Part of the Name is taken from the Settlement of the <hi>Monks</hi> in this Place, and the latter Part from the Word <hi>Caſtra,</hi> which is a pretty ſure Mark of a Station: Beſides the Name <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> (given firſt
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0583000100:51"/>
to the Caſtle it ſelf, and then to the Town) has been thought to imply (as in other Inſtances) that there was an old <note n="y" place="margin">Vid. Chap. <hi>of the</hi> Caſtle.</note> Caſtle or Fort there before, and near the Place where the <hi>new One</hi> was erected. And as this <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> was built by <hi>Robert,</hi> Son of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, the <hi>old Caſtle</hi> muſt have been undoubtedly <hi>Roman.</hi> And ſome Years ago, a Coin of <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> was found near the Caſtle, as I was told by the Perſon himfelf that found it.</p>
               <p>THE ſame learned Author goes on thus: The next Thing is to determine the Boundaries and Situation of this Station, which I perſuade my ſelf may be done. I hinted before that there was a Traditionary Account of the Walls paſſing through St. <hi>George</hi>'s Porch, near the North Weſt Corner of St. <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> Church. But it is certain that the Line of the Wall lies a little to the North of this End of the Church, and I think has not touched this Porch, tho' it comes near it. And therefore I conjecture, that the Wall which has paſſed through this Porch, muſt have been the Eaſt Rampart of the Station; for the Suppoſition will reconcile theſe ſeemingly differing Accounts: And if a Line be erected Perpendicular to that of <hi>Severius</hi>'s Wall, ſo as to paſs thro' that Porch, and be continued along the Brow of the Hill, at the Head of the Side, 'till it meet the Line of <hi>Hadrian</hi>'s <hi>Vallum,</hi> near the Eaſt End of <hi>Balygate,</hi> and not far from the Caſtle. This Line ſeems to anſwer ſo well in Reſpects, that I cannot much Doubt it's having been the Eaſtern Limits of the ancient Station: For this brings the Station near to the Caſtle, which probably has been built a little more to the South Eaſt, in order to bring it nearer to the Top of a Steep Hill. And fixing the Eaſtern Boundary of the Station here, leaves a Plain and Level Area for the Station it ſelf, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it, a Deſcent towards the South and the River, for the Town to ſtand upon, which might extend it ſelf to the Bridge, ſuppoſing the ancient Bridge to be near the ſame Place where the preſent one ſtands: From which Bridge the ancient Town and Station might probably take the Name of <hi>Pons-Aelii</hi> This Eaſtern Boundary of the Station muſt at that Time have been near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the River, than it is now now; ſince 'tis certain, that the River formerly flowed farther up towards this Part of the Town. The Poſition of the Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Rampart of the Station being thus determined, the other Boundaries may be alſo defined; for the Diſtance here between the Lines of the Walls ſeems to be about ſix Chains; and it is not much to be queſtioned, but the two Walls here, (as in other Caſes they frequently did) have fallen in with the Northern and Southern Ramparts of the Station; ſo that theſe ſix Chains have been the Breadth of the Station. And if we ſuppoſe the Station to have been of a middle Size, we muſt make it a Square, and allow ſix Chains for the length of it. If at this Diſtance another Line be drawn equal and Parallel to the former, and between the Lines of the Wall, it will be the Weſtern Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of the Station, as the two reſpective Parts of the two Walls make the Northern and Southern Limits. And upon this Suppoſition, a Line drawn from the Foot of the <hi>Fleſh-market</hi> to <hi>Baily-gate,</hi> near the eaſt End of it, will be the Eaſtern Limits of the ancient Station. That Part of the <hi>Vallum</hi> which reaches from <hi>Baily-gate</hi> to Mr. <hi>Ord</hi>'s Houſe, will be the Southern Limit; and a Line drawn from hence, to that Part of the Line of <hi>Severus</hi>'s Wall, which is about thirty Yards Eaſt from the End of <hi>Roſemary-lane,</hi> muſt be the We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Boundary, and the Part of <hi>Severus</hi>'s Wall included between this and the Foot of the <hi>Fleſh-market,</hi> remains for the Line of the Northern Rampart.</p>

                  <p>
                     <note n="a" place="margin">De Reb. Novocaſt'.</note>IT is ſuppoſed to have been built by one of the Kings of <hi>Scotland. David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> is mention'd in particular as it's Founder; but for what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon I know not. Indeed, that <hi>David,</hi> who dy'd in the Year 1153, was a great Benefactor to <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Religious Houſes,</hi> and he is ſaid in particular to have founded in this Town <note n="b" place="margin">Collier Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſ.</note> two <hi>Religious Houſes,</hi> but there is not a Word of his being the Founder of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s, which in all Probability would as ſoon have been taken Notice of, and handed down to Poſterity, had it been true; as the Building of two <hi>Religious Houſes.</hi> But beſides, if St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s be the oldeſt Church in this Town, and this I think ought to be allowed for the Reaſons already given, as alſo from the conſtant Tradition of it's being ſo, then it is undoubtedly older than St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s, and if ſo, it muſt have been built before the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt; for St. <hi>Nicholas</hi>'s was built in that Reign, at lateſt; and therefore it will follow, that this Church of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s was built before <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> was born.</p>
                  <p>I am therefore rather inclinable to believe, that it was founded by the <hi>Town's People,</hi> and the <hi>Religious Houſes,</hi> which at that Time of Day were chiefly in thoſe higher Parts of the Town.</p>
                  <p>THERE were three <hi>Chanteries</hi> belonging to this Church; one of which was dedicated to our <hi>Lady,</hi> which was of the Yearly Value of 6 <hi>l.</hi> 12 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d.</hi> No Deed of Foundation is ſhewed, but however it muſt at leaſt have been founded in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt; for in the latter End of that Reign, in a Charter which one <hi>Roger Amyas</hi> granted to one <hi>Stephen</hi>—, it is order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that he ſhall have ſuch a particular <hi>Booth</hi> for the Term of 30 Years: Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he pay ſo much to the <hi>Tyne Bridge,</hi> and to the <hi>Altar</hi> of St. <hi>Mary</hi> in the <hi>Church</hi> of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s in <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT had a Houſe of <hi>Seven Shillings</hi> per Annum belonging to it; it abutted on the North, next to the <hi>New-gate</hi> and on the Eaſt on the <hi>High-ſtreet,</hi> on the Weſt on St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Church-yard, and on the South on a Tenement, which in the Nineteenth Year of the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> belonged to <hi>Robert Hallyman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THERE belonged alſo to this <hi>Chantery</hi> a Houſe, and a Rig lying in the Croft, value 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <p>I Had the Curioſity lately to ſearch among the Old Writings in your Veſtry, for that famous <hi>Indulgence,</hi> which is ſaid to have been <note n="c" place="margin">Vid. Grey. p. 12.</note> granted to your Church by the Pope for <hi>Nine thouſand Years to come;</hi> but found no ſuch Thing.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0583000100:53"/>THERE is however another Indulgence which diſcovers a Piece of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, relating to your Church, which I chuſed to acquaint you with in this Manner, that the ancient Name of a Part of your Church, now worn out of the Memories of our <hi>Towns-men,</hi> and almoſt intirely loſt, might again be brought to light.</p>
                        <p>THIS Indulgence was granted in the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, in the Year 1392, an Age in which Indulgencies were common, and when they were of Particular Service towards the Building or repairing of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. For at that Time of Day, when the Building, or repairing, or adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Church was requiſite, an Indulgence was granted for ſuch a Term of Years or Days, to all ſuch as would be aſſiſting in the Things aforeſaid; by which Means many Churches have been built, repair'd and beautified, and accordingly this Indulgence of yours was granted partly for the ſame End, that the Church of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s might be kept in ſufficient Repair: For it promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes an Indulgence or Pardon for <note n="d" place="margin">Qui ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parationem, ſeu orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentum ſive emendatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae Sancti Andreae vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lae Novoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtri ſuper Tynam, lin. 5<hi rend="sup">0</hi> Indul. — Quadraginta dies Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentiae con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedimus.</note> 40 Days to every one, who ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute towards the repairing or beautifying of the Church of St. <hi>Andrews</hi> in <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne;</hi> and then follows the Antiquity deſign'd.</p>
                        <p>THAT whoever <note n="e" place="margin">Ac Capellae Sanctae Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis in parte Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonari ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiae aurum argentum, &amp;c. Lin. 6<hi rend="sup">0</hi> Indulg'.</note> offers or ſends, or Cauſes to be ſent to the <hi>Chapel of the Holy Trinity in the Northern Part of the ſame Church,</hi> either Gold, Silver, Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Books, Chalices, or any other Ornaments, which are wanting to the aforeſaid <hi>Chapel,</hi> or <hi>Altar,</hi> or Image of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> which is in the ſame Chapel. — Or who ſhall fall down upon their Knees before the <hi>Image</hi> of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> aforeſaid, and pray for the Health of Sir <hi>Adam de Athol,</hi> Kn<hi rend="sup">t</hi> as long as he lives, and for his Soul after his Deceaſe, and for the Soul of the Lady <hi>Mary</hi> his Wife, whoſe Body lies buried in the ſame <hi>Chapel</hi> of the <hi>Holy Trinity,</hi> ſhall, as often as they perform thoſe Things, or any of the Things before-mention'd, have the Benefit of a <hi>Forty Days Indulgence.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>NOW from this it is obſervable, that that waſte Place in the <hi>Northern Iſle,</hi> which opens into the Quire muſt be the <hi>Chapel</hi> here ſpoken of. For there lies the Body of Sir <hi>Adam</hi>'s <hi>Wife,</hi> which is ſaid in the Indulgence to be buried in the <note n="f" place="margin">Et pro Anima Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minae Mariae ſponſae ſuae cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus Corpus in eadem Capel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la ſanctae Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitatis Quteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit. <hi>Lin. 9.

                           </note> 
                           <hi>Chapel of the Holy Trinity;</hi> as alſo the Body of Sir <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf. The Building itſelf is after the Manner of Chapels, which were added to pariſh Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and it is ſtill obſervable, that at the Top of the North Window in the Chapel there ſeems to be a Picture of the Holy Trinity, repreſented according to the Superſtition of theſe Times by the face of <hi>an old Man, our Saviour upon the Croſs,</hi> and the Figure of a <hi>Dove;</hi> it having been always Cuſtomary in theſe Times, not only to have the <hi>Image of the Saint</hi> ſet up to whom the Church was dedicated, but alſo to adorn the Windows with it.</p>
                        <p>I am of Opinion, that Sir <hi>Adam de Athol</hi> himſelf was the Founder of this Chapel, and my Reaſons for it are theſe,</p>
                        <p n="1">1ſt, It was cuſtomary formerly for People of better Figure, to build a ſmall Chapel, at a convenient Part of their pariſh Church, that they might have a convenient Place to Worſhip God in, or that it might be a burial Place for them and their Families. Now it is evident, that this Chapel of the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> is ſuch a one. For if you ſuppoſe the Chapel away, the Church it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will appear exactly uniform; which ſhews the <hi>Chapel</hi> has been added to the Church; and as Sir <hi>Adam</hi> and his <hi>Lady</hi> are buried in it, is pretty clear that They were the Founders. It may alſo be preſumed, that <hi>He</hi> built it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeems to have been built when Sir <hi>Adam</hi> liv'd: For it is ſaid in the Indulgence to want Books, Chalices, Veſtments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which implies it, at that Time, to have been <hi>a new Chapel.</hi> And beſides, Indulgences were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted towards the adorning of Churches or Chapels, immediately after they were built. This Chapel was therefore built a little before the granting of this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, which was when Sir <hi>Adam</hi> was living. And as his Wife was then
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0583000100:54"/>
dead and buried in this Chapel; ſo ſhe ſeems to have been the firſt that was buried in it, and conſequently her Husband muſt have built it.</p>
                        <p>BUT my laſt Reaſon, I think, makes it amount to a Demonſtration. It may be obſerved in all Indulgences of this Kind, that it was not only requir'd of the People to offer Church Ornaments, but alſo to put up Prayers for the Founder. Thus for Inſtance; in an Indulgence granted in the Reign of King <hi>Henry the Eighth</hi> for the Repairing and Maintaining of the Church and Convent at <hi>Kirby Belers</hi> in the County of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> it was not only required that Money ſhould be given, but that they ſhould alſo ſay a <note n="g" place="margin">Stavely <hi>Ch. Hiſt.</hi> pa. 100.</note> 
                           <hi>Pater Noſter</hi> with an <hi>Ave</hi> for the Souls of Sir <hi>Roger Beler</hi> and <hi>Alyce</hi> his Wife, Founder and Foundreſs.</p>
                        <p>NOW from hence it is plain, that Sir <hi>Adam</hi> and his <hi>Lady</hi> muſt have been the Founder and Foundreſs of this Chapel, becauſe they alone are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in this Indulgence, and Prayers were to be put up for them, as they were for Sir <hi>Roger</hi> and his Lady juſt now mentioned.</p>
                        <p>THUS I think I have found out the ancient Name of your Chapel, and who was the Founder it. It may perhaps be ſomewhat Satisfactory to thoſe who are curious in thoſe Things, may retrieve the antient Name of your Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and eſtabliſh the deſerved Remembrance of it's Founder. But be this as it will; as I have only theſe Things in View in making theſe Obſervations; ſo I hope you'll be ſo good as to accept of them, and allow them a Place a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Parchments of your Church.</p>

                  <p>THE Indulgence on which theſe Obſervations are founded are granted by <hi>Oſwald,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Candida caſa,</hi> which is in <hi>Gallaway</hi> in <hi>Scotland;</hi> it is dated at <hi>York</hi> 1392, the 12th Year of his Conſecration.</p>
                  <p>THE 3d <hi>Chantery</hi> belonging to this Church was dedicated to St. <hi>Thomas.</hi> This I learn from an Account I have met with of a Houſe in this Street, which is ſaid to have belonged to the <hi>Chantery</hi> of St. <hi>Thomas,</hi> in the Church of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>IT bounder'd on the Weſt by St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Church end, and on the North by a <hi>Houſe,</hi> which in the Reign of Q. <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was in the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Richard Atkinſon,</hi> and on the Eaſt by the <hi>High-ſtreet,</hi> and on the South againſt the <hi>Church-Style.</hi> It was valued at ten Shillings per Annum.</p>
                  <p>THAT there was ſuch a Chantery in St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s (notwithſtanding the two former are ſuppoſed to be all belonging to this Church) is further evident, becauſe I meet alſo with an Account which ſays, that the Chantery of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> in St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s, had an Orchard belonging to it, which paid a yearly Rent of Three Shillings and Four Pence to it; but where it ſtood is not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. It was occupied by Sir <hi>Robert Brandlin.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THAT there were Lands belonging to the Chantery of St. <hi>Mary</hi> in this Church, which were ſituated in this Street, is certain. But where to fix them at this Time of Day is pretty Difficult. But wherever they were ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0583000100:55"/>
there was an Houſe ſituated near them, which paid to the <hi>Priory</hi> of <hi>Hex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> Six Shillings per Annum.</p>
                  <p>THIS is mention'd when <hi>Rowland</hi> was Prior, in the Year 1490, in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th.<note n="h" place="margin">De Reb. Novocaſt'.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>I meet with no account of the Lands belonging to the Chantery of the <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> except that of an Houſe, ſituated in a Place called <hi>le Cow-garth</hi> in this <hi>Newgate-ſtreet,</hi> which paid one Shilling per Annum to this Chantery, and a Tenement in <hi>Weſtgate</hi> which paid 4 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Altar of this Church is very pretty and decent, it was beautified a few Years ago at the Charge of the Pariſh.</p>
                  <p>THERE is at the <hi>Weſt-end</hi> of this Church a <hi>Beautiful</hi> Gallery, which was built in the Year 1711, at the Charge of the Pariſh. In the Year 1726, the <hi>Old Porch</hi> was taken down, and the preſent one built,

                  <p>ON the Eaſt-ſide of this Street, near the <hi>New-gate,</hi> is a Tenement which was given by Mrs. <hi>Alice Belayſys</hi> to <hi>Univerſity-College</hi> in <hi>Oxford.</hi> The Site of it is thus deſcrib'd; <hi>Situatum eſt infra praedictam villam juxta Novam Portam ejuſdem villae in quo quidem Tenement'</hi> Thomas Gray Lidſter <hi>modo inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitat, (viz.)

                  </p>
                  <p>OPPOSITE to St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Church is a Lane, which leads to <hi>Pilgrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet</hi> Gate, called the <hi>High-fryer-chare,</hi> becauſe of a Fryer which was in it, and becauſe it is higher up in the Town than the other Fryer Chare.</p>
                  <p>IN coming down this Street Southward from the Church of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s, on the Right-hand, is an ancient Street called <hi>Darn-crook;</hi> in which Street were ſome Waſtes and Houſe belonging to the Nuns of St. <hi>Bartholomew,</hi> as there were in almoſt every Street in the Town. Oppoſite to this Place, on the Eaſt-ſide of this Street of <hi>Newgate</hi> is a little running Water which goes into <hi>Lorkburne.</hi> This little <hi>Bourn</hi> is taken Notice of in the Account of the Ward belonging to <hi>Ficket-Tower,</hi> and is called there, <hi>a Bourn beſide Lam-place, that runneth towards Lorkburne.</hi> To this Bourn it is, that the Priſoners belonging to <hi>Newgate,</hi> have Liberty to walk during the Time they are not confin'd to the Goal.</p>
                  <p>FROM thence, going ſtill Southward, the Street changes it's Name from <hi>Newgate</hi> to <hi>Huxter</hi>'s <hi>-Booths;</hi> for thereabouts it was that the <hi>Huxters</hi> lived, as has been obſerved above, who ſupply'd the <hi>Religious-houſes,</hi> and the other Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of this Part of the Town with Proviſions. A Part of theſe Houſes are ſtill to be ſeen, they ſtand by themſelves almoſt in the <hi>middle of the Street,</hi> nigh the <hi>White-croſs. Grey</hi> ſays, That this Part of the Town was in his Time called the <hi>Huxters-Booths;</hi> that is, as I underſtand him, from the <hi>Bourn</hi> above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, to thoſe Houſes.</p>
                  <p>OPPOSITE to the <hi>Booths</hi> was a great Gate that led into the <hi>Black-fryers.</hi> It was ſituated between the Houſe of <hi>William Wilkinſon,</hi> Smith, and the Houſe of <hi>Elizabeth Bell,</hi> Widow. The Place now is the Entrance of a Garden be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to Mr. <hi>Nicholas Baily</hi> of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> This I think is evident from a Grant of a Tenement from the <hi>Black-fryers,</hi> now in the Hands of Mr. <hi>Tho. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall,</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0583000100:59"/>
of this Town; wherein in deſcribing the Situation of the Tenement, are theſe Words; <hi>Sicut jacet in villa antedicta prope crucem vulgariter vocatam</hi> Whytt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs <hi>inter magnam portam praedictorum Fratrum e Regione praedictae crucis ex parte Boreali,</hi> &amp;c. The Tenement deſcribed is the Houſe lately rebuilt by Mr. <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall</hi> aforeſaid. Since this Conjecture from the Writing above-mentioned, I have met with the Manuſcript of Mr. <hi>Milbank,</hi> which very much corroborates it. The Words are theſe; the Gate-way to this Houſe was from the White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſs, and was called when our Author liv'd, <hi>Wind</hi>'s <hi>-hole.</hi> The way was a narrow Lane to the Fryery, which in his Time was joining to Mr. <hi>Brandling</hi>'s Ground, whereupon there was, (and ſtill is) a Mill.</p>
                  <p>THE Buſineſs and Trade of this upper Part of the Street, is chiefly that of the <hi>Tanners.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0583000100:61"/>AND it's ſaid in <hi>Leland,</hi> that the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Mary</hi> in <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne</hi> was given to the Uſe of <hi>theſe Nuns.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lel. Vol. 1. p. 41.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT appears alſo from the Charter juſt above-mentioned, that among the other Things confirmed to this <hi>Hoſpital,</hi> the Church of St. <hi>Bartholomew</hi> was one. I may be ask'd therefore where this Church was Situated. In anſwer to this I dare venture to ſay, that there never was any ſuch Church in this Town; I mean a Pariſh Church: And therefore it muſt have been the Church or <hi>Chapel</hi> belonging to this Hoſpital; and conſequently muſt have been ſeated where the Hoſpital was. And this appears to be the rather true, becauſe we have no other mention made of their <hi>Chapel,</hi> and becauſe when it is mention'd in the Charter it is ſaid to be given them, that they may ſerve God in it.</p>
                  <p>IN the Year 1355, <hi>Thomas Hatfield,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> confirmed to the Nuns of this Houſe, the Abbeſs they had elected; her Name was <hi>Alice Davill.</hi> She had been not duly elected, and therefore he made the Election void; but however, as ſhe was a Perſon the <hi>Convent</hi> very much approv'd of, the Biſhop of his ſpecial Favour order'd her to preſide over them.</p>
                  <p>THIS was granted at <hi>Aukland, May</hi> the 9th, in the Tenth Year of his Conſecration.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING now got as far as the End of the broad Part of this Street, we have the Breadth of it divided into <hi>Three Streets.</hi> The firſt <hi>Street,</hi> or that on the Right Hand, is called the <hi>Meal-market,</hi> the <hi>Oatmeal-market,</hi> or <hi>Groat-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> becauſe of the <hi>Oatmeal,</hi> which is ſold there every Day of the Week, but more eſpecially on the <hi>Saturday</hi>'s. What Name it had formerly, or whether it ever had any other, I cannot ſay; but this is certain, that it has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained it's preſent Name above <hi>two hundred Years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AT the Upper-end of this Street, or the North-end of it, is the <hi>Poſt-houſe</hi> of this Town, which is adorned with a pretty <hi>Area</hi> of a <hi>Quadrangular Figure,</hi> together with a good Garden: It belongs to Mr. <hi>James Bell,</hi> the preſent Poſt-Maſter.</p>
               <p>AS you deſcend from this End of the Street, you turn the Corner of this Houſe upon the Right Hand, into a Lane called the <hi>Pudding-chare,</hi> or as I have ſeen it in ſome ancient Writings <hi>Budding-chare,</hi> which leads into <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi> There were three Houſes in this Lane which paid an Annual Rent to the Chantry of the <hi>Holy Trinity</hi> in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church; one paid 20 <hi>d. per Ann.</hi> another 2 <hi>d.</hi> and the third 4 <hi>d.</hi> The Lane called <hi>Roſemary-lane,</hi> which turns upon the Right Hand as you go down this Chare into <hi>Weſtgate,</hi> was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called St. <hi>John</hi>'s <hi>Chare;</hi> becauſe it led from the <hi>Pudding-chare</hi> to St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church.</p>
               <p>IN this Lane there is a <hi>Waſte,</hi> which belong'd to the Nuns of St. <hi>Bartholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mew,</hi> boundering on the Weſt on the Common Gutter, and on the North on the Chantery Lands.</p>
               <p>THIS Waſte is the Ground where are now the Gardens of Mr. <hi>James Bell,</hi> Poſt-maſter, and the old Houſes on the North of theſe Gardens, now the Property of Mr. <hi>Ralph Trotter,</hi> are the <hi>Chantery Lands</hi> here mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0583000100:64"/>OVER againſt the South-end of this Lane, which ſo leads to St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church, is an ancient Alms-houſe, in which live ſeven poor People, who have a ſmall Allowance at Chriſtmas from the Town.</p>
               <p>HAVING paſt the Eaſt-end of the <hi>Pudding-chare,</hi> we go Southward, which leads into the Body of the <hi>Meal-market,</hi> aforeſaid.</p>
               <p>THERE is little in this Street worth taking Notice of; the Houſes ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are very ancient and mean, the few good ones are one which was built the laſt Year by Mr. <hi>Prior</hi> of this Town, Cooper, an ancient Inhabitant in this Street; and another the Houſe below it, which belongs to Mr. <hi>William Harriſon,</hi> Dyer, which was formerly the Dwelling-houſe of <hi>Timothy Robſon,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Alderman of this Town, and ſometime Mayor; and ſome few others.</p>
               <p>IN the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> a Houſe in this Street belonging to one <hi>William Penrith,</hi> whoſe Site is now loſt, paid an annual Rent to the Chante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Lady in the Pariſh Church of <hi>Long-benton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Rom. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tann. p. 132.</note>THE late Mr. <hi>Horſely</hi> tells us of another Houſe in this Street, in the laying of the Foundation of which, about 15 or 16 Years ſince, the Maſons ſtruck upon the Roman Wall at each of the Side Walls, ſo that the Building ſtands croſs the Roman Wall. But where the Site of it is he does not ſay.</p>
               <p>TOWARDS the lower end of this Street is a large open, where is a <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> every Saturday for <hi>Wool,</hi> below this again a Lane leading into <hi>Weſtgate,</hi> called <hi>Denton-chare.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>PASSING by the Eaſt-end of this Chare, we come to the ancient <hi>Iron-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,</hi> which was oppoſite to St. <hi>Nicholas Church,</hi> in that Piece of Ground lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Side, from the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Charles Clark,</hi> and from below the Shop of the late Mr. <hi>John Kellot,</hi> Smith.</p>
               <p>ANOTHER Street which the broad Street of the <hi>Big-market</hi> is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to is the <hi>Middle-ſtreet,</hi> ſo called becauſe it ſtands in the Middle of the Streets in this Part of the Town; for it has on the Eaſt-ſide of it the <hi>Fleſh-market</hi> and <hi>Pilgrim-ſtreet,</hi> and on the Weſt, the <hi>Oatmeal-Market,</hi> and <hi>Weſtgate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS Street bore anciently three Names, the upper Part of it was called <hi>Skinner-gate,</hi> the lower Part of it <hi>Spurrier-gate</hi> and <hi>Sadler-gate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT is a Street as it was in <hi>Grey</hi>'s Time, where all Sorts of Artificers have Shops and Houſes.</p>
               <p>WE come now to the 3d Street, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>Fleſh-market,</hi> at the upper-end of which is the <hi>Upper-dean-bridge,</hi> ſo called becauſe of the two Bridges which croſs this Dean or Rivulet, which runs into <hi>Lorkburne,</hi> this is that which is the higher or upper one.</p>
               <p>HAVING paſſed by the Weſt-end of this Bridge we go Southward into the <hi>Fleſh-market.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>GREY</hi> tells us, <q>that when the Good-men of this Town began to trade and venture beyond the Seas, they built many Ships, and procured a Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to carry Fells beyond Seas, and to bring in foreign Commodities. The Staple was then at <hi>Antwerp</hi> in <hi>Brabant,</hi> called <hi>Commune totius Europae Emporium.</hi> The <hi>Charter</hi> of the <hi>Merchant Adventurers</hi> was the firſt Charter that was granted by any King to any Town.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>AFTER this Grant this Town flouriſhed in trading, built many fair Houſes in the <hi>Fleſh-market,</hi> then called <hi>Cloth-market.</hi> The Merchants had
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0583000100:65"/>
their Shops and Ware-houſes there, in the Back-parts of their Houſes: The River of <hi>Tyne</hi> flowed and ebbed, where Boats came up with Commodities; which Trade of Merchandizes continued many Years.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>IN this Street the Mayors, Aldermen, and richeſt Men of the Town lived.</q>
               </p>
               <p>PART of the preſent <hi>Fleſh-market</hi> was called the <hi>Cloth-market,</hi> and part of it the <hi>Fleſh-market</hi> and <hi>Fiſh-market.</hi> An Anonymous Authority ſays, that in <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim-ſtreet</hi> was the Market for <hi>Fiſh,</hi> that came up to the <hi>Nether-dean-bridge.</hi> But this in my Opinion is a Miſtake. For in the Ward belonging to <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den-Tower,</hi> part of it is over the <hi>Fleſh-ſhambles</hi> from the North Weſt Church Stile of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> unto the <hi>Fiſh-ſhambles.</hi> Conſequently the <hi>Fiſh</hi> that came up to the <hi>Nether-dean-bridge</hi> muſt have been ſold in the <hi>Fleſh-market,</hi> not in <hi>Pilgrim-ſtreet.</hi> The Shops of this Street are at preſent the Shops of Artificers, and the Houſes either chiefly Coffee-houſes or Taverns, or Ale-houſes.</p>
               <p>IN ſome ancient Writings belonging to that worthy Gentleman <hi>The Rev. Mr.</hi> Smith <hi>of</hi> Melſonby, I find that ſeveral Houſes in this Street paid an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Rent to <hi>Univerſity College</hi> in <hi>Oxford;</hi> one of them in particular nigh the Church Yard paid 6 <hi>s.</hi> in the Year 1304, and ſo did many Houſes in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Streets of this Town to the ſame <hi>College.</hi> Several of theſe were the Gift of the Lady <hi>Ann Bellaſys</hi> to this College, <hi>An.</hi> 1444.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Fleſh-market</hi> in this Street, which is held every Saturday, is a very great Market, not only as it ſupplies the Town in a great Meaſure, but as it alſo furniſhes the Country for ſeveral Miles round. Beſides there are ſeveral Thouſands of People belonging to the <hi>Coal-Works,</hi> ſuch as <hi>Staith-Men, Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goners, Pit-Men, Wrights, Keel-Men,</hi> &amp;c. all which for the moſt part have their Proviſions from this Market.</p>
               <p>THE Proviſion alſo for <hi>Ships,</hi> is got from this Market. And this indeed muſt be very conſiderable, when there will be ſometimes 3 or 4 hundred Sail in at a Time.</p>
               <p>THERE are 2 <hi>Fairs</hi> kept in this Market every Year for 8 Days together, the one begins upon <hi>Lammas</hi> Day, or the Firſt of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> which <hi>Grey</hi> calls <hi>a remarkable Time of the Year,</hi> but why he calls it ſo, he gives no Account. This Fair is in ſome Meaſure of an ancient ſtanding. For we meet with ſome Account of it in the Reign of King <hi>John,</hi> mentioned in a Charter of another of our Kings. The Words are theſe, <hi>Inſuper cum Dicti Burgenſes per Chartam praefati Joannis Regis habeant in dicto Burgo unam feriam ſingulis annis per duos dies duraturam,</hi> viz. <hi>in vigilia &amp; in die Sancti Petri ad Vincula, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NOW from this it appears that King <hi>John</hi> granted to the Town of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle, Lammas</hi> Fair, which he order'd ſhould be held on the Eve of St. <hi>Peter ad Vincula,</hi> and upon the Day it ſelf. <note n="r" place="margin">Blount in Verb.</note> I ſuppoſe <hi>Grey</hi> calls it a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Time of the Year, as well becauſe it is called <hi>Lammas</hi> Day as becauſe it is called St. <hi>Peter advincula.</hi> As it is <hi>Lammas</hi> Day, it is a remarkable Time of the Year, for it is called <hi>Lambmas</hi> becauſe <hi>Lambs</hi> were not then fit to eat, they were grown too big: <hi>aliter</hi> from the <hi>Sax.</hi> III <hi>asmaesse <hi>q. d. Loaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi>
                  </hi> becauſe on that Day the Engliſh made an Offering of Bread made with <hi>new Wheat.</hi> On this Day it was, that Tenants that held Lands of the Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral Church of <hi>York</hi> (which is dedicated to St. <hi>Peter ad Vincula</hi>) were bound by their Tenure to bring a <hi>Live Lamb</hi> into the Church at <hi>High-maſs</hi> on that Day.</p>
               <p>IT is alſo a remarkable Time, as it is St. <hi>Peter ad vincula,</hi> and as it is called the <hi>Gule</hi> of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> from the Latin <hi>Gula,</hi> a Throat. The Reaſon is ſet down in <hi>Durand</hi>'s <hi>Rationale</hi> (<hi>Lib.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 19.) who ſays, that one <hi>Quirinus,</hi> a <hi>Tribune,</hi> hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Daughter that had a Diſeaſe in her Throat, went to <hi>Alexander,</hi> then Pope

of <hi>Rome,</hi> the 6th from St. <hi>Peter,</hi> and deſired of him to borrow, or to ſee the <hi>Chains,</hi> that St. <hi>Peter</hi> was chained with under <hi>Nero;</hi> which being obtained, the ſaid Daughter kiſſing the Chains, was cured of her Deſeaſe, and <hi>Quirinus</hi> with his Family baptized. <hi>Tunc dictus</hi> Alexander <hi>Papa hoc Feſtum in Calendis auguſti celebrandum inſtituit, &amp; in honorem beati</hi> Petri <hi>Eccleſiam in Urbe Fabrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit, ubi vincula ipſa repoſuit, &amp; ad Vincula nominavit, &amp; in calendis auguſti dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cavit. In qua, Feſtivitate Populus illic ipſa vincula hodie Oſculatur.</hi> So that this Day being before called only the Calends of <hi>Auguſt,</hi> was upon this Occaſion termed indifferently either St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Day <hi>ad Vincula,</hi> from the Inſtrument that wrought the Miracle; or the Gule of <hi>Auguſt</hi> from that Part of the Virgin whereon the Miracle was wrought. <hi>Blount in verb.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER this Fair granted by King <hi>John,</hi> it was by a ſucceeding King, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to begin at the ſame Time, and to continue 28 Days. When it was reduced to the Time above-mentioned I have not met with.</p>
               <p>THE other Fair held in this Market is at St. <hi>Lukeſmas,</hi> it was granted to the Town in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th. During the Time of theſe Fairs there is a Court of <hi>Pye-powder.</hi> All the Privileges and Power that a Court Leet can have, is granted to this Court. <hi>Grey</hi> 17.</p>
               <p>TOWARDS the South-end of this was a large <hi>Croſs,</hi> with a lead Ciſtern at the Top of it to hold the Water, called the <hi>New-water;</hi> which was pulled down about 3 Years ago. Beyond this, at the End of this Street is the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diners Meeting-houſe.</hi>

               <p>THE <hi>Steeple</hi> of this Church is in Height 64 Yards, one Foot, three Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.

'Tis ſaid that <hi>Ben Johnſon,</hi> the Poet, made the following Lines upon it.</p>

               <p>IT is ſaid, and indeed confeſſed, that <hi>Robert Rhodes</hi> was more probably the Builder of this <hi>Steeple</hi> than any other Perſon: His Name being at the Bottom of the <hi>Belſry.</hi>
               </p>
               <q>Orate pro anima <hi>Roberti Rhodes.</hi>
               </q>
               <p>BUT who this <hi>Robert Rhodes</hi> was, is more uncertain. <hi>Grey</hi> tells us, that <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert de Rhodes</hi> was the Lord Prior of <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th Days. And an <hi>Anoymous Authority</hi> ſeems to ſuggeſt, that this <hi>Robert Rhodes</hi> was one of the Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi>'s Juſtices; becauſe in a Regiſter at <hi>Durham,</hi> there is mention made of <hi>Robert Rhodes, ab Anno</hi> 1486, <hi>ad An'</hi> 1537, and <hi>Agnes</hi> his Wife.</p>
               <p>BUT neither of theſe ſeem to me to be the true one. I am rather inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to believe, that one <hi>Robert Rhodes,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who lived in this Town in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th was the true Perſon. We meet with this Gentleman's Name in an Inquiſition that was taken at the Caſtle of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> in the 25th of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th, 1447; for two of the Gentlemen preſent were <hi>Roger Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> the Son of the famous Benefactor of that Name, and <hi>Robert Rhodes,</hi> and they were alſo firſt mentioned after the Mayor.</p>
               <p>
                  <note n="u" place="margin">Lib. de Reb. 11.</note>IN the Year 1451, we meet again with the ſame Perſon, who together with the ſaid <hi>Roger Thornton,</hi> by an Inſtrument bearing the ſame Date, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed ſome Houſes for the Uſe of a <hi>Chantery Prieſt</hi> to pray for the Soul of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0583000100:69"/>
                  <hi>William Johnſon.</hi> We have alſo a further Account of this Gentleman in the Year 1500, for an Inſtrument bearing that Date informs us, that the <hi>Mayor</hi> and Inhabitants of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> gave a Tenement to a Prieſt to live in, who was to pray for the Soul of <hi>Robert Rhodes</hi> and <hi>Agnes</hi> his Wife, at the Altar of St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt in St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>NOW when it is conſidered that this <hi>Robert Rhodes,</hi> I am ſpeaking of, was ſo great a Man in this Town, that he lived in the ſame Reign in which <hi>Grey</hi> acknowledges the <hi>Lanthorne</hi> to have been built, namely in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 6th, and that he was ſo commemorated by the <hi>Mayor</hi> and Inhabitants af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Deceaſe, I dare ſay it will appear much more probable that he was the Builder than either of the others.</p>
               <p>THERE might indeed be, and probably there was a <hi>Robert Rhodes,</hi> Prior of <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> the 6th, but I never met with any Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of the Priors of <hi>Tinmouth</hi> to the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> They were on the contrary mortal Enemies to this Place, and always jealous of it's encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Glory. As to the other <hi>Robert Rhodes,</hi> one of the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s <hi>Juſtices,</hi> he was alive in the Year 1537, which was the 29th of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, and ſo comes too late to build a Steeple in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th. I have been told by a worthy Gentleman, and one who is curious in theſe Things, that this <hi>Robert Rhodes,</hi> ſo taken Notice of by this Town, was <hi>Eſcheator.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THERE is a traditional Story of this Building I am now treating of, which may not be improper to be here taken Notice of. In the Time of the Civil Wars, when the <hi>Scots</hi> had beſieg'd the Town for ſeveral Weeks, and were ſtill as far as at firſt from taking it, the General ſent a Meſſenger to the May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or or of the Town, and demanded the Keys, and the Delivering up of the Town, or he would immediately demoliſh the <hi>Steeple</hi> of St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi> The Mayor and Aldermen upon hearing this, immediately ordered a certain Number of the chiefeſt of the Scottiſh Priſoners to be carried up to the Top of the old <hi>Tower,</hi> the Place below the <hi>Lanthorne,</hi> and there confined; after this they returned the <hi>General</hi> an Anſwer to this Purpoſe, That they would upon no Terms de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver up the Town, but would to the laſt Moment defend it: That the <hi>Steeple</hi> of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> was indeed a beautiful and magnificent Piece of Architecture, and one of the great Ornaments of their Town; but yet ſhould be blown into Attoms before ranſom'd at ſuch a Rate: That however, if it was to fall, it ſhould not fall alone; that the ſame Moment he deſtroyed the beautiful Structure, he ſhould Bath his Hands in the Blood of his Countrymen; who were placed there on Purpoſe either to preſerve it from Ruin, or to die along with it. This Meſſage had the deſired Effect. The Men were there kept Priſoners during the whole Time of the Siege, and not ſo much as one Gun fired againſt it.</p>
               <p>THERE were only five Bells originally belonging to this Church, but of late Years the Number is encreas'd to Eight. The great Bell, call'd the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Bell, was ſent to <hi>Colcheſter</hi> to be new caſt in the Year 1615, it weighed 3129 lb. They are very large ones, have a bold and noble Sound, and yet exceedingly ſweet and Harmonious. The three latter Bells were given to this Church by the <hi>Corporation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the Year 1723, <hi>William Elliſon,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Mayor, and <hi>Robert Sowersby,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Sheriff, the <hi>Steeple</hi> was repaired at the Expence of the <hi>Corporation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AT the North Door of this Church, it is obſervable, that the <hi>large Flagg</hi> which is the firſt Step into the Church, is cut all along the Surface with <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>even Lines,</hi> in Imitation of the Waves of the Sea. This is a ſilent Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancer of the <hi>Saint</hi> the Church is dedicated to; for St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Myra,</hi> who lived in the Time of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, is ſo famous among ſome for his Miracles and Apparitions by Sea, that he has merited the Title of the <hi>Patron of the Sailors.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0583000100:70"/>THERE were no fewer than 9 <hi>Chanteries</hi> belonging to this Church, which are valued at 48 <hi>l.</hi> 4 <hi>s.</hi> 6 <hi>d. per Annum.</hi>

               <p>THE Chantery of St. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and St. <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle, was on the <note n="w" place="margin">In Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia Sancti <hi>Nich.</hi> de di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cta villa No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicaſtri ad altare Bore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ale Joannis Baptiſtae &amp; Joannis A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt. &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangel. lib.

If there be any Truth in this, it is that he was a third Founder. He allowed a Prieſt 7 <hi>l.</hi> 7 <hi>s.</hi> 10 <hi>d. per Annum</hi> to pray for his Soul, and the Soul of his Wife; and the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> as it is ſaid above, out of Reſpect to his Memory, gave the Prieſt a Houſe to live in; but it's a Miſtake that this <hi>Chantery</hi> was not founded before, for <hi>Richard de Emeldon</hi> who had been above 12 Times Mayor of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> was permitted by Letters Patents from King <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, to build upon a Piece of vacant Ground, over againſt the Chapel of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Martyr, that he might preſent it to <hi>Three Chaplains,</hi> to procure their Prayers for him whilſt he was living, and after he was dead, and alſo for the Souls of his Wives and his Father and Mother, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> every Day at the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar in St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> which was dedicated to <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and <hi>John</hi> the Apoſtle and Evangeliſt. This Gentleman died about the 6th or 7th of the Reign now mentioned, as is clearly gathered from the Authority above; and the Letters in which this Chantery is mentioned bear Date the 6th of this Reign: and therefore it is a Miſtake to ſuppoſe this Chantery founded in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 6th, which was almoſt an hundred Years after.</p>
               <p>THE Prieſts ſet a-part to attend this Altar, were every Day to pray for his Soul, and the others above-mentioned; and by an Order from the Then <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> Lord Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> the Chaplains for the Time being, were obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged on the <hi>Anniverſary Day</hi> of his Death, every Year for Ever, to celebrate his Memory with a <hi>Solemn tolling of the Bells,</hi> and <hi>devoutly ſinging by Note</hi> in the <hi>Evening of the Anniverſary,</hi> and on the <hi>Anniverſary itſelf,</hi> and ſolemnly to ſing Maſs for the Soul of <hi>Richard</hi> himſelf, and the Souls above-mentioned, and the Souls of all the Faithful departed. And after Maſs, one of the Chaplains was to diſtribute among <hi>an hundred and ſixty poor People,</hi> the Sum of Six Shillings and Eight-pence, and this annually for ever. This, together with ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Things, was ordered by <hi>Richard,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> in the 3d Year of his Conſecration, <hi>Anno</hi> 1335, which was, with all other Things mentioned in the Charter, confirmed by <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, in the 10th Year of his Reign.</p>
               <p>THUS then it appears that this Chantery is of a much older Date than the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the Sixth. But this is not all; <hi>Richard de Emeldon,</hi> was but a ſecond Founder of this Chantery: It boaſts ſtill an higher Antiquity, and is ſaid to have been founded by <hi>Laurence</hi> of <hi>Durham,</hi> who was Prior of <hi>Durham</hi> in the Year 1149, which, by the way, is a further Proof of our Conjecture of this Church's being founded by King <hi>Henry</hi> the Firſt, or in that Reign at lateſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. THE Chantery of St. <hi>Catherine</hi> was founded by <hi>William Johnſon</hi> and <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſabel</hi> his Wife, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the Third; it's yearly Value was 6 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.

                     <p>IN this North Part of the Church of St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> was a Shrine of <hi>Henry</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who in the 4th of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th was Lieutenant of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and being commanded by the King to levy thoſe Monies which were then extorted from the Country to carry on the War of <hi>Britany;</hi> the Vulgar conceiving him to be the Cauſe of that Task, tumultuouſly murdered him at <hi>Cockledge,</hi> near <hi>Threske,</hi> eighteen Miles north of <hi>York,</hi> upon the Day of St. <hi>Vitalis</hi> the Martyr; whereupon he was buried at <hi>Beverley,</hi> where he hath a ſtately Monument, but much defaced. This is Shrine at preſent much more ſo, being no where to be met with; bul <hi>Grey</hi> tells us, that in this Part of the Church there was ſuch a Monument in his Time, that was made in Memory of him in his own Country; he having a Houſe in this Town and Pariſh, and that Part of the Inſcription upon it was, <hi>Orate pro anima Hemici Percy</hi> 4 <hi>Northumbriae qui per Rebbelium Manus occabuit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>THE <hi>Milbank</hi> Manuſcript ſays it was in the north Corner of the Church: That it was a Monument of Wood; on which was painted an <hi>old Man,</hi> our <hi>Saviour</hi> on his right Hand, and the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> on his Left. There came a Labil from her Mouth, but what it was this Authority had forgot; but that from our <hi>Saviour</hi>'s was <hi>Quaeſo Patri ſac, qued rog it mea Mater.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>THEN followed ſome Latin Verſes, done in the rhiming Way of the Monks, but they are ſo dark and obſcure, that little can be made of them. the Manuſcript goes on; When Mr. <hi>William Selby</hi> was buried, this Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was removed out of that Corner, and Sir <hi>George Selby</hi> did ſet his mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Tomb there. Alter that it was placed againſt the Wall, next to Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Tomb, and ſo continued 'till Mr. <hi>Lane. Hodſhon</hi> got leave of Vicar <hi>Nailor</hi> to remove it and place his Father. Where it is now I know not.</p>

                        <hi>YEILDARD Alvey,</hi> Vicar, was buried at St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> 1648, he ſucceeded in the Vicarage of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> in the Year 1630, when the moſt learned Dr. <hi>Jackſon</hi> was elected Preſident of <hi>Corpus Chriſti</hi> College, in <hi>Oxford,</hi> his Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings began very early in the Troubles,<note place="margin">Vide Ann. 1645.</note> as I find by a Letter of his, writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to his Grace the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and dated from <hi>York, Oct.</hi> 16, 1640, wherein he ſets forth what he then had ſuffer'd, in the following Manner. <hi>I am for the preſent outed of all my ſpiritual Promotions, to the yearly Value of</hi> 300 l. <hi>and have moſt of my moveable Goods ſeized upon by the Rebels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forc'd (upon ſome threatning Speeches given out by them, that they would deal more rigourouſly with me than others) ſuddenly to deſert all, and to provide for the Safety of my ſelf, Wife, and ſeven Children, by a ſpeedy Flight in the Night-time; how they would have dealt with me they have ſince made evident, by their harſh dealing with two of my Curates, whom I left to officiate for me in my Abſence; who have not only been interrupted in reading Divine Service; but threatn'd to be Piſtol'd, if they would not deſiſt from the Execution of their Office: And whereas I had lately purchaſed</hi> 60 <hi>Pounds</hi> per Annum <hi>in</hi> Northumberland, <hi>and hoped to have been ſupplied that Way in theſe calamitous Times, 'till I might with Safety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; they have, ſince I preſented my Petition to his Majeſty, ſeized upon that alſo, and commanded my Servant to be accountable to them for it: This is my Caſe at this Time.</hi> Afterwards, as might be expected, it was far worſe, for, as I am otherwiſe inform'd he was not only pull'd out of this Pulpit by two Holy Siſters, but impriſon'd at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> at <hi>Holy-Iſland,</hi> and at <hi>Norwich;</hi> his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily increas'd under his Troubles, if I miſtake not, to ten Children, (for ſo many I find his Wife bore him in all) which were reduced to great Streights, and ſubſiſted in good meaſure by Charity; I perceive by the Letter above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, that he had been active as well as paſſive in the Service of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; by both which Means he had ſo far recommended himſelf to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and Eſteem of that Prince, that he had deſign'd ſome Reward for him, which in all Probability the Rebellion prevented the King from beſtowing. Nor did Mr. <hi>Alvey</hi> live to receive it from his royal Son, on the Reſtoration, for his Death happened in the Year, 1648, and was haſtened, as 'tis thought, by his Sufferings. He was a very Honeſt Good Man, and a true Son of the Church of <hi>England;</hi> as, I am told, appears by a little Tract which he wrote, and which I have not yet been able to get a Sight of, intitled, <hi>The Humble Confeſſion and Vindication of them who ſuffer'd much, and ſtill ſuffer, under the Name of Malignants and Delinquents,</hi> Publiſh'd in 1647.</p>

The Well was always eſteemed of more Sanctity than common Wells, and therefore the Failing of the Water could be looked upon its nothing leſs than a juſt Revenge for ſo great a Prophanation. But alas! the Miracle's at an End, for the Water returned a-while ago in as great Abundance as ever.</hi>

                  <p>ON the Right-hand, as you deſcend from this Gate of <hi>Pilgrim-ſtreet,</hi> is the <hi>High-Frier-Chare,</hi> which leads into <hi>Newgate-ſtreet.</hi> There was in this Lane a <hi>Fryery,</hi> which occaſioned it's Name.</p>
                  <p>IT was ſituated ſomewhere about <hi>Ficket-Tower,</hi> which is the next round Tower to <hi>Pilgrim-gate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS appears from the Account of the Ward belonging to this Tower, a Part of which is as follows; <hi>It ſhall have to Ward,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>with all</hi> Grey-Fryer-Chare, <hi>from the</hi> Barras, <hi>oppoſite to the</hi> Ficket-Tower, <hi>and the North Kirk Door of the ſaid Fryery, Weſtward, and no farther Eaſtward in that Lane.</hi>

                     <hi>GREY</hi> in this Part of the Town ſays, that in the Upper-part of this Street is a Princely Houſe, built out of the Ruins of the Black-Fryers.</p>
                  <p>THIS is contrary to the Authority above, where it is called the <hi>Grey-Fryer-Chare.</hi>
                  </p>

                     <hi>Grey-Fryers,</hi> ſo that it is as great a Miſtake to place the <hi>Black-Fryers</hi> here, as to ſay the <hi>Grey-Fryers</hi> were placed in <hi>Weſtgate.</hi> Their Situation, according to the Authority above, muſt have been in the Garden of <hi>Walter Blacket,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> in that Part of it which is oppoſite to <hi>Ficket-Tower,</hi> and the reſt of that Garden muſt have been the Garden and other Conveniencies of this Monaſtery. This Houſe was founded by the Family of the <hi>Carliols,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 3d, for they were (as appears from ancient Writings) a Regular and well ſettled Body in the Year 1267.</p>
                  <p>THEY were originally Merchants of this Town, and afterwards landed Men.</p>
                  <p>TWO of this Family ſucceeded <hi>Peter Scott,</hi> (who was the Firſt Mayor of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and Mayor for three Years) from the Year 1254, to the Year 1269.</p>
                  <p>THIS Situation is alſo confirmed by the <hi>Milbank</hi> Manuſcript which ſays, that this Fryery was near to <hi>Pilgrim-ſtreet-gate,</hi> and that there is a little Lane be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and the Walls, wherein there is an <hi>Alms-houſe;</hi> but now both the Fryery and it are converted to private Uſes.</p>
                  <p>THIS <hi>Alms-houſe</hi> flouriſhed as late as Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Days, for 'tis ſaid in a Writing belonging to Mr. <hi>Richard Wall</hi> of this Town, the Proprietor of theſe Houſes, that in the Year 1555/6, in the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> and <hi>Mary</hi> it was inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by poor Religious Women; <hi>Inhabitant nunc</hi> — <hi>Pauperes mulieres Deo ſervientes.</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>Grey-Fryers,</hi> or as they are properly called the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> received their Name from St. <hi>Francis,</hi> born in the Dutchy of <hi>Spoletum</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> who was canonized by Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the <hi>Ninth;</hi> about two Years after whoſe Death the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> and one <hi>Diggs,</hi> (Anceſtor of Sir <hi>Dudley Diggs</hi>) bought for them their firſt Seat in <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS Order for School Divinity beat all other Orders, and had a Curious <hi>Library</hi> in <hi>London</hi> (built by <hi>Richard Whittington</hi>) in that Age, coſting 550 <hi>l.</hi> They afforded in <hi>England</hi> 110 learned Writers. <hi>Fuller.</hi>

                     <hi>JOHN Scotus</hi> alias <hi>Duns,</hi> or <hi>Duns Scotus;</hi> there was much Controverſy whether he was an Engliſh-Man, a Scot, or an Iriſh-Man. He was a Man of a mean Fortune, of a Wit made for Learning, and wonderful Subtle and Sharp. When he had ſtudied ſome Years with great Advantage at <hi>Oxford,</hi> he returned into <hi>Northumberland,</hi> his native Country, as ſome will have it, and took upon him the Habit of St. <hi>Francis</hi> at <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> Being afterwards ſent to <hi>Oxford,</hi> he again fell to his Studies with great Vehemency, 'till he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to be Doctor and Profeſſor of Divinity. Thus he 1ſt expounded the Maſter of Sentences at <hi>Oxford;</hi> and afterwards, in the Year 1304, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed Profeſſor at <hi>Paris,</hi> by the General of the Order, in the Chapter in <hi>Toulouſe,</hi> he there taught a Courſe of Divinity. Thirdly, he did the ſame at <hi>Cologne</hi> with wonderful Applauſe; at which Time there aroſe at <hi>Cologne</hi> the Controverſy about the Conception of the Bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> whether ſhe was conceived in original Sin or not? All the followers of <hi>Albertus Magnus</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd, that ſhe was; <hi>Scotus</hi> and his Adherents poſitively aſſerted the contrary. Here it was that he gained the Title of Dr. <hi>Subtilis;</hi> he publiſh'd a Lecture on <hi>Geneſis. Commentaries on the Goſpels</hi> in 4 Books. Several Books on the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Sermons of Saints, and of Particular Times. Two or three Pieces on the Maſter of Sentences. Quodlibets. Theological Diſputations, Of the Knowledge of God. Of the Perfection of States. On all <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Works; and many other Things. <hi>Addit. Seph. Vol.</hi> I. <hi>p.</hi> 98.</p>
                  <p>HE dy'd miſerably, 1309, being taken with an Apoplectick Fit, and too haſtily buried: For, Nature having too late wrought through the Diſtemper, he vainly mourn'd for Aſſiſtance, 'till, at laſt, beating his Head againſt the Tomb-ſtone, he daſh'd out his Brains, and ſo expir'd. Whereupon a certain Italian wrote thus of him;</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>A little below this Hall of the Taylors, and the Appurtenances thereof, was probably the Houſe of</hi> Laurentius Acton, <hi>which border'd on the</hi> South, <hi>upon the Houſe of the preſent Mr.</hi> Thomas Waters. <hi>This</hi> Laurentius <hi>was Mayor of</hi> Newcaſtle <hi>1433, 1435, 1436, 1437, in the Reign of</hi> Henry <hi>the 6th. Oppoſite to this Houſe of</hi> Laurentius Action, <hi>is the Market for Wheat and Rye, every</hi> Tueſday <hi>and</hi> Saturday.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>BELOW this again are</hi> three narrow Lanes, <hi>two on the Weſt-ſide of the Street, and one on the Eaſt: Thoſe on the Weſt are the</hi> Nether-Dean-Bridge, <hi>leading into St.</hi> Nicholas <hi>Church-yard, which has been ſpoken of before, and the</hi> Painter-Hugh, <hi>or as it is called in a Writing, as old as</hi> Edward <hi>the Third's Reign,</hi> Payntourhogh, <hi>which leads into the Street called the</hi> Side. <hi>It is from</hi> Pilgrim-ſtreet <hi>a very great Deſcent into the</hi> Side; <hi>but it is made tollerably eaſy, by having</hi> Stairs <hi>on one Side of it. It ſeems to have got it's Name from the River flowing by the Bottom of it up to the</hi> Nether-Dean-Bridge, <hi>&amp;c. For</hi> Hugh <hi>ſignifies a</hi> Steep-Hill, <hi>or</hi> Bank, <hi>and</hi> Painter <hi>is a Term made uſe of by the</hi> Sailors <hi>for a</hi> Rope, <hi>which they faſten the Boat with. This Street therefore was called the</hi> Painter-Hugh, <hi>becauſe it was the</hi> Hugh <hi>which the</hi> Painters <hi>were made faſt to.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>ONE</hi> William Porter <hi>had a Houſe at the End of this Street, which he granted to</hi> John de Chambers, <hi>a Burgeſs of this Town, in the Reign of King</hi> Edward <hi>the Third,</hi> Anno <hi>1361, on Condition that he paid to the</hi> Prioreſs <hi>and Convent of</hi> Lambly, <hi>eighteen Shillings</hi> per Annum.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>THE other Lane or Street, on the Eaſt of this Street, is</hi> Silver-ſtreet, <hi>cloſe by the North-ſide of</hi> All-hallows Church-yard; <hi>it leads into</hi> Pandon. <hi>It is ſaid, but very improbably, to have got it's Name of</hi> Silver-ſtreet, <hi>becauſe of the</hi> Fiſh-market, <hi>which was kept a little below it, at the</hi> Stock-Bridge. <hi>It was anciently called</hi> All-Hallowgate, <hi>for</hi> All-Hallowgate <hi>is ſaid to be</hi> Ex parte Boreali Eccleſiae omnium Sanctorum; <hi>it was alſo called</hi> Temple-gate. <hi>Mr.</hi> Nicholas Lamb, <hi>whoſe Houſe is in this Street, finds it called</hi> Jewgate, <hi>in his Writings; but when, or for what Reaſon it bore that Name, I know not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>WE come now to the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> All-Hallows, <hi>which ſtands a little below</hi> Silver-ſtreet, <hi>and on the ſame Side of the Street with it,</hi> viz. <hi>at the very Bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of this</hi> Pilgrim-ſtreet.</p>

                  <head>Sect. IV. <hi>Of</hi> ALL-HALLOWS CHURCH.</head>
                  <p>WHO this Church was founded by, I have met with no Account, nor any of the Time it was built in; only this is certain, it muſt have been built before the Year 1286, but how long before, I know not. For in that Year I meet with an Account of <note n="c" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> P. 245.</note> the <hi>Church-yard</hi> of <hi>All-Hallows,</hi> which is a plain Proof that the Church was then in Being.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>GREY</hi> is of Opinion that it was dedicated to <hi>All-Hallows,</hi> or <hi>All-Saints,</hi> from the ancient Name of that Part of the <hi>Town Pampedon,</hi> which he ſays was ſo called from <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     </note> (who inhabited this Part of the Town) after the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Pantheon,</hi> which was dedicated to <hi>all the Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS Church is ſeated upon a Hill, which is much about the ſame Height with the Situation of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s in <hi>Gateſhead,</hi> and upon the ſame Line with it.</p>
                  <p>IT is not ſo long as St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> being only 55 Yards, one Foot, a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long; but it is broader, as being 25 Yards, two Foot broad. The <hi>Steeple</hi> is but or a mean Height, being a Square Tower, with only one <hi>Spire</hi> ariſing from it. The Bells belonging to this Church were founded in the Year 1696. They were caſt out of the Metal of that famous <hi>Statue</hi> of King <hi>James</hi> the Second, which ſtood on the <hi>Sand-Hill.</hi> They were founded in the Ground belonging to St. <hi>Auſtin Fryers,</hi> in that Part of it, which is in the Back-ſide of the <hi>Hoſpital</hi> of the <hi>Holy Jeſus.</hi> Their Sound is not ſo Melodious as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in this Town, but the Note is exceedingly exact, and more tuneful than the others.</p>
                  <p>WHATEVER <hi>Robert Rhodes</hi> did to this <hi>Steeple,</hi> his Name is under the Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fry of it, as at St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi> In one of the Regiſters belonging to this Church of <hi>All-Hallows,</hi> we have the following Account. About the <hi>Round</hi> where the Bells are drawn up into the Bell-houſe in the <hi>Steeple,</hi> there is written, <hi>Orate pro anima Roberti Rhodes.</hi> His <hi>Arms</hi> are alſo without, at the Eaſt-end of the Church, on the <hi>Breaſt</hi> of an <hi>Angel;</hi> which, as I take it, is a <hi>Tyger,</hi> or <hi>Grey-hound</hi> on a <hi>Chief,</hi> and <hi>three Annulets</hi> on the <hi>Eſcutcheon.</hi> The like is in St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Church, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In St. <hi>John</hi>'s alſo, on the Out-ſide of the <hi>South Porch,</hi> over-againſt the <hi>Alms-houſe,</hi> there is on a Square, <hi>Orate pro anima Roberti Rhodes.</hi> I have alſo ſeen the ſame in <hi>Tinmouth Caſtle</hi> in a <hi>Round,</hi> on the North-ſide, after you are within the Gate, upon the <hi>Wall;</hi> which be-like was in ſome Part of that great <hi>Church,</hi> when it was a <hi>Cell</hi> of St. <hi>Alban</hi>'s.</p>
                  <p>UPON the Eaſt-end of the <hi>Chancel,</hi> in the South-eaſt Window, there was the Picture of our Saviour at large, but in the Time of the <hi>Rebellion</hi> it was wholly taken away.</p>
                  <p>NEXT to it, as you go up the South-ſide; there was the Picture of a <hi>Boy</hi> ſtanding upon chequer'd Pavement, as it ſeemed, and on the Glaſs under him,
<q>
                        <l>Like as the <hi>Jamen</hi> moiſt and cold,</l>
                        <l>Is full of Tempeſt Day by Day,</l>
                        <l>So is one Child of ten Years old,</l>
                        <l>Hath no Underſtanding, but all on Play.</l>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE ſame Authority adds, I ſuppoſe the reſt of the Months were alſo in this Window in former Times, but I have ſeen it only; and it was taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way alſo in the Time of the Rebellion.</p>
                  <p>IN the Window above the South Door, which leads into the Quire, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Porch, were the Pictures of <hi>Roger Thornton</hi>'s Children, <hi>Two Men</hi> and <hi>Three Women</hi> Kneeling at Altars. There remain now only <hi>Two</hi> of the Women.</p>
                  <p>THERE are higher up this Iſle, in the Windows towards the Porch ſome Characters, one is like an (I) with an (S) through it, and other <hi>Three Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,</hi> which are the Merchants <hi>Skin-mark,</hi> for they are but a little Different from the <hi>Skin-mark,</hi> which is upon the Stone of <hi>Chriſtopher Elmer.</hi> It is a Token that ſome Merchant was a Benefactor to the Church, and perhaps ſome Part of the South Wall of the Church: I take it to be the <hi>Skin-mark</hi> of <hi>Roger Thornton,</hi> for the very ſame is in the <hi>Chantery</hi> of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> over-againſt his Tomb.</p>
                  <p>TRADITION ſays, that from the Weſt-end of the Veſtry to the Porch, the old South Wall was taken away, and rebuilt further into the Church-yard
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0583000100:101"/>
by <hi>Roger de Thornton.</hi> That the old Wall was farther into the Church than the Wall now is, is plain from the Piece of it now remaining, which is on the Eaſt-end of the <hi>Veſtry;</hi> and I think the Pictures in the Windows a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned, is a good Confirmation of the Truth of the Tradition of the Builder. In that Window next the Porch Door, but one, there have been the Pictures of the <hi>Twelve Apoſtles.</hi> There are now only remaining St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> the Leſs, St. <hi>Andrew,</hi> St. <hi>Philip,</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> Major, and another.</p>
                  <p>THERE are three Galleries in this Church, one on the Weſt-end, and, another on the Eaſt-end of the Nave, and the other in the North-Iſle. That on the Weſt-end was built in the Year 1712. The <hi>Organ</hi> which was plac'd in the middle of it was built at the ſame Time. It is a very long Gallery, and by much the moſt beautiful in the Church. On the North-end of it are the Seats of the Children belonging to the <hi>Charity-School.</hi> The Gallery on the Weſt-end, is called the <hi>Butchers Gallery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE other Gallery on the North-Iſle is the <hi>Sailors Gallery.</hi> It is ſaid in a Memorandum made at the Bottom of it, to have been <hi>built and finiſhed by the</hi> Trinity-houſe <hi>in</hi> Newcaſtle <hi>upon</hi> Tyne, <hi>in the Year</hi> 1618, John Holbourne <hi>then Maſter.</hi> It was beautified in the Year 1720, <hi>Robert Bailiff</hi> being then Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, with three or four Devices on the South-ſide of it. One Pannel has the Picture of <hi>St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Shipwreck;</hi> another, our <hi>Saviour's being aſleep in the Storm;</hi> then there is the Arms of the <hi>Trinity-houſe;</hi> another Draught is that of our Saviour's taking <hi>Peter by the Hand when he was ſinking in the Waves;</hi> and the other is that of <hi>Jonah vomited up upon the dry Land.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Chancel</hi> of this Church ſtands upon a large <hi>Vault,</hi> which conſiſts of a <hi>pretty long Entrance, arched at the Top,</hi> and of a <hi>pretty large Square Room, with a curious Pillar in it,</hi> which is the grand Support of eight large <hi>Stone Arches.</hi> The Entrance into this <hi>vault</hi> is in the <hi>Church-yard,</hi> on the <hi>North-ſide</hi> of it.</p>
                  <p>AS you enter into the <hi>Chancel</hi> from the <hi>Nave</hi> of the Church, you have on the left Hand of you, an <hi>old Pair of Stairs,</hi> to which are adjoining the <hi>Stairs</hi> of the <hi>Butchers Gallery:</hi> Theſe <hi>Stairs</hi> formerly led into the ſame Place, but then it was into a <hi>Gallery</hi> different from what the <hi>Butchers Gallery</hi> is now. They led into a <hi>Loft</hi> or <hi>Gallery</hi> called the <hi>Rood Loft.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Rood</hi> was an Image of our Saviour upon the Croſs, made generally of <hi>Wood,</hi> and placed on a <hi>Loft</hi> made for that Purpoſe, juſt over the Paſſage out of the <hi>Church</hi> into the <hi>Chancel;</hi> out of this Myſtery, they ſay, that the <hi>Church</hi> repreſents the <hi>Church Militant,</hi> and the <hi>Chancel</hi> the <hi>Church Triumphant;</hi> and who will paſs out of the Former into the Latter, muſt go under the <hi>Rood Loft,</hi> that is, they muſt go under the <hi>Croſs, and ſuffer Affliction.</hi> This <hi>Image</hi> was wont to have the <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> on one Side of it, and St. <hi>John</hi> on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Stavely, C. Hiſt. P.</hi> 199.</p>
                  <p>A few Years ago the <hi>Chancel</hi> was beautifyed. It is pannel'd round with Wainſcot. The Table is a large curious <hi>Marble Stone,</hi> which was given to the Church for that Uſe by an unknown Hand. On the large Pannel, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately above the <hi>Altar,</hi> is this Figure; <q>I. <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>. S.</q> or, <hi>Jeſus Hominum Salvator:</hi> Above that again is the Picture of a <hi>Dove,</hi> cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly carved in <hi>Wood;</hi> and above that again, in a <hi>Golden Glory,</hi> is the great Name of God <gap reason="foreign">

                        <hi>JOHN Simpſon</hi> Hoaſtman, and <hi>Jane</hi> his Wife their Burial Place. In this Grave of theirs was buried their eldeſt Son <hi>Anderſon,</hi> ſo called as being a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendant of the worthy and loyal Family of the <hi>Anderſon</hi>'s of <hi>Braidley,</hi> who ſuffer'd ſo much in the Time of the Civil Wars, in Defence of their King and Country. He dyed <hi>May</hi> the 17th <hi>Anno</hi> 1730, in the 21ſt Year of his Age. He was a Youth of fine Parts, and good Learning, a great deal of Sweetneſs of Temper, and ſtrict Religion.</p>
                     <p>THERE is in this Part of the Church a very large Stone, inſculp'd with Braſs, of which ſeveral Years ago no more could be read than <hi>hic Tumulatus — dono dei datus mitis clero — promotor Eccleſiarum.</hi> My Authority imagines this to be the Burial Place of <hi>Robert Rhodes.</hi> He ſays, the Picture upon the Stone was very like that of <hi>Roger Thornton;</hi> all the Difference is, that the Gown of this Picture is not ſo deep as that of <hi>Thornton</hi>'s. He conjectures it to be the burial Place of <hi>Robert Rhodes;</hi> becauſe of the Words <hi>Promotor Eccleſiarum,</hi> lib. <hi>All-Hall'.</hi> The Words <hi>Promotor Eccleſiarum</hi> are not now to be found. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, had they been there ſtill, I think they are but a weak Argument to prove that <hi>Robert Rhodes</hi> was buried here, when it is conſidered that he founded a Chantery in St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> that his own Soul, and his Wife's might be prayed for. For People were generally buried in the ſame Church, and near the very Place, where they erected a Chantery or an Altar.</p>
                     <p>BUT whoever it is, this I think may be ſafely concluded from the Gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur of the <hi>Grave Stone,</hi> that he was ſome wealthy Perſon; and from his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Promotor Eccleſiarum,</hi> that he was alſo Religious.</p>
                     <p>THE <hi>Effigies</hi> is very Tall, and is ſurrounded with very curious Pictures of the Saints, and ſome other Things; but the Braſs is now tearing off, and going very faſt into Ruin. It is a pity it ſhould not have more care taken of it, as it is an Ornament to the Church, and the Monument of it's Benefactor. The <hi>Promoters</hi> of <hi>Churches</hi> ſhould be always remember'd with the moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reſpect, that they may be ſhining Lights to the moſt diſtant Ages.</p>

                  <p>THE <hi>Curate</hi> of this Church is the Miniſter of it.

It was formerly the Cuſtom to have two Clerks for this Church. But in the Year 1708, it was thought more convenient for the Pariſh, and leſs Burthenſome to the <hi>Miniſter</hi> (who had one of the largeſt Cures in the Kingdom to manage) to have an Aſſiſtant; accordingly <hi>Abraham Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cox,</hi> M. A. was put into the Clerk's Place, which was vacant by the Death of <hi>John Pinkney,</hi> and was allow'd the Fees of the Clerk for Weddings, Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials and Chriſtnings; which amounts to 50 <hi>l.</hi> per Annum: Mr. <hi>Wilcox</hi> was ſucceeded by <hi>Ambroſe Fenwick,</hi> M.

                  <p>THERE are other two Clergymen belonging to this Church, which are Lecturers, and paid by the Town; the one for Preaching in the Morning has 100 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and the other for Preaching in the Afternoon 100 <hi>l. per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>

                  <p>THERE are Prayers at this Church every Day at 10-o'Clock in the Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and 4 in the Afternoon. The Sacrament is adminiſtred at this Church every ſecond Sunday in the Month. It was formerly uſual for the Town to preſent this Church, at the <hi>High Feſtival of Eaſter,</hi> with twenty one Gallons of Wine.</p>
                  <p>OPPOSITE to the <hi>Weſt Stairs</hi> of this Church is an <hi>Alms-Houſe,</hi> which was in good Repair, as we are informed by the <hi>Milbank</hi> Manuſcript, about 100 Years ago, at which Time the <hi>Church-Wardens</hi> allowed them 20 <hi>s. per Annum,</hi> for Coals for four Women. It is now in very bad Repair, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt into Ruins. At preſent the People in it, are allowed eight Chaldron of Coals <hi>per Annum,</hi> and three Shillings <hi>per</hi> Quarter by the Church-wardens.</p>
                  <p>ON the <hi>South-ſide</hi> of this Church are two Pair of Stairs; thoſe oppoſite to the <hi>Quire-Door</hi> lead into a narrow Street called the <hi>Dog-bank;</hi> but former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as appears by ſome ancient Writings, <hi>Silver-ſtreet:</hi> The other Pair lead into the <hi>Butcher-Bank,</hi> which is a narrow Street, and a great Deſcent. It is moſtly inhabited by <hi>Butchers,</hi> who have their Shops and Houſes there. In this are many narrow Lanes called <hi>Chares,</hi> which lead into the <hi>Key-ſide.</hi> This leads into the Street called the <hi>Side,</hi> and into the <hi>Sand-hill.</hi> It was called formerly <hi>All-Hallows Bank.</hi>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>N order now to go regularly down into the lower Parts of the Town, let us ſet off from the South-ſide of the Steeple of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> which leads dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctly to the Top of the Street called the <hi>Side.</hi> Whilſt I am here I can't help obſerving, that were the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes belonging to Mr. <hi>Partis,</hi> &amp;c. which are ſituated from the Porch Door of St. <hi>Nicholas,</hi> to the ſaid Street, taken away, the Belfry and Steeple would look much more grand and magnificent; and whereas this <hi>Great Ornament</hi> of the Town is now almoſt hid as a Traveller comes up this Street, it would then be wholly expos'd, and ſtrike the Beholders with Awe and Wonder.</p>
               <p>AFTER you have croſſed the upper Part of this Street, there is a Paſſage leading to <hi>Bailiff-Gate,</hi> which has a Turn upon the Left-hand, that goes into the <hi>Caſtle-yard,</hi> the Place where is ſituated the <hi>Caſtle</hi> of this Town.</p>

                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:0583000100:121"/>BEFORE the Conqueſt the old <hi>Round Tower</hi> was probably in Being, and was the <hi>old Caſtle,</hi> or <hi>Fort</hi> of <hi>Monkcheſter;</hi> and after the Conqueſt, when the other Caſtle was built, it was called, (to diſtinguiſh it from the <hi>old Caſtle</hi>) the <hi>New-Caſtle,</hi> which in a ſmall Time after gave Name to the whole Place. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this Purpoſe are theſe two or three Words about it, in the Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript of <hi>John Milbank,</hi>

               <p>THIS <hi>new Caſtle</hi> was built by <hi>Robert Curthois,</hi> the Son of <hi>William</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror in the Year 1080 as has been before obſerved. But notwithſtanding this, and that it gives a new Name to the Place, yet whatever Priviledges be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to <hi>Monkcheſter</hi> (for ſo the Town was then called) continued with it, nor did the <hi>Caſtle</hi> impair them in the leaſt.</p>

               <p>THE firſt Account we meet with of it after it was built, is of it's being be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged by <hi>William Rufus.</hi> For <hi>Robert Mowbray,</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> having oppoſed him, he came down and laid Siege to the Caſtle, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> upon which <hi>Robert</hi> fled, and abſconded in <hi>Bamburgh-Caſtle;</hi> but was afterwards taken by the King's Party, and carried Priſoner to <hi>Windſor.</hi>

And this he conjeſtures, becauſe in the <hi>Saxon, Cheſtre</hi> is called <hi>Concester,</hi> and becauſe it is but a few Miles from the Wall. But others are of Opinion, that <hi>Benwall,</hi> a Village about two Miles Weſt of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> was the ancient <hi>Condercum,</hi> becauſe of the Antiquity of the Place, and its Nearneſs to the Wall; the <hi>Notitia</hi> deſcribed the <hi>Condercum,</hi> as upon the <hi>Line of the Wall.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This indeed ſeems rather probable. For if a Place is ſaid to be ſituated <hi>ad lineam valli,</hi> one would think it ſhould not be far from the Wall, however not in the wrong Side of <hi>Tine.</hi> The Places of the <hi>Roman</hi> Garriſons <hi>ad lineam Valli,</hi> as far as I can iudge, have always been in theſe Counties which the <hi>Roman</hi> Wall paſt through; but no Body ſeen yet found out the leaſt Footſteps of it in the County of <hi>Durham.</hi>

                     <p>In this Village were lately found ſeveral <hi>Mens</hi> with <hi>Coins</hi> in them, which were moſt of them broken and ſquander'd about by the ignorant Diggers; but one of them being preſerved, was given to the Library at <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> where it remains very intire.</p>

                        <hi>Heaton</hi> is a ſmall Village diſtant from <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> about a Mile and a Half Eaſtward. It has been handed down by Tradition to the preſent Day, that it was a Place of Retreat for King <hi>John</hi> when he came into this Country, and there are ſtill to be ſeen the Ruines of an <hi>ancient Building,</hi> now in the poſſeſſion of <hi>Richard Ridley,</hi> 
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> which carries the Name of <hi>King</hi> John<hi>'s Palace.</hi> Whatever Truth there may be in this Tradition, this is certain, that there is in the ſaid <hi>Gentleman</hi>'s Ground on the <hi>North-ſide</hi> of this old Building, the Remains of a Fortification, which 'tis natural to conjecture, was built for the Safety and Security of this Houſe, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently this Houſe muſt have been of ſome great Diſtinction. And when it is further conſidered, that this Village of <hi>Heaton</hi> is a Part of the <hi>Barony of</hi> Robert de <hi>Gaugy,</hi> it may not be improbable to conclude, that this ancient Building has in ſome Meaſure been what Tradition ſays it was. For <hi>Robert de Gaugy</hi> was a great Man in the Reign of King <hi>John,</hi> and was entruſted by him (as has juſt now been obſerved) with the Government of divers Caſtles at Times, to defend them againſt the <hi>rebellious Barons,</hi> which he did faithfully and to his own Advantage; for in the 3d of <hi>Henry III.</hi> it was certified, that the Barony of this <hi>Robert</hi> in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, conſiſted of this and the other Manours, which he held of the King by the Service of <hi>Three Knights Fees.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Robert</hi> therefore might have had his own Houſe here upon this Part of his Barony; and as he was ſo faithful a ſervant to King <hi>John,</hi> and entruſted by him with Matters of ſuch great Concern, it is not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable but when the King came to theſe Parts, he lodged at this Houſe; and this perhaps was the Reaſon of its getting the Name it hears at this Day.</p>
                     <p>This is its ancient Grandeur; its preſent is, the Houſe and Family of the worthy Gentleman above mentioned; it was built in the Year <hi>1713,</hi> it is a beautiful Houſe, and ſo ſituated, that on the <hi>Weſt</hi> it overlooks the <hi>Town-Moor, Fenham,</hi> and Part of the Lands of the Prior of <hi>Tinmouth;</hi> on the <hi>Eaſt</hi> it faces the <hi>Sheilds Road;</hi> on the <hi>North</hi> it has a moſt agreeable Proſpect to the Windings of the <hi>Ouſe-Burn,</hi> of its Woods and Banks, and of the Villages ſituated on it. On the South it faces the River <hi>Tine.</hi> Its Conveniencies and Beauties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it, are on the Weſt-ſide a <hi>Fiſh-Pond, Groves, Wilderneſs, Gardens, Avenues,</hi> and Numbers of Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations. On the <hi>Eaſt</hi> a very large and beauteous Quadrangle, whoſe Walls are ſhaded with the choiceſt Fruit-Trees, and whoſe <hi>Area</hi> is adorn'd with Variety of <hi>Knots</hi> and <hi>Flowers.</hi> In this <hi>Area,</hi> at a due Diſtance, are two <hi>Images</hi> tall as the Life, which declare the Hand of a curious <hi>Statuary.</hi> On the <hi>North</hi> are Gardens and Plantations, and on the <hi>South</hi> an <hi>Area</hi> Adorned with Images and a pleaſing Gravel-Walk, beſet with Trees and bordered with Flowers.</p>
                     <p>This Gentleman the Poſſeſſor was eldeſt Son to <hi>Nicholas Ridley,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This <hi>Nicholas</hi> was of the younger Branch of the <hi>Ridleys</hi> of <hi>Wilmotes-Wike;</hi> the Seat as Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> ſays, of the <hi>worſhipful Family of the Ridleys,</hi> which is a pretty large <hi>Caſtle</hi> on the South-ſide of <hi>Tine,</hi> and very ancient, as appears from ſeveral Things about it.</p>
                     <p>A little above this, upon the Banks of the <hi>Tine,</hi> is the Eſtate of Mr. <hi>Nicholas Ridley,</hi> the younger Son of the ſaid Gentleman.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Nicholas,</hi> Senior, was <hi>twice Mayor of</hi> Newcaſtle, in the Year <hi>1688,</hi> and in the Year <hi>1706,</hi> and was eſteemed a Man of great Honour and Integrity, and an excellent Magiſtrare. By his laſt Will and Teſtament, dated 7th <hi>December 1710,</hi> he gave and bequeathed to the Poor of the Pariſh of <hi>Haltwhiſtle 40</hi> s. <hi>per annum,</hi> out of a little Farm or Tenement called <hi>Waggtail</hi>-Hall.

                     <p>This <hi>John Bertram,</hi> who was afterwards Knighted, was ſeveral Times Sheriff of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> in the Reign of King <hi>Henry VI.</hi> and his Poſterity flouriſhed, and had the Title of Lords <hi>Ogle,</hi> 'till the latter End of Queen <hi>Eliſabeth</hi>'s Reign, when Male-Iſſue failing in <hi>Cuthbert</hi> Lord <hi>Ogle, Katharine,</hi> his Daughter and Heir, married to Sir <hi>Charles Cavendiſh,</hi> Knight of <hi>Walbeck</hi> in <hi>Nottinghamſhire,</hi> and carried the Eſtate and Title of <hi>Ogle</hi> into that Family; but the Name of <hi>Bertram</hi> is not forgotten, for it is a common Chriſtian Name in thoſe Northern Parts. Some think the Name of <hi>Ferdinando</hi> is derived from it.</p>

                        <hi>Werke,</hi> the Caſtle and Manour of which was held in the Reign of King <hi>Hen.

III.</hi> to hold it in Barony of the King by the Service of two Knights Fees, as his Father and Predeceſſors had done. This Barony had many Towns and wordſhips belonging to it.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Robert</hi> being conſtituted Chief Juſtice of the King's Foreſts in <hi>Derby, Cumberland,</hi> this County, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had free Warren granted him in all his Demeſne Lands here, and divers others of his Manours in this County. <hi>36 Hen. III.</hi> But 39th <hi>Hen. III.</hi> he delivered up this Caſtle into the King's Hands, who being advancing with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my againſt the <hi>Scots,</hi> did not think it ſafe to ſuffer ſo ſtrong a Fort out of his own Power; but upon the King's Return it was yielded up to him again the next year. Afterwards the King began a Suit againſt him, for the Title of his Caſtle of <hi>Werke;</hi> but he in his Defence producing his elder Brother <hi>William</hi> for Warranty, the King upon mature Advice, with ſuch Noblemen as were of his Council, diſcerning, that he had a good Right to it, quitted his Claim to him. This <hi>Robert,</hi> not long after this, fell in Love with a <hi>Scotch</hi> Woman, and having a Mind to get her for his Wife; not only joined himſelf with the <hi>Scots,</hi> but endeavoured to engage his Kinſman on their Side, viz. <hi>William de Ros,</hi> of <hi>Hemlake,</hi> who deteſting ſuch Treachery, diſſuaded him from it, but not being able to prevail, advertiſed the King of it, and obtain'd a ſufficient Force to defend this Caſtle, that it ſhould not be ſurrendred to the <hi>Scots. Robert</hi> being thus diſappointed, took a Body of Men out of the Garriſon of <hi>Rox-borough,</hi> and invading the Borders with Banners diſplay'd, burnt <hi>Preſtten,</hi> and this Town, and then joining himſelf with <hi>William Wallis,</hi> the famous <hi>Scotch</hi> General committed great Spoils upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in theſe Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern Parts. His Eſtate was for theſe Rebellions Actions conſiſcated, but after his Death, reſtored to his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Heir, <hi>Margaret de Roſs,</hi> upon an Allegation, that he had, before his Death, come to an Accord, with <hi>John Comin</hi> of <hi>Badenagh,</hi> for himſelf and all his Arms with him, to be ſafe as to Life, Liberty, and Eſtate. How ſhe married we find not, but it appears that Sir <hi>John Montacute,</hi> afterwards Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> was in the Poſſeſſion of this Caſtle and Manour upon the Death of <hi>Margaret</hi> his Mother, who had it, and divers other Eſtates for her Dowry. Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> tells us, that in his Time they were the Eſtate of the <hi>Greys,</hi> a Family of Note for their Valour, of whom <hi>William Grey</hi> was in the Reign of King <hi>James I.</hi> advanced firſt to the Degree of a Baronet, and within a few years after to the Honour of a Baron, by the Title of Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Werke,</hi> viz. <hi>11 Feb. 21 Jac.

He married <hi>Anne,</hi> the Daughter, and one of the Coheirs, of Sir <hi>John Wentworth</hi> of <hi>Gosfield,</hi> in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and there fixed his Seat, in which his Poſterity ſometime reſided, 'till <hi>Ford,</hi> Lord <hi>Grey,</hi> ſold it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No Caſtle-ward or Cornage was paid for this Barony; but yet it belonged to the Caſtle of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> as appears by an Inquiſition taken at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> 9th <hi>Edw.

               </p>
               <p>THERE were two great ſtrong Walls which ſurrounded the Caſtle. The interior Wall was of no great Diſtance from the Caſtle itſelf, as may be ſtill ſeen in ſeveral Places. The exterior Wall ſurrounds the Verge of the <hi>Caſtle</hi> Bounders. From this <hi>outer Wall</hi> were four Gates, the <hi>Great Gate</hi> and three Poſterns.

There ſtill remains a Piece of the old Wall, which ſhews its Situation to have been where that Houſe is, which was lately purchaſed by Mr. <hi>Jaſper Harriſon;</hi> the Shop belonging to this Houſe was dugg (as I was informed) out of the Wall juſt now mentioned.

On the South-ſide of the <hi>Caſtle</hi> is another Gate, which leads down the <hi>Caſtle-ſtairs</hi> to the Street called the <hi>Cloſe:</hi> This was called the <hi>South Poſtern.</hi> There is an old Building upon it, which was the County-Goaler's Houſe.

               </p>
               <p>AN Inquiſition in the Reign of <hi>James</hi> I. ſays, that the ancient <hi>Caſtle,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the King, ſituated within the Walls of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to the County of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and is ſurrounded with a great Stone-Wall. That below the Caſtle there is a great <hi>Hall,</hi> where the County of <hi>Northumberland</hi> holds their Aſſizes. There is alſo a great <hi>Tower,</hi> full of Chinks, under which are two Vaults, which are the Places where the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of the County of <hi>Northumberland</hi> are kept, which are within the Circuit of the Caſtle itſelf.</p>
               <p>AND that there is in Being the exterior Wall of the Caſtle, which begins North of the Caſtle, about ſix Yards from the <hi>Great Gate,</hi> which leads into the <hi>Caſtle-yard;</hi> and ſo goes on eaſtward and ſouthward by the Back of ſome Houſes in the <hi>Side.</hi> Then it goes weſtward by the Back of ſome Houſes in the <hi>Sand-hill;</hi> then it croſſes the <hi>Caſtle-ſtairs,</hi> which lead to the Street called the <hi>Cloſe,</hi> and from thence behind the Houſes, even to the upper <hi>Pinion-Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel</hi> of the Houſe of <hi>James Clavering</hi> Alderman, which is about nine Yards diſtant from the long Stairs, where the ſaid ancient Wall, on account of its Decay, does no farther appear; but yet the Bounds and Limits of the Caſtle go through the middle Part of a Houſe, extending itſelf even to the Channel in the long Stairs. Then it goes along the Channel upwards on the Outſide of the new Wall, which was built to encloſe the <note n="i" place="margin">The high and great Heap, <hi>viz.</hi> the Dunghill on the Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the Caſtle, was taken away by Sir <hi>John Marley</hi> Mayor, and his Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, to ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part the Town-Walls againſt the Parliament and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth,</note> Dunghill. From thence it goes to the Corner of the Houſe of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>  and thence by the Back-part of the Houſe of  <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap>  where the ancient outward Wall begins. This ancient outward Wall of the Caſtle contains by Meaſure three Acres of Ground and one Rood.</p>
               <p>IN the 18th of this King's Reign, another Inquiſition was held at <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle</hi> about the Caſtle, wherein Complaint was made of the <hi>Dunghill</hi> men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the Bounds of the Caſtle, that it had increaſed to ſuch a Bigneſs, that it was in Length 98 Yards, the Depth of it was 10 Yards, and the Breadth of it 32 Yards; which being ſuch a prodigious Weight upon the Wall on the Weſt-ſide of the Caſtle (which Wall was in Length 40 Yards, in Height 10 Yards, in Breadth 2 Yards) that a great Part of it is intirely thrown down and ſubverted to the great Detriment of the Strength of the Caſtle. The Damage was computed at 120 <hi>l.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT was alſo by this ſame Inquiſition complained of, that the great ſquare Tower was full of Chinks and Crannies; and that one Third of it was almoſt taken away: That all the Lead and Covering which it had of old was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bezled and carried of, inſomuch that the Priſoners of the County of <hi>Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland</hi> were moſt miſerably lodged, by reaſon of the Showers of Rain falling upon them. They computed the Charge of repairing it would be 809 <hi>l.</hi> 15 <hi>s.</hi> 0 <hi>d.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IT has been a Building of great Strength, and no little Beauty; the vaſt Thickneſs of the Walls ſpeaks the one, and the Ruines of ſome curious Workmanſhip ſpeaks the other. The grand Entrance into the Caſtle was at the Gate facing the South, which leads up a Pair of Stairs (which ſtill ſhew the Magnificence of the Builder) to a very ſtately Door of curious Maſonry. The Room this leads into, has its Floor broken down cloſe to the Caſtle-Wall, as indeed all the other Floors are to the Top of the Caſtle; ſo that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Floor above the County-Goal, there is not one left, tho' there have been five Diviſions or Stories of the Caſtle beſides this. This floored Room which I was told was lately flagg'd by the Order of <hi>William Elliſon,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Alderman, when he was laſt Mayor in the Year 1723, ſeems to me without any Doubt, to have been the <hi>common Hall</hi> of the Caſtle, becauſe on the North-ſide of the ſame Room there is an Entrance by a Deſcent of ſome Steps into a Room, where is the largeſt Fire-place I ſaw in the Caſtle, which plainly ſpeaks it to have been the Kitchen. At the End of this there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0583000100:131"/>
Stairs, which lead into a Place under the Kitchen, which I think goes down as low as the Bottom of the Caſtle. This I take to have been a Cel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, as I do alſo that little <hi>dark Place</hi> on the right Hand coming up again, to have been a Sort of a Pauntry.</p>
               <p>THE Door I mentioned juſt now on the Eaſt of the Caſtle, which leads to the firſt broken down Floor, is becauſe of it's Grandeur and Beauty, an Argument that this Room has been the moſt ſtately one in the whole Caſtle; another Reaſon for it's being ſo, is becauſe of the Windows which gave Light into it. Thoſe of them that face the Eaſt are the moſt beautiful of the whole Caſtle; beſides, on the South of this Room there is an Entrance into a Sort of a Parlour or withdrawing-Room, which has a Fire Place in it; which has been a Piece of curious Workmanſhip, as is viſible to this Day; and this Place has no Communication with any Part of the Caſtle but this Room. On the North-ſide of this Room, is a Door leading into an Apartment, where ſtands a Well of a conſiderable Depth, it was 18 Yards before we touch'd the Surface of the Water; which ſeems to have been placed there on purpoſe for the more immediate Service of <hi>this Room:</hi> There are ſome little Baſons on the Top of the <hi>Well,</hi> with Pipes leading from them, which conveyed Water to different Appartments of the Caſtle; This is plain from what may be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the <hi>County Goal,</hi> at the Bottom of the Caſtle; the round ſtone Pillar in it, having an Hollow in the Middle, of a Foot wide, with a lead Spout in the Side of it.</p>
               <p>IN the Inquiſition made in the 9th of <hi>Edward</hi> 3d abovementioned, among other Things that were complained of for being neglected, one was <hi>Capella Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini Regis infra Caſtrum.</hi> This Chapel I have been told, ſtood on that Part of the Caſtle Yard, where the Moot-hall is; but upon Searching, I found it in the Caſtle itſelf according to the Account of it juſt now mentioned. The Door of it is at the Bottom of the South Wall of the Caſtle, adjoining to the Stairs which lead into the State Chamber. It has been a Work of great Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Ornament, and is ſtill in the midſt of Duſt and Darkneſs, by far the moſt beautiful Place in the whole Building; the Inſide of it being curiouſly adorned with Arches and Pillars. It is eaſy to obſerve the different Parts of it, the <hi>Entrance,</hi> the <hi>Body of it,</hi> and the <hi>Chancel;</hi> on the left Side of the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance you go into a dark little Room, which undoubtedly was the Veſtry. The full Length of it is 15 Yards, the Breadth of it is 6 Yards and half. It had 3 or 4 Windows towards the Eaſt, which are now all filled up, nor is there any Light but what comes in at a little Cranny in the Wall.</p>
               <p>Nicholas de Byker <hi>Tenet terras ſuas ut faciat diſtrictiones ad Ward' Novi Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelli ſuper Tynam faciend' &amp; pro deb' Domini Regis inter Tynam &amp; Cocket, &amp;c.</hi> And then my Authority goes on to ſay, that the Manour of <hi>Byker</hi> was Sir <hi>Ralph Lawſon</hi>'s Knight, deceaſed, after of <hi>Henry Lawſon,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> his Son, and now of his eldeſt Son, who without all Queſtion is Bailiff by Inheritance of the ſaid Caſtle, and is to levy theſe Caſtle-ward Cornage, and other Rents, Iſſues, Fines, and Amerciaments, belonging to the ſaid Caſtle. And as he goes on, the Conſtable of the Caſtle, when that Office is ſettled, may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point the learned Stewards to keep Courts, and then the Officers for the ſaid Caſtle will be compleat. Beſides the Rents above-mentioned, a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Houſes, Yards, and Gardens paid to it.</p>
               <p>IN the 17th of <hi>James</hi> I. 1619, a Grant was made of the Scite and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſnes of the Caſtle to <hi>Alexander Stephenſon,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who was ſucceeded by one <hi>Patrick Black,</hi> who died, and left it in the Poſſeſſion of his Wife. After that one <hi>James Langton,</hi> Gent. claimed <hi>Patrick Black</hi>'s Right, but by Virtue of what is not known.</p>
               <p>THE Liberties and Privileges of the Caſtle extends Northwards to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Tweed,</hi> and Southward to the River of <hi>Tees.</hi>

                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0583000100:132"/>IT is reported, that underneath that Houſe which was anciently the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Goal, is a <hi>Vault</hi> which leads to the Caſtle. There is indeed a large Door ſtill to be ſeen, which perhaps was the Entrance into it; and Mr. <hi>George Grey,</hi> the preſent Poſſeſſor of the Houſe, told me that it was certainly ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had put down thro' his own Floor a Bailiff's Rod to the very End, and could find no Bottom.</p>
               <p>A Manuſcript I have often had Occaſion to mention gives us the following Account of the Caſtle-Yard.</p>
               <p>THE Way thro' the Yard begins at the <hi>Caſtle-Yate,</hi> and when I was young, there was no Houſes in it but the Houſe of one <hi>Thomas Southern,</hi> and the Houſe of one <hi>Green;</hi> theſe Houſes were near the Gate before you came into the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle-yard; and there was in the Garth a Houſe, wherein the <hi>Goaler</hi> of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle dwelt, and a Houſe wherein <hi>William Robinſon</hi> dwelt, who was Deputy Herrald under <hi>Norroy, King at Arms.</hi> This Man wrote in a Book the Arms of all the Mayors of this Town, from <hi>Laurentius Acton,</hi> until his Time. And when I was Chamberlain of the Town, which was about the Time of Sir <hi>Nicholas Cole</hi>'s being Mayor in the Year 1640, it was then in the Town's Chamber; when <hi>Trollop</hi> built the <hi>Town-Court,</hi> he borrow'd it, but would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver reſtore it.</p>
               <p>THESE were all the Houſes at that Time; but ſince then Mr. <hi>Bulmer,</hi> he took a Garth behind his Houſe in the <hi>Side,</hi> and built a Stable in it, and had a Garden in it; and alſo <hi>George Hayroy</hi> took from thence to the <hi>Moat-hall,</hi> and built Houſes upon it: He was a Butcher, but not a Freeman, and theſe took their Lands and Houſes of <hi>Alexander Stephenſon,</hi> a Scottiſh Man, who came in with King <hi>James,</hi> for he begg'd the Caſtle of the King. He was one of his Cloſe-Stool. This Man began to build the Caſtle-Gate, but it was finiſhed by one <hi>John Pickle,</hi> who made it in the Faſhion it is now, and kept a Tavern in it; and then one <hi>Jordan</hi> a Scotſman and <hi>Sword-Kipper,</hi> built the Houſe on the South-ſide of the Gate, and lived in it; and <hi>Thomas Reed,</hi> a Scotch Pedlar, took a Shop in the North-ſide of the Gate.</p>
               <p>AT preſent there are a good many Shops and Houſes belonging to it, in and about it.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HIS Street is from the Head of it, to the <hi>Stairs</hi> on the left Hand, a very great deſcent, and lies narrow, untill you come to the middle of it, from which Place it opens in a ſpacious Breadth, and ſo continues to the <hi>Sandhill.</hi> It is from the one end to the other fill'd with Shops of <hi>Merchants, Goldſmiths, Milliners, Uphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> &amp;c. The Eaſt-ſide of this Street, from the Upper Part of it to <hi>All-hallow Pant,</hi> was called <hi>Cordiner,</hi> or <hi>Cordwainer Rawe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>ABOVE the middle of the Street are Stairs leading up to the Caſtle-yard, which was the Eaſtern-Poſtern of the Caſtle, and after called the Waſte of <hi>Laurentius Acton,</hi> as appears from the Account of <hi>Gunner Tower;</hi> and our Towns-man, <hi>Grey,</hi> ſays, that in the Middle of this Street is an antient <hi>Stone-Houſe,</hi> an Appendix to the Caſtle, which in former Times belonged to the Lord <hi>Lumley,</hi> before the Caſtle was built, or at leaſt coetany with the Caſtle.</p>
                  <p>ON the other Side of this Street, oppoſite to the Waſte now mentioned, is a <hi>Corner Shop,</hi> which formerly belong'd to a Chantery in St. <hi>John</hi>'s Church. On the ſame Side of this Street, almoſt oppoſite to this Eaſtern-Poſtern of the Caſtle, is a ſhort narrow Lane, (which formerly ſeems to have gone by the Name of <note n="a" place="margin">Vide Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-Tower.</note> 
                     <hi>Swinburn-place</hi>) which leads by Stairs into a dark narrow Lane which faces the <hi>Painter Heugh</hi> that leads into <hi>Pilgrim-ſtreet.</hi> On the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of this Lane there was a Place called <note n="b" place="margin">Vide Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-Tower.</note> 
                     <hi>Pencher Place,</hi> perhaps the whole Lane was called ſo. It goes as far as the <hi>Nether-dean-bridge,</hi> under which is now a Ware-houſe of Mr. <hi>James Moncaſter,</hi> Merchant. Under this I am

told the <hi>Rings</hi> are ſtill to be ſeen that the <hi>Boats</hi> were faſtned to, which brought up the Merchant Goods, when the Merchants had their Shops in the <hi>Fleſh-market.</hi> On the South it leads to the Side.</p>
                  <p>THE Pant ſtanding near the Shop of Mr. <hi>Robert Makepeice,</hi> is undoubted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that which went by the Name of <hi>All-Hallow-Pant;</hi> The other Side of the Street from <hi>All-Hallow-Pant</hi> to the <hi>Cale-Croſs,</hi> was formerly divided by the coming up of the River, which was called <hi>Lorkburn,</hi> and the Eaſt of it had the Name of <hi>Fleſher-Raw:</hi> becauſe I ſuppoſe the Butchers had their Shops there, as well as on the <hi>Butcher-Bank:</hi> The Weſt bore the Name of the <hi>Side.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, <hi>Lorkburn</hi> was cover'd with Flags at the Top, and made one Street, which all goes by the Name of the Side. In the Year 1696 <hi>Lorkburn</hi> was arch'd at the Top, and pav'd over.</p>
                  <p>WE come now to the <hi>Cale-Croſs,</hi> ſo called becauſe of the <hi>Cale</hi> or <hi>Broth</hi> which was ſold there in former Times. This ſeems to have been it's original Name, for I meet with it in the Reign of King <hi>Richard</hi> the Second, as may be ſeen in the Account of <hi>St. Margaret</hi>'s Chantery in <hi>St. Nicholas,</hi> and alſo in a Writing dated <hi>Edward</hi> the Third. What <hi>Grey</hi> ſays of it is ſtill juſt, that it is a fair Croſs, with Columns of Stone Hewn, covered with Lead: There is at the Top of it a Ciſtern which holds the <hi>New-Water.</hi> Here is ſold Milk, Eggs, Cheeſe, Butter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>Sandhill</hi> is ſo called, becauſe it was formerly a <hi>Hill</hi> of <hi>naked Sand,</hi> when the Tide was out. For formerly the <hi>Tyne</hi> overflowed all this Place. After it was taken in it became Part of the Town: That Part of it on the Weſt-ſide of <hi>Lorkburn,</hi> was a Place of Pleaſure and Recreation for the Townſ-People. For in the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the 2d, a Proclamation was made, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding to remove all Merchandiſe from a certain <hi>Common Place,</hi> in <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> called <hi>Sandhill,</hi> where the Inhabitants were wont to aſſemble for their Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>IT is a ſpacious Place, and adorned with Buildings very high and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, whoſe Rooms ſpeak the <hi>Ancient Grandeur,</hi> being very large and Magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent.

                  </p>
                  <p>THIS Building, as to its Form and Model, is of great Beauty, and withal very ſumptuous. That Part of it, which is the <hi>Court</hi> itſelf, is a very ſtately <hi>Hall,</hi> whoſe lofty Cicling is adorn'd with various Painting, and its Floor laid with checker'd Marble. On the <hi>Eaſt end</hi> of it is a Dial, and the Entrance into the <hi>Merchants Court.</hi> On the Weſt are the <hi>Benches,</hi> where the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates ſit, raiſed conſiderably above the Floor of the <hi>Court,</hi> above which are the Pictures of King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and King <hi>James</hi> II. large as the Life. On the North a Gallery for Spectators; and on the South the Windows, which are very pretty, particularly that Window which is a <hi>Katharine-Wheel,</hi> in which is a large Sun-dial of painted Glaſs, with this Motto, <hi>Eheu Fugaces!</hi> Under this is a large <hi>Balcony,</hi> which overlooks the River. Here it is that the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Sheriff</hi> keep their Courts, and the Judges at <hi>Lammas</hi> hold the Aſſize. Here is kept the <hi>Guilds,</hi> the Court of <hi>Admiralty,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>ON the North-ſide of this <hi>Hall</hi> is a magnificent Entrance into a Paſſage, which leads into a large Room called the <hi>Town's Chamber.</hi> Here it is that the <hi>Mayor</hi> tranſacts the common Buſineſs of the Town. Here the Common Council is held, where the <hi>Mayor</hi> ſits on a Bench diſtinguiſhable from the others, the Aldermen on each Side of him, the Common Council below upon Chairs placed on each Side the Room, and ſeparated from the Benches, as the Court itſelf is ſeparated from the Benches there. And here upon the Days of <hi>Rejoicing,</hi> the <hi>State Holidays,</hi> the Mayor not long ago entertained the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates</hi> and <hi>Burgeſſes</hi> with a Banquet of Wine, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to which they were wont to come from the <hi>Mayor</hi>'s <hi>Houſe</hi> with great Pomp and Solemnity.

Braſs Weights according to the Stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>art were ſent to this Town.

                     <pb n="126" facs="tcp:0583000100:137"/>BEFORE I leave this Street, I muſt by no Means omit the Effigies of King <hi>James</hi> II. which ſtood here, as I have been told, on that Side of the Bull-ring next the Court-ſtairs. By the Account I have had (for I never ſaw the Statue itſelf, nor the Picture of it) it muſt have been a very curious Work. The King's Picture on Horſeback was caſt in <hi>Copper</hi> large as the Life; the Horſe ſtood upon his Hind-Feet, raiſed upon a Pedeſtal of <hi>white Marble,</hi> which was ſurrounded with <hi>Iron-Pales.</hi> It coſt the Town 1700 <hi>l.</hi> and was confeſs'd the moſt beautiful and curious of its Kind that was in the whole Kingdom. Certainly it was a great Ornament to the Town, and 'tis therefore great Pity it is not ſtill in Being, tho' it was the Statue of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate King. But there is no Bounds to the heady Proceedings of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Mob; it drives all before it, without either Reaſon or Reflection, and bears no Regard to Things either Civil or religious. Such a one I am told was this, that pull'd down the <hi>noble Statue;</hi> a few Soldiers, as drunk with Loyalty as with Liquor, aſſiſted by the buſy hot-headed Genius of <hi>Sandgate,</hi> having provided Ropes for that Purpoſe, pull'd it down, dragg'd it from thence to the <hi>Key,</hi> and threw it into the <hi>River.</hi> This was in the Year 1688; it was afterwards taken up again, and Part of it caſt into a Set of Bells, which now belong to <hi>All-Hallows</hi> in this Town.</p>

                  <p>ON the Eaſt of this Street is the Entrance to the <hi>Key-ſide,</hi> which ſhall be ſpoken hereafter. On the <hi>Weſt</hi> is the <hi>Cloſe,</hi> to which as you go along, you paſs by the <hi>North-ſide of the Chapel of St.</hi> Thomas <hi>the Martyr;</hi> and on the other Side oppoſite to this <hi>Chapel,</hi> an ancient Houſe which is ſaid to be built by <hi>Richard de Emmeldon,</hi> Mayor of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> for three Prieſts to pray for his Soul. I take it to be nigh thoſe Stairs which lead up to the <hi>Half-Moon,</hi> the ancient outward Fortification.</p>
                  <p>FROM hence going on ſtill Weſtward, you croſs over the North-end of the <hi>Tine-bridge,</hi> and ſo paſs into the Street called the <hi>Cloſs.</hi> It anſwers its Name exactly well, for it is but narrow and cloſe too. It was formerly that Part of the Town where the principal Inhabitants liv'd, Sir <hi>John Marly,</hi> Sir <hi>William Blacket,</hi> Sir <hi>Mark Milbank;</hi> and the Houſes of many other Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of Figure are ſtill remembred by the ancient Inhabitants. And indeed however the Street itſelf may be, however mean the Fronts of the Houſes are, within they ſpeak Magnificence and Grandeur, the Rooms being very large and ſtately, and for the moſt Part adorn'd with curious <hi>Carving.</hi> The Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi>'s Houſe was in this Street; it was that Houſe which has at its Entrance a <hi>great Gate,</hi> beſides which there is a large round Ball of Stone, the Houſe on this Side Mr. <hi>Thorp Stewart</hi>'s. In the lower Part of this Building, towards the Water, are very manifeſt Tokens of its Antiquity</p>
                  <p>OF late Years theſe Houſes have been forſaken, and their wealthier Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants have choſen the higher Parts of the Town.</p>
                  <p>ON the right Hand as you enter the Street from the <hi>Tine-Bridge,</hi> are Stairs which lead into the <hi>Caſtle-yard,</hi> which were the <hi>Southern Poſtern</hi> of the Caſtle, and are called the <hi>Caſtle-ſtairs.</hi> On the ſame Side a little further along, are <hi>other Stairs,</hi> which are called the <hi>Long Stairs,</hi> which lead up to the <hi>Bailiff-Gate, Backraw, Caſtle-yard, Side,</hi> &amp;c. almoſt oppoſite to which is a ſmall
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0583000100:138"/>
                     <hi>Key,</hi> called <hi>Javel-Gripp.</hi> Somewhat further along are <hi>other Stairs</hi> on the ſame Side of the Street, leading to <hi>Weſt-gate,</hi> which are called <hi>Tudhill-Stairs.</hi> Perhaps it is not amiſs to tell you what I have been ſomewhere inform'd of, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Name of it ſhould be <hi>Tout-hill,</hi> from the touting or winding of a Horn upon it, when an Enemy was at Hand. What makes me the more incline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to believe this Tradition to be true, is, that Cornage was paid to the Caſtle, as may be ſeen in our Account of it. Now <hi>Cornage</hi> comes from the Word <hi>Cornagium,</hi> (from <hi>Cornu</hi> a Horn) and was a Kind of grand Serjeanty: The Service of which Tenure was to blow a Horn, when any Invaſion of the <hi>Scots</hi> was perceived; and by this many Men held their Land Northward, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the <hi>Picts Wall. Cambd. Britan.</hi> 609 Pag. and <hi>Littleton,</hi> Fol. 35.</p>
                  <p>ALMOST oppoſite to theſe Stairs is the Houſe of the Mayors of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> where they reſide during the Year of their Mayoralty. It is a Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grand and ſtately; and conſidering the Place it ſtands in, is very orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental. As the Mayors of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> have ſuch continual Buſineſs at Court, tho' the Situation is not ſo pleaſing as that of the upper Part of the Town, it is yet more advantageous, as it is nigher the Court.</p>
                  <p>BEYOND this Houſe a little Way, ſtill going on Weſtward, is the Gate belonging to this Street, called the <hi>Cloſe-Gate.</hi> The Town-wall deſcends from the <hi>Weſt-Friar Tower,</hi> down a dangerous Pair of Stairs, upon a very ſteep Bank, to this Gate, from which it goes Southward to the Water-ſide, where is an old Tower, now the Hall of the Sail-makers.</p>
                  <p>WITHOUT this <hi>Cloſe</hi> Gate is a Way to the <hi>Forth,</hi> a Place of Recreation.</p>
                  <p>IN the <hi>Cloſe</hi> were many Houſes, which pay an annual Rent to the Maſter and Brethren of St. <hi>Mary</hi> the Virgin.</p>
                  <p>THIS Street is commemorated in many ancient Writings for a Mill, which (in ancient Times, long before theſe were drawn) was wont to ſtand upon the <hi>Hoga,</hi> that is, upon the <hi>Bank</hi> without the <hi>Cloſe-Gate.</hi> In a Grant from the Maſter and Brethren of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s in <hi>Weſt-gate,</hi> it is permitted to the Parties concern'd, that they have <hi>quandam placeam terrae in Vico quoe voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur</hi> le Cloſs, <hi>ſicut ſe extendit in longitudine de Hoga, ubi</hi> antiquum molidinum <hi>ſolebat ſtare, uſque ad aquam</hi> Tinae, &amp; <hi>quantum de</hi> Tina <hi>acquirere poterit.</hi>

                           <hi>The Bridge is of great Antiquity, undoubtedly as old as the Times of the</hi> Romans. <hi>There muſt have been a Communication between this and the other Side of the River; and therefore there was a Neceſſity for it.

And it is the common Opinion, that there has been a military Way from <hi>Cheſter</hi> to <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> this Way tends towards the Place where the Bridge now is. There muſt then have been a Bridge in the <hi>Roman</hi> Times over the River <hi>Tine,</hi> near the Place where the preſent Bridge ſtands.</p>

                     <hi>Tine</hi>-Bridge, let us now return and conſider it a little. It has been a Query, whether the Bridge was originally of Wood or Stone; but I think it is altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; all the Bridges in <hi>England</hi> were originally of Wood. In the Reign of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0583000100:139"/>
                     <hi>Richard</hi> I. <hi>Philip</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> ſent to the Burgeſſes of <hi>Gate-Side</hi> a Grant of <hi>Foreſtage,</hi> in which are theſe Words: <hi>And it ſhall be lawful for every Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſs to give Wood to whomſoever he will, to be ſpent about the River of</hi> Tine, <hi>without any Licence.</hi> This I imagine has been for the building of Keys, and eſpecially for the repairing of the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Part of the Bridge, which is a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Proof, that this Bridge, which was the original one, was <hi>Wood.</hi> But what I think puts it beyond Diſpute, is, that according to <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> it was burnt in the Year 1248, together with a great Part of the Town.</p>
                  <p>AFTER this Misfortune hapned, the Town, who repairs two Thirds of the Bridge, and the <note n="h" place="margin">

                  <p>THE Archdeacon of <hi>Northumberland</hi> wrote to the Clergy of his Archdea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conry, and deſired them to aſſiſt the Work of the <hi>Bridge</hi> as much as they could, telling them, their venerable Father the Lord Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> by his Letters Patents, had commanded them without any Let or Delay, to go about the Affair of <hi>Indulgences,</hi> and that they were to prefer the Epiſcopal Indulgences to others.

                  <p>IN the 43d of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, an Inquiſition was made, whereby it was found, that the Bridge was ſo decay'd, that 1000 <hi>l.</hi> would not repair it; and that 20 Marks belongs to the ſaid Bridge, and to the <hi>Chapel of St.</hi> Thomas <hi>the Martyr,</hi> built upon the ſame, 10 whereof was paid to the Maſter of the ſaid <hi>Chapel,</hi> for himſelf, and his Clerk, and the remaining ten Marks to the Bridge Maſter Builder.</p>

                  <p>THIS Chapel was lately beautified and Pewed, and on Sunday the 10th of <hi>September</hi> 1732, (the whole Body of the Magiſtrates coming to it with the uſual Solemnities and Formalities) was ſet apart by the Corporation for a Chapel of Eaſe to the Church of St. <hi>Nicholas.</hi> The Sermon in the Morning was preached by the Rev.

                  <p>A little beyond this is a large and ſtrong Building, which <hi>Grey</hi> informs us, was built a little before the Writing of his Hiſtory, upon an Arch of the Bridge, and uſed for a <hi>Magazine</hi> for the Town. Under this are the Shops of <hi>Francis Rudſton,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Alderman, and Mr. <hi>William Sorsby.</hi> There is very viſible above this Gate-way, the Remains of a Port Cullice. After the <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> the Picture of King <hi>Charles</hi> the 2d, was ſet up on the South ſide of this Buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, with this Motto under it, <hi>Adventus Regis, Solamen Gregis; The coming of the King, is the Comfort of the People.</hi> It was wont to look exceedingly beautiful, and in coming along the Bridge from the South, was a very wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and conſpicuous Ornament to the Town; but of late it is pretty much obſcur'd with Duſt, if not defac'd with the Weather, through the Want of being put into a little Order and Regularity.</p>
                  <p>ON the North-ſide of this Building is an Account of it's being repair'd in the Year 1713. <hi>Henry Reay,</hi>

                  <p>AFTER you come from under the Gateway of the <hi>Magazine,</hi> there is an <hi>open</hi> on the Bridge on either Side. Over the one of theſe it was that ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Accident happened to Mr. <hi>Anderſon,</hi> a Merchant and Alderman this
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0583000100:143"/>
Town: As he was looking over the Bridge talking with a Friend, he finger'd a Ring he had on (as People frequently do when they are thoughtful) which before he was aware, fell into the River, and was given entirely over for loſt. Sometime after one of his Servants having bought a Salmon in the Market, found the very Ring in the Belly of the Fiſh, and reſtored it to his Maſter. <hi>Herodotus</hi> gives the like Account in the 3d Book of <hi>Polycrates</hi> King of <hi>Samos,</hi> who was at that Time eſteem'd one of the Favourites of Fortune, which as my Authority obſerves, may ſatisfy us of the Truth of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſaying, <hi>There is no new Thing under the Sun.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS Gentleman was Mayor of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and was Anceſtor of the preſent Mr. <hi>Abraham Anderſon</hi> Merchant, on the <hi>Sandhill.</hi> The ſaid <hi>Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Anderſon</hi> made his Eſtate to his Son <hi>Henry Anderſon,</hi> who was the Father of the ſaid <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Grandfather. The Eſtate and Ring have been in the Family ever ſince, and are now in the Poſſeſſion of the ſaid <hi>Abraham.</hi> I my ſelf ſaw this <hi>Ring</hi> about 4 Months ago. The Impreſſion the Seal gives is that of <hi>Soloman</hi> and the Queen of <hi>Sheba.</hi> On the Inſide of the Ring, juſt under the Signet, is the Picture of a <hi>Salmon,</hi> in Commemoration of the Fiſh and the Tranſaction, on the one Side of which is the Letter <hi>F,</hi> and on the other the Letter <hi>R,</hi> in Commemoration of the <hi>Perſon.</hi> It is a Curioſity ſo great, that not only the whole Kingdom can't ſhow the like of it; but the whole World beſide, nay the World itſelf never, that we know of, had the like Tranſaction but once before, <hi>viz.</hi> that before-mentioned. The Gentleman therefore who has this valuable Jewel in his Poſſeſſion, ought to have the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Care of it upon many Accounts, and as none of the leaſt, that it is a Credit to his Family, as well as to the Town.</p>
                  <p>A little further, about the middle of the Bridge is a large old Tower, which they call the Tower of the Bridge, where leud and diſorderly Perſons are kept 'till they are examined by the Mayor, and brought to due Puniſhment, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the Crime be of a very groſs Nature, and then are removed to <hi>Newgate</hi> and there continue 'till the Aſſizes. Beyond this a little is the <hi>Blue-Stone,</hi> which gives the Name of the <hi>Blue-Stone</hi> to that Part of the Bridge. Here is the Bounds of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Southwards. Beyond this, the other Part of the Bridge belongs to the County Palatine of <hi>Durham,</hi> and is repaired by the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> At the End of the Bridge, which leads into <hi>Gateſide,</hi> is another <hi>Tower,</hi> where has been a <hi>Draw-bridge.</hi>

                  <p>ABOVE when I mentioned the <hi>Sandhill,</hi> I took Notice, that on the Eaſt it leads to the <hi>Key-ſide,</hi> which is a long <hi>Wharf</hi> or <hi>Key</hi> for Ships and other Veſſels. It is built upon the <hi>Sand,</hi> as indeed all the lower Parts of the Town have been. Through this Street goes the remaining Part of the <hi>Town-wall,</hi> which is continued from the Eaſt-end of the <hi>Merchants Court</hi> to <hi>Sand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate Gate,</hi> which make in ſome Manner <hi>two Streets,</hi> the Inſide and Outſide of the <hi>Key.</hi> On the Top of this <hi>Wall</hi> is a <hi>Walk</hi> along it, as is along the <hi>other Walls</hi> of the <hi>Town;</hi> and at the Bottom of it are a great many <hi>Gates,</hi> which are called <hi>Water-gates.</hi> Theſe in the Reign of King <hi>James</hi> I. <hi>Anno</hi> 1616, were ordered to be locked up every Night, except one or two to ſtand open, for the Maſters and Seamen to go to and fro to their Ships. This was done, to prevent Servants caſting Aſhes and other Rubbiſh into the River; and thoſe two Gates were watched all Night long.</p>

                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0583000100:144"/>THIS Key extends in Length from Eaſt to Weſt 103 Rods.</p>
                  <p>THIS Street is chiefly inhabited by ſuch as have their Living by Shipping, ſuch as Merchants, <hi>Hoſtmen, Brewars,</hi> &amp;c. As it is the great Place of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort for the Buſineſs of the <hi>Coal-trade</hi> (the grand Support of this Town and Country, and many other Places alſo) and likewiſe for many other Things; it is not much to be wondred at, if in going along it, you ſee almoſt, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a whole Street of Sign-poſts of Taverns, Ale-houſes, Coffee-houſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AFTER you paſs the <hi>Cuſtom-houſe,</hi> where the King's Cuſtoms are received, which is at the <hi>Weſt-end</hi> of this Street, as you go along eaſtward, you meet with a great many narrow <hi>Chairs</hi> or <hi>Lanes.</hi> Theſe have ſo many Times changed their Names, and in all Probability will ſo often do it, that it is to little Purpoſe at preſent to mention them. There is however <hi>Grundon-Chair,</hi> which I meet with in a Writing of ſeveral hundred Years old; as alſo the Name of the <hi>Broad Chair,</hi> of a very ancient Standing, and the Name of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a Writing, drawn in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. which, had it been worth remembring, would in all Probability have been forgot long before now. But which of the others went formerly by the Names of <hi>Brown-Chair,</hi> the Chair of <hi>Nicholas de Salicibus, Tod's Chair, Norham Chair, Philip's Chair, Shipman Chair, Oliver Chair, Galway Chair,</hi> we are altogether in the dark. There is one more ancient Name of a <hi>Chair</hi> in this Street, which is the <hi>Kirk-Chair,</hi> or the Way or Lane they generally went to Church by from the <hi>Key<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide.</hi> This I take to be that Chair, which now goes by the Name of <hi>Fen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick</hi>'s Entry, becauſe its Situation anſwers ſo exactly to the <hi>Church-yard,</hi> the Top of this Chair being almoſt upon a Line with the Stairs that lead up to the Church. This Lane is much the neateſt of the whole Street, having in it ſeveral <hi>good Houſes,</hi> which are kept in a different Order from the Generality of the Houſe in thoſe narrow Lanes. In the upper Part of it is the Dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling-houſe of <hi>Cuthbert Fenwick,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Alderman of this Town, who is the Proprietor of the whole Entry.</p>
                  <p>AT the <hi>Key</hi> itſelf is a very ſafe Station for Ships, where they lye free and ſecure from the greateſt Dangers of Wind and Water, where they unload their Wares and Commodities, their <hi>Wood, Deal;</hi> and by a <hi>Crane,</hi> their <hi>Wines, Flax,</hi> and all heavier Commodities.</p>

               <p>
                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING done with what was anciently called <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> we come now to deſcribe the ancient Town of <hi>Pampedon,</hi> which was a Town of itſelf diſtinct from <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> but was united to it in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> I. <hi>Vide anno</hi> 1299. There is ſome Doubt about the Reaſon of the Name, ſome imagining it came from <hi>Pandana,</hi> one of the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> which was ſo called, <hi>quia ſemper paterit,</hi> becauſe <hi>it ſtood always open.</hi> But I dare ſay, this could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver give Name to the Town of <hi>Pandon,</hi> which being in all Probability a <hi>Roman</hi> Place of Defence, was rather obliged to be always ſhut. Others imagine it came from <hi>Pandara,</hi> a <hi>Scottiſh Virgin Saint;</hi> but for what Reaſon they know beſt. For my Part I never ſaw one yet; and perhaps for good Reaſon. For if I miſtake not, this Town had the Name of <hi>Pandon,</hi> before there ever was <hi>a Saint in that Kingdom.</hi> I am therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to believe, that it got its Name from the <hi>Romans</hi> who lived in it, who, as <hi>Grey</hi> agrees, called it <hi>Pampedon</hi> or <hi>Pantheon,</hi> becauſe perhaps ſome Building was erected here in this Place, in Imitation of the <hi>Pantheon</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi> (this Wall being the utmoſt Confines of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire) which was built in Honour of all the Gods. And as this Wall was the utmoſt Bounds of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> therefore there might be ſuch a <hi>Temple</hi> in this Place, to remind the <hi>Romans</hi> of the neceſſary Aſſiſtance of all the Gods, to preſerve the Bounds of the <hi>Roman Empire.</hi> The late <note n="l" place="margin">Rom. Brit. <hi>p.</hi> 131.</note> Mr. <hi>Horſley</hi> will have the latter Syllable of this Word to come from the Word <hi>Deen,</hi> which ſignifies a <hi>Hollow,</hi> or a <hi>Brook,</hi> becauſe ſuch is the Place. But with this I cannot agree; the <hi>Deen</hi> could not have that Weight with it, as to give Name to the whole Place; or ſhould that be allowed, how is the former Part of the Name accounted for? It retains therefore (as <hi>Grey</hi> juſtly obſerves) its Name, without much Alteration, ſince the <hi>Romans</hi> reſided in it. After the Departure of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, as the ſame Authority gives out, the Kings of <hi>Northumberland</hi> kept their Reſidence in it, and had their Houſe now called <hi>Pandon-Hall.</hi> It was a ſafe Bulwark, having the <hi>Picls Wall</hi> on the North-ſide, and the River <hi>Time</hi> on the South. This Place of <hi>Pandon</hi> is of ſuch Antiquity, that if a Man would expreſs an ancient Thing, it is a common <hi>Proverb, As old as</hi> Pandon-<hi>Gate.</hi> Thus far this Author.</p>

                  <head>Sect. I. <hi>Of the</hi> MANOUR-CHARE.</head>
                  <p>BUT to treat of ſome Particulars of this ancient Town, we ſhall begin then at the <hi>Manour-Chare,</hi> which leads from <hi>Pilgrim-ſtreet</hi> to St. <hi>Auſtin Fryers.</hi> This Chare which leads from <hi>Pilgrim-ſtreet</hi> to <hi>Jeſus Hoſpital,</hi> and from thence to the Head of the <hi>Broad-Chare,</hi> was in ancient Times called <hi>Cowgate.</hi> This is plain from an ancient Writing in the Poſſeſſion of Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Waters,</hi> in <hi>Pilgrim-ſtreet,</hi> dated <hi>Feb.</hi> 20, in the 5th Year of <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th, where are theſe Words, deſcribing the Situation of the Houſe he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes at preſent: <hi>Prout jacet in vico Peregrinorum infra villam Novicaſtri ſuper Tynam inter Tenementum nuper Laurentii de Acton ex parte Boreali, &amp; Tenementum nuper Thomae Clerk, ex parte Auſtrali, &amp; extendit in Longitudine a via Regia ante, uſque vicum quondam vocatum</hi> Cowgate, <hi>modo vocatum</hi> Auſtyn-Chare, <hi>retro.</hi> In the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 4th it had the Name of <hi>Auſtyn-Chare,</hi> as appears al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo from this Writing: Now it has the Name of <hi>Manour-Chare</hi> which ſome imagine to be given from the Word Minor or Minorites, or Franciſcans; but unleſs they can prove that the <hi>Fryery</hi> of the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> was ſituated here, they never can prove that the Chare was ſo called from them; and this is ſcarce poſſible to be done. For we have already ſhewn that the <hi>Minorites</hi> or <hi>Franciſcans</hi> had their Houſe in another Part of the Town, <hi>viz.</hi> in the <hi>High-Fryar-Chare;</hi> this is alſo clearly proved from the ſeveral Writings of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of Taylors, that this Place was formerly called <hi>Cowgate,</hi> and afterwards called the <hi>Frear-Chare,</hi> or St. <hi>Auſtin Frear-Chare.</hi> Theſe Writings of theirs alſo mention an Alms-houſe, which went by the Name of <hi>Ward</hi>'s Alms-houſe, ſituated in this Chare, I ſuppoſed it was ſituated at the Bottom of Mr. <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi>'s Garden, for I have heard ſome old People ſay, they remember thereabouts the Ruins of an Alms-houſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cowgate</hi> the ancient Name of the Street, is ſtill continued in one Part of it, <hi>viz.</hi> from the Foot of <hi>Silver-ſtreet,</hi> to the Head of the <hi>Broad-Chare.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HAVING come down this Lane from <hi>Pilgrim-ſtreet,</hi> we come to three different Ways; that on the Right leads down into <hi>Pandon;</hi> that on the Front leads into the <hi>Town</hi>'s <hi>Hoſpital;</hi> and that on the Left, into St. <hi>Auſtin-Fryers,</hi> and <hi>Carliol-Croft.</hi>

                  <p>THE left-hand Paſſage has ſtill the Remains of a large Gate, which has been one of the Gates leading to St. <hi>Auſtin-Fryers,</hi> which, (having paſt this Gate) is a little above upon the Right Hand.

ſpeak of ſome ſumptuous Additions that were made to it. In ſucceeding A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ſays he, it was inlarged and beautified with ſtately Buildings, Cloyſters, and a Fair Church. The Kings of <hi>England</hi> ſince the Conqueſt, kept Houſe in it, whence they came with an Army Royal againſt <hi>Scotland;</hi> and ſince the Suppreſſion of Monaſteries, made a Magazine and Store-houſe for the North Parts. Now of late that Princely Fabrick is demoliſhed, and laid level with the Ground. The Pride, Covetouſneſs, Luxury and Idolatry of theſe Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes brought a ſudden Ruin upon themſelves and Houſes.</p>
                  <p>THE ſame Authority tells us alſo, that there was an antient Religious Houſe founded by the Kings of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and that ſeveral of them were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried here; but it cannot be true that they built any Thing for the St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin</hi> Fryers, for they came not into <hi>England</hi> 'till long after the Conqueſt, in the Year 1252. Then it was that <hi>Lanfrank</hi> of <hi>Milan,</hi> the firſt General of the <hi>Eremites</hi> of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> ſent ſome of them into <hi>England</hi> to ſeek a Dwelling for themſelves. The <hi>Auguſtin</hi> Fryers held their firſt Houſe given them in <hi>Wales,</hi> at a Place called <hi>Wood-houſe</hi> which before had belonged to the Family of the noble Family of the <hi>Turburvills.</hi> Afterward <hi>Humphry Bohun,</hi> Earl of <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford</hi> and <hi>Eſſex,</hi> in the Year of our Lord 1253, gave them a Houſe and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Church, remarkable for a Spire of wonderful Workmanſhip, in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> which is now partly a Meeting-houſe for the German Proteſtants who have ſettled in <hi>London.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anno</hi> 1377, the <hi>Auguſtin</hi> Fryers obtained Leave to eat Fleſh, upon Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that they ſhould keep the Faſt of the Fryers Minors before Chriſtmas. <hi>Stephen. ad. Vol.</hi> 2d. 221.</p>
                  <p>WHAT Year this Houſe was founded in, or this Order came to this Houſe, I have no where met with, but the <hi>Auguſtines</hi> are ſaid to have been founded by the Lord <hi>Roſs,</hi> 
                     <note n="m" place="margin">De rebus Novocaſt'.</note> the Baron of <hi>Werk,</hi> which I am inclinable to believe very true, for in the 11th of <hi>Edward</hi> the Second, 1317. I find mention made of ſome Lands in <hi>Cowgate,</hi> belonging to the Brethren of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which were given them by <hi>William Roſs</hi> who was Baron of <hi>Werk.</hi> How much earlier than this King's Reign this Monaſtery was founded, I have not been able to learn. But it's probable it was ſometime in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 1ſt, and this I think is out of Diſpute now, for ſince this Conjecture of my own, I received a Letter from the Rev. Mr. <hi>Wearing,</hi> of <hi>Bampton</hi> in <hi>Weſtmoreland,</hi> with the following <hi>Account.</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, in the 19th Year of his Reign, gave Leave to one <hi>John de Capella,</hi> to give and aſſign a Meſſuage of his in <hi>Penrith,</hi> to the Prior and Fryers of the Order of St. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> in the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THEY ſurrendred on the 9th of <hi>Jan.</hi> 30 <hi>Hen.</hi> 8.</p>

                  <p>THIS Houſe is now turned partly into a Work-houſe, for the Employment of the Poor; Part of it is turned into a Houſe of Correction, a Dunghill, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here is the Charity-School of the Pariſh of <hi>All Hallows,</hi> which was built <hi>Anno</hi> 1723, and an Houſe for the Maſter to live in, which was built the ſame Year.</p>
                  <p>THE Bells of <hi>All Hallows</hi> were caſt in this Place, which ſince the Decay of the <hi>Monaſtery,</hi> was called rhe <hi>Artillery-yard,</hi> from the Townſmens perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there the Exerciſe of the <hi>Pike</hi> and <hi>Gun.</hi>

                  <p>BEFORE I have done with this Monaſtery, it may not be amiſs to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a Paſſage in <hi>Milbank</hi>'s Manuſcript, which came to my Hands ſince the compiling of this Antiquity. The Author of it ſays, "When I was young,

It was ſo called, becauſe in former Times, when the Tide flow'd up to the <hi>Stock-bridge,</hi> there was thereabout a <hi>Hill of Sand,</hi> which at the Tide's leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, appeared like an Iſland. They call it at preſent <hi>Alvey</hi>'s Iſland, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it belong'd to one of that Name. It is the very Place, on which ſtands the <hi>Houſe, Cellars,</hi> and <hi>Malting</hi> of Mr. <hi>George Hinkſter,</hi> which are bounded on the Weſt, North and South by the King's Street, and on the Eaſt by a waſte Piece of Ground, of the Lady <hi>Goldsburgh,</hi> which was formerly called <hi>the Stones.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>OPPOSITE to the South Front of this Houſe was the ancient Building, <hi>viz. Pandon-hall,</hi> above mentioned, but now rebuilt in ſome Meaſure. There are ſtill remaining many ancient Walls and Parts of this Building; it was of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Bigneſs, having been according to Tradition, on its North-front in Length from the <hi>Stockbridge</hi> to <hi>Cowgate;</hi> and on its Weſt-front in Length from its <hi>North-weſt Corner,</hi> beyond that Lane that leads into <hi>Blyth's Nook.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IT is of great Antiquity, being built in the Times of the <hi>Heptarchy;</hi> for it was the Houſe of the Kings of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who liv'd in it, for which Reaſon it was call'd <hi>Pandon-hall.</hi>

                  <p>FROM hence we go Eaſtward unto <hi>Pandon-Bridge,</hi> which is called the <hi>Stock-Bridge.</hi> It was undoubtedly of Wood in ancient Times, tho' we meet with an Account of its being Stone, when <hi>Thomas de Carliol</hi> was Mayor, which was in <hi>Edward</hi> I. Time at lateſt. To this Place it was that the <hi>Fiſhermen</hi> brought up their Fiſh, and ſold them here, as <hi>Grey</hi> obſerves from Tradition. But to confirm this beyond the Force of Tradition; it muſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have been true, that the <hi>Fiſh-market</hi> was here, becauſe the Street you go into when you have paſt <hi>Pandon-Bridge,</hi> was formerly called <hi>Fiſher-gate.</hi> Now this is plain from an ancient Writing, which was drawn when <hi>Henry le Scot</hi> was Mayor of this Town, about the Year 1287. I ſhall give my Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority at large, becauſe there depends upon it ſome other Things beſides this.</p>
                  <p>THE Writing is a Conveyance of ſome Land which is thus deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>QUAE extendit in longitudine à communi via ſuper le Wall-Knoll, in auſtralem. Partem domûs Fratrum de monte Carmel, uſque ad communem viam quae ſolebat du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere verſus</hi> Fiſhergate, <hi>i. e.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHICH Land extends itſelf from the Street of the <hi>Wall-Knoll,</hi> to the South-ſide of the Monaſtery of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> even to the High-way, which formerly led to <hi>Fiſhergate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>NOW it is certain, this Monaſtery was at the Top of the <hi>Wall-Knoll;</hi> the Remains of it are ſtill in Being, and ſhall be by and by further conſider'd. It is alſo certain from this ancient Writing, that a Way led from the <hi>South-ſide</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Monaſtery</hi> to <hi>Fiſhergate;</hi> therefore this Street muſt be <hi>Fiſhergate,</hi> becauſe the common Way here ſpoken of could lead to no other Place. I take this common Way to have been thoſe <hi>Stairs</hi> beſide Mr. <hi>Green</hi>'s Houſe at the <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> which lead up to the <hi>Gardens</hi> there, and which, were it not a <hi>Wall,</hi> would lead directly from this Street to the Remains of this <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>AS we go along from the <hi>Stockbridge,</hi> we meet two Streets, one on the left Hand, and the other on the right. That on the left Hand is called the <hi>Wall-Knoll,</hi> which, as it is a very great Aſcent and high Hill from <hi>Fiſhergate,</hi> ſo it ſeems to me to have this Name from the <hi>Roman Wall</hi> going along it; for the Word <hi>Knoll</hi> ſignifies an <hi>Hill</hi> or <hi>Eminence,</hi> as I gather from the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Note in <hi>Cambden</hi> upon <hi>Sevenoke</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> who ſays, On the Eaſt-ſide of it ſtandeth <hi>Knowll,</hi> ſo called, becauſe it is ſeated upon a <hi>Hill.</hi> And <hi>Grey</hi> ſays alſo poſitively, that it was Part of the <hi>Picts</hi> Wall.</p>
                  <p>AT the upper End of the Street above mentioned, towards the <hi>Carpenters</hi>

                     <hi>White Fryers.</hi> The Eaſt of their Church is ſtill ſtanding, to the repairing of which <hi>Roger Thornton</hi> left in his Will two fother of Lead; this Hoſpital be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dedicated to St. <hi>Michael,</hi> gave the Name to it of St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s on the Mount.</p>
                  <p>IT is ſaid by <hi>Dugdale</hi> in his Baron. <hi>Lumley,</hi> that the <hi>Roger Thornton</hi> he is there ſpeaking of, was the Founder of the Houſe of the <hi>White Fryars</hi> in <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle.</hi> But this <hi>Roger</hi> can ſcarce be the Founder of it, for I have proved him to be the younger <hi>Roger;</hi> and it was taken Notice of above, that <hi>Roger</hi> the Elder left Two Fother of Lead to it when he died, ſo that if either of them be the Founder, it muſt be the Elder, rather than the Younger that <hi>Dugdale</hi> ſpeaks of.</p>
                  <p>BUT I believe it will be a difficult Matter, upon Examination, to prove either the Father or the Son the Founder of it, for it boaſts a greater Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: For this <hi>Domus Fratrum de Monte Carmel,</hi> is mentioned in an ancient Writing which was drawn when <hi>Henry le Scot</hi> was Mayor, about the Year 1287, in the Reign of <hi>Edward</hi> the 1ſt, as is ſaid above, and therefore it muſt at that Time have been in being; but the Elder of them was not Mayor of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> 'till 114 Years after this; ſo that it is impoſſible he ſhould be the Founder, and therefore much leſs his Son. They might, and probably they
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0583000100:153"/>
both of them were <hi>great Benefactors,</hi> or <hi>ſecond Founders</hi> to it, and ſo have been eſteemed each of them <hi>Founders</hi> themſelves.</p>
                  <p>THEY ſurrender'd at the ſame Time with the Reſt: Sometime after they ſurrender'd, King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th made a preſent of this <hi>Priory</hi> and its Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, together with ſome other Lands belonging to other religious Houſes, lying in <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne,</hi> to Sir <hi>John Greſham,</hi> Alderman of the City of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Richard Billing ford,</hi> Gent. who 21ſt of <hi>February,</hi> 2d <hi>Edward</hi> the 6th, conveyed them to <hi>William Dent,</hi> of this Town, Gentleman.

                  <p>ABOVE when we went from <hi>Fiſhergate-ſtreet,</hi> we met two Streets, that on the Left Hand we have already treated of: The other, I imagine, is that which formerly went by the Name of <hi>Croſswell-gate,</hi> which is often mentioned in ancient Writings. It is reported that the Dwelling-houſe of <hi>Roger Thornton</hi> was in this Street. Whatever Truth is in this, it is certain, that many Houſes in this Street pay an Annual Rent to the Lord <hi>Scarborough</hi> to this Day, into whoſe Family the Grand-daughter of <hi>Roger Thornton</hi> was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed. There are in this Street ſeveral <hi>Lanes</hi> or <hi>Allies,</hi> the firſt we meet with in going along from <hi>Fiſhergate,</hi> is a Place called, at preſent, <hi>Blyth</hi>'s <hi>Nook:</hi> It is built over <hi>Pandon Burne.</hi> The next is a narrow Lane leading to the <hi>Burne Bank,</hi> a Place by which <hi>Pandon Burne</hi> runs into the <hi>Tyne.</hi> It lies very low, and before the Heightning of the Ground with Ballaſt, and the Building of the <hi>Wall</hi> and <hi>Key,</hi> was often of great Hazard to the Inhabitants; once in particular a moſt melancholy accident happen'd in this Place, in the Year 1320, the 13th of <hi>Edward</hi> the 3d, the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Tyne</hi> over-flowed ſo much, that 120 <hi>Laymen,</hi> and ſeveral <hi>Prieſts,</hi> beſides Women, were drowned; and as <hi>Grey</hi> ſays, 140 Houſes were deſtroyed. <hi>Compleat Hiſt.

                  <p>WHEN we came to <hi>Pandon-Hall,</hi> we went Eaſtward into <hi>Pandon;</hi> it remains now, that we go Southward from the ſame Place. Leaving then <hi>Silver-ſtreet</hi> on the Right Hand, we come into <hi>Cowgate,</hi> which has been a Part of the Town where ſome eminent Men have lived in; ſuch as <hi>Gilbert de Cowgate, Walter de Cowgate,</hi> &amp;c. who were Men of Fortune and Eſtate. Going forward, we paſs by <hi>Blythe Nook</hi> on the Left Hand, and the <hi>Dog-Bank</hi> on the Right, and then we come to the <hi>Broad Chare;</hi> a little below the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of which, is the <hi>Trinity Houſe;</hi> which according to ſome was a <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſtry,</hi> dedicated to the <hi>Holy Trinity.</hi> This Order of the <hi>Trinity Houſe</hi> was founded by St. <hi>John de Matha</hi> and St. <hi>John de Valois,</hi> in the Year 1198, in the Popedom of <hi>Innocent</hi> III. The End of its Inſtitution was the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Captives. In the Year 1224, a Monaſtry was founded for this Order in <hi>Kent.</hi> What Time this Monaſtry of the <hi>Trinity</hi> (if there was ſuch a one) was founded in this Town, we are intirely in the Dark: Only it was ſaid by ſome, that <hi>Laurentius</hi> of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> was its Founder. If this be true, it is not improbable but it was <hi>Laurentius Acton,</hi> who was Mayor of this Town in 1435 and 1436, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WE are alſo equally at a loſs as to its Situation: For Biſhop <hi>Burnet,</hi> in his Collection of Records, <hi>P.</hi> 146, ſays, It was on the <hi>Wall-knoll,</hi> in <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> and that they ſurrender'd <hi>January</hi> 10th, 30th of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th. If it was here, I know of no Place to fix it in, but where the <hi>Carmelites</hi> were, and this could never be. I am therefore inclinable to believe, that this Monaſtry means that of the <hi>Carmelites,</hi> and through a Miſtake is called that of the <hi>Trinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT be that as it will, it is certain that this Place called the <hi>Trinity Houſe,</hi> was no <hi>Religious Houſe:</hi> For it is ſaid in our Account below, to have been called of old Time <hi>Dalton</hi>'s <hi>Place.</hi> And beſides, had it been this <hi>Religious Houſe,</hi> the Mariners could not have got Poſſeſſion of it 'till its Suppreſſion, which was on the 10th of <hi>January,</hi> 30th of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th; whereas it was conveyed to them the 20th of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, as the following Account teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies.</p>
                  <p>A Writing in the Cuſtody of the Brethren of the <hi>Trinity-Houſe,</hi> dated the 4th Day of <hi>January,</hi> the 20th of the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, which gives an Account of a Meſſuage and Garden, which was convey'd by one <hi>Ralph Heb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne,</hi> of <hi>Hebborne,</hi> of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> to the Fraternity of the Mariners. It is the Place where is now the <hi>Trinity Houſe,</hi> which was in old Time called <hi>Dalton</hi>'s <hi>Place.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN the ſame Writing it is order'd, that the aforeſaid Meſſuage, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhall be repair'd for Ever by the common Purſe of the Brotherhood; that in ſome convenient Part of it ſhould be an <hi>Hall</hi> for the <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> to meet in, at all

Times convenient, for the obſerving of their Rules, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidue of the ſame, there ſhould be certain Lodgings order'd for ſuch of the ſaid <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> as afterwards ſhould fall into Poverty, or be not able to ſuſtain themſelves: Thoſe they held during the Term of their Lives, and then were ſucceeded by others in the like neceſſitous Circumſtances. It was alſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this Writing, that within the ſaid Meſſuage, there ſhould be a Chappel and a Prieſt, to ſing and ſay Maſs, and other Divine Service therein, as ſhould be appointed by the Aldermen, and Wardens of the ſaid <hi>Fraternity,</hi> for the Time being. That the Prieſt and the ſaid poor Perſons ſo admitted, ſhould pray for the good Eſtate of the ſaid <hi>Ralph Hebborne,</hi> Maſter <hi>John Hebborne, George Hebborne,</hi> and for the Maſters Souls, and for the good Eſtate of the ſaid <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> and for the Souls of ſuch of the ſame <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> as be depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, or hereafter ſhould depart to the Mercy of God; and alſo for the Souls of <hi>John Dalton,</hi> ſometime Owner of the ſaid Meſſuage, his Anceſtors Souls, and all Chriſtian Souls.</p>
                  <p>ONE Part of this Writing was to be put in a Cheſt, belonging to the <hi>Fellowſhip,</hi> and kept by them; the other was to be kept in a Cheſt for that purpoſe, in the Veſtry of <hi>All-Hallows</hi> in this Town, in the Cuſtody of the Church-Wardens, for the Time being, for Ever.</p>
                  <p>THIS was further confirm'd to the <hi>Fraternity</hi> of the <hi>Trinity Houſe,</hi> by <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Hebborne,</hi> Son of the ſaid <hi>Ralph Hebborne,</hi> on the 9th of <hi>September,</hi> in the 16th of the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the 8th, upon the Conditions following, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Fellowſhip</hi> ſhould pay to the ſaid <hi>Thomas Hebborne,</hi> his Heirs or Aſſigns, within the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> on the Vigil of the Apoſtles, <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> in the Month of <hi>June, a Pottle of Wine,</hi> if it be demanded yearly, for Evermore. That the ſaid <hi>Thomas Hebborne</hi> ſhould be made a Brother of the <hi>Fraternity,</hi> and Partaker of all Maſſes, good Prayers and Suffrage, which ſhould afterwards be celebrated, ſaid and done by the Chaplain and Prieſt of the <hi>Fraternity,</hi> within the <hi>Trinity Houſe,</hi> and at the <hi>Trinity</hi> Altar within the Church of <hi>All-Hallows,</hi> for Evermore; with ſuch Obſequies and Funeral Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, as uſually were done at the Burial of any Brother of the ſame <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity,</hi> if the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> departs within this Town of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> The Prieſt of the <hi>Trinity Houſe</hi> at this Time, was one Sir <hi>Robert Elliſon.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>TO this Writing was annex'd the Seal of the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and the Names of the Mayor, Sheriff, and Aldermen.</p>

                  <p>IN a Manuſcript I have frequently mentioned, it is ſaid that the <hi>Trinity Houſe</hi> in the <hi>Broad Chare,</hi> was held by the <hi>Maſters</hi> and <hi>Mariners</hi> of this Town of the <hi>Anderſons,</hi> by giving them a red Roſe at <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> which <hi>Bartram Anderſon</hi> turned to Wine, and then ſold it to Sir <hi>Ralph Jeniſon,</hi> and it adds, how they agree I know not. It is at preſent a very pretty Building, conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a handſome Square, very Monaſtick in it's Aſpect, having it's Appart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or Lodgings for the Inhabitants, a very neat <hi>Chappel,</hi> and a magnificent <hi>Hall.</hi> It maintains 14 Perſons, allowing every one a <hi>Chamber,</hi> eight Shillings <hi>per</hi> Month, <hi>Coals</hi> and <hi>Cloathing.</hi> There are alſo 15 <hi>extra</hi> Perſons, which have allowed them, ſome more, ſome leſs.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>ITHOUT the <hi>Cloſe-Gate</hi> is a pretty long Street, with Houſes on each Side; which goes as far as a <hi>Dike</hi> called <hi>Skinner-Bourne,</hi> where are of late Years a Factory belonging to Mr. <hi>Thomlinſon,</hi> a Pot-Houſe to Mr. <hi>Joſeph Blenkinſop</hi> and <hi>Ralph Harl,</hi> and a Glaſs-Houſe to Mr. <hi>Dagney,</hi> and Company; from thence Northward at the Top of the Hill is the Place called the <hi>Forth,</hi> anciently called the <hi>Frith,</hi> which lies without the Walls of the Town, and abutts on the South on a certain little Cloſe called <hi>Gooſe-green-Cloſe,</hi> then it extends it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a Cloſe called <hi>Dove-cote-Cloſe,</hi> and from thence Weſtward by the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt Ditch of the <hi>Cloſe,</hi> which lies contiguous to the Corner of the Hedge, which is next to the Common Way which leads into the <hi>Forth.</hi> Then by and over the Common Way to the little Rivulet or Syke of Water in the Bottom of the Valley, and ſo paſſing the Syke, you go upwards to the Cloſe called <hi>Gooſe-green-Cloſe.</hi> The Forth contains 11 Acres of Ground. It was ſurveyed by Order of the Parliament, in the Year 1649, and valued at 12 l. per Annum.</p>
                  <p>IT was valued Tythe-free. The Town pay'd 4 l. per Annum to the King for it.</p>
                  <p>HOW it comes to be called <hi>Forth</hi> or <hi>Frith,</hi> I can only conjecture. The Word <note n="ſ" place="margin">Blount Law Dictio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary in verb. <hi>Frith.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Forth</hi> or <hi>Frith,</hi> as it is anciently called, comes from the <hi>Saxon</hi> Word <hi>Frith,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Peace.</hi> For the Engliſh <hi>Saxons</hi> held ſeveral Woods to be ſacred, and made them <hi>Sanctuaries.</hi> From this Definition of the Word, it may be no improbable Conjecture that the ancient <hi>Saxons</hi> inhabiting about the Parts of the Wall where the Town now is, gave the Name of <hi>Frith</hi> to
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0583000100:157"/>
this Place, as it was perhaps endowed with gloomier Shades and darker Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, the awful Excitors of Heathen Superſtition, than other Places about the Town were.</p>
                  <p>IN the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. a Licence was granted to the Townſmen of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> bearing Date <hi>Dec.</hi> 23d of his Reign to dig Coals and Stones, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in this Place called the <hi>Forth.</hi> And here it was as ſome think, or rather as others, in the <hi>Caſtle Leaſes</hi> that the firſt <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Coals were wrought.</p>
                  <p>IT ſeems to have been all along a Place of Pleaſure and Recreation. For it was an ancient Cuſtom for the Mayor, Aldermen, and Sheriff of this Town, accompanied with great Numbers of the Burgeſſes, to go every Year at the Feaſts of <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whitſuntide</hi> to the <hi>Forth,</hi> with the Maces, Sword and Cap of Maintenance carried before them. Undoubtedly the vaſt Concourſe of both young and old at this Place at theſe Seaſons of the Year, rather than at any other about this Town, is the remains of this ancient Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>AFTER the building of the <hi>Caſtle</hi> it is ſaid (but without any juſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity) that the <hi>Forth</hi> was anciently a <hi>Fort</hi> belonging to the <hi>Caſtle.</hi>
                  </p>

                        <desc> _____ </desc>
                     </gap> , Part of it was turned into a pretty large Bowling-Green; which was adorn'd with a broad Gravel Walk and a double Row of Trees around it. It is at preſent a mighty pretty Place, exceeding by much any Common Place of Pleaſure about the Town. On the Eaſt-ſide of it, you have a Proſpect of Part of the Town's Wall, through which is the Common Paſſage to and from this Place under a ſhady Walk of Trees; on the Weſt you View the Grounds of the Village of <hi>Elſwick,</hi> which have a gentle aſcent to the Village itſelf; a Place at the proper Seaſon of the Year much frequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Town's People, for its pleaſing Walk and rural Entertainment.</p>
                  <p>FROM this Quarter we view alſo as we do from the South, the Banks of the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> together with their Villages. On the North is an Houſe of Accommodation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>GREY</hi> ſays that it was given to the Townſmen for their Services, by <hi>Edward</hi> III. Whereas it ſeems to have been theirs in the Reign of <hi>Hen.</hi> III. However if the other Conjecture be true, I verily believe it was given to the Town for that memorable Victory obtain'd by the Townſmen, when the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> was taken Priſoner, which is commemorated in <hi>Anno Chriſti,</hi> 1342.</p>

                  <p>IT is the Opinion of <note n="u" place="margin">Grey</note> ſome, that this large Piece of Ground was the Gift of <hi>Adam de Athol,</hi> of <hi>Geſmond,</hi> to the Town: But if the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0583000100:160"/>
had an Immemorial Right to the Town-Moor, in the Days of <hi>Edward</hi> III. and this is proved from his Charter above-mentioned; then it is very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that <hi>Adamarus de Athol,</hi> of <hi>Geſmunde,</hi> ſhould be the Donor of it. For this <note n="w" place="margin">De reb. Novicaſt. p. 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Adam</hi> was High Sheriff of the County of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> in the Fifth of <hi>Richard</hi> II. and was living in the Year of our Lord 1392, as appears by an Indulgence of 40 Days granted to the Church of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s, which was in the Proceedings upon a Diſpute, about 30 Years after, relating to the <hi>Town-Moor.</hi> It is declared, that the <hi>Town-Moor</hi> had belonged to the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> immemorially, or Time out of Mind: But how can it be ſaid to be in the Poſſeſſion of the Town for ſo long a Time, when he himſelf, who gave it, lived thirty Years after this Declaration? And if he did ſo; no doubt but ſeveral others liv'd ſo long too. Either then the Town was not at the Time of this Diſpute immemorially in the Poſſeſſion of this Ground, or this <hi>Adamarus de Athol,</hi> was not the Donor of it. Again, had he been the Donor of it, he muſt have been 120 Years old at his Death; that is to ſay, he liv'd thirty Years after this Diſpute, and Ninety before to make it immemorial; (which is the leaſt Time that can be allow'd to make any Thing ſo) ſo that theſe two put together will make that Number of Years at his Death. It is not indeed in this Age of the World impoſſible for a Man to live ſo long, but yet it is highly improbable. There are few come to this Age, and when they do, they are look'd upon as ſo many great Exceptions to the general Rule of the Ages of Men; and then their Ages ſtand upon Record to ſuccceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Generations; and no doubt, had this been true of <hi>Adam de Athol,</hi> it wou'd at leaſt have been mention'd upon his <hi>Tomb-Stone,</hi> but we find no ſuch Thing. Nay, ſhould we allow, for the Sake of making him the Donor, that he really lived 120 Years; yet after all, this grand Abſurdity would fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that if the <hi>Town,</hi> when this Diſpute happen'd, had had it immemorially; he muſt have made a Preſent of it on the very Day he was born.</p>
                  <p>FOR theſe Reaſons therefore it's impoſſible he ſhould be the Donor of it, but ſome of his <hi>Anceſtors</hi> of the ſame Name might: And this is the rather to be imagin'd, becauſe Tradition ſays, it was <hi>Adam de Athol,</hi> of <hi>Jeſumund,</hi> hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the Name to this Day. As then he was of the ſame Name, and undoubtedly a great Benefactor to this Town, ſo the good Deeds of ſome of his Anceſtors might have been aſcribed to him through Miſtake, and ſo be handed down to this preſent Day. There was one <hi>Adam de Jeſumuthia,</hi> or <hi>Geſmund,</hi> who order'd that one <hi>Good-Plank,</hi> or <hi>Six-Shillings,</hi> ſhould be given annually (as may be ſeen in the Account of the <hi>Tyne-Bridge</hi>) for the Repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Bridge.</hi> Perhaps it was him, for the Bridge was burnt in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> III. in the Year 1248, and immediately they ſet about the Repair of it, and this <hi>Adam</hi> was one of the Benefactors to it. If then Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition ſays true, that <hi>Adam de Jeſmund</hi> was the Donor of the <hi>Town-Moor</hi> to the Town, this is probably the very Man, and whether he gave it before the Burning of the <hi>Bridge,</hi> or at the Time of his Benefaction to the <hi>Bridge;</hi> yet in the Thirty firſt of <hi>Edward</hi> III. it would undoubtedly have been the Town's immemorially, which is a good preſumptive Proof of this Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, that this was the very Man. Be this as it will, it is certain that it had been the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi>'s Time out of Mind in the Thirty firſt Year of <hi>Edward</hi> III. and was then confirm'd to them, as has been obſerved above; in our Account of the <hi>Caſtle Leaſes.</hi>

                  <p>THE ſame Maſter of this Hoſpital, in this ſame Year following, built in the ſaid Hoſpital a Conſiſtory, a Stable, and a Bier, and made in the Quire two New Windows facing the South of the ſaid Chapel, beſides a Number of other good and generous Charities which he beſtowed upon this Hoſpital.</p>

                     <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0583000100:163"/>THE ſame Gentleman proves judicially in the King's Court, that the Mayor and Commonalty of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tine,</hi> did aſſign, preſent, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct the Maſter of the ſaid Hoſpital.

                  <p>IN the Reign of our Lord 1564, in the 6th of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> one <hi>Edmund Wiſeman,</hi> Servant to the right Honourable Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon,</hi> Knight, and Keeper of the Great Seal of <hi>England,</hi> obtained by the Procurement of one <hi>Cuthbert Bewick,</hi> a Burgeſs and Merchant of this Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation from the Queen, of the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> lying with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Wall of <hi>Newcaſtle;</hi> of which Hoſpital the Mayor and Burgeſſes of this Town were the true and very Patrons, and had till then preſented Time out of <note n="y" place="margin">The Weſt-Spittle, the Hoſpital cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalens,</hi> and the Chapel of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> the Martyr, have been given by the Mayor and Burgeſſes of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> Time out of Mind.</note> Mind. By Virtue of this Preſentation from the Queen, <hi>James</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> would have inducted the ſaid <hi>Wiſeman</hi> (in the Year afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, betwixt <hi>Lammas</hi> and <hi>Martinmas</hi>) into the Poſſeſſion of the ſaid Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal; but the <hi>Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen</hi> of the Town having Reſpect to the Defence of their Patronage, would in no wiſe permit the ſaid Biſhop to give Induction therein: For the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was a Donative, and not a Benefice inductible by any Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>IN the Year 1569, 15th <hi>February,</hi> the Mayor and Burgeſſes of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> granted the next Preſentation of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> commonly called the <hi>Maid<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>IN the Account of <hi>Ficket-Tower,</hi> there is Mention made of a <hi>Great Croſs,</hi> ſtanding within <hi>Maudlin-Barras;</hi> and in the <hi>Milbank</hi> Manuſcript it is ſaid, <hi>At the End of the</hi> Barras<hi>-Bridge before the Chapel ſtood a ſtately Croſs firm and compleat,</hi> and <note n="z" place="margin">This <hi>Pigg</hi> was a Rebel, a very great <hi>Enthuſiaſt,</hi> a Monument of his whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Head is that <hi>Stone-Pillar,</hi> a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle North of the three <hi>Mile Bridge,</hi> which every deſervedly to this Day, bears the Title of <hi>Pig</hi>'s Folly.</note> 
                     <hi>John Pigg</hi> in the Time of the Rebellion took it down, and called it Idolatry, and thought to make his own Uſe of it; but it was broke by ſome who hated it ſhould be prophaned.

                  <p>LEAVING St. <hi>Mary Magdalens,</hi> we go forward to the End of this Street, which together with the End of the Street leading from <hi>Newgate,</hi> meets at the <hi>Barras-Bridge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>HOW it comes by the Name of <hi>Barras-Bridge, Grey</hi> gives us no Account. Others have imagined it to be ſo called, from a Perſon of that Name, who was its Builder or Benefactor. This Conjecture in my Opinion is a grand Miſtake; for we have juſt now mentioned the <hi>Maudlin-Barras,</hi> and therefore the Word <hi>Barras</hi> muſt imply ſomething elſe. The Manuſcript above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned ſpeaking of the Antiquity of St. <hi>Andrew</hi>'s Church, gives this as a Reaſon of its being the oldeſt in Town, becauſe it is next the <hi>Barras,</hi> which hath been the ancient <hi>Barracado</hi> of the Town. So then according to this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, it got its Name from the Word <hi>Barracado.</hi> This alſo in my Opinion is a Miſtake. For the Word <hi>Barrows</hi> (for ſo it ſhould be ſpell'd) ſignifies the ſame as <hi>Tinnuli,</hi> Hillocks, and ſometimes <hi>Graves</hi> and <hi>Sepulchres:</hi> And when it is conſidered, that the Hoſpital of St. <hi>Mary Magdalen</hi> was founded for the Reception of <hi>Leprous Folks,</hi> it is eaſy to ſee, that the <hi>Maudlin-Borrows</hi> are the <hi>Tombs</hi> or <hi>Burial-Places</hi> of thoſe that died of the <hi>Leproſy</hi> in that <hi>Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal;</hi> and ſince the Burial-place it ſelf was nigh to the Bridge, the Bridge got thence the Name of the <hi>Barrows-Bridge.</hi> The <hi>Barras</hi> mentioned in the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Ficket-Tower</hi> are the ſame Thing; nothing elſe but the Burial-place of the <hi>Franciſcan Friars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE Place of the <hi>Maudlin Barrows</hi> I take to be the ſick Man's Cloſe; for as after the abating of the Leproſy, this Hoſpital was obliged to take the Poor of the Town in during the Time of the Peſtilence; ſo I queſtion not, but thoſe that died were buried in the ancient Burial-place or Barrows of the Hoſpital. And ſince we are certain they were buried in the <hi>ſick Man</hi>'s <hi>Cloſe,</hi> we may
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0583000100:164"/>
be therefore almoſt certain, that the <hi>ſick Man</hi>'s <hi>Cloſe</hi> was the <hi>Barrows</hi> of this <hi>Hoſpital.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Barrows-Mill</hi> belong'd to the <hi>black Friars;</hi> and in the Year 1558, paid a Rent to the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> of 2 <hi>s. per annum. Lib. Cart. p.</hi> 43.</p>
                  <p>THE Chapel on the other Side the <hi>Barrows-Bridge</hi> was dedicated to St. <hi>James</hi> the Apoſtle, and was anciently called St. <note n="a" place="margin">

                  </head>
                  <p>THE Suburbs out of <hi>Pandon-Gate</hi> are but very few Houſes; but there are <hi>Gardens</hi> all the Way up the Cauſeway; two of them are thoſe of Mr. <hi>John Simpſon</hi> and Mr. <hi>Charles Atkinſon.</hi> This Way was within theſe four Years the pleaſanteſt Entrance into the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> having Gardens on each Side, beſet with <hi>Trees</hi> of ſo large a Size and Shade, that they covered the Street itſelf in ſeveral Places. Theſe were cut down for a little unpoſſeſt Money, and the greateſt Beauty of the Street loſt.</p>
                  <p>THERE are in this Street two or three Paſſages, leading to different Places, which it may not be amiſs to mention. After you are out of <hi>Pandon-gate,</hi> there is one on the left Hand leading to <hi>Pandon-Dean,</hi> a very <hi>Romantick Place,</hi> full of Hills and Vales, through which runs <hi>Pandon-Burn.</hi> It is a very entertaining Walk in the Summer to <hi>Magdalen</hi>-Well. A little above this is another very narrow Paſſage on the right Hand, bordering upon Mr. <hi>Harriſon</hi>'s Garden, which leads to a Place called the <hi>Garth-Heads,</hi> which was a Place of Pleaſure and Recreation; but of late it was taken in, and made a <hi>common Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> of, by <hi>Richard Ridley,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the Proprietor of it.</p>
                  <p>HAVING paſt this Lane, we proceed till we come to the Top of this great Aſcent (for ſuch indeed is this Street) and there we meet with two Ways; the one leads to the <hi>Shield-Field,</hi> the Property of Mr. <hi>Charles Clark</hi> of <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> which has been already mentioned; and the other to <hi>Owſe-Burn,</hi> which is at preſent a large Village, occaſioned by the Coal-works of <hi>Richard Ridley</hi> and <hi>Matthew White,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſqs</abbr>

                  </p>
                  <p>IT takes its Name from the Burn that runs through it. The Banks of this Burn are in many Places terribly high, in all Places beautifully Roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick.</p>
                  <p>BEFORE we come to the Suburbs of <hi>Sandgate,</hi> we muſt not omit to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the <hi>Keelmens Hoſpital;</hi> it is ſituated ſome Diſtance Eaſt of the <hi>Town's Wall,</hi> between the <hi>Carpenters Tower</hi> and <hi>Sandgate.</hi> It is a ſquare Building, done in the Form of <hi>Monaſteries</hi> and <hi>Colleges,</hi> having its low Walk round it, in Imitation of <hi>Cloyſters.</hi> The Area in the Middle of it, is about 83 Foot broad, and about 97½ Foot long. There are upwards of fifty Chambers in it. Who it was built by, may be learned from the Inſcription above the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of it, which is as follows: <hi>The Keelmens Hoſpital, built at their own Charge,</hi> Anno Domini 1701, Matthew White, <hi>
                        <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Governour, Mr.</hi> Edward Grey, <hi>Mr.</hi> Edward Carr, <hi>Stewards of the Hoaſtmens Company for the Time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0583000100:165"/>
and Truſtees for this Hoſpital.</hi> I have been told, that Dr. <hi>Moor,</hi> one of the late Biſhops of <hi>Ely,</hi> upon going down the River in the Town's Barge with the Magiſtrates, obſerved it, and made Enquiry after it. And being told, that it was built by the <hi>Keelmen</hi> themſelves (every one allowing towards it a <hi>Penny a Tide</hi>) he ſaid, that he had heard of, and ſeen many Hoſpitals, the Works of <hi>rich Men;</hi> but that was the firſt he ever ſaw or heard of, which had been built by the Poor. 'Tis a great Pity that the Deſign of its Building is not throughly anſwer'd; but there are ſome Miſcreants, who would rather ſtarve in Sickneſs or old Age, than not guzzle a Penny in their Health and Youth.</p>

                  <head>Sect. VI. <hi>Of the</hi> Suburbs <hi>of</hi> SANDGATE.</head>
                  <p>THE Suburbs of <hi>Sandgate</hi> (excepting ſome Houſes nigh the Walls of the Town) we are informed eſcap'd the Fury of the Civil Wars. This Street has it's Name from it's Situation, which is upon the Sand. For this whole Street as well as the <hi>Sandhill,</hi> and all the lower Parts of the Town in ancient Times was the Common Sand or Shore of the River.</p>
                  <p>THIS Street has in it a vaſt Number of narrow Lanes on each Side of it, which are crouded with Houſes. It is chiefly inhabited by People that work upon the <hi>Water,</hi> particularly the <hi>Keelmen.</hi> The Number of Souls in this Street and the Lanes belonging to it, is computed to ſeveral Thouſands.</p>
                  <p>ABOUT the middle of this Street is an open Place called the <hi>Squirrel,</hi> from a little Brook of that Name, which runs through it into the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> which was the ancient Bounds of the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle.</hi> From this, as far as the Houſe of Mr. <hi>Jeremiah Cook,</hi> Shipwright, is the Street of <hi>Sandgate,</hi> then we enter St. <hi>Ann</hi>'s Street, (ſo called from the neighbouring Chapel) which leads us on to the <hi>Ropery,</hi> which is a long and pleaſant Walk, giving an agreeable Proſpect of the River, and a great Part of the Town and Neighbouring Places. What this Ropery was formerly, <hi>Grey</hi> gives us the beſt Account. Below Eaſt, ſays he, is the Ballaſt-Hill, where Women upon their Heads car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried Ballaſt, which was taken forth of the ſmall Ships which came empty for Coals; which Place was the firſt Ballaſt Shore out of the Town; ſince which Time, the Trade increaſing, there are many Ballaſt Shores below the Water, on both Sides of the River; much the ſame Account is given of this, in the Manuſcript ſo frequently mentioned; the Hoaſtmen got Leave at firſt to lead Coals above the <hi>Bourn,</hi> and that occaſioned their Delivery of Ballaſt upon the <hi>Lime-Kiln</hi> Road, and the Women bore the Ballaſt upon their Heads, and made the Ballaſt-Hills; for the Town had procured all that Shore of the Lords of <hi>Byker</hi> for that Uſe, and to build Lime-Kilns upon.</p>
                  <p>ON the North of this Ropery ſtands the Chapel of St. <hi>Ann,</hi> which is a a Chapel of Eaſt to the Church of <hi>All-hallows,</hi> which tho' pretty large is yet much too little for the Pariſh, it being perhaps one of the largeſt Pariſhes in the whole Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>WHEN it was originally built I have met with nothing that gives any Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. after the Reformation it was neglected and came into Decay; but the Town in the Year 1682. repair'd it, and ſettled a Lecturer there, to preach in the Morning, and to expound the <hi>Catechiſm</hi> every Sunday Afternoon; which the Town allow'd 30 <hi>l.</hi> per Annum for; at the Opening of it, after it was repaired, the Rev. Mr. <hi>March,</hi> then Vicar of the Town, preached the firſt
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0583000100:166"/>
Sermon, in it, which was Printed, and Intitled, <hi>Th'</hi> Encaenia <hi>of St.</hi> Ann<hi>'s Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in</hi> Sandgate.</p>
                  <p>IT has at preſent two Lecturers, which are paid by the Town, the Rev. Mr. <hi>Clayton,</hi> and the Rev. Mr. <hi>Maddiſon;</hi> to the former the Town pays 40 <hi>l. per Annum,</hi> and to the latter 50 <hi>l.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BELOW this to the Glaſs-houſe-bridge are the Houſes of Ship-Wrights, and Maſter-Builders, ſuch as Mr. <hi>Thomas Wallas,</hi> Mr. <hi>Roger Durham,</hi> Mr. <hi>John Lattany,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cuthbert Preſton,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Glaſs-houſe-bridge,</hi> ſo called becauſe of the <hi>Glaſs-houſes</hi> which are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt contiguous to it, was originally a Wood-Bridge, as the Bridge higher up the <hi>Bourn</hi> was, 'till within theſe 6 or 7 Years; but in the Year 1669, when <hi>Ralph Jeniſon,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was Mayor, it was made of Stone by <hi>Thomas Wrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> Ship-Wright, on Account of Lands which the Town let him; The Paſſage however over it was very difficult and uneven 'till the Year 1729, When <hi>Stephen Coulſon,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was Mayor, it was made level and commodious both for Horſe and Foot.</p>
                  <p>ON the other Side of the Bridge are the <hi>Glaſs-houſes,</hi> which in <hi>Grey</hi>'s Time ſerved moſt Part of the Kingdom with Window-Glaſs.</p>
                  <p>SOMETIME in the Reign of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> came over to <hi>England</hi> from <hi>Lorrain,</hi> the <hi>Henzels, Tyzacks</hi> and <hi>Tytorys.</hi> The Reaſon of their coming hither was the Perſecution of the Proteſtants in their own Country, of whoſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion they were. They were by Occupation Glaſs-makers. At their firſt coming to this Town they wrought in their Trade at the Cloſe-gate, after that they removed into <hi>Staffordſhire,</hi> from whence they removed again and ſettled upon the River Side at the Place called from their abiding in it the <hi>Glaſs-houſes.</hi> Deſervedly therefore have ſo many of theſe Families been named <hi>Peregrines</hi> from the Latin Word <hi>Peregrinus</hi> which ſignifies a Pilgrim or a Stranger.</p>
                  <p>HAVING at laſt ſettled here they became very numerous, and generally married into each others Families to preſerve the three Names of <hi>Henzel, Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zack</hi> and <hi>Tytory.</hi> But the latter of them within this Few Years became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct. There are of the <hi>Tyzacks</hi> ſeveral remaining; but the <hi>Henzels</hi> are moſt numerous.</p>
                  <p>AS you go from the Glaſs-houſe, you come now to the <hi>Glaſs-houſes,</hi> a large Village, and paſs by the Weſtern Glaſs-houſe, then to the Crown-Glaſs-houſe, then to the middle Bottle-houſe, then to the middle Broad-houſe, then to the caſtern Glaſs-houſe. Nigh this laſt is the Houſe of the late Mr. <hi>Peregrine Henzel,</hi> the principal Perſon then remaining of his Family, and one of the Chief Owners of theſe Works.</p>
                  <p>FROM hence we paſs over the Grounds of St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> to a Place conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting of ſeveral Houſes, which from a Chapel here ſituated, dedicated to St. <hi>Laurence,</hi> is called St. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s Glaſs-houſe, or Muſhroom-Glaſs-houſe; there is alſo here a Bottle Glaſs-houſe, now held under the Town by Mrs. <hi>Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> of which <hi>Richard Ridley,</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> is an Owner.</p>
                  <p>ST. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s Chapel, or Chantery as it is called, is ſaid to have been built by one of the Earls of <hi>Northumberland.</hi> No Doubt that Prayers might be put up for his Soul, and the Souls of his Family.</p>
                  <p>AT the Reformation it had Fate of many Chapels of the like Kind; to have its Revenues diſpoſed of, and itſelf left to fall into Ruins.</p>
                  <p>IT was dependant upon the Priory of St. <hi>John</hi>'s of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> It was gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted

               <p>IT is obſervable in this Place when the Coal Trade is brisk, that all other Buſineſs is ſo too; and when it is otherwiſe, through the Contracts of the Coal Owners, or of the Maſters, that there is a certain Deadneſs in all Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fick. It is the Money ariſing from the Coal Trade, that almoſt entirely Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates in this great Town and adjacent Country.</p>
               <p>IT has been obſerved by <note n="e" place="margin">Fleetwood Precioſum Chronicon 118. p.</note> ſome, that Sea Coal has not been in Uſe above 150 Years, at leaſt not in <hi>London;</hi> and that when we meet with Coals in old Accounts, it is meant of Charcoal. I can ſcarce be of this Opinion, if it was but for what the ſaid Authority himſelf acknowledgeth, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Carbo Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus,</hi> or Sea Coal, is mentioned in <hi>Matthew Paris.</hi> And in the 1ſt of <hi>Edward</hi> III. there is mention made <hi>de Carbonibus marithnis,</hi> of Sea Coals and the Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of them.</p>
               <p>HOWEVER this be, nigh this Town of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> Coals were work'd very early, in a Charter of King <hi>Hen.</hi> III. dated <hi>Dec.</hi> 1, 23d of that King's Reign, Licence was granted to the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> to dig Coals in the <hi>Caſtle-Field</hi> and the <hi>Frith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN the Year 1421, the 9th of <hi>Hen.</hi> V. Two-pence per Chaldron being paid to the King for all Coals ſold at the Port of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> to People not enfran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſed; it was enacted that the Keels ſhould be of the Burthen of 20 Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drons, and no more, according to Cuſtom; ſome being of the Burthen of 22, and ſome of 24 Chaldrons built, to defraud the King of his Cuſtoms, and that the Keels ſhould be ſealed by the King's Officers. <hi>De. reb.</hi> 39.</p>

                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0583000100:170"/>QUEEN <hi>Elizabeth</hi> demanding of the Town the Arrear of 2 <hi>d.</hi> per Chaldron, which had been neglected for many Years; the Town begg'd her Majeſty that theſe Arrears might be forgiven, and to grant them a <note n="f" place="margin">Gardner <hi>Queen</hi> Eliz, <hi>Charter.</hi>

And in Conſideration thereof they would pay to her Majeſty and her Succeſſors, 12 <hi>d.</hi> for every Chaldron exported from thenceforth to the free People of this Nation; this was taken into Conſideration and granted.</p>
               <p>IN the Year 1644, in the Time of the Civil War, the City of <hi>London</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a great Advantage by this Town's being taken; for almoſt two Years by-paſt, the poorer Sort of People had been almoſt ſtarved, Coals hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riſen to the Price of 4 <hi>l.</hi> per Chaldron, a Price never known before that Time.</p>
               <p>THIS Place is generally computed to vend upwards of 300,000 Chaldrons a-Year. There are likewiſe vaſt Exportations of Lead, Salt, Salmon, and Grindſtones, which laſt Commodity, as <hi>Grey</hi> ſays, and is ſtill true, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to moſt Parts of the World; according to the Proverb, <hi>A Scott, a Rat, and a Newcaſtle Grindſtone you may find all the World over.</hi>

                  <p>KING <hi>Henry</hi> I. granted the Church of this Place to St. <hi>Mary's</hi> of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> and the Canons of the ſame.</p>

                  <p>THERE is a little Iſland in the Midſt of the River, called, <hi>The King's Meadows,</hi> which is a delicious Place, and a great Ornament to the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>
                  <p>LET us now come below Bridge, to take Notice of a few Things there. <hi>Gateſhead</hi> preſents itſelf firſt, a Town in the Biſhoprick of <hi>Durham;</hi> it ſtands on the South-ſide of the <hi>Tyne,</hi> oppoſite to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and is a Place of great Antiquity. Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> thinks it a Place of equal Antiquity with <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> becauſe of it's ancient Name <hi>Gabroſentum;</hi> but I have already proved it more rational to believe it to have been only it's Suburbs.</p>
                  <p>THERE was an ancient Monaſtry here in the Time of <hi>Bede;</hi> which was the Monaſtry of <hi>Utanus,</hi> it was where Mr. <hi>Riddle</hi>'s Houſe, or <hi>Gateſhead</hi> Houſe is as it now ſtands.</p>
                  <p>ON the 14 of <hi>May,</hi> 1080, <hi>Walter</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham</hi> was murdered at this Place. The Occaſion of it was, this <hi>Walter</hi> attending more wordly Affairs than the Charge of his Flock, gave himſelf altogether to Temporal Buſineſs, wherein he wholly occupied himſelf. He bought of the King the Earldom of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> and then making himſelf a ſecular Judge, took upon him to ſit in the Court, and to determine all Cauſes at his Pleaſure, dealing withal very corruptly, and taking ſtill the Courſe that might be moſt for his own
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0583000100:178"/>
Gain. Hereupon he greatly enriched his own Coffers, but purchaſed unto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf extreme Hatred amongſt the Common People, which was his Deſtruction in the End. There was a certain Gentleman, of great Account, named <hi>Leul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus,</hi> that married <hi>Algitha,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Aldred,</hi> ſometime Earl of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland,</hi> from whom the Lord <hi>Lumley</hi> that now liveth is lineally deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This <hi>Leulfus,</hi> to the end he might live near the Church in his latter Time, and for very Devotion, came to <hi>Durham</hi> to dwell there, and kept Company very much with the Biſhop, who loved him entirely, for many good Parts he ſaw in him, as namely, his Wiſdom in diſcerning, his Equity in deciding, and his Diſcretion in ordering and handling ſuch Cauſes as he committed unto him; in which Reſpect alſo he uſed him very familiarly, employed him often, and gave him what Countenance he could. Now, you ſhall underſtand, that unto the ſame Biſhop belonged two Men, unto whom for the moſt Part he committed the ordering of all his Affairs; <hi>Leofwyn</hi> or <hi>Leobwyn</hi> his Chaplain, whom he truſted with all Houſhold-Matters, and <hi>Gil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> a Kinſman of his own, that dealt in his Cauſes of Temporal Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. In their Offices they behaved themſelves ſo, as the Biſhop had Cauſe to commend their Diligence, but to blame their Raſhneſs and Wilfulneſs in many Things, which notwithſtanding he bore withal, either becauſe their Induſtry and Care of his Affairs, ſo blinded his Eyes, as he could not eſpy their Misbehaviour otherwiſe, or elſe being loath to deteſt them whom he had once advanced. Theſe Men, and eſpecially <hi>Leofwyn,</hi> did greatly envy the Credit that <hi>Leulfus</hi> had gotten with the Biſhop, and every where oppoſed themſelves againſt him, not only in Words, traducing his Actions, but in Deeds alſo, thwarting and croſſing his Endeavours, whereby it came to paſs, that many Jars fell out between them. One Day amongſt the reſt, a Court being held in the Preſence of the Biſhop, <hi>Leofwyn</hi> or <hi>Leobwyn</hi> (for ſo alſo I find him called) according to his wonted Manner, gave <hi>Leulfus</hi> ill Speeches, which he not enduring to bear, as heretofore he had done <hi>(furor fit ſaepius lae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa patientia)</hi> anſwered this ſawcy Chaplain ſomewhat more roundly than he had been accuſtomed. Whereupon he roſe ſtraight from the Court in great Indignation (<hi>Leofwyn</hi> I mean) and calling <hi>Gilbert</hi> aſide, with little ado per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded him to carry a certain Number of armed Men to the Houſe where <hi>Leulfus</hi> lay, and in a Night to kill him; which indeed he performed with great Cruelty, murdering not only the innocent Gentleman himſelf, but alſo his Servants and whole Houſhold. The News of this horrible and outragi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Cruelty coming unto the Ears of the Biſhop, amazed him very much, and ſuſpecting it was done by the Advice of <hi>Leofwyn,</hi> turning about unto him: <hi>O</hi> Leofwyn, ſaith he, <hi>thou haſt already ſlain me by thy Tongue.</hi> So not doubting it would breed much Danger unto him, he got into his Caſtle, and preſently diſpatched Meſſengers unto the Friends and Kindred of <hi>Leulfus</hi> that was ſlain, proteſting, that the Fact was committed without his Knowledge; that he was marvellous ſorry for it; and if any Man ſuſpected him, would be ready to ſubmit himſelf to any Order of Law, whereby he might clear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Herewith they ſeemed to be ſatisfied; but for Concluſion of a firm Peace amongſt them, it was thought fit they ſhould meet and conſider of the Matter. They met at a Place called <hi>Goats-Head;</hi> the Biſhop for his better Safe-guard betook himſelf unto the Church with his Company; the People (whereof an infinite Number were gathered together) abode without. Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages a while paſt between them; but the more the Matter was debated (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very odious of itſelf) the more the People were incenſed. At laſt it was told them, how not only <hi>Leofwyn,</hi> but alſo <hi>Gilbert</hi> had been harboured in the Biſhop's Houſe, and afforded Countenance by him ſince the Murder; which being once heard (and it was true enough) they all cried out, it was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt that the Biſhop was the Author of this Fact. It is furthermore delivered by <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> that the Biſhop not only before this, amongſt many intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Exactions laid upon the Country by him, had commanded the Sum of 400 <hi>l.</hi> to be levied at this Time. That being alſo remembred, while as all the People ſtood in a murmuring, doubting what Courſe to take, one of ſome ſpecial Regard amongſt them ſlept up, uſing theſe Words, <hi>Short read, Good read, ſlay ye the Biſhop.</hi> Hereupon, without more ado, they ran all unto the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0583000100:179"/>
Church, killed ſo many of the <hi>Biſhop</hi>'s Retinue as they found without Doors, and with horrible Noiſe and Outcries, bid him and his Company to come out unto them. Too late then he repented, that he had committed himſelf unto the Fury of a diſcontented Multitude, with whom he knew himſelf before that Time nothing gracious. But to make the beſt of a bad Match, and to try all Means of ridding himſelf from the Danger imminent, he perſuaded his Kinſman <hi>Gilbert,</hi> there preſent, to go forth unto them, if happily his Death (which doubtleſs he had deſerved) might ſatisfy their Fury, and purchaſe Safety unto his Lord and Maſter. <hi>Gilbert</hi> was content, and iſſuing out, with divers of the Biſhop's Company, were all ſlain, except only two <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> Servants unto the <hi>Biſhop</hi> (all the reſt were <hi>Normans</hi>). They being not yet ſatisfied, he beſought <hi>Leofwyn</hi> (whoſe Life he knew well was principally ſought) to go out alſo. But he utterly refuſed ſo to do. The Biſhop there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore going unto the Church-door, entreated them not to take his Life from him, proteſting himſelf to be utterly guiltleſs of the Blood of <hi>Leulfus;</hi> and ſhewed them at large, how dangerous it would be to them in particular, and what Inconvenience would follow to the whole Country in general, if they ſhould defile their Hands in ſhedding his Blood, an unarmed Prieſt, a ſacred and conſecrated Biſhop, their Ruler, their Governor, their Magiſtrate. Hoping, <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That his very Countenance, his Gravity, his Age, and the Sight of his Perſon might move them to Compaſſion (for he was indeed a very reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Man to ſee to, very tall of Stature, Head and Beard as white as Snow, his Face freſh and well coloured, and every Way very perſonable, he went out, carrying a green Branch in his Hand, that ſo he might teſtify his Deſire of Peace. When he ſaw that all this availed not, and the People ran furiouſly upon him, he caſt his Gown over his own Head, in like Sort as we read <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar</hi> did in the like Caſe, and permitting himſelf to their Fury, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable Wounds was pitifully maſſacred, together with all his People and Retinue, to the Number of an hundred; only <hi>Leofwyn</hi> yet remained within the Church, and being often called, would not come forth; ſo they ſet the Church on Fire. Not enduring the Fire, he leaped out of a Window, and was immediately hewn into a thouſand Pieces. The Monks of <hi>Yarrow</hi> came and fetched away the Biſhop's Body (which they found ſtark naked) and could hardly know it for the Multitude of Wounds; they carried it to their Monaſtery, from whence it was conveyed to <hi>Durham,</hi> and there buried on the South-ſide of the Chapter-houſe, but ſecretly, for Fear of the Murderers, that roved up and down the Town, and once aſſaulted the Caſtle. When they found that they could not prevail there, they diſperſed themſelves, and for the moſt Part came to evil and unhappy Ends. The King in the mean Time hearing of this Tumult, ſent his Brother <hi>Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Bayan,</hi> with many of his Nobles, and a great Army, to take Puniſhment of this Murder, which while they ſought to revenge, they brought the whole Country to Deſolation. Thoſe that were guilty prevented the Danger toward them by Flight, ſo as few of them could be taken; of the reſt that ſtayed at Home, ſome were unjuſtly executed, and the reſt compelled to ranſom themſelves to their utter impoveriſhing and undoing. The chiefeſt Doer in this Outrage, was one <hi>Eadulſus,</hi> ſirnamed <hi>Rus,</hi> deſcended of the Earls of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> who (as ſome ſay) ſlew the Biſhop with his own Hands, and afterwards by the juſt Judgment of God, was himſelf ſlain by a Woman, and his Body, tho' once buried in the Church of <hi>Godworth,</hi> was taken up by the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Turgoſt,</hi> Prior of <hi>Durham,</hi> and forbidden Chriſtian Burial. At this Time <hi>Odo</hi> took away from the Church of <hi>Durham</hi> certain Ornaments of great Value, amongſt which is eſpecially remembred a certain Croſier of ineſtimable Price. In this Biſhop's Days, and by his Endeavour, ſecular Clerks were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed, and the Church of <hi>Durham</hi> repleniſhed with Monks, the Pope, the King, and the Archbiſhop allowing this Alteration, <hi>Goodwyn, Fol.</hi> 637.</p>
                  <p>AFTERWARDS this Church was new built, and placed where it now ſtands: For, according to Tradition, it ſtood before in the Field below where Brick-Kilns now are.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>PHILIP</hi> by the Grace of God Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> to all Men of the whole Biſhoprick, and of his Brotherhood in all <hi>England,</hi> he ſaluteth.</p>
                  <p>Know ye, that we have granted, and by his preſent Deed have granted to our Burgeſſes of <hi>Gateſheved,</hi> full Liberty of Foreſtage, yielding in every half Year, from <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> to the Feaſt of St. <hi>Martin;</hi> for a Wheye or Ox, the which goes to Graſs, 2 <hi>d.</hi> and for a Horſe 2 <hi>d.</hi> and for every Hog 1 <hi>d.</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of all Things that they have to proper and neceſſary Uſes; ſaving theſe prohibited. Neither ſhall it be lawful for any Foreſter within the Meats that are appointed within our Foreſt and Burrough to Tax Lands upon any Burgeſs, or upon any Manner of Thing of the ſaid Borough, or upon any Oxen, or any other their Cattle, or by any Ways to hinder them, either of their Wood, Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, or any other Things. And if any Suit or Trouble ſhall be between the Foreſters and Burgeſſes, it ſhall be determined in the ſaid Burrough, if it may be; if not, then in our Preſence it ſhall be determined. And the Cattle of any Burgeſs ſhall not be carried out of the ſaid Burrough, but there ſhall be reple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vied, if the ſame may be replevied. To the ſame Burgeſſes it ſhall be lawful to have Herbage, and lying Turfs and Bruery to their own proper Uſes, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever they are accuſtomed to have the ſame, ſo that they ſell us Part thereof. And if any Burgeſs do dig Turfs for his Chimney, not having Oxen; if for the Leading of Turfs they ſhall be forced to have Oxen, nevertheleſs in giving for all or every Ox, which they ſhall need 2 <hi>d.</hi> of Foreſtage, they ſhall be freed. And it ſhall be lawful for every Burgeſs to give Wood to whomſoever he will,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0583000100:183"/>
to be ſpent about the River of <hi>Tyne,</hi> without any Licence; but not to ſell any without Licence of the Foreſters. And no Foreſter ſhall diſturb any Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize that cometh within the ſaid Meat. And every Burgeſs of <hi>Gateſheved</hi> ſhall have of his Burgage the ſame Liberty, which the Burgeſſes of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> have of their Burgages. And whitherſoever the Burgeſſes of <hi>Gateſheved,</hi> or their Cattle, ſhall come within our Land, in the Peace of God and Bleſſed St. <hi>Cuthbert,</hi> they ſhall paſs, that no Man to them ſhall do any Injury, or any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand or Exaction of them ſhall require. We do grant alſo to the ſame Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes, that they ſhall have Common of Paſture and like Parts of Feeding to all their Houſes, and all Commodities which they ought to have of <hi>Subtwell Meadows,</hi> as they were wont to have; as in Deeds of good Memory of our Predeceſſors reaſonably is contain'd.</p>
                  <p>IN the 7th of <hi>Edward</hi> VI. the Mayor and Burgeſſes of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned the King, that the Town of <hi>Gateſheved</hi> in the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining to their Corporation, only the River of <hi>Tyne</hi> between, being popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and without Government, and often committing many Outrages in their Town, and then got over the Water into the Town of <hi>Gateſheved</hi> unpuniſhed; and that often they caſt Rubbiſh into the River; and alſo that the Bridge went to Decay very much, which belonged to that Town; humbly beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That his Majeſty would be graciouſly pleaſed, to incorporate that Town with them, under their Government, with all its Members, and Salt-mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, and Park; and that it might be quite taken from the County of <hi>Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and all the People therein to become ſubordinate to their Laws.</p>
                  <p>WHEREUPON it was enacted, the whole Town of <hi>Gateſheved,</hi> with the Salt-Meadows, the whole Water and Bridge, with all the Liberties there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto belonging (except the Common which ſhould remain to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants) ſhould be incorporated with <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and disjoined from the County of <hi>Durham,</hi> as <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> was from <hi>Northumberland</hi> by Charter, <hi>Gardener,</hi> p. 169.</p>
                  <p>FIRST <hi>Mary,</hi> ſo ſoon as Biſhop <hi>Tunſtal</hi> was created Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> he petitioned her Majeſty, to reſtore <hi>Gateſheved</hi> to the County of <hi>Durham</hi> again, and that the ſaid Act 7th <hi>Edward</hi> VI. might be repealed; and it was repealed accordingly, and enacted, that the Town of <hi>Gateſheved</hi> ſhould be free from the Corporation of <hi>Newcaſtle, &amp;c. Gardener,</hi> p. 175.</p>
                  <p>ON the ſame Side of the <hi>Tyne,</hi> a little below, are the Fields called the <hi>Salt-Meadows.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN going down the Water, we meet with ſeveral Staiths, ſuch are the Staith of <hi>Richard Ridley,</hi>

                  <p>WHEN the Hoaſtmen renewed their Charter, they had Licence to ſend Coals above the Bill, and Mr. <hi>Coal</hi> procured a Shore at <hi>Friar-Gooſe,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Chapman</hi> procured a Shore upon <hi>Hewith</hi>-Grounds; and Mr. <hi>Robert Brand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling</hi> with much ado got Leave to build a Shore upon his own Ground at <hi>Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin.</hi> In the mean time, the Tenants of the Dean and Chapter at <hi>Durham,</hi> took Liberty to throw their Aſhes into the River, which did much Damage to the Bar.

                     <pb n="173" facs="tcp:0583000100:184"/>WHEN King <hi>James</hi> I. came to the Crown, he was pleaſed to be bounti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his Countrymen; amongſt the reſt, Sir <hi>Henry Gibb</hi> being one of his Officers, he beſtowed upon him the Lordſhip of <hi>Jarrow</hi> and he would have procured a Shore there to caſt Ballaſt; but altho' he had the Favour of the King, yet the Town uſed ſuch Means, and gave ſuch Reaſons to his Majeſty and the Council, that they found it detrimental to the Town, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the River, ſo that he was utterly hindred and diſappointed.</p>
                  <p>BUT after the Death of King <hi>Charles</hi> I. <hi>Thomas Bonner,</hi> and <hi>Robert Elli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> got in to be Magiſtrates; and theſe Men having gotten Wealth and Increaſe by the Rebellion, did purchaſe <hi>Jarrow;</hi> and what could not be done before in a lawful Time, they did bring to paſs at this unlawful Juncture, building a Shore, and caſting Ballaſt, to the great Detriment of the River: And hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Town at Command, Mr. <hi>Bonner</hi> bought St. <hi>Anthony</hi>'s, and <hi>Robert Elliſon</hi> bought <hi>Hebbourn,</hi> and there they both built Shores, and got the Allowance of the Common Council, when they were beyond Reſiſting: And ſince that, Mr. <hi>Carr,</hi> a Man that deſerved well of his preſent Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty [<hi>CHARLES</hi> II.] and the Town, hath procured, that his Brother <hi>Elliſon</hi> (for old <hi>Elliſon</hi>'s Son married his Siſter) ſhould have Liberty to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect his Shore to a great Length, which in Time will utterly overthrow our Navigation; for they will damn out the In-draught, which maketh Rivers far off the Sea be walled out; it will go by, and not come in: And ſome ancient and diſcreet Maſters of Ships have ſaid, <hi>They have not left a Birth to ſave their Ships in, when any Land-ſtood or Storm happens in the River.</hi> Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bank.</p>
                  <p>THE next Place <hi>Jarrow,</hi> or <hi>Girwy,</hi> as it was anciently called, which is a ſmall Village on the South Side of <hi>Tyne,</hi> about 4 Miles diſtant from <hi>Newca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle,</hi> famous for a Monaſtery of learned Men, but more ſo for the Birth, Life, and Death of <hi>venerable BEDE;</hi> ſo named for his ſingular Sanctity, who was born of mean Parents, and at ſeven Years of Age deliver'd to the holy Abbot St. <hi>Benedict</hi> to be educated in his Rule, and being come to Age he profeſſed a Monaſtick Life in the Abbies of <hi>Weremouth,</hi> and <hi>Girwy,</hi> where he became by his conſtant Application to his Studies, ſo compleat a Scholar, that few in that Age, (which bred many very learned Men) were to compare to him, for he was perfectly knowing in the Greek and Latin Tongues, and no leſs perfect in Poetry, Rhetorick, Logick, Phyſicks, Metaphyſikcs, Aſtronomy, Arithmetick, all Eccleſiaſtical Calculations, Muſick, Geometry, Coſmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, Hiſtory, Philoſophy, and Divinity. In ſhort, he had an exact Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of all commendable Sciences, inſomuch that <hi>William of Malmsbury</hi> thus deſcribes him. He was a Man that may more worthily be admired than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended; for he was born in an extream Corner of the World, yet the Light of his Learning ſpread over all Parts of the Earth, he continued a moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Learner 'till he was thirty Years of Age, after which being ordained Prieſt, he betook himſelf to Teaching and Writing. All the Hours he had to ſpare from the Monaſtical Exceriſes of Prayer, and Singing in the Choirs by Day and Night (in which he was conſtant and very devout) he moſt dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently ſpent in his Studies, ſo that his Life was a continual Intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Devotion and Study, he never repairing to his Study 'till he had been at Prayers, nor ever went to Prayers but from his Studies, by which continual Application he penetrated into all Sciences. In his continual Deportment he was ſo grave and ſerious, that the Title of <hi>Venerable</hi> was beſtowed on him while he lived, and ever continued to him after his Death. It appears from Hiſtory that he had at one Time thoſe great Lights of the Church, <hi>Alcuinus,</hi> Preceptor to the Emperor <hi>Charlemaign,</hi> and <hi>Claudius</hi> and <hi>Clemens,</hi> the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the Univerſities of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Pavia</hi> for his Scholars.</p>
                  <p>THIS Character is fully verified by the Books of all Sorts of Learning writ by him. At the End of his Works he gives us a modeſt account of his own
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0583000100:185"/>
Life, together with a Catalogue of his Principal Works. <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> gives us alſo a large Catalogue of his Writings, too long to be ſet down here: Yet we cannot omit ſome of the Principal Works, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>THIS moſt excellent Perſon, being grown old in the Study of Learning, and all Chriſtian Virtues, grew weak and decripit for a Time, and at length on the Tueſday before <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> his Diſtemper grew ſo heavy upon him, that Nature yielded to it, and he died on <hi>Aſcenſion</hi> Day, in the ſeventy ſecond Year of his Age; But others ſay the Ninetieth, <hi>Anno</hi> 734, and was buried in his Monaſtery, but afterwards his Body was tranſlated to <hi>Durham. Magn' Brit' vol 3d,</hi> p. 750.</p>
                  <p>NOR is it to be admired that he ſhould become ſo learned in his Monaſtery, for in former Ages the greater Monaſteries were like Univerſities, wherein not only Humanity, but all the Liberal Sciences, Philoſophy, and Divinity were taught; in the Year 697, he received Deacons Orders from the Hands of <hi>John</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Hexham</hi> afterwards called St. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Beverley,</hi> and in the Year 706 he was ordained Prieſt by the ſame Biſhop.</p>
                  <p>AMONG the ſeveral Ways of accounting for his Epithet of <hi>Venerable,</hi> it has always been eſteemed the moſt pleaſing, though perhaps not the moſt true Account, of what is ſaid to have happened after his Death, <hi>viz.</hi> that one of his Scholars deſigning to make his Epitaph in Hexameter Verſe, which began thus, <hi>Hac ſunt in Foſſa,</hi> and was willing to make it end <hi>Presbiteri oſſa;</hi> But it would not do, at laſt being tired out he fell aſleep, and in the Morning to his great Surprize he found it ſtand thus,

                  <p>NOW the great Churches when the ſaving Light of the Goſpel began to Shine abroad in the World (for it is not impertinent to note thus much) were called <hi>Baſilicae,</hi> becauſe the <hi>Baſilicae</hi> of the Gentiles, namely thoſe ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Buildings where the Magiſtrates held the Courts of Juſtice, were converted to Churches by the Chriſtians; whence <hi>Auſonius, Baſilica olim negotiis plena, nunc votis,</hi> i. e. the <hi>Baſilica</hi> full of Buſineſs heretofore, but now of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion or elſe, becauſe they were built in an oblong Form as the <hi>Baſilicae</hi> were.</p>

                  <p>I have, ſays he, in his Letter to the Royal Society, with much Trouble, got into my Hands a Piece of <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquity, which was but a very few Years ago diſcovered upon the South-bank of the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> near <hi>Sheilds,</hi> in the Biſhoprick; it is a very large and fair <hi>Roman</hi> Altar, of one intire Stone; but after all my Coſt and Pains, I am very ſorry to find the Inſcription very ill defaced, and much of it is not legible, and I believe it has been alſo much miſhandled by thoſe who have endeavoured to read it; whereas if the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Letters had been exactly meaſured, and the Face blacked, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſhed off again, as in Prints, ſome Things more might have been ſpelled.</p>
                  <p>As to the Nature of the Stone itſelf, it is of a coarſe Rag, the ſame with that of the Pyramids at <hi>Burrow-Briggs;</hi> it is four Foot high, and was aſcended to by Steps, which appeareth in all the Sides; but the Front has two Square-holes near the Bottom, which let in the Irons that joined it to the Steps.</p>
                  <p>I have carefully deſigned it on all its Sides, and given the Plan of the Top alſo, which if you pleaſe, we will ſurvey in Order.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. THE Back-ſide, oppoſite to the Inſcription, on which is engraven in Baſs-Relief, a Flower-Pot, furniſhed I ſuppoſe, with what beſt pleaſed the
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0583000100:188"/>
Stone-Cutter; for theſe Men needed not be more curious than the Prieſts themſelves, who were wont to make Uſe of Herbs next Hand, to adorn the Altars, and therefore <hi>Verbenae</hi> is put for any Kind of Herb; yet if we will have it reſemble any Thing with us, I think it is moſt like, if not truly <hi>Nym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaea,</hi> a known and common River Plant.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. ONE of the Sides; which is ſomewhat narrower than the Front or Back, On this are engraved in Baſs-Relief, the cutting Knife <hi>(Ceceſpita)</hi> and the Ax <hi>(ſecuris);</hi> the Knife is exactly the ſame with that on the other Altar, formerly by me mentioned in the Philoſophical Collections of Mr. <hi>Hook;</hi> but the Ax is different, for here it is headed with a long and crooked Point, and there the Head of the Ax is divided into three Points.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The other Side, on which are engraved after the ſame Manner, an Eure <hi>(Urceolus)</hi> and a Ladle which ſerves for a <hi>Sympullum.</hi> This I call rather a Laddle than a Mallet, it being perfectly Diſh-wife, and hollow in the Middle, altho' <hi>Cambden</hi> is of another Opinion in that elegant Sculpt of the <hi>Cumberland</hi> Altar; and the very ſame Utenſil I have ſeen and noted on the <hi>Ickley</hi> Altar, which is yet extant at <hi>Middleton-Grange,</hi> near that Town; but the Stone which <hi>Cambden</hi> ſays ſupports a Pair of Stairs there (as at this Day it does in the very Road) is but an ill Copy of it, and not the Original.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. THE Plan of the Top, which is cut in the Figure of a Baſon (<hi>Diſons</hi> or <hi>Lana</hi>) with <hi>Anſae</hi> on each Side, conſiſting of a Pair of Links of a Chain, which reſt upon, and fall over two Rowles; and this was the Hearth.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. THE Front, which hath an Inſcription in nine Lines in <hi>Roman</hi> Letters, each Letter a little more than two Inches deep of our Meaſure, now remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as in the prefixed Sculpture, Fig. 5. which I would read thus: <hi>Dis, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſque Matribus, pro Salute M. Aurelii Antonii Auguſti Imperatoris votum ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit lubens merito ob reditum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Deae Matres</hi> are well interpreted by <hi>Seldon.</hi> It is much his Safety and Return both vowed, ſhould be ſo ſeparated in the Inſcription; but I have not <hi>Gruter</hi> by me, to compare this with the like. <hi>Caracalla</hi> ſay the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, <note n="l" place="margin">Ziphilinus, Herodianus, &amp;c.</note> after his Father's Death at <hi>York,</hi> took upon him the Command of the Army alone, and the whole Empire; he went alone againſt the Enemy, who were the <hi>Caledonii,</hi> inhabiting beyond the Wall which his Father had built, he made Peace with them, received their Hoſtages, ſlighted their fortified Places, and returned. And this ſeems to be confirmed by the Inſcription; for undoubtedly, upon this laſt Expedition alone, without his Brother <hi>Gera</hi> and Mother, was this Altar erected to him alone, at a Place about two Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this Side the Wall; ſo that the Vow might be as well underſtood of his Return from this Expedition, as for his Saſety and Return to <hi>Rome,</hi> which methinks ſhould be true, or his Mother and Brother <hi>Geta</hi> would ſcarce have been left out, at leaſt ſo early, for yet the Army declared for them both, according to their Father's Will.</p>
                  <p>FURTHER, it ſeems alſo to have been erected by thoſe who flattered him, and who were afterwards killed by him; and for this Reaſon, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who dedicated it, ſeem to me to be Purpoſely defaced, the ſixth and ſeventh Lines of the Inſcription being deſignedly cut away by the Hollowneſs of them, and there not being the leaſt Sign of any Letter remaining. And this I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe might be Part of their Diſgrace, as it was uſual to deface and break the Statues and Monuments of Perſons executed, of which this Monſter made ſtrange Havock; and ſince worn Inſcriptions admit of various Readings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſome Letters are worn out, and ſome more legible, whereby unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced People may conceive them diverſly; I will therefore tell you another reading, Part of theſe two firſt Lines, which I do not diſallow, but that it will agree well enough with the Hiſtory of <hi>Severus,</hi> tho' his <hi>Apotheoſis,</hi> or ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn

                  <p>WE come now to the Mouth of the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> which is a Haven ſo deep as to carry Veſſels of a conſiderable Burthen, and of that Security, that they are not in Danger either of Storms or Shallows, ſave that within leſs than half a Mile of the Bar of <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> (which is a Sand that lies croſs the River's Mouth, not above 7 Foot deep at Low-Water) you meet with many Rocks which are called by the Sailors the <hi>Black Middens,</hi> which are very dangerous, but to prevent any Miſchiefs which may happen to them in the Night Time, there are two Light-houſes, maintained by the <hi>Trinity-houſe</hi> in <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and near them in the Year 1672, was built a Fort, called <hi>Clifford</hi>'s <hi>-Fort,</hi> which effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually commands all the Veſſels that enter the River.</p>

                     <hi>TINMOUTH</hi> called by the <hi>Britains, Pen Ball Cragg. i. e.</hi> the Head of the Rampire upon the Rock, from whence ſome maintain, that the Ditch reached as far as this Place, if the Wall did not; Mr. <hi>Cambden</hi> ſays, that he will not gainſay this Opinion, but adds, that he dares confidently Affirm, that this Place in the Time of the <hi>Romans</hi> was called <hi>Tunacellum,</hi> which ſignifies as much as the Promontory of <hi>Tuna</hi> or <hi>Tina,</hi> where the firſt Cohort (called <hi>Aelia Claſſica,</hi> becauſe it was firſt raiſed by <hi>Aelius Hadrianus,</hi> as the Name ſeems to import) was in pay for Sea Service; for the <hi>Romans</hi> had their <hi>Naves Luſoriae,</hi> or light Frigates in their border Rivers both for the ſuppreſſing the Excurſions of the neighbouring Enemy, and making Incurſions upon him, as may be ſeen in the <hi>Codex Theodoſii,</hi> under the Title <hi>De Luſoriis Danubii, i. e.</hi> Light Veſſels on the <hi>Danube.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>UNDER the <hi>Saxon</hi> Heptarchy this Place was called <hi>Tunaceltep,</hi> not as <hi>Bede</hi> affirms, from the Abbot <hi>Tunna,</hi> a mere romantick Story, which, if we recommend to the Reader, it muſt be only for his Diverſion, and not for any Truth in it, but from it's Situation on the River <hi>Tyne.</hi> Here was anciently
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0583000100:190"/>
a little Monaſtery, which was frequently plundered by the <hi>Danes,</hi> while the <hi>Saxons</hi> ruled. <hi>Magn. Britan. p.</hi> 693.</p>
                  <p>AFTER the Deceaſe of <hi>Oſwyn,</hi> thoſe that had killed him brought his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the Mouth of the River <hi>Tyne,</hi> and there buried it in the Oratory of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s, in the Year 631.</p>
                  <p>IN this Place a Number of illuſtrious Perſons had gathered together, who in a regular Order attended divine Worſhip; who thereby acquired ſuch Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Eſteem, that when any one died of more than ordinary Reputation, whoſe Funeral was to be ſolemnized with more than common Honour, he was uſually buried here.</p>
                  <p>THIS Monaſtery was deſtroyed by <hi>Hinguar</hi> and <hi>Hubba.</hi> The Monks through Fear of Perſecution, fled to a certain little Church of their own, which St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> had dedicated; but the <hi>Danes</hi> finding them out, burnt it and all that were in it.</p>
                  <p>AFTER that <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror had given to <hi>Robert Mowbray</hi> the County of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> the Earl ſhewed a deal of Reſpect to St. <hi>Oſwyn,</hi> and the Church he was buried in (for the Church was founded within the Precincts of his Caſtle). He gifted it with a Number of Lands, and placed in it Monks which came from St. <hi>Albans,</hi> and yet it is ſaid by ſome that <hi>Toſti</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland</hi> laid the Foundation of this Monaſtery; but it's much more probable it was the former, becauſe he brought the Monks from St. <hi>Albans;</hi> but it will appear a great deal more likely when we come to the following Grant or Charter of <hi>William Rufus,</hi> for making of it a Cell to <note n="k" place="margin">

                  <p>THIS Monaſtery being afterwards fortified, and turned into a ſtrong Hold, was called <hi>Tinmouth</hi>-Caſtle; which Name it ſtill bears, and as ſuch, glories both of its Statelineſs and Strength; (for as an ancient Author ſpeaks) it is inacceſſibly ſeated upon a very high Rock towards the Ocean on the Eaſt and North, and elſewhere, ſo well mounted, that a ſlender Garriſon may make it good.

                  <p>JOHN of <hi>Whethamſtede,</hi> thirty third Abbot of St. <hi>Albans,</hi> was ſo called from the Place of his Birth, a Village near St. <hi>Albans;</hi> but the Name of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily was <hi>Boſtock;</hi> he was a Monk of the Priory of <hi>Tinmouth,</hi> and gave, after he came to be Abbot, a Chalice of pure Gold, and of great Weight, to that Priory; his Character can't be better drawn up, than in <hi>Stephen</hi>'s Monaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, from whence we have this Account:

That is: <hi>This Stone covers the Bones of the Venerable</hi> John Wethamſtede, <hi>who was Abbot here in his Time, moſt learned, a Lover of learned Men, and kind to them.</hi> He did not connive at any Faults in the Clergy; he was as zealous as <hi>Phineas</hi> againſt lewd Perſons, and as <hi>John</hi> againſt Adulterers, and even as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> againſt Simoniacks. He was ſo great a Repairer of old tatter'd Houſes and Marks, that none paſt exceeded him in that Particular, or is there any equal to him. He is recorded to have left behind him Ten thouſand Marks clear. Do you the Convent of St. <hi>Albans</hi> hourly pray for the Soul of him that loved you.</p>
                  <p>THIS famous Monaſtery, which was of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> Order, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of a Prior and fifteen Monks, was ſuppreſs'd <hi>Jan.</hi> 12th, in the 30th <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. It was valued at 397 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> 5 <hi>d. per annum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>KING <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. converted the Caſtle into a Defence and Fortification againſt foreign Invaſions.</p>
                  <p>THE Ruins of the Monaſtery are ſtill to be ſeen in the Caſtle, near which alſo was the Pariſh-Church; but that being gone much to Decay, and the Pariſhioners in the late Civil Wars being often debarred of the Liberty of a free Reſort to it, another was begun to be re-built in the Year 1659; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards finiſhed, was conſecrated by Biſhop <hi>Coſins</hi> in the Year 1668. In the former Church we may ſuppoſe it was, where <hi>Malcom</hi> King of <hi>Scots,</hi> ſlain with his Son <hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Scotland,</hi> by <hi>Robert Mowbray</hi> Earl of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> was buried. This King <hi>Malcom</hi> had barbarouſly plundered and ravaged theſe Northern Parts five Times, once in <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor's Days, twice in the Conqueror's, and twice in <hi>William Rufus</hi>'s; in the laſt of which Invaſions he met with his Fate, by that juſt Providence, who often retaliates Wrongs in the Place they are done, as he found; for he was killed in this Country, where he had ſlain and deſtroyed many: But King

                     <hi>William</hi> did not proſecute his Revenge further, as he might have done with Succeſs, but eſtabliſhed his Son on his Throne, notwithſtanding the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Deſign of his Uncle <hi>Donald</hi> to deprive him of it, which he had done, had not King <hi>William</hi> aided him to obtain it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>JOHN</hi> of <hi>Tinmouth</hi> was born in this Town, and is ſaid to have been the Vicar of it, but afterwards became a <hi>Benedictine Monk</hi> in the Abbey of St. <hi>Albans;</hi> he was a moſt virtuous Perſon, and excellently learned, entirely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the Study of the Holy Scriptures, and of ſacred Hiſtory. He ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered the Lives and Actions of the Saints of <hi>England, Wales, Scotland</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> with great Judgment and indefatigable Labour, which Work he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, <hi>Sanctilogium ſervorum Dei,</hi> i. e. <hi>The ſacred Hiſtory of the Servants of GOD.</hi> Nor did he deſerve leſs Commendation for his Expoſitions of the Holy Scripture, in which he not only explains the literal Senſe, but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, allegorical, and tropological; his Commentaries were upon all the Books from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to the <hi>Kings</hi> incluſive. He wrote alſo other Books, as <hi>Church-Leſſons, The Golden Hiſtory,</hi> and a <hi>Supplement</hi> to the ſame, an <hi>Appendix</hi> to his <hi>Martyrology,</hi> &amp;c. He flouriſhed about the Year 1366.</p>
                  <p>THE Church has perhaps been a Building of as much Art and Curioſity, as any one in the whole Kingdom; nay, when we behold it at preſent, in the Midſt of Ruins, we are ſtruck with Aw, and the utmoſt Veneration; whether it is a Reflection on the extenſive Charity of ancient Days, the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing Fineneſs of the Maſonry, or whether there is ſomething naturally moving in thoſe ancient Remains; but ſo it is, that it never fails to command a ſolemn Aw, and a ſilent Commiſeration.</p>

                     <hi>TINMOUTH</hi> at preſent is a pretty large Village, and is much reſorted to in the Summer-Seaſon, it having the Prior's Haven in it, which is a moſt convenient retired Place for Bathing.</p>

After ſo barbarous an Action, not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to ſtay any longer in <hi>England,</hi> he retired into <hi>Flanders</hi> to Earl <hi>Baldwin</hi> his Father-in-law.

                                    <hi>After King</hi> Edward <hi>had declared War againſt</hi> Scotland, <hi>he advanced to</hi> Newcaſtle, <hi>and made it the chief Rendezvous of his Forces.</hi> Rapin. <hi>The Story at large is this. King</hi> John <hi>of</hi> Scotland <hi>having in Contempt of King</hi> Edward <hi>diſſeiſed</hi> Magdulph <hi>Earl of</hi> Fife, <hi>and impriſon'd him;</hi> Magdulph <hi>complain'd to King</hi> Edward, <hi>who order'd King</hi> John <hi>to appear before him; but upon this Summons he appeared not. Upon this the King ſent out a ſecond Writ, ordering him to appear before him</hi> 15 <hi>Days after</hi> Michaelmas, <hi>which was obey'd. Being come before him, he ſeem'd not ſo ſenſible of the King's Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority, as he had been before; which was judged a Contempt and Diſobedience, and that three of his principal Caſtles in</hi> Scotland <hi>ſhould be ſeized. But before the Pronunciation of the Sentence, He came before the King and his Council, and made Supplication to the King with his own Mouth; the King receiving this, with the Advice of his Council, and the Conſent of</hi> Magdulph, <hi>granted his Prayer, and gave him Day untill his Parliament af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Eaſter. But that Parliament was not holden that Day; however the Suit between the King of</hi> Scots <hi>and,</hi> Magdulph <hi>was continued, and prorogued to the next Parliament, which was ſummoned to be holden at St.</hi> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund<hi>'s</hi>-Bury, <hi>on the Feaſt of St.</hi> Martin <hi>in the Winter, in the year</hi> 1295.</p>

                                    <hi>The Day being come, the King was preſent, and</hi> Magdulph <hi>ſtrenuouſly proſecuted his Plea. But the King of</hi> Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>inſtead of appearing in Perſon, ſent the Abbot of</hi> Abirbrothock, <hi>and other Noblemen of that Kingdom, with not only frivolous excuſes, but to demand Satisfaction of King</hi> Edward <hi>for many and great Injuries, Oppreſſions, and Grievances, ſuſtained by the</hi> Scots <hi>from his Subjects. King</hi> Edward <hi>'s Anſwer was, That for certain Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes he was coming toward the</hi> North Parts, <hi>and that the King of</hi> Scots <hi>ſhould then have ſufficient Recompence to his own Content. And then appointed him a Day to meet him at</hi> Newcaſtle <hi>upon</hi> Tyne, <hi>viz. The 1ſt day of</hi> March <hi>next following, and ordered the Abbot and thoſe with him, to give Notice to their King that he ſhould then perſonally appear.

                                          <hi>David</hi> King of <hi>Scots</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umberland,</hi> exerciſing all Manner of Hoſtility, and waſting and Ravaging all before him, for about <hi>40</hi> Miles in length, 'till he came to <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne,</hi> which he reſolved to Beſiege, and ſo ſat down with all his Forces before it: The Captain of the Caſtle was the Lord <hi>John Nevil</hi> of <hi>Hornby,</hi> a Perſon of great Conduct and Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very who reſolving to give the young King of <hi>Scotland</hi> a Taſte of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Valour, as ſoon as might be, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded <hi>200</hi> Lances to make a Sally very early next Morning. Theſe daſhing ſuddenly with great Fury into the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Hoaſt, on that Part where the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> was (who, as they ſay, was chief General for the Time, the King himſelf keeping private) took the Earl himſelf naked in Bed, dragg'd him away naked out of his Tent;
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0583000100:208"/>
and ſo having ſlain ſeveral of his Men, and won much Booty, they return'd all ſafe into the Town with great Joy, and delivered the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> Priſoner to their Captain. The Earl was a chief Prince of the Blood in <hi>Scotland,</hi> next of Quality to Prince <hi>Robert Stuart</hi> and the Earl of <hi>Southerland;</hi> but for Valour and Conduct he yielded to None. This daring Enterprize having alarmed the whole Camp, the <hi>Scots</hi> ran like Madmen to the Barriers of the Town, and began a fierce Aſſault, which they continued a great while with much Pertinency. But they gain'd little and loſt much. For there were many good Men of War within, who defended themſelves with much Reſolution and Diſcretion, ſo that the <hi>Scots</hi> were at laſt fain to leave off their attac, and the Hopes of ſuddenly revenging their Diſhonour in that Place. Wherefore that bold and lucky Attempt of the Beſieged being thus well back'd by a vigorous Defence, was ſufficient to perſuade King <hi>David</hi> and his Council, that to dally about <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> was dangerous, whereupon about Noon they decamp'd and went for <hi>Durham.</hi>
                                       </p>
                                       <p>Aſſoon as the Lord <hi>Nevil</hi> had ſeen for certain the Departure of the <hi>Scots,</hi> he gueſs'd their Deſign. Upon which he mounted a very ſwift Gelding, and coaſting wide of the <hi>Scots,</hi> rode Poſt Day and Night; 'till on the 5th Night he rode more than <hi>200</hi> Miles to <hi>Chertſey</hi> in <hi>Surry,</hi> where at that Time King <hi>Edward</hi> lay, to whom he exactly related all he knew of the <hi>Scots,</hi> whereupon the <hi>King</hi> made all the Haſte he could Northward.</p>
                                       <p>In the mean Time the <hi>Scots</hi> aſſaulted <hi>Durham</hi> with all the Fury imaginable; for they were even ſtark mad for the former Affront they had received at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> when they loſt the Earl of <hi>Murray</hi> ſo diſhonourably. They rear'd their Engines to caſt Stones, and other Devices they had, whereby to approach the Walls under the Shelter of certain Machines, reſembling the ancient <hi>Teſtudo</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> or the <hi>Synoſpiſmus</hi> of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> and withall they had other Engines running upon Wheels, wherein on Lofts as high as the <hi>Walls</hi> at leaſt, there were <hi>Croſs-Bows</hi> and others, who kept the Beſieged from the Defences. So that after the Aſſault had been continual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renewed with all the Vigour imaginable, and on the other Hand maintained with incredible Obſtinacy for <hi>6</hi> or <hi>7</hi> Days, the <hi>Scots</hi> entred the City by Force; at which Time King <hi>David</hi> in revenge of all his Loſſes for ſo many years preceding, eſpecially being urged beyond his Nature by the importunate Inſtigations of his <hi>French</hi> Auxiliaries then with him, commanded his Captains to put all to Fire and Sword. There were Men, Women, and Children, old and young, Men of the Church, as <hi>Monks, Prieſts, Canons,</hi> and others, holy and prophane, all without Pity or Diſtinction put to Death, neither <hi>Churches, Monaſteries,</hi> nor <hi>Shrines,</hi> no not that of St. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf (after it had repoſed there for more than <hi>300</hi> years) could reconcile the incens'd Mind of the Soldiers to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; not ſo much as one Soul was left alive within the Place. So implacable and unmerciful is the Sword of War when ſharpen'd with unchriſtian Cruelty.</p>
                                       <p>Before the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Army got back to its own Country, the King of <hi>England</hi> was upon their Heels; but there were certain <hi>Noblemen</hi> on both Parts, who earneſtly labour'd to compoſe the Matters between the two <hi>Kings,</hi> which at laſt took ſuch Effect, that a Truce was concluded for two years. <hi>Barns.

                                             <p>I cannot leave this Liſt, without obſerving to the great Honour of that loyal and brave Town, that <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> is not exceeded in its Number of Ships by any one of all the 33 Ports nam'd in the ſaid En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolment of the North Fleet. <hi>Yarmouth</hi> alone excepted. And how can it poſſibly detract from the Glory of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> to be then out-done by <hi>Yarmouth,</hi> when (which is very ſurprizing) that ſame great <hi>Yar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> fitted out a vaſtly greater Number both of Men and Ships, than <hi>London</hi> itſelf, the great Metropolis of the Kingdom, furniſh'd his Grace with for the memorable Siege of <hi>Calais,</hi> where he (I mean King <hi>Edward</hi> III.) and his Son the Black Prince acquir'd ſuch Renown to the Engliſh, as will render themſelves and the Engliſh Nation famous to ſucceeding Ages.</p>
                                             <p>There is one Thing more I muſt take Notice of before I conclude, which is, that the aforemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fleet Roll has no Date. I think it was about the Year 1347, when the Engliſh laid Siege to Calais, tho' I can't certainly tell, not having an Engliſh Hiſtory by me at preſent. This is all I can find upon a curſory View of the Book that has any Relation to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> begging Leave, in the mean Time, to ſubſcribe myſelf,</p>

Our preſent Lord the King for the Health of the Soul of his Father, being willing to fulfil and continue his Will in this Part, hath granted to the aforeſaid Monks as a Compenſation of the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Corn and Wine, thirteen Marks and ten Shillings, to be received every year at the Feaſt of St. <hi>Michael</hi> by the Hands of the Mayor and Bailiffs of the ſaid Town of <hi>Newcaſtle</hi> upon <hi>Tyne</hi> then being, from the Fee of the ſaid Town, namely, Five Marks for every Tun of Wine, and five Shillings for every Quarter of Corn, to be paid to the ſaid Monks and their Succeſſors dwelling in the foreſaid Iſland as his Alms for ever; and he produces in Court the foreſaid Charter of our preſent Lord the King, which teſtifies this, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And he prays Aſſiſe: Let an Aſſiſe therefore be taken, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                                                   </p>
                                                   <p>By a Recognition of the aforeſaid Aſſiſe, they ſay upon their Oath, that the aforeſaid Prior was ſeiſed of the foreſaid Rent with the Appurtenances, 'till the foreſaid <hi>Peter</hi> and others diſſeiſed him, to the Loſs of the ſaid Prior forty one Pounds, thirteen Shillings and four Pence. It follows therefore that the aforeſaid Prior may thence re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Seiſine againſt thoſe by a Sight of the Recognition of the Aſſiſe aforeſaid; and his Loſſes aforeſaid; and the ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> and others are in the Injury.

Before whom at length this Man was convened the next Year, as a Sower of Sedition among the Queen's Subjects: Here the Archbiſhop examined him; he acknowledged he was ordained by Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal <hi>Pole,</hi> but ſaid that he was fallen off from <hi>Rome,</hi> and that he was a Preacher of the Goſpel; but that he had no Licence to preach from any of the Biſhops, ſince the Reformation. And when the Archbiſhop asked him, if he had no ſuch Licence, how any could be aſſured that he was not of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church? He would prove that by his Prayers and Sermons, wherein he had ſpoken againſt <hi>Rome</hi> and the <hi>Pope,</hi> as much as any of the Clergy. And he pretented, that it was Licence enough to preach, to have the Spirit which he ſaid he had. When the Archbiſhop again demanded, whether that could be the Spirit, that complied not with the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0583000100:237"/>
of the Church, lately purged and cleanſed from Idolatry? He replied, he endeavoured to make the Church purer than it was. This Man had a Congregation, that followed him; which he termed Men of tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences: And with them he prayed and preached, and adminiſtred the Sacrament. When he preached in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, he would be abſent till the Divine Service were over (for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Liturgy he could not away with) and then he could come into the Church and preach.</q>

                                 <p>This Year was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended at <hi>Glaſgow</hi> one <hi>Ogleby</hi> a Jeſuit, ſent by Command of his Superiors in the College of <hi>Gratts</hi> in <hi>Stiria:</hi> By the King's Command, he was interrogated upon five ſeveral Queſtions; <hi>viz.</hi> Whether the Pope be Judge <hi>in Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tualibus</hi> over his Majeſty; and whether <hi>in Temporalibus,</hi> if it be in <hi>Ordine ad Spiritualia?</hi> Whereto he anſwers in Writing to the firſt Part affirmatively, <hi>in Spiritualibus;</hi> but whether <hi>in Temporalibus,</hi> he is not obliged to anſwer to any but a Judge of Controverſies in Religion, the Pope, or one of his Authority. <hi>2.</hi> Whether the Pope has a Power to depoſe Kings after their Excommunication, and in particular his Majeſty? To this he anſwer'd, He will not declare but to a lawful Judge of Religion. <hi>3.</hi> Whether the Pope hath Power to excommunicate Kings, ſuch as are not of his Church, as his Majeſty? To this he anſwer'd affirmatively; and that all People baptiz'd are under the Pope's Power. <hi>4.</hi> Whether it be no Murder to kill the King ſo depoſed? <hi>5.</hi> Whether he hath Power to aſſoil Subjects from the Oath of their Allegiance to his Majeſty? To theſe he anſwers <hi>ut ſupra.</hi>

                                 <p>He railed at the Oath of Allegiance as damnable and treaſonable againſt God; ſo became unworthy of Mercy, and order'd to prepare for his Trial; and the Evening before it began, was told, that he was not to be tried for any thing relating to his Religion, but for his former Anſwers to the Queſtions, which he may recal, and crave Mercy: This he utterly refuſed. Upon his Trial, he proteſts not to acknowledge the Judges nor Judgment lawful: The King to have no Authority but derivative from his Predeceſſors, who acknowledged the Pope's Juriſdiction: If the King will be to me, as they were to mine, he ſhall be my King; if otherwiſe, I value him not: And that I repent only for not having been ſo buſy as I ſhould in that which you call perverting of Subjects, and I call ſaving of Souls: I do decline the King's Authority, and will do it ſtill in Matters of Religion; moſt of your Miniſters maintain it, and if they be wiſe, will continue in that Mind. His inſolent Speech was ſhortned by the Jurors quick Return, who found him guilty, and he had Sentence of Treaſon; and to ſtop his Raillery, he was after Noon the ſame Day hanged at <hi>Glaſgow.</hi>

                                 <p>He was a deſperate ſecond <hi>Ravillae,</hi> and ready in that Deviliſh Doctrine of Depoſing and Dethroning Kings; which he urged the more (he ſaid) as conſonant to the Kir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                                 <p>King <hi>James</hi> at his going into <hi>Scotland</hi> this Year, gave Directions for repairing and orderly adorning his Chapel, and Officers ſent out of <hi>England</hi> with Neceſſaries, and ſome Portraits and Pictures of the Apoſtles carved for the Pews and Stalls; but the People exclaim at the Sights, that ſuch Images were to be ſet up; the Organs were come before, and after comes the Maſs. The King was angry at their Ignorance, and ſent them word to diſtinguiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Pictures intended for Ornament and Decoration, and Images erected for Worſhip and Adoration.

Which Truſt they thought he well deſerved, ſuch was his Zeal to the Cauſe, that tho' both his Father and himſelf owed all their Wealth and Greatneſs to the King's Bounty, yet he was one of the firſt that engaged againſt him.

This Tragical Event being reported at Court, the Royaliſts were not ſo moderate in their Conſures as the King himſelf, who only ſaid, that he had been very ungrateful to him, yet he was ſorry he had not Time to repent.</p>

                                       <p>On the 15th of <hi>January,</hi> this year, in a diſmal ſnowy Seaſon, the <hi>Scots,</hi> contrary to all Faith and Loyalty, paſſed the River <hi>Tweed</hi> at <hi>Berwick,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company'd by a ſelect Committee of their own, and there met another from <hi>England,</hi> who were to conduct and ſupply them in the moſt loving Manner: Upon their Conjunction, was framed the General Committee of both Kingdoms, and in Effect became a united Camp-Parliament. Before the Advance of the Army by a Trumpeter, they ſent a Letter to Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham,</hi> and the reſt of the Commanders and Gentlemen of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at <hi>Alnwick;</hi> in which they inſiſted upon the Solemn League and Covenant, and declared their well-weighed Reſolutions, to prevent that imminent Danger, not only of Corruption, but of Ruin, which they ſaw evidently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to the true Proteſtant Religion, by the Popiſh and Prelatical Faction; and to reſcue his Majeſty's Perſon and Honour from the Counſels of thoſe, whoſe Ends are little better than Popery and Tyranny. Therefore, they expected the Concurrence of them, and all others; and if they met with any Oppoſition, the Law of Nature, and their own Reaſon, would tell them what they are to expect. With this Letter they ſent alſo a Copy of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Declaration, to give it the greater Force and Authority among the Vulgar.</p>
                                       <p>The brave Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham,</hi> after a ſerious Conſultation with the Officers and Gentry, how moſt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commode the Enemy's March, returned a ſharp Anſwer; in which he and the reſt declare. That, without the Sight of that Letter, they could not have believed that the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Nation, or the preſent prevailing Party in that Nation, would have attempted an Invaſion of <hi>England,</hi> ſo contrary to the Laws of God, of Nations, and of both Kingdoms, but eſpecially to the late Act of Pacification; ſo oppoſite to their Allegiance and Gratitude to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to that neighbourly Love they pretend, to that diſcreet Care they ſhould have of their own Safety. They declare, that no Order of Committees whatſoever, of Men, or Angels, could give Power to make War againſt their natural Sovereign, upon the empty Pretence of nameleſs evil Counſellors; and for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Agents, they could not believe them any Commiſſioners lawfully authorized by the Two Houſes of Parliament, or yet by the Houſe of Commons, whence ſo many Members were expell'd by partial Voting, ſo many baniſhed by ſeditious Tumults, ſo many voluntarily abſent out of Conſcience; where Deſperation, Want of Opportunity to depart, or Fear of certain Plunder, were the chief Bonds which held the little Remnant together from Diſſipation , where the venerable Name of <hi>Parliament</hi> was made a State to countenance the pernicious Counſels and Acts of a cloſe Committee.</p>
                                       <p>As to the <hi>Scots,</hi> they declare, that no Covenant whatſoever could juſtify ſuch Proceedings, begun without any Neceſſity, or ſo much as Provocation. After anſwering their Pretenſions, they deſire them to conſider, that there muſt be an Account given to God of all the Blood which ſhould be ſhed in this Quarrel: And ſince their Inſults
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0583000100:244"/>
were ſuch, that a vanquiſhed Nation could ſcarce endure, from their Conquerors, they could not think they were grown ſo ſame, as to deſert ther Religion, Laws, Liberties, and Eſtates, upon Command of Foreigners; and to ſuffer themſelves to be made Beggars, and Slaves, without Oppoſition.</p>
                                       <p>Theſe Paper-Skirmiſhes had no other Effect, than to gain ſome little Time for Sir <hi>Thomas Glenham</hi> to draw his Forces and Artillery to <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> for <hi>Alnwick</hi> was not tenable; beſides, he found ſeveral of the Gentlemen of <hi>Northumberland,</hi> eſpecially ſuch as were allied to the Lord <hi>Grey</hi> of <hi>Wark,</hi> either for fear of the <hi>Scotch,</hi> or Affection to their Cauſe, were very backward in oppoſing the Enemy. The <hi>Scotch</hi> marched after him by ſlow and difficult Marches, by Reaſon of the Snow and Floods, and on the 3d of <hi>February</hi> ſummoned the Town of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> but finding they were not able to take the Place, after three Weeks Stay, and ſome Skirmiſhes, they paſſed the River <hi>Tyne</hi> on the 28th of <hi>February,</hi> and on the 4th of <hi>March</hi> entred <hi>Sunderland.</hi> The Marquis of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral for the King in theſe <hi>Northern</hi> Parts, having reinforced his Army to about <hi>14,000</hi> Horſe and Foot, attended ſo near the <hi>Scotch</hi> Army, and ſo intercepted their Supplies, that ſometimes they had neither Meat nor Drink, and were never poſſeſſed of above twenty-four Hours Proviſion; but they coloured over their neceſſity by keeping a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Faſt; and preſſing on towards <hi>Durham</hi> for better Quarters, to ſtop their advancing, on the Twenty-third of <hi>March</hi> the Marquis drew up his Army at <hi>Hilton,</hi> on the <hi>North</hi> of the River <hi>Were;</hi> the <hi>Scots</hi> were drawn up on <hi>Whitburn Lizard,</hi> a Hill <hi>Eaſt</hi> from them, adjoining to the Sea: So the Armies faced each other, and skir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed in Parties; the Field-Word given by the Marquis being prophetically enough, <hi>Now or Never;</hi> and by the <hi>Scots,</hi> in their aſſuming Way, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts is with us.</hi> The Marquis not being able to force the <hi>Scots</hi> to a Battle, retreated towards his Quarters at <hi>Durham,</hi> and the <hi>Scots</hi> followed ſlowly, but could make no conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Advance, till the Lord <hi>Fairfax,</hi> and the reſt of the Parliament Forces, by a new Diverſion, gave them Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to deſcend into <hi>Yorkſhire.

Sir <hi>John Marley,</hi> Sir <hi>Nicholas Cole,</hi> and Sir <hi>George Barker,</hi> got into the Caſtle, where being forced by Neceſſity, they came to a Capitulation, and ſurrender'd on the 27th of the ſame Month. The Town being taken by Aſſault, was ſufficiently plunder'd; but the Surrendry proved of great Importance to the City of <hi>London,</hi> where the poorer Sort of People, for the two laſt Years, were almoſt ſtarved for want of Fewel, Coals having been riſen to the Price of <hi>4 l.</hi> a Chaldron; a Price never known before that Time. <hi>Echard.</hi>

And no marvel, for they were accounted <hi>30,000</hi> Men, and the Townſmen were but, in all, <hi>1500</hi> Men, wearied with continual Watch and Duty, tho' Men of great Courage, and ſought it gallantly to the laſt; for the <hi>Newgate</hi> Ward, which was under Capt. <hi>Cuthbert Carr,</hi> was taken by the Enemy, who entered at the aſoreſaid Places, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed them before and behind; and <hi>Pilgrim-ſtreet</hi> Gate was maintained by Capt. <hi>George Errington,</hi> Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant <hi>William Robſon,</hi> and Enſign <hi>Thomas Swan,</hi> who ſought and killed very many, they themſelves not having one hurt, until they were encompaſſed by the Enemy before and behind: And even then they would not parley with the <hi>Scots</hi> who fought againſt them without, but did capitulate with Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Sinclair,</hi> who loved and honoured them, and kept his Agreement ſo well with them, that not one of them was robbed of his Cloaths or Money, nor were any of his Men ſuffered to give any evil Word; and it was the great Bleſſing of God, that, in all that Time, there was not one Man ſlain, nor hurt, altho' that Company conſiſted of Nineſcore Men, all TradeſMen, and there were divers Sallies made out at that Gate; for it was the longeſt of all the Gates of the Town, it being barrocaded and ſhut up. And after they had ſurrender'd, and the Enemy was called over at that Breach, they durſt not approach, but ſhot at their Friends that called them, and would not believe that the Town was taken.

                                 <p>In this year, when King <hi>Charles I.</hi> by his ill Succeſs, was reduced to the loweſt Ebb, he, upon ſome Aſſurances of Protection from the <hi>Scots,</hi> then beſieging <hi>Newark,</hi> repaired to their Army, and immediately gave Orders to the Lord <hi>Bellaſis</hi> to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render <hi>Newark,</hi> which might have held out ſeveral Months longer; which done, the <hi>Scots</hi> Army, before they could have received any Orders from the Parliament, with uncommon Expedition, marched with him to <hi>New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle,</hi> where they arrived May the <hi>13th.</hi> About the Middle of <hi>July</hi> the Parliament ſent their Commiſſioners, the Earls of <hi>Pembroke</hi> and <hi>Suffolk,</hi> of the Peers, and Sir <hi>Walter Earl,</hi> Sir <hi>John Hippiſley, Robert Goodwin,</hi> and <hi>Luke Robinſon,</hi> Eſqrs. for the Commons, with <hi>10</hi> Propoſitions for his Majeſty to aſſent to, [<hi>See</hi> Ruſhworth.] Demands of ſuch a horrid and deſtructive Nature, as would, if granted, have render'd the King and his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory inglorious and deſpicable both at home and abroad. The King perceiving all Things tending to his Ruin, he ſeemed to hearken moſt to his old falſe Friend <hi>William Murray</hi> of the Bed-Chamber, who privately propoſed an Eſcape, and offered to make his Way, and to have a ſhip in Readineſs to tranſport his Majeſty beyond Sea. The Project appeared plauſible, and the King had diſguiſed himſelf for it, but was diſcovered in the Attempt. Whether he was faithful to his Majeſty in this Point, is uncertain, ſince Sir <hi>Robert Murray</hi> was concerned in it; but Biſhop <hi>Guthry</hi> ſays it was divulged before the ſet Time, ſo that there was no Diſcourſe throughout the Army but of <hi>Murray</hi>'s Plot to carry away the King. Thereupon a Guard of Soldiers was immediately planted at his Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, Door, both within and without; by which his Majeſty was not only deprived of Liberty, but alſo of Quiet and Retirement; and having an Antipathy againſt Tobacco, was much diſturbed by their bold and continual ſmoaking in his Preſence: A military Preſage of the ſame heatheniſh Barbarity at going to the Block before <hi>Whitehall.</hi>
                                 </p>
                                 <p>Upon his Majeſty's Entry into <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> he was careſſed with Bonfires and Ringing of Bells, Drums and Trumpets, and Peals of Ordnance; but guarded by <hi>300</hi> of the <hi>Scottiſh</hi> Horſe, theſe near him bare-headed. He lodged at General <hi>Levin</hi>'s Quarters, who proclaims that Papiſts or Delinquents ſhould not come near his Perſon.</p>
                                 <p>And that altho' his Majeſty was preſent, yet all Men whatſoever ſhould yield Obedience to the Ordinance of Parliament.</p>
                                 <p>The <hi>Scotch</hi> Army are now, they imagine, Maſters of all, by their Power of the King's Perſon, and levy into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable Taxes and Aſſeſſments upon all <hi>Northern</hi> Counties, which very courſely reſent them, and complain to the Parliament at <hi>Weſtminſters,</hi> not without ſome Riſing of the People ſtanding upon their Guard: And all the <hi>Scotch</hi> Horſ formerly ſent into <hi>Scotland</hi> are return'd into <hi>Yorkſhire;</hi> which makes the Houſe of Common debate and vote, That this Kingdom had no further Need of the Army of our Brethren the <hi>Scots</hi> in this Kingdom, and that the Sum of <hi>100,000 l.</hi> ſhould be advanced and paid to that Army as followeth, <hi>viz, 50,000 l.</hi> thereof after their ſurrendring of <hi>Newcaſtle, Carliſle,</hi> and other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Garriſons poſſeſſed by them in <hi>England,</hi> and the other <hi>50,000 l.</hi> after they are advanced into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and Order ſhall be taken for Payment of their Arrears.</p>

And laſtly, that alleit he never eſteem'd any Authority equal to the Scripture, yet he thanks the numerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Fathers, and the univerſal Practice of the Primitive Church, to be the beſt and Authentical Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of God's Word, and consequently the pureſt Judges between him and <hi>Henderſon,</hi> until better may be ſound;

                                 <p>Only the King was rid of one troubleſome Gueſt Mr. <hi>Henderſon;</hi> who had been diſputed into ſo much Reaſon and Underſtanding, that being convinced by the King, he fell into ſome Diſtemper at <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> and therefore was ſent home to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where he died perfectly reconciled to the King's Affairs, and an Apoſtate from the <hi>Scots</hi> Army and their Proceedings. <hi>Sanderſon's</hi> Hiſt. of K. <hi>Charles I. p. 904, 905, 921.</hi>

Wee muſt ſtill endeavour to keep our firſt Integrity without Spott and Blemiſh, for if wee would never bow the Knee to <hi>Baal</hi> at the King's Command, wee will never do it at the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament's; and if they act againſt the Truth repoſed in them by the People, the People are bound in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and Duty to act againſt them, <hi>Salus Populi</hi> being <hi>Suprema Lex.</hi> The Lord direct Us for his Glory, and the Good of the poor Commons of <hi>England,</hi> who are like to be bought and ſold, becauſe they are ignorant of their own Freedom and Birth-right, which they are willing to ſell for a Meaſe of Pottage, ſo they may injoy a ſlaviſh Peace, though it hath coſt much precious Blood in the Time of their Proſecution of this unnatural War for the Preſervation of them.</p>

But on the other Side, I am ſorry to hear from you, that you have had neither any Information, nor any Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence given you againſt ſuch unlawful Aſſemblies in your Town, when the Notoriety of the Fact, by their numerous Meeting at your Barber-Chirurgeon<hi>'s</hi> Hall upon <hi>All-Saints</hi> Day laſt, being <hi>Sunday</hi> the 1ſt of <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember,</hi> was ſuch, that it was voic'd and made known to all the Town and Country about; Notice being alſo taken what ſpecial <hi>Pſalm,</hi> or <hi>New Rejoicing Song,</hi> they then choſe and applied to themſelves, as <hi>Holy Saints,</hi> of <hi>Bearing a double-edged Sword in their Hands to bind kings in Chains and Lords in Iron Bands:</hi> of which notorious and unlawful Meeting both my ſelf and divers others here at this Diſtance were ſhortly
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0583000100:252"/>
after informed; and I took the beſt Care I could thereupon to have an Addreſs made unto you, Mr. Mayor, by a ſpecial Perſon under my Epiſcopal Juriſdiction, to deſire you that you would not ſuffer any ſuch ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous and offenſive Meetings to be, held among you, contrary to the known Laws of this Church and Realm of <hi>England,</hi> and greatly endangering the Publick Peace thereof: And this I did before I acquainted his Majeſty or his Principal Secretaries with it; neither was there any Letter ſent to you and the Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from his Majeſty concerning this Matter, before a ſecond Information came both to my ſelf, and Mr. <hi>Brabant,</hi> one of your own Society, of another numerous and unlawful Meeting at one of the Ringleader's Houſes, upon the 25th of <hi>November,</hi> wherein they appointed and kept a Faſt, with Preaching and Praying, which they held out from Eight a Clock in the Morning till Four in the Evening, the Work being held forth by their four chief Leaders and Abettors, Mr. <hi>Gilpine,</hi> Mr. <hi>Durant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Leaver,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Pringle.</hi> Of all which ſurely you had or might have had Knowledge; and if you had not, you will give me Leave to ſay, without Offence, that many of your Townſmen are very backward in diſcovering to you and arreſting their Knowledge of ſuch diſorderly Aſſemblies, and that you are very great Strangers to the Affairs and Diſturbances of your own Town, the Government whereof, under his Majeſty, is committed to your Care.</p>
                                       <p>It is well taken that, as you write, you have proceeded and convicted ſeveral of theſe diſobedient Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons already, and that you will take Care to prevent their Meetings againſt Law for Time to come; which good Reſolution being obſerved by you, will highly pleaſe his Majeſty, and expreſs the Duty that we owe to his Laws, and the good Government of this Realm: Otherwiſe, if we any ways neglect to do herein what belongs to us, we ſhall deſervedly ſuffer the Blame of it, and incur the King's Diſpleaſure, which always moſt carefully to avoid, is the bounden Duty both of you and my ſelf, who am,</p>

However, for my better Satisfaction, I wrote to a Friend of mine in <hi>London,</hi> and requeſted him to conſult ſome able Civilian about it, and ſend me down his Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. The Quaere which I ſent up was expreſſed in theſe very Words:</p>
                                                <p>
                                                   <q>Whether an Impropriator be obliged, of common Right, to repair and uphold the Chancels, not only of the Mother-Church, but of all the Chappels likewiſe within the Rectory; and whether the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction of Chappels Parochial and Chappels of Eaſe make any Difference in the Caſe?</q>
                                                </p>
                                                <p>The Perſon conſulted was Dr. <hi>Exton,</hi> Chancellor to the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> whoſe Opinion, under his own Hand, I here ſend you incloſed, hoping it will give you Satisfaction; or if not, that you will pleaſe to let me know, that ſo we may conſider what is further to be done.</p>
