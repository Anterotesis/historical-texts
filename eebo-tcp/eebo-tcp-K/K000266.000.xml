            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>To foreſee an Accident and not endeavour to be prepar'd againſt it, is a Piece of Policy peculiar to an Author that ſets up <hi>To Reform the Errors</hi> of <hi>Petty Statſmen</hi> three times a week to no Purpoſe; and it adds very much to a Malefactor's Conviction to be guilty of a Willful Crime.

               <p>But the Author humbly hopes all ſuch <hi>Inuendo-Men</hi> will conſider, that as they can have no Reaſon to Think ſo, but <hi>Similitude</hi> of Characters, ſo no Conjectures of theirs, ought to pre-judge his meaning, in which he demands to be left to himſelf, and expects to be underſtood in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Poem as he <hi>Speaks,</hi> not as every prejudic'd Man may imagine he <hi>meant.</hi>
               </p>

            <q>
               <p>If any are ſo Weak to tell us, That <hi>Smithfield</hi> and <hi>Cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide,</hi> cannot be meant of <hi>Poland,</hi> the Author preſumes to ask ſuch People, if ever they have been at <hi>Warſaw;</hi> and, if they have, and don't know that there is both a <hi>Smithfield</hi> and a <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> as well as a <hi>May-Fair;</hi> and a <hi>Bear-Garden,</hi> he is ſorry for their Heads, and deſires them to ſtep thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther again to Reform their Memories.</p>

               <hi>Poland</hi> may have Places put to the ſame uſes as <hi>Smith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi> and <hi>Cheapſide,</hi> and Fairs and Bear-gardens may be in Requeſt there; but it is none of his buſineſs, to bring <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Tranſactions upon the <hi>Poliſh</hi> Theatre. And any Man of Compaſſion has very great Reaſon to be ſorry for <hi>his Head,</hi> who thinks to conceal what was Printed near <hi>Bartholomew-Cloſe,</hi> under the ſorry Artifice of an Impreſſion from <hi>Dant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zick.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <p>But ſuppoſe there are not places call'd directly by thoſe Names, if there are places apply'd to the ſame Uſes, what has any Body to queſtion the Allegories?

            </q>
            <p>Though the Character of the Perſons his Satyr points at are Falſe and Malicious, yet they bear ſo near a Reſemblance to what is ſaid of them by their Enemies of the <hi>Diſſenting Party,</hi> that the Scandal is fix'd beyond an Excuſe, and ought to be Ammadverted upon with the utmoſt ſeverity, unleſs the Gentlemen in Power cloſe with the Libeller, and fling off all Deference and Reſpect for the Memories of their Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</p>
            <q>
               <p>'Tis very hard that a Man cannot Write of the Follies of other Nations, but People will be always comparing them with their own.
