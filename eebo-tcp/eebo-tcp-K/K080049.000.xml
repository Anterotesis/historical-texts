            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE various unforeſeen circumſtances, which have hitherto delayed the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this work, the Author hopes, will apologize to his Subſcribers when laid before them; and the acquiſition of many valuable materials, which greatly enrich the Compilation, he flatters himſelf, will compenſate the treſpaſs committed on their patience.</p>
            <p>A ſhort account of the method purſued in this work ſeems neceſſary to demonſtrate the value of thoſe Manuſcripts, which have lately been obtained.</p>
            <p>ATTENTION to the moſt diſtant antiquity, may appear to the learned Reader not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently engaging to detain him from thoſe Events, which are ſtrictly Provincial; yet the neglect of a general view of this County, in the earlieſt ages, would diſappoint others: Therefore, in the Introduction, I ſhall in a curſory manner pay attention to thoſe times which preceed the acceſſion of the ROMANS, and notice the conqueſt made by them of the Province of BRIGANTIA, their departure, the calling in of the Saxons and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of their Monarchy in Northumberland, with the ſucceſſion of Sovereigns in BERNICIA and DEIRA, until the union of thoſe States under OSWALD. In this peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, the ſtate of the Chriſtian Church in the Northern parts of Britain, ſhall be noted, and the manners and cuſtoms of the people deſcribed.</p>
            <p>THE work opens with the converſion of the Northumbrian Saxons, and the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the See of LINDISFARNE.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0085802200:14"/>IT would be uſeleſs to mention the various ancient authors, whoſe labours furniſh ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for this part of the work, or to recapitulate the many publications well known to the learned reader, which will be critically referred to, on every occaſion through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole. Soon after the Prelates were ſettled at LINDISFARNE, they appear to have taken a part in the affairs of Government, and indeed, the ſituation of Religious Societies was ſuch in the infancy of Church Eſtabliſhment, that on every convulſion of State and revolution of Empire, they were in imminent peril; ſo that it becomes indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſibly neceſſary in carrying on a hiſtory of the progreſs of the See, to weave and mingle therewith the material events of State, more eſpecially where the Provincial injunctions and ordinances were a mixture of maxims Civil and Clerical. If it appears neceſſary to introduce the affairs of Government in the early ſtages of our Biſhoprick, how much more important doth it ſeem, when our Prelates held high Offices under the Crown, led forth the troops of their Province, were Embaſſadors making League and Truce, and when this Palatinate became a barrier between two hoſtile Nations, and often the ſcene of battle. Theſe are briefly noticed here, to account for interweaving ſo much of the general hiſtory with the annals of our Prelates. The rehearſal of local Events muſt be abrupt, and material facts unconnected and unpleaſant in the relation, if not carried on in a ſhort ſucceſſional line of circumſtances for their introduction, thereby rendering ſuch Events more intereſting to the Reader, and by enlarging the limits of Provincial hiſtory, giving a more pleaſing channel to the narrative. By this method, the reader will alſo be enabled to collect the traits of character which every Prelate diſplayed in his public or private Capacity, and to read the Man diveſted of the robes of Pontificacy.</p>
            <p>IT was not till after the Epiſcopal ſeat was at DURHAM, that we hear any thing of the Civil Juriſdiction being veſted in the Prelates. WALCHER, whoſe acceſſion was in the year 1072, was the firſt that wore that Imperial Mitre, which in after ages became ſo diſtinguiſhed, and with the Clerical character mixed the rights and privileges of a Sover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign, thereby erecting an Engliſh Popedom. The ambitious BEKE in maintenance of his regal authority within this Province, touching forfeited Eſtates, for which he contended with the Crown, alledged in Parliament, <hi>that the Biſhops of Durham had from antient time all regal rights and Juriſdiction within their Royal Liberty of Durham from the time of the Conqueſt and antecedent thereto.</hi> 
               <q>This privilege is founded upon Preſcription immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial, becauſe there is no record of its being granted by any Princes before the Conqueſt or ſince, wherein it is not ſuppoſed to have been granted alſo by their predeceſſors; it proceeded at firſt from a principle of Devotion to St. CUTHBERT, that whatever Lands were given to him, or bought with his money, he ſhould hold them with the ſame freedom that the Princes who gave them held the reſt of their Eſtates; but this pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety to the Saint was not without its prudential purpoſes all along, both for the ſervice
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0085802200:15"/>of the Crown in the Wars with Scotland, and alſo for the ſervice of the Country, becauſe of its diſtance from the Courts of Law above.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN the Annals of Biſhop WALCHER and his Succeſſors, all the evidence obtained by laborious reſearch will be laid down, to define, of what the PALATINE power conſiſted in the exerciſe of its authority, and into one point of view will be collected whatever our moſt learned Writers have ſaid concerning it. For as the regal juriſdiction in this Province is alledged to be preſcriptive, it is from Writers of Antiquity only we can trace the original ſenſe entertained of the authority of a PALATINE, and from ſucceſſional acts coming into ages of learning and reſearch, that we can learn the real power of that ſpecies of Juriſdiction. It was an ancient maxim, <hi>Quidquid rex habet extra Commitatem Dunelmenſem, Epiſcopus habet infra, niſi aliqua ſit conceſſio aut praeſcriptio in contrarium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Biſhops had great extent of power, as the ſeveral Records quoted in the courſe of the work, under each Epiſcopacy will evince. They levied taxes for the defence and ſervice of the Palatinate, and made truces with Enemies; raiſed defenſible troops within the liberty from ſixteen to ſixty years of age, and impreſſed Ships for war; they ſate in judgment of life and death, and held execution by life and limb: They had power to create Barons, who formed their Council or Parliament, and with their Vaſſals were bound to attend the Biſhop's ſummons in time of public exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: The greateſt part of the Lands within the liberty were held of the Biſhops as Lords Paramount, in Capite: They coined money, granted licences to embattle Caſtles, build Churches, found Hoſpitals and Chantries; inſtituted Corporations by Charter, to which the Crown's aſſent was not eſſential to maintain their legality, and granted Fairs and Markets: They had all manner of Royal Juriſdiction both Civil and Military, by Land and by Water; for the exerciſe whereof they held proper Courts, and appointed Officers and other Miniſters of every department, as well ſuch as the Crown nominates without the liberty, as thoſe the King had been uſed to depute, according to the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of ſpecial caſes, and for the Execution of Acts of Parliament. The Biſhops Officers by Patent are, the Temporal Chancellor, Conſtable of Durham Caſtle, to whom belonged the care of the Levies, the cuſtody of the Armour and pay of the troops; the high Chamberlain, the under Chamberlain, Secretary of State, Steward, Treaſurer, Comptroller of the Houſehold, Maſter of the Horſe, Stewards of the Manors and Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Courts, Sheriff, Prothonotary, Clerks of the Chancery, Crown and Peace, Keeper of the Rolls, Curſitor, Regiſters and Examiners in Chancery, Clerk of the County Court, Stewards of Borough Courts, Eſchaetors, Feodaries, Auditors and under Auditors, Clerks of the receipt of the Exchequer, Superviſors of Lordſhips, Caſtles, Mines of Coal, Lead and Iron, Coroners, Conſervators of Ports and Rivers, Officers of Marſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, Clerks of Markets, Keepers of the great Seal, of Ulnage, of the Wardrobe and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0085802200:16"/>Harneſs, and Maſter Armourer. They had ſeveral Foreſts, Chaces, Parks and Woods, where they had their Foreſters, who held Courts in their name, and determined mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters relative to Foreſts, Parks, Rangers and Palekeepers. They were Lord high Admirals of the Sea and Waters, that lie within or adjoining the County Palatine, had Vice Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Courts of Admiralty, Judges to determine according to the Maritime Laws, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters, Examiners, Officers of Beaconage, Anchorage, &amp;c. and awarded Commiſſions, to regulate Waters and paſſages thereon. <q>Thus by themſelves and Officers, they did Juſtice to all perſons, in all caſes, without either the King or any of his Officers inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering ordinarily in any thing. Whatever occaſion the King had within this liberty, his Writs did not run here, they were not directed as to his own Officers in other Counties, but to the Biſhop himſelf, or in the Vacancy of the See, to the proper Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the Palatinate. When King Henry the II. ſent his Juſtices of Aſſize hither upon an extraordinary occaſion of Murders and Robberies, he declared by his Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that he did it with the licence of the Biſhop, <hi>et pro hac vice tantum;</hi> and that it ſhould not be drawn into cuſtom either in his time, or in the time of his heirs, not being done but upon abſolute neceſſity; and that he would, nevertheleſs, have the Lands of Saint Cuthbert to enjoy its Liberties and antient Cuſtoms as amply as ever.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT was not 'till after WILLIAM DE CARILEPHO's acceſſion to the See in 1080, that the regal rights of our Prelates received confirmation in writing from the Crown: After the coming in of the NORMANS, Deeds and Writings under Seal gained general acceptation, and every material tranſaction was conducted under written muniments: Proceeding that aera, moſt of the public Records were only entries <hi>in teſtimonium,</hi> atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the parties preſent, as Regiſters of the fact, who thereto ſubſcribed their names under the ſign of the Croſs, and from that important period in our Provincial Hiſtory, the long ſeries of Records, to which I ſhall have occaſion to refer, will appear.</p>
            <p>THE Work will conſiſt of <hi>two</hi> Volumes. The <hi>firſt</hi> comprehends the Annals of the Biſhops with their ſeveral acts of Juriſdiction, embelliſhed with many Portraits, Seals, Coins, Arms, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>ſecond</hi> comprehends local deſcriptions, with the peculiar hiſtory of each part of the County, thrown into Parochial diviſions. The CITY of DURHAM is treated of at large, and in progreſſive order the Charters of Incorporation are inſerted, particularly the new one granted by the preſent Biſhop. In this arrangement of City records, is a <hi>fac ſimile</hi> of Biſhop PUDSEY's Charter, with the Pope's confirmatory Bull, a Plate pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by Mr. G. ALLAN, and engraved by that incomparable artiſt <hi>Stephens;</hi> by whoſe death the Author hath loſt a great aſſiſtant, and the public one of the moſt accurate workmen of the age. Under this head, liſts of the chief Magiſtrates of the City, and Repreſentatives in Parliament will be inſerted. Great attention is paid to the hiſtory
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0085802200:17"/>of the Cathedral, which is embelliſhed with two correct draughts and admeaſurements of the North and Eaſt fronts, by an eminent Architect employed in the preſent coſtly repairs now carrying on; and each part thereof and other Monaſtic buildings deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, with a comparative view of their antient magnificence and preſent ſtate. Short anecdotes of the Priors, Deans, Prebendaries, and other Miniſters, with hiſtorical notes and Monumental Inſcriptions will be inſerted. The Endowment by K. Hen. VIII. will be given at length, with the Statutes and other Muniments; to which are added a number of Records hitherto with-held from the public: In like manner the Author paſſes through every other public building and place of conſequence, and throws in Engravings of all the remains of Antiquity, Caſtles, and principal Seats, ſome of which have been contributed as an encouragement to the work, by the late JOHN CUTHBERT <abbr>Eſq</abbr> JOHN TEMPEST and TIMOTHY HUTCHINSON Eſquires, MR. ALLAN and others.</p>
            <p>As the Author proceeds in Parochial Diviſions, he takes for his guide the Book of Rates, made for collecting the Royal Aid under the Satutes of 16 and 17 of Charles II. Each Pariſh Church is deſcribed, and engravings given of the moſt remarkable; due attention is paid to things memorable recorded in the Regiſters, and Monumental In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions; and the ſuppoſed value of each Living ſhewn, and the Incumbents in ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion thrown into the notes. Under this diviſion, every thing remarkable in Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity or rare in nature is treated of, and ſome of the moſt ſingular monuments repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented. The foundations and privileges of each religious Houſe, Hoſpital, Gild and Chantry are ſet forth, with engravings of all the Seals extant.</p>
            <p>ALL Gentlemens Seats are deſcribed and antient poſſeſſors noted, with Genealogical Tables, not only of the principal Families exiſting, but ſuch as are extinct, and were once of conſequence in the County, together with tranſcripts of Viſitations in the Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of JOHN TEMPEST and MARMADUKE TUNSTALL Eſquires, whoſe liberality demands every grateful acknowledgment. Theſe are compleated by the additions of Mr. ALLAN, whoſe indefatigable labour has accumulated moſt of the materials, from which this work is compiled, and from whoſe unexampled bounty and generoſity they are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the author's arrangement for the public Eye.</p>
            <p>A ſhort account of the STAPLES of this County will be preſented, its Trade and Manufacturies, with the Imports and Exports: Comparative tables from the Church Regiſters for 20 years of the laſt and preſent Century are inſerted, to ſhew the ſtate of Population, communicated by the reſpective Clergy, whoſe attention hereto has been ſingularly kind.</p>
            <p>A curſory view of the NATURAL HISTORY of each diſtrict is introduced, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineations of ſuch productions as are curious, and a ſhort account of the STRATA found in the Mines, with drawings and admeaſurements from the works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0085802200:18"/>PROGRESSIVE obſervations will be made as the Itinerary advances, on AGRICULTURE, produce of the Lands, growth of Timber, and breeds of Cattle, with other matters equally intereſting to the Inhabitants.</p>
            <p>HAVING given a curſory view of the manner in which this Work will be executed, the MATERIALS from whence it is chiefly compiled, ſhall next be noticed; and this the Author is more particularly induced to do, as, ſince his propoſals were offered, a publication has appeared from the Clarendon Preſs, intitled <hi>Collectanea Curioſa</hi> taken from the Manuſcripts of Archbiſhop SANCROFT in the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Library, wherein is a compendious arrangement of Materials neceſſary for conſtructing a work like this.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Record noted, is, the Doomſday Book of this County, called BOLDON BUKE, from the Survey which it contains, having reference in many Lordſhips to the Manor of <hi>Boldon,</hi> touching the ſervices of the Tenants, <hi>"ſicut in Boldon".</hi> The Editor gives ſeveral Extracts, which he ſays were collated with the tranſcript, lodged in the Bodleian Library
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Gough's Anecdotes of Britiſh Topography V. 1. p. 336.</note>. The Original Survey is depoſited in the Auditors Office at Durham, and bound up with a ſucceeding Survey made by order of Biſhop Hatfield. It is wrote on Vellum, and thus indorſed. "<hi>Superviſus temp. Hugonis Epi.</hi> 1183, <hi>et Superviſus temp. Thome Hatfeld Epi'.</hi> The firſt is wrote in a compact hand and contained in 24 pages; the latter in a looſer hand of 187 pages, and more comprehenſive.</p>
            <p>IT was not till after Propoſals were offered to the public, that theſe Records were obtained, and they are introduced through the work, as they appertain to the place de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, thereby rendering them leſs tedious to the Eye, and much readier in applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than in an Appendix: This required much labour and attention to execute, and neceſſarily has delayed the Publication.</p>
            <p>THAT laborious Collector of Records the Rev. Mr. THOMAS RANDALL, late Maſter of the Grammer School in Durham, employed the leiſure of his whole life in ſearching the ſeveral Repoſitories there, and I have before me fifteen large Volumes in Manuſcript, conſiſting of upwards of 300 pages each, copied therefrom with that accuracy, for which he was ſingular.</p>
            <p>IN the Chapter Treaſury and Library, it is ſaid, there are above ninety Royal Charters and Grants, above fifty Deeds by Nobles and Barons, about 266 by Gentlemen, 131 by Popes, Biſhops, Abbots, Priors, Convents and other Religious Perſons and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and above 130 other Original Deeds and Copies, which will amount in all to about 670. In Mr. Randall's Collection are Copies of all the Grants, Conventions and other Inſtruments that are curious, and entered in the Chartularies of the Chapter, not only from his own inſpection, but gathered from the labours of Dr. Hunter and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0085802200:19"/>Mr. Gabriel Swainſton, whoſe amuſements led that way. Theſe Volumes alſo contain extracts from the Copyhold Books of the Biſhop, copies of a ſeries of the cloſe Rolls of the Chancery, minutes of the Viſitation Books and Regiſters of all the Prelates &amp;c. Alſo two large folios of the Inquiſitions poſt mortem taken before the Biſhop's Sheriffs and Eſchaetors, within the liberties of Durham and Sadberge, and another of the Wills of ſuch Perſons as have founded public Charities; and other matters equally important to a Work of this kind. All this Fund was bequeathed by Mr. Randall's Will to Mr. Allan, and is part of his Collection opened for my uſe: The materials were unarranged and without Index, ſo that tho' the Treaſure was great, the labour of digeſting was infinite.</p>
            <p>MR. SPEARMAN made Collections in an unfortunate diſpute with the then Prelate (CREWE) and publiſhed a ſmall tract in quarto, intitled, "<hi>An Enquiry into the antient and preſent ſtate of the County Palatine of Durham &amp;c.</hi> 1729", and therein referred to all ſuch records as he had received information from: Thoſe noticed, were inſpected, and notes taken thereof at Biſhop CREWE's inſtance, an original Manuſcript whereof, is dated 21 February 1697, mutilated by Spearman's publication, but apparently the Manuſcript to which he was indebted: His other Papers fell into hands diſintereſted in matters of that kind, and as ſaid, are loſt. The late THOMAS GYLL <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Durham, has remarked in writing, <q>that moſt, or all of this Gentleman's Papers came to the hands of <hi>Gilbert Spearman</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who by Will dated 14 October 1736, bequeathed them to his Son <hi>George Spearman,</hi> and deſired, that ſuch parts, relating to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Palatine of Durham, as were thought proper, might be publiſhed, and earneſtly recommended to his Son, not to make them his ſtudy but his diverſion; which I am verily perſuaded <hi>George</hi> out of filial duty did moſt religiouſly obſerve,</q> and the fact proved ſo, for he ſuffered them to be waſted and thrown away. Tho' the late Mr. <hi>Cuthbert</hi> of Witton informed Mr. <hi>Allan,</hi> that he knew where many of theſe MSS. were, and promiſed to procure them for his uſe, when he got up to London, but unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately he died on the Road thither.</p>
            <p>MR. MICKLETON's Papers were more fortunate; he had made conſiderable Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Mr. Randall laments their imagined loſs (as he never ſaw them) in theſe words; <q>Mr. Mickleton, a Counſellor at Law in Durham had collected ſome Evidences touching the Palatinate, and his Executors ſold his Papers to Mr. <hi>Gilbert,</hi> ſo that they are loſt to the public, ſave what appears in Mr. <hi>Spearman's</hi> Book.</q>
            </p>
            <p>JOHN RUDD <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Durham, an eminent Counſellor at Law, had an inſpection there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and happily thought them of ſufficient importance to make full extracts of every material matter therein, and gives the following account thereof.</p>

            <p>WILLIAM RUDD <abbr>Eſq</abbr> has lately been pleaſed to open the treaſures of his Library: The eminence that family held at the Bar, gives the greateſt importance to their col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections. From this channel, the Author has received two Volumes of a compleat ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of Extracts from the Curſitors Rolls, and in three folios, innumerable copies of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Grants and other public Inſtruments, together with Mickleton's Collections, which, it is not doubted, will amply apologize for the delays that have hitherto befallen this intended Publication.</p>
            <p>
               <q>BREVITTS, tho' of no authority in point of evidence, yet for information are often uſeful, diſcovering what ſuites have formerly depended, directing to the Records, and often explaining their meaning, and giving us the ſeveral pleadings and proceedings therein, with the beſt diſcovery of the merit and myſtery of the cauſe. The Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys or Sollicitors who keep theſe Brevitts after the Cauſes are determined, are the perſons capable of ſupplying us; particularly thoſe of the greateſt bufineſs, they hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt of them

            <p>THE late THOMAS GYLL <abbr>Eſq</abbr> was a ſkillful Antiquarian, had a fine taſte in the Belles Lettres, and held correſpondence with Perſons of the firſt eminence in that walk: He made many Collections and Obſervations touching this County, which he commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to Mr. Allan and are now before me.</p>
            <p>MR. MANN who was Deputy Clerk of the Peace and County Treaſurer many years, made conſiderable collections, from whoſe labours, given to Mr. Allan in his life time,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0085802200:21"/>the Author derived the accounts diſperſed through the work, of public Aſſeſſments and Money Charges, together with many materials relative to the Church, City, and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty at large.</p>
            <p>MR. RALPH HODGSON, an eminent Attorney, and Steward to ſeveral Prelates, had collected many curious matters touching the Biſhop's Revenues and Church Lands, whoſe Manuſcripts and Papers were alſo communicated to Mr. Allan.</p>
            <p>Two Manuſcript Volumes of the late COUNCELLOR GREY of Newcaſtle, have been kindly lent by MR. ABBS of Weremouth, from whence great aſſiſtance is gained in hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical notes and references, touching the ſeveral Prelates and inferior Clergy hitherto unknown.</p>
            <p>CONSIDERABLE aſſiſtance has likewiſe been received from Mr. ROBERT HARRISON of Durham, and Mr. JOSEPH RITSON of Grays Inn London, whoſe reſearches, in the Harleian and Cottonian Libraries, have furniſhed ſeveral valuable tranſcripts, eſpecially an hiſtorical Poem on the Battle of Durham fought October 1346, known by the title of the <hi>Battle at Nevill's Croſs</hi> which will be inſerted at full length.</p>
            <p>IN a valuable Manuſcript communicated by Sir JOHN LAWSON, many particulars are recorded of the Riches, Rites, and Ceremonies of the Church at Durham: And in a long Paper Roll about five inches broad, written in a clear antient hand, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated by JOHN HOGG <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Norton, is diſcovered the original perhaps, or at leaſt the whole contents of DAVIES'S RITES, and from which the 105th. page of the COLLECTANEA CURIOSA is compoſed.</p>
            <p>W. H. MILBOURNE <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Armathwate Caſtle in Cumberland, JOHN LAWSON MAIRE <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of Lartington in Yorkſhire, and many other Gentlemen, have alſo favoured me with ſome Manuſcripts from their repective Libraries.</p>
            <p>THE evidences of ſeveral private families have been inſpected, and every thing intereſting to the public carefully extracted.</p>
