            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IF we read with attention the hiſtories of grand remedies, we ſee, their effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy was ever warmly diſputed, at all times, and in all places.</p>
            <p>There were phyſicians, who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately condemned them, and proſcribed them as hurtful.</p>
            <p>But others, upon different experiments, praiſed and commended them, as moſt ſalutary.</p>
            <p>By theſe learned diſputes the thing was at laſt rightly determined, and applied to common uſe.</p>
            <p>I plainly foreſee, the ſame will happen to HEMLOCK.</p>
            <p>But in the mean time I am very ſorry, to ſee ſome medical people, of great rank, give a premature and harſh ſentence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>hemlock;</hi> and to condemn it, and to diſſuade others from it, as a poiſonous and uſeleſs plant.</p>
            <p>This ſavours of too great a deſire of contradiction; and is repugnant to all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in medicine.</p>
            <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0307600200:3"/>
            <p>But the moſt cruel thing that has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to me, is, to find thoſe to be my enemies, whom I always treated with the greateſt reſpect; to whom I have done all manner of good offices; and whoſe duty it rather was, to take my part, than to hurt me.</p>
            <p>But I am neither concerned at that, nor thirſt after revenge. And that theſe my adverſaries may acknowledge, I am no ways diſaffected to them on that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, although I may differ in opinion; I write theſe obſervations for their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; offer and dedicate them, with all due reſpect, to them.</p>
            <p>Bur I do not by any means deſire, that they ſhould ſhew me any favour. Let them only love the truth; act like juſt judges; and ingenuouſly own, whatever is for the good of the ſick.</p>
            <p>As for the idle clamours of ſome, I am indifferent about them, and deſpiſe them.</p>
            <p>Whoever dreads the rattling of leaves, let him avoid a wood.</p>

            <head>A NECESSARY SUPPLEMENT UPON HEMLOCK.</head>
            <p>I Have already ſhewn, and confirmed, in two former volumes, the virtue and efficacy there is in <hi>hemlock.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For that reaſon there was no occaſion, that I ſhould write any thing more on that ſubject.</p>
            <p>But as there are ſtill many, who do not rightly conceive my notions about <hi>hemlock;</hi> and doubt its <hi>ſpecies,</hi> and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter; it was neceſſary to give a figure of the plant.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0307600200:5"/>
            <p>And that this might be rightly done, and made clear and plain to every one, without any danger of error, I entreated Dr. <hi>Crantz,</hi> the famous and indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable Profeſſor of the Inſtitutions of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, and of the <hi>materia medica,</hi> to bring this plant into his botanical garden, and to take care to have it well deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.</p>
            <p>This he did willingly, and gave me this table, drawn and engraved by the learned Mr. <hi>Cipps,</hi> a candidate in phyſic.</p>
            <p>From this any one, the leaſt verſed in botany, may know the plant at firſt ſight, and diſtinguiſh it from all others.</p>
            <p>But as for the extract of it, it is not every where prepared to my mind. For they take a large quantity of the expreſſed juice, which they boil in a copper veſſel, on a fierce fire; whence ariſes a ſtrong fetid ſteam, which is the beſt part of the medicine, that flies off: and beſides, they do not take proper care to purify the juice and extract.</p>
            <p>By theſe means is prepared a black maſs, that is tough, and with little of the genuine fetid flavour.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0307600200:6"/>
            <p>But when it is prepared in my way, it ought to be a thick extract, of a dark greeniſh colour, with a moſt ungrateful fetid flavour, much like the ſmell of mice.</p>
            <p>Some have mixed other herbs with <hi>hemlock,</hi> and ſome leave the herb freſh gathered in a heap for ſeveral days, by which it grows flaccid; part of it cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupts; and the juice grows roapy and ſlimy.</p>
            <p>Others do not boil the juice as ſoon as it is expreſſed, but wait for a day or two, till they have leiſure; by which the juice changes, and loſes its virtue.</p>
            <p>On this occaſion I thought it would not be improper, to give an account of ſome cures, that I have made with <hi>hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock</hi> alone, ſince my ſecond treatiſe on that ſubject was publiſhed.</p>
            <p>In doing this I ſhall be ſhort, that I may not interrupt the leiſure, or conſume the time, that is ſo precious to phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, by tedious narrations.</p>
            <p>When I ſay I gave <hi>hemlock,</hi> I mean its extract; which I take notice of, that there may be no diſpute about words.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0307600200:7"/>
            <p>Nor have I always added the doſe of the medicine; becauſe I have almoſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways begun with a ſmall quantity, and gradually encreaſed it, till a good effect enſued: then I ſtopped, and never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the doſe afterwards.</p>

               <head>CASE I.</head>
               <p>A Man of about thirty years of age, complained, for ſeveral months, of a violent pain, and continual heat, in his belly: he had no appetite; the urine flowed as in a ſtrangury; his ſtools were frequent, ſmall, hot, joined with a <hi>teneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> the complexion pale, and the whole body emaciated.</p>
               <p>Remedies of every kind were tried, but did no ſervice : ſleep was rather diſturbed, and his ſtrength began to fail.</p>
               <p>HEMLOCK alone gave him relief in the ſpace of three months: his appetite returned; the ſtools became natural; his urine was made freely; he gained ſtrength, and a perfect ſtate of health.</p>

               <p>A plaſter was applied, by which both the hardneſs and ſize of the breaſt were encreaſed, and the ſwelling ſpread under the arm-pit.</p>
               <p>The tumor became of a purple co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, with here and there livid ſtreaks, and the pain ſo exceſſive, that ſhe could neither ſleep day nor night.</p>
               <p>At length ſeveral knots or tubercles roſe on the tumor, which threatened a very bad exulceration.</p>
               <p>I being called in, deſired that ſhe would lay aſide all kind of plaſters, and cover the breaſt only with a ſoft linen cloth.</p>
               <p>Internally I gave only the extract of <hi>hemlock.</hi>

                  <p>HEMLOCK cures the diſeaſes, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue after a malignant ſmall-pox.</p>
                  <p>To confirm this, Dr. <hi>Lebmacker,</hi> an eminent phyſician of this city, wrote me the two following hiſtories.</p>
                  <p>The firſt is the hiſtory of his own ſon, which was thus:</p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">
                     <p>'My ſon, an infant five months old, otherwiſe in perfect health, was ſeized with the ſmall-pox on the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0307600200:31"/>26th of February, 1760; which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though diſtinct, was not of ſo good a kind.</p>
                     <p>On the ninth day of the diſeaſe a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den diarrhoea came on, whence all the puſtules on the left-ſide from head to foot ſunk in, while thoſe on the right-ſide remained full.</p>
                     <p>On this the left-arm, knee, and foot ſwelled to an enormous ſize, with great pain and inability; which the poor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant made us ſenſible of by its ſhrieks, if it was touched.</p>
                     <p>No aperture could be made in theſe tumors, either by nature or art; but they were cured in four months time by the ſkill of an expert chirurgeon, Mr. <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> without any impediment in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parts.</p>
                     <p>But as the croſs child could not be prevailed upon to take any medicine, either in the time of the ſmall-pox, or thereafter; and his mother's milk, with a milk diet, were not ſufficient to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuage the virulence of the variolous matter, his whole body was in time covered with innumerable ugly ichorous
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0307600200:32"/>ulcers, from the crown of the head to the ſoles of the feet; ſo that he had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a ſwelled belly, and ulcerated ſkin, to cover the bones.</p>
                     <p>The child being thus left in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable condition, till it was one and twenty months old, that is, till June 1761, all hopes of its recovery were over, as it grew worſe and worſe every day. I was willing, however, to try, what the extract of <hi>hemlock,</hi> given as we could, might do in ſuch a caſe.</p>
                     <p>From the beginning of June, then, I gave him daily two grains, one in the morning, in a weak decoction of coffee and toaſted barley, with milk; and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the evening, in chocolate, that he might not diſcern it.</p>
                     <p>I ſo increaſed the doſe by degrees, that he took daily ſix grains, without any regard to his diet.</p>
                     <p>By theſe means the ulcers began to afford a good <hi>pus,</hi> to be cleanſed, to heal up, and to diſappear over the whole body; only a ſcab or two remaining among the hair of his head.</p>
                     <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0307600200:33"/>
                     <p>By the middle of July he had got ſo much ſtrength, that he could run up and down very briſkly, both within doors and without, with his head up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and his eyes clear and open; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fearing the rays of the ſun, nor a candle, which he could not bear for two months before, on account of his inflamed eyes, which made him hang his head, and put his hands to his eyes, whenever any light came before them.</p>
                     <p>Thus by degrees the child, that was before intolerably croſs, now runs about all day with chearfulneſs at his play.'</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>He took ſix drachms of the extract of <hi>hemlock,</hi> but no other medicine.</p>
                  <p>Now, my good readers! if we had only this ſingle caſe to vouch it, would not <hi>hemlock</hi> deſerve the greateſt praiſe?</p>
                  <p>HEMLOCK was given to an infant quite extenuated, covered with ulcers, and in the worſt cachectic habit of body, of which he was cured.</p>
                  <p>HEMLOCK then is an innocent reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and it is an efficacious one.</p>
                  <p>There are, indeed, ſome terrible cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culators in medicine, who will, perhaps,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0307600200:34"/>attribute this cure, to the decoction of toaſted barley, infuſion of coffee, choco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, or to the force of nature.</p>
                  <p>But they muſt know, that this child took thoſe drinks before he uſed the <hi>hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> but grew worſe upon it: ſo that we can neither attribute his recovery to the force of nature, nor to this drink. But as ſoon as the extract of <hi>hemlock</hi> was given, the infant began to grow better.</p>
                  <p>Whence, O <hi>hemlock!</hi> the praiſe is due to thee.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond hiſtory is the following one, communicated to me by the ſame learned gentleman.</p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">
                     <p>'About the end of June, 1761, I met by chance a certain noble lady of three and twenty, who had been afflicted with the confluent ſmall-pox eighteen years before, the ſad remains of which ſhe ſtill bewails; for beſides the loſs of her right eye, ſhe had an ulcer, with a hard ſwelling, on her right cheek</p>
                     <p>Various remedies, as ſhe ſaid, both internal and external, had been tried to heal this ſore; but they were all, even to a ſalivation itſelf, given in vain.</p>
                     <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0307600200:35"/>
                     <p>Remembring the ſucceſs of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of <hi>hemlock</hi> in a like diſeaſe, I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed the ſame to her.</p>
                     <p>Altho' ſhe was now tired of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, yet ſhe conſented to it.</p>
                     <p>She began then, on the firſt of July, to take every day eight grains of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of <hi>hemlock.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Taking off the plaſter, of what kind I know not, I took care to have the ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer fomented with a linen-cloth, dipt in a decoction of <hi>hemlock.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In eight days the tumors appeared to be both leſs, and ſofter; and there ſeemed to be ſome ſlight tokens of a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrix forming on the lips of the ulcer.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, proud fleſh ſprung up here and there in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the ulcer; which was taken off by ſprinkling the powder of <hi>hemlock</hi> upon it.</p>
                     <p>The cruſt occaſioned by this, I took off with honey of roſes, mixed with the ſame powder: which were repeated, as often as the proud fleſh ſprang up again.</p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0307600200:36"/>
                     <p>In the mean time I increaſed the pills, ſo that for three weeks paſt ſhe has taken every day thirty two grains.</p>
                     <p>This doſe I have hitherto continued, intermitting now and then a day or two.</p>
                     <p>About this time, the tumors, and hardneſs, almoſt entirely went off; the ulcer began to be cleanſed, to be dried up, and to be covered with a thin ſkin; and thus it has remained cloſed now for ſix weeks.</p>
                     <p>She will go on with the ſame doſe of <hi>hemlock,</hi> till the cicatrix is ſound.</p>
                     <p>She has now taken, from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of June to the end of September, four ounces of the extract of <hi>hemlock.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>She received no benefit from any other medicine for eighteen years.</p>
                     <p>But now, by the uſe of <hi>hemlock,</hi> ſhe finds her appetite to be increaſed; ſhe grows plump; is free from rheumatic pains, which ſhe was before troubled with; and has no other complaint.'</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Is there any man in his ſenſes who doubts of the efficacy of <hi>hemlock?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Since <hi>hemlock</hi> operates on the virulent
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0307600200:37"/>remains of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> a queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes upon it; whether it may not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable to give it, in a malignant vario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous diſtemper itſelf, in a ſpare doſe, by a prudent hand, with judicious and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident care? it is agreeable to nature, and appears from an infinite courſe of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that vegetables of whatever kind may be digeſted in our ſtomachs, and converted into the inquiline juices of the body; but minerals cannot.</p>
                  <p>VEGETABLES, <hi>then, are more eaſily borne by our nature, and are by far more ſafe and agreeable to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore if it was allowable to others to uſe <hi>mercury,</hi> and antimony, in a viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtate of the <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> why may not we be allowed, without any remorſe, to try <hi>hemlock,</hi> ſince the beſt remedies yet known do nothing; theſe two caſes of the learned <hi>Lebmacher</hi> were very neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry here, to make this propoſition appear worthy of approbation.</p>
                  <p>I have likewiſe, from other phyſicians both of this and foreign countries, ſome excellent caſes relating to <hi>hemlock,</hi> in which it proved ſucceſsful: and I have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0307600200:38"/>others, in which it did not ſucceed ſo well; but I have thought proper to reſerve all theſe for another time.</p>

               <p>THESE Corollaries are deduced from, and confirmed by, repeated experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.</p>
               <p>But I beſeech all, and every phyſicians, not to perſuade themſelves, that I am of ſuch an opinion as to believe, that theſe rules are general, and that <hi>hemlock</hi> ought always to cure.</p>
               <p>I ſay and openly own, that I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe had patients of all kinds, to whom <hi>hemlock</hi> was of no ſervice; altho' it was indicated from a ſimilitude of the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>But I do not believe, there are any, who will doubt of the truth of the caſes I have related.</p>
               <p>But if any one makes a ſcruple about the truth of the matter, and ſuſpects my probity, let him go to the <hi>illuſtrious Van Swieten;</hi> who has the names of the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, and an account of their place of abode.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0307600200:39"/>
               <p>Happy me! who have an opportunity to practice phyſic under the auſpices of ſo <hi>great a man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have ſeen patients labouring under the worſt <hi>cancer</hi> of the breaſt, whom <hi>hemlock</hi> ſoon relieved: but there were ſeveral others, to whom <hi>hemlock</hi> only afforded ſome relief, but did not cure them: others found no alteration from the uſe of <hi>hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock:</hi> one or two could not bear <hi>hemlock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I would have the ſame to be underſtood of other diſeaſes, for which I have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended <hi>hemlock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For I only contend, that <hi>hemlock</hi> is ſometimes of ſervice, and does wonders, where other the moſt famous and extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led medicines do nothing.</p>
               <p>If other phyſicians ſtill find other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, we may be able, in time, to cure the moſt difficult diſeaſes.</p>
               <p>Truly! I congratulate myſelf, when I hear, there are ſeveral phyſicians, who follow my example about divers vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.</p>
               <p>How many thouſands of plants are there, whoſe virtues we are ignorant of? But to diſcover theſe, there are required
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0307600200:40"/>induſtry, labor, provident care, and a mind free from all ſects.</p>
               <p>Neither ſhould you ſwear by the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of a maſter.</p>
               <p>Moreover, it is always to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered, that there are limites both to art and medicines.</p>
               <p>Now when <hi>hemlock</hi> is ſometimes of ſervice, but at other times does nothing in the ſame diſeaſe; it is certain there muſt be ſome latent difference, the diag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtic ſigns of which are yet unknown to us; nor am I alone ſufficient to determine thoſe things; and for that reaſon I have not hitherto been able, to give any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain rules.</p>
               <p>But they who might and ought to have aſſiſted me, deſired to be excuſed. Yea they have even, by ſharp cenſures, and repeated harangues to the ſons of art, condemned and proſcribed my works, and would have them deſtroyed by fire and ſword.</p>
               <p>Ah me! miſerable fate of man.</p>
               <p>In my two treatiſes on <hi>hemlock,</hi> I have related both the caſes that were ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and thoſe that proved unſucceſsful:
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0307600200:41"/>and moreover I always admoniſhed, that <hi>hemlock</hi> would not prove of equal ſervice to all: I ſaid farther, in my ſecond book, it was enough to me, if I ſhall preſerve and cure one patient in a hundred by the uſe of <hi>hemlock,</hi> who could not be reſtored by other medicines.</p>
               <p>If every one of the other ninety-nine phyſicians will do as much as I have done, then all the hundred patients will be cured.</p>
               <p>Could any man write with more ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity and honeſty? It is allowable to propoſe our experiments faithfully and cautiouſly to the world: but after that every phyſician is at liberty, to uſe ſuch a remedy, or to let it alone.</p>
               <p>I neither deſire honor, glory, immortal fame, nor profit: I would only deſire to be uſeful to mankind, afflicted with ſo many miſerable diſtempers; and would be willing to relieve ſuch calamities. This is the duty of every phyſician; I beg, then, that others would give me no diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance.</p>
               <p>I have given to the ſick ſome hundred pounds of the extract of <hi>hemlock,</hi> and can
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0307600200:42"/>affirm, with a ſafe conſcience, that I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hurt any one. For when I ſaw things to be in a right way, I went on boldly, continued, and increaſed the doſe: but as ſoon as I obſerved (which very rarely happens) that the ſick did not do well from it, I forbore, and laid aſide <hi>hemlock.</hi> This is the rule of art.</p>
               <p>Since then this medicine prudently given cannot hurt, our art requires, that it ſhould be farther recommended to all; in order to make numbers of trials, which may be collated together, and compared according to their ſigns, ſymptoms, and events. Then let the reaſons and cauſes be inquired into, why <hi>hemlock</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times of ſervice, and makes a radical cure; and why it ſometimes does nothing in the ſame diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>Upon ſeeing the difference, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the cauſe, it will appear, how far the efficacy of <hi>hemlock</hi> may extend. And then a reaſon may be given, why <hi>hemlock</hi> does not act equally upon all. It may then likewiſe be determined, with what caſes it evidently agrees; and in what it performs nothing.</p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0307600200:43"/>
               <p>Theſe obſervations being rightly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, we may be able to apply ſome other remedy, in caſes where <hi>hemlock</hi> is inactive.</p>
               <p>By ſuch means the bounds of our art will be extended, to the great benefit of the community.</p>
               <p>In ſome caſes, where <hi>hemlock</hi> had not the effects I expected from it, I have tried other remedies; and not without ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>If that was not ſufficient, I have ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ready.</p>
               <p>Thus I ſhall aſcend by degrees; and I hope in God, that he will proſper my endeavours, which are only intended for the welfare of my neighbours.</p>
               <p>I here faithfully promiſe my adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, I ſhall employ the more pains upon thoſe things, the more they endeavour to interrupt and hinder me.</p>
               <p>While I do what is right, I fear no body.</p>
               <p>Although <hi>hemlock</hi> is a moſt innocent remedy, yet I could wiſh, that every phyſician would always begin with a ſmall doſe, and gradually increaſe it.</p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0307600200:44"/>
               <p>For we know, how ſtrange and diverſe the peculiar temperaments of men are; whence there may be ſome, who may not bear this remedy.</p>
               <p>By a ſmall doſe then, no one will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a fault: becauſe a good phyſician will diſcontinue a medicine, where he obſerves any ſiniſter event.</p>
               <p>But it is always to be well obſerved, whether that event may be owing to the medicine; or to the ſymptoms that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company the diſeaſe; or to an error in the non-naturals.</p>
               <p>There are ſome, who are tormented, vomit, are ſeized with a fever, and faint away, only from taking crabs eyes, which are certainly a moſt innocent medicine: and why ſhould there not be others, who, from ſome latent cauſe, may be ill affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with <hi>hemlock?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But is <hi>hemlock</hi> therefore no medicine? Ought <hi>hemlock</hi> to be condemned on that account? No prudent phyſician will think ſo.</p>
               <p>If the uſe of <hi>hemlock</hi> proves prejudicial to any, it is not to be attributed to the medicine, but to the fault of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriber;
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0307600200:45"/>if we take the thing in a ſtrict, and true medical ſenſe.</p>
               <p>Symptoms of a different nature from the diſeaſe are often complicated with it: and then it is requiſite, that other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies ſhould be applied, beſides <hi>hemlock.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ſpaſms or convulſions prove trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, antihyſteric nervine remedies are wanted.</p>
               <p>If pains are violent, paregorics and opiates become neceſſary. A high fever, and full pulſe, require cooling nitrous remedies.</p>
               <p>In a putrid ſtate of the juices, or if an intermittent fever comes upon the uſe of <hi>hemlock,</hi> the bark is added to it.</p>
               <p>Sometimes purging is needful, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times bleeding.</p>
               <p>Too great a flow of ſharp humours on a part requires an iſſue, or ſeton.</p>
               <p>Neither ought a fomentation or cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaſm of <hi>hemlock</hi> always to be applied outwardly; but they are to be changed, according to the judgment and experience of a good phyſician, or chirurgeon.</p>
               <p>If ulcers are dreſt with lint, great care ſhould be uſed in taking it off; leſt the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0307600200:46"/>threads adhering to the naked veſſels ſhould be torn off with force, which might hurt every thing: a haemorrhage might enſue, from which proud fleſh, ſprings up.</p>
               <p>They ſhould all be firſt moiſtened with the weakeſt infuſion of <hi>hemlock,</hi> or other proper liquid.</p>
               <p>The more urging ſymptoms often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, that the uſe of <hi>hemlock,</hi> both ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and internal, ſhould be left off for ſome time; till theſe are either cured, or at leaſt mitigated.</p>
               <p>We ſhould endeavour to palliate diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders in thoſe perſons, who do not bear <hi>hemlock;</hi> ſo long as we are unacquainted with any other remedy.</p>
               <p>The bones, tumors, <hi>ſcirrhuſes,</hi> are often attended with great pain in their inner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt receſſes: I have often obſerved in ſuch caſes, there was an eroſion, or corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in that place: but a corrupted part ſhould be ſeparated from the ſound, which cannot be done without an external aper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, made by a cauſtic application, or chirurgical inſtrument; but by the uſe
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0307600200:47"/>of <hi>hemlock</hi> it is often made ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly.</p>
               <p>Then corrupted matter iſſues forth, and there is a ſinuous ulcer.</p>
               <p>The leſs intelligent imagine, that this corruption proceeds from the uſe of <hi>hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock:</hi> although upon the continued uſe of it in the ſame caſe, whether internal or external, perfect health often enſues.</p>
               <p>I have ſometimes ſeen certain <hi>ſcirrhuſes</hi> in the glands diſſolved by the uſe of <hi>hem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock,</hi> but new ones appeared in other parts.</p>
               <p>That ſeemed ſtrange: but the ſick al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found themſelves well in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; ſo that I continued the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, and cured the patients.</p>
               <p>Such things never frighten the ſkilful: and therefore we ought not immediately to change the medicine.</p>
               <p>In diet, farinaceous unfermented ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are to be avoided; and likewiſe too acrid ſpices.</p>
               <p>Acids are allowed for a condiment; but when they are too predominant, they are not ſo proper.</p>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0307600200:48"/>
               <p>Good wine does not hurt thoſe, who are uſed to it.</p>
               <p>Friction, or great motion, in the part affected, generally increaſe the diſeaſe.</p>
               <p>It is very conducive to a cure, for the ſick to live in a free and open air, and to preſerve a chearful and right diſpoſition of mind.</p>
               <p>Sadneſs, melancholy, diſturbances of the mind, retard and hinder the cure; occaſion new diſorders; and often turn a <hi>ſcirrhus</hi> to a <hi>cancer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time in which <hi>hemlock</hi> may cure, and reſolve tumors, cannot be determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>For ſometimes that is ſoon done, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very ſlowly.</p>
               <p>Nor is the nature of ulcers, tumors, or cancers, always the ſame.</p>
               <p>I gave a woman <hi>hemlock</hi> in a large doſe for tumors of the neck, more than two years, without any alteration in the tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors: but as her menſes flowed more plentifully, her ſtrength was greater, mind more chearful, and the whole habit of
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0307600200:49"/>body much better, ſhe deſired herſelf, that I would not deny her thoſe pills.</p>
               <p>At length, after two years and a half, the tumors were diſſolved, and everything reduced to a natural ſtate.</p>
               <p>Nor did the long uſe of it do any harm.</p>
               <p>I have another woman, who took only two grains of <hi>hemlock</hi> in the morning, for a cancer of the breaſt; and although ſhe was a woman of ſeventy, there enſued ſo good and ſudden a change, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of the tumor, that both the by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanders and myſelf were aſtoniſhed.</p>
               <p>This woman made urine moſt plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, with much glutinous ſediment. But when ſhe abſtained one day from <hi>hemlock,</hi> the urine was in a ſmall quantity, and without the ſediment.</p>
               <p>In diſeaſes about the kidnies, bladder, and urinary paſſages, <hi>hemlock</hi> ſometimes has moſt excellent effects.</p>
               <p>It ſometimes cures a retention of urine, and ſtrangury; and often eaſes pains in making urine, ſooner than <hi>opium.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="47" facs="tcp:0307600200:50"/>
               <p>Nor is the extract of <hi>hemlock</hi> to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, in diſorders ariſing from a ſtone.</p>
               <p>From what hath been ſaid, it appears, that <hi>hemlock</hi> is highly worthy of being tried.</p>
               <p>In the mean time I do not affirm, it has any ſpecific virtue; but I expect the mutual aid of good phyſicians, to eſtabliſh rules about it.</p>
