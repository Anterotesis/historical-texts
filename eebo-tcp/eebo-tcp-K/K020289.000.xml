            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following play was written above three years ago, and was ſoon after ſhewn to ſome of the principal performers of both houſes. It took its riſe from Miſs EL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LIOT'S being adviſed to revive <hi>The Country Wife</hi> for her benefit the firſt ſeaſon of her engagement at Covent-Garden theatre. That play, upon a review of it, appeared inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible on account of the obſcenity which diſcolours the whole. The author, or rather the compiler of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing ſcenes, undertook to alter WYCHERLEY's play for Miſs ELLIOT againſt the following winter; but hearing, in the mean time, that Mr. BICKERSTAFF had employed himſelf upon one of WYCHERLEY's pieces, he made it his buſineſs to ſee that gentleman, leſt this writer ſhould inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fere with a plan already pre-occupied. He found that the PLAIN DEALER had been Mr. BICKERSTAFF's object, and that there was no danger of claſhing with the ſcheme of any other author. Upon a cloſer examination, therefore, of <hi>The Country Wife,</hi> it was thought proper to deſert it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely, and to reſort to MOLIERE, the original maſter whom WYCHERLEY copied. The celebrated comedy of <hi>L'Ecole de Femmes</hi> appeared too thin of buſineſs, conſiſting moſtly in narrative. To ſupply that deficiency the deſign occurred of making MOLIERE himſelf ſupply the requiſite materials; and for this purpoſe L'ETOURDIE and L'Ecole DE MARIS were called in as auxiliaries. Upon this idea the play was ſoon finiſhed, and it conſiſts of characters, ſituations, and buſineſs, from thoſe three plays, interwoven into one fable, with as much ſkill as a little leiſure in the ſummer time would permit. With the profeſſed deſign of condenſing what appeared to be the beſt of three performances into one play, it was deemed unneceſſary to ſuppreſs any one ſcene of true nature, merely becauſe the author of <hi>High Life below Stairs,</hi> and ſome other Engliſh writers, might occaſionally be <hi>tracked in the ſnow of Moliere.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0152602000:3"/>The play, when finiſhed, was given to Miſs ELLIOT, and it ſo happened, that ſhe had no opportunity of producing it till this ſeaſon. When in September laſt, her bargain both for herſelf and the play was in agitation with Mr. BEARD, the author of theſe ſheets was aſtoniſhed to hear that <hi>The Country Girl</hi> was actually in rehearſal at Drury Lane, and that the parts had been given out in the ſummer, nay, <hi>as faſt as they were written.</hi> This, it muſt not be diſſembled, looked like a <hi>deſign of foreſtalling the market;</hi> eſpecially as it was underſtood, that Miſs ELLIOT and the SCHOOL FOR GUARDIANS, had been offered the ſpring before to the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nager of Drury Lane, <hi>upon his own terms.</hi> A remonſtrance was immediately made to Mr. GARRICK, purporting that he, who had long been a manager of a ſucceſsful theatre, was going to enter into a competition with a young actreſs for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of a play. A meeting enſued, where a gentleman of the firſt character for probity and genius, was ſo obliging as to be the arbitrator. Mr. GARRICK there proteſting, that he never heard of Miſs ELLIOT's play till within a few days; it was thereupon determined, that it was, in that caſe, an accidental claſhing, but that a deſign of <hi>foreſtalling</hi> would have been illiberal and unhandſome. This laſt point of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Mr. GARRICK ſeemed to learn upon this occaſion.</p>
            <p>Both parties were, in conſequence, left to purſue their own intereſts. And now the preſent writer will diſmiſs THE SCHOOL FOR GUARDIANS, after ſaying, that he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed it with the moſt diſintereſted principle; and that, if it prove in any degree conducive to the ſervice of a young actreſs, or the public entertainment, he has all the reward he ever propoſed to himſelf.</p>
            <p>N. B. <hi>An entire ſcene in the ſecond act, page 30. has been omitted ſince the firſt repreſentation, and would have been diſcarded from this edition, but that the greateſt part of the play was printed, before it was acted.</hi>

               <l>MAY I intrude upon your patience for a minute?</l>
               <l>Ladies and gentlemen, before the opening of the play,</l>
               <l>Juſt to excuſe an accident, which, I hope has no miſchief in it,</l>
               <l>I fain, if you'll permit, a word or two would ſay.</l>
               <l>I hope you'll not be angry; but we've got no prologue for to night;</l>
               <l>And ſo I thought it was beſt to come and tell ye all the truth downright.</l>
               <l>I went to Mr. Poet, and I ſpoke to him all I could,</l>
               <l>But he ſaid he had not leiſure, tho' I know it's in his power if he would.</l>
               <l>"A prologue, ma'am," ſays he!—"Yes, Sir, a prologue if you pleaſe."</l>
               <l>And then I did ſo entreat the man, and beg, and pray, and teaze.</l>
               <l>I told him, "You know, Sir, what a miſerable plight we all are in,</l>
               <l>To frown upon the performers, when pit, box, and gallery begin;</l>
               <l>Whu—go the catcalls—dub—dub—dub—each dreadful critick's ſtick</l>

               <l>All this and more I ſaid, but he, determin'd ſtill,</l>
               <l>In formal fuſtian thus declar'd his will.</l>
               <l>"Oft have I tried"<stage>[ſeems puzzled]</stage>—ſomething about his ſtile,</l>
               <l>And how he felt the Town's indulgent ſmile.</l>
               <l>"Were I again to try my ſcanty vein,</l>
               <l>I'd beg protection for the feeble ſtrain.</l>
               <l>But then to ſue—he paus'd and rubb'd his head—</l>
               <l>To ſue—when fam'd MOLIERE the ſtage doth tread,</l>
               <l>Were to prophane the manes of the dead.</l>
               <l>MOLIERE, of old, and ſtill with rapture ſeen,</l>
               <l>Was legiſlator of the comic ſcene.</l>
               <l>To bid his SIMPLE GIRL aſſert the ſtage,</l>
               <l>And if ſhe pleaſes, ſtrive to mend the age,</l>
               <l>This was my motive;—this my only aim;</l>
               <l>Heedleſs of gain!—no candidate for fame!</l>

               <l>For juſtice, and not party, there prevails."</l>
               <l>Thus ſpoke Mr.Poet, and then with long ſteps march'd away;</l>
               <l>And now I am left alone to apologize for offering you this night's play.</l>
               <l>We'll ſtrive to make you laugh, if our aim be not perverted;</l>
               <l>Pray, how d'ye find yourſelves?—Are ye in good humour, and willing to be diverted?</l>

               <l>From thence he iſſues ſoul decrees on plays,</l>

                  <p>I have done, Sir—you have proved it to demonſtration, by the ſame ſort of logick that was uſed by one of the wits of Charles the lld's. time to his dog, when he was too lazy to beat him, "I wiſh you well married, and ſettled in the country"—</p>

                  <p>There again now; don't enrage me; I have ſome whimſical humours about me, that let me tell you, Sir—and I can be very peremptory, if I pleaſe—What? when my neighbour Strickland and I have agreed the matter!—a young lady with a fair fortune in hand, and ſeven hundred a year in expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancy, as pretty a reverſion as any in Hampſhire!— and am I now to be told, "She does not ſuit my taſte,—ſhe is not handſome?" and ſo I am to be

                  <p>But I tell you no; I won't leave thoſe matters to you—Beauty is the laſt thing I deſire to ſee in my family—Your mother, peace be to her, was as ugly a woman as you ſhall ſee in a ſummer's day; and what do you think I married her for?— for your good, Sir—for the good of my children—</p>

not a ſhilling of my money ſhall you touch, till you pay your reſpects to Miſs Strickland—now you know my reſolution—What a graceleſs look there is! ruin yourſelf if you will—follow your own courſes, Sir,—</p>

                  <p>Tom Tilbury's, Sir—only juſt to break the neck of our journey, for I ſuppoſe now, you'll drop all thoughts of this other lady—I forget her name—Ay! miſs Mary Ann Richley—She has no chance now, I reckon, Sir—</p>

                  <speaker>Brumpton.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, you ſenſeleſs numſkull!—as ſure as I am Charles Brumpton, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> ſhe ſhall be Mrs. Brumpton; and upon the death of my very good fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſhe'll be a baronet's lady, that's all—</p>

                  <speaker>Briſk.</speaker>
                  <p>And yet there is ſome truth in what Sir Theodore ſays—Beauty is but a frail periſhable ſort of a commodity; and if you are diſinherited for it, the lady's charms will not pay your poor ſervant, Briſk, his board-wages; a feature, or a ſmile can't go to market; a pawn-broker will lend nothing upon the tip of an ear: though indeed ſhe may mortgage her perſon; but that I take it will be for her own advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage; we ſhall get nothing but a comely pair of horns by it, Sir, with ſubmiſſion—</p>

                  <speaker>Brumpton.</speaker>
                  <p>Why you talk a frothy kind of nothing at a tolerable rate, Briſk—</p>

                  <p>I have ſhewn you one ſide of the medal, now behold the reverſe, Sir—When you marry an ugly woman, there is no great pleaſure in beholding her, and to be ſure when you look at her, you'll be apt to murmur to yourſelf—for all purpoſes of joy one may cut as deſirable an object out of an old tapeſtry-hanging—but then the woman has ſome valuable parchments, ſuch as leaſes, bonds, and mortgages; and I, Sir, ſhall live in tolerable plight with you, which to ſo good a maſter—</p>

                  <p>Leave prating, ſirrah, and do as I or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered you—put on your farmer's dreſs, go directly to the object I adore—let her know you are come from her guardian in the country, and have his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to take her home under your care—convey her ſafe to my arms, and I ſhall reward you—</p>

                  <p>I have, Sir, and while my happineſs is preſerved by it, keep you the gravity and good ſenſe, that make you too refined to be pleaſed, too wiſe to be merry, and too knowing to be contented.—I am in a fair way to be ſucceſsful, without any trouble at all;—you are likely to be moſt ſcurvily diſappointed after a world of pains—An humble bow, which my dancing-maſter taught me, while I laughed at him, a faſhionable coat, for which, if my taylor is ever paid he will laugh at me,—an intriguing ſnuff-box,— and an apt valet de chambre, all theſe make love for me, and—.</p>

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0152602000:15"/>
But you make a toil of a pleaſure—love, which to me is a ſcene of delight, to you is a drudgery; your temper grows as ſour, as a prude's when the ſermon is long; and as hot as a Welſhman's, if you laugh at his pedigree; or a profeſſed ſharper's, if you doubt his honour, after he has cogged the dice, and picked your pocket of your money.</p>

                  <p>And you are ſo eaſily alarmed, that little difficulties are the Alps and Pireneans in your way—Now my faith in theſe matters removes mountains—But indeed in all things we are oppoſite characters—If a tradeſman brings you in a bill and preſſes for payment, <q>'Sdeath! does the ſcoundrel doubt my honour? does he mean to affront me?</q>—Now I, when my father ſuffered me to be arreſted, went cheerfully into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and diverted myſelf for three weeks together with the bum-bailiff's character—In the buſineſs of our ſofter paſſions, the ſame humour purſues us—you write ſtudied letters to your Dulcinea, I am written to;—you ſigh, I ſing;—you fret I am gay;—you, upon a diſappointment, <q>Furies, death, and rage—there is no enduring this—life is grown a burden—damnation!</q> I burſt into a laugh, and what a whimſical world we live in—ha! ha!—But come, I will hear your melancholy ſtory,—Well, the old dragon I ſuppoſe watches the Heſperian fruit.</p>
