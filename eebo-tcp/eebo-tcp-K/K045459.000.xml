            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <l>The joys of Nature in her ruin'd ſtate</l>

            <l>Meet in one perſon, Maid and Angel join;</l>

            <l>What worth intrinſic will that man poſſeſs,</l>
            <l>Whom the dear charmer condeſcends to bleſs?</l>
            <l>Swift will the minutes roll, the flying hours,</l>
            <l>And bleſſings overtake the pair by ſhowers.</l>
            <l>Each moment will improve upon the paſt,</l>
            <l>And every day be better than the laſt.</l>
            <l>Love, means an unadulterated flame,</l>
            <l>Tho' luſt too oft uſurps the ſacred name;</l>
            <l>Such paſſion as in H—l—d's breaſt can move,</l>
            <l>'Tis that alone deſerves the name of Love.</l>
            <l>Oh was my merit great enough to find</l>
            <l>A favour'd ſtation in my H—l—d's mind;</l>
            <l>Then would my happineſs be quite compleat,</l>

               <l>NO more, dear Smith, the hackney'd Tale renew;</l>
               <l>I own their cenſure, I approve it too.</l>
               <l>For how can Ideots deſtitute of thought,</l>
               <l>Conceive, or eſtimate, but as they're taught?</l>
               <l>Say, can the ſatirizing Pen of Shears,</l>
               <l>Exalt his name, or mutilate his ears?</l>
               <l>None, but a Lawrence, can adore his Lays,</l>
               <l>Who in a quart of Claret drinks his praiſe.</l>
               <l>T—l—r repeats, what Catcott told before,</l>
               <l>But lying T—l—r is believ'd no more.</l>

If in myſelf I think my notions juſt,</l>

               <l>Religion's but Opinion's baſtard Son,</l>
               <l>A perfect myſtery, more than three in one.</l>
               <l>'Tis fancy all, diſtempers of the mind;</l>
               <l>As Education taught us, we're inclin'd.</l>
               <l>Happy the man, whoſe reaſon bids him ſee,</l>
               <l>Mankind are by the ſtate of Nature free;</l>
               <l>Who, thinking for himſelf, deſpiſes thoſe,</l>
               <l>That would upon his better ſenſe impoſe;</l>
               <l>Is to himſelf the Miniſter of God,</l>
               <l>Nor dreads the path, where Athanaſius trod.</l>
               <l>Happy (if Mortals can be) is the Man,</l>
               <l>Who, not by Prieſt, but Reaſon rules his ſpan;</l>
               <l>Reaſon, to its Poſſeſſor a ſure guide,</l>
               <l>Reaſon, a thorn in Revelations ſide.</l>
               <l>If Reaſon fails, incapable to tread</l>

            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Why, to be ſure, the metaphoric line</l>
               <l>Has ſomething ſentimental, tender, fine;</l>
               <l>But then how hobbling are the other two;</l>
               <l>There are ſome beauties, but they're very few.</l>

Beſides the Author, 'faith 'tis ſomething odd,</l>

               <l>Read but another fancy of his brain;</l>
               <l>He's Atheiſtical in every ſtrain.</l>
               <l>Fallacious is the charge: 'Tis all a lie,</l>
               <l>As to my reaſon I can teſtify.</l>
               <l>I own a God, immortal, boundleſs, wiſe,</l>
               <l>Who bid our glories of Creation riſe;</l>
               <l>Who form'd his varied likeneſs in mankind,</l>
               <l>Centring his many wonders in the mind;</l>
               <l>Who ſaw Religion, a fantaſtic night</l>
               <l>But gave us Reaſon to obtain the light.</l>
               <l>Indulgent Whitfield ſcruples not to ſay,</l>
               <l>He only can direct to Heavens high-way.</l>
               <l>While Biſhops, with as much vehemence tell,</l>

Swift as the arrow, haſting to the breaſt,</l>

                  <l>Swift from the wood a prowling Tiger came;</l>
                  <l>Dreadful his voice, his eyes a glowing flame;</l>
