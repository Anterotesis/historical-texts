            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener> 
               <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>PERMIT me to break into your retirement, the reſidence of virtue and literature, and to trouble you with a few reflections on the merits and real character of an admired author, and on other collateral ſubjects, that will naturally ariſe. No love of ſingularity, no affectation of paradoxical opinions, gave riſe to the following work. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere the memory of POPE, I reſpect and honour his abilities; but I do not think him at the head of his profeſſion. In other words, in that ſpecies of poetry wherein POPE excelled, he is ſuperior
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0376800400:3"/>
to all mankind: and I only ſay, that this ſpecies of poetry is not the moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent one of the art. We do not, it ſhould ſeem, ſufficiently attend to the difference there is, betwixt a MAN OF WIT, a MAN OF SENSE, and a TRUE POET. Donne and Swift, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly men of wit, and men of ſenſe: but what traces have they left of PURE POETRY? Fontenelle and La Motte are entitled to the former character; but what can they urge to gain the latter? Which of theſe characters is the moſt valuable and uſeful, is entirely out of the queſtion: all I plead for, is, to have their ſeveral provinces kept diſtinct from each other; and to impreſs on the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, that a clear head, and acute under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding are not ſufficient, alone, to
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0376800400:4"/>
make a POET; that the moſt ſolid obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on human life, expreſſed with the utmoſt elegance and brevity, are MORALITY, and not POETRY; that the EPISTLES of Boileau in RHYME, are no more poetical, than the CHARACTERS of Bruyere in PROSE; and that it is a creative and glowing IMAGINATION, <q rend="inline">"acer ſpiritus ac vis,"</q> and that alone, that can ſtamp a writer with this exalted and very uncommon character, which ſo few poſſeſs, and of which ſo few can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly judge.</p>
            <p>FOR one perſon, who can adequately reliſh, and enjoy, a work of imagination, twenty are to be found who can taſte and judge of, obſervations on familiar life, and the manners of the age. The
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0376800400:5"/>
ſatires of Arioſto, are more read than the Orlando Furioſo, or even Dante. Are there ſo many cordial admirers of Spenſer and Milton, as of Hudibras?—If we ſtrike out of the number of theſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed admirers, thoſe who appear ſuch out of faſhion, and not of feeling. Swift's rhapſody on poetry is far more popular, than Akenſide's noble ode to Lord Huntingdon. The EPISTLES on the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of men and women, and your ſprightly ſatires, my good friend, are more frequently peruſed, and quoted, than L'Allegro and Il Penſeroſo of Milton. Had you written only theſe ſatires, you would indeed have gained the title of a man of wit, and a man of ſenſe; but, I am confident, would not inſiſt on being denominated a POET, MERELY on their account.<q>
                  <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0376800400:6"/>
                  <l>NON SATIS EST PURIS VERSUM PERSCRIBERE VERBIS.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>IT is amazing this matter ſhould ever have been miſtaken, when Horace has taken particular and repeated pains, to ſettle and adjuſt the opinion in queſtion. He has more than once diſclaimed all right and title to the name of POET, on the ſcore of his ethic and ſatiric pieces.

               </q>
are lines, often repeated, but whoſe mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not extended and weighed as it ought to be. Nothing can be more judicious than the method he preſcribes, of trying whether any compoſition be eſſentially poetical or not; which is, to drop entirely the meaſures and numbers, and tranſpoſe and invert the order of the
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0376800400:7"/>
words: and in this unadorned manner to peruſe the paſſage. If there be really in it a true poetical ſpirit, all your inver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions and tranſpoſitions will not diſguiſe and extinguiſh it; but it will retain its luſtre, like a diamond, unſet, and thrown back into the rubbiſh of the mine. Let us make a little experiment on the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing well-known lines; <q rend="inline">"<hi>Yes, you deſpiſe the man that is confined to books, who rails at human kind from his ſtudy; tho' what he learns, he ſpeaks; and may perhaps advance ſome general maxims, or may be right by chance. The coxcomb bird, ſo grave and ſo talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative, that cries whore, knave, and cuckold, from his cage, tho' he rightly call many a paſſenger, you hold him no philoſopher. And yet, ſuch is the fate</hi>
                  <pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0376800400:8"/>
                  <hi>of all extremes, men may be read too much, as well as books. We grow more partial, for the ſake of the obſerver, to obſervations which we ourſelves make; leſs, ſo, to written wiſdom, becauſe another's. Maxims are drawn from no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thoſe from gueſs.</hi>"</q> What ſhall we ſay of this paſſage?—Why, that it is moſt excellent ſenſe, but juſt as poetical as the <q rend="inline">"Qui fit Maecenas"</q> of the author who recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends this method of trial. Take any ten lines of the Iliad, Paradiſe Loſt, or even of the Georgics of Virgil, and ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by any proceſs of critical chymiſtry, you can lower and reduce them to the tameneſs of proſe. You will find that they will appear like Ulyſſes in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0376800400:9"/>
of rags, ſtill a hero, tho' lodged in the cottage of the herdſman Eumaeus.</p>
            <p>THE Sublime and the Pathetic are the two chief nerves of all genuine poeſy. What is there very ſublime or very Pathetic in POPE? In his works there is indeed, <q rend="inline">"nihil inane, nihil arceſſitum;—puro tamen fonti quam magno flumini propior;"</q> as the excellent Quintilian remarks of Lyſias. And becauſe I am perhaps aſhamed or afraid to ſpeak out in plain Engliſh, I will adopt the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſage of Voltaire, which, in my opinion, as exactly characterizes POPE, as it does his model Boileau, for whom it was originally deſigned. <q rend="inline">"INCAPABLE PEUTETRE DU SUBLIME QUI ELEVE L'AME, ET DU SENTIMENT QUI L'ATTENDRIT, MAIS FAIT POUR ECLAIRER CEUX A QUI LA NATURE ACCORDA L'UN
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0376800400:10"/>
ET L'AUTRE, LABORIEUX, SEVERE, PRECIS, PUR, HARMONIEUX, IL DEVINT, ENFIN, LE POETE DE LA RAISON."</q>
            </p>
            <p>OUR Engliſh poets may, I think, be be diſpoſed in four different claſſes and degrees. In the firſt claſs, I would place, firſt, our only three ſublime and pathetic poets; SPENSER, SHAKESPEARE, MILTON; and then, at proper intervals, OTWAY and LEE. In the ſecond claſs ſhould be placed, ſuch as poſſeſſed the true poetical genius, in a more moderate de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, but had noble talents for moral and ethical poeſy. At the head of theſe are DRYDEN, DONNE, DENHAM, COWLEY, CONGREVE. In the third claſs may be placed, men of wit, of elegant taſte, and ſome fancy in deſcribing familiar life. Here may be numbered, PRIOR,
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0376800400:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
WALLER, PARNELL, SWIFT, FENTON. In the fourth claſs, the mere verſifiers, however ſmooth and mellifluous ſome of them may be thought, ſhould be ranked. Such as PITT, SANDYS, FAIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FAX, BROOME, BUCKINGHAM, LANS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOWN. In which of theſe claſſes POPE deſerves to be placed, the following work is intended to determine.</p>

            <p>PRINCES and Authors are ſeldom ſpoken of, during their lives, with juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and impartiality. Admiration and envy, their conſtant attendants, like two unſkilful artiſts, are apt to overcharge their pieces with too great a quantity of light or of ſhade; and are diſqualified happily to hit upon that middle colour, that mixture of
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0376800400:13"/>
error and excellence, which alone renders every repreſentation of man juſt and natural. This perhaps may be one reaſon, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, why we have never yet ſeen a fair and candid criticiſm on the character and merits of our laſt great poet, Mr. POPE. I have therefore thought, that it would be no unpleaſing amuſement, or uninſtructive employment to examine at large, without blind panegyric, or petulant invective, the writings of this Engliſh Claſſic, in the order in which they are arranged in the elegant edition of Mr. Warburton. As I ſhall nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther cenſure nor commend, without alleging the reaſon on which my opinion is founded, I ſhall be entirely unmoved at the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of malignity, or the clamours of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular prejudice.</p>
            <p>IT is ſomething ſtrange, that in the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torals of a young poet there ſhould not be found a ſingle rural image that is new: but this I am afraid is the caſe in the PASTORALS before us. The ideas of Theocritus, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0376800400:14"/>
and Spenſer, are indeed here exhibited in language equally mellifluous and pure; but the deſcriptions and ſentiments are trite and common. That the deſign of paſtoral poeſy is, to repreſent the undiſturbed felicity of the golden age, is an empty notion, which, though ſupported by a Rapin and a Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelle, I think, all rational critics have agreed to exſtirpate and explode. But I do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that even theſe laſt-mentioned cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics have remarked the circumſtance that gave origin to the opinion that any golden age was intended. Theocritus, the father and the model of this enchanting ſpecies of compoſition, lived and wrote in Sicily. The climate of Sicily was delicious, and the face of the country various, and beautiful: it's vallies and it's precipices, it's grot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos and caſcades were SWEETLY INTER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHANGED, and it's fruits and flowers were laviſh and luſcious. The poet deſcribed what he ſaw and felt: and had no need to have recourſe to thoſe artificial aſſemblages of pleaſing objects, which are not to be found
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0376800400:15"/>
in nature. The figs and the honey which he aſſigns as a reward to a victorious ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd were in themſelves exquiſite, and are therefore aſſigned with great propriety<note n="*" place="bottom">Idyll. i. ver. 146.</note>: and the beauties of that luxurious land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchape ſo richly and circumſtantially deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated in the cloſe of the ſeventh idyllium, where all things ſmelt of ſummer and ſmelt of autumn,

were preſent and real. Succeeding writers ſuppoſing theſe beauties too great and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant to be real, referred them to the fictitious and imaginary ſcenes of a golden age.</p>
            <p>A MIXTURE of Britiſh and Grecian ideas may juſtly be deemed a blemiſh in the PAS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TORALS of POPE: and propriety is certainly violated, when he couples Pactolus with Thames, and Windſor with Hybla. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of IMMODERATE heat, and wiſhes to be conveyed to cooling caverns, when uttered
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0376800400:16"/>
by the inhabitants of Greece, have a deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum and conſiſtency, which they totally loſe in the character of a Britiſh ſhepherd: and Theocritus, during the ardors of Sirius, muſt have heard the murmurings of a brook, and the whiſpers of a pine, <note n="*" place="bottom">Idyll. i. ver. 1.</note> with more home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt pleaſure, than Pope <note n="†" place="bottom">Paſt. iv. ver. 1.</note> could poſſibly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience upon the ſame occaſion. We can never completely reliſh, or adequately under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand any author, eſpecially any Ancient, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we conſtantly keep in our eye his cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, his country, and his age. POPE him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf informs us, in a note, that he judiciouſly omitted the following verſe,

                  <l>And liſt'ning wolves grow milder as they hear <note n="‡" place="bottom">Paſt. ii.</note>

               </q>
on account of the abſurdity, which Spenſer overlooked, of introducing wolves into Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. But on this principle, which is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a juſt one, may it not be aſked, why he ſhould ſpeak, the ſcene lying in Windſor-

I cannot forbear adding, that the riddle of the <hi>Royal Oak,</hi> in the firſt Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toral, invented in imitation of the Virgilian aenigmas in the third eclogue, ſavours of pun, and puerile conceit.<q>

            <p>THAT POPE has not equalled Theocritus, will indeed appear leſs ſurpriſing, if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that no original writer ever remained ſo unrivalled by ſucceeding copyiſts, as this Sici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian maſter.</p>
            <p>IF it ſhould be objected, that the barren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of invention imputed to POPE from a view of his PASTORALS, is equally imputable to the Bucolics of Virgil, it may be anſwered, that whatever may be determined of the reſt, yet the firſt and laſt Eclogues of Virgil are indiſputable proofs of true genius, and power of fancy. The influence of war on the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity of rural life<note n="†" place="bottom"> I have been lately highly entertained with the accidental peruſal of FIVE PASTORALS, written on this plan, deſcriptive of the calamities ſuppoſed to have been felt by the ſhepherds of Germany during the laſt war: They abound in many new circumſtances of paſtoral diſtreſs, and many tender images.

of the firſt new, and intereſting: its compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is truly dramatic; and the characters of it's two ſhepherds are well ſupported, and happily contraſted: and the laſt has expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively painted the changeful reſolutions, the wild wiſhes, the paſſionate and abrupt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations, of a diſappointed and deſpairing lover.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole, the principal merit of the PASTORALS of POPE conſiſts, in their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and muſical verſification; muſical, to a degree of which rhyme could hardly be thought capable: and in giving the firſt ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimen of that harmony in Engliſh verſe, which is now become indiſpenſably neceſſary; and which has ſo forcibly and univerſally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced the publick ear, as to have rendered every moderate rhymer melodious. POPE lengthened the abruptneſs of Waller, and at the ſame time contracted the exuberance of Dryden.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0376800400:22"/>
I REMEMBER to have been informed, by an intimate friend of POPE, that he had once laid a deſign of writing AMERICAN ECLOGUES: The ſubject would have been fruitful of the moſt poetical imagery; and, if properly executed, would have reſcued the author from the accuſation here urged, of having written Eclogues without invention.</p>
            <p>OUR author, who had received an early tincture of religion, a reverence for which he preſerved to the laſt, was with juſtice con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that the ſcriptures of God contained not only the pureſt precepts of morality, but the moſt elevated and ſublime ſtrokes of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine poeſy; ſtrokes as much ſuperior to any thing Heatheniſm can produce, as is Jehovah to Jupiter. This is the caſe more particularly in the exalted propheſy of Iſaiah, which POPE has ſo ſucceſsfully verſified in an Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, that inconteſtably ſurpaſſes the Pollio of Virgil: although perhaps the dignity, the energy, and the ſimplicity of the original are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0376800400:23"/>
in a few paſſages weakened and diminiſhed by florid epithets, and uſeleſs circumlocutions.

               </q>
are lines which have too much prettineſs, and too modern an air. The judicious addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of circumſtances and adjuncts is what renders poeſy a more lively imitation of nature than proſe. POPE has been happy in introducing the following circumſtance: the prophet ſays, <q rend="inline">"The parched ground ſhall become a pool;"</q> Our author ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes this idea by ſaying, that the ſhepherd,

            <p>ON the other hand, the prophet has been ſometimes particular, when POPE has been only general. <q rend="inline">"Lift up thine eyes round about, and ſee; all they gather themſelves together, they come to thee:—The multitude of CAMELS ſhall cover thee: the DROMEDARIES of Median and Ephah: all they from Sheba ſhall come: they ſhall bring gold and incenſe, and they ſhall ſhew forth the praiſes of the Lord.

            <p>AS proſperity and happineſs are deſcribed in this Eclogue by a combination of the moſt pleaſing and agreeable objects, ſo miſery and deſtruction are as forcibly delineated in the ſame Iſaiah, by the circumſtances of diſtreſs and deſolation, that were to attend the fall of that magnificent city, Babylon: and the latter is perhaps a more proper and intereſting ſubject for poetry than the former; as ſuch kinds of objects make the deepeſt impreſſion on the mind: pity being a ſtronger ſenſation than complacency. Accordingly a noble ode on the deſtruction of Babylon, taken from the fourteenth chapter of Iſaiah, has been written by Mr. Lowth, whoſe latin prelec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the inimitable poeſy of the Hebrews, abounding in remarks entirely new, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the pureſt and moſt expreſſive lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, are the richeſt augmentation literature

                  <p>"THE prophet having predicted the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the Jews, and their return into their own country from their rigorous Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſh captivity, inſtantly introduces them ſinging a certain triumphal ſong on the fall of the king of Babylon; a ſong abounding in the moſt ſplendid images, and carried on by perpetual, and thoſe very beautiful, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonifications. The ſong begins with a ſudden exclamation of the Jews, expreſſing their joy and wonder at the unexpected change of their condition, and death of the tyrant. Earth with her inhabitants triumphs; the firs and cedars of Libanus, under which images the allegoric ſtyle frequently ſhadows the kings and princes of the Gentiles, rejoice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult with reproaches the broken power of their moſt implacable foe.<q>

                        <l>Even the firs rejoice at thee, the cedars of Libanus:</l>

                     </q> There follows a moſt daring proſopopeia of ORCUS, or the infernal regions: he rouzes his inhabitants, the manes of princes, and the ſhades of departed kings: immediately all of them ariſe from their thrones, and walk forward to meet the king of Babylon; they inſult and deride him, and gather con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation from his calamity.<q>
                        <l>Art thou alſo made weak as we? art thou made like unto us?</l>

                     </q> The Jews are again repreſented ſpeaking: they moſt ſtrongly exaggerate his remarkable fall, by an exclamation formed in the manner of funeral lamentations:<q>
                        <l>How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, ſon of the morning!</l>

<q>
                        <l>Is this the man who made earth tremble, who ſhook the kingdoms?</l>
                        <l>Who made the world a ſolitude, and deſtroyed it's cities?</l>
                     </q>
They reproach him with the loſs of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon rite of ſepulture, which was deſervedly denied to him for his cruelty and oppreſſion, and curſe his name, his race, and poſterity.

One continued action is carried on; or rather a various and manifold ſeries of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent actions is connected. Every excellence, more peculiarly appropriated to the ſublimer ode, is conſummatley diſplayed in this poem of Iſaiah, which is the moſt perfect and unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled model, among all the monuments of antiquity. The perſonages are frequent, but not confuſed; are bold but not affected; a free, lofty, and truly divine ſpirit predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates through the whole. Nor is any thing wanting to crown and complete the ſublimity

THE poets, both ancient and modern, are obliged to the rivers for ſome of their moſt moſt ſtriking deſcriptions. The Tiber, and the Nile of Virgil, the Aufidus of Horace, the Sabrina of Milton, and the Scamander of Homer, are among their capital figures.</p>
            <p>THE influences and effects of peace, and its conſequence, a diffuſive commerce, are expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by ſelecting ſuch circumſtances, as are beſt adapted to ſtrike the imagination by lively pictures; the ſelection of which chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes true poetry.

               </q> The two epithets <hi>native</hi> and <hi>ſable</hi> have pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar elegance and force; and as Peru was particularly famous for its long ſucceſſion of Incas, and Mexico for many magnificent works of maſſy gold, there is great propriety in fixing the reſtoration of the grandeur of each to that object, for which each was once ſo remarkable.</p>
            <p>THE groupe of allegorical perſonages that ſucceeds the laſt mentioned lines, are worthy the pencil of Rubens or Julio Romano: it may, perhaps, however be wiſhed that the epithets <hi>barbarous</hi> (diſcord), <hi>mad</hi> (ambition), <hi>hateful</hi> (envy), <note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 411. et ſeq.</note> had been particular and pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſque, inſtead of general and indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating; though it may poſſibly be urged, that in deſcribing the dreadful inhabitants of the portal of hell, Virgil has not always uſed

            <p>A PERSON of no ſmall rank has informed me, that Mr. Addiſon was inexpreſſibly cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grined at this noble concluſion of WINDSOR-FOREST, both as a politician and as a poet. As a politician, becauſe it ſo highly celebrated that treaty of peace which he deemed ſo perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to the liberties of Europe; and as a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0376800400:41"/>
poet, becauſe he was deeply conſcious that his own CAMPAIGN, that gazette in rhyme, contained no ſtrokes of ſuch genuine and ſublime poetry as the concluſion before us.</p>
            <p>IT is one of the greateſt and moſt pleaſing arts of deſcriptive poetry, to introduce moral ſentences and inſtructions in an oblique and indirect manner, in places where one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally expects only painting and amuſement. We have virtue, as Mr. POPE remarks, <note n="*" place="bottom">Iliad. B. 16. in the notes: Ver. 465.</note> put upon us by ſurprize, and are pleaſed to find a thing where we ſhould never have looked to meet with it. I muſt do a noble En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh poet the juſtice to obſerve, that it is this particular art that is the very diſtinguiſhing excellence of COOPERS-HILL; throughout which, the deſcriptions of places, and images raiſed by the poet, are ſtill tending to ſome hint, or leading into ſome reflection, upon moral life, or political inſtitution; much in the ſame manner as the real ſight of ſuch ſcenes and proſpects is apt to give the mind a
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0376800400:42"/>
compoſed turn, and incline it to thoughts and contemplations that have a relation to the object. This is the great charm of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable ELEGY written in a Country Church-Yard. Having mentioned the ruſtic monuments and ſimple epitaphs of the ſwains, the amiable poet falls into a very natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection:<q>
                  <l>For who, to dumb forgetfulneſs a prey,</l>
                  <l>This pleaſing anxious being e'er reſign'd,</l>
                  <l>Left the warm precincts of the chearful day,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>OF this art Mr. POPE has exhibited ſome ſpecimens in the poem we are examining, but not ſo many as might be expected from a mind ſo ſtrongly inclined to a moral way of writing. After ſpeaking of hunting the hare, he immediately ſubjoins, much in the ſpirit of Denham,

            <p>BOHOURS would rank this compariſon among falſe thoughts and Italian conceits; ſuch particularly as abound in the works of Marino. The fallacy conſiſts in giving deſign and artifice to the wood, as well as to the

               </q> where this exquiſite picture heightens the diſtreſs, and powerfully excites the commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeration, of the reader. To this purpoſe I may add a paſſage in an ODE to Fancy, <note n="†" place="bottom">Dodſley's Miſcell. Pag. 80.

               </q> The object of fear indicated in the two laſt lines, is, I believe, new and unborrowed, and intereſts us in the ſcene deſcribed.

IT may be obſerved in general, that deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cription of the external beauties of nature, is uſually the firſt effort of a young genius, before he hath ſtudied manners and paſſions. Some of Milton's moſt early, as well as moſt exquiſite pieces, are his Lycidas, L'Allegro, and Il Penſeroſo; if we may except his Ode on the Nativity of Chriſt, which is indeed prior in the order of time, and in which a penetrating critic might have diſcovered the ſeeds of that boundleſs imagination, which was one day to produce the Paradiſe Loſt. This ode, which, by the way, is not ſufficiently read, or admired, is alſo of the deſcriptive kind; but the objects of his deſcription are great, and ſtriking to the imagination; the falſe gods and goddeſſes of the Heathen forſaking their temples on the birth of our ſaviour, divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and oracles at an end! which facts though perhaps not hiſtorically true, are poetically beautiful.<q>
                  <l>The lonely mountains o'er,</l>

chiefly on this ode as much leſs celebrated than L'Allegro and Il Penſoroſo, which are now univerſally known, but which by a ſtrange fatality lay in a ſort of obſcurity, the private enjoyment of a few curious readers, till they were ſet to admirable muſic by Mr. Handel. And indeed this Volume of Milton's miſcellaneous poems has not till very lately met with ſuitable regard. Shall I offend any rational admirer of POPE by remarking, that theſe juvenile deſcriptive poems of Milton, as well as his latin elegies, are of a ſtrain far more exalted than any the former author can boaſt? Let me add at the ſame time, what juſtice obliges me to add, that they are far more incorrect. For in the very ode before us, occur one or two paſſages, that are pue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rile and affected, to a degree not to be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelled in the purer, but leſs elevated, compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of POPE. The ſeaſon being winter, Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton has ſaid, that in honour to Jeſus,

            <p>IT would be unpardonable to conclude theſe remarks on deſcriptive poeſy, without taking notice of the SEASONS of Thomſon, who had peculiar and powerful talents for
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0376800400:53"/>
this ſpecies of compoſition. Let the reader therefore pardon a digreſſion, if ſuch it be, on his merits and character. Thomſon was bleſſed with a ſtrong and copious fancy; he hath enriched poetry with a variety of new and original images, which he painted from nature itſelf, and from his own actual obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations: his deſcriptions have therefore a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctneſs and truth, which are utterly wanting to thoſe, of poets who have only copied from each other, and have never looked abroad on the objects themſelves. Thomſon was accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed to wander away into the country for days and for weeks, attentive to, <q rend="inline">"each rural ſight, each rural ſound;"</q> while many a poet who has dwelt for years in the Strand, has attempted to deſcribe fields and rivers, and generally ſucceeded accordingly. Hence that nauſeous repetition of the ſame circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; hence that diſguſting impropriety of introducing what may be called a ſet of here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary images, without proper regard to the age, or climate, or occaſion, in which they were formerly uſed. Though the diction of
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0376800400:54"/>
the SEASONS is ſometimes harſh and inharmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious, and ſometimes turgid and obſcure, and though in many inſtances, the numbers are not ſufficiently diverſified by different pauſes, yet is this poem on the whole, from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs ſtrokes of nature in which it abounds, one of the moſt captivating and amuſing in our language, and which, as its beauties are not of a fugacious kind, as depending on par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular cuſtoms and manners, will ever be peruſed with delight. The ſcenes of Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon are frequently as wild and romantic as thoſe of Salvator Roſa, pleaſingly varied with precipices and torrents, and <q rend="inline">"caſtled cliffs,"</q> and deep vallies, with piny mountains, and the gloomieſt caverns. Innumerable are the little circumſtances in his deſcriptions, totally unobſerved by all his predeceſſors. What poet hath ever taken notice of the leaf, that towards the end of autumn,<q>

THESE obſervations on Thomſon, which however would not have been ſo large, if there had been already any conſiderable cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm on his character, might be ſtill aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by an examination and developement of the beauties in the Loves of the birds, in SPRING, verſe 580. A view of the torrid zone in SUMMER, verſe 626. The riſe of fountains and rivers in AUTUMN, verſe 781. A man periſhing in the ſnows, in WINTER, verſe 277, and the wolves deſcending from the Alps, and and a view of winter within the polar circle, verſe 809, which are all of them highly finiſhed originals, excepting a few of thoſe blemiſhes intimated above. WINTER is in my apprehenſion the moſt valuable of theſe four poems, the ſcenes of it, like thoſe of Il Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeroſo of Milton, being of that awful, and

ſolemn, and penſive kind, on which a great genius beſt delights to dwell.</p>
            <p>MR. POPE it ſeems was of opinion, that deſcriptive poetry is a compoſition as abſurd as a feaſt made up of ſauces: and I know many other perſons that think meanly of it. I will not preſume to ſay it is equal, either in dignity or utility, to thoſe compoſitions that lay open the internal conſtitution of man, and that IMITATE characters, manners, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents. I may however remind ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temners of it, that, in a ſiſter-art, landſchape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painting claims the very next rank to hiſtory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>painting; being ever preferred to ſingle por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traits, to pieces of ſtill-life, to droll figures, to fruit and flower-pieces; that Titian thought it no diminution of his genius, to ſpend much of his time in works of the former ſpecies; and that, if their principles lead them to condemn Thomſon, they muſt alſo condemn the Georgics of Virgil, and the greateſt part of the nobleſt deſcriptive poem extant, I mean, that of Lucretius.</p>

WE are next to ſpeak of the LYRIC pieces of POPE. He uſed to declare, that if Mr. Dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den had finiſhed a tranſlation of the Iliad, he would not have attempted one after ſo great a maſter; he might have ſaid with more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, I will not write a muſic-ode after Alexander's Feaſt, which the variety and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of its numbers, and the beauty and force of its images, have conſpired to place at the head of modern lyric compoſitions. This of Mr. POPE is, however, indiſputably the ſecond of the kind, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The inferiority of Addiſon's ODE, to POPE, on this ſubject, is manifeſt and remarkable. What proſaic tameneſs and inſipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity do we meet with in the following lines? <q>
                        <l>Cecilia's name does all our numbers grace,</l>
                        <l>From every voice the tuneful accents fly,</l>
                        <l>In ſoaring trebles now it riſes high,</l>
                        <l>And now it ſinks and dwells upon the baſe.</l>
                     </q> This almoſt deſcends to burleſque. What follows is hardly rhyme, and ſurely not poetry: <q>
                        <l>Conſecrate the place and day,</l>
                        <l>To muſic and Cecilia.</l>
                        <l>Muſic the greateſt <hi>good</hi> that mortals know.—</l>
                        <l>Muſic can noble <hi>hints</hi> impart.—</l>
                     </q> There follows in this ſtanza, which is the third, a deſcription of a ſubject very trite, Orpheus drawing the beaſts about him. POPE ſhewed his ſuperior judgment in taking no notice of this old ſtory, and ſelecting a more new, as well as more ſtriking incident, in the life of Orpheus. It was the cuſtom of this time, for almoſt every rhymer to try his hand in an ode on St. Cecilia; we find many deſpicable rapſodies, ſo called, in Tonſon's Miſcellanies. We have therefore alſo preſerved another, and an earlier ode, of Dryden on this ſubject. One ſtanza of which I cannot forbear inſerting in this note. It was ſet to muſic 1687. by I. Baptiſta Dragh. <q>
                        <l>What paſſion cannot muſic raiſe and quell!</l>
                        <l>When Jubal ſtruck the chorded ſhell,</l>
                        <l>His liſt'ning brethren ſtood around,</l>
                        <l>And wond'ring on their faces fell,</l>
                        <l>To worſhip that celeſtial ſound:</l>
                        <l>Leſs than a god they thought there could not dwell,</l>
                        <l>Within the hollow of that ſhell,</l>
                        <l>That ſpoke ſo ſweetly and ſo well.</l>
                        <l>What paſſion cannot muſic raiſe and quell!</l>
                     </q>
                  </p> 
                  <p>This is ſo complete and engaging a hiſtory-piece, that I knew a perſon of taſte who was reſolved to have it executed, if an artiſt could have been found, on one ſide of his ſalloon. In which caſe, ſaid he, the painter has nothing to do, but to ſubſtitute colours for words, the deſign being finiſhed to his hands. The reader doubtleſs obſerves the fine effect of the repetition of the laſt line; as well as the ſtroke of nature, in making theſe rude hearers imagine ſome god lay concealed in this firſt muſician's inſtrument.</p>

uſe an expreſſion of Quintilian. The firſt ſtanza is almoſt a
perfect concert of itſelf; every different inſtrument is deſcribed 
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0376800400:65"/> and illuſtrated, in numbers, that admirably repreſent,
and correſpond to its different qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities and genius. The beginning of the
ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſtanza, on the power which muſic ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erts over the paſſions,
is a little flat, and by no means equal to the concluſion of that ſtanza.
The animating ſong that Orpheus ſung to the Argonauts, copied from Valerius
Flaccus, for that of Apollonius is of a different nature, is the happily
choſen ſubject of the fourth. On hearing which, 
<q> 
                  <l>Each chief his ſevenfold ſhield diſplay'd,</l>
                  <l>And half unſheath'd the ſhining blade;</l>
               </q> Which effects of the ſong, however lively, do not equal the force and
ſpirit of what Dryden aſcribes to the ſong of his Grecian artiſt; for
when Timotheus cries out REVENGE, raiſes the furies, and calls up to
Alexander's view a troop of Grecian ghoſts that were ſlain and left
unburied, inglorious and forgotten, each of them waving a torch in his hand,
and pointing to the hoſtile temples of the Perſians, and demanding
vengeance of their prince, he <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0376800400:66"/> inſtantly ſtarted from
his throne, 
<q> 
                  <l>—Seiz'd a flambeau with zeal to deſtroy,</l>
               </q> while Thais and the attendant princes ruſhed out with him, to ſet fire
to the city. The whole train of imagery in this ſtanza is alive, ſublime,
and animated to an unparallelled degree; the poet had ſo ſtrongly
poſſeſſed himſelf of the action deſcribed, that he places it fully
before the eyes of the reader.</p>
            <p>THE deſcent of Orpheus into hell is grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully introduced in the fourth ſtanza, as it naturally flowed from the ſubject of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding one; the deſcription of the infernal regions is well imagined, and the effects of the muſician's lyre on the inhabitants of hell, are elegantly tranſlated from the fourth Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic of Virgil, <note n="*" place="bottom">Ver. 480.</note> and happily adapted to the ſubject in queſtion. The ſupplicating ſong at the beginning of the ſixth ſtanza, is highly pathetic and poetical, eſpecially when he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures the powers below,<q>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0376800400:67"/>
                  <l>By the hero's armed ſhades</l>
                  <l>Glittering through the gloomy glades,</l>
                  <l>By the youths that dy'd for love</l>
                  <l>Wand'ring in the myrtle grove;</l>
               </q> Theſe images are pictureſque and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated; and theſe are ſuch notes as might,

                  <l>And make hell grant what love did ſeek.</l>
               </q>
But the numbers that conclude this ſtanza are of ſo burleſque and ridiculous a kind, and have ſo much the air of an Hudibraſtic ſong at a county election, that one is amazed and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned to find them in a ſerious ode, and in an ode of a writer eminently ſkilled, in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, in accommodating his ſounds to his ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.<q>
                  <l>Thus ſong could prevail</l>

One would imagine that John Dennis, or ſome hero of the Dunciad, had been here attempting to traveſty this deſcription of the reſtoration of Eurydice to life.

            <p>VIRGIL is again imitated throughout the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0376800400:69"/>
ſixth ſtanza, which deſcribes the behaviour of Orpheus on the ſecond loſs of Eurydice. I wiſh POPE had inſerted that ſtriking circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, ſo ſtrongly imagined, of a certain me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy murmur, or rather diſmal ſhriek, that was heard all around the lakes of Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, the moment Orpheus looked back on his wife;
<q>
                  <l>—Terque fragor ſtagnis auditus Avernis. <note n="*" place="bottom">Georgic 4, 493.</note>
                  </l>
               </q>
And as proſopopeias are a great beauty in lyric poetry, ſurely he ſhould not have omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted thoſe natural and pathetic exclamations of Eurydice, the moment ſhe was ſnatched back, and which ſhe uttered as ſhe was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ſinking to the ſhades, eſpecially where ſhe movingly takes her laſt adieu,
<q>
                  <l>Jamque vale!—</l>
               </q>
And adds, that ſhe is now ſurrounded with a vaſt darkneſs, <q rend="inline">"feror ingenti circumdata

                  </l>
               </q>
This lively and pathetic attitude would have ſhone under the hands of POPE. The reader, I preſume, feels the effect of the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious placing in the verſe, <hi>heu! non tua,</hi> and of its repetition after <hi>tibi.</hi> The places in which Orpheus, according to POPE, made his lamentations, are not ſo wild, ſo ſavage and diſmal, as thoſe mentioned by Virgil; to introduce him <q rend="inline">"beſide the falls of foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,"</q> conveys not ſuch an image of deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and deſpair, as the caverns on the banks of Strymon and Tanais, the Hyperborean deſarts, and the Riphaean ſolitudes. And to ſay of Hebrus, only, that it <q rend="inline">"rolls in mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,"</q> is flat and frigid, and does not heighten the melancholy of the place. There is an antitheſis in the ſucceeding lines, <q rend="inline">"he glows amid Rhodope's ſnows,"</q> which I hope the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0376800400:71"/>
poet did not intend, as it would be a trivial and puerile conceit. The death of Orpheus is expreſſed with a beautiful brevity and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptneſs, ſuitable to the nature of the ode;<q>
                  <l>Hark! Haemus reſounds with the Bacchanals cries,</l>
                  <l>Ah! ſee he dies!</l>
                  <l>Yet ev'n in death Eurydice he <hi>ſung.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q> Where inſtead of <hi>ſung,</hi> Virgil ſays <hi>vocabat,</hi> which is more natural and tender; and Virgil adds a very moving epithet, that he called <hi>miſeram</hi> Eurydicen. I am ſenſible POPE never intended an exact tranſlation of the paſſages of the Georgics here alleged; I only hint, that in my humble judgment he has omitted ſome of the moſt ſtriking incidents in the ſtory. I have lately ſeen a manuſcript ode, entitled, <q rend="inline">"On the Uſe and Abuſe of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry,"</q> in which Orpheus in conſidered in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and a higher light, according to ancient mythology, as the firſt legiſlator and civilizer of mankind.

               </q> It is obſervable that this ode of POPE, and the Alexander's Feaſt of Dryden, both of them conclude with an epigram of four lines; a ſpecies of wit as flagrantly unſuitable to the dignity, and as foreign to the nature, of the lyric, as it is of the epic muſe.</p>

IT is to be regretted, that Mr. Handel has not ſet to muſic the former, as well as the latter, of theſe celebrated odes, in which he has diſplayed the combined powers of verſe and voice, to a wonderful degree. No poem indeed, affords ſo much various matter for a compoſer to work upon; as Dryden has here introduced and expreſſed all the greater paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and as the tranſitions from one to the other are ſudden and impetuous. Of which we feel the effects, in the pathetic deſcription of the fall of Darius, that immediately ſucceeds the joyous praiſes of Bacchus. The ſymphony, and air particularly, that accompanies the four words, <q rend="inline">"fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen,"</q> is ſtrangely moving, <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The mention of this pathetic air, reminds me of a ſtory of the celebrated Lully, who having been one day accuſed of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſetting any thing to muſic, but the languid verſes of Quin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ault, was immediately animated with the reproach, and as it were ſeized with a kind of enthuſiaſm; he ran inſtantly to his harpſichord, and ſtriking a few cords, ſung in recitative theſe four lines in the Iphigenia of Racine, which are full of the ſtrongeſt imagery, and are therefore much more difficult to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs in muſic, than verſes of mere ſentiment, <q>
                        <l>Un prêtre environné d'une foule cruelle</l>
                        <l>Portera ſur ma fille une main criminelle,</l>

                     </q> One of the company has often declared that they all thought themſelves preſent at this dreadful ſpectacle, and that the notes with which Lully accompanied theſe words, erected the hair of their heads with horror.</p> 
                  <p>The opinion of Boileau concerning muſic is remarkable; he aſſerts, qu'on ne peut jamais faire un bon opera; parceque la muſique ne ſauroit narrer; que les paſſions n'y peuvent etre peintes dans toute l'etenduë qu'elles demandent; que d'ail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leurs elle ne ſauroit ſouvent mettre en chant les expreſſions vraiment ſublimes et courageuſes.</p>

divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, into which, in compliance with a vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and vulgar taſte,

the ear, by its tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous uniformity, and by the number of iden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical cadences.
And indeed to ſpeak truth, there appears to be little valuable in Petrarch,
except the purity of his diction. His ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments even of love, are
metaphyſical and far fetched, neither is there much variety in his
ſubjects, or fancy in his method of treating them; Metaſtaſio is a much
better lyric poet. When Boileau attempted an ode, he exhibited a glaring proof,
of what will be more fully inſiſted on in the courſe of this Eſſay,

Motte, are fuller of delicate <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0376800400:79"/> ſentiment, and
philoſophical reflection, than of imagery, of figures, and poetry. There are
particular ſtanzas eminently good, but not one entire ode. Some of

            <p>THE next LYRIC compoſitions of Pope, are two choruſes inſerted in a very heavy tragedy, altered from Shakeſpear by the Duke of Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham; in which we ſee, that the moſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate obſervation of dramatic rules without genius, is of no effect. Theſe choruſes are

            <p>THE judicious author of the tragedy of Elfrida, hath given occaſion to a kind of controverſy among the more curious critics, concerning the utility of the chorus, which, after the model of the ancients, he hath en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to revive. To imagine, that the great Grecian maſters retained it only out of reſpect to its antiquity, and from no intrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0376800400:86"/>
valuableneſs or propriety of the thing, can ſcarcely be imagined. The ſentiments of the excellent Brumoy are moderate and rational, and ſeem to comprehend all that is neceſſary to be ſaid on this ſubject. <q rend="inline">"I know ſays he, the chorus is attended with inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, and that it has ſometimes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the ancients to violate probability; but it notwithſtanding is apparent by the uſe they ſometimes made of it, that its advantages exceed its inconveniences. Sophocles had the addreſs to withdraw his chorus for a few moments, when their abſence was neceſſary, as in the Ajax. If the chorus therefore incommodes the poet, and puts him under difficulties, he muſt charge it ſolely to his own want of dexterity. What advantage, on the other hand, may he not reap, from a body of actors that fill the ſtage; that render more lively, ſtriking, and ſenſible, the continuity of the action, and give it the air of greater PROBABILITY, ſince it is not natural or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable, that a great and illuſtrious action,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0376800400:87"/>
ſuch as a revolution in a ſtate, ſhould paſs without witneſſes. We perceive and feel a kind of void on our ſtage, on account of the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of choruſes; and the ſucceſsful attempt of Racine, who adopted and revived the uſe of them in his ATHALIA and ESTHER, were ſufficient, one would imagine, to undeceive and convince us, of their importance, and utility. The baniſhment of the chorus has been the neceſſary conſequence of the cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the moderns, to take for their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations, ALL kinds of ſubjects; whereas the ancients treated only ſuch actions as were publicly tranſacted: and to fill, and indeed overcharge the action with incidents and ſurprizes. For how could theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and theſe various crowded events and incidents, have been poſſibly introduced in a public place, expoſed to the view of cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers and the people, while the generality of our tragedies turn on particular and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate affairs, ou la cour et le peuple n'en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trent ſouvent pour rien? the Athenian ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators were ever accuſtomed to concern

The modern ſtage, by its diſuſe of the chorus, may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have gained a great number of fine ſubjects for tragedy; yet, in return, it is burthened with confidents, it looſes the continuity of action, and is deprived of the magnificent ſpectacle that ſerves to ſupport that action, and which is, if I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the expreſſion, le <hi>fonds,</hi> ou l <hi>'accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagnement</hi> du tableau."<note n="*" place="bottom">Le Theatre de Grecs.

naturally ariſe from the ſubject; it has how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever kept us too long from ſurveying a valuable literary curioſity, I mean the earlieſt produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of POPE, written when he was not twelve years old, his ODE ON SOLITUDE. The firſt ſketches of ſuch an artiſt ought highly to be prized. Different geniuſes unfold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at different periods of life.

Not only inclination, but opportunity and encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, a proper ſubject, or a proper pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tron, influence the exertion or the ſuppreſſion of genius. Theſe ſtanzas on Solitude, are a ſtrong inſtance of that contemplative and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral turn, which was the diſtinguiſhing charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic of our poet's mind. An ode of Cowley which he produced at the age of thirteen years, is of the ſame caſt, and perhaps not in the leaſt inferior to this of POPE. The voluminous Lopez de Vega, is commonly, but I fear incredibly, reported by the Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, to have compoſed verſes when he was five years old; and Torquato Taſſo, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond

of the Italian poets, for that wonderful original Dante is the firſt, is ſaid to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited poems and orations of his writing, when he was ſeven. It is however certain, which is more extraordinary, that he produced his Rinaldo in his eighteenth year, no bad pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſor to the Gieruſalemma Liberata, and no ſmall effort of that genius, which was one day to ſhew, how fine an epic poem the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian language, notwithſtanding the vulgar imputation of effeminacy, was capable of producing.</p>

He frequently declared, that the time of his beginning to write verſes, was ſo very early in his life, that he could ſcarcely recal it to his memory. When he was yet a child, his father, who had been a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in London, and retired to Binfield with about twenty thouſand pounds, would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0376800400:91"/>
order him to make Engliſh verſes. It ſeems he was difficult to be pleaſed, <note n="*" place="bottom">See his Works, vol. 4. pag. 18.</note> and would make the lad correct them again and again. When at laſt he approved them, he took great pleaſure in peruſing them, and would ſay, <q rend="inline">"theſe are good RHYMES."</q> Theſe early praiſes of a tender and reſpected parent, cooperating with the natural inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſon, may poſſibly be the cauſes that fixed our young bard in a reſolution of becoming eminent in this art. He was taught to read very early by an aunt; and of his own indefatigable induſtry learned to write, by copying printed books, which he executed with great neatneſs and exactneſs. When he was eight years old, he was put under the direction of one Taverner, a prieſt, who taught him the rudiments of the latin and greek tongues together. About this time he accidentally met with Ogilby's tranſlation of Homer, which, notwithſtanding the deadneſs and inſipidity of the verſification, arreſted
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0376800400:92"/>
his attention by the force of the ſtory. The Ovid of Sandys fell next in his way; and it is ſaid, that the raptures theſe tranſlations gave him were ſo ſtrong, that he ſpoke of them with pleaſure to the period of his life. About ten, being now at ſchool at Hide-park corner, whither he went from a popiſh ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary at Twiford, near Wincheſter, he was carried ſometimes to the playhouſe; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtruck, we may imagine, with theatrical repreſentations, he turned the chief events into a kind of play, made up of a number of ſpeeches from Ogilby's tranſlation, connected with verſes of his own. He perſuaded the upper boys to act this piece, which, from its curioſity, one would have been glad to have beheld. The maſter's gardener repreſented the character of Ajax; and the actors were dreſſed after the pictures of his favourite Ogil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, far the beſt part of that book, as they were deſigned and engraved by artiſts of note.

and of Dryden. The ſecond is ſaid to have made a poet of Cowley; that Ogilby ſhould give our author his firſt poetic pleaſures, is a remarkable circumſtance. On the firſt ſight of Dryden he abandoned the reſt, having now found an author, whoſe caſt was exactly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial with his own. His works therefore he ſtudied, with equal pleaſure and attention: he placed them before his eyes as a model; of which more will be ſaid in the courſe of theſe papers. He copied not only his harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious verſification, but the very turns of his periods. It was hence he was enabled to give to rhyme all the harmony of which it is capable. <note n="*" place="bottom">See WORKS, vol. 4. pag. 18.</note>

            <p>ABOUT this time, that is about fifteen years old, he began to write his ALCANDER, an epic poem, of which he himſelf ſpeaks with ſo much amiable frankneſs and ingenuity, in a paſſage reſtored to his excellent preface to his works. <q rend="inline">"I confeſs there was a time when

QUINTILIAN, whoſe knowledge of human nature was conſummate, has obſerved, that nothing very correct and faultleſs, is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in very early years, from a truly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated genius: that a generous extravagance and exuberance are its proper marks, and that a premature exactneſs is a certain evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of future flatneſs and ſterility.

Whether theſe early productions of POPE, would not have appeared to Quintilian to be rather too finiſhed, correct, and pure, and what he would have inferred concerning them, is too delicate a ſubject for me to enlarge upon. Let me rather add an entertaining anecdote. When Guido and Domenichino had each of them painted a picture in the Church of Saint Andrew, Annibal Carrache, their maſter, was preſſed to declare, which of his two pupils had excelled. The picture of Guido repreſented Saint Andrew on his knees before the croſs, that of Domenichino repreſented the flagel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of that apoſtle. Both of them in their different kinds were capital pieces, and were painted in freſco, oppoſite each other, to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize, as it were, their rivalſhip and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0376800400:97"/>
Guido, ſaid Carrache, has performed as a maſter, and Domenichino as a ſcholar. But, added he, the worth of the ſcholar is more valuable than that of the maſter. In truth, one may perceive faults in the picture of Domenichino that Guido has avoided; but then there are noble ſtrokes, not to be found in that of his rival. It was eaſy to diſcern a genius that promiſed to produce beauties, to which the ſweet, the gentle, and the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Guido would never aſpire.</p>
            <p>The laſt piece that belongs to this Section, is the ODE entitled, THE DYING CHRISTIAN TO HIS SOUL, written in imitation of the well known ſonnet of Hadrian, addreſt to his departing ſpirit; concerning which it was our author's judicious opinion, that the dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive epithets with which it abounds, ſuch as Vagula, Blandula, were by no means expreſſions of levity and indifference, but rather of endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of tenderneſs and concern.

            <p>I AM ſenſible of the difficulty of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing reſemblances from thefts; and of what a late critic has urged, that a want of ſeeming originality ariſes frequently, not from a barrenneſs and timidity of genius, but from invincible neceſſity, and the nature of things: that the works of thoſe who profeſs an art, whoſe eſſence is imitation, muſt needs be ſtamped with a cloſe reſemblance to each other, ſince the objects material or animate, extraneous or internal, which they all imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, lie equally open to the obſervation of all, and are perfectly ſimilar. Deſcriptions there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that are faithful and juſt, MUST BE UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORM AND ALIKE; the firſt copier may be perhaps entitled to the praiſe of priority, but a ſucceeding one ought not certainly to be condemned for plagiariſm.</p>
            <p>THESE general obſervations however true, do not, I think, extend to the caſe before us, becauſe not only the thoughts, but even the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0376800400:101"/>
words are copied; and becauſe the images, eſpecially the laſt, are ſuch, as are not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately impreſſed by ſenſible objects, and which therefore, on account of their SINGU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LARITY, did not lie in common for any poet to ſeize. Let us however moderate the matter, and ſay, what perhaps is the real fact, that POPE fell into the thoughts of Flatman una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares, and without deſign; and having for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly read him, imperceptibly adopted this paſſage, even without knowing that he had borrowed it. That this will frequently hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, is evident from the following curious particulars related by Menage, <note n="*" place="bottom">Anti-baillet. tom. II. 208.</note> which, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe much has been ſaid of late on this head by many writers of criticiſm, I ſhall here inſert. <q rend="inline">"I have often heard M.

without knowing it was in Malherbe; and the moment I am making this remark, recollect
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0376800400:102"/>

            <p>GODEAU had inſerted them in an ode to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Richleiu, fifteen years before Polyeucte was written.

merely coarſe brick, he leaves magnificent marble. Thoſe who flattered themſelves, that they ſhould diminiſh the reputation of Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leau, by printing, in the manner of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary at the bottom of each page of his works, the many lines he has borrowed from Horace and Juvenal, were groſsly deceived. The verſes of the ancients, which this poet hath turned into French with ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, and which he hath happily made ſo homogeneous, and of a piece with the reſt of the work, that every thing ſeems to have been conceived in a continued train of thought, by the very ſame perſon, confer as much honour on M.

            <head>SECT. III. Of the ESSAY on Criticiſm.</head>
            <p>WE are now arrived at a poem of that ſpecies, for which our author's ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius was particularly turned, the DIDACTIC and the MORAL; it is therefore, as might be expected, a maſter-piece in its kind. I have been ſometimes inclined to think, that the praiſes Addiſon has beſtowed on it, <note n="*" place="bottom">Spectator, N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 253.</note> were a little partial and invidious. <q rend="inline">"The obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſays he, follow one another, like thoſe in Horace's Art of Poetry, without that methodical regularity which would have been requiſite in a proſe writer."</q> It is however certain, that the poem before us is by no means deſtitute of a juſt integrity, and a lucid order: each of the precepts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks naturally introduce the ſucceeding ones, ſo as to form an entire whole. The ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Mr. Hurd, hath alſo uſefully ſhewn, that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0376800400:112"/>
Horace obſerved a ſtrict method, and unity of deſign, in his epiſtle to the Piſones, and that altho the connexions are delicately fine and almoſt imperceptible, like the ſecret hinges of a well-wrought box, yet they art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and cloſely unite each part together, and give coherence, uniformity, and beauty to the work. The Spectator adds; <q rend="inline">"The ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations in this eſſay are <hi>ſome</hi> of them <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common;</hi>"</q> there is, I fear, a ſmall mixture of ill-nature in theſe words; for this ESSAY tho' on a beaten ſubject, abounds in many new remarks, and original rules, as well as in many happy and beautiful illuſtrations, and applications of the old ones. We are indeed amazed to find ſuch a knowledge of the world, ſuch a maturity of judgment, and ſuch a penetration into human nature, as are here diſplayed, in ſo very young a writer as was POPE, when he produced this ESSAY; for he was not twenty years old. Correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and a juſt taſte, are uſually not attained but by long practice and experience in any art; but a clear head, and ſtrong ſenſe were
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0376800400:113"/>
the characteriſtical qualities of our author, and every man ſooneſt diſplays his radical excellencies. If his predominant talent be warmth and vigor of imagination, it will break out in fanciful and luxuriant deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the colouring of which will perhaps be too rich and glowing. If his chief force lies in the underſtanding rather than in the imagination, it will ſoon appear by ſolid and manly obſervations on life or learning, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in a more chaſt and ſubdued ſtyle. The former will frequently be hurried into obſcurity or turgidity, and a falſe grandeur of diction; the latter will ſeldom hazard a figure, whoſe uſage is not already eſtabliſhed, or an image beyond common life; will always be perſpicuous if not elevated; will never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, if not tranſport his readers; will avoid the groſſer faults, if not arrive at the greater beauties of compoſition; The <q rend="inline">"eloquentiae genus,"</q> for which he will be diſtinguiſhed, will not be the <q rend="inline">"plenum, &amp; erectum, &amp; audax, &amp; praecultum,"</q> but the <q rend="inline">"preſſum,

               </q> In the earlieſt letters of POPE to Wycherly, to Walſh, and Cromwell, we find many admirable and acute judgments of men and books, and an intimate acquaintance not only with ſome of the beſt Greek and Roman, particularly the latter, but the moſt celebrated of the French and Italian claſſics.</p>
            <p>DU BOS <note n="†" place="bottom">Sect. x. 2.</note> fixes the period of time, at which, generally ſpeaking, the poets and the painters have arrived at as high a pitch of perfection, as their geniuſes will permit, to be the age of thirty years, or a few years more or leſs. Virgil was near thirty when he compoſed his firſt Eclogue; Horace was a grown man when he began to be talked of at Rome as a poet, having been formerly engaged in a buſy military life. Racine was about the ſame age when his ANDROMACHE, which may be regarded as his firſt good tragedy, was played. Corneille was more than thirty
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0376800400:115"/>
when his CID appeared. Deſpreaux was full thirty when he publiſhed his ſatires, ſuch as we now have them; Moliere was full forty when he wrote the firſt of thoſe comedies, on which his reputation is founded. But to excell in this ſpecies of compoſition, it was not ſufficient for Moliere to be only a great poet; but it was more neceſſary for him to gain a thorough knowledge of men and the world, which is ſeldom attained ſo early in life, but without which, the beſt poet would be able to write but very indifferent comedies. Raphael was about thirty years old alſo, when he diſplayed the beauty and ſublimity of his genius in the Vatican. For it is there we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the firſt of his works, that are worthy the great name he at preſent ſo deſervedly poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes. When our Shakeſpear wrote his LEAR, Milton his PARADISE LOST, Spenſer his FAIRY QUEEN, and Dryden his MUSIC ODE, they were all of them paſt the middle age of man. From this ſhort review it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that few poets ripened ſo early as POPE; who ſeems literally and ſtrictly to have
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0376800400:116"/>
fulfilled the precept of Horace in each of it's circumſtances;
<q>

theſe are the two temptations to which a youthful bard is principally ſubject, and into whoſe ſnares he generally falls. If the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination be lively, the paſſions will be ſtrong. True genius ſeldom reſides in a cold and phleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic conſtitution. The ſame temperament, and the ſame ſenſibility that makes a poet or a painter, will be apt to make a man a lover and a debauchee. POPE was happily ſecured from falling into theſe common failings, the bane of ſo many others, by the weakneſs and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0376800400:117"/>
delicacy of his body, and the bad ſtate of his health. The ſenſual vices were too violent for ſo tender a frame; he never fell into intemperance and diſſipation. May I add, that even his bodily make was of uſe to him as a writer; for one who was acquainted with the heart of man, and the ſecret ſprings of our actions, has obſerved with great penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; <q rend="inline">"<note n="*" place="bottom">Bacon's Eſſays. 44.</note>It is good to conſider deformity, not as a ſigne, which is more deceivable, but as a cauſe, which ſeldom faileth of the effect.

It is ſomewhere remarked by Dryden, I think, that none but a poet is qualified to judge of a poet. The maxim is however contradicted by experience. Ariſtotle is ſaid indeed to have written one ode; but neither Boſſu nor Hurd, are poets. The penetrating author of the Reflexions on Poetry, Painting, and Muſic, will for ever be read with delight, and with profit by all ingenious artiſts; il ne ſavait pourtant pas la muſique, ſays Voltaire, <note n="*" place="bottom">Louis 14. p. 354.</note> il n'avoit jamais pu faire de vers, &amp; n'avoit pas un tableau: mais il avoit beaucoup lû, vû, entendû, &amp; reflechi. And Lord Shafteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury ſpeaks with ſome indignation on this ſubject; if a muſician performs his part well in the hardeſt ſymphonies, he muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily know the notes, and underſtand the rules of harmony and muſic. But muſt a man, therefore, who has an ear, and has ſtudied the rules of muſic, of neceſſity have a voice or hand? can no one poſſibly judge a <hi>fiddle,</hi> but who is himſelf a fidler? can no
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0376800400:125"/>
one judge a picture, but who is himſelf a layer of colours? <note n="‡" place="bottom">Characteriſtics. v. 3. p. 190.</note> Quintilian and Pliny, who ſpeak of the works of the ancient pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and ſtatuaries, with ſo much taſte and ſentiment, handled not themſelves either the pencil or the chiſſel, nor Longinus nor Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius, the harp. But altho' ſuch as have actually performed nothing in the art itſelf, may not on that account, be totally diſquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied to judge with accuracy of any piece of workmanſhip, yet perhaps a judgment will come with more authority and force from an artiſt himſelf. Hence the connoiſſeurs highly prize the treatiſe of Rubens, concerning the imitation of antique ſtatues, the art of paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Leonardo da Vinci, and the lives of the painters by Vaſari. As for the ſame rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Rameau's diſſertation on the thorough baſs, and the introduction to a good taſte in muſic by the excellent, but neglected, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniani, demand a particular regard.

if he did not ſo frequently contradict himſelf, and advance opinions diametrically oppoſite to each other. Some of Corneille's diſcourſes on his own tragedies are admirably juſt.

                  <p> I hardly believe there is in any language a metaphor more appoſitely applied, or more elegantly expreſſed, than this of the effects of the warmth of fancy. Locke who has embelliſhed his dry ſubject with a vaſt variety of pleaſing ſimilitudes and alluſions, has a paſſage relating to the retentiveneſs of the memory ſo very like this before us, and ſo happily worded, that I cannot forbear giving the reader the pleaſure of comparing them together; only premiſing that theſe two paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages

Heemſkirk and Teniers could not ſucceed in a ſerious and ſublime ſubject of hiſtory-painting. The latter, it is well known, deſigned cartoons for tapeſtry, repreſenting the hiſtory of the Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riani of Lombardy. Both the compoſition and
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0376800400:133"/>
the expreſſion are extremely indifferent; and ſome nicer virtuoſi have remarked, that in the ſerious pieces, into which Hogarth has deviated from the natural biaſs of his genius, there are ſome ſtrokes of the Ridiculous di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcernible, which ſuit not with the dignity of his ſubject. In his PREACHING OF St. PAUL, a dog ſnarling at a cat; and in his PHARAOH's DAUGHTER, the figure of the infant Moſes, who expreſſes rather archneſs than timidity, are alleged as inſtances, that this artiſt, unrivalled in his own walk, could not reſiſt the impulſe of his imagination to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards drollery. His picture, however, of Richard III. is pure and unmixed with any ridiculous circumſtances, and ſtrongly impreſſes terror and amazement. The mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty and good ſenſe of the ancients is, in this particular, as in others, remarkable. The ſame writer never preſumed to undertake more than one kind of dramatic poetry, if we except the CYCLOPS of Euripides. A poet never preſumed to plead in public, or to write hiſtory, or indeed any conſiderable
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0376800400:134"/>
work in proſe. The ſame actors never reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted tragedy and comedy; this was obſerved ſo long ago, as by Plato, in the third book of his REPUBLIC. They ſeem to have held that diverſity, nay univerſality, of excellence, at which the moderns frequently aim, to be a gift unattainable by man. We therefore of Great-Britain have perhaps more reaſon to congratulate ourſelves, on two very ſingular phenomena; I mean, Shakeſpear's being able to pourtray characters ſo very different as FALSTAFF, and MACKBETH; and Garrick's being able to perſonate ſo inimitably a LEAR, or an ABEL DRUGGER. Nothing can more fully demonſtrate the extent and verſatility of theſe two original geniuſes. Corneille, whom the French are ſo fond of oppoſing to Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpear, produced very contemptible comedies; and the PLAIDEURS of Racine is ſo cloſe a reſemblance of Ariſtophanes, as it ought not to be here urged. The moſt univerſal of authors ſeems to be Voltaire; who has writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten almoſt equally well, both in proſe and verſe; and whom either the tragedy of ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROPE,

I ſhall give the reader a paſſage that relates to the origin of criticiſm, which is curious and juſt. <q rend="inline">"When the perſuaſive arts, which were neceſſary to be cultivated among a people that were to be convinced before they acted, were grown thus into repute; and the power of moving the affections become the ſtudy and emulation of the forward wits and aſpiring geniuſes of the times; it would neceſſarily happen, that many geniuſes of equal ſize and ſtrength, though leſs covetous of public ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe, of power, or of influence over man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, would content themſelves with the contemplation merely of theſe enchanting arts. Theſe they would the better enjoy, the more

they refined their taſte, and cultivated their ear.—Hence was the origin of CRITICS; who, as arts and ſciences advanced, would neceſſarily come withal into repute; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heard with ſatisfaction in their turn, were at length tempted to become authors, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in public. Theſe were honoured with the name of Sophiſts; a character which in early times was highly reſpected. Nor did the graveſt philoſophers, who were cenſors of manners, and critics of a higher degree, diſdain to exert their criticiſm on the inferior arts; eſpecially in thoſe relating to ſpeech, and the power of argument and perſuaſion. When ſuch a race as this was once riſen, 'twas no longer poſſible to impoſe on mankind, by what was ſpecious and pretending. The pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic would be paid in no falſe wit, or jingling eloquence. Where the learned critics were ſo well received, and philoſophers themſelves diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained not to be of the number; there could not fail to ariſe critics of an inferior order, who would ſubdivide the ſeveral provinces of this empire."<note n="*" place="bottom">Characteriſtics, vol.

Homer and the Greek tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedians have been likewiſe cenſured, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer for protracting the Iliad after the death of Hector; and the latter, for continuing the AJAX and PHOENISSAE, after the deaths of their reſpective heroes. But the cenſurers did not conſider the importance of burial among
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0376800400:144"/>
the ancients: and that the action of the Iliad would have been imperfect without a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the funeral rites for Hector and Patroclus; as the two tragedies, without thoſe of Polynices and Eteocles: for the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients eſteemed a deprivation of ſepulture to be a more ſevere calamity than death itſelf.

Let him have a care of that, ſaid Don Quixote interrupting him, that is the beſt part of the plot. But Sir, quoth the Batchelor, if you would have me adhere to Ariſtotle's rules, I muſt omit the combat. Ariſtotle, replied the Knight, I grant was a man of ſome parts; but his capacity was not unbounded: and give me leave to tell you, his authority does not extend over combats in the liſt, which are far above his narrow rules. Would you ſuffer the chaſte Queen of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia to periſh? For how can you clear her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence? Believe me, COMBAT is the moſt honourable method you can purſue; and, beſides, it will add ſuch grace to your play, that all the rules in the univerſe muſt not ſtand in competition with it. Well, Sir Knight, replied the Batchelor, for your ſake, and for
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0376800400:157"/>
the honour of chivalry, I will not leave out the combat: and that it may appear the more glorious, all the court of Bohemia ſhall be preſent at it, from the princes of the blood, to the very footmen. But ſtill one difficulty remains, which is, that our common theatres are not large enough for it. There muſt be one erected on purpoſe, anſwered the Knight; and, in a word, rather than leave out the combat, the play had better be acted in a field or plain."<note n="*" place="bottom">Continuation of Hiſt. of Don Quixote, b. iii. ch. 10.</note>

                  <p>THE arts uſed by Addiſon to ſuppreſs the riſing merit of POPE, which are now fully laid open, give one pain to behold, to what mean artifices envy and malignity will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel a gentleman and a genius to deſcend. It is certain, that Addiſon diſcouraged POPE from inſerting the machinery in the Rape of the Lock: that he privately inſinuated that POPE was a Tory and a Jacobite; and had a hand in writing the Examiners: that Addiſon himſelf tranſlated the firſt book of Homer, publiſhed under Tickel's name: and that he ſecretly encouraged Gildon to abuſe POPE in a virulent pamphlet, for which Addiſon paid Gildon ten guineas. This uſage extorted from POPE the famous character of Atticus,

which is perhaps the fineſt piece of ſatire extant. It is ſaid, that when Racine read his tragedy of Alexander to Corneille, the latter gave him many general commendations, but adviſed him to apply his genius, as not being adapted to the drama, to ſome other ſpecies of poetry. Corneille, one would hope, was incapable of a mean jealouſy, and if he gave this advice, thought it really proper to be given.</p>

Under the notion of laughing at the abſurd auſterities of the Puritans, it became the mode to run into the contrary extreme, and to ridicule real religion and unaffected virtue. The King, during his exile, had ſeen and admired the ſplendor of the court of Louis XIV. and endeavoured to introduce the ſame luxury into the Engliſh court. The
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0376800400:172"/>
common opinion, that this was the Auguſtan age in England, is exceſſively falſe. A juſt taſte was by no means yet formed. What was called SHEER WIT, was alone ſtudied and applauded. Rocheſter, it is ſaid, had no idea that there could be a better poet than Cowley. The King was perpetually quoting HUDIBRAS. The neglect of ſuch a poem as the Paradiſe Loſt, will for ever remain a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the bad taſte that prevailed. It may be added, that the progreſs of philological learning, and of what is called the belle lettres, was perhaps obſtructed by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the Royal Society; which turned the thoughts of men of genius to phyſical enquiries. Our ſtyle in proſe was but begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to be poliſhed: although the diction of Hobbes is ſufficiently pure; which philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, and not the FLORID Spratt, was the claſſic of that age.

                        <p>The names of Corneille and Racine being often mentioned in this work, it will not be improper to add an ingenious Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel of their reſpective merits, written by Fontenelle.</p> 
                        <list>
                           <item>I. Corneille had no excellent author before his eyes, whom he could
follow: Racine had Corneille.</item>
                           <item>II. Corneille found the French ſtage in a barbarous ſtate, and
advanced it to great perfection: Racine has not ſupported it in the
perfection in which he found it.</item>
                           <item>III. The characters of Corneille are true, though they are not common:
The characters of Racine are not true, but only ſo far forth as they are
common.</item>
                           <item>IV. Sometimes the characters of Corneille, are, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
falſe and unnatural, in that they are noble and ſingular: Thoſe of Racine
are often, in ſome reſpects, low, on account of their being natural and
ordinary.</item>
                           <item>V. He that has a noble heart would chuſe to reſemble the heroes of
Corneille: He that has a little heart is pleaſed to find his own
reſemblance in the heroes of Racine.</item>
                           <item>VI. We carry, from hearing the pieces of the One, a deſire to be
virtuous: And we carry the pleaſure of finding men like ourſelves in
foibles and weakneſſes, from the pieces of the Other.</item>
                           <item>VII. The Tender and the Graceful of Racine is ſometimes to be found in
Corneille: The Grand and Sublime of Corneille is never to be found in
Racine.</item>
                           <item>VIII. Racine has painted only the French and the preſent age, even when
he deſigned to paint another age, and other nations: We ſee in Corneille,
all thoſe ages and all thoſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that he intended to paint.</item>
                           <item>IX. The number of the pieces of Corneille is much greater than that of
Racine: Corneille, notwithſtanding, has made fewer tautologies and
repetitions than Racine has made.</item>
                           <item>X. In the paſſages where the verſification of Corneille is good, it
is more bold, more noble, and, at the ſame time, as pure and as finiſhed as
that of Racine; but it is not preſerved in this degree of beauty: and that of
Racine is always equally ſupported.</item>
                           <item>XI. Authors inferior to Racine have written ſucceſsfully after him,
in his own way: No author, not even Racine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, dared to attempt, after
Corneille, that kind of writing which was peculiar to him.</item>
                        </list> 
                        <p>This compariſon, of the juſtneſs of which the reader is left to judge, is ſaid greatly to have irritated Boileau, the invariable friend and defender of Racine. It may be remarked, that Boileau had mentioned Fontenelle with contempt, in a ſtanza that originally concluded his Ode to the King, at preſent omitted. Theſe were the lines. <q>
                              <l>J'aime mieux nouvel Jcare</l>

                           </q> This ode was parodied in France; but not with ſuch incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable humour, as by our Prior, in England.</p> 
                        <p>To theſe remarks of Fontenelle may be added what Voltaire ſays, with his uſual vivacity and brevity; <q rend="inline">"Corneille alone formed himſelf; but Louis XIV. Colbert, Sophocles, and Euripides, all of them contributed to form Racine."</q>
                        </p>
                     </note> author and Racine returned one day in high ſpirits from
Verſailles with two honeſt citizens of Paris. As their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation 
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0376800400:177"/> was full of gaiety and humour, the two citizens were
vaſtly delighted: and one of them, at parting, ſtopt Boileau with this
compliment, 
<q rend="inline">"I have travelled with Doctors of the Sorbonne, and even with
Religious; but I never heard ſo many fine things ſaid before; <hi>en verite
vous parlez cent fois mieux qu'un</hi> PREDICATEUR."</q>

His logic, however at preſent neglected for thoſe redundant and verboſe ſyſtems, which took their riſe from Locke's Eſſay on the Human Underſtanding, is a mighty effort of the mind: in which are diſcovered the principal ſources of the art of reaſoning, and the dependencies of one thought on another; and where, by the different combinations he hath made of all the forms
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0376800400:180"/>
the underſtanding can aſſume in reaſoning, which he hath traced for it, he hath ſo cloſely confined it, that it cannot depart from them, without arguing inconſequentially. His Phyſics contain many uſeful obſervations, particularly his Hiſtory of Animals; to aſſiſt him in which, Alexander gave orders, that creatures of different climates and countries ſhould, at a great expence, be brought to him, to paſs under his inſpection. His Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals are perhaps the pureſt ſyſtem in antiquity. His Politics are a moſt valuable monument of the civil wiſdom of the ancients; as they preſerve to us the deſcription of ſeveral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and particularly of Crete and Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage, that otherwiſe would have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known. But of all his compoſitions, his Rhetoric and Poetics are moſt complete. No writer has ſhewn a greater penetration into receſſes of the human heart, than this philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, in the ſecond book of his Rhetoric; where he treats of the different manners and paſſions, that diſtinguiſh each different age and condition of man; and from whence Horace
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0376800400:181"/>
plainly took his famous deſcription, in the Art of Poetry. <note n="*" place="bottom">Ver. 157.</note> La Bruyere, Rochefoucault, and Montaigne himſelf, are not to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to him in this reſpect. No ſucceeding writer on eloquence, not even Tully, has added any thing new or important on this ſubject. His Poetics, which I ſuppoſe are here by POPE chiefly referred to, ſeem to have been written for the uſe of that prince, with whoſe education Ariſtotle was honoured, to give him a juſt taſte in reading Homer and the tragedians: to judge properly of which, was then thought no unneceſſary accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the character of a prince. To at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to underſtand poetry without having diligently digeſted this treatiſe, would be as abſurd and impoſſible, as to pretend to a ſkill in geometry, without having ſtudied Euclid. The fourteenth, fifteenth, and ſixteenth chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, wherein he has pointed out the propereſt methods of exciting TERROR and PITY, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince us, that he was intimately acquainted with thoſe objects, which moſt forcibly affect the

The prime excellence of this precious treatiſe is the ſcholaſtic preciſion, and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical cloſeneſs, with which the ſubject is handled, without any addreſs to the paſſions, or imagination. It is to be lamented, that the part of the Poetics in which he had given precepts for comedy, did not likewiſe deſcend to poſterity.</p>

It ſeems alſo to be another common miſtake, that one of Horace's characteriſtics is the SUBLIME: of which indeed he has given a very few ſtrokes, and thoſe taken from Pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar, and, probably, from Alcaeus.

THESE proſaic lines, this ſpiritleſs elogy, are much below the merit of the critic whom they are intended to celebrate. POPE ſeems here rather to have conſidered Dionyſius, as the author only of his little Treatiſe concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Homer; and to have in ſome meaſure overlooked, or at leaſt not to have ſufficiently inſiſted on, his moſt excellent book, ΠΕΡΙ ΣΥΝΘΗΣΕΩΣ ΟΝΟΜΑΤΩΝ, in which he has unfolded all the ſecret arts that render compoſition harmonious. One part of this diſcourſe, I mean from the beginning of the twenty-firſt to the end of the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fourth Section, is perhaps one of the moſt uſeful pieces of criticiſm extant. He there diſcuſſes the three different ſpecies of compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; which he divides into the NERVOUS and AUSTERE, the SMOOTH and FLORID, and the MIDDLE, which partakes of the nature of the two others. As examples of the firſt ſpecies, he mentions Antimachus and Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>docles in heroics, Pindar in lyric, Aeſchylus in tragic poetry, and Thucydides in hiſtory. As examples of the ſecond, he produces Heſiod
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0376800400:185"/>
as a writer in heroics; Sappho, Anacreon, and Simonides, in lyric; Euripides ONLY, among tragic writers; among the hiſtorians, Ephorus, and Theopompus; and Iſocrates among the rhetoricians: all theſe, ſays he, have uſed words that are ΛΕΙΑ, χαι ΜΑΛΑΚΑ, χαι ΠΑΡΘΕΝΩΠΑ. The writers which he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges as inſtances of the third ſpecies, who have happily blended the two other ſpecies of compoſition, and who are the moſt complete models of ſtyle, are Homer, in epic poetry; Steſichorus and Alcaeus in lyric; in tragic, Sophocles; in hiſtory, Herodotus; in elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, Demoſthenes; in philoſophy, Demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critus, Plato, and Ariſtotle.</p>

TO commend Quintilian barely for his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, and to inſiſt merely on this excellence, is below the merit of one of the moſt rational and elegant of Roman writers. Conſidering the nature of Quintilian's ſubject, he afforded copious matter, for a more appropriated and poetical character. No author ever adorned a ſcientifical treatiſe with ſo many beautiful metaphors. Quintilian was found in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of a tower of the monaſtery of St. Gal, by Poggius; as appears by one of his letters dated 1417, written from Conſtance, when the council was then ſitting.

The taſte and ſenſibility of Longinus were exquiſite, but his obſervations are too general, and his method too looſe.

Inſtead of pointing out the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the grandeur of Homer's imagery, where he deſcribes the motion of Neptune, the critic is endeavouring to rival the poet, by ſaying that, <q rend="inline">"there was not room enough in the whole earth, to take ſuch another ſtep."</q> He ſhould have ſhewn why the ſpeech of Phaeton to his ſon, in a fragment of Euripides, was ſo lively and pictureſque: in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of which, he ardently exclaims, <q rend="inline">"would not you ſay, that the ſoul of the writer aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended the chariot with the driver, and waS whirled along in the ſame flight and danger with the rapid horſes?"</q> We have lately

A work of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, and of humour directed to expoſe the prieſts, in that age, was indeed a prodigy. The irony of the Encomium on Folly has never been excelled. Eraſmus, though a commentator, had taſte; and though a catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, had charity. His learning was enlivened with wit; and his orthodoxy was tempered with moderation. He was never dazzled with what was called ERUDITION; or miſled by that blind and undiſtinguiſhing veneration which was naturally paid to the antients, on the firſt diſcovery of their writings. By his CICERONIANUS, he repreſſed the affectation of imitating Tully's manner of expreſſion, in
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0376800400:197"/>
every ſpecies of compoſition. In his ECCLE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIASTES, very excellent rules are laid down for preaching. In his DIALOGUES, the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions of the Romiſh church are expoſed with all the pleaſantry of Lucian: an author, to whom his genius bore great reſemblance; and ſome of whoſe dialogues he has tranſlated with their original ſpirit. Indeed, among the many tranſlators of Greek authors who flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed at that time, Eraſmus ſeems to have been in all reſpects the moſt eminent. To him was the reſtoration of literature princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally owing. More than one prince ſollicited his friendſhip, and invited him to their courts. We ſee in a letter of Eraſmus, written in the year 1516, that Francis I. who ſhared with Leo X. the glory of reviving ſciences and arts in Europe, having declared to Petit his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, that he intended to bring into France the moſt learned men he could find, Petit had charged Budaeus, and Cop the royal phyſician, to write to Eraſmus, to engage him to ſettle in France: that Stephen Poncher, embaſſador from the king at Bruſſels, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed

The FIRST, is the age of Philip and Alexander; about which time flouriſhed Socrates, Plato, Demoſthenes, Ariſtotle, Lyſippus, Apelles, Phidias, Prax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iteles, Thucydides, Xenophon, Aeſchylus, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ripides, Sophocles, Ariſtophanes, Menander,

Philemon. The SECOND age, which has ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver yet been ſufficiently taken notice of, was that of Ptolomy Philadelphus, king of Aegypt; in which appeared Lycophron, Aratus, Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cander, Apollonius Rhodius, Theocritus, Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limachus, Eratoſthenes, Philichus, Eriſiſtratus the phyſician, Timaeus the hiſtorian, Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thes, Diogenes the painter, and Soſtrates the architect. This prince, from his love of learning, commanded the Old Teſtament to be tranſlated into Greek. The THIRD age is that of Julius Caeſar, and Auguſtus; marked with the illuſtrious names of Laberius, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus, Lucretius, Cicero, Livy, Varro, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil, Horace, Propertius, Tibullus, Ovid, Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drus, Vitruvius, Dioſcorides.

                  <p>CONCERNING the particular encouragement given by Leo X. to polite literature, and the fine arts, I forbear to enlarge; becauſe a friend of mine is at preſent engaged in writing, THE HISTORY OF THE AGE OF LEO X. It is a noble period, and full of thoſe moſt important events, which have had the greateſt influence on human affairs. Such as the diſcovery of the Weſt-Indies, by the Spaniards, and of a paſſage to the Eaſt, by the Portugueze; the invention of printing; the reformation of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; with many others: all which will be

inſiſted upon at large, and their conſequences diſplayed. I ſhall only here tranſiently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that ſome efforts to emerge from bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity had long before this time appeared in Italy.

A Tuſcan, called Guy of Arezzo, invented the muſical notes in uſe at preſent: and Bruneleſchi built palaces at Florence, in the ſtyle of ancient architecture.

The piece is, indeed, of the ſatyric, rather than of the preceptive, kind.

                  <p>AN ESSAY on Tranſlated Verſe ſeems at firſt ſight to be a barren ſubject; yet Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common has decorated it with may precepts of utility and taſte, and enlivened it with a tale in imitation of Boileau. It is indiſputably better written than the laſt-mentioned ESSAY. Roſcommon was more learned than Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham. He was bred under Bochart at Caen in Normandy. He had laid a deſign of forming a ſociety for the refining, and fixing the ſtandard of, our language: in which project, his intimate friend Dryden was a principal aſſiſtant. This was the firſt attempt of that ſort; and, I fear, we ſhall never ſee

another ſet on foot in our days: even though Mr. Johnſon has lately given us ſo excellent a dictionary. It may be remarked to the praiſe of Roſcommon, that he was the firſt critic who had taſte and ſpirit enough, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly to praiſe the Paradiſe Loſt; with a noble encomium of which, and a rational recommendation of blank verſe, he concludes his performance.

                  <p>IF POPE has here given too magnificent an elogy to Walſh, it muſt pardonably be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to friendſhip, rather than to judgment. Walſh was in general a flimzy and frigid writer. The Rambler calls his works PAGES OF INANITY. His three letters to POPE, however, are well written. His remarks on the nature of paſtoral poetry, on borrowing from the ancients, and againſt florid conceits, are worthy peruſal<note n="†" place="bottom">Vol. 7. pag. 65, &amp;c.</note>. POPE owed much to Walſh: it was he who gave him a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant piece of advice, in his early youth; for he uſed to tell our author, that there was one way ſtill left open for him, by which he might excell any of his predeceſſors, which was, by CORRECTNESS; that though indeed we had ſeveral great poets, we as yet could boaſt of none that were perfectly CORRECT; and that therefore, he adviſed him to make this quality his particular ſtudy.</p>

                     <pb n="202" facs="tcp:0376800400:213"/>
CORRECTNESS is a vague term, frequently uſed without meaning and preciſion. It is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually the nauſeous cant of the French cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, and of their advocates and pupils, that the Engliſh writers are generally INCORRECT. If CORRECTNESS implies an abſence of petty faults, this perhaps may be granted. If it means, that becauſe their tragedians have avoided the irregularities of Shakeſpeare, and have obſerved a juſter oeconomy in their fables, that therefore the Athalia, for inſtance, is preferable to Lear, the notion is groundleſs and abſurd. The Henriade is free from any very groſs faults; but who will dare to rank it with the Paradiſe Loſt? The declamations with which ſome of their moſt perfect trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies abound, may be reckoned as contrary to the nature of that ſpecies of poetry, and as deſtructive of it's end, as the fools or grave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diggers of Shakeſpeare. That the French may boaſt ſome excellent critics, particularly, Boſſu, Boileau, Fenelon, and Brumoy, cannot be denied; but that they are ſufficient to form a taſte upon, without having recourſe to the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0376800400:214"/>
genuine fountains of all polite literature, I mean the Grecian writers, no one but a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial ſcioliſt can allow.</p>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p>I CONCLUDE theſe reflections with a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fact. In no poliſhed nation, after criticiſm has been much ſtudied, and the rules of wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting eſtabliſhed, has any very extraordinary work ever appeared. This has viſibly been the caſe, in Greece, in Rome, and in France, after Ariſtotle, Horace, and Boileau, had writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten their ARTS OF POETRY. In our own country, the rules of the drama, for inſtance, were never more completely underſtood than at preſent: yet what UNINTERESTING, though FAULTLESS, tragedies, have we lately ſeen? So much better is our judgment than our exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. How to account for the fact here mentioned, adequately and juſtly, would be attended with all thoſe difficulties that await diſcuſſions relative to the productions of the human mind, and to the delicate and ſecret cauſes that influence them. Whether or no, the natural powers be not confined and debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litated
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0376800400:215"/>
by that timidity and caution which is occaſioned by a regard to the dictates of art: or whether, that philoſophical, that geome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trical, and ſyſtematical ſpirit ſo much in vogue, which has ſpread itſelf from the ſciences even into polite literature, by conſulting only REASON, has not diminiſhed and deſtroyed SENTIMENT; and made our poets write from and to the HEAD rather than the HEART: or whether, laſtly, when juſt models, from which the rules have neceſſarily been drawn, have once appeared, ſucceeding writers, by ambitiouſly endeavouring to ſurpaſs thoſe juſt models, and to be original and new, do not become diſtorted and unnatural, in their thoughts and diction.</p>

            <p>IF the Moderns have excelled the Ancients in any ſpecies of writing, it ſeems to be in ſatire: and, particularly in that kind of ſatire, which is conveyed in the form of the epopee, a pleaſing vehicle of ſatire never uſed by the ancients. As the poet diſappears in this way of writing, and does not deliver the intended cenſure in his own proper perſon, the ſatire becomes more delicate, becauſe more oblique. Add to this, that a tale or ſtory more ſtrongly engages and intereſts the reader, than a ſeries of precepts or reproofs, or even of characters themſelves, however lively and natural. An heroi-comic poem may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be juſtly eſteemed the moſt excellent kind of ſatire.</p>
            <p>THE invention of it is uſually aſcribed to Aleſſandro Taſſoni; who in the year 1622, publiſhed at Paris, a poem compoſed by him,
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0376800400:217"/>
in a few months of the year 1611, entitled LA SECCHIA RAPITA, or <hi>The Rape of the Bucket.</hi> To avoid giving offence, it was firſt printed under the name of Androvini Meliſoni. It was afterwards reprinted at Venice, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, with the name of the author, and with ſome illuſtrations of Gaſparo Salviani. But the learned and curious Creſcembini, in his <hi>Iſtoria della Volgar Poeſia,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Lib. i. pag. 78. In Roma, per il Chracas, 1698.</note> informs us, that it is doubtful whether the invention of the <note n="†" place="bottom">E tal Poeſia puo diffinirſi, e chiamarſi, immitazione d'azione ſeria fatto con riſo. Creſcembini, ibid.</note> heroi-comic poem ought to be aſcribed to Taſſoni, or to Franceſco Bracciolini, who wrote LO SCHERNO DE GLI DEI, which perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, though it was printed four years after LA SECCHIA, is nevertheleſs declared in an epiſtle prefixed, to have been written many years ſooner. The real ſubject of Taſſoni's poem, was the war which the inhabitants of Modena declared againſt thoſe of Bologna, on the refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of the latter to reſtore to them ſome towns, which had been detained ever ſince the time
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0376800400:218"/>
of the emperor Frederic II. The author artfully made uſe of a popular tradition, according to which it was believed, that a certain woodden bucket, which is kept at Modena in the treaſury of the cathedral, came from Bologna, and that it had been forcibly taken away by the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſe. Creſcembini adds, that becauſe Taſſoni had ſeverely ridiculed the Bologneſe, Barto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomeo Bocchini, to revenge his countrymen, printed at Venice MDCXLI, a tragico-heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comic poem, entitled LE PAZZIE DE SAVI, <hi>overo,</hi> IL LAMBERTACCIO, in which the Modeneſe are ſpoken of with much contempt. The Italians have a fine turn for works of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, in which they abound. They have another poem of this ſpecies, called MAL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MANTILE RACQUISTATO, written by Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renzo Lippi, in the year MDCLXXVI, which Creſcembini<note n="*" place="bottom">Pag. 368. lib. 5.</note> highly commends, calling it, <q rend="inline">"Spiritoſiſimo e legiadriſſimo poema gia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſo."</q> It was afterwards reprinted at Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence MDCLXXXVIII, with the uſeful anno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations

            <p>THE LUTRIN of Boileau was the ſecond remarkable poem, in which the Serious and Comic were happily blended. Boileau him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has given a circumſtantial account of what gave occaſion to this poem; which account, becauſe it is entertaining, and not printed in the common editions of his works, I will inſert at length. <q rend="inline">"I ſhall not here act like Arioſto, who frequently when he is going to relate the moſt abſurd ſtory in the world, ſolemnly proteſts it to be true, and ſupports it by the authority of archbiſhop Turpin. For my part I freely declare, the whole poem of the DESK is nothing but pure fiction; that it is all invented, even to the name itſelf of the place where the action paſſes. An odd occaſion gave riſe to this poem. In a company I was lately engaged in, the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation turned upon epic poetry: every one delivered his opinion, according to his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; when mine was aſked, I confirmed
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0376800400:220"/>
what I had advanced in my Art of Poetry, that an heroic poem, to be truly excellent, ought to be charged with little MATTER, which it was the buſineſs of invention to ſupport and extend. The opinion was warmly conteſted: but after many reaſons for and againſt, it happened, as it generally does in this ſort of diſputes, that nobody was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and that each continued in his own opinion. The heat of diſpute being over, we talked on other ſubjects; and laughed at the violence into which we had been betrayed, in diſcuſſing a queſtion of ſo little conſequence. We moralized on the folly of men who paſs almoſt their whole lives, in treating the greateſt trifles in a ſerious manner, and in making to themſelves an important affair of ſomething quite indifferent. To this purpoſe, a country gentleman related a famous quarrel, that had lately happened in a little church in his province, between the treaſurer and the chantor, the two principal dignitaries of that church, about the place in which a reading<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſk was to ſtand. We thought it a droll
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0376800400:221"/>
affair. Upon this, one of the critics in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, who could not ſo ſoon forget our late diſpute, aſked me, if I, who thought ſo little MATTER neceſſary for an heroic poem, would undertake to write one on a quarrel ſo little abounding in incidents, as this of the two eccleſiaſtics. <q rend="inline">"J'eus plutôt dit, pourquoi non? que je n'eus fait reflexion ſur ce qu'il me demandoit."</q> This made the company laugh, and I could not help laughing with them; not in the leaſt imagining, that I ſhould ever be able to keep my word. But finding myſelf at leiſure in the evening, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved the ſubject in my mind, and having conſidered in every view the pleaſantry that it would admit of, I made twenty verſes which I ſhewed to my friends. They were diverted with this beginning. The pleaſure which I ſaw theſe gave them, induced me to write twenty more. Thus, from twenty verſes to twenty, I lengthened the work to near nine hundred. This is the whole hiſtory of the trifle I now offer to the public.—This is a new kind of burleſque, which I have intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0376800400:222"/>
into our language: for, as in the other kind of burleſque, that of Scarron, Dido and Aeneas ſpoke like fiſh-women and porters, in this of mine, a <note n="*" place="bottom">Altered afterwards to a Barber.</note> clock-maker and his wife talk like Dido and Aeneas. I do not know whether my poem will have all the qualities requiſite to ſatisfy a reader: but I dare flatter myſelf, that it will at leaſt be allowed to have the grace of novelty; becauſe I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that there are any works of this nature in our language; the DEFAITES DES BOUTS RIMES of Saraſin being rather a mere allegory than a poem, as this is."</q>

            <p>HIS knowledge of the rents of his church, and of the mortgages belonging to it, his ſcorn of the pious and laborious Arnauld, his contempt of learning, and, above all, his ruling paſſion of good-eating, are ſtrokes high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly comic. It is wonderful the eccleſiaſtics of France were not as much irritated by the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the LUTRIN, as by the TARTUFFE of Moliere; which was ſuppreſſed by their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, after it had been acted a few nights: although at the ſame time, a very profane farce was permitted to have a long run. When Louis XIV. expreſſed to the Prince of Condè, his wonder at the different fates of theſe two pieces, and aſked the reaſon of it, the prince anſwered,

            <p>BOILEAU has raiſed his ſubjects by many perſonifications; particularly, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſixth canto, PIETY who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to the great Carthuſian monaſtery on the Alps, is introduced as repairing to Paris, accompanied by FAITH, HOPE, and CHA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RITY, in order to make her complaint to THEMIS: to which may be added, the mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous figure of CHICANERY, attended by FAMINE, WANT, SORROW, and RUIN, in the beginning of the fifth canto. The chief divinity that acts throughout the poem, is DISCORD; which goddeſs is repreſented as coming from a convent of Cordeliers. A fine ſtroke of ſatire; but imitated from the ſatyrical Arioſto, who makes Michael find DISCORD in a cloiſter, inſtead of SILENCE, whom he there ſearched for in vain. NIGHT is alſo introduced as an actreſs with great propriety, in the third canto; where ſhe repairs to the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0376800400:227"/>
famous old tower at Montlery, in order to find out an owl which ſhe may convey into the DESK, and which afterwards produces ſo ridiculous a conſternation. SLOTH is another principal perſonage: ſhe alſo is diſcovered in the dormitory of a monaſtery.<q>

<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0376800400:230"/>
occaſioned by a little piece of gallantry of Lord Petre, who, in a party of pleaſure, found means to cut off a favorite lock of Mrs. Arabella Fermour's hair. POPE was deſired to write it, in order to put an end to the quarrel it produced, by Mr. Caryl, who had been ſecretary to queen Mary, author of Sir Solomon Single a comedy, and of ſome tranſlations in Dryden's Miſcellanies. POPE was accuſtomed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"What I wrote faſteſt always pleaſed moſt."</q> The firſt ſketch of this exquiſite piece, which Addiſon called MERUM SAL, was written in leſs than a fortnight, in two cantos only: but it was ſo univerſally applauded, that, in the next year, our poet enriched it with the machinery of the ſylphs, and extended it to five cantos; when it was printed with a letter to Mrs. Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, far ſuperior to any of Voiture. The inſertion of the machinery of the ſylphs in proper places, without the leaſt appearance of it's being aukwardly ſtitched in, is one of the happieſt efforts of judgment and art. He took the idea of theſe inviſible beings, ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0376800400:231"/>
to be employed in a poem of this nature, from a little french book entitled, Le Comte de Gabalis, of which I have lately met with an account, in an entertaining writer. <q rend="inline">"The Abbe Villars, who came from Thoulouſe to Paris, to make his fortune by preaching, is the author of this diverting work. The five dialogues of which it conſiſts, are the reſult of thoſe gay converſations, in which the Abbe was engaged á la porte de Richelieu, with a ſet of men, of fine wit and humour, like himſelf. When this book firſt appeared, it was univerſally read, as innocent and amuſing. But at length, it's conſequences were perceived, and reckoned dangerous, at a time when this ſort of curioſities began to gain credit. Our devout preacher was denied the chair, and his book forbidden to be read. It was not clear whether the author intended to be ironical, or ſpoke all ſeriouſly. The ſecond volume which he promiſed, would have decided the que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion: but the unfortunate Abbe was ſoon after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards aſſaſſinated by ruffians, on the road to Lyons. The laughers gave out, that the
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0376800400:232"/>
gnomes and ſylphs, diſguiſed like ruffians, had ſhot him, as a puniſhment for revealing the ſecrets of the Cabala; a crime not to be pardoned by theſe jealous ſpirits, as Villars himſelf has declared in his book<note n="*" place="bottom">Melanges d'Hiſtoire et de Literature.

The Comte de Gabalis being about to initiate his pupils into the moſt profound myſteries of the Roſicruſian philoſophy, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſes him to conſider ſeriouſly, whether or no he had courage and reſolution ſufficient to RENOUNCE all thoſe obſtacles, which might prevent his ariſing to that height, which the figure of his nativity promiſed. <q rend="inline">"Le mot de RENONCER, ſays the ſcholar, m'effraya, et je ne doutay point qu'il n'allaſt me propoſer de renoncer au bapteſme ou au paradis.

            <p>THESE machines are vaſtly ſuperior to the allegorical perſonages of Boileau and Garth; not only on account of their novelty, but for the exquiſite poetry, and oblique ſatire, which
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0376800400:234"/>
they have given the poet an opportunity to diſplay. The buſineſs and petty concerns of a fine lady, receive an air of importance from the notion of their being perpetually over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked and conducted, by the interpoſition of celeſtial agents.</p>
            <p>IT is judicious to open the poem, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing the Guardian Sylph, warning Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linda againſt ſome ſecret impending danger. The account which Ariel <note n="*" place="bottom">Cant. 1. ver. 27. to ver. 119.</note> gives of the nature, office, and employment of theſe inhabitants of air, is finely fancied: into which ſeveral ſtrokes of ſatire are thrown with great delicacy and addreſs.<q>

               </q> If Virgil has merited ſuch perpetual commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for exalting his bees, by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and magnificence of his diction, does not POPE deſerve equal praiſes, for the pomp and luſtre of his language, on ſo trivial a ſubject?</p>
            <p>THE ſame maſtery of language, appears in the lively and elegant deſcription of the game at Ombre; which is certainly imitated from the Scacchia of Vida, and as certainly equal to it, if not ſuperiour. Both of them have elevated and enlivened their ſubjects, by ſuch ſimiles as the epic poets uſe; but as cheſs is a play of a far higher order than Ombre,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0376800400:244"/>
POPE had a more difficult taſk than Vida, to raiſe this his inferior ſubject, into equal dignity and gracefulneſs. Here again our poet artfully introduces his machinery:<q>
                  <l>Soon as ſhe ſpreads her hand, th'aërial guard</l>

               </q> The majeſty with which the kings of ſpades and clubs, and the knaves of diamonds and clubs, are ſpoken of, is very amuſing to the imagination: and the whole game is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted with great art and judgment. I queſtion whether Hoyle could have played it better than Belinda. It is finely contrived that ſhe ſhould be victorious; as it occaſions a change of fortune in the dreadful loſs ſhe was ſpeedily to undergo, and gives occaſion to the poet to introduce a moral reflection from Virgil, which adds to the pleaſantry of the ſtory. In one of the paſſages where POPE has copied Vida, he has loſt the propriety of the original,

THE chief ſubject of the fifth and laſt canto, is the battle that enſues, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours of the ladies to recover the hair.

The weapons made uſe of are the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per imaginable: the lightening of the ladies eyes, intolerable frowns, a pinch of ſnuff, and a bodkin. The machinery is not forgot:

Boileau and Garth have alſo each of them enlivened their pieces with a mock-fight. But Boileau has laid the ſcene of his action in a bookſeller's ſhop; where the combatants happen to encounter each other by chance. This conduct is a little inartificial; but has
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0376800400:253"/>
given the ſatyriſt an opportunity of indulging his ruling paſſion, the expoſing the bad poets, with which France at that time abounded. Swift's Battle of the Books, at the end of the Tale of a Tub, is evidently taken from this <note n="*" place="bottom">Chant. 5.</note> battle of Boileau, which is excellent in its kind. The fight of the phyſicians, in the Diſpenſary, is one of its moſt ſhining parts. There is a vaſt deal of propriety, as well as pleaſantry, in the weapons Garth has given to his warriours. They are armed, much in character, with cauſtics, emetics, and cathar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics; with buckthorn, and ſteel-pills; with ſyringes, bed-pans and urinals. The execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is exactly proportioned to the deadlineſs of ſuch irreſiſtible weapons; and the wounds inflicted, are ſuitable to the nature of each different inſtrument, ſaid to inflict them. <note n="†" place="bottom">Cant. 5.</note>

            <p>WE are now arrived to the grand cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe of the poem; the invaluable Lock which is ſo eagerly ſought, is irrecoverably loſt! And here our poet has made a judicious
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0376800400:254"/>
uſe of that celebrated fiction of Arioſto; that all things loſt on earth are treaſured in the moon. How ſuch a fiction can have place in an epic poem, it becomes the defenders of this extravagant and lawleſs rhapſodiſt to juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify; but in a comic one, it appears with grace and conſiſtency. The whole paſſage in Arioſto is full of wit and ſatire; for wit and ſatire were the chief and characteriſtical excellencies of Arioſto<note n="*" place="bottom">For the beſt and moſt judicious account I know of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of Arioſto, ſee Warton's OBSERVATIONS on the FAIRY QUEEN of Spenſer.

               </q> It is very remarkable, that the poet had the boldneſs to place among theſe imaginary trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0376800400:255"/>
the famous deed of gift of Conſtantine to Pope Silveſter, <q rend="inline">"If, ſays he, I may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to ſay this,"</q>

It may be obſerved in general, to the honour of the poets, both ancient and modern, that they have ever been ſome of the firſt, who have detected and oppoſed the falſe claims, and miſchievous uſurpations, of ſuperſtition and ſlavery. Nor can this be wondered at, ſince theſe two are the greateſt enemies, not only to all true happineſs, but to all true genius.</p>
            <p>THE denouement, as a pedantic diſciple of Boſſu would call it, of this poem, is well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted. What is become of this important LOCK OF HAIR? It is made a conſtellation with that of Berenice, ſo celebrated by Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limachus. As it riſes to heaven,
<q>
                  <l>The ſylphs behold it kindling as it flies, <note n="*" place="bottom">Cant. 5. Ver. 130.</note>

               <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0376800400:256"/>
One cannot ſufficiently applaud the art of the poet, in conſtantly keeping in the reader's view, the machinery of the poem, to the very laſt. Even when the Lock is transformed, the ſylphs, who had ſo carefully guarded it, are here once again artfully mentioned, as finally rejoicing in it's honourable transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.</p>
            <p>IN reading the Lutrin, I have always been ſtruck with the impropriety of ſo ſerious a concluſion, as Boileau has given to ſo ludi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crous a poem. PIETY and JUSTICE are beings rather too awful, to have any concern in the celebrated deſk. They appear as much out of place and ſeaſon, as would the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Paris in his pontifical robes, in an harlequin entertainment.</p>
            <p>POPE does not deſert his favorite Lock, even after it becomes a conſtellation; and the uſes he aſſigns to it are indeed admirable.<q>
                  <l>This the beau monde ſhall from the mall ſurvey,

He ſays, that in firſt reading the <hi>four</hi> celebrated mock heroic poems, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived they had all ſome radical defect. That at laſt he found by a diligent peruſal of Don Quixote, that <hi>Propriety</hi> was the fundamental excellence of that Work.

That the want of attention to this was the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental error of thoſe poems.

            <p>IF ſome of the moſt candid among the French critics begin to acknowledge, that
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:0376800400:259"/>
they have produced nothing in point of SUBLIMITY and MAJESTY equal to the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe Loſt, we may alſo venture to affirm, that in point of DELICACY, ELEGANCE, and fine-turned RAILLERY, on which they have ſo much valued themſelves, they have produced nothing equal to the RAPE OF THE LOCK.

            <p>THIS ELEGY opens with a ſtriking abrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and a ſtrong image; the poet fancies he beholds ſuddenly the phantom of his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered friend;<q>

            <p>THE PROLOGUE to <hi>Addiſon's Tragedy of Cato,</hi> is ſuperiour to any prologue of Dryden; who, notwithſtanding, is ſo juſtly celebrated for this ſpecies of writing. The prologues of Dryden are ſatyrical and facetious; this of POPE is ſolemn and ſublime, as the ſubject
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0376800400:269"/>
required. Thoſe of Dryden contain general topics of criticiſm and wit, and may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cede any play whatſoever, even tragedy or comedy. This of POPE is particular, and appropriated to the tragedy alone, which it was deſigned to introduce. The moſt ſtriking images and alluſions it contains, are taken, with judgment, from ſome paſſages in the life of Cato himſelf. Such is that fine ſtroke, more lofty than any thing in the tragedy itſelf, where the poet ſays, that when Caeſar amid the pomp and magnificence of a triumph,<q>
                  <l>Shew'd Rome her Cato's figure drawn in ſtate;</l>
                  <l>As her dead father's reverend image paſt,</l>
                  <l>The pomp was darkned and the day o'ercaſt;</l>
                  <l>The triumph ceas'd.—Tears guſh'd from ev'ry eye,</l>
                  <l>The world's great victor paſs'd unheeded by;</l>
                  <l>Her laſt good man dejected Rome ador'd,</l>
                  <l>And honour'd Caeſar's leſs than Cato's ſword.</l>
               </q> Such, again, is the happy alluſion to an old ſtory mentioned in Martial, of this ſage going into the theatre, and immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of it again:
<q>
                  <l>Such plays alone ſhould win a Britiſh ear,</l>
                  <l>As Cato's ſelf had not diſdain'd to hear:</l>
               </q>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:0376800400:270"/>
From which he draws an artful panegyric, on the purity and excellence of the play he was celebrating.</p>
            <p>WITH reſpect to ſprightly turns and poig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy of wit, the prologues of Dryden have not been equalled. The curious reader may conſult, particularly, a collection of twenty of them together, in the firſt edition of the firſt volume of Tonſon's Miſcellanies<note n="*" place="bottom">Pag. 263.</note>; many of them, and the moſt excellent, written on occaſion of the players going to Oxford; a cuſtom, for the neglect of which, no good reaſon can be aſſigned; except, perhaps, that even the players muſt now forſooth follow the contemptible cant of decrying that moſt learned univerſity, and of doing nothing that may contribute to its pleaſure and emolument. At this time Dryden was ſo famous for his prologues, that no piece was reliſhed, nor would the theatres ſcarcely venture to produce it, if it wanted this faſhionable ornament. To this purpoſe, an anecdote is recorded of
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:0376800400:271"/>
Southerne; who, on bringing his firſt play on the ſtage, did not fail to beſpeak a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue of the artiſt in vogue. The uſual price had ever been four guineas. In the preſent caſe, Dryden inſiſted that he muſt have ſix for his work; <q rend="inline">"which, ſaid the mercantile bard, is out of no diſreſpect to you, young man; but the players have had my goods too cheap."</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE tragedy of Cato itſelf, is a glaring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the force of party<note n="*" place="bottom">When Addiſon ſpoke of the ſecretary of ſtate at that time, he always called him, in the language of Shakeſpeare, <q rend="inline">"<hi>That canker'd Bolingbroke.</hi>"</q> Notwithſtanding this, Addiſon aſſured POPE he did not bring his tragedy on the ſtage with any party views; nay, deſired POPE to carry the poem to the Lords Oxford and Bolingbroke, for their peruſal. The play, however, was always conſidered as a warning to the people, that liberty was in danger during that tory miniſtry. To obviate the ſtrong impreſſions, that ſo popular a performance might make on the minds of the audience, Lord Bolingbroke, in the midſt of their violent applauſes, ſent for Booth, who played Cato, one night, into his box, between the acts, and preſented him with fifty guineas; in acknowledgment, as he expreſſed it with great addreſs, for defending the cauſe of liberty ſo well againſt a perpetual dictator.</note>; ſo heavy and declamatory a drama would never have met with ſuch rapid and amazing ſucceſs, if every
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0376800400:272"/>
line and ſentiment had not been particularly tortured, and applied, to recent events, and the reigning diſputes of the times. The purity and energy of the diction, and the loftineſs of the ſentiments, copied in a great meaſure from Lucan, Tacitus, and Seneca the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, merit approbation. But I have always thought, that thoſe pompous Roman ſentiments are not ſo difficult to be produced, as is vulgarly imagined; and which, indeed, dazzle only the vulgar. A ſtroke of nature is, in my opinion, worth a hundred ſuch thoughts, as,
<q>
                  <l>When vice prevails, and impious men bear ſway,</l>
                  <l>The poſt of honour is a private ſtation.</l>
               </q>
CATO is a fine dialogue on liberty, and the love of one's country; but conſidered as a dramatic performance, nay as a model of a juſt tragedy, as ſome have affectedly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented it, it muſt be owned to want, ACTION and PATHOS; the two hinges, I preſume, on which a juſt tragedy ought neceſſarily to turn, and without which it cannot ſubſiſt. It wants
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0376800400:273"/>
alſo CHARACTER, although that be not ſo eſſentially neceſſary to a tragedy as ACTION. Syphax, indeed, in his <note n="*" place="bottom">Act. 2. Scen. 5.</note> interview with Juba, bears ſome marks of a rough African: the ſpeeches of the reſt may be transferred to any of the perſonages concerned. The ſimile drawn from mount Atlas, and the deſcription of the Numidian traveller ſmothered in the deſart, are indeed in character, but ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently obvious. How Addiſon could fall into the falſe and unnatural cuſtom of ending his three firſt acts with ſimiles, is amazing in ſo chaſt and correct a writer. The loves of Juba and Marcia, of Portius and Lucia, are vicious and inſipid epiſodes, debaſe the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and deſtroy the unity, of the fable.</p>

boldly, perhaps, ventured to deliver on the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed</hi> poetry of Addiſon, yet muſt we candidly own, that in various parts of his proſe-eſſays, are to be found many ſtrokes of genuine and ſublime poetry; many marks of a vigorous and exuberant imagination. Particularly, in the noble allegory of Pain and Pleaſure, the Viſion of Mirza, the ſtory of Maraton and Yaratilda, of Conſtantia and Theodoſius, and the beautiful eaſtern tale of Abdallah and Balſora; and many others: together with ſeveral ſtrokes in the Eſſay on the pleaſures of imagination. It has been the lot of many great names, not to have been able to expreſs themſelves with beauty and propriety in the fetters of verſe, in their reſpective languages; who have yet manifeſted the force, fertility, and creative power of a moſt poetic genius, in proſe. <note n="*" place="bottom">In ſome of the eaſtern ſtories, lately publiſhed in the AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VENTURER, a vaſt and noble invention is diſplayed; and this too by an author, that, I have never heard, has written any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable verſes.

After all, the chief and characteriſtical excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Addiſon, was his HUMOUR; for in humour no mortal has excelled him except Moliere.

            <p>THE EPILOGUE <hi>to Jane Shore,</hi> is the laſt piece that belongs to this Section; the title of which by this time the reader may have poſſibly forgot. It is written with the air of gallantry and raillery, which, by a ſtrange perverſion of taſte, the audience expects in all epilogues to the moſt ſerious and pathetic pieces. To recommend cuckoldom and palliate adultery, is their uſual intent. I wonder Mrs. Oldfield was not ſuffered to ſpeak it; for it is ſuperiour to that which was uſed on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. In this taſte Garrick has written ſome, that abound in ſpirit and drollery. Rowe's genius <note n="*" place="bottom">There are however ſome images in Rowe ſtrongly painted, ſuch, particularly, as the following, which is worthy of Spenſer; ſpeaking of the tower.

               </note> was rather delicate and tender, than ſtrong and pathetic; his
compoſitions ſooth us with a tranquill and tender ſort of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency,
rather than cleave the heart with
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0376800400:284"/> pangs of
commiſeration. His diſtreſſes are entirely founded on the paſſion
of love. His diction is extremely elegant and chaſte, and his verſification
highly melodious. His plays are declamations, rather than dialogues, and his
characters are general, and undiſtinguiſhed from each other. Such a furious
character as that of Bajazet, is eaſily drawn; and, let me add, eaſily
acted. There is a want of unity in the fable of Tamerlane. The death's head,
dead body, and ſtage hung in mourning, in the Fair Penitent, are inartificial
and mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical methods of affecting an audience. In a word, his plays are
muſical and pleaſing poems, but inactive and unmoving trage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. This of
Jane Shore is, I think, the moſt intereſting and affecting of any he has
given us: but probability is ſadly violated in it by the neglect of the unity
of time. For a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be ſuppoſed to be ſtarved, during the
repreſentation of five acts, is a ſtriking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the abſurdity
of this violation. In this piece, as in all of Rowe's, are many florid
ſpeeches, utterly inconſiſtent with the ſtate <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0376800400:285"/>
ſituation of the diſtreſsful perſonages who ſpeak them. When Shore

Theſe few words far exceed the moſt pompous
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0376800400:287"/>
declamations of <hi>Cato.</hi> The interview betwixt Jane Shore and Alicia, in the middle of this act, is alſo very affecting: where the madneſs of Alicia is well painted. But of all repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations of madneſs, that of Clementina, in the Hiſtory of Sir Charles Grandiſon, is the moſt deeply intereſting. I know not whether even the madneſs of Lear is wrought up, and expreſſed by ſo many little ſtrokes of nature, and genuine paſſion. It is abſolute pedantry to prefer and compare, the madneſs of Oreſtes in Euripides, to this of Clementina.</p>
            <p>IT is probable, that this is become the moſt popular and pleaſing tragedy of all Rowe's works, becauſe it is founded on our own hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. It is to be wiſhed, that our writers would more frequently ſearch for ſubjects, in the annals of England, which afford many ſtriking and pathetic events, proper for the ſtage. We have been too long attached to Grecian and Roman ſtories. In truth, the DOMESTICA FACTA, are more intereſting, as well as more uſeful: more intereſting, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0376800400:288"/>
we all think ourſelves concerned in the actions and fates of our countrymen; more uſeful, becauſe the characters and manners, bid the faireſt to be true and natural, when they are drawn from models with which we are exactly acquainted. The Turks, the Perſians, and Americans, of our poets, are in reality diſtinguiſhed from Engliſhmen, only by their turbans and feathers; and think, and act, as if they were born and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated within the bills of mortality. The hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorical plays of <note n="*" place="bottom">Milton has left, in a manuſcript, thirty three ſubjects for tragedies, all taken from the Engliſh annals; which manuſcript the curious reader may ſee printed in Newton's Edit. of Milton, Oct. Vol. 3. pag. 331. And in Birch's life of Milton, prefixed to his edition of Milton's proſe-works; and in Peck's Miſcel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanea Curioſa.</note> Shakeſpeare, are always particularly grateful to the ſpectator, who loves to ſee and hear our own Harrys and Edwards, better than all the Achille'ss or Brutus's that ever exiſted. In the choice of a domeſtic ſtory, however, much judgment and circumſpection muſt be exerted, to ſelect one of a proper aera; neither of too ancient, or
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:0376800400:289"/>
of too modern a date. The manners of times very ancient, we ſhall be as apt to falſify, as thoſe of the Greeks and Romans. And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent events, with which we are thoroughly acquainted, are deprived of the power of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing ſolemnity and awe, by their notoriety and familiarity. Age ſoftens and wears away all thoſe diſgracing and depreciating circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which attend modern tranſactions, merely becauſe they are modern. Lucan was much embarraſſed by the proximity of the times he treated of. On this very ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, as well as others, the beſt tragedy that could be poſſibly written on the murder of Charles I. would be coldly received. Racine ventured to write on a recent hiſtory, in his Bajazet; but would not have attempted it, had he not thought, that the diſtance of his hero's country repaired, in ſome meaſure, the nearneſs of the time in which he lived. <q rend="inline">"Major a longinquo reverentia."</q>

ſhall I be pardoned for ſuſpecting, that POPE would not have ſucceeded
in this deſign; that ſo DIDACTIC a genius would have been deficient in that
SUBLIME and PATHETIC, which are the main nerves of the epopea; that he would
have given us many elegant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions, and many GENERAL characters, well
drawn; but would have failed to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes the REALITY of theſe
objects, and the ACTIONS of theſe characters: for Homer profeſſedly draws
no characters, but gives us to collect them from the looks and behaviour of
each perſon he introduces; that POPE's cloſe and conſtant reaſoning had
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired and cruſhed the faculty of imagination; that the political
reflections, in this piece, would, in all probability, have been more
nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous, than the affecting ſtrokes of nature; that it would have more

GIERU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SALEMME LIBERATA; that it would have appeared, (if this ſcheme had been

painting modern life, and the moſt ſecret foibles and follies of his

heroiſm, and that ſimple life, which alone epic poetry can grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
deſcribe; in a word, that this compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion would have ſhewn more of the
PHILO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SOPHER than of the POET. Add to all this, that it was to have been
written in rhyme; a circumſtance, ſufficient of itſelf alone to overwhelm
and extinguiſh all enthuſiaſm, and produce endleſs tautologies and

<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. III.</note> has informed us, namely, that POPE in

            <p>IT is not impertinent to obſerve, for the ſake of thoſe who are fond of the hiſtory, of literature, and of the human mind in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of it, that the very firſt poem that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in France, any thing like an epic poem, was on this identical ſubject, of Brutus ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving in England. It was written by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter EUSTACHE, ſo early as in the reign of Louis the ſeventh, ſirnamed the Young, who aſcended the throne in the year 1137, and who was the huſband of the celebrated Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onora, afterwards divorced, and married to our Henry the ſecond. The author called it, Le ROMAN de Brut. Every piece of poetry was at that time denominated a romance. The latin language ceaſed to be regularly ſpoken in France, about the ninth century; and was ſucceeded by what was called the <hi>Romance</hi>-tongue, a mixture of the language
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0376800400:294"/>
of the Francs, and of bad Latin. The ſpecies of writing, called <hi>Romans,</hi> began in the tenth century, according to the opinion of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedictine fathers<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt. Lit. T. 6, 7.</note>, who have well refuted, M. Fleuri and Calmet, who make them leſs ancient by two hundred years. The poem, or <hi>Roman,</hi> we are ſpeaking of, is full of won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful and improbable tales, and ſupernatural adventures, ſuited to the taſte of ſo barbarous an age. It is matter of ſome curioſity, to ſee a ſpecimen of the ſtyle of this eldeſt of the French poets. This is his exordium:<q>
                  <l>Qui veut ouir, qui veut ſcavoir,</l>
                  <l>De roi en roi, &amp; d'hoir en hoir,</l>
                  <l>Qui cils furent, &amp; d'où cils vinrent,</l>
                  <l>Qui Angleterre primes tinrent.</l>
               </q> We may judge, from this paſſage, of the ſtate of the language. Maſter Euſtache has been particularly careful to mark the time in which he lived and wrote, by his two concluding lines:
<q>
                  <l>L'an mil cent cinquante—cinq ans</l>
                  <l>Fit Maiſtre Euſtache ces Romans.</l>

I will take leave to add, that the ſecond poem now remaining in the French language, was entitled, The Romance of Alexander the Great. It was the confederated work of four authors, famous in their time. Lambert le Court, and Alexander of Paris, ſung the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits of Alexander; Peter de Saint Cloſt, wrote his will in verſe; the writing the will of a hero being then a common topic; and John le Nivelois, added a book concerning the manner in which his death was revenged. It is remarkable, that before this time, all the <hi>Romans</hi> had been compoſed in verſes of eight ſyllables: but in this piece, the four authors firſt uſed verſes of TWELVE ſyllables, as more ſolemn and majeſtic. And this was the origin, tho' but little known, of thoſe verſes, which we now call ALEXANDRINES; the French heroic meaſure: the name being derived from Alexander, the hero of the piece, or from Alexander, the moſt celebrated of the four poets concerned in this work. Theſe were the moſt applauded poets of that age. Fauchet highly commends this poem: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly

One would not imagine this line had been written, ſo early as the middle of the twelfth century. A great and truly learned anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary <note n="*" place="bottom">The preſident Henault, Hiſtoire de France. Tom. 1. p. 151. a Paris 1749.</note> has remarked, for the honour of our country, that about this time,
1160, appeared the firſt traces of any theatre. <q rend="inline">"A monk called Geoffry, who
was afterwards abbot of St. Albans in England, employed in the edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of
youth, made his pupils repreſent, with proper ſcenes and dreſſes,
tragedies of piety. The ſubject of the firſt dramatic piece, was, the
miracles of ſaint Catharine, which, ſays my author, appeared long before
any of our repreſentations of the MYSTERIES."</q>

            <p>IT is no ſmall merit in Ovid, to have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented this beautiful ſpecies of writing epiſtles under feigned characters. It is a high improvement on the Greek elegy; to which its dramatic nature renders it greatly ſuperior. It is indeed no other than a paſſionate ſolilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quy; in which, the mind gives vent to the diſtreſſes and emotions under which it la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours: but by being directed and addreſſed to a particular perſon, it gains a degree of propriety, that the beſt-conducted ſoliloquy, in a tragedy, muſt ever want. Our impatience under any preſſures of grief, and diſorder of mind, makes ſuch paſſionate expoſtulations with the perſons ſuppoſed to cauſe ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſſes, very natural. Judgment is chiefly ſhewn, by opening the intereſting complaint juſt at ſuch a period of time, as will give oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0376800400:298"/>
for the moſt tender ſentiments, and the moſt ſudden and violent turns of paſſion to be diſplayed. Ovid may, perhaps, be blamed for a ſameneſs of ſubjects, in theſe epiſtles of his heroines; whoſe diſtreſſes are almoſt all occaſioned by their lovers forſaking them. His epiſtles are likewiſe too long; which circumſtance has forced him into a repetition and languor in the ſentiments. It would be a pleaſing taſk, and conduce to the formation of a good taſte, to ſhew how differently Ovid and the Greek tragedians, have made Medea, Phaedra, and Deianira ſpeak, on the very ſame occaſions. Such a compariſon would abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly manifeſt, the FANCY and WIT of Ovid, and the JUDGMENT and NATURE of Euripides and Sophocles. If the character of Medea was not better ſupported in the tragedy, which Ovid is ſaid to have produced, and of which Quintilian ſpeaks ſo advantageouſly, than it is in her epiſtle to Jaſon, one may venture to declare, that, if this drama had ſurvived, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans would not yet have been vindicated, from their inferiority to the Greeks, in tragic poeſy.</p>

THE EPISTLE before us is tranſlated by POPE, with faithfulneſs and with elegance; and much excells any that Dryden tranſlated in the volume he publiſhed: many of which were done by ſome <q rend="inline">"of the mob of gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that wrote with eaſe;"</q> that is, Sir C. Scroop, Caryl, Pooly, Wright, Tate, Buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingham, Cooper, and other careleſs rhymers. A good tranſlation of theſe epiſtles, is as much wanted, as one of Juvenal; for, out of ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſatires of that poet, Dryden himſelf tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated but ſix. We can now boaſt of happy tranſlations in verſe, of almoſt all the great poets of antiquity; whilſt the French have been poorly contented with only proſe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Homer and Horace, which, ſays Cervantes, can no more reſemble the original, than the wrong ſide of tapeſtry can repreſent the right. The inability of the French tongue to expreſs many Greek or Roman ideas with facility and grace, is here viſible: but the Italians have Horace tranſlated by Pallavacini, Theocritus by Ricolotti, Ovid by Anguillara, the Aeneid, admirably well, in blank verſe, by

            <p>I return to Ovid, by obſerving, that he has put into the mouth of his heroine, a greater number of pretty panegyrical epigrams, than of thoſe tender and paſſionate ſentiments, which ſuited her character, and made her SENSIBILITY in amours ſo famous. What can be more elegantly gallant than this compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Phaon?
<q>
                  <l>Sume fidem &amp; pharetram; fies manifeſtus Apollo;</l>
                  <l>Accedant capiti cornua; Bacchus eris.</l>
               </q>
This thought ſeems indiſputably to have been imitated, in that moſt juſtly celebrated of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern epigrams:<q>

                  <l>Sic tu coecus AMOR, ſic erit illa VENUS.</l>
               </q> My chief reaſon for quoting theſe delicate lines, was to point out the occaſion of them, which ſeems not to be ſufficiently known.

They were made on Louis de Maguiron, the moſt beautiful man of his time, and the great favourite of Henry III. of France, who loſt an eye at the ſiege of Iſſoire; and on the Princeſs of Eboli, a great beauty, but who was deprived of the ſight of one of her eyes, and who was at the ſame time miſtreſs of Philip II. King of Spain.</p>
            <p>IT was happily imagined to write an epiſtle in the character of Sapho, who had ſpoken of the joys of love with more warmth and feeling, than any writer of antiquity; and who deſcribed the violent ſymptoms attending this paſſion, in ſo ſtrong and lively a manner, that the phyſician Eraſiſtratus, is ſaid to have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered the ſecret malady of the Prince An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiochus, who was in love with his mother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in-law Stratonice, merely by examining the ſymptoms of his patient's diſtemper by this deſcription. Addiſon has inſerted in two of his Spectators<note n="*" place="bottom">N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 223, and 229.</note>, an elegant character of this poeteſs; and has given a tranſlation of two of

her fragments, that are exquiſite in their kind: a tranſlation, which we may preſume Addiſon himſelf reviſed, and altered, for his friend Philips. As theſe two pieces are pretty well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, by being found in ſo popular a book as the Spectator, I ſhall ſay no more of them; but ſhall add two more of her fragments, which, though very ſhort, are yet highly beautiful and tender. The firſt repreſents the languor and liſtleſſneſs of a perſon deeply in love; we may ſuppoſe the fair author look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up earneſtly on her mother, caſting down the web on which ſhe was employed, and ſuddenly exclaiming;<q>

I cannot help adopting the application Addiſon has made, of his two lines of Phoedrus, to theſe remains of our poeteſs; which is perhaps one of the moſt elegant, and happy applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that ever was made from any claſſic whatever:

The verſification of this tranſlation of POPE, is, in point of melody, next to that of his paſtorals. I am of opinion, that the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing lines, in which alliteration is ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully uſed, are the moſt harmonious verſes, in our language, I mean in rhyme:
<q>
                  <l>Ye gentle gales! beneath my body blow,</l>
                  <l>And ſoftly lay me on the waves below!</l>
               </q>
The peculiar muſicalneſs of the firſt of theſe lines, in particular, ariſes principally from it's conſiſting entirely of iambic feet; which have always a ſtriking, although unperceived, effect in an Engliſh verſe. As for example;
<q>
                  <l>Yĕ gēntlĕ gāles bĕneāth my̆ bōdy̆ blōw.</l>
               </q>
Even if the laſt foot alone be an iambic, it caſts a harmony over a whole line:<note n="*" place="bottom">See WARTON on Spenſer, Sect. xi. pag. 259. &amp;c.</note>

            <p>FENTON alſo has given us a tranſlation of this epiſtle to Phaon; but it is in no reſpect equal to POPE's: he has added another, of his own invention, of Phaon to Sappho, in which the ſtory of the transformation of the former, from an old mariner to a beautiful youth, is well told. Fenton <note n="*" place="bottom">POPE highly valued him. In a letter to Gay, Vol. 8. p. 169. he ſays, <q rend="inline">"I have juſt received the news of the death of a friend, whom I eſteemed almoſt as many years as you; poor Fenton.

ſome pieces worthy notice; particularly, his Epiſtle to Southerne; the Fair Nun, imitated from Fontaine; Olivia a Character, and an Ode to Lord Gower, written in the true ſpirit of Lyric poetry, of which the following allegory is an example:<q>

FROM this EPISTLE of Sappho, I may take occaſion to obſerve, that this ſpecies of writing, beautiful as it is, has not been much cultivated among us.

POPE was a moſt excellent IMPROVER, if no great original INVENTOR; for, as we have ſeen what an elegant ſuperſtructure he has raiſed on the little dialogues of the Comte de Gabalis, ſo ſhall we perceive, in the ſequel of this Section, how finely he has worked up the hints of diſtreſs, that are ſcattered up and down in Abelard's and Eloiſa's Letters; and, in a little French <note n="*" place="bottom">Printed at the Hague, 1693.</note> hiſtory of their lives and

misfortunes, which he made great uſe of. <note n="*" place="bottom">He was born born at Palais near Nantes in Britanny, at the beginning of the twelfth century, and ſtudied at Paris under William Champeaux.</note> Abelard was reputed the moſt handſome, as well as moſt learned, man, of his time; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the kind of learning then in vogue. An old chronicle, quoted by <note n="†" place="bottom">In Hiſ. Cal. Abel. p. 1155. And the high opinion that was held of his learning, may appear from his epitaph by Pet. de Clugny. <q>

lectures from all quarters of the latin world. And his contemporary St. Bernard
relates, that he numbered among his diſciples many principal
eccleſiaſtics, and cardinals, at the court of Rome. Abelard himſelf
boaſts, that when he retired into the country, he was followed by ſuch

theology, juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, philoſophy, and the thorny paths of

by many poetical performances; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch, that he was reputed to be the
author of the famous Romance of the Roſe; which, however, was indiſputably
written by JOHN OF MEUN, a little city on the banks of the Loire, about four
leagues from Orleans; which gave occaſion to Marot to exclaim;

Paraclete was built in the pariſh of Quincey, upon the little river Arduzon,
near to Nogent, upon the Seine. Happening to be in France a few years ago, I
had the curioſity to viſit the very ſpot; which I ſurveyed with much
veneration. A lady, learned as was Eloiſa in that age, who indiſputably
underſtood the latin, greek, and hebrew tongues, was a kind of prodigy: her

<note n="*" place="bottom">Abel. Opera p. 10.</note> Abelard,

ſure, more thoroughly attached him to her. Buſſy Rabutin ſpeaks in high
terms of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, of the purity of Eloiſa's latinity: a judgment worthy
a French count! There is a force, but not an elegance in her ſtyle; which is
blemiſhed, as might be expected, by many phraſes unknown to the pure ages

After which he laments his condition in very pathetic ſtrains. The poem has been ſo little remarked on, that I ſhall take the liberty of inſerting the following paſſage in the ſpeech of Atys, which is very dramatic, full of ſpirit, and ſudden changes of paſſion.

This whole poem being of a ſtrain ſuperiour to any thing in the Roman poeſy, and more paſſionate and ſublime than any part of Virgil, and being alſo ſo much above the tender and elegant genius of Catullus, whoſe name it bears, inclines me to think it a tranſlation from ſome Grecian writer; and perhaps, if the reader will peruſe the whole, it will give him the trueſt notion of an old dithyrambic, of any poem antiquity has left us. The text is in ſome places much corrupted, but enough remains pure and intelligible to place it at the head of latin poetry, how ſtrangely ſoever it has been neglected. It ought to be obſerved, that the ſeventh, eighth, and ninth lines of this quotation, bear a wonderful reſemblance to a fine paſſage in the book of Job, Ch. 29. Ver. 6. &amp; ſeq.</note>

            <p>SHE next reminds Abelard of the ſolemnity of her taking the veil, from verſe one hundred and ſix, to one hundred and eighty four, which are highly beautiful, particularly theſe circumſtances attending the rite—

               </q> Here Eloiſa glances with great modeſty and delicacy, at the irreparable misfortune of her mutilated huſband, which however ſhe always mentions with regret. I queſtion whether it may be improper to alleviate the dryneſs of theſe critical remarks, with the following ſtory; which I wiſh had fallen into the hands of Fontaine. <q rend="inline">"The Greeks waged war upon the duke of Benevento, and made him very uneaſy. Thedbald, Marquis of Spoleto, his ally, marching to his aſſiſtance, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken ſome priſoners, ordered them to be
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:0376800400:334"/>
caſtrated, and in that condition, ſent them back to the Greek general, with orders to tell him, that he had done it to oblige the emperor, whom he knew to be a lover of eunuchs; and that he would endeavour to ſend him, in a ſhort time, a much greater number of them. The Marquis was preparing to be as good as his word, when one day a woman, whoſe huſband had been taken priſoner, came all in tears to the camp, and begged to ſpeak to Thedbald. The Marquis having aſked her the cauſe of her grief, my Lord, ſays ſhe, I wonder that ſuch a valiant hero as you ſhould trifle away your time in warring with women, when men are unable to reſiſt you. Thed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bald replied, that, ſince the days of the Ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zons, he had never heard that war had been made upon women. My Lord, anſwered the Greek woman, can a crueller be made upon us, than to deprive our huſbands of what gives us health, pleaſure, and children? When you make eunuchs of them, it is mutilating us, not them: you have lately taken away our cattle and goods, without any complaint
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0376800400:335"/>
from me: but this being an irreparable loſs to ſeveral of my neighbours, I could not avoid imploring the compaſſion of the conqueror. The whole army was ſo pleaſed with this woman's ingenuous declaration, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored her huſband to her, and all they had taken from her. As ſhe was going away, Thedbald aſked her, what ſhe would be will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould be done to her huſband, if he was found in arms again. He has eyes, ſaid ſhe, a noſe, hands, and feet: theſe are his OWN, which you may take from HIM if he deſerves it; but leave him, if you pleaſe, what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to ME."<note n="*" place="bottom">Bibliotheque Univerſelle, Tom. 11. p. 10.</note>

<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0376800400:337"/>
but have been extremely affected with awe, if not with devotion; which ought to put us on our guard, againſt the inſinuating nature of ſo pompous and alluring a religion as popery. Lord Bolingbroke being one day preſent at this ſolemnity, in the chapel at Verſailles, and ſeeing the archbiſhop of Paris elevate the hoſt, whiſpered his companion the Marquis de *****, <q rend="inline">"If I were king of France, I would always perform this ceremony myſelf."</q>
            </p>
            <p>ELOISA now acknowledges the weakneſs of her religious efforts, and gives herſelf up to the prevalence of her paſſion.<q>

               </q> Suddenly, religion ruſhes back on her mind, and ſhe exclaims eagerly,<q>

                  <l>Forget, renounce me, hate whate'er was mine.</l>
               </q> This change is judicious and moving. And the following invocation to hope, faith, and chriſtian grace, to come and take full poſſeſſion of her ſoul, is ſolemn, and ſuited to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of her mind; for it ſeems to be the poet's intention to ſhew the force of religion over paſſion at laſt, and to repreſent her as a little calm and reſigned to her deſtiny, and way of life. To fix her in which holy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, the circumſtance that follows may be ſuppoſed to contribute. For ſhe relates an incident to Abelard, which had made a very deep impreſſion on her mind, and cannot fail of making an equal one, on the mind of thoſe readers, who can reliſh true poetry, and ſtrong imagery. The ſcene ſhe paints is aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful: ſhe repreſents herſelf lying on a tomb,
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0376800400:339"/>
and thinking ſhe heard ſome <note n="*" place="bottom">V. 308.</note> ſpirit calling to her in every low wind,—<q>
                  <l>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Virgil may however have given the

                  <l>Come ſiſter come, (if ſaid, or ſeem'd to ſay)</l>
                  <l>Thy place is here, ſad ſiſter, come away!</l>
                  <l>Once like thyſelf I trembled, wept and pray'd,
 <note n="§" place="bottom">It is well contrived, that this inviſible
ſpeaker, ſhould be a perſon that had been under the very ſame kind of
misfortunes with Eloiſa.</note>
                  </l>
                  <l>Love's victim then, but now a ſainted maid.</l>
               </q> This ſcene would make a fine ſubject for the pencil; and is worthy a capital painter. He might place Eloiſa in the long ile of a great Gothic church; a lamp ſhould hang over her head, whoſe dim and diſmal ray ſhould afford only light enough to make darkneſs viſible. She herſelf ſhould be repreſented in the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant,</hi> when ſhe firſt hears this aërial voice, and in the attitude of <hi>ſtarting round</hi> with aſtoniſhment and fear. And this was the
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0376800400:340"/>
method a very great maſter took, <hi>to paint a ſound,</hi> if I may be allowed the expreſſion. This ſubject was the baptiſm of Jeſus Chriſt; and in order to bring into this ſubject the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable incident of the voice from heaven, which cried aloud, <q rend="inline">"This is my beloved ſon,"</q> he repreſented all the aſſembly that attended on the banks of Jordan, gazing up into heaven, with the utmoſt ardor of amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>AT this call of a ſiſter in misfortune, who had been viſited with a ſad ſimilitude of griefs with her own, Eloiſa breaks out in a religious tranſport,<q>
                  <l>I come, I come! prepare your roſeate bow'rs,</l>
                  <l>Coeleſtial palms, and ever-blooming flow'rs;</l>
                  <l>Thither where <hi>ſinners</hi> may have reſt I go!</l>
               </q> She then calls on Abelard, to pay her the laſt ſad offices; and to be preſent with her in the article of death,
<q>
                  <l>See my lips tremble, and my eyeballs roll—</l>
               </q>
And then a circumſtance of perſonal fondneſs intervenes,
<q>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0376800400:341"/>

                     <hi>Suck</hi> my laſt breath, and catch the flying ſoul!</l>
               </q>
But ſhe inſtantly corrects herſelf, and would have her Abelard attend her at theſe laſt ſolemn moments, only as a devout prieſt, and not as a fond lover. The image, in which ſhe repreſents him coming to adminiſter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme unction, is ſtriking and pictureſque;<q>

                  <l>The hallow'd taper <note n="*" place="bottom">The words printed in Italics,

                  <l>Teach me at once, and learn of me, to die!</l>
               </q> She adds, that it will be <hi>ſome</hi> conſolation to behold him once more, tho' even in the ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of death,
<q>
                  <l>Ah then! thy once-lov'd Eloiſa ſee!</l>

               </q>
Which laſt line I could never read without great emotion; it is at once ſo pathetic, and ſo artfully points back to the whole train and nature of their misfortunes. The cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0376800400:342"/>
ſhe wiſhes may attend the death of Abelard, are poetically imagined, and are alſo agreeable to the notions of myſtic devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The death of St. Jerome is finely pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by DOMENICHINO, with ſuch attendant particulars.<q>
                  <l>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">V. 340.</note> In trance ecſtatic may thy pangs

                  <l>From opening ſkies may ſtreaming glories ſhine,</l>
                  <l>And ſaints embrace thee with a love like mine.</l>

                  <l>And graft my love immortal on thy fame!</l>
               </q> This wiſh was fulfilled. The body of Abe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard, who died twenty years before Eloiſa, was ſent to Eloiſa, who interred it in the mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Paraclete, and it was accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with a very extraordinary form of Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, from the famous Peter de Clugny; <q rend="inline">"Ego Petrus Cluniacenſis abbas, qui Petrum Abelardum in monachum Cluniacenſem re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepi, &amp; corpus ejus furtim delatum Heloiſſae Abbatiſſae, &amp; monialibus Paracleti conceſſi,

In certain ages, opinions have prevailed, for which no ſolid reaſon can be given."</q> When Eloiſa died in 1163, ſhe was interred by the ſide of her beloved huſband: I muſt not forget to mention, for the ſake of thoſe who are fond of miracles, that when ſhe was put into the grave, Abelard ſtretched out his arms to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive her, and cloſely embraced her.</p>
            <p>ELOISA, at the concluſion of the EPISTLE to which we are now arrived, is judiciouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as gradually ſettling into a tranquillity of mind, and ſeemingly reconciled to her fate. She can bear to ſpeak of their being buried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without violent emotions. Two lovers are introduced as viſiting their celebrated
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0376800400:344"/>
tombs, and the behaviour of theſe ſtrangers is finely imagined;<q>
                  <l>

Hoſannas riſe,</l>

                  <l>One human tear ſhall drop—and be forgiv'n!</l>
               </q> With this line, in my opinion, the poem ſhould have ended, for the eight additional ones, concerning ſome poet, that haply might ariſe to ſing their misfortunes, are languid and flat, and diminiſh the pathos of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going ſentiments. They might ſtand for the concluſion of almoſt any ſtory.</p>
            <p>THIS EPISTLE, is, on the whole, one of the moſt highly finiſhed, and certainly the moſt intereſting, of the pieces of our author; and, together with the ELEGY to the Memory of an Unfortunate Lady, is the only inſtance of the Pathetic POPE has given us. I think
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0376800400:345"/>
one may venture to remark, that the reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of POPE, as a poet, among poſterity, will be principally owing to his WINDSOR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FOREST, his RAPE OF THE LOCK, and his ELOISA TO ABELARD; whilſt the facts and characters alluded to and expoſed, in his later writings, will be forgotten and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, and their poignancy and propriety little reliſhed. For WIT and SATIRE are tranſitory and periſhable, but NATURE and PASSION are eternal.</p>
