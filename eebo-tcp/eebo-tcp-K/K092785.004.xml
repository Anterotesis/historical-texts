            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <l>O Say, thou dear poſſeſſor of my breaſt,</l>
               <l>Where now's my boaſted liberty and reſt!</l>
               <l>Where the gay moments which I once have known,</l>
               <l>O where that heart I fondly thought my own!</l>
               <l>From place to place I ſolitary roam,</l>
               <l>Abroad uneaſy, nor content at home.</l>
               <l>I ſcorn the beauties common eyes adore,</l>
               <l>The more I view them, feel thy worth the more;</l>
               <l>Unmov'd I hear them ſpeak, or ſee them fair,</l>
               <l>And only think on thee—who art not there.</l>
               <l>In vain would books their formal ſuccour lend,</l>
               <l>Nor wit, nor wiſdom can relieve their friend;</l>
               <l>Wit can't deceive the pain I now endure,</l>
               <l>And wiſdom ſhows the ill without the cure.</l>

When from thy ſight I waſte the tedious day,</l>
               <l>A thouſand ſchemes I form, and things to ſay;</l>
               <l>But when thy preſence gives the time I ſeek,</l>
               <l>My heart's ſo full, I wiſh, but cannot ſpeak.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And cou'd I ſpeak with eloquence and eaſe,</l>
               <l>Till now not ſtudious of the art to pleaſe,</l>
               <l>Cou'd I, at woman who ſo oft exclaim,</l>
               <l>Expoſe (nor bluſh) thy triumph and my ſhame,</l>
               <l>Abjure thoſe maxims I ſo lately priz'd,</l>

               <l>And thou reveng'd the wrongs of womankind:</l>
               <l>Loſt were my words, and fruitleſs all my pain,</l>
               <l>In vain to tell thee all I write in vain;</l>
               <l>My humble ſighs ſhall only reach thy ears,</l>
               <l>And all my eloquence ſhall be my tears.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>And now (for more I never muſt pretend)</l>
               <l>Hear me not as thy lover, but thy friend;</l>
               <l>Thouſands will fain thy little heart enſnare,</l>
               <l>For without danger none like thee are fair;</l>
               <l>But wiſely chuſe who beſt deſerves thy flame,</l>
               <l>So ſhall the choice itſelf become thy fame;</l>
               <l>Nor yet deſpiſe, tho' void of winning art,</l>
               <l>The plain and honeſt courtſhip of the heart:</l>
               <l>The ſkilful tongue in love's perſuaſive lore,</l>
               <l>Tho' leſs it feels, will pleaſe and flatter more,</l>
               <l>And meanly learned in that guilty trade</l>
               <l>Can long abuſe a fond, unthinking maid.</l>

No ſaffron robe for us the godhead wears,</l>
               <l>His torch inverted, and his face in tears.</l>
               <l>Though ev'ry ſofter wiſh were amply crown'd,</l>
               <l>Love ſoon wou'd ceaſe to ſmile where Fortune frown'd;</l>

            <l>All other means to free them both were vain.</l>

            <l>Even now whilſt I write, time ſteals on our youth,</l>
            <l>And a moment's cut off from thy friendſhip and truth:</l>
            <l>Then ſeize the ſwift bleſſing, enjoy the dear now,</l>
            <l>And take, not expect, what hereafter'll beſtow.</l>

            <l>WHAT ſhall I ſay to fix thy wav'ring mind,</l>

            <l>What weight of argument can turn the ſcale,</l>
            <l>If interceſſion from a lover fail?</l>
            <l>By what ſhall I conjure thee to obey</l>

            <l>That paſſion burns which once thy vows profeſs'd;</l>
            <l>If abſence has not chill'd the languid flame,</l>

            <l>The dictates of thy fond conſenting ſoul;</l>
            <l>By no vain ſcruple be thy purpoſe ſway'd,</l>
            <l>And only Love implicitly obey'd:</l>
            <l>Let inclination this debate decide,</l>
            <l>Nor be thy prudence, but thy heart thy guide:</l>
            <l>But real prudence never can oppoſe</l>
            <l>What Love ſuggeſts, and Gratitude avows:</l>
            <l>The warm dear raptures which thy boſom move,</l>
            <l>'Tis virtue to indulge, 'tis wiſdom to improve:</l>

How onward ſtill the ſtream of pleaſure flows!</l>
            <l>That no reflux the rapid current knows!</l>
            <l>Not ev'n thy charms can bribe the ruthleſs hand</l>
            <l>Of rigid Time, to ſtay his ebbing ſand;</l>
            <l>Fair as thou art, that beauty muſt decay;</l>
            <l>The night of age ſucceeds the brighteſt day:</l>

            <l>Thoſe eyes, thoſe meaning miniſters of Love,</l>
            <l>Who, what thy lips can only utter, prove;</l>
            <l>Theſe muſt reſign their luſtre, thoſe their bloom,</l>
            <l>And find with meaner charms one common doom:</l>

            <l>Yet ſhall the ſtream of years abate that fire,</l>
            <l>And cold eſteem ſucceed to warm deſire:</l>
            <l>Then on thy breaſt unraptur'd ſhall I dwell,</l>
            <l>Nor feel a joy beyond what I can tell:</l>
            <l>Or ſay, ſhould ſickneſs antedate that woe,</l>
            <l>And intercept what Time would elſe allow;</l>
            <l>If Pain ſhould pall my taſte to all thy charms,</l>
            <l>Or Death himſelf ſhould tear me from thy arms;</l>
            <l>How would'ſt thou then regret with fruitleſs truth,</l>

            <l>When firſt ſurrender'd to theſe eager arms,</l>
            <l>When firſt admitted to that heav'n, thy breaſt,</l>

            <l>When on thy boſom quite entranc'd I lay,</l>

            <l>Whilſt half reluctant you, and half reſign'd,</l>

               <l>Nor glory in my reputation,</l>
               <l>Am come without an invitation.</l>
               <l>And tho' I'm us'd to right Falernian,</l>
               <l>I'll deign for once to taſte Iernian;</l>

My coat of pureſt Turkey-red,</l>

               <l>To which, I've ſure as good pretenſions,</l>

            <l>IS it to me, this ſad lamenting ſtrain?</l>
            <l>Are heaven's choiceſt gifts beſtow'd in vain?</l>
            <l>A plenteous fortune, and a beauteous bride,</l>
            <l>Your love rewarded, gratify'd your pride:</l>
            <l>Yet leaving her—'tis me that you purſue,</l>
            <l>Without one ſingle charm, but being new.</l>
            <l>How vile is man! how I deteſt their ways</l>
            <l>Of artful falſehood, and deſigning praiſe!</l>
            <l>Taſteleſs, an eaſy happineſs you ſlight,</l>
            <l>Ruin your joy, and miſchief your delight.</l>
            <l>Why ſhould poor pug (the mimic of your kind)</l>
            <l>Wear a rough chain, and be to box confin'd?</l>
            <l>Some cup, perhaps, he breaks, or tears a fan,—</l>
            <l>While roves unpuniſh'd the deſtroyer, man.</l>
            <l>Not bound by vows, and unreſtrain'd by ſhame,</l>
            <l>In ſport you break the heart, and rend the fame.</l>
            <l>Not that your art can be ſucceſsful here,</l>

Nor ſighs, nor charms, nor flatteries can move,</l>
            <l>Too well ſecur'd againſt a ſecond love.</l>
            <l>Once, and but once, that devil charm'd my mind;</l>
            <l>To reaſon deaf, to obſervation blind;</l>
            <l>I idly hop'd (what cannot love perſuade!)</l>
            <l>My fondneſs equal'd, and my love repay'd;</l>
            <l>Slow to diſtruſt, and willing to believe,</l>
            <l>Long huſh'd my doubts, and did myſelf deceive:</l>
            <l>But, oh! too ſoon—this tale would ever laſt;</l>
            <l>Sleep, ſleep, my wrongs, and let me think 'em paſt.</l>
            <l>For you, who mourn with counterfeited grief,</l>
            <l>And aſk ſo boldly like a begging thief,</l>
            <l>May ſoon ſome other nymph inflict the pain,</l>
            <l>You know ſo well with cruel art to feign.</l>
            <l>Tho' long you ſported have with Cupid's dart,</l>
            <l>You may ſee eyes, and you may feel a heart.</l>
            <l>So the briſk wits, who ſtop the evening coach,</l>
            <l>Laugh at the fear that follows their approach;</l>
            <l>With idle mirth, and haughty ſcorn deſpiſe</l>
            <l>The paſſenger's pale cheek, and ſtaring eyes:</l>
            <l>But ſeiz'd by Juſtice, find a fright no jeſt,</l>
            <l>And all the terror doubled in their breaſt.</l>

               <l>The ſafe retreat of every lurking mouſe;</l>

               <l>THE winds were loud, the clouds deep-hung;</l>
               <l>And dragg'd their ſweepy trains along</l>
               <l>The dreary mountain's ſide;</l>
               <l>When, from the hill, one look to throw</l>
               <l>On Towy's rambling flood below,</l>
               <l>I turn'd my horſe—and ſigh'd.</l>

               <l>Flew thick acroſs the darken'd vale,</l>
               <l>And blurr'd the face of day:</l>
               <l>Forlorn and ſad, I jogg'd along;</l>
               <l>And tho' Tom cry'd, "You're going wrong,"</l>
               <l>Still wander'd from my way.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>The ſcenes, which once my fancy took,</l>
               <l>And my aw'd mind with wonder ſtruck,</l>
               <l>Paſs'd unregarded, all!</l>
               <l>Nor black Trecarris' ſteepy height,</l>
               <l>Nor waſte Trecaſtle gave delight;</l>
               <l>Nor clamorous Hondy's fall.</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Did the bleak day then give me pain?</l>
               <l>The driving ſnow, or pelting rain,</l>
               <l>Or ſky with tempeſts fraught?</l>
               <l>No! theſe unheeded rag'd around:</l>
