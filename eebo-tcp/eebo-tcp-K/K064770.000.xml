            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I Cou'd not, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Violence to my Self, forbear upon this Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, to give ſome publick Teſtimony of the Great and Well-grounded Eſteem
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0548400800:3"/>
I have conceiv'd for You, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince I had the Honour and Happineſs of Your Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance. The outward Advantages of Fortune, and the early Honours with which You are Adorn'd, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Reputation You are known to have, amongſt the Beſt and moſt Conſiderable Men, may well imprint Veneration and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem, on the Minds of thoſe who behold You from a Diſtance. But theſe are not the chief Motives, that Inſpire me with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect I bear You. A nearer Approach has given me the View of ſomething in Your Perſon, infinitely beyond
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0548400800:4"/>
the External Ornaments of Honour and Eſtate. I mean, an Intrinſic Stock of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and good Senſe, a True Concern for Religion, and diſintereſted Love of Your Country. Add to theſe an uncommon proficiency in the beſt, and moſt uſeful Parts of Knowledge; toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with (what in my Mind is a Perfection of the firſt Rank) a ſurpaſſing Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Nature. All which I have Collected, not from the uncertain Reports of Fame but, from my own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. Within theſe few Months, that I have the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be known unto You, the many delightful Hours
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0548400800:5"/>
I have paſs'd in Your Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and Improving Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, have afforded me the opportunity of Diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering in You many Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Qualities, which at once fill me with Admiration and Eſteem. That one at thoſe Years, and in thoſe Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Wealth and Greatneſs, ſhou'd continue Proof againſt the Charms of Luxury, and thoſe Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal Pleaſures, ſo faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and predominant in the Age we live in. That He ſhou'd preſerve a ſweet and modeſt Behaviour, free from that inſolent and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Air, ſo familiar to thoſe who are placed above
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0548400800:6"/>
the ordinary Rank of Men. That He ſhou'd manage a great Fortune with that Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Inſpection, and at the ſame time, expend it with that Generoſity and Nobleneſs of Mind, as to ſhew Himſelf equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, from a ſordid Parſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, and a laviſh, incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderate Profuſion of the good Things He is intruſted with. This, ſurely, were Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable and Praiſe worthy. But that He ſhou'd moreo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver by an impartial Exerciſe of His Reaſon, and conſtant Peruſal of the Sacred Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, endeavour to attain a right Notion of the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Natural and Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0548400800:7"/>
Religion. That He ſhou'd with the Concern of a true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triot have the Intereſt of the Publick at Heart, and omit no means of Informing Himſelf what may be Prejudicial, or Advantageous to his Country, in order to prevent the one, and promote the other. In fine, that by a conſtant Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the moſt ſevere and uſeful Studies, by a ſtrict Obſervation of the Rules of Honour and Vertue, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and ſerious Reflections on the miſtaken Meaſures of the World, and the true End and Happineſs of Mankind, He ſhou'd in all reſpects qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify Himſelf, bravely to run the Race that is ſet before Him, to
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0548400800:8"/>
deſerve the Character of <hi>Great</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> in this Life, and be ever Happy hereafter. This were amazing, and almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible. Yet all this, and more than this, SIR, might I juſtly ſay of you; did either your Modeſty permit, or your Character ſtand in Need of it. I know it might deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly be thought a Vanity in me, to imagine that any thing coming from ſo obſcure a Hand as mine, cou'd add a luſtre to your Reputation. But I am withal ſenſible, How far I advance the Intereſt of my own, by laying hold on this Opportunity to make it known, that I am admitted into ſome degree of Intimacy, with a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0548400800:9"/>
of Your Exquiſite Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And with that View, I have ventur'd to make You an Addreſs of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which, the Goodneſs I have ever experienced in You inclines me to hope, will meet with a favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Reception at Your Hands. Tho' I muſt own, I have Your Pardon to ask, for touching on what may, poſſibly, be Offenſive to a Vertue You are poſſeſt of in a very diſtinguiſhing Degree. Excuſe me, SIR, if it was out of my Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to mention the Name of SIR JOHN PERCIVALE, without paying ſome Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to that Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

and ſurpriſing Merit, whereof I have ſo lively and affecting an <hi>Idea,</hi> and which, I am ſure, cannot be expos'd in too full a light for the Imitation of Others. Of late, I have been agreeably imploy'd in conſidering the moſt No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Pleaſant, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive of all the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The fruit of that (La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour ſhall I call it or) Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion is what I now Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent You with, in Hopes it may give ſome Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to one who, in the midſt of Buſineſs and Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Enjoyments, preſerves a Reliſh for the more Refin'd
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0548400800:11"/>
Pleaſures of Thought and Reflexion. My Thoughts concerning <hi>Viſion</hi> have led me into ſome Notions, ſo far out of the common Road, that it had been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper to Addreſs them to one of a narrow and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted <hi>Genius.</hi> But You, SIR, being Maſter of a large and free Underſtanding, rais'd above the Power of thoſe Prejudices that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave the far greater Part of Mankind, may deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly be thought a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Patron for an Attempt of this Kind. Add to this, that You are no leſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to Forgive, than qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lify'd
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0548400800:12"/>
to diſcern, whatever Faults may occur in it. Nor do I think You defective in any one Point neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to form an Exact Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the moſt abſtract and difficult Things, ſo much as in a juſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of Your own A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities. And in this one Inſtance, give me leave to ſay, You ſhew a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt weakneſs of Judgment. With Relation to the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>Eſſay,</hi> I ſhall only add, that I beg Your Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don for laying a Trifle of that Nature in your Way, at a time when you are engag'd in the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0548400800:13"/>

And, methinks, I had better ſay nothing at all, than repeat that which has been ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſaid by others. I think it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore high time to take my leave of this Subject. But before I quit it for good and all, the fair and ingenuous Dealing that I owe both to You and to Truth, obliges me to acquaint you with a certain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toward Difficulty, which ſeems di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly oppoſite to the Doctrine I
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0548400800:48"/>
have been hitherto inculcating, at leaſt, admits of no Solution from it. In ſhort it is this. <figure/> Before the double Convex Glaſs or Concave <hi>Speculum</hi> EBF, let the Point A be placed, at ſuch a Diſtance that the Rays proceeding from A, after Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraction or Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, be brought to Unite ſomewhere in the Ax AB. And ſuppoſe the Point of Union (<hi>i. e.</hi> the Image of the Point A, as hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſet forth) to be Z; between which and B, the <hi>Vertex</hi> of the Glaſs or <hi>Speculum,</hi> conceive the Eye to be any where placed. The Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on now is, Where the Point A ought to appear. Experience ſhews that it doth not appear behind at the Point Z, and it were contrary
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0548400800:49"/>
to Nature that it ſhou'd; ſince all the Impreſſion which affects the Senſe comes from towards A. But from our Tenents it ſhou'd ſeem to follow, that it wou'd appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Eye at a vaſt Diſtance off, ſo great as ſhou'd in ſome Sort, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs all ſenſible Diſtance. For ſince if we exclude all Anticipations and Prejudices, every <hi>Object</hi> appears by ſo much the farther off, by how much the Rays it ſends to the Eye are leſs Diverging. And that <hi>Object</hi> is thought to be moſt remote, from which Parallel Rays proceed unto the Eye. Reaſon wou'd make one think, that <hi>Object</hi> ſhou'd appear, at yet a greater Diſtance, which is ſeen by converging Rays. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over it may in general be asked con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Caſe, what it is that determines the apparent Place of the Point A, and maketh it to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear after a conſtant manner, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times nearer, at other times farther off? To which doubt, I ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0548400800:50"/>
that can be anſwer'd agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the Principles we have laid down, except only that the Point A ought always to appear extreamly remote. But on the contrary, we are aſſur'd by Experience that the Point A appears variouſly Diſtant, according to the different Situations of the Eye between the Points B and Z. And that it doth almoſt never (if at all) ſeem farther off, than it wou'd if it were beheld by the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked Eye, but on the contrary, it doth ſometimes appear much near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Nay, it is even certain, that by how much the Rays falling on the Eye do more converge, by ſo much the nearer does the <hi>Object</hi> ſeem to approach. For the Eye being placed cloſe to the Point B, the <hi>Object</hi> A appears nearly in it's own natural Place, if the Point B is taken in the Glaſs, or at the ſame Diſtance, if in the <hi>Speculum.</hi> The Eye being brought back to O, the <hi>Object</hi> ſeems to draw near. And
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0548400800:51"/>
being come to P it beholds it ſtill nearer. And ſo on by little and little, till at length the Eye being placed ſomewhere, ſuppoſe at Q, the <hi>Object</hi> appearing extreamly near, begins to vaniſh into meer Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. All which doth ſeem Repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to our Principles, at leaſt, not rightly to agree with them. Nor is our Tenent alone ſtruck at by this Experiment, but likewiſe all others that ever came to my Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge are, every whit as much, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger'd by it. The ancient one eſpecially (which is moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiv'd, and comes neareſt to mine) ſeems to be ſo effectually overthrown thereby, that the moſt learned <hi>Tacquet</hi> has been forc'd to reject that Principle, as falſe and uncertain, on which alone he had built almoſt his whole <hi>Catoptrics,</hi> and conſequently by taking away the Foundation, hath himſelf pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down the Superſtructure he had raiſed on it. Which nevertheleſs,

I do not believe he wou'd have done, had he but conſider'd the whole matter more throughly, and examin'd the Difficulty to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. But as for me, neither this, nor any other Difficulty ſhall have ſo great an Influence on me, as to make me renounce that which I know to be manifeſtly agreeable to Reaſon. Eſpecially when, as it here falls out, the Difficulty is founded in the peculiar Nature of a certain odd and particular Caſe. For in the preſent Caſe ſomething peculiar lies hid, which being involv'd in the Subtilty of Nature will, perhaps, hardly be diſcover'd till ſuch Time, as the manner of <hi>Viſion</hi> is more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly made known.

It having been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the moſt Diverging Rays brought into the Mind the <hi>Idea</hi> of neareſt Diſtance, and that ſtill, as
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0548400800:63"/>
the Divergency decreas'd, the Diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance increas'd; and it being thought, the connexion between the various Degrees of Divergency, and Diſtance, was immediate; this naturally leads one to conclude, from an ill ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Analogy, that Converging Rays ſhall make an <hi>Object</hi> appear at an immenſe Diſtance: And that, as the Convergency increaſes, the Diſtance (if it were poſſible,) ſhou'd do ſo likewiſe. That this was the Cauſe of Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi>'s Miſtake, is evident from his own Words which we have Quoted. Whereas, had the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctor obſerv'd, that Diverging and Converging Rays, how oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite ſoever they may ſeem, do ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs agree in producing the ſame effect, <hi>viz. Confuſedneſs of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> greater Degrees whereof are produced indifferently, either as the Divergency, or Convergency of the Rays increaſeth. And that it is by this effect, which is the ſame in both, that either the Divergency, or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergency
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0548400800:64"/>
is perceived by the Eye. I ſay, had he but conſider'd this, 'tis certain he wou'd have made a quite contrary Judgment, and rightly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that thoſe Rays which fall on the Eye with greater degrees of Convergency ſhou'd make the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> from whence they proceed, appear by ſo much the nearer. But 'tis plain, it was impoſſible for any Man to attain to a right Notion of this Matter, ſo long as he had regard only to Lines and Angles; and did not apprehend the true Nature of <hi>Viſion,</hi> and how far it was of <hi>Mathematical</hi> Conſideration.</p>

               <p>Before we diſmiſs this this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, 'tis fit we take Notice of a Query, relating thereto, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by the Ingenious Mr. <hi>Moly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neux,</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>Dioptrics, Par.</hi> 1. <hi>Prop.</hi> 31. <hi>Sect.</hi> 9. where ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Difficulty we have been explaining, he has theſe Words,
<q rend="inline">
                     <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0548400800:65"/>
And ſo he (<hi>i. e.</hi> Dr. <hi>Barrow</hi>) leaves this Difficulty to the Solution of Others, which I (after ſo great an Example) ſhall do likewiſe; but with the Reſolution of the ſame admirable Author of not quitting the evident Doctrine which we have before laid down, for determining the <hi>Locus Objecti,</hi> on account of being Preſs'd by one Difficulty, which ſeems in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>explicable till a more intimate Knowledge of the Viſive Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty be obtain'd by Mortals. In the mean time, I propoſe it to the Conſideration of the Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, Whether the <hi>Locus Apparens</hi> of an <hi>Object</hi> placed as in this 9th <hi>Section,</hi> be not as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Eye, as the diſtinct Baſe is behind the Eye?</q>  To which Query we may venture to anſwer in the Negative. For in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe, the Rule for determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Diſtance of the diſtinct Baſe, or reſpective <hi>Focus</hi> from the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0548400800:66"/>

Hence it will follow by the Rule, that the Diſtance of the Diſtinct Baſe behind the Eye is double the true Diſtance of the <hi>Object</hi> before the Eye. If therefore Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi>'s Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture held good, it wou'd follow, that the Eye ſhou'd ſee the <hi>Object,</hi> twice as far off as it really is. And in other Caſes, at three or four times it's due Diſtance or more.

               <p>But for a fuller Explication of this Point, and to ſhew that the immediate <hi>Objects</hi> of Sight are not ſo much as the <hi>Ideas</hi> or Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blances of things placed at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, 'tis requiſite we look near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er into the Matter, and carefully obſerve what is meant in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Diſcourſe, when one ſays, that which he ſees is at a Diſtance from him. Suppoſe, for Example, That looking at the Moon I ſhou'd ſay, it were Fifty or Sixty Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diameters of the Earth diſtant from me. Let us ſee what Moon this is ſpoken of. 'Tis plain it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be the viſible Moon, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing like the viſible Moon, or that which I ſee, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a round, luminous Plain, of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Thirty viſible Points in Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter. For in caſe I am carry'd, from the place where I ſtand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly towards the Moon; 'tis ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt the <hi>Object</hi> varies, ſtill as I
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0548400800:71"/>
go on; and by the time that I am advanced Fifty or Sixty Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midiameters of the Earth, I ſhall be ſo far from being near a ſmall, round, luminous Flat, that I ſhall perceive nothing like it; this <hi>Ob-ject</hi> having long ſince diſappear'd, and if I wou'd recover it, it muſt be by going back to the Earth from whence I ſet out. Again, Suppoſe I perceive by Sight the faint and obſcure <hi>Idea</hi> of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, which I doubt whether it be a Man, or a Tree, or a Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but judge it to be at the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of about a Mile. 'Tis plain I cannot mean, that what I ſee is a Mile off, or that it is the Image or Likeneſs of any thing which is a Mile off. Since that every Step I take towards it, the Appearance alters, and from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Obſcure, Small, and Faint grows, Clear, Large, and Vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. And when I come to the Mile's end, that which I ſaw

               <p>In theſe, and the like Inſtances, the truth of the Matter, I find, ſtands thus. Having of a long time, expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced certain <hi>Ideas,</hi> perceivable by Touch, as Diſtance, Tangible Figure, and Solidity to have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with certain <hi>Ideas</hi> of Sight, I do upon perceiving theſe <hi>Ideas</hi> of Sight, forthwith conclude what Tangible <hi>Ideas</hi> are, by the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, ordinary courſe of Nature like to follow. Looking at an <hi>Object</hi> I perceive a certain Viſible Figure, and Colour with ſome degree of Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and other Circumſtances; which, from what I have formerly obſerv'd, determin me to think, that if I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance forward ſo many Paces, Miles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I ſhall be affected with ſuch, and ſuch <hi>Ideas</hi> of Touch. So that in truth, and ſtrictneſs of Speech, I neither ſee Diſtance it ſelf, nor any
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0548400800:73"/>
thing that I take to be at a Diſtance. I ſay, neither Diſtance, nor things placed at a Diſtance are themſelves, or their <hi>Ideas,</hi> truly perceiv'd by Sight. This I am perſwaded of, as to what concerns my ſelf. And I believe whoever will look narrowly into his own Thoughts, and examin what he means by ſaying, he ſees this, or that thing at a Diſtance, will agree with me that, what he ſees only ſuggeſts to his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that after having paſſed a certain Diſtance, to be meaſur'd by the Motion of his Body, which is perceivable by Touch, he ſhall come to perceive ſuch, and ſuch Tangible <hi>Ideas</hi> which have been uſually connected with ſuch and ſuch Viſible <hi>Ideas.</hi> But that one might be deceived by theſe ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of Senſe, and that there is no neceſſary Connexion, between Viſible, and Tangible <hi>Ideas</hi> ſuggeſted by them, we need go no farther than the next Looking-Glaſs or Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture,

as they do Diſtance independently of Magnitude. All which will be evident, to whoever conſiders what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>has been already ſaid, and what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows.</p>

We regard the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that environ us, in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they are adapted to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, or injure our own Bodies, and thereby, produce in our Minds the Senſations of Pleaſure, or Pain.

This is a plain Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, why thoſe ſhou'd be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us much more than theſe. And for this End, chiefly, the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Senſe</hi> ſeems to have been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed

               <p>Now in order to explicate the reaſon, of the Moon's appearing greater than ordinary in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon</hi>; it muſt be obſerv'd, that the Particles which compoſe our Atmoſphaere, do intercept the Rays of Light, proceeding from any <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> to the Eye; and by how much the greater is the Portion of Atmoſphaere, interjacent between the <hi>Object</hi> and the Eye, by ſo much the more are the Rays intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and by conſequence, the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the <hi>Object</hi> render'd more Faint: Every <hi>Object</hi> appearing more Vigorous or more Faint, in Proportion as it ſendeth more or fewer Rays unto the Eye.

               <p>If we attentively conſider the <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon</hi> before us, we ſhall find the not diſcerning between the Mediate, and Immediate Objects of Sight, to be the chief Cauſe of the Difficulty that occurs in the Explication of it. The Magnitude of the Viſible Moon, or that which is the proper and immediate <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> of Viſion, is no greater when the Moon is in the <hi>Horizon,</hi> than when it is in the <hi>Meridian.</hi> How comes it, therefore, to ſeem great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in one Situation than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? What is it can put this Cheat on the Underſtanding? It has no other Perception of the Moon, than what it gets by Sight: And that which is ſeen is of the ſame Extent, I ſay, the Viſible Appearance hath the very ſame, or, rather, a leſſer Magnitude when the Moon is view'd in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizontal,</hi> than when in the <hi>Meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dional</hi> Poſition: And yet it is E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0548400800:105"/>
greater in the former, than in the latter. Herein conſiſts the Difficulty; which doth Vaniſh, and admit of a moſt eaſy Solution, if we conſider that, as the Viſible Moon is not greater in the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon,</hi> than in the <hi>Meridian,</hi> ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is it thought to be ſo. It hath been already ſhewn, that in any act of <hi>Viſion,</hi> the Viſible <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject</hi> abſolutely, or in it ſelf, is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle taken notice of, the Mind ſtill carrying its View from that to ſome <hi>Tangible Ideas,</hi> which have been obſerv'd to be Connected with it, and by that means, come to be ſuggeſted by it. So that when a thing is ſaid to appear Great, or Small, or whatever Eſtimate be made of the Magnitude of any Thing; this is meant, not of the Viſible, but, of the Tangible <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</hi> This duly conſider'd, it will be no hard matter to reconcile, the ſeeming Contradiction there is, that the Moon ſhou'd appear of

For by <hi>Sect.</hi> LVI. the very ſame viſible Extenſion, with a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Faintneſs, ſhall ſuggeſt a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Tangible Extenſion.

               <head>LXXXIX The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon way of explaining it.</head>
               <p>In anſwer to this Difficulty, we are told, that the Mind perceiving an impulſe of a Ray of Light, on the upper part of the Eye, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders this Ray as coming in a direct Line, from the lower part of the <hi>Object</hi>; and in like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner tracing the Ray that ſtrikes on the lower part of the Eye, it is directed to the upper part of the <hi>Object.</hi> Thus in the adjacent Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, <hi>C</hi> the lower Point of the <hi>Object ABC</hi> is projected on <hi>c</hi> the upper part of the Eye. So like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, <figure/> the higheſt Point A is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected on <hi>a</hi> the loweſt part of the Eye; which makes the Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation <hi>cba</hi> inverted. But the Mind conſidering the Stroak that is made on <hi>c</hi> as coming in the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0548400800:125"/>
ſtraight Line <hi>C c</hi> from the lower End of the <hi>Object</hi>; and the Stroak or Impulſe on <hi>a,</hi> as coming in the Line <hi>Aa</hi> from the upper End of the <hi>Object,</hi> is directed to make a right Judgement of the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Object ABC,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Picture of it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted. Moreover, this is illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by conceiving a Blind Man, who holding in his Hands two Sticks that croſs each other, doth with them touch the extremities of an <hi>Object,</hi> placed in a perpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicular Situation. It is certain, this Man will judge that to be the upper part of the <hi>Object,</hi> which he touches with the Stick held in the undermoſt Hand, and that to be the lower part of the <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> which he touches with the Stick in his uppermoſt Hand. This is the common Explication of the erect Appearance of <hi>Objects,</hi> which is generally receiv'd and acquieſed in, being (as Mr. <hi>Molyneux</hi> tells us,

Add to this, that the explaining the manner of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> by the Example of croſs Sticks, and Hunting for the <hi>Object</hi> along the Axes of the Radious Pencils, doth ſuppoſe the proper <hi>Objects</hi> of Sight to be perceived at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from us, contrary to what hath been Demonſtrated.

Suppoſe the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Blind Perſon do, by his Touch, perceive a Man to ſtand Erect. Let us enquire into the manner of this. By the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Hand to the ſeveral Parts of a Human Body, he had perceiv'd different Tangible <hi>Ideas,</hi> which being collected into ſundry complex ones have diſtinct Names annexed to them. Thus one Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination of a certain Tangible Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, Bulk, and Conſiſtency of Parts is called the <hi>Head,</hi> another the <hi>Hand,</hi> a Third the <hi>Foot,</hi> and ſo of the reſt. All which Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex <hi>Ideas</hi> cou'd, in his Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, be made up only of <hi>Ideas</hi> perceivable by Touch. He had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo by his Touch obtain'd an <hi>Idea</hi> of Earth or Ground, towards which he perceives the Parts of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to have a natural Tendency.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0548400800:134"/>
Now, by <hi>Erect</hi> nothing more be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing meant, than that perpendicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Poſition of a Man, wherein his Feet are neareſt to the Earth: If the Blind Perſon by moving his Hand, over the Parts of the Man who ſtands before him, do perceive the Tangible <hi>Ideas</hi> that compoſe the Head, to be fartheſt from, and thoſe that compoſe the Feet to be neareſt to, that other Combination of Tangible <hi>Ideas</hi> which he calls <hi>Earth:</hi> He will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominate that Man <hi>Erect.</hi> But if we ſuppoſe him on a ſudden to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his Sight, and that he behold a Man ſtanding before him: It's evident, in that Caſe, he wou'd neither judge the Man he ſees, to be <hi>Erect</hi> nor <hi>Inverted</hi>; for he never having known thoſe Terms applied to any other, ſave Tangible Things, or which exiſted in the Space without him, and what he ſees neither being Tangible, nor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as exiſting without, he cou'd

it being an evident Corollary from what we have ſhewn, concerning the Difference there is betwixt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible and Tangible Extenſion.

By Touch he cou'd not perceive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Motion, but what was up or down, to the right or left, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or farther from him; beſides theſe, and their ſeveral Varieties or Complications, it's impoſſible he ſhou'd have any <hi>Idea</hi> of Motion.

which makes it unfit to repreſent the Tangible Square, but very fit to repreſent the Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gible Circle. Whence it clearly follows, that Viſible Figures are Patterns of, or of the ſame <hi>Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> with, the reſpective Tangible Figures repreſented by them; that they are like unto them, and of their own Nature fitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them as being of the ſame ſort; and that they are in no reſpect arbitrary Signs, as Words.</p>

But, becauſe the Viſible Square contains in it ſeveral diſtinct Parts, whereby to mark the ſeveral diſtinct, correſponding Parts of a Tangible Square, whereas the Viſible Circle
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0548400800:191"/>

And accordingly we ſee the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Figures contain in them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Viſible Parts anſwering to the diſtinct Tangible Parts of the Figures ſignify'd, or ſuggeſted by them.</p>
