            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>EXTRACT OF A LETTER, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>A Remark, which I made many years ago, reſpecting the <hi>illegality</hi> of taking up <hi>Slaves that had eſcaped from their maſters,</hi> had been uſeful (I was informed) to ſome friends of humanity in America, in their endeavours to protect thoſe poor oppreſſed people. I cannot now find a copy of that paper, but the argument was chiefly built on a reference to a text in Deut. ch. xxiii. v. 15, 16.— <q>
                  <hi>Thou ſhalt not deliver unto his maſter the ſervant which is eſcaped from his maſter unto thee: He ſhall dwell with thee, even among you, in the place</hi> WHICH HE SHALL CHOOSE</q> (manifeſtly <hi>as
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0155802400:3"/>a freeman</hi>) <q>
                  <hi>in one of thy</hi> GATES <hi>where</hi> IT LIKETH HIM BEST: <hi>thou ſhalt not oppreſs him.</hi>
               </q> This, I obſerved, was no part of the abrogated <hi>ceremonial</hi> law of the Jews; but, manifeſtly, a <hi>moral law,</hi> becauſe the reaſon of it ſtill remains:-ſo that it muſt be of indiſpenſible obligation as long as the hateful <hi>oppreſſions</hi> of Slave-holders afford us any occaſions of exerciſing this <hi>duty</hi> to <hi>God</hi> of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecting the Slaves that eſcape from their maſters;</hi> and conſequently I aſſerted that any <hi>colonial law,</hi> which oppoſes this <hi>ordinance of God,</hi> by ordering the arreſting and delivering up runaway Slaves, or which, in any way, tends to deprive them of due legal protection, is, of courſe, to be deemed a <hi>corruption, null</hi> and <hi>void</hi> in itſelf, as being contrary to the ſecond foundation of Engliſh law. This neceſſary conſequence I urged from a well known <hi>maxim</hi> of the Engliſh law reſpecting <hi>Statutes,</hi> (acts of Aſſembly, or acts of Parliament) <q>
                  <hi>nec contra</hi> RATIONEM, <hi>nec contra</hi> LEGEM DIVINAM" <hi>(ſtatuta) exiſtunt.</hi>
               </q> (Doct. et Stud. c. 10. p. 35. b.) —That <q>
                  <hi>Statutes exiſt not againſt</hi> REASON, nor againſt the DIVINE LAW," and that <hi>"an unjuſt law</hi> is NOT LAW.</q> 
               <hi>"Lex injuſta non eſt lex."</hi> Prin. Leg. et Aequit.) And again, that <q>
                  <hi>theſe two laws,</hi>
               </q> (viz. the Law of Reaſon, and the Law Divine) <hi>"cannot abate, or turn aſide"</hi>— <q>Hae duae Leges declinari non poſſunt.</q> Doct. et Stud. c. 17. p. 52.</p>
            <p>But I have ſince had occaſion to regard theſe two fundamental laws of the Engliſh conſtitution, with ſtill more awful attention; and therefore I muſt farther remark, that the firſt foundation, <hi>the law of</hi> REASON, (as including all the <hi>laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0155802400:4"/>juſtice, and natural right</hi>) is certainly to be deemed <hi>the law of God,</hi> as well as the <hi>ſecond foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> (the divine precepts in the Holy Scriptures), becauſe the former is defined by high legal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, to be <hi>"the law written upon the heart of man,"</hi> (and of courſe is the law of nature) which <hi>cannot</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>therefore be obliterated, nor changed by time or place, but ought every where,</hi> and among <hi>all men,</hi> to <hi>be maintained, becauſe</hi> THE LAWS OF NATURE ARE IMMUTABLE"—"<hi>Lex rationis in corde ſcribitur,</hi> ideo deleri non poteſt, nec etiam recipit mutationem ex loco nec tempore, ſed ubique, et inter omnes homines ſervari debet. Nam JURA NATURALIA IMMUTABILIA SUNT. Et ratio immutationis eſt quod recipiunt naturam rei pro fundamento, quae ſemper eadem eſt et ubique.</q> (Doct. et Stud. c. 2. p. 5.) This amply demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates the propriety of declaring <hi>the law of Reaſon</hi> to be the <hi>firſt foundation</hi> of Engliſh law; as being <hi>"the law of God, written"</hi> (as it were) <q>
                  <hi>on the heart of man</hi>
               </q>—It is that <q>
                  <hi>knowledge of good and evil</hi> in man,</q> which may fairly be deemed a participation of <hi>"the Divine Wiſdom,"</hi> or of Chriſt himſelf, that <q>
                  <hi>true light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world.</hi>
               </q> (John i. 9.) and of courſe renders every man obnoxious, through the knowledge of right and law, to the divine vengeance for diſobedience! Our firſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents <hi>wilfully</hi> aſſumed this knowledge, contrary to an expreſs command of their Creator, (being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by the ſpiritual enemy) and thereby entailed <hi>death</hi> and <hi>condemnation</hi> on all their poſterity, laying them under an abſolute neceſſity to obtain <hi>redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0155802400:5"/>by a ſtill farther participation of the ſame <hi>"Divine Wiſdom,"</hi> or <hi>"Word of God."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is alſo another legal term or title, for this <hi>firſt foundation of law;</hi> viz. <q>
                  <hi>the eternal law,</hi>
               </q> which in our books is properly defined to mean exactly the ſame authority as <q>
                  <hi>the law of reaſon,</hi>
               </q> i. e. <hi>the ſupreme reaſon of</hi> DIVINE <q>WISDOM, <hi>by which</hi> GOD WILLS <hi>that all things created by him, be moved and directed to a good and proper end.</hi>—LEX AETERNA <hi>nihil aliud eſt quam ipſa</hi> SUMMA RATIO GUBERNATIONIS RERUM IN DEO, <hi>ſive illa ſumma ratio</hi> DIVINAE SAPIENTIAE, <hi>qua vult</hi> DEUS <hi>omnia a ſe condita moveri, et dirigi ad bonum et debitum finem,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. (Doct. et Stud. c. 1. p. 2.)—and again, <q>
                  <hi>The</hi> LAW ETERNAL, <hi>under another deſcription, is called a perpetual and conſtant</hi> WILL <hi>to give to every one his</hi> RIGHT. <hi>Lex Aeterna ſub alia deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criptione dicitur perpetua et conſtans</hi> VOLUNTAS JUS SUUM UNICUIQUE TRIBUENS.</q> (ibid.) Here then we find an immoveable foundation of <hi>juſtice,</hi> of <hi>right,</hi> of <hi>the rights of man,</hi> of <hi>righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> of <hi>the law of nature,</hi> &amp;c. for all theſe terms are parallel, or of the ſame import; and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily included in the <hi>law of reaſon</hi> or <hi>eternal law,</hi> which is properly called <q>
                  <hi>the firſt law</hi> — LEX <hi>etiam</hi> AETERNA <hi>dicitur</hi> LEX PRIMA, <hi>et bene dicitur prima, nam fuit ante omnes alias leges: et omnes aliae leges dirivantur ab ea:</hi>—The LAW ETERNAL <hi>is called the</hi> FIRST LAW, and <hi>well is it called the firſt, for it was before all other laws; and all other laws are derived from it.</hi>
               </q> In this ſolemn view of the <hi>firſt foundation of Engliſh law,</hi> it muſt evidently be deemed <hi>"a witneſs of God,"</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0155802400:6"/>as well as the <hi>ſecond foundation,</hi> the written <hi>word of God in the Holy Scriptures;</hi> and <hi>both foundations</hi> may well be expreſſed together by the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious terms of <hi>"natural and revealed religion."</hi> In no inſtance whatever are <hi>theſe</hi> TWO WITNESSES OF GOD more obviouſly and undeniably reſiſted than in the <hi>toleration of ſlavery</hi> and <hi>the Slave Trade,</hi> becauſe theſe oppreſſions are <hi>iniquities</hi> which militate againſt <hi>both the foundations,</hi> and therefore the preſent public queſtion, whether the <hi>Slave Trade</hi> ought or ought not to be <hi>aboliſhed,</hi> may fairly be deemed an infallible <hi>touch-ſtone</hi> to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the treachery of pretended <hi>loyaliſts;</hi> for no man can be truly <hi>loyal</hi> to God and his country, who is ſo totally devoid of <hi>firſt principles,</hi> as to <hi>favour ſlavery!</hi> Let thoſe who have <hi>ignorantly</hi> done ſo, recover their credit by redoubled endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to reſtore the honour and conſtitutional law of their country, which has been wounded by their <hi>treacherous</hi> neglect of the foundations of law, whereby they will otherwiſe <hi>incur that indelible ſtain of infamy,</hi> which our <hi>common</hi> LAW deſervedly fixes on all perſons <hi>who betray the law of the land,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Legem terrae amittentes perpetuam infamiae notam inde merito incurrunt.</hi>
               </q> (3 Inſt. p. 221). But mark the authorities of our <hi>common law</hi> to this purpoſe—<hi>"Liberty,"</hi> is declared by the maxims of the <hi>firſt foundation,</hi> to be <hi>"ineſtimable"</hi>— <q>
                  <hi>Libertas eſt res ineſtimabilis</hi>
               </q> (Jenk. Cent. 52.) and <q>
                  <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is the greateſt jewel.</hi>
               </q> (Grounds &amp; Rudim. of Law and Equity, p. 196.) and therefore <q>
                  <hi>cruel</hi> of neceſſity muſt that law be deemed, which <hi>aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menteth ſlavery,</hi> and <hi>diminiſheth liberty</hi>
               </q>—ſays the excellent and worthy Chancellor Forteſcue,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0155802400:7"/>who in very dark times of prevailing <hi>beſtial power,</hi> nobly aſſerted the ſupreme immutable authority of <hi>God's two witneſſes,</hi> as manifeſted in the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of our Engliſh common law, or legal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. "For in behalf of <hi>liberty"</hi> (ſays he), "human nature always implores" (or ſolicits fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour), <q>
                  <hi>becauſe</hi> Slavery is introduced <hi>by man,</hi> and <hi>for vice;</hi> but LIBERTY is implanted BY GOD, in the <hi>very nature of man:</hi> wherefore when ſtolen by man, it always earneſtly longs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, as does every thing which is deprived of <hi>natural liberty;</hi> for which reaſon the man who does <hi>not favour liberty</hi> is to be adjudged IMPIOUS and CRUEL.

               </q> The oppoſite condition, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, to liberty, viz. <hi>ſlavery,</hi> is properly declared by one of our oldeſt Engliſh authorities in law, <hi>Fleta,</hi> to be "<hi>contrary to nature.</hi>

<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0155802400:9"/>of London, <note n="*" place="bottom">Viz.

                     <hi>uſed his neighbour's ſervice without wages, and gave him not for his work;</hi>
                  </q> to thoſe that <hi>"oppreſſed the ſtranger wrongfully;"</hi> and to thoſe, perhaps more particularly, who preſumed to make <hi>"private property"</hi> of the poor and the ſtranger, by iniquitous ordinances, contrary to the <hi>foundations of law;</hi> depriving them of <hi>"judgment,"</hi> I mean that <hi>protection of the laws,</hi> which is empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically deemed <hi>"the judgment of God,"</hi> and which all <hi>legal</hi> Kings and their Judges are ſtill bound by their oaths to maintain, viz. <hi>"judgment,"</hi> (or <hi>"due proceſs of the law,"</hi>) <q>
                     <hi>without reſpect of perſons.</hi>
                  </q> For where this <hi>"judgment of God"</hi> is even only <hi>neglected,</hi> there can be <hi>no legal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> but if the <hi>neglect</hi> of it be actually ordained by <hi>"unrighteous decrees,"</hi> pretending to give men a <hi>right</hi> to do <hi>wrong,</hi> and to <hi>"eſtabliſh iniquity by a law,"</hi> the preſumption muſt be <hi>heinous</hi> in the ſight of the <hi>King of Righteouſneſs;</hi> for in no other ſenſe were the perſons whom the Prophets charged with <hi>"eating up the people,"</hi> (<q>
                     <hi>flaying their ſkin from off them, and chopping them in pieces, as for the pot,</hi>

It would be an awful inquiry to trace the time when the Engliſh Nation was rendered obnoxious by <hi>Slavery,</hi> to the application of theſe horrible epithets, <hi>impious, cruel,</hi> &amp;c. And it is wonderful how the <hi>unnatural crime</hi> could ſo long be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked, until uſage and cuſtom had eſtabliſhed in all the Britiſh Colonies, as a <hi>right,</hi> this enormous <hi>wrong;</hi> to the perverſion of all legal terms. We
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0155802400:11"/>cannot conceive that the admiſſion of Slavery into the Colonies has been <hi>intentional</hi> on the part of government at home, but merely through want of a fixt attention to <hi>the two firſt principles of law</hi> and religion. But the ſworn Judges of the Colonial Courts (when the oppreſſion firſt began,) were without excuſe for permitting the evil of Slavery to take root without warning their Royal Maſters of the <hi>illegality,</hi> knowing that the <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional law</hi> of the kingdom, is <q>
                  <hi>to deny juſtice to no man</hi>
               </q> without exception, (<q>
                  <hi>nulli negabimus aut differemus juſtitiam;</hi>
               </q> Magna Charta.) and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that they themſelves are ſworn <q>
                  <hi>to do juſtice and judgment without reſpect of perſons,</hi>
               </q>—and alſo that under a <hi>legal</hi> Engliſh Government, there can be but <hi>one law</hi> for all deſcriptions of perſons, according to two excellent maxims of the firſt foundation; <note n="*" place="bottom">"Turpis eſt pars quae non convenit cum ſuo toto," and <q>nihil in lege intolerabilius eſt eandem rem diverſo jure cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeri. </q> (Grounds &amp; Rudim. of Law and Eq. No. 307,)</note> and conſequently that without <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional reprobacy,</hi> there could be no ſuch perſonal diſtinctions in law as SLAVEHOLDER and SLAVE, ſo that they muſt be bound in duty to their King and Country, to prevent in the King's name any ſuch oppreſſion as <hi>Slaveholding.</hi> They ought to have known, that the limited temporal permiſſion which had been granted to the Iſraelites to hold <hi>Slaves,</hi> was abſolutely annulled by a ſubſequent command of God, <q>to let the <hi>oppreſſed go free, and to break every yoke,</hi>
               </q> (Iſaiah c. lviii. v. 5 and
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0155802400:12"/>6). There is no exception to this command, which proves that a <hi>total Abolition of Slavery</hi> was at that time, the declared <hi>Will of God:</hi> which is ſtill more clearly demonſtrated by a future denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciation againſt the practice of Slaveholders, by the prophet Jeremiah, juſt before the Iſraelites them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were to be carried into <hi>Slavery</hi> for their <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions</hi> and neglect of God's laws.</p>
            <p>

                  <hi>Woe be to him that uſeth his neighbour's ſervice</hi> WITHOUT WAGES, <hi>and giveth him not for his work.</hi>
               </q> Theſe are <hi>moral laws</hi> of <hi>eternal obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> (though recorded in the Old Teſtament) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the <hi>reaſon, juſtice,</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> of them are ſtill obvious; for <hi>"ratio legis eſt anima legis,"</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſurely <hi>woe</hi> is moſt alarmingly due to <hi>all govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> or pretended legal eſtabliſhments, which ſanction ſuch notorious injuſtice and oppreſſion! Should a total diſregard of the two firſt foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the <hi>Engiſh Law</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, we ſhall have not only to dread the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy</hi> incurred, according to the maxim, <q>
                  <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gem Terrae amittentes,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c. but alſo to look for <hi>divine retribution</hi> from him who has promiſed to <q>

               </q> And indeed after the moſt careful inveſtigation of all the prophetical marks of the antichriſtian beaſt, and its image, compared with preceding times, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt Chronological Hiſtories, I am convinced that the accompliſhment and end of the tyranny (<hi>not</hi> by <hi>human means,</hi> but <hi>"without hand"</hi>) muſt be nearly approaching!

Let not the inhabitants of Maryland and Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina conceive, that becauſe their territories are not included within the bounds of the four great mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, the theatre of the prophetical examples of <hi>Divine vengeance,</hi> that they ſhall be leſs liable to the awful effects of it!
