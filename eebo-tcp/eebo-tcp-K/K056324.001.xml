            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Papers of the Family of BRUNS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WICK-LUNENBURGH, and thoſe of the Houſe of STUART, having been placed in the hands of the Author of the following volumes, he was encouraged to write the HISTORY OF GREAT BRITAIN, during a very important period. The new light thrown upon public tranſactions, the diſcoveries made in the ſecret views of parties, the certainty eſtabliſhed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the real characters of particular perſons, and the undeviating juſtice ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to all, will, he hopes, atone for his defects as a writer, and recommend his work to the public. Unwilling to advance any matter of fact, without proof, he has printed his materials; and for their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity, he refers the reader to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers themſelves.</p>
            <p>In the dates of great events, in facts which fell under public diſcuſſion, in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions of importance, in the ſtate of debts, taxes, grants, and ſupplies, he has availed himſelf of the records and journals of the two houſes of parliament. In the detail of battles he has followed the beſt mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary writers; in well-known events, the authors who wrote in the times. In de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0709200301:3"/>
the ſecret ſprings of action, the private negociations of parties, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of miniſters and the motives of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereigns, he has followed unerring guides, original papers. In relating the affairs of Great Britain, he has frequently introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſummary of the affairs of Europe. He has conſulted, with the utmoſt attention, the beſt writers of foreign nations; and endeavoured to give a comprehenſive view of the ſtate of other countries, in order to throw a more complete light on our own.</p>
            <p>Where the facts are important and but little known, the authorities have been carefully quoted. Where their truth is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally admitted, the author has been leſs anxious about the preciſion of his citations. To crowd a margin with the names of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent writers, is an eaſy, and, perhaps, a harmleſs impoſture. In the minds of the ſuperficial, the expedient might eſtabliſh an opinion of an Author's induſtry and knowledge; but it would have little effect on the judicious, from whoſe deciſion he has moſt to hope and to fear. To the latter, it may be ſufficient to obſerve, that he has conſulted, on every point, a greater number of printed works, than he would chuſe to cite at the bottom of any page. He has taken no fact, in all its circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, from any one writer. His narrative is the general reſult of an intenſe inquiry into what has been advanced on all ſides.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0709200301:4"/>
In recording events, every poſſible at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention has been paid to the order of time. The dates have been carefully inveſtigated; and, where they are not interwoven with the work, are placed at the bottom of the page. In matters already known and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, a comprehenſive brevity has been ſtudied. No circumſtance, however, has been neglected, no fact overlooked, that was thought either material in itſelf, or condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to throw light on events of real im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance. The intrigues of the cabinet have been more minutely recorded than the operations of the field. In the deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of battles, ſieges, and naval engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the Author has endeavoured to be conciſe. But he has marked the outlines of military operations with a preciſion that brings forward the whole figure diſtinctly to the view.</p>
            <p>Where the tranſactions are moſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, and leaſt known, the greateſt labour and time have been beſtowed. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues which preceded the Revolution, and were partly the cauſe of that event, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigated at an early period, and traced through their whole progreſs. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Revolution itſelf have been examined with the utmoſt care, and the moſt undeviating attention to truth. The events that immediately followed the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of William and Mary, particularly the affairs of Ireland, have employed a
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0709200301:5"/>
great deal of time, as they have hitherto been very imperfectly known. The nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations of King James in France, his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret intrigues with his former ſubjects, have been carefully connected with the great line of hiſtory; and their effects on public affairs, as well as on the conduct of particular perſons, have been pointed out, as the circumſtances themſelves aroſe.</p>
            <p>Upon the death of James, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent demiſe of King William, the whole ſyſtem of ſecret intrigues for the throne ſuffered a material change. In the firſt years of Queen Anne, the adherents of the Pretender abroad, fixed their hopes on the ſuppoſed affection of that Princeſs for her brother and family. Thoſe in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land who were moſt attached to the heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary deſcent of the crown, entertained the ſame views. The diſturbances in Scotland, which terminated in the union of the two kingdoms, were ſucceeded by events, which are related with brevity, as they are in ſome meaſure already known. But the change of men and meaſures, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the year 1710, introduced a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of hiſtory that has been hitherto ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little underſtood. The four laſt years of Queen Anne, therefore, coſt the Author much time and labour; and if he has not ſucceeded, his want of abilities muſt be blamed, and not his want of information.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0709200301:6"/>
The reign of Charles the Second has been much inveſtigated by other writers. The cauſes of many of the moſt important events are already ſufficiently known. But the ample extracts from the life of King James the Second, which were placed here in the Author's hands, the acceſs he had, in perſon, at Paris, to the papers of that Prince, together with ſome materials, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unknown, procured from other ſources, have enabled him to throw a new, and, he hopes, a complete light on that period. He was adviſed to prefix only a review of that reign to his work. But he neither lik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that imperfect mode of writing hiſtory, nor could he be perſuaded, after he had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the ſubject, that any of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors had occupied the whole ground.</p>
            <p>To decide on the execution of the work, is the province of the Public. To form ſome judgement of his own ſentiments, may be fairly left to the Author. In his progreſs through his ſubject, he is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of having once departed from the obvious line of evidence. He felt no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilection for any party. He has, ſurely, been biaſſed by none. In his obſervations on the worſt men, he has made allowan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for human paſſions. In commending the beſt, he was forced to remember their frailties. He conſidered himſelf through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out in the light of a judge upon mankind
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0709200301:7"/>
and their actions; and, as he had no object but truth, he truſts he has attained his end.</p>
            <p>To ſpeak with more warmth of the work, would be incompatible with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſty, which writers ought to obſerve when they treat of themſelves. To ſay leſs in its favour, the Author hopes, would be deemed inconſiſtent with juſtice. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out vanity, he may affirm, that the hiſtory of the period he has choſen, has been hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto very IMPERFECTLY KNOWN. He is far from ſuppoſing, that the following vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes are wholly free from errors. He hopes, however, that they are neither great nor many, with regard to matters of fact.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> CHARLES the Second was proclaimed, at London, on the eighth of May, in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty. He en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered that city, on the twenty-ninth of the month, amid the acclamations of an infinite concourſe of ſpectators. The two houſes of parliament attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the King, at Whitehall; and, by their ſpeakers, congratulated him, in terms full of ſubmiſſion and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty. The populace, with their uſual extravagance,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0709200301:16"/>
expreſſed their ſatisfaction in riot and intemperance. The terrors of anarchy and confuſion yielded to the hopes of a regular ſteadineſs in government. The pomp of royalty pleaſed the bulk of mankind; its novelty all. The change was great, but not ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, among a people, who had fallen, under an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſpecies of tyranny, after all their efforts to be free.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">State of the nation.</note> The joy, which the reſtoration of monarchy diffuſed over the kingdom, ſeemed to level all parties into a voluntary obedience to the King. The nation, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was not to be ſettled, at once, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions which had overturned the throne. Jealouſies, animoſities, and high expectations, prevailed, among the adherents of monarchy. The independents were afraid of a retaliation of ſeverities. The Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, in ſome meaſure, deſpaired of eſtabliſhing their favourite ſyſtem of church-government. Silence and melancholy ſeized the republican party, at the diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of all their hopes. The army, though, at different times, purged by Monk, were rather paſſive to his meaſures, than fond of kingly government. Moſt of the old ſoldiers were fanatics. Even thoſe, who had attended the General from Scotland, obeyed him more from an affection to his perſon, than any regard to his political views. The eagerneſs of the body of the people, to return to the ancient conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, had formed the firmeſt foundation for its ſupport. They regarded, in their elections, the political cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of their repreſentatives. A great majority of thoſe, who were choſen to ſerve in the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, were men known for their attachment to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, or remarkable for their moderate principles. The declaration from Breda had left the ſettlement of the nation in the parliament; and though the forms of their proceedings were productive of an inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient delay, that important buſineſs could not be plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſafer or more able hands.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Character of the King.</note> The diſpoſition and character of Charles, as far as they were THEN known, were well ſuited to the times. Attached to no ſyſtem of religion, he ſeemed favourable to all. In appearance deſtitute of political ambition, his ſudden elevation was more an object of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0709200301:17"/>
admiration, than of jealouſy. Accommodating in his profeſſions and eaſy in his manner, he pleaſed even thoſe whom he could not gratify. Men, from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, enemies to monarchy, were prejudiced in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the perſon of the Prince. Thoſe in whom fear might excite averſion, loſt their hatred, in his apparent forgetfulneſs of paſt injuries. Though a lover of diſſipation and pleaſure, he could bear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, and had a talent for buſineſs. Though na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally unſteady, he could aſſume the appearance of firmneſs; and his quickneſs of apprehenſion was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, by the ſuperficial, for uncommon abilities of mind. Adhering ſtrictly to no principle himſelf, he was not much offended at the want of it in others. He gained the profligate by indulgence; by his good-nature and attention, he flattered the pride of the virtuous. Inſinuating, diſſembling, but frequently judicious, he came upon mankind, through the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of their ruling paſſions; and till his profeſſions of regard to men of oppoſite principles became too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to be thought ſincere, he gained the affection, if not the eſteem, of his ſubjects.</p>
               <p>His accommodating character was the chief ſupport of Charles throughout his reign. The careleſſneſs of his meaſures raiſed him many opponents; but the eaſineſs of his temper prevented him from having perſonal enemies. His defects, however, were not perceived when he mounted the throne. A penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judge of the character of others, he was no ſtranger to his own; and he reſolved to turn its faireſt ſide to the world. With too much good ſenſe, to throw away, by wantonneſs and folly, what fortune had unexpectedly beſtowed, he was cautious in his firſt meaſures; and, by the appearance of a ſtrict im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality in the diſtribution of his ſavours, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed the moſt inveterate among the parties which ſtill divided the nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry,</note> A prudent choice of his principal ſervants promiſed better meaſures, than thoſe which Charles afterwards produced through his reign. He filled his council, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deteriminately, from all parties. Ability was more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, than political principle, or previous conduct.

Many, who had oppoſed his father, were admitted into ſtations near his own perſon. Several, who had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the late republic, were now employed in the ſervice of monarchy. The principal departments of the ſtate were truſted to friends. Sir Edward Hyde, diſtinguiſhed for his fidelity, as well as for his talents in buſineſs, was made chancellor. The Marquis of Ormonde, more remarkable for his honour and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, than for great abilities, was conſtituted ſteward of the houſehold. The treaſury, after having been for near nine months in commiſſion, was delivered over to the ſole management of the Earl of South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton<note n="A" place="bottom">Feb. 1661.</note> a man of unſhaken firmneſs and unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed reputation. The Duke of York was inveſted with the office of lord high admiral of England. Monk, created maſter of the horſe to the King, was continued captain-general of all the forces in the three kingdoms. Nicholas, a man of unbiaſſed integrity and experience in the ſervice of the crown, and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, who owed his elevation to the patronage of Monk, were ſecretaries of ſtate.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</note> To reſtore juſtice to its ancient courſe, employed the firſt care of the King and his ſervants. The courts in Weſtminſter-hall were filled with judges of known abilities in their profeſſion; of profeſſed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to monarchy, and the re-eſtabliſhed laws. The ſervants of the crown opened a free and friendly intercourſe with the leading members of both hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes<note n="B" place="bottom">James II. 1660.</note>. They concerted the beſt meaſures for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the buſineſs with expedition and ſucceſs. The King himſelf ſeemed inclined to manage the great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the nation, through the medium of an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to whom he owed his throne. An enemy to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and fond of pleaſure, he threw early the weight of the ſtate on his miniſters. Hyde poſſeſſed the moſt credit and the greateſt power. Indefatigable in his nature, and placing even his amuſement in buſineſs, he was the moſt experienced, and, perhaps, the moſt able of the ſervants of the crown. Southampton, though a man of abilities, was indolent; Monk,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0709200301:19"/>
more verſant in the labours of the field, than the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues of the cabinet. Nicholas, unambitious in his character, ſacrificed the importance of his office to his high opinion of the chancellor's talents; Morrice, though a man of integrity, loſt his conſequence, in his ignorance of foreign affairs. Ormonde, in the warmth of a ſincere friendſhip, adhered in every thing to Hyde. The Duke of York, by the expreſs orders of the King, lived on the beſt terms with the miniſtry<note n="C" place="bottom">James II. 1660.</note>. Every thing fell, ſooner than could have been expected, into regularity and form. A general ſettlement in the civil juſtice of the kingdom prevailed. No injury was without its remedy; and complaints, more frequent even in the worſt govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments than injuſtice, were ſcarce ever heard<note n="D" place="bottom">Clarendon's life.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Proceedings in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> The two houſes of parliament proceeded to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the nation. The lords, lately reſtored to their function in the ſtate, ſeemed ſenſible of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, which had deprived them ſo long of their right. They, however, had not arrived at their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer weight and conſequence. The Commons, who had given ſuch recent proofs of their importance, ſtill retained their ſuperiority. In terms of the King's declaration from Breda, they brought into their houſe a bill of general indemnity, before he took poſſeſſion of the throne. They reſolved, on the fourteenth of May, to except ſeven of thoſe, who ſat in judgment on the late King, out of the act of oblivion. In their zeal to animadvert upon paſt offences, they even ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended puniſhment beyond the grave. Serjeant Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, preſident of the high court of juſtice, though dead, was attainted for treaſon. On the eighth of June they reſolved, that the number of twenty, and no more, beſides the King's judges, ſhould be except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, not extending to life. Hutchinſon, for his ſignal repentance, was left out of the clauſe of excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="E" place="bottom">Journals of the houſe of commons.</note>. Colonel Ingoldſby, for his late ſervices, was forgiven and rewarded. The debates, which aroſe upon naming the perſons, rendered tedious the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0709200301:20"/>
progreſs of the bill; and, though the King, in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral meſſages, expreſſed his impatience, the act took ſome months in paſſing through both houſes<note n="F" place="bottom">Journals.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity.</note> The debates in the houſe of commons were not the only cauſe of the delay which attended the act of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnity. The lords, in their zeal for monarchy, and exaſperated by former injuries, ſeemed reſolved to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept every perſon who had ſat in judgment on the royal party. The Earl of Briſtol, who had declared himſelf a Catholic, ſome months before the Reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="G" place="bottom">James II. 1660.</note>, was the moſt violent. Though excluded, on account of his religion, from holding a place in the privy-council, he was ſtill truſted with the ſecret of affairs<note n="H" place="bottom">James II. 1663.</note>. Haughty and arrogant, impetuous in his manner, and ambitious in his diſpoſition, he was determined to direct councils, of which he was not permitted to partake<note n="I" place="bottom">James II. 1660.</note>. To ſecure his intereſt with the King, he pretended zeal in the royal cauſe. He moved in the houſe, that no pardon ſhould be granted to thoſe who had any way contributed to the death of the late King. Briſtol's influence at court was no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret. The nation was alarmed at ſo wide an excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They began to think that the king, by an artifice, intended to elude his declaration. Charles came to the houſe, and put an end to their fears. He requeſted the lords to extinguiſh the terrors of the people, to remove their apprehenſions of ſafety. He deſired them to conſider his promiſe, and to exclude none but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicides from the benefit of the act of oblivion. He preſſed them to forget their animoſities, to lay aſide revenge, to drop even the memory of the paſt. He plainly told them, that the peace of the kingdom, if not the very exiſtence of monarchy, depended upon expedition in paſſing the bill<note n="K" place="bottom">Journals of the lords.</note>.</p>

To quiet the poſſeſſion of the ſubject, by confirming the judicial proceedings which had paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0709200301:21"/>
ſince the beginning of the late diſturbances, was an object nearly as important as the act of oblivion. All ſentences in law and equity, ſince the firſt of May, 1642, were confirmed by an act of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Some few reſtrictions were made, with regard to crown and church lands. The two houſes filled their debates with declarations againſt the legality of the procedings of the long parliament, after it had been mutilated by the army. Their zeal might even have led them to reſcind all acts of the parliament, which met in the November of the year 1640; but the chancellor ſhewed no inclination to look back ſo far. James the Second, in his Memoirs, blames this negligence in Hyde, in terms expreſſive of his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt a body of men who had ſo much injured his family<note n="L" place="bottom">James II. 1660.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Settlement of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue.</note> In the ſettlement of the revenue, the houſe of commons ſhewed as much regard for the liberties of the ſubject, as they had done in their other reſolutions for the royal prerogative. It was reſolved, before the King's arrival, to aboliſh the courts of wards and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries<note n="M" place="bottom">Journals, May 25.</note>, as a public grievance; and to make, for that revenue, a compenſation to the crown<note n="N" place="bottom">Journals, Aug. 4.</note>. One hundred thouſand pounds was propoſed by the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Double the ſum had been offered, and, in the reign of James, refuſed for thoſe branches of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, together with that of purveyance. This compoſition was charged upon the exciſe; one half of which was ſettled, in perpetuity, on the crown. The other half of the exciſe, and the revenue ariſing from tonnage and poundage, were granted to the King during his life. A committee reported to the houſe, on the fourth of September, that, by an eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, the King's revenue might be computed at little more than eight hundred thouſand pounds. The commons came to reſolution to increaſe it to twelve hundred thouſand pounds. The charging of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue upon adequate funds was a matter of difficulty, and was therefore adjourned to the next meeting of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0709200301:22"/>
parliament<note n="O" place="bottom">Speaker's ſpeech, Sept. 4.</note>. An act was, however, paſſed for raiſing one hundred thouſand pounds for the King's preſent ſupply; which ſum was to be levied, by way of land-rate, within the ſpace of one month, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin on the twenty-ninth of September<note n="P" place="bottom">Journals, Sept. 4.</note>.</p>

An aſſeſſment of ſeventy thouſand pounds, to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for three months, at firſt voted, was unequal to the purpoſe of paying their arrears<note n="Q" place="bottom">Journals.</note>. Another act was paſſed, a few days before the adjournment, for an additional aſſeſſment, to begin on the firſt of November, and to continue for two months. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimony of the commons, notwithſtanding their profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of unlimited loyalty, was evidently intended to keep the King in a ſtate of dependence on his parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The next houſe of commons, according to James the Second<note n="R" place="bottom">James II. 1660.</note>, were leſs attentive to the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of their conſtituents. He aſcribes their frugality more to, what he calls, the prejudices of Sir Edward Hyde, than to their own patriotiſm. In the warmth of their zeal for reſtored monarchy, they could deny nothing to their prince. It was propoſed by ſome leading members to ſettle a very large revenue on the crown<note n="S" place="bottom">2,000,000 l.</note>. The chancellor prevented the motion from being made in the houſe. He was afraid that the King would ſtand no longer in need of parliament; or, what was ſtill more contrary to his principles, that the Popiſh religion might be introduced, as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to the authority of the crown. <q rend="inline">"This overſight, or rather terror in Hyde,"</q> continues James, <q rend="inline">"was the ſource of the dangers which monarchy has ſince undergone. In every other particular, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, to the height, the power of the crown<note n="T" place="bottom">James II. 1660.</note>."</q> The two houſes having thus far brought forward the public buſineſs, on the thirteenth of September<note n="U" place="bottom">Journals.</note>

                  <note place="margin">Honours conferred.</note> Whilſt parliament was preparing puniſhments for the late King's enemies, Charles was buſy in reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his own friends. Thoſe who had adhered the beſt to his family, contributed, from that circumſtance, the leaſt to his reſtoration; and, therefore, their fidelity was forgot, in their want of power to be of ſervice. Beſides, their number was a kind of excuſe for an appearance of ingratitude. Though the King was not deſtitute of generoſity, he was not poſſeſſed of the means of exerciſing it, in an extenſive degree. The hereditary property of the crown had been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipated in the late troubles; and had even the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue promiſed by parliament been ſettled, it was une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, without the moſt rigid oeconomy, to carry on the neceſſary ſervice of the ſtate. Hereditary honours were the only rewards which Charles could beſtow with eaſe. Monk, by the title of Duke of Albemarle, took his ſeat in the houſe of lords<note n="X" place="bottom">Journals of the Lords.</note>, on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of July.

During a viſit, which the Princeſs of Orange paid to the Queen mother at Paris, in the year 1657, the Duke of York fell in love with Mrs. Anne Hyde, one of her maids of honour, and daughter to Sir Edward Hyde. The Duke's affection for the daughter began when he was on bad terms with the father; and the latter remained in abſolute ignorance of a circumſtance which was ſcarce a ſecret in his family<note n="Z" place="bottom">James II. 1662.

General Harriſon, the ſon of a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher at Newcaſtle, and originally an attorney's clerk<note n="H" place="bottom">Regicides no Martyrs.</note> was the firſt perſon brought before the commiſſioners. To an elevation of mind, which ſprung from his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural courage, Harriſon added an ignorance ſuitable to the meanneſs of his original ſtation. He defended the deed, of which he was accuſed, with boldneſs; and, with an enthuſiaſm peculiar to the extraordinary times in which he had figured, he made Heaven it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the author of an action deemed, by the generality of mankind, one of the worſt of crimes. Cook, a lawyer, argued for himſelf with all the ſubtlety of his profeſſion. Scot, a republican from principle, gloried in being inſtrumental in the death of a King.

The parliament, in their attention to the civil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of the ſtate, had left the difficult buſineſs of religion to be ſettled by the crown. Though the ſufferings of the church of England, during the late troubles, ſeemed to enſure the recovery of her ancient rights and ſplendour with the reſtoration of monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, the King was obſtructed in his deſigns in favour of the hierarchy, by the declaration of Breda. The Preſbyterians had claims upon his gratitude; and other diſſenters derived great hopes of kind uſage, from his known indifference to all religious forms. Charles wiſhed to gain all, by diſobliging none. On the twenty-fifth of October, he iſſued a healing de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, conſiſting of eight articles<note n="K" place="bottom">Kennet's Regiſter, p. 289.</note>.

The Preſbyterians, who held the chief influence, had loſt their objections to a limited monarchy, in the injuſtice and tyranny of the independents. The lower houſe conſiſted chiefly of that ſect; and even many of the lords were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced in favour of principles of eccleſiaſtical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſo ſuitable to civil liberty. The commons carried the moderate views of their conſtituents into their public deliberations.

They ſteered between the limits of prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative and the borders of popular liberty, rebuilding the breaches of both, as they moved forward through public affairs. Though the King had diſcovered no ſymptoms of a love of arbitrary power, they were willing to keep him, by a limited revenue, in a kind of dependence on parliament; wiſely judging, that they were no longer neceſſary than they had favours to beſtow. The convention-parliament, in ſhort, was the happy medium, between the ſtern violence of their predeceſſors, and the implicit complaiſance of their ſucceſſors, in the choice of the nation.</p>

It was even a ſubject of debate, whether the Scots ſhould be reſtored to their independence, or retained under the yoke impoſed upon them by Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. The commiſſioners ſent from Scotland to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate the re-eſtabliſhment of her affairs, argued for the freedom of their country; and Charles himſelf was inclined to the ancient conſtitution of government. Middleton, created an Earl, a man of abilities, and attached to monarchy, was declared commiſſioner for holding a parliament. The Earl of Glencairn, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed for his parts and good-breeding, was made chancellor. The Earl of Lauderdale, who, from the battle of Worceſter, had been confined in England in different priſons, roſe, by his addreſs, to the office of ſecretary of ſtate. Rothes, a man of dexterity in buſineſs, was made preſident of the council; and the Earl of Crawford was reſtored to his former office of lord-treaſurer<note n="C" place="bottom">Clarendon's life, p. 50.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Proceedings in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> The chancellor, having arrived in Scotland in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of Auguſt 1660, ſummoned a committee of eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates to meet on the 14th of the month, at Edinburgh. Their firſt care was to ſecure the public peace, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining ſome of the heads of the Preſbyterian clergy, who had met to remonſtrate againſt grievances. The commiſſioner opened the parliament, in the end of the year, with a ſpeech, recommending a condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the invaſions on the regal authority, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0709200301:35"/>
of all the ancient prerogatives of the crown. To prevent the return of ſuch calamities as had lately covered the nation, he deſired them to make proviſion for a force to ſecure the public peace. The anſwer of the parliament to the King was full of loyalty and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited ſubmiſſion. They had felt ſeverely the miſeries of the late times, and they aſcribed them to the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the nation to monarchy. The authority of the crown was reſtored, in its utmoſt extent. The power of framing bills was again inveſted in the lords of the articles. An additional revenue of forty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and pounds a-year was granted to the King for life. All the acts that limited the prerogative were repealed<note n="D" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. i. p. 160.</note>. All leagues with foreign nations, not made by the King's authority, were declared treaſonable; by which the famous covenant was rendered null and void. To extinguiſh, if poſſible, the memory of the late troubles, all parliaments held ſince the year 1633 were reſcind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="E" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 162.</note>. The Preſbyterian ſyſtem of church-govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was virtually diſſolved by this act; and all the reſtrictions laid upon the too extenſive power of the crown were at once removed. The meaſure was vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and impolitic. In removing a few of the paſt evils, it eſtabliſhed a dangerous precedent for future times. It was concerted at a feaſt, by the officers of ſtate; and it partook of all the extravagance of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Execution of Argyle.</note> Though Charles had made no promiſe of indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to the Scots, it was neither his temper, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with prudence, to carry his animadverſions on paſt offences into extravagant ſeverity. To make a few examples of puniſhment, after violences that had deſtroyed the ancient conſtitution, ſeemed as neceſſary in Scotland as in England. The Marquis of Argyle, from his delinquency as well as his rank, ſeemed a proper ſacrifice for the crimes of the nobility; and one Guth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, a violent and ſeditious preacher, was pointed out as a ſuitable atonement for the political ſins of the clergy. Argyle was no ſooner informed of the King's arrival, than he haſtened to London. Artful in his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0709200301:36"/>
and full of conciliating addreſs<note n="F" place="bottom">Clarendon's life, p. 53.</note>, he might have gained the eaſy temper of Charles, into an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion of the indignities which he had thrown on him ſelf, as well as the late King. But he was denied the advantage of his inſinuating talents, by a warrant which confined him upon his arrival, to the Tower. Before the meeting of the parliament, he was ſent to Scotland to be tried. The informality of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings againſt him could ſcarce be juſtified by his crimes. He was condemned and executed. His miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes were the leſs regretted, for his barbarity and inſolence to Montroſe. The rudeneſs<note n="G" place="bottom">Clarendon.</note> of the Lord Lorne to the King, when in Scotland, was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got in the puniſhment of his father; and he obtained a gift of the eſtate of his family, which had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited to the crown.

                  <note place="margin">Reflections on</note> The Iriſh nation came down from antiquity, marked with an uncommon ſingularity of political misfortunes. Diſtracted by domeſtic feuds, and labouring under all the miſeries of anarchy, they became, in part, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to England, before either time or accident had poliſhed her own government into preciſion and form. The natural averſion entertained by natives againſt all foreign intruders, combining with the violence and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice inſeparable from conquerors, eſtabliſhed an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity between them, which was augmented by various unfortunate incidents, in the progreſs of time. The opinions of the two nations were as different as their manners and intereſts; and they invariably affected, in every thing, to run into the oppoſite extremes. The converſion of the Engliſh to the Reformed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was ſufficient to induce the Iriſh to adhere to the old ſuperſition. A ſpiritual enmity added its rage to temporal animoſity; and if at any time an appearance of tranquility prevailed, it proceeded from the prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations made to enſure revenge. As long as the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in England retained its force, a kind of a cold and unwilling obedience was paid by Ireland to its
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0709200301:37"/>
laws. But when the reins became relaxed, in the hands of Charles the Firſt, the Iriſh Catholics carried their averſion to the Engliſh race into acts of unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedented barbarity.</p>

Under the ſpecious pretence of revenging the cruelties committed on the Engliſh, Cromwell made large ſtrides toward the extirpation of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. The difficulty of deſtroying a whole nation, more than motives of pity, induced the conqueror to confine to the half of the province of Connaught and the county of Clare the remnant that had eſcaped his ſword. All the Iriſh, under pain of death, were ordered to retire within the allotted pale, on a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain day. Diſeaſe and famine accompanied them to their wretched retreat. But the enemy hovered on their frontier, and prevented their eſcape from miſery. The reſt of the iſland was left to the Engliſh. Some of the old lords and juſt proprietors, being Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, were permitted to retain their poſſeſſions. The lands of the Catholics, now baniſhed into Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naught and Clare, were parcelled out among the adventurers and ſoldiers. The ſpirits of the Iriſh were ſo entirely broken, that this ſummary diviſion of their property was made without exciting a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur. Miſery had arrived at a pitch beyond complaint, and the ſenſe of injuries ſeemed to have vaniſhed with the power of revenge. Ireland remained quiet under the dominion of Cromwell. The enemies of his authority lay ſubdued by his violence; and thoſe whom he had gratified with the ſpoils of the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed, being from principle, as well as fear, averſe from monarchy, were determined to adhere to any ſyſtem that might prevent the reſtoration of the royal family to the throne.</p>

To reform the army, they broke, without any trial, above two hundred officers, who had deſerved well in the ſervice. The Lord Broghill, Sir Charles Coote, Sir Theophilus Jones, and other conſiderable perſons, diſpleaſed with the conduct of the commiſſioners, formed a deſign to ſeize the caſtle of Dublin, which they effected on the thirteenth of December<note n="I" place="bottom">1659.</note>.

It was difficult to do juſtice to any, to ſatisfy all impoſſible.

To find a deputy of high rank was difficult. Lords juſtices, from their number, might be ſwayed by either prejudice or party.

The deſpair of the parties finiſhed happily a buſineſs, wherein the utmoſt efforts of government had failed<note n="U" place="bottom">Clarendon's life, p. 134.</note>. The adventurers and ſoldiers judged that any ſettlement would be better than none. They met together. They found that each, by relinquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome part of what he either claimed or poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, might in ſome degree gratify all.

                  <note place="margin">Portugal match.</note> The attention of Europe followed the good fortune which had eſtabliſhed Charles on the throne of his anceſtors. Though the treaty of the Pyrenees had put an end to open acts of hoſtility between the two rival monarchies of France and Spain, their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient animoſities were rather ſuſpended than extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed. The conteſt was removed from the field, but it ſtill ſubſiſted in the cabinet. Each retained the memory of paſt injuries, under a veil of preſent amity; each wiſhed to gain the friendſhip of a prince
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0709200301:41"/>
whom both had treated with a coldneſs that border<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on diſdain. France, jealous of an ancient enemy, envied to Spain the proſpect of reconquering Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal. Lewis, unwilling to recommence hoſtilities againſt Philip, hoped to ſtop the progreſs of his arms, by rendering Charles a party for the houſe of Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganza. The Portugueſe themſelves perceived no means of ſafety, but in the power of the Engliſh nation. Swayed by her perilous ſituation, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, inſtigated by France, the Queen-regent of Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal ordered her ambaſſador at London to propoſe a marriage between her daughter and Charles. She offered terms that were likely to gain a prince, in whom his neceſſities, and a deſire of poſſeſſing the means of proſecuting his pleaſures, had created a love of money that approached to avarice. The proffered portion was five hundred thouſand pounds in money, the ceſſion of Tangier and Bombay, with a free trade to the Brazils, and the poſſeſſions of Portugal in the Eaſt-Indies<note n="Z" place="bottom">Clarendon's life.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Promoted by Clarendon.</note> Though Charles, from his violent love of pleaſure, was averſe from the reſtraints of marriage, he liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with attention to propoſals of ſuch manifeſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to himſelf and the kingdom. During his exile, he had paid his addreſſes to the ſiſter of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam the Second, Prince of Orange; and ſome of his friends had made overtures in his name to Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Mazarine for his niece, Hortenſia Mancini, whom James the Second calls <q rend="inline">"the moſt beautiful woman in the world<note n="A" place="bottom">James II. 1662.</note>."</q> In the cloud which was ſettled on his fortunes, he was rejected by the friends of both, with circumſtances that bordered on ſcorn. Their opinions changed with his proſperity. Maza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin, in particular, offered his niece, with a vaſt ſum of money; but both were with a compliment, refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="B" place="bottom">Ibid. 1661.</note>. The King's affections were now too much diſſipated to fix upon one object; and he valued leſs the beauty than the convenience of a wife. Catharine of Portugal derived to him a recommendation from
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0709200301:42"/>
her very imperfections. The reported narrowneſs of her underſtanding would prevent her from interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in matters of ſtate<note n="C" place="bottom">Clarendon's Life.</note>; and the homelineſs of her perſon might furniſh an excuſe for a breach of fidelity to her bed. Clarendon, if ever averſe from the match, promoted it afterwards with all his credit; either gained by the arts of France, or in oppoſition to others, who hoped to govern Charles through a queen of their own recommendation<note n="D" place="bottom">James II. 1662.</note>. He remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is certain, every obſtacle which aroſe in the courſe of the treaty; and though he, probably, had no ſiniſter deſigns in the meaſure, he by it furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his enemies with the means of his ruin<note n="E" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

Alarmed at the new enemy, which ſeemed to threaten his maſter, this miniſter broke out with a violence more ſuitable to his temper than to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. He wrote to Philip. He remonſtrated to Charles<note n="G" place="bottom">March 28, 1661.</note>. He mixed threats with advantageous propoſals<note n="H" place="bottom">Clarendon's life, p. 87, 88.</note>. He conveyed to the King diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous accounts of the perſon of his propoſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſort. He informed him of her ſuppoſed ſterility, an opinion even then generally received. The under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining policy of France defeated the open vehemence of Spain. The offer of a large portion made by the latter was rejected for the ſecret promiſe of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable ſum of money by the former. The King himſelf was more inclined to an union with the French, than with the court of Spain. The memory of former ſlights died with their author, Cardinal Mazarin, who had expired on the ninth of March<note n="I" place="bottom">Hiſtoire de France, tom. iii. 1661.</note>, after a lingering illneſs. Impreſſed with the dread and jealouſy of the power of an Engliſh parliament, Charles hoped to derive ſecurity to his own autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity

from the friendſhip of France<note n="K" place="bottom">Carte's Ormonde, vol. ii. p 252.</note>.

Fouquet, who had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, after the death of the Cardinal, to the moſt credit with Lewis, diſpatched an agent to England, to confirm Charles in his reſolution of marrying the Infanta of Portugal. The buſineſs was too important to be truſted to the common line of embaſſy. The meſſenger was La Baſtide. He brought a credential letter to the chancellor, and communicated to that miniſter his inſtructions. To encourage Charles to aid the Portugueſe, Lewis <q rend="inline">"offered an immediate payment of three hundred thouſand piſtoles, with a promiſe of a future proviſion proportionable to the charge. He complained of the pride of the Dutch. He reminded Charles of their inſolence to himſelf in his adverſity. He propoſed a communication of councils between the two crowns; he expreſſed the propriety of reducing theſe haughty republicans to a juſt ſenſe of the deference which they owed to crowned heads."</q> To theſe propoſals to the King, la Baſtide added the offer of a preſent to the chancellor. Clarendon rejected with a degree of indignation what reſpected to himſelf of the propoſitions of France<note n="L" place="bottom">Clarendon's life, p. 92.</note>. He was not, however, ſo delicate with regard to his maſter's honour. In the courſe of a correſpondence with Fouquet, he aſked for Charles the loan of fifty thouſand pounds. When the fall of that miniſter happened, in the month of September<note n="M" place="bottom">Hiſt. de France, tom. iii. 1661.</note>, Lewis returned all his letters to Clarendon; but he, at the ſame time, wrote to him, <q rend="inline">"from that time to communicate with all freedom with D'Eſtrades, who reſided at London, in quality of his ambaſſador."</q> In the courſe of the chancellor's correſpondence with

On the twenty-third of April, the King was crowned at Weſtmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter with uncommon ſplendour. In the joy which attended the ceremony, party diſtinctions were forgot. The former enemies of monarchy mixed in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion with its faſteſt friends. Denzil Hollis, one of the five members whom the late King attempted to ſeize in the houſe of commons, was created a baron upon this occaſion. Sir Anthony Aſhley Cooper, whoſe parts and verſatility were, even then, well known, was raiſed to the peerage, by the title of Lord Aſhley. Anneſly, preſident of the late council of ſtate, a man of accommodating principles, was created Earl of Angleſey. The royaliſts themſelves were not neglected in the article of honours. Sir John Grenville was made Earl of Bath, and Sir George Booth Lord Delamere. Ingoldſby, whoſe hand appeared at the warrant for the execution of the late King, walked, as a knight of the Bath, at the coronation of his ſon. Recent ſervices had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned for his former demerits.

The prudent management of Charles, and the public joy which naturally attended a legal ſettlement, after ſo many troubles and diſaſters, diffuſed an affection for monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy through the nation. The loyalty of the people appeared manifeſt in their choice of repreſentatives. The popularity of the court prevailed more with the

The principles of the houſe of commons were known before they met. The moſt of the members were men at once well affected to the church of England and to monarchy, whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts appeared inſeparable, ſince they fell by the ſame hands.

They confiſcated the eſtates of twenty-one Regicides deceaſed<note n="B" place="bottom">Journals.</note>. The Lord Monſon, Sir Harry Mildmay, and Sir James Harrington, were by a bill deprived of their honours and eſtates.

With the power of the crown, they reſtored the dignity of the church. The act which exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the biſhops from their ſeats was repealed.

The inſolence of the petty ſtates of Barbary, particularly the depredations of the Algerines, induced the King to ſend the Earl of Sandwich with a fleet to the Mediterranean. He arrived on the twenty-ninth of July in the port of

Algier. He ſummoned the Dey to come out and confirm the league made with England. A treaty was begun; but the terms offered by thoſe pirates were ſo inſolent and exorbitant, that the admiral weighed and ſtood into the harbour.

The conteſt was for power and influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the leaders quarrelled upon trifles.

The expedition of Lambert againſt Sir George Booth, his preparations againſt Monk in the North, the embezzlements which are common in times of confuſion, had totally drained the maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines for the uſe of the army; and the fitting out of the fleet, which had attended the King on his return, exhauſted the naval ſtores. Though the army conſiſted, at the reſtoration, of ſixty thouſand men, there were not three thouſand ſtands of fire-arms in the public arſenals; and, at a time that an hundred ſhips were at ſea, there ſcarce remained ſtores in the ports ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to equip five<note n="H" place="bottom">Clarendon's life, p. 146.

Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the late confuſions all magiſtrates liable to ſuſpicion of diſaffection to the prevailing powers were expelled their reſpective corporations. Proofs of affection to the ruling junto, and a ſubſcription of the covenant, were qualifications neceſſary for holding an office in a corporate body. To remove ſuch dangerous perſons from all authority, bore at leaſt the appearance of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical prudence; and the parliament empowered the King to appoint commiſſioners to examine into the ſtate of the magiſtracy in the different corporations, to expel thoſe of doubtful principles, and ſuch as had intruded themſelves by violence<note n="M" place="bottom">Hume, vol. vii.</note>.

The nation, though returned to its ancient political principles, was not yet become ſufficiently cool from the fervour of religious zeal. Without philoſophy to ſeparate ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual opinions from their temporal concerns, men car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried reſentment and animoſity into debates, which, by a ſtrange perverſion of their ſubject, have ſeldom been managed with common decency. The friends of epiſcopal hierarchy, though very warm in promoting the bill, were not its only ſupporters in its progreſs through both houſes. The Preſbyterians, deſtined to diſappointments in their views, were oppoſed, by the joint concurrence of other ſectaries. The Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendents were their ancient enemies. They had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended the republicans, by contributing to the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of monarchy. The high-flying Royaliſts, in whom a zeal for the crown was a kind of religion, forgot not former demerits in their recent ſervices. The firſt they conſidered as flowing from principle; the latter they attributed more to a change occaſioned by the temper of the times, than to an alteration in their political ſentiments. The Roman-Catholics to a dread of an union between the Proteſtants, added their abhorrence of a ſyſtem of church-government ſo oppoſite to their own. All parties ſeemed to concur in ruining the Preſbyterians, by a law which the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate muſt have deemed ſevere. The King, in his indifference for religious forms, looked upon the debates in both houſes with ſeeming unconcern. But
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0709200301:53"/>
his attention and eaſy acceſs to the Preſbyterians had raiſed their hopes of an indulgence to a pitch, which a man of more ſcrupulous morals than Charles could ſcarce reconcile to his tacit acquieſcence in ſuch harſh meaſures in his parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Its ſeverity.</note> Though the ſcheme of a comprehenſion, adopted by the King in the preceding year, promiſed no ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, it ought, perhaps, to have ſuggeſted to the church-party a greater latitude in the terms of their communion. Inſtead of ſhewing any inclination to comprehend the Preſbyterians, they turned the whole force of the act againſt the favourite tenets of that ſect. The intereſt of individuals ſeemed, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, to combine with a zeal for the ancient rites of the church. Several of the followers of the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian ſyſtem were poſſeſſed of livings conſiderable in their value; whilſt many of the epiſcopal clergy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in want, for their adherence to their religious principles. The bill of uniformity left no room for evaſion, to the leaſt tender conſciences, without the danger of ſacrificing the character of conſiſtency to motives of intereſt. The act required, that every clergyman, to render him capable of holding a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefice, ſhould poſſeſs epiſcopal ordination; ſhould aſſent to every thing contained in the book of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-prayer; ſhould take the oath of canonical obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, abjure the covenant, and renounce the taking arms, on any pretence whatſoever, againſt the King. Theſe conditions were more apt to confirm men in their former opinions, than to bring them within the pale of the church. The political prejudices enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Clarendon againſt the Preſbyterians added force, upon this occaſion, to his attachment to the church. Though Charles had been treated with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity in Scotland by the followers of preſbytery, he was as forgetful of injuries as he was of favours; and he ſeems to have been ſwayed entirely by his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, in agreeing to an act which infringed his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration from Breda. The ſubterfuge of regulating the promiſed indulgence by the advice and authority of parliament, ſuited more with the nice diſtinctions of a lawyer, than the comprehenſive ideas of a great ſtateſman.</p>

The command and diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the militia, which had been ſeparated from the crown in the late reign, was reſtored, in the moſt am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple manner, to the King. But though they placed the ſword in his hands, they were frugal in beſtowing the means of uſing it with effect. Debates on the act of uniformity, and even tedious altercations on private bills<note n="X" place="bottom">Clarendon's life.</note>, diverted long the attention of the commons from all conſideration of any other buſineſs. The impatience of Charles for the ſettlement of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue was equal to the preſſure of his debts. To recal the attention of the commons to this neceſſary buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he ſent for them, on the firſt of March, to Whitehall<note n="Y" place="bottom">Journals of the commons, March 1.</note>, and, in a moſt obliging ſpeech, laid before them his neceſſities, and preſſed them for a preſent ſupply. A bill immediately paſſed the houſe, to enable the King to raiſe ſeventy thouſand pounds a-month, for the three enſuing years. Two ſhillings a-year on every fire-hearth in the kingdom were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, during the life of the King, to this tax. A con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant revenue of twelve hundred thouſand pounds was ſettled on the crown; with a declaration, that if the funds upon which this ſum was charged ſhould appear inadequate, the commons would at another meeting make up the deficiency. Charles was at the time ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied; but ſucceeding emergencies, deficiencies in the funds, and his own want of oeconomy, convinced him that the ſum was too ſmall. To theſe ſupplies to the King the commons added an act of gratitude to his friends. They appointed ſixty thouſand pounds to be diſtributed among the poor cavaliers<note n="Z" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>; a ſum in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficient to remove their wants; but as little expected from the gratitude, as it was from the power of the crown<note n="A" place="bottom">Journals, paſſim.</note>.</p>

Corbet was of a good family, and bred to the law. Okey, from being firſt a drayman, and afterwards a chandler, became an officer of rank, abilities, and character. But Bark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, though raiſed to ſome conſequence by his talent at leading mobs, carried through all his actions the vulgarity of his original profeſſion of a thimble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker. Being brought to the bar of the King's Bench, and their identity being proved, they were condemned on the act of attainder; and executed, on the nineteenth of April, at Tyburn. Being all men of courage, they behaved with decency and firmneſs in their laſt moments; and, though they ſuffered for public crimes, they juſtified themſelves from acts of private injuſtice and oppreſſion. Downing, who was formerly a preacher in Okey's regiment, derived no reputation from his activity<note n="P" place="bottom">Kennet's Regiſter.</note>.

                  <note place="margin">Trial of Vane</note> Sir Henry Vane and Colonel Lambert, in purſuance of an addreſs of the houſe of commons, were, on the fourth of June, arraigned for high treaſon at the bar of the King's Bench<note n="Q" place="bottom">Kennet's Regiſter.</note>. The carriage of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners differed not more from each other, than it was oppoſite to their own known characters. Vane, tho' naturally timid, behaved with a confidence and bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which bordered on inſolence. Lambert, formerly renowned for his courage, was full of a ſubmiſſion, which might have been conſtrued into fear. Vane, though an enthuſiaſt in religion, was a man of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in civil affairs. He offered ſeveral matters in arreſt of judgment. He defended himſelf with arguments more deciſive in theory, than ſuitable to the ideas of the prevailing powers. The indictment againſt him com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended none of his actions during the life of the late King; and he ought not, in ſtrict juſtice, he affirmed, to be arraigned for want of fidelity to a Prince, who, tho' <hi>de jure,</hi> was not <hi>de facto</hi> King. A ſovereign, he urged, who cannot defend from injuries, has no right to puniſh his ſubjects for diſobedience; allegiance and ſubmiſſion being the price of protection, and not the inherent property of the chief magiſtrate. If com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the government of a commonwealth was a crime, it was, he added, only common to him with the nation; and he knew not, in that latitude of guilt, who was innocent enough to condemn him for treaſon. He denied his being acceſſary to the death the late King. He mentioned as a merit, that he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the violence and tyranny of Cromwell<note n="R" place="bottom">Trial printed by his friends</note>. He inſiſted, that as the two houſes of parliament had joined in a petition for his life, to which the King agreed, this concurrence of the legiſlative power had the ſorce of an act of parliament. He diſplayed in his trial the known character of the reſt of his life; a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0709200301:59"/>
great acuteneſs of underſtanding, mixed with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagance that bordered upon folly.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">and Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert.</note> Lambert, though modeſt in his defence, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with Vane. The firſt, however, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prieved at the bar, and confined for life to the iſland of Guernſey, where he continued in obſcure tranqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity above thirty years. A principle of ambition, more than any averſion to monarchy, was the ſource of Lambert's activity in the late troubles. He had intended, when he eſcaped from the tower, in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of April 1660, to have declared for the King, and to have precluded Monk from the rewards which he derived from the reſtoration of monarchy<note n="S" place="bottom">Kennet.</note>. He lived a concealed Papiſt<note n="T" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, and he died in the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh communion. Vane's preſumptuous behaviour at his trial was the cauſe aſſigned for his execution. The blood of the Earl of Strafford ſeems, however, to have been required at his hands. The virulence and activity with which he perſecuted that unfortunate nobleman, rendered his own fate leſs regretted. His enthuſiaſm ſupplied, in his latter moments, his want of natural courage, and he ſuffered with a firmneſs which argued that he acted from principle. When he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſpeak to the people, his voice was drowned with the noiſe of trumpets and drums<note n="Y" place="bottom">Trial.</note>; a mean piece of policy, which did more harm than ought to have been dreaded from the ſpeech of Vane.</p>

Both ſides had carried their arguments to the preſs; both endeavoured to juſtify before the people their cauſe. The church ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued for the convenience of one form of worſhip. The Preſbyterians exclaimed againſt impoſing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints upon conſcience by law. The favourers of epiſcopacy repreſented the danger of introducing new doctrines by an extemporary ſervice. The adherents

of preſbytery were loud againſt the obſervance of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, of which, as unneceſſary to religion, they could not approve. The abettors of the act affirmed, that it was unjuſt that men, who believed not the doctrines of the church, ſhould enjoy its revenues. The oppoſers of the law inſiſted, that orthodoxy of faith depended not upon forms. The firſt ſaid, that the conference at the Savoy had ſhewn the diſpoſition of the Diſſenters to quarrel. The latter replied, that the violence of the churchmen promoted ſchiſms, by forcing men of tender conſciences to ſet up ſeparate congregations. The one ſide ſhewed the neceſſity of an union of opinions. The other declared an union of charity to be ſufficient. The church ſpoke of the covenant, as the ſeed of rebellions. The Preſbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians urged, that it ſecured the juſt rights of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, as well as the religious privileges of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. The firſt inſiſted, that the Diſſenters were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders upon the livings of the church. The latter derived an argument, favourable to themſelves, from their poſſeſſing thoſe livings for many years. Both had their reaſons, but neither party was free from prejudice.

The neceſſities into which he was early plunged, through the narrowneſs of his revenue and his own bad management, brought, at length, his character forward to view. The firſt meaſure that ſeemed to raiſe the diſtruſt of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects was the ſale of Dunkirk.

upon every proſpect of relief from pecuniary diſtreſs. Precluded by the treaty with Portugal from diſpoſing of the place to Spain<note n="A" place="bottom">Treaty of marriage.</note>, Charles made his firſt offer to France, as early as the month of June<note n="B" place="bottom">D'Eſtrades.</note>.

                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note> The ſale of Dunkirk, though ſtigmatized as one of the worſt meaſures of the reign of Charles, was leſs excuſable, as a mark of meanneſs in the King, than for its detriment to the nation. The charge of maintaining it was very conſiderable, and the profit ariſing from it extremely ſmall. It had no port to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive veſſels of burden; no harbour where ſhips of war could ride with ſafety. Weak to the land, and eaſily blocked up by ſea, it would be difficult to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, but it might be commanded with eaſe. The keeping of Dunkirk, it was apprehended, might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the King in a war. France looked upon it with an eye of jealouſy; Spain had demanded its reſtitution, as unjuſtly ſeized by the late protector<note n="G" place="bottom">MSS.</note>. Theſe were the arguments offered to ſatisfy the nation; others had ſtill greater weight with the King. His cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers were empty, and his debts were great. The par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimony of parliament ſuited but ill with his profuſion;
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0709200301:62"/>
and his late acquiſitions, inſtead of bringing him pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, burdened his revenue with expence. The two hundred thouſand crowns received, in the beginning of the year, from France to ſupport Portugal, were already expended upon the forces ſent, in the month of June, to the latter kingdom. His ſiſter had been married near eighteen months to the Duke of Orleans, and her portion was not hitherto paid. Theſe were the urgent reaſons which weighed with Charles. The relief was trifling, and the loſs of reputation, which aroſe from the meaſure, great. But he was a ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift in politics, as well as in money. He purchaſed a moment of preſent eaſe with years of future diſtreſs.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Quarrels at court</note> During tranſactions in which the public were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned, the private happineſs of Charles was diſturbed by domeſtic diſtractions, which proceeded from his own vices and weakneſſes. Given to women and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to debauchery, he was either the dupe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning miſtreſſes, or converted into a tool by profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate men. Through a kind of vicious gratitude, he could refuſe no favour to the firſt. He was governed by the latter through the eaſineſs of a lively temper, that ſacrificed every thing to mirth. Though a man of abilities, he hated buſineſs, becauſe it interfered with his amuſements. He followed ſenſuality with an avidity which is apt to deſtroy pleaſure, by enjoying it beyond meaſure. Deſtitute of religion, he dropt its appearance; and by aſſociating with the diſſolute, he became an example and encourager of debauchery and vice. His good ſenſe and underſtanding yielded the reins to a thoughtleſs extravagance. His virtues, for he had ſome, came ſeldom in view, as he baniſhed morality from trifles. The Queen, inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming him from his immoderate love of women, fixed him for ever in his infidelity, by her peeviſhneſs. His miniſter, though a man of abilities and virtue, was harſh and ſevere in his diſpoſition, and more apt to irritate than perſuade a prince, whoſe happineſs chiefly conſiſted in good-humour and indolence. He ſought for relief againſt both, in the company of diſſolute perſons of either ſex. He avoided the dark melancholy of Catharine in the company of Barbara

Though ſhe had borne to him a ſon, the King, contrary to all decency and politeneſs, ſuffered himſelf to be perſuaded to deſire the Queen to admit her near her perſon<note n="K" place="bottom">Clarendon's life.</note>. When the Queen refuſed this requeſt, with the indignation natural to a woman whoſe perſon is deſpiſed, Clarendon was employed to ſoothe her into conſent; an office more agreeable to his love of his maſter's repoſe, than ſuitable to the dignity of his ſtation and character. His behaviour during this odd negotiation, inſtead of removing the former prejudices entertained againſt him by the favourite, added fury to her reſentment. At a time that he endeavoured to perſuade the Queen to admit her into her ſervice, he forbade his own wife to return her viſits<note n="L" place="bottom">James II. 1662.</note>; an inſult to the laſt degree unpardonable in a woman's eyes. The dignified demeanour of the Ducheſs of York, who would never admit any of the King's miſtreſſes into her preſence, was conſtrued into haughtineſs, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to her father.

Sir Harry Bennet, keeper of the privy purſe, profited by it the firſt<note n="N" place="bottom">Clarendon's life, p. 193.</note>. By the intrigues of the Counteſs, he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded Sir Edward Nicholas as ſecretary of ſtate, on the ſecond of October. Nicholas, worn out in the ſervice of the crown, received a gratuity worth twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thouſand pounds for his reſignation<note n="O" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>; a ſum unequal to his ſervices, but too great for thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from his succeſſor. Though Clarendon, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, regretted that his old friend Nicholas ſhould retire, there is reaſon to believe he was not very averſe to Bennet's promotion. Jealous of the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of Sir Charles Berkley with the King, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Bennet againſt him, upon his return from Spain; and, after Bennet had accepted the ſeals, he paid an attention to the chancellor which bore the appearance of gratitude. Clarendon's ſupport of Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net proceeded, however, from policy, and not from friendſhip. He ſuſpected him to be a Catholic.—Though he knew that he had abilities, he was no ſtranger to his want of principle. The coldneſs which aroſe between them, from Bennet's attention to the favourite miſtreſs, was gradually improved into a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual averſion. Clarendon had many enemies raiſed by envy; he had ſeveral created by diſguſt. Bennet joined himſelf ſecretly to both, and the chancellor ceaſed to be abſolute in the cabinet. He was now deprived of almoſt all his friends. Southampton, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a bad ſtate of health, began to withdraw from the court.

The aſſociations among the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian clergy, joined to the rigid ſeverity with which the act of uniformity had been put in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, raiſed clamours and complaints, which Charles, by an inconſiderate ſtep, endeavoured to remove. In their uninterrupted acceſs to his preſence, the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians had received repeated promiſes of his protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, on the twenty-ſixth of December<note n="Q" place="bottom">Public Intell. Dec. 26, 1662.</note>, he iſſued a declaration, as head of the church, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing with the penalties impoſed by the act of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. The Proteſtant Diſſenters owed, however, this indulgence more to the interceſſion of the Earl of Briſtol, who conſidered himſelf as head of the Papiſts, than to the King's favour. That nobleman, excluded from office by his religion, endeavoured to ſecure an influence at court for his friends<note n="R" place="bottom">James II. 1662.</note>. He gained the favour of the Counteſs of Caſtlemain by deſerting his old friend the chancellor. She im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the coldneſs which had ariſen between them concerning the King's marriage, into that animoſity which ſoon after broke out into ſuch violence on the ſide of Briſtol. The King himſelf had ſhewn him ſuch countenance, that he gave, at his recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a regiment of horſe to the Earl of Oxford, who then pretended to his daughter<note n="S" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Though Charles knew Briſtol too well to truſt him in doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful affairs<note n="T" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, he followed his advice in a matter to which he was already inclined.

The commons, after ſettling theſe religious matters, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded to examine the ſtanding revenue of the crown. They had promiſed to make it twelve hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds a year; but the funds upon which that ſum had been charged had failed. Notwithſtanding the price received through the ſale of Dunkirk, the King's coffers were again empty. Oeconomy prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in no department of the ſtate<note n="Z" place="bottom">James II. 1663.</note>; nor was the profuſion of Charles diminiſhed. Had even the funds, upon which his revenue was charged, anſwered the expectations of parliament, the amount would have been inſufficient for the neceſſary diſburſements of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. The ſum annually ſaved by the ſale of Dunkirk was ſcarce more than one-third of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney expended yearly on Tangier. An extraordinary ſupply was neceſſary. The King ſent for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, on the twelfth of June, to Whitehall<note n="A" place="bottom">Journals.</note>. He complained of their inattention to his revenue; and, by acquainting them of a conſpiracy to ſeize the caſtle of Dublin, he hoped to furniſh a reaſon for demanding a preſent ſupply. Four ſubſidies were immediately voted, though the previous queſtion was only carried by a ſmall majority<note n="B" place="bottom">159 againſt 111.</note>.</p>

had experienced the royal bounty to a conſiderable degree, his profuſion had reduced him to diſtreſs. Having aſked a favour, which Charles did not think fit to beſtow, he flew out into expreſſions of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extravagance. He accuſed him of his exceſſes and debauchery, of his careleſſneſs in buſineſs, of his neglect of his friends. Theſe charges were true, and, therefore, the more ſevere, and leſs apt to be pardoned.

On the eighth of June 1663 was fought the memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable battle of Amexial, near Evora, which eſtabliſhed the independence of Portugal. The Portugueſe owed the honour and advantage of this important victory to the valour of an Engliſh regiment, led by Lieutenant-Colonel Hunt. Aſcending with unparallelled ſpirit and impetuoſity a ſteep hill, on which Don John himſelf was poſted with the flower of the Spaniſh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fantry, they routed him with great ſlaughter, ſeized his cannon, his tents, and his rich baggage.

Lewis, to whom ambition was the beſt reaſon for violence, alledged the Duke's negligence in adhering to the treaty of Montmartre, as the ground of his invaſion. Marſal was inveſted by the armies of France. The Duke, unable to combat with ſuch odds, ſigned a treaty at Nomeni, on the firſt of September 1663, by which he yielded Marſal to the King, in return for the reſt of his dominions, which were, on that condition, reſtored. The injuſtice of Lewis to his more feeble neighbours had not yet raiſed the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of thoſe ſtates who alone could put bounds to his ambition. The negotiations of the two preceding years diſcovered to him, that a well-timed ſupply to Charles would prevent all obſtacles to his deſigns from England; and the Dutch, ſplit even then into two great factions at home, ſuffered themſelves to be ſwayed from the apparent intereſts of their nation abroad, by their domeſtic feuds. The German branch of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily of Auſtria ſuffered in their importance from the fall of the power of Spain, as well as from internal cauſes, co-operating with the undeciſive councils of the Emperor Leopold. The idea of a balance of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, which ſubſiſted during the greatneſs of Spain, and which afterwards roſe upon the ambition of Lewis, was ſcarce at this time, an object of policy; and the experience of almoſt an age ought to convince Europe, that ſhe honoured France too much, in being afraid of her arms. Lewis himſelf had hitherto given no great cauſe of jealouſy. In deference to the peaceable policy of Mazarin, he had, till the death of that miniſter, carefully concealed the love of glory, to which he after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſacrificed prudence as well as juſtice.</p>

The earl of Middleton, through the intrigues of Lauderdale, gave place as commiſſioner to the Earl of Rothes. On the eighteenth of June, the parliament met at Edinburgh. They condemned to death Arch. Johnſton, commonly called Laird of Wariſton, who had been very active during the late times, and was the only Scotſman who was a member of the famous committee of ſafety. He was executed at the croſs of Edinburgh on the twenty-ſecond of July; behaving with more ſpirit than was expected, from the known timidity of his mind. A national ſynod of a peculiar kind was conſtituted for the regulation of eccleſiaſtical affairs. It formed a medium between the Preſbyterian aſſembly of the church and the Engliſh convocation. This ſynod was to aſſemble at ſuch time and place as the King ſhould appoint by proclamation; and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of ſuch matters, relating to the government and doctrine of the church, as his Majeſty ſhould deliver to his commiſſioner, without whoſe preſence they were not permitted to meet. This confuſion of the modes of Preſbytery with the conſtitution of prelacy, roſe from the mixed character of Lauderdale, who joined an attachment to the covenant to principles favourable to an unlimited monarchy. He had attended Rothes, whom he could not truſt, to Scotland; and held him in dependence more ſuitable to his own arrogance, than the high character of his friend<note n="P" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. i. p. 284.</note>.</p>

Though ſome part of the confuſion which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted that iſland had been removed, things were far from being yet reſtored to tranquillity and order. The third act of ſettlement, which paſſed in September, was ſo far from being equal to the purpoſe, that it was immediately followed by a bill of explanation. To this diſorder in civil concerns were added the lord-lieutenant's well-grounded fears of the army. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied himſelf to purge the troops; but the bills lately paſſed had brought no money into the exchequer to
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0709200301:75"/>
pay their arrears. Though the Duke raiſed, on his private credit, the ſums neceſſary for a work which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of no delay, his precautions prevented not a formidable conſpiracy for ſeizing the caſtle of Dublin, in the beginning of the ſummer of 1663<note n="R" place="bottom">Carte's Ormonde.</note>.

A few examples of juſtice ſtruck a terror into the reſt; but tho' the nation was quiet, the very ſtillneſs ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to threaten a ſtorm. The diſaffection of the ſoldiers continued.

The affair of the long parliament, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, was already ſettled; but he confeſſed, that tho' there was no colour for the fancy of the determination of the preſent parliament, he was ſurpriſed that they had not taken into conſideration a bill which paſſed in times as careleſs of the ſecurity of the people, as they were of the dignity of the crown. He prayed the commons to reviſe the bill. He declared his unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble affection for parliaments; and he concluded this part of his ſpeech with aſſuring them, if he thought otherwiſe, he would never ſuffer a parliament to meet
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0709200301:76"/>
by the means preſcribed by that bill. He thanked both houſes for their late ſupply; but he complained, that it had fallen much ſhort of what either he expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or they intended. He affirmed, that the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popular tax, the exciſe, was the leaſt beneficial to the crown; and he ſignified his wiſh, to collect and huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band the chimney-tax by officers of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<note n="U" place="bottom">Journals of both houſes.</note>.</p>

the middle ſtature, well ſhaped, very nervous, active, and ſtrong. His face was rather long, his complexion fair, his countenance engaging; but his outward car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage was a little ſtiff and conſtrained; and he was not ſo gracious as he was obliging and courteous. He was affable in his converſation, eaſy of acceſs; and though ſometimes exact in the uſe of the ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, an enemy to formality. Having a heſitation in his ſpeech, his diſcourſe was not graceful. But upon thoſe ſubjects which he ſtudied the moſt, his obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were judicious and ſolid<note n="Z" place="bottom">Continuation of the Life of James II. MS. Scot. Coll.

His perſonal courage was undoubted; and in the department of war, which be ſtudied the moſt, he was far from being deſtitute of conduct. His chief praiſe conſiſted in a ſtrict adherence to truth in all he ſaid. Sincere in his profeſſions, and minutely obſerving his word, he was reſpected by thoſe whom he favoured the leaſt: but his uncomplying diſpoſition prevented him from being ever loved. Though not a warm, he was a firm friend; and though an unforgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was an open enemy. He affected to guide his actions by principle, to be directed in all his opinions by reaſon. This was the great defect of his mind. His circumſcribed abilities often prevented him from judging right; and, miſtaking obſtinacy for firmneſs, he ſeldom availed himſelf of the counſels of others. His lofty notions of regal authority rendered him an obſequious, rather than a good ſubject, while it made him unfit for the office of a limited king. A lover of decency and good order, he was unexpenſive in his
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0709200301:78"/>
diſpoſition, but far removed from avarice. He was frequently unjuſt to men in their ſpeculative opinions, never with regard to their property. His virtues, upon the whole, though not ſplendid, were obvious; his vices were few, and they lay concealed. In the earlier part of his brother's reign he was reſpected by indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals and highly eſteemed by the nation; and even after the folly, or rather madneſs, of his religious zeal was known, he was more feared than deſpiſed.</p>

The fleet, which had carried the glory of England to a high pitch under Cromwell, was neglected in the changes and revolutions which ſucceeded the death of that able deſpot<note n="B" place="bottom">James II. 1663.</note>. At the reſtoration, the naval ſtores were exhauſted, and the magazines almoſt empty<note n="C" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The ſums granted by the convention-parliament were inadequate to the old debts of the navy, much leſs to repair its preſent wants. Of the twelve hundred thouſand pounds voted by the commons in the end of the year 1661, eight hundred thouſand were applied by the King to the uſe of the fleet. Charles, as well as his brother, loved and underſtood maritime affairs. They were both fond of commerce, and they reſolved to ſupport it againſt the encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of foreign powers. The Eaſt-India, Turkey, Hamburgh, Canary, and other companies were encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged and protected. A new African company was formed under the auſpices of the Duke of York, to ſupply the Weſt-India iſlands with ſlaves<note n="D" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. With an eagerneſs ſuitable to his temper, he purſued every meaſure to eſtabliſh this branch of commerce on a durable and advantageous foundation. He procured the ſecret of dying cloths in Holland; he deceived the natives of Guinea, by giving the ſame ſmell to the goods in packing as the Dutch uſed to do at Leyden<note n="E" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. He divided his time between the city, the admiralty, and the parliament. He preſided at every meeting of

The Duke of York, as governor of the new African company, had obtained two ſhips from the King, which, together with two armed veſſels belonging to the company, he ſubmitted to the command of Sir Robert Holmes. That officer, having received inſtructions to protect the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the Engliſh, and to check the inſolence and encroaching diſpoſition of the Dutch, directed his courſe to Cape Verde. He ſeized that fort, he retook Cormantin, he placed garriſons in both, and eſtabliſhed factories along the coaſt. Soon after, the Duke hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing obtained a grant of a tract of land lying between New-England and Maryland, which the Dutch, during the late troubles, had ſeized, obtained again two ſhips from the King. Theſe, under the command of Sir Richard Nicholas, ſailed, with three hundred men on board, to take poſſeſſion of the country. The Dutch yielded the place without bloodſhed, and moſt of the ſettlers remained under the Engliſh government.

The jealouſy againſt the Dutch commerce, which prevailed among the merchants of London, carried daily complaints to the ears of the Duke of York, who had added a deſire of diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf in a war<note n="K" place="bottom">Clarendon.</note>, to his natural averſion to every republican government. The nation itſelf, from the repetition of inſults, took fire; and the commons entered into all the vehemence of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents.

He arrived on the twenty-fifth of June; but the time for negotiation was paſt. Little hopes of peace remained on either ſide; and, therefore, both had taken previous ſteps toward an open rupture. The Engliſh made the firſt motion towards hoſtilities. The Duke of York had, in May, diſpatched Holmes with a powerful ſquadron to the coaſt of Africa. The States, on this emergency, placed a kind of dictato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial power in the hands of the penſionary De Wit<note n="L" place="bottom">James II. 1664.</note>. Upon intelligence of the expedition of Holmes, he

ordered De Ruyter to follow with thirteen ſhips of war. De Ruyter, in conjunction with the Engliſh admiral, Sir Thomas Lawſon, was then employed in the Streights againſt the ſtates of Barbary.

He received orders to intercept De Ruyter; but intelligence arriving that the States prepared a greater force under Opdam, the Duke of York joined the Prince with a reinforcement of ſhips in November. Opdam laid up his fleet for the winter; and the Duke, after a cruize of a few days, in which he took the Dutch fleet from Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux, returned to Spithead.

The Duke of York, on the fifteenth of March, repaired to Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fleet, the general rendezvous of the ſhips, to haſten the equipment of the fleet; but it was not in five weeks ready to put to ſea. The Duke, to whom ſuch buſineſs was amuſement, employed the time in ſettling the order of battle and rank of the commanders. Though the Engliſh had been ſo ſucceſsful at ſea under Cromwell, they fought without order, and owed their victories more to their valour than to their ſkill. The Duke was the firſt who drew up the fleet in a line. In the firſt week of May, he ſailed in the Royal Charles, at the head of ninety-eight ſhips of war, the greateſt fleet ever ſent by England to ſea. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to viſit the Dutch on their coaſt, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chored at the mouth of the Texel. The enemy, afraid of a landing, erected beacons along the coaſt; but the Duke was forced, by ſtreſs of weather, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to Gunfleet to refit. On the thirtieth of May, as the wind, being eaſterly, might bring the Dutch on the Engliſh coaſt, he ſailed, making all the uſe he could of the tide; yet it was the firſt of June before he could anchor in Southwold Bay. About one o'clock, the Dutch fleet, under Opdam, appeared to windward, conſiſting of one hundred and thirteen men of war, eleven fire-ſhips, and ſeven yachts. The wind, which continued eaſterly, fell towards evening; ſo that, though both fleets uſed all their ſails, little way could be made<note n="R" place="bottom">James II. 1665.</note>.</p>

He kept about two leagues from the enemy, till he was joined by his whole fleet; and the weather becoming calm in the cloſe of the evening, he lay all night about eight leagues to the eaſt of Leoſtoff. About two in the morning, the Dutch were ſeen lighting their matches, and preparing for action; all in a line, and in the ſame order with the

Engliſh. At day-break a freſh gale aroſe, and the Engliſh got the wind. The Dutch van came up at three, and the fight began, when an untoward acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent deprived the Duke of the advantage of his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. He ordered the ſignal to be given for the whole fleet to tack; but the ſailor ſent up the maſt was ſo long in unfurling the flag, that, before he could let it fly, Opdam with his van had bore up round, ſhip after ſhip, and brought his ſtarboard tacks on board. The Duke ſtopt the ſignal, leſt it ſhould put the whole fleet in diſorder; and inſtead of bearing up round, tacked only when it came to his turn. Six hours were loſt by this little accident; for had the-ſignal been given, both fleets would have their larboard tacks on board, and have ſtood toward the coaſt of England; ſo that the Dutch, upon giving way, would, as the Duke intended, have a greater run to make to their own coaſt<note n="S" place="bottom">James II. 1665.</note>.</p>

The ſea was ſmooth, and not a cloud to be ſeen in the ſky. The Duke of York bore down upon Opdam, and a furious battle began. The Earl of Falmouth, the Lord Muſkerry, and Mr. Boyle, as they ſtood on the quarter-deck, were all ſlain by one ſhot; and the Duke, who ſtood by their ſide, was covered with their blood. The fight continued till two with great obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy, when Opdam blew up, at the third ſhot of the Duke's lower tier, which he had ordered to be fired, gun after gun. The Dutch, ſeeing the fate of their admiral, fell into the utmoſt confuſion. Their fire abated, and at half paſt two they fled. Sebaſtian Seaton, a Scotſman, remained alone in his ſhip, called the Orange. He attempted to board the Duke; but being raked by Sir John Smith, who killed ſixty of his men, he was obliged to ſtrike.

                  <note place="margin">An accident prevents the victory</note> The Duke purſued the Dutch till night; and moſt of their ſhips, had it not been for an accident, might have been taken next morning, before they could gain the Texel. When it began to grow dark, the Duke ordered the Norwich, a fifth-rate, to keep juſt a-head of him all night, to hang out lights, and to keep cloſe to the Dutch. He ordered Captain Wetwang, who commanded her, to fire guns, to make falſe fires, to put out more lights, ſhould the enemy clear their courſe; and by no means to loſe them in the night. Having given ſtrict charge to his own ſhip to keep cloſe to the enemy, that he might engage them by break of day, he retired to his cabin about eleven o'clock, and lay down on a quilt, in his clothes, to take ſome reſt, after the fatigues of the day. He ſcarce had fallen aſleep, when one Brounker, whoſe behaviour during the battle exhibited every ſymptom of cowardice, came upon deck, and endeavoured to perſuade Captain Cox, the maſter of the Royal Charles, to ſhorten ſail. Cox refuſing his requeſt, he applied to Captain Harman, a brave and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced officer, who acted as firſt lieutenant, but in vain, unleſs he obtained an order from Sir William Pen, the captain.

He found himſelf, when it

grew light, half a league a-ſtern of the Dutch, and about the ſame diſtance a-head of his own fleet. He believed the Dutch had out-ſailed him, by going right before the wind, and drawing leſs water. He thought that the Royal Charles had, by being a good ſailer ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced a-head of the other ſhips. This accident ſaved the Dutch. They endeavoured to enter the Texel, but the tide had failed. They anchored, however, ſo near the ſands, and in ſuch ſhallow water, that the Engliſh durſt not advance with their large ſhips; and the enemy was too numerous and ſtrong for the ſmall. To complete the diſappointment, all the the fire-ſhips had been expended. Four or five would have been ſufficient to deſtroy the whole of the Dutch fleet. The Duke knew nothing of Brounker's affair, till the parliament met at Oxford, in the month of October. Enraged beyond meaſure, he determined to try him by a court-martial<note n="A" place="bottom">James II. 1665.</note>; but he was prevented by the houſe of commons taking cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance of the affair.

The people received him with that admiration which perſons of high rank derive from victory and perſonal courage. The States were filled with conſternation.

Upon receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing intelligence of the arrival of the Dutch Eaſt India fleet in the port of Bergen, he made ſecret propoſals to Sir Gilbert Talbot, the Engliſh envoy at his court, to aſſiſt in delivering them, for a ſhare of the booty, into the hands of their enemies. Talbot communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated the offer to Charles, who embraced it with joy. Sandwich received orders to repair with the fleet to the coaſt of Norway. Upon his arrival, he detached a ſquadron of men of war, under Sir Thomas Tiddiman, to attack the Dutch; who, appriſed of the danger, had landed their effects and erected batteries aſhore. The treachery of the governor of Bergen, the obſtinacy of the enemy, the various difficulties to ſurmount, obliged the Engliſh to retire without ſucceſs. The King of Denmark, as if aſhamed of his conduct, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a ſtrict alliance with Charles, through his ambaſſador at Copenhagen; while the Daniſh reſident in Holland concluded, by command, an offenſive treaty with the Dutch.

the Engliſh auxiliaries, he diſpatched Sir Richard Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, as ambaſſador, to gain the friendſhip of Philip the Fourth. Age and diſeaſe had now added their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities to the natural weakneſs of Philip. In his eagerneſs to reduce Portugal, he neglected to remove from her the ſupport of her beſt ally. The loſs of Jamaica and Dunkirk lay ſo heavy on the minds of the Spaniards, that the dangers which threatened the monarchy, the ambition of France, the dying condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their King, the uncomfortable proſpect of the reign of a ſickly infant, the laſt male of his family in Spain, were not all ſufficient to induce them to accept the offer of an alliance with England. Neither was Charles more ſucceſsful in his negotiations in France. The mind of Lewis was already engaged in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary ſcheme of empire, which was long the terror, and afterwards the deriſion of Europe. Governing the councils of Holland through the abilities of De Wit, he had concluded a treaty with the States for a partition of the Spaniſh Netherlands. The Lord Hollis, then ambaſſador at Paris, failed in all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to gain the court of France. The offer of Charles to abandon Flanders to conqueſt, equalled not, in the mind of Lewis, the power which England would acquire by the total reduction of the Dutch. Reſolving to eſtabliſh a force at ſea, he thought it beſt for his ſcheme to preſerve a kind of balance between the two great maritime powers. He, however, either through art or want of deciſion, heſitated for ſome time; and, when he engaged on the ſide of the States, his aid was ſpiritleſs, eluſive, and cold.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Rupture with France and Den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</note> The year 1666 uſhered in an unfavourable proſpect of Engliſh affairs. Denmark, gained by a ſubſidy, ſided with Holland; France, at the earneſt inſtances of De Wit<note n="I" place="bottom">D'Eſtrades, Baſnage.</note>, openly eſpouſed her cauſe. On the nineteenth of January, Lewis iſſued a declaration of war; but allowed three months to the Engliſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants to remove themſelves and their effects from his dominions. Frederick ſhewed firſt his intentions, by the ſeizure of all their ſhips in the Daniſh ports. The regency of Sweden, offended at the treaty between the Danes and the States, adhered to Charles in their profeſſions of friendſhip<note n="K" place="bottom">Philips p. 549.</note>; but they avoided to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage in the war. The preſſure of danger from abroad created unanimity at home. When the King iſſued his declaration againſt France, the people, tho' recent from a dreadful calamity, teſtified their reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſupport him, with ſhouts of joy. The mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time counties put themſelves in a poſture of defence; and offered the continual attendance of their militia in arms. Charles received their propoſals with thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expreſſions: but he would not permit them to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur the expence. The motives of France were not perhaps unknown to the King. He juſtly thought that Lewis would not puſh with vigour a war into which he had entered only to ſupport the credit of De Wit againſt the faction of the family of Orange.</p>

The fleet was therefore ſubmitted to the joint command of the Duke of Albemarle and

Prince Rupert. The Earl of Sandwich, who had cloſed with reputation the ſervice of the preceding year, having behaved himſelf irregularly concerning the prizes, was removed; but without diſhonour. He was appointed ambaſſador extraordinary, in the room of Sir Richard Fanſhaw, to the Queen-regent of Spain. The perilous ſituation of England, the new councils which might be adopted upon the death of Philip the Fourth, induced Charles to renew his negociations at Madrid in the perſon of Sandwich<note n="L" place="bottom">Clarendon's life.</note>. The joint-admirals received not their commiſſions till their predeceſſor departed on his embaſſy. They went on board in the middle of April; but though they were both men of indefatigable induſtry, the fleet was not ready to ſail till the end of May<note n="M" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Their force conſiſted of ſeventy-eight ſhips of the line, with ſeveral frigates and ſome fire-ſhips. They ſtood immediately for the coaſt of Holland, and took many prizes; but concluding precipitately, from the intelligence which they received, that the Dutch were not ready to leave their ports, they returned to the Downs<note n="N" place="bottom">Continuation of Baker, p. 637.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Battle of four days.</note> Lewis, to co-operate with his allies, had given or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to his admiral, the Duke of Beaufort, to ſail from Toulon with forty ſhips. This force by the bad intelligence of the miniſtry, was ſaid to have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready entered the channel. Orders were ſent to Prince Rupert, to ſeparate himſelf with twenty ſhips from his collegue, and to make the beſt of his way to intercept and fight the French. The Prince with all the natural ardour of his temper, immediately obeyed; whilſt Albemarle, with the reſt of the fleet, remained in the Downs. The next day after Rupert's departure, the Duke received certain intelligence, that the Dutch, commanded by De Ruyter, with De Wit himſelf on board, had come out of their harbours. On the firſt of June, at three in the morning, he gave orders to weigh; and at ſeven he ſaw the Dutch to lee ward, to the number of ninety ſail, lying at anchor. Albemarle, though cool and ſedate in his
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0709200301:94"/>
temper, was ever impatient at the ſight of an enemy. Though he called his flag-officers together, it was not to aſk their advice, but to give his commands. He bore up with a full wind upon the enemy; who, having cut their cables, ſtood out to receive him with ardour<note n="O" place="bottom">Clarendon's life, p. 343.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Firſt day.</note> At two o'clock the engagement began. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh at firſt had the wind, which was ſo high, that they could not carry out their lower tiers, whilſt the Dutch ſhips, being bent toward the ſide which lay from the Engliſh, could fire their full broadſides. Van Tromp, ruſhing furiouſly through the ſquadrons of the enemy, exhibited prodigies of valour. Albe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marle, engaged with De Ruyter, ſhewed himſelf worthy of his former renown. The Dutch had the advantage in the action of the firſt day. Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Berkley, as vice-admiral, leading the van, was by numbers overpowered, his ſhip taken and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſlain. Sir John Harman having diſengaged him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from two fire ſhips, ſunk a third; and having ſlain Admiral Evertſon, who bore down upon him, retired with his ſhattered veſſel to Harwich. One Dutch ſhip was burnt; two admirals ſlain. Three Engliſh ſhips, after the loſs of almoſt all their men, were taken by the enemy.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Second day.</note> Though night interrupted the fight, the ardour of neither ſide was abated. The Dutch were animat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the hopes of conqueſt; the Engliſh were fired with indignation at their not being victorious. De Ruyter ſaw his own ſuperiority in point of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers: Albemarle was aſhamed of retiring from an enemy whom he had often ſubdued. The whole night was ſpent in repairing the maſts and rigging, which the Dutch, by uſing then for the firſt time chain-ſhot, had greatly damaged<note n="P" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 844.</note>. At ſix of the clock the battle began with redoubled fierceneſs; but when the Dutch were upon the point of flying, they were reinforced with ſixteen capital ſhips. They renewed with fury the combat. Many were ſlain on the ſide of the Engliſh; many of their ſhips were
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0709200301:95"/>
diſabled; Albemarle, however, would yield to nothing but the night. Though the Dutch loſt a vice-admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, though many of their ſhips were diſabled, and Van Tromp himſelf obliged repeatedly to change his flag, the enemy had greatly the diſadvantage in the action of the ſecond day. The Engliſh had loſt no ſhip, but many were ſhattered and in no condition to face the enemy with any proſpect of ſucceſs.—Darkneſs had ſcarce given them a reſpite from battle<note n="Q" place="bottom">Clarendon's Contin. of Baker, Baſnage.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Third day.</note> Albemarle found his fleet ſo much weakened in this action, that he reſolved to take the benefit of the night and retire. The vigilance of the enemy and the ſhattered condition of his ſhips prevented him from executing this deſign. Before day-light appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he ordered the diſabled ſhips to make all the ſail they could, whilſt he himſelf, with a line of battle of ſixteen veſſels brought up the rear. De Ruyter purſued the flight of the enemy, yet he could not bring up his fleet within ſhot of the Duke till four in the afternoon. Albemarle prepared to renew the action, and reſolved to periſh rather than yield. He communicated to the Earl of Oſſory, who was then on board, his intention to blow up his ſhip rather than to tarniſh his former renown by falling into the enemies hands<note n="R" place="bottom">Hume.</note>. At this inſtant a new fleet ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to the ſouth, crowding toward the Engliſh with all their ſails; the mariners, concluding it to be Prince Rupert's ſquadron, rent the ſky with their ſhouts. They edged up with ſo much eagerneſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their friends, that ſeveral of the flag ſhips ran a-ground on the Galloper-ſand. They all, but with great difficulty, got off, except the ſhip of Sir George Ayſcough, admiral of the White, who, with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of his crew, was made priſoner by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Though the miniſtry, apprized of their former fatal miſtake, had diſpatched an expreſs to Rupert, it was the noiſe of the cannon, which filled all the neighbouring ſeas, that brought him back ſo oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunely to his friends. The prince having joined
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0709200301:96"/>
Albemarle, the fleet bore northward; but in endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to clear the ſands, they gave the wind to the enemy. Night prevented a renewal of the fight<note n="S" place="bottom">Clarendon.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Fourth day.</note> In the morning of the fourth of June, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh admirals, who had reſolved to renew the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat, deſcried the enemy three leagues to windward. They crowded toward them with all their ſails.—The Dutch lay with their ſails to the maſt. The fight began about eight of the clock, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt fury on both ſides. The Dutch were eager to retain their advantage, the Engliſh to retrieve their fame. The victory remained doubtful throughout the day. De Ruyter exerted all his ſkill, but the two admirals were invincible. They kept their firſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the wind. They burnt ſix ſhips, they ſunk others, and loſt only three. The fate of the battle was not, however, decided at ſix at night; when both, as if weary of carnage, gradually ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and haſtened to their reſpective coaſts. Both ſides claimed the victory; both deſerved it, had it depended on valour. Albemarle, by his invincible courage, made amends for his eagerneſs; and Rupert, by the timely relief which he brought to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed friends, added their love to his former renown. The behaviour of the Dutch admirals upon this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion was manly, and full of heroiſm. De Ruyter and Van Tromp, though mortal enemies aſhore, contended at ſea only for fame. The firſt, by ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his rival from imminent danger, gained over him a victory more to be envied, than if he had ruined the deſigns of his whole faction at home<note n="T" place="bottom">Ibid.

                  <note place="margin">Dutch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, July 25th.</note> The diſabled ſhips were ſent to different ports to refit; the admirals remained on board of their own<note n="U" place="bottom">Clarendon</note>. Both, men of the moſt undaunted intrepidity in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeemed aſhamed to return, without victory, to their friends. Their induſtry in preparing the fleet was equal to their courage in battle. In four weeks they were ready for ſea; but the winds were ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, or the weather ſo calm, that it was the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fourth
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0709200301:97"/>
of July before they came in ſight of the enemy. De Ruyter, reinforced by ſome ſhips that were ready to ſail for the Baltic, was before them at the mouth of the Thames. When the Engliſh appeared, he retreated toward the coaſt of Holland; but he was cloſely purſued. Night prevented an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. About ſix the next morning, the Engliſh found themſelves within two leagues of the enemy. The Dutch formed themſelves into a half moon, to avoid the fire-ſhips, the Engliſh having the wind. They hoped, in that way, that either their van or rear, by tacking, might weather a part of the Engliſh fleet. At ten the white ſquadron fell along-ſide of the Dutch, and the fire began. The enemy, at eleven, gave way a little, but they renewed the action; yet, at one, their whole van gave way, and bore up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the wind. De Ruyter's ſhip ſtill maintained the fight againſt the Engliſh admirals. The Royal Charles, on board of which were the Prince and Duke, was forced to quit the line at three to refit, and the Sovereign fell in her place, along-ſide of De Ruyter. His fire-ſhip being at length ſunk, and his main-top-maſt ſhot down, he bore, at four, into his fleet, right before the wind. He diſabled his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary in ſuch a manner as prevented purſuit. Van Tromp having, at the beginning of the action, broke in between the red and the blue, maintained, with his wonted obſtinacy, the battle with the latter ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron. He alſo was at length forced to give way. Though the loſs of the Dutch was not conſiderable, an indiſputed victory remained to the Engliſh. They rode in triumph along the coaſt. They attacked the iſle of Ulie. They burnt two men of war, and one hundred and ſixty merchant-men, that lay in the harbour<note n="X" place="bottom">Mr. Pepys's MSS. ſol. 58. Oxon.</note>.</p>

To ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a junction with the French fleet was their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal object, as the only means to gain a ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty over the Engliſh.

Lewis the Fourteenth, at the earneſt inſtances of De Wit, haſtened forward the Duke of Beaufort.

A ſtorm, which forced Prince Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert to St. Helen's, ſaved at once both the Dutch and the French. Beaufort paſſed the enemy unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; but the Dutch had recalled their fleet to their ports. The French admiral had again the good fortune to return unſeen. Only two ſhips, who fell in with Sir Thomas Allen, were taken. This ſmall loſs gave a pretence to Lewis to lay up his fleet for the year. De Wit had ſupported his influence, and the King of France left the ſafety of the States to their own arms.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Fire of</note> The ſtorm that protected the Dutch and French from the Engliſh promoted a dreadful calamity, which fell on the city of London. On the ſecond of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember a fire broke out, at one in the morning, in a baker's ſhop in Pudding-lane, near New Fiſh-ſtreet, with ſuch violence, that the family eſcaped with the greateſt difficulty. The wind was high, the lane nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, the houſes were old and of wood. The flakes, carried forward by the tempeſt, kindled new fires beyond the courſe of the firſt flame, and ſpread the devaſtation far and wide. The terror of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple was at laſt equal to their danger, though great. Uproar, confuſion, and flight, prevailed. Few thought of ſaving any thing, except their lives; none to ſtop the progreſs of the conflagration. The morning came, and the fire increaſed. The alarm had ſpread to the fartheſt corners of the city; aſſiſtance came from all parts. The pipes under the ſtreets were broken up; but, to add to the miſchief, the water ſuddenly fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. That part of the city where the flames raged was ſupplied with water by the engine at the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end of the bridge; but the engine itſelf was burnt down. They had recourſe to the pipes of the New River, but they found them dry. The cocks, by

Diſtruſt, jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, and ſuſpicion, as is uſual, were joined to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation and terror in the minds of the people, who are ever ready to aſcribe public misfortune to private deſign<note n="Y" place="bottom">Clarendon, Heath, Burnet, Contin. of Baker, &amp;c.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">London.</note> Three days and three nights the flames raged with redoubled fury. Of the twenty-ſix wards fifteen were burnt down. Four hundred ſtreets and lanes, thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand houſes, eighty-nine pariſh-churches, were deſtroyed<note n="Z" place="bottom">James II. 1666.</note>. The King, the Duke, the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of ſtate, the members of the privy-council, took different poſts in the city, to keep order, by their authority, among the terrified populace; and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, by their directions, to furniſh them with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief. Charles was affected beyond meaſure at this dreadful misfortune<note n="A" place="bottom">Clarendon, p. 359.</note>. Rouzed from his lethargy of pleaſure and indolence, he was preſent every where, directing, encouraging, aſſiſting thoſe who laboured to extinguiſh the fire. The Duke of York, who was afterwards accuſed as the author of the calamity, was active in ſtopping its progreſs. The wind falling in the night of Tueſday, the flames began to decline. The fire, by the blowing up of houſes, ceaſed in many parts; in others it became extinguiſhed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any apparent cauſe. On the evening of Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday it broke out a freſh in the Inner-Temple; but, by the care of the Duke of York, who held the watch there for that night, it was extinguiſhed before day. It is remarkable, that, during a calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſo terrible, not one life was loſt; and though the fields were covered with people, whoſe houſes had been burnt, in four days there was ſcarce a perſon to be ſeen. They all found ſhelter in the parts of the city which remained, in the ſuburbs or neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring villages<note n="B" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 351.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note> Though the loſs of individuals was great, the fire of London might be ſaid to have been a benefit to the nation. The wretched cabins, which nurſed ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0709200301:100"/>
and diſeaſe, being deſtroyed, the new city be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came airy and healthy. The plague, which former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly viſited, at ſtated periods, the capital, has not been heard of for more than a century; and other epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical diſorders have, ever ſince, become more bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in their ravages. The King aſſumed a diſcreti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary power, which the parliament afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, to regulate the rebuilding of the city, and to prevent the houſes from being framed of lath and timber. Had he extended his care from the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials to the diſpoſition of the houſes, London might have taken a more magnificent and convenient form. But neither Charles, nor the age in which he lived, had formed any perfect idea of that convenience, at which an advanced ſtate of luxury can only arrive. The opinion that the Papiſts burnt the city of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don ſuited the jealouſy of the times. Plots, conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racies, and treaſons, were the terror and diſgrace of that ſuſpicious reign. The minds of men were not yet ſettled, from the late diverſity of political opinions. The negligence of a diſſolute court, the careleſs and even profligate character of the King, were more apt to kindle ancient jealouſies, than to lull the people into preſent ſecurity. The novelty of the reſtoration of monarchy, the ſpecious qualities of the Prince, had loſt a great deal of their influence in the progreſs of time; and mankind, as if awakened from a dream, began to wonder how they had been pleaſed.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Diſcontents.</note> But neither the public calamities, nor the undeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſtate of an expenſive war, had yet raiſed open clamours in the nation againſt the meaſures of the crown. The firſt ſymptoms of diſcontent appeared in the parliament, which, after ſeveral prorogations, met on the twenty-firſt of September<note n="C" place="bottom">Journals.</note>. The King, as uſual, ſuited his ſpeech to the times. He lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the late calamity; he magnified the ſucceſs of his arms; he, in an artful manner, demanded a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply<note n="D" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The houſe of commons, during the firſt days of their ſitting, was thin, the diſtant members having not yet arrived. The ſervants of the crown formed a great majority of thoſe preſent; and a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0709200301:101"/>
was faintly voted<note n="E" place="bottom">Clarendon.</note>, without mentioning the funds upon which it was to be charged. When the members increaſed, they made profeſſions of loyalty to the King; but they arraigned the meaſures of the crown. Without thinking any more of the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, they paſſed to other buſineſs. They inquired into the cauſe of the late fire; they ordered in a bill for appointing commiſſioners to inſpect the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic accounts. When any member mentioned the ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent neceſſities of the crown, another anſwered by repreſenting the exhauſted ſtate of the nation. This buſineſs became the ſubject of altereation, rather than debate; the ſervants of the crown, who wiſhed to ingratiate themſelves with the popular party, avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to bring the matter to a queſtion.</p>

                  <note place="margin">in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</note> The ill-humour in parliament proceeded leſs from a regard for the public good, than from the private views of ſome leading members. The neceſſities, which threw Charles ſo frequently on his commons, rendered the poſſeſſion of their houſe an object of ambition. Men ſaw that the road to preferment lay through that place; and they began to oppoſe the crown, to render themſelves neceſſary to its ſervice. This ſcience, brought ſince to great perfection, was far from being unknown under Charles. The beſt ſpeakers among the commons thought themſelves the moſt able to govern the nation. They formed into a party, and, to carry forward their operations with more force they choſe a head. This was the Duke of Buckingham, who joined lively parts to unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led profligacy. The pleaſantneſs of his humour and converſation, the extravagance and poignancy of his wit, rendered perſons of all opinions fond of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. A quarrel with the favourite miſtreſs, which drove him from the King's preſence, made him a fit leader for a party who oppoſed the court. He knew the vulnerable ſide of Charles, from being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with his ſecret acts of profuſion; and from him, probably, roſe the popular topic of an examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into the public accounts.</p>

The oppoſition were as unwilling to bring the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the ſupply to a deciſion, as the ſervants of the crown. To defer it was to gain a point. The attention of the houſe was called to a matter which engaged their paſſions. A bill was brought in to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the importation of Iriſh cattle<note n="G" place="bottom">Journals.</note>; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates upon it, through ſome of thoſe ſtrange humours to which popular aſſemblies are frequently liable, grew to a warmth which precluded all other ſubjects. A difference with the lords was added to the tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulence among the commons<note n="H" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The bill at length paſſed both houſes; and, when the King came to give his aſſent, on the eighteenth of January, he ſpoke to the commons concerning their promiſed ſupply with that firmneſs which he could, upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, aſſume. They retired to their houſe, and paſſed the bill of ſupply, which was preſented for the royal aſſent on the eighth of February; and then the parliament was prorogued to the tenth of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober<note n="I" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.

                  <note place="margin">The fleet laid up.</note> The ſupply granted by the commons, with ſo much reluctance, was inadequate for carrying on the war with vigour. The King himſelf, and almoſt all his ſervants, were inclined to a peace; but how to obtain it with honour, was difficult to be conceived.

The conſternation was great, but ſcarce equal to the general indignation. The reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed lords of the ocean ſaw themſelves inſulted, and their navy deſtroyed in their very harbours.

                  <note place="margin">at Chatham</note> The city of London, during the Dutch operations at Chatham was thrown into the utmoſt conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The enemy were expected at London-bridge. The timid left the town. Confuſion prevailed among thoſe who remained. The militia was raiſed. Nine ſhips were ſunk at Woolwich, five at Blackwall.—Batteries were raiſed on the banks of the river. The train-bands themſelves took the field. Theſe precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were, however, unneceſſary. The difficult na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation of the Thames, prevented De Ruyter from endeavouring to advance, more than any force pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared by the Engliſh. He ſailed weſtward along the coaſt. He attempted Portſmouth, Torbay and Ply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth in vain. He returned again to the Thames. The ſame conſternation was renewed. An encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter happened between Sir Edward Spragge and the enemy, in the mouth of the river. Little damage was done on either ſide. Spragge retired to Graveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end, De Ruyter ſailed again to the weſt. The Dutch, during the whole month of June and the greateſt part of July, rode triumphant in the channel. The treaty of peace being at length ſigned, on the twenty-firſt of the latter month, De Ruyter put an end to hoſtilities and returned to Holland. Charles was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely mortified at the diſgrace, which either his own avarice, or the unſkilfulneſs of his councils brought upon the nation. A melancholy and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, for ſome time, ſuſpended his pleaſures; and he added ſelf-reproach to the juſt murmurs of his people.</p>
               <p>During the alarm, which the Dutch fleet made along the coaſt, Charles levied ſuddenly a body of twelve thouſand men; and to provide againſt the worſt, ordered the parliament to aſſemble, on the twenty-fifth of July<note n="S" place="bottom">Journals.</note>.

diſmiſſed them, with a ſhort ſpeech; having perceived, that the ill humour which had become apparent in the late ſeſſion, was encreaſed, by the diſgrace at Chatham. The only vote paſſed by the commons, was an addreſs for diſbanding the army; with which the King, in his ſpeech at the prorogation, promiſed to comply. Thus ended the firſt war of Charles, begun through jealouſy more than injury; and which, though carried on with ſome glory, terminated in diſgrace. Though the Dutch were nominally joined by two crowned heads, they derived little aſſiſtance from either. They were ſupported merely by their own reſources, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizing genius of their miniſter, De Wit. A ſubſidy procured for them the friendſhip of Denmark; they owed the name of France, in the war, to the influence of the penſionary with Lewis the Fourteenth. Neither of the two kings had any quarrel with England; and they had no differences to ſettle by treaty. To forget the paſt was to be reconciled with Denmark; and France, by putting a part of the iſland of St. Chriſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher's again in poſſeſſion of the Engliſh, removed every pretence of future conteſt. The ambition of Lewis being turned to another quarter, he found it convenient to ſecure the acquieſcence, if not the friendſhip of Charles. This was the cauſe of his languor in the war, as well as of the facility with which he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to conclude the peace.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Diſcontents among the people.</note> The national happineſs, which began with the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſeems to have terminated with the Dutch war. The careleſſneſs of the King, the diſtreſs brought upon the crown by extravagance, the diſgrace thrown upon the kingdom by want of a proper protection from government, raiſed the jealouſy of the people; and, in ſome degree, provoked their reſentment. To theſe, Charles had only to oppoſe ſome amiable qualities; and that irreſiſtible popularity in his manner, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported him with the vulgar, in his worſt meaſures. Men of ſenſe and virtue, who knew his abilities, were offended at his not exerting them with vigour. The lovers of monarchy were chagrined at a negligence, which undermined his authority; and his beſt friends, the populace, transferred the blame of the late misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0709200301:109"/>
from their prince to his ſervants. Theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contents, however, exhibited no ſymptoms of violence. The calamities of fire, peſtilence, and, in the end, an inglorious war, were not capable to alienate the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people from a prince, whoſe very vices were popular. His gallantry was conſtrued into ſpirit, his want of oeconomy into generoſity. The vulgar, ever fond of royalty, forgot a thouſand errors, in the flattering familiarity of their Sovereign.</p>

He knew that a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice muſt be made, and that a miniſter is the moſt grateful offering to an offended people. The Earl of Clarendon, though he had loſt a part of the confidence of the Sovereign, was conſidered by the nation, as the leader in all his councils; and he was now become as diſagreeable to Charles, as he was hated by his ſubjects. This noble perſon, though poſſeſſed of merit, was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to weakneſſes, which by their magnitude bordered upon vices. To the ſeverity of his manners he added a paſſionate diſpoſition, which frequently converted his beſt friends into his worſt enemies. In buſineſs he was ſometimes trifling, always dilatory<note n="T" place="bottom">North's Examen, p. 455.</note>; and he often forgot to act, in the pleaſure which he derived from diſquiſition and argument. His love of virtue was tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with a ſcrupulous adherence to forms, which bore the appearance of moral prudery. His good ſenſe yielded too often to the vehemence of his temper; and, as he was ſeldom wrong in his judgment, he could not bear contradiction with any degree of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience.

Though faithful to his maſter, he perceived not his diſtant intereſts; and he ſacrificed, for preſent convenience, his future political happineſs. The moſt unpopular meaſures of the early part of this reign were either originally propoſed, or afterwards proſecuted with ardour by Clarendon; yet even theſe proceeded from an error in judgment, more than from deſign. He adviſed the King to retain a numerous guard for his perſon<note n="U" place="bottom">James II. 1661.</note>. The ſale of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk, propoſed firſt by his intimate friend, Southampton, was managed by him and afterwards defended<note n="X" place="bottom">Clarendon's life.</note>. Though perhaps he was not the firſt who ſuggeſted the match with the daughter of Portugal, he ſupported, againſt all oppoſition, that unfortunate meaſure; and brought, as his ſon-in-law affirms, a Queen of his own chooſing to England<note n="Y" place="bottom">James II. 1662.</note>. His zeal for the church of England, combining with his memory of the political delinquency of the ſectaries, formed thoſe intolerant laws which diſturbed the repoſe of the kingdom. The unfortunate reſolution of laying up the fleet, may be carried by implication to the account of Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendon. It was propoſed by Southampton<note n="Z" place="bottom">Ibid. 1667.</note>, who, though a man of parts himſelf, was known, from his indolence, to be guided in his opinions by the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor. He was, upon the whole, a reſpectable miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and a man of integrity. To an unwearied applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he joined a conſtancy which approached to firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and though a zealous aſſertor of the prerogatives of the crown, he made few encroachments upon the liberties of the ſubject, as they were then defined.</p>

ſacrificed his feelings to his convenience. He permitted his miniſter to rail at his vices, for furniſhing him with leiſure to follow his pleaſures. The whole weight of the ſtate lay chiefly on his ſhoulders; and an old ſervant derived a kind of right to be familiar, from his fidelity. The intemperate rage of a miſtreſs, the artful machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of her deſigning creatures, would have little weight with Charles, had his miniſter retained the power of ſerving him with effect. But Clarendon had loſt the confidence of the people; and he probably never poſſeſſed the ſincere love of his Prince. The power of being uſeful being ended with the chancellor, the King ceaſed to be grateful. In falling down with the ſtream of public opinion, he found that he could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge his own private reſentment. The enemies of Clarendon, and envy as well as his manner had raiſed many againſt him, urged the King to remove him, with all their addreſs. The Duke of Buckingham, who had, ſome months before, fallen under the diſpleaſure of Charles, was now permitted to appear at court; and he aſcribed his late misfortunes to the chancellor. With all the force of his poignant wit, he had long endeavoured to render the miniſter ridiculous in the eyes of his Sovereign; and what contributed ſtill more to the ſucceſs of his purpoſe, he promiſed for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture good humour of the commons, ſhould his enemy be diveſted of his employment.

adviſed the raiſing a proper guard for the King's perſon. But Charles himſelf declared, in the moſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn manner, to the Duke of York, that he had never given his advice to govern by a ſtanding army<note n="G" place="bottom">James II. 1667.</note>. His concern in the ſale of Dunkirk is not to be denied. But there is no reaſon to believe, that he derived any advantage to himſelf from the meaſure; and it is even doubtful, whether the ſale of the place was any real detriment to the nation. Sir Richard Greenville and Sir Robert Long, during the King's exile, had accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sir Edward Hyde of paying a ſecret viſit to Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well, and receiving a penſion for intelligence. The accuſation was founded upon the faith of a chamber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, who alledged that ſhe led Hyde one morning to the Protector's bed-room<note n="H" place="bottom">Letter of Sir Richard Greenville, MS.</note>. This vague report was rejected without examination by Charles; and though his accuſers endeavoured to corroborate their aſſertions by the affluence in which Hyde and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily lived abroad, the tale is too improbable to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved<note n="I" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Of arbitrary impriſonments he may with ſome juſtice be accuſed.

The lords refuſed the demands of the commons; looking upon a general accuſation as a mere clamour. The commons flew into the utmoſt ſury. A breach was made between the houſes. The King interfered in vain. He was obliged to apply to Clarendon, to remove himſelf from the kingdom, to appeaſe their rage. He obeyed; and wrote an apology from Calais, at which the lords
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0709200301:114"/>
took offence: they ſent down a bill for his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the commons; and though it was diſliked for different reaſons, both by his friends and his enemies, it paſſed at length, and received the royal aſſent. The conduct of Charles, during the whole proſecution, did little honour to his gratitude. But jealouſies of a new kind are ſaid to have joined their force to his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer prejudices. Buckingham and others inſinuated, that he was in danger, by permitting the Duke of York to have his own guards to wait upon himſelf at Whitehall. They affirmed, that the Duke might be prevailed upon, by Clarendon and his daughter, to attempt ſome violent meaſure. Alarmed at this tale, or apprehenſive of the riſing heats in the houſe of commons, the King ordered Clarendon to withdraw. The latter communicated his reſolution of obeying to the Duke, who was juſt recovering from the ſmall-pox. The Duke had laboured under that diſorder during the perſecution of his father-in-law; ſo that he could neither counteract the malice of his enemies, nor give any eſſential aſſiſtance to his friends<note n="M" place="bottom">James II. 1667.</note>.</p>

Charles, before their receſs, had filled the different departments.

The treaſury, ſince the death of Southampton, in the month of May, was in commiſſion under men of abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, though, except the Duke of Albemarle, of no high reputation. Lord Aſhley was Chancellor of the Exchequer; Sir William Coventry, Sir John Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb, and Sir Thomas Clifford, were inferior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners.

Duncomb was a country gentleman of ſome note; Clifford, a man of violent abilities, poſſeſſing weight in parliament, but a known papiſt. No ſooner was Clarendon removed, than theſe began to quarrel for the poſſeſſion of the chief power.

With that convenient inattention to juſtice, which am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition has introduced into the policy of princes, he poſſeſſed reſources much ſuperior to thoſe of the other powers of Europe. His extenſive dominions, favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fruitful ſoil and a good climate, had riſen in a few years to a high degree of proſperity, through the induſtry of the inhabitants, under the peaceable councils of Cardinal Mazarin. An ample revenue, a diſciplined army, and even a kind of naval force be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to Lewis; while the neighbouring ſtates had either fallen from their former conſequence, or had not yet arrived at the ſtrength which they have ſince acquired. The Dutch, who had derived their inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence from the protection of France and England, had thrown the whole force of their ſtate into their navy. England, jealous of her native ſovereigns, had not yet furniſhed herſelf with a ſtanding army, to ſtop the ambitious projects of foreign princes. The latter, however, retained her ancient animoſity againſt France; and the former choſe to forget former fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours in their preſent ſafety. Lewis had added a haughtineſs of conduct toward his neighbours to his opinion of the ſuperiority of his own force; and he contrived to kindle indignation beyond the limits to which he had extended injuries. He extorted from Spain a precedency in dignity before he invaded her territories; he diſputed the honours of the flag with the King of England; he reduced the Pope into an abject dependence, under colour of ſatisfaction for a trivial affront.</p>

Charles, occupied by the ſears of tumults at
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0709200301:118"/>
home, in conſequence of the diſgrace which cloſed the war, had neither leiſure nor inclination to look beyond the limits of his own dominions. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of Clarendon, the eſtabliſhment of new coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and the heats in parliament, ſucceeded to the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions which the apparent diſguſt of the nation had raiſed in the mind of the King. The States had ſcarce extricated themſelves from a war with England; they were in alliance with France; and divided into factions at home. The times were opportune for the ambition of Lewis. He dreaded nothing from the careleſs councils of Charles; he hoped every thing from the attachment of De Wit. But the firſt was offended at the coldneſs with which Lewis received his propoſals for a cloſe connection with France; and the latter loſt his averſion to the Orange faction in his love for his country. To the aſtoniſhment of Europe, as well as to the amazement of his ſubjects, the King of England made the firſt motion for a treaty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy to preſcribe bounds to the conqueſts of France. On the firſt of January it was reſolved in council, to enter into a ſtrict alliance with the ſtates of Holland<note n="R" place="bottom">Sir W. Temple.</note>. Sir William Temple, the Engliſh reſident at Bruſſels, was ordered to proceed to the Hague; and ſuch was the eagerneſs of De Wit, in a meaſure which ſo much concerned his country, that the treaty was ſigned on the twenty-third of January.

The penſionary, with all his good qualities, was vain of his own abilities, and proud of the ſucceſs of his policy. He ſpoke fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the advantages which he had obtained over England, and of the neceſſity to which he had reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Sweden and Denmark to conclude and preſerve peace. To mortify Lewis the Fourteenth was only wanting to his ambition. He had derived much of
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0709200301:119"/>
his importance with his own countrymen from his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with the French nation. But he now ſeriouſly dreaded the power of that kingdom, and the ambition of its ſovereign. Charles had, upon various grounds, entertained an animoſity againſt the penſionary; and he was determined to ruin him, by detaching him from France. He reſolved, therefore, to attrack him through the channel of his vanity. He beſought him, through his ambaſſador, to give his advice upon every occaſion, without even the ceremony of being aſked, concerning the conduct which England ought to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve in the affairs of Europe. De Wit was flattered by theſe condeſcenſions. He believed that Charles was ſincere. He ſuffered himſelf to be detached from France by the triple league; and having loſt, ſoon after, his conſequence with his countrymen, became an eaſy victim to the faction of the Prince of Orange. The advice, by which the King of England ſeems to have profited, came originally from Gourville; who ſays, in his Memoirs, that he communicated it to the Lord Hollis, when that nobleman was employed in concluding the peace of Breda<note n="S" place="bottom">Mem. de Gourville, tom. ii. p. 11-14.</note>.</p>

The court of Spain was in no haſte to cloſe with either of the alternatives. They forgot their own want of power, in their ſenſe of the injuſtice of Lewis. To force Spain into a peace, was as much the object of the triple alliance, as to put bounds to the conqueſts of France.

Fond of domeſtic freedom, they carried frequently tyranny and oppreſſion abroad, and endangered the loſing by injuſtice what they had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by valour. The ſeverity of their government contributed more to deprive them of the continental dominions of the family of Plantagenet, than the arms of France; and the peculiar ſituation of Ireland ſecured its dependance, and not the mildneſs of the conquerors. In the year 1666, a bill was paſſed for reſtraining the importation of Iriſh cattle; an act pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly hard, as Ireland had ſcarce any other article for foreign commerce. The violence of the country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentlemen, who aſcribed the ſudden fall of the rents to the importation of proviſions from abroad, overcame the King's ſolicitations, and ſuperſeded all arguments. The intrigues of Buckingham and Lord Aſhley, who wiſhed to diſturb Ormonde in his government, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the flame.

Ormonde employed the year 1667 in alleviating the diſtreſs brought upon Ireland by this impolitic law; which, in the iſſue, became favourable to the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, by forcing them to apply with greater induſtry to articles more ſuitable than cattle for commerce<note n="C" place="bottom">Carte's Ormonde, vol. ii. p. 331.</note>.</p>

Inſtead of thanking him as uſual, for his ſpeech, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons addreſſed him to iſſue a proclamation, to enforce obedience to the act of uniformity. They reſumed their inquiries into the late miſcarriages. Charles urged in vain, in repeated meſſages, the preſſure of his debts, in vain, the neceſſity of fitting out a fleet in conſequence of his engagements to his allies. The commons were deaf to his requeſts. Buckingham, who had promiſed to manage their leaders, was found deſtitute of influence. He could inflame them againſt the crown; but he had not talents to ſoothe them into a compliance with the deſires of the King. Brounker, on the evidence of Sir John Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, was expelled the houſe, and ordered to be impeached, for bringing to that officer pretended commands from the Duke of York to lower the ſails, after the battle near Southwold Bay. Commiſſioner Pett was impeached<note n="E" place="bottom">Journals, May 9.</note>. The inquiry, however, though carried on with ſeeming ſpirit, produced no ſignal puniſhments. The houſe was more eager in giving its full force to the act of uniformity, than in animadverting with ſeverity upon the authors of the late miſcarriages. The King, at length, iſſued a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation againſt ſectaries; and the commons, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, gave a ſupply of three hundred and ten thouſand pounds, by an impoſition on wines and other liquors.

He knew that the Duke's high ideas of the indefeaſible rights of monarchy were a ſufficient ſecurity for his loyalty. They tried, by mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the department of the admiralty, to force him to reſign. Oſborne and Lyttelton, two of their adherents, were, without the ceremony of ſpeaking to the Duke, made treaſurers of the navy, though they had chiefly managed the charge againſt Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don in the houſe of commons.

Buckingham, in the month of December, ſecretly ſignified his wiſh of being well with the Duke. But that Prince rejected his offers, for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer breaches of faith. This repulſe added reſentment to the fears of Buckingham. He endeavoured to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate to Charles the facility of divorcing his Queen.

The contempt which Charles expreſſed, upon many occaſions, for the former, had kindled a reſentment in his breaſt equal to the impatience of all authority, which the latter derived from a ſpirit naturally reſtleſs. The phlegmatic diſpoſition of the Duke was as diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Buckingham, as his avowed diſlike to thoſe who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves againſt his family was terrible to Aſhley. To open a field for their ambition, they thought it expedient to remove the old cavaliers from offices of the firſt truſt. None remained in a capacity more ſuitable to thwart their deſigns, than the Duke of Ormonde, who had added the advantage of a high character to an inviolable at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the royal family.

Albemarle refuſing to conſent to either, was aſſailed through the influence of his wife. The Ducheſs of Buckingham and Lady Harvey met to perſuade her to promote their views; but in vain. The nation were equally aſtoniſhed at Buckingham's confidence and influence. It will hereafter appear, that he was the dupe of a maſter whom he affected to command. Charles was no ſtranger to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.

But he had entered into councils, where want of principle became more uſeful in ſervants, than either ability or integrity. His ſecret meaſures, however, had not yet arrived at any degree of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity. A profligacy, which had obtained the name of pleaſure, and intrigues about places of profit and truſt, ſeemed to employ the whole attention of the King and miniſtry. Parliament had been ſo back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in giving money, that their attendance was not deſired. Domeſtic buſineſs went round, in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon circle of office.

This extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary perſon has been variouſly repreſented by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers; a circumſtance not ſurprizing, in a country where character is too often meaſured by the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard of political prejudice. His claim to perſonal courage, to military ſkill, to prudence in his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and moderation in his views, is by no party denied; though it ſhall always be queſtioned, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he owed ſo much to his abilities as to fortune.

The ſituation of Monk was, however, more delicate than that of many others, whoſe fortune it was to command na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by the terrors of the ſword. When he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Scotland with ſix thouſand men, more than forty thouſand veterans were in the hands of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in England. But his coolneſs and deliberation, were more than a match for the undeciſive enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm of Fleetwood; and he derived from his juſtice and influence with the ſoldiers, what the more ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did abilities of Lambert could never command.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0709200301:131"/>
to put the worſt conſtructions upon a deportment ſo different from their own. His taciturnity was no longer aſcribed to prudence, his frugality was diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the name of avarice, his diſregard to ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony denominated clowniſhneſs.

                  <note place="margin">Secret cauſe of the triple league.</note> The triple league, deemed the beſt meaſure of Charles, was in part the fruit of one of his worſt ſchemes. Inſtead of ſtopping the conqueſts of France, it was calculated to extend them, by forcing Lewis into an alliance with England. The aſcendant ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by Buckingham ſo unexpectedly in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of 1667, proceeded perhaps from the opinion which Charles entertained of his being an uſeful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument in his new-adopted deſigns. Purſued by meſſengers and warrants in the month of March, in the Tower in June, in July leading the cabinet.—All this could not have happened through mere ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>price. Some ſecret motive muſt have induced the King to truſt his councils in the hands of a man whoſe talents, in any ſerious buſineſs, he always deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed<note n="E" place="bottom">James II.</note>. Charles it is now known, made attempts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a cloſe connection with France before he finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Dutch war. To gain the confidence of Lewis, he had agreed to the French invaſion of Spaniſh Flanders. His ſiſter, the Ducheſs of Orleans, was partly truſted with the projects of Charles. She was intimate with Buckingham, and he probably became acquainted with all that ſhe knew of the connection between Charles and Lewis. The influence which
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0709200301:133"/>
he gained was at once the reward of his preſent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crecy, and an inducement to future ſervices. The ſudden change in the King toward Clarendon, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded perhaps from the ſame cauſe. He could not truſt that miniſter in an affair which, in its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, muſt infallibly either ruin the authority of the crown or the liberties of the people. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a miſtreſs, the clamours of the chancellor's enemies would perhaps have failed, could the King truſt him in his new meaſures. When he fell, Charles advanced without interruption in his favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite ſcheme. But Lewis was cold in his anſwers, and the triple league was formed<note n="F" place="bottom">Charles II. to Ducheſs of Orleans, Jan. 23, 1668.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Secret nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations with France.</note> The triple alliance was ſcarce ſigned, when the King and Buckingham began to renew their applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to France with an eagerneſs which, for ſome time, defeated their views. The whole of the year 1668 paſſed in fruitleſs negociations. The King of France either diſtruſted the ſincerity of Charles, or he had not yet opened his eyes to the advantages of an alliance which involved him in an immediate ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence. The enthuſiaſm of the Duke of York, who now was a convert to the Romiſh faith, though not formally reconciled to that communion, ſuggeſted to his brother the means of gaining Lewis to his own views. In a private meeting, held in the Duke's cloſet on the twenty-fifth of January, 1669, where the King, the Duke, the Earl of Arlington, the Lord Arundel of Wardour, and Sir Thomas Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford were preſent, Charles declared his zeal for the catholic religion<note n="G" place="bottom">James II. 1669.</note>. The reſult of the conſultation was, that to promote the faith in his kingdoms, a ſtrict union ſhould be made with France. This change in the object of the negotiation rendered it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to drop Buckingham<note n="H" place="bottom">Charles II. to Ducheſs of Orleans, March 22, 1669.</note>, who in his diſbelief of all religion, forgot not his averſion to the church of Rome. The ſame reaſon which obliged the King to remove Buckingham from the management of the treaty, induced him to truſt it to men of very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0709200301:134"/>
principles. The Lord Arundel, a rigid Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Catholic, was ſent to the court of France.—Arlington, a concealed papiſt, and Clifford, who avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his attachment to the Romiſh religion, managed at firſt the negotiation in the cabinet, and were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, with Sir Richard Bealling, an enthuſiaſt is the ſame faith, appointed commiſſioners to carry the treaty to a concluſion.

                  <note place="margin">Converſion of the Duke of York.</note> The Duke of York, who had been long waver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the point of religion, was now completely reconciled to the church of Rome. That unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate prince, who, from a conceited obſtinacy, affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be guided by reaſon in his opinions, ſuffered himſelf to be argued out of his ſmall remains of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtaniſm by the ſmooth ſophiſtry of Father Symons, a bigotted Jeſuit<note n="I" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Serious and melancholy in his diſpoſition, his mind was adapted by nature for ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition. During his exile he zealouſly adhered to the Proteſtant faith. Ardent and almoſt an enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt in all his ſpeculative opinions, he, in conſequence of a letter from his brother, inſiſted with vehemence that the Duke of Glouceſter ſhould be removed from his mother, on account of a report that ſhe endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to entice him to the religion of Rome<note n="K" place="bottom">Charles II. to the Duke of York, MS.</note>. His averſion to the principles of ſectaries, whom he deemed the irreconcilable enemies of monarchy, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined him firſt to a ſyſtem of faith, favourable to the quiet deſpotiſm which he ſo paſſionately loved. The converſion of Turenne is ſaid to have had its weight with his wavering mind; that great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander being one of the few characters whom he eſteemed and admired. A change ſo fatal to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, but, in the reſult, beneficial to his country, happened in the year 1669. Had the Duke of York continued a Proteſtant, the monarchy would have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come abſolute through his perſeverance and obſtinacy, qualities which ſupplied in him the place of great abilities and firmneſs of mind.</p>

The ſecret negotiation employed the attention of the Popiſh junto throughout the year 1669. The eagerneſs of Charles to receive two hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds, as the price of his converſion was coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teracted by that of Lewis to begin with the Dutch war. Notwithſtanding the enthuſiaſm of the latter, he ſubmitted it, upon the preſent occaſion, to his policy. He believed Charles to be ſincere, at the time that he himſelf was the dupe of his avarice. He thought that a precipitate declaration of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion would fill his hands with too much buſineſs at home, to be in a condition to aid his ally abroad. But Charles was obſtinate. The money for his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion was to be received before his declaration for Popery, and he endeavoured to conceal the impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience of his neceſſities under a zeal for the Romiſh faith. To put an end to the procraſtinations of Lewis, Charles played off another engine on his weakneſs. He inſtructed his reſident at the Hague to haſten the acceſſion of the Emperor and Spain to the triple alliance. De Pomponne, the ambaſſador of France to the States, informed his maſter of the concluſion of this formidable alliance. Lewis was alarmed. From being cold in the negotiation, he became a ſuitor; and the treaty was concluded in the beginning of the preſent year. In the mean time, Charles, to keep ſecret his agreement with France, ſuffered Buckingham, and his own ſiſter the Ducheſs of Orleans, who were abſolute ſtrangers to the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment already ſigned, to carry on a mock treaty; while, at the ſame time, he kept this mock treaty a ſecret from the Duke of York and the Earl of Arlington<note n="L" place="bottom">James II. 1669.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Ducheſs of Orleans comes to England.</note> Though Lewis had, in conſequence of the firſt agreement, paid a part of the two hundred thouſand pounds a-year, ſtipulated to be given to Charles, he reſolved to make one other experiment upon that prince, to induce him to begin with the Dutch war. To ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this purpoſe, he ſent the Ducheſs of Orleans to England. That princeſs undertook the journey with eagerneſs, having entertained ſome hopes that her

brother would retain her in England, where ſhe would be ſure of governing every thing, through his eaſineſs and her own addreſs<note n="L" place="bottom">James II. 1670.</note>. The Duke of York, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther jealous of his ſiſter's influence, or averſe to a Dutch war, which he foreſaw would involve the crown in difficulties, and throw the King upon the mercy of parliament, obſtructed with all his art the projected journey of the Ducheſs. He, however, failed in his views. The French King, having made a progreſs to view his conqueſts in Flanders, in the month of May, the princeſs paſſed the channel to Dover, where ſhe was met, on the ſixteenth, by the King her brother<note n="M" place="bottom">MS. conference.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Conference at Dover.</note> The Duke of York was detained in London, by the public buſineſs, two days after the King joined his ſiſter at Dover. Before the Duke arrived in that place, ſhe had perſuaded Charles to begin with the Dutch war<note n="N" place="bottom">James II. 1670.</note>. The Duke argued againſt this ſcheme. He urged the unprepared ſtate of the navy. He repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a war would leave the crown in the mercy of parliament, who, he might be aſſured, would not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a meaſure which they had not adviſed. Beſides, that an avowed concert with France would break all the views of the King at home, before they were ripe for execution<note n="O" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Charles inſiſted, that the cuſtoms, which yielded annually ſix hundred thouſand pounds, would be ſufficient, without any application to parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to maintain a fleet of fifty ſail; which, with thirty to be furniſhed by France, would be able to oppoſe the whole power of the Dutch at ſea. The Duke argued againſt the ſufficiency of that force in vain. Charles was obſtinate<note n="P" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. It is even affirmed, that he communicated to his ſiſter the inſincerity of his promiſe with regard to his declaration for Popery. <q rend="inline">"I entertain,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"a good opinion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic religion and its profeſſors.

During his health and

vigour, without any outrage on truth, Charles might have made the ſame declaration againſt any religion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Treaty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</note> On the firſt of June, the mock treaty, the ſame in ſubſtance with that already concluded, except in the article of the King's religion, was ſigned at Dover. It had been ſtipulated in the firſt treaty, that Charles, to ſupport himſelf in his declaration for Popery, ſhould receive two hundred thouſand pounds from the King of France: one half to be paid three months from the ratification of the treaty, and the other three months after the expiration of that time. In the preſent treaty, the triple alliance, in ſo far as it concerned the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement of the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, was to remain inviolable. But, in caſe the King of Spain ſhould die without iſſue, his dominions were to be divided between the contracting powers. Minorca, Oſtend, and all Spaniſh America, were to fall to the lot of Charles. All the territories of Spain in Europe were to be aſſigned to Lewis. To facilitate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of this grand object of the treaty, war was to be declared againſt the Dutch; and their dominions, after a proviſion made for the Prince of Orange, were to be ceded to France; except the iſlands Walkeron, L'Ecluſe, and Caſſante, together with all the ports to Maeſland-Sluys, reſerved for the King of England<note n="S" place="bottom">James II. 1670.</note>. To enable Charles to exert his force with vigour, a ſubſidy of eight hundred thouſand pounds was to be annually paid by France, during this eventual war. In the caſe of the deceaſe of the King of Spain, both the contracting powers were to join, at their own proper expence, to ſubject his American dominions to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; but Charles was to receive three pounds twelve ſhillings a-month for each man to be employed by ſea in reducing the Spaniſh territories in Europe under the dominion of the French King.<note n="T" place="bottom">Vid. Treaty.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note> Such was the treaty with France. The conditions, though known to many individuals, remained long a ſecret from the public. Though Charles ought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive no reputation from the part which he acted, it was evident that Lewis was the dupe of his deſigns. Had
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0709200301:138"/>
the government of England been as deſpotic in its con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſtitution as that of France, it would be difficult to ac<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cuſe the King of having neglected the intereſts of his ſubjects. By annihilating the trade of Holland with its independence, England, from its peculiar advantages, might be ſuppoſed to command the commerce of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; whilſt the wealth of America would provide it with reſources, which might for ever defeat the deſigns of France againſt its power. But commerce is neither to be acquired by violence, nor kept by force; and the danger of American treaſures had been even then aſcertained, by their effect on Spain. In the moſt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering light, the object of this treaty would prove, in the end, of no real advantage to the Engliſh nation; and it would, in the mean time, moſt certainly deprive them of their political freedom. The independence on parliament, which the poſſeſſion of treaſure might have given to the King, muſt have rendered the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy abſolute; an abject ſyſtem of government un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any ſovereign, but inſupportable under a careleſs and diſſolute prince. The King, however, extended not his principal views ſo far. Too indolent in his character, and unperſevering in his diſpoſition, preſent relief from his diſtreſſes was with him a greater object than future advantage. Though the King of Spain was ſickly, he might live many years; and Charles, by recent experience, had been convinced, that to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Dutch would at leaſt be a taſk of difficulty.</p>

The ſuddenneſs of her death created a ſuſpicion of poiſon; but it was found, upon opening her body, in the preſence of the Engliſh am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador, and an Engliſh phyſician and ſurgeon, that there was no foundation for the report<note n="X" place="bottom">James II. 1670.</note>.

nothing but her greatneſs of ſoul. She was a ſtranger to vanity, but full of that excuſable pride which guards her ſex from meanneſs, There was a ſweetneſs in her language, and a lively delicacy in her converſation, that gained her the hearts of all that heard her; and when ſhe expired, ſhe left ſcarce a dry eye in a court who are always thought to feel leſs than they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs<note n="Y" place="bottom">MS. de Coſn.</note>. The openneſs of her manner rendered her ſuſpected of an inclination to gallantry; and Lewis the Fourteenth was ſaid to have carried his attention to her beyond the bounds of the affection due to a brother's wife. Charles, who loved her to exceſs, lamented her ſincerely; but he was too fond of his connection with France to ſhew any ſymptoms of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, even when he ſuſpected that unfair means had been uſed to accompliſh her death. In her journey to Dover, the Ducheſs of Orleans was attended by a young lady of the name of Queroüaille, afterwards better known by the title of Ducheſs of Portſmouth.

                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note> IN England, the meaſures of the crown are ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly aſcribed to its ſervants, that the monarch frequently remains, without either cenſure or applauſe, at the head of the ſtate. The miniſter is thought to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe what he executes, and he only is the object of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, or the ſubject of praiſe. Charles, though he can derive little reputation from that circumſtance, was now the author of his own meaſures; and he choſe his ſervants, from their boldneſs to act, more than from their wiſdom to plan. In the courſe of a ſecret
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0709200301:141"/>
negotiation of three years, he diſcovered abilities wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of a more noble object; yet he, at the ſame time, betrayed a want of principle, which would diſgrace the moſt ſplendid deſigns. To deceive his allies, to dupe foreign powers, to ſhew a contempt for the faith of treaties, may derive ſome defence from great examples; but to adopt ſchemes too pernicious to be wholly laid open to ſuch bold and profligate ſervants as he had choſen, was peculiar to this King. This prince ſeems to have carried the vein of humour, which diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his private converſation, into his public tranſactions. In a contempt for the abilities of others, he delighted to uſe mankind as tools; and derive amuſement, as well as advantage, from follies occaſioned by his own want of ſincerity. His deſire of money was not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, more gratified with the ſums which he received from Lewis the Fourteenth, than his taſte for humour was ſatisfied at ſeeing that monarch becoming a kind of pander to his pleaſures.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Character of the cabal.</note> To carry into execution the ſecret treaty with France, Charles ſaw the neceſſity of employing more tools than thoſe by whom it had been ſigned. Clifford and Arlington, though men of conſiderable parts, were not of themſelves ſufficient to carry forward ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>popular meaſures. Three others, of more boldneſs and ſuperior profligacy, were admitted with them into the management of the great line of affairs. Theſe were Buckingham, Aſhley, and Lauderdale. This commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of five were, by a puerile conceit, denominated the cabal, from the initials of their names; an appellation rendered odious to poſterity by their meaſures. Honeſt in an uncommon way, they ſcarce, except Arlington, made any pretenſions to principle; and this ſingularity in him proceeded leſs from virtue, than an inherent timidity of mind. The moſt of them had loſt their regard to reputation, in their inſatiable deſires and an high opinion of their own abilities; being perſuaded, that parts alone are ſufficient to ſupport the character of a miniſtry with the world.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Clifford.</note> Clifford, whom his name has placed at the head of the cabal, deſerved that pre-eminence from another cauſe. To a boldneſs, which ſhrunk from no political

danger, he added an openneſs which approached to honeſty. He was a violent enemy, yet a ſincere friend<note n="A" place="bottom">James II. 1667.</note>; and though his prejudices led him into errors, he atoned for them, in ſome meaſure, by avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his conduct to the world. His eloquence in the houſe of commons brought him into notice; his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy with Arlington raiſed him firſt into office<note n="B" place="bottom">Ibid, 1668.</note>. Ardent and impetuous in his councils, he deſerved to be truſted from his ſpirit. His perſeverance in any plan acquired to him a firmneſs in all. The only ſymptom of weakneſs which he exhibited, was his avowed adherence to a ſyſtem of faith which the laws of his country did not recognize. But few men had then arrived at a degree of philoſophy ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move religion from the channel of their temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.</p>

He was little calculated for bold meaſures, on account of his natural timidity; and that defect created an opinion of his moderation, that was aſcribed to virtue. His facility to adopt new meaſures was forgotten in his readineſs to acknowledge the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the old. The deficiency in his integrity was forgiven in the decency of his diſhoneſty. Too weak not to be ſuperſtitious, yet poſſeſſing too much ſenſe to own his adherence to the church of Rome, he lived a Proteſtant, in his outward profeſſion; but he died a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic. Timidity was the chief characteriſtic of his mind; and that being known, he was even commanded by cowards<note n="C" place="bottom">James II. 1668.</note>.

Naturally reſtleſs in his temper, he loved trouble, from its amuſement; and though ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, he was fond of confuſion, more as a field for action, than as the means of acquiring power. His knowledge of human nature was extenſive. He was acquainted with the tempers of men, and commanded them through the channel of their ruling paſſions. Without the reputation of conſtancy, he gained the confidence of parties, through their opinion of his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents; and though he deſerted meaſures frequently, he never betrayed his friends. He was an eloquent ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er<note n="H" place="bottom">Ibid, 1681.</note>; but more ſubtle in his argument, than ſolid in his judgment; indefatigable in buſineſs, but verſatile and changeable in his ſchemes. Meaſuring the rules of policy, by his own variable paſſions, he was attached to no political principle, to no particular ſyſtem of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Now a republican, now all for monarchy; to-day a ſupporter of liberty, to-morrow the ſlave of abſolute power: and thus, though regularly under the dominion of his inſatiable deſires, he ſeemed always inconſiſtent with himſelf. During the firſt years of Charles, the attachment of the nation to their Sovereign deprived him of a field for exerting his abilities; which were only calculated to ſhine in times of tumult and confuſion. He continued in office, more through the influence of the Earl of Southampton, whoſe niece he had married, than from any opinion of his political conſequence. When Buckingham acquired influence, he attached himſelf to his councils<note n="I" place="bottom">James II. 1668.</note>; and this near approach to Charles, was the means of diſcovering to him talents, which he deemed ſuitable for executing his ſchemes.</p>

The acceſs to Buckingham was eaſy, through the channels of his vanity and avarice. The King of France aſſailed him through both. The Ducheſs of Orleans was ſoon forgot. He ran with eagerneſs into the views of the Kings; and Aſhley, who ſtill adhered to his councils, adopted, with lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle difficulty, the meaſure. A ridiculous farce was now begun. The treaty concluded at Dover, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in the article concerning the Popiſh religion, was brought again into negotiation, as originating from Buckingham.

                  <note place="margin">French in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of Lorrain.</note> While this pretended treaty was in agitation, Lewis formed his meaſures upon the faith of that already concluded. The invaſion of Holland was the chief object of the alliance; and he took the firſt ſtep toward the execution of the projected ſcheme. To the United Provinces from France, there were two ways for conducting an army. The one lay through the Spaniſh Netherlands, the other through the territories of the German Princes upon the Rhine. A voluntary paſſage through the firſt was not to be expected; and to force it would be both dangerous and tedious. The latter appeared to be attended with the leaſt difficulty and moſt advantage. The petty princes of Germany might be inſulted with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or corrupted with eaſe. The Duke of Lorrain, as being the neareſt, was the firſt attacked. To gain his concurrence was impoſſible, on account of the memory of former injuries. Lewis reſolved to ſeize the dominions of a Prince, whom he could not hope to allure to his views. Beſides, the duchy of Lor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rain was in itſelf a valuable acquiſition as well as
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0709200301:147"/>
convenient for his other deſigns. In breach of the faith of treaties, in the height of ſecurity and peace, the Mareſchal de Crequi entered Lorrain.

The few who ſuſpected the King of England of being privy to the invaſion, dreamed of no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign againſt Holland. The moderate declarations of France, though they received not full credit, created ſuſpenſe; and the States, though ſuſpicious, took no vigorous meaſures for their own defence. In the mean time, the parliament met<note n="T" place="bottom">Journals, Oct. 24, 1670.</note>; and Charles, by the mouth of the lord-keeper Bridgman, took advantage of the preſent ſituation of affairs, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a ſupply. He informed them, that both France and the States were buſy in arming by ſea and land; and that prudence dictated to the King to make ſuitable preparations. He urged that, from the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the kingdom, as an iſland, the defence of its liberties, and the ſecurity of its commerce, lay in its ſtrength at ſea; and that therefore his Majeſty, to preſerve both, had given orders for the fitting out fifty of his largeſt ſhips, againſt the ſpring. He told them, that, beſides, the King was obliged, by the leagues which he had made for the peace of Europe, to keep up a certain force, to preſerve the public tranquillity, and to aid ſome of his neighbours, in caſe of invaſion.

In the propoſed partition of the territories of the Dutch republic, care was taken to reſerve a portion to form a ſovereignty for the family of Orange.

They ordered a bill to be brought in, upon the debates of the houſe, for ſetting a day, under the penalty of baniſhment, to Sir Thomas Sandys, Obrien, and the other actors in aſſaulting and wounding Coventry, to ſurrender themſelves to public juſtice. This bill, which was paſſed with the utmoſt expedition, contained a clauſe which precluded the crown from pardoning the offenders.

The project was defeated, by the joint efforts of the Archbiſhop of Canterbury and the Duke of York<note n="P" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The firſt oppoſed it, from his zeal for the church of England; the latter from his bigoned adherence to the tenets of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh faith.

The vanity of commanding ſix thouſand men, as an aid from England to France in the Dutch war, was one of the chief motives to the eagerneſs with which Bucking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham entered into that ſcheme. Mountague, the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh ambaſſador, had induced Lewis to depart from that demand.

He executed his inſtructions with ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, that Charles the Eleventh, who promiſed at firſt to remain neuter, took afterwards an actual part with France and England in the war.

in the end of November, took Paris in his way to the court of Spain. To widen the breach with the States, Sir George Downing ſet out in the beginning of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, with the title of ambaſſador, to the Hague. The rude pertinacity of Downing, and the averſion which aroſe, from a perfect knowledge of his charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, among the Dutch, rendered him fit for a journey, the object of which was to find a ſpecious pretence for war. His buſineſs was to complain, and not to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate; to denounce vengeance, more than to demand ſatisfaction. It was remarkable, that during the four years ſince the treaty of Breda, the Dutch had fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed no ground of complaint, except the reſuſal of their admiral, in the month of Auguſt, to ſtrike to the Engliſh flag. Their fears of France had reduced them into a temper that wiſhed to retain the friendſhip of England by their own moderation.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer ſhut.</note> To ſupply his immediate wants, the King adopted a ſcheme, as ruinous to his future convenience as it was contrary to the public faith. The ſhutting up the exchequer, attributed to the ſuggeſtions of Aſhley<note n="K" place="bottom">Arlington's Letters.</note>, and adopted by Clifford, is juſtly deemed, if not the worſt, the moſt imprudent meaſure of the preſent reign. On the ſecond of January, Charles iſſued a proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſuſpending all payments upon aſſignations in the exchequer for one whole year. An explanation of the ſubject may throw light on the hardſhips attending a meaſure, which filled London with a general diſtruſt and conſternation. The goldſmiths, who then were the bankers, were accuſtomed to advance their money in the exchequer upon the ſecurity of the funds upon which parliament had charged their ſupplies. They derived, from the neceſſities of the crown, an ample intereſt for their loans; and they were repaid gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, as the money levied upon the public came into the exchequer. One million four hundred thouſand pounds had been, at eight <hi>per cent.</hi> lodged in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, upon the faith of the money-bills paſſed in the laſt ſeſſion of parliament<note n="L" place="bottom">R. Coke, p. 168.</note>. This ſum had already been expended upon the preparations for a war. To apply the funds, as they came in, to the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, was the object of a meaſure that was adopted with ſuch ſecreſy, that the ſuddenneſs of the evil pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented its being preceded by fear.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note> The murmurs of the people, the conſternation of the citizens, the ſtagnation which diſtruſt created in commerce, were loſt on the King and his ſervants. Clifford was a man whom political danger could not intimidate. Aſhley, the adviſer of the ſcheme, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the confuſion. Buckingham, in the abſence of all principle, looked forward to the ſpoils of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try which he laboured to enſlave. The King was ſo much elevated, at his having his wants ſupplied with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0709200301:161"/>
the aid of parliament, that he thought himſelf ſo ſure of ſucceſs, that he became careleſs of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of his ſubjects. The conqueſt of the Dutch Republic, he ſuppoſed, would ſcarce furniſh employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for one campaign; and he could ſtrike off, from that moment, the fetters that rendered him ſo uneaſy at home. He, however, endeavoured to juſtify his conduct to the world. He ſignified the neceſſity of making preparations, ſuitable to thoſe of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, as the only excuſe for a meaſure, of which he pretended not to approve. He promiſed repayment, with ſix <hi>per cent.</hi> intereſt, at the expiration of the year. He probably intended what he ſaid; for Charles was not, by nature, unjuſt. But he abhorred pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary diſtreſs, and ſacrificed principle to procure eaſe. Through the deſpair of a ſpendthrift, he became pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fligate; and juſtified to his own mind, his worſt ſchemes, by the neceſſities impoſed by the parſimony of parliament.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> Charles, provided with money, by ſhutting the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, now ſeriouſly applied himſelf to preparations for a war. To man the fleet, it was propoſed in the cabinet, to lay an embargo on all veſſels outward bound. The Duke of York oppoſed this meaſure, as a ſtop to trade and a detriment to the revenue.<note n="M" place="bottom">James II. 1672.</note>. To ſupport his opinion, he undertook to man the fleet without any violence; provided the Newfoundland trade might be ſuſpended for the ſeaſon. Being deſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to command the fleet in perſon, he required only ſixty Engliſh ſhips of the line, twenty frigates, and thirty French men of war to compoſe the main fleet. He urged that, in that caſe, a ſufficient number of men and ſhips would be left for convoys; ſo that the war would create no interruption to commerce<note n="N" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Tho' the miniſtry ſeemed to yield in ſome degree to his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, they afterwards iſſued a rigorous proclamation for preſſing men. The Duke, by his indefatigable induſtry, performed his promiſe. The fleet was man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, with little reſtraint on ſailors; and without any conſiderable obſtruction to trade. To accommodate
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0709200301:162"/>
the merchants, Charles ſoon after exerted his prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative. He ſuſpended the act of navigation, by his royal will and pleaſure: a meaſure of apparent uſe to commerce, though as a precedent, dangerous. The King now acted in every thing as if he were abſolute. He looked upon the ſucceſs of the war as certain; and he hoped to become independent of a parliament, whoſe parſimony was the ſole check on his power.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Attack on the Smyrna fleet.</note> His firſt meaſure in the war met with little ſucceſs; and it deſerved no applauſe. The attempt upon the Smyrna fleet, was called piracy by the Dutch; and few Engliſh writers gave it a ſofter name. To attack an enemy, without a formal declaration of war, was not then juſtified by example; though it has fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſince been aſcribed to ſpirit, or conſidered as the reſult of political prudence. Sir Robert Holmes, with ſeven frigates, was ordered to intercept the Smyrna fleet, as it paſſed through the channel. On the thirteenth of March, he deſcried them off Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth. They conſiſted of ſixty merchant-men, under the convoy of ſeven ſhips of war<note n="O" place="bottom">James II. 1672.</note>. They were prepared for defence. The Dutch, ſuſpecting the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of the court of England, had armed their mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant-men, to prevent a ſurprize. Holmes being a ſtranger to their ſtrength, availed not himſelf of the aid of Sir Edw. Spragge, who paſſed in ſight<note n="P" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Downs, with the fleet which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in the Streights. He entertained alſo a private pique againſt Spragge, and he envied him a ſhare in the glory which he hoped to acquire. The event was anſwerable to his folly. He engaged with courage, but he failed in conduct. The Dutch, in a running fight, defended themſelves with ſpirit. Their admiral was at length killed, and his ſhip ſunk. Four merchant ſhips, of little value, fell into the hands of Holmes. The reſt eſcaped, in a fog, to their ports<note n="Q" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>; and thus the King loſt his reputation, without gaining any ſolid advantage.</p>

Charles ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſome frivolous reaſons. Lewis aſcribed his conduct to the demands of his glory. The firſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of commercial injuries, of a breach on the honours of his flag, of ſeveral infractions of the treaty of Breda. The latter expreſſed his reſentment againſt the inſolence of the Dutch ambaſſador, and the impertinence of the Dutch news-papers<note n="T" place="bottom">Henault, 1672.</note>. The declarations of both were as ill conceived, as their complaints were ill-founded. Without the boldneſs to avow, or the art to conceal their real views, they rendered their ſpirit as much ſuſpected as their pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. Charles, with an inſult upon the common ſenſe of mankind, declared his adherence to the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle<note n="U" place="bottom">Vide declaration.</note>, at the very time he broke thro' all the ties of the triple alliance. This artifice was intended to amuſe the court of Spain; who, he ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, might be kept in a ſtate of neutrality, from a proſpect of their own ſafety.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Declaration of indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</note> Charles was as unfortunate in the reputation, as he was in the iſſue of all his meaſures. Having once fallen under ſuſpicion, his beſt ſchemes were aſcribed to the worſt deſigns. His tolerant principles were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>variably conſtrued into a bias toward Popery; and a freſh exertion of prerogative, in favour of the Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, was ſcarce received by themſelves, without jealouſy and fear.

The King did by proclamation, what the parliament ſhould have done by law. Though Aſhley was the adviſer of the meaſure, it was aſcribed to the bigotry of the Duke of York; and the nation, entertaining that opinion, had ſome ground for their fears.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Promotions and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</note> To ſupport the credit of his domeſtic meaſures, as well as to ſtrengthen his hands in the war, the King called to his council ſeveral noblemen of popularity and reputation. The Marquis of Worceſter, the Lords Hallifax and Falconberg took their ſeats at the board, on the ſeventeenth of April, together with the Earl of Eſſex, whom the King had declared lord-lieutenant of Ireland. The cabal were diſtinguiſhed with more peculiar favours<note n="Y" place="bottom">Kennet's Hiſt. vol. iii.</note>. The Earl of Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derdale was raiſed to a Dukedom, in the kingdom of Scotland. Lord Arlington was dignified with the title of Earl, Aſhley created Earl of Shaftſbury, and Clif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford made a Baron by the ſame name. The garter was given to Lauderdale and Arlington. Buckingham, having arrived at the ſummit of honours, was left to be rewarded by the generoſity of France; whoſe meaſures he ſupported to the utmoſt pitch of his fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuating abilities. In a perfect ſubmiſſion to the King, in a harmony created by fear, among themſelves, the cabal managed the great line of buſineſs. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the ſecret of affairs, the reſt of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil only gave their authority to what they had not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed.

he weighed anchor, and was carried down the channel with a freſh gale at Weſt. In the evening he had ſight of the Dutch, off Long Sand Head. He ſtood to South; and, at night, the gale growing freſher and bad weather coming on, he came to anchor. When morning came, he gave no day-break ſignal for ſailing, on account of the vicinity of the enemy. But the wind coming up at Eaſt, he paſſed in a thick fog by De Ruyter, without being ſeen; and joined, the next morning, the French, under D'Eſtrees, at St. Helens. He remained there two days to adjuſt mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for action, and then ſailed in queſt of the Dutch. The Duke himſelf, in the Prince of one hundred guns, commanded the red ſquadron. Sir Edward Spragge in the London, a firſt rate; Sir John Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the Charles; and the Count D'Eſtrees in the St. Philip, of between eighty and ninety guns, led on the white ſquadron; and the Earl of Sandwich, in the Royal James of one hundred guns, was admiral of the blue<note n="Z" place="bottom">James II. 1672.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">They ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize</note> During the Duke's ſtay at St. Helens, the Dutch had retired to their own coaſt. They lay behind the Rumble ſands, hoping to draw the Engliſh upon that dangerous bank. The Duke, perceiving the ſtrong ſituation of the enemy, ſtood for the coaſt of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. De Ruyter, the beſt ſeaman of his time<note n="A" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, ſtood in for the banks; and, as his ſhips drew leſs water, deprived the Engliſh of an opportunity of fighting but to great diſadvantage. The weather being very bad, the Duke repaired to Southwold bay, where he anchored to take in water and freſh provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; declaring firſt to his admirals, that when the wind turned Eaſt, he was determined to put to ſea<note n="B" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. He gave ſtrict orders, in the mean time, that neither trader nor collier ſhould be permitted to go round, for fear of falling into the enemy's hands; who, by that means, might gain intelligence how his fleet lay. A light ſhip, however, ſlipped by in the night. She was taken and carried to De Ruyter, who ordered his fleet to ſail at day-break, to attack the Engliſh, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0709200301:166"/>
for the fight. The Duke perceiving the change of the wind, gave orders for the ſignal to ſtand out to ſea, to be in a poſture to receive the Dutch; but Sir John Cox, his captain, perſuaded him that he had received certain intelligence from one of his crui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zers, that the Dutch lay, in the ſame unprepared con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, off the iſland of Gorée. Thus, on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-eighth of May, was the Duke ſurpriſed, at two in the morning, by the Dutch fleet<note n="C" place="bottom">James II. 1672.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">the Duke of York.</note> The captain of a French fourth-rate brought to the Duke the firſt intelligence of De Ruyter's approach. Having been out on a cruize the day before, his ſhip, a bad ſailer, could not get in among the fleet the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding evening. He had been forced to come to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor a league to the eaſtward of the outermoſt ſhips, for fear of being driven to the leeward of the fleet, the wind being north-eaſt, and a leeward tide. This circumſtance furniſhed him with an opportunity of having the firſt knowledge of the enemy. As he was getting under ſail, two Dutch ſcouts fell in with him; and though each was of equal force, they forbore to fire, brought to, and then ſtood away. He rightly judged that their fleet was not far aſtern. To give notice of the enemy's approach, he fired all the way as he ſtood in toward the Engliſh. At break of day, the Dutch were ſeen to the windward, bearing down on the Duke. Their firſt line and their fire-ſhips were nearer in with the ſhore. Their flag-ſhips were farther to ſea. The Duke of York, on the firſt alarm, got his whole fleet under ſail. He endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to place them in their ſeveral ſtations in order of battle; but by reaſon of the leeward tide and eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wind, few could get in when the engagement began. Not above twenty of the red and blue bore the whole brunt of De Ruyter and Van Ghent's ſquadrons. The French were ſcarce charged at all by the Zealand ſquadron<note n="D" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Battle of Southwold bay.</note> At eight of the clock in the morning the battle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, the Dutch fleet having the wind. De Ruyter's ſquadron bore down on the red, commanded by the

Duke of York. Van Ghent oppoſed himſelf to the Earl of Sandwich, who led the few ſhips of the blue that could fall into the line. The Dutch, uſing their chain-ſhot, and directing their fire to the rigging, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled the Prince; and his Royal Highneſs was obliged to ſhift his flag on board the St. Michael, commanded by Sir Robert Holmes<note n="D" place="bottom">Public Intell.</note>. Two ſhips ſent to burn the Prince were ſunk by the Duke. But the Earl of Sandwich, after performing prodigies of valour, was burnt in the Royal James. In a cloſe engagement with Van Ghent, he blew that admiral, and beat off his ſhip<note n="E" place="bottom">James II. 1672.</note>. He ſunk another ſhip which laid him on board. He ſent to the bottom two fire-ſhips as they advanced. Of one thouſand men on board, one half were ſaid to be dead on the deck, before his ſhip was burnt by a third fire-ſhip. The Earl himſelf was drowned in endeavouring to ſwim to ſome other ſhip. There is no reaſon to ſuſpect that he ſacrificed his life to a reflection on his courage, uttered by the Duke of York. A difference of opinion could not have happened between them about putting to ſea. The Duke was earneſt for that meaſure<note n="F" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>; though he ſuffered himſelf to be perſuaded by the advice of others<note n="G" place="bottom">James II. 1672.</note>. Beſides, his Royal Highneſs was too courteous and well-bred to uſe a harſh expreſſion to a perſon of ſuch high diſtinction, and his own ſecond in command. He acknowledged the great merit of the Earl, a little before the battle, in a letter written with his own hand. Beſides, the account which he gives of this unfortunate accident precludes every idea of his having any quarrel with the Earl<note n="H" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

The battle declining on both ſides, the two fleets lay by for the night. The Duke thought it right to retire in the morning. The Dutch, by way of bravado, followed him in his retreat: but he turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon them, and renewed the fight. Sir Joſeph Jordan, in the mean time, gaining the weather-gage
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0709200301:168"/>
of the enemy, De Ruyter fled. The Duke purſued him to his own coaſt. Fifteen of his diſabled ſhips, left in his rear, could only be ſaved by a ſudden fog. The Engliſh hung cloſe on his flight. Foul weather prevented next day a renewal of the fight; and the Dutch retired to their ports. The Duke cruized for a fortnight between the Vly and the Texel, remaining maſter of the ſea: but the weather being uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly foul, the Dutch Eaſt-India fleet had the good fortune to paſs him unſeen in a ſtorm. In this battle, where twenty ſhips<note n="I" place="bottom">James II. 1672.</note> only were engaged on the ſide of the Engliſh, the Dutch had manifeſtly the worſt: moſt of their great ſhips were miſerably ſhattered; one was ſunk by the Earl of Sandwich, and another by Sir Edward Spragge: one veſſel of force was taken, another was burnt in the line; and ſeveral ſhips that were miſſing, were thought to periſh in the ſucceeding ſtorm, through the damage which they had received in the fight<note n="K" place="bottom">Contin. of Heath, 1672.</note>. The Engliſh loſt only one ſhip, the Royal James; but ſeveral were diſabled, and more than ſeven hundred men ſlain.

To the higheſt reputation for courage, he joined a coolneſs ſeldom annexed to the fervour of perſonal valour. His knowledge in naval affairs could be only equalled by his addreſs in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the cabinet, though his unintriguing diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition rendered him unfit for the ſecret councils of Charles. He was affable in his deportment, liberal without vanity, and a lover of magnificence without profuſion<note n="M" place="bottom">Henault, 1672.</note>. His turn for mechanics induced him firſt to engage in a ſea life. He ſerved his country during the republic, without ſharing in the councils, by which, under the maſk of liberty, it was in a great meaſure enſlaved. The great part which he took it

His body, diſcovered by the order on his coat, was found floating in the ſea after the action, and conveyed to Harwich. Being brought to Deptford on the third of July, it was was buried, at the expence of the King, with great funeral pomp, in King Henry the Seventh's chapel, in the ſame vault with the Duke of Albemarle. He might have eſcaped from the ſhip with the captain and many of his crew, who were ſaved, but he is ſaid to have preferred death to the riſque of being taken and carried to Holland in triumph.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Progreſs of France.</note> During theſe operations at ſea, a ſtrom more dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was faſt advancing on Holland by land. The King of France, dividing into three bodies an army con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 120,000 men, put them all in motion in the beginning of May. The firſt he led in perſon, with the famous Turenne. The Prince of Condé com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſecond; the Count de Chamilli the third. The latter took Maſeic on the fifteenth of May. Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoi fell into the hands of the King on the third of June. Burich yielded to the arms of Turenne. Rhim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg opened its gates on the ſixth of the month to Lewis. Beauviré ſeized Doëtkum on the eighth. Grool was taken on the ninth, by the troops of the Biſhop of Munſter. The twelfth of June was ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized by the paſſage of the Rhine. Turenne became, three days after, maſter of Arnheim. Shenk, which coſt a ſiege of nine months to the Dutch, when they took it from Spain, fell in leſs than half that number of days into the hands of that great commander. Utrecht ſubmitted on the twentieth to Lewis. Doeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, Deventer, and Zuvol ſurrendered to the Biſhop of Munſter. On the ninth of July, Nimeguen was taken by Turenne Naerden, within nine miles of Amſterdam, fell on the twelfth into the hands of the Marquis of Rocheſort. The fate of the States hung on the edge of a moment. Had Rochefort taken poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of Muyden, Amſterdam would fall, and with it the republic of Holland<note n="N" place="bottom">Henault, 1672.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reduction of three provinces.</note> The progreſs of Lewis, like the courſe of an inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, levelled every thing, then covered all. March<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth to conqueſt rather than to war, he carried the magnificence and gaiety of a court to the field. With all the triumphs of a victor he entered Utrecht; though he owed more to the unprepared ſtate of the enemy than to his own conduct. Surrounded with flatterers and attended by poets, to celebrate his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits, he gave ſcope to that vanity, which in him was a kind of virtue. To men who meaſure merit by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, there certainly appeared a foundation for fame. In the courſe of a few weeks, the three provinces of Gueldres, Utrecht, and Overyſſel had ſubmitted to the arms of France. Frieſeland and Gronighen were invaded by her ally, the Biſhop of Munſter. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime provinces, Holland and Zealand, only remained free. Forty fortified cities either opened their gates through terror, or, after a faint reſiſtance, ſurrendered without terms. Europe was ſtruck with aſtoniſhment rather than with admiration. The Dutch, unmanned by their fears, left almoſt a bloodleſs victory to Lewis. The enemy, by their cowardice, deprived the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror of glory; and ſeemed, by their ſpiritleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, to be even unworthy of their independence.</p>

Divided into factions, every ſcheme for defence was either oppoſed, or ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ineffectual, by being retarded. Terror itſelf could not eſtabliſh unanimity among parties embittered againſt each other by a long oppoſition. The Louveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tein faction, who carried in their very appellation the memory of an injury, were the moſt numerous, and headed by the penſionary De Wit. The adherents of the Prince of Orange, weakened by a long minority, began to acquire ſtrength and conſequence, from their leader's character and years. Theſe two parties, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with a third, who affected a kind of neutrality, comprehended the whole body of the States. The moderate faction, impreſſed with a ſenſe of danger, or in hopes to regain the favour of the King of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, joined the friends of the Prince of Orange; and on the twenty-fourth of February he was raiſed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0709200301:171"/>
to the dignity of Captain-general and Admiral of the United Provinces. The perpetual edict by which he was excluded from the Stadholderſhip, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unrepealed. The oppoſition of parties con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; and the intereſt of the public was neglected in their animoſities.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Character of the Prince of Orange.</note> The Prince of Orange began now, for the firſt time, to diſplay a character as ſingular in itſelf as the fortune of his life was extraordinary. To a gravity and ſilence which diſtinguiſhed his early youth with the prudence thought peculiar to years, he joined a firmneſs in all his meaſures that bordered on obſtinacy. Without a conſtitution for pleaſure, his chief object was an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition for power and a great name. Deſtitute of thoſe brilliant parts which dazzle the world, he acquired weight with mankind by the ſolidity of his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His perſonal courage was tempered with circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and coolneſs; his ſlowneſs in action corrected by his perſeverance. In his carriage and manner he was rather reſpectable than dignified, more decent than amiable in private life. Phlegmatic in his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he was ſubject to no paſſion in the extreme; and the ſame cauſe that exempted him from vice, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcured the luſtre of his virtues. Born with abilities for the cabinet, but with no great talents for the field, his policy, perpetually at war with his fortune, at length prevailed; and though he ſcarce ever won a battle, he frequently reaped all the advantages of victory from defeat. Though he cannot be accuſed of wanton ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, he was extremely fond of power; he ſacrific<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his virtue to his ambition; and, without any gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring injuſtice, frequently deſcended to meanneſſes to accompliſh his favourite deſigns. He was happy throughout his life in his opponent. The mad bigotry of James the Second might have furniſhed a field of triumph for abilities more circumſcribed than thoſe of the Prince, as the former had at once to contend with the favourite paſſions of his own people, and the art of his rival. Upon the whole, though great things reſulted from the conduct of the Prince of Orange, he was not poſſeſſed of thoſe brilliant qualities which are generally deemed neceſſary to conſtitute a great man.</p>

Orange. Unprovided with an army, and adding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation to their weakneſs, they were actually what they ſeemed, an eaſy prey. De Wit, who had govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their councils for many years, carried his private prejudices into his public conduct. In oppoſition to the power of the houſe of Orange, he diſcouraged a land force, and threw the whole ſtrength of the mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time provinces into the navy. Truſting to the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Spain, and fortified by their ancient alliance with France, the States themſelves had, ever ſince the peace of Weſtphalia, been extremely negligent of their troops. A ſhew of an army was kept up, but it was altogether deſtitute of diſcipline, and ignorant of every military duty. Though the troops were encreaſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the arrival of the French, to ſeventy thouſand men, they were ſo raw and timid, that the Prince, not daring to ſhew them to the enemy, retired to the province of Holland, whilſt Lewis took at his leiſure almoſt all the fortified towns of the upper Provinces.</p>

The States themſelves loſt their preſence of mind. De Wit, declining in his credit, could no longer animate his countrymen to their own defence: on the contrary, they now attributed their misfortunes to his neglect of the army. All perſons ran with violence into the party of the Prince of Orange, and ſeemed to think that the very being of the States depended upon his abilities. Amſterdam alone retained ſome appearance of ſpirit. They open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſluices, and laid their whole country under water. But the ſafety derived from that barrier againſt the enemy could not infuſe courage into the dejected States. The body of the nobles and eleven towns voted to ſend ambaſſadors to implore the pity of the two Kings. They offered to ſurrender all the frontier towns which lay beyond the limits of the ſeven pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, and to pay a conſiderable ſum toward the charges of the war. Lewis, left by Turenne, who had marched into Germany, was led in his councils by de Louvois and de Pomponne. The violence of

The other cities followed their example, and on the fifth of July the Prince of Orange was raiſed to the Stadtholderſhip of the unconquered provinces.</p>

The Populace, aſcribing their misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes to De Wit and his brother the bailiff of Putten, placed all their confidence in the Prince of Orange. A barber, in the beginning of Auguſt, accuſed the younger De Wit of having made him large offers for poiſoning the Prince. The magiſtrates intimidated by the mob, put him to the torture on this improbable charge. He bore it with an undaunted ſpirit: but he was ſtript of his employments, and baniſhed for life. The penſionary, who had reſigned his office, ſupported his brother through the whole proceeding.

A toe ſold for ten ſtivers, an ear for double that ſum, and a finger for twelve. This brutal commerce continued throughout the day.

His father was one of the ſix deputies whom William the Second arreſted and confined in the caſtle of Louveſtein. The hatred of the parent deſcended to the ſon. The connection of the royal

Though he was rouzed into terrors for his country by the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures which gave being to the triple league, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, in ſome degree, to his connections with Lewis. Ill informed of the motions of foreign courts, or ſwayed by his prejudice againſt a ſtanding army, he left his country expoſed to inſult, and even in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from conqueſt. His preparations were too late, and they were languid when they began. The firſt circumſtance ought to be aſcribed to himſelf; the latter aroſe from the difficulty of his ſituation.

Even the Prince of Orange, with all the advantages of his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made no ſtriking figure.

The ſums retained in the exchequer, and the large ſubſidies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from France, were unequal to the vaſt charge of the navy, and the demands of his own extravagance. He reſolved to call together his parliament. They met at Weſtminſter, on the fourth of February, 1673, after a receſs of near two years. Sir Edward Turner having been made chief baron of the exchequer, the commons proceeded to the election of a new ſpeaker. Their choice fell on Sir Job Charlton, whom they preſented the next day to the King for his approbation. His Majeſty's ſpeech partook of the firmneſs which had hitherto diſtinguiſhed the councils of the miniſtry. He mentioned the neceſſity, the importance and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the war; he made no doubt of the effectual aid of his commons to proſecute it with vigour. He informed them, that their laſt ſupply had not been found adequate to the diſcharge of his debts. He therefore recommended them again to their ſpecial care. He mentioned the indulgence to Diſſenters, and his fixed reſolution to adhere to his declaration. He made ſo light of the jealouſy that had ſpread abroad againſt the forces raiſed for the war, that he told them he muſt levy more in the courſe of the ſpring, and that he doubted not but they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the charge of them in their ſupplies.

great deal of abuſe on the Dutch, he added ſome new matter of his own. He excuſed the ſhutting of the exchequer by the neceſſity of the thing, and the benefit reſulting from it to the ſervice of the nation. He informed them, that the King was, in honour and intereſt, concerned in ſeeing the bankers repaid, with the ſix <hi>per cent.</hi> promiſed upon the money during the ſtop. But he deſired the commons to give only the ſecond place to that buſineſs; and firſt, to ſettle the neceſſary ſupply for carrying on with vigour the war. He defended the declaration of indulgence, with all the obvious arguments. He urged the neceſſity of augmenting the number of the forces. With a pero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration full of rhetoric, he concluded his ſpeech, expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his hopes, with an aſſurance ſuitable to his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that <q rend="inline">"the triple alliance of King, parliament, and people, might never be diſſolved."</q> Some diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented whiſpers among the commons ſuggeſted a new article, which the King added to his ſpeech.

It paſſed the lower houſe; but, retarded by amendments, it was loſt in the houſe of lords. The Diſſenters themſelves ſeemed leſs anxious for eaſe in their worſhip, than for the revocation of an indulgence, which placed the Papiſts on ſimilar footing with themſelves. The zeal of the commons proceeded more from their fears of that ſect, than from the more ſerious danger of the King's diſpenſing power. In their remonſtrance of grievances, they make no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeveral acts that had been ſuſpended by procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, in the preceding year. The capital faults in the meaſures of the crown, were alſo either neglected or forgot. The breach of the triple alliance, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with France, the ſhutting the exchequer, were paſſed over like common tranſactions. Popery was the terror and ſometimes the diſgrace of the preſent reign. Had the Duke of York continued Proteſtant, had Charles himſelf, like his father, adhered with firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and even with enthuſiaſm, to the church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, he might have enjoyed all the affluent eaſe, which ſeems to have been the ſole object of his life. But the folly of the Duke, in avowing publicly the ſyſtem of religion which his weakneſs had adopted, gave a juſt ground of jealouſy to the nation. The profeſſions of the King, in favour of toleration, were invariably aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to his partiality to a particular worſhip, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his profeſſed indifference to all religion.</p>

He ſuſpected the principles of ſeveral of the cabal, and he was at no pains to feign for them any regard.

aſcribed to the Crown's favour for popery, a ſcheme framed by a part of its ſervants to gain influence for themſelves. The law for impoſing a teſt on all who ſhould poſſeſs any public office, was carried forward by different men for various deſigns. The bulk of the nation favoured it, as the beſt bulwark againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery. A part of the miniſtry abetted it in ſecret, as an expedient to remove, from all their employments, the Duke of York, and the lord-treaſurer. The obſtinacy of the firſt was not more the object of their terror, than the daring abilities of the latter. Clifford avowed his attachment to the power of the crown, and he poſſeſſed courage to ſupport its moſt arbitrary meaſures.</p>

The thin veil which he had thrown over his converſion was removed; and he openly avowed what he could no longer conceal. Againſt him was chiefly levelled the teſt act.

Symmons, who had converted the Duke, was as narrow as his proſelyte in his principles. He abſolutely refuſed his conſent to any conformity with the eſtabliſhed religion; and thus he deprived his own church of the benefit of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt which he had made. If to change his religion was deemed folly in York, his avowal of that change was conſtrued into madneſs. Men ſaw a gloomy proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect before them; and their indignation kept pace with their fears, when they beheld the heir apparent ſo deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of prudence, as to own his attachment to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion which the people abhorred.</p>

of the Duke of Monmouth<note n="S" place="bottom">James II. 1673.</note>. He made uſe of an expreſſion upon the occaſion, fit only to be uttered by ſuch a miniſter as himſelf, or heard by ſuch a monarch as Charles.

The King anſwered, that he would rather ſee James, meaning Monmouth, hanged up at Tyburn, than entertain ſuch a thought<note n="U" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The chancellor, however, continued his ſchemes. Vaughan propoſed to move the houſe of commons to addreſs his Majeſty to put away the Queen, and to marry a proteſtant wife. A portion of five hundred thouſand pounds was at the ſame time to be offered<note n="X" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. On the twentieth of March, the propoſal was carried to the King at Whitehall, but upon his diſapproving of the meaſure, the motion was never made.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Character of the Duke of Monmouth.</note> The chancellor and his party, upon this new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment, reverted to their ſchemes in favour of Monmouth. In their eagerneſs to exclude the Duke of York from the ſucceſſion, they reſolved to place his his rival<note n="Y" place="bottom">James II. 1673.</note> in a ſituation which would enable him to ſeize the crown in the event of the King's demiſe. In the month of May they endeavoured to raiſe Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth to the regency of Scotland; but the vigilance of the Duke of York defeated their deſigns. The pride of Charles overcame his affection. He loved Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, but he hated to be deemed the huſband of Mrs. Walters. Some writers aſcribe to the republican principles of Shafteſbury this violent oppoſition to the Duke of York<note n="X" place="bottom">Carte's Ormonde, 1677.</note>. Monmouth, highly beloved by the populace, was a fit inſtrument to carry forward his deſigns. To a gracefulneſs which prejudiced man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in his favour as ſoon as ſeen, he joined an affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility which gained their love. Conſtant in his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and juſt to his word, by nature tender, and an utter enemy to ſeverity and cruelty. Active and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous in his conſtitution, he excelled in the manly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the field. He was perſonally brave. He loved the pomp, and the very dangers of war: but with theſe ſplendid qualities, he was vain to a degree of folly,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0709200301:186"/>
verſatile in his meaſures, weak in his underſtanding. He was ambitious without dignity, buſy without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, attempting ever to be artful, but always a tool. Thus, taking the applauſe of the multitude for a certain mark of merit, he was the dupe of his own vanity, and owed all his misfortunes to that weakneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Cauſe of the defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</note> The eagerneſs of Shafteſbury againſt the Duke of York ſhook his credit with Charles. The boldneſs of his councils, his readineſs to adopt any meaſure, had in ſome degree overcome the King's jealouſy of his principles and his averſion to his perſon. But when he ſaw him levelling all the force of his abilities againſt his family, he expreſſed himſelf in terms ſufficient to ſuggeſt a change of conduct to a man leſs provident than the chancellor. The monarch and the miniſter had long met upon equal ground. No ſtrangers to their own mutual hatred, each endeavoured to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the other into a tool. It was a ſtruggle of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as both were regardleſs of principle. The acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of Shafteſbury was more than a match for the indolence of Charles. The ſolid underſtanding of the latter overcame the keen penetration of the former. The feeble ſide of the miniſter was vanity. The ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the Prince was his moſt vulnerable weakneſs.

The timidity of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lington ſuited not the violent politics of Clifford. The boiſterous precipitancy of Lauderdale was ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matched with the intriguing, though active, abilities of Shafteſbury. Buckingham, who had firſt formed the great line of their projects, had ſunk, through his unſteadineſs, into the contempt of all. But tho' the chancellor had abetted the teſt, he continued ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate to the laſt, in favour of indulgence. His rage againſt France, for inducing the King to relinquiſh it, raiſed his reſentment ſo far that he propoſed, on the twenty-third of March, to adhere to Clifford, if he would join him in breaking the French alliance<note n="Z" place="bottom">James II. 1673.</note>.</p>

On the twenty-ſixth of May he came before Schonevelt, where the fleet of the enemy lay.

The French performed not their duty in either battle. Lewis, in a fondneſs for his naval force, as yet in its infancy, gave ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions for preſerving his ſhips. The fleets loitered in their reſpective ports for two months after the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond action.

On the eleventh of Auguſt the fleets met near the mouth of the Texel. De Ruyter and Van Tromp led the Dutch. Count D'Eſtrees commanded the white ſquadron of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, Prince Rupert the main line, and Sir Edw. Spragge the blue. Van Tromp fell along-ſide of Spragge, and both fought with their wonted courage. Van Tromp was once forced to ſhift his flag. Spragge was compelled twice to change his ſhip; but when he was paſſing to a third, a ſhot took his boat, and he was drowned.

The Duke of York, having continued more than two years a widower, had, after a ſeries of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious negotiations fixed on a ſecond wife; and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her by his proxy, the Earl of Peterborow. This Princeſs was Mary d'Eſte, daughter of the Duke of Modena and of Laura Martinozzi.

On the twenty-ſeventh of October, the King opened the ſeſſion with a ſpeech from the throne. He informed the two houſes, that he hoped to have met them that day with an honourable peace; but that the Dutch had treated his ambaſſadors at Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logn with the contempt of conquerors, and not as might have been expected from men in their condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To ſupport the ſafety and honour of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he told them, he was obliged to aſk a ſupply, which, he hoped, the commons would render propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable to the occaſion, and to their known loyalty. He aſſured them of his firm adherence to all his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions and promiſes, for ſupporting the eſtabliſhed religion and the laws of the land; and he earneſtly recommended to their care the debt which he owed to the bankers and goldſmiths, through the ſhutting of the exchequer. Shafteſbury, as chancellor, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon every article. The part which he had to act was difficult.

late in their addreſs; and that the marriage was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready concluded by proxy, and could not be reverſed. The houſe was kindled into a flame. They voted a committee for preparing a general and ſevere teſt, to diſtinguiſh between Proteſtants and Papiſts. They reſolved, that thoſe who ſhould refuſe to take this new teſt ſhould be incapable of enjoying any office, and even to come within five miles of the court. They further reſolved, that no ſupply ſhould be granted, unleſs it appeared that the obſtinacy of the Dutch ſhould render it neceſſary; and they followed this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution with a new addreſs againſt the Duke's mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with a Roman-Catholic.<note n="E" place="bottom">Vide Journals, paſſim.</note>.</p>

The unexpected arrival of the uſher of the black rod broke ſhort the reſolves of the commons. Some diſagreeable motions were made, even after the uſher had knocked violently at the door. But the ſpeaker, favouring the court, left the chair, and prevented the queſtion from being brought to a vote. The commons attended the King in the houſe of lords. He excuſed the prorogation, by the neceſſity of preventing the very appearance of a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his parliament; and he promiſed, that <q rend="inline">"he would not be idle, during the receſs, in framing meaſures that might add to their ſatisfaction<note n="F" place="bottom">Journals, Nov. 4.</note>."</q>

The chancellor was long known to have privately joined the country party, and to have even formed the meaſures which he pretended to oppoſe. On the ninth of November, the King ſent for him, and demanded the great ſeal; which was inſtantly delivered into the cuſtody of Sir Heneage Finch<note n="G" place="bottom">James II. 1673.</note>. Having obtained a pardon for his paſt counſels, Shafte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſbury threw off all reſerve, and became an open ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the court. Communicating the ſecrets of the cabinet to the oppoſition, and adding to bad meaſures worſe inſinuations, he inflamed the minds of men with jealouſy and diſtruſt. The tranſition was eaſy, from a counſellor of tyranny to a ſeditious incendiary; and even this conduct was neceſſary to his own ſafety. The change ſurpriſed none, as his diſpoſition was known to all. In all revolutions during the thirty preceding years, he was the firſt in every turn of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Conſiſtent only with his own verſatility, he was indifferent about the glaring oppoſition in his meaſures and opinions. When chancellor, he was a fold aſſurer of unlimited prerogative.

The commons brought in a bill for impoſing a more rigid teſt to diſtinguiſh between Proteſtants and Papiſts. The bill was aimed by the popular party, at the inſtigation of Shafteſbury, againſt the Duke of York. The teſt contained a formal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of all the favourite tenets of the Romiſh church; the ſupremacy and infallibility of the Pope, the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, the invocation of ſaints. A new clauſe was added, to expel the Duke from the King's preſence and councils. It was to have been enacted, that no perſon who did not take the teſt ſhould, without leave firſt obtained under the hands of ſix privy-counſellors, preſume to come to

The Duke of York was excepted in this clauſe, by a majority of two upon a diviſion; and theſe two, Sir Charles Gaudy and Sir Anthony Deane, had taken only that day their ſeats in the houſe<note n="A" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The lords proceeded with equal ſpirit againſt Popery. The Earl of Saliſbury moved, on the twenty-fourth of January, for a bill to bread the Duke of York's children in the eſtabliſhed reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The Earl of Carliſle made a motion, that neither the King, nor any of the blood-royal to a certain degree, ſhould marry without the conſent of parliament.

Carliſle, ſeconded by Halifax, moved, that any of the blood-royal marrying a catholic, ſhould be declared incapable of ſucceeding to the throne.—Peterborrow, terming it a horrid motion, reprimanded them with great ſeverity. Shafteſbury, in his reply to Peterborrow, endeavoured to ſoften the motion, by declaring that it was to have no retroſpect. He quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed precedents, which the Lord Finch, in an elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate ſpeech, confuted. He endeavoured to convince the houſe, that the reſtricting the ſucceſſion by acts of parliament was contrary to the conſtitution of the kingdom. Several biſhops joined the lord-keeper in his arguments. They declared the motion of exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion contrary to the rules of Chriſtianity, and the doctrine of the church of England. The propoſition was at laſt laid aſide, and another ſubſtituted in its place. It was reſolved in general, that neither the King, nor any of the blood-royal ſhould marry a catholic without the conſent of parliament; but no penalty was annexed<note n="C" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.

the States. Though the parliament had declared their averſion to the war, though Charles might be forced to relinquiſh it through want of money, the Dutch prudently choſe not to depend upon fortune in remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from them a powerful enemy.

He added the influence of his court to the other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which obliged the King to liſten to terms.—The two houſes concurred in their advice for peace. The conditions, though little advantageous, were not diſhonourable for England. The honour of the flag was relinquiſhed by the Dutch.

                  <note place="margin">Parliament prorogued.</note> THOUGH the peace with Holland relieved the King from many of his difficulties, it ſooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not his parliament into any compliance. His me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, for ſeveral years, were thought ſo contrary to the intereſts of his ſubjects, at leaſt, ſo oppoſite to their opinions, that in purſuing them, he loſt almoſt all his former popularity and influence. Diſtruſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed among the people, and jealouſy joined all its force to faction in the houſe of commons. The endeavours of the King to ingratiate himſelf by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, were deſeated by the ſolly of his brother, who with an enthuſiaſm ſcarce conſiſtent with the poſſeſſion of reaſon, ſeemed to glory in a ſyſtem of faith which his country abhorred. The ferment was too high to be ſettled by any thing but time. The King came ſuddenly to the houſe of peers on the
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0709200301:202"/>
twenty-fourth of February<note n="F" place="bottom">Journals, Feb. 24.</note>, and prorogued his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to the tenth of November. No ſupply was granted, no bill whatſoever paſſed both houſes<note n="G" place="bottom">James II. 1674.</note>.—During debates of ſuch violence and long continuance, there was but one private bill and two of a public concern ſent up by the commons to the lords; and the latter ſent down to the lower houſe but one of each kind<note n="H" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Though the King's party could not prevent ſpirited reſolutions, they were ſufficiently nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous to clog the progreſs of bills that were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to the crown.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Charles meditates a peace.</note> The ſummer of the year 1674 produced no events of importance in England. Shafteſbury, with his uſual activity, endeavoured to keep up the jealouſies of the people till the meeting of parliament. Pretending a fear of being aſſaſſinated by the Papiſts, he lay in the city, in the houſe of one Cook, a fanatic; and exerted all his abilities to promote petitions to the King, for calling a parliament for the redreſs of grievances. His ſucceſs roſe not in proportion to his zeal. He was about to take a houſe in the city, but Charles ſent him a peremptory meſſage; and he retired to the country<note n="I" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. An unexpected tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity prevailed; and men ſeemed to have forgot their terrors for popery and arbitrary power. The war on the continent remained in an undeciſive ſtate. The Dutch, joined by Spain and the Empire, were now upon an equal footing with France, though provided with the beſt generals of the age, and well-appointed armies. The King, to gratify his people, aſſumed the character of a mediator between the contending powers; but either his ſincerity was ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by the allies, or their hopes of victory render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them dead to terms. The court of Spain, with its uſual violence, had engaged the Dutch to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the war till things ſhould be reſtored to the ſame ſituation as at the treaty of the Pyrenees.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Campaign in Germany</note> The French had three great armies in the field; the firſt in Germany, the ſecond in Flanders, and
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0709200301:203"/>
the third in Rouſſillon<note n="K" place="bottom">Hiſt. de France, vol. iii.</note>. On the ſide of Germany, the Mareſchal de Turenne, having paſſed the Rhine at Philipſburgh, defeated the Count Caprara, at Sint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeim, and poſſeſſed himſelf of the whole Palatinate, by driving the allies beyond the Neckar and the Maine. With twenty thouſand men, he fell upon an army of ſeventy, under the Duke of Lorrain, near Straſbourg, and drove them from the field with great loſs. He again defeated the allies at Malhauſen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of the campaign. Theſe repeated victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries drove the war from the confines of France. Franche Comté was in the mean time reduced by her arms. The King in perſon commanded his troops on that ſide. There was no enemy in the field; and town fell after town into his hands. The whole pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince was conquered with little bloodſhed; and Lewis, reſolving to retain it for ever, transferred the ſeat of public juſtice from Dole to Beſançon.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">and Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</note> On the eleventh of Auguſt<note n="L" place="bottom">Ibid.</note> was fought in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, the famous battle of Senef, a village between Marimont and Nivelle. The Prince of Orange, at the head of the army of the allies, conſiſting of eighty thouſand men, was oppoſed by an inferior force, under the Prince of Condé. The French at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the rear of the confederates, in a narrow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file, as they marched toward Binch; and throwing them into confuſion, ſeized a great part of their can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non and baggage. The Prince of Orange, leſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable for preventing misfortune than ſtopping its progreſs, acquired ſome glory, though he obtained no victory. He rallied his troops. He fell upon the enemy. He expoſed his own perſon. In the action, which was not finiſhed with the day, he joined the valour of a young ſoldier to the conduct of an expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced general. When night came on, both armies, as if by mutual conſent, put an end to the fight, and left the victory undecided. The loſs was almoſt equal. Six thouſand of each ſide lay dead on the field. The allies kept poſſeſſion of the place of battle, but the French had moſt trophies. The Prince of Orange

It ſaved Lewis from a powerful enemy, and Charles from ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes of clamorous grievances. He, in the mean time, endeavoured to gain the affection of his people, by ſoothing meaſures and condeſcending familiarities. He was reſolved to retain the city of London, which the oppoſition had made ſeveral attempts to gain. In the arts of pleaſing the multitude, the King was more than a match for any of his ſubjects. He accepted of an invitation to an entertainment in Guildhall, on the twenty-ninth of October, when Sir Robert Viner was ſworn lord-mayor. To flatter the citizens, he expreſſed a deſire of being one of their body; and he accordingly received the freedom of the city, at the chamberlain's office, by the hands of Sir Thomas Player. A circumſtance, trivial in itſelf, was follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by conſequences beneficial to the King.

He reſolved to ſound the Prince of Orange, and to form his own meaſures upon his views<note n="Q" place="bottom">James II. 1674.</note>. Though Arlington was in a kind of diſgrace, his avowed attachment to the Prince rendered him a fit agent, in any buſineſs in which his intereſt was concerned.

He was ſent to Holland in the beginning of December, and the Earl of Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſory was joined with him in a ſecret commiſſion. Their principal inſtruction was to offer the Princeſs Mary, the Duke of York's eldeſt daughter, in mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0709200301:206"/>
to the Prince<note n="S" place="bottom">James II. 1674</note>. The object of this proffered alliance was to engage the Prince of Orange to enter into the meaſures of the Engliſh court with regard to a peace with France; he having hitherto eluded the propoſals of mediation carried from Charles by Sir William Temple<note n="T" place="bottom">Temple.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">the Prince of Orange.</note> The Duke of York objected to the offer of his daughter, as it ought in decency to have come firſt from the Prince himſelf<note n="U" place="bottom">James II. 1674.</note>. The King told him, that Oſſory, chiefly truſted in that buſineſs, was to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing on the ſubject, till it ſhould be mentioned to him by the Prince<note n="X" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The Duke, ever ſubmiſſive to his brother, acquieſced in his pleaſure. But the Prince of Orange being bent on the proſecution of the war, the negotiation failed for the time. To diſguiſe his averſion to peace, he affected to be diſpleaſed with Arlington. He complained, that he had joined with his <q rend="inline">"good friends<note n="Y" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>"</q> Carliſle and Shafteſbury, in endeavouring to move the King to own the legitimacy of the Duke of Monmouth. Beſides, the proſpect of ſucceeding to the crown of England, in the right of Mary, had become leſs certain, by the advanced pregnancy of the Dutcheſs of York. A ſon would cut off all the hopes of the throne, which he might otherwiſe derive from the marriage. This obſtacle was ſoon after removed. The Ducheſs was brought to bed of a daughter, in the beginning of January<note n="Z" place="bottom">Public Intell.</note>; and the two brothers were ſtill deſtined to continue the only males of their family. The Prince, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, formed a ſecret connection with the popular party in England, by the means of one Frymans, a man of abandoned principles and a profligate life<note n="A" place="bottom">D'Avaux, vol. ii.</note>.

To regain, if poſſible, the good-will of his parliament, whoſe ſpeedy meeting his neceſſities required, he reſolved to put in rigorous execution the laws againſt Papiſts and conventicles. To iſſue a proclamation by his own mere motion, might carry the appearance of courting favour. He, therefore, through his miniſters, inſinuated to the archbiſhops and ſome other prelates, that, upon their requiſition, he was willing to execute to the letter the laws againſt all non-conformiſts, eſpecially againſt the Papiſts. The biſhops entered into his views, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed him to recall all the licences which had been granted for holding conventicles.

One Shirley had brought an appeal to the houſe of lords againſt Sir John Fagg, a member of the lower houſe. A warrant was iſſued againſt Shirley. The Lord Mohun forced it from the ſerjeant at arms.

The Earl of Danby, by character a cavalier and a favourer of the church, was ſupported in his meaſures by thoſe who affected his principles in the houſe of commons<note n="G" place="bottom">James II. 1675.</note>. To them he owed the victory, which he obtained over the diſaffected party in the articles of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment. In the houſe of lords, the influence of the biſhops, all of whom abetted Danby, carried matters high in their zeal for the crown. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to compare the preſent conduct of the commons to thoſe violences which had, thirty years before, laid in ruins both the church and the throne. To obſtruct ſuch deſigns, or to remedy the evil, the Earl of Lind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey introduced a bill for a new teſt. This was little more than extending to all perſons in office, and the members of both houſes of parliament, the oath im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon magiſtrates by the corporation-act in the year 1662. They were to declare it unlawful, upon any pretence, to take arms againſt the King; that they abhorred the traiterous poſition of taking arms by his authority againſt his perſon or his officers; and that they would not endeavour to make any alteration in the government of either the church or the ſtate<note n="H" place="bottom">Journals.</note>

The factious oppoſed it from ſpleen, the Roman-Catholics from their averſion to all teſts; and ſome conſcientious patriots, from the dangerous doctrine of non-reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which it contained. In the eyes of men who weighed matters with coolneſs, the abſurdity of ſuch a law rendered it nugatory; and they conſidered it as the means of increaſing perjuries, without enforcing obedience to government. The debates, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued ſeventeen days, were warm, and even violent. All the arguments that could be ſuggeſted by reaſon, or invented by ingenuity, were uſed on both ſides. That which had moſt force was, that the bill might deprive ſome ſcrupulous peers of their birth-right to vote. To obviate this objection, the lord-treaſurer moved<note n="I" place="bottom">James II. 1674.</note>, that the refuſing the oath might not inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacitate any lord from ſitting in the houſe. The Duke of York followed the motion with another, that it might be general for all bills.

In the former, the French took Dinain, in May; Hui and Limbourg, in June. The Prince of Orange, being taken ill of the ſmall-pox, was for ſome time detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the field.

He threw himſelf into Treves, and

The King of Sweden, plunging headlong into the war, in favour of France, met with nothing but misfortune. The Dutch, the Spaniards, the Danes, became at once his enemies. He was ſerved ill by his general. He was defeated by the Elector of Brandenburgh. He loſt all Pomerania. Bremerfurt was taken by the troops of Brunſwick-Lunenburg; Wolgaſt, by thoſe of Brandenburgh. Wiſmar fell into the hands of the Danes. During theſe tranſactions a congreſs was opened at Nimeguen; but the ſeaſon of peace was not yet arrived. The attention of Europe, during actions of inferior note, was called to the Upper Rhine. Two great armies, commanded by the two greateſt generals of the age, were oppoſed to each other on the banks of that river. Turenne guarded the confines of France with all his conſummate ſkill; Montecuculli endeavoured to carry the war into Alſace and Lorrain. Antiquity only could match the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe experienced commanders. The conteſt between ſuch talents could be only decided by fortune.</p>

Having ſpent near two months in all the moſt maſterly movements of war, he thought at laſt that the happy moment was arrived for attacking Montecuculli with advantage. When he was viewing the poſition of the enemy, a cannon-bullet put an end to his life<note n="L" place="bottom">July 27.</note>. The French, ſtruck with conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at the fall of their leader, thought of nothing but flight. A diſpute for the command between the Count de Lorges and the Marquis de Vaubrun was added to their other misſortunes. They retreated.
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0709200301:211"/>
Montecuculli hung cloſe on their heels. The valour of the Engliſh auxiliaries, who brought up the rear, ſaved the army. The French repaſſed the Rhine at Altenheim, the allies at Straſbourg. The Prince of Condé ſucceeded Turenne. He forced the enemy to raiſe the ſiege of Haguenau, to quit their deſigns on Saverne, and, at length, to repaſs the Rhine. The campaign, though upon the whole unfortunate to France, produced nothing that could decide the fate of the war.</p>

But the good fortune which had attended the allies in the preceding ſummer, began now to forſake their arms. The year began with an advantage at ſea in favour of the French. De Ruyter, who had ſailed from Holland in Auguſt with an intention to join the Spaniſh fleet, fell in with Du Queſne, on the eighth of January, on his way to throw ſuccours into Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſina. The French had the advantage. Meſſina was relieved. Another naval engagement, on the twenty-ſecond of April, was rendered memorable by the fall of the gallant De Ruyter, and the ſecond defeat of the Dutch.

                  <note place="margin">Affairs</note> The tyranny of Lauderdale and the vehemence of Sharpe continued to haraſs the Scots in their civil and religious concerns. The love of public liberty had not, for ſeveral years, raiſed any oppoſition in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but the enthuſiaſm of the Preſbyterians was not to be ſubdued by the rigours of the church. The flame which roſe among the commons of England againſt the meaſures of the crown, extended itſelf, in the year 1673, to Scotland. The Duke of Hamilton placed himſelf at the head of a formidable oppoſition to the corrupt adminiſtration of Lauderdale. A motion was made by Hamilton for conſidering the ſtate of the nation. Twenty perſons ſpoke ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively after the Duke, and ſupported his arguments with a long catalogue of public grievances. Lauder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale, with his uſual imperiouſneſs, endeavoured to intimidate the members; but that failing, he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed the parliament. The chiefs of the oppoſition repaired to London, to lay their complaints at the foot of the throne. They demanded the removal of Lauderdale, the redreſs of grievances, and an act of general oblivion. Charles received them with affabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and diſmiſſed them with promiſes. But the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodating policy of the miniſter ſoon broke the deſigns of the King, who ſacrificed the happineſs of his ſubjects, to an opinion of his being bound to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the meaſures of his ſervant.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">of Scotland.</note> Terrified at the reſolutions of the commons of England, Lauderdale endeavoured, in the year 1674, to gain the Preſbyterians of Scotland. The diſaffect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the former were ſuſpected of abetting the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious diſturbances which ſubſiſted in the latter. They hoped ſor a revival of thoſe troubles in the North, which were the ſource of the misfortunes of the crown in the preceding reign. It was even then ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0709200301:217"/>
and it is now known<note n="Y" place="bottom">D'Avaux.</note>, that the Dutch and the Prince of Orange correſponded with the Scotiſh fanatics. To prevent miſchiefs, which might ariſe from both theſe circumſtances, it was thought neceſſary to relax the ſeverities of the law againſt conventicles. Beſides, Lauderdale, whoſe councils were as bold as his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures were corrupt, had formed a ſcheme to employ the militia, which had been eſtabliſhed in Scotland in ſupport of the authority of the King, in his other do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. The lower ſort were almoſt all of the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterian perſuaſion; and it was hoped, that an indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to their principles might ſecure their fidelity, on an emergency. New alarms put an end to theſe lenient meaſures. The Preſbyterians were inebriated by their ſpiritual pride. The more they were indulged, the greater was their oppoſition to the civil authority. Lauderdale renewed his oppreſſions, and Sharpe his perſecutions. Political miſery was ſeen in every form; and even the ignorance of the ſervants of the crown became more fatal than their tyrannies. The year 1676 added the infamy of burning old women to other acts of barbarous deſpotiſm. Witchcraft itſelf was not too improbable for the belief of that age of enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Affairs of Ireland.</note> Ireland furniſhed nothing of great importance during the laſt four years. The Earl of Eſſex ſucceeded the Lord Berkley in the government, and managed it with more caution than abilities. Standing in awe of the Engliſh faction, and diffident of the Iriſh, he was lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid in his proceedings, and leſs anxious for doing good, than afraid of becoming the cauſe of harm. Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment went forward in its beaten track. The country was torn to pieces by the quarrels and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities of factions. But theſe were private diſtractions. In public, a ſhew of implicit obedience was obſerved by all parties towards the crown. Eſſex derived from his integrity that weight which his inactivity and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited abilities ſeemed to deny. Strictly adhering to the conſtitution, he refuſed obedience to the royal or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, when he thought them contrary to law. Charles
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0709200301:218"/>
was not offended with this part of his conduct. In the year 1665, he was permitted to come to England, to lay the ſtate of the Iriſh affairs before the crown; but he was remanded back to his office, with appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and even applauſe. Ireland was rather peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than quiet during his adminiſtration, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till the Duke of Ormonde received, for the third time, the government of that kingdom.</p>

Some whiſpers, rather than murmurs, in favour of their ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, were heard, through the tranquillity which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the kingdom. On the twenty-third of Dec. 1676<note n="Z" place="bottom">Kennet, vol iii</note>, a proclamation was iſſued for the two houſes to aſſemble at Weſtminſter, on the fifteenth of Feb. for the diſpatch of important affairs. France, alarmed at their meeting, began ſeriouſly to think of peace. Though Lewis had bought the neutrality, and even the favour of the King, he was afraid the parliament would force him to join his arms to thoſe of the allies. He propoſed to Don John of Auſtria to put an end to the war. He promiſed, upon condition that Spain ſhould cede the Low Countries, to give up Rouſillon, all Sicily, with twelve millions of livres, to enable her to recover Portugal from the houſe of Braganza. Four millions of livres were to be paid to Don John him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for his good offices in the propoſed treaty. Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg, and ſome places in Alſace, were to be reſtored to the Empire.

They wiſhed, he thought, to plunge him into neceſſities, that they might impoſe upon him what conditions they pleaſed; or to revive thoſe troubles which, from a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſource, had overturned his father's throne. To this impreſſion ought perhaps to be aſcribed the backward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Charles in entering into any war during the remaining part of his reign. He had no affection for the perſon of Lewis; he knew it was neither the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention nor the intereſt of that prince to render him abſolute; and there is no room to doubt, that he would have preferred ample ſupplies from his own ſubjects, to the pitiful and clandeſtine ſubſidies remitted from France. But he believed, that the oppoſition in the houſe of commons proceeded either from a republican ſpirit, or a motive of avarice; and that all thoſe who diſtinguiſhed themſelves againſt the meaſures of the crown, wiſhed to ruin monarchy, or to feed on its ſpoils<note n="C" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

The fears of the court were at leaſt equal to the hopes of the country party. The firſt ſaw a gloomy proſpect before them; but the folly of the latter diſappointed their own views. Buckingham, Shafteſbury, Saliſbury, and Wharton, who led the oppoſition in the houſe of lords, had, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the meeting of parliament, determined to queſtion its legality, on account of the length of the late receſs. It had been provided, by a ſtatute of Edward the Third, <q rend="inline">"that parliaments ſhould be held once every year, or oftener, if need be;"</q> and as the laſt proro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation had continued fifteen months, they concluded that the preſent parliament was virtually diſſolved. The Marquis of Wincheſter, and the Lords Halifax and Hollis, noblemen of the ſame party, adviſed them againſt this precipitate meaſure<note n="G" place="bottom">James II. 1677.</note>.

Three of theſe lords, by making their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, were ſoon after diſmiſſed. Shaficſbury owed

to his own obſtinacy a whole year's impriſonment. Having ſought in vain the remedy of the law, he was at laſt obliged to own the juſtice of his puniſhment, and to petition the lords for his freedom. This impolitic meaſure diſconcerted the popular party. They were frightened at the vigour of the houſe of peers<note n="H" place="bottom">James II. 1677.</note>; and dropt their intended accuſation of the Earl of Danby. In the houſe of commons they loſt ground by their raſh proceedings and their violence. On the twenty-ſixth of February, a ſum not exceeding ſix hundred thouſand pounds was voted, by way of land-tax, for building ſhips<note n="I" place="bottom">Journals, Feb. 21.</note>; and on the twelfth of March, a further ſupply was granted, by continuing the additional duty of exciſe for three years<note n="K" place="bottom">Ibid.

Reſolving themſelves into a committee of the whole houſe on the twenty-third of February, they came to a reſolution, that the extraordinary juriſdiction of the court of chancery and other courts of equity, in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters determinable by common law, is a grievance to the ſubject.

The popular party were not in the mean time idle. Having failed in their hopes of preventing a ſupply, they endeavoured to clog the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-bills in their progreſs, with queſtions, debates, and diviſions. They however prevailed in applying the ſum granted to the ſole uſe of building ſhips: but upon a motion of appropriating the revenue ariſing from tonnage and poundage to the navy, it paſſed in the negative, by a great majority<note n="N" place="bottom">Journals, Mar. 5. 175 againſt 124.</note>.

The trenches were opened on the ninth of March, and the place was taken on the ſeventeenth by ſurpriſe. Cambray, after a feeble reſiſtance, fell into the hands of the French on the fifth of April.

The King's meſſage and the anſwer of the commons were reciprocally preſented on the fifteenth of April. Charles coming in the afternoon of that day to the houſe of peers, gave his aſſent to ſuch bills as were ready, and ordered the parliament to adjourn to the twenty-firſt of May. During this ſhort receſs, it had been whiſpered abroad, that the King had no ſerious deſign of oppoſing France; and that he intended to apply to other uſes any ſupply the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſhould grant for ſupporting the confederates, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by negotiation or arms. The former conduct of Charles juſtified the ſuſpicion. To remove the diſtruſt, he ſent for the houſe on the third day<note n="U" place="bottom">Ibid. May 23.</note> after their meeting at Whitehall. He told them that he did not call them together merely to obtain a ſupply. He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured them, upon the word of a King, that they ſhould have no reaſon to repent any truſt they ſhould repoſe in him for the ſecurity of the kingdom; and he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively declared, that he would neither hazard his own ſafety nor theirs, until they ſhould place him in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter condition than he was able to place himſelf.</p>

He informed them, he was confident that ſuch a daring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion on the prerogative had not its example in any age, when the ſword was not drawn. He declared, that no condition, no ſituation, no misfortune ſhould induce him to depart from ſuch an eſſential right of the monarchy; and he concluded with aſſuring them, that, notwithſtanding their declining to grant a ſum, he would uſe all the means in his power for the ſecurity and ſatisfaction of his people.

But as it proceeded from the King's ſecret engagements with France, it furniſhes a new inſtance of that want of ſincerity which diſgraced his character. The love of money, as the means of procuring pleaſure, was the chief characteriſtic of Charles. To obtain that object, he diſregarded his fame, in a degree ſcarce conſiſtent with common ſenſe. When he urged the commons to ſtrengthen his hands for a war, he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſold his neutrality to France for two hundred thouſand pounds.

But to make an offenſive and defenſive alliance with the allies, as the condition of a ſupply, would deprive him of the ſecret ſubſidy and throw him upon the mercy of a parliament already averſe from his meaſures.

                  <note place="margin">State of France, and of the allies.</note> During the progreſs of the French arms in Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, ſerious negotiations for a peace were begun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Lewis and Holland. An eventual treaty was actually concluded. All their differences were ſettled, and nothing was wanting but the concurrence of their reſpective allies. The misfortunes of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, the natural conſequence of their own long negligence, ſeemed to favour the impatience of the Dutch for peace. The feeble councils of Spain, the want of reſources in the Empire, the backwardneſs of the German princes, together with the hopes which all derived from the eagerneſs of the Engliſh nation againſt their ancient enemies and rivals the French, concurred to render their efforts languid and unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive. But France itſelf was now in no condition to continue the war with advantage. Though vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious in the field, ſhe was exhauſted at home.—The immenſe expence of her armies, the profuſion of the King, her ſubſidies to England, to Sweden; and to ſome princes of Germany, had drained her coffers, and impoveriſhed her people. Lewis himſelf, though ambitious, unfit for conqueſt, ſeemed too fond of the name of victory to reap any of its benefits. With ſuch an army, with ſuch reſources, a prince of leſs vanity and more perſeverance might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended greatly his dominions, conſidering the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0709200301:227"/>
of Europe at the time. But the ſucceſſes, which which rendered him the terror of his neighbours, had already deprived him of the power of doing more harm.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Views of the King</note> The ignorance of Europe, however, continued her fears. The Engliſh nation, by their jealouſies againſt their rivals, rendered them reſpectable. France de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived more honour from the terrors of her enemies, than ever ſhe loſt to their arms. Though this panic was in parliament an engine of ambition to the facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, it was a matter of ſerious importance among the people in general. Murmurs were heard from every ſide; and Charles, hating trouble, was willing to put an end to clamours that diſturbed his repoſe. His unfortunate connections with France, the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate bigotry of his brother, the pecuniary neceſſities which had betrayed him into violent meaſures, had loſt to him his popularity, and filled the minds of his people with apprehenſions of Popery and arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry power. To gain their affections, one meaſure only remained: to give the proſpect of ſucceſſion to the throne to a Proteſtant Prince, and to put an end to the fears of the nation, by procuring a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral peace. The marriage of the Prince of Orange to his brother's eldeſt daughter ſeemed to promiſe both theſe deſirable ends; and he, therefore, embrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with eagerneſs a renewal of thoſe propoſals which had formerly been made by the Prince.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">and of the Prince of Orange.</note> The motives, which Charles derived from his views of eaſe, the Prince of Orange found in his own am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. The hopes of male iſſue, which the Duke of York entertained upon his ſecond marriage, were hitherto fruſtrated; and though the Ducheſs was then with child, and was ſoon after actually brought to bed of a ſon, the premature deaths of her former children had rendered it unlikely that any ſhe might bring forth ſhould enjoy a long life. The Lady Mary was the heir-apparent of the crown. Upon the eventual demiſe of the two royal brothers with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out iſſue-male, there was a certainty of her aſcending the throne. There was, even then, a proſpect of her being preferred to her father, on account of his avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed attachment to the Popiſh religion. The idea of
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0709200301:228"/>
excluding him from the ſucceſſion, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards carried into parliament, was already a topic of diſquiſition before the public<note n="H" place="bottom">Vid. Publications of the times.</note> Swayed by theſe reaſons, the Prince of Orange began ſeriouſly to think of a marriage, which had been in negotiation three years before. In the month of June, he diſpatched Bentick, with great profeſſions of friendſhip and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Duke of York<note n="I" place="bottom">James II. 1677.</note>, to obtain his conſent to the match. Having thus paved the way, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to come to England at the end of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, with the avowed deſign of concerting with Charles the plan of a peace for the ſecurity of Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders<note n="K" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, and to propoſe in public a marriage, which had been ſettled in private ſome time before.</p>

No obſtruction ſeems now to have been thrown in the way of an alliance, to which the Duke had agreed in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding ſummer. The King, on the twenty-fourth of October, acquainted an extraordinary council, that he had concluded the marriage between the Lady Mary and the Prince. The agreeable news being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the populace, they filled all London with feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and noiſe. On the fourth of November, the marriage was celebrated at St. James's by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of London, the King himſelf giving away the bride<note n="O" place="bottom">Kennet, 1677.</note>.

Europe had, for ſome years, conſidered him as the arbiter of her affairs; and now he hoped to give all the neceſſary weight to his deciſion, by the concurrence of his nephew. In a conference between the King, the Duke, the Prince, and the Lord-treaſurer, the terms of pacification were ſuddenly ſettled. It was agreed, that all ſhould be reſtored by France to the Empire and the Emperor that had fallen into her hands during the war. The French and Dutch were to remain in the ſame ſtate is before the rupture.

of abſolute inactivity. Twenty-five thouſand ſailors were voted for the uſe of the navy; and ſuch was the eagerneſs of the nation for a war, that the fleet was manned and the army complete in the ſpace of ſix weeks. Charles himſelf ſeemed to enter into the ſpirit of his ſubjects. Though not fond of the trouble of war, he was not averſe to its pomp; and he lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an army, as the obvious means of relieving him from his bondage to a parſimonious and, as he thought, an arrogant parliament.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Popular leaders in trigue with France.</note> The great body of the nation being bent upon a war with France to promote that meaſure was the avowed object of the popular party. This ſcheme, however, was privately obſtructed by different perſons, from various views. Men who loved their country were afraid that the King might make uſe of the army to enſlave the nation. Some oppoſed the court thro' faction, others from private ambition. The eagerneſs of ſome well-meaning men, the avarice of ſeveral, and the profligacy of a few in the oppoſition, opened a ſecret intelligence with France, through Barillon, her ambaſſador at the court of London. The allies had taught the French King to ſway the deliberations of the Engliſh parliament, by corrupting its members. Buckingham, Shafteſbury, Ruſſel and Hollis, from their averſion to Charles and his miniſters, fell into the views of Lewis. They held private conferences with his agents<note n="P" place="bottom">Mem. de Barillon, Mar. 14, N. S. 1678.</note>, when they declaimed in public againſt his power. Some deſcended to the meanneſs of ſell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their votes for money; and thoſe who received no bribes themſelves, were privy to the corruption of others. Their ſuſpicions of Charles, perhaps, juſtified their oppoſition; and men of vehement paſſions might reconcile corruption itſelf to honour, when it proved the means of defeating the views of the King againſt public freedom.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note> Men of undeviating honeſty are perhaps, of all others, the leaſt calculated for carrying forward their views in a political line. The ſtrict adherence to virtue, which is a part of their character, is more ſuitable to private life than to the tumult of public

affairs. There muſt be a kind of want of ſincerity in that addreſs which obtains the name of parts. A perſon whoſe only view is the good of the people muſt ſometimes uſe engines for accompliſhing his purpoſe, of which his own mind cannot ſtrictly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. To lead a party, one muſt overlook the ſelfiſh views of individuals, and even accommodate himſelf to paſſions and prejudices which he may perhaps ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor and deſpiſe. The man whoſe ſqueamiſh virtue revolts at the profligacy of ſome members of his party, is fit only for mourning over the ruins of his country. Such is the excuſe of thoſe who thought it was from principle they joined with France againſt the King. His own example juſtified their uſing the ſame means which HE was known to have employed. He bought votes in the houſe of commons with French money; and thoſe who oppoſed his meaſures, met him in his own way. This refined reaſoning might weigh with a Lord Ruſſel. To gratify, by any means, their own reſentment, was ſufficient for a Buckingham and a Shafteſbury.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Secret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues.</note> But notwithſtanding the public profeſſions of the leaders of oppoſition, there is reaſon to believe that their chief deſign was upon office. The new meaſures adopted by Charles, had deprived them, in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, of the ground on which they ſtood. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the Prince of Orange, the apparent vigour againſt the power of France, were calculated to gain the nation. The Earl of Danby was conſidered as the author of a change which, by being followed, might in time regain to the King and his councils that irreſiſtible popularity which he had once poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. In the month of January, the Duke of Buckingham found means to have a ſecret confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with the King<note n="Q" place="bottom">James II. 1678.</note>. He made offers, it may be ſuppoſed, of the ſervice of the faction, and that being rejected, they formed a reſolution to ruin the treaſurer. In their eagerneſs to accompliſh this point, the Lord Ruſſel and other conſiderable men of the party ſent to the Duke of York in the month of April. They acquainted him, that if he would truſt them, and join with them in what they ſhould propoſe for the good of the King and the nation, they would undertake to take off
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0709200301:236"/>
the incapacity under which he lay of being Lord High Admiral, or of exerciſing any other public of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. They promiſed, in ſhort, to do every thing to his ſatisfaction; but in return, they expected his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence and aid in ruining the Lord-treaſurer. The Duke made anſwer, that he would heartily concur with them in any meaſure for the good of the King and the nation, but that he would not fall upon the King's miniſter, without the King's conſent, unleſs he were viſibly guilty of very great miſdemeanours<note n="R" place="bottom">James II. 1678.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">of parties.</note> The reſentment of the party againſt the Lord-treaſurer, and the favour of the Duke of York for him, proceeded from the ſame cauſe. Charles, in his great affection for Monmouth, had reſolved to conſtitute him commander in chief of all his forces. His vanity induced the Duke to magnify this mark of favour into a matter of much greater importance. In a conference which he had with ſome of the lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the popular party<note n="S" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, he told them, that the King had promiſed to declare him Prince of Wales<note n="T" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Colonel Birch was ſent to the treaſurer, to induce him to perſuade Charles to this meaſure. The trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer told Birch, that he was certain the King abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſuch an untruth; and that he would never adviſe him to adopt a ſcheme at once dangerous to the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and diſhonourable to himſelf. This declaration enraged the party, while it pleaſed the Duke of York. They reſolved to ruin him<note n="U" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>; and they were bent ſo much on that purpoſe, that they ſhewed are inclination of gaining the favour of the Duke, who was Danby's great ſupport with the King.

Men who had no inclination to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs government, were offended at being made its tools, to procure money for a war which was never intended. Several who loved their country abetted the violence of the factious. On the tenth of May, an addreſs was preſented, which bore, that they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the preſent inconveniences might have been prevented, had his Majeſty accepted of the advice of his commons of the twenty-ſixth of the preceding May and the thirty-firſt of January<note n="C" place="bottom">Ibid.

The King, in a ſpeech, acquainted them, that he was reſolved either by war or peace to ſave Flanders; that in either of thoſe caſes, he thought it neceſſary to keep in readineſs the army and the navy; that he left it to his parliament to conſider of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, which were equally wanted, whether the forces were continued or diſmiſſed from the ſervice. It was reſolved by the commons to ſupport the King, if he would enter into a war with the French; otherwiſe they would conſider of providing for diſbanding the army. Charles informed them, that the French King had propoſed a ceſſation of arms, which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved would end in a general peace. The commons immediately voted, that all forces levied ſince the twenty-ninth of the preceding September ſhould be paid off and diſbanded. Six hundred thouſand pounds were granted for that purpoſe. The King aſked in vain for a fund of three hundred thouſand pounds to ſupply the deficiency in his ſtanding revenue. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, to no purpoſe, a ſupply to enable him to pay the portion of the Lady Mary to the Prince of Orange. The ill humour of the commons continued. Altercation, rather than debate, filled their houſe with noiſe and tumult.

Whilſt the eyes of the allies were turned toward the deliberations of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the French took the field in Flanders. Ghent, inveſted on the fifth of March, ſurrendered on the ninth to Mareſchal d'Humiers. Ypres, on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fifth of the ſame month, fell into the hands of Lewis. Though the commons ſeemed to be alarmed at theſe new conqueſts, no effectual meaſures were purſued for ſtopping the progreſs of France. Had the neceſſary ſupplies been granted, Charles, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his averſion to war, would have yielded to the voice of his ſubjects, and joined the allies. But the confederates, long divided in their councils, had at length begun to ſeparate their reſpective in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts. The reſources of the Dutch had failed, through the great expence of the war, and the ruin which it had brought on their commerce. They had long diſcovered an inclination toward a ſeparate peace; and they now reſolved upon that meaſure, as they ſaw no proſpect of any effectual aſſiſtance from England to proſecute the war.</p>

Inſtead of yielding to the terms offered by Charles, he formed a plan of peace, which, by placing all the barrier towns of Flanders in his hands, left that country open to his future attacks. Though the King of England was fettered by his parliament, though his diſpoſition to peace was not unknown, Lewis thought it neceſſary to gain his conſent, by tempting his avarice. In the beginning of May, a French ambaſſador made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals to Charles, which were, toward the end of that month, carried into a formal treaty<note n="F" place="bottom">Dalrymple's Append. p. 157.</note>.

this treaty a ſeparate article was annexed, the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which was to have been prior to the firſt pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſubſidy.

The conduct of the States put an end to his ſuſpence. They communicated to him their reſolution of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding a ſeparate peace, upon the terms delivered at Nimeguen by the commiſſioners of France. This change in their opinions proceeded from other cauſes as well as from the exhauſted ſtate of their finances. The eagerneſs of the Prince of Orange for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the war, his late connection with the royal line of England, the former influence of his family, and their frequent attempts on the liberties of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom they were choſen to defend, were placed in the moſt ſuſpicious light by the agents of France. The Louveſtein party, who had been cruſhed by the terrors of the vulgar, had recovered ſome of their former ſpirit, when the danger which gave birth to their fears was removed. Men who loved their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſaw with jealouſy the dangerous aſcendency which the Prince had acquired during the war; and they reſolved to take advantage of the general incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for a peace, the neceſſity, or at leaſt the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diency of which was now apparent to all. They inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated to the King of England, that they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to a peace. They ordered Van Beverning, their ambaſſador at Nimeguen, to proceed to Lewis at Ghent<note n="H" place="bottom">Hume, vol. viii.</note>; and, as a preparatory ſtep to a general peace, to conclude a truce for ſix weeks with that monarch.</p>

He even diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered an inclination to enter, at the expence of France, into an actual war in favour of Sweden<note n="P" place="bottom">Dalrymple's Append. p. 178.</note>. The firſt meaſure muſt be attributed to the neceſſities of his ſituation, the latter to a deſire of keeping in pay a conſiderable force. This fluctuation of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils alarmed the Dutch, and terrified the French. The firſt could not depend on the ſupport of Charles, nor the latter on his neutrality. The States were too weary of hoſtilities to renew them with ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain ally; and the prize obtained by France by the propoſed treaty was too great to be thrown back into the wheel. Both ſides made advances in private to ward a peace. The eleventh of Auguſt was the laſt day appointed by the treaty of the Hague for receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ultimate determination of France. In the morning of that day, the French ambaſſadors deſiſted
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0709200301:243"/>
from their reſolution of retaining the ſix towns; and, before twelve at night, a ſeparate treaty was ſigned between Lewis and the States.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Battle of St. Dennis.</note> Europe exclaimed againſt a treaty which reſtored every thing to the Dutch, whilſt it deprived their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of a part of their dominions. Thoſe who lay the whole blame on the fluctuating councils of Charles, have not diſcovered all the truth. The country-party, if that appellation may be uſed with regard to Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, were the makers of a peace, which was to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive the Prince of Orange of a part of his dangerous power. His eagerneſs for continuing the war was THEIR chief inducement to bring it to a ſpeedy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion. His friends obſtructed the treaty with all their influence. He himſelf took an unjuſtifiable ſtep to break it after it was made. The French, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Luxembourg, had held Mons for ſome time in blockade. In a daily expectation of a peace, they made no motion for puſhing their operations with vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour. The Prince, having received intelligence of the treaty being ſigned, was fired with diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and reſentment. On the fourteenth of Auguſt, he fell upon the French with the utmoſt courage. Their advantageous ſituation and the conduct of Luxembourg prevented a defeat. The lives of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands were thrown away to no purpoſe. The Prince gained no victory, and he loſt reputation by a breach of public faith. His conduct was inexcuſable upon the occaſion. A copy, or, as ſome ſay, the original treaty<note n="Q" place="bottom">James II. 1678.</note>, was in his pocket when he fought at St. Dennis. But he hoped, if ſucceſsful, to encourage his countrymen to diſavow terms, of which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf could never approve; or he wiſhed to put an end, with ſome renown, to a war, in which his ſucceſs had not been anſwerable to his aſſiduity and courage.</p>

was, with juſtice, refuſed. Diſappointed by what he deemed a breach of faith, he flew into a rage againſt the French. He diſpatched Mr. Hyde to the States, to endeavour to perſuade them to diſavow their miniſter at Nimeguen. He promiſed, if the Dutch would join him, to declare an immediate war; and to ſupport it with the utmoſt vigour, till France ſhould be reduced to terms of more advantage to Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope. He ordered troops to embark for Flanders. He haſtened his ſhips to ſea. The whole nation bore the appearance of inſtant hoſtilities. But the States were not to be moved. They approved of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of their ambaſſador, and they ratified the treaty. The Spaniards and the Empire were ſoon obliged to accept of peace, upon the terms ſettled between Lewis and Holland. The allies were highly offended at the conduct of the Dutch. His own ſubjects, as well as the confederates, blamed the fluctuating councils of Charles. The firſt ſacrificed the intereſt of their friends to their own eaſe. The latter, from being the umpire of Europe, became, through a mean love of money, ingloriouſly ſubſervient to a power whom, by a more politic conduct, he might command. But he made one falſe ſtep, which he could not recover; and having loſt his conſequence at home, he could never regain his importance abroad.</p>

Beſides, by being expended on the navy, the ſums granted by parliament reverted to the channels from which they came.

Had Charles followed the inclinations of his people, had he ſtudied his own glory, he would have weakened his kingdom with expence, before its proſperity was confirmed by the induſtry of the people.

Danby, who was then in Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire, repaired to court; but before his arrival, Bedingfield communicated the packet, which appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be forged, to the Duke, who immediately car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to the King<note n="F" place="bottom">James II. 1678.</note>.</p>

On the thirteenth of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober<note n="I" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, Otes, the chief actor in this pernicious farce, related his whole ſtory before the council. The ſum of this impoſtor's information conſiſted chiefly of the following articles: he told the board, that he had been privy, both at home and abroad, to many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations among the Jeſuits for the aſſaſſination of his Majeſty. Grove and Pickering, the one an ordained Jeſuit, the other a lay-brother of the ſame order, were firſt appointed to ſhoot the King; but after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards it was reſolved to diſpatch him with poiſon, by the means of Sir George Wakeman, the Queen's phyſician, and a papiſt. Many Jeſuits, he ſaid, in

diſguiſe, had gone to Scotland, to diſtract the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that country, by preaching ſedition in the field conventicles. He affirmed, that, in proſecution of the great deſign, he had viſited St. Omers, Paris, and even Spain, by command.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Otes's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</note> With many letters and directions, he affirmed that he himſelf had returned to England. That in a ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern behind St. Clement's church, in the Strand, he aſſiſted at a conſultation of fifty Jeſuits; and that he carried their reſolutions from room to room. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the board, that in this aſſembly it was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to diſpatch the King by the dagger, by ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or by poiſon. That when he was buſy in col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting evidence for a full diſcovery, he was ſuſpected, and was obliged to ſeparate himſelf from their meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to ſave his own life. This ſtory he related with ſuch circumſtances, that on the firſt day of his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination before the council, he gained ſome credit<note n="L" place="bottom">James II. 1678.</note>. But when he was croſs-examined, the villainy began to appear. The letters ſent to Bedingfield being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, he affirmed that he knew them to be of the hand-writing of thoſe from whom they were pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to come. But one letter, ſaid to be written by Blundel, an Engliſh Jeſuit, appeared, to the convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all preſent, to be in the ſame hand with Dr. Tong's depoſition. Beſides, the letters carried on their face the evidence of forgery. They were full of falſe ſpelling, no points, no marks of diſtinction, no air of coming from men of buſineſs. Treaſon was written in plain terms. No double meaning was uſed, nothing tending to deception or to the preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of diſcovery. It was thought impoſſible that five perſons, and thoſe at different places, and natives of different countries, could agree in the ſame ſalſe Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh, write on paper with the ſame mark, of the ſame ſize, and uſe the ſame expreſſions, the ſame affected cant.</p>

ſuch accuſed perſons as were then in London. A guard, led by the informer, was ſent in ſearch of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Jeſuits and their papers. During three days he was almoſt perpetually employed, either in appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the accuſed, or in attending the council. Sir George Wakeman was ſeized, and Coleman, late ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary to the Ducheſs of York. Langhorne, an eminent counſellor at law, was apprehended; eight Jeſuits, Whitbread, Turner, Marſhal, Ireland, Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van, Rumley, Corker, and Pickering were ſeized. Theſe were the principal perſons in England who were accuſed by Otes, in his firſt examination, of being privy to the Popiſh plot. The meaſures of the council in an inſtant alarmed the nation. The city was all in a ferment. Apprehenſion and terror flew over the whole country. Every perſon was now em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed either in hearing or telling ſtrange reports. The truth was magnified by the fears of the people. The moſt groſs inventions, the moſt improbable fic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were received as certain fact. Idle rumours co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inciding with the former jealouſies of men, were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly believed; and the whole people wore the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of public miſery and diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Coleman's letters.</note> In the midſt of this terror and ſuſpenſe, ſome col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lateral incidents ſeemed to place the truth of a plot beyond diſpute, in the eyes of a credulous people. Coleman, before his houſe was ſearched, found means to convey away his letters for the two laſt years, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with his book of entries. In his confuſion he left in a drawer ſome copies of letters, which he had written to Father la Chaiſe, the French King's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, to the Pope's nuncio at Bruſſels, to other Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics abroad. Theſe were found, examined, and publiſhed. Coleman, a man of a weak underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, was a bigot, to the laſt degree of enthuſiaſm, in the Romiſh faith. Sanguine beyond meaſure, thro' the ſury of his zeal, he inſinuated, in a kind of inco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent jargon, the great expectations which he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of the converſion of the three Britiſh kingdoms, and the total ruin of the Proteſtant religion, which this fooliſh zealot called a peſtiſent hereſy. He built his hopes on the zeal of the Duke of York, and
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:0709200301:255"/>
ſpoke in indefinite and obſcure terms of aid from abroad, to accompliſh what he denominated a glorious work. He inſinuated in other letters, that the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the French and Engliſh royal families, and thoſe of the Romiſh faith, were inſeparable. He propoſed to la Chaiſe to procure a remittance of three hundred thouſand pounds from France for the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the parliament; which meaſure would greatly forward their views. This buſy and weak enthuſiaſt ſeems to have gleaned hints of the money-negotiations then ſubſiſting between Charles and Lewis, and to have founded upon that circumſtance a romantic ſcheme, which exiſted only in his own diſtempered imagination<note n="M" place="bottom">Vid.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Godfrey's murder.</note> Though Coleman's letters bore no relation to the plot diſcovered by Otes, they ſeemed to infer, that a deſign of the ſame kind had been formerly in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Some concluded they were the beginning of a chain of correſpondence, which came down to the preſent times. They ſuppoſed that the ſubſequent letters contained a full information of a plot, as yet very imperfectly known. This incident was followed by another, which put an end to every doubt. On the ſixth of September<note n="N" place="bottom">L'Eſtrange's Caſe, &amp;c.</note>, Sir Edmondbury God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, a man of a good character, but of a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly diſpoſition, who had acted many years as a juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the peace in Weſtminſter, was prevailed upon by ſome of the popular party to ſwear Otes to the firſt narrative delivered to the King by Doctor Tong. On the twenty-eighth of the ſame month, he took again the oath of Otes to the ſame paper, with what he denominated freſh and further informations. Theſe depoſitions were preſented on the ſame day to the King and council by Tong. Godfrey, on Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the twelfth of October, ſuddenly diſappeared. No tidings were heard of him till Thurſday the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, when he was found dead in a ditch near Prim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe-hill, on the way to Hampſtead, with his ſword run through his body. No blood appeared on his clothes. His money was in his pocket, his rings on his fingers, his ſhoes were clean. His gloves and his
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0709200301:256"/>
cane lay near him on the ground. His neck, from its limberneſs and diſtortion, a circumſtance even com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in a natural death, and the appearance of ſtagnated blood all around his throat, confirmed mankind in the opinion that he was ſtrangled<note n="O" place="bottom">Trials.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the people.</note> The whole city poured round the body, which lay expoſed to public view for two whole days. Every one concluded that Godfrey was murdered by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, for taking the oath of Otes concerning a plot in which they were deemed to be all concerned. The paſſions of the populace were raiſed to a degree of madneſs, by the moving ſight of the body. The ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the better ſort were inflamed by terror, ſurmiſes, and ſuſpicions. The evidence of Otes, with all its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions and abſurdities, was implicitly ſwallowed by all degrees of people. Men, who preſumed to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon the ſubject, were hated like accomplices in the plot. The whole ran down in one torrent on the ſide of a popiſh conſpiracy. Charles, perceiving that it was dangerous, if not impoſſible to oppoſe the ſtream, added his own force to its violence. He no longer ſeemed to form a doubt on a ſubject which his pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating judgment could never permit him to believe. He iſſued a proclamation, offering a reward of five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds to any perſon who ſhould diſcover the murder; and, as it had been inſinuated that many might be kept from giving their evidence through fear, he promiſed all ſecurity to the perſons of the diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The alarm ſpread from London through the whole kingdom. The buſineſs of life was interrupted by confuſion, panic, clamour, dreadful rumours; and the unfortunate Catholics began to be afraid of the maſſacre, of the deſign of which they themſelves were accuſed<note n="P" place="bottom">Vid.

That ſect could entertain no motive of offence againſt a juſtice of the peace, for executing a duty which, from his office, he could not refuſe. Inſtead of oſſiciouſly inquiring into the matter, it is certain that he was, with much difficulty, prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0709200301:257"/>
upon to ſwear Otes. He put no interrogatories to the informer. He only received his oath upon a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten narrative, which was already no ſecret. Beſides, Godfrey was known to be on the beſt terms with the Catholics. He was intimate with Coleman. He never executed with rigour the laws againſt the ſect. The evidence given, ſoon after, of the murder, is now exploded, with the other perjuries of that diſgraceful and profligate period Thoſe who profited firſt by the plot might with more reaſon be ſuſpected of Godfrey's death; yet a charge of ſo deep a dye muſt never be admitted, without direct and poſitive evidence. A great uſe, it is certain, was made of this incident by the popular party. They carried the body, in a long and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly proceſſion, through London. They buried it with every ceremony calculated to excite pity and rouze terror. They tampered with the witneſſes, who ſwore that they were privy to the murder. But as Godfrey was of a diſconſolate ſtate of mind, his death may, with more juſtice, be aſcribed to his own melancholy, than to the wickedneſs of other men<note n="Q" place="bottom">L'Eſtrange, Contin. of Baker, et Auct. citat.

                  <note place="margin">Popiſh plot abetted by Danby.</note> THOUGH the popiſh plot was abetted by the popular party through faction, it received its chief ſupport from the arts of the miniſter, the Earl of Danby. Suſpecting the attachment of the King to his perſon, he had ceaſed to act heartily in his ſervice ever ſince the beginning of the preſent year<note n="R" place="bottom">James II. 1678.</note>. The Duke of Buckingham, to whom he partly owed his place, had added ill offices to the enmity which the proud give in return for favours too great for common gratitude. He had, in the preceding January, found means to be admitted to the King in private, with propoſals from the leaders of oppoſition, promiſing every thing for the diſgrace of the treaſurer<note n="S" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Danby, hated by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-party, and uncertain of the protection of Charles, employed all his thoughts for ſecuring himſelf. He ſeized with eagerneſs the Popiſh plot, as at once the proof of his attachment to the eſtabliſhed church, and the probable means of diverting the ſtorm, which was ready to fall on his own head. When it was propoſed in council by the Duke of York and by Lauderdale to put an end to the plot, by a thorough examination, he evaded the motion, and encouraged the King to follow his diverſions at Newmarket till the time was paſt<note n="T" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Had the improbable fictions of Otes been ſearched to the bottom before the credulity of the nation was alarmed, the ruin which fell on individuals, and the miſchiefs that threatened the people, might have been entirely prevented<note n="U" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Parliament meets.</note> But the treaſurer, having reſolved to throw the whole of that intricate buſineſs into parliament, was unwilling to remove the veil from the eyes of a credulous people. To continue the deluſion, by encouraging the profligate to perjuries, rewards were offered for oaths and evidence. Otes himſelf was lodged in the palace, where he lived at a conſiderable expence to the King. Indemnity, money, and even applauſe, were held ſorth as incite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to iniquity; and mankind were prepared, by their fears, to give credit to the moſt improbable lies. In this ſituation of affairs, the parliament met on the twenty-firſt of October. The King told them in his ſpeech, that the part which he had acted for preſerving
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0709200301:260"/>
the neighbouring powers, and ſecuring Flanders, was ſufficiently known, without enlarging on that ſubject. He excuſed his not diſbanding the army, by the effect which that meaſure had to ſupport the ſpirits of his friends, and to leſſen the demands of their enemies. He complained of the expence of the troops to his ſtanding revenue. He earneſtly demanded an imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſupply. He informed them of the popiſh plot; but he forbore to offer his opinion. He ſaid, that he left the whole to the law; that, however, he ſhould take effectual means to prevent foreigners from intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing popery. He recommended to them his own concerns. He mentioned the deficiency in the poll-bill, and the anticipations on the revenue; and he concluded with a deſire that they would conſider his neceſſities with that duty and affection which he was certain of deriving from their loyalty<note n="X" place="bottom">Journals, Oct. 21, 1678.</note>.</p>

The madneſs which had ſeized the nation raged with redoubled fury in parliament. The two houſes went inſtantly into a flame. The reſt of the King's ſpeech was in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forgotten. The plot at once engroſſed the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and awakened the fears of all. The commons voted an immediate addreſs for all papers relating to the diſcovery made by Otes<note n="Y" place="bottom">Ibid. Oct, 21, 1678.</note>. The lords ſent down a meſſage for the concurrence of the lower houſe in an addreſs for a day of faſting and humiliation. Both houſes joined in a requeſt for removing all Catholics beyond ten miles from London<note n="Z" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. On the third day of their meeting, the commons began to inquire into Godfrey's murder. They addreſſed the King to give orders to the lord-chamberlain to permit no unknown perſons to come to his preſence<note n="A" place="bottom">Ibid. Oct. 24.</note>. They ordered the ſerjeant at arms to bring Otes before them. They heard with attention an account given by Doctor Tong, relating to the firing of London, twelve years before<note n="B" place="bottom">Ibid. Oct. 26.</note>. They greedily liſtened to Otes.

He ſaw that his former narrative, wild and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible as it had been, was received with avidity; and that even the reſemblance of truth was no longer ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to gain credit to his tales. The Pope, he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, had declared England his kingdom, and had actually ſent over commiſſions to ſeveral perſons to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern his new dominions in his name. He had made, according to this impudent impoſtor, the Lord Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of Wardour, chancellor; the Earl of Powis, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer; the Lord Bellaſis, general; the Viſcount Stafford, paymaſter of the forces; Sir William Godolphin, the ambaſſador in Spain, privy-ſeal; Coleman, ſecretary of State; Sir Francis Radcliffe, a major-general; and Langhorne, advocate-general. The famous Lambert, then oppreſſed with idiotiſm in his priſon at Guernſey, was made adjutant-general to the Pope's army, in his ideal kingdom. This ridiculous diſcovery was, on the ſame day<note n="C" place="bottom">Oct. 28.</note>, ſucceeded by Coleman's letters; which, though they related in no circumſtance to the preſent plot, confirmed its certainty to the parliament. They reſolved, without one diſſenting voice, that it appeared to the conviction of both lords and commons, that there has been and ſtill is a <hi>damnable</hi> and <hi>helliſh</hi> plot, contrived and carried on by the papiſts, for murdering the King, for ſubverting the government, and for deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troying the Proteſtant religion<note n="D" place="bottom">Oct. 31.</note>."</p>

Men of the firſt rank and birth courted his company, and called themſelves his friends. He was deemed the ſaviour of the whole people, and was actually the idol of the nation. The character of informer became honourable. Perjury itſelf was attended with applauſe, as well as with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; and the public opinion, which is uſually a check upon vice, became an encouragement to iniquity, in all its forms.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Intrigues of the Prince of Orange.</note> Though the bigotted adherence of the Duke of York to the Romiſh faith was the obvious cauſe of the uncommon fears which had ſeized the nation, there were ſecret ſprings, which greatly contributed to ſet the whole machine of oppoſition in motion. The peculiar ſtate of the royal family of England had already rendered the throne an object of ambition to the Prince of Orange, whoſe whole attention ſeems, from this time forward, to have been pointed towards the crown, which his perſeverence placed, at length, on his head. The King and the Duke of York had been long the only males remaining of the houſe of Stuart. The Prince, as the ſon of their eldeſt ſiſter, had, even before he married the daughter of the Duke of York, formed ſome diſtant ſchemes for mounting the throne. As early as the year 1674, he had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, by his agents, a connection with ſome diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented members in the Engliſh parliament<note n="H" place="bottom">D'Avaux, 1679.</note>. The ill-humour which had crept into that aſſembly ſerved, from time to time, to employ his intrigues, and to encourage his hopes. The Popiſh plot threw, at length, an opportunity in his way, which enabled him to add to the ferment, in the manner beſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to forward his own views<note n="I" place="bottom">Ibid. 1678.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The King interferes.</note> The intrigues of the Prince, however, were hitherto ſo ſecret, that their effect muſt have been feeble and inſenſible. Time only could raiſe and bring to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity the ſeeds of diſſenſion, which he had partly ſown. The King was, in the mean time, alarmed at the motion againſt the Duke of York, though it had not been brought to a queſtion. He plainly perceived that it tended to a limitation of the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the crown, a meaſure which he was reſolved to oppoſe with all his power. On the eighth of November, he came to a reſolution to diſſolve the parliament; but he reflected on the ſtate of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and dropt, for the time, that meaſure<note n="K" place="bottom">James II. 1678.</note>. He ordered the houſe to attend him on the ninth of November. He thanked his parliament for their care
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0709200301:264"/>
of his perſon and government. He promiſed to join them in every reaſonable meaſure for the ſecurity of the Proteſtant religion, not only for the preſent, but even to the end of the world. He told them, that he was ready to give his aſſent to any bills to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure their ſafety in any future reign, provided ſuch bills limited not the right of ſucceſſion to the crown in the true line, and ſo as they reſtrained neither his own power, nor the juſt rights of any Proteſtant ſucceſſor, in the throne. To gain their confidence, and to convince the nation of the ſincerity of his profeſſions, he preſſed them to expedite their councils, to bring Popiſh recuſants to an effectual conviction. The majority of the commons were ſatisfied with this condeſcenſion; and the moſt violent thought it prudent to defer for the preſent their deſigns. The houſe, in a body, waited upon the King at White-hall, and gave him their thanks for his gracious ſpeech from the throne.</p>

He roſe from a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, or common runner of meſſages, into a livery ſervant, in the family of the Lord Bellaſis. To the beſeneſs of his birth he added the loweſt depravity of mind. He was by nature a knave, and followed iniquity from inclination, more than from profit.—Active in his perſon, and a wanderer from diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was a kind of poſt or letter-carrier beyond ſea; and, in that ſervile condition, he found an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to become acquainted with the names and the more obvious concerns of people of note on the continent. He converted this knowledge into the means of ſharping. He went under falſe names; he borrowed money by fraud; he forged recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he perſonated men of figure.

Jerſey and Guernfey, he ſaid, were to be ſeized by a force from Breſt. The Earl of Powis and the Lord Petre were to form an army in the county of Rad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; and the Viſcount Stafford, Coleman, and Father Ireland, were poſſeſſed of funds for defraying the charge of all theſe armaments.

This evidence was in itſelf ſo incredible, that nothing but the force of prejudice could gain for it a hearing, much leſs give it any credit.

The ſpirit exhibited by Charles, before and after the treaty of Nimeguen, was highly reſented by the French King. He was reſolved to be revenged on both the King and the miniſter.

He was heard with the utmoſt eagerneſs. A committee was diſpatched for the box in which the writings were contained. Two letters ſubſcribed by Danby were produced.

Men thought that all along he had acted in concert with the French King. They deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his profeſſions in favour of the allies a mere decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

The charge of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, though unſupported with glaring inſtances, ſeemed to be the leaſt unjuſt. Danby was poor, and he loved money; but his maſter was neither full of generoſity, nor abounding in wealth.

When the impeachment was read in the upper houſe, Danby aroſe and ſpoke to every article. He ſhewed that Mountague, the informer againſt him, had himſelf promoted with ardour the money-negotiations with France.

The friends of the treaſurer affirmed, that the utmoſt that could be ſaid in favour of the charge, was to ſuppoſe it ture; and had it even been true, the crimes alledged fell not within the ſtatute of Edward III. To this argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the popular party replied, that the commons who had exhibited the charge, were to be heard on two points; firſt on the proof, and then on the nature of the crime. They propoſed, therefore, that the charge ſhould be received; and that the houſe, according to the rules of parliament, ought to commit the accuſed perſon, and to appoint a ſhort day for his trial. The majority of the Peers, upon a diviſion, were againſt the commitment of Danby. The King found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf under the neceſſity of ſupporting the miniſter, and he uſed all his influence. The commons however in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted, that Danby ſhould be ſequeſtered from parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and committed. A violent conteſt was likely to ariſe; and Charles, perceiving no hopes of ending the diſpute by gentle means, prorogued the parliament<note n="X" place="bottom">Journals, Dec. 30.</note> on the thirtieth of December.</p>

Many aſcribed it to revenge, but ſcarce any to love of public good.—The malice of his enemies reached not the meanneſs of his real motives. They ſcarce could imagine that he was purchaſed with the money of France to expoſe her ſecret negotiations.

Wren, either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting the difference of time, or actuated by revenge, uſed that circumſtance as a ground of accuſation.—Had the time of Prance's abſence agreed with that of the murder, ſome colour of ſuſpicion might remain.

The leaders of the preſent commons were men of leſs ability, and more diſhoneſt than their predeceſſors Charles II. poſſeſſed better parts, though leſs virtue than his father. Having, by his prepoſterous and even criminal councils, raiſed the ſtorm, which threatened now to fall upon himſelf and his family, he was found to be poſſeſſed of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and, in the event, of firmneſs ſufficient to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it againſt the heads of his opponents. He gave line to their fury, till with ſtruggling they fatigued themſelves out of their ſtrength. He rendered them ſuſpected for their violence. He gained the people through the folly of his enemies and his own aſſumed moderation.

When fac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious men carried matters too far, they were deſerted by the public opinion.

The connection with France, but above all, the avowed popery of the Duke of York, rendered ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected councils which he was ſuppoſed to lead. The elections, as might have been foreſeen, were made with all the prejudices which inflamed the times. The moſt violent in the former parliament were rechoſen.

The ambition of the Duke of Monmouth was the ſource of this ſolemn certificate. Flattered by the popular party, and, from various cauſes, the favourite of the people, he had long entertained hopes of poſſeſſing the crown. Either he himſelf, or his pretended friends, had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently circulated reports, that Charles had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually married to his mother. Upon the removal of the Duke of York from the kingdom, and from the proſpect of his being excluded from the ſucceſſion to the throne, through the jealouſy of parliament, the legitimacy of Monmouth became again a principal topic of converſation. Notwithſtanding his great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection for Monmouth, Charles was highly offended at his preſumption. Monmouth, with a degree of folly ſuitable to his own circumſcribed talents, joined himſelf to the moſt violent opponents of the court.

Seymour, who had been ſpeaker in the laſt parliament, was choſen again to that office; but he was rejected by the King, when he was preſented in the uſual form. A prior quarrel with Danby was the ſource of this affront on Seymour. He had been privately in the pay of the crown, and he carried his gratitude to the court to a degree which merited and received cenſure. But the payment of the penſion ceaſed with his ſervices, and he, therefore, had herd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of late with the popular party. The commons, returning to their houſe, fell into warm debates. Meres, propoſed by the court-party, was rejected with diſdain. They agreed that the choice of their own ſpeaker was a right inherent in the commons; that the preſenting him to the King for approbation was a matter of mere form. They preſented an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs on that ſubject; but it was anſwered by a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogation. The affair was, at length compromiſed.

This was plainly a preparatory ſtep to the eventual excluſion of the Duke from the throne. Charles took the advice of his new council upon this alarming vote. He laid before them the limitations, which he communicated, on the thirtieth of April, to the two houſes. He told his parliament, that he was ready to conſent to any law that, without alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſucceſſion to the crown in the right line, ſhould limit the authority of a Popiſh ſucceſſor to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their religious and civil liberties.

They came to a reſolution, that commoners who ſhould maintain its validity ſhould be accounted betrayers of the liberties of England. They reſolved to go up in a body, and demand juſtice at the bar of the lords. Several conferences were held between the two houſes concerning the manner of his trial.

The rage of the people had not yet abated; and it would be imprudent, if not impoſſible, to ſave the innocent, by the utmoſt exertion of his authority. He left the unfortunate culprits to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of Otes and Bedloe, to the intemperate violence of a weak and even profligate chief juſtice, and the prejudices and terrors of a credulous populace. One Dugdale, who had ſerved the Lord Aſton in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Steward, appeared as a new evidence when the Jeſuits were arraigned. Carrying the appearance of a man of ſenſe and ſobriety, he acquired more credit than either Otes or Bedloe. But he was alſo an impoſtor, and his teſtimony appeared afterwards to be monſtrous and incredible. To invalidate the evidence of Otes, the priſoners proved, by ſixteen ſtudents from St. Omers, the moſt of them young men of family, that Otes was in that place at the very time he had ſworn he had been in treaſonable conſults with the Jeſuits in England. The teſtimony of Catholics had no weight, either with the court or the jury. The witneſſes were, without doors, inſulted and beat by the mob. Within, they were reviled and brow-beat by Scroggs. The priſoners, as might have been expected, were condemned. They denied to the laſt their being guilty.

Enthuſiaſm on the ſide of an ignorant populace, and violence on the part of an imprudent government, fill the whoſe circle of Scotiſh affairs. Theſe, co-operating together, produced events in the preſent year, which require a prior detail of facts to be underſtood. Lauderdale, who ſecretly affected preſbytery, relaxed a part of his ſeverity againſt the Covenanters, in the year 1677. The preſumption of the conventiclers roſe in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the indulgence of the ſtate. Preſent eaſe was loſt upon an unfortunate race of men, ſtill ſore from former injuries. Their preachers inflamed them into a kind of madneſs, in field-meetings, to which their hearers came all armed. They mixed treaſon with their other exhortations in their diſcourſes; and the epiſcopal party found means to revive thoſe impolitic ſeverities which had been juſt laid aſide. In the month of November 1677, the council came to a reſolution to ſuppreſs with an army of Highlanders the diſturbances

The lower ſort, from a ſpiritual pride, were the natural enemies of kingly government.

The

Some of their principal leaders were probably animated to inſurrection by the heads of the republican party in England. The conventicles became more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and more numerous. Their preachers, with an inſolence ſcarce pardonable, where it is not deſpiſed, exhorted their hearers to pay no land-tax, to deny the legality of acts of parliament, to oppoſe the King's au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. Every field-meeting became, in ſome degree, an army. Men came provided with weapons, and ſeemed ready to ſupport by force their opinions, in civil as well as ſpiritual affairs.

The troops quartered in the weſtern counties received orders to diſperſe by force all field meetings, wherever they ſhould be found. The fanatics came armed and in great num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to their places of worſhip. One Hamilton, and a preacher of the name of Douglas, at the head of eighty armed men, came to Rutherglen, a village two miles from Glaſcow, and publiſhed, with great ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, a declaration. They judged the twenty-ninth of May, the anniverſary of the reſtoration, the moſt proper day for their purpoſe. They made uſe of the bonfires kindled upon the occaſion, to burn the acts of parliament and thoſe of the council, which had eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed prelacy and ſuppreſſed conventicles. Graham of Claverhouſe, famous afterwards under the title of Viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count Dundee, attacked a conventicle on the thirty-firſt of May, but he was repulſed with loſs. The fanatics,

Having quaſhed the inſurrection in the ſpace of a few days, Monmouth took leave of the council on the ſixth of July, and returned to Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.

His country derived this happineſs from the prudent conduct of its chief governor, the Duke of Ormonde.

He applied himſelf immediately to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement of the revenue. He enquired minutely into all its branches. He examined into the terms of the late farm. He made a new contract. He improved the finances to three hundred thouſand pounds a year. With this ſum he maintained an army of ten thouſand men; he equpped ſome frigates to guard the coaſt; he kept the forts of the kingdom in good repair. A ſurplus of forty-four thouſand pounds a year was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for the ſupport of Tangier. In the year 1678 it was thought neceſſary to call a parliament, for lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a freſh duty upon exciſeable liquors, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm by an act the decrees of the court of claims<note n="T" place="bottom">Carte, Leland.</note>.</p>

kingdom. All officers were ordered to their reſpective ſtations. A proclamation was iſſued for diſarming the Papiſts. The commiſſioners of array were ordered to prepare the militia for the field. Notwithſtanding all theſe precautions, the Duke eſcaped not from cenſure. His life was threatened in Ireland. The enemies of his principles accuſed him in England. The Earl of Shafteſbury recommended the conſideration of Ireland to the lords. He repreſented the unguarded ſtate of Dublin. He threw reflections on Ormonde. He boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in public, that he himſelf was poſſeſſed of proofs of an Iriſh plot. While the Duke was preparing to come to London, to vindicate himſelf from theſe aſperſions, the parliament was diſſolved.

The body of the people, who had been inflamed by the Popiſh plot, were now becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more cool. The artful conduct of Charles had prevented his being involved in the public jealouſy which was kindled againſt his brother.

The vehemence with which they proſecuted the Popiſh plot had degenerated from zeal into paſſion. They ſeemed in ſome inſtances more eager to puniſh the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed than to aſcertain their guilt. The diſcerning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſuſpect, that they carried forward their own private deſigns under the ſpecious veil of public good. The attempt to exclude the Duke of York from the throne was received with a degree of jealouſy, by ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral who feared his principles and deteſted his bigotry. To break the line of ſucceſſion was eſteemed a great ſtep toward the abolition of monarchy. The benefit of making the Prince himſelf derive his right, as well as his authority, from the laws, was neither underſtood nor ſeen. Men formed their judgment of the future from the events of paſt times. Diſputed claims to the throne had involved their fathers in all the miſeries of a long civil war, and they were afraid to entail the like misfortunes upon their poſterity.</p>

He endeavoured to encourage them by his moderation, and at the ſame time with an appearance of ſpirit. Though indolent by nature, and in a great meaſure deſtitute of ambition, he was reſolved not to ſacrifice what HE deemed to be the rights of the crown, to a precarious offer of preſent eaſe. He found, that in proportion to the growth of violence on the ſide of his opponents, the number of his friends increaſed.—The Cavaliers were ready, from their principles, to give him a ſupport to which he had no title from his former gratitude. The commons, by an injudicious attack on the biſhops, threw in a great degree the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed clergy in the ſcale of the crown.

Afraid of the political principles, as well as the religious bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotry, of the Duke of York, they had taken advantage of the preſent current againſt Popery to exclude him from the ſucceſſion. They foreſaw that no limitations impoſed by a predeceſſor would be ſufficient to defeat the influence which the lineal heir ſhould acquire upon his aſcending the throne. They feared every thing to themſelves from the Duke's reſentment. The ſtern obſtinacy of his character raiſed their terrors for their country. They had advanced too far not to go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill. They were determined to proceed in an avowed and vigorous oppoſition. They even hoped to gain the royaliſts to their opinion, through their zeal againſt Popery. They expected at length to obtain, from the indolence of the King, his conſent to a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary breach on the ſucceſſion. Beſides, the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of the thing appeared to them as obvious, as that the meaſure was well timed. A Prince who ſhould owe his crown to the ſuffrages of the people would be naturally more careful not to encroach on their freedom, than one who derived his whole right from his anceſtors.</p>

He found his brother almoſt reſtored to health, by the uſe of Jeſuits bark. Charles received him with every mark of affection. He however told him, that neither the ſituation of his affairs, nor the inclinations of the miniſtry, rendered it proper for him to remain in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.

at his attachment to thoſe who oppoſed his meaſures. He commanded Monmouth into his preſence. He ſtript him of the office of general.

He told the King, that as he was not thought worthy of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding the army, he would no longer remain captain of the guards. He, however, came next morning with more ſubmiſſion. He declared himſelf ready to obey in every thing the King; and he actually ſet out that very evening<note n="Y" place="bottom">James II. 1679.</note> from London.

Some frigates were ordered to carry himſelf and his family to Scotland. Upon his arrival in the Downs, he returned to London. The ſeaſon of the year was improper for a voyage by ſea. The Ducheſs was ſo ill that ſhe vomited blood. His two daughters were indiſpoſed. A week after his arrival at London, he began his journey northward.

He held a private meeting with Montague, and other diſaffected perſons, on the evening of his departure. His very words were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the King. He informed his friends, that the cauſe of his diſgrace was his adviſing Charles to make up matters with parliament; and, above all, his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing firm to the Proteſtant religion, the doctrines of which, he affirmed, were by no means favoured by the King. Many of his friends, ſeveral of the nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, even the Ducheſs of Monmouth, ſolicited the King in his favour in vain. He peremptorily ordered him to be gone.

was very coldly received in public by the Prince and Princeſs of Orange<note n="I" place="bottom">D'Avaux, 1679.</note>. He, however, obtained a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate conference with the former, and had the addreſs to reconcile him, in appearance, to his views. He informed the Prince, that the King had ſent him from England, not from any diſlike to his conduct, but to form a pretence for removing the Duke of York from the kingdom. He aſſured him, that he never had ſet up any pretenſions to the crown; and that his only object was the ſafety of his own perſon, and the intereſts of the Proteſtant religion. The Prince told him, that unleſs he relinquiſhed all ſchemes of ambition, and every deſign on the throne, he himſelf muſt not only not be his friend, but oppoſe him with all his influence and power. Monmouth agreed to the propoſals of the Prince with the moſt ſolemn promiſes and aſſurances; and they entered into mutual engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to aid one another in their reſpective ſchemes<note n="K" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Such were the beginnings of a connection which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards actually brought Monmouth to the block, and paved the way to the throne for the Prince of Orange.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The King's firmneſs.</note> Though the Duke of York laid it down as a maxim in his politics, never to gain an avowed enemy, there is no reaſon to aſcribe to his councils the new and more ſpirited conduct of Charles. Pliant in his character, and immoderately fond of eaſe, he had, during near twenty years of his reign, changed his meaſures and his ſervants, when the opinions of the nation ſeemed to change. He had hitherto derived nothing but mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune from this accommodating principle. He marked his councils with an appearance of unſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, in the eyes of the people. He encouraged ſome of his enemies, by his ſuppoſed timidity of mind. The Earl of Shafteſbury had, at two different times, when in the higheſt offices of the ſtate, herded with thoſe who oppoſed the meaſures which he himſelf ought to guide. The conduct of that lord, upon the firſt diſgrace of Monmouth, convinced Charles, that no benefit could reſult from his continuance in office. He knew that both he and his party hoped every thing
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0709200301:305"/>
from parliament. He, therefore, aſſumed at once that firmneſs of conduct which he followed during the reſt of his reign. He told his council, on the fifteenth of October, that he was reſolved to prorogue his parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for a whole year; and, that very evening, he diſmiſſed Shafteſbury from the office of preſident. No meaſure, in his ſituation, could be more prudent. He ſaw a party riſing gradually in his favour through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the nation; and he ſecured their attachment, by ſhewing that he himſelf could be firm.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Dangerfield.</note> The encouragement given by parliament, and the public credulity, had rendered the office of informer profitable, and in ſome degree, honourable, in the eyes of profligate men. One Dangerfield, whoſe wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs had juſt reached the border of every capital fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, now aſpired to the prize which Otes and Bedloe had obtained. This infamous perſon had been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported for larceny, pilloried for perjury, fined for frauds, and outlawed for flying from juſtice. To ſum up his character, he had been the boſom-friend of Bedloe, and his companion upon the high-way. When he could not obtain the money of others, he paſſed fictitious coin of his own. He was, in ſhort, guilty of every baſe enormity; and as hardened by habit againſt puniſhment, as he was inſenſible of ſhame. His total want of veracity was his moſt harmleſs vice; for his exceſſive impudence and folly deprived of all credit his lies. Being handſome in his perſon, he was harboured by one Mrs. Cellier, a Roman-Catholic midwife; a woman of vivacity, and of an ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able paſſion for men. Having formed the outlines of a pretended plot by the Preſbyterians againſt the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, he was introduced by Cellier to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs of Powis, who, by the means of the Earl of Peterborrow, procured for him acceſs to the Duke of York, and then to the King<note n="L" place="bottom">Ralph, Burnet.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">The Meal-tub plot.</note> The improbability of Dangerfield's tale, his clumſy artifice of concealing ill-forged papers, in order to be found, his profligate character, and his being ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an officer of juſtice for counterfeiting the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent coin, threw a total diſcredit on his information.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0709200301:306"/>
No warrant could legally be iſſued on his evidence. He was left to the law, and confined to Newgate. To extricate himſelf from his perilous ſituation, he became the author of a new Popiſh plot, as ſuiting beſt with the prejudices and credulity of the people. He wrote a circumſtantial narrative of his being tempted by the Earl of Caſtlemaine, the Lady Powis, and ſome other Catholics, to aſſaſſinate the King, and to murder the Earl of Shafteſbury. He even accuſed Mrs. Cellier, his patroneſs and boſom-friend; and, from the place where ſome papers were found in her lodgings, this fictitious conſpiracy was denominated Meal-tub Plot. This change in Dangerfield's evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was abetted by Shafteſbury, and it alarmed, in ſome degree, the timid and credulous part of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Charles, however, taught by the bad conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of the former plot, reſolved to nip this in the bud. He took advantage of the legal invalidity of Dangerfield's evidence, as a perſon that had been pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loried. All inquiry was ſtopt; and this plot vaniſhed, together with the fears of the nation<note n="M" place="bottom">Burnet, Ralph, James II. &amp;c.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Remarkable burning of a pope.</note> The popular party, during the interval of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, endeavoured to continue the ferment among the people till the next ſeſſion. Shafteſbury, with all his fertile invention, laboured to accompliſh a point ſo neceſſary to his deſigns. At the head of a ſociety of deſperate and profligate perſons, called the Green-ribbon Club, he projected a public ſhew, to impreſs the minds of the populace with horror and fear for the Popiſh plot. On the ſeventeenth of November, the anniverſary of Queen Elizabeth's coronation-day, it had been uſual in the city of London to burn a pope, with his inſeparable companion the devil. This ceremony was performed in the preſent year with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common ſolemnity and expence. In the front of a long proceſſion, the principal figure was a dead body car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on horſe-back before a Jeſuit, repreſenting that of Godfrey, as he was ſuppoſed to be conveyed by the aſſaſſins to Primroſe-hill. Before the body walked a bellman, crying out with a loud but melancholy voice, <q rend="inline">"Remember Juſtice Godfrey."</q> In a vaſt

                  <note place="margin">Intrigues of the Prince of Orange.</note> But the impreſſion made upon an ignorant populace by this ſight, was not worth its expence to Shafteſbury and the Green-ribbon Club. Sober men, who loved their country, were perſuaded that it could not be ſerved by ſuch paltry means. Though they enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſome apprehenſions of the preſent government, they were averſe from exchanging it for the anarchy of a mob. They perceived that reſentment, more than the love of public liberty, actuated the moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement of the public leaders. Their violence threw a total diſcredit on their profeſſions. Indignation againſt their conduct attached many to the crown; and, fortunately for Charles, ſeveral perſons, who liked not his meaſures, thought it their own intereſt to ſupport his authority. Shafteſbury, however, was not diſcouraged. He held a ſecret correſpondence with the Prince of Orange, whom he flattered with the hopes of an almoſt immediate poſſeſſion of the throne. In concert with that able, intriguing, and ambitious Prince, he formed a project, in conjunction with nine other peers, to petition<note n="O" place="bottom">D'Avaux, 1679.</note> the King to permit the parliament, which had been prorogued to the twenty-ſixth of January, to ſit at the time appointed. The ſcheme was to throw Charles into the hands of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament; and eventually to deprive him of his throne. Thus far the views of the Prince and of Shafteſbury were one. But while the firſt wiſhed to transfer the crown to his own head, the latter looked forward to a republic, in which he himſelf might exerciſe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited authority, under the ſpecious name of public freedom. Petitions of the ſame import with that of Shafteſbury and his aſſociates were encouraged throughout the kingdom. Some were prepared, and others preſented. Charles affected to receive them with a mixture of indignation and contempt. He publiſhed a proclamation againſt theſe tumultuous,
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0709200301:308"/>
and, as he called them, unlawful proceedings. He commanded the lord-mayor of London to ſuppreſs ſuch petitions as were formed in that city, and to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh as vagrants the perſons who went about to ſolicit ſubſcriptions<note n="P" place="bottom">James II. Proclamation, &amp;c.</note>. The Prince of Orange was not, however, of a diſpoſition to be terrified from his ſchemes by partial diſappointments. He continued to make a tool of Monmouth and his party<note n="Q" place="bottom">D'Avaux, 1679.</note>. He was at the bottom of all the diſturbances in England<note n="R" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, while he affected to be on the beſt terms with the King. To proſecute with more advantage his ſchemes, he propoſed to Charles to come to England, under a pretence of mediating between that Prince and the popular party. The King, perhaps ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his deſigns, thanked him without accepting his offer<note n="S" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Eſſex reſigns</note> Some reſignations in the principal departments of the ſtate had encouraged the popular party in their meaſures to haraſs the crown. The Earl of Eſſex, under pretence of the Duke of York's breach of promiſe to follow his advice, quitted the office of firſt commiſſioner of the treaſury, on the nineteenth of November. The Earl of Halifax, feigning indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, retired from the council; and Sir William Temple, though he had entered into the views of the Prince of Orange<note n="T" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, had long preferred the quiet pleaſures of the country to the tumult and hurry of public affairs. The new council, from whom the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had expected ſo much, had been for ſome time virtually diſſolved. Charles took his moſt important reſolutions without aſking their advice, or he confined his communications to two or three of their number. The factions which prevailed in the nation had ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the council. Shafteſbury, followed by Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, avowedly abetted the popular cauſe. Eſſex, Halifax, and Sunderland, adhered to the intereſts of the crown. The places of the two firſt were ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the confidence of the King, by men of better parts, though not of ſuch ſplendid name. Lawrence Hyde, the ſecond ſon of the famous Earl of Claren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,

became, by the reſignation of Eſſex, firſt in the commiſſion for executing the office of lord trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer; and Sidney Godolphin, though not admitted a member of the council till the fourth of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing February, had been, ſince the fall of Danby, a principal adviſer in the ſecret affairs of ſtate<note n="U" place="bottom">James II.</note>.</p>

He ſuſpected the patriotiſm of Shafteſbury. He loved freedom, but deteſted confuſion. Beſides, the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate rage of Shafteſbury had fixed on Eſſex a part of the blame of diſappointing the bill of excluſion, by a prorogation. His threats upon that head had been conveyed to Eſſex; and ſome aſcribe to his ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror the advice which he gave to the King, when ſick, to recall the Duke of York. To avoid the ſuſpicion of his joining with Shafteſbury, he continued, after his reſignation as firſt commiſſioner of the treaſury, a member of the council<note n="X" place="bottom">Public Intell. Nov. 17, 1679.</note>; but he ſeldom attended, and he never was truſted with the ſecret of affairs. Petitions were, in the mean time, promoted with great aſſiduity and eagerneſs.

Theſe were the Lord Ruſſel, Sir Henry Capel, and Mr. Powle. The King, contrary to his uſual good-humour, granted their requeſt with peeviſhneſs and ſymptoms of contempt. He ſeemed henceforward to have changed, in ſome degree, his character. Soured by oppoſition, and rouſed, by the preſſure of danger, from his indolence, he became ſullen and untractable. The facility of his temper was ſucceeded by obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy; and a line of reſolution paſſed through all his conduct, in a degree that ſurpriſed thoſe who affected to know him the beſt.

He, in the mean time, urged the popular party to offer petitions, to rouſe, by the buſtle and confuſion of oppoſition, the terrors of the people for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and their indignation againſt the King. But when he pretended to rely entirely on the leaders of the faction without, he extended, with much addreſs, his intrigues to the members of the cabinet.

The adherents of the King, in their addreſſes, expreſſed their abhorrence of the ſeditious manner in which the petitions were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; and their opponents gave them, from this circumſtance, the name of ABHORRERS. The latter thought the appellation of PETITIONERS a ſufficient retaliation on their enemies. Though theſe epithets ſunk ſoon after into oblivion, this year began the names of WHIG and TORY, which have invariably diſtinguiſhed the two political parties that have ever ſince divided between them the nation. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that theſe ridiculous appellations derived their origin from Scotland and Ireland. The fanatical con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venticlers of the firſt kingdom had been diſtinguiſhed by the name of Whigs, and the Popiſh rabble of the latter country were called Tories. The court-party found a ſimilitude between the Petitioners and the Scotiſh Covenanters; and the oppoſers of the crown compared the principles of the Abhorrers to thoſe of the wild Iriſh.</p>

Shafteſbury, with his uſual activity, flew through his party, and animated them with an ardour equal to his own. He had gone already too far ever to be forgiven; and he was reſolved to haraſs, if he could not ſubdue. Gained by his arts, or fired by his zeal, ſome men of patriotic principles joined him, with more vehemence than prudence. In the month of March, ſix lords, Shaſteſbury, Huntingdon, Gray, Cavendiſh, Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, Ruſſel, and nine gentlemen, delivered to the grand Jury at Weſtminſter an information againſt the Duke of York, for being a Popiſh recuſant.

The foreman having delivered the petition, the chief juſtice order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be read. The court aſked them, whether they had all their preſentments ready?

He was every where conſidered as a candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date for the crown; and men were flattered by his ſeeming to ſolicit it thro' their favour. His claims to legitimacy were again revived. A report was propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, that the King had been married, or at leaſt contracted to his mother; and that Coſens, late Biſhop of Durham, had placed a writing, contained in a certain BLACK BOX, in the hands of Sir Gilbert Gerrard, which proved the fact to the ſatisfaction of many perſons of diſtinction and name.

When the election came on, the livery rejected the perſons nominated by the Lord Mayor He adjourned the common hall, and made a ſecond nomination on the fifteenth of July. The livery continued obſtinate. A poll, for the firſt time, was demanded. The city was all in a ferment. After a conteſt of five weeks, the popular party prevailed.

He, upon the whole, deſired that they would declare her a common nuiſance. The accuſation of the Ducheſs was only calculated to gain her to the party through the channel of her fears.

With every art he added fuel to the flame which raged in the kingdom. He hoped, that at length an opportunity might offer, to juſtify an open avowal of his deſigns. Judging of the nation in general by the noiſe of particular men, he ſtill looked forward to an inſurrection; and he formed hopes, that ſhould his ſervice be either accepted by the inſurgents, or by the King, he could become with eaſe maſter of the kingdom. But the negotiations of the Prince were not confined to Van Lewen.

The parliament was in the mean time prorogued from time to time. But the King thought it prudent to acquaint the Lord Mayor of London and the judges, that he was determined to meet it in the month of November<note n="T" place="bottom">James II.</note>. The judges, on their different circuits, carried this intelligence to the people; which put an end to petitions that were no longer thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. Every art was uſed, in the mean time, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile the minds of the nation to the meaſures of government. The King affected the greateſt zeal againſt popery. The laws were executed with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, if not with great rigour, againſt popiſh recuſants. Charles endeavoured to acquire popularity to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct in foreign affairs. Though he had made in the preceding year advances to France, he had broken off the treaty upon a ſlight pretence. He formed an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liance with Spain. He offered to enter into a ſtrict connection with Holland. The Dutch, either terrified by the power of France, or ſwayed by the Prince of Orange, who began to derive hopes of gratifying his own ambition through the troubles in England, declined

his offers. They even, with ſome degree of preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as their conduct was termed by the King, inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with the domeſtic affairs of the kingdom. They ſolicited Charles to call his parliament. Their ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador openly abetted the popular party; a circumſtance which confirmed him in the reſolution of not yielding to their requeſt<note n="U" place="bottom">Kennet Burnet.

The parliament had been prorogued on the twenty-third of Auguſt, to the twenty-firſt of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober; and he reſolved to permit it to enter on that day on buſineſs. To prepare for its meeting, he thought it prudent to command his brother to retire. On the ninth of October, Hyde informed the Duke, that the Earl of Sunderland and Mr. Godolphin judged it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that he ſhould retire abroad. Eſſex and Halifax, who had in ſome degree returned to favour, joined in the ſame opinion. The Ducheſs of Portſmouth was employed by the latter nobleman to perſuade the King into the meaſure. An incident, which happened ſome months before, rendered her a zealous inſtrument againſt the intereſts of the Duke of York. Charles had been attacked in the preceding May by ſome ſlight fits of an ague; and ſhe, upon that occaſion inſiſted with the Duke to give her aſſurances of an ample proviſion in caſe of the King's demiſe. The Duke waved her importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities, by repreſenting to her the indecency of his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into engagements upon his brother's life. She was highly offended at his refuſal. She came from Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor to London. She opened a correſpondence with Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth and Shafteſbury, through the means of the Lord Howard of Eſcric; and ſoon after, when ſhe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a common nuiſance, before the grand Jury, ſhe avowedly joined the popular party, and promoted their meaſures<note n="Y" place="bottom">James II. 1680.</note>.</p>

He began to conſider his own intereſt as inſeparably connected with that of the Duke of York; and he deemed his expulſion as perhaps a prelude to his own. He knew that the fears entertained of his ſucceſſor were a good ſecurity to his own ſafety. He however ſignified to his brother, that his affairs required his abſence; and he adviſed him to repair to Scotland, where he had been treated with ſo much diſtinction and reſpect before. Some of the Duke's friends in council pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that a pardon for him ſhould paſs the great ſeal, as Shafteſbury threatened an impeachment. Charles gave his opinion, that the commons would proceed by bill, and not by impeachment. He was averſe to a prior pardon, as irregular; at the ſame time aſſuring the Duke, that in caſe of their proceeding to extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he would diſſolve the parliament. He wrote to his council in Scotland, that he had ordered his brother to repair thither, to look after the affairs of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. The Duke of York accordingly left London on the twentieth of October. Relying on his brother's aſſurances, he embarked in the river with his family, the King himſelf accompanying him as far as Leigh<note n="Z" place="bottom">James II. 1680.</note>.</p>

He appealed to the world, that the conſequences reſulting from diviſion had not proceeded from his conduct.

                  <note place="margin">Violence of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> This ſpeech was more calculated to gain the nation than to mollify the ſentiments of parliament. The people were manifeſtly divided in their opinions; but the majority of their repreſentatives had already pledged themſelves in the great queſtions which had been agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated againſt the court. The commons diſplayed all the violence of their predeceſſors in proſecuting the popiſh plot. They addreſſed the King for a pardon to all ſuch perſons as ſhould within four months give any evidence of any treaſon or conſpiracy againſt his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's perſon and government<note n="B" place="bottom">Journals, Oct. 25.</note>.

Dangerfield, the infamous author of the meal-tub-plot, was examined with care, and treated with diſtinction. They began to animadvert upon ſuch perſons as had promoted the late addreſſes. They voted, that it was the undoubted right of the ſubjects of England to petition the King for the ſitting of parliament and the redreſſing of grievances. They reſolved, that to traduce ſuch petitioning is to betray the liberty of the people, to contribute to ſubvert the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient conſtitution, and to introduce arbitrary power.

But he at the ſame time continued his connection with the popular party, and fomented the ferment in the kingdom. The Prince confined not his ſecret negotiations to Britain. He formed a ſcheme of ſtrengthening himſelf independent of the States, for an eventual expedition into England. He endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to render the family of Brunſwick-Lunenburgh dependent on himſelf, by propoſing a marriage between the Biſhop of Oſnaburgh<note n="G" place="bottom">Geo.

He propoſed to name that prince his ſucceſſor in all his own honours and preferments; and as he had no expectations of iſſue himſelf; he hoped to flatter the houſe of Lunenburgh into his views, from a near proſpect of the crown of England<note n="H" place="bottom">D'Avaux, Nov. 1680.</note>. A ſettled averſion to the Prince of Naſſau-Friezeland, his neareſt male-heir, had perhaps rendered the Prince of Orange at the time ſincere in his offers to the family of Lunenburgh, at leaſt with regard to the eventual ſucceſſion of his offices in Holland.</p>

The Prince had not the good fortune to be deemed ſincere in his profeſſions in favour of the popular party<note n="K" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. They formed their judgment of his conduct as the nephew of the King, and the ſon-in-law of the Duke of York; and they imagined, notwithſtanding the bold aſſertions of his agents, that he himſelf was actually in the intereſt of the court of England.

But when he was in a manner de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the enemies of government, his views were favoured by a part of the miniſtry. Sunderland<note n="M" place="bottom">D'Avaux, 1680.</note> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him every thing, from the certainty of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Duke of York. Though the Prince ſound his ſecret friends too ſanguine, he purſued his own deſigns. He wrote to the King to agree upon any

terms with his parliament, even though they ſhould diveſt the crown of all its prerogatives; and this he did with the greater certainty of ſucceſs, as he was aſſured by Sidney, that Charles would be forced to agree to the excluſion, and a penſion for the Duke of York<note n="N" place="bottom">D'Avaux, 1680.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Bill of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion.</note> The commons, in their zeal for the Popiſh plot, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverted ſeverely upon thoſe who preſumed to give it no credit. Sir Robert Canne was expelled for declaring that there was no popiſh conſpiracy. Doctor Tong was recommended to the King for preferment<note n="O" place="bottom">Oct. 30.</note>, as being the firſt who gave evidence of the plot. One Franciſco Ferria, together with a new witneſs whoſe name was Dugdale, and the noted Prance, were exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined<note n="P" place="bottom">Nov. 1.</note>, and their evidence committed to writing. On the ſecond of November, they renewed a vote of the former houſe, in laying the whole blame of the Popiſh plot on the religion of the Duke of York<note n="Q" place="bottom">Nov. 2.</note>. All theſe reſolutions were only preparatory ſteps toward the excluſion, the favourite object of the popular party. Notwithſtanding the vehemence of the commons, the bill ſeemed to languiſh in paſſing through the houſe. But though ſeveral members diſtinguiſhed themſelves in favour of the Duke of York, the ſlow progreſs of the bill proceeded more from an artifice of the popular party, than from the arguments of the adherents of the crown. The common-council of London, led by Shafteſbury, endeavoured, by an addreſs, to prepare the lords in its favour. On the eleventh of November, the bill of excluſion was paſſed by the commons, and carried by the Lord Ruſſel to the peers. A great body of the members, who attended Ruſſel, ſhouted by way of triumph when the bill was received<note n="R" place="bottom">James II. 1680.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Rejected by the lords.</note> The lords, however, ſeemed not to be guided by the ſame ſpirit which animated the commons. It even became a queſtion, whether the bill ſhould be at all committed; and this inſtance of reſpect to the lower houſe was only carried by two votes. When the matter came to a debate, ſeveral lords diſtinguiſhed themſelves on both ſides. Shafteſbury ſeemed to be unanſwerable in his arguments for the bill, till the Earl of Haliſax oppoſed him on the part of the Duke. He
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0709200301:323"/>
bore the whole weight of the argument. He anſwered Shafteſbury, Eſſex, and Sunderland. He ſpoke at leaſt ſixteen times<note n="S" place="bottom">James II. 1680.</note>. Having prepared himſelf for the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, the court-party left the whole debate to his abilities. When the houſe divided, the bill was rejected by a great majority. Fourteen biſhops, of ſeventeen that were preſent, were obſerved to have voted againſt the excluſion. Halifax, to convince the world that his conduct proceeded from no partiality for the Duke, moved, the next day, for a bill to baniſh him for ever from the King's preſence. Shafteſbury and his party turned the motion into ridicule; the friends of the Duke were ſilent, and the affair was dropt. Shafteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, in the courſe of the debate, obſerved, that ſince they were determined not to exclude the Duke, he ſaw no means of ſafety for the nation, but by the King's divorcing the Queen, and marrying a Proteſtant wife. The Earls of Saliſbury and Eſſex, together with the Lord Howard of Eſcric, ſeconded this motion. Halifax and others oppoſed it; and the whole fell, without ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, to the ground. The Duke of Monmouth excuſed his voting for the excluſion by his concern for the King's life, which, he affirmed, the Duke of York deſigned to take away. Halifax was ſevere upon this imprudent ſpeech<note n="T" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Halifax's expedient.</note> The bill propoſed by Halifax, though it preſerved the ſucceſſion, annihilated the power of the crown. The Duke of York was to have been baniſhed, during the King's life, five hundred miles from England. He was to forfeit his revenue, if he came nearer; and his life, if he returned to any part of his Majeſty's do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions. In this clauſe, the independence of Scotland, which kingdom had certainly a right, if ſhe choſe, to entertain the heir of her crown, was either neglected or forgotten, through the vivacity of Halifax. Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould receive the Duke, either in England or Ireland, was to be declared guilty of treaſon, even after his acceſſion to the nominal poſſeſſion of the throne. The whole government was to have been veſted in a council of forty-one members. All foreign treaties and negotiations were to be concluded or tranſacted by commiſſioners choſen out of their own number by the

council. Ireland was to be governed by the ſame council. They were to fill up vacancies in offices, and to remove perſons at pleaſure from their employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This part of their power was ſubjected to the control and diſallowance of parliament, which, when ſitting, was to exerciſe all the authority veſted in the council, during the interval of ſeſſions. It is difficult to ſay why Shafteſbury rejected an expedient which ſeemed to anſwer all his own views. Sidney, and other men of republican principles, juſtly termed the propoſed bill <q rend="inline">"a gentle way of dropping the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment into a commonwealth<note n="U" place="bottom">James II. 1680.</note>."</q>

This meaſure was deemed imprudent in the houſe, and unconſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional in itſelf. It was animadverting upon the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of debate, without which public aſſembles meet in vain. They ſeemed themſelves to be ſenſible of their error, though their paſſions overcame, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, their reaſon. The cauſe which they aſſigned for their addreſs was Halifax's adviſing the late frequent prorogations of parliament. Though no friend of the Duke, he had certainly taken an active part againſt the bill, before it was ſent up to the lords. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a meſſage to the commons, to deſtroy a report propagated by the popular party, that the King had conſented to the bill. To this circumſtance the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of the excluſion were no ſtrangers. Beſides Halifax had always affected to adopt their principles; and they perſecuted him with virulence, as a betrayer of his political friends. Charles, in anſwer to their addreſs, acquainted the houſe, that he found no ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient ground to induce him to remove Halifax either from his councils or preſence; but he promiſed to protect none of his ſervants in the commiſſion of any real crime<note n="Y" place="bottom">Nov. 26.</note>.</p>

If ſome men were intitled to complain of grievances, others had an equal claim to the privilege of approving of the meaſures of the crown. But rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon had long ſince yielded to paſſion. Parties were inflamed againſt one another to a degree that preclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forgiveneſs. Beſides, the moſt active among the Abhorrers were as unprincipled as the worſt of the country party. Jefferys, the recorder of London, began even then to diſplay thoſe vehement qualities which rendered him afterwards odious. The houſe voted, that by traducing and obſtructing petitioning, he betrayed the rights of the ſubject<note n="Z" place="bottom">Nov. 13.</note>; and they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the King to remove him from the office of chief juſtice of Cheſter, which he then enjoyed<note n="A" place="bottom">Nov. 19.</note>.</p>

Scroggs, chief juſtice of the King's Bench, had, in an irregular manner, diſmiſſed the grand jury, who had prepared a preſentment againſt the Duke of York, as a Popiſh recuſant. As a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratory ſtep to his impeachment, they voted, that the diſcharging of a grand jury before the end of the term was arbitrary, illegal, and ſubverſive of public juſtice; a manifeſt violation of the oath of a judge, and ruinous to the laws of the kingdom<note n="B" place="bottom">Nov. 23.</note>. They reſolved, that the court of King's Bench favoured Papiſts, and perſons popiſhly inclined; and, upon theſe grounds, they voted, without, one diſſenting voice, that Scroggs ſhould be impeached<note n="C" place="bottom">Dec. 23.</note>. Their rigour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from the court of King's Bench to that of the Common Pleas. Sir Francis North, who preſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on that bench with reputation, fell under the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure of the popular party, for being concerned in framing the proclamation againſt petitioning<note n="D" place="bottom">Nov. 14.</note>. That paper, however, was ſo cautiouſly worded, that ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient grounds were not found for proſecuting the chief juſtice with effect. The commons proceeded in their perſecutions of all thoſe who were deemed the moſt intimate friends of the Duke of York<note n="E" place="bottom">James II. 1680.</note>. They
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0709200301:326"/>
impeached Seymore for a pretended miſapplication of a ſupply for the navy. They expelled Sir Robert Pey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton for correſponding with the Duke of York. Pey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton ſuffered for his apoſtacy from the party, more than for the alledged crime.

Their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment with regard to the bill of excluſion carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their reſentment into acts of abſurdity, puerility, and injuſtice. On the tenth of November, they had reſolved to proceed againſt the lords in the Tower<note n="G" place="bottom">Nov. 10.</note>, and to begin with the Viſcount Stafford; but he was not brought to his trial till the thirtieth of the ſame month. Their firſt deſign was to begin with the Lord Arundel of Wardour; but the evidence againſt him was not ſufficiently full. The age, the limited ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, the natural timidity of Stafford, rendered him an eaſy victim to a violent party, who were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be ſatisfied with nothing but blood. The Earl of Nottingham, as Lord High Steward, preſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Stafford's trial. This nobleman, to abilities in his profeſſion, joined a credulity, which proved fatal to the unfortunate criminal. His charge to the peers contained expreſſions of his thorough conviction of the reality of the Popiſh plot; a circumſtance which great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthened the teſtimony of very exceptionable witneſſes.</p>

A committee of the commons, conſiſting of the moſt able members, were appointed to manage the impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Otes, Dugdale and a new evidence, one Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berville, were the witneſſes. Otes ſwore that he had ſeen ſeveral letters, ſigned Stafford, to the Jeſuits, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing his aſſiduity and zeal in promoting the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh plot. He gave in evidence, that, in his own preſence, his Lordſhip had received a commiſſion to be paymaſter-general of the Pope's army in England. He affirmed, that Stafford was privy to a deſign on

the King's life, and that he was the perſon who urged Grove to the commiſſion of the aſſaſſination.

The innocence of Stafford was ſupported by none of thoſe talents which were conſpicuous in his opponents. Though he ſtood on the beſt ground, he made but a ſeeble defence<note n="K" place="bottom">James II.</note>. He, however, invalidated ſome particulars, and threw diſcredit on others. He proved his being at Bath and its neighbourhood on the very day which Dug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dale ſwore he was employed in a great conſult of Papiſts in Staffordſhire. He made it apparent, by good wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that ſo far from employing Turberville, he had never ſeen him; and he inſiſted upon the profligate manners and former perjuries of Otes, as ſufficient reaſons to deprive of all faith his preſent evidence. His efforts, however, were all in vain. The populace were outrageous, his proſecutors violent, and his judges either prejudiced or timid. He was found guilty by a great majority<note n="L" place="bottom">55 againſt 31.</note>; and, on the ſeventeenth of Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, he received ſentence to be hanged and quartered, with the other circumſtances of ſeverity which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the puniſhment of treaſon.</p>

                  <note place="margin">and</note> The peers interceded with the King to remit the more ignominious part of the ſentence of Stafford; and that circumſtance furniſhed a freſh opportunity of malice to his enemies. The popular ſheriffs, Bethel and Corniſh, preſented a petition to the commons,
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0709200301:328"/>
expreſſing a doubt whether the King was legally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with power to alter the ſentence. This beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour was as deſtitute of prudence as it was void of humanity. Should the power of the crown to change the manner of execution be diſputed, the King in defence of his prerogative, might be induced to ſave the criminal's life. The leaders of the party in the houſe poſſeſſed more wiſdom. They procured a vote, in anſwer to the ſheriffs, that the commons were CONTENT <q rend="inline">"that the late Viſcourt Stafford ſhould be executed by ſevering his head from his body only."</q> Many efforts were in the mean time made to induce the unfortunate priſoner to confeſs the treaſon for which he was condemned. Reports of his having actually confeſſed were propagated by the popular par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. He was brought before the peers. He acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that he had been concerned in ſome ſchemes for obtaining, in a legal way, a mitigation of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal laws againſt Catholics; and that he knew of no other treaſon<note n="M" place="bottom">Publ. of the Times.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">executed.</note> To add to the misfortunes of Stafford, his neareſt relations were among his greateſt enemies. His kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, the Earls of Carliſle and Suffolk, and the Lord Howard of Eſcric, had voted him guilty; and they uſed afterwards unjuſtifiable means to induce him to make diſcoveries. They aſked leave of the houſe of lords to viſit him in his priſon, under pretence of carrying the Biſhop of London and Dr. Burnet to converſe with him upon matters concerning his ſoul. The lords would not permit them to ſee him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a perſon appointed by the houſe to record what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhould be ſaid. Their deſign was to procure ſome diſcoveries againſt the Duke of York<note n="N" place="bottom">James II. 1680.</note>; but the jealouſy of the lords, in ordering them to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, diſappointed that project. Stafford's behaviour under condemnation, and at the place of execution, was decent and undiſturbed. His reiterated and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt aſſeverations of his innocence on the ſcaffold, changed in his favour the minds of the populace.—His venerable years, his ſortitude in the laſt extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his apparent ſincerity, touched all with pity, and melted many into tears. A ſilent aſſent to his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtations
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0709200301:329"/>
was obſerved over the vaſt multitude of ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators; whilſt ſome expreſſed, with faultering voices, their firm belief of all that he ſaid. The executioner himſelf ſeemed to ſhare in the ſympathy of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. He twice ſuſpended the blow, after raiſing the fatal ax; and when, at a third effort, he ſevered the head from the body, an univerſal groan was heard on all ſides<note n="O" place="bottom">Burnet, &amp;c.

In their eagerneſs for the bill of excluſion, no common victim was ſufficient to appeaſe their fury for being diſappointed in their views. In conſidering of ways and means to ſecure the kingdom againſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and arbitrary power, they formed a bill for diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arming the Papiſts, and removing them twenty miles from London<note n="P" place="bottom">Dec. 13.</note>. To call their attention to his wants, the King put them again in mind of his alliance with Spain and Holland, and the neceſſity of placing him in a condition to ſerve his allies, by an immediate ſupply. Inſtead of conſidering his ſpeech, they brought in, on the ſame day, a bill for an aſſociation to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the Duke of York, or any Papiſt, from ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the crown<note n="Q" place="bottom">Dec. 15.</note>. Having adjourned but four days for the Chriſtmas holidays, they met again on the thirtieth of December.

To ſhut up every chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of influence, they prohibited all members, under the penalty of expulſion, to receive even the promiſe of any place of profit or truſt<note n="R" place="bottom">Dec. 30.</note>.

Their ſelf-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nying vote, though perhaps impracticable, was high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuitable to the independence of parliament. The bill for rendering the judges independent tended to keep pure the current of public juſtice. The act for repealing the ſtatute of the thirty fifth of Elizabeth, for giving eaſe to Proteſtant diſſenters, bore the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a liberality in matters of religion that ſeldom diſtinguiſhes popular aſſemblies. But this bill owed its exiſtence more to the averſion of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular party to the Papiſts, than their lenity to Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant non-conformiſts. Shafteſbury freely owned, in the houſe of lords, that he wiſhed all diſſenters who ſhould ſubſcribe the teſt might be exempted from taking the oath of allegiance. A great debate aroſe on the ſubject.

The Earls of Cheſterfield, Aileſbury, and Oxford, all adherents of the Duke of York, were ſworn into the vacancies at the council-board<note n="F" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. The Prince of Orange was highly chagrined at the diſſolution of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. He was much diſconcerted by the removal of Sunderland, who had betrayed to him all the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the cabinet<note n="G" place="bottom">D'Araux, 1681.</note>.

In the laſt parliament, after the bill of excluſion had paſſed the commons, little oppoſition was made to the moſt extravagant propoſitions of the country party. Charles exerted all his influence in the houſe of lords. Beſides, he ſtood in reſerve, with his own power of putting an end to their violence by a diſſolution.—He ſcarce could expect any thing from the new par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament but the opportunity which the place of their ſitting offered for diſmiſſing them for ever with ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Theſe were his views in aſſembling them at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford. But the excluſioniſts hoped at laſt, from his neceſſities and love of eaſe, that he would yield to their vehemence. They filled therefore the whole kingdom with tumult and noiſe. They confirmed their friends with a certainty of victory. They intimidated their enemies, by appealing to the known unſteadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the King.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Negotiation with France</note> When the Duke of York heard, in Scotland, of the diſſolution, he diſpatched Churchill to the King with propoſals. He earneſtly entreated him not to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the new parliament to ſit till the popular heats ſhould abate. He preſſed him not to engage in any alliance with Spain and Holland, as the commons would forſake him in his diſtreſs, in caſe of a war. He adviſed him by no means to break with France, the only country that could enable him to ſubſiſt. He told him, that France dreaded a common-wealth in England; that Spain and Holland deſired ſuch a change in her government. He inſinuated that the Prince of Orange, gained by the popular party, complained of the prorogation, and much more of the diſſolution of parliament; and he aſſured him, from the beſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, that that Prince was zealous for the bill of excluſion. Charles agreed to a treaty with France; but he left it entirely to the management of the Duke of York. He ordered his brother to conſent to no article that might preclude him from calling of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or that ſeemed to leave Holland or Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders open to a French invaſion. He inſtructed him to preſs that the firſt payment of the ſubſidy might be more conſiderable than the ſucceeding and the laſt. He thought it improper to make any motion in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the treaty, for fear of diſappointing his views by an appearance of cagerneſs. But the French were

                  <note place="margin">Fitz-Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris's</note> While Charles formed ſome hopes of his being relieved from his diſtreſs by France, ſhe was framing ſchemes for rendering him ſtill more uneaſy at home. The more profligate part of the oppoſition in parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment were in her pay; and her ambaſſador at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don employed her money in procuring malicious libels, to alienate the affections of his people from the King<note n="L" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. He received, for this purpoſe, into his ſervice one Fitz-Harris, an Iriſhman and a Roman catholic<note n="M" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. This man, being the ſon of Sir Edward Fitz-Harris, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous royaliſt; had found means, ſome time before, to be admitted to the King, who gave him two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty pounds to extricate him from his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities. This being only a temporary relief, he hearkened with eagerneſs to the propoſals of the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador of France. Being himſelf unable to write for the public, he applied to one Everard, a Scotſman, who had been an informer, and a partizan to the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular party, to frame the libel. Everard, afraid of a deſign to trepan himſelf, placed ſecretly the witneſſes, Sir William Waller, a noted juſtice of the peace, and two other perſons, behind the hangings, to hear what paſſed between him and Fitz-Harris. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was apprehended and committed to priſon; and the libel, partly written by himſelf, and partly by Everard, was found in his pocket, and was ſecured as a proof to convict him before a court of law.—It conſiſted of ſevere reflections on the Popery and ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary principles of Charles and his family; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a formal advice to the people to depoſe the King, and to provide for themſelves<note n="N" place="bottom">Publications of the times.</note>.</p>

He ſent for Corniſh, one of the ſheriffs, and informed him that he was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed by the court to write the libel, to render odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous the excluſioniſts. The intention, he told him, was to ſend copies of the paper to the leaders of the oppoſition, and then to arreſt them, as conſpiring againſt the King. To enſure the favour of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0709200301:337"/>
he alſo became a diſcoverer of the great Popiſh plot. Corniſh having informed Charles of this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, the two ſecretaries were ſent to examine Fitz-Harris. He ſaid, that Montecuculli, who had been envoy in England from the court of Modena, had offered him ten thouſand pounds for murdering the King. He refuſed the offer; but he told him, that the King's death might be procured by poiſon, at the Ducheſs of Mazarine's houſe. He accuſed the Duke of York of being privy to the whole deſign. He affirmed, that an army from France and Flanders was to ſupport that prince; and that many parliament men, who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves for the bill of excluſion, were to be boiled to death, to make a kind of oil<note n="O" place="bottom">St. Ampoule. James H.</note>, to anoint him and the ſucceeding Kings of England at their coronation. The King ſaw the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this incoherent nonſenſe; and, being appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive that parliament would apply for a pardon for Fitz-Harris, he iſſued a ſpecial commiſſion of oyer and terminer for his trial; but the parliament met be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was carried into execution.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Its effect on the Duke of York.</note> Incredible, however, as the tale of Fitz-Harris ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, it intimidated thoſe who wiſhed to favour the Duke of York. That Prince, upon the oath of the noted Otes, who ſwore, that he had ſeen him receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſacrament according to the rites of the Romiſh church, was preſented for recuſancy at the Old-Bailey. An informality in the mode of proceeding furniſhed the Duke with a pretence to appear after proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but that was neither ſafe nor practicable. The affair was therefore removed by a writ of <hi>certiorari</hi> into the court of King's-Bench. This being after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards thought inſufficient, the Duke ſolicited for a <hi>noli proſequi;</hi> which, upon the diſcovery made by Fitz-Harris, was refuſed. That miſguided Prince ſaw now the diſmal effects of his own folly and obſtinacy growing every day. The popular party no longer talked of the bill of excluſion as ſufficient. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved at their meetings, that, to render it effectual, it muſt be attended with an act of aſſociation. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could, however, overcome his bigotry. Charles,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0709200301:338"/>
who had ſo often conjured him to conform to the eſtabliſhed church, renewed applications of the ſame kind in vain. He was neither to be won by entreaty, nor frightened by danger.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Preparations of the King.</note> Charles made no ſecret of his own fixed reſolution to yield in nothing to the country party. He publicly told the ambaſſadors of Spain and Holland, that it was in conſequence of his promiſe to them that he permitted his parliament to meet at all<note n="P" place="bottom">James H.</note>. He declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the ſame time, that he was determined to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve and not to prorogue them, ſhould they reſume their former violent meaſures. He accordingly began deliberately to prepare for extremities. The greateſt part of the Earl of Oxford's regiment were quartered on the road to ſecure his return. Another body of his guards were ordered to patrole along the way. The oppoſition of his family rendered colonel Ruſſel ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. His regiment was offered to the Earl of Thanet. The Duke of York recommended Mulgrave to the ſame command. The firſt declined to pay for his commiſſion to Ruſſel. The King himſelf refuſed the latter, from a prepoſſeſſion againſt his manner. The Earl of Craven, though then ſuperannuated, was left in the chief command<note n="Q" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Having made theſe arrangements, Charles left Windſor on the fourteenth of March. He was received on the confines of the county by the high ſheriff; and at Wheatley by Lord Norris, the lord-lieutenant, and conducted with great pomp to Oxford. The univerſity expreſſed their loyalty in addreſſes and feſtivity; and the King was ſo well pleaſed with his reception, that he ordered the particulars to be publiſhed, as an example of fidelity to the reſt of the kingdom. The popular party came with equal pomp, and ſcarce with leſs hoſtile prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to Oxford. Numerous bands of retainers in arms attended their leaders to parliament. Great multitudes, in particular, followed the four members for the city of London<note n="R" place="bottom">Kennet, et Auct. citat.</note>. The conteſt, however, would have been unequal, had things come to extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities. When a military force is once eſtabliſhed in a country, the liberty of the people depends either on the humanity, or happy timidity of the Prince.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Parliament meets at Ox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</note> On Monday, the twenty-firſt of March, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was opened at Oxford with a ſpeech from the throne. Charles, having determined to act with firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, expreſſed himſelf in an authoritative tone. The unwarrantable proceedings of the laſt houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, he told them, were the cauſe of the late diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. He aſſured them, that as he ſhould uſe no arbitrary government himſelf, he was reſolved not to ſuffer tyranny in others. He complained, that the former parliament had rejected his offer of limitation, refuſed to ſupport his alliances, and to preſerve Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gier. He informed them, that it was his intereſt, as well as his inclination, to preſerve the liberty of the ſubject; as the crown is in peril, when public freedom is threatened with danger. He argued his love of parliaments, by his meeting one ſo ſoon, after the former had diſtreſſed him with its heats. He expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his hopes, that the bad ſucceſs of the late violent proceedings might diſpoſe them to a better temper. He declared his fixed reſolution to adhere to the rights of ſucceſſion. He deſired them to remember, that without the ſafety and dignity of monarchy, neither religion nor property can be preſerved. He recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended union at home, as the only means to recover the importance of the nation abroad; and he conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with adviſing them to adapt the rules and meaſures of their votes to the eſtabliſhed laws of the land, which neither ought nor can be changed, except by an act paſſed by the three eſtates of parliament<note n="S" place="bottom">Journals of the lords, Mar. 21, 1681.</note>.</p>

greater ſhare of their attention. His evidence in writing was laid before the houſe, and recorded in their votes. Though incredible in many particulars, it ſeemed to be artfully connected with the tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the times. Some ſurmiſes were certainly juſt; and, upon the whole, Fitz-Harris appeared to have heard, as a matter of converſation among the enthuſiaſtic prieſts, ſome circumſtances which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. The commons knew, that the court was bent upon the conviction of the criminal. To ſave him from the animadverſions of the courts of common law, they voted his impeachment; and to add indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to their violence, they ordered Secretary Jenkins to carry the impeachment to the lords<note n="Y" place="bottom">Mar. 25.</note>.</p>

They produced a precedent from the reign of Edward III. to ſupport the juſtice of their conduct. But it was neither applicable nor ſuitable to the common-ſenſe of mankind. Their refuſal of an impeachment from the commons could be only juſtified by the violence of its intention. The lower-houſe immediately voted, that the conduct of the lords was a denial of public juſtice, a violation of the conſtitution of parliaments, an obſtruction to the diſcovery of the Popiſh plot, and of great danger to his Majeſty's perſon and the Proteſtant religion. They reſolved, that for any other inferior court to proceed againſt Fitz-Harris, or any other perſon lying under an impeachment of the commons of England, is a high breach of the privilege of parliament. In the ſury which aroſe concerning Fitz-Harris, they proceeded to other buſineſs. They reſolved to bring in a bill to baniſh all the Papiſts of England, that poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed one hundred pounds a-year, from his Majeſty's dominions, by their name.

the bill of excluſion. They offered to propoſe to the commons to make the Prince and Princeſs of Orange protectors, during the life of the Duke of York. The vivacity of Halifax fixed on the word protectors, inſtead of regents, to amuſe the republican party. Charles was willing to agree to any meaſure that might gain the commons, without breaking the line of ſucceſſion. He was offended at the abſurd bigotry of his brother; and he wiſhed to puniſh him, in any way conſiſtent with the right of his family to the crown. But when the expedient was propoſed, it was rejected with diſdain. The commons were ſenſible that no regent could poſſeſs equal influence with a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal King. To baniſh a monarch, whoſe title was recognized, was deemed at once abſurd and impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable. They therefore brought in a bill for a total excluſion; and they intended to follow it with an act of aſſociation, to render it effectual<note n="A" place="bottom">Mar. 26.</note>.</p>

He perceived that a great part of the nation ſeemed already to think they had driven things too far. He was reſolved to prevent, at all events, a breach upon the ſucceſſion; and he ſaw that he was to be ſupported, ſhould his conduct aſſume the appearance of ſpirit. The bill of excluſion was introduced on Saturday the twenty-ſixth of March. When the two houſes were met, on Monday the twenty-eighth, the King put on his robes privately, and was conveyed in a ſedan-chair to the houſe of lords. He drew the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains as he went, to conceal the crown, which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on his knee. The lords ſuſpected nothing, as he was wont to come daily to hear their debates. When he arrived, he ſuddenly mounted the throne; and placing the crown on his head, ordered the uſher of the black-rod to ſummon the commons. Silence and aſtoniſhment prevailed around. His very ſervants ſeemed ſurpriſed at a conduct which they might have foreſeen. The commons, in the mean time, arrived. The King told them, <q rend="inline">"that diviſions, which began

Prepared for no other mode of reſiſtance, they gave at once all their hopes to the wind. They found that they had built too much on the eaſineſs of Charles; and that they had miſtaken his forbearing policy for timidity. The fabric of oppoſition, which they had been rearing for ſeveral years, melted at once into air. A melancholy ſilence followed their vehement eloquence; and all their ſpirit took its flight with their good fortune. Fears for themſelves ſucceeded to their violence againſt the crown. They had loſt the field to a prince whom they, with every art, had offended and diſtreſſed, and they dreaded that he would uſe his victory with rigour; and they were not deceived. They haſtened each to his own home, as if terrified at the place where they had loſt their political conſequence. All the roads were in an inſtant covered with carriages and horſes. The King himſelf, as afraid of ſome attempt of their deſpair, haſtened in his coach to Windſor, attended by his guards, and the next day he came to Whitehall.</p>

The projected mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between the Biſhop of Oſnaburgh and the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Anne had not hitherto been laid aſide in the ſecret councils of the Prince.

His conviction being deemed a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the laſt importance to the crown, ſome extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary preparations were made. The lord chief juſtice Scroggs lay himſelf under an impeachment in parliament; and it was thought improper that one delinquent ſhould ſit in judgment upon another of the ſame kind. He was diſmiſſed from his office with a penſion. Pemberton, a man of boldneſs, and better abilities than character, ſucceeded Scroggs. Theſe precautions were, however, unneceſſary. Though the principal witneſs, Sir William Waller, was him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a violent party-man; though Johnſon, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the jury, had diſtinguiſhed himſelf as a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan of Shafteſbury, and an adherent of Monmouth; though the ſheriffs had choſen the reſt of the jury, on account of their popular principles; the fact was too clear to admit of his eſcape.

The Ducheſs of Portſmouth, being examined, ſwore that the begged ſome charity for him from the King, but that ſhe was privy to none of his concerns. Her woman, Mrs. Wall, was alſo called.

Shafteſbury, to enlarge the ſcale of the popular plot, had encouraged and ſupported informers, who endeavoured to eſtabliſh a belief of an Iriſh conſpiracy of the ſame kind. Some profligate prieſts, who wiſhed to gain the reward of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in England for perjury, had ſome time before accuſed Oliver Plunket, the Popiſh titular biſhop of Armagh, who called himſelf primate of all Ireland. Plunket was a man remarkable for the ſimplicity of his manners, quiet in his diſpoſition, and altogether an enemy to turbulence and intrigue. He was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, brought to England to take his trial. The wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, as uſual, were incredible in their evidence.

They ſwore, that he had engaged to the Pope to raiſe ſixty thouſand Iriſh to join an army of French in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaders, to deſtroy the Proteſtant religion. The Iriſh clergy, they affirmed, were to ſupport with their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions this deſign. Plunket, in defence, could only urge the improbability of this tale. He ſhewed that the Iriſh clergy were ſo poor, that he himſelf, who was called their primate, lived in a thatched hut upon ſixty pounds a year. He inſiſted upon the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious ſalſehood, that a body of men labouring under ſuch poverty, could furniſh money for the ſupport of a great army. The evidence, however, was poſitive.

On the twenty-fourth of June, the two ſheriffs were choſen from the popular party; and the common-hall voted their aſſent to the matter of the petition, for which the city had been reprimanded by the King. The addreſs of Shafteſbury was the chief cauſe of this obſtinacy. Having employed agents of the inferior ſort of people to keep up the flame, he contrived to carry the election of ſheriffs; a neceſſary precaution, when his enemies ſeemed determined to execute their vengeance through the channel of the law. Too artful himſelf to commit obvious treaſon, the court reſolved to puniſh his adherents. Two of his moſt active managers, College and Rouſe, were apprehended by a warrant from the council. The firſt was a tradeſman of ſome character, but a fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic; and the latter had been employed in conducting and ſupporting the evidence for an Iriſh plot; the moſt fooliſh, and to his party the moſt fatal, of all that nobleman's political ſchemes<note n="P" place="bottom">Kennet, Ralph, et Auct. citat.</note>.</p>

On the eighth of July, a bill was preferred againſt him; but the jury returned it indorſed with an ignoramus.
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0709200301:351"/>
The intemperate joy of the party upon this occaſion increaſed the reſentment of the adherents of the crown. Though the bill in Middleſex was fruſtrated, College was ſtill liable to another in the county of Oxford. A part of the treaſon of which he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed lay in the latter county; and the King might le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally proſecute in either, as ſuited his pleaſure. The aſſizes at Oxford were at hand. The priſoner was ſent to that place. The indictment was preferred to the ordinary grand jury, and a bill was found. But it was thought neither juſt nor politic to try him dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame aſſizes. On the ſeventeenth of Auguſt, a ſpecial commiſſion of oyer and terminer was iſſued to the Lord Norris, as lord lieutenant of the county of Oxford, the lord chief juſtice North, and the puiſne judges, Jones, Raymond, and Levinz, for the trial of College.

Having left the popular party when their power declined, they offered their ſervice to the court, and they were readily received. A ſpirit of retaliation, which overcame all the principles of juſtice, had, to the diſgrace of the age, ſeized the adherents of the crown. Though they ſaw with indignation the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries of thoſe villains, when employed by their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, they now availed themſelves of their teſtimony to favour their revenge. The chief charge againſt College was, that, in his zeal for the excluſioniſts, he had appeared at Oxford, during the ſitting of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, armed with ſword and piſtol; and that he had expreſſed himſelf to ſome of the witneſſes as being engaged in a conſpiracy to ſeize the perſon of the King<note n="R" place="bottom">Grey's Hiſtory of the Rye-houſe plot.</note>.

This was a deſire to call a parliament in Scotland, where, from the complexion of opinions, the Duke flattered himſelf with the hopes of a ſolemn act to recognize the rights of ſucceſſion, which had been invaded in England. Charles readily

The proclamation and letter to the privy-coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Scotland were not, however, diſpatched from London till the end of July. When the parliament met at Edinburgh, the Duke found that he had formed a juſt judgment of their attachment to the indefeaſible rights of monarchy. An act was immediately paſſed, <q rend="inline">"that no difference of religion, no act of the legiſlature made or to be made, could alter or divert the right of ſucceſſion, or lineal deſcent of the crown."</q> It was declared high treaſon in any one of the ſubjects of Scotland, by writing or acting, by word or deed, to endeavour the alteration or ſuſpenſion of the right of ſucceſſion.

The Duke of York, in the mean time, made exceptions to the management of the Lord Regiſter, to oppreſſions committed by Argyle, by means of his too extenſive juriſdictions in the Highlands, and to the conduct of the preſident of the ſeſſion.

                  <note place="margin">A new teſt.</note> The moſt remarkable act of the Scotiſh parliament was their paſſing a new teſt, which all perſons in the ſervice of government were obliged to take. This teſt, with a formal renunciation of the famous covenant, and a ſolemn affirmation of the King's ſupremacy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a reſolution of paſſive obedience, and of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming all alterations in the government of church and ſtate. To theſe articles, after they were introduced in parliament, ſome members, who had the courage to exhibit even a diſtant ſhew of patriotiſm, annexed a clauſe of adherence to the proteſtant faith. Though this was virtually contained in the article for maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eſtabliſhed church, it was readily granted, that the bill might paſs with more eaſe and unanimity. The teſt being ill conceived, and, if poſſible, worſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, contained many glaring contradictions and groſs abſurdities. Several perſons ſcrupled to take it, without an explanation; and the Duke himſelf ſeemed to conſider it as too ſevere<note n="Z" place="bottom">James II. 1681.</note>. The Earl of Argyle, as privy-counſellor, took the teſt, in the Duke's preſence, with an explanation of which his Royal Highneſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved<note n="A" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

He was indicted for leaſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>making, perjury, and high treaſon. Some writers af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the Duke was offended with the Earl for ſome expreſſions which he uſed in the debate in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, concerning a clauſe in the teſt-act for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empting princes of the blood from taking the oath. The fact is improbable, as the Lord Belhaven was, for words of the ſame import, committed priſoner by the parliament to the caſtle of Edinburgh; and it is not likely, that, in their preſent temper, they would paſs over in the Earl the fault for which they puniſhed the Lord. Beſides, the Duke himſelf aſſigns no ſuch motive for the proſecution of Argyle. He affirms, that there was not the leaſt deſign formed againſt either his life or fortune; but only to procure the forfeiture of ſome juriſdictions and ſuperiorities, which his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors had unjuſtly obtained, and he himſelf tyrannically exerciſed<note n="B" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. As a proof of this aſſertion, the Duke and

the Ducheſs of York entreated the King, by letters<note n="C" place="bottom">James II. 1681.</note>, to favour the Lord Lorne, who was permitted to come to court, after the condemnation, forfeiture, and eſcape of the Earl, his father.

The current in England was ſo ſtrong in favour of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, that ſcarce any thing remained to render the crown deſpotic, but the return of the heir-apparent to the eſtabliſhed religion. He reſolved, therefore, to make another attempt on the bigotry of his brother. He diſpatched Hyde to that infatuated Prince, and he arrived at Edinburgh on the thirty-firſt of Auguſt. He ordered Hyde to tell him, that unleſs he reſolved to conform entirely and go to church, no leave for his returning to England muſt ever be expected. <q rend="inline">"Tell him, Hyde,"</q> ſaid the King, <q rend="inline">"that unleſs he conform, I neither will nor can ſupport him, though I have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto done it at the riſk of my life and crown.

Three whole days he repreſented the preſent diſmal ſtate of affairs, and the melancholy proſpect of the future. He, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, could not prevail. He at length ſhewed to the Duke a note in the King's own hand, containing theſe words: <q rend="inline">"If you will go to church, without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more, you ſhall have leave to come to me when the parliament is adjourned<note n="D" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>."</q>

His high, monarchical principles, however, carried him too far. He ſuppreſſed a parliamentary inquiry into the conduct of the Lord Salton, though he ſaw, and even in ſome degree pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, his guilt. This part of his conduct proceeded from his opinion of the danger of ſubmitting the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the crown to the animadverſions of a popular aſſembly. His treatment of the fanatics partook more of rigour than any other part of his public conduct; but there is no juſt ground for believing that he was preſent at the tortures of criminals. That miſguided Prince has been as unfortunate in his hiſtorians, as he has been inexcuſable in many parts of his conduct.

To give the colour of juſtice to his conduct, he formed at Metz a court, which he called the Sovereign Chamber, to eſtabliſh a kind of claim to the territories which he meant to ſeize. This iniquitous tribunal declared<note n="F" place="bottom">April 12, 1680</note>, that the greateſt part of the duchy of Luxembourg was a dependence on the biſhoprick of Metz, which had been ceded by treaty to the crown of France. On the ſide of Flanders, he made a peremptory demand of the county of Chinei; and he laid claim to Straſbourg, as the capital of Alſace; which had been ceded to the crown of France by the treaties of Munſter and Nimeguen. To enable him to poſſeſs in tranquillity what he demanded under the form of juſtice, Lewis liſtened to the applications of Charles, whom his neceſſities and the violence of parliament had forced to propoſe a new ſecret treaty. The eagerneſs of the King of France to gain the friendſhip of a prince,

The ambition of the Prince of Orange added its own force to the terror and reſentment of Spain and Holland.

The States were induced to join in this extraordinary remonſtrance. Both inveighed againſt the diſſolution of the two laſt parliaments; and, in a manner ſcarce decent to an independent Prince, inſiſted with the King to yield thoſe points from which his quarrel with the commons had ſprung. The part which the Prince acted upon this occaſion was no ſecret to either of his uncles. They knew that his ambition had been vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently inflamed by the near proſpect of the Engliſh throne, furniſhed to him by the excluſion of the Duke of York. The Prince aſſured himſelf, that ſhould Charles be induced to take an active part againſt France, he muſt become dependent on parliament, and grant all that they deſired. The ſupply promiſed by Lewis enabled the King of England to diſmiſs his violent commons, and to reject what HE deemed the inſolent demands of his allies.

The former raiſed Sidney to the command of the regiments of Britiſh ſubjects in the ſervice of the States, in oppoſition to the nomination of the King, who had been uſually indulged with the recommendation of an officer to that employment. Charles being highly offended at this mark of diſreſpect, the Prince referred at length Sidney's affair to his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. The matter was at length compromiſed, by the King's giving to Sidney a conſiderable ſum of money. In his turn, Sidney promiſed to undeceive the Prince of Orange with regard to the meaſures which he wiſhed to be followed in England; and, for that purpoſe, he repaired to the Hague. On the ninth of July, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with a letter from the Prince, informing the King of his deſign to come to England, and requeſting a yacht for his paſſage. On the twenty-ſixth of July, the Prince accordingly arrived at Windſor, and was immediately admitted by Charles to a long conference. Seymour, Hyde, and the Earl of Conway, were preſent.

He had before temporized with his enemies, and it now was neceſſary to gratify his friends. Beſides, princes, like other men, are ſubject to human paſſions. He had been traduced in his character, inſulted in his perſon, vilified in his family. His authority as a King had been deſpiſed, his veracity queſtioned as a man. The reſpect due to his political function was forgot; even the decency, which his good-breeding as a gentleman ought to command, was neglected or abuſed. Though Charles was as forgetful of injuries as he was of favours, there is not perhaps virtue ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient in human nature entirely to forgive inſults car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to ſuch extremes.

The States, urged by the Prince of Orange and the Spaniards, forced by their neceſſities, made repeated applications to Charles for the calling of a parliament. Even ſome of his own miniſters joined in the ſolicitations of foreign ambaſſadors. He, however, was neither to be convinced by argument, nor gained by entreaty.

The Duke excuſes his own want of ſincerity, in not undeceiving his brother, by his having loſt all other hopes of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ever permitted to return from what he calls an honourable exile. He remained two months with the King. During that time he fortified his intereſt ſo well, that he was permitted to go to Scotland for the Ducheſs and his family; and, after his return, to fix his reſidence in London. He even gained the conſent of Halifax, by promiſing not to interfere openly in public affairs, till the opinions of mankind ſhould be more ſettled, after the late change.

Through the unſkilfulneſs, or, as ſome thought, the treachery of Captain Ayres, the pilot, he was in danger of being loſt at ſea.—The intention of the pilot was to follow the track of the colliers, between the ſand-banks and the coaſt, near Yarmouth. The officers ordered him to go out to ſea. He perſiſted to tack, fancying that he ſtill had time to go within the banks.

When the frigate, by being lightened, came to deeper water, ſhe began gradually to ſink; and the ſeamen in the boats were afraid to come near, for fear of being carried with her to the bottom. Juſt as the Glouceſter was ready to diſappear, the Duke of York was received into the yacht. The perſons left, in all about one hundred in number, gave a loud ſhout when they ſaw him ſafe: a mark that they had an affection for his perſon; and that he had not preferred, as ſome writers affirm<note n="Y" place="bottom">Burnet.</note>, the ſafety of his prieſts and dogs to the lives of the ſeamen. But though ſome boats carried ſeveral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from the Glouceſter, after the Duke left her, in his barge, many were drowned.

North and Box were recommended by the adherents of the court.—The popular party fixed on Dubois and Papillon.—The lord-mayor drank to North, who was prepared to accept the office by the chief juſtice of the ſame name<note n="A" place="bottom">Public Intell.</note>. A poll was opened for chuſing another ſheriff; but the common-hall refuſed to ſuſtain the right of the lord-mayor to nominate one ſheriff.—Moore adhered to his privilege of nomination. The old ſheriffs, Pilkington and Shute, abetted the majo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the livery. The lord-mayor adjourned the hall. The ſheriffs refuſed to obey.

The lord-mayor being indiſpoſed, ſent an order by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corder to adjourn the hall. The ſheriffs refuſed to obey. The privy-council again interfered. An order was ſent to the lord-mayor to preſerve entire the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtoms of the city; and, to reſtore the peace, to take effectual care, that at a common-hall, to be held on the fourteenth of July, all proceedings ſhould begin anew. When, therefore, the common-hall met on that day, North was put up only for confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, as being already duly elected by the lord-mayor. The majority of the common-hall ſtill inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their right of electing two ſheriffs. Two books for two different polls were opened; one by Pilkington and Shute, another by the lord mayor. The latter came upon the huſtings, and declared the election to have fallen on Box. The affair, however, was not finiſhed. Box declined the office, and paid his fine. The lord-mayor opened a ſecond time the books. One Rich was choſen by a few of the livery; and he and North were immediately ſworn.

                  <note place="margin">Intrigues at court.</note> The determined meaſures of the court to humble their enemies ſtruck a panic into the leaders of the popular party. The Duke of Monmouth, ſoon after the diſſolution of the parliament at Oxford, made offers of ſubmiſſion to the King through the Ducheſs of Portſmouth. He, however, accompanied this of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer with ſuch reflections on the Duke of York, that the King rejected them with indignation. He even carried his reſentment ſo far as to forbid in council all his ſervants from viſiting, upon any pretence what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, the Duke of Monmouth. Even Shafteſbury, intimidated by the loſs of the city of London, ſent a meſſage to the Duke of York, ſignifying his wiſhes of being reconciled<note n="D" place="bottom">James II. 1682.</note>. Either the Duke's obſtinacy, or the verſatility of the Earl, put an end to this negotiation as ſoon as it was begun. Shafteſbury returned to his former policy, of ſpreading myſterious and ſtrange re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. Deeming that the Duke had fortified his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0709200301:371"/>

Wild and impracticable as this plan ſeemed, that ambitious woman had turned her views that way. The Earl of Sunderland had, in concert with the Prince of Orange, reſolved to pay his court to her vanity and avarice. His object was to obtain the poſſeſſion of an office, through her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, which might furniſh him with an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſerving the Prince, by betraying the King and the Duke of York<note n="D" place="bottom">D'Avaux, paſſim.</note>. When ſhe returned from France in the month of July, ſhe accordingly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed her whole weight in his favour.

                  <note place="margin">Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth's progreſs.</note> The Duke of Monmouth having failed in his offers of ſubmiſſion, threw himſelf entirely on the popular party. To preſerve his influence among the people, as well as to make preparations for an inſurrection, that had been long projected, they adviſed him to make a progreſs through the north-weſt of England. His wife ſolicited him in vain to ſubmit without capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulation to the King<note n="F" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Shafteſbury, Ruſſel, Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tague, and others, prevented his adopting this pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent meaſure. He left London in the beginning of September, directing his courſe to Cheſhire. The populace received him at Coventry with the acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <q rend="inline">"A Monmouth and no York!"</q> But at Litchfield he paſſed through a concourſe of ſilent ſpectators<note n="G" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.

When he arrived at Stafford, he was apprehended by a warrant ſigned by Secretary Jenkins, and brought, in the cuſtody of the ſerjeant at arms, to London. He applied for a <hi>habeas corpus</hi> to the court of King's Bench, and he was bailed by ſeveral reſpectable perſons of the popular party. Though the power of the crown was now great and uncontrouled, it was prudently confined to the known channel of the law. But the ſtream of juſtice had loſt its purity. The meaſure which placed the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of juries in the adherents of the crown, made the laws the inſtruments of their vengeance. In the month of November, an inſtance of legal ſeverity was carried beyond all decent bounds. Pilkington, one of the late ſheriffs, being a violent party-man, had been extremely unguarded in his language againſt the Duke of York. When he heard of the Duke's return from Scotland, he broke forth into theſe puerile expreſſions: <q rend="inline">"He has already burnt the city, and and now he comes to cut our throats."</q> He was ſued at the inſtance of the Duke, and the jury awarded one hundred thouſand pounds damages. This was, in other words, condemning Pilkington to perpetual impriſonment; but the mode was at once ſcandalous and unprecedented.</p>

died Rupert, Prince Palatine of the Rhine, and Duke of Cumberland, in the ſixty-third year of his age. Courage was the moſt ſplendid part of his character; but he frequently carried that virtue into an extreme, which deſerved cenſure and met with misfortune. To a contempt of his abilities, Charles had, of late years, added a kind of averſion to his perſon. Though he herded not with the popular party, he avowedly approved of their principles; and therefore he was treated with great indifference, whenever he made his appearance at court. The death of Rupert was followed by that of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, the Earl of Nottingham<note n="L" place="bottom">Dec. 20.</note>. He was the firſt that reduced the proceedings of chancery to form and preciſion. But he was more remarkable for his knowledge of law, and the equity of his deciſions, than for his abilities as a ſtateſman.

                  </note> To retain the power which the court had acquired in the city of London was deemed by the royaliſts a meaſure of the laſt importance to their cauſe. Tho', by irregular means, they had carried the laſt elections in favour of their party, the ſpirit of their opponents was not yet entirely ſubdued. To prevent future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſts at the chuſing of magiſtrates, it was reſolved to reduce the conſtitution of the city to a leſs indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent form. All corporations, by their inſtitution, are liable to be diſſolved upon various grounds. The forfeiture of their charters, through negligence or abuſe of their privileges, may be effected legally by a judgment upon an information againſt them in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent court of common law. This information is denominated a writ of <hi>quo warranto,</hi> the nature of which is to enquire by what warrant the members of the corporation exerciſe their power, having forfeited it by ſome proceeding in the courſe of ſuit to be prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. A writ of this kind was iſſued, at the inſtance of the King, againſt the city of London, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of Hilary term in the preceding year. The city pleaded their right. The attorney-general replied. A demurrer followed; and the matter was ſuſpended for a time.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Judgment againſt the city,</note> Two reaſons were only alledged as ſufficient grounds for the forfeiture of the charter of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration. They had, it was affirmed, in diſreſpectful and ſcandalous terms addreſſed the King for the ſitting of parliament; and they had exacted money for pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic works, by illegal tolls on the markets within the city of London. Two arguments were only permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on either ſide, the laſt of which was in Eaſter Term. Treby, the recorder, and Pollexfen, a man of abilities, defended the corporation with great

addreſs and learning. Judgment, however, was given againſt the city in Trinity Term: but, by the expreſs command of the King, the judgment was not to be entered till his further pleaſure ſhould be known. This exertion of power, though in itſelf ſtrictly le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal, terrified the city and alarmed the nation. Men perceived, that by one bold ſtroke of policy, Charles added more to the influence of the crown than the many efforts of the moſt arbitrary of his predeceſſors on the throne. Notwithſtanding meaſures that anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilated the importance of the city, ſeveral of its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal inhabitants promoted them with violence and zeal<note n="P" place="bottom">James II. 1682.</note>.

A common council being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, they reſolved to ſubmit, without reſerve, their privileges to the will and pleaſure of the King. They confeſſed their own miſbehaviour, which had ſubjected them to his diſpleaſure. They implored his wonted clemency. They begged his directions, and requeſted to receive his commands. To this abject petition Charles made anſwer by his lord-keeper, Sir Francis North. He propoſed, that no lord-mayor, no recorder, no common-ſerjeant, no town-clerk, and even no coroner of London, ſhould henceforth enter upon the exerciſe of their reſpective offices without the approbation of the King, under his ſign manual. That ſhould the King twice diſapprove the lord mayor or the ſheriffs, he might appoint others by his own commiſſion in their room. That the mayor and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dermen might diſplace any magiſtrate by the leave of the King; and that no alderman ſhould be elected without the conſent of the court of aldermen; and that, after having twice diſapproved the choice of the freemen, they themſelves might appoint the vacancy to be filled. Upon a debate concerning theſe propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, they were accepted in the common-council by a majority of eighteen votes<note n="Q" place="bottom">Publications of the times.</note>.</p>

Soon after the Revolution, the judgment was reverſed by act of parliament; and it was at the ſame time enacted, that the privileges of London ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be forfeited by any delinquency whatever in the members of the corporation<note n="R" place="bottom">Siat. 2 W. and M.</note>. Terrified by the fate of London, the moſt of the other corporations of England ſoon after ſurrendered their franchiſes, and ſubmitted themſelves to new charters framed at the diſcretion of the court. This circumſtance threw at once the whole power of the ſtate into the hands of the King. More than three-fourths of the houſe of commons being choſen by the boroughs, the crown ſecured to itſelf by this meaſure a majority which no oppoſition could either ſhake or ſubdue. Some, who entered with eagerneſs into the proſecution againſt the city of London, on account of the delinquency of the members of the corporation, began, when too late, to perceive their error. In puniſhing the noiſy inſolence of a few citizens, they opened a door to other evils of a more permanent and dangerous kind.

The two parties which divided between them the corporation, carried their conteſts into the courts of juſtice, and haraſſed one another with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions and ſuits at law. Sir John Moore, the late lord Mayor, brought an action in the beginning of May<note n="T" place="bottom">May 8.</note> againſt Shute and Pilkington, who had been ſheriffs the proceding year, for a riot and an inſult upon his perſon, on Midſummer-day.

their principal adherents were at the ſame time proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted. Conſiderable fines were impoſed upon them all, after a long trial before Sanders, lord chief-juſtice of the King's-Bench. In the mean time, Dubois and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillon, who claimed a right of being the legal ſheriffs, arreſted Sir William Pritchard, lord mayor, the two ſheriffs, and ſeveral aldermen.

                  <note place="margin">Riſe</note> While the adherents of the court made ſuch progreſs in eſtabliſhing the authority of the crown, the whole fabric of government was undermined by a ſecret con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy, which had been long forming by the oppoſite party. The facility with which Charles had given up every capital point to the commons, during almoſt twenty years of his reign, had created an opinion, that there was no meaſure, however hard, to which he would not yield. When the bill of excluſion was rejected by the lords in November, 1680, men perceived that the King was reſolved to adhere to the eventual ſucceſſion of his brother to the throne. Thoſe who promoted the bill with moſt vehemence began now to fear for themſelves. They knew the character of the Duke of York, and they dreaded his vengeance ſhould he come to the crown. This opinion induced ſome of the leaders to liſten to the violent councils of Shafteſbury, who ſeemed reſolved to obtain by force from the King what he deſpaired to gain in a legal way. In a conference with Monmouth and the Lords Ruſſel and Grey, he endeavoured to perſuade them to his purpoſe, ſoon after the bill of excluſion was rejected, through the perſonal influence of the King with the lords. Terrified with the danger of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, or ſurprized at its magnitude, they liſtened for
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0709200301:378"/>
ſome time to Shafteſbury's propoſals without giving their aſſent: but an unexpected event induced them at once to embark in his deſperate deſigns.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs</note> In the month of February, 1681, the King was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Windſor with a ſudden illneſs. The news was immediately carried to the Duke of Monmouth, at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. He communicated the intelligence to Shafteſbury and Ruſſel. In a conference, at which Sir Thomas Armſtrong, Monmouth's boſom friend, was preſent, it was agreed, that an inſurrection ſhould be procured among the malecontents in the city, in caſe of the King's death. The project of the conſpirators was to riſe with their friends, to call a parliament, to ſettle the kingdom, to declare the deſcent of the crown; and to continue in arms, for their own ſecurity, till theſe points ſhould be obtained and their enemies ſubdued. The King's recovery broke for the preſent their meaſures. The new parliament ſoon after met at Oxford; and the party changed the mode of their conſpiracy, and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred it to that place. They formed a ſcheme not to ſuffer the parliament to be diſſolved; and determined to adjourn to the Guild-hall at London, when they ſhould find that a diſſolution was nigh. The precaution of Charles, in placing his guards on the road to Oxford, induced them to change a reſolution which might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with peril; and they at laſt agreed to encourage as many as poſſible of the lords and members of the lower houſe to continue to ſit after the King ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve the parliament.</p>

He concealed with ſuch art his reſolution to diſſolve the parliament, that the ſuddenneſs of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure diſconcerted all their deſigns. Shafteſbury, with ſome other lords, remained an hour in the houſe after the King's departure, under a pretence of ſigning a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. But when they ſent to the houſe of commons, all the members were gone. Time was only wanting to accompliſh their wild and dangerous plan. To unite the popular party in one deſign, the principal conſpirators convened them frequently to entertainments. The Duke of Monmouth, the Earls of Bedford, Maccleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, and Eſſex, kept open table. Grey only, of the whole junto, thought the deſign impracticable. The King was provided with a military force. But it was

anſwered, that the inhabitants of Oxford were well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the party. The ſtudents of the univerſity were, Grey affirmed, well affected to the King. Shafteſbury replied, that they had left their chambers to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the members. He added, that among the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guards there were many friends; and he obſerved, that many of their party were attended with armed retainers. He conſidered not that the judgement of the nation would turn inſtantly againſt an illegal parliament; and that terror, which generally accompanies a conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of being in the wrong, would inevitably ſubdue the party in their own minds.</p>

Shafteſbury the life and ſoul of the conſpiracy, ſpent the moſt of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of 1681 in fortifying his influence in the city of London. On the ſecond of July, he was, upon the oaths of his own Iriſh evidence, committed to the Tower, where he continued to the laſt day of November. The Earl of Argyle applied to him, in his impriſonment, for thirty thouſand, and afterwards only for fifteen thouſand pounds, to be collected by the party for ſupporting an inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Scotland. Argyle was ſuſpected, and nothing done. When the King determined, by irregular means, to poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs himſelf of the elections of London at Midſummer 1682, the zeal of the party, which had languiſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to be rouzed again by their fears. Meetings were held by the leaders. Ruſſel, in particular, reſolved ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to apply to an inſurrection. He founded Sir William Courtney, Sir Francis Rolls, and Sir Francis Drake, all men of weight and influence in their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive counties. Monmouth, under the pretence of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, made a progreſs to Cheſhire, to confirm the Earl of Macclesfield and the Lord Delemere. Shafteſbury re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in town, to inflame to action the citizens of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.

Ruſſel, expecting aid from different parts of the country, oppoſed this meaſure, as precipitate and

dangerous. Their difference in opinion produced a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of their reſpective deſigns. Shafteſbury was for a republic; Ruſſel only for a limited monarchy. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having communicated the ſchemes of the former to Monmouth, who aſpired to the throne, the conſpiracy was near being ruined with jealouſy. In the mean time, the adherents of the party in the country were cold and undeciſive. Sir William Courtney ſent a doubtful anſwer. Trenchard demanded delay. At a meeting of the lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with ſome inferior conſpirators, they determined to join with Shafteſbury, and to riſe in London. A day at length was appointed. Trenchard was to be diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the country, to anſwer the time. A meſſage was ſent to Courtney. Arms were provided in different places. Three field-pieces were bought by Shafteſbury. Monmouth ſurveyed the guards, and found them remiſs. Their ſtations were appointed to each. When every thing was ſettled, Monmouth communicated the whole to Trenchard, who ſeemed terrified, and demanded three weeks to prepare for the inſurrection at Taunton. A declaration was in the mean time prepared. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators ſeemed only to reſt on their arms in London, and to wait for the riſing of their friends in the country.</p>

                  <note place="margin">of the</note> During this awful ſuſpenſe, the timid Trenchard de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded further delay. Shafteſbury, by nature impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, and, beſides, rendered reſtleſs by his fears, could bear no longer the anxiety of his ſituation, and retired abroad. Walcot, an Iriſh officer, and Ferguſon, a Scotiſh clergyman, both members of the conſpiracy, attended him in his flight. They however, left him when he landed in Holland, and returned to their friends. He died of the gout in the ſtomach, ſix weeks after his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival at Amſterdam. The vehemence of his temper ſeemed to have increaſed with his years. Soured by diſappointments in his political views, he had become peeviſh in his language and imprudent in his meaſures. His very friends at laſt had reaſon to dread his vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, more than his enemies. The addreſs which had attended him in ſucceſs deſerted him in his political mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; and his party thought his flight, and even his death, an acceſſion of ſtrength to their cauſe. The ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of his conduct ſince the commencement of the Popiſh plot had offended men of principle of his own faction; no wonder that it raiſed the reſentment of his

                  <note place="margin">popular par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</note> His departure diſconcerted, for the time, the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the party. The communication with the heads of the intended inſurrection in the city was interrupted by the abſence of Ferguſon, who had chiefly managed the correſpondence between them and the Earl of Shafteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury. This reſtleſs plotter, however, ſoon returned, and opened the former intercourſe. Some perſons of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence were now added to the number of the conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. Algernon Sidney, who, from an averſion to Shafteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, had hitherto declined to join in their conſults, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended their meetings and animated their zeal. Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den was alſo received more intimately than before into their deſigns. The Lord Howard of Eſcric, a man of profligate manners, was admitted into their moſt ſecret councils. To manage their ſchemes with regularity and preciſion, a council of ſix was formed. Theſe were Monmouth, Eſſex, Ruſſel, Howard, Sidney, and Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Though all were equally bent upon an inſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they were divided in their views. Monmouth, Ruſſel, and Hampden, aimed at no more than the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual excluſion of the Duke of York; Eſſex, Howard, and Sidney, intended to erect a commonwealth. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding this difference in opinion, they all deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to proceed. Trenchard and Courtney were again engaged to riſe in the weſt. An inſurrection in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was concerted with the Earl of Argyle. Some of his friends, the Lord Melvin, Sir James Cochran, and others, were deſired to come to London; and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty agreed to furniſh them with ten thouſand pounds to purchaſe ammunition and arms.</p>

Other arrangements were in the mean time made, and his department aſſigned to each of the leaders. But, after the whole train was laid, an accident diſconcert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their ſchemes, and ruined the moſt of themſelves. Men of inferior rank, who were neceſſarily in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of the intended inſurrections, had met often toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and carried on an under-plot to aſſaſſinate the King and the Duke of York. This deſign, though not adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the council of ſix, out of delicacy to Monmouth,
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:0709200301:382"/>
was approved by ſome of the members. Among the leſſer order of conſpirators were Weſt, a lawyer, at whoſe chambers they chiefly met; Norton, Ayliffe, and Tyley, men of the ſame profeſſion; Colonel Rumſey, who had ſerved under Cromwell; Walcot, a republican officer; Goodenough, who had been under-ſheriff when the city was in the hands of the popular party. Of this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber was Ferguſon, the Earl of Shafteſbury's retainer and agent; Rous, who had eſcaped two years before by the favour of a jury; Kieling, a ſalter in London; and one Rumbold, who had ſerved in the capacity of a ſubaltern in Cromwell's army, and now followed the buſineſs of a maltſter at a farm near Hoddeſdon, on the road to Newmarket. To theſe were joined the Lord Howard of Eſcric, a man of a mean diſpoſition and abandoned cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, neceſſitous in his circumſtances, and hated for his profligacy where he was not deſpiſed for his cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice<note n="X" place="bottom">Vid.

To cover the horror of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign under a familiar name, they gave the appellation of <hi>lopping</hi> to the intended murder. Various ſchemes for this lopping buſineſs were formed. Some adviſed to ſhoot the brothers in their ſedan chairs in the ſtreets at night. Others propoſed to fire at once twenty pocket blunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſſes into the King's box, when he and his brother ſhould come to the theatre. Theſe, ſchemes however, were dropt as dangerous; and another, propoſed by Rumbold, was adopted with eagerneſs. His farm, called the Rye-houſe, as it lay on the way to New-market, was deemed the leaſt perilous ſcene for effectuating the murder.—The road being narrow near the Rye-houſe, Rumbold inſinuated, that by overturning a cart, the coach in which the brothers returned from Newmarket might be ſtopt, and they themſelves diſpatched with eaſe. An accident ſaved the King and the Duke from this imminent dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.

                  <note place="margin">A diſcovery.</note> Kieling, a ſalter in London, has been mentioned as a member of the inferior cabal. Zealous for his party, and bold and intrepid in his diſpoſition, he was the man who arreſted the lord-mayor, at the ſuit of Papillon and Dubois, the outed ſheriffs, when no other perſon could be found to undertake that dangerous ſervice. Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this folly, or, as he himſelf affirmed, ſtruck with remorſe of conſcience for his intended crime, he came to Secretary Jenkins on the twelfth of June and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered all he knew. Jenkins took his depoſition; but he told him at the ſame time, that without another evidence he could not iſſue warrants againſt the perſons accuſed. Kieling, by an artifice, engaged his brother in diſcourſe, upon the ſchemes of the party, with Goodenough; who, being a man of violent paſſions, ran out in extravagant expreſſions of treaſon in his detail of their deſigns. Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, fortified by two evidences, laid the affiar before the reſt of the miniſtry, the King being then at Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. The two Kielings were, in the mean time, left at large; and the moſt of the inferior conſpirators, appriſed of the diſcovery, conveyed themſelves away. Warrants were iſſued for apprehending Rumſey, Weſt, Walcot, Rous, and one Hone, a joiner. Some were taken, and they confeſſed enough to condemn themſelves; but they ſhewed an unwillingneſs to accuſe others. Men had been ſo frequently alarmed with fictitious plots, that the preſent diſcovery made no impreſſion. A kind of ſilence prevailed for ſome days; and the King gave ſo little faith to the conſpiracy, that he declined to come to London to forward the examination<note n="Z" place="bottom">Publications of the times.</note>.</p>

Ruſſel might have made his eſcape; but, by a ſtrange infatuation, he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that ſufficient evidence could not be found. Eſſex was appriſed of the diſcovery before meaſures for ſeizing his perſon were purſued; but his tenderneſs for Ruſſel is ſaid to have rendered him regardleſs of his own fate. The Lord Grey was ſeized by a meſſenger upon his way from the country to London. Howard was, a few days after, found concealed in a chimney in his own houſe. Neither Eſſex nor Ruſſel anſwered the expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their friends when they were brought before the council. The defence and deportment of the firſt ſuited neither his dignity nor former fame. Unmanned by a deep and ſettled melancholy, he was incoherent in his anſwers, and totally broken with deſpair. Ruſſel ſeemed to have forgot that modeſty which had been the moſt amiable part of his character. Relying too much on the faith of others, he aſſumed a confidence unſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his character, and little qualified to paſs for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence with diſcerning men<note n="A" place="bottom">Burnet.</note>.</p>

When he was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he diſcovered all the ſymptoms of an unmanly terror. He trembled, he faultered in his ſpeech, he burſt into tears. He completed his own infamy by revealing all the ſecret projects of his friends. Hampden and Sidney were ſeized upon his accuſation. They obſerved a pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent ſilence when they were examined. They conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves before enemies, who were prepared to put the moſt unfavourable conſtruction on their words. Almoſt all the conſpirators, except Monmouth, Arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrong, and Ferguſon, fell into the hands of the officers of juſtice. The Lord Grey had the good fortune to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from the meſſengers who were employed to carry him to the Tower. To eſtabliſh the belief of the plot before the leaders ſhould be tried, the inferior conſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors were firſt brought to the bar. On the eleventh of July, Captain Walcot was tried at the Old-Bailey. Rumſey, Kieling, and Weſt, were the witneſſes. His concern in the conſultations of the conſpirators was
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:0709200301:385"/>
clearly proved. Upon the like evidence, Rous and Hone were at the ſame time condemned. The reality of the plot was no longer diſputed by the people; and that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief was confirmed by the confeſſion of the criminals, who owned, at their execution, the juſtice of the ſentence.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Trial,</note> The day after the condemnation of theſe three con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators, the Lord Ruſſel was brought to his trial. The witneſſes againſt him were, Colonel Rumſey, one Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard, a wine-merchant in London, at whoſe houſe ſome conſultations had been held, and the Lord Howard of Eſcric. The two firſt concurred in their evidence with regard to Ruſſel's being preſent at Sheppard's houſe, at a meeting of the party, where the diſcourſe turned upon the meaſure of ſeizing the guards. Rumſey ſwore, that he had attended at a conſultation of the leaders, at which the priſoner was preſent, to know, in the name of the Earl of Shafteſbury, their reſolution concerning the riſing under Trenchard at Taunton. He gave in evidence, that he received for anſwer, <q rend="inline">"that Trenchard had failed; and that nothing further could be done in the matter at that time."</q> He ſwore that though he did not particularly remember that Ruſſel ſpoke concerning the inſurrection, he manifeſtly conſented to the anſwer. Howard gave a particular account of the eſtabliſhment of the council of ſix in the preceding January; of their debates con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning an inſurrection; of their conferences with the Scots; and of their reſolution of forming a fund of thirty thouſand pounds, to anſwer the immediate occaſions of the projected war. The witneſſes, though accuſed by ſome writers of perjury, ſeem to have advanced nothing but the truth. Even Rumſey, and particularly Sheppard, appear to have ſoftened the evidence againſt Ruſſel<note n="B" place="bottom">Carte's Ormonde, vol. ii.</note>. The latter had at the very time a conſiderable ſum in his hands, which he had received from Ruſſel, to be conveyed to the Earl of Argyle, who was making pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations for an inſurrection in Scotland<note n="C" place="bottom">Lord Grey's Hiſt. of the Rye-houſe plot.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</note> The conduct of the attorney-general was more blame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able than the evidence given by the witneſſes. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf in terms that bore his own conviction of Ruſſel's guilt, before the witneſſes were heard. He refuſed his conſent to a delay of the trial for a day. He would not permit a counſel to take notes of the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0709200301:386"/>
for the uſe of the priſoner. This conduct, though perhaps within the ſtrict rules of law, was ſevere, and therefore impolitic. But the chief juſtice behaved with the utmoſt candour and moderation. He, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to hear counſel upon an irregularity in the indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of which Ruſſel complained. The defence made by the priſoner himſelf was feeble and unſatisfactory. He proteſted with truth, that he had never entertained even a thought againſt the King's life; but his being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in preparations for an inſurrection, he neither af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed nor denied. The jury, all men of reſpectable characters, brought him in guilty, with little heſitation. His former character, his popularity, and the amiable virtues of his private life, created a general regret for his fate. But it does not appear that unfair means were uſed at his trial, or that any part of the proceedings againſt him were contrary to the common uſage of the law in caſes of treaſon.</p>

                  <note place="margin">behaviour,</note> Though ſeverity was by no means one of the vices of Charles, he reſolved to liſten to no requeſts for a pardon. The entreaties of friends, the ſupplications of a father, the tears of a wife, and even the petition of the unfortunate Lord himſelf, were productive of no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. When his feelings were attempted in vain, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication was made to his neceſſities. One hundred thouſand pounds were ſaid to have been offered for Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel's life. But money itſelf could not purchaſe forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for a perſon whoſe conduct had ſo much offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his pride. The very virtues of the criminal had ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his vehement meaſures leſs pardonable, as they might have been attended with danger. Ruſſel, it muſt be confeſſed, had carried his oppoſition into acts of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, more calculated to irritate the King than to ſerve the nation. The part which he took in parliament was regular and manly. His warmth in the affair of the excluſion might be excuſed by the utility of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. But when he appeared in the company of Otes, to preſent the Duke of York for recuſancy, he ſunk be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the dignity of his principles, and gave offence without ſerving his own cauſe. No part of his public conduct ſeemed to be either forgot or forgiven. Charles, in remitting the ignominious part of the ſentence, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied the favour with a ſarcaſm expreſſive of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <q rend="inline">"The Lord Ruſſel,"</q> ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"ſhall find that

At his execution his behaviour was manly and cool. Having, ever ſince he was ſeized, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned all hopes of life, his mind was fortified againſt death. The ſcaffold on which he was beheaded was erected in Lincoln's-Inn-Fields<note n="E" place="bottom">July 21.</note>. This place was cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, as the neareſt ſquare to Newgate<note n="F" place="bottom">Burnet's two ſermons, preached in Newgate before Lord Ruſſel.</note>, where he was confined. Party-writers aſcribed the choice to a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance not founded in fact. Inſtead of ſpeaking to the multitude, he gave a paper, containing his laſt thoughts, to the ſheriff. The ſhort ſpeech with which he is ſaid to have accompanied the delivery of the paper, appears not to be genuine. It denies all knowledge of an intended inſurrection; an untruth too palpable to have been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered by a man deemed even by his enemies ſincere. The ſpeech publiſhed in his name, ſeems partly to be the production of another pen. Dr. Burnet attended him in priſon, and he intereſted himſelf for the memory of his friend. His ſpeech contains neither an explicit confeſſion, nor abſolute denial of the inſurrection. But he was extremely anxious to remove the imputation of a deſign againſt the life of the King, and for a change in the government. The precaution was ſuperfluous. The evidence contained no direct charge of that kind. The allegation in the indictment was a mere implication of law, introduced into the practice of the courts to accommodate actual preparations for treaſon to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Edward the Third.</p>

                  <note place="margin">character of Ruſſel.</note> The amiable character of this unfortunate Lord made his fate to be regarded as ſevere. He was a man of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in private life, and of principle in his public conduct. In the character of a ſon, a huſband, and a friend, he merited every praiſe. In a ſincere affection for his
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:0709200301:388"/>
country, he had few equals. But his talents were li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited; his temper ſanguine; his patriotiſm frequently degenerated into paſſion. He was credulous, through vehemence; and, through his credulity, the dupe of deſigning men. His popularity, however, was neither acquired by art, nor retained by meanneſs. He was a ſtranger to duplicity; and as he had few vices to hide, he concealed none of his virtues. Thoſe amiable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which ſeldom accompany an extenſive capacity, rendered him regretted by all. Though he had no claim on the favour of Charles, his pardon would have been a popular act. His fate, however, has been more la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by late writers than by his own cotemporaries. Many could not ſeparate the idea of rebellion from an inſurrection. Few could diſtinguiſh a meditated riſing againſt the King's authority, from a deſign againſt his life. The evils of a civil war were deemed, by the moſt of mankind, more dangerous than the grievances which the popular party meant to prevent, by ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent meaſures. They could ſcarce reconcile to their minds, that the loſs of a city election was a ſufficient reaſon for involving the nation in blood. Upon the whole, if the meaſures of the crown juſtified the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of Ruſſel, Charles was ſcarce to be blamed for abandoning that Lord to the animadverſion of the law.</p>

the imputation continued.

                  <note place="margin">Marriage of the Lady Anne.</note> The diſcovery of the plot againſt his life increaſed the influence of Charles, by intereſting the nation in his ſafety.

To leſſen the fears of Popery, which ſtill prevailed in the kingdom, he reſolved to marry his niece, the Lady Anne, to a Proteſtant Prince. The hopes of ſecurity to religion, which had been derived from the marriage of the Duke's eldeſt daughter to the Prince of Orange, had been greatly damped by the ſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility of that Princeſs; and men turned their eyes to her ſiſter for continuing the ſucceſſion of the crown.

The Prince of Orange ſent Bentinck to England, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to break off the match between his ſiſter-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>law and Prince George of Denmark. He wiſhed to give that Princeſs to the Electoral Prince of Branden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh, under a promiſe of making him heir to all his own poſſeſſions; an expectation which could not fail to keep him in perpetual dependence. The Duke of York, habitually obedient to his brother, was paſſive in whatever regarded his daughters; and the King, ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the folly as well as impropriety of a ſovereign's profeſſing any other ſyſtem of religion than that eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed among his ſubjects, had taken care to breed his nieces in the faith of the church of England. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance had leſſened the paternal affection of the Duke; and induced him, in ſome meaſure, to conſider his daughters as his rivals in his political views.</p>

The ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice of comprehending, in a clear and conciſe detail, the evidence of the witneſſes, by raiſing the horror of the nation againſt the plotters, increaſed their attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the King. The ſpirits of the party were now broken and ſubdued. No reply was attempted, nor even feared. Sir William Jones, who had anſwered the former declaration, was lately dead. Men of letters had changed their opinions with the times. The clergy were violent for monarchy. The univerſities abetted the high prerogatives of the crown. In Oxford, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree was paſſed on the twenty-firſt of July, condemning twenty-ſeven propoſitions, which favoured republican principles and religious fanaticiſm.

<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0709200301:392"/>
of ſix, whoſe prior conduct ſeemed to preclude him from favour, and whoſe principles, on account of his courage and abilities, were feared. This was Algernon Sidney, who had remained priſoner in the tower ever ſince the beginning of July, when he was firſt accuſed by the Lord Howard of Eſcric. An accidental change in the higher departments of the law ſeemed to pave the way for the trial of Sidney. Sanders, lord-chief-juſtice of the King's-Bench, a man of obſcure birth and limited talents, had been found unfit for his place, from debilities which aroſe from an intemperate and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious life. Upon his death, in the month of September, he was ſucceeded in his office by Sir George Jefferys<note n="Q" place="bottom">Kennet, vol. iii.</note>, chief-juſtice of Cheſter, a man of outrageous abilities and violent principles. Bold and intrepid, from a fixed diſregard of the world; profligate, from a contempt of virtue; fair only to thoſe whom he feared; a tyrant to the unfortunate, and a fawning ſlave to the great. But even Jefferys, in indifferent matters, was as juſt in his deciſions as he was able in his opinions<note n="R" place="bottom">North's Examen.</note>. But when the rights of the ſubject interfered with the prerogative of the crown, he warped juſtice to his political views; and, being an able, he became a terrible judge.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Algernon Sidney.</note> Jefferys, from the fierceneſs of his character, was deemed the only fit match for the abilities and firmneſs of Sidney. On the 7th of November, the priſoner was brought from the tower to the bar of the King's-Bench, where he was arraigned upon an indictment of high trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for conſpiring the death of the King, and levying war againſt his Majeſty. He deſired a fortnight to prepare for his trial, which was granted; and he was brought again to the bar on the 21ſt of November. The chief articles againſt him were his ſending a meſſenger into Scotland, to invite the malecontents of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to rebellion; and his writing a treaſonable libel, found in his cloſet, upon the original and forms of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Though perhaps ſcarce any doubt was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of the part which Sidney acted in the intended inſurrection, the evidence was not ſo full as the laws of treaſon required. Weſt, Rumſey, and Keiling ſwore only from hearſay. The teſtimony of the Lord Howard
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0709200301:393"/>
of Eſeric was poſitive, home, and deciſive. But as one fact only, and that ſworn by one witneſs, was not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to condemn the priſoner, aid for that purpoſe was derived from the pretended libel found in his cloſet. The axiom, that <q rend="inline">"to write was to act,"</q> was inculcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with vehemence; and general obſervations upon go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verment were ſtrained to make them apply to the preſent times.</p>

                  <note place="margin">He is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned.</note> Though much was expected from the ſpirit and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of Sidney, men were diſappointed when he came to his defence<note n="S" place="bottom">Kennet, vol. iii.</note>. He inſiſted, that the conſpiring to levy war, and to compaſs the death of the King were two diſtinct crimes; and that the firſt did not fall within the ſtatute of Edward the Third, upon which he was tried. He argued againſt the credibility of the Lord Howard's evidence; and in that point only he ſeems not to have been ſincere. The profligacy of Howard, his ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to Sidney himſelf, the point of view in which he ſtood, as an evidence againſt his friends, were all favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the priſoner. But his adhering, without any ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial deviations, to the great line of facts already proved, left little room to doubt of the truth of his teſtimony. Sidney argued with moſt vehemence and juſtice, againſt the uſe made againſt him by the court of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended libel. Though it was connected by the Attor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-general, and ſuſtained by the judges, as a part of the late conſpiracy, it appeared, by undoubted proofs, to have been written many years before. Beſides, being upon the general ſubject of government, the poſitions which it contained could not, without the moſt glaring injuſtice, be conſtrued into a ſeditious and dangerous libel. They might ſerve as inſtances of the principles of the author; but as they never had been publiſhed, and probably never ſeen by a ſecond perſon, they could not poſſibly have done any miſchief, to juſtify the ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſion of the law.</p>

                  <note place="margin">and execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> The arguments of Sidney and the legal defects in the evidence were but feeble pleas where the court had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to condemn. The known republican principles of the priſoner, the certainty of his being in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree concerned in the late conſpiracy, his uncomplying
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0709200301:394"/>
ſpirit, and even his abilities, had already prejudged him in the minds of the royal party. A partial charge by Jefferys induced a prejudiced jury to bring him in guilty. The informality in the proceedings and the defects in the evidence were dangerous precedents, and generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. But theſe inſtances of injuſtice regard only the judges and the jury. Sidney aſked a pardon in a manner calculated to have it refuſed. Charles may be excuſed for not granting it to one who was an avowed enemy to monarchy, and who was undoubtedly guilty of deſigns againſt his government, if not ultimately againſt his life. A fortnight after his receiving his ſentence, Sidney was beheaded on Tower-hill; the King having remitted the ignominious part of his ſentence, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the high quality of his family. His behaviour at his execution, though firm and undaunted, was more enthuſiaſtic than dignified and ſedate. In a ſpeech from the ſcaffold he repeated the ſubſtance of his defence at his trial in a manly, conciſe, but paſſionate manner; and when he was ready to lay his head on the block, he gloried to die for the good old cauſe in which he had been engaged from his youth<note n="T" place="bottom">Kennet.

Being a republican from opinion, he had been active againſt the late King; and from the ſame principle he oppoſed Cromwell, when his conduct be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſubverſive of public liberty. When the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had eſtabliſhed a ſhew of freedom, upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation of Richard Cromwell, he entered into the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his country: but at the Reſtoration, he prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a voluntary exile to a ſubmiſſion to kingly govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When the connection of the court with France, the poperty of the Duke of York, and the artifices of the oppoſing party in parliament, ſeemed to promiſe troubles in England, he ſolicited and obtained a pardon from the King. He herded afterwards with the popular party; but he never had influence ſufficient to obtain an undiſputed ſeat in parliament, even moſt of the elections were carried againſt the court. In his political opinions he was harſh and auſtere; and even in his pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

His principles ſuited nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a people accuſtomed to the government of a ſingle perſon, nor the profigacy of the times. In Rome or Athens, in the days of their ſimplicity and freedom, he might have arrived at the fame of their firſt patriots; but he was a viſionary politician, and even a dangerous citizen under a monarchy. In the extravagance of his views ſeems to conſiſt the greateſt defect in his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He dreamed perpetually of an ideal fabric of a republic, without conſidering the wretched materials of which it was to have been framed.</p>

No new levies however were made; and the Prince is ſaid, in revenge, to have exerciſed a violent and unlawful power<note n="D" place="bottom">D'Avaux, 1683.</note>.

While the Prince exerciſed a degree of tyranny over the States, he endeavoured to induce the Spaniards to reject not only the arbitration, but even the mediation of the King of England.

Having made a journey to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, and failing to perſuade the council of thirty-ſix to agree to the new levies, he flew into the moſt violent rage. He openly accuſed them of a correſpondence with France. They threatened on their part to bring him to an account for his conduct. He left the hall with all the ſymptoms of rage and reſentment. The mob hiſſed him in the ſtreets, on account of the loſs of the fleet lately coming from the Baltic.

Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loway, a linen-draper at Briſtol, being concerned in the late plot, had fled, upon the diſcovery, to the iſland of Nevis<note n="S" place="bottom">Ibid vol. iii.</note>, in the Weſt Indies. He was ſeized and ſent to England; and, on the twenty-firſt of April, having waved a trial, he was condemned to death upon the outlawry which had followed his indictment for treaſon. The Duke of York had, in the preceding Michaelmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>term, brought his action, on the ſtatute of <hi>ſcandalum mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natum,</hi> againſt John Dutton Colt, a member of the late parliament, and bailiff of Leominſter, in the county of Hereford, for ſeveral ſcandalous expreſſions and threats againſt his life. On the third of May, a jury brought in their verdict in favour of the Duke, and aſſeſſed for da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages one hundred thouſand pounds. The noted Otes, for the like offence, was fined in an equal ſum. The greatneſs of the fine defeated the end of the judgment, by rendering the payment impoſſible. Theſe deciſions, however, were mere ſubterfuges, to juſtify perpetual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment for offences to which the law had not annexed

a puniſhment ſo ſevere. In the month of June, Sir Thomas Armſtrong, the friend, the favourite, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal adviſer of Monmouth, was executed at Tyburn. This unfortunate man, having taken refuge in Holland, was ſeized in that country by Chudleigh, the King's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, and tranſported in a yacht to London. Though the term appointed by the proclamation for his ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering himſelf was not elapſed, he was refuſed the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of a trial.

                  <note place="margin">Duke of York Lord Admiral.</note> Theſe proceedings in the courts of juſtice have been, by ſome writers, aſcribed to the violence of the Duke of York. But no proofs are produced, except ſuch as ariſe from the opinion formed of the character of that Prince. In all unſucceſsful attempts againſt an eſtabliſhed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unjuſtifiable ſeverities have ever been exerciſed. The hiſtory of no country is free from blemiſhes of that kind; and that of England labours under the like diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, at different periods. The bending of the laws to the purpoſes of vengeance was, in the preſent juncture, more dangerous as a precedent, than the puniſhments themſelves were unjuſt. The crown, however, ought not to eſcape from cenſure for the ſeverities of the courts of law. Without the approbation of the King, it is not probable that judges would have proceeded to ſuch extreme rigour. Without his permiſſion, they even could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed at all. He may, therefore, be deemed an acceſſary to miſchiefs which he did not prevent; though, perhaps, this indolence is more to be blamed, than either the violence for ſeverity of his temper. The Duke of York, to all appearance, adviſed his brother in ſecret; but he oſtenſibly took no part in public affairs, till the May of the preſent year. On the twelfth of that month, he was declared Lord High Admiral<note n="U" place="bottom">James II.</note>. On the twenty-eighth, he took his ſeat at the council-board. Though his promotion was an actual ſuſpenſion of an act of parliament, no mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murs aroſe in the nation. Men thought that a Prince, who one day was to be their ſovereign, might, without the formality of oaths, be admitted to the management of a department, which of all others he beſt underſtood.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Promotions.</note> The great power of the Duke of York is, however, evident from the promotions of his adherents and ſuppoſed friends. In the month of April, Godolphin ſucceeded<note n="X" place="bottom">April 17.</note> Jenkins in the office of ſecretary of ſtate. In Auguſt, he was made firſt commiſſioner of the treaſury<note n="Y" place="bottom">Aug. 24.</note>, and ſoon after created a baron. Hyde, who had been raiſed to the dignity of Earl of Rocheſter, ſucceeded, as preſident of the council, the old Earl of Radnor, who retired. The Earl of Middleton, one of the ſecretaries for Scotland, was raiſed to the ſame office, in the room of Godolphin, in England. The lord chief juſtice Jefferys, whoſe ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices in the midland circuit had been highly grateful to the King, was admitted into the cabinet. Theſe changes were deemed by diſcerning men the forerunners of more violent meaſures. The Duke of York, who proceeded on ſyſtem, ſeemed reſolved to ſecure the power which the crown had obtained. A violent favourer of prerogative from principle, he had been confirmed in his opinions, by the vehemence of his opponents, for ſeveral years. Though their ſpirits had been ſubdued for the preſent, the flame might again break forth with redoubled violence. To prevent a circumſtance, which to him muſt prove unfortunate, conſidering his obſtinate bigotry, he proceeded to meaſures, which were more precipitate than unſkilfully framed. He is ſaid to have formed a plan for the new-modelling the affairs of Scotland and Ireland; that, by ſecuring the unlimited authority of the crown in thoſe kingdoms, he might overawe England, and retain her in that ſubmiſſion, which the high principles of monarchy, more than the force of the Prince, had gained<note n="Z" place="bottom">Publications of the Times.</note>.</p>

The high-church party, poſſeſſed of the power of government, turned its whole force upon wretched fanatics, whoſe deſperate zeal ought to be the ſubject of pity, more than the object of puniſhment.

The folly on each ſide was equal; but thoſe who ought to be moſt wiſe were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the moſt to blame. The chiefs of the intended in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection in England thought it prudent to apply to the leaders of the enthuſiaſts in Scotland. A meſſenger, by the procurement of Sidney, was ſent to them in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the year 1683. Several Scots, under a pretence of negotiating a ſettlement for ſome of their countrymen in Carolina, arrived in London in April, and were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the conſultations of the principal conſpirators<note n="A" place="bottom">Woodrow, Burnet, Trials.</note>.</p>

He was condemned, in the end of December 1684; and though he laboured under a ſevere indiſpoſition of body, he behaved at his execution with ſpirit. Though a man of letters, he ſeems to have been an enthuſiaſt; and to have derived from the conſciouſneſs of the juſtneſs of his religious opinions, the firmneſs which other patriots might have obtained from philoſophy. The proceedings againſt him were more irregular than his puniſhment was unjuſt.

During an abſence of two years in London, his meaſures continued their good effects. Trade and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try increaſed, and the public tranquillity continued, under his deputy the Earl of Arran. His own behaviour in England ſeemed to merit a better return than was ſoon after made to his ſervices. A reſolution being formed, by the advice of the Duke of York and his friends, to new-model the affairs of Ireland, Ormonde was recalled from his government, in the month of October in the preſent year. The alterations, or rather total change to be made, would neither ſuit the dignity nor the principles of that noble governor. An army, into which Catholics were to be admitted, was to be formed, under a lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-general, independent of the lord-lieutenant and civil power. The King adopted with precipitation a meaſure which flattered him with the continuance and ſtability of his preſent power. He wrote to Ormonde, in terms of reſpect and confidence; but at the ſame time he informed him, that he had made choice of the Earl of Rocheſter to ſucceed him in the government of Ireland<note n="C" place="bottom">Carte's Ormonde.</note>.</p>

Supported with powerful armies, and in the midſt of tranquillity prepared for war, Lewis the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth attempted to juſtify encroachments on the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Spain by pretended claims, founded on the treaty of Nimeguen.

A meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger was immediately diſpatched to the Duke of York; but, before he arrived, Dr. King, a phyſician, being in the drawing-room, was called in, and he let him blood.

The attention of Charles to Huddleſton is not inconſiſtent with his joining Dr. Kenn in the ſervice of the church of England. In the full vigour of his conſtitution, he was probably attached to no particular religion; though motives of policy induced him to conform ſtrictly to the faith eſtabliſhed by law. To the church of Rome he was certainly never reconciled; if his acceptance of the ſacrament from a prieſt, when his underſtanding

The papers found by his brother in his ſtrong box, and which that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guided Prince publiſhed ſoon after, furniſh no evidence of a change in his faith. They were not of his hand-writing. They were known to have been delivered to him, at the inſtance of ſome Roman Catholics, by a Lord Bleſſington, who, as an object of ridicule, had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to his perſon, from his being the author of a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh play<note n="M" place="bottom">MS. anecdotes, <hi>penes me.</hi>

                  </note> The character of Charles the Second, like the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions of his reign, has aſſumed various appearances, in proportion to the paſſions and prejudices of different writers. The nation being long divided into two par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, hiſtory became an engine of faction, more than the vehicle of truth. The adherents of the crown, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers of the ſucceſſion in the ancient line, have co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered acts of folly and inſtances of deſpotiſm with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyric. The ſupporters of the Revolution have done their beſt to injure their own cauſe, by ſuppoſing that it required to be juſtified by the miſrepreſentations and fictions of party. To ſteer between the two extremes is the direct path to truth, in the character of this Prince and the hiſtory of his reign. To affirm that he was a great and good King, would be as unjuſt as to allege that he was deſtitute of all virtue, and a bloody and inhuman tyrant. The lines of his mind have been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready traced with ſome preciſion. His political conduct has been occaſionally examined, as the facts aroſe.

Had he joined the ambition of power, and the perſeverance and attention of his brother, to his own inſinuating and engaging addreſs, he might have ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own reputation with writers, by enſlaving them with the nation.</p>

                  <note place="margin">on the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</note> In his perſon he was tall and well-made. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion was dark; the lines of his face ſtrong and harſh, when ſingly traced: but when his features were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in one view, they appeared dignified, and even pleaſing. In the motions of his perſon he was eaſy, graceful, and firm. His conſtitution was ſtrong, and communicated an active vigour to all his limbs. Though a lover of eaſe of mind, he was fond of bodily exerciſe. He roſe early, he walked much, he mixed with the meaneſt of his ſubjects, and joined in their converſation, without diminiſhing his own dignity, or raiſing their preſumption. He was acquainted with many perſons in the lower ſtations of life. He captivated them with ſprightly turns of humour, and with a kind of good-na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured wit, which rendered them pleaſed with themſelves. His guards only attended him upon public occaſions.—He took the air frequently, in company with a ſingle friend; and though crowds followed him, it was more from a wiſh to attract his notice, than from an idle curioſity. When evidence of deſigns againſt his life was daily exhibited before the courts of juſtice, he changed not his manner of appearing in public. It was ſoon after the Rye-houſe plot was diſcovered, he is ſaid to have been ſevere on his brother's character, when he exhibited a ſtriking feature of his own.

affection for his perſon, upon the diſcovery of the intended aſſaſſination at the Rye-houſe, contributed much more than the management of his party to lay the conſtitution in ruins at his feet. He is ſaid, and with reaſon, to have died opportunely for his country. Had his life extended to the number of years which the ſtrength of his conſtitution ſeemed to promiſe, the nation would have loſt all memory of their liberties in his popularity. Had he even ſurvived his brother, Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land would have gradually dropt into that tranquil but humiliating deſpotiſm which now prevails over moſt of the nations of Europe.

The victory of the crown was deciſive, as it had been obtained through the changed opinions of the people. The objections againſt his political principles, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors entertained of his religious zeal, had loſt, in ſome meaſure, their effect, as they were firſt raiſed by a party now fallen into diſgrace, as well as ruin. Even his being the laſt male of his family carried the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of many into a forgetfulneſs of his faults. Beſides, his own character and deportment were favourable to high expectations from his conduct. Habituated to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, and accuſtomed to buſineſs, he had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways eſteemed by the trading part of an induſtrious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, though ſtately, being well-bred, and attentive in his addreſs, he was reſpected where he was not loved. The decency of his manners recommended him to the virtuous. His obſtinacy, which was miſtaken for firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, flattered the hopes of the royaliſts with a deciſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of meaſures, which had been long baniſhed from the fluctuating councils of the former reign.</p>

The King at the ſame time iſſued a proclamation, that all perſons in offices under government ſhould continue to exerciſe their functions till his Majeſty's further plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. In honour of his brother's memory, he ordered in the ſame paper, that all his ſubjects ſhould yield im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit obedience to all the orders and directions iſſued by his late Majeſty. But the ſtate of the revenue was of more importance, and demanded moſt of his care. The tonnage and poundage, the cuſtoms and exciſe in part, had been granted only for the life of the late King, therefore could not be legally levied without the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of parliament. To remit thoſe duties till a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be called would at once hurt the fair trader and injure the crown.

The Marquis of Halifax, tho' known to have formerly been no friend to the King when Duke of York, was declared lord preſident, in the room of the Earl of Rocheſter. The impreſſion which the able conduct of that nobleman, againſt the bill of excluſion, had made on the mind of James, was not obliterated by his oppoſition in the cabinet againſt his views in the latter years of his brother's reign. When Halifax attempted to make an apology for his conduct, the King is reported to have ſaid, <q rend="inline">"that he forgot all the paſt, except his behaviour with regard to the bill of excluſion."</q> This forgiving temper in James was, however, much circumſcribed. When the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal excluſioniſts came to pay their reſpects, they are ſaid to have been received with indifference, or treated with coldneſs. This might be ſuitable to the ſincerity which he affected to poſſeſs, but it ſcarce ſeemed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with prudence.

The late King had formed a reſolution to ſend the Earl of Clarendon, as lord-lieutenant, to Ireland, and to give the treaſurer's ſtaff to his brother, the Earl of Rocheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Sunderland, having obtained ſecret intelligence that the preſent King was determined to purſue the ſame meaſures, waited upon Rocheſter, who had been his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical enemy, and made the moſt artful advances to gain his friendſhip. He told him, that though it had been his misfortune to differ with him formerly, it was the effect of the times, and not his inclination. But that as he had ever the greateſt eſteem for his perſon, he would now endeavour to ſhow it, by uſing ſome ſecret intereſt which he poſſeſſed, that he might be made lord-treaſurer and his brother lord-lieutenant of Ireland.

He managed his revenue. He retrenched ſuperfluous expences. He was zealous for the glory of the nation. He endeavoured to expel vice from the court, and to reſtore decency and morality. He was himſelf at the head of all his affairs. He pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided daily at the council, at the boards of admiralty and treaſury. He even entered into the whole detail of the concerns of all the great departments of the ſtate. But his bigotry for the Romiſh faith, ſullied all his good qualities, and rendered him feared for his violence where he was not deſpiſed for his weakneſs. When he firſt mounted the throne, he declared himſelf a catholic; as if his ſincerity in avowing his principles could atone for his profeſſing a faith which his ſubjects abhorred. He went publicly to maſs with the Queen. He even had the imprudence to urge others to follow his example, and to adopt his religious opinions. This unaccountable weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels being once perceived, he became the dupe of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning men, by an uncommon ſpecies of flattery. To pretend to be converted by his arguments was to enſure his protection and favour. He received the ſuppoſed converts into his confidence. He gave them an abſolute dominion over his mind. In defiance of all remonſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he followed their advice, which at length terminated in his ruin<note n="F" place="bottom">Carte's Ormonde, vol. iii.</note>.</p>

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:0709200301:417"/>
the exchequer when he acceded to the throne, in ſpite of his management and oeconomy, threw him into dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties and diſtreſs. A remittance of the pitiful ſum of twenty-five thouſand pounds was a timely relief to his neceſſities<note n="G" place="bottom">Dalrymple's Append. 1685.</note>; and was received with joy. Though he was from principle no friend to the aggrandizement of Lewis the Fourteenth, he was afraid to offend that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch in the preſent ſtate of his affairs. In the Prince of Orange he already dreaded a formidable rival. He was no ſtranger to the views of his ambition. He was offended at the protection which he afforded to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth. As the intereſt of the Prince and the Duke could never be the ſame, the former was ſuſpected of encouraging troubles to his uncle, to derive advantage to himſelf from the confuſion. But as it was dangerous to break with the Prince, for fear of giving a formidable head to the malecontents in England, James, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding his boaſted ſincerity, was forced to diſſemble his fears. He ſpoke publicly of his reſolution of living in confidence with his nephew, and to form a political connection with the States of Holland. He affected to treat the King of France with a punctilious ſtatelineſs. When he ſent Lord Churchill to announce his brother's death to Lewis, he commanded him to obſerve with attention the ceremonies with which he was received. The ſame forms were obſerved with a ſcrupulous exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Mareſchal de Lorges, ſent with an anſwer to England by the court of France<note n="H" place="bottom">Kennet, Publications of the times.</note>.</p>

The late King, to whoſe firmneſs he owed his throne, was buried with little pomp; and his own coronation, on the twenty-third of April, was a cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony neither expenſive nor magnificent. His interfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in matters of little conſequence was deemed beneath the dignity of his ſtation.

his conduct, inſtead of meeting cenſure, might have merited applauſe. But it was not to that department alone that the King is ſaid to have confined himſelf. He is even ſuppoſed to have extended his influence to the adminiſtration of public juſtice. The ſevere proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two noted criminals was at this time aſcribed, with ſome juſtice, to his memory of former injuries. Otes, who had been virtually condemned to perpetual impriſonment in the preceding ſummer, by the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous fine of one hundred thouſand pounds, was tried on two indictments for perjury on the eighth of May. Though few entertained any doubt of his guilt, his pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment was deemed ſevere. He was adjudged to ſtand thrice in the pillory, to be twice whipped, to be impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned for life, and to ſtand five times in the pillory every year. Dangerfield, the author of the meal-tub-plot, received ſentence to ſtand twice in the pillory, to be whipped twice, and to pay a fine of five hundred pounds. The ſentence of each was executed with the utmoſt ſeverity. But though nothing could be deemed too hard for ſuch profligate men, the diſtance of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment from the crime rendered them objects of pity in the eyes of the world<note n="I" place="bottom">Publications of the times.</note>.</p>

Without debate, they returned their hearty thanks to the King for his moſt gracious ſpeech. Without one diſſenting voice, they reſolved that the revenue enjoyed by the late King ſhould be ſettled for life on his preſent Majeſty. Their ready compliance, however, muſt not be aſcribed altogether to timidity. Two rebellions threatened the kingdom; and the refuſal of a requeſt, deemed by the nation reaſonable, might in ſome meaſure juſtify the King for ſeeking in the prerogative the relief which parliament ſhould deny. But the complaiſance with which the ſeſſion began, continued to its end. The commons, upon receiving information of the deſcent of the Earl of Argyle in the weſt of Scotland, voted to ſupport the King, againſt all rebels and traitors, with their lives and fortunes. This pliant diſpoſition ſoothed the auſterity of James into mildneſs.

When the report was made to the houſe, a debate aroſe, whether they ſhould concur with the committee.

Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth met the Earl of Argyle at Rotterdam on the twenty-fourth of February, juſt four days after intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the late King's death was received. Having concerted the plan, they endeavoured to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves privately with the means of invaſion. The gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity of the Prince equalled not his profeſſed zeal for the ſervice of Monmouth. The unfortunate Duke de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from his own plate and jewels his whole treaſure for proſecuting the war. The enthuſiaſm of a rich widow ſupplied Argyle with ten thouſand pounds. He purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that ſum three veſſels, which he loaded with ammunition and arms. Monmouth, from his want of money, was more ſlow in his preparations. Though he correſponded with Bentinck, though Odyck, the other favourite of the Prince of Orange, was in the ſecret, leſs real aid than verbal encouragement came from that quarter. The refugees, in the mean time, repaired to Amſterdam. Skelton, who ſucceeded Chudleigh as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident from the court of England, was at length alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He applied to the States and the Prince of Orange to put an embargo on Argyle's veſſels, which ſtill lay in the Texel. The Prince amuſed Skelton for a whole day on an affair which required the utmoſt diſpatch<note n="S" place="bottom">D'Avaux.</note>. An order was at length obtained; but it was defeated by the Prince, in whoſe department, as admiral, the execution of it lay. Argyle, appriſed of his danger, put to ſea, and directed his courſe to Scotland, having obtained a promiſe from Monmouth to ſail for England in ten days.<note n="T" place="bottom">Ralph, Kennet, et Auct. citat. paſſim.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Affairs of Scotland.</note> But the authority of James was too firmly eſtabliſhed in Scotland to be ſhaken by the meditated deſcent of Argyle. Four days after his brother's death, he was proclaimed with great ſolemnity at Edinburgh, by the order of the privy-council. The King followed the ſame policy which he had found to be ſucceſsful in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. All officers were continued in their places.

which the Duke of Queenſberry preſided, as Lord High Commiſſioner. Principles of unlimited obedience to the power, and even the deſpotiſm of the crown, were expreſſed in the anſwer of the parliament to the letter of the King. They ſignified their abhorrence of the authors of paſt rebellions and conſpiracies. They diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed all poſitions derogatory to the King's ſacred, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme, ſovereign, abſolute power. They recognized their former act and declaration, which, to uſe their own words, aſſerted the juſt and legal ſucceſſion of the SACRED LINE, as unalterable by any human juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Invaſion.</note> James, appriſed of an intended invaſion from Holland under Argyle, had given orders to the privy-council in Scotland to put the kingdom in a poſture of defence. A proclamation was iſſued, on the firſt day of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>int of parliament, commanding all the militia of the eaſtern counties, and all able to bear arms in the north, to keep themſelves in readineſs to take the field. The Marquis of Athol was conſtituted lord-lieutenant of the county of Argyle; being deemed, from an hereditary feud, the moſt proper perſon to oppoſe the Earl in the territories of his retainers and friends. Argyle, having ſailed from the Vly on the ſecond of May, was ſoon carried to the coaſt of Scotland by favourable winds. Having landed in the iſland of Mull with his friends, ſhe paſſed from thence to Kintyre and his other eſtates. Some of his former vaſſals by inclination, and ſeveral, through terror, joined his ſtandard; and he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in a few days, at the head of two thouſand men. He publiſhed two declarations; one in the name of his adherents, and another in his own. The grievances of the nation were enumerated in the firſt with ſome juſtice, though exaggerated. In the ſecond, the Earl explained his own preſent views, and the injuſtice of his paſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. He declared againſt the right of the Duke of York to the throne, as being excluded from the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the commons of England. He avowedly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0709200301:426"/>
all bonds of ſubjection to his authority. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared hoſtilities againſt him and his adherents. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed never to enter into any treaty or capitulation with the preſent government. He affirmed, that the unalter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able deſign of himſelf and his party was to reſtore and ſettle the Proteſtant religion, to ſuppreſs and perpetually exclude Popery, and its bitter root and ſpring, prelacy; to indemnify all thoſe who had ſuffered for their adherence to their liberties and religion<note n="X" place="bottom">Journals of the commons.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">defeat,</note> But neither the fortune nor the conduct of Argyle were anſwerable to the ſpirit and pomp of his declarations. Oppoſed in his councils by his friends, ſurrounded by a rabble unaccuſtomed to authority and unacquainted with war, he loitered in Kintyre, when he ought to have rouſed the ſpirit of his adherents by action. The vigour of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was equal to the negligence of the rebels. Two men of war took, with little reſiſtance, the ſhips of Argyle. They ſeized the caſtle of Ellingreg, where he had depoſited his arms. The Marquis of Athol had entered his country with a ſuperior force of militia. The Earl of Dumbarton, with the regular troops, advanced upon him with haſty march. The Lord Charles Murray hovered on his right with three troops of dragoons. The Duke of Gordon, with another body, hung cloſe on his left. Reduced to difficulties in his mountains, he endeavoured to force hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

The Earl endeavoured to ſhoot him; but his piſtol miſſed fire. The country-man gave him a blow on the head. He fell, and, by an excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of grief, betrayed his quality and his name. He was firſt carried to Glaſcow, then conveyed to Edinburgh, with every mark of ignominy and diſgrace. His hands were bound behind; his head was bare. The executioner walked before him with an ax. Having been urged in vain to confeſs, he was beheaded, after a few days, upon his former ſentence. He ſuffered with that calmneſs and ſerenity which attend men of courage in the laſt extreme. Rumbold, the maſter of the Rye-houſe, and Ayloffe the lawyer were the only perſons of the Engliſh, fugitives who followed the fortunes of Argyle. The firſt, after a ſtout reſiſtance, was taken and hanged. The latter endeavoured to diſappoint his enemies, by ſtabbing himſelf. He, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, recovered of his wounds. He was carried to London, in hopes of making diſcoveries; but being of a ſullen and obſtinate temper, he treated ill the King himſelf, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered with his friends. The inſurrection in Scotland was quelled with little bloodſhed. Very few fell in the field. The moſt of the followers of Argyle, by diſperſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, eſcaped. Thoſe who fell into the hands of the government were pardoned and diſmiſſed.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Expedition of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</note> The Duke of Monmouth, in conſequence of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to Argyle, left Amſterdam, on the twenty-fourth of May, in a ſmall ſhallop, and directed his courſe to the mouth of the Texel, where his ſhips lay at anchor. His whole fleet conſiſted of a frigate of thirty-two guns and two tenders, the largeſt of which was ſcarce more than one hundred tons in burden. Obſtructed by contrary winds, he was five days on his way to his friends; and when he arrived, he found his frigate under an arreſt by the States. But the Prince of Orange was admiral; and he knew that, to pleaſe him, he ought to break through his commands. On the thirtieth he weighed, and ſtood to ſea, in the midſt of a ſtorm. The wind continued in his teeth during his whole paſſage. The attention of Holland and the anxiety of England were raiſed by his voyage, which laſted ten days. The miniſters at the Hague<note n="Z" place="bottom">D'Avaux.</note> prayed for Monmouth, under the borrowed title

But the inſufficiency of the ſuccours which he afforded to the unfortunate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader, proved that he wiſhed more for diſturbances in England, than for his ſucceſs. He is, however, ſaid to have kept up a correſpondence with the Duke, through his favourites, till he delcared himſelf King<note n="A" place="bottom">D'Avaux, vol. iii.</note>. The great object of the Prince of Orange was, to render himſelf ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the King of England<note n="B" place="bottom">Ibid.,</note>, through the progreſs of Monmouth.

and a vain ſuppoſition of his legitimacy, ſoon formed round him the ſhew of an army. But no perſon of rank joined his ſtandard. They knew his limited abilities. They were no ſtrangers to his total want of reſources. Beſides, the vigilance of government had already armed againſt him the militia of the neighbouring counties. The Duke's firſt act of hoſtility was the ſtorming of Bridport, into which the Duke of Albemarle had thrown a part of the militia of Devon. The men diſplayed a ſpirit upon the occaſion which was not anſwered by their leaders. The Lord Grey, who commanded the horſe, deſerted his own troops. He rode back to Lime, and brought the news of a defeat, when his party obtained a victory. The cowardice of Grey was ſucceeded by a paſſionate action of Fletcher of Salton, equally detrimental to the affairs of Monmouth. Fletcher, who was to have been joined in the command of the horſe with Grey, ſhot a country-man, by whom he had been inſulted. The people, in a tumultuous manner demanded his immediate diſmiſſion; and Monmouth was obliged to deprive himſelf of the aid of the only man in his train who was equal to his dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enterprize<note n="G" place="bottom">Ralph, Kennet, et Auct. citat</note>.</p>

His guide loſt his way, and carried him to a part of the camp where a regiment of Scots under the Earl of Dumbarton lay. Theſe, being old ſoldiers, though left without their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, had not forgot that an enemy was near. One hundred men ſtood upon the watch, while the reſt lay aſleep on their arms. It was now one of the clock in the morning; and though the moon was full, a thick miſt deprived alike the attacked and aſſailants of light. The Scots were firſt alarmed by the rattling of the enemy's arms. They ſuſtained the ſhock of Monmouth, while the reſt of the army formed themſelves in the rear. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth's foot diſputed the battle with the utmoſt courage and vivacity; but his horſe, under Lord Grey, conſiſting of marſh-mares and colts, could not ſtand the noiſe of drums and guns. They quitted the field, without firing a ſhot. Monmouth, with the foot, ſtill maintained the battle with ardour. The biſhop of Bath and Wells, who was then in the royal camp, contributed to decide the fate of the fight. By the help of his coach-horſes, he brought ſome field-pieces to bear on the flank of the enemy, while a party of horſe, under Oglethorpe, fell on their rear.

The few who had attended the Duke gradually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted him in his flight. In the company of a German count, who came to ſhare his fortune, he continued his courſe toward the county of Dorſet, till his horſe failed him through fatigue. Having wandered for ſome time on foot, they ſeparated, and the German was taken. The whole country, to gain the reward, were employed in the ſearch of Monmouth. He was, at length, found in a ditch, covered with fern, with ſome green peas in his pocket, which had been his only ſuſtenance for ſome days. Broken by deſpair, and languid from hunger and want of reſt, he fainted in the hands of his enemies; and exhibited, in his behaviour as much as in his fortune, the laſt ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of human miſery. On his way, by ſlow journeys, in London, he wrote a ſubmiſſive letter to the King, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing

diſcoveries, ſhould he be admitted into his preſence. The curioſity of James being excited by the letter, he ſent Sheldon, a gentleman of his bed chamber, to meet Monmouth. In his converſation with Sheldon, he aſked, who was in chief confidence with the King? He was anſwered Sunderland. Monmouth knocked his breaſt in a ſurpriſe, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Why then, as I hope for ſalvation, he promiſed to meet ME."</q> He deſired Sheldon to inform the King, that ſeveral of his accomplices in rebellion were in the confidence of his Majeſty<note n="K" place="bottom">James II. 1685.</note>; and he gave him a particular account of the part which the Prince of Orange had acted in this whole affair.</p>

James told him he might ſay any thing before THAT Lord. Sheldon was in great perplexity; but being urged, he told all that Monmouth had averred.

When he ſaw Monmouth's letter to James, and heard the diſcoveries he had made to Sheldon, he is ſaid to have adviſed him, that as he could aſſure him of the certainty of a pardon, he ought to deny what he had ſaid in prejudice of his friends, who could ſerve him on ſome other more favourable occaſion<note n="L" place="bottom">James II.</note>. The credulous Duke, ſwayed by the advice of Sunderland, ſuppreſſed what he had ſaid to Sheldon, when he was examined by the King. He mentioned nothing of the concern which the Prince of Orange had taken in the invaſion, though a point on which James was already ſufficiently informed. D'Avaux, the French miniſter to the States, had given a circumſtantial account of the whole conduct of the Prince to Lewis the Fourteenth, who had ordered it to be pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately communicated to the King of England. Bentinck, who had been ſent to congratulate James on the ſuppreſſion

He wrote to the Queen-dowager; he ſent a letter to the reigning Queen, as well as to the King himſelf. He begged his life, when he was admitted into the preſence, with a meanneſs unſuitable to his pretenſions and high rank. He conjured him not to ſhed his own blood in that of a brother's child. This latter conſideration, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the opinion which James had always entertained concerning the birth of Monmouth, could have uo weight<note n="N" place="bottom">Ibid. 1669.</note>. Beſides, reſentment for the Duke's inſincerity had been joined with the fears of the King of his future ſchemes of ambition. He therefore told him, that he was much affected at his misfortunes, but that his crime was too dangerous in its example to be left unpuniſhed. In his laſt moments the Duke of Monmouth behaved himſelf with a magnanimity more worthy of his former courage. He, however, appears to have been an enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt, though in an extraordinary way. He refuſed to the biſhops who attended him at his death to own the legality of his marriage with the Ducheſs; aſſerting, that Mrs. Wentworth was his only wife, in the ſight of God. When he came to the ſcaffold, he behaved with decency, and even with dignity. He ſpoke little. He made no confeſſion. He accuſed none of his friends. Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are ſaid to have attended his death that created a horror among the ſpectators. The executioner, unmanned by terror, or touched with pity, miſſed his blow, and ſtruck him ſlightly on the ſhoulder. Monmouth raiſed his head from the block, and looked him full in the face, as if reproaching him for his miſtake. He ſtruck him twice again, but with feeble ſtrokes; and then threw the ax from his hands. The ſheriff forced him to renew his attempt; and the head of the Duke, who ſeemed already dead, was ſevered at laſt from his body<note n="O" place="bottom">Tenniſon in Kennet.</note>.</p>

to a height too great for his limited capacity and underſtanding. His good-nature, the gentleneſs, and even the humanity of his diſpoſition, ſeemed to render him worthy of a better fate. But theſe feeble virtues, which might have adorned a private life, were the ſource of all the misfortunes of Monmouth. The eaſineſs which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him popular ſubjected him to the ſchemes of deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, and at laſt involved him in difficulties, which conſummate abilities could only ſurmount. Though, among thoſe who knew him beſt, there remained little regret for his death, the affection of the vulgar followed him beyond the grave. They fondly believed, that their beloved Monmouth was ſtill to head them in the field; and that a perſon, warmed with the ſame paſſion with themſelves, ſubmitted his neck to the ax in his ſtead. Few of thoſe who accompanied him from Holland ſuffered death with their unfortunate leader. The Lord Grey, by a full confeſſion of the Rye-houſe plot, obtained his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, as to life. Even the noted Ferguſon, though taken among the reſt, by an inſtance of clemency ſtrange for the times, was diſmiſſed without puniſhment<note n="P" place="bottom">Publications of the times.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Severity of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſte,</note> The royaliſts purſued their victory over the adherents of Monmouth with that violent ſeverity which too often attends ſucceſs in a civil war. When independent ſtates contend with one another in arms, men only encounter enemies in the field; but when inſurgents fail in their attempts againſt a government, they are conſidered traitors, as well as foes. Juſtice then becomes an engine of paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The laws are wreſted for the purpoſe of revenge; and even the body of the people look upon cruelty and puniſhment with an indifference proportioned to their former fears. Every age, and almoſt every nation, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſhameful examples of this kind. The annals of la ter times are covered with blood, as well as thoſe of former years; though the miſconduct, and even the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, of an expelled race of monarchs, have called forth their proceeding in a more hideous form. When the ſoldiers were, in ſome meaſure, fatigued with ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter after the battle of Sedgmoor, their general, the Earl of Feverſham, began, without any form of juſtice, to put the inſurgents to death by the hands of the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner. He ordered five perſons to be hanged on the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:0709200301:435"/>
firſt great ſign-poſt that ſtood acroſs the road beyond the field of battle. But this inſtance of illegal ſeverity yielded to the ſuperior inhumanity of Colonel Kirk, who, upon his entry into Bridgewater, exerciſed upon nineteen in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgents the ſame ſummary puniſhment<note n="P" place="bottom">Hiſtories of the times.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">of Kirk</note> The military executions of Kirk were attended with circumſtances of wanton cruelty and barbarity. The horror raiſed by his conduct induced mankind to exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate his ſeverities, and to apply to him ſome frightful ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannies related of former times. Though the barbarity of his own diſpoſition<note n="Q" place="bottom">James II. 1685.</note>, and the ſavage thirſt of blood which too frequently follows victory, ought, perhaps, to be only blamed on the preſent occaſion, James certainly ſhould have afterwards puniſhed a conduct of which he greatly diſapproved<note n="R" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. But the inhumanities of Kirk were ſoon after eclipſed by the rigour of Jefferys, who came to glean up with the law the wretched remains of the ſword. A ſpecial commiſſion of oyer and terminer was iſſued to Jefferys, together with the lord chief baron of the exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and three puiſne judges, to try the rebels already conſined in the weſt. To balance the known vehemence of Jefferys, the King ſays, that he appointed Polexfen, who had been always remarkable for his attachment to the Preſbyterian party, as ſolicitor for the crown on this bloody circuit<note n="S" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. In the end of Auguſt, the five judges ſet out on their expedition, and carried with them terror every where. They opened firſt their commiſſion at Wincheſter. They proceeded from thence to Dorcheſter, Exeter, Taunton and Wells. Five hundred priſoners were tried and condemned, in all. More than two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred were executed; and the reſt were either tranſported, or permitted to purchaſe, as was ſaid, their pardon of the chief juſtice<note n="T" place="bottom">Burnet, Kennet, Ralph.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">and Jefferys.</note> Though the ſtrict line of law might be followed, tho' ſufficient proofs of the concern of the priſoners in the inſurrection appeared, the conduct of Jefferys was through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out brutal, arbitrary and ſavage. In one inſtance he ſeems to have added a manifeſt perverſion of the moſt obvious rules of juſtice to the fierce inhumanity of his own diſpoſition. The Lady Lyle, as ſhe was commonly called, the widow of one of the regicides, whom Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:0709200301:436"/>
had called to his houſe of peers, was indicted at Wincheſter for harbouring Hicks and Nelthorp, who had been concerned in Monmouth's inſurrection. No proof was given that ſhe was privy to the circumſtance that either of theſe men had ſerved the unfortunate Duke at Sedgemoor<note n="U" place="bottom">James II. 1685.</note>. Hicks ſhe received as a non-conformiſt miniſter; and it did not appear that ſhew knew either the name or crime of Nelthorp. Her ſex, her age, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent ſincerity, and even the ſimplicity of her conduct and defence, wrought much on the jury in her favour. They twice ſhewed an inclination to declare her innocent, but they were brow-beat by Jefferys, and brought her in guilty. Applications for her pardon ſeem never to have been made to the King<note n="X" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, though that circumſtance has been mentioned by moſt writers. The utmoſt that could be obtained from Jefferys, who was armed with all the powers of life and death, on this occaſion, was the chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her ſentence from hanging to beheading: A ſtrange favour from ſuch a violent royaliſt, as it, in ſome meaſure, annexed the privilege of nobility to the lords created by Cromwell<note n="Y" place="bottom">Hiſt. of the times</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Not counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanced by the King.</note> Notwithſtanding the rigour generally aſcribed to the government of James, there is great reaſon to believe that the chief juſtice followed more the bent of his own mind, than the commands of his ſovereign, in his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour in the Weſt. The terror of others for Jefferys's power prevented any impartial account to come to the ears of the King. In one inſtance, he added an inſult to James himſelf to his own injuſtice. The King, ſtruck with the years, manner, and apparent honeſty of a Major Holmes, who had been concerned in the Rye-houſe plot, and privy to the late inſurrection, promiſed him a free pardon. As Holmes was well acquainted with the merits and demerits of the ſeveral priſoners, he was inſtructed by James<note n="Z" place="bottom">James II. 1685.</note> to go to Jefferys on his circuit, to inform him of the moſt criminal, and to point out ſuch as deſerved mercy<note n="A" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. But Jefferys, finding that Holmes interfered with his own appetite for blood, brought him, without any regard to the King's promiſed pardon, to his trial, and hanged him with the reſt. This, as well as a great part of the other inormities of Jefferys, was long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed

from the King.

He even aſcribes their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities, in ſome degree, to a formed deſign of rendering his government odious to his ſubjects<note n="D" place="bottom">James II. 1685:</note>.</p>

Inſtead of recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf to his people, by diſapproving of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities of the chief juſtice, he became, in ſome meaſure, a party in his crimes, by raiſing him to the office of Lord High Chancellor upon his return. This Prince, in the moſt favourable view of his character, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſacrificed his prudence to his violent principles of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.

The King, in his ſpeech, avowed his principles ſo openly, that no doubt could remain concerning his future deſigns. He told the two houſes, that the progreſs made by an inconſiderable number of men in the late rebellion, proved that the militia, in which the nation truſted, were not ſufficient for ſuch occaſions. That conſideration, he informed them, had induced him to increaſe the ſtanding troops to double their former number; and to ſupport ſuch a body of men for the ſafety of the people, he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſupply from his parliament. He acquainted them that there were ſome officers in the army not quite qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified according to the late teſts. But he told them, that moſt of thoſe gentlemen were well known to HIM; that he had employed them with advantage in the time of need and danger; and that he would neither expoſe them to diſgrace, nor himſelf to the want of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. He expreſſed his apprehenſions, that ſome men expected to ſee a difference between him and his parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon that point: but that he entertained no fears upon that head, conſidering the advantages which, in the ſpace of a few months, had riſen to the nation from a good underſtanding. He repreſented, as the conſequence of their unanimity at home, the great change wrought on the face of affairs abroad, ſo much to the honour of the kingdom, and the figure it ought to make in the world. He apprehended not, he ſaid, for his own part, ſuch a misfortune as a diviſion, or even a coldneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and his parliament. He aſſured them, that as he entertained no doubts of their ſteadineſs and loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty, he would make them every return of kindneſs and affection, with a reſolution to venture even his life in defence of the true intereſt of the kingdom<note n="K" place="bottom">Journals of the commons, Nov. 9, 1685.</note>.</p>

their houſe, and a profound ſilence prevailed. A motion was made to conſider of his Majeſty's ſpeech on the 12th of November; and the houſe adjourned to that day.—When they met again, the ſame cautious ſilence was for ſome time obſerved. Swayed by their principles of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, yet afraid of the total diſſolution of the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, they were perplexed with doubts and embarraſſed with difficulties. They dreaded a ſtanding army: but they were ſtill more afraid of popery, the introduction of which was manifeſtly facilitated by the King's avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed breach on the late teſts. They, however, were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to proceed with caution. They knew the obſtinate character of James. They were no ſtrangers to their having already placed him, by an ample revenue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their own power. The majority, therefore, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed inclined to peaceable meaſures; and though they would not approve of the dangerous meaſures of the court, they ſeemed reſolved to give as little offence as poſſible to the King.

His anſwer was uncomplying and ſupercilious. He even ſpoke it with an ill-ſuppreſſed paſſion, though he aſſumed that air of complacent ſtatelineſs, which, by uſe, had ceaſed in him to be affected. <q rend="inline">"He did not expect,"</q> he told them, <q rend="inline">"ſuch an addreſs from the commons."</q> He had recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them, he ſaid, to conſider the advantages which had reſulted from a good underſtanding; and he had warned them againſt jealouſies and fears.

But in whatever manner they ſhould proceed on their ſide, he aſſured them, that on his part, he would be juſt to his word, in his preſent ſpeech as well as in his former promiſes to his parliament. A profound ſilence followed the reading of this anſwer.—The houſe was perplexed with doubts, and knew not how to proceed. A motion was at length made, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a day for conſidering his Majeſty's anſwer; and the next Friday was named.

His words were taken down. He was ſent to the bar, reprimand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and committed to the Tower. This incident ſtifled the motion.

<pb n="418" facs="tcp:0709200301:442"/>
already given general thanks to his Majeſty, Compton, Biſhop of London, made a motion to appoint a day for conſidering the ſpeech. When the buſineſs came to a debate, the King himſelf, according to cuſtom, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. Great freedom, however, was uſed with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent meaſures. The danger of diſpenſing with the teſt was painted in lively colours. The houſe was impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with terrors of Popery; and more were willing to eſtabliſh new defences againſt that religion, than to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit any encroachments upon the old. Halifax, lately diſmiſſed from the councils of James, oppoſed with abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity the meaſures of the court. Jefferys endeavoured to ſupport them in vain. His ſpeech was received with contempt where it was not heard with indignation.—The motion for conſidering the ſpeech was carried; and the twenty-third of November was appointed for that purpoſe. This point was more important than it ſeemed at the firſt view. Had the lords remained as paſſive as the commons, a ſtanding army would have been virtually eſtabliſhed by the authority of the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature; and the diſpenſing power would have remained in fact with the crown, by the connivance of the two houſes. James being determined to yield in nothing, was reſolved to avoid the mortification of hearing more cenſures upon his conduct. He ſacrificed the ſupply in a manner to his pride; and, on the twentieth of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, ſuddenly prorogued the parliament.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Several cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals of diſtinction pardoned.</note> The rigour of proſecutions abated with the paſſions of the people. The Earl of Stamford and the Lord De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamere had lain, ſince the laſt week of July, under an accuſation of treaſon, in the Tower. They petitioned the peers, when the parliament met, to be releaſed from their confinement. An indictment had been found in the city of London againſt the Earl of Stamford, which the lords ordered to be removed into their own houſe; and the firſt of December was appointed for his trial. The treaſon charged on the Lord Delamere had been committed in Cheſhire; and that being a county pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, the indictment ought to have been found there, and not in the King's-Bench. A commiſſion of Oyer and Terminer was accordingly iſſued: but before either of the accuſed lords were brought to trial, the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was prorogued. Stamford was ſoon after admitt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to bail, and pardoned. Delamere was acquitted by
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:0709200301:443"/>
his peers. The ſecond proſecution of Hampden was an inſtance of lenity. He had been fined forty thouſand pounds, and had continued, in default of payment, in priſon. He was brought to trial<note n="R" place="bottom">Dec. 30.</note>, he pleaded guilty, and was condemned: but he received a pardon for his life, and a remiſſion of his fine.

                  <note place="margin">King's kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fugees.</note> The lenity of James to thoſe criminals of diſtinction was accompanied with another act of ſignal humanity. The enthuſiaſm of Lewis the Fourteenth had induced him to revoke the edict of Nantz, which had ſecured, ever ſince the time of Henry the Fourth the Proteſtants of France in the exerciſe of their religion. The mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure was at once very arbitrary and extremely impoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic. The edict had been ever deemed irrevocable; and ſcarce any inconvenience had ariſen, for near a century, from the privileges enjoyed by the Proteſtants. The obſtinacy of thoſe religioniſts, as is uſual, roſe in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſeverity with which they were perſecuted. Five hundred thouſand ſouls preferred their liberty of conſcience to their country. They quitted France with a great part of its wealth; and carried the arts and manufactures, which had enriched that kingdom, to all the corners of Europe. More than fifty thouſand of the fugitives came to England. James openly blamed Lewis. He aided with money the refugees. He protected them with his power, and admitted them, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, to the privileges of his Engliſh ſubjects<note n="U" place="bottom">Hiſt. of the Times. MSS. James II.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous views.</note> The kindneſs of James to the French fugitives was aſcribed more to his religious views than to either his policy or humanity. In his paſſionate affection for Popery, he had reſolved, at the riſk of his crown, to favour the Roman catholics; and, if not to eſtabliſh ultimately their religion in his kingdom, to give them preſent eaſe. His plan for executing this purpoſe was the more dangerous, as it was to be carried forward through the line of a general toleration, which, one would think, the common ſenſe of mankind ought to have eſtabliſhed in every country. But a Prince of his bigotry neither received
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0709200301:444"/>
nor deſerved credit for an affected moderation in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual affairs. By precipitating his deſigns, they became too ſoon obvious to the world; and they were dreaded, oppoſed, and defeated. Though he profeſſed that he only carried his views to a freedom of conſcience to all his ſubjects, it was manifeſt, that by virtually diſpenſing with the teſt, he meant to fill gradually every department with perſons of his own favourite ſyſtem of faith.—The propenſity of mankind to intereſt, he knew, would gain proſelytes, a race of men of whom this deluded prince was extremely fond; and thus, he deemed, that without any violence, the Romiſh faith would, by degrees, become firſt the religion of the court, and then ſpread itſelf to the nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Affairs of</note> In England, however, the King had hitherto obſerved a degree of caution and prudence. He was leſs reſerved in Ireland, where the majority of the people were already attached to the Romiſh faith. In the autumn of 1684, the late King, either ſwayed by the counſels of the Duke of York, or having adopted of himſelf ſome new ſyſtem of policy, not perfectly known, had reſolved to remove the Duke of Ormonde, and to place the government of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in other hands. In the month of December, the Earl of Rocheſter was nominated to that high office; but, before he made any preparations for his journey, the death of the King altered his views. James, upon his acceſſion to the throne, adopted his brother's ſcheme for the removal of Ormonde; and that Duke, having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned the ſword of ſtate to the Archbiſhop of Armagh and the Earl of Granard, as lords-juſtices, arrived in London on the thirty-firſt of March. The tranquillity of Ireland continued when a double rebellion diſturbed the repoſe of the two Britiſh kingdoms. Though the acceſſion of a popiſh King had raiſed the hopes of the catholics, and excited the fears of the proteſtants, their animoſities extended no further than futile informations againſt the loyalty of each other; complaints, which the lords-juſtices had the prudence to diſregard<note n="U" place="bottom">Carte's Ormonde, Leland, Memoirs of Ireland.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Ireland.</note> Upon the ſuppreſſion of Monmouth's inſurrection in England, James, under a pretence that the contagion of rebellion had ſpread to Ireland, ordered the lords-juſtices
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:0709200301:445"/>
to recal the arms of the militia, and to depoſit them in different ſtores. The militia, conſiſting wholly of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, received this order for reſigning their arms with a degree of conſternation proportionable to their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual fears of the popiſh Iriſh. The commands of the King were, however, obeyed without any apparent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance. The government of the nation ſtill remained entirely in the hands of proteſtants; and the change with regard to the Iriſh Papiſts conſiſted hitherto in their hopes of indulgence and favour from a popiſh King. A general ferment prevailed. But it aroſe more from the fluctuating paſſions of the two ſects than from any actual diſturbance. In this ſituation of affairs, a new lord-lieutenant, the Earl of Clarendon, arrived in Ireland. The affinity of this lord with the King, and his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in favour of the prerogative, were deemed favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able circumſtances for carrying into execution the new plan of Iriſh affairs<note n="X" place="bottom">Clarendon's Letters.</note>. James truſted him only partially with his deſigns. He ſignified his inclination, that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics might be admitted into corporations, and be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered capable of acting in the character of magiſtrates, and in a judicial capacity. Clarendon, however, was commanded to aſſure the proteſtants, that his Majeſty was reſolved to adhere ſtrictly to the acts of ſettlement.

Mercenary in an uncommon degree, he bartered his abilities to the moſt oppoſite parties for gain. At once the penſioner of the Prince of Orange and of the King of France<note n="Z" place="bottom">James II. 1686.</note>, he ſacrificed his deluded maſter and his country to the reſpective views of theſe Princes. He paved the way for the firſt to the throne of England, by leading James into favourite errors; and he opened a door to the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious deſigns of the latter, by depriving England, with his councils, of her juſt weight in the ſcale of Europe.</p>

A ſecret Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh cabinet.</note> In the proſecution of his plan to ruin James, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced his infatuated maſter to eſtabliſh, in the beginning of the preſent year, a ſecret council of Roman catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics, to conſult of matters of religion. This bigotted Prince embraced with gladneſs a propoſal ſo favourable to his own ſuperſtitious views. The council conſiſted of the Earl of Powis, the Lords Arundel, Bellaſis, Dover, and Caſtlemain, together with Father Petre, a plauſible, but a weak, ignorant, and talkative man<note n="A" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Sunderland extolled his abilities to the King; and, contrary to that Prince's judgment, and even the advice of the Queen, obtained for him the dignity of a privy-counſellor, tho' he was not, till long after, ſworn at the board<note n="B" place="bottom">In Nov. 1687.</note>.

drop his religious deſigns. With a folly ſcarce conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with common ſenſe, he even hoped to induce the majority of parliament to agree to the repeal of the teſt. He applied in perſon to the moſt hoſtile members. He tried to gain by careſſes what they had denied to his ſrowns. He endeavoured in vain to convince them, that he only wiſhed to procure a general toleration to his people in matters of conſcience. They knew his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality for popery; and they reſolved never to yield to a meaſure which would inevitably fill the firſt offices in the kingdom with men profeſſing the Romiſh faith. They ſaw, that by placing the whole power of the ſtate in ſuch hands, no further defence ſhould remain for the eſtabliſhed religion, or the inherent liberties of the Engliſh nation.

But he found by the event, that thoſe who reſigned their political freedom with ſo much indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, were not to be perſuaded to endanger the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant faith. The Earl of Moray, a new convert to Popery, was appointed high-commiſſioner to the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which was opened on the twenty-ninth of April, at Edinburgh. The King, in his letter, demanded, in the moſt ſoothing terms, ſome indulgence for the Roman Catholics from the ſeverity of the penal laws. The commiſſioner ſupported this requeſt with propoſals of advantage to the Scotiſh nation. To induce the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament to comply, he promiſed, in the name of the King, that he would recover the poſſeſſion of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges

of the merchants in France, redreſs their trouble with regard to the ſtaple and trade with the Nether<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and remove the grievance which aroſe from the importation of Iriſh cattle. He promiſed to grant them a mint, to demand no immediate ſupplies, to give his aſſent to all ſuch laws as tended to ſecure an exact pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from all military men in their quarters. He aſſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, that the King would paſs an ample indemnity, with ſome neceſſary exceptions, for all paſt miſdemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and crimes<note n="F" place="bottom">Gazette, No. 2135.</note>. Theſe promiſes, however, produced not the deſired effect. The parliament ſhewed no incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to repeal any of the penal laws. They were therefore prorogued by the commiſſioner, and ſoon after diſſolved by the King<note n="G" place="bottom">Woodrow, Burnet.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">June. Caſe of Sir Edward Hales.</note> His diſappointment in Scotland deterred not James from purſuing his deſigns in England. Having prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the judges for his purpoſe, he reſolved to ſupport his prerogative of diſpenſing with the penal ſtatutes againſt ſectaries, with the authority of Weſtminſter-hall. An opportunity was found by the King himſelf to bring the matter to an explicit deciſion. Sir Edward Hales, a man of fortune and family in Kent, but an open and profeſſed Papiſt, had accepted of the command of a regiment, and exerciſed his function without taking the teſt. His coachman informed againſt him, and claimed the five hundred pounds. Hales was accordingly indicted, at the aſſizes held at Rocheſter<note n="H" place="bottom">March 29.</note>, and duly convicted. But he produced the King's diſpenſation with his non-conformity, remitting all the penalties and diſabilities which he had incurred by the ſtatute. The plaintiff brought his ſuit into the King's Bench, as an action of debt; and Sir Edward Herbert, the lord chief juſtice, upon the iſſue, declared, <q rend="inline">"that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing whatever with which the King, as ſupreme law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, might not diſpenſe<note n="I" place="bottom">June 21.</note>."</q> The matter, however, was laid before the twelve judges; and the lord chief juſtice, on the twenty-firſt of June, publicly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in Weſtminſter-hall, that eleven out of the twelve adhered, upon various grounds, to his deciſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing power</note> Though this deciſion ſeemed to lay the law in ruins at the foot of the throne, it was neither unprecedented nor <pb n="425" facs="tcp:0709200301:449"/>
illegal, as the conſtitution was then defined. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing power, though underſtood as confined in its ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, had been of great antiquity in the Engliſh go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Penal ſtatutes, eſpecially as they were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally intended to arm the King with authority, were deemed, in ſome meaſure, to be the property of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and ſubject to his controul. The parliament itſelf had often recognized this power in the crown. The commons, who had forced from Charles the Firſt the petition of right, owned the diſpenſing power in all its plenitude. Coke himſelf, whoſe authority is ſo high, believed the power of ſuſpending laws ſo much inherent in the crown, that it even cannot be aboliſhed by an act of parliament. Neither was the practice of taking the judgment of the courts of law upon the diſpenſing power any novelty in the conſtitution of England. The judges declared, in the reign of Henry the Seventh, that the King could diſpenſe with a ſtatute containing a clauſe expreſsly precluding him from that prerogative. In the reign of James the Firſt, the judges confirmed the ſame doctrine; and the opinion had been, ever ſince that period, received as undoubted law<note n="K" place="bottom">Herbert's Vindication.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">recognized by the judges.</note> But neither theſe high authorities nor the precedents of ages were ſufficient to juſtify a practice ſubverſive of that confidence in their permanency which ſeems neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the very being of laws. Men could ſcarce diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh the diſpenſing prerogative from a repealing power in the crown. They juſtly deemed it unreaſonable that a leſs authority ſhould deſtroy than that which was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make laws. Beſides, though the power of diſpenſing with the penal ſtatutes might have been, for prudent ends, lodged in the crown, it was at firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to be limited to caſes where the King alone was concerned. Though the crown had, in late times, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended this prerogative to matters of public concern, the utility of the meaſure could only render it excuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able<note n="L" place="bottom">Atkins's Reply.</note>. In the preſent caſe, the matter was extremely different. The penal ſtatutes againſt the Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics had been framed to exclude, from offices in the ſtate, men whoſe principles, in policy as well as religion, were deemed by the body of the people extremely dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.

The King himſelf was open in his attachment to that ſect. His deſigns of introducing by degrees the faith which he profeſſed, were no longer a ſecret; and it is no matter of wonder, that the nation began now to queſtion a prerogative, which had been exerciſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out oppoſition by leſs ſuſpected Princes. The diſpenſing power was one of thoſe capital defects in the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which were removed by the bill of rights at the Revolution<note n="M" place="bottom">Firſt of W. and M. ſtat. 2. c. 2.</note>.

James pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly favours the Papiſts.</note> The deciſion of the judges in favour of the diſpenſing power, induced James to countenance more openly his religious friends. The Earl of Powis, the Lords Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del, Bellaſis and Dover, who already managed in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the affairs of the nation, in conjunction with Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland, were received publicly at the council-board. The King himſelf, who before went to hear maſs with the Queen, now appropriated the chapel at St. James's to the Romiſh ſervice. He even ſettled fourteen monks at St. James's. He permitted the Jeſuits to erect a chapel in the Savoy. Theſe religioniſts were even encouraged to form a college at the ſame place for the education of children, where two hundred were admitted in the ſpace of a few weeks. The Recollects built a chapel in Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coln's-Inn-Fields. The Carmelites formed a ſeminary in the city. In different parts of the country, places of public worſhip were raiſed by the Papiſts. The reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious of that ſect appeared publicly in the habits of their reſpective orders<note n="N" place="bottom">James II. 1686, paſſin</note>. The apoſtolical enthuſiaſm of the King diveſted his conduct of all prudence. He appeared to glory in his folly, and to place his happineſs in every meaſure that ſeemed obviouſly to haſten his ruin.

of the King to the profeſſors of another ſyſtem of faith, was now too obvious to be borne by the eſtabliſhed clergy, without jealouſy of their rivals, and fears for themſelves. The preſs laboured with polemical argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt Popery. The pulpits reſounded with Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant zeal. To ſubdue by force a church whoſe favour he might have retained with little addreſs, James had iſſued in the month of April, a high commiſſion, for the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and puniſhment of what was to be called the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct of individuals in eccleſiaſtical affairs. A court of eccleſiaſtical commiſſion, by carrying its power into acts of tyranny, was one of the moſt ſerious grievances in the reign of the firſt Charles. In the year 1642, it was for ever aboliſhed, by an expreſs act of parliament; but that act was amended and garbled by another ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, in the zeal for prelacy which prevailed at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoration. The clauſe which regarded the court of high commiſſion was the only part of the act which was not repealed. But the King, by a ſubterfuge ſuggeſted by his judges, endeavoured to avoid the expreſſed force of the law. The court which had been aboliſhed extended its authority to fining, impriſoning, and tendering oaths. That erected at preſent, confined its animadverſions within the bounds of eccleſiaſtical cenſure<note n="O" place="bottom">James II. 1686.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Biſhop of London ſuſpended.</note> The zeal of one Sharpe, rector of St. Giles's, gave the firſt employment to the high court of eccleſiaſtical affairs. He preached a ſermon to his congregation, in terms ſufficiently offenſive to the Romiſh faith to be carried by the Papiſts to their patron the King. A let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſigned by Sunderland, as ſecretary of ſtate, was ſent, on the fourteenth of June<note n="P" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, to Compton, Biſhop of London, to ſuſpend Sharpe from the exerciſe of his function, till the King's further pleaſure ſhould be known. Compton, who was then in correſpondence with the Prince and Princeſs of Orange<note n="Q" place="bottom">D'Avaux.</note>, was not a perſon likely to obey from James an order which he deemed illegal.

The Biſhop of London was ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on the ſixth of September, from his office, during his Majeſty's pleaſure; and two of the commiſſioners, the Biſhops of Durham and Rocheſter, together with the Biſhop of Peterborough, were authoriſed to officiate in his ſtead<note n="R" place="bottom">Auct. citat. 1686.</note>.

Men become moſt enamoured of their ſpeculative opinions when they are moſt oppoſed. The clergy continued their polemical diſcourſes againſt Popery; and James, though perhaps offended, had for ſome time the prudence to abſtain from further animadverſions on their conduct. The pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of one Johnſon, a clergyman, for writing a libel, was productive of ſome noiſe, in the preſent jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy which prevailed in the kingdom. The King, having determined to ſupport his authority, formed, during the ſummer, a camp on Hounſlow-heath, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of fifteen thouſand men. He ſpent a great part of his time in training and diſciplining theſe troops; and this force was deemed by the people, and, perhaps, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by James, as an oſtentation of his own ability to overcome all oppoſition to his authority. Though the whole army conſiſted almoſt entirely of Proteſtants, the nation, new to a ſtanding force, ſeemed to dread, that, through the unlimited obedience of military diſcipline, they might be induced to ſupport meaſures contrary to their own religious principles. Under this impreſſion, Johnſon, who had formerly been chaplain to the Lord Ruſſel, wrote an addreſs to the army. The paper was manifeſtly ſeditious. The author was tried for a high miſdemeanour, found guilty<note n="S" place="bottom">Nov. 16.</note>, degraded from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a clergyman, and whipped from Newgate to Tyburn<note n="T" place="bottom">Nov. 20.

Orders were iſſued to permit the free exerciſe of their functions to the Romiſh clergy. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant divines were prohibited from treating in their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of controverſial points.

To increaſe the terrors of the firſt, and raiſe the hopes of the latter, Tyrconnel arrived, with all his military powers, in Ireland. Officers and private men were diſmiſſed, without diſtinction, and frequently with inſults, upon various pretences. Though the King's inſtructions to the lieutenant-general contained no more than to admit all his ſubjects indiſcriminately, Tyrconnel had the imprudence to iſſue orders to receive none but Catholics. The lord-lieutenant himſelf, tho' devoted in his principles to the prerogative, was alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as well as the Proteſtant part of the nation. He dreaded conſequences of the worſt kind from the jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies which the vehement conduct of the lieutenant-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral had already raiſed; and he tranſmitted his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints to the court of England<note n="F" place="bottom">Clarendon's Letters.</note>.</p>

Sunderland, who had all along adviſed James, was in the pay of the Prince of Orange<note n="K" place="bottom">James II. 1685.</note>, and promoted, with a ſtrange kind of fidelity, his views. To encourage the King in his enthuſiaſm for Popery, was to furniſh him with the certain means of his own ruin; and the Earl managed this weakneſs with ſuch ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, that his deluded maſter deemed himſelf in a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous condition, while the ſceptre was ready to fall from his hands.

But the proſpect of obtaining, through the folly of James, the Engliſh throne, was not the ſole deſign which employed the thoughts of the Prince of Orange. The jealouſy which he had ever entertained of the too great power of France, had been lately inflamed by perſonal injuries, on the part of Lewis the Fourteenth. The territory from which his family derived their title had been ſeized by that monarch unjuſtly; and it was ſtill retained by force. He was reſolved to be revenged, if he could not obtain juſtice. The famous league of Augſbourg, which took place in the year 1687, was projected by his abilities, and carried to a concluſion by his influence. This alliance united againſt France all her enemies in the preceding war. But ſtill the league was deemed imperfect, as long as England obſerved a neutrality; and though James was not inſenſible of the honour of his kingdom, it could ſcarce be expected that he would offend France, by abetting the views of the known rival of his power. Nor was the backwardneſs of his uncle the only obſtacle which the Prince had to ſurmount. Some members of the States of Holland, gained by France, or offended at his own arbitrary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings<note n="N" place="bottom">D'Avaux, vol. iv.</note> as Stadtholder, obſtructed his preparations for war. He was even ſo ſenſible of their jealouſy, that he endeavoured to remove it by an ingenious artifice. He ordered a rumour to be ſpread, that, in his weak ſtate of body, he could not poſſibly live two years<note n="O" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. This ſerved the double purpoſe of his ambition. It prevented the oppoſition of his enemies at home, by the hopes of his death; and contributed to lull James into that ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which ſoon after proved fatal to his power.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Indulgence in Scotland.</note> James had hitherto availed himſelf of the ſervice of his Roman Catholic ſubjects, by particular diſpenſations from the penal ſtatutes. To prepare the nation for a more extenſive indulgence to the favourite ſect, the emiſſaries of the court were inſtructed to diſcourſe of the reaſonableneſs of a general toleration in matters of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The meaſure ſeemed to the King as prudent in itſelf, as it was ſuitable to his bigotry. He had loſt, in a great meaſure, the church of England, through jealouſy and recent injuries; and he hoped to balance their defection by gaining the Proteſtant Diſſenters. He reſolved, from a double conſideration, to make the firſt experiment in Scotland. A great majority of his ſubjects in that kingdom were averſe to the religion eſtabliſhed by law; and he had placed the government in the hands of men who were from principle enemies to prelacy. On the eighteenth of February, a proclamation was iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued at Edinburgh, granting a general toleration to all religious ſects, ſuſpending all penal and diſabling laws, annulling and diſcharging all oaths by way of teſt, and breaking down all diſtinctions between ſubject and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject<note n="Q" place="bottom">Gazette.</note> Though the language of the proclamation was highly deſpotic, and therefore imprudent, it ſcarce aſſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any prerogative in eccleſiaſtical affairs that had not been lately conferred upon the crown by expreſs acts of parliament.</p>

Intolerant in their own principles, and pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly averſe to the Papiſts, they looked with indifference upon that eaſe from perſecution, which they were to ſhare in common with a ſect whom they abhorred.—But nothing could diſcourage James from proſecuting his religious deſigns. He declared in council, on the 18th of March, that he was determined to extend to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land the general toleration which he had eſtabliſhed in Scotland. An uniformity of religion, he ſaid, had been forced in vain, for four ſucceſſive reigns, upon the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by the joint efforts of the crown and parliament. The reſtraint upon Diſſenters, he continued, without producing a ſingle advantage, had brought many cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities upon the Prince and the people. He aſcribed to the intolerance of the eſtabliſhed church the misfortunes of his father's reign. He obſerved, that, as is uſual in perſecutions, the penal laws had increaſed rather than diminiſhed the number of Diſſenters; and he affirmed, that nothing could more conduce to the peace of the kingdom, and to the increaſe of the number and trade of his ſubjects, than an unlimited liberty of conſcience. He had always, he ſaid, entertained an opinion, that an entire freedom in matters of religion was moſt ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to the mild ſpirit and principles of Chriſtianity; and he concluded with informing them, that he had directed his attorney and ſolicitor-general to permit no proceſs to iſſue in his name againſt any Diſſenter what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever<note n="Q" place="bottom">Gazette, Minutes of P.

His deſigns to ſerve only the Papiſts were perceived through his profeſſions in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Proteſtant Diſſenters.

The Prince of Orange, who had long fixed his eye on the Engliſh throne, watched his motions, and made every advantage of his errors. When the Earl of Rocheſter was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and Tyrconnel ſent to Ireland, he reſolved to diſpatch a truſty perſon to England, to foment the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of the Proteſtants<note n="S" place="bottom">D'Avaux, vol. iv.</note>. Dykvelt, a man of intrigue, and well known to the leaders of the party, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for that delicate ſervice. The Prince formed, by an artifice, a ſpecious pretence for Dykvelt's em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſy. The encroachments of the Dutch on the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Eaſt-India company, with regard to their commerce in Aſia, were reported to have raiſed the reſentment of James to a pitch that threatened the States with a war. Some naval preparations in England gave an appearance of juſtice to this tale; and the Province of Holland, by the recommendation of Penſionary Fagel, employed Dyk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velt as their miniſter extraordinary, to ſooth the King of England. Dykvelt, under a public character, reſided in England from February to the end of May.

His eagerneſs to gain England as a party in the alliance of Augſbourg furniſhed James with ſome hopes, that from a proſpect of obtaining that object, he would yield to his requeſt. But by the very conveyance which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried his letter to the Hague, the prince received other diſpatches that induced him to refuſe his conſent.

Attended by three troops of horſe, the commiſſioners repaired to Oxford on the twentieth of November, to take cognizance of the late proceedings at Magdalene-college, as ſupreme viſitors. Hough, the preſident, refuſing to ſubmit to the viſitation, was, for contumacy deprived. The fellows having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined not to ſubmit to the Biſhop of Oxford, that prelate was inſtalled by proxy, as preſident, by the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the commiſſioners. The court, not ſatisfied perhaps with the legality of their own commiſſion, ſhewed an inclination to accommodate matters without advancing to extremities. The college, encouraged by perſons who had entered into a correſpondence with the Prince of Orange, was obſtinate. The pride of James induced him to proceed.

Auſtria, in both its branches, preferred their political views to their zeal for the Romiſh faith; and promoted the dethronement of James, as the only means to humble Lewis the Fourteenth. Odeſcalchi, who, under the name of Innocent the Eleventh, filled then the papal chair, was gained to the meaſures of the Prince of Orange by other conſiderations, as well as through his fixed averſion to France. The Prince ſent his intimate friend, the Prince of Vaudemont, to Rome, to procure the aid of the Pope. He explained to his Holineſs, that the Catholic Princes were in the wrong to expect any advantage to their faith from James, as his being a declared Papiſt rendered his people averſe to all his meaſures. As for himſelf, ſhould he have the good fortune to mount the Engliſh throne, he might take any ſtep in favour of the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lics without jealouſy; and he promoſed to procure a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for the Papiſts, ſhould the Pope, the Emperor, and the King of Spain, favour his attempt. This negociation produced the deſired effect. Innocent contributed, with the money of the church, to expel a Roman-Catholic Prince from his throne<note n="B" place="bottom">MS. 1688.</note>.</p>

He choſe rather to truſt his ſafety to fortune, than to ſeem to own, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions, his former errors. His ſituation was too delicate for a Prince, whoſe powers were perverted by religious zeal. Diſtruſt, diſaffection, and even reſentment, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed at home; and his weight with foreign powers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in proportion as his authority among his ſubjects declined.

They refuſed to withdraw their protection from Engliſh fugitives. They openly abetted his enemies. They encouraged indecent libels againſt his perſon and government. To complete the misfortunes of this infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated Prince, he was betrayed by his ſervants abroad, as well as at home. One White, an Iriſh Roman Catholic, who had received the title of the Marquis of Albeville from the Emperor, was his envoy at the Hague.

Inſtead of yielding to his requeſt, the States entered into argument upon the ſubject; and the utmoſt he could at laſt obtain, was a paſs for ſuch of the officers of thoſe regiments as ſhould chooſe to quit the ſervice.</p>

This act of power, as it was altogether unneceſſary, aſſumed in itſelf all the appearance of conſummate folly. But when, after a few days, an order was ſubjoined to the declaration, that it ſhould be read by all the clergy in all the churches and chapels, no doubts remained of its being a projected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult upon the eſtabliſhed church. There was, however, a kind of precedent for this mode of promulgating the King's declaration. When Charles the Second diſſolved his laſt parliament at Oxford, in the year 1681, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, containing the reaſons of his conduct, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be read by the clergy, after divine ſervice. They ſubmitted with cheerfulneſs to a command which was agreeable to the prejudices of their party. But the caſe was at preſent extremely different. The teſt and penal laws againſt diſſenters were, in a great meaſure, procured by the church; and the clergy deemed any countenance they might give to the diſpenſing power, a deſertion of their own principles. They determined, therefore, not to obey orders of which they could not approve, and to riſk any danger that might ariſe from the reſentment of the King, for the preſervation of their own influence among the people<note n="F" place="bottom">Echard, Kennet, Ralph, et Auct. citat.</note>.</p>

Some prayed with the utmoſt fervour, that God would beſtow a male poſterity of the SAME royal line, to ſway the ſceptre of England to the end of the world.

In leſs than a week after the trial, they were both diſmiſſed, and their places ſupplied with men of more accommodating minds. The King perceived that the fate of the diſpenſing power was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided by the acquittal of the biſhops. But to ſatisfy in ſome degree the demands of his pride, the eccleſiaſtical commiſſioners were ordered to proceed againſt all the clergy who had not read the declaration.

But he derived the ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his ruin from the birth of a Prince of Wales. That circumſtance increaſed the fears of his ſubjects, in proportion as it raiſed his ſecurity and hopes. In the reign of a Prince to be educated under the prejudices of ſuch a father, nothing but a continuance of the ſame unconſtitutional meaſures could be expected. James, convinced in his mind of the indefeaſible right of Kings,

transferred his own weakneſs to his people; and vainly hoped to retain them by their principles of loyalty, after he had, through repeated injuries, loſt their confidence and love. Guided in all his actions by a ſpeculative ſyſtem of policy, he ſeemed to ſuppoſe that monarchy muſt end where the firſt breach upon the hereditary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion began. Neither mortification nor misfortune itſelf could convince this infatuated Prince of his error. While he dreamed of ſecurity from the birth of a ſon, he might perceive that his own fall was near.

But the nation dreaded from the ſon thoſe grievances which they had experienced from the father. Though the deciſion of a court of law, though the concurring opinions of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the whole nation had exploded the diſpenſing power, there ſcarce could remain a doubt, that James would embrace every favourable opportunity to exert it with zeal. He derived his attachment to this high pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative from principle as well as enthuſiaſm.

The church of England, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent injuries, were thrown into his ſcale; and he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, by declaring his wiſhes for a general toleration of worſhip, had gained the Diſſenters. Some men of high rank, who loved their country, afraid of the arbitrary ſchemes of James, favoured the Prince's ambition from patriot motives. Many through the love of novelty, ſeveral from diſappointment, ſome from hopes of raiſing themſelves, entered with eagerneſs into his deſigns. He, in the mean time, was employed with ſucceſs in putting himſelf in a condition to accompliſh his own views, as well as thoſe of his friends. He retained the fleet, which the States had placed in his hands in the preceding year. He provided himſelf with treaſure, by laying an embargo on the money produced by the levy on the two hundredth penny impoſed by the States. He received the ſum of four millions of florins, by way of advance upon that tax, from the French refugees. Having the principal ſervants of James in his pay, he was minutely informed of the moſt ſecret tranſactions and even deſigns of that Prince. His intelligence came, through Sidney, from Sunderland, who betrayed the very meaſures which he himſelf had adviſed<note n="A" place="bottom">D'Avaux, vol. iv.</note>.

Deceived by his informations from London, he deemed that the Queen could not be brought to bed till the middle of the ſucceeding month. In the firſt ſurpriſe of the news, he diſpatched Zuyliſtein to congratulate James on the birth of an heir to the throne; and, by that means, gave publicly his countenance to a fact which he found ſoon after convenient to deny. Upon the arrival of Admiral Herbert, who had quitted the ſervice of James, the Prince of Orange repented of his complaiſance in felicitating his father-in-law. He took the ſudden reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to deny the birth of the Prince, and even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince

The envoys of the allies denied their preſence. Not one invited to the feaſt ſent even an excuſe for abſence. Advices from England induced the Prince to take this deciſive part.

Reſolved of himſelf to purſue the object of his ambition, he wiſhed to have the ſanction of the people to his important deſign. Many, who expected with impatience his preſence, were unwilling to commit themſelves to writing on a matter ſo full of danger. The Earls of Shrewſbury, Devonſhire, and Danby, the Lord Lumley, the Biſhop of London, and Ruſſel and Sidney, ſigned at length an invitation, on the thirtieth of June<note n="E" place="bottom">Dalrymple's App.</note>. The inſtrument was rather a matter of form than an object of encouragement. Though the four peers poſſeſſed the influence of their rank in their country, the popularity of their names chiefly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended the other three. But the Prince was too pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to reſt his whole hopes on ſpontaneous friends in England. He endeavoured to gain, through the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel of intereſt, thoſe whom principle had not attached to his party. Zuyliſtein, when in England, corrupted with money thoſe whom he could not perſuade by argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to enter his own proteſt. He promiſed protection to all thoſe who ſhould declare againſt the impoſture. To carry forward the political farce with ſome ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, he ordered into his preſence the preaching mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters at the Hague. They recommended to his care the perilous ſtate of the Proteſtant faith. He anſwered them with a grave formality. He requeſted them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>double their prayers to Heaven, for that religion was never in ſuch danger before. But, if the miniſters ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed themſelves to God, they alſo uſed their influence with men. They inflamed the vulgar to a degree of madneſs by their diſcourſes; and the deputies of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterdam, who, from patriot views, had long oppoſed themſelves to the aggrandizement of the Prince of Orange, durſt not obſtruct his preſent deſigns, for fear of being torn to pieces by the rabble<note n="H" place="bottom">D'Avaux, vol. iv. paſſim.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">for invading</note> A coincidence of fortunate events favoured, at the ſame time, the deſigns of the Prince of Orange. The death of the Elector of Cologn, by intereſting France and the allies in a new election, gave a colour to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigues and preparations. Lewis the Fourteenth ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the pretenſions of the Cardinal de Furſtemberg. Prince Clement of Bavaria was abetted by the Emperor, the Dutch, and the court of Rome. The latter at length prevailed, through the partiality of the Pope<note n="I" place="bottom">Hiſtoire d'Allemagne, tom. iii.</note>; and France threatened to recover by force what ſhe had loſt by intrigue. Under the pretence of danger from that ſide, the Prince of Orange formed a camp of twenty thouſand men, between Grave and Nimeguen, in the month of Auguſt. To make up this body of troops, he ſtript Dutch Flanders of all her garriſons. He left Bergen-op-zoom itſelf expoſed. He continued, in the mean time, his preparations by ſea. He equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:0709200301:484"/>
for ſervice twenty ſhips of the line, without refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to the States. He ordered the artificers to work day and night, to fit out all the naval force of the United Provinces. Yet, amid all theſe extraordinary preparations, five only of the States were privy to his real deſigns. He had the addreſs to lull James into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; and though Lewis the Fourteenth long ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and even was at length aſſured of the intended inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, he adopted no effectual means to obſtruct meaſures which, in the iſſue, proved highly detrimental to his own power<note n="K" place="bottom">D'Avaux, vol. iv</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">England.</note> But though the States were not formally admitted into the ſecret deſigns of the Prince of Orange, they could not have been ſtrangers to his real views. The body of the people, being highly inflamed againſt France upon various grounds, exhibited an irreſiſtible eagerneſs for every preparation for war. Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce had been diminiſhed one fourth<note n="L" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, by reſtrictions on their uſual trade with France. Their religious zeal was kindled by the hardſhips impoſed by Lewis on the Proteſtants, by the impolitic revocation of the edict of Nantz. The terrors raiſed by the conduct of James in England had ſpread to Holland. His zeal for the Roman Catholic faith was exaggerated into the certain ruin of Proteſtantiſm. They ſaw themſelves ſurrounded with perils on every ſide; and they loſt the animoſities raiſed by the jealouſy of commerce againſt the Engliſh, in their pity for a people expoſed to the inroads of Popery and arbitrary power. One half of Europe had even entered into a conſpiracy againſt James, through the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of his ſon-in-law. The power, and, above all, the inſolence of Lewis, had conſpired with the memory of former injuries to inflame the houſe of Auſtria againſt France. The princes of Germany were united againſt her by their fears; and nothing but the gaining the aid of England, by the removal of James, ſeemed wanting to complete their revenge<note n="M" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

who had long received the moſt certain intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the deſigns of the Prince of Orange, rouſed James in vain to attention, and offered to no purpoſe his aid. Having refuſed to accede to the league of Augſbourg, the King was publickly accuſed by his ſon-in-law with a private treaty with France. To convince his ſubjects of the falſehood of this charge, he declined to accept the offer of a French ſquadron to join his fleet. This offer, which was made in June, eſcaped not the vigilance of Van Citters. He complained to the King, who anſwered, that he would make no uſe of a foreign force, unleſs obliged by his maſters<note n="N" place="bottom">James II. 1688.</note>. Deceived by his ſervants, and betrayed throughout by the Earl of Sunderland, he had the weakneſs to believe that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports of an invaſion were raiſed to frighten him into a ſtrict connection with France. Beſides, he gave credit to the repeated aſſurances of the States, that the arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment prepared in their ports was not deſigned againſt England. He even believed the aſſeverations of the Prince himſelf, whoſe intereſt it was to deceive<note n="O" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derland deſcanted againſt the poſſibility of an invaſion. He turned to ridicule all thoſe who believed the report. Having, by the prior conſent of James, taken poſſeſſion of all the foreign correſpondence, he ſuppreſſed every intelligence that might alarm; and even all others whom James truſted, except Dartmouth<note n="P" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, affected long to live no faith to a tale which ſeemed to be propagated by France to forward her own political views.</p>

This artifice had a deciſive effect on the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolic weakneſs of James. His ſuſpicions of Sunderland vaniſhed upon his converſion. He would not believe that ſo good a Catholic could be ſo great a knave. But the art of Sunderland could no longer deceive. The invaſion from Holland was now obvious, and almoſt pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly avowed. A powerful fleet was ready to ſail. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral regiments fell down the Maeſe from Nimeguen to Rotterdam. They were replaced by German troops to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Rhine. The tranſports, which had been hired in different ports, began to aſſemble.

The greater, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, was the neceſſity to execute with preciſion what he affected to promiſe with ſincerity. The arts of his ſecret enemies, or perhaps only accident, furniſhed a new ſubject of diſtruſt to the nation. The Biſhop of Wincheſter, with a warrant for reſtoring Magdalene-college, left London on the fourteenth of October; but inſtead of repairing to Oxford, he retired to Farnham. Urged, however, by the Archbiſhop of Canterbury, he arrived in the univerſity on the twentieth, with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of reſtoring the fellows the next day. But he had ſcarce gone to bed, when he received an official letter from the Earl of Sunderland, commanding his preſence in council at ten of the clock on the twenty-ſecond.—This was no more than a general order, without ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the buſineſs, ſent to all the biſhops, to be preſent at enrolling the depoſitions concerning the birth of the Prince of Wales. The meſſenger had gone to Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. He proceeded from thence to Oxford. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, without reſtoring the college, returned to London.

Had he retracted his illegal and unpopular meaſures upon the firſt ſurmiſes of an invaſion, in the preceding ſummer, had he even called a parliament, upon reſtoring their liberties and franchiſes to the corporations, prudence would have dictated to the Prince of Orange to lay up his fleet, and decline the projected invaſion. The moſt hoſtile houſe of commons could ſcarce have demanded more than an abſolute and legal confirmation of what James had already granted. But when he recalled the old, and iſſued no new writs for a parliament, men with great reaſon began to doubt his ſincerity. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that he intended to recall, ſhould he ſucceed againſt the Prince, condeſcenſions evidently extorted from him by mere neceſſity. James however aſſerts the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

He acknowledged their kindneſs to him upon many occaſions. He took God to witneſs, that he had ſtudied their intereſt ever ſince they truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with the government. With the like awful ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to Heaven, he took God to witneſs, that he had not the leaſt intention to invade or ſubdue the kingdom of England, much leſs to make himſelf maſter thereof, or to invert or prejudice the lawful ſucceſſion. He averred, on the contrary, that his ſole deſign was to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the nation in re-eſtabliſhing the laws, in recovering their liberties, and in ſecuring their religion, by means of a free parliament. His intention, he ſaid, was to aid that aſſembly in making ſuch proviſion, in a legal way, as ſhould place religion and liberty on a ſolid and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing foundation. His other great deſign, he affirmed was to put the nation in a condition to concur with the common cauſe of Chriſtendom, and to reſtore and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the peace and tranquillity of Europe<note n="R" place="bottom">Neuville, tom. i.</note>.

               <p>
                  <note place="margin">His decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</note> Six days before the Prince took this formal leave of the States, he publiſhed a declaration, penned by Fagel, to be diſperſed upon his landing in England. This ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate, but heavy performance, enumerated, in fifteen articles, the more notorious attacks made by James on the religion and laws of the Britiſh kingdoms.

not born of the Queen. He aſſured the world, that his expedition was intended for no other deſign but to procure a free parliament, to heal the breaches between the King and his ſubjects. This declaration was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Burnet from the French of Fagel; and even printed, when intelligence arrived from England that the King had retracted almoſt all the meaſures of which the Prince complained. A ſupplement was immediatly added. The change in the counſels of James was perhaps juſtly aſcribed to fear. The Prince expreſſed his reſolution to procure a confirmation of the conceſſions already made, in a free parliament, which ſhould aſſemble under the ſhelter of his arms. This ſelf-denial of the Prince was too common to be deemed ſincere. But the ſolemnity with which he called God to witneſs his own difinte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſtedneſs, greatly facilitated the execution of his deſigns.</p>

The force on board conſiſted of fifteen thouſand two hundred men, including five hundred and fifty-ſix officers. The Prince himſelf, with the Mareſchal de Schomberg, embarked in a frigate of thirty-ſix guns, which carried the flag of England at the maſt-head. Vice-admiral Herbert, a man who covered the profligacy of his private life by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to public virtue, led the van; the Prince of Orange, with Boſtiens, the center. The Zealand ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, under Evertſon, brought up the rear. This enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous body had ſcarce got out to ſea, when a dreadful tempeſt aroſe at ſouth-weſt, and drove the fleet to the north. The ſtorm raged for twelve hours. The ſhips were diſperſed. The Prince returned next day to Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voetſluys, with four men of war and ſixty tranſports.—Nine hundred horſes were thrown over-board. But that was all the loſs ſuſtained.

printed in their Gazettes. They averred, that nine ſhips of war were loſt; that many tranſports foundered at ſea. The moſt obnoxious of thoſe Engliſhmen who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Prince were ſaid to have been drowned.—The States themſelves were diſmayed; and the Prince of Orange, they affirmed, would find it impoſſible to proſecute his deſign before the ſpring.

But the next day, having changed his reſolution, he ſuddenly tacked about, and drove weſtward right before the wind. On the third of November, he was diſcovered, between Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Calais, ſtretching down the channel with all his ſails. The ſhores were covered with multitudes of ſpectators, who felt alternately the reverſes of pleaſure and terror at ſuch a magnificent and awful ſight.

day, almoſt every hour, brought intelligence of ſome freſh defection or diſaſter. His neareſt friends were his greateſt enemies. They whom he had moſt obliged were the firſt to forſake his ſide. Commotion and tumult prevailed. The people roſe in various counties. The Lord Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mere was in arms in Cheſhire. The city of York was ſeized by the Earl of Danby. In Derby, the Earl of Devonſhire declared for the Prince of Orange. The Biſhop of London, under pretence of a guard, formed a kind of an army round the Princeſs Anne, in Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. The Earl of Bath, the governor of Plymouth, held that place for the Prince. A general confederacy ſeemed to prevail againſt the King among all his ſubjects. Thoſe who oppoſed him not with open force, diſtracted, under the maſk of friendſhip, his counſels; and embarraſſed all his meaſures, by contradictory opinions and oppoſite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. He threw himſelf, in the laſt reſort, upon the peers, who were then in London. An aſſembly of that order was called on the twenty-ſeventh of November. But, inſtead of extricating him from his misfortunes, they ſeemed to take advantage of his diſtreſs, and to urge him forward to that ruin, which he could not now avoid, without their aid.</p>

Thoſe who loved him beſt were the moſt offended at thoſe meaſures which had reduced him to inextricable diſtreſs.

was publiſhed, that all peers, and ſuch as ſhould be elected members of the lower-houſe, ſhould have full liberty to ſerve and ſit in parliament, notwithſtanding their having appeared in arms, or committed any act of hoſtility. The King declared, that he would ſend com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners to treat with the Prince of Orange: but as to the removal of Papiſts, he would leave that matter to be debated in parliament<note n="Y" place="bottom">Gazette.</note>.

They left London on the ſecond of December; but they were not admitted to an audience till the eighth of the month. To wear down the time, that he might uſe to the beſt advantage the favourable events which daily aroſe, he amuſed the commiſſioners, by ſending them from place to place. Having at length admitted them to an audience, he deſired that they ſhould put their propoſals in writing. They informed his Highneſs, that they were commiſſioned to attend him by the King, for the ſole purpoſe of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſting matters neceſſary for the freedom of elections, and the ſecurity of the ſitting of parliament; that, in the mean time, the reſpective armies ſhould, to prevent apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, be reſtrained within certain limits, and at a proper diſtance from the city of London. The Prince, with great prudence, placed the burden of an anſwer upon a meeting of ſuch Engliſh peers and gentlemen as had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouſed his cauſe. Their debates were long and vehement. Though a free parliament was now the only object not obtained of all the articles of the Prince's declaration, a majority carried, that the writs iſſued for that purpoſe ſhould be ſuperſeded.

of the people would at laſt ſupply the place of loyalty. Their preſent defection aroſe from their apprehenſions from the popery of the King, and not from any averſion to the legal authority of the crown. That republican enthuſiaſm, which had overturned the throne forty years before, was either altogether extinguiſhed, or ſoftened down into the more practicable principles of limiting the royal prerogative. A breach upon the regular ſucceſſion, though perhaps the neareſt way to the abſolute ſecurity of public freedom, was neither underſtood nor deſired. Men judged of the future by the paſt. A diſputed title to the crown had dyed the annals of former ages with blood No declaration of the legiſlature could alter at once the principles of mankind, or induce the nation in general to relinquiſh the firſt maxim of government delivered down from their anceſtors.

A ſpirit had gone abroad, which the precipitate folly of James could only prevent from turning to his advantage. Influenced by his own fears, or mortified at his preſent abject condition, he reſolved to retire. He was convinced that he could not do a ſervice more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to his rival. The guards were not kept exact. The back-door of the houſe in which he lodged was left without any guard. The Prince forgot his uſual pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in his eagerneſs for the flight of James. He ſent public orders to the captain of the guards, not to look ſtrictly after the King. James, however, was afraid either of poiſon or aſſaſſination<note n="E" place="bottom">James II. paſſim.</note>. He conſidered not, that his death, in either of thoſe ways, would be more dangerous to the Prince than his life; and if he could not confide in his humanity, he might at leaſt rely on his prudence. The flight of his uncle to France could alone ſecure to him the throne. The republican ſpirit which brought Charles to the block, was by no means the characteriſtic of the preſent times. An enthuſiaſm ſimilar to his own, precipitated him from his throne, and not thoſe manly principles which deem every go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment unjuſt that is not free.</p>

Had he remained in England, his very misfortunes would have brought back the old, or created new friends.

Ungaining in his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, perſevering in the purſuit of his own ſchemes, as negligent of friends as he was careleſs of his enemies, the Prince was not likely to retain, for any length of time, the popularity which he had acquired.

He juſtly judged, when once a breach was made on the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, that it mattered little how far the ſettlement of the crown ſhould deviate from the genuine line. The Princeſs of Orange had no better title than her huſband to the throne, while her father and brother were alive. Beſides, he perceived that he could add to the number of his own party, with the ſame meaſure which ſhould gratify the Prince. Men of republican principles highly favoured an alteration in the ſucceſſion, as the means of weakening or perhaps aboliſhing monarchy. They were the chief inſtruments in guiding, and even terrify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the people to the mode of ſettlement promoted by Halifax, who ſeemed himſelf to act only under the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Prince's Dutch ſervants and friends. Their eagerneſs upon this head had led them into an error deſtructive of their romantic views. They had even inveſted already the Prince with the firſt preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the crown, the privilege of calling a parliament. Inſtead of iſſuing directions, when they met in conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, for the choice of a free parliament, they, with pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar abſurdity, employed the Prince of Orange in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing that work; as if they could transfer to a foreigner, who poſſeſſed no office that the conſtitution recogniſed, a right, which they were afraid to exert themſelves.</p>

He wiſhed to preſerve inviolable the claims of monarchy, yet reſolved to break the ſucceſſion. He endeavoured to gain the Prince, by transferring the crown to his wife, as the next heir. The folly which induced him to believe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the Prince of Orange invaded England for a leſs prize than the throne, gave him hopes that he would now reſt ſatisfied with the honour of having a queen for his conſort. Danby was not, however, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute of ſupport in his opinion. The warm abettors of monarchy were half reconciled to an expedient, which overturned not quite their principles.

Beſides, his Dutch friends, though they pretended to ſpeak from no authority, diſcovered his ſentiments. Fagel, at a meeting held at the Earl of Devon's, put an end to the doubts of Danby. When that lord urged his own vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionary ſcheme of ſettling the crown, he was plainly told, that the Prince of Orange would not be his wife's gentleman-uſher<note n="C" place="bottom">Dalrymple's Append.</note>.</p>

The convention which reſtored Charles the Second was by no means ſimilar to that which raiſed William the Third to the throne. The long parliament, however much they might have abuſed the authority, derived their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence from a ſource recogniſed by the conſtitution and laws.

<pb n="503" facs="tcp:0709200301:531"/>
prove, that the King's deſerting the kingdom, without appointing any perſon to adminiſter the government during his abſence, amounted, in reaſon as well as in law, to a demiſe. There was no novelty in this argument. It had been frequently urged without doors, ever ſince it was firſt mentioned in the aſſembly of the peers in December. Men more violent than Dolben objected to his motion of a demiſe, as too narrow a foundation for a firm and permanent ſettlement. They affirmed, that this political demiſe inferred, that the crown ought im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to fall on the next heir. But as this would be attended with the ſame inconvenience which they wiſhed to remove, they inſiſted, that there could be no deſcent in the preſent caſe; and that the throne being vacated by the deſertion of the Prince, the royal autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity had fallen to the diſpoſal of the people, from whom it originally aroſe. Finch, on the other hand, offered ſeveral arguments for a regency.

A third, but the moſt conſiderable party, adhered to the unfortunate King; ſome, from an affection to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; but more, from a deſpair of the Prince's favour, which ſeemed to be altogether engroſſed by the Whigs.

He urged the precariouſneſs of the throne, ſhould the power of judging the King remain in the people. He argued, that the firſt breach upon the line of ſucceſſion would render, in fact, the crown elective. He declared for a regency, as the only means to exclude James, without ruining monarchy; and he affirmed, that all other expedients were only calculated to pleaſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican party, who deemed that the King was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable to the people, from whom he derived his power.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Debates in the</note> The lords who oppoſed the motion urged arguments ſtill more ſpecious. They affirmed, that a regency ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed without the conſent of the King, was a greater breach upon monarchy than the filling of the throne by election. They could find no difference, they ſaid, between dethroning the King and depriving him of all authority. They urged the manifeſt abſurdity of having two kings at the ſame time; the one poſſeſſed of the power, and the other of the title; eſpecially when, in the very nature of the thing, they muſt be in perpetual oppoſition. A regency in the preſent caſe, they ſaid, would be more illegal, as well as more unſafe, than a King with even a diſputable title. The law of England, they continued, had provided for the ſecurity of the ſubject, in ſubmitting to the King in poſſeſſion; but no ſtatute had made any proviſion for the ſafety of thoſe who ſhould adhere to a regent againſt the lawful Prince. Should the government, they ſaid, be carried on in the name of James, the nation would conſider him ſtill as their real King; and ſhould any perſon endeavour, either by plot or inſurrection, to reſtore him to his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, ſuch perſon could not be proſecuted, as for high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaſon, for an act which the laws conſtrued into a duty. In the weakneſs or infancy of a Prince, for inſtance, they ſaid the caſe was extremely different. The will of the regent was then conſidered as the will of the King. But, in the preſent caſe, a perpetual conteſt muſt ſubſiſt between them; the one endeavouring to recover his power, the other to preſerve his authority.</p>

A queſtion more ſpeculative and leſs important could ſcarce engage the attention of a deliberative aſſembly. When men are forced to return to firſt principles, there is a kind of ridicule in ſearching for precedents. Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from reaſon might be produced, that a kind of compact was underſtood to ſubſiſt between the ſubject and the ſovereign. But the actual exiſtence of ſuch a compact was as unneceſſary as the fact itſelf was untrue.

The bench of biſhops, the Tory peers, thoſe who were diſcontented with the Prince, or who derived
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:0709200301:534"/>
no hopes from his power, recurred to the trite maxim of law, that the King never dies. As a proof of this poſition, they urged the oath of allegiance, which binds the ſubject to the heirs of the King as well as to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The adherents of the Prince affirmed, that the oath of allegiance regarded only a natural demiſe; and they juſtly obſerved, that there was no proviſion made in law for a civil demiſe. Upon this foundation the whole ought to reſt. No one could deny but the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention might make a precedent upon a new matter as well as their anceſtors. But men were inflamed by pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices; and they wandered to ſlight quibbles from ſolid reaſon. The reſult of the whole was, by a majority of eleven<note n="U" place="bottom">55 againſt 44.</note>, that the words, <q rend="inline">"the throne is thereby va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant,"</q> ſhould be expunged from the vote of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. But from this deciſion a new queſtion aroſe. If the throne was not vacant, by whom was it filled? James was excluded already; and it was not yet agreed who was the next heir. A motion was made, that, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <q rend="inline">"the throne is hereby vacant,"</q> ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, <q rend="inline">"that the Prince and Princeſs of Orange ſhould be declared King and Queen."</q> This alſo, upon a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was rejected by a majority of eleven votes<note n="X" place="bottom">52 againſt 41.</note>.</p>

The enemies of James prevailed. But the letter ſoon found its way to the preſs. The King, to a recapitulation of reaſons, which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given, for withdrawing from Rocheſter, added new matter. He complained, that the Prince of Orange had intercepted and ſuppreſſed the copies which he had ſent to his privy-council and peers.

The Dukes of Ormond, Southampton, Grafton and Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thumberland, who firſt declared for a regency, were either perſuaded out of their former principles by argument, or gained through the channel of intereſt. The commons had, by a conſiderable majority<note n="A" place="bottom">282 againſt 151.</note>, rejected the amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the lords, upon their grand reſolve. To ſhew their adherence to the Prince of Orange, they thanked the clergy who had oppoſed the encroachments of James.

The conference was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with more ingenuity than ability. The debate conſiſted of a mere play upon words. ABDICATE, DE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SERT, and VACANCY, were the ſubjects of conteſt, when the fate of the kingdom depended upon the debate. The diſpute was more ſuitable to the pedantry of ſchools than to the dignity of the two houſes of parliament.

When the report was made to the lords, a violent debate aroſe. Halifax and Danby profited from their conference with the Prince; and urged vehemently for cloſing with the commons. The managers of the conference maintained their former opinions with heat and obſtinacy. The Earl of Notting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham diſtinguiſhed himſelf upon the occaſion, though he was one of thoſe who invited the Prince of Orange.

That, in caſe of a failure of theſe, the crown ſhould paſs to the perſon that ſhould be limited and regulated by act of parliament; and, in default of ſuch limitation, to the lawful heirs of the Prince of Orange. The lords ſent this declaratory vote to the commons. But the lower houſe, though they ſeemed eager for a vacancy, were not ſo precipitate in filling the throne. They deemed it indecent to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the kingdom from their former ſovereign, without gaining ſome points for the people. They ought to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that when they conferred the crown, they might have given it upon their own terms. A committee had been appointed to draw up the claims of the ſubject, under a new ſettlement, a precaution which the lords had neglected, in the violence of their debates. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port conſiſted of two branches. The firſt was declaratory of ancient rights. The ſecond, introductory of new laws.

He ſent the Lord Wharton to the leaders of the commons.

of the ſubject to the vote which raiſed the Prince of Orange to the throne. But this complaiſance of the commons finiſhed not the buſineſs of the ſettlement. The lords made amendments.

The whole was finiſhed on the twelfth of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruary; and on that very day the Princeſs of Orange arrived at Whitehall, from Holland.

To a preamble, containing a detail of the grievances of the preceding reign, they annexed the claim of ancient rights and liberties. They declared that the diſpenſing power, as it had been lately aſſumed, was illegal. That the late eccleſiaſtical commiſſion was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to law. That the levying of money without the authority of parliament was unlawful. That the ſubject has a right to petition the King. That the raiſing or keeping a ſtanding army in the time of peace, except by the conſent of parliament, is againſt law. They aſſerted the right of ſubjects, being Proteſtants, to poſſeſs arms. They declared that the election of members and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates of parliament ought to be free. They affirmed that exceſſive bail ought not to be required, nor exceſſive fines impoſed. They declared, that jurors, in matters of treaſon, ought to be freeholders. That all grants and promiſes of ſines and forſeitures before conviction are il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legal and void. They inſiſted, that parliaments ought to be held frequently, for the redreſs of grievances, and for amending, ſtrengthening, and preſerving the laws.
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:0709200301:539"/>
The declaration of his Highneſs, they ſaid, had encouraged them to this demand; and, having an entire confidence in the Prince of Orange, they hoped that he would ſtill continue thoſe rights which he had already preſerved<note n="L" place="bottom">Journals.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Obſervations</note> No hereditary monarch could refuſe his aſſent to this declaration, which was preſented to an elected King. The rights that were claimed had been recognized in the moſt arbitrary reigns, though they were ſometimes evaſively invaded. Great omiſſions, it was urged by many, were apparently made in this new ſettlement of the crown. A King was choſen: but he received the prerogatives, as well as the throne, of former Kings. He was armed with the ſame powers. The people were equally ſubject to his ambition and arbitrary views. A great alteration was made. But men only, and not mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and ſecurities, were changed. The convention al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the ſucceſſion upon republican reaſons. They eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the new ſettlement upon high monarchical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. In vain, they ſaid, the people aſſumed the power of making a king, if the work of their own hands ſhould become independent when made. They obſerved, that the elected Prince poſſeſſed the ſame authority with his predeceſſors over parliaments, who are accounted the guardians of public freedom. Their elections remained as inſecure as before. Their meetings were as uncertain. They were not made the maſters of their own ſeſſions. No proviſion was made for their meeting annually, duen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nially, or even once in three years. Their whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, it was affirmed, remained precarious. Their beſt meaſures were liable to be defeated by adjournment, prorogation, and diſſolution. Even the preſent popularity of the Prince, his very attachment to Proteſtantiſm, his being choſen in the name of the nation, ſeemed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire ſtricter limitations than a monarch, whoſe meaſures, from their being ſuſpected, were certain of being oppoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion.</note> But men who argued in this manner ſeem not to have perceived, that the change in the ſucceſſion was a great point obtained for the people againſt the crown. The reverence with which ſome political zealots looked up to the ſovereign, muſt naturally have been diminiſhed, when he ceaſed, according to their ridiculous maxim, to derive his right to their allegiance from God. The line of
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:0709200301:540"/>
monarchy coming down without interruption from an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity, even excited a kind of veneration dangerous to freedom, among the body of the people. They were unable to ſeparate the duty which they owed to the kingly office from the perſonal authority of the King. But when the chain was once broken, the monarch could poſſeſs no more power than what the eſtabliſhed laws beſtowed. The crown was reſpected more than the Prince. It was no longer conſidered as private property, ſince the hands which gave might reſume it again. Beſides, the Prince himſelf would derive moderation from the very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his owing to others his power. His diſputed title would naturally throw him on his people, as their adherence only could preſerve the authority which they conferred. The popularity of William was ſcarce an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to his elevation. It ſprung from accident, and was not likely to laſt. His ungracious addreſs, his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding manner, the phlegm of his diſpoſition, and even the ungracefulneſs of a ſickly and emaciated form, were by no means qualities either to gain or retain the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the vulgar. He however derived ſecurity from the ſtate of the times, as well as from his own parts. Men could leſs forgive James for the injuries they had done to that deluded Prince, than for thoſe which he himſelf was ſuppoſed to have done to the laws.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reflections</note> Such was the end of the reign of James the Second, a Prince, whoſe impolitic conduct deprived, in a great meaſure, his very misfortunes of regret. He met with the common fate of the unfortunate: he was more blamed than he deſerved. His enthuſiaſm in favour of a religion which his ſubjects abhorred, was a ſpecies of madneſs rather than a crime. There is, however, ſcarce any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe that he himſelf, with all his bigotry, ever entertained hopes of eſtabliſhing the Romiſh faith in England<note n="M" place="bottom">James II.</note>. He was evidently hurried into ſome of his worſt meaſures by ſervants, who were bribed by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to betray him to his ruin. The Popiſh cabinet, who firſt adviſed the diſpenſing power<note n="N" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, was formed by Sunderland, then in the pay, as well as privy to the views, of the Prince of Orange; and the violence of Jefferys kindled a difference with the biſhops, which haſtened his maſter's ruin<note n="O" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. His attack upon Magdalene-college,
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:0709200301:541"/>
in Oxford, though ſufficiently expreſſive of his dangerous principles, was carried to extremity more through the arts of Sunderland, than by his own violence. Though he avowedly deſigned that college as a ſeminary for his favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite ſect<note n="P" place="bottom">James II.</note>, there is ſcarce any reaſon to doubt, had he heard of the firſt petition of the fellows, but he would have dropt his perſecution of Oxford, as he had relinquiſhed his attempt on Cambridge.</p>

                  <note place="margin">on the reign,</note> He is, however, by no means to be excuſed in many other parts of his conduct. His haughtineſs to his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament when they ſat, his tampering with them after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, to favour his views, his keeping on foot a great army, without the excuſe of domeſtic diſturbances or fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign war, were irrefragable proofs of his arbitrary prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and ultimately of his deſigns. His interference with the common courſe of juſtice, by diſplacing judges who interpreted not the laws according to his inclination, was a dangerous grievance, and raiſed, with juſtice, the jealouſy, and even the indignation of his people. His partiality to Papiſts, to the excluſion of his other ſubjects, was full of injuſtice and weakneſs. His own open pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Romiſh faith, his encouraging the prieſts of that religion to appear at his court in the habits of their reſpective orders, his licenſing places of worſhip for his favourite ſect, his erecting popiſh ſchools, to ſeduce the children of his ſubjects from Proteſtaniſm, were inſtances of inſult to his people, as well as of folly in himſelf. His whole reign, in ſhort, was full of imprudencies in his own conduct, and with attacks on the favourite prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of his people.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter,</note> In many reſpects, it muſt be owned that he was a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous man, as well as a good monarch. He was frugal of the public money. He encouraged commerce with great attention. He applied himſelf to naval affairs with ſucceſs. He ſupported the fleet, as the glory and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of England<note n="Q" place="bottom">Ibid. paſſim.</note>. He was alſo zealous for the honour of his country. He was capable of ſupporting its intereſts with a degree of dignity in the ſcale of Europe. In his private life he was almoſt irreproachable. He was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent parent, a tender huſband, a generous and ſteady friend. In his deportment he was affable, though ſlately. He beſtowed favours with peculiar grace. He prevented
<pb n="514" facs="tcp:0709200301:542"/>
ſolicitation by the ſuddenneſs of his diſpoſal of places. Though ſcarce any prince was ever ſo generally deſerted, few ever had ſo many private friends. Thoſe who injured him the moſt were the firſt to implore his forgiveneſs; and even after they had raiſed another Prince to his throne, they reſpected his perſon, and were anxious for his ſafety. To theſe virtues he added a ſteadineſs of counſels, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance in his plans, and courage in his enterpriſes. He was honourable and fair in all his dealings. He was unjuſt to men in their principles, but never with regard to their property. Though few monarchs ever offended a people more, he yielded to none in his love of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. He even affirmed, that he quitted England to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the horrors of a civil war, as much as from fear of a reſtraint upon his perſon from the Prince of Orange. His great virtue was a ſtrict adherence to facts and truth in all he wrote and ſaid, though ſome parts of his conduct had rendered his ſincerity in his political profeſſions ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected by his enemies.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">views,</note> There is, however, nothing more certain than that the people found themſelves aggrieved; and that, conſequently they had a right to do juſtice to themſelves. Though, in England, apprehenſions for the future were much greater than preſent grievances, yet that conduct in the Prince, which raiſed thoſe apprehenſions, ought to be oppoſed. There is reaſon to believe, that the preference given to a ſect, whom the people in general abhorred, raiſed more indignation than actual fears of the eſtabliſhment of the Popiſh religion. The thing itſelf was, even at the time, deemed, by men of ſenſe, impoſſible<note n="R" place="bottom">Marquis of Haliſax to the Prince of Orange.</note>. The Papiſts ſcarce bore the proportion of one to two hundred Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants in the nation. Scarce one in fifty of the army, which created ſo much terror and jealouſy, was of the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh perſuaſion. Though ſeveral of that ſect were in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, they were men of mean abilities; and they even ſeemed afraid of violence. The enthuſiaſm of the King was the great object of diſguſt to the nation. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation of all confidence to perſons whom their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious opinions only recommended, diſappointed men who, from a former poſſeſſion of power, were ſtill fond of office. The abilities of thoſe, working upon the fears of others, had actually diſarmed James at home, before
<pb n="515" facs="tcp:0709200301:543"/>
he was invaded from abroad. His wild projects were effectually defeated by a jury at London, before he was diſcomfited by the terrors of a Dutch army. He had made the moſt ample conceſſions for the injuries done to the laws. He left the conſtitution much better than he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it from his brother's hands. Nothing remained to confirm the liberties of the nation but the ſanction of a parliament, whoſe elections were now entirely independent of the will of the King.</p>

Men foreſaw, that, ſhould James defeat the Prince of Orange in the field, he might either refuſe or adhere at pleaſure to his conceſſions. Though they placed ſome confidence in his natural ſincerity, they could never truſt his enthuſiaſm. Their very prejudices againſt his religion ſuggeſted terrors, which proved fatal to his authority. They believed him capable of making a ſhow of yielding, to recover the power of doing more harm. Upon this principle was founded that general deſertion which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out aſſigning this reaſon, might be deemed unaccountable, if not diſgraceful. A more honourable conduct might certainly have eſtabliſhed liberty on a ſolid foundation. Had the officers declared for a free parliament, inſtead of quitting their colours, when a foreign enemy was in the kingdom, a doubt can ſcarce be formed that the hands of James might be ſufficiently tied from effecting further miſchief. An era of liberty might have commenced with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the expence, or even danger of a change. The power of the crown might have been more circumſcribed than when the ſceptre was placed in the hands of the Prince of Orange. James had loſt all influence among his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, except that which he derived from the adherence of ſome to the line of ſucceſſion. Even theſe would have yielded to any regulation that ſhould not deprive him of the name of King.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Arguments for the Revolution.</note> His flight to France, however, muſt change the whole ſtate of the argument. He was in the hands of a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful monarch, whoſe ambition would take advantage of what chance had thrown in his way. With more than two thirds of Europe leagued againſt Lewis the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, it was his intereſt to procure at leaſt the neutrality
<pb n="516" facs="tcp:0709200301:544"/>
of England. To render James uſeful to his views, he might find it neceſſary to aid him in the recovery of his former power. An army might be eaſily tranſported into the kingdom of a Prince already in his intereſt. The Prince of Orange, diſappointed in his ambition, would either leave the nation to their fate, or place the crown upon his own head by conqueſt. Dangers threatened from every ſide. The neceſſity of an immediate ſettlement was obvious. A foreign force was in poſſeſſion of the capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. The national army was either diſperſed, without a leader, or under the orders of the candidate for the crown. No reſource remained, but to grant with a good grace what he otherwiſe might command for himſelf, or throw in diſguſt, and without any terms, at the feet of his rival. Upon this obvious ground of neceſſity the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ought to have proceeded, and to leave puerile quibbles about words to the idle declamation of the ſchools.</p>

Her unambitious and eaſy temper had been long ſubdued by the ſtern ſeverity of a huſband, whom few of her ſex would admire. Habit had reconciled her mind to implicit obedience; and her paſſions, which were never ſtrong, had yielded to an opinion of duty. Removed from her native country and from her father when very young, her affections for both had greatly declined.

In her want of importance with HIM, ſhe ceaſed to be an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of conſequence in the eyes of the nation. The whole authority of the crown was now veſted in Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, by the opinion of the people, as well as by the declaration of the convention. The conceit of ſubjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the name of Mary to her huſband's title was a pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erile ſubterfuge; and the circumſtance therefore deſerves no further attention in the hiſtory of the preſent reign.</p>

The eagerneſs with which the nation looked up to the new King's mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures induced them to perceive a ſingularity in a paper of mere form. They obſerved that a Prince, who had juſt received the crown by the election of the people, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed himſelf, in the firſt ſentence of his firſt public deed, as deriving his right from God. On the ſeventeenth of the month he formed his privy-council. The liſt chiefly conſiſted of ſuch perſons as had been moſt active in raiſing him to the throne<note n="D" place="bottom">Feb. 17.</note>. To gratify as many as poſſible of his friends, the ſeveral boards, and even the chancery, were put into commiſſion. The benches of the Exchequer and common law were filled with perſons who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves againſt the meaſures of the late King. The Earl of Nottingham, who had ſo violently oppoſed the elevation of William, and the Earl of Shrewſbury, who had adhered to his views, were made ſecretaries of ſtate. The Marquis of Halifax and the Earl of Danby, though rivals in policy, were admitted into the cabinet. The firſt as lord privy ſeal, the latter as preſident of the council. His Dutch friends were not in the mean time forgot by the King. Bentinck, his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, was made a privy-counſellor, groom of the ſtole, and privy purſe. Auverquerque was appointed maſter of the horſe. Zuyliſtein received the office of maſter of the robes.

of the nation. The prejudices of the people were ſtrong againſt foreigners. The Tories, who had departed from their principles to ſerve the King, were offended at their being excluded from his favour. Theſe diſcontents roſe only gradually, as the new appointments were made. While places remained vacant, the hopes of ſome kept in ſilence the whole. The firſt advice de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by William of his privy-council was, Whether the convention might be legally converted into a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? A majority having expreſſed themſelves in the affirmative, the King, for the firſt time, went in ſtate to the houſe of lords on the eighteenth of February.—He told the two houſes, in a ſpeech from the throne, that he was very ſenſible of their kindneſs. He aſſured them, that he highly valued the confidence which they had repoſed in his conduct; and that he was reſolved never to do any thing that might juſtly leſſen their good opinion. He recommended to their care the perilous condition of Holland. He ſhewed the neceſſity of a good ſettlement at home. He repreſented the dangers which threatened Ireland. He left it, he ſaid, to them to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of the moſt effectual means of preventing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies ariſing from delays, and to judge of the forms moſt proper to attain the good of the nation, which, on his part, he ſhould be always ready to promote<note n="F" place="bottom">Journals, Feb. 18.</note>.</p>

The bill was read twice immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and the next day<note n="G" place="bottom">Feb. 19.</note> paſſed. The commons, in a committee of their whole houſe, fell into a violent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, <q rend="inline">"Whether a King elected, by coming to and conſulting with the lords and commons, did not conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute as complete a parliament as if ſuch King had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered new elections to be made by writs."</q> Several mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers inſiſted, that the King's writs were as neceſſary to form the legality of a parliament as his preſence. Some urged, from precedents, againſt this poſition. Others, with more reaſon, affirmed, that the preſent ſtate of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs required expedition: and that after all the loſs of time which ſhould be incurred by the new election, the parliament would remain upon the ſame footing of lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

as before. The majority of the houſe, afraid of the trouble of re-elections, ſeemed to incline to the latter argument. The reſolve already mentioned was in the mean time brought down from the lords. The bill was read immediately for the firſt time. Great oppoſition was made. But the bill paſſed the houſe on the twenty-ſecond of February, and received the next day the royal aſſent. The malecontents among the commons were ſo much exaſperated, that they declared, in the courſe of the debate, they would give no countenance, by ſitting in it, to ſuch an illegal parliament. They accordingly retired to the country, in appearance to adhere to their profeſſions. But their enemies affirmed, that they only retired to avoid taking the oaths to the new King<note n="H" place="bottom">Publications of the times.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Frugality of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> The ſame day that William gave his aſſent to the act for converting the convention into a parliament, a motion was made in the houſe of commons, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering prior to the King's ſpeech, upon a conſideration of grievances. A bill was brought in, for taking away the court holden before the council and preſident of Wales<note n="I" place="bottom">Feb. 23.</note>. But before the houſe proceeded further in a line which circumſcribed the power of the crown, the adherents of the court prevailed, upon the ground of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, that the ſpeech ſhould be firſt conſidered. A queſtion was accordingly propoſed, Whether the revenue was expired, or whether it devolved on the preſent King? The eagerneſs with which the commons raiſed William to the throne ſeemed to have already abated. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry urged with vehemence, that the revenue together with the crown devolved on their preſent Majeſties. But the houſe reſolved, notwithſtanding, that the revenue of the late King expired with his power. When this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was carried, the committee broke up abruptly. A motion was made when the houſe was reſumed, that a revenue ſhould be ſettled upon the King. Day after day the commons, under various pretences, avoided to come to a deciſion. The crown, now deſtitute of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, was in their power. They ſeemed inclined to obtain thoſe ſecurities which they had neglected when they elected a new King. The neceſſity of the times broke in part through this procraſtination of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. William acquainted the houſe, by meſſage, that
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:0709200301:549"/>
Ireland was threatened with a French invaſion, under the late King. Four hundred and twenty thouſand pounds were voted to be levied by a monthly aſſeſſment; a ſum as inadequate for the ſervice of the kingdom, as it was beneath the expectations of the King<note n="K" place="bottom">Feb. 28.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">The <hi>Habeas corpus</hi> act ſuſpended.</note> Notwithſtanding the frugality of the commons, they exhibited an inſtance of extraordinary complaiſance to William. They wanted upon him in a body, with an offer of their lives and fortunes in ſupport of his alliances, in reducing Ireland, and in defending their religion and laws. Upon a meſſage from the King, they even con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to ſuſpend, by a temporary bill, the <hi>habeas corpus</hi> act, the chief bulwark of the liberties of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. James himſelf never preſumed to ſtop the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this ſalutary law, nor even demanded a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of it, by means of an obſequious parliament, when a double rebellion ſhook his kingdoms. The lords were ſtill more complaiſant than the commons. They ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the King, to take an extraordinary care of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in the preſent conjuncture. They deſired him to ſecure all diſaffected perſons; and they declared, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding an expreſs law to the contrary, that he might retain perſons ſo committed to the firſt day of the enſuing term. The commons, with ſome ſpirit, refuſed their concurrence to an addreſs that eſtabliſhed in the crown the diſpenſing power, which they had recently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. They ſent a bill to the upper houſe, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to their demand of a concurrence in their addreſs. The act of <hi>habeas corpus</hi> was ſuſpended, by an expreſs law, till the ſeventeenth of April, arming thus, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional way, the government with powers to protect itſelf.</p>

He urged that the latter could not be reduced without an immediate provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of an army of twenty thouſand men. Inſtead of granting immediately the demanded aid, the commons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, the next day, to bring in a bill for appropriating, for little more than three months, the revenue paid to James to the ſervice of the crown. The expence of the Dutch expedition was ſoon<note n="O" place="bottom">March 14.</note> after laid before the houſe. The ſum amounted to near ſeven hundred thouſand pounds. The commons granted but ſix hundred thouſand. They either thought the account unreaſonable, or they wiſhed to ſhew their own power. They exhibited the ſame fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality in their other grants. They provided but for ſix months for the army deſtined for Ireland. They gave ſcarce more than half the ſum demanded for the charge of the navy.

The royal Scotiſh regiment of horſe, and Dumbarton's regiment of foot, the command of which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred upon Schomberg, were ordered to Ipſwich, to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark for Holland, to replace the Dutch battalions that William choſe to keep in England.

The religious jealouſy, which had rouſed the Engliſh nation againſt James, prevailed with equal fervour, though not with equal juſtice, among the Scots. The ſeverities of the preceding reign had been very much mitigated, even before a general indulgence freed the adherents of the covenant from the animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the penal laws.

The civil affairs of Scotland were, in the mean time, tranſacted with unuſual mildneſs. The privy-council had ceaſed to be a board of inquiſition.—The laws were leſs frequently converted, by thoſe in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, into the means of gratifying either revenge or ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice. Commerce was encouraged, by the mercantile genius of James; and the people might have been happy under him, had they not been inflamed with a religious enthuſiaſm ſimilar to his own.

Though he joined ſome perſons of the Preſbyterian perſuaſion with his favourite ſect, in the adminiſtration of government, his conduct in that reſpect was aſcribed to
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:0709200301:557"/>
deſign. The people, in the abſence of flagrant oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, were ſilent. But their jealouſy of the King, and their rooted averſion to Papiſts, rendered them ripe for any change. Several Scotſmen, either perſecuted by government, or to pay their court to a Prince who ſeemed deſtined one day to mount the throne, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to Holland. Theſe, by their emiſſaries, inflamed the prejudices of the people, and kept alive their fears. The Prince of Orange diſperſed by their means his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration in Scotland. The zeal of the majority of the nation for the religious tenets of Calvin, had long pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over their attachment to the ancient line of their Kings. The Prince was of their own perſuaſion, a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which rendered him extremely popular. He had undertaken to deliver Scotland as well as England. He had diſavowed all ſelfiſh deſigns in his expedition. The news of his landing in England was proclaimed in the weſtern counties with the greateſt demonſtrations of joy. The army having marched by order to England, no power remained to repreſs the fury of the populace, or to protect the government. The perſons who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the regency were either hated or deſpiſed. Beſides, they had quarrelled among themſelves. The Marquis of Athol formed a party againſt the Earl of Perth, and forced him to reſign his office. To facilitate the views of the Prince of Orange, they reduced, by their own authority, the few troops that remained in Scotland. The populace, when this check was removed, became inſolent and outrageous; and the Marquis of Athol, who in ſome degree had raiſed the ſtorm, exerciſed a kind of government in the midſt of anarchy and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion<note n="D" place="bottom">Publications of the times.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Confuſion at Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh.</note> The Marquis, in the mean time, deeming that his deſigns were ripe, aſſembled the council. He propoſed a warm addreſs to the Prince of Orange; but it was rejected for one more moderate, by the majority. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in his views, he repaired to London. The remaining part of the council, under the protection of a few guards, who had not been diſbanded, aſſumed an appearance of authority. A kind of languid obedience was paid in the capital to their orders. The reſt of the
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:0709200301:558"/>

He arrived in that capital the day after James firſt withdrew himſelf from Whitehall. Defeated in the purpoſe of his journey, he applied to the Duke of Hamilton, a man of temporizing principles. The vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Duke for the Prince of Orange roſe in proportion to his opinion, that James was never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. He demanded from Balcarras the letter of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency to the King; and when his requeſt was refuſed, he left his Lordſhip and ſome other privy-counſellors in a rage. His raſhneſs upon the preſent occaſion was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by an inſtance of meanneſs. When the King unexpectedly returned to London, he endeavoured, thro' the mediation of the Lord Dundee, to be reconciled to the reſt of the lords. He excuſed in perſon his former paſſion, and offered his future ſervice. He even aſſiſted at the only council which James held at Whitehall after his return. But when that unfortunate Prince was ſent under a guard to Rocheſter, he reſumed his former zeal for the Prince of Orange<note n="E" place="bottom">Balcarras's Memoirs.</note>.</p>

Thirty peers and near eighty gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, then in London, waited, in the beginning of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary, on the Prince of Orange. Without any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the regency, ſtill ſubſiſting in Edinburgh, they formed themſelves into a kind of convention.

The Duke of Hamilton was unanimouſly choſen their preſident. He explained, in an extraordinary ſpeech, the diſtracted ſtate of Scotland.

The meeting however adjourned. When they reſumed the ſubject the next day, Sir Patrick Hume, encouraged by the contempt ſhewn to Arran's propoſal, arraigned his conduct. Hume's motion, however, was deemed officious and unneceſſary. The meeting adhered to their former advice to the Prince; and requeſted him to take into his hands the adminiſtration. They waited upon him in a body.

His adherents were either diſpirited by the ſtate of the times, or averſe from joining an aſſembly which they deemed illegal. The convention, however, met not without ſome apprehenſions for their own ſafety. The Duke of Gordon, a Roman catholic, ſtill held the caſtle of Edinburgh for the King. But, being a perſon of a timid character, they hoped to terrify him into a ſurrender of that fortreſs. The Duke of Hamilton and the Marquis of Athol, who had contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at London for William's favour, were now candi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates for the office of preſident of the convention.

One reſource ſtill remained to the royal party. The Archbiſhop of Glaſgow, the Earl of Balcarras, and the Viſcount Dundee, were authorized, by an inſtrument ſigned by James, then in Ireland, to call a convention of eſtates at Stirling. This meaſure was at firſt diſappointed by the wavering diſpoſition of the Marquis of Athol, and afterwards, by the delay and folly of the party. The Marquis had reſumed his loyalty to James, on account of diſappointments from William. He was, however, irreſolute and fluctuating in his conduct. The time of the departure of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aliſts was deferred. An accident effectuated it at laſt with an abruptneſs which diſconcerted all their views. The Viſcount Dundee, terrified with an information of a deſign formed by the covenanters to aſſaſſinate him, left Edinburgh, at the head of fifty horſe. When he paſſed under the walls of the caſtle, the Duke of Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don made a ſignal to call him to a conference. He ſcramoled up againſt a precipice, and informed the Duke of all his deſigns. He conjured him to hold out the caſtle, under a certainty of being relieved. The novelty of the ſight collected multitudes of ſpectators. The convention were alarmed. The preſident ordered the doors to be locked, the keys to be laid on the table.

The drums were beat to alarm the town. A parcel of ill-armed retainers were gathered together in the ſtreet by the Earl of Leven. Dundee, in the mean time, rode off with his party. But when they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſecure, the Duke of Hamilton adjourned the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, which relieved the adherents of James from dreadful apprehenſions for their own ſafety.

The Earl of Tyrconnel, having, by corrupt means, obtained the intereſt of Sunderland<note n="Q" place="bottom">James II. Mem. of Ireland.</note>, was raiſed, in the year 1687, to the government of that kingdom. Tyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connel was a man of profligate abilities, violent in his temper, and, through ſaction more than religion, a bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotted Roman-catholic. His arrival in Ireland was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with a general conſternation among the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, and an intemperate joy among the Popiſh party. The firſt dreaded a renewal of all the violence of former times. The latter, who formed a great majority of the nation, hoped to regain the importance of which they deemed themſelves unjuſtly deprived. The new lord-deputy ſeemed, by his conduct, to juſtify, in a great meaſure, the prior opinions of the people concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his principles. Having received, on the twelfth of February, 1687, the ſword of ſtate from the Earl of Clarendon, he entered upon the exerciſe of his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The army had already, in a great degree, been purged of the more obnoxious Proteſtants. The next meaſure was to place the civil power in the hands of Papiſts. The admiſſion of that ſect into the ſeveral cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations proceeded languidly under the government of Clarendon; who, though a ſubmiſſive royaliſt, was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

The Earl of Caſtlemain had fixed his views on the government of Ireland; and both he and his party found means to convey the miſmanagements of the lord-deputy to the King. Tyrconnel was again alarmed. To gain the favour of James through the channel of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, he offered to his conſideration a ſcheme, which, though wild, unjuſt, and dangerous, ſeemed calculated to eſtabliſh his views. He propoſed to call a parliament, which, in conſequence of the late uſurpations on the charters of corporations, muſt have proved entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to government. Under the plauſible pretence of relieving ſome diſtreſſed and really injured Papiſts, a bill was framed, which ſhould artfully deſtroy the whole ſettlement of the kingdom. To gain his protection and aſſent to the bill, he complimented the King with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of almoſt all the lands in Ireland. The lord chief baron Rice, who had formed the ſcheme, was, with others, commiſſioned to lay it before the Engliſh coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil.

The majority of the lords preſent, and even the Catholics argued with great vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence againſt the meaſure. Sunderland and Petre, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that the current was changed, remained ſilent. The Iriſh commiſſioners were diſmiſſed with contempt by the council.

In this ſituation affairs continued during the greateſt part of the memorable year 1688. A reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an intention of altering the acts of ſettlement, mentioned by ſome writers, is neither well authenticated nor probable. When the Prince of Orange landed in England, the terrors of the Proteſtants were transferred to the Papiſts. Though they firſt affected to deſpiſe both the Prince and his invaſion, the accounts of his ſucceſs and the misfortunes of James induced them to change their tone. Inſtead of perſecuting the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants, they endeavoured, by acts of friendſhip, to gain their protection. Tyrconnel himſelf deſcended from his pride to flattery. He boaſted of the impartiality of his own government. The truth is, though he has been accuſed of tyranny, few authentic facts have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to juſtify the charge. His manner was more blameable than his meaſures. In perpetual fears of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuperſeded, he obſerved, in general, a conduct more cautious than could have been expected from his politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal principles, and the known violence of his natural diſpoſition<note n="Z" place="bottom">MS. 1688.</note>.</p>

The Proteſtants were terrified at the proſpect of another maſſacre. The Papiſts expected every day to be invaded by the joint force of the Engliſh and Dutch. But the terrors of the Roman Catholics were ill-ſounded. A ſtrange neglect prevailed in the counſels of the Prince of Orange, with regard to Ireland. Though Tyrconnel ſent ſeveral meſſages to the Prince, that he was ready to deliver the kingdom to any ſorce that might render a ſurrender decent, his offers were rejected. William was perſuaded by the Marquis of Halifax, that ſhould Ireland yield, no pretence could remain for keeping an army in pay; that ſhould he have no army to protect

Theſe inſidious arguments, combining with William's determined reſolution to retain by force what he had received by an appearance of choice, encouraged in his mind that neglect of Ireland, which is juſtly deemed one of the greateſt blemiſhes of his reign. His enemies, but perhaps with no good reaſon, aſſign a worſe cauſe for his negligence. He knew, ſay they, that ſhould England be confirmed under his government, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land could not long reſiſt his arms; and that, in the mean time, the obſtinacy of his Iriſh enemies would give a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence for forfeitures to gratify his Engliſh, and eſpecially his foreign friends<note n="B" place="bottom">Publications of the times.</note>.</p>

The whole regular force of Ireland ſeemed very inadequate to ſuch a hazardous undertaking. The army conſiſted only of four thouſand men. Not above ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of theſe were in Dublin. Their own ſafety prevailed over their attachment to the King. They ſeemed all wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to quit the ſervice. The lord-deputy iſſued new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions for levying forces. Theſe were indiſcriminately granted to all. An half-armed rabble, rather than an army, roſe ſuddenly in various parts of the kingdom. Without any pay from the King, they affected to appear in his ſervice. Diſcipline was little regarded. Thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileged marauders ſupported themſelves with a ſpecies of depredation. A falſe information of a maſſacre gained credit, from the violences committed by the new levies. The Proteſtants in the North of Ireland, who had before prepared to oppoſe the government, now armed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their own defence. The city of Londonderry, relying on its ſituation and a ſlight wall, ſhut its gates againſt the new raiſed troops of the King. Tyrconnel was diſconcerted by this unexpected oppoſition. He diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched the Lord Mountjoy, who was a Proteſtant, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the refractory city. His Lordſhip was received as a friend, rather than an enemy.

James, in the mean time, prepared himſelf for an expedition into that kingdom, by the aſſiſtance of France. Lewis the Fourteenth furniſhed that unfortunate Prince with an aid better calculated to continue for ſome time, than to finiſh ſuddenly the war.

Twelve hundred of his native ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, in the pay of France, and one hundred French of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, compoſed the whole army of James. The Count de Lauzun was intended for the chief command. But, through ſome diſguſt, he declined to accept of that honour. The Mareſchal de Roſen, a German by birth, was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in his place. James ſailed from Breſt on the ſeventh of March.

One part of theſe ſupplies was furniſhed by the department of M. de Luvois; the other, by that of Seignelai. Each ſent his own commiſſaries, who were only accountable to their principals for their diſburſements. James formed a kind of cabinet-council at Kinſale, into which D'Avaux, the ambaſſador of France, was admitted. He ordered the Iriſh officers, particularly Sir Thomas Nugent, the lord chief juſtice, and the Lord Mount-Caſhel, who had come to receive him, to lay before him the ſtate of Ireland. They magnified the ſervices of the Lord-deputy. They repreſented the zeal and loyalty of the native Iriſh. They affirmed, that, by means of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions promiſcuouſly given by Tyrconnel, one hundred thouſand men were already in arms. They aſcribed the inactivity of William to his fears from their own pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations.

They, however, owned that great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies had proceeded from their meaſures. The troops, they ſaid, having had no pay, were forced to live on the people. Terror, they allowed, and a degree of tyranny, prevailed. The diſarming of the Proteſtants, they ſaid, though a neceſſary meaſure, increaſed the inſolence and injuſtice of the Catholics, who deemed themſelves juſtified, upon this change of fortune, to render back thoſe ill-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices which they had formerly received at their hands.

In a committee of the whole houſe, they proceeded, on the third of Auguſt, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſtate of the nation. They reſolved, that there had been unaccountable delays in ſending a neceſſary aid to Ireland. That adequate preparations had not been made for ſending a force into that kingdom, and that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſhips had fallen into the hands of the enemy, for want of a ſufficient protection from government. The lords exhibited ſymptoms of the ſame vehemence. They had appointed a committee of inquiry. They applied for leave to inſpect the minutes of the council. But, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the apparent ill-humour of both houſes, they avoided to proceed to extremities. Miniſters were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed, but not puniſhed. Officers, who had been proved to have neglected their duty, eſcaped without cenſure.

They paſſed from the affairs of Ireland to the ſettlement of the revenue, and to the completing the bill of indem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Neither, however, was finiſhed in the preſent ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The exceptions made in the bill of indemnity were ſo extenſive, that they comprehended half the people in England. Violent debates aroſe upon the ſubject. But the ſettlement of the revenue engroſſed the greateſt part of the King's attention. He expreſſed with greateſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence his deſire of having the revenue of his predeceſſor ſettled upon him for life. The jealouſy of many prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the accompliſhment of his deſire. The fullenneſs of his diſpoſition was known to ſeveral. The imperiouſneſs of his character was perhaps exaggerated by all. The Whigs were afraid, that to make him independent, was to render his government arbitrary; and thoſe who adher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſecret to the late King, wiſhed to make the reigning Prince uneaſy upon his throne.

                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note> The party who had raiſed William to the throne were the moſt forward in their oppoſition to the meaſure of rendering him independent. They have been, without any ſufficient reaſon, highly blamed upon this ſubject.—The exigencies of the times were great. But the ſums already granted were ample. William himſelf complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of want of permanency in the revenue, more than of the inſufficiency of the aids received. The money voted ſince the beginning of the ſeſſion, exceeded, by more than one third, the receipts of any whole year in the two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding reigns. An appearance of an appropriation of the ſupplies to particular ſervices offended the King, as it ſeemed to inſinuate a diſtruſt of his conduct. A new conſtitution was, however, to be eſtabliſhed. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons were certainly excuſable, in continuing the depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of the crown, till the rights of the ſubject ſhould be eſtabliſhed on a permanent and ſolid foundation. There is, however, reaſon to conclude, that the King's private conduct obſtructed the completion of his wiſhes, more than the public ſpirit of the commons. He loved not the company of his ſubjects. He neither flattered their favourite prejudices, nor mixed in their amuſements.—He even quitted London when queſtions of the utmoſt

importance were agitated in parliament. He paſſed his time at Hampton-Court in a ſtate of retired inactivity, which bordered upon abſolute indolence. Few had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to his perſon; and thoſe that were admitted were obliged to make allowances for his diſpoſition, in recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling their reception to their pride. He was compared, with great diſadvantage, to both his uncles. Charles and James lived in the intimacy of equals with their ſubjects. Though their conduct as ſovereigns was almoſt uniform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blamed, they were always irreprehenſible in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour as gentlemen<note n="Z" place="bottom">Publications of the times.</note>.</p>

Parliament adjourned.</note> Diſſatisfied with the conduct of the commons, harraſſed with the conteſts between the two houſes, offended at their complaints againſt his own conduct with regard to Ireland, William put an end, by adjournment, to the ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, on the twentieth of Auguſt. But though neither houſe had the good fortune to pleaſe the King, their meaſures ſeemed uniformly favourable to the late ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the crown. They renewed the averſion of the people againſt the bad meaſures of the two laſt reigns, by reverſing unpopular attainders and illegal judgments—The blood of Ruſſel, Sidney, Mrs. Liſle, and Alderman Corniſh, was reſtored; and all the proceedings and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords concerning their trials were ordered to be cancelled. Exorbitant fines impoſed in the preceding reigns were vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed illegal. Money extorted by Jefferys, the late chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, who died on the 18th of April in the Tower, was charged, with intereſt, upon his eſtate. The noted Otes was remembered on this occaſion. The judgments againſt him were reverſed. He himſelf was recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the King, and gratified with an ample penſion.—The unfortunate Duke of Monmouth was the only one forgot of the whole party. Though urged to his ruin by the preſent King<note n="A" place="bottom">D'Avaux.</note>, and ſeduced by the prevailing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, his memory and his children were neglected. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam himſelf ſeemed willing to preclude the latter from the favour which was on others liberally beſtowed.

eleventh of May, the commiſſioners appointed by the convention, with a cavalcade of moſt of the Scotiſh no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and gentry then reſiding in London, were intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the King and Queen at Whitehall. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King a letter from the ſtates, the inſtrument of government, a paper containing a liſt of grievances to be redreſſed, and an addreſs for converting the conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a parliament. Theſe papers were ſucceſſively read, and William made a ſuitable reply. The corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-oath was then tendered to the King by the Earl of Argyle. A ſcruple expreſſed by William to a clauſe of the oath, which ſeemed to infer religious perſecution, has been recorded to his honour. William, in his diſpoſal of places in Scotland, paid attention to his own friends.—The convention of ſtates being turned into a parliament, the Duke of Hamilton was appointed commiſſioner.—The Lord Melvin, a perſon of a ductile and eaſy temper, but of mean parts, received the ſeals as ſecretary of ſtate.—The Viſcount Stair was reſtored to the office of lord pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident of the court of ſeſſion. His ſon, Sir John Dalrym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, was appointed lord advocate. Stair, on whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice the King chiefly depended in Scotiſh affairs, was as ſingular in his character as in the fortune of his life. A man of conſiderable, but profligate abilities, he had raiſed himſelf from an obſcure degree, by the means of his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poriſing talents. During fifty years of his life, he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in every thing with every government. He mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with accuteneſs the changes of the times, and ran dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terouſly down the current. True to no principle but his own intereſt, he caballed with every party, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed all. He fought againſt Charles the Firſt in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary office. In a civil capacity, he abetted with zeal and eagerneſs the moſt arbitrary meaſures of his ſon.

their object, than the Scots had reaſon to expect from a Prince on whom they voluntarily conferred the crown. The lords of the articles had been long deemed deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the firſt principles of a free parliament; yet the abolition of that inſtitution could not be obtained from the King. The ill humours of the parliament were, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſuppreſſed for ſome time, on account of the dangers which threatened the new government. The caſtle of Edinburgh was ſtill kept, in the name of James, by the Duke of Gordon: but, deſpairing of any relief, and preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſiege, he ſurrendered the place, upon honourable terms, on the thirteenth of June. The adherents of the late King, terrified with this unexpected misfortune, now turned their eyes to the Viſcount Dundee. That noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, having been urged in vain to return to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, was publickly declared a fugitive, an outlaw, and a rebel, by that aſſembly. Driven by his enemies, and incited by his own native ardour, he reſolved to defend himſelf by force of arms. Apprized of a deſign laid by General Mackay to take him by ſurpriſe, he retired to the Grampian mountains, with a few horſe. He march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from thence to Gordon caſtle, where he was joined by the Earl of Dunfermling, with fifty gentlemen. He paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the county of Murray to Inverneſs.

He propoſed immediately to march in ſearch of Mackay; but Mackdonald and his followers choſe firſt to return home with their ſpoil. Dundee was forced to yield. He accompanied them to Lochaber. He arrived, on the eighth of May, in Badenoch. He ſent letters from thence to the chiefs of all the clans. He appointed them to meet, at a general rendezvous in Lochaber, on the 18th of the ſame month. He reſolved to fill the intermediate time with action. Mackay, with his army, had arrived at Inverneſs. Dundee, paſſing ſuddenly through Athol, ſurpriſed the town of Perth. In hopes of gaining to his party the two troops of Scotiſh dragoons who lay at Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee,
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:0709200301:582"/>
he marched ſuddenly to that place: but the fidelity of Captain Balfour, who commanded them, diſappointed his views. Having raiſed the land-tax from the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants as he paſſed, Dundee returned through Athol and Rannoch to Lochaber, to hold the diet of rendezvous.—Macdonald of Glengary, Macdonald of Morer, Stewart of Appin, and Macdonald of Glenco, joined him with their followers on the day appointed. In a few days, Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meron of Lochiel, with ſix hundred men, and Macdonald of Keppoch, with two hundred, arrived in the camp of Dundee. His army now conſiſted of fifteen hundred men. With theſe he took the way of Badenoch. He forced the caſtle of Ruthven, with its garriſon of fifty Grants. Mackay, who was on his march to Ruthven, retreated upon the approach of Dundee. Colonel Ramſay, who was paſſing through Athol, with a conſiderable reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to join Mackay, fled back to Perth; and Mackay himſelf, having been purſued in vain by Dundee for four days, advanced to Strathbogy, and left the whole High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands expoſed to the enemy<note n="D" place="bottom">MS. 1689.</note>.</p>

They informed him, that a party of Iriſh, who had endeavoured to land in Scotland, under the Duke of Berwick, were driven back, and the Duke himſelf taken priſoner. Beſides, Mackay had been reinforced with a regiment of Engliſh horſe, and another of foot. Dundee, upon receiving this intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, retreated to Badenoch.

But ſtill he had ſcarce any thing but men for proſecuting the war. The Highlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were armed only with their own proper weapons. He had but forty pound weight of powder in his whole army. Without cannon, without tents, without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, deſtitute of money, and even poſſeſſing no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to command for the late King, his active ſpirit ſurmounted all difficulties, and communicated to others his own fire. He gained the affections of a proud and ignorant populace, by his attention to their very preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices. He repreſſed the jarring intereſts and jealouſies of the better ſort, by the authority of his character, and their high opinion of his courage and ſkill in war. His very name reminded his followers of the gallant Montroſe. They ſaw in him what their fathers had told them of the chief of his family; and they tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to their preſent commander their enthuſiaſtic zeal for a former leader, who had covered their arms with ſo much ſucceſs and renown. Dundee was not of a diſpoſition that would permit this ſpirit to languiſh in a ſtate of inactivity. Events daily aroſe which hurried him to action. The Lord Murray, ſon of the Marquis of Athol, laid ſiege to the caſtle of Blair, held by ſome of the adherents of King James. Sir Alexander Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lean, then on an expedition in Cromar, by Dundee's orders, marched againſt Murray, and raiſed the ſiege. But Mackay was on his way to attack the place. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee, reinforced by three hundred Iriſh, under Colonel Cannon, by forced marches, arrived in Athol on the ſixteenth of July.

The tents, baggage, artillery, and proviſions of the enemy, and even King William's Dutch ſtandard, which was carried by Mackay's regiment, fell into the hands of the Highlanders. The victory was now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete. But the Highlanders loſt their gallant leader. Perceiving the unexpected reſiſtance of Colonel Haſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's regiment, and the confuſion of the Macdonalds, Dundee rode rapidly to the left wing. As he was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his arm, and pointing to the Camerons to advance, he received a ball in his ſide. He, however, ſurvived the battle, and wrote a letter to King James, giving an account of the victory<note n="I" place="bottom">MS. Letter, 1689.</note>.

He had named the lords of ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by an act of prerogative, though the appointing judges in the ſame manner had been one of his own charges againſt the late King. He had broken through the whole conſtitution of the college of juſtice. In caſes of partial vacancies in the court of ſeſſion, it had been uſual for the King to nominate; and the other lords were to examine, and at pleaſure reject or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove. The vacancy declared in the throne had made a total vacancy on the bench. The parliament claimed
<pb n="557" facs="tcp:0709200301:587"/>
the power, which they had exerciſed at the reſtoration of monarchy, to examine, and to reject or receive the judges. William, to ſupport his prerogative, was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to adopt a meaſure in itſelf abſurd. He continued ſuch a number of the late King's judges as were ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to examine thoſe whom he wiſhed to promote. A bill was brought in, which aſſerted the total vacancy of the bench. It was provided in this act, that the nomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation ſhould be in the crown, and the approbation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in parliament.

James, reſolving to head his army in the North, left Dublin on the eighth of April. The Proteſtant inſurgents, having ruined the country in their retreat, retired, upon his approach, to Derry and the other ſide of the river Finn. But James was in no condition to take advantage of the flight of his enemies. His troops were deſtitute of pay, without diſcipline, and without arms. One half of the ſoldiers were armed with pikes. The other half had muſkets, but utterly unfit for ſervice. He had ordered, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out effect, the Duke of Tyrconnel, and De Pontis, the French agent, to haſten the arms and ammunition to the North. He, however, advanced toward Derry, deriving hopes of the ſurrender of that place from the apparent fears of the Proteſtants. But the enemy ſeemed reſolved to diſpute the paſſage of the river Finn. The King detached Hamilton to Strabane, and the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis de Puſignian and the Duke of Berwick, with half their detachment, to Cladiford, four miles above that place. James himſelf remained, in the mean time, at Omi. Hamilton, Puſignian, and Berwick, joined their troops.

But Roſen, contrary to the King's inclination<note n="S" place="bottom">James II. 1686.</note>, ſurrounded the town with his ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, within the diſtance of half a cannon-ſhot from the wall. A trumpet was ſent to ſummon Derry. The townſmen promiſed to ſend an anſwer in ten hours. But Roſen continuing ſtill to advance, the inſurgents fired upon his men, and the treaty was interrupted. James, provided with nothing neceſſary for a ſiege, returned the ſecond day after his arrival, with Roſen, toward Dublin. Maumont was left before Derry in the chief command. But the precipitate motions of Roſen were not the cauſe of the change of opinion in the inhabitants of Derry. Two Engliſh regiments, under the command of the Colonels Cuningham and Richards, had arrived, a few days before, in Lake Foyle, upon which the town is ſituated. Lundy, who commanded in the place, was either ſwayed by treachery or fear. Without permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the men to land, he ordered the officers to come to a council of war. They ſoon agreed, that the town was not tenable. Their reſolutions were communicated to the magiſtrates, and they reſolved to offer terms to the King. The Engliſh regiments prepared to return. The populace were alarmed. Tumult, clamour, and confuſion aroſe. The governor and magiſtrates loſt all authority. Some deſperate perſons flew to the walls. They turned their cannon againſt the enemy, and fired. The garriſon choſe two governors; Walker, a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and one Major Baker. Their whole force con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted of ſeven thouſand men and three hundred and fifty officers; with which they reſolved to hold the town to the laſt extremity<note n="T" place="bottom">Walker's Diary.</note>.</p>

They made a ſally, the day after the King's departure, with three thouſand foot and three ſquadrons of horſe. They poſted their horſe upon the ſtrand. With their foot they lined the hedges, a little further advanced on the left. M. de Maumont, contemning the enemy, placed himſelf at the head of his advanced guard of forty troopers; and, with the other general officers as volunteers, charged, on full gallop, the horſe of Derry. He received the whole fire of the foot as he paſſed. But the ſhock, notwithſtanding, put the enemy in diſorder. Four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of his foot advancing in the mean time, he led them to the inſurgents. An obſtinate combat enſued. Maumont was killed by the firſt fire.

The Marquis de Puſignian died, a few days after, of the wounds he received in this action. The blockade of Derry, in the mean time continued. The hopes of James reſted upon the ſcarcity of proviſions, which threatened already to create a famine in the town. He was not however, idle in Dublin. Such troops as could be armed filed off by his orders toward the North. The French fleet having landed ſome ſtores in Bantry-Bay, he expected to finiſh ſoon the ſiege by their aid.

equalled the ſuppoſed greatneſs of their aid. D'Avaux, as ambaſſador of France, exerted a kind of tyranny over a Prince whom he pretended to ſupport. He was the declared enemy of the Proteſtants. His object was leſs to reſtore James, than to protract the war. The violence of the Roman Catholics roſe in proportion to their ſucceſs. In their zeal for their own intereſts, they paid little regard to thoſe of their unfortunate King. James had recommended ſome means of relief to the ſufferers by the acts of ſettlement; but the commons received a bill for the total repeal of theſe acts with a kind of barbarous joy. To a law which ſubverted the whole property of Ireland, James was forced, by the inſtances of D'Avaux and the violence of his parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, much againſt his own inclination<note n="B" place="bottom">James II. 1689.</note>, to aſſent. This impolitic and precipitate meaſure was followed by others equally unjuſt and violent. The parliament paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a general bill of attainder, which contained more than two thouſand perſons of all orders and degrees. The Iriſh in the ſervice of King William, the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants who left the kingdom, thoſe who returned not on the proclamation of King James, many whoſe ordinary reſidence was in Britain, were attainted of high treaſon, and ſubjected to the pains of death and forfeiture, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they ſurrendered themſelves to trial by a certain day. This act encroached upon the prerogative of the King. He was precluded from the power of pardoning, after the firſt day of the ſucceeding November. Neither James nor the perſons affected knew the whole extent of this rigorous bill. The act was kept concealed in the cuſtody of the chancellor. The King, four months after, learned by an accident the force of a law which ſo much intrenched on his own prerogative<note n="C" place="bottom">Ibid.

To render Ireland totally independent of England, was an object which occupied the next care of this violent parliament. They declared, by an expreſs bill, that the Engliſh parliament had no power to bind Ireland; and
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:0709200301:594"/>
that writs of error or appeal ſhould be no longer proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted in England. They paſſed a bill for a general li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of conſcience. They recalled the proviſions ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled on miniſters in towns corporate. They appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated to the Popiſh clergy the eccleſiaſtical dues and tythes payable by perſons of their own perſuaſion. Notwithſtanding the bigotry of James, he was far from being pleaſed with the violent proceedings of the Roman Catholic party. Oppreſſed by the importunities of his ſubjects, intimidated by D'Avaux, who threatened to retire to France, in caſe of the King's refuſal to gratify the Papiſts, he yielded, in a degree inconſiſtent with his declarations. He, however, ſhewed at length ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the Engliſh intereſt. He refuſed to conſent to the repeal of Poyning's law. He would not permit inns of court, for the education of law-ſtudents, to be eſtabliſhed in Ireland. This obſtinacy, as it was called by his enemies, eſtranged from him the minds of the more violent Papiſts. Beſides, a faction, headed by the Duke of Tyrconnel, were in cloſe correſpondence with the court of France. They knew that James deſigned only to paſs through their country to his other domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. They were afraid that the averſion which he had already diſcovered to the independence of Ireland, might induce him, ſhould he happen to be reſtored, to ſubvert the violent regulations which they had already made. Some even formed a project of reſigning the ſovereignty of their country to Lewis the Fourteenth. Their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of the conduct of their ſovereign at the court of France, eſtabliſhes ſome kind of proof of this fact. James was peculiarly unfortunate. He was charged by the Proteſtants of violence in favour of the Papiſts: he was accuſed by the Papiſts of too much lenity to the Proteſtants<note n="D" place="bottom">MS. 1689.</note>.</p>

The ſcanty ſums remitted from France had been committee to the management of D'Avaux, by his own court. The King was obliged to ſolicit that miniſter for the money which his neceſſities required. He was ever
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:0709200301:595"/>
obliged to ſatisfy the ambaſſador with regard to the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice for which he demanded any ſupply. But had the diſburſement been more free, the remittances were alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether inadequate to the neceſſities of the unfortunate King. The rabble, which had gone under the name of an army, had been hitherto ſupported by their officers, or fed by depredation. The funds of the officers were at length exhauſted. The country itſelf could bear no longer the riot and injuſtice of the ſoldiers. Preſſed with theſe difficulties, King James, by the advice of his council, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to coin pieces of copper, which ſhould be received for ſilver. He foreſaw the inconveniencies of this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure<note n="E" place="bottom">MS. 1689. James II. 1689.</note>. But all Ireland poſſeſſed not the means of paying the army, in current coin, to the middle of the month of June<note n="F" place="bottom">MS. Journal, 1689.</note>. Two hundred thouſand livres remained only of the French remittances; and the King found it abſolutely neceſſary to reſerve that ſum, to forward his meaſures with regard to Britain, and to procure intelligence of the motions of his enemies. The army was ſatisfied with even this appearance of money. The people received this fictitious coin, in hopes of being repaid in a more favourable ſtate of affairs. A tax of twenty thouſand pounds a-month, granted for thirteen months by the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, furniſhed the government with an appearance of reſources. The King, in the mean time, endeavoured to ſupport the former revenue. He opened a trade with France, to ſupply the want of commerce with England.

Diſaffected perſons were ſeized every where. He omitted nothing neceſſary for the ſecurity of his perſon, or the defence of the kingdom. He applied for the ſuccours from France. He endeavoured to ſhew ſpirit and reſolution in public; but he was privately in ſlaviſh ſubjection to D'Avaux and de Roſen. They joined with the moſt violent of the Iriſh Papiſts againſt the King. Diſcontent, faction, and malice prevailed in his court. The adherents of Tyrconnel, the Iriſh of the ancient race, expreſſed the utmoſt reſentment againſt James's lenity to the Proteſtants, his partiality to his Britiſh ſubjects, his oppoſing the repeal of Poyning's law, his reſolution to keep Ireland in its former dependance on England<note n="T" place="bottom">MS. letter of Melfort.</note>. D'Avaux, a man of an intriguing diſpoſition, inflamed their diſcontents, and added to their jealouſy. They en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a cloſe correſpondence with him, and, by means of one Biſhop Malony, at Paris, with M. de Louvois, with regard to a propoſal to transfer their allegiance from James to ſome other Catholic Prince, able and willing to ſupport them againſt the uſurpations of the Engliſh.

He opened four batteries againſt the place. He attacked it with the guns of the fleet. One thouſand bombs were thrown into the town. The houſes were laid in aſhes. The garriſon, having expended their powder to the laſt barrel, marched out, on the ninth day, with all the honours of war. But the ſoldiers broke the capitulation.

Schomberg encamped in the neighbourhood of that place. The inacceſſibleneſs of the country thro' which he had marched had hitherto prevented all attempts from the enemy. But the country before him was plain. The cavalry of the enemy might cut off his communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the fleet, which had not yet arrived, as he had directed, in the road of Carlingford. He himſelf laboured under every ſpecies of military diſtreſs. His troops were raw and undiſciplined. Diſeaſe had crept into his camp. He was in want of proviſions.

He advanced on the ſixteenth of September to within three miles of Dundalk. Anxious for a battle, he viewed in perſon the intrenchments of the enemy on the eighteenth. But he found that Schomberg, by forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying himſelf in Dundalk, ſeemed leſs to prepare for bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle than for a ſiege. On the twentieth of September, James advanced with his whole army near the lines of the enemy, and endeavoured in vain to provoke them to fight. He ſtood three hours in order of battle before Dundalk. But Schomberg kept within his intrenchments; and the King, diſappointed for the preſent in his hopes of ending the campaign with an engagement, retired ſlowly to his camp. Deſpairing of being able to allure the enemy to the field, he ordered Atherdee to be fortified, that he might with more advantage begin the enſuing campaign. The majority of his council of war declared themſelves againſt this meaſure.

The ſoldiers, uninured to hardſhips, were ſickly and diſpirited. The officers negligent, indolent, and ignorant of war. He laboured under a want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. A great part of the arms of the ſoldiers were unfit for ſervice. He poſſeſſed neither carts nor waggons. His men were without ſhoes, and many of them in want of clothes. But the loſs ſuſtained by ſickneſs was greatly exaggerated by thoſe who defended the Duke's conduct. Beſides, the Iriſh army was difficult of acceſs, when Schomberg, by reinforcements from England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, was enabled to puſh his operations with any proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſucceſs. The country was full of ſwamps and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files. James lay in an advantageous poſition, behind a river; and his troops had acquired ſome confidence and diſcipline in their motions, in the view of the enemy.—He, however, laboured under many of the ſame diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages with Schomberg. Though his army greatly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the invaders in number, ſcarce one half were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely armed; and he found as much inconvenience in receiving his proviſions from Dublin, as Schomberg felt from the uncertain ſupplies which he derived from the Engliſh fleet<note n="D" place="bottom">Schomberg's letters to William.</note>. The two armies retired, as it were, with mutual conſent, to their winter quarters. No action worthy of remembrance happened in Ireland.

                  <note place="margin">Foreign affairs.</note> The war on the continent was more ſingular in itſelf than remarkable for great events during the preſent cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign. Almoſt all Europe having combined againſt France, ſeemed to threaten that kingdom with invaſion, and even with conqueſt. Lewis the Fourteenth, truſting to his great reſources, prepared himſelf to repel with vigour the ſtrom which he had impurdently raiſed. He formed two armies in Flanders. He oppoſed a third in Catalonia to the Spaniards. To make a barrier on the ſide of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, he laid waſte, in a cruel manner, the Palatinate.

But, with near four hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men in the field, he found himſelf outnumbered by his enemies. Eleven thouſand Engliſh troops, being thoſe whoſe fidelity King William could not truſt, led by the Earl of Marlborough, increaſed to forty thouſand men the army of the States of Holland, under the Prince of Waldec. The Germanic body, united under the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, oppoſed their force to France. The Elector of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varia commanded an army on the Upper Rhine. The main army, conſiſting of the Imperialiſts and Saxons, was led by the Duke of Lorrain. The Elector of Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburgh, with his native forces and the troops of Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phalia, appeared on the Lower Rhine.</p>

An undeciſive action happened at length at Walcourt.—The French were forced to quit their ground with loſs. But the Prince obtained none of thoſe advantages with which victory is uſually crowned. He was forced a few days after the battle to repaſs the Sambre; and ſuffered himſelf to be challenged to an engagement in his turn. Upon the whole, the campaign was unſucceſsful on the

ſide of the French. They had loſt ſeveral places of great importance. Fortune declared againſt them in the only battle that was fought during the ſeaſon. In Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonia they were not more fortunate than in Flanders. They were driven back to their own borders by the Duke de Villa Hermoſa. That general, purſuing the Mareſchal de Noailles, laid Rouſſillon under contribution; and he afterwards retook the town of Campredon in ſight of the French army. The ſame bad fortune which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to perſecute France, fell with ſtill greater weight on her friends. The Prince of Baden, who commanded for the Emperor, on the ſide of Hungary, defeated the Turks in various actions. He forced their intrenchments on the banks of the Morava. He defeated them at Niſſa. He obtained a complete victory at Widin. The diverſion to the troops of the Emperor, which had been expected from the Ottomans, was diſappointed; and France was forced to rely on her own arms.</p>

                  <note place="margin">State of the nation.</note> THE ſucceſs of William in the firſt compaign of his reign was neither anſwerable to the expectations of the nation, nor adequate to the ſupplies granted by parliament. His fleet had been worſted at ſea by an enemy, whoſe power on that element had been hitherto deſpiſed. His army at land had been defeated by a few half-armed irregulars, who carried nothing fit for war, except courage, to the field. While the Engliſh and Dutch navies lay, with diſeaſed crews, in a ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>activity on the coaſt of France, the narrow ſeas ſwarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the privateers of the enemy, who interrupted the trade of the kingdom, and enriched themſelves with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity. The efforts againſt James in Ireland were ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed firſt by unaccountable delays; and they were
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:0709200301:606"/>
afterwards rendered ineffectual, either through the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice or negligence of the ſervants of the crown. Theſe misfortunes, however, ought not wholly to be laid to the account of William. The unſettled ſtate of parties at home prevented him from giving ſufficient attention to affairs abroad. He was a ſtranger in the country in which he reigned. His miniſters were either ignorant, or employed in domeſtic faction. His army was new to action. His navy was ill-provided; and his own moroſe and ſullen temper had cooled in many their late zeal for his ſervice<note n="F" place="bottom">Burnet.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Several bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops refuſe the oaths.</note> Want of ſucceſs in his military operations was not the only circumſtances that rendered William uneaſy on his throne. During the interval of parliament, the oaths of allegiance to the new government were to be taken. Many of the clergy choſe rather to incur ſuſpenſion than to comply. Several leſs ſcrupulous took the oaths with a kind of temporizing reſerve. Five of the ſeven biſhops, whom James had committed to the Tower, were of the number of nonjurors. This powerful ſchiſm in the church diſturbed the King and diſtracted his government. The opinions of many of the people followed the ſcruples of the clergy. Surmiſes againſt William's attachment to the eſtabliſhed religion were propagated and received with ardour. The abolition of epiſcopacy in Scotland was produced as a proof even of his enmity to the church of England. He was accuſed of favouring moſt thoſe who were known to have the greateſt averſion to the mode of worſhip appointed by law. Theſe inſinuations had great weight with the church in general. In the two univerſities, eſpecially in Oxford, they were receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for matter of fact, without any diſpute. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of William in eccleſiaſtical affairs ſeemed to juſtify the whiſpers of his enemies<note n="G" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. Though the commons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected his ſcheme of a comprehenſion, he ſtill purſued that meaſure, with more zeal than any proſpect of ſucceſs.—He reſolved to call a convocation; and he iſſued a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to ten prelates and twenty inferior clergymen, to prepare ſuch an alteration in the book of canons as might induce Diſſenters to enter the pale of the church<note n="H" place="bottom">Gazette.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">William confirmed on the throne.</note> Notwithſtanding theſe diſcontents, William was now firmly ſettled upon the throne. The circumſtance which <pb n="577" facs="tcp:0709200301:607"/>
threw James into the hands of the Catholics in Ireland, proved evidently fatal to his hopes of recovering the crown of England. The violence of a Popiſh parliament was aſcribed to the enthuſiaſm of a Popiſh King. The breach upon the acts of ſettlement, the cruelties of De Roſen, the vehemence of D'Avaux, the complaints and real grievances of the Proteſtants, the miſeries of a civil war, in a country, where the contending parties were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed with religious zeal, were laid all to the account of James. Men could not diſtinguiſh between the name of authority and the poſſeſſion of power. They were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant that the unfortunate King had been ſubdued by his nominal friends, when he made a ſhew of reſiſtance to his enemies. In their certain knowledge of his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to the Romiſh faith, they diſtruſted all his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. The breaches made by others upon his declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in favour of the Proteſtants, were attributed to his own enthuſiaſm. They conſidered a man, whom cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity itſelf could not render moderate, too dangerous to be truſted again with authority. But ſtill King James continued to have many friends. His manner, his perſon, his diſpoſition, were compared with advantage to thoſe of the reigning Prince. His hereditary right to the throne ſtill ſwayed the minds of many; and ſeveral, who feared him in his proſperity, ſincerely pitied his uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon misfortunes.</p>

The Whigs and Tories, though enemies among themſelves, were unanimous where the crown was concerned. Their principles had yielded to their views, upon office. Each party hoped to gain an excluſive poſſeſſion of the King. Each came with its claim to the political field. The Whigs expected a return to the favours which they had already conferred. The Tories built their pretenſions on their attachment to monarchy, and the proſpect of future ſervices.

this great ſum were interrupted by diſputes between the parties. Men of Tory principles had already filled the moſt lucrative offices under the government. The Whigs propoſed, that all officers, civil and eccleſiaſtical, now in place, ſhould pay half a year's profits of their ſalaries and perquiſites toward the preſent ſupply. They moved, that the penalties incurred by all civil officers, in not taking the teſt in the late reign, ſhould be ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily levied, and applied to the ſame purpoſe.

They found that the army in that country laboured under a want of every neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary. They threw the whole blame upon one Shales, a commiſſary. But when they addreſſed the King, to know by whom Shales had been recommended to his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice<note n="Q" place="bottom">Nov. 27.</note>, he refuſed to give any anſwer.

They reſolved to grant the revenue but for one year. The ſupplies which they had voted were either in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves inſufficient for the ſervice, or charged on inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate funds. The Whigs, to whom William owed his throne, were ſevere upon his prerogative. Diſappointed in their views of an excluſive poſſeſſion of power, they founded an oppoſition to the crown upon ſpecious grounds. In reſtoring the corporations to their former rights, they endeavoured to animadvert upon thoſe who had been inſtrumental in ſurrendering the charters in the two laſt reigns. They incorporated together the bills of indemnity, and pains and penalties. They carried upon every occaſion their reſentment into paſt times; and, in wounding the influence of the Tories, attacked the power of the crown. William, with a paſſion not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural to Kings, deemed every encroachment upon the royal prerogative an injuſtice to himſelf. He perceived, that the Whigs had only ſuſpended the exertion of their principles to obtain the confidence of the King and the excluſive poſſeſſion of his favour. He reſolved to truſt the Tories, whoſe principles ſeemed to be more attached to the crown than to hereditary ſucceſſion. He, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, came to a reſolution to diſmiſs an aſſembly that had been returned at a time favourable to the opinions which oppoſed his authority. He came to the houſe of lords on the twenty-ſeventh of January, and prorogued the parliament to the ſecond of April. The prorogation, by putting an end to ſome favourite bills, diſconcerted and diſpleaſed the Whigs. But their aſtoniſhment was completed by a proclamation for a diſſolution, which was iſſued on the fixth of February. A new parliament

Such of the latter party as favoured the late King, exulted in a circumſtance, which threw a kind of diſgrace on thoſe who had contributed moſt to the Revolution. The Whigs were ſaid to ſuffer their principles to be ſul dued by their rage. They admitted the emiſſaries of the late King to their converſation<note n="Y" place="bottom">Burnet.</note>. They expreſſed their diſtruſt of the reigning Prince, and their averſion to his favourite, the Earl of Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land<note n="Z" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>. They gained the city of London, to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that they would advance no loans on the money-bills. They inſinuated, that the reſtoration of James would be not only eaſy, but even ſafe. A treaty was reported to have been ſettled with the late King, by the whole cabal. But this ſeems to have been one of the many fictions of party. The wrath of the Whigs was, however, equal to their diſappointment. They carried their complaints to the preſs. In animadverting upon the Tories, they taxed the King with ingratitude, as well as imprudence. Their arguments were as unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful as their plan of poſſeſſing an excluſive power. Having failed in paſſing the corporation-act, with the projected amendments, the court retained its influence in the new elections. Men of monarchical principles were generally returned to the new parliament. The city of London itſelf, alienated from the King by the Whigs, choſe Tories in the room of their former mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; and, in ſhort, the majority of the commons were ſaid to conſiſt of men at once averſe from the perſon of William, and to the Revolution which had placed him on the throne<note n="A" place="bottom">Ralph, Burnet</note>.</p>

The Earls of Monmouth and Warrington, and Sir Henry Capel, whoſe zeal in the late Revolution had been much diſtinguiſhed, were diſmiſſed from the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury. Sir John Lowther, under the patronage of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermarthen, was appointed firſt commiſſioner; and Hampden, accommodating his principles to his intereſt, was made chancellor and under-treaſurer of the Exche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer. To this victory over their political opponents the Tories added a conſiderable advantage of another kind. The lieutenancy of London was placed in the hands of thoſe who had held it in the reign of James. Compton, Biſhop of London, who had been a Whig againſt James, became a Tory to William. Having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived orders to form a liſt, he filled it with the names of the moſt violent churchmen and Tories. The Whigs exclaimed with vehemence againſt this manifeſt partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity againſt their party.

Sir John Trevor, a Tory in principle and a man of political courage and addreſs, was choſen ſpeaker by the commons. He promiſed to the King to manage his own party, provided he might be furniſhed with money to purchaſe votes. William was too eager to carry hiw own favourite ſchemes in parliament, to refuſe<note n="D" place="bottom">Burnet.</note> his conſent to a propoſal, which neceſſity itſelf can ſcarcely juſtify. In his ſpeech, he told the two houſes, that he continued his reſolution of paſſing into Ireland. He depended, he ſaid, on their chearful concurrence in reducing that kingdom, a work ſo neceſſary for their own ſafety. He deſired them forthwith to make a ſettlement of the revenue, which he was willing to convert into a fund of credit to raiſe ready-money for the war. He reminded them of the earneſtneſs with which he had recommended an act of indemnity to the laſt parliament. But, to prevent the renewal of tedious debates, when the public bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs required ſo much diſpatch, he promiſed to ſend them an act of grace, with the exceptions of a few perſons by name. He recommended unanimity in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.

He infinuated his deſire of an union with Scotland. He concluded with informing the two houſes with his reſolution to leave the adminiſtration of the government in the hands of the Queen, during his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in Ireland; and he left it to themſelves to conſider, whether an act of parliament ſhould be neceſſary for confirming her in that power<note n="E" place="bottom">Journals, March 20.</note>.</p>

They waited in a body upon William with their addreſs.

Whig ſeemed to ſtrive with Tory in complaiſance to the crown. A ſupply of twelve hundred thouſand pounds was voted, without one diſſenting voice<note n="G" place="bottom">March 27.</note>. They ſettled the hereditary revenue upon William and Mary<note n="H" place="bottom">March 28.</note>. A bill was brought in for the purpoſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a clauſe of credit for a million, which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons undertook to diſcharge at a proper time. But though this parliament were highly complaiſant to Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, the Tories, who formed a great majority in the houſe of commons, endeavoured to adhere to their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. They rejected a bill, containing an oath of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration of the late King, which, it was intended, ſhould be taken by all perſons in office. A bill, recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing the right of William and Mary to the throne, however, paſſed, though it ſeemed to imply, that the convention which conferred upon them the crown was an illegal aſſembly<note n="I" place="bottom">April 25.</note>. An act of grace, ſent by the King to the commons, was paſſed, without either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate or diviſion. The Whigs, finding the inferiority of their numbers, declined a conteſt, which had produced nothing but repeated defeats.

Tories, a violent majority appeared againſt his meaſures in the parliament of Scotland. The ill-humour which had produced the remonſtrance in the preceding year, had been augmented by the reſentment with which William received that paper. The meeting of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed aſſembly was dangerous; to prorogue them for any length of time, inconvenient; and to diſſolve them in the preſent diſtractions, imprudent. The King en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, in the mean time, to gain over the heads of the adverſe party, by putting into commiſſion the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal offices in the ſtate. Few were ſatisfied with what they received. The diſappointed were rendered out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous. The Lord Melvil, a man unſuitable to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome times, was appointed commiſſioner to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, which was appointed to meet on the firſt of March. Terrified at the ſtate of opinions, he prevailed with William to adjourn them from time to time. But this procraſtination of the national affairs having raiſed great clamours againſt the government, the parliament was appointed to ſit upon buſineſs on the fifteenth of April. The adherents of James derived hopes from the expected confuſion; and many took the oaths to the new government, to furniſh themſelves with an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of breaking their ſolemn engagements with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to their favoured cauſe<note n="L" place="bottom">Balcarras.</note>. The moſt violent of the Preſbyterians, offended at the reſervation of patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage made by the King, in the propoſed eſtabliſhment of the church, joined themſelves to the Jacobites; and this coalition, though formed of ſuch heterogeneous ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials as could promiſe no permanency, filled the new government with apprehenſions.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Intrigues in favour of James</note> His intrigues had placed, in ſome degree, Sir James Montgomery at the head of the oppoſition. His avow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed attachment to preſbytery endeared him to the fana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics. He had gained the Jacobites, by his profeſſed en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to reſtore King James to his throne. His de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, however, was to deceive both parties. To the Preſbyterians, he averred, that the adherents of the late King would join with them in all their views to ruin Melvil and Stair. He aſſured the Jacobites, that the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, deſpairing to obtain their demands from the
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:0709200301:618"/>
reigning Prince, would throw themſelves into the arms of the late King. In this ſituation of affairs, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament was opened at Edinburgh<note n="M" place="bottom">April 15.</note>. The commiſſioner began the ſeſſion with a ſpeech, recommending unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and demanding a ſupply. Diffident, however, of his ſtrength, he adjourned the houſe for ſeven days. In the intermediate ſpace of time, he received the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of William to agree to any law, with regard to the government of the church, which might ſeem beſt to the majority. The hopes of the Jacobites were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by this conceſſion. The King's ſupremacy over the church was reſcinded by an act, which received the royal aſſent on the twenty-ſixth of April. Even the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which laid ſo much reſtraint on the freedom of parliament were repealed<note n="N" place="bottom">May 8.</note>.

He made a motion in parliament, for the ſettlement of the church, in the form eſtabliſhed in the year 1648. Though the houſe approved not of this meaſure, they appointed a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee to conſider of a bill to ſettle the government of the church. The late conceſſions had greatly ſoftened the rigour of the Preſbyterians toward the government. A bill was introduced for granting a ſupply to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty; and thoſe who adhered to James from principle, being deſerted by their political allies, ſunk into a kind of deſpondence. William, preparing for an expedition into Ireland, was unwilling to leave an enemy behind him in Britain. Though his troops under Livingſton had obtained a kind of victory over the Highlanders in Strathſpey, he was averſe from a vigorous proſecution of a war, which was haſtening of itſelf to an end. The oppoſition in parliament had been in the mean time diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed by their own folly, as well as by the ſound police of the King. The vague conditions propoſed by Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery to James, in the name of the Preſbyterians, had only produced ambiguous returns from that Prince<note n="O" place="bottom">MS. 1690.</note> He was no ſtranger to the circumſtance which had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

The noted Ferguſon, a man born for conſpiracies, was an aſſociate in this plot. Though rewarded by William with a place of conſiderable value for his former ſervices, he deſerted his principles, and intrigued for James. The Jacobite members, yielding in the mean time to their own fears, left the commiſſioner with a clear majority in parliament.

To the encroachments of his own ſect he had nothing but the feeble aid of proclamations to oppoſe. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics denied utterly his ſupremacy in eccleſiaſtical af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs; and thus he found his prerogative diminiſhed by a faith to which he had imprudently ſacrificed his crown. The Engliſh army, in the mean time lay in their winter quarters, expoſed to ſickneſs and diſtreſs. Schomberg, though every day ſupplied with reinforcements from Denmark, Scotland, and England, was in no condition to annoy effectually the enemy. James was equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active, though ſtrengthened with five thouſand auxilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries from France. But even in this aid he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his own total want of importance and power. The Count de Lauſun, who commanded this force, acted independently of every authority.

The ſtrong caſtle of Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont capitulated to another party, the garriſon being in want of proviſions. The only frigate which remained to James of his once powerful navy, was taken in his ſight, in the bay of Dublin, by Sir Cloudeſly Shovel. But theſe advantages, though they were magnified in England, could little contribute to finiſh the war. James, though ill provided with the other neceſſaries of war, poſſeſſed a numerous army.

                  <note place="margin">William in Ireland.</note> William left London on the fourth of June. He ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Carrickfergus on the fourteenth. He paſſed from thence to Liſburn, the head quarters of the Duke of Schomberg. He reviewed at Loughbrickland his army, which conſiſted of thirty-ſix thouſand men. This great force was formed of various nations, Engliſh, Dutch, Germans, Danes, and French. Supplied with every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, healthy, vigorous, and fit for the field, their zeal and courage ſeemed equal to the abſolute certainty of victory which they entertained in their own minds. The Iriſh army having abandoned Ardee at the approach of William, fell back to the ſouth of the Boyne. On the banks of that river they were joined by James, who had marched from Dublin at the head of his French auxiliaries. The banks of the Boyne were ſteep. The ſouth ſide was hilly, and ſtrengthened by ditches. The river itſelf was deep, and it roſe very high with the tide. Theſe advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages induced James to reſolve, againſt the advice of his officers, to keep poſſeſſion of that poſt. His army was inferior in numbers, in diſcipline, in every thing to the enemy. Flight would diſpirit his troops and tarniſh his own reputation. He therefore determined to throw at once on the iſſue of a battle the fate of the Iriſh. Urged by his friends in England, encouraged by a projected in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſion of that kingdom by France, aſſured of the aid of a powerful fleet, which had already entered the narrow ſeas, he had previouſly determined to quit Ireland. But the ſtrength of his ſituation, the ſudden appearance of the enemy, which made even a retreat dangerous, induced him to defer his purpoſe<note n="T" place="bottom">James II. 1690.</note>.</p>

his troops in two lines, oppoſed to the deep and dangerous fords of the Boyne. A moraſs defended him on the left. In his rear lay the village of Dunore. Three miles behind was the narrow paſs of Duleek, calculated equally to retard, and to cover his retreat. William, having in perſon examined from the oppoſite ſhore the poſition of the enemy, reſolved, contrary to the advice of Schomberg, to attack them the next day. He formed his army in three columns. The right, under the Count de Schomberg and Douglas, was ordered to paſs near the bridge of Slane. The center, commanded by the Duke of Schomberg, was directed to force the fords in the front of the enemy. The King himſelf led the left to a fordable part in the Boyne, between his camp and the town of Drogheda. Young Schomberg was the firſt in motion. He paſſed the river. He attempted the moraſs. The left wing of the Iriſh were in a manner ſurpriſed, and they retreated. The center, commanded by the Duke, paſſed the fords with little interruption. The Dutch guards formed gradually on the bank, and then advanced. The Iriſh infantry deſcended from the riſing grounds on the enemy. But they inſtantly deſerted their officers. The cavalry behaved with more ſpirit. They broke a body of Danes, and drove them into the river. They threw into confuſion the French Proteſtants. They were however repulſed with ſlaughter by the Dutch. But they had the fortune of killing Schomberg when they retreated along the line<note n="U" place="bottom">Ralph, Leland, Life of James II.</note>.</p>

In the mean time the whole line of the Engliſh began to move towards their right. King James, afraid of their getting poſſeſſion of the paſs of Duleek, and cutting off his retreat from Dublin, marched alſo towards his left. The defeat of his right was no longer a ſecret. Several of the ſcattered and wounded horſemen mixed themſelves in their flight with his line. When they arrived at the paſs of Duleek, the Count de Lauſun earneſtly entreated James to make the beſt of his way to Dublin. He affirmed that the enemy, who were ſo ſtrong in horſe, might make detachments, and poſſeſs themſelves of the capital. James made objections: but he yielded at length to the requeſt of Lauſun: and arrived at Dublin that night<note n="X" place="bottom">James II. 1690.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Reflections.</note> The French auxiliaries, forming themſelves in the rear of the Iriſh army, preſented ſo good a countenance to the enemy, that they were ſuffered to paſs quietly through the paſs of Duleek. They even carried away five of the ſix field-pieces that attended the left wing. But when night came, the panic of the Iriſh increaſed. The greateſt part of the troops diſperſed. The French only adhered to their colours. Such was the paſſage, rather than the battle, of the Boyne. No action promiſed to be more important in its conſequences. None ſeems leſs remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for either the conduct of the leaders or the valour of the troops. In the ſpirit of the undertaking lies Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam's greateſt praiſe. The improvidence of James was equal to the cowardice of his army. The firſt ſeemed wantonly to riſk every thing without any apparent neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. The latter was prepoſterouſly cautious, while he ſcarce had any thing further to loſe. William may be blamed for knowing ſo little of the ground through which his attacks were to be led. James was unpardonable for not availing himſelf of what fortune had thrown in his hands. But one King deſpiſed too much his enemies. The other was perplexed with a diſtruſt of his friends. Had the authority of James prevailed over the pride of the Iriſh, he might perhaps have involved his rival in thoſe difficulties which fell afterwards with ſo much weight on himſelf. By oppoſing the French auxiliaries, inſtead of the Iriſh, to the center of the enemy, he might have cut to pieces the main body, incumbered as they were in a deep river, with difficult banks, before they could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive any aid from either of their wings.</p>

                  <note place="margin">King James flies to France.</note> When James arrived at Dublin, he found letters from his Queen, and an account of the victory obtained by the French at Fleurus over the Prince of Waldec. Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged by this intelligence, he began to liſten to the advice of his friends, who unanimouſly concurred in requeſting him to retire to France. When he was mounting his horſe, the French general officers arrived, and haſtened his flight, by informing him that even the French troops themſelves were diſperſed in ſearch of proviſions. With two troops of horſe he left Dublin at five in the morning. Theſe he poſted to defend the bridge of Bray, while he himſelf with a few attendants took his journey through the hills of Wicklow, and purſued his way to Duncan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. In the morning of the ſecond day he arrived at that place. He went on board a Malouine which he found in the harbour, fell down with the tide, and ſailed round to Kinſale. There he found three French frigates under the command of M. du Queſne. This little ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron had been obtained by the earneſt entreaties of his Queen, from M. de Seignelai, the French miniſter for the marine.

When he landed in France, he ſoon perceived the pernicious effects of that meaſure, and repented ſincerely of his own conduct. The French King had formed the moſt effectual plans for his ſervice. That Prince was maſter at ſea ever ſince the battle of Bantry-bay. By the victory at Fleurus he was confeſſedly ſuperior to his enemies at land. He had ordered a fleet to ſail, not only capable to engage, but, as it afterwards proved, to defeat the combined force of the maritime powers. He deſigned at the ſame time to ſend a ſquadron of twenty-five frigates to St. George's channel, to burn all the ſhips on both ſides but ſuch as ſhould be neceſſary to tranſport King James and ſome troops to England. This ſcheme, if executed with ſpirit, would have confined William in Ireland, while his rival might mount without reſiſtance his throne. M. de Seigne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lai,

His firſt meaſures after his arrival in the capital were highly impolitic, if not unjuſt. He promiſed, by a declaration, to pardon and protect ſuch of the lower ſort as ſhould, in a limited time, ſurrender their arms.

When the ſituation of that Princeſs brought her forward to public view, her good qualities appeared with conſiderable advantage. The prejudices which the peculiarity of her ſituation had raiſed againſt her humanity, were much leſſened by an eaſy acceſs to her perſon, and the ſoftneſs of her manners. In political addreſs ſhe ſeemed not to be defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient; and the fame of her prudence roſe among the people in proportion to their prior want of information concerning her real character. The part which ſhe had to act was difficult. The times were critical and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous. Her council was formed, almoſt in equal num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, of the two irreconcileable parties, the Whigs and the Tories. A powerful enemy preſſed the nation from abroad. Diſcontents, factions, and even conſpiracies, prevailed at home. Though the ſupplies for the navy had been ample, the preparations for equipping the fleet were languid; and the kingdom, through the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gligence of government, or the deſign of ſome of its ſervants, ſeemed to lie expoſed to invaſion, and even to conqueſt. In this ſtate of things, the reins were left in the hands of Mary.

                  <note place="margin">The fleets at ſea.</note> Certain intelligence of the equipment of a powerful fleet in the ports of France had arrived in England, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore William's departure for Ireland. The Earl of Torrington had hoiſted his flag in the Downs, as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander of the fleet, on the thirtieth of May. He ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at St. Helen's on the fourteenth of June. The Dutch fleet, under Evertzen, having joined the Engliſh, the admiral weighed anchor on the twenty-third; and propoſed to wait at Dunoſe, at the back of the Iſle of Wight, for the French fleet, which had appeared, on the twentieth, before Plymouth. The French, in point of numbers and in the ſize of the ſhips, were ſuperior
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:0709200301:631"/>
to the combined fleet of the allies; and therefore Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington had reſolved not to engage the enemy in the open ſeas. He was, however forced to depart from his purpoſe, by the expreſs orders of the Queen. The enemy had been in ſight for five days: but the Engliſh admiral made ſuch uſe of the winds and tides, that he eluded all the efforts of the French to bring him to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. The two fleets lay off Beachy-head. The morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after Torrington had received orders to fight, he gave the ſignal, as ſoon as day appeared, for forming the line. The wind was eaſterly. He bore down upon the enemy. The Dutch formed the van, and were engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the van of the French about eight of the clock in the morning.

He, however, came up with the enemy at ten of the clock; but at ſuch a diſtance from the Dutch, that he permitted their whole diviſion to be ſurrounded. The Dutch behaved with the utmoſt courage. The moſt of their ſhips were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled. Three of their line of battle were ſunk in the engagement. Three more were burnt in the flight. They loſt many men. Two of their admirals, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral captains, were ſlain. The Engliſh who were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged ſuffered extremely from the enemy. The French ſhips were well manned. Their fire was regular and rapid; their management of the ſails during the action ſkilful and expeditious; and their courage equal to their hopes of a victory, which their ſuperiority in ſtrength ſeemed to promiſe. Their want of experience, and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the courſe of the tides, deprived them of a great part of the advantage which their arms had gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Torrington came judiciouſly to anchor, upon its falling calm in the afternoon.

He was followed, but at a great diſadvantage, by the French, who had the folly to purſue a defeated enemy in a line. They, however, deſtroyed ſeveral diſabled Dutch men of war. They drove an Engliſh ſhip of ſeventy guns aſhore near Winchelſea, and continued the chace to the bay of Rye.

They returned on the twenty-firſt of July, and anchored in Torbay. The panic, which had been ſuſpended by their departure, was renewed upon their return. The militia was ordered to the coaſt. A camp was formed near Torbay. Terror, confuſion, and cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, prevailed every where. The fears of the nation were, however, found to be ſuperfluous in the event. The enemy, having lain on the coaſt for a fortnight, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded their naval campaign with the burning of Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, an inconſiderable village. Elated with this trivial exploit, they ſailed toward Breſt, on the fourth of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt. Torrington retired after the battle to the mouth of the Thames. Having left the command to Sir John Aſby, he himſelf returned to London. The whole city was in the utmoſt conſternation. The panic of the people was transſerred to the government. The Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobites and Nonjurorswere accuſed of acting in concert with the enemy.

The apprehenſions of an invaſion, and even of conqueſt, firſt raiſed the terror, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the reſentment of the nation, againſt the ſuppoſed abettors of their ancient enemies. The miniſtry, either yielding to their own ſuſpicions, or to improve to advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage the fears of the people, had ſtrengthened, by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations againſt known Jacobites, the ſurmiſes enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained concerning a domeſtic conſpiracy. To gratify the rage of the populace at home, as well as to quiet the tumults of the Dutch mobs, Torrington was accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of miſconduct, and committed priſoner to the Tower. Informations of treaſon were encouraged. The common credulity of the vulgar, with regard to dark deſigns againſt the public happineſs, was cheriſhed and improved.

The ignorance of the court of France with regard to the ſtate of England preſerved the latter kingdom from imminent danger, upon various occaſions; but at no juncture with more apparent good-fortune, than in the preſent year. Their victorious fleet rode in triumph in the channel for many weeks. They lay, without the fear of an enemy, in the very bay where a foreign invaſion had been made with ſucceſs about twenty months before. Had they landed an army in the name of King James, the crown of England would

He laid open the ſecret councils of the Prince of Orange; and his report concurring with undoubted intelligence received from other quarters, the King was induced to believe that he was ſincere. He carried daily intelligence of all incidents in the ſecretary's office to the Jacobites, by which they avoided many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies and troubles. He deſired inſtructions, without being admitted into the King's ſecrets; owning, that his former conduct ought juſtly to debar him from all confidence. He doubted not, he ſaid, but he could bring over many great men to the King's party. He deſired to know whether he ſhould gain the Earl of Danby, or join with the party who were contriving his ruin. He offered to bring over the troops in Flanders. But he rather propoſed to act in concert with thoſe who were, the next ſeſſion, to endeavour to expel all foreigners from the kingdom. He adviſed the King not to invade the kingdom with a great force. That a French power was too terrifying to the people.

In a ſet ſpeech to the States, he acknowledged his gratitude for their former favours, and promiſed his future ſervices.

That he ſhould reſtore to the Proteſtants all their eſtates and goods. That he ſhould eſtabliſh an entire liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience throughout the French dominions.

Lewis the Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth ſat down, ſuddenly, before Mons. William who, had retired from the Hague to Loo, placed himſelf at the head of the army. He advanced to Hall, within the ſound of the enemy's guns. The ſtate of his troops was ſo bad, and the diſpoſitions of the enemy ſo good, that he durſt not venture a battle, to relieve the place. Mons was taken, after a gallant defence, on the ninth of April<note n="L" place="bottom">Hiſt. de France, vol. iii.</note>. Lewis, whoſe vanity was at leaſt equal to his ambition, returned to Verſailles; and, to celebrate his conqueſt, ſtruck a medal, which reflected on the paſſive conduct of William.

                  <note place="margin">Campaign in Flanders.</note> The King, having ſettled the affairs of the church, prorogued the parliament, and given orders concerning the management of the war in Ireland<note n="O" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. ii.</note>, reſolved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the Continent, to place himſelf at the head of the allied army. He embarked at Harwich, on the 2d of May; and in the evening of the 3d, arrived at the Hague. The preparations of the allies, the character and ſituation of their leader, raiſed their hopes to a certainty of ſucceſs, on their own part, and abſolute ruin, on the ſide of France. The event was not anſwerable to theſe high expectations. The Mareſchal Luxembourg, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuddenly poſſeſſed himſelf of Hall, which the Allies had, in ſome degree, fortified, kept cloſe within his lines. William, at the head of a ſuperior army, failed in all his attempts to place the fate of the campaign on the deciſion of a battle. Luxembourg perceived, that to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent a defeat, was to gain glory, when oppoſed to ſuch odds. The ſummer was ſpent in a ſtate of inactivity. Some unimportant movements were made on both ſides. But the French had determined to engage only at a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt advantage. Tired of a campaign which produced no laurels, William quitted the command of the army to the Prince of Waldec, on the twelfth of Auguſt.—The Prince, in withdrawing the troops at Leuſe, was attacked, unexpectedly, in the rear, by Luxembourgh. The allies ſuffered ſome loſs. But the French obtained little advantage. The glory of having ſtopt the progreſs of a ſuperior enemy, was the only thing gained by Lewis, on the ſide of Flanders, ſince the taking of Mons, in the month of April<note n="P" place="bottom">Hiſt. de France, vol. iii.

While the navy of Spain lay loitering in their ports, a ſquadron of the enemy inſulted the coaſt, and bombarded Alicant and Barcelona. In Savoy, the fortune which had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Mareſchal de Catinat ſeemed to have deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his arms. Though he took Veilana and ſome other places of importance, he was repulſed at Coni, in Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, and forced ſoon after to repaſs the Po. He was however more fortunate toward the end of the campaign. He converted into a ſiege the blockade of Montmelian, the only city in Savoy ſtill held for the Duke. The place, after a vigorous defence, was taken upon terms. The Imperial troops, ſent to the aid of the Duke of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy, ſeemed more anxious to plunder their friends than to oppoſe the enemy. The Turks loſt in the mean time all the advantages which they had gained on the ſide of Hungary in the preceding campaign. They were totally defeated at Salankemen by the Prince of Baden.

The ſuppoſed inſolence of the Preſbyterians was calculated to throw William in the ſcale of their politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal enemies. The republican form of their church go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment appeared contrary to the firſt principles of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy; and they ſeemed unwilling to relinquiſh any part of their independence to a Prince who thought that they owed to himſelf the whole.

Ginckle, who had ſucceeded Solmes in the command of the army in Ireland, detached near a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand horſe to the aid of Marlborough; and ſoon after he had opened his trenches before Cork, he was rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced with four thouſand Danes, under the Duke of Wirtemberg. The ſiege, already carried on with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, was in ſome degree retarded by a diſpute about the command, between the Duke and the Earl. A breach was however made in the wall. The beſiegers prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a general aſſault. The ammunition of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon being exhauſted, they ſurrendered themſelves pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of war. Though the ſeaſon was far advanced, Kinſale was ſummoned. The Iriſh governor reſolved to defend the fort to the laſt extremity. He burnt the town, as untenable. He retired to the old and new fort. The firſt was taken after a gallant defence. The ſiege of the ſecond was preſſed with vigour. In ten days the place capitulated. The garriſon were permitted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire to Limerick, with all the honours of war; and Marlborough, having accompliſhed the object of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition, ſent his troops to winter-quarters, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to England<note n="X" place="bottom">Lediord. vol. i.</note>.</p>

An improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the barbariſm of their predeceſſors impoſed upon them a new name.

A privy council was formed of men at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to the reigning King. They, however, poſſeſſed little authority. Their power was contemned by the army. The ſoldiers owned no ſuperiors but the milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry officers. They diſregarded even theſe, when their or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders interfered with their own rapacity. The winter was throughout diſgraced with acts of barbarity on both ſides. The year 1691, in its firſt months, produced no memorable event. Tyrconnel, though ſtript of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of chief governor by James, had returned from France with a pitiful ſum of money, to maintain the Iriſh war. Yielding to deſpondence, or ſwayed by his diſgrace, he endeavoured to induce the Iriſh to ſubmit to the new government, upon terms.

James conferred the chief command on St. Ruth, a French general of experience and reputation. That of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer arrived in Ireland; but he was furniſhed with none of the neceſſaries of war. Deſtitute of pay, in want of proviſions, without ſtores, and ill provided with am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, a great part of the army had been forced to diſperſe. St. Ruth found himſelf obliged, by the bad ſtate of his troops, to act upon the defenſive; and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing placed a ſtrong garriſon in Athlone, he reſolved to wait for the enemy on the further ſide of the Shannon<note n="Z" place="bottom">Auct. citat. paſſim.

                  <note place="margin">Athlone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieged.</note> Ginckle, ſupplied with every thing neceſſary to open the campaign with vigour, ordered his troops to rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous at Mullingar. He decamped from that place on the ſixth of June; and having, with little difficulty, oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the garriſon of Ballymore to ſurrender, he advanced toward Athlone. His army conſiſted of twenty thouſand men. Having paſſed through dangerous and narrow de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>files without any oppoſition, he arrived, on the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of June, before the place. Athlone, as well as Limerick, is divided by the Shannon. It was ſtrongly garriſoned and tolerably fortified. The Iriſh army lay behind the town, on the ſide of Connaught. Ginckle, having finiſhed his batteries, conſiſting of ten eighteen pounders, began to play on the baſtion next the river toward Laneſborough, in the night of the twentieth of June. A practicable breach was made in a few hours. An aſſault was given at ſix of the clock the next even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the part of the town lying next to Leinſter. wss taken with little loſs<note n="A" place="bottom">MS.

The place was reduced to a heap of rubbiſh. The Iriſh continued obſtinate. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing had ſome advantage over the enemy, by burning their bridge of boats, they were lulled into a fatal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. On the thirtieth of June, Ginckle ſuddenly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering the river in columns, ſurpriſed the town. Little reſiſtance was made by the Iriſh; and all that fell in the way of the aſſailants were put to the ſword. The boldneſs and vigilance of Ginckle could be only equall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the negligence of the Iriſh. Hiſtory can ſcarce furniſh a parallel to the ſucceſs of an undertaking which
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:0709200301:652"/>
ſeemed in itſelf impracticable. A fortified town attacked acroſs a river, ſuſtained behind by a conſiderable army, was taken in leſs than a quarter of an hour by an army of three thouſand men, who were breaſt-high in water when they advanced to the breach<note n="B" place="bottom">MS. Journal 1691.</note>. St. Ruth, when informed of the aſſault, could ſcarce give any credit to the intelligence. He however, ordered ſome battalions to ſuſtain the beſieged; but the ſuccours came too late. The works of the town toward his camp were entire. The enemy had already lined the walls, and repulſed the Iriſh from their own works<note n="C" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Battle of Aghrim.</note> St. Ruth, covered with ſhame at his own negligence, decamped without beat of drum in the night. Having marched ten miles from Athlone, he poſted himſelf at Agh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim, determined to recover his own reputation or to loſe the kingdom, in one deciſive battle. To augment his army, he had withdrawn the garriſons from Sligo, Laneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, and James-town. Ginckle followed his example in reinforcing his army with all his detached parties. Having remained ten days at Athlone, he marched into Roſcommon, and encamped along the river Suc. The Iriſh army extended their line more than two miles on the riſing grounds of Kilcommeden. The ſlope before them was lined with hedges and ditches. A bog defended their front. Moraſſes ſkirted their right and left. On the twelfth of July, Ginckle determined to attack the enemy. St. Ruth marked his motions from the eminence, and form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his own line. He exhibited in his diſpoſitions all the conduct of an experienced officer. He rode along the line. He directed every thing, he animated his troops with words calculated to confirm their courage and to rouſe their minds. The ſtrength of the ground, the ardour of his men, his excellent diſpoſitions, the raſhneſs of the enemy, who ſeemed determined to advance, filled him him with every hope of victory<note n="D" place="bottom">Ralph, Burnet, Leland.

                  <note place="margin">Iriſh defeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</note> Ginckle, having croſſed the Suc without oppoſition, advanced to the moraſs in the front of the enemy. One paſs led to their camp on the right; another, by the caſtle of Aghrim, to the left. The firſt was ordered to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked. It was gained, after much reſiſtance. The ſpirit of the enemy, and the difficulties of the ground, induced
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:0709200301:653"/>
Ginckle to ſuſpend his deſign to engage. But, to prevent the retreat of the enemy, he again changed his mind. The paſs on the left was attacked, at five in the evening. General Mackay, in the mean time, plunged into the bog with the center, and advanced againſt the enemy. He was received, however, with ſuch warmth, that his men were forced to retreat. St. Ruth, beholding this advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, was elevated with the hopes of victory. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh cavalry, having forced the paſs on the left, advanced in full ſpeed on the flank of the purſuing Iriſh. The fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitives rallied, formed, and advanced. The battle ſeemed to hang in equal ſcales, when it was ſuddenly decided by fortune. St. Ruth, deſcending from the hill, advanced with a ſquadron of horſe to ſuſtain his foot, and attack the Engliſh cavalry. When he was on the point of coming to blows with the enemy, he was killed by a cannon-ball. The ſpirit of the Iriſh fell with their leader. Sarsfield, the next in command, was not ſtationed where his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence was moſt required. Confuſion, diſorder, and terror, ſpread from wing to wing. The Iriſh, on the point of being victors, reſigned themſelves to panic and flight. Many were ſlain in the battle, but more in bloody pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of three miles. Several thouſands of the vanquiſhed were killed. The victors loſt ſeven hundred men. The crown of Ireland depended on the opportune fall of St. Ruth. His death ſnatched victory from his hands; and, by breaking the power of the Catholics, leſſened their miſeries, by deciding ſooner their fate. Ginckle gained reputation by the action; but his army loſt every claim to humanity, by giving no quarter<note n="E" place="bottom">Mem. of Ireland, Leland, Ralph.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Galway ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renders.</note> The bulk of the Iriſh fugitives retired to Limerick, after the battle of Aghrim. Ginckle, having refreſhed his army a few days, advanced to Galway. He ſat down before that place on the nineteenth of July. Galway, though garriſoned with ſeven regiments, was not provided with the means of defence. Ginckle, wiſhing to end the war, permitted the Iriſh to retire to Limerick. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf advanced toward that place. He ſat down before it on the twenty-fifth of Auguſt. Contention, diſcord, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion prevailed within the walls. Some were for ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering upon terms for themſelves; others, upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, in favour of their whole party. The majority,
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:0709200301:654"/>
headed by the French officers, reſolved to hold Limerick to the laſt extremity. The ſucceſsful defence of the place in the preceding year animated them with hopes of the ſame good fortune. Succours were expected from France. A fleet of twenty ſail was already on the way, with men, proviſions, ammunition, and money. The deſpair of the proſcribed Catholics inflamed their minds againſt an enemy who had ſhewn ſo little humanity in the late battle. Tyrconnel, who had uniformly propoſed ſubmiſſion, had died a few days before, in Limerick. Sarsfield, his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical opponent, loved war, on account of its dangers; and the generals d'Oſſone and de Teſſe were reſolved, for the benefit of their country, to continue, as long as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the diſtraction among her enemies<note n="F" place="bottom">Auct citat. paſſim.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Siege of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merick.</note> The particulars of the ſecond ſiege of Limerick are neither important nor diſtinctly known. Six weeks were ſpent before the place, without any deciſive effect. The gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon was well ſupplied with proviſions. They were provided with all means of defence. The ſeaſon was now far advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. The rains had ſet in. The winter itſelf was near. Ginckle had received orders to finiſh the war upon any terms. The diſſentions between the French and Iriſh were renewed with redoubled fury. The Engliſh general offered conditions, which the Iriſh, had they even been victors, could ſcarce refuſe with prudence. He agreed, that all in arms ſhould receive their pardon; That their eſtates ſhould be reſtored, their attainders annulled, their outlawries reverſed: That none ſhould be liable for debts incurred through deeds done in the courſe of hoſtilities: That all Roman Catholics ſhould enjoy the ſame tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with regard to their religion, as in the reign of Charles the Second: That the gentry ſhould be permitted to make uſe of arms: That the inferior ſort ſhould be allowed to exerciſe their callings and profeſſions: That no oaths, but that of allegiance, ſhould be required of high or low: That ſhould the troops, or any number of them, chuſe to retire into any foreign ſervice, they ſhould be conveyed to the continent, at the expence of the King. Sarsfield, who had obtained the title of Earl of Lucan from James after his abdication, was permitted to retain a dignity which the laws could not recognize<note n="G" place="bottom">Articles of capitulation.</note>. The lords juſtices had arrived from Dublin on the firſt of
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:0709200301:655"/>

                  <note place="margin">Obſervations on the</note> Though the terms granted at the capitulation of Lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick were, perhaps, neceſſary in themſelves, and highly ſuitable to humanity, they were, ſoon after, equally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked by both parties. The Engliſh Proteſtants looked with unbounded reſentment upon articles, which rendered, in ſome meaſure, independent a ſect, whom, on account of ancient prejudices and recent injuries, they abhorred. The Iriſh, having obtained with ſo much facility ſuch good terms, imbibed an opinion, that they might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted conditions ſtill more favourable from an exhauſted enemy. The arrival of the French fleet, two days after the capitulation, with arms, ſtores, proviſions, and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, confirmed them in their ſentiments on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. But that circumſtance, in conjunction with many other obvious reaſons, juſtified William for putting an end to the war, upon moderate terms. Many millions had already been expended in the reduction of Ireland. Near one hundred thouſand men had been loſt by ſickneſs and the ſword. The army, though victorious in the field, were exhauſted with fatigue. Winter was approaching. The ſiege of Limerick muſt, in all probability, have been raiſed. A ſecond diſappointment before that place would have been equal to a defeat. The ſpirits of the Iriſh would riſe. The French, encouraged by their ſucceſs, would aid their allies with more effect.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Iriſh.</note> The pacification with the Iriſh furniſhed matter for much diſpute. The peculiar ſituation of that nation ſeems to have been overlooked in the conteſt. The deſertion, upon which the deprivation of James had been founded in England, had not exiſted in Ireland. The lord-lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant had retained his allegiance. The government was uniformly continued under the name of the Prince from whom the ſervants of the crown had derived their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions. James himſelf had, for more than ſeventeen months, exerciſed the royal function in Ireland. He was certainly <hi>de facto,</hi> if not <hi>de jure,</hi> King. The rebellion of the Iriſh muſt therefore be founded on the ſuppoſition, that their allegiance is transferable by the parliament of England. A ſpeculative opinion can ſcarce juſtify the puniſhment of a great majority of a people. The Iriſh ought to have been conſidered as enemies, rather than
<pb n="623" facs="tcp:0709200301:656"/>
rebels. If, therefore, the pacification was expedient, it was certainly juſt.</p>

                  <note place="margin">pacification.</note> But the opponents of William give him no credit, either for his juſtice or his humanity, upon the preſent occaſion. They aſcribe his eagerneſs to finiſh the troubles of Ireland, to his earneſt deſire of proſecuting with more vigour the war on the continent. They allege, that had not an Engliſh parliament deprived his creatures of the hopes of Iriſh forfeitures, he would have been leſs liberal in the conceſſions which he made. Though there may have been more malice than truth in theſe allegations, ſome of the terms were neither ſuitable to his dignity, nor conſiſtent with his uſual prudence. The French fleet, by an expreſs article between the generals Telmaſh and d'Uſſone<note n="H" place="bottom">Ralph, vol. ii.

On the twenty-ſecond of the month, the parliament met at Weſtminſter. The King told them in his ſpeech, that he had appointed their meeting, to conſider of the beſt and moſt effectual means of proſecuting the war againſt France in the next campaign. He hoped, he ſaid, that the late ſucceſs in Ireland would encourage them to ſtrengthen his hands.

In the preceding Auguſt, in conſequence of the pacification with the Highlanders, a proclamation of indemnity had been iſſued to ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurgents as ſhould take the oaths to the King and Queen on or before the laſt day of December. The chiefs of the few tribes who had been in arms for James, complied, ſoon after, with the proclamation, except Macdonald of Glenco; and even HE failed in ſubmitting within the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited time, more from accident than deſign. In the end of December he came to Colonel Hill, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the garriſon in Fort-William, to take the oaths of allegiance to the government.

The way to Inverary lay acroſs almoſt impaſſable mountains. The ſeaſon was extremely rigorous, and the whole country covered with a deep ſnow. So eager, however, was Macdonald to take the oaths, before the limited time ſhould expire, that, though the road lay within half a mile of his own houſe, he would not ſtop to viſit his family. After va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious obſtructions, he arrived at Inverary. The time was elapſed. The ſheriff heſitated to receive his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. But macdonald prevailed over his ſcruples with importunities, and even with tears<note n="C" place="bottom">Inquiry into the Maſſacre at Genco. State Tracts, vol. iii.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Maſſacre</note> Sir John Dalrymple, afterwards Earl of Stair, a man of profligate principles, attended King William, as ſecretary of ſtate for Scotland. He took advantage of Macdonald's neglecting to take the oaths within the time preſcribed. He procured from the King a warrant of military execution againſt him and his whole tribe. As a mark of his own eagerneſs, or to ſave Dalrymple, William ſigned the warrant, both above and below, with his own hand. The ſecretary, in let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters expreſſive of a brutal ferocity of mind, urged the military officers who commanded in the Highlands to execute their orders with the utmoſt rigour. Campbell of Glenlyon, a captain in the Earl of Argyle's regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and two ſubalterns, were ordered, with one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty men, to repair to Glenco on the firſt of February. Campbell, being uncle to young Macdonald's wife, was received by the father with friendſhip and hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitality. The men were treated in the houſes of his tenants with free quarters and kind entertainment. Till the thirteenth of February, the troops lived in good-humour and familiarity with the people. The officers, on the very night of the maſſacre, paſſed the evenign and played at cards in Macdonald's houſe. In the night, Lieutenant Lindſay, with a party of ſoldiers, called in a friendly manner at his door. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly admitted. Macdonald, as he was riſing from his bed to receive his gueſt, was ſhot dead behind his back

with two bullets. His wife had already put on her clothes; but ſhe was ſtript naked by the ſoldiers, who tore the rings off her fingers with their teeth<note n="D" place="bottom">State Tracts, vol. iii.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">of Glenco.</note> The ſlaughter now became general. To prevent the pity of the ſoldiers to their hoſts, their quarters had been changed the night before. Neither age nor infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity was ſpared. Some women, in defending their children, were killed. Boys, imploring mercy, were ſhot by officers, on whoſe knees they hung. In one place, nine perſons, as they ſat enjoying themſelves at table, were ſhot dead by the ſoldiers. The aſſaſſins are even ſaid to have made a ſport of death. At Inveriggen, in Campbell's own quarters, nine men were firſt bound by the ſoldiers, then ſhot at intervals, one by one. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral, who fled to the mountains, periſhed by famine and the inclemency of the ſeaſon. Thoſe who eſcaped owed their lives to a tempeſtuous night. Lieutenant-colonel Hamilton, who had the charge of the execution from Dalrymple, was on his march with four hundred men, to occupy all the paſſes which led from the valley of Glenco. He was obliged to ſtop by the ſeverity of the weather, which proved the ſafety of the unfortunate tribe. He entered the valley the next day. He laid all the houſes in aſhes, and carried away all the cattle and ſpoil, which were divided among the officers and ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers<note n="E" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</note> All Europe, as well as Britain, was ſhocked at the particulars of a maſſacre, at once barbarous, impolitic, and inhuman. The rigour of the warrant, the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of its execution, the maſk of friendſhip under which an unſuſpecting and unarmed people were butcher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſoldiers, could ſcarce be exaggerated by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of William, or defended by his friends. The blame was laid by the latter on the miniſter. They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that the King, ever ſlow in tranſacting buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs<note n="F" place="bottom">Burnet, vol. iii.</note>, had ſigned the warrant, among other papers, without inquiry. Some, with a mixture of abſurdity and injuſtice, defended the meaſure itſelf as conſiſtent with the laws of Scotland. Others averred, that the officers extended their rigour beyond the letter of their orders. Though the opponents of William owned,
<pb n="630" facs="tcp:0709200301:665"/>
that he was inſtigated to the meaſure by Dalrymple, they would not allow that he could be ignorant of the contents of a paper, which, apparently to ſcreen his ſecretary, he had ſigned both above and below. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants of fire and ſword, they acknowledged, had been often granted in Scotland; but they were ſeldom exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with any degree of rigour, and never againſt men who were not at the time actually in arms. If the troops exceeded their orders, a point by no means clear, the King, they ſaid, in approving afterwards of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, made their cauſe his own. He would not permit the actors in this tragedy to be puniſhed. He even pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted the moſt active, and diſtinguiſhed them with his favour.<note n="G" place="bottom">State Tracts, vol. iii. p. 914.</note>.</p>
