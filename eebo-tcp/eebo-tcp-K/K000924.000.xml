         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following hiſtorical
Eſſays were written as a
Sequel to one bearing the ſame
Title, publiſhed ſome time
ſince in the <hi>Craftſman,</hi> and
communicated to that Author;
but he having neglected to give
them to the Publick, I have
thought fit to become the Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
myſelf. Whether Mr. <hi>d'
Anvers</hi> eſteems other Subjects
more ſeaſonable at this time;
whether he has been intimida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
with Proſecutions, or ſof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd
with Applications, I do
not take upon me to determine.
<pb facs="tcp:0250501500:4"/>
I have the Pleaſure only to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the Reader, that I have
faithfully collected the Facts
that are related in theſe little
Tracts, as they have fallen out
from time to time, and ſhall
continue to have a watchful
Eye over the Actions of our
Steward, and to record them
for the Benefit of Poſterity, that
thoſe who come after us at
leaſt may be deterr'd by this
Example, from intruſting the
Management of their Eſtates
to bad Hands. The Memoria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſt
furniſhes Materials for the
Hiſtorian, and ſo far he has a
right to ſhare in his Fame. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
the Character of this moſt
remarkable Steward may, by
my means, be preſerved thus to
<pb facs="tcp:0250501500:5"/>
future Times; the Indulgence
of this Vanity, and the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
of having done what
was in my Power to expoſe a
corrupt Servant, is all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
I claim; as a Man has
ſome little Pretence to Merit
from the Publick, who only
crys out, <hi>Stop Thief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But before I take leave of my
Readers, I humbly intreat, as
they deſire to be thought can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did,
or courteous, or to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged
with any other Epithets,
that the moſt complaiſant Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
ever gave them, That they
will be ſo good not to force the
Letters in the following Pages,
to convey to them any other
Meanings than what they ſtand
<pb facs="tcp:0250501500:6"/>
for in the Order they are there
placed, it being the Nature of
the Twenty-four Letters in our
Alphabet, as I am inform'd,
when they are tranſpoſed, to
give to the Reader what Ideas
the Tranſpoſer pleaſes; ſo
large is the Field of Innuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do's:
This Caution might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
at any other Time or
Place than this appear ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous;
but as ſome People are
very tender, and others very
cenſorious, I thought this not
an unneceſſary Advertiſement.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> HAVE the Happiness to be
Tenant to Sir <hi>George Engliſh,</hi>
and there is not one among
them who has a more hearty
Affection for him and his
whole Family, than I have. When this Estate
(which he now enjoys, and which, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
grant, he and his may long enjoy) was
firſt left to him, by the general Attorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Tenants, and the Conſent
and Act of brave Sir <hi>William,</hi> his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0250501500:8"/>
I had the pleaſure, as a Witneſs and
a Tenant, to ſign the Inſtrument my
ſelf: I ſaw good Sir <hi>William</hi> ratify it, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held
him ſoon after expire, and could
diſcern a pleaſing Satisfaction in his Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
riſing from the Comfort he received
in having finiſhed what he believed muſt
make his Tenants the happieſt and moſt
eaſy of any People in our whole County.
You will forgive me, Sir, that I thus
dwell on the Praiſe of my good old
Maſter Sir <hi>William:</hi> He was a Man who
loved his whole Species, who had a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
Benevolence to Mankind; he did
not think any Man was born for himſelf
alone, nor could he bear to ſee any of his
neighbouring Landlords uſe their Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
ill, or rack them too high; and more
than once he has engaged himſelf in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive
Law-ſuits, to deliver them from
the Hands of the Oppreſſor. Mr. <hi>Lyn,</hi>
of whom I now complain to you, Sir,
was one of the Tenants; and tho' his lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
Copy-hold was then not much in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair,
and a little incumbered with Debts,
however it has been ſince improved, he
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0250501500:9"/>
profeſſed himſelf very zealous, as well as
the reſt of us, in the Intereſt of our Land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lord,
and continued ſo ſome Years: But
Time proves every thing; and a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
while after he was appointed Steward
to our old Maſter, he began to ſhew
himſelf; and tho' the Affairs of Sir <hi>George</hi>
grew every day worſe and worſe under
his Management, the Affairs of Mr.
<hi>Lyn</hi> grew better and better every day.
He began to look plump and round; his
little Farm was clear of all Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances;
his Family, his Friends, his
Relations, his Acquaintance, all grew
plump likewiſe, and flouriſhed under his
Influence: He had indeed been very libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
to them, not out of his own Money,
but his Maſter's; He put them into all
the Employments he could find in the
ſeveral Manors, and very frequently,
when there was no Employment rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,
or open, or unenjoy'd by any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,
Friend, or Dependent of his, he
was ready to erect an Office, and to
give it a Name and an Appointment out
of his Maſter's Rents, without any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0250501500:10"/>
how much his Maſter was in
debt, how detrimental it muſt prove to
his Eſtate, or how ungrateful it was to
the Tenants, who ſaw, and murmured to
ſee, that their Farms were racked to the
higheſt, to ſupport the Family, and
other Self-Interests of Mr. <hi>Lyn.</hi> Well,
Sir, our Steward grew rich, he grew am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious
and vain, and haughty, and
humorous; and now took it into his
Head, that he was as accompliſh'd a
Gentleman even as Sir <hi>George</hi> himſelf,
and would needs be ſtiled his <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion:</hi>
He dreſs'd himſelf up in Blue,
and uſed to ſtrut about in Pearl Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour
Stockings, a Silk Doublet, and a
Cap and Feather, and fancy'd he had
enrolled himſelf among Heroes and
Gods, ſo hard it is for a Man in
Proſperity to check the Folly of a vain
Mind; ſome time before this whim
of bedecking himſelf in Taffaty and
Blue, he had a Fancy to appear in
Red; and accordingly one Morning
with a very ſolemn and grave Counte<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>nance,
he told ſeveral of his Intimate<gap reason="illegible" resp="#TECH" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0250501500:11"/>
that now he was grown rich, he was reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
to devote himſelf to the Service of
Religion, as a Knight-Errant; that he
would reſcue Virgins, protect Orphans,
deſtroy Giants, and do every thing praiſe-worthy,
and becoming the great Office of
true Chivalry; he exhorted his Friends
likewiſe, who were very honeſt Men,
and meant well, to do the ſame, and told
them their Habiliments ought to be all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like.
viz. Red Taffaty, Spurs, Feathers,
Caps, Faulchions, &amp;c. So ſaid, ſo done,
they dreſs'd themſelves, they ſwore on the
Evangeliſts to be good and true Knights,
they march'd in an affected Stage-ſtrut
round the Town, and made a Shew in their
whimſical Dreſſes that ſet all the Pariſh in
a Gape. Now one wou'd imagine that
Mr. <hi>Lyn</hi> was about to make amends for all
his Miſmanagement, and that the World,
as it had been the worſe for him, would
be the better too: But this was only a Joke
it ſeems; for as ſoon as ever he had perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
his Companions to this, on a ſudden he
whipt off his Red Taffaty Doublet, and
put on a blue one, as I have ſaid, and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0250501500:12"/>
called himſelf his Maſter's Fellow, to the
great Surprize of every one. But theſe
Frolicks, you will ſay, might only take
Birth from the jocund Levities of a Head
a little giddy with Proſperity, the plaiſom
Gaities, the <hi>dulce deſipere</hi> of a Heart ſwol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len
with Joy and Power. We will go on
then to conſider him only in his Character
of Steward.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>LYN</hi> was no ſooner got into the
Stewardſhip, but he with very great Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance
told his Maſter, that none of his
Tenants had any hearty Affection for him,
but himſelf and his Sons, his Brother
<hi>Townly</hi> and his Sons, with their Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
and Intimates; that if it were not
for his and their Management, Sir <hi>George</hi>
would not be able to make any thing of
the Eſtate. And <hi>Iſaac Tombrel,</hi> a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation
to a Relation of Mr. <hi>Lyn</hi>'s by
Marriage, had the Aſſurance to affirm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
young Squire <hi>Engliſh,</hi> Sir <hi>George</hi>'s
eldeſt Son, at Dinner at the Manſion
Houſe in <hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> that the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s whole Eſtate
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0250501500:13"/>
was owing to Mr. <hi>Lyn;</hi> for which, and
other unmannerly and indecent Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
he was rebuked, diſgraced, and
ſent back into <hi>Norfolk.</hi> Indeed Mr. <hi>Lyn</hi>
uſed frequently in publick to applaud
himſelf for his good Management of the
Eſtate, and to pronounce himſelf with
great Authority, the only Man in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
who knew how to keep a Rental.
He went farther, and frequently declared
that was it not for him, and his great Art
and Skill, the Tenants would not pay their
Rents, that they would forget all Reſpect
and Duty to Sir <hi>George,</hi> or join with Squire
<hi>Welſh</hi> in the Law-ſuit againſt him. Tho'
Squire <hi>Welſh</hi> and his Law-ſuit and Prenten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
were very low and deſpiſed, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
forgot by every body; yet Mr.
<hi>Lyn</hi> always endeavour'd to make his court
to his Maſter, by aſſuring him, that ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of his Tenants, thoſe I mean who held
the largeſt Farms, and whoſe Hearts were
always with Sir <hi>George,</hi> were ſecretly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourers
of the Pretenſions of Mr. <hi>Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſh;</hi>
this, Sir, indeed appears to me one of Mr.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0250501500:14"/>
               <hi>Lyn</hi>'s greateſt Iniquities, as I think a Pick-thank
in a Family is moſt odious Character.
But he was reſolved to ſupport his Power
at the Expence of every thing; and now
finding himſelf, as he imagin'd, at leaſt in
Truſt and Confidence with his Maſter,
(which we his poor Tenants hope is not real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
the Caſe) he raiſed his Creſt, and threw
out his natural Bronze. And as Inſolence
is ever the Mark of a little Mind, tho'
conſcious to himſelf of more Crimes than
any Man but himſelf can diſcover, he
ſlighted his Superiors and deſpiſed his Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents.
The Pariſh-Officers, the Aſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors
and Collectors of the Land-Tax, the
Conſtables, Portreve, and Jurymen, were
all his Creatures, Relations, Dependents
or Subdependents, ſuch whoſe Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Conſciences he could depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
Thus furniſhed, thus guarded and
ſupported, he ventur'd on, he levy'd Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
upon the Tenants on the moſt ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Pretence: an old Bridge was to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired,
a new one to be built, the Pariſh
wanted a Set of Bells, a new Pair of
Stocks muſt be provided; he made them
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0250501500:15"/>
contribute to the keeping ſeveral Packs
of Hounds; and ſometimes Maſter <hi>Lyn</hi>
wou'd demand a round Sum of Money
for private Uſes, and ſuch as were by
no means proper to be known to the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants.</p>
            <p>SIR <hi>George</hi> has a Park where his Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants
have Time out of Mind been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to recreate and refreſh at leiſure
Hours, as often as they pleaſed; and
thro' this Park many of them are oblig'd
to paſs every Day to their Grounds; Mr.
<hi>Lyn,</hi> who valued himſelf on his Genius for
raiſing Money, order'd his own Man to
ſtand before the Park-Gate, and levy a
Penny for the Paſſage of every Man, when
Buſineſs or Diverſions oblig'd him to paſs
that way; and this too under the Pretence
of ſetting up a pair of Gates only, tho' the
Money levy'd would new pale the whole
Park. And this I mention only to ſhew

HOWEVER, notwithſtanding all
the Diſcouragements that the Tenants lay
under, they might have thriven even under
the Stewardſhip of Mr. <hi>Lyn,</hi> if he had
not with the utmoſt Art and Application
laboured to prevent it. The two greateſt
and known Enemies to Induſtry and Trade,
are Luxury and Gaming: theſe he careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
encouraged; and in order to this, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
the Tenants to a large Gaming-table
which had been erected indeed in another
<hi>Robinocracy,</hi> in the very middle of the
Market-Place. To this Gaming-table the
Tenants, when they had diſpoſed of their
Wooll, their Corn, &amp;c. all hurry'd; and
as there is in moſt Men a Luſt after inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate
Gain, many of them play'd, and
every Day left behind them the Labours of
their Induſtry. But Mr. <hi>Lyn,</hi> ever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident
for himſelf, took care that this ſhould
turn to his Advantage; for (tho' he never
appeared there himſelf) he always employ'd
a few faithful Confidents to play for him,
and allow'd them to ſhare in ſome Parts of
the Spoil. It was always his Method when
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0250501500:17"/>
he play'd thus by Deputy, to uſe loaded
Dice, either high or low as he fancy'd; and
when ſome of the Tenants, who by dear
Experience were now grown very peery,
obſerv'd Mr. <hi>Lyn</hi>'s Dice in play, they
would very artfully, as they imagin'd, ſet
their Dice accordingly; that is, if they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Mr. <hi>Lyn</hi> uſed high Dice, they ſet
expecting them to run high, and ſo low,
when they ſaw his Dice run low; but when
the Stakes were deep enough to invite Mr.
<hi>Lyn</hi>'s Acceptance, they were always invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
changed upon them; and he was by
this ingenious Artifice Maſter of Part of
the Property of the Tenants. And as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
as he pleaſed, by this he amaſſed Wealth,
by this means the Manufactures of our
Country are very much hurt, and our Trade
decreaſes. This is at preſent the Caſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
our moſt righteous Steward; and they
tell me, there is nothing he delights in at
this Hour, ſo much as Gaming by Proxy,
and Fox-Hunting.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>I Believe my <hi>laſt</hi> hath convinc'd you that
Mr. <hi>Lyn</hi>'s management of Sir <hi>George</hi>'s
<hi>Domeſtick Affairs,</hi> was full as extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
as that of his <hi>Lawſuits</hi> with his <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours.</hi>
But perhaps you will wonder that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0250501500:19"/>
he ſhould be ſuffer'd to go on ſo long in
theſe Practices; that he hath not been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<hi>preſented</hi> every <hi>Court-day</hi> for ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
repeated Miſdoings; or that even all the
<hi>Tenants</hi> of the <hi>Mannor</hi> do not unanimouſly
make it their requeſt to Sir <hi>George</hi> (whoſe
Ears are always open to their Complaints)
that he would be pleaſed to remove a Stew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
whoſe Mananagement is generally diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked
and complained of by all the Tenants.
But your Surprize will vaniſh when you
recollect what I have told you in both my
former Letters; that all the <hi>Prime Officers</hi>
both of the <hi>Pariſh</hi> and the <hi>Mannor,</hi> as well
as moſt of the <hi>Jurymen,</hi> were his own <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations</hi>
or <hi>Creatures;</hi> that a great number of
the <hi>principal Tenants</hi> were bribed into his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
and that many others, who had ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt
Intentions, were afraid to oppoſe a
Man, who had it in his Power to <hi>raiſe their
Rent, diſtrain their Goods,</hi> or <hi>turn them out of
their Farms</hi> at Pleaſure, by repreſenting them
as <hi>bad Tenants</hi> or <hi>Enemies to their Landlord;</hi>
tho' theſe very People were the beſt affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0250501500:20"/>
to their Landlord, tho' they paid their
Rents punctually, and had no other deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
but that they faithfully adhered to
what they conceived to be the true Intereſt
of Sir <hi>George.</hi> In ſhort, it is the peculiar
Character of Mr. <hi>Lyn,</hi> That when he took
up a Prejudice, however unreaſonable, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt
any of the <hi>Tenants,</hi> he always <hi>made
it a POINT</hi> (as he call'd it) to <hi>ruin</hi> them
with Sir <hi>George,</hi> and ſtuck at nothing to
compaſs his End.</p>
            <p>YET notwithſtanding all this Power,
and this extravagant Uſe of it, there are
many Perſons of conſiderable Intereſt and
Figure in the <hi>Mannor,</hi> who have conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
oppoſed him in all theſe Proceedings, and
have, at preſent, the Pleaſure to ſee a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
Spirit of Reſentment riſing againſt him.
The Number of his <hi>Opponents</hi> increaſes dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly;
whilſt many, ſome even of <hi>thoſe,</hi> who
are <hi>obliged</hi> to act with him, are frequently
heard to murmur againſt his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
in publick as well as private; and
others who eat his Bread, as he is inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
<pb n="I6" facs="tcp:0250501500:21"/>
pleaſed to call it, Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Bread,
the Tenants Bread he means, hang down
their Heads; and conſcious of their Crime
in not oppoſing his Meaſures, plead guilty
to the Charge againſt him in their Silence.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Freemen</hi> of the Town, where
Sir <hi>George</hi> lives himſelf, are heartily, almoſt
univerſally, incenſed againſt him, on <hi>divers
Accounts;</hi> particularly for having introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
ſeveral <hi>New Cuſtoms</hi> amongſt them;
for always interpoſing his Authority in their
<hi>Elections of Pariſh-Officers;</hi> for making
them pay more for their <hi>Fewel</hi> than the reſt
of the Tenants; for refuſing to read a
<hi>Letter</hi> written in their behalf, on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,
and replying with an inſolent Air,
<hi>That he did not care a</hi> F—t <hi>for the whole

            </p>
            <p>GREAT Numbers of <hi>poor Tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi>
who ſupplied the late Sir <hi>George</hi>
with Neceſſaries, are ready to ſtarve for
want of the Money, he died in arrear
to them on that Account; which is the
more extraordinary, becauſe Sir <hi>George</hi>
had always a ſufficient Income to keep
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0250501500:22"/>
a noble Houfe, and pay every body, as
indeed he ſeem'd always inclinable to do;
from whence they conclude, That Mr.
<hi>Lyn</hi> embezzled great Sums himſelf, and
ſquandered away others, for his own Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
and Grandeur, amongſt a <hi>worſe kind
of TRADESMEN</hi> than they are.
Nay, what adds to the Provocation is,
That Mr. <hi>Lyn</hi> will not ſatisfy them <hi>whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they ſhall ever be paid or not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE <hi>neighbouring Country Gentlemen</hi>
complain of him for <hi>engroſſing the Game,</hi>

            <p>THE Clergy charging him with recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending

in the Church to old Sir <hi>George,</hi> when any

of Mr. <hi>Lyn.</hi>

            <p>THE <hi>Yeomanry</hi> grumble for want of

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0250501500:23"/>
think, after what has been ſaid, not very
unjuſtly, to Mr. <hi>Lyn,</hi> by engaging old Sir
<hi>George</hi> in a <hi>needleſs, expenſive</hi> and <hi>chimerical
Law-ſuit,</hi> and thereby preventing the uſual
<hi>Circulation</hi> of Money in Commerce, by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting
it into other <hi>Channels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN ſhort, all Ranks of Men (except a
<hi>few particular Creatures</hi> of his own) ſeem
to have their reſpective Complaints againſt
him, and unite in their Wiſhes for a <hi>new
Steward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NAY, we have a current Report about
the Country, that our <hi>preſent Landlord</hi>
(who is a Gentleman of <hi>great Penetration,</hi>
and applies himſelf very much to <hi>Buſineſs</hi>)
hath been, for ſome time, of the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
with his <hi>Tenants;</hi> and altho it may not
be convenient to diſcharge him at preſent, at
leaſt till his Accounts, which are in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Confuſion, are audited and ſettled, yet
it is certain that he hath already <hi>clipt his
Wings, and ſo ſhort too,</hi> that he is unable to
take his <hi>former Flights.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THIS hath a little ſunk his Creſt, and
ſoften'd his Behaviour to his <hi>Fellow-Tenants,</hi>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0250501500:24"/>
tho' he ſtill endeavours to keep up his uſual
Spirit of <hi>Defiance;</hi> but we can eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve,
from the frequent <hi>Tremulation of his
Voice, the faultring of his Accents, his Loſs
of Temper and Confuſion in his Sentences,</hi> that
he is inwardly very much <hi>chagrined</hi> and <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOU may remember, I told you, in my
<hi>firſt,</hi> that Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Eſtate (when he came
to it) was charged with an <hi>heavy Debt:</hi> And
that when Mr. <hi>Lyn</hi> was call'd upon to give
an Account of the <hi>great Sums of Money,</hi>
which had paſſed thro' his Hands, he always
refuſed to do it, and endeavoured to make a
Jeſt of <hi>thoſe</hi> who demanded it. But at length,
the general Clamour obliged him to conſent
to <hi>ſome Examination;</hi> upon which it appears,
even by his <hi>own Account,</hi> that his Maſter's
Eſtate is ſo far from being the <hi>better</hi> for his
Management, according to his <hi>former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
Declarations,</hi> that it is <hi>ſeveral hundred
Pounds more in debt,</hi> than it was before he
came into the <hi>Stewardſhip,</hi> notwithſtanding
the <hi>great Sums</hi> which ought to have been
<hi>yearly</hi> applied towards paying it off.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0250501500:25"/>
BUT his <hi>manner of ſtating Accounts</hi> is
ſo very extraordinary, that I believe you
will think it worth relating.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lyn</hi> hath always boaſted, that the
<hi>Family-Debt</hi> was very much <hi>diminiſhed</hi>
within theſe <hi>ten</hi> or <hi>eleven Years</hi> paſt, and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied</hi>
his Enemies to prove the contrary.
Now, in order to ſee whether this was true
or not, it was propoſed, firſt, to ſtate the
<hi>Debt,</hi> as it ſtood <hi>eleven</hi> Years ago, <hi>is all its
Branches.</hi> Then to deduct from it the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>yearly Sums,</hi> which have, or ought to
have been paid out of a certain <hi>ſtrong Box,</hi>
where the Savings from the Rents, after the
Expences of the Family were paid, were
conſtantly laid up, to diſcharge part of the
Mortgage upon the Eſtate, as it was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to do ſince <hi>that time;</hi> and afterwards to
compute the <hi>whole Debt, of every kind,</hi> which
the <hi>Family</hi> owes at <hi>preſent.</hi> It was agreed,
I think, that the <hi>Debt, eleven</hi> Years ago,
amounted to about 51000 <hi>l.</hi> The <hi>ſtrong
Box</hi> was ſaid to have produced, ſince <hi>that
time,</hi> about 7000 <hi>l.</hi> which reduces the Debt
(had no <hi>farther Debt</hi> been incurred, as the
Phraſe in vogue is) to 44000; and, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0250501500:26"/>
degree the <hi>preſent Debt</hi> ſhould appear to
be <hi>leſs than that Sum,</hi> ſo much, and no more,
ought to be allowed to be <hi>really diminiſhed,</hi>
ſince <hi>that Time,</hi> by the Management of Mr.
<hi>Lyn;</hi> ſince he could not pretend to arrogate
to himſelf the Merit of <hi>paying any Sums,
which would have paid themſelves</hi> had he let
them alone.</p>
            <p>THIS ſeem'd to be a fair <hi>Propoſal,</hi> as it
was generally eſteemed; but fair as it was,
Mr. <hi>Lyn</hi> demurred to it. At firſt, indeed, he
crack'd, bluſter'd, and defy'd, as uſual; at
length, with much Difficulty, he agreed to
give in ſome Account. Accordingly he
gave in his <hi>own State of the Account;</hi> and a
Day was appointed for the <hi>Enquiry;</hi> when
that came, he made a <hi>conſiderable Alteration</hi>
in his own Account. And having after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
acknowledged <hi>that he had quite forgot
ſeveral other considerable Sums of the Debt
contracted,</hi> he run his uſual Circle; he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted,
affirmed, deny'd, was poſitive, was
every thing but intelligible; he talk'd in
ſhort till he had not only made himſelf but
many of his Hearers giddy. There is not,
perhaps, ſo great a Maſter in <hi>Europe</hi> of the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0250501500:27"/>
grand Art of Bambouſle as Mr. <hi>Lyn:</hi> The
Debt (ſaid he) is incurred, but not increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed;
there are real Debts and nominal Debts;
there are real nominal Debts, and nominal
real Debts; there were real Debts and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal
Debts, which the Family muſt pay;
there are Debts never-ſtated tho 'incurred,
and Debts which tho' incurred and ſtated,
might never be paid; ſo that upon the whole
you ſee I have paid off a conſiderable part of
the Mortgage upon Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Eſtate: But
when he was told, that tho' it was true that
part of the <hi>Norfolk</hi> Mortgage was paid off,
yet Sir <hi>George</hi> was really now as much in
debt as before, becauſe Mr. <hi>Lyn,</hi> to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form
this mighty Deed, had borrow'd juſt
as much upon Sir <hi>George</hi>'s Eſtate in <hi>Leiceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi>
as he had paid off in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> ſo that
the Ballance continued as before; he broke
into a loud Laugh, and told the Tenants they
knew nothing of Accounts, nor the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
between a Debt incurred and a Debt
increaſed.</p>
            <p>BY the Help of theſe <hi>Diſtinctions,</hi> and
this Jumble of <hi>Sophiſtries,</hi> he ſtruck off one
Article of <hi>above three thouſand Pounds,</hi> which
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0250501500:28"/>
he aſſerted to be a <hi>very good Bargain to the
Family;</hi> another of almoſt <hi>two thouſand,</hi>
becauſe it was owing to <hi>very bad Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi>
and a third of <hi>one thouſand,</hi> for no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Reaſon, that I could hear, than that he
did not know how to <hi>juſtify the contracting</hi>
of it, or in what manner to provide <hi>for its
Payment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HE had alſo the Modeſty to place <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
conſiderable</hi> Sum amongſt the <hi>Debts diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged,</hi>
within <hi>that Time;</hi> which ought
really to have been placed amongſt <hi>thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is likewiſe worth obſerving, that Mr.
<hi>Lyn</hi> had previouſly taken care to puzzle and
perplex the <hi>Accounts</hi> as much as poſſible, in
order to ſecure himſelf from <hi>Detection,</hi> by
chopping and changing the <hi>Securities into
different Hands;</hi> borrowing of <hi>one</hi> to pay
off <hi>another;</hi> turning <hi>Intereſt</hi> into <hi>Principal,</hi>
and <hi>Principal</hi> into <hi>Intereſt;</hi> with a thouſand
other <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Stratagems</hi> of the ſame kind;
ſo that he had a manifeſt Advantage over
<hi>Thoſe</hi> who were not in the <hi>Secret.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0250501500:29"/>
NAY, what is ſtill more extraordinary,
he ſtated his Account of <hi>Debts contracted</hi> to
<hi>Chriſtmas laſt only;</hi> whereas he calculated the
Sum of <hi>Debts diſcharged</hi> to <hi>Lady-day</hi> next;
a Method of <hi>ſtating</hi> and <hi>ballancing Accounts,</hi>
which was never before practiſed or heard of
in theſe Parts!</p>
            <p>AND yet after all theſe <hi>Fineſſes</hi> and <hi>Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacies,</hi>
and <hi>arbitrary Poſtulata,</hi> the <hi>preſent
Family-Debt</hi> evidently appear'd to be, juſt
as it was <hi>eleven</hi> Years ago, <hi>fifty one thouſand
Pounds,</hi> or thereabouts.</p>
            <p>THO' it is generally believed here, that
this Affair will not redound much to the
Credit of Mr. <hi>Lyn;</hi> yet it muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed,
that his <hi>Arithmetical Capacity</hi> is really
admirable, and that he hath proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
beyond all Contradiction, to be a
complete Maſter of <hi>Addition,</hi> as well as
<hi>Subſtraction.</hi>
            </p>
