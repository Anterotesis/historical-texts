            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU are of an age when the heart opens to the moſt warm and generous impreſſions; an age, when all that gives worth and dignity to elevated rank, takes full poſſeſſion of the boſom. At this bright and unprejudiced criſis of your life, the precepts of Omar and the practice of Hamet, as drawn by Hawkeſworth, and dramatiſed by the author of this tragedy, will win upon your attention; not indeed by the attraction of poetry, but by the natural reverence which unſpotted youth ever renders, and with delight, to faithful
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:1193100700:4"/>repreſentations of wiſdom and of virtue; the wiſdom of the patriot, the virtue of the prince.</p>
            <p>That your Royal Highneſs may very long reflect bleſſings on the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and prove a diſtinguiſhed honour to the illuſtrious family who have that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous people in charge, is the zealous prayer, as it is the moſt empaſſioned expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THIS tragedy borrows its general ſtory, and ſome of its incidents, with as much of its ſentiment as could be preſerved, from the very beautiful <hi>"Almoran</hi> and <hi>Hamet"</hi> of Hawkeſworth. Except that truth and juſtice call for ſuch acknowledgement, it would on any other ſcore have been unneceſſary; for what can be added to the fame of a work univerſally celebrated? The original <hi>machinery</hi> has been rejected, becauſe it would have been too daring an attempt to interweave it with the fable of a modern compoſition, and perhaps too mighty a taſk to manage without violating the firſt great law of dramatick probability. At the ſame time, it has been the authour's moſt aſſiduous endeavour, to "convert the ſententious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of eaſtern wiſdom, as far as character would permit, into the language of paſſion, varied by every motive which might moſt forcibly affect the human mind in the moſt warm and intereſting ſituations." Theſe are the words of a critick, who ſeems fully to have penetrated the deſign of the author. The lines with inverted com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas were omitted in the repreſentation, to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour the rapidity of the action. They are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1193100700:6"/>in the printed copy, not more at the inſtance of particular friends, than on general experience that thoſe paſſages which retard the force of the paſſion on the theatre, are frequently read with moſt ſatisfaction in the cloſet.</p>
            <p>The Play ſtill continuing to be received on the ſtage with the moſt brilliant ſucceſs, the author would but half diſcharge the debt of equity were he to confeſs obligations to Hawkeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth only. The liberal, perhaps the unequalled ſupport which the managers have afforded by the ſcenery, the intereſting manner in which Mr. Linley has ſet the Epithalamium, the taſte of Mr. De Loutherberg, and the ſplendour which the performers have thrown over the characters by their EXCELLENT repreſentation, demand and receive the moſt warm and pointed expreſſions of gratitude. There remains but one tribute of juſtice more, and <hi>that</hi> is due to Mr. Sheridan, whoſe attention has, on this occaſion, been friendſhip, and whoſe aſſiſtance muſt always be fame.</p>

                  <hi>The following prologue, from an honour-giving muſe, of which it is truly worthy, did not arrive till after Mr. Banniſter was put in poſſeſſion of the excellent poetry which precedes it; and which another ingenious friend had been ſollicited to ſupply. The author of the tragedy, however, thinks Miſs Seward's compoſition too valuable to circulate only in manuſcript. Indeed, to keep ſuch verſes out of print, would not only be a private injury to the piece (which they will adorn) but an unpardonable injuſtice to the public.</hi>
