            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <byline>By <hi>Daniel D' Foe.</hi>
            </byline>
            <p>HAD the Subject of this Paper, been able to ſtay but one Week more, it had not been a Digreſſion; the determin'd Courſe of the <hi>Reviews,</hi> being then to Review to the Subject of Trade, and the general State of things; and as the daily Flux of Subject for this Paper is ſuch, that I diſpair to return yet a great while to my Original Deſign, as to <hi>France</hi>; I ſhall turn this Paper for the Preſent to be a <hi>Review</hi> of the State of the Nation; and I do not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige my ſelf that the next Volume may not bear that Title.</p>
            <p>I find a Paper Cry'd about Town, with an Unuſual Earneſtneſs; Entituled, the Lord <hi>H<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>ſham</hi>'s Speech, in the Houſe of Peers—I think my ſelf oblig'd, before I enter upon the Particulars, to make a ſhort Introduction, relating to my manner of Treating the Caſe I am upon, which is expected to be an Anſwer to that Paper.</p>
            <p>I am going to Anſwer my Lord <hi>H<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>ſham</hi>'s Speech; but if I may ſay any thing to certain Points, hinted at in the Paper, call'd by that Title; they are welcome to call mine an <hi>Anſwer,</hi> or what elſe they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>That the Lord <hi>H<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                     <desc>_…</desc>
                  </gap>ſham,</hi> made a Speech in the Houſe of Lords, is no part of my Enquiry, nor ſhall I meddle with what was Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted there, I know the Duty of an Author, with Reſpect to what is done or ſaid in that Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>The Paper Publiſh'd, I think, ſhows it ſelf in a double Capacity, <hi>as a Speech, and as a Pamphlet</hi>; as a Speech I have nothing to ſay to it; but as a Pamphlet with no Author's Name to it, it may be any bodies,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0158200400:2"/>
and may be Anſwer'd by any body; 'tis an Appeal to the People, a Challenge to every Reader; and I am at liberty, as well as another, to Remark upon it.</p>
            <p>As a Pamphlet, I ſay, I may be concern'd with it, and no otherwiſe; the Anonymous Author is nothing to me, be it a Lord or a Tinker; there is no Name to it, to Vouch the Particulars; and I believe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, no Man would ever ſet his Name to it, that valu'd the Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of his Character; either for Truth, Underſtanding, or Good Manners.</p>
            <p>Let the Speech be what it will, and whoſe it will, I muſt confeſs, the Publication of it ſeems to me, to have ſomething in it, that I cannot allow, to be the Noble Lords doing; whatever has an Air in its Countenance, Calculated or ſcrew'd up to a pitch of Malecontent and Chagrin, as if it was done on purpoſe to ſower the Nation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be Publiſh'd with a good deſign; let the Saying, or Speaking this any where, be done with what deſign it will, the Printing of it, can, in my Poor Opinion have no Meaning, but what is Miſchievous and Unpeaceable.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſtated the Caſe, between the <hi>Review</hi> and the <hi>Pamphlet</hi> I ſpeak of, I ſhall lead my Reader no farther about.</p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour to ſpeak as plain, as the Deference and Regard due to Dignity and Quality of Perſons will permit; I wiſh the Noble Lord, who they ſay made this Speech, would give me leave to An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, Paragraph by Paragraph every Article, without taking the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, Laws and Power furniſhes him with, upon any reaſonable Penalty, if I did not give, what even the whole Houſe of Lords ſhould determine a full Anſwer.</p>
            <p>But Limited by that Article of Quality, I ſhall refrain an Anſwer, as an Anſwer to this Speech, and only handle the Subject, without pointing at the Perſon.</p>
            <p>The firſt Paragraph, in the Paper above, which is all I ſhall recite, makes the Author Addreſs in the Firſt Perſon <hi>My Lords,</hi> as Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to ſomething he has to ſay, Relating to the State of the Nation; and Nothing, that <hi>the beſt way of Preſerving the Liberty of Speech, is to make uſe of it</hi>; tells them, he will ſpeak to three or four Generals very plainly; if he had ſaid Courſly, he <hi>had ſaid <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                  <item>4. The bringing over the Preſumptive Heir of the Crown to reſide here.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I begin with the laſt of theſe, and I ſhall no more take Notice, that theſe have been the Subject of any Speech; nor do I know they have been; I know this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle has been ſtarted in Print before now, by an Author, whoſe Principle is as well known as his Paper; and as his Propoſal I ſhall ſpeak to it, and of him I muſt ſay; as an Old Man ſaid to his Poor Nephew; who waited for his Death to come to his Eſtate; The <hi>young Fellow,</hi> Advis'd him to Remove to a certain Place in the Country for his Health, which, as he ſaid, was a better Air; <hi>I believe 'tis a better Air,</hi> ſays the Old Man, <hi>but I do not fanſie the Place: Why ſo, Sir,</hi> ſays the Nephew—<hi>Becauſe you Propoſe it,</hi> ſays he; <hi>for what can you get by my Livi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, Mr. <hi>Politicus,</hi> as this Author would be call'd, we could be glad to ſee the Heir of the Crown among us, but we cannot fancy the Propoſal, becauſe you make it; for what can your Party get by it? What Advantage can it be to your Party, to bring thoſe over, that we know you hate? And how can you think but we muſt ſuſpect your Integrity? An Old Lyon, that by his Age and Infirmities was grown heavy, and could hardly get his Living as he uſed to do; his Joynts ſtiff with the Exceſſes of his Youth, his Claws broke, and his Teeth rotten, juſt as it fares with Mr. <hi>Mercurius Politicus</hi>'s Party. To ſupply the Defects of his Power, with the Helps of his Cunning, feigns himſelf very ſick; and being near the point of Death, invites all his Subjects of the Horn and the Hoof, to come and viſit him; pretends he had great need of their Aſſiſtance; and withal, that it was very convenient to have them near him; and that he had ſeveral things to tell them for the publick Safety. Away comes the Inhabitants of the adjacent Woods, out of their Holes and ſecure places, where they were far enough out of his Reach, to Viſit this Old Devourer. When he had thus got them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Power, he watches his Opportunity, flies upon them, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours them all.</p>
            <p>Theſe old Stories, and Fifty more ſuch I could tell them, might give us very good Caution when theſe Foxes preach to beware of the Geeſe; but of that by the way. The Propoſal of bringing over the Princeſs of <hi>Hannover,</hi> is ſpecious, and ſeems to lay a Difficulty in the way of a great many honeſt ſubjects, as if not complying with it, ſhould be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for a Diſreſpect to that Illuſtrious Houſe, which will beſt appear, when a little farther Examin'd into; for all things are not to be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by their Outſides.</p>
            <p>No Man more ſincerely joins in the Satlement of the Succeſſion, and rejoyces in the Safety of <hi>England</hi> on that head, than the Author of this Paper; and when we talk of Inviting the Princes of the Line Royal hither, all that deſire their Peaceable Enjoyment of the Crown would without doubt bid them welcome, and be glad to ſee them round the Throne, as ſome call it.</p>
            <p>But when we talk of the Reſpect due to the Illuſtrious Branches of our Succeſſion, 'tis one thing; and when we talk of the Security and Safety of <hi>England,</hi> 'tis another: and in this Caſe, with all manner of Duty and Reſpect to the Succeſſors of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, I freely ſay, <hi>We are as ſecure without them as with them.</hi> To ſay it would be a fine
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0158200400:4"/>
Court, or a pleaſant thing; if all the Houſe of <hi>Hannover</hi> was here, a great deal of Gallantry and ſome Trade might be the Conſequence; this has ſomething in it, and not much: But when we talk of Safety and Danger, 'tis not the Diſtance of our Princes can influence the Matter; an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Parliament is the Security of <hi>England,</hi> againſt all the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Accidents, and how eaſy is all that Pretence fallen to the Ground now, in one Vote of the Houſe of Lords?</p>
            <p>Publick Safety is a fine gilded Pretence, and Sounds very popular; but it is not always meant moſt, where it is moſt talk'd of; and Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Queen, from the Heirs being at her Elbow; I cannot foreſee the Security of the Queen conſiſts in the hearts of her People, which I believe no Prince for ſome Ages has more intirely poſſeſs'd; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay the Queen had been more ſecure in the Life of the Duke of <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi>; it had been a Joy and Comfort both to the Queen and the whole Nation, if it had pleaſed God to have ſpared that Prince, whoſe Loſs is a Grief to all that reflect on it, and who have any value for their Sovereign.</p>
            <p>But ſtill as to Safety, as to the Publick Security, it conſiſts not in Perſons, but in things; if God for our ſins ſhould take away every Branch of that Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious Stock, from whence we hope for ſuch a Succeſſion of Princes; I am of Opinion, and think 'tis plain, the Foundation of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſtands too faſt to be ſhaken: 'Tis built upon this Fundemental Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xim of State, recorded in Parliament, and which all the Nation concurs in, <hi>That we will not have</hi> a Popiſh Prince <hi>to Reign over us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Parliament of <hi>England</hi> is our Security for the making this good; and it can neither add nor diminiſh to this Security, how or to what extent it may pleaſe God to lengthen the Lives of the Succeſſors to the Crown.</p>
            <p>Nor does it ſeem to me a matter of any great Moment, the acquainting the Heir with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Prelates; in our Caſe the preſent Preſumtive Heir being very unlikely to ſucceed; her Majeſty, God be praiſed, is in good Health, and much more likely to reign 30 or 40 years; God forbid I ſhould ſtint her Majeſty, than a Princeſs of above 70 is to ſucceed; and in this Caſe I would fain ask Mr. <hi>Politicus,</hi> Who would you have brought over? if you examine the Heirs to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Crown, 'tis three to one againſt all the three alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> ſhall enjoy it; I mean as to reſpect of Age and natural Probabilities: 'Tis 20 to one againſt the old Lady, the immediate Preſumtive Heir; to what pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe then would they bring that Princeſs over in her old Age, but to ſhortten her Days by changing the Air and her manner of Living? 'Tis then at leaſt an even Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt the Elector Regent, and I know no body ſo weak to talk of his Highneſs coming over, to quit his Soverign Dominion, and the Adminiſtration of his Affairs, to come hither to live in the Quality of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobleman, and wait for the Queen Shoes who is, God be thank'd, likely to live as long as himſelf.</p>
