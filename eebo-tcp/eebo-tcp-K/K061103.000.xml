            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <l>A fault, in modern Authors not uncommon,</l>
                  <l>It is,—now don't be angry—He's—<hi>a woman.</hi>

                  <l>The Play, perhaps, has many things amiſs:</l>

                     <p>Couſin, couſin Harmony, I will not forgive you for thus continually ſpeaking in the behalf of every ſervant whom you find me offended with. Your philanthropy becomes inſupportable; and, inſtead of being a virtue, degenerates into a vice.</p>

                     <p>Very true; you had it from your infancy. I have heard your mother ſay you were always fooliſhly tender-hearted, and never ſhewed one of thoſe diſcriminating paſſions of envy, hatred, or revenge, to which all her other children were liable.</p>

                     <p>No: ſince I can remember, I have felt the moſt unbounded affection for all my fellow creatures. I even proteſt to you, dear Madam, that, as I walk along the ſtreets of this large metropolis, ſo warm is my heart towards every perſon who paſſes me, that I long to ſay, "How do you do?" and

We live in the ſame ſtreet, without knowing one another's neceſſities; and oftentimes meet and part from each other at church, at cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-houſes, play-houſes, and all public places, without ever ſpeaking a ſingle word, or nodding "Good bye!" though 'tis a hundred chances to ten we never ſee one another again.</p>

                     <p>Let me tell you, kinſman, all this pretended philanthropy renders you ridiculous. There is not a fraud, a theft, or hardly any vice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, that you do not take the criminal's part, ſhake your head, and cry, "Proviſions are ſo ſcarce!" And no longer ago than laſt Lord-mayor's-day, when you were told that Mr. Alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Ravenous was ill with an indigeſtion, you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſoften the matter, by exclaiming, "Proviſions are ſo ſcarce!"—But, above all, I condemn that falſe humanity, which induces you to ſay many things in converſation which deſerve to ſtigmatize you with the character of deceit.</p>

enemies friends—Juſt by ſaying a few harmleſs ſentences, which, though a ſpecies of falſehood and deceit, yet, being ſoothing and acceptable to the perſon offended, I have immediately inſpired him with lenity and forgiveneſs; and then, by only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating the ſelf-ſame ſentences to his opponent, I have known hearts cold and cloſed to each other, warmed and expanded, as every human creature's ought to be.</p>

                     <p>Mr. Solus, it is very uncivil of you to praiſe her before my face. Lady Ramble, at the time I parted with her, had every poſſible fault both of mind and perſon, and ſo I made love to other women in her preſence; told her bluntly that I was tired of her; that <q>I was very ſorry to make her uneaſy, but that I could not love her any longer.</q>—And was not that frank and open?</p>

                     <p>In years I am certainly older than ſhe; but the difference of ſex makes her a great deal older than I am.

                     <p>Why then, Sir Robert—I am almoſt aſhamed to ſay it—but circumſtances have been rather unfavourable.—My wife's father <stage>affecting to ſmile</stage> is not reconciled to us yet—My regiment is broke —My Uncle will not part with a farthing.—Lady Eleanor, my wife, <stage>wipes his eyes</stage> has been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported as yet, with ſome little degree of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, elegance; and—in ſhort, I owe a ſmall ſum which I am afraid of being troubled for; I want a trifle alſo for our immediate uſe, and if you would lend me a hundred pounds—though, upon my honour, I am not in a ſituation to fix the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act time when I can pay it.</p>

                     <p>And is it not very common to be rich without money? Are not half the town rich? And yet half the town has no money. I ſpeak for this end of the town, the Weſt end. The Squares, for inſtance, part of Piccadilly, down St. James's-ſtreet, and ſo home by Pall Mall. We have all, eſtates, bonds, drafts, and notes of hand without number; but as for money, we have no ſuch thing belonging to us.</p>

                     <p>I <hi>am</hi> in affluence, I am, I am; but not in ſo much, perhaps, as my haſty, inconſiderate account may have given you reaſon to believe. I forgot to mention ſeveral heavy incumbrances, which you will perceive are great drawbacks on my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.—As my wife ſued for the divorce, I have her fortune to return; I have alſo two ſiſters to portion off—a circumſtance I totally forgot. But, my good friend, though I am not in circumſtances to do what you require, I will do ſomething that ſhall be better. I'll wait upon your father-in-law, (Lord Norland) and entreat him to forgive his daughter: and I am ſure he will if I aſk him.</p>

And whenever you ſhall do me the favour to call upon me, I ſhall be heartily glad to ſee you. If I am not at home, you can leave your card, which, you know, is all the ſame, and depend upon it, I ſhall be extremely glad to ſee you or that, at any time. <stage>Exit.</stage>

I may leave my card at their door, but as for me, or any one of mine, they would not give us a dinner; unleſs, indeed, it was in ſuch a ſtyle, that we might behold with admiration their grandeur, and return ſtill more depreſſed, to our own poverty.—Can I bear this treatment longer?

                     <p>I TELL you, Mr. Harmony, that if an indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſon, one on whom I had never beſtowed a favour in my life, were to offend me, it is in my nature never to forgive.

                     <p>The weakeſt argument you can uſe. As my child, was not ſhe moſt bound to obey me? As my child, ought ſhe not to have ſacrificed her own happineſs to mine?

                     <p>I believe you;—and in compaſſion to the child, give you my <hi>ſolemn promiſe</hi> never to reveal who he is.

                     <p>Do you ſuppoſe I ſearched for him? No;—he was forced upon me. A woman followed me, about eight years ago, in the fields adjoining to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0605200800:49"/>
my country ſeat, with a half-ſtarved boy in her hand, and aſked my charity for my grand-child: the impreſſion of the word, made me turn round involuntarily; and caſting my eyes upon him, I was rejoiced, not to find a feature of his mother's in all his face; and I began to feel ſomething like pity for him. In ſhort, he caught ſuch faſt hold by one of my fingers, that I aſked him careleſsly "if he would go home and live with me?" On which, he anſwered me ſo willingly "Yes," I took him at his word.</p>

All my hopes of reſtoring her health reſt on one proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect—that of finding a man worthy my recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for her ſecond huſband, and, by creat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſecond paſſion, expel the firſt.—Mr. Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, you and I have been long acquainted—I have known your diſpoſition from your infancy— Now, if ſuch a man as you were to offer—</p>

                     <p>I muſt firſt inform you, that Lord Norland has juſt drawn from me a promiſe, that I will once more enter into the marriage-ſtate; and without knowing to whom he intends to give me, I will keep my promiſe—But it is in vain to ſay, that, though I mean all duty and fidelity to my ſecond huſband, I ſhall not experience moments when my thoughts—will wander on my firſt.</p>

                     <p>Madam, I will moſt undoubtedly take this bond to my friend; but will you give me leave to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to you, that the perſon on whom you beſtow your hand, may be a little ſurpriſed to find, that while he is in poſſeſſion of you, Sir Robert is in the poſſeſſion of your fortune?</p>

                     <p>Do not imagine, Sir, that I ſhall marry any man, without firſt declaring what I have done—I only wiſh at preſent it ſhould be concealed from Lord Norland—When this paper is given, as I have required, it cannot be recalled; and when that is paſt, I ſhall divulge my conduct to whom I pleaſe; and firſt of all, to him, who ſhall offer me his addreſſes.</p>

                     <p>And if he is a man of my feelings, his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes will be doubly importunate for this proof of liberality to your former huſband. — But are you ſure, that in the return of this bond, there is no ſecret affection, no latent ſpark of love?</p>

                     <p>None. I know my heart; and if there was, I could not aſk you, Mr. Harmony (nor any one like you), to be the meſſenger of an imprudent paſſion. Sir Robert's vanity, I know, may cauſe him to judge otherwiſe; but undeceive him; let him know this is a ſacrifice to the golden princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of duty, and not an offering to the tinſelled ſhrine of love.

                     <p>Ah! that I had never married! never known what marriage was! for, even at this moment, I feel its torments in my heart.</p>

                     <p>I have often heard of the torments of matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; but I conceive, that at the worſt, they are nothing more than a kind of violent tickling, which will force the tears into your eyes, though at the ſame time you are burſting your ſides with laughter.</p>

                     <speaker>SOLUS.</speaker>
                     <p>Now I think marriage is an excellent remedy for the ſpleen. I have known a Gentleman at a feaſt receive an affront, diſguiſe his rage, ſtep home, vent it all upon his wife, return to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, and be as good company as if nothing had happened.</p>

A wife, then, binds up your head, mixes your powders, bathes your temples, and hovers about, in a way that is moſt endearing.</p>

                     <p>That, I cannot ſend in. But tell him, Sir, I am the afflicted wife of a man, who for ſome weeks paſt has given many fatal proofs of a diſordered mind. In one of thoſe fits of phrenſy, he held an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of death, meant for his own deſtruction, to the breaſt of your Lord (who by accident that moment paſſed), and took from him, what he vainly hoped might preſerve his own life, and relieve the wants of his family. But his paroxyſm over, he ſhrunk from what he had done, and gave the whole he had thus unwarrantably taken, into a ſervant's hands to be returned to its lawful owner. The man, admitted to this confidence, betrayed his truſt, and inſtead of giving up what was ſo ſacredly delivered to him, ſecreted it; and, to obtain the promiſed reward, came to this houſe, but to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form againſt the wretched offender; who now, only reſting on your Lord's clemency, can eſcape the direful fate he has incurred.</p>
