            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THeſe Sheets having, with their unhappy Author, fall'n into the barbarous and unjuſt Hands of the late Miniſtry, had never ſeen the Light, had not Providence ſeem'd to reſerve them for two Ends:</p>
            <p n="1">1. As a ſtanding Monument of the dext'rous Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of a certain moſt exquiſite States-man, whoſe ſtrictest Scrutiny all theſe Papers past, and yet came home as Things relating to the Author's private Concerns, and with them ſeveral other Manuſcripts, which no body but ſuch an over-vigilant Miniſter would ha' parted with.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As a Subject for which there was yet a more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Juncture coming, when it would be more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily uſeful.</p>
            <p>They were wrote three Years ago, juſt at the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the laſt Parliament; but with very few Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſeem ſo exactly calculated to the preſent Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that the Author thought he could do no leſs than let the World ſee them.</p>
            <p>He hopes the Advice may be uſeful, <hi>the utmoſt Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of all his Actions</hi>: He is ſure it cannot be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſive
<pb facs="tcp:0203400400:3"/>
to any Man, whoſe Principle is the Good of his Country; they that want Advice, it may do good to; they that want it not, it can do no harm to.</p>
            <p>The Tendency of this, as of all he writes, is the general Peace of Parties, a Subject never to be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently purſued and embrac'd by all honeſt Men in this Nation, as that without which we are undone at home, ruin'd abroad, and muſt, at laſt, fall a Prey to the invading Power of Popery and Foreigners.</p>
            <p>As its Tendency makes it uſeful, ſo the Juncture of Affairs makes it ſeaſonable, and particularly ſo, by how much in this ſecond Struggle, now making for Members of Parliament all over this Unhappy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, we find a vigorous Effort to get into the Houſe making by Men of the ſame Violence in Principle, and inclin'd to the ſame Strife and Diviſion; tho' Thanks be to God, and the Queen, with much leſs Proſpect of Succeſs.</p>
            <p>The Author thinks nothing can juſtifie his publiſhing them better, than their being both uſeful and ſeaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable; for the reſt, he leaves them to the World to make Uſe of them as they pleaſe; and if not to the publick Advantage, 'tis none of his Fault.</p>

            <head>ADVICE TO All PARTIES.</head>
            <p>HE that gives his Advice before it is ask'd, expects no Fee for his Counſel; and ſo the Author of theſe Sheets ſtands clear from the Scandal of Bribery.</p>
            <p>If the Gifts of the Spirit qualify a Man for Teaching his Neighbours; by the ſame Rule, if any Man knows more than another, he may tell him his Mind, and then every one is free to do what he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>The Author, tho' he is no profeſs'd States-man, may paſs for a gifted Brother that way: If he ſays nothing to the Purpoſe, yet hear him; and if he ſays any thing that is to the Purpoſe, hear him, and no more.</p>
            <p>Whatever the World may ſay of him, they cannot ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine him to be ſuch a Fool, as to think he ſhall pleaſe every Body. What ſuits the Wiſe-man, won't pleaſe the Fool: If the Honeſt-man is contented, the Knaves will murmur: Peace won't pleaſe the Soldier, nor Plenty the Farmer: Truth will pleaſe the Wiſe-man; and he that cannot diſcern it, is a Fool worth no Body's Notice.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0203400400:5"/>
The World is made up of a Conjunction of Contraries, and the Harmony is the more admirable: So the Times diſcover a Conjunction of oppoſite Parties, which if they can be brought to keep the Peace, the Union wou'd be ſomething wonderful.</p>
            <p>Before we come to talk with the Gentlemen concern'd, 'twill be needful to ſeparate the Party's Sheep and Goats, Birds of a Feather; ſet every Sort by themſelves, with their Characters and Deſcriptions, that all People may look out and know them, and look in and know which ſort they belong to.</p>
            <p>We are at preſent the moſt divided Nation in <hi>Europe,</hi> the Jeſt of all the World. The <hi>Polanders</hi> are Fools to us: We have among us, as ſome have obſerv'd, three or four and thirty ſorts of Religions, and twelve or thirteen Severals in Politicks. In Religion, here are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> and <hi>Jews, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts</hi> and <hi>Proteſtants, Heathens, Pagans, Idolaters,</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts,</hi> worſe than any of them, <hi>Deists, Anti-Deists, Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, Arminians, Pelagians, Gnoſticks, Donatists, Adamites, Sweet-ſingers, Enthuſiasts, Families of Love, Arians, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomians, Free-willers, Seventh-day Men, Univerſal Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptioners, Aſgilites, Quietists, Lutherans, Calvinists, Hugo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots, Church of</hi> England <hi>Men</hi> of ſeveral Sorts, <hi>Puritans, Preſbyterians, Independants, Anabaptists, Quakers, Fifth-Monarchy Men,</hi> and the D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>l and all—. If but one Sort of theſe are in the right, God knows which Sort that is, and the Lord have Mercy on all the reſt. If all Sorts may be in the right, then 'tis no Matter what Sort a Man's of, and there's no need of any Strife about the Matter.</p>
            <p>In Matters of Politicks, the numerous Kinds have obtain'd the Sir-names of <hi>Court-party</hi> and <hi>Country-party, Tories, Whigs, Trimmers, Loyalist, Royalist, Commonwealths-men, Williamites, Jacobites, High Church, Low Church,</hi> and <hi>No Church, Non Jurants</hi> or <hi>Church Diſſenters, Church VVhigs,</hi> and abundance of other Sorts, which the Cuſtom of the Times has been pleas'd to give Titles to.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0203400400:6"/>
But when all theſe Names are made uſe of, with many more, by way of Contempt upon one another, to ſhew our Want of Good-nature, as well as Want of Manners; the real unhappy Differences of this Nation ſeem to lie among the Parties at Court that lately had the Miniſtry, and thoſe that have it now; between the Furioſo's in the Church, who are for carrying all before them, and the Moderate Men in the Church, who are for Peace joyn'd with the Diſſenters, who are for the Liberty they enjoy being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd.</p>
            <p>To theſe Gentlemen the following Advice is directed: If they think 'tis good, they'll accept the Hint, or come under the Claſs of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Fools, that hate Inſtruction: If they contemn it, they ought to ſhew a Reaſon for it, or elſe they are in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Reach again; <hi>He that judges of a Matter before he hears it, 'tis Folly and Shame unto him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Temerity in Politicks, is certainly the moſt impolitick thing in the World. Too much Haſte may do Harm, but ſeldom does Good; and one wou'd think, the late Reign of King <hi>James</hi> might be a <hi>Memento mori</hi> to all the Sons of <hi>Jehu</hi> either in Church or State.</p>
            <p>He is certainly the Friend of ſuch Men, who adviſes them to check their Career before they go too far; becauſe ſuch Tempers always run on to their own Confuſion as well as other People's.</p>
            <p>But, to tell who I mean without going far about, There's a ſort of People among us, who, after their <hi>Tears of Joy</hi> for the Death of King <hi>William</hi> were dry'd up, began to be comforted very early with the Halcyon Days of Queen <hi>Ann</hi>; and, as if they had made their Conditions with her before hand, they gave a Looſe to their Paſſions, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Satisfaction, in the Country Coffee-Houſes, in Terms like theſe:—<hi>Well Boys!</hi> Now <hi>we ſhall have brave Times again.</hi> Brave Times! ſays his honeſt Neighbour, who was melancholly ſtill for the Nation's Loſs; <hi>VVhy,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0203400400:7"/>
               <hi>what's the Matter?</hi> Matter! why, <hi>we have got a Church of</hi> England <hi>Queen, and all theſe damn'd Phanaticks will go down again.</hi> We'll have them all <hi>turn'd out now.</hi> We'll have <hi>no more Canting within the Noiſe of our Church Bells,</hi> no <hi>Tub-preaching,</hi> no <hi>Barn-meeting,</hi> no <hi>VVhiggiſh Juſtices now, that a poor Man can't get a Cup of Beer in his Crown of a Sunday after Sermon, but his Neighbour ſhall be plaguing him with the Stocks: And if he happen to ſwear an Oath, or ſo to be teaz'd with Informers, that a Man can't take a Glaſs of VVine after Sermon, but he ſhall be Fin'd and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd for it; here has been ſuch a Splutter with your</hi> Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of Manners <hi>and your</hi> Dutch <hi>Government. VVe have an</hi> Engliſh <hi>Queen, and a true Church of</hi> England <hi>Queen, and down you go: VVe'll have your Meeting-houſes about your Ears quickly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is Matter of Fact, that this was the Diſcourſe not in the Mouths of here and there a Fool, but of a whole Party, I'll at any time ſet my Name to the Charge; and I ſuppoſe no Body need put me upon the Proof.</p>
            <p>Nor was Her Majeſty's Declaration to Her Council, or Speeches to the Parliament, or Her Anſwers to the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters Addreſſes, of any Weight with theſe ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; tho' Her Majeſty took exceeding Care, on all Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, to make all her Subjects eaſy, by giving them Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, Firſt, that ſhe would be a Religious Obſerver of Her Royal Word; and then giving Her Royal Word, that ſhe would maintain the Toleration, and give Her Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the Diſſenters.</p>
            <p>Let me tell thoſe Gentlemen, that they are guilty of two Crimes; Firſt, great Indiſcretion, in ſhewing their Teeth, before the Muzzle which the Laws have put upon them is taken off, and that they have no Power to bite. Secondly, So much want of Manners and Reſpect, that ſhou'd the Author write half ſo much Satyr upon the Queen in this Book, 'tis to be thought he wou'd write
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0203400400:8"/>
himſelf into <hi>Newgate,</hi> and very well he wou'd deſerve it.</p>
            <p>What can the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of ſuch Language be other than this; That the Queen made ſuch Promiſes of Protection to the Diſſenters, and continuing the Toleration, only to quiet their Minds at her firſt Acceſſion, and 'till ſhe is ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the Throne, or perhaps 'till the War abroad is over; but ſhe does not deſign to keep her Promiſe with them, but they ſhall all be ſuppreſs'd as ſoon as Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offers? And <hi>truly, Gentlemen, Her Majeſty is very much beholden to you.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſhort Advice the Author thinks fit to give ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, is, to hold their Tongues, and have more Manners than to affront the Queen at ſo impudent a Rate; and ſince they have ſhown their good Will, let them be quiet 'till their time comes, leſt Her Majeſty being inform'd of their Rudeneſs, ſhould think fit to give the Nation a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Aſſurance of Her Juſtneſs to Her Promiſes, by puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them for their raiſing a Scandal upon her Vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
            <p>A ſecond ſort of People, which the Author pretends to give Advice to, are ſuch, as upon the Queen's Diſſolving Her firſt Parliament, and Calling a New one, pretended to tell us what brave things that approaching Parliament would do for them.</p>
            <p>We have now gotten a Church-Parliament, a Loyal Church-of<hi>-England</hi> Parliament, ſay they, and now we will do your Buſineſs, and this Parliament ſhall ſet us all to Rights again. Now, we'll diſmount the Two Bulwarks of Whiggiſh Hopes; for this Parliament ſhall repeal the Act of Toleration, and the Settlement of the Crown: They ſhall leave the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Throne to be, as it always was, Hereditary, and let Right Line and Deſcent take place; that <hi>Engliſh</hi> Loyalty may flouriſh, and the Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives of Princes be no more invaded, nor the Nation be govern'd by <hi>Dutch-</hi>Men and Foreigners.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0203400400:9"/>
I believe no Body will diſpute with me the Truth of Fact, that this was the Talk, not of a ſingle Perſon, or of a few, but of a Party, their Common, their Table, their Coffee-Houſe Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>How to comment upon ſuch Inſolence, I hardly know: This <hi>is an Iniquity to be puniſh'd by the Judge.</hi>—And if the Houſe of Commons did not take Cogniſance of ſuch People, it was, becauſe they reſtrained their Reſentment of ſuch Affronts more than any Houſe of Commons ever did before them.</p>
            <p>As to the laſt Parliament, the Author has no Buſineſs to ſay any thing of their Religion: But, I think, all our Parliaments have been Church-Parliaments; nor is there any Doubt but they always will be ſo. But what ſort of Doings is this with Parliaments, if they are to be antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated, led by a Party, and told before-hand what they ſhall do.</p>
            <p>If this ſort of People conferr'd with the Members, and concerted with them before-hand, what ſhould or ſhould not be done; if ſo, we had then ſuch a Parliament as never was before.</p>
            <p>But if theſe Gentlemen did this only to inflame Parties, only to let us ſee what they wou'd have done, what Deſign they were driving at, 'tis time for the Nation to open their Eyes, and examine who they are.</p>
            <p>The Act of Settlement, is the Foundation on which the Nation ſtands: 'Tis the ſacred Pillar of the preſent Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and on it may be very well plac'd the <hi>Scotch</hi> Motto, <hi>Nemo me Impune Laceſſit:</hi> 'Tis the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

            </p>
            <p>Now, 'tis worthy of Remark, that the Gentlemen who talk of repealing the Act of Settlement, don't do it barely becauſe the Crown is not thereby limited to their liking: But they are for repealing it as a thing not legal in its own Nature; they wou'd have the Parliament diſown the Right of Limiting the Crown, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge a Right of Succeſſion <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> That Kings of all Religions or Principles, muſt be ſubmitted to, if they come of the Race; That the Right Line muſt ſucceed, and 'tis not in the Power of the People of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> either Collectively or Repreſentatively, to queſtion their Princes, or to oppoſe their Oppreſſive unjuſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.—The latent Conſequences of this will come in at laſt; <hi>viz.</hi> That the late Revolution was an Act of Rebellion againſt God and the King; That it was a Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence offered to God's Vicegerent, againſt Juſtice and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance; That King <hi>William</hi> was an Invader of another Man's Right, an Uſurper, and a Tyrant; and ſo we are all a coming, Gentlemen, to the old Point again, <hi>Paſſive Obedience, Non-Reſiſtance, Diſpenſing Power,</hi> and all the Abſurdities and ridiculous Contradictions of the late Reigns come into play again, and we have ſpent thirteen Years War, a Maſs of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Money, and a Sea of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Blood to a fine Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This is one Deſign, in ſtriking at the Act of Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, another is to ſupplant the Houſe of <hi>Hannover,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, forſooth, they don't like them. They are aſham'd to own what they wou'd have; but the Caſe is ſo plain, that it needs no Comment. A late Author has publiſh'd the Life of King <hi>James</hi>; and, taking no Notice of this Act, ſays, <q rend="inline">"King <hi>James</hi> died, and left one Son, and
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0203400400:11"/>
two Daughters."</q> Now, what is the Language of this Party? <hi>If we must ſubmit to the Queen's reigning before her Brother, becauſe ſhe is Crown'd, and has Poſſeſſion, we can't help it; but we are</hi> next Oars<hi>, and there is no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to expel the reſt of his Family: Here is a</hi> Son <hi>and a</hi> Daughter<hi>; we may have them home, make Proteſtants of them, and never run up into</hi> Germany <hi>for an old VVoman, and her</hi> Dutch <hi>Progeny to reign over us.</hi>

            <p>Here is the plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> of the Deſign, a Deſign, which aims at the Root and fundamental Part of our Conſtitution; and tho' there is no great Danger of the thing, yet 'tis plain they puſh at it with all their Might.</p>
            <p>As to this Act of Settlement: Firſt, The Queen who reigns by Virtue of ſuch a Settlement, has not once, but ſeveral times given Her Royal Promiſe to maintain it: So that if ever ſuch an unhapp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

What will any new Settlements of the Crown, that may be made, amount to, if the People of <hi>England,</hi> who have an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right to the Government of themſelves, ſhou'd contradict them at the Time they wou'd enter upon the Poſſeſſion, with this general Negative, <hi>VVe will not have this Man to reign over us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Safety of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, reſts in, and depends upon themſelves. <hi>The People of England</hi> are a Security to <hi>the People of England,</hi> for a Preſervation of all their own eſſential Right; and among the reſt, this is the chief,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0203400400:12"/>
to be govern'd by <hi>Princes of their own Nomination,</hi> and Laws of <hi>their own making.</hi> No Prince can reign here, but by the Conſent of the People; and by <hi>no Laws,</hi> but ſuch as become Laws by the Conſent of the People: It has been in vain attempted to bug-bear the Nation into Villenage and Vaſſalage; but the Liberties of <hi>England</hi> have always been like the Stone in the Goſpel, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever has fallen againſt them, has been broken to pieces; and on whomſoever they have fallen, has been ground to Powder.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation has not many more Liberties than they had before; but they know them better than they did.</p>
            <p>We know now, that <hi>our Princes are circumſcrib'd</hi> by the Laws and Conſtitutions of the Nation, are oblig'd to govern juſtly, and perform the Stipulation of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment declar'd in two Acts of Parliament: We know, that if they iſſue out illegal Commands, 'tis no Treaſon to diſobey. If a Prince ſhou'd levy Money by Arbitrary Authority, any Free-holder may refuſe to pay it, and be guilty of no Crime: If 'tis levied by Force, he may op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it with Force, and yet be no Rebel.</p>
            <p>We know the very Parliament themſelves cannot diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence with the Law, but in a Parliamentary Way: No Law can ceaſe to be a Law, 'till repeal'd by the ſame Power that made it; and nothing can have the Force of a Law in <hi>England,</hi> but what has the People's Conſent in Parliament.</p>
            <p>The Power of Parliament, and how far the Members are accountable to their Principals, is not for me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine; but this I venture to ſay, that without Doubt a Member of Parliament is to have ſome Regard, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, to the Inclination of the People he ſerves, at leaſt, not to act what he knows is contrary to their Deſire.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0203400400:13"/>
'Tis plain, that the Act of Settlement is the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable thing in the Government, as the Security we have againſt future Slavery: <hi>'Tis the Account we are to give to our Children of our Care for their Safety:</hi> 'Tis the Bulwark of the Nation againſt Popery and Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; and none but the Enemies of our Liberties can wiſh to ſee it repeal'd. 'Tis our double Security; <hi>Firſt,</hi> As it is an Acknowledgment of the People's Power to li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the Crown; and <hi>Secondly,</hi> As it has <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>fectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd the Rights of the Subject, their Liberties, and juſt Privileges, under ſuch as ſhall reign hereafter.</p>
            <p>Some have thought, that the Party in a certain Houſe, who made it their Buſineſs to limit, thwart, and affront the late King <hi>VVilliam,</hi> particularly as to the Matter of the Army, and afterwards the Grants of Lands in <hi>Ireland,</hi> while they carried on their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Pique at the King, involuntarily and unwarily ſet their Hands to the Peoples Liberties, and made ſuch Declarations of the Rights of the Subject, as they wou'd be glad to have now undone if they could; if they were led into this by another Party, they were trick'd with a Vengeance: But a learned Gentleman, who was formerly a great <hi>Jure Divino Man,</hi> was pleas'd to ſay of it with an Oath, <hi>VVe are going to make our ſelves all Kings, only to croſs one King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let the Deſign ha' been what it will, the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples Liberties were recognized by ſome Gentlemen; who, if it ſhould ha' been told them formerly, <hi>that they would ha' done ſo and ſo,</hi> wou'd ha' anſwer'd with the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> Captain; <hi>Is thy Servant a Dog,</hi> that he ſhould do theſe things?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0203400400:14"/>
To theſe, and all the Gentlemen of that Party, who aim at altering the Act of Settlement, our Advice is ſhort, <hi>Have a Care, Gentlemen, what you do:</hi> Methinks you ſhou'd not have the Face to expect, or the Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to deſire the Queen to break her Word, the Parliament-Men to act contrary to the Intereſt and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination of the People that choſe them, a Papiſt ſet upon the Throne, a repudiated Impoſtor acknowledg'd, an abjur'd Race receiv'd. 'Tis true, all Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may, as Acts, be repeal'd by Parliament; but ſome things are in their own Nature to be continued; this can't be repeal'd; if the Queen ſhou'd break her Word, which 'tis baſe to ſuppoſe, even if the Parliament ſhou'd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: <hi>VVho ſhall abſolve us of an Abjuration Oath?</hi> Who ſhall reconcile the Nation to a <hi>French</hi> and Popiſh Prince? The Meaning is only Confuſion and Diſtraction, and the End will certainly be the Deſtruction of all that ſhall ever attempt it; and therefore I think it as kind a piece of Counſel as can be given; <hi>Gentlemen, have a Care</hi>; for you will certainly miſcarry in the Attempt. Popery and Slavery will never go down with this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Popery is ſo formidable a thing, that the very Name of it wou'd ſet the whole Nation in an Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar: Thoſe that do not underſtand it, hate it by Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and I believe there is a hundred thouſand plain Country-Fellows in <hi>England,</hi> wou'd ſpend their Blood againſt <hi>Popery, that do not know whether it be a Man or a Horſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let ſuch People therefore <hi>have a Care,</hi> the People of <hi>England</hi> provok'd, are not eaſily appeas'd: Let them remember the Conſternation they were in 16 Years ago, when the Reſentment of the People of <hi>England</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0203400400:15"/>
hung over the Heads of a whole Party: And let them reſt aſſur'd,</p>
            <p>The Act of Settlement, and Limitation of the Crown, with the Recognition of the Peoples Rights, are the very things the War, the Revolution, and the Diſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of King <hi>James</hi> were made for: Theſe were the Port the whole Nation ſteer'd for, and <hi>this Nation will never part with them.</hi> Now, <hi>they are ſafe,</hi> they can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have any Tyrant, <hi>but by their own Conſent</hi>; and if ever they are Slaves again, they muſt do it themſelves, and <hi>no Body will pity them.</hi>

            <p>The next ſort of People, to whom theſe Sheets are directed, by way of Caution or Advice, are,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The late Miniſtry.</p>
            <p>To you, Gentlemen, the Author directs himſelf without any thing of Satyr; which, conſidering how you treated him, you might reaſonably expect; but ſtating your Cafe as it really is, refers you to your ſelves, to reflect upon the profound Policy of your Ways.</p>
            <p>Her Majeſty taking you for wiſe Men, as well as honeſt Men, committed to your Conduct the guiding of her Affairs: War abroad, Peace at home, Her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Glory, the Nation's Happineſs, were all in your Power: You had what <hi>Solomon</hi> calls a Price put into your Hands, and <hi>Solomon,</hi> not I, ſhall tell you what you ought to be thought, for not making ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it, as God and the Nation expected from you.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0203400400:16"/>
That you were the honeſt Men the Queen expected you to be, let the Anſwers you gave to the Propoſals for relieving the <hi>Camiſars,</hi> the Expedition to <hi>Cadiz,</hi> the Management of the Victualling Office, the Army and Navy, in too many Particulars to be innumerated here, ſpeak for you, if they can; the Forfeiture of your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Word on ſundry Occaſions, the conniv'd Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondencies with the Enemy, and the like, let them anſwer for the Matter: That your conſummate Wiſdom deceiv'd her Majeſty, whoſe Goodneſs had entertain'd better Thoughts of you, than your Merit gave Reaſon for, will too plainly appear in the weak Attempts made to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the farther Diſhoneſty of your Deſigns in puſhing this Nation into all manner of Feuds, Heats, Animoſities, and Strife of Parties, to the no ſmall Confuſion of the Publick Affairs, and hazarding the Publick Peace.</p>
            <p>How you would have extricated her Majeſty and this Nation out of the Labyrinths of Error, and the Impolicies you were driving the Publick Affairs into, we thank her Majeſty's Prudence that ſhe did not think fit to expect, not thinking it ſafe to run the Riſque of calling you Fools at the Price of ſome Miſchiefs too groſs to be born with, and too late to be remedied.</p>
            <p>It is ſufficient, that her Majeſty, finding both the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty and Folly of your Management, and foreſeeing the Precipice on which you had brought the Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, had both the Wiſdom and the Courage to take the Reins out of your Hands before you had quite over-turn'd the Chariot of the State, and before you had hurried both us and your ſelves into Gulfs of irretrievable Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0203400400:17"/>
The humble Advice of the Author of theſe Sheets to you, is, To ſit down and be quiet, thank God on your Knees, Night and Day, that you had a mild, a merciful, and a gentle Miſtreſs, that let you fall ſoftly, and did not tye the Weight of the Law to your Heels, which would have ſunk you to the Bottom of that Gulf, in which falſe Favourites have generally fallen in all Ages of the World.</p>
            <p>Thank God and the Queen, that her Majeſty did not give you Time to ruin your ſelves, but took the Knife out of your Hand, before you did that Miſchief with it that muſt at laſt have fall'n with a double Weight on your own Heads.</p>
            <p>Mad-men and Fools are always taken care of by their Friends, miſchievous Weapons taken from them; and if they are not peaceably diſpos'd, are frequently lock'd up from any Capacity of injuring themſelves or others.</p>
            <p>Her Majeſty could never have anſwer'd it to her own known Prudence and Judgment, to have committed the Power of your own Ruin, and the Nation's Diſturbance, any longer to you: For when once the State-Frenzy ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd, and all the fatal Plague-Tokens of Lunacy and National Diſtraction broke out in your Behaviour, the Queen, as a true Nurſing Mother to you, gave you a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs from publick Employment, that you might have time to ſhave your Underſtandings, diſcipline your Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and putting your politick Capacities under a Courſe of State-Phyſick, might recover your Senſes a little, and, if poſſible, with Time and Reflections, come to your ſelves again.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0203400400:18"/>
How kind has her Majeſty been to you Gentlemen! that when you had abſolutely hang'd your ſelves in the State-Nooſe, had actually tyed the Rope of Cauſes and Conſequences about your Necks, and had you gone on but a few Moments more, muſt have been hamper'd ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retrievably, and been quite ſtrangl'd with the Extenſion of your own Politicks; at once the kind Hand of your Soveraign cut you down before your Breath was quite gone, brought you to Life again, and delivered you from thoſe dangerous Wilderneſſes and Mazes of State-Affairs; the Conduct of which you never underſtood, and has now given you the Happineſs of a calm Receſs, and fair Warning not to meddle any more with Things out of your Sphere.</p>
            <p>Keep the Anniverſary of your Deliverance, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and let it never be forgotten: Remember it with Thankfulneſs to the Queen, to the Glory of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Lenity and Tenderneſs, and think ſometimes how impoſſible it had been but that the Miſchiefs and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractions you were puſhing this Nation upon, muſt have ended in Committing you <hi>the Inſtruments of it</hi> to the Hands of that Juſtice which ſome of you, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected Happineſs of Revolution-Clemency, had the good Fortune to eſcape from once before.</p>
            <p>My third Advice is to the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Poſſibly the Clergy may diſdain to be advis'd, at leaſt by me, as Perſons whoſe Province it is, to give, not receive Admonition: But none ought to refuſe Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but he that has never been miſtaken; <hi>and I hope, Gentlemen, you will not pretend to be the Men.</hi> You have now your Day, <hi>as</hi> Aſhton <hi>ſaid lately, every Body has.</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0203400400:19"/>
The Queen has declared her ſelf of your Side, and that tho' others ſhall have her Protection, you ſhall have her Favour.</p>
            <p>The humble Advice to you, Gentlemen, is,<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>First,</hi> To Deſerve it.</item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Be Contented with it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Deſerve it by being Faithful to her, and to your Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country; for 'tis a moſt certain Truth, no Man can be a faithful Subject to the Queen, who is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in the Intereſt of his Native Country.</p>
            <p>By this I mean, (for I deſire to be underſtood) No Man can be a faithful Subject to the preſent Queen, and deſerve her Favour <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> or deſires to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Peace of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> governs, to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw the Foundation on which ſhe ſtands, that wou'd endeavour to bring in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>piſh Race to Reign over us, and conſequently involve the Nation in Blood and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. 'Tis not enough to ſay they deſign no Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion during the Queen's Life, but to keep out Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regners: There is nothing ſo foreign, to this Nation as Popery. The Church of <hi>England</hi> were the Men which threw it out; and how it can be, that the Church of <hi>England</hi> Men ſhou'd run a Venture of its returning, is paſt my Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, every thing that is done by the Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> is not done by the Church; a lame Shift lately made uſe of by a certain Gentleman, to throw off the Scandal of Paſſive Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0203400400:20"/>
But, with ſubmiſſion to that Gentleman, he might have anſwer'd the Author of the New Teſt of the Church's Loyalty better than ſo, or he had as good have ſaid nothing: For, I think, in Arguing, we may take the Principles of a Church from the Writings of her Doctors, who are the Explainers of them, as well as from her Confeſſion of Faith: Now he owns that the Doctors of the Church have Preached ſuch a Doctrine; if it be a Doctrine not agreeable to the Canon, then they ought to have been reprov'd by the Dioceſan, and puniſh'd by Suſpenſion, or otherwiſe. But however, 'tis ſufficient to the Argument <hi>and therefore the Diſtinction was needleſs,</hi> that whether it is an Article of the Church's Faith or no, 'tis a Doctrine was Preach'd by the Learned Doctors of the Church, univerſally receiv'd by the Members of the Church, defended openly, profeſs'd and acknowledg'd by thoſe Gentlemen that have been, and are ſtill eſteem'd Fathers and Pillars of the Church, and this is ſufficient to the Point.</p>
            <p>Now, in this reſpect, what is done by the Members of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and none elſe, is in the Sence of the Argument done by the Church, tho' it be not a publick Act of Convocation, or an Act of Delegates from the Church.</p>
            <p>In this Sence the Church of <hi>England</hi> Depos'd King <hi>James,</hi> and yet they never made an Act of Convocation for it, but 'twas the Church of <hi>England</hi> part of the Nation did it; and thus I am to be underſtood here, without put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any one to the Trouble of Exerciſing his Logick upon the Point.</p>
            <p>In this Sence too I deſire to be underſtood of the Church of <hi>England</hi> in all I ſhall ſay of them, or to them: I am not Diſcuſſing their Articles of Faith, I like them very well, and wiſh they wou'd ſtick cloſe to them themſelves; nor am I ſingling out their Clergy to Reproach them with their Immoralities, of which, perhaps, there may be
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0203400400:21"/>
cauſe enough, <hi>aye, and in other Clergy too</hi>; but I am direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Diſcourſe to the whole Body of this Nation, who call themſelves of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and 'tis to them I ſay, that whoever goes about to Introduce a Popiſh Succeſſion to the Crown of this Proteſtant Nation, who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever deſigns to reſtore the Abdicated Line of the Late King, cannot deſerve the Favour which her Majeſty has promis'd them, and which, I cannot but ſuppoſe, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd them <hi>with a Sub-Intelligitur</hi> of their Faithfulneſs to her and the Nation.</p>
            <p>The Proteſtant Succeſſion is the Foundation on which her Majeſty and the Nation now ſtands, and without which they cannot ſtand; of which may be ſaid, without Prophaneneſs, as is ſaid of the Goſpel, <hi>other Foundation can no Man lay than that which is laid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As I wou'd adviſe the Church of <hi>England</hi> to deſerve this Favour of their Prince, ſo I adviſe them to be conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it.</p>
            <p>It ſeems a manifeſt Affront to the Queens Declaration, that when ſhe has promis'd them her Favour, and the Diſſenters her Protection, they ſhou'd not be contented with the Firſt, without depriving the other of the Laſt. What ſhall we ſay? that while the Queen declares ſhe will protect her Diſſenting Subjects in their Libery of Worſhip, it ſhall be hindred from the Pulpit, and afterwards from the Collegiate Preſs at <hi>Oxford,</hi> that 'tis the Duty of all True Church of <hi>England</hi> Men to Erect a Flag of Defiance againſt the Diſſenters, or Phanaticks, till they are Rooted from off the Face of the Land: Why, what's the matter Gentlemen? won't you let the Queen keep her Word with them? ſhe has promis'd upon her Royal Word to preſerve the Toleration, and you declare ſhe ſhall not. This is very ſcoundrel uſage of her Majeſty, and a ſorry return for the Favour ſhe has promis'd you. I queſtion not but you will come in with the Shift juſt now mentioned, That
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0203400400:22"/>
this is not an Act of the Church of <hi>England</hi>; but, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as you ought to be aſham'd of it, let us ſee you cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect it, or elſe we ſuppoſe your tacit acknowledgment is an Aſſent.</p>
            <p>Here are in <hi>England,</hi> by a modeſt Eſtimation, above two Millions of Diſſenters; I would fain ask the hotteſt headed Church of <hi>England</hi> Man in Town, what he wou'd have done with them?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hang'd,</hi> all <hi>Hang'd, ſays Furioſo,</hi> Ay, Sir, if you cou'd fight as well as talk, it may be you might do it; <hi>But they won't be Hang'd,</hi> and how will you make them? 'twas try'd once, and nothing was got by it but blows, and that Two for One.</p>
            <p>Suppoſe you wou'd Baniſh them, and <hi>ſuppoſe they wou'd go,</hi> 'twou'd Ruine you all to part with them. See what a Condition <hi>Spain</hi> brought it ſelf to, by ſending 170000 Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of Mareſcoes away.</p>
            <p>They are not only Numerous but Wealthy, your Trade wou'd remove with them, they'd carry with them ſo much of your Caſh and Wealth you'd be in a worſe Caſe than the Iſraelites left the Egyptian Ladies in, without their Jewels.</p>
            <p>I cannot ſee the Policy of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Men in ſuppreſſing the Diſſenters; 'tis certainly more for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions good to Unite all Parties; there can be but one thing in it; Convert them they can't; I never read of any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion brought about by Perſecution but in <hi>France,</hi> and what are the New Converts turn'd to? only to ſubmit for Fear.</p>
            <p>Now without pretending to Propheſy, I may ſay, the Diſſenters in <hi>England</hi> are not to be brought to that, the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thing that remains, is, they wou'd have the reſtraint of the Law taken off, that they may be let looſe upon them to harraſs and plunder them, this is what is aim'd at.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0203400400:23"/>
Well Gentlemen, when you have this Liberty you dare not put it in Practice further than the Law will give you leave; if you do, the Law gives them leave to reſiſt you, and in either, there is half your own Party will be againſt you; Nay, thoſe who are properly the Church of <hi>England</hi> will be againſt it, all the Men of Honour, Conſcience Charity and Mercy will be againſt harraſſing and dragging their Neighbours about for Points of Conſcience: Nay, the very Mob of your own Party will ſtone your Informers; and who are you that are left, if the other ſhould ſtand Neuter? are you able to Force the Queen to break her Word? are you able to fright her into it? and if you cou'd, when you have driven all the Nation into Confuſion, can you defend your ſelves againſt the Laws and the Party.</p>
            <p>To what purpoſe then is all this Huffing, is it only that you want to be Plundring your Neighbours? Why, if you are ſo for Plunder, take Arms a God's Name, and go and Plunder the French.—But I ask Pardon, I forgot your Principles, <hi>you are for Plunder without Fighting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The farther Confirmation of this Advice, is drawn from the plain Conviction, which the powerful Arguments of Peace, Temper and Moderation have forc'd on the Minds of Men.</p>
            <p>You now ſee Gentlemen, the Queen, the Head of your own Church, the Biſhops, a numerous Part of your own Body, the Men of the Gown, they are all convinc'd.</p>
            <p>'Tis impoſſible for Wiſe Men to reſiſt Demonſtration, the conſequence of things has brought, I had almoſt ſaid, all the Wiſe Men of the Church, and I would to God it were true, to ſee the abſolute neceſſity of Peace, to ſee that a Union of Parties is the only ſtep to this Nations Settlement, that a Receſs from Party Rage, and healing the Wounds of the State, is the only Method to prevent the Nation falling into Convulſions, Feavers, Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and Death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0203400400:24"/>
And why, Gentlemen, will you ſtand out? it were to be wiſh'd you would a little conſider how is it poſſible you can Erect your own Judgments againſt a whole Nation, the Queen, the Nobility, Thouſands of your beſt Pariſhioners, born, bred in, and ever true to the Church, are convinc'd, and will you not be mov'd to Examine the Caſe.</p>
            <p>What Proſpect of Injury or Miſchief can you ſee in Peace? what damage can accrue to the Church or State, to put but a Negative upon your Zeal, and not ſuffer it to outrun the Law, or Fight with your knowledge.</p>
            <p>As you Love the Church, your Prince, and your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, liſten to Peace, liſten to the Voice of the Nation, and of the Queen, and the Voice of Reaſon, and the Nature of the things, all concur to call upon you to Unite with your Brethren, and no more let ſmall things divide us, no more let our Enemies beat us with our own Hands, and deſtroy us by our own Aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>If you will not give Ear to this Cordial Advice, give the Author leave to determine two Things, which without any Pretence to the Spirit of Propheſy, he thinks he may preſume to aſſure you of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This Nation, whoſe Eyes are now open to their own Safety and Deliverance, will do the Work without you, the People of <hi>England,</hi> aided by the Laws, encouraged by the Nobility, the principal Gentry, a great Body of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, and back'd by the Queen, joining in this mighty Work, this glorious Attempt to eſtabliſh a Party Peace, will do the Work without you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You will fix this Eternal Brand of Infamy on the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Clergy, that they were the principal Oppoſers of the Nation's Peace; that in Contempt of the Bleſſed healing and heavenly Spirit of Peace, in ſpight of the Royal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and Invitations of their Sovereign, in Defiance of the noble Example of their Brethren, they, even they only, are at this Day the wideners of our Breaches, the
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0203400400:25"/>
encouragers of Diviſions, and the daily prompters of the Ignorant People to abhor their Brethren, to hate their Neighbours, and to keep up the unnatural Diviſions of this Nation.</p>
            <p>A bleſſed <hi>Memorandum</hi> this will be to the Honour and Glory of our Inferiour Clergy, to remain to Poſterity, when our Children ſhall ſay, We had been a happy Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if the Clergy of the Church had not hindred the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Peace in 1705, when the Queen, the Nobility, the Gentry, nay, and the very Biſhops offer'd to join in a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Union, when they all invited them to it, when all Circumſtances concurr'd to make it eaſie, and when the want of it let in Slavery and Bondage upon our Fathers, and entailed it upon us their Poſterity.</p>
            <p>To the moderate Gentlemen of the Church, the Author of this ſees but little Occaſion to ſpeak; the whole need not the Phyſician; he that is in the right Way needs no Guide. Peace has brought ſome Scandal upon you, but 'tis from ſuch Mouths whoſe Breath is all Scandal, and whoſe Throat is an open Sepulchre.</p>
            <p>Purſue, Gentlemen, with the ſame Courage and Candor, the ſame happy Reſolutions, and ſucceſsful Meaſures you have begun; how eaſie is the Work of Peace in <hi>England,</hi> when by wiſe Hands, back'd with the Encouragement of Power it is once ſet on foot.</p>
            <p>Go on, Gentlemen, with Succeſs; Peace is always the firſt Act of wiſe Counſels: What Confuſions have our State Mountebanks run us into? Our <hi>N<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">

                  </gap>rs,</hi> and the Rabble of <hi>Jehu</hi>'s Polititians? whither were they hurrying this Nation by Civil Confuſions, while, at the ſame time, we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volv'd in a cruel, a formidable, and threatning War abroad?</p>
            <p>You have reſcued the Nation; God Almighty, by infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Principles of Peace, Moderation, Union, and Temper into the Heads and Hearts of the Queen and you, has ſav'd
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0203400400:26"/>
us from the Ruin contriv'd for us by the Devil, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warily propagated <hi>to treat them with Charity,</hi> by our own impolitick and thoughtleſs Managers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Diſſenters</hi> are another Branch of thoſe who this Author, with Submiſſion to their Politicks, thinks may ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of ſome Advice, tho' perhaps they may be of another Opinion.</p>
            <p>However, whether they will hear or forbear, he takes the Freedom to ſpeak to them, tho' in general, only refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring a further Explication of his Meaning to another Place.</p>
            <p>You have always, and above all Parties, pretended to Peace: Now ſhew the reality of your Deſign.</p>
            <p>You are divided in ſome Steps which <hi>you think needful</hi> from the Church; let the Spirit of Charity remain, and divide no farther than you really know to be needful.</p>
            <p>In Matters of Religion, enjoying your Liberty, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with it, and ſtudy to let there be no more Difference between you and the Church, than there really is.</p>
            <p>We are all Chriſtians, all Proteſtants, all Engliſhmen, let us be all Brethren, and act like ſuch on all Occaſions.</p>
            <p>The Church of <hi>England</hi> and the Diſſenters have but one Intereſt, one Foundation, and but one End: The mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Church Men, and the charitable Diſſenter, are the ſame Denomination of Chriſtians, and all the Difference which now lookt at near the Eye ſhows large, if view'd at the Diſtance of Heaven ſhows not it ſelf; neither will Catholick Chriſtianity, in that Realm of Light, appear in any Party-colour'd Garment.</p>
            <p>In Civil Affair, 'tis your Intereſt, your Safety, and your Glory, that the Government ſhould be in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and even this is a Security to the Diſſenters againſt all that Clamour rais'd at them, of their pulling down the Church. The Diſſenters cannot wiſh the Downfall of the Church of <hi>England</hi> Government, without proving them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0203400400:27"/>
Lunatick, and all the Sence of their own Intereſt muſt forſake them.</p>
            <p>In all Occaſions therefore, with all poſſible chearfulneſs, join with the Men of Peace of the Church; carefully chooſe them to repreſent you; boldly reſcue them from the Scandals and Calumnies of their own clamouring high Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and heartily aſſiſt them upon all Occaſions in their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and juſt Endeavours for the Nation's Security.</p>
            <p>What if every body you ſuſpect or diſlike is not turn'd out, or every body you like put in? What if Her Majeſty is willing to try ſome Men longer than others, and give Knaves an Opportunity to turn honeſt? what if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution of <hi>England,</hi> from mad Men and Fools in the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, to honeſt and wiſe Men, be acted like the Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration we recommend, with Temper, ſedately, gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, and with due Conſideration to Circumſtances: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once fully ſatisfy'd with the ſincere Reſolution of the Queen and Miniſtry, to purſue the Nations Peace, acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſce in Her Majeſties Methods; Her Deſigns being ſo juſt, fear not but the Methods will be as judicious. Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Redemption was all compleat, tho' he did not An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the haſty Expectation of the Diſciples, who thought he muſt needs <hi>juſt then</hi> reſtore the Kingdom of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen has ſufficiently declar'd Her glorious Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution for Peace; pray let us leave Her Majeſty to Her own Methods: It is not Two Year ago ſince we ſhould have thought our ſelves happy with what we now ſee; let us look on our preſent Liberty and Peace with Satisfaction, and wait with Joy and Pleaſure for the Remainder, which in its Time and Seaſon we have great Reaſon to hope will be perfected, to the Settlement of that laſting Calm in theſe Nations, which Good Men have ſo long pray'd for.</p>
