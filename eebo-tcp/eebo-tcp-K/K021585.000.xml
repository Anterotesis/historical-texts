            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE evident Approach of a War
having been ſpoken to, with ſome
Approbation; the evident Advantages of
it to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> ſeem as natural to be
ſpoken to, as they are neceſſary.</p>
            <p>The ſame Hand therefore applies it ſelf
to this Part however officiouſly, yet with
the ſame Sincerity, to encourage the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
in the proſecuting of the War, when
it ſhall be begun.</p>
            <p>If the many Diſappointments which the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> have met with in forming
their Deſigns, and the dull Proſpects they
have before them in carrying them on, have
not prevail'd on them to take better Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures,
or to act a wiſer Part; but that
they will go on, in ſpight, not of Reaſon on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
but even of Nature; that very Obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
is an Encouragement to us, who have
ſo many Aſſurances of Succeſs in every
Branch of the War.</p>
            <p>But when the Advantages to our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
come to be weighed alſo, and added
<pb facs="tcp:1185000400:4"/>
to the Advantages of the War, one would
be apt to ſay that as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeem
infatuated in the Beginning it; we ſhould
all be infatuated, if we did not take hold
of the Occaſion.</p>
            <p>The Author deſires to capitulate for ſo
much Favour, (however otherwiſe diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged,)
that as this Tract is written with
the ſame ſincere Affection to the publick
Intereſt, as well of the Government as of the
whole Nation, as the former, it may be accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the ſame manner; he earneſtly wiſhes
that the Advantages to our Commerce, which
ſo evidently offer on the Occaſion of this
War, may be embrac'd; that our Trade,
which at this Time ſuffers under many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Difficulties, may at leaſt revive upon
the Follies of our Enemies, and by thoſe
very Steps by which they think to ruin it.</p>
            <p>He is alſo ready at any time to diſcloſe
ſome remaining Advantages of this War, as
they relate to Commerce, which ſeem yet
not to be noticed by our Superiors, and to
recommend them to Practice, and that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Proſpect of Intereſt, or Hopes of
Reward.</p>

<hi>Advantages</hi> to GREAT BRITAIN, and its
ALLIES, from the <hi>Approaching</hi> WAR.</head>
         <div n="1" type="chapter">
            <head>CHAP. I.</head>
            <head type="sub">That the firſt Scheme of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Deſigns might be ſaid
to have ſome Weight in them. That the Diſappointments
they have met with ought to have made them deſpair, and
give over; but that their obſtinate purſuing thoſe broken
Meaſures, notwithſtanding their Diſappointments, makes
them appear Ridiculous and Abſurd.</head>
            <p>WHAT has hitherto been ſpoken of the Certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
and Neceſſity of a War, and of its Evident
Approach, has been founded upon the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
made by the Enemy themſelves, or by
the general Knowledge of Things; as the Publick Affairs of
<hi>Europe</hi> had an evident Tendency in their Conſequences to a
Rupture. <hi>What can't be otherwiſe, muſt be ſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is no great Conceſſion in this Argument, for an Author
to ſay he is no Privy-Counſellor, no Secret-Service Man;
that he ſees only <hi>without Doors,</hi> and judges only from <hi>what
is,</hi> to <hi>what may be.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and even the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi>
(who in this Diſcourſe, and for this Occaſion in particular,
we call the Enemy) have taken care to act, not as if they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd
the Thing ſhould be a Secret, or that they would amuſe
the World about it, and that we ſhould be at an Uncertainty
in the Queſtion, whether they deſign'd to make a War of it,
or no; they ſeem rather to be removing all poſſible Doubts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
it from our Thoughts, and making it appear, not that
they really intended it, but that it can be no otherwiſe; that
the <hi>Rubicon</hi> was paſt, the Thing determined, and that it could
not be avoided.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1185000400:6"/>
This made the former Diſcourſe upon this Subject bear
the Title of Evident, <hi>The Evident Approach,</hi> &amp;c. intimating, that
the War was Evident and Viſible in its Approach, and that
they muſt have ſome Defect in their Underſtanding, who made
any longer Doubt of it; that the Parties were as they ſay of Armies,
in full March to Engage. Indeed, it ſeems to coſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
ſome Pains to obtain a Belief among Mankind, that they were
in Earneſt; for ſuch Difficulties offered themſelves in the
Thing it ſelf, to the meaneſt and moſt common Obſervation,
that it was not eaſy to bring People to believe the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
Weak enough to be in Earneſt, or that they were really
entering upon a War (and eſpecially making themſelves Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors)
in which they were as certain to be Loſers, as
as they were to be Parties; as certain to be beaten, as to
fight, and in which indeed it could (by the Nature of Things)
be no otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>For this Reaſon, I muſt confeſs it ſeemed a neceſſary Piece
of Work, to perſwade the People to believe the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
a War, and that therefore That was firſt to be laid
down as a Principle, and rendered as Undeniable as all Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
in Matters of Diſpute ought to be; and how could this
be done better, than by the concurring Teſtimony of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy
themſelves, either declared in plain Words at length,
or gathered as the Natural Conſequences of all their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions?</p>
            <p>When
I ſay, the Meaning of an Enemy appears from the
natural Conſequences of their Actions, I muſt be allowed to
argue thus: When I ſee plainly, that a Man reſolves to put
ſuch Hardſhips, ſuch Pieces of Injuſtice, and ſuch Affronts upon
me, as he has good Reaſon to know I will not and ought not to
bear, without the moſt Scandalous Reproach to my Character,
the utmoſt Damage and Loſs to my Intereſt, and the utmoſt
Danger and Hazard to my Life; and that therefore he knows
at the ſame Time, ſuch Uſage of me will force me to reſiſt
him, and repel Force with Force; when I ſee him, I ſay, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in ſuch a Manner, I may (without Injury to him) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude,
That in ſhort he deſigns to Quarrel with me; it is the
natural Conſequence of the Thing; the Language of his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour
ſpeaks it as plain, as if he ſent me a Challenge, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd
me in Words at length.</p>
            <p>Thus in Caſe of the Conduct of the ſeveral Powers we are
now ſpeaking of: When we ſee them Leaguing and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating
together, forming a Strength of Intereſts, entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
Secret Engagements, and thoſe Secret Engagements pointed
directly and particularly at the Intereſt of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> at
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1185000400:7"/>
the Perſon, Honour, and Royal Dignity of his Majeſty, as
King of <hi>Great Britain</hi>:</p>
            <p>It we ſee them concerting Meaſures for the ſomenting Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
Feuds, and Factions among the People, and raiſing
Rebellion and Civil War in the Heart of his Majeſty's Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions:</p>
            <p>If
we ſee them breaking all Faith and Honour, Pledg'd and
Engaged in the moſt ſolemn Manner, by eſpouſing that deſpicable
Intereſt which they had Renounced, and Promiſed effectually
to Abandon and Reject; I mean that of the Pretender, whom
they had mutually engag'd not to Aſſiſt or Support in any
manner whatſoever; and that thoſe Engagements were enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
into in ſuch Terms<note n="a" place="bottom">The Terms of the mutual Engagement between the two Courts of <hi>Vienna</hi> and <hi>Madrid,</hi> are ſaid to be expreſly thus: <hi>To Undertake to place the Pretender upon the Throne of</hi> Great Britain.</note> as could not be broken without a
Violation of Honour, in ſuch a Manner, as few Perſons of
ſuch Dignity, in the World, could ever ſatisfie themſelves to
be guilty of:</p>
            <p>If we ſee them, tho' Crowned Heads, tho' Princes, and
Chriſtian Princes, ſtooping ſo far below the Dignity of Crowned
Heads, as to encourage Treaſon and Rebellion, ſupporting
Subjects in Traiterous Deſigns againſt their Sovereign; which
Sovereign, both theſe Crowned Heads had Own'd and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd
in the Quality of Lawful and Rightful; and had So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly,
and in a particular Manner Engaged, not to diſturb
in the Poſſeſſion of his ſaid Lawful and Rightful Government,
as above:<note n="b" place="bottom">The Sixth Article of the Treaty of <hi>Utrecht,</hi> runs thus: <q rend="inline">'The Catholick King doth Promiſe, as well in his own Name, as in that of his Heirs and Succeſſors. That they will not at any Time diſturb or moleſt the QUEEN, her Heirs and Succeſſors of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Line, being in Poſſeſſion of the Crown of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions Subject thereunto: Neither will the ſaid Catholick King, or any of his Succeſſors, give at any Time any <hi>Aid, Succour, Favour</hi> or <hi>Counſel,</hi> directly, or indirectly, to any Perſon or Perſons, who on any Cauſe or Pretence, ſhall hereafter endeavour to Oppoſe the ſaid Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by Open War, or by any Conſpiracies, againſt ſuch Prince and Princes poſſeſſing the ſaid Throne of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> as aforeſaid.'</q>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>If we ſee them Leaguing and Confederating, for the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Intereſts deſtructive to the Commerce of theſe Kingdoms;
laying open ſuch Branches of Trade as by former Leagues and
Conventions were expreſly Limited and Reſtrain'd; Invading
the Commerce, which it was expreſly Stipulated ſhould not
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1185000400:8"/>
be invaded, and breaking in upon the Property of a Nation,
as well as of particular Perſons in the ſaid Commerce:</p>
            <p>If, I ſay, theſe things are evident, and that we know they
are ſuch as the Nation of <hi>Great Britain</hi> will not ſit down
ſatisfied with, or, as we may juſtly ſay, cannot but reſent, and
that with the utmoſt Indignation; and that the ſaid Enemy
muſt know they would be ſo reſented; we muſt conclude
them likewiſe in earneſt to quarrel with the People of <hi>Great
Britain,</hi> and to begin a War.</p>
            <p>It has not therefore been inſignificant, in Order to convince
the People of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> of the ſtated and ſettled Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the ſaid <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> to inſult and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front
his Majeſty, and to bring about a War in <hi>Europe,</hi> for
the carrying thoſe Deſigns and Reſolutions on; I ſay, it has
not been inſignificant to thoſe Ends, that Methods have been
taken to expoſe the private, and, as I may call them, Clande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine
Methods of the ſaid Confederating Powers, for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging
Treaſon and Rebellion among the King's Subjects,
for animating diſaffected Parties, and for forming unjuſtifiable
Schemes of Trade, ſuch as muſt neceſſarily end in War and
Confuſion.</p>
            <p>To prove that the Enemy reſolve to bring the Allies to a
Neceſſity of making War in their own Defence, is to prove
that a War will neceſſarily be the Conſequence; and in ſuch
Caſe, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> reſolve to prompt that Neceſſity, 'tis the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> make the War, not the Confederates.</p>
            <p>To put things upon us which it is not reaſonable we ſhou'd
bear, which no Nation in their Senſes can bear, and which
they may depend upon his Majeſty will not bear, or his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies
either, is indeed to begin the War, or at leaſt to declare
the War to be inevitable.</p>
            <p>It was not therefore ſo remote from the Queſtion in hand
to ſay we ſhou'd go to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and to the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror,
and ask them whether we ſhall have <hi>War</hi> or <hi>Peace</hi>; it is
for them to anſwer that Queſtion; and their Actions have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
determin'd it already, they have made the War a thing
not only Certain, but, as I ſay, Inevitable; nay they have begun
the War by a ſecret clandeſtine Conduct, full of Machinery,
full of Secret, and yet Evident Acts of Hoſtility; and by
carrying on ſuch Mines and ſubterranean Attacks againſt the
<hi>Hanover</hi> Allies, as they might eaſily know and be ſure thoſe
Allies would not bear, and ſuch as indeed they ought not to
expect wou'd be born with.</p>
            <p>In a Word, all the Conduct of the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies has been
Pacific, Healing, and viſibly endeavouring to heal and make
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1185000400:9"/>
up the Breaches which have appear'd, and to preſerve a good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding
between the Powers of <hi>Europe</hi>; on the other hand, all
the Conduct of the Enemy has been menacing, provoking, and
inſulting; Clouds big with Thunder, tho' empty of Force;
<hi>Brutum fulmen</hi>; Noiſe without a Bolt; Threats without a
Hand to execute; pointing, but not pointed. In a Word,
They have breathed War on every Occaſion, that if poſſible
they might make it neceſſary to the Allies to begin it.</p>
            <p>It ſeems they have 'till this time been able to do little more
than Urge and Provoke, uſing all the Methods poſſible to
ſhow their ill Will, except that of Force; which tho' they
have been unable to make much uſe of, they have ſhown evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently,
that they intend all that is or ſhall be in their Power, to
injure and offend the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies, and his <hi>Britannick</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty
in particular, that ſo a War may follow of Courſe.</p>
            <p>Not but that this Conſequence may happen much ſooner
than they will find for their Advantage, and before they may
be thoroughly ready for it; yet it might be very needful to ask up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
what particular Foundation they, who are in reality ſo ill able
to carry it on, ſeem ſo very haſty for bringing it to paſs? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
they have not met with ſome Diſappointments ſince they
begun thus to ſhow themſelves, and whether thoſe Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
ever made any viſible Alterations in their Schemes, or
no?</p>
            <p>That they have met with ſome Diſappointments, is evident,
and that in ſeveral Articles. Nothing is more certain than that
they had a View of ſeveral things, which in their Embrio appear'd
probable and encouraging, which they have ſince found Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
to conclude will not anſwer their End, and the Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency
of which renders their Deſigns far leſs promiſing and
hopeful than at firſt. For Example:<list>
                  <item>1. <hi>'Tis evident,</hi> they had Hopes of obtaining ſome tolerable
Conditions for the Preſerving the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, that is to
ſay, for upholding the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Company erected at <hi>Oſtend</hi>;
by which Commerce, the Imperial Court depended upon it, a
large Revenue would accrue to the Publick, as does by the like
Company to the Governments in <hi>England, Holland</hi> and <hi>France.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>'Tis Evident,</hi> they hoped for a mutual Aſſiſtance and
Communication between the united Powers of <hi>Vienna</hi> and
<hi>Madrid,</hi> the one aſſiſting the other with Money, and the other
reciprocally ſupplying Powerful Bodies of Troops to carry on
an offenſive War. The Imperial Court, I doubt not, depended
upon vaſt Supplies of Money in Specie; at leaſt all the ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
Sums, which were very great; by which Money the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial
Armies, great and numerous already, wou'd be ſtill made
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1185000400:10"/>
greater and more powerful, and the War be carry'd on into the
Dominions of the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies to great Advantage.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>'Tis Evident,</hi> they hoped to bring off <hi>France</hi> from its At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment
to the Intereſt of the Allies of <hi>Hanover,</hi> and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
from its warm Adherence to all ſuch farther Meaſures
as might embarraſs the ſaid Courts of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Vienna</hi> in a
War with <hi>France</hi>; believing perhaps, that at the worſt, <hi>France</hi>
would not have come into an offenſive Alliance againſt <hi>Spain,</hi>
and have turn'd its Arms againſt a Branch of the Houſe of <hi>Bour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben</hi>;
in which alſo we doubt not they are happily diſappointed.</item>
                  <item>4. It is evident, <hi>Spain</hi> is particularly under a moſt mortify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Diſappointment, in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Squadron blocking up their
Plate-Fleet at <hi>Porto-Belo,</hi> and ſtopping the Returns of thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
Sums of Money which ſhould have been brought to
<hi>Europe</hi> by the Galeons and the <hi>Flota</hi>; which had they come ſafe,
had (as they tell us) brought them at one time forty Millions
of Pieces of Eight in Specie, which, with the Merchandizes load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
on board thoſe Ships at the ſame time, amounted to above
Ten Millions Sterling; which immenſe Sum, tho' much
the greater Part of it was the Property of their own Subjects,
and of the Subjects of the Allies, as Merchants; yet perhaps
the King of <hi>Spain</hi> might have thought fit, at ſuch a Jun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture
as that of a War, to have borrowed ſome of, or
otherwiſe to have appropriated it to the publick Uſes, for the
maintaining the Engagements mentioned above; perhaps how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
making Satisfaction to the Proprietors by ſome other way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>I may name ſeveral other Heads of Diſappointment in the
firſt Views which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had of theſe things, in their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
and which had they foreſeen, they would perhaps have
acted ſomething more warily than they have done, and ſo
have given leſs Umbrage to the Allies, or at leaſt ſtopp'd
their Hands, 'till they had gotten the Money, upon which all
the Reſt ſo much depended, into their Hands.</p>
            <p>But I muſt note as I go, that here they have been overſhot in
their own Bow: Here the Allies have been too old for them:
And now it ſeems they are going on without their Crutches,
walking without their Legs, and in a word, making the War
without the Money. I return to the Diſappointments.</p>
            <p>It is evident, beſides all this, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> met with a
very great Diſappointment in the <hi>Baltick,</hi> where we are pretty
well aſſured they promiſed themſelves great Aſſiſtance; and
from whence we are told they expected a Supply of Naval
Strength; which Supply they found as effectually lock'd up
in the Port of <hi>Revel,</hi> as they did the Money (that was to pay
for it) in the Haven of <hi>Porto-Belo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1185000400:11"/>
The <hi>Muſcovites</hi> could no more part with their Ships, or
cauſe a Squadron of Men of War to ſail without Money,
than the <hi>Imperialiſts</hi> could cauſe their Armies to march with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the ſame Supply; and if they (the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) expected it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe,
if they expected fifteen Sail of <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Men of
War would come to their Aſſiſtance without Money, they
were much miſtaken, and acted more like F<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>s than the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> generally uſed to do.</p>
            <p>Nor is it leſs wonderful to me, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who
uſed to act in former Days with ſuch conſummate Wiſdom,
and by ſuch impenetrable Councils, that it was ſaid of <hi>Don
Lewis de Haro,</hi> he obey'd the Scripture in his Politicks, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
he did in his Alms, and that he did not <hi>let his right Hand
know</hi> what <hi>his left Hand did</hi>; that theſe very wary circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
<hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould let ſo much of their ſecret Service
come to light, and act in ſuch an unwary and impolitick
Manner, as to have their Meaſures be talk'd publickly of, in
the ordinary Converſation at <hi>Petersburgh,</hi> as I have been
inform'd has been the Caſe.</p>
            <p>Nothing can excuſe the Folly of it, in my Opinion, unleſs
I ſhall with ſome People ſuggeſt, that the Improbability of
their Schemes and Chimeras being Succeſsful, ſhould argue
they were not at all in earneſt about them: But this has ſo
much of the <hi>Jacobite</hi> in it, and ſo little of the Politician, that I
think 'tis ſcarce worth repeating; 'tis much more certain, that the
locking up the <hi>Muſcovite</hi> Fleet was an inexpreſſible Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
to the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; and that it could not have been,
if their Expectations of Help from that <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Fleet had not
been very great.</p>
            <p>It is true, under all theſe Diſappointments, and more which I
ſhall ſpeak of preſently, it might have been expected the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
and the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi> notwithſtanding their Confederacy, ſhould
have laid aſide the Deſign it ſelf, and ſhould have carried on
the Project no farther; and indeed, this gave Occaſion to my
calling the Deſign in general abſurd and ridiculous, ſuppoſing
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could not be ſo weak as to go on with it, and that
if they were in Earneſt before, they could not be ſo now.</p>
            <p>But ſince it is ſo, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> or the <hi>Imperialiſts,</hi>
think themſelves ſtill able to carry on their Deſigns, and that
they are not ſufficiently diſcourag'd by their Diſappointments,
let us then turn the Tables as they do, and talk ſeriouſly of
it as a thing really intended. And here, as I ſaid before, tho' the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> are not ſo Conſiderable as to fright us, I hope we
may allow that they are not ſo Inconſiderable as not to awaken
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1185000400:12"/>
us. They are certainly ſtrong enough to juſtifie our Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations,
tho' not ſo ſtrong as to fill us with Apprehenſions.</p>
            <p>Hence all the Precautions which have been made uſe of by
our Government, and by his Majeſty's particular Direction,
have been not juſtified only, but are to be eſteem'd as Effects
of the moſt wiſe and ſucceſsful Councils imaginable; a Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
that has had ſomething more than common in it, and
which has been the Foundation of all thoſe (happy) Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
to the Enemy: <hi>Happy Diſappointments</hi> I ſay to us, Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
enough to them, and which at this time may be ſaid to
compleat the Hiſtory of the Conduct and Succeſs of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enna
Alliance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Precautions and Proviſions, at the ſame time that they
have diſappointed the Executions of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Deſign, have
alſo made the carrying it on farther, abſurd and fooliſh; have
really turn'd the Tables upon the Enemy, and made their too-well-concerted
Schemes become ridiculous; the Meaſures
which, as firſt propoſed among themſelves, appear'd rational
and probable, agreeable to a wiſe and prudent Nation, and
to the Counſel of able Stateſmen and Miniſters, are by
theſe Means become ſcandalouſly vain and imprudent; and
we may bleſs the Precaution, I ſay, at the ſame time that we
make a Jeſt of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Obſtinacy, in carrying on theſe
Deſigns, after they were ſo render'd ridiculous.</p>
            <p>To juſtifie this Argument, let us return to the firſt Scheme;
let us examine the firſt Proſpects upon which they were form'd,
the Foundation upon which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Houſe of
<hi>Auſtria</hi> united, and upon which the Treaty of <hi>Vienna</hi> was
made; and in doing this, we ſhall not perhaps find the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
ſuch weak People as they ſeem to be now: We ſhall
find, that 'tis rather their obſtinate perſiſting in their Purſuit of
a blaſted Undertaking that renders them ridiculous, than any
Abſurdity or incongruous Acting in the firſt Scheme, or in
the Foundation thoſe Schemes were built upon.</p>
            <p>Had the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (cloſe in their Councils, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
in their Conduct) kept their Affairs within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs
of their own Cabinet, as they formerly uſed to do, and
ſecured the Secret in their own Breaſts; Had they been ſo far
the Maſters of their own Schemes, as to have ſecur'd the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports
and Supplies they wanted, ſo that they could neither
have been kept from a Squadron by blocking up <hi>Revel,</hi> or
from the Galeons by blocking up <hi>Porto-Belo</hi>;</p>
            <p>Had they firſt receiv'd the Support of fifteen Men of War,
which is ſaid to be the Number they expected from the <hi>Cza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rina,</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1185000400:13"/>
and the Supply of forty Millions of Pieces of Eight
from <hi>Porto-Belo</hi>; had they brought in the King of <hi>Sardinia,</hi>
and the King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> and the King of <hi>Poland,</hi> and the
King of <gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                  <desc> _____ </desc>
               </gap> and ſeveral other Princes and Powers into
the <hi>Vienna</hi> Treaty, as I make no doubt they at firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
and as they indeed at firſt reported;</p>
            <p>Had they brought his moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, and the <hi>States-General</hi>
to a Neutrality, as they ſay they have obtain'd of the
King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> and as I doubt
not they earneſtly endeavour'd with the two firſt:</p>
            <p>In a word, had all theſe Points been gain'd, and had they
met with none of the other Diſappointments already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd,
I moſt readily grant they had form'd a Body of Power
truly terrible and formidable to the Proteſtant Intereſt; and
we had had more Reaſon (much more Reaſon) to be alarm'd,
and indeed frighted with the Apprehenſions of what might
have been the Conſequence of theſe things, than I hope we
have had yet, or are like to have now.</p>
            <p>Not but even with all thoſe I ſhould ſtill ſay, and hope it
would appear, that the Naval Strength of <hi>Great Britain</hi>
might, under Providence, have been our Protection againſt
them all.</p>
            <p>But they have been diſappointed in almoſt every Part. Even
the <hi>Venetians</hi> themſelves, tho' a State under infinite Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to the Houſe of <hi>Auſtria,</hi> and to the Crown of <hi>Spain,</hi>
ever ſince the Battel of <hi>Lepanto,</hi> yet ſo ill have they ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd,
that we do not find they have been able to bring that
wiſe People to eſpouſe their Cauſe, or ſo much as to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe
a Neutrality, or to act as Auxiliars, by Land or by
Sea.</p>
            <p>This Conſideration however may ſerve to give us the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Reflection mention'd above; (<hi>viz.</hi>) How Juſt have been the
Cautions, and how Prudent have been the Meaſures taken on
this Side, (be it by who you will) to dive into theſe Secrets,
to detect theſe Contrivances! and, which is ſtill more, how
Succeſsful, happily Succeſsful the Diſcovery! How many
Ways has it been advantageous, and particularly how uſeful,
in having given time for the Preparations of the <hi>Hanover</hi>
Allies; nay, for the forming the Treaty it ſelf; and in having
opened the Eyes of other Powers, and bringing Them into
it, who ſeem'd doubtful whether they ſhould accede or no!</p>
            <p>Again; Of what Uſe has the preventing thoſe things been
to us! that from ſuch a formidable Appearance, from ſuch a
deep-laid Deſign, that was capable of being made thus ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible,
they ſhould be brought to ſo deſpicable, and truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contemptible
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1185000400:14"/>
a Figure, that 'tis hardly reaſonable to talk of
them at the ſame Time, or hardly think of them in the ſame
Claſs, or under the ſame Rank.</p>
            <p>Had not his Majeſty's penetrating Councils evidently
reach'd to the Bottom of all their Deſigns, gotten the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of their Schemes, and div'd into the Depth of all their
moſt conſiderable Projects, None of all theſe preventive Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
had been taken, none of theſe preventive Medicines had
been made uſe of; the ſeveral miſchievous Things which they
had concluded on, had not been calmly countermin'd and
unhing'd, or the Contrivers of them been ſo effectually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
and diſappointed, as now they are.</p>
            <p>I am far therefore from ſaying, or ſuggeſting, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
and Schemes of thoſe Powers had not been capable of
great Attempts; that the Naval Power of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Muſcovy</hi>
join'd, might not have been ſufficient to have brought the Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
upon the Stage in ſome Part or other, or at leaſt to have given
him ſome Expectations, and have put him, and his eaſily deluded
Party, in hopes of great things to be done for him that Way:
Or that the numerous Armies of the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and the King
of <hi>Spain,</hi> united, with ſuch Allies too as are mentioned, might
not have been able to have given us great Uneaſineſs, and to
have even endanger'd the Safety of all the Proteſtant Intereſts of
<hi>Europe,</hi> as well as of theſe united Kingdoms of <hi>Great Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As then I grant the Danger to have been <hi>thus Great,</hi> had they
gone on uninterrupted; I muſt allow alſo, that the Diſcovery
having been thus happy, it behoves us to keep the Hold that
is gain'd, to preſerve the Advantages of the Diſcovery, to
keep the ſeparated Powers in the ſame ſtate of Separation; to
keep up the engag'd Powers to their Engagements, and by all
lawful means to preſerve the Conſederacy of the ſeveral Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
that are thus confederated; to cultivate the Union that
they are now brought to, and if poſſible to encreaſe it; This I
think is the only way to preſerve our Religion and Liberties,
our Superiority of Power, and alſo our Commerce, in the
Condition it ſtands in at this Time.</p>
            <p>Heav'ns be prais'd! the Snare is laid open; the Enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
is broken; the Plot for the cementing the Powers pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
is diſcovered: No Application can be too Great, no
Charge or Expence ought to be ſpar'd to keep it where it is:
and therefore all that his Majeſty has recommended to the
Two Houſes of Parliament, for their engaging themſelves
vigorouſly in their own Defence, is of ſufficient Weight
on that Side: Nor can any one object that the utmoſt
Application ought not to be uſed, to render all thoſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1185000400:15"/>
as Abortive, as I think they are now become Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous.</p>
            <p>To
do this, the proper Steps are taken indeed; the Money is
lock'd up, and the Ships are lock'd in; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are
diſappointed, and nothing remains but ſo to double and redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
the ſame Efforts, as to make thoſe Lockings-up more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual,
and to take from the King of <hi>Spain</hi> all Hopes of
removing thoſe Obſtructions.</p>
            <p>I am told, while theſe Sheets were writing, that I write too
much with an Air of Contempt, when I mention the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Affairs; as if a Squadron of Ships at <hi>Porto-Belo</hi> could effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
ſtop the whole Channel of Silver, and that not a Ship could
eſcape us, that nothing could paſs from <hi>America</hi> to old <hi>Spain</hi>
without our Leave; and that we are as ſure of intercepting
all the Ships that ſhall ſtir out, as if we had them in Tow.</p>
            <p>But the Objector is miſtaken: I no where ſuggeſt that the
King of <hi>Spain</hi> ſhall be able to bring no Money home, that we
ſhall ſtop it all, ſo that nothing ſhall go by us: But I may ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſay, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Squadrons, if well poſted, and if the
Commanders do their Duty, will ſo narrowly watch the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
that they muſt run great Hazards, if they attempt to
come away with any great Quantity; and that ſuch Hazards,
as I am perſwaded the <hi>Spaniards</hi> will not think fit to venture
their Treaſure upon it.</p>
            <p>Perhaps it may not be poſſible ſo effectually to ſhut up
all the Ports which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> poſſeſs on the Coaſt of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi>
or ſo effectually to ply <hi>off</hi> and <hi>on</hi> upon all the Coaſt of
Old <hi>Spain,</hi> as that no Ship, not one Ship, ſhall be able to ſlip
out on the one hand, or find its way in on the other, without
falling into our Hands, or into ſome of the Hands of thoſe that
would be willing to ſnap and lay hold on them; and I could
fruitfully employ ſome Pages here to ſhow how and which
way ſuch things might probably be done, and might more
probably be prevented.</p>
            <p>But as, in the firſt place, our Governors do not ſeem to
want Directions for the preventing it; ſo, on the other hand,
I am not <hi>Spaniards</hi> enough to ſhow the Enemy, if they ſtood
in more need of it than they do, how to defeat the Meaſures
taken by <hi>Great Britain,</hi> to meet with and ſurpriſe them.</p>
            <p>But to go on. I may grant, that it is not probable the
Confederate Fleets or Squadrons, however Vigilant, or how
diligently ſoever they may guard the Coaſt, and ſpread the
Seas, either on one ſide or the other, ſhould ever be able to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſo effectually, that not one Ship ſhould be
able to come ſafe in.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:1185000400:16"/>
The Sea is a wide Place, and it muſt be very well ſpread
to ſecure every Ship, and lie upon every Point of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs,
ſo that nothing ſhould be able to go by: We ſee here
that notwithſtanding Admiral <hi>Hoſier</hi>'s Squadron on the Coaſt
of the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> and notwithſtanding Admiral <hi>Hopſon</hi> is crui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
off of the Southward <hi>Cape</hi>; yet Fame tells us, that three
or four Ships have found their way into the Ports of <hi>Spain</hi>;
and coming by ſuch different Courſes as they have done, it is
not at all ſtrange that they ſhould: It is true, we are told they
bring no Silver, at leaſt, none that we know of; and had
they been all deeply loaden with Silver, it might have been
the ſame thing, and no Body to blame neither.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, we muſt have exceeding bad Luck in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
and ſuch as we have no reaſon to expect, conſidering
the Numbers of our Ships, and the Vigilance and expert Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of our Seamen, if they ſhou'd go all ſafe, and none of
them ſhou'd fall into our Hands; in which Caſe I muſt add,
that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Treaſure comes in ſuch good round Lumps,
and ſuch merry Sums together, that if it ſhou'd be but <hi>now
and then</hi> that a Galeon ſhou'd fall into our Hands, it would
make the Fortune of the War go ſmilingly forward on our
Side; a few ſuch Prizes might make good a Summer's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,
and help the Government to carry on the War.</p>
            <p>How often do we find the Loading of but one Ship amount
to four, five or ſix Millions of Pieces of Eight; and if we
ſhou'd chance to make ſuch a Ship or two find their way up
to <hi>Woolwich</hi> in a Year, or to' deliver her Loading at <hi>Tower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wharf,</hi>
it would go a great way towards carrying on the War,
and would be a much better way of raiſing Money, than four
Shillings in the Pound upon Land.</p>
            <p>This very Conſideration will no doubt exceedingly weigh
with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in that particular Caſe, <hi>viz.</hi> as to venturing
out with their Silver; I mean not the Loſs only to themſelves,
tho' that would be very conſiderable; (and the Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
and Damage to them in caſe of ſuch a Loſs, is not eaſily
deſcrib'd:) But the Encouragement it wou'd be to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.
The Loſs to themſelves would be inexpreſſibly great;
eſpecially as they have no other Source of Wealth, no other
Fund of Treaſure; all the Produce of their own Dominions
is able to do little for them, compar'd to this; and if either the
Galeons are kept entirely back, or ſhou'd miſcarry in coming
forward, and fall into the Hands of the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies, we
may, without affronting the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſay they will be but in
a ſorry Condition to carry on the War, and to ſupport their
new-bought Friends.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:1185000400:17"/>
But that is not all: The Triumph of their Enemies over them,
ſhou'd the Money fall into the Hands of the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies,
would be infinitely a greater Mortification to <hi>Spain,</hi> as well
to their Pride as their Power, than the Loſs of the Money;
for this wou'd be enabling the ſaid Allies to carry on a War
againſt <hi>Spain</hi> at the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Expence; and this I make no queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
they ſhall do, though they ſhou'd not take the Treaſure at
Sea at all. But of that by it ſelf.</p>
            <p>In the mean time we need not fear but we ſhall catch ſome
by the way, though it may not come all to Hand: As I ſaid
above, we muſt have very bad Luck indeed if none of their
Ships fall in our way; and if any are taken, they are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
worth bringing home.</p>
            <p>The Probability of this is one of the Reaſons on which it
has been ſo openly ſaid, that <hi>England</hi> may Gain by a War
with <hi>France,</hi> but never Loſes by a War with <hi>Spain</hi>; of which
we ſhall have room to ſay more from a particular Enquiry into
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory, where (unleſs upon taking a <hi>Spaniſh
Flota,</hi> a <hi>Vigo</hi> Account ſhou'd be given of it, (<hi>viz.</hi>) where
much ſhou'd be loſt, and but little gain'd,) we might find large
Sums have been brought into <hi>England,</hi> taken from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
on all Occaſions of a War; as particularly at the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
of <hi>Cadiz</hi> by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Dutch,</hi> when it was ſaid
that beſides the publick Gain upon redeeming the City,
and other Articles; all the Officers and Soldiers got not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough
only, but enough to make them rich. But of this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain
in its Place.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, though the Prizes we might take ſhould
be but few, yet 'tis not unlikely we may have ſome Share of
Booty in ſuch a War, as well private as publick; ſuch as may
amount to another Diſappointment to <hi>Spain,</hi> and that, ſuch a
Diſappointment as <hi>Spain</hi> will not eaſily recover, and of which
they may have time enough to repent. And this brings me moſt
naturally to the chief Deſign of this Work, (<hi>viz.</hi>) the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
<hi>Spain</hi> is likely to make of this War which they are
ſo forward to engage in: or, to ſpeak plain, the Advantages
the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies are likely to make of it. In our Enquiry
after which, it may be determin'd by the moſt ordinary Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
whether I have paſs'd a wrong Cenſure in ſaying that
the Conduct of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> is abſurd and ridiculous, or no.</p>

            <head type="sub">Of the Advantages which offer by this War to the

            <p>THE Neceſſity of a War has been ſpoken to. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of our Enemies, however ridiculous, as well as the
Conduct of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> however deliberate, concur to
make that Neceſſity evident. <hi>Let the</hi> Spaniards <hi>go on,</hi> (as the

<hi>God ſend them a good Deliverance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How backward have the <hi>Hanover</hi> Allies been to quarrel?
How have they been ſo far from ſeeking Occaſions, that
they have even refus'd to take Occaſion when offer'd?</p>
            <p>How reluctant have the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Court been in drawing
the Sword? how willing to prevent the feeble Enemy from
bluſt'ring with theirs?</p>
            <p>What Pacific Meaſures have they all along purſu'd? what
Opportunities of offending have they paſs'd over? nay, what
needful Defendings have they ſeem'd to omit? Let us ſee a
little into the Nature of all theſe things.</p>
            <p>Whether has the Backwardneſs of the Allies to a War been
occaſion'd by their Fear of the formidable Power of the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my?
or, Has it been from a full Perſuaſion that the Enemy
having no Advantages in view from the War could not be
in earneſt, in all or in any thing they have ſaid or done about
it, <hi>or at leaſt would remain ſo but a very little while</hi>?</p>
            <p>As nothing they have ſaid about War has been rational,
ſo nothing they have done towards a War hitherto ſeems to
have been founded in Reaſon.</p>
            <p>No Man fights meerly becauſe he Hates, but becauſe he
Hopes. Defenſive War is entred into by Force and Neceſſity,
but it is too with Hopes of being able to defend, able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell
the Force they fear.</p>
            <p>But Offenſive War is founded on a firm Belief of Victory
and Hope of Conqueſt; it can ſtand upon no other Bottom;
and therefore in old Times, entring into War was uſually call'd
an Act <hi>of Faith,</hi> rather than <hi>of Hope,</hi> being an Opinion, nay a
Confidence, of Succeſs; either truſting <hi>in Heaven</hi> for it from
the Juſtice of the Cauſe, or in themſelves from the Strength
of their Arms.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:1185000400:19"/>
But here's a War to be undertaken, with neither Faith in
Heaven, or Hope on Earth: Neither a View of Defending,
or Hope of Offending. How the Heroes of <hi>Spain</hi> will come
off with the Credit of their Underſtanding, That we ſee no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
of; <hi>Time muſt diſcover it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Since then we cannot ſee any Gain the <hi>Spaniards</hi> can make
of the War, nor any Loſs we can ſuſtain by it; let us ſee
what are like to be the Conſequences of it, one way or other.
1. If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are not like to Gain, let us enquire, What
they are like to Loſe by it; for War is a Game in which the
Parties ſeldom draw Stakes, they generally gain much, or
loſe much. 2. Since the Allies cannot (with any manner of
Reaſon) apprehend much Loſs by the War, let us ſee what
Gain may be made by it <hi>on their Side.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Learned in Politicks have an ancient Way of Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as old as Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>) about <hi>England</hi>'s making War,
which (with a little Amendment) reads thus: ENGLAND
<hi>may Gain by a War with</hi> France, <hi>but never Loſes by a War with</hi>
SPAIN.</p>
            <p>'Tis my ſtated Opinion (ſpeaking without National Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice)
that <hi>England</hi> is ſo far from being in Danger by a War
with <hi>Spain,</hi> that it would be no Loſs to us if we never had
any Peace with them; and I believe we have much more to ſay
for a continued War with <hi>Spain,</hi> than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have for
a continued War with the <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Moors.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis plain (as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves ſay) they have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on the War in <hi>Africk,</hi> theſe Eighty Years paſt, without
Fighting, and a Commerce theſe Hundred Years, without Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding.
The <hi>Moors</hi> have indeed beſieged <hi>Ceuta</hi> (after their way)
for above Forty Years; but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſay, that by the
Commiſſary's Account of Ammunition, the Garriſon of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diz</hi>
have ſpent more Powder at the Puntals there in Salutes,
than the Garriſon of <hi>Ceuta</hi> have ſpent in Defending themſelves,
during all the Siege; the late particular Expedition of the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis
<hi>de Lede</hi> excepted, which was but ſhort.</p>
            <p>This Reſolution of <hi>Spain,</hi> never to enter into any Treaty
with the <hi>Moors,</hi> has been derived from one or both of theſe
two following ſimple Cauſes: 1. A religious, rigid Separation,
and fiery Zeal againſt <hi>Paganiſm,</hi> and againſt <hi>Mahomet</hi>; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolving
that the true Catholick Church ſhould have no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
no Peace, no Communication with the Enemies of
<hi>Chriſt</hi>; the ſame futious Zeal which they have likewiſe car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
on againſt the <hi>Jews.</hi> Or, 2. and which I take to be the
truer and more rational Account of it, A haughty Inſolence,
founded on the cruel Animoſity of that War, which for ſo
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1185000400:20"/>
many Years was carried on againſt the <hi>Moors</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> 'till
their utter Extirpation; in which War they gave no Quarter,
took no Priſoners, not would admit even the Remains of
thoſe People (tho' willing to become their Subjects) ſo much
as to live among them.</p>
            <p>Unhappy Pride! How many Nations, as well as private
People, has it ſtruck blind, and cover'd their Eyes from their
own Felicities? The <hi>Spaniards</hi> could carry on no Trade in
the World more to their own Advantage, than that with the
<hi>Moors of Africa,</hi> and yet they won't trade with them, either
from a Civil Pride, that they will only make Slaves of them,
or from a Religious Pride, that they will not converſe with
Infidels.</p>
            <p>Trade knows no Religions, no Sects, no Parties, no Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
We may ('tis hoped) be as zealous to hate God's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as the <hi>Spaniards</hi>; and yet we trade with the <hi>Turks,</hi>
               <hi>Jews, Mahometans, Moors,</hi> or Pagan <hi>Negroes</hi>; and deal with
the Idolaters of <hi>China</hi> and <hi>Malabar,</hi> as well as with the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
Savages and <hi>Cannibals</hi> of <hi>Virginia</hi> and the <hi>Carribees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There's no Idolatry in Commerce; if the <hi>Spaniards</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
the gainful Trade of <hi>Africa,</hi> on Pretence of Sanctity and
Religion, Is that a Religious Separation? I ſay, No: 'Tis not
becauſe they are Wiſer or Better, but becauſe they are <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
that is to ſay, eaten up with Pride, Self-Opinion and Haughti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>That
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> might trade with the <hi>Moors</hi> to great
Advantage, is evident, in that the little Trade they have to
<hi>Africa</hi> (and which they may be ſaid to have with the Place,
not with the People) is very much to their Gain, and would
be much more ſo, if they extended it as they might do. But
they trade with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> Merchants reſiding in
<hi>Africa,</hi> not with the <hi>Moors</hi>; and rather buy the Goods they
demand there, at ſecond and third Hand, than take them di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly
of the <hi>Moors</hi>; ſo they give away their Profit of the
Trade to the <hi>European</hi> Nations, to gratify the Averſion they
have to the People.</p>
            <p>It is an undoubted Maxim in Trade, <hi>That we ought to Trade
with every Nation, and with every People that we can get Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney
by.</hi> This the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ſo far from purſuing, that they
will not deal with the <hi>Moors,</hi> even for the Things which in
Commerce they may be ſaid to be in Diſtreſs for, only becauſe
they won't deal with them.</p>
            <p>In the utmoſt Diſtreſs which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are ſometimes
in for want of Corn, how do they chuſe to ſend to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
to <hi>Holland,</hi> to the <hi>Levant,</hi> or indeed any where for Corn,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1185000400:21"/>
rather than to <hi>Africa,</hi> rather than deal with the <hi>Barbarians,</hi>
tho' the <hi>Barbary</hi> Coaſt ſometimes has a great Plenty, and
tho' they give two Dollars <hi>per</hi> Buſhel for the Corn, which
they could buy there for <hi>3s.</hi> or thereabouts, and ſometimes
for much leſs.</p>
            <p>In their rejecting now the Manufactures of <hi>Europe,</hi> how
eaſy would it be to ſupply themſelves with a Quantity of
Wool from <hi>Barbary,</hi> which, with a ſmall Application, would
mix and work up with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool, and make all the
ſeveral Manufactures of <hi>England</hi> to Perfection, and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite
Advantage of <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf: But, forſooth, they muſt
not Buy or Sell with the <hi>Mahometans</hi> and Enemies of Chriſt;
tho' Himſelf gave them a quite different Example, accepting
of a Draught of cold Water from the <hi>Samaritan,</hi> with whom
the <hi>Jews</hi> (<hi>Spaniard-like</hi>) had no Dealings.</p>
            <p>But (contrary to the Beneficent, Humble, and Gracious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
of Chriſt himſelf) the proud <hi>Spaniards</hi> (pretending Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion)
throw away their Commerce, ſcorn the Bleſſings of
an advantageous Trade, and rather maintain a conſtant unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
National Feud, a fooliſh, faint, and unactive War;
refuſing to trade with the <hi>Moors,</hi> and carrying on neither
Peace or War.</p>
            <p>As this Caſe ſtands with <hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Barbary</hi> Shore, the
Former is infinitely to blame, and may be ſaid to act ridiculouſly,
becauſe, as above (ſpeaking in the Language of Merchants) e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
Body ſhould be Traded with that you can gain by. No
Nation willingly interrupt their own Commerce, or refuſe to
let their Subjects trade with ſuch other Nations as they can
gain by. For a Trading Nation to Prohibit the Importation
of ſuch Goods as they want, is like Prohibiting the bringing in
Corn in a Famine, or Prohibiting Arms and Ammunition
in a War. When the War was hotteſt between <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> King prohibited almoſt all the reſt of
our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Goods, forbidding, upon the ſevereſt Penalties,
the bringing any of thoſe Goods into any Part of his Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
it was obſervable however that they always excepted
<hi>Wool, Leather,</hi> and <hi>Lead</hi>; theſe were never Prohibited; the
Reaſon was plain, they had none, or but very little of their
own, and very much wanted them all; nor could they be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed
(at leaſt not ſufficiently) from any other Place.</p>
            <p>Now the <hi>Spaniards</hi> act by none of theſe Prudentials, for
they refuſe to Trade with the <hi>Moors,</hi> or Merchants of <hi>Africa,</hi>
though they might gain very conſiderably by it. The <hi>Africans</hi>
have Corn, Copper, Wax, Wool, all which the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
extremely want, and yet will not buy, becauſe (forſooth) they
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1185000400:22"/>
don't like the <hi>Moors</hi> worſhipping <hi>Mahomet</hi>; as if Religion
had any thing to do with Commerce, and as if the Bread
made of <hi>African</hi> Corn, would infect their People with Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</p>
            <p>Now
I alledge, and inſiſt upon it, That in a conſtant
State of War between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> the Caſe would
be quite otherwiſe, for here would be War without Prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
as in their Management with the <hi>Moors,</hi> they have Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition
without War. I explain my ſelf thus:</p>
            <p>As we Trade with <hi>Spain,</hi> the State of Things lies ſo much
to the Advantage of <hi>Spain,</hi> that tho' the moſt violent War
that it is poſſible to imagine was to be carried on between
the Nations, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (that is to ſay, the Merchants)
would endeavour with the utmoſt Art to carry on the
Trade, notwithſtanding the ſtricteſt Prohibitions: The Reaſon
is plain;</p>
            <p>They would Trade, becauſe they gain by the Trade; the
Trade to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> takes off the Growth and Produce,
which they are ruin'd if they do not Sell, and ſupplies them
with Neceſſaries which they are ruin'd if they cannot Buy:
In a word, they have no Commerce without us; their whole
Export is ſtagnated; their Fruits (their Wines, and their Oyl)
would rot upon the Trees, and not be worth gathering; their
Lands lye uncultivated, and no Hands be employ'd; the Poor
would ſtarve, and the Rich be beggar'd and undone: In ſhort,
we buy nothing of <hi>Spain,</hi> but what we can very well be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out,
and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> take nothing of us, but what they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
want.</p>
            <p>On the other Hand, take the Alternative in the Commerce;
what the <hi>Engliſh</hi> buy in <hi>Spain,</hi> as it is the Growth and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
of the Country, 'tis eſſential to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to have
thoſe Goods taken off their Hands, and by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> too in
particular; the Reaſon is, becauſe if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> do not take
them off, no other Nation can do it. <hi>For Example</hi>:</p>
            <p>The Growth and Product of <hi>Spain</hi> conſiſts (ſo far as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards
Trade) of Wines, that is to ſay, <hi>Sherry, Alicant, Tent,</hi>
               <hi>Mountain-Malaga</hi>; <hi>Galitia</hi> and <hi>Viana</hi> Reds; <hi>Barcelona</hi> and
<hi>Bene Carlo</hi> Reds, and <hi>Canary</hi> Whites; <hi>Barcelonian</hi> Brandy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
alſo Fruits, ſuch as <hi>Malaga</hi> and <hi>Alicant</hi> Raiſins, Oranges,
Limons, Almonds: beſides <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Wool, <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Iron, and
laſtly, Oil and Soap.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things being the Growth of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> buy
in very great Quantities; if they are not bought off, <hi>Spain,</hi> as
to the Trade of it, is ruin'd and undone: whereas if <hi>England</hi>
bought none of thoſe Goods from <hi>Spain,</hi> they could either
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1185000400:23"/>
do without them (for neither Wine, or Brandy, or Raiſins,
or Oranges, or Lemons, are ſo neceſſary to Life, or to Trade,
as that we cannot, as to the moſt of them, live without them)
or as to Trade, have them ſomewhere elſe.</p>
            <p>So that upon the whole, there is no abſolute Neceſſity on
our Side, to have the Growth of <hi>Spain</hi>; but there is a Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
on the Side of <hi>Spain</hi> to be Traded with, ſo as to have their
Goods taken off.</p>
            <p>It is true, the taking off the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufacture by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
is very much the Advantage of <hi>Great Britain</hi>; but all
that is Advantageous is not Neceſſary: We are able to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in Trade, without the Profits of our Manufactures, bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are able to ſubſiſt in Life, without the
Uſe of them. Nor is that all; for let the King of <hi>Spain</hi> paſs
what Negatives and Prohibitions he pleaſes, the Neceſſity of
thoſe Manufactures will make their own Way, and the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
muſt wear them, or wear nothing at all, for they have no
equivalent Manufacture to place in the room of them; and if
they have them not from <hi>England,</hi> they will have them from
<hi>Portugal,</hi> from <hi>Italy,</hi> or from other Places, as has been the
Caſe in all the Wars which have happened between <hi>England</hi>
and <hi>Spain,</hi> in which Commerce has been Prohibited.</p>
            <p>But the Weight does not lye in this Part. The <hi>Spaniards</hi>
may Prohibit Trade with <hi>England</hi> when they pleaſe, they will
puniſh themſelves infinitely more than <hi>England.</hi> But take the
Trade of <hi>America</hi> into the Conſideration, and truly there let
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have a Care what they do: Let them take heed,
leſt inſtead of Prohibiting their People Trading with us, that
is, with <hi>England</hi>; I ſay, let them take heed that we (<hi>England</hi>)
do not Prohibit their Trade with one another, and among
themſelves.</p>
            <p>By Prohibiting the Trade among themſelves, and with one
another, I mean (for it requires Explanation) that it is in the
Power of <hi>England</hi> (in conſequence of this War, and by the
Means of it) entirely to Interrupt, nay, to Stop the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
between <hi>America</hi> and <hi>Old Spain</hi>: And thus I am come
to my Text, namely, to enquire into what the Allies may gain by
this War: How it may be carried on by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi>
Nation, in ſuch a Manner, as that Old <hi>Spain</hi> ſhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
more have any Commerce with <hi>America</hi>; that is to ſay, not
<hi>Excluſively,</hi> that they ſhould no more call it their own Trade,
but the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America</hi> ſhall be entirely ſet free, as to
Trade; ſhall be Independent of Old <hi>Spain</hi>; receive no Laws
or Limitations from them; but be at full Liberty to Trade
with all the World, if they pleaſe; or if we pleaſe, rather;
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1185000400:24"/>
for it would be meet to inſiſt upon ſome Limitation on our
Side too.</p>
            <p>Nor do I concern the Civil Government of <hi>New Spain,</hi> in
any Part of this Proviſion; <hi>England</hi> (or <hi>Great-Britain</hi>) ſeeks
no Conqueſts; all they covet is to eſtabliſh Peace, and extend
Trade, and this we ſeem to have fairly before us in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching
War. If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> cannot ſee the Fate that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends
them in it (as it ſeems to me they do not) they muſt go
on, and venture the Conſequences; the thing is plain to me,
they run the Hazard of loſing all the Sovereignty of their
Trade in <hi>America,</hi> by a War.</p>
            <p>They may keep the Sovereignty of the Country, if they
pleaſe, or if they can; that is, if the Natives will ſubmit to it:
but they would ſoon have no Commerce to it, no Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation
with it, other than in common with the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This, I ſay, <hi>England</hi> will have it in their Power to limit
and reſtrain; that is, it ſhall be in the Power of <hi>England</hi> to
take off all the Reſtraints and Limitations of Trade, which
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have impoſed, and do now impoſe upon the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans,</hi>
and upon their own People there, and lay the Trade
open to the whole World; holding the Hands of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Government ſo, that they ſhould have no Power to impoſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
Terms of Commerce upon them in <hi>America,</hi> any more.</p>
            <p>This is explaining my ſelf fully, as to the General Head of
Commerce; and as that Commerce is now Stated by the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Government, between their Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> and
Old <hi>Spain,</hi> or indeed all the reſt of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is obſervable, that the State of the Trade between Old
and New <hi>Spain,</hi> ſtands thus: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> having Planted
<hi>Mexico,</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> and all the vaſt Country between, in the
Nature of a Colony; conquered, or extirpated the Natives,
and taken Poſſeſſion of the Country as their own; in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
of this Right, they give Laws of Commerce to
the Inhabitants, as well Natives, as <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſettled there;
theſe Laws (like our Act of Navigation) are made up briefly
thus, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>America</hi> ſhould drive
no Trade, or in any manner Correſpond or Negotiate with
any Nation of <hi>Europe,</hi> Directly, or Indirectly, but by the
Licentiate, or Allowance of the <hi>Conſulade</hi> at <hi>Seville,</hi> that is
to ſay, the Chamber of the <hi>Contractration</hi> at <hi>Seville,</hi> and by
their Order; and in ſuch <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships, and no other, as ſhall
be Licenſed in the ſame <hi>Conſulade,</hi> or Council of Trade:
which, by the way, is call'd a Royal <hi>Council of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,</hi>
and ſo it is the Licenſe of the King.</p>

This <hi>Council of Commerce</hi> not only limits what Ships
ſhall go out, but the Perſons who ſhall be allowed to go over
in thoſe Ships, and all the Cargoes or Quantities of Goods
that they ſhall carry with them, and the Returns made for them;
which are all Regiſtred in their Books: They have alſo other
particular Powers and Limitations, which the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade
is bound to ſubmit to; but I am now upon Generals only, I ſhall
come farther into the Particulars preſently.</p>
            <p>As <hi>America</hi> is to Old <hi>Spain</hi> what we properly call a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
Country, ſo they (even the <hi>Spaniards</hi> that are ſettled
there) are Govern'd in an Arbitrary Way, as a conquered
Nation, and that notwithſtanding their being Subjects of
Old <hi>Spain.</hi> Under the weight of this Arbitrary Government,
they ſubmit to this among the reſt, That no Ships are allowed
to come into any of their Ports from any Place in the World,
except from Old <hi>Spain,</hi> or by <hi>Aſſiento</hi> from Old <hi>Spain,</hi> as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
or ſome Place or other limited in the firſt Eſtabliſhment
of Old <hi>Spain</hi>; that is to ſay, from <hi>Guinea,</hi> or any Part of the
Coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> they may come loaden by the ſaid <hi>Aſſien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
with <hi>Negroes,</hi> and with them only.</p>
            <p>From the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands they may go ſo far as the <hi>Havana,</hi>
carrying no other Goods but Wines and Pipe-ſtaves, the
Growth of that Iſland; and even of that, the Quantity is li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited,
as well as the Ships.</p>
            <p>Thus the whole <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt is brought under one Head
of Univerſal Commerce, and is call'd the Trade of New
<hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>America</hi>; and is ſtrictly confined, limited, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained
to Old <hi>Spain</hi> in particular, as is mentioned above;
and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in Old <hi>Spain,</hi>
or New <hi>Spain,</hi> have no Commerce, or Liberty of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
one with another, but by the Licenſe of their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>Now
there remains a Queſtion or two fit for the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Old <hi>Spain</hi> to anſwer, rather than an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Author;
but which if they cannot anſwer to their own Satisfaction, it
will be yet harder for them to anſwer another Grand Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion
which follows it. The firſt Queſtions are,<list>
                  <item>1. Are the People of New <hi>Spain</hi> (whether Natives, that is
<hi>Indians,</hi> or natural <hi>Spaniards</hi>) compleatly eaſy and ſatisfied
with thoſe Limitations? And would they not ſhake them off
if it lay in their Power?</item>
                  <item>2. Are the Government and People of Old <hi>Spain</hi> able to
keep faſt thoſe Bolts and Bars by which the Trade is limited,
and prevent the People of New <hi>Spain</hi> trading with the <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropeans,</hi>
in caſe of a War?</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:1185000400:26"/>
Then the Grand Queſtion follows, <hi>viz.</hi> How are the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
ſure, that if the Inhabitants of <hi>America</hi> ſhall at any
time come into a free Trade with <hi>Europe,</hi> by the Means of a
War, they will ever be brought to quit that Commerce again,
having taſted the Sweets of it, eſpecially if they in Old <hi>Spain</hi>
cannot force them to it?</p>
            <p>Theſe Queſtions, rightly inquir'd into, will let the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
ſee (if their Eyes are not cloſed) upon what preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Terms and Conditions their Tenure of the <hi>American</hi>
Trade ſtands, and how ſoon they may irrecoverably loſe it,
if they put the Powers of <hi>Europe</hi> upon a Neceſſity of Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling
their Inſolence by a War. I ſhall ſpeak more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly

            <head type="sub">The State of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade in <hi>America.</hi> How tho'
it is the Property of <hi>Spain,</hi> yet it depends upon the
Juſtice and Friendſhip of the reſt of the Powers of
<hi>Europe.</hi> How thoſe Powers (if they think fit to
withdraw that Friendſhip, or are provok'd to do them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
Juſtice upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi>) are able
to lay open the Trade to New <hi>Spain</hi> at one Blow, and
never ſuffer it to return to its former Channel.</head>
            <p>IN almoſt all the Treaties which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> have made
with the reſt of the Powers of <hi>Europe,</hi> whether Treaties
of Peace, or of Commerce, they have always (from a Senſe
of their own Weakneſs in this particular Caſe) taken care to
Guarrantee their <hi>American</hi> Commerce, by Negative Clauſes;
wherein the ſaid Nations and Powers have generally conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
Not to Interfere in the ſaid Trade, that is to ſay, Not to
ſuffer, or at leaſt not to authorize, their Subjects to carry on
any Trade immediately to New <hi>Spain</hi>; contenting themſelves
with carrying on the ſaid Commerce, or ſuch Share of it as
their Subjects reſpectively carried on, in the ordinary Channel,
and that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſhould enjoy the ſaid Trade in Property
as their own.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to look back to the ſeveral Clauſes in the
Treaties with <hi>Spain</hi> and other Nations, for the Confirmation
of this Article; 'tis enough that it is particularly Stipulated in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1185000400:27"/>
the ſeveral Treaties between <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> and confirm'd
by ſubſequent Treaties ſince that of 1670: Which I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
here, not to enquire how well thoſe Treaties have been
obſerv'd, either on one Side or other; (tho' it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
to ſpeak of that alſo in its Place) but I mention it here,
I ſay, to let it be ſeen how ſenſible <hi>Spain</hi> has always been of
its own Weakneſs and Inability to preſerve that Commerce,
notwithſtanding all the Right they may claim to it, without the
voluntary Conſent of the <hi>European</hi> Powers ſtipulating to yield
and give it up, as above.</p>
            <p>It is not thus with our Poſſeſſions in <hi>America</hi>; the <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
and even the <hi>French</hi> alſo, have indeed the ſame excluſive
Right to the ſole Trade of their own Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> as
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> claim to theſe of New <hi>Spain</hi>; and they have
Laws likewiſe reſpectively enacted, ſuch as the Act of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
in particular, binding their Subjects to ſuch particular
Reſtraints and Limitations of Commerce, as are proper to
ſecure the Property and Sovereignty of thoſe Trades to the
reſpective Powers whoſe Subjects they are.</p>
            <p>But the <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> ſecure in their own Strength,
and always believing themſelves able to ſupport and defend
their own Right, have truſted to that Strength for their
Defence; not at all ſeeking the Guarantee or Protection of
any other Powers, for the Security of their Trade.</p>
            <p>The firſt Inference I draw from theſe Premiſes, is, that a
War breaking out, ſuppoſing that Part to be certain, and eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> becoming Aggreſſors, and beginning that
War, the Powers with whom ſuch a War is begun are then
evidently diſcharg'd from all the former Obligations of
thoſe Treaties; their Subjects become from that Moment free
from all the ſtipulated Engagements and Reſtraints relating to
that Trade; our Ships may then as freely trade to the Ports of
New <hi>Spain,</hi> as they may to any other Part of the World:
I mean freely, with reſpect to any Reſtraint to be laid upon
them from their own Reſpective Sovereigns; as to the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards,</hi>
they muſt do as well as they can; if their Ships of
War attack our Merchants, that's allowed to be but fair, and
we muſt bear it as well as we can; but if their People will
come off to our Ships or Sloops, and buy or ſell, that can
be no Breach on our Side; for the War is begun already, and
all Obligations to limit that Commerce ceaſes.</p>
            <p>The Argument is Short, and to the Purpoſe; the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
may indeed puniſh their own <hi>American</hi> Subjects as they pleaſe,
and treat them as Traytors for entring into this Commerce,
as it is contraband and prohibited by their own Laws, which
Laws are binding to their own Subjects.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:1185000400:28"/>
But the Allies are, by vertue of the War mutually declar'd
againſt <hi>Spain,</hi> and by <hi>Spain</hi> againſt them, effectually, and <hi>ipſo
Facto,</hi> diſcharg'd from all Limitations of former Treaties for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding
this Commerce: And I take the more Notice of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
'tis to be hoped the ſaid Allies, eſpecially the Powers
of <hi>Great Britain</hi> and the <hi>States-General,</hi> will conſider very
well of it, at any ſubſequent Treaty, before they conſent again
to limit their own Subjects from a Commerce, which is ſo
many ways advantageous to them.</p>
            <p>What Reaſon have trading Nations to tye themſelves down
to the arbitrary Laws of Commerce, which the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
may think fit tyrannically to impoſe upon their own People?
'Tis enough that they refuſe to admit any of the Proteſtant
Nations of <hi>Europe</hi> ſo much as to ſet foot among them,
much leſs to trade and live among them; a Liberty which we
no where deny to the <hi>Spaniards.</hi> I ſay, 'tis enough to be thus
excluded from reſiding among them; but if their own People,
<hi>at whatever Hazard,</hi> are content to trade with us, I cannot
ſee why we ſhould pay ſo much Veneration to their Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and their Arbitrary Laws, as to tye down the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants
from a fair Correſpondence and Commerce together.</p>
            <p>Let Trade take its Courſe; let Exchange of Goods and
Money take its due Courſe, and be uninterrupted on all Sides;
let the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the Ally'd Powers come to a good Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
as ſoon as our Government pleaſes; let them
fight and agree as his Majeſty thinks fit; let the Merchants be
at Liberty to extend the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Commerce with their utmoſt
Skill; this need be no Interruption to a Peace; for what has
the peaceable Merchant to do with War and Government?</p>
            <p>It is a ſtrange fit of religious Strictneſs, which the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
think good to practiſe by the Power of their <hi>right bloody</hi>
Inquiſition; (<hi>viz.</hi>) that they will ſuffer no Strangers whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
unleſs <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, ſo much as to ſet a foot in
New <hi>Spain,</hi> much leſs to live among them; and if any <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhman</hi>
or <hi>Dutchman</hi> attempt to live among them, if they
are diſcover'd, they are condemned to the Mines, and muſt
go to work at <hi>Poteſt</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nay, ſo cruel are they, and ſo unmerciful, that if an <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi>
Ship ſhould come upon their Coaſt, in the greateſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs;
whether in Diſtreſs by Storm, and ſo wanting perhaps
Maſts or Sails, Anchors or Cable, or Carpenters; or in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs
for Proviſions, and are wanting Freſh-water, Bread, and
other Proviſions; in none of theſe Extremities will they (as
I have been inform'd) give them Relief, tho' they are by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs
Treaties oblig'd to do it: A Piece of Inhumanity, which
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1185000400:29"/>
I do not find the <hi>Turks</hi> or <hi>Pagans</hi> are arriv'd to, in any of
the known Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>But theſe Catholick Chriſtians on the other hand, will,
even in theſe Caſes of Diſtreſs, which all other Chriſtian
Nations conſider, uſe all poſſible Stratagems to get the Ship
into their Hands; in which caſe the Cargo and Ship is conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated,
and the poor Men, tho' no way offending, are perhaps made
Slaves, and ſent to the Mines without Redemption. Which, by
the way, (not to ſay any thing of the particular Cruelty
with which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> treat their Slaves, and which few
of them are able to ſurvive many Years) is a degree beyond
what is practis'd, either at <hi>Algier</hi> or <hi>Salle, Tunis</hi> or <hi>Tripoli,</hi>
or by any the <hi>Moors</hi> of the <hi>Barbary</hi> Coaſt.</p>
            <p>I need go no farther for the Proof of theſe Things, than
the Authentick Relations of thoſe of our own Country, who have
been upon the Spot, and who have partly ſuffered under
thoſe Barbarities, and partly been Eye-witneſſes to the Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
of others, and to the particular Method by which the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> render themſelves ſo odious to the reſt of the
Chriſtian World for Cruelty and Injuſtice.</p>
            <p>That no Nation but the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> at leaſt no Chriſtian or
<hi>Mohometan</hi> Nation that I have read of, do this but the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards,</hi>
I think I may appeal for the Proof of, to the general
Practice of the <hi>Engliſh, Dutch</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> in like Caſes, and
in the ſame Country.</p>
            <p>It is true, that neither of theſe Nations permit any other
Nations to trade in their reſpective Colonies: Reaſons
of Trade, the Intereſts of Nations, and the Property of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
demands it, that it ſhould be ſo; that the Trade of the
particular Colony may be reſerv'd carefully, ſeparately and
diſtinctly, to the Uſe and Benefit of the reſpective Nation to
which it of Right belongs.</p>
            <p>But in any of the ſaid Colonies, if a Ship belonging to
another Nation is manifeſtly driven into the Port or Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour
by ſtreſs of Weather, or is in Diſtreſs for Freſh-water,
or Proviſions, the Government will allow them Shelter, and
will allow them to take Freſh-water, and purchaſe Proviſions
for their Voyage; and this notwithſtanding the ſtricteſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions
of Commerece: according to the expreſs Scripture-Law;
<hi>If thine Enemy be hungry give him Bread to eat, and
if he be thirſty give him Water to drink.</hi> Prov. xxv. 21. For
all Ships of another Nation are, in the Language of Trade,
and in the Senſe of thoſe Laws of Navigation, <hi>a kind of
Enemy</hi>; as to Commerce, I mean, tho' otherwiſe in full Amity;
and even if they were in Confederacy it would be the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:1185000400:30"/>
It is true, if the Ship ſo diſtreſs'd ſhall tranſgreſs the Law,
and break in upon the Hoſpitality which they meet with,
and ſhall clandeſtinely and privately offer to trade with the
Inhabitants, ſhall <hi>break Bulk</hi> as they call it, and ſell any Part
of her Cargo, other than ſhall be allow'd by the Government
of the Place, for the Payment of ſuch Proviſions as they
are allow'd to buy, in ſuch caſe they are liable to be ſtopp'd,
feiz'd upon, and the whole Ship and Goods confiſcated; and
this is no Wrong done to them, becauſe they are the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and know before-hand the Conſequence of ſuch a
Treſpaſs, if it was diſcover'd.</p>
            <p>Yet even in this Caſe, tho' the Ship and Goods are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcated,
yet the poor Men are not made Slaves; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
they are let go, and may ſhift for themſelves; and are
oftentimes reliev'd and treated with Humanity; as may be
prov'd by very many Examples, even upon the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
themſelves.</p>
            <p>Again: If a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> or a Boat full of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſhould
come to any of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>French</hi> Colonies, and land
there, <hi>ſo be it,</hi> that they offer to bring no Goods to land
there, againſt the Conſtitution of the Commerce mention'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove,
they are admitted to come on Shore, may land, and go
freely up and down, take themſelves a Lodging, may trade as
Merchants, or dwell as Strangers; ſubmitting only to all
the particular Laws of Commerce, which other People ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
to; nor will they meet with any Moleſtation or Obſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction;
while, on the contrary, the bare coming on Shore a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in any of their <hi>American</hi> Colonies, is
Death, or perpetual Slavery, which, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> order
it, is worſe than Death: For, without injuring the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
as they are but indifferent Servants, when Servitude is their
Lot; ſo they are the worſt Maſters in the World, at leaſt
among either Chriſtians or <hi>Turks,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This then being the State of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Colonies, and of
the Commerce, and it being (as is ſaid) conceded to by the
<hi>European</hi> Nations, by ſundry Treaties of Peace and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
hence it follows, that if any of the Subjects of the
ſaid <hi>European</hi> Nations, tempted by the extraordinary Gain of
a private Commerce with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> do either lie <hi>off</hi> and
<hi>on</hi> (as they call it) upon the Coaſt, with Sloops and Ships,
and ſo trade in the Night with the <hi>Spaniſh Perioguas</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes</hi>
which come off to them; as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> of <hi>Jamaica</hi> and
the <hi>Dutch</hi> of <hi>Curacao</hi> frequently do; or do land in the Bay
of <hi>Campeache,</hi> and cut Log-wood, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> from <hi>Jamaica</hi>
and <hi>New-England</hi> have always done; or trade by Force up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1185000400:31"/>
the Coaſt of <hi>Chili</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> have done ſince
their late Licenſe during the Time of War;</p>
            <p>If, I ſay, in theſe Caſes, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> happen to fall upon
them, and take them, burn or ſink their Ships, and uſe the
Men after their uſual <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Severity, tho' it be too inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane
even to mention, yet the ſeveral Nations to which they
belong do not uſually make this any Matter of Complaint, or
reclaim the Ships or Men as if injuriouſly taken, the Trade it
ſelf being contraband; an Example of which we have lately
had in ſome <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships taken on the Coaſt of <hi>Chartagena</hi> and
<hi>Saint Martha,</hi> or thereabouts, by the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Cruizers, who
they call <hi>Garde de Coſta's,</hi> or Guardſhips,</p>
            <p>Not but that thoſe <hi>Carde de Coſta's,</hi> as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> call them,
commit ſeveral Depredations and almoſt Pyracies in taking
Ships, which are not Traders or trading; and this the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
complain of at this Time, and that I believe with good Cauſe.
But that by the way.</p>
            <p>In General, it is true, that this Right of an excluſive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
as it was at firſt aſſum'd by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as a Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
ſo it is conceded to them by the Aſſent of their Neighbour
Nations, and agreed to by Treaty; the very obtaining of which
Treaty is a tacit Acknowledgment that they are not able to
maintain the excluſive Commerce by their own Power; nor
able either to reſtrain their own People, or keep the Ships of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Nations from their Coaſt; and this is the Reaſon of
my entring thus far into the Caſe of the Limitations of the
Commerce, which otherwiſe would not be to the purpoſe, in
the Caſe before me.</p>
            <p>But to bring it down directly to the Caſe in hand. With a War,
(in which War, as it is evident, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves are Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors)
all theſe Limitations and Reſerves of Commerce
ceaſe at once; the Trade is laid open, and it is fair working
not only to break in upon their Trade by all ſuch Methods as
we find practicable, but to make ſuch Gaps and Openings in
it, as it ſhall never be in the Power of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to
cloſe and make up again, no not by a Treaty of Peace.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> (who, in Breach of thoſe very Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
by which their excluſive Trade was conceded to them,
have unjuſtly attempted to open the Trade to a Nation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly
ſhut out,) may find themſelves left naked of the juſt
Defence which thoſe former Treaties always were to them,
and ſo may never be able to recover the excluſive Commerce of
the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies,</hi> which has been of ſuch infinite Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
to their whole Nation, or to call the Trade their Own
any more.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="tcp:1185000400:32"/>
Nor would it be any Injuſtice to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> eſpecially
as (I ſay) they are the Aggreſſors in this War; for if during
the paſt Ages thoſe <hi>European</hi> Nations, now ally'd againſt <hi>Spain,</hi>
were leſs opulent and leſs powerful in Trade, and which is above
all the reſt, were leſs united in Intereſts (trading Intereſts I
mean) than they may be now; and were perhaps willing to
keep Meaſures with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which might in ſome
things be to their Diſadvantage, rather than to let them be
laid too low, or perhaps rather than another ſhou'd reap the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Advantage of it, as was the Caſe in the late War, when
<hi>France</hi> obtain'd an Admiſſion into the Trade to the <hi>Spaniſh Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>:
I ſay, tho' in thoſe Times theſe Conceſſions might be
made to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and their Pretenſions to an excluſive
Trade were ſo far confirm'd, it may not be always ſo.</p>
            <p>If this has been the Caſe, it was the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Buſineſs to have
preſerved the Advantages which that divided Situation of the
Affairs and Intereſts of <hi>Europe</hi> gave them, and to have culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
that Friendſhip which alone was the Safety of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce;
and not by ſuch precipitate Councils as theſe to open
the Door of that Commerce to a People no way in condition
to carry it on, or to protect the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in it, and pretend
(I might ſay, fooliſhly pretend) to ſhut thoſe out who are able to
let themſelves in, and even to diſpoſſeſs <hi>Spain</hi> it ſelf, not of
the Trade only, but of the very Country too, whenever they
pleaſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the Advantages which I mean, when I ſpeak of
the Probable Conſequences of this War; and this is that which
I call going to the Bottom of things. A full Enquiry into
which will open the Eyes of <hi>Europe,</hi> and let us ſee farther per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
than ever before, whether I have wrong'd the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
in ſaying they know not what they are doing; that their
Meaſures are abſurd and ridiculous: in a Word, if I had ſaid
they were mad, (that is to ſay their Miniſters and Managers,
whoever they are; I ſay, if I had concluded them mad, or
next door to it;) it had been, in my Opinion, the kindeſt thing
I could have ſaid of them.</p>
            <p>To have ſaid, they had taken theſe Steps with their Eyes
open, with their Reaſon in its full Exerciſe, with their Poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks
free from Diſtraction, muſt have been to have ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted
worſe things of them than I am willing to charge
them with, and to have intimated, that they were a Set of
Men in a Plot or Conſpiracy to betray their Maſter, and ruin
their Country.</p>
            <p>But be it which of the two you pleaſe, it ſeems to me that

deep Wounds in their Conſtitution, eſpecially as to

is Rich, and Strong, and Opulent enough in her own

and Good of his own People, and of all Mankind. His
Majeſty enters upon this War on the moſt honourable, and
moſt juſtifiable Grounds in the World, namely, to Eſtabliſh
the World upon the immovable Baſis of Peace; that every
Nation, and every Prince, and every Power, reſtrain'd only

Contrary to the meaner Principles upon which Princes too
often make War, the King fights not for Fame: He is placed
by Heaven on a Seat above all the empty Things we fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

Glory; ſuperior to all the Kings of the Earth, as it
affimulates the Deity, and repreſents a King acting by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate

            </q>
            <p>This ſeems then to be the State of the approaching War.
<hi>Great-Britain</hi> acts the Part of the World's Protector. The King,
linking the Nations in a ſtrong Confederacy, oppoſes the aggreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
Diſturbers with ſuch an early and ſuperior Hand, that they
find themſelves diſabled in the very Infancy of their Undertaking.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> (obſtinate and opiniatre) beginning at
the wrong End of their Work, break out into a War,
with ſo little Proſpect of Succeſs, that the World looks on
with Surprize, to ſee them act ſo as their Friends can have
no Hope, and their Enemies no Fear, from the Event of the
Undertaking.</p>
            <p>A Town impregnable, even by its Situation, and made
more ſo by the Addition of terrible Fortifications; open to
the Sea, and their Enemies Maſters of the Bay, able to relieve
it as often as they pleaſe: What ſtrange, unaccountable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings
are theſe: <hi>Spain</hi> ought to remember their Anceſtors
ill Conduct at the Siege of <hi>Oſtend,</hi> which on the ſingle
Article of its being eaſily reliev'd by Sea, <hi>held out a Siege</hi> of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1185000400:35"/>
three Years and four Months, and coſt the <hi>Spaniards</hi> 66000
Men to conquer; whereas being not to be reliev'd by Sea,
the late Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> took it in twelve Days.</p>
            <p>This Town, with all the Advantages of Situation and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification,
has in it a numerous Garriſon of old Veteran Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers,
commanded by experienc'd Officers, furniſhed with all
things needful for a vigorous Defence, and covered with a
ſtrong Squadron of twelve large capital Men of War, ſuch as
no twenty Ships that the King of <hi>Spain</hi> may get together will
dare to engage.</p>
            <p>To attack this Place, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> whole Infantry are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
20000 at the moſt, who (if I may ſpeak without boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing)
are no more able to attack the Town, to any pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
than twenty Men would be to take the Tower of
<hi>London.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the King of <hi>Spain</hi> fails in this Enterprize, 'tis very likely
he ruins the Infantry who are before it; and tho' his Kingdoms
are indeed very large, yet we all know, that it is not the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieſt
thing in the World to raiſe a new Army in <hi>Spain</hi>; 'tis
not like <hi>Germany,</hi> which (as one ſays, travelling thro' it) is
an inexhauſtible Store-houſe for Men, and thoſe Men all
born Soldiers.</p>
            <p>But in <hi>Spain</hi> it is quite a different Caſe: not but that the
<hi>Spaniards</hi> are very good Troops, when well paid, well
cloath'd, diſciplin'd, and led abroad from Home; but <hi>Spain</hi> is
more fruitful of any thing than Men: there are ſo many go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
and ſo very few ſtay at home; ſo many turn Prieſts,
and muſt not fight; are poor, dejected, and cannot fight;
or are <hi>Lazy Dons</hi> among the Gentry, and will not fight, that
it is the hardeſt thing in the World to raiſe an Army in <hi>Spain,</hi>
at leaſt with Expedition.</p>
            <p>Thus ſtands their Affair at home, and in this unhappy Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture
they are beginning the War; a Poſture that I think they
are the firſt People that ever began a War in before.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as they ſtrike a Stroke at <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> they ought to
expect all the Allies to declare againſt, and fall upon them;
<hi>France</hi> in the firſt Place, we may ſuppoſe will be expected
upon their Frontiers with two Armies, one in <hi>Navarr,</hi> and
the other in <hi>Rouſillion</hi>; and in that Figure we ſhall ſoon ſee
how they will go on.</p>
            <p>Let us now take a View of the Situation of their Affairs
as to Trade, and particularly as to that Part of their Commerce
of which I have ſpoken ſo much, <hi>viz.</hi> the Trade of New
<hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:1185000400:36"/>
While the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Squadron remains on the Coaſts of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi>
ſuppoſe in the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> or upon the Coaſts
of <hi>Porto-Belo</hi> and <hi>Carthagena,</hi> either the <hi>Spaniards</hi> muſt fight
that Fleet, or otherwiſe remove it, or there's an end put to
their Commerce on that Side, all at once.</p>
            <p>It is objected, that a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Squadron may indeed inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt
the Commerce in this or that particular Place, but that
this will not effectually ruin the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Trade. The Coaſt of
<hi>America</hi> (as poſſeſs'd by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) is a large Place, 'tis
extended in a vaſt Length, from the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> or the
North-moſt Part of the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and in the Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of 24 to 25 Degrees to the Coaſt of <hi>Surinam,</hi> and even
to the Month of the Gulph of <hi>Paria,</hi> and the lſle of <hi>Trinida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi>
and farther, to the Latitude of five Degrees: So that
here is a Length of 1000 Miles, or thereabouts, in a Line
North and South, beſides reckoning the Depth of the Bay,
and the Indentings of the Coaſt of <hi>Yacatan,</hi> the Bay of <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachy,</hi>
the Gulph of <hi>Honduras, Darien,</hi> and others, which
make the Coaſt above 2500 Miles in Length; of all which I
ſhall ſpeak again in the next Chapter.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, to give the Objection its utmoſt Streſs,
they add, that the Heat of the Climate, the Unhealthineſs of
the particular Places where the Station of ſuch Ships muſt be,
and the want of Proviſions, are ſuch, as that no <hi>European</hi>
Fleet can bear to be conſtantly ſtation'd in thoſe Seas.</p>
            <p>That as well at <hi>La Vera Cruz,</hi> as at <hi>Porto-Belo,</hi> which
are the two Centres of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commerce, the Air is ſo
unhealthy by reaſon of the exceſſive Heats, that even the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi>
themſelves cannot dwell there, and only come at the
particular times of Trade, when the Ships from Old <hi>Spain</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive,
when they buy their Goods, deliver their Money, finiſh
their Diſpatches and Letters to <hi>Europe,</hi> and return again, the
former to the great City of <hi>Mexico,</hi> and the latter to <hi>Panama,</hi>
and thence to <hi>Lima,</hi> and the other Ports on the Coaſt of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ru</hi>
and <hi>Chili</hi> in the <hi>South-Seas.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this is evident at this time, for that the Galeons being
(as it were) beſieged, or block'd up by the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Squadron,
their Men preſently grow ſickly, and dye a-pace; nor perhaps
are the Men in the Squadron it ſelf quite free, tho' being bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
furniſh'd with Proviſions than the <hi>Spaniards, for the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
yields little or nothing there-abouts</hi>; I ſay, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors
being better furniſhed, and better taken care of, and bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
fed, the Men are by conſequence better able to bear the
Inconvenience of the Seaſon: yet the Place is allowed to be
ſuch as admits no long Stay.</p>
            <p>

That the <hi>Scots,</hi> in their Settlement at <hi>Darien,</hi> which is but
a little South from <hi>Porto-Belo,</hi> found by ſad Experience,
that there was no bearing the Situation; tho' the <hi>Scots</hi> are as
hardy a People, and as able to bear the Extremities of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
as moſt Nations in <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am the more willing to give the utmoſt Length to theſe
ſeeming Objections, becauſe when they ſhall be fully and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerably
removed, they will leave the leſs to ſay by a Set
of People who deal in Miſrepreſentations and Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
as a particular Traffick of their own; and calculated
for a particular Cauſe, which wanting ſome Cordials, knows
not where to find or make any better.</p>
            <p>It is true, the Coaſt of <hi>America</hi> (as now poſſeſs'd by the
<hi>Spaniards</hi>) is exceeding large, as is deſcribed; and that the
great Gulph of <hi>Mexico</hi> is not to be block'd up by a Squadron
of Ships; the ſeveral Ports for Trade being ſo remote one
from another, and that in the whole the Coaſt may lie exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
above 2000 Miles.</p>
            <p>It is likewiſe true, that the Ports of <hi>La Vera Cruz</hi> and <hi>Porto
Belo,</hi> which are at preſent the Centre of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
in thoſe Parts, are unhealthy dangerous Climates, the
Shores deſtitute of Proviſions, the Heats exceſſive, airleſs, and
not refreſh'd with Land Breezes, as in other Places; and that
even the <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves are not able to bear the Extreams
of the intemperate Seaſons, ſuch as the Summer's Heat, and
the Winter's Rain, eſpecially about <hi>Porto Belo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the Miſtake of all this lies in the Ignorance of thoſe
that lay the Streſs of this Cauſe, upon the poſting an <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Navy or Squadron only for the Interrupting this Commerce;
whereas there is nothing more plain, than that the Ally'd
Powers are able at once, not only to Interrupt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Commerce, but to put an entire End to it, and in a Word, break
off all ſettled Correſpondence between the two Countries, I
mean of Old <hi>Spain</hi> and New <hi>Spain,</hi> and this without hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Ships or Men to lye upon an unwholeſome Coaſt,
and poiſon themſelves with the ſtagnate Air of <hi>Darien</hi> or the
<hi>Baſtimentos.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Not but that on this Occaſion, the Galeons being in the
Port, it became neceſſary to poſt a Squadron, as Admiral <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier</hi>
has been poſted; to ſtagnate the Money, as well as give
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> a Taſte of the ſtagnate Vapours of the Place,
and to keep them where they were. If they are ill furniſh'd
with Proviſions, if the Country cannot ſupply them, if the
Stores in their Ships are not ſufficient for them, they are at
home, they muſt take care of themſelves; no doubt but by
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1185000400:39"/>
Land-Carriage, or by the great Lake of <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> which
runs eighty Leagues within the Land, and reaches within fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
Leagues of the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> they may be ſufficiently fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with Proviſions, at leaſt may have ſome Relief in their
preſent Exigence; for it is very well known, that the Country
of <hi>Guatimala,</hi> bordering on that great Lake, is the moſt fruitful,
pleaſant, and plentiful of any Part of <hi>Spaniſh America</hi>; or
elſe their own Accounts of it are very falſe, and they have
deſcribed it much more to their own Advantage, than they can
make out, when they find occaſion to make uſe of it.</p>
            <p>But if it ſhould be ſo, that they are diſtreſs'd, for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions,
as I ſay above, <hi>they are at Home</hi>; they are under
no Reſtraints; they have no Enemies landed upon them; they
may ſend for Proviſions where they are to be had, and may
ſend Expreſſes to the Governours of the ſeveral Countries to
ſupply them, and to find Means to convey them: Certainly
the Governours will not ſuffer the King of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Ships
to want Victualing, or ſuffer the poor Seamen to ſtarve
upon their own Coaſts, and (as may be ſaid) at their own
Doors.</p>
            <p>But we are not ſpeaking of an Advantage to <hi>Great Britain</hi>
only in this preſent depending Article of Blocking up the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi>
Galeons, which is a thing of to-day, and, as we may ſay,
will be over to-morrow; is done to ſerve a particular Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and will ſerve that Occaſion moſt effectually; for we ſee
how ill able the <hi>Spaniards</hi> are to bear the Diſappointment, and
what a Check it gives to their Enterprizes, how low their
Credit runs in <hi>Europe,</hi> and how even their Auxiliaries and
Confederates (as it were) ſtand ſtill 'till they ſee from
what other Springs the promis'd Streams of Money will
flow.</p>
            <p>The Occaſion therefore is abundantly ſerved by the <hi>Britiſh</hi>
A'dmiral poſting his Squadron at the Entrance of the Harbour
of <hi>Porto Belo,</hi> and hindering the Galeons from coming out,
ſpreading the Sea with his Cruiſers, and interrupting their
Commerce; and in a Word, locking up their Money ſo, as
that tho' it be in their own Poſſeſſion, it is yet out of their
Reach, and rendered (at leaſt for the preſent) as uſeleſs to
them, as if it was in the Mines at <hi>Potoſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And tho' it is far from being mention'd as any part of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
hinted at in my Title, and which are offer'd to the
Allies in the preſent War, any farther than it is an Accident
to the Beginning, and a particular Circumſtance which falls
in to the Encouragement of our Friends, and the great Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment
of the Enemy; yet it muſt be acknowledged too,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1185000400:40"/>
that it is a very great Advantage in its Kind; and it ſhows
the World, that the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> with all the Funds of their
immenſe Treaſure, which it may be ſaid they are Maſters of,
beyond all the Nations of <hi>Europe</hi>; yet are ſo unhappily ſituated,
that they muſt as it were be oblig'd to ask their Neighbours
leave to bring it home, and dare not venture abroad with it,
if but nine or ten Men of War appear upon their Coaſts.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all this, and ſuppoſing this Expedition
of <hi>Porto-Belo</hi> were to be reckon'd as nothing in the preſent
Account of the Advantages of the War; it is manifeſt that
their whole <hi>Weſt-India</hi> Commerce is in the Hands, and at the
Mercy of the Allies, in this War; that we are able to put an
End to it at once, if we think fit; and that not for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
only, but for the time to come, whenever the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
thinks fit to enter into Meaſures for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>And not to pretend to lead our Leaders, or to direct them,
in whoſe Direction the whole Government is already
ſo wiſely ſteer'd; I may venture to lay before you the Schemes
of former Times, and make ſome ſmall Inferences from
them; which if our Governours pleaſe to make any Uſe of,
they may doubtleſs very much improve; and if they do not
think fit to make uſe of, they will, 'tis hoped, not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleas'd
at any well-deſigning Subject (however injuriouſly
miſrepreſented) mentioning ſuch things for their Service as
are apparently capable of anſwering the End if accepted, and
can be Hurtful to none if rejected.</p>
            <p>Nor can it be ſaid, that it is a diſcovering the Weakneſs
of the Enemy to themſelves, and putting them upon ſecuring
themſelves where they lie open, ſince the Enemy are far from
being ignorant of the Diſadvantage they lie under; they are
not ſo inſenſible of the weak Part, and have been ſenſible of it
many Years ago, but find there is no Poſſibility of preventing
the Conſequences, but by being Maſters at Sea; which is an
Article that never was but once their Chance, and is never
likely to happen to them again; at leaſt it will not in this War,
whatever it may do in After-times.</p>
            <p>If ſome things offer in <hi>this War,</hi> which have not offer'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
at leaſt not to be ſo practicable in any former War;
and if wiſer Heads than mine have not yet ſeen them, or
rather not look'd into them, ſo much as perhaps they may ſee
reaſon to do hereafter; I hope it will be no Offence to give
any Lights, however unworthy and ill-eſteem'd the Perſon,
who ſo officiouſly offers them for the publick Service, and
however ſinking under the Weight of unjuſt Calumny his
Opinion may be ſlighted, yet he may boldly ſay, his Reaſons
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1185000400:41"/>
ſhall not be confuted, nor any Scheme he lays down be
juſtly objected againſt by the moſt envious, either on one Side or
other. As to their being made uſe of, or not made uſe of, that
is an Affair by it ſelf, and which at preſent it becomes him to
ſay nothing about, unleſs it is made his Duty.</p>

In calling up this ſhort piece of Hiſtory, I deſire my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
to keep their Eyes ſtrictly upon the exact Parallel of
Times and Circumſtances, leaving the Perſons quite out of
the Queſtion, and to ſtand and fall as their Fate has long ago
directed; and let it be <hi>Oliver,</hi> or <hi>Oliver's Maſter,</hi> the—it
matters not here, as the great <hi>Andrew Marvel</hi> ſaid of him.<q>
                  <l>Tho' his Government did a Tyrant reſemble,</l>
                  <l>He made <hi>England</hi> Great, and her Enemies Tremble.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>His Meaſures at Home are nothing to me, nor much indeed to
any of us, now they are over. Heaven ſuffer'd him to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
things, and then Heaven over-turn'd things again; and
having viſited the Nation for their Crimes, viſited their Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictors
afterwards, ſcourg'd the Scourgers, and reſtor'd the
Government. Juſt as in ancient Times he delivered up his
People to the <hi>Aſſyrian,</hi> and then reſtor'd his People again,
and deſtroyed their Deſtroyers.</p>
            <p>But I am talking not of <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Conduct at home, or
his Meaſures with his Governours, but his Meaſures with
the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and with them only.</p>
            <p>It was about the Year 1655, when the War with <hi>Spain</hi>
continuing, after ſeveral other Attempts, the Council of War
received ſome Propoſals laid before them by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
Order, for an Expedition to the <hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies</hi>;
(and as I had it not from Hiſtory, but by a very Authentick,
tho' Verbal Relation, from a Member of the very Council of
War, to whom it was referr'd) a Deſcent was propos'd
to be made upon the Continent of New <hi>Spain</hi>; This was
in order to ſeize ſome Strength there, keep the Poſſeſſion of
it, fortifie and place a Garriſon in it, to be defended after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
againſt all the Power of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> ſo by that means
to extend themſelves Gradually into the Country, plant and
cultivate, ſtill fortifying as they ſhould go on, 'till at length they
might eſtabliſh a Colony there, and ſo ſhare with the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi>
the Poſſeſſion of <hi>America</hi>; and perhaps lying between the
two great Empires which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> poſſeſs, <hi>viz.</hi> North and
South <hi>America,</hi> or as in particular they may be call'd, <hi>Mexico</hi>
and <hi>Peru,</hi> cut off the Communication, and poſſeſs the Shores
of both Seas, that is to ſay, the Ports of <hi>Nombre de Dios,</hi>
(which is much the ſame as <hi>Porto Belo</hi>) and <hi>Panama.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this Propoſal, it was ſuppos'd, a Door would be immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
open'd to a Commerce with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> that a
Trade would be carried on to infinite Advantage, a vaſt Expence
of the Woollen Manufacture follow, and a return in Specie
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1185000400:43"/>
be immediately and directly made to <hi>England</hi>; without tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
about by old <hi>Spain,</hi> and under the Limitations and Reſtricti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as it always was before; and that in
particular, while the War continued, very great Sums would
frequently fall into the Hands of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> by keeping a
certain Number of Ships of War always cruiſing in thoſe
Seas; and having the Port of ſuch Place as ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd
to retreat into, refit, revictual, and ſhelter themſelves
upon all Occaſions.</p>
            <p>The Offer was ſpecious, the Adventure bold, and the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs
promiſing: But upon farther and mature Deliberation,
tho' the Enterpriſe was accepted and undertaken in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
yet the Meaſures were chang'd; the Place expected to
be attack'd was rejected, and a new Scheme (as ſome ſaid, of
his own) was appointed for the Expendition, and that was to
attack the <hi>Havana,</hi> the principal Port, and the chief Strength
of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America</hi>; at leaſt it was, and is ſtill a
Place of the greateſt Importance to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> of any in
all their <hi>American</hi> Dominions, as ſhall appear preſently;
The Reaſons given for this Alteration of Counſels were ſuch,
as preſently made an Impreſſion upon All that were conſulted
about it, and the new Undertaking was unauimouſly reſolv'd
on.</p>
            <p>In order to carry on an Enterpriſe of ſuch Importance, a
Fleet and an Army was prepar'd, and that with all the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition
and Secrecy, that ſuch a Deſign call'd for: Nor 'till
the Troops were ready to Embark, was it ſo much as gueſs'd
at whither they were deſign'd.</p>
            <p>However the jealous <hi>Spaniards,</hi> made afraid from the
meer Importance of the Place, rather than by any certain
Knowledge of the Deſign, ſent away ſome Ships of War,
with Stores of Ammunition and Supply of Troops for the
Garriſons of the <hi>Havana,</hi> and of <hi>Chartagena,</hi> as the two moſt
ſignificant Places they poſſeſs'd in all their <hi>American</hi> Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
at leaſt on that Side; and theſe Ships arriv'd before the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſome conſiderable time.</p>
            <p>The Deſign was at laſt made known: only to amuſe the
<hi>Spaniards, Carthagena</hi> was given out as the Place intended to
be attack'd: The Squauron ſail'd, the Troops about 8 or
9000 Men, and commanded by the fam'd Colonels <hi>Penn</hi> and
<hi>Venables.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Hiſtory of the Voyage is but ſhort in it ſelf, and I ſhall
make it ſhorter ſtill; the Deſign upon the <hi>Havana</hi> miſcarry'd,
principally by the Diſagreement in Councils among the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers;
they were miſtaken in every thing, landed in a wrong</p>
            <p>

Place, (<hi>viz.</hi>) at <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi>; the Men were harraſs'd and
fatigued, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by that encourag'd; they were
repuls'd in two or three Places, and at length they gave
over the Enterpriſe, laying the Blame one upon another re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocally,
as in all humane Diſappointments 'tis very fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
to do.</p>
            <p>Failing in this Enterprize they reimbark'd their Troops;
and tho' the Army had ſuffer'd ſome Loſs, Abundance of
Men dead, beſides thoſe kill'd and hurt in Action (which
was too many) and the reſt very ſickly, the General very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>availing
to come home empty-handed, and undertake no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
worthy an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Army, reſolved to attempt
the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica.</hi> Accordingly they ſail'd directly to the
Place, entred the Port, landed the Army; and being made
wiſe by their Misfortunes, and reſolving not to be beaten,
unleſs cut in pieces, they went on with more united Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils,
and a better Agreement than before; by which means,
and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being not well provided for their Defence,
they took the Iſland, and, to ſhorten the Story, <hi>Jamaica</hi> has
been <hi>Engliſh</hi> ever ſince.</p>
            <p>It is not to be wondred at if the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> after this narrow
Eſcape, went to work with the Fortifications of the <hi>Havana,</hi>
and made it very ſtrong; adding a ſtrong Caſtle at the North
Part of the Town it ſelf, and adding ſeveral Batteries at the
Entrance, whereof one under the Caſtle <hi>El Morro</hi> has a particular
Battery of twelve exceeding long Braſs Cannon, which they
call the Twelve Apoſtles, and which carry, if the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
may be believ'd, a fifty-ſix Pound Ball.</p>
            <p>Since this, and even while they were alarm'd with the
coming of a <hi>French</hi> Squadron into thoſe Seas, in the late
War under Monſieur <hi>Pointy,</hi> when they took <hi>Chartagena,</hi>
the <hi>Spaniards</hi> apprehending the Deſign was againſt the <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vana,</hi>
they cauſed the whole City to be accurately fortified,
and a Fort and a Cittadel to be re-built; by which the Town
as well as the Port has obtain'd the Name of a very ſtrong
Place, tho' far from being what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> pretend to ſay
of it, Invincible. But if it really were ſo at this time, or if
it was five-fold ſtronger than it is, it is of no Value or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance
in the Scheme I am now to lay down, nor ſhall it
be of any Uſe to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in the Caſe before me, any more
than the Strength of any other Place; for what ſignifies its
Strength, when it is not to be attack'd?</p>
            <p>It is not the Fortifications upon the Shore that will Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
any thing in this War; the Superiority by Sea is the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1185000400:46"/>
thing we lay the whole Weight upon, and being Maſters of
the Sea is that which the Sum of Affairs depends upon.</p>
            <p>However 'tis neceſſary a little to ſtate the Importance of this
Port of the <hi>Havana,</hi> in as brief Terms as I can, becauſe this
was the Reaſon why <hi>Oliver</hi> and his Council pitch'd upon it
to make their Attack. By the Import of it, I mean, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of it to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as they are now poſſeſt of it, and
as it would have been to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> if <hi>Oliver</hi>'s General had
happen'd to take it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Havana</hi> is the beſt Port without Diſpute in all the
<hi>Spaniſh Weſt-Indies</hi>; it is ſituate on the North Side of the
Iſte of <hi>Cuba,</hi> oppoſite to the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> in the Latitude
of twenty three Degrees North.</p>
            <p>The Gulph of <hi>Florida</hi> being the only practicable Out-let or
Paſſage from the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> by which all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi>
Ships make their Return from <hi>America,</hi> and by which they
enter into Ocean, which they therefore call <hi>Diſemboguing</hi>;
I ſay, the Gulph being the only Practicable Way, all the <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons</hi>
from <hi>Porto-Belo,</hi> and the other Ships called the <hi>Flota,</hi>
from <hi>La Vera Craz,</hi> come firſt to the <hi>Havana</hi> in their Paſſage
home, and there being in Safety from either Seas or Enemies (for
it is a Port as ſafe from Winds and Storms, as from Enemies)
they wait 'till they meet from all Parts, and, as they call it,
make up their Fleet.</p>
            <p>N. B. There is another Way between <hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi>
which the Seamen call the <hi>Windward Paſſage,</hi> which the
Ships from <hi>Jamaica</hi> ſometimes venture thorough. But
'tis hazardous and difficult, and the <hi>Spaniards</hi> never make
uſe of it, eſpecially with their Fleet.</p>
            <p>N. B. It ſhould alſo have been obſerv'd, that the Fleets
from old <hi>Spain,</hi> make this Port of the <hi>Havana</hi> be the
firſt Place of their Arrival, when they are outward bound,
and coming ſo far in a Body; they then ſeparate as their Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
direct: the Ships for the South go away to <hi>Porto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Belo,</hi>
and thoſe to the Weſt go to <hi>La Vera Cruz</hi>; the
Men of War attending them, or not, as they ſee Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
and as Inteiligence of things directs.</p>
            <p>So that both ways, whether out or home, the <hi>Havana</hi> is the
only Place of Safety, where the Plate Fleet rendezvous, and
where they are cover'd from all Dangers; nor wou'd the
Voyage be eaſily made without ſuch a <hi>Halfway-Port</hi> to ſtop
in, to recruit, to take in Refreſhments, Proviſious, and eſpecially
Freſh-water; after ſo long a Run, as it is from <hi>Cadiz</hi>
thither, in which they have no Place to touch at for-Refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
except it be the <hi>Canary-Iſlands,</hi> where their Stay is but
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1185000400:47"/>
very ſhort, the Road being not at all ſafe, either from Wind or
Weather, or Enemies, even the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Rovers not excepted.</p>
            <p>Having thus given you a full Account of the Import of this
Place to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> I have only this to add; That in the
propos'd Advantages to us for cutting off the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,
and totally intercepting their Correſpondence with one
another, which is the Scheme to be propoſed, This mighty
Port, this well-fortified City, and this excellent Harbour, ſhall
be of no Signification or Importance one way or other; it
ſhall neither be worth any thing to us to take, or to the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
to keep: Allowing <hi>England</hi> to have only the Superiority of naval
Strength, and to be Maſters of the Sea, which I think I may
venture to ſay is not to be doubted, and all the reſt ſhall fall
in of Courſe; the <hi>Havana</hi> ſhall be as uſeleſs to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
as <hi>Majorca</hi> in the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> (comparatively ſpeaking)
nor ſhall it be able, or the <hi>Spaniards</hi> by its help be able, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
our Interrupting their Commerce, and in ſhort, taking it
wholly into our own Hands.</p>
            <p>The Caſe is Thus:</p>
            <p>There is on the ſame Iſland of <hi>Cuba,</hi> and on the ſame North-Side of
it, open to the ſame grand Paſſage of the Gulph of <hi>Florida,</hi> another
Port or Harbour, call'd the Harbour or Gulph of <hi>Honda</hi>; it is about
nine Leagues to the Weſtward of the <hi>Havana,</hi> and upon the very
ſame Coaſt.</p>
            <p>The Conveniences of this Port (among many others) are ſome in
particular which relate to the Subject in Hand, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That it is a convenient Place to form a Settlement upon, and to
fortifie, ſo as with little Expence to make it unapproachable by Land,
and conſequently not to be interrupted by the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. That it commands a fruitful, and plentiful, and healthy Country,
where not only all manner of Proviſions may be had, but where ſuch
eaſy and ſecure Planting would follow, as not <hi>Jamaica</hi> it ſelf would
go beyond it, as well for Trade, as ſupply of Inhabitants.</item>
                  <item>3. But that which is above all the reſt, the Situation is ſuch by
Sea, that not a Ship, much leſs a Fleet of Ships, can go in or out,
to or from the <hi>Havana,</hi> from or to the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> or the
Coaſt of <hi>Carthagena, Porto-Belo,</hi> &amp;c. but they muſt paſs by this Port,
and even in ſight of the Men of War riding here; ſo that <hi>England</hi> has
no more to do than to poſt a Squadron of Ships in this Port, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
it their Station, and keeping ſome of them cruiſing upon the
Coaſt of the <hi>Terra Firma,</hi> as they ſee Occaſion; and let any one that
underſtands the Situation of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commerce, tell us how they
will carry it on without our Leave, and which Way they will get out
of the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> or out of the Gulph of <hi>Honduras,</hi> or (to uſe
their own Language) how they will <hi>Diſembogus,</hi> that is, get into the
Ocean, wihtout (as I ſay) asking us Leave.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>If this is their Caſe (to make the juſt Inference from Things as I
go) will any Man ſay I was too arrogant in ſaying the <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1185000400:48"/>
not to know what they were doing, when they begin a Quarrel
with <hi>England,</hi> that their Proceedings were abſurd, and ridiculons,
and that they ſeemed to be little off from Diſtraction?</p>
            <p>The farther entering into this Scheme of Management, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupting
the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Commerce, requires more Room than can be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
to any thing from ſo mean a Pen. But if any Writer, or Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter's
Maſter, can raiſe one Objection againſt it, that cannot with unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable
Force be refuted, I would be glad to ſee it.</p>
            <p>Let the greateſt Friend to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Intereſt, or the greateſt Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
to the Author of this, tell me, if they can, which way the Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta's
from <hi>La Vera Cruz</hi> ſhall get out into the Ocean, which way the
<hi>Galeons</hi> ſhall beat it up againſt a Leeward Tide (as the Seamen call it)
from <hi>Porto-Belo,</hi> and not come under the command of this Port, or
that of <hi>Jamaica.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is a Paſſage already mentioned, which ſometimes our Ships
from <hi>Jamaica</hi> do make uſe of, which is therefore called the <hi>Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Paſſage,</hi> and which runs from the Eaſt Point of <hi>Jamaica,</hi>
North-Weſt, and then fleering North, goes between the Iſlands of
<hi>Cuba</hi> and <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and paſſing among innumerable Iſlands, Sands,
Shoals, Rocks and other Dangers, leaves the Gulph of <hi>Florida</hi> on
the Larboard Side, and goes out or diſembogues into the Ocean, to
the North-Eaſt of all the <hi>Bahama</hi> Iſlands; and it is true, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi>
may (that is to ſay, now and then a Ship may) make their Eſcape this
Way.</p>
            <p>But I refer it to the Judgment of the skilful Mariner, whether
this is a practicable Way for the whole Trade; and if it were ſo, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
then the Iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> which is already <hi>Britiſh,</hi> would not
be of the ſame uſe for that Courſe, as the Bay of <hi>Honda</hi> would be
for the other.</p>
            <p>I am no Projector, nor am I laying the thing down as a Propoſal, at
leaſt not here; but I think it is plain (at leaſt to me) that a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Squadron
poſted in this Bay, may when you pleaſe put an end to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> in ſuch a manner, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> could
never carry on any conſiderable Trade there again: Always ſuppoſing
what we have reaſon to hope will ever be the Caſe, namely, that the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Fleet ſhall be Maſters of the Sea.</p>
            <p>It may be pretended, that the <hi>Spaniards</hi> may coaſt along the South
Side of that they call the <hi>North Seas,</hi> that is to ſay, under the North,
Share of the South <hi>America,</hi> the Coaſt of <hi>St. Marta, Venezcula,</hi> or the
<hi>Carata's</hi>; and ſo to <hi>Bosco del Drago,</hi> the Gulph of <hi>Paria,</hi> and the Iſle
<hi>De Trimidada</hi>; and ſo going away Eaſt, get into the Ocean that way,
and come home with the <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Fleets from the <hi>Braſils.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>All this, Eke what was ſaid before of the <hi>Windward Paſſage,</hi> is no
more than like a City not entirely inveſted, or that tho' beſieged, may
have ſome ſuch ſecret Paſſages, as that now and then a ſingle Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
may eſcape in or out, to carry a Letter, or bring particular Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,
but which ſignifies nothing at all towards its Relief, much leſs
towards raiſing the Stage, and opening a Communication.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="43" facs="tcp:1185000400:49"/>
Having thus ſtated the Caſe of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> in caſe of a War, and
on ſuppoſition of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Superiority at Sea, how their Commerce
with <hi>Europe</hi> ſhall be interrupted and broken off, and how they ſhall be
no more able to trade, no not with their own Subjects, but by Leave
from his <hi>Britannick</hi> Majeſty, and his Allies: The Inference from
hence is as natural, and as plain, as that mentioned above; <hi>viz.</hi> No
Man need to ask what are our Advantages by a War with <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I know ſome room lyes here for a Queſtion, thus: Suppoſe you
ſhould thus Interrupt their Commerce, what immediate Benefit or
Advantage would that be to us? ſeeing tho' they cannot trade ſo freely
with one another, they may hinder the Commerce of their own Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
with the Subjects of others; and ſo, tho' the Interruption of the
Trade be a Loſs to them, it will be no Gain to us.</p>
            <p>I State this Queſtion, not becauſe it is a Queſtion that any one who
underſtands the Nature of the Commerce of New <hi>Spain</hi> will ask, but
becauſe there are ſome People that will ask more Queſtions in half an
Hour, than—<hi>&amp;c.</hi> and becauſe ſome are (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays) <hi>Wiſer in their
own Conceit, than thoſe that can render a Reaſon</hi>: The Reaſons to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
in anſwer to ſuch Queſtions, if any ſhould be Weak enough to ask
them, are reſolved into not Argument but Demonſtration.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of New <hi>Spain</hi> cannot trade with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of Old
<hi>Spain,</hi> Experience tells us they will trade with any Body: If their own
Ships cannot come at them, to bring the Merchandize of <hi>Europe</hi> to
them, 'tis evident they muſt have thoſe Merchandizes, and they will
ſeek to be ſupply'd with them where they can.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves know this too well; the Marquis <hi>de Puzz<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

Bueno,</hi> in his late Memorial, complains of this as one of the Effects of
Admiral <hi>Hoſier</hi>'s Squadron lying at the <hi>Beſtimento's,</hi> viz. that it covers and
protects what he calls the Contraband Trade, to the Prejudice of their
Commerce.</p>
            <p>Let any one grant me that taking Poſt, or Stationing a Squadron at
the Bay of <hi>Honda,</hi> ſhall command the Commerce of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru,</hi>
as I think it evidently appears it would, I will anſwer for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi>
that they will grant it ſhall lay open their Trade Wholly to the Allies.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> in <hi>America,</hi> rich and at caſe, abound in Money, and have
Plenty of all manner of Proviſions, Wine excepted. They have the
moſt delicious Fruits; they have a Profuſion of Sugars for Preſerving,
which they greatly delight in; the fineſt Sweet meats and Confections in
the World being to be had there, in the greateſt Plenty; they have the
<hi>Cocoa</hi> in ſuch Plenty, that their Chocolate (which is their ordinary Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt)
coſts them very little. They have Fleſh, and Fowl and Fiſh in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance,
infinitely more than they can conſume. And as for Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,
their Houſes are fill'd with Plate, and their Merchants Ware-houſes
piled up to the Ceilings with Cheſts of Silver Coin.</p>
            <p>But with all this Affluence they have no Clothes; they have neither
Linnen or Woollen, Silk or Hair of their own; I mean manufactured,
and of their own making; they have indeed ſome Cotton, and ſome
Wool, and the <hi>Indians,</hi> or Natives, do in ſome remote Places make
ſome ordinary things for their own Cloathing, chiefly of Cotton, and
ſome courſe <hi>peruvian</hi> Wool.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:1185000400:50"/>
But the <hi>Spaniards</hi> (like the <hi>Lord-Danes</hi> formerly in <hi>England,</hi> from
whole Pride and Lazineſs an Idle Fellow was afterwards call'd a <hi>Lurdan</hi>)
are too proud to ſtoop to any thing called Work, ſo that they have no
Merchandize, and conſequently no Cloth, except what they receive
from <hi>Europe</hi>; and ſome <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Goods, ſuch as Callicoes, and wrought
Silks of <hi>China</hi> from the <hi>Philipine</hi> Iſlands, by the way of <hi>Acapulco.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Supply of Manufactures is (generally ſpeaking) the Loading of
the Galeons, including ſome Wines, and Oyl, and Fruit of the Growth
of Old <hi>Spain</hi>; and theſe Loadings chiefly conſiſt of the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture
of <hi>England,</hi> the Silks of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> and the Linnen of <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
and <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Supply has ſometimes been Interrupted by a War, as was in
particular the Caſe in the firſt War with <hi>France,</hi> when the Galeons were
ſtopped for two or three Years; then it was the oddeſt thing in the
World, to ſee how ſhabby and ragged the <hi>Spaniards</hi> appeared, with their
Pockets full of Gold, their Tables cover'd with Plate, and their Ware-houſes
(as above) heap'd up with Silver. And the Author of this ſpeaks
of particular Knowledge, that under one of theſe Diſappointments a
<hi>Spaniſh</hi> Merchant came on board a trading Sloop, on the Coaſt of
St. <hi>Martha,</hi> in a <hi>Periagua,</hi> and bought as many Goods at ſeveral times
as he paid 19000 Pieces of Eight for, and had himſelf not a Pair of
Stockings on his Legs, and the reſt of his Cloaths worn into ſuch Rags,
as an <hi>Engliſhman</hi> with but 50<hi>s.</hi> in the World would ſcorn to be ſeen in.</p>
            <p>He acknowledged that they had Money enough, but no Cloths; that
every thing bore ſuch a Price as tempted them that were Merchants to
ſell till they were almoſt naked. He brought 5000 Pieces of Eight with
him the firſt time, and looking over the whole Ship's Cargo, bought as
much as came to 19000, (the Sum above-mention'd) ſtay'd in the Sloop
all the next Day, when they ſtood off to Sea to be out of Sight, and
went on Shore with his Goods the next Night; returning again
the Night after with more Money; and ſo conſtantly, 'till he had
brought all his Money, and then ſent three other Merchants, who
bought all the reſt of the Cargo.</p>
            <p>If this Trade was carry'd on thus, when at the extremeſt Hazard;
what would it be when, under the Protection of the Men of War, the
Ships and Sloops ſhould come boldly to their Shores, and the Buyers be
under no Reſtraint. Neceſſity obliging them to consive at one another
on Shore, and no <hi>Guard de Coſtia's</hi> to take Cogniſance at Sea?</p>
            <p>Nay, what would it be when the Bay of <hi>Honda</hi> ſhould be a free Fair,
and that all the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Veſſels that thought fit to come thither, ſhould
trade under the Protection of the Place, and be ſafe going and coming,
under ſhelter of the cruiſing Men of War?</p>
            <p>Will any Man ſay that the Trade will not be wholly our own, that is
to ſay, the Allies? for the <hi>Dutch</hi> at <hi>Curacao</hi> and <hi>Surinam,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi>
at <hi>Martinico,</hi> would have their Share in the ſame Commerce; and any
one may anſwer for it, the Advantage would be ſuch, that we ſhould
never be concern'd, tho' there was never to be any more Peace with the
<hi>Spaniards,</hi> either on this Side of the World, or on the other.</p>
