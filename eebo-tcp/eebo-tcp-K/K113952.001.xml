            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>AS none of the liberal ſciences can afford a nobler entertainment to the human mind than poetry, ſo it is preſumed, that a judicious collection of agreeable and inſtructive poems can never be unſeaſonable. Muſic raviſhes the ear, and affects the ſoul; but its ſweet enchantment is of ſhort duration: A fine piece of painting, if carefully preſerved, will mellow into perfection, and perhaps continue the admiration of mankind for ſome centuries; but the works of THE POET live for ever. We muſt, however, except thoſe pieces, which, though intrinſically of the higheſt merit, yet, being publiſhed in a looſe, careleſs, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elegant manner, muſt of courſe, in a ſhort time, periſh in the wreck of oblivion. To preſerve ſome of theſe ſpirited productions, which have been thus unfortunately neglected, is one part of the deſign of this publication. But it will be proper briefly to inform the reader of the nature of our plan. Firſt then, we propoſe once a month (for one year only) to publiſh a ſmall volume of poems, printed in an elegant manner; each of which will take its title from the month at the concluſion of which it is publiſhed, and be introduced with ſome ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal poems, particularly deſcriptive of its proper
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0579800301:4"/>
month: afterwards will be added variety of pieces that are either amuſing or inſtructive (and at the ſame time not immoral), which, though of real merit, have paſſed through the world unnoticed:
<q>
                  <l>Full many a flower is born to bluſh unſeen,</l>
                  <l>And waſte its ſweetneſs on the deſert air.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Though it muſt be confeſſed, that our plan is of an extenſive nature, yet we do not in the leaſt deſpair of bringing it to a conſiderable degree of perfection; as we have laid in a very large fund of ſcarce and valuable poems, are poſſeſſed of many original pieces, and have the promiſe of aſſiſtance from gentlemen of the moſt celebrated names, the moſt acknowledged taſte, and the moſt diſtinguiſhed genius.</p>

            <l>Yet time life's dreary winter brings,</l>
            <l>When mirth's gay tale ſhall pleaſe no more,</l>
            <l>Nor muſic charm, tho' Stella ſings,</l>
            <l>Nor love nor wine the ſpring reſtore.</l>
            <l>Catch then, O! catch the tranſient hour,</l>
            <l>Improve each moment as it flies;</l>
            <l>Life's a ſhort ſummer, man a flow'r,</l>

            <l>Talk of fairies and witches that ride on the wind,</l>

            <l>From ſtreams which northern winds forbid to flow,</l>
            <l>What preſent ſhall the muſe to Dorſet bring;</l>
            <l>Or how, ſo near the pole, attempt to ſing?</l>
            <l>All pleaſing objects, which to verſe invite,</l>
            <l>The hoary winter here conceals from ſight.</l>
            <l>The hills, and dales, and the delightful woods,</l>
            <l>The flowery plains, and ſilver-ſtreaming floods,</l>
            <l>By ſnow diſguis'd, in bright confuſion lie,</l>
            <l>And with one dazzling waſte fatigue the eye.</l>
            <l>No gentle breathing breeze prepares the ſpring;</l>
            <l>No birds within this deſert region ſing;</l>
            <l>The ſhips, unmov'd, the boiſterous winds defy,</l>
            <l>While rattling chariots o'er the ocean fly:</l>
            <l>The vaſt Leviathan wants room to play,</l>
            <l>And ſpout his waters in the face of day:</l>
            <l>The ſtarving wolves along the main ſea prowl,</l>
            <l>And to the moon in icy valleys howl:</l>
            <l>O'er many a ſhining league the level main</l>
            <l>Here ſpreads itſelf into a glaſſy plain:</l>

            <l>Alps of green ice, in wild diſorder riſe.</l>
            <l>And yet but lately have I ſeen, ev'n here,</l>
            <l>The winter in a lovely dreſs appear.</l>
            <l>Ere yet the clouds let fall the treaſur'd ſnow,</l>
            <l>Or winds began thro' hazy ſkies to blow;</l>
            <l>At evening a keen eaſtern breeze aroſe,</l>
            <l>And the deſcending rain unſully'd froze.</l>
            <l>Soon as the ſilent ſhades of night withdrew,</l>
            <l>The ruddy morn diſclos'd at once to view</l>
            <l>The face of nature in a rich diſguiſe,</l>
            <l>And brighten'd every object to my eyes.</l>
            <l>For every ſhrub, and every blade of graſs,</l>
            <l>And every pointed thorn, ſeem'd wrought in glaſs:</l>
            <l>In pearls and rubies rich the hawthorns ſhow,</l>
            <l>While thro' the ice the crimſon berries glow:</l>
            <l>The thick-ſprung reeds, which watery marſhes yield,</l>
            <l>Seem'd poliſh'd lances in a hoſtile field:</l>
            <l>The ſtag, in limpid currents, with ſurprize,</l>
            <l>Sees cryſtal branches on his forehead riſe:</l>
            <l>The ſpreading oak, the beech, and towering pine,</l>
            <l>Glaz'd over, in the freezing aether ſhine:</l>
            <l>The frighted birds the rattling branches ſhun,</l>
            <l>Which wave and glitter in the diſtant ſun.</l>
            <l>When, if a ſudden guſt of wind ariſe,</l>
            <l>The brittle foreſt into atoms flies:</l>
            <l>The crackling wood beneath the tempeſt bends,</l>
            <l>And in a ſpangled ſhow'r the proſpect ends.</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0579800301:15"/>Or, if a ſouthern gale the region warm,</l>
            <l>And by degrees unbind the wintery charm:</l>
            <l>The traveller a miry country ſees,</l>
            <l>And journies ſad beneath the dropping trees.</l>
            <l>Like ſome deluded peaſant, Merlin leads</l>
            <l>Thro' fragrant bow'rs, and thro' delicious meads;</l>
            <l>While here enchanted gardens to him riſe,</l>
            <l>And airy fabrics there attract his eyes:</l>
            <l>His wandering feet the magic paths purſue;</l>
            <l>And while he thinks the fair illuſion true,</l>
            <l>The trackleſs ſcenes diſperſe in fluid air,</l>
            <l>And woods, and wilds, and thorny ways appear;</l>
            <l>A tedious road the weary wretch returns,</l>
            <l>And, as he goes, the tranſient viſion mourns.</l>

            <l>Inchanted by this proſtituted fair,</l>

            <l>Pleaſe while they cure, and cheat us into health.</l>

            <l>And with his taylor ſhare the fopling's heart:</l>
            <l>Laſh'd in thy ſatire, the penurious cit</l>
            <l>Laughs at himſelf, and finds no harm in wit:</l>
            <l>From felon gameſters the raw 'ſquire is free,</l>
            <l>And Britain owes her reſcu'd oaks to thee.</l>
            <l>His miſs the frolic viſcount dreads to toaſt,</l>

            <l>A debt ſo borrow'd, is illuſtrious ſhame,</l>

            <l>Permit theſe lines by thee to live—nor blame</l>

            <l>So ſome weak ſhoot, which elſe would poorly riſe,</l>

            <l>He reſts not in the people's general voice,</l>

            <l>I thought them ſuch, and went prepar'd to pry,</l>

            <l>Thy form divine, and beauty's matchleſs power:</l>

            <l>Ten thouſand beauties grace the rival pair,</l>

            <l>The fading luſtre of one haſtening day,</l>
            <l>This night ſhall ſee the gaudy wreath decline,</l>
            <l>The roſes wither, and the lilies pine.</l>
            <l>The garland's fate to thine ſhall be applied,</l>
            <l>And what advanc'd thy form, ſhall check thy pride:</l>
            <l>Be wiſe, my fair, the preſent hour improve,</l>
            <l>Let joy be new, and now a waſte of love;</l>
            <l>Each drooping bloom ſhall plead thy juſt excuſe,</l>
            <l>And that which ſhow'd thy beauty, ſhow its uſe.</l>

            <l>Now he laments a look ſo falſly fair,</l>

            <argument>
               <p>Caeſar, having reſolved to give battle to Petreius and Afranius, Pompey's lieutenants in Spain, encamped near the enemy in the ſame field. The behaviour of their ſoldiers, at their ſeeing and knowing one another, is the ſubject of the following verſes.</p>
            </argument>
            <l>THeir antient friends, as now they nearer drew,</l>
            <l>Prepar'd for fight the wondering ſoldiers knew:</l>
            <l>Brother, with brother in unnat'ral ſtrife,</l>
            <l>And the ſon arm'd againſt the father's life:</l>
            <l>Curſt civil war! then conſcience firſt was felt,</l>

            <l>Fix'd in dumb ſorrow all at once they ſtand,</l>
            <l>Then wave, a pledge of peace, the guiltleſs hand;</l>
            <l>For vent ten thouſand ſtruggling paſſions move,</l>
            <l>The ſtings of nature, and the pangs of love.</l>
            <l>All order broken, wide their arms they throw,</l>
            <l>And run, with tranſport, to the longing foe:</l>
            <l>Here their long-loſt acquaintance neighbours claim,</l>
            <l>There an old friend recalls his comrade's name,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0579800301:59"/>Youths, who in arts beneath one tutor grew,</l>
            <l>Rome rent in twain, and kindred hoſts they view.</l>
            <l>Tears wet their impious arms, a fond relief,</l>
            <l>And kiſſes, broke by ſobs, the words of grief;</l>
            <l>Tho' yet no blood was ſpilt, each anxious mind</l>
            <l>With horror thinks on what his rage deſign'd.</l>
            <l>Ah! generous youths, why thus, with fruitleſs pain,</l>
            <l>Beat ye thoſe breaſts? why guſh thoſe eyes in vain?</l>
            <l>Why blame ye heaven, and charge your guilt on fate?</l>
            <l>Why dread the tyrant, whom yourſelves make great?</l>
            <l>Bids he the trumpet ſound? the trumpet ſlight—</l>
            <l>Bids he the ſtandard move? refuſe the fight—</l>
            <l>Your generals, left by you, will love again,</l>
            <l>A ſon and father, when they're private men.</l>
            <l>Kind concord, heavenly-born! whoſe bliſsful reign</l>

            <l>Whoſe laws the jarring elements controul,</l>
            <l>And knit each atom cloſe from pole to pole;</l>

            <l>This lucky hour, thy aid, fair goddeſs, bring!</l>
            <l>This lucky hour, ere aggravated crimes</l>
            <l>Heap guilt on guilt, and doubly ſtain the times.</l>
            <l>No veil henceforth for ſin, for pardon none;</l>
            <l>They know their duty, now their friends are known.</l>
            <l>Vain wiſh! from blood ſhort muſt the reſpite be;</l>
            <l>New crimes, by love inhanc'd, this night ſhall ſee:</l>

               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0579800301:60"/>'Twas peace. From either camp, now void of fear,</l>
            <l>The ſoldiers mingling cheerful feaſts prepare:</l>
            <l>On the green ſod the friendly bowls were crown'd</l>
            <l>And haſty banquets pil'd upon the ground:</l>
            <l>Around the fire they talk; one ſhows his ſcars,</l>
            <l>One tells what chance firſt led him to the wars;</l>
            <l>Their ſtories o'er the tedious night prevail,</l>
            <l>And the mute circle liſtens to the tale.</l>
            <l>They own they fought, but ſwear they ne'er could hate</l>
            <l>Deny their guilt, and lay the blame on fate;</l>
            <l>Their love revives, to make them guiltier grow,</l>
            <l>A ſhort-liv'd bleſſing, but to heighten woe.</l>
            <l>When to Petreius firſt the news was told,</l>
            <l>The jealous general thought his legions ſold.</l>
            <l>Swift, with the guards, his head-ſtrong fury drew,</l>
            <l>From out his camp he drives the hoſtile crew;</l>
            <l>Cuts claſping friends aſunder with his ſword,</l>
            <l>And ſtains with blood each hoſpitable board.</l>
            <l>Then thus his wrath breaks out. "Oh! loſt to fame</l>
            <l>" Oh! falſe to Pompey, and the Roman name!</l>
            <l>" Can ye not conquer, ye degenerate bands?</l>
            <l>" Oh! die at leaſt 'tis all that Rome demands.</l>
            <l>" What? will ye own, while ye can wield the ſword,</l>
            <l>" A rebel ſtandard, and uſurping lord?</l>
            <l>" Shall he be ſued to take you into place</l>
            <l>" Amongſt his ſlaves, and grant you equal grace?</l>
            <l>" What? ſhall my life be begg'd? inglorious thought!</l>
            <l>" And life abhorr'd, on ſuch conditions bought!</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0579800301:61"/>" The toils we bear, my friends, are not for life,</l>
            <l>" Too mean a prize in ſuch a dreadful ſtrife;</l>
            <l>" But peace would lead to ſervitude and ſhame,</l>
            <l>" A fair amuſement, and a ſpecious name.</l>
            <l>" Never had man explor'd the iron ore,</l>
            <l>" Mark'd out the trench, or rais'd the lofty tower,</l>
            <l>" Ne'er had the ſteed in harneſs ſought the plain,</l>
            <l>" Or fleets encounter'd on th' unſtable main;</l>
            <l>" Were life, were breath, with fame to be compar'd,</l>
            <l>" Or peace to glorious liberty preferr'd.</l>
            <l>" By guilty oaths the hoſtile army bound,</l>
            <l>" Holds faſt its impious faith, and ſtands its ground;</l>
            <l>" Are you perfidious, who eſpouſe the laws,</l>
            <l>" And traytors only in a righteous cauſe?</l>
            <l>" Oh ſhame! in vain thro' nations far and wide,</l>
            <l>" Thou call'ſt the crowding monarchs to thy ſide,</l>
            <l>" Fallen Pompey! while thy legions here betray</l>
            <l>" Thy cheap bought life, and treat thy fame away."</l>
            <l>He ended fierce. The ſoldier's rage returns,</l>
            <l>His blood flies upward, and his boſom burns.</l>
            <l>So, hap'ly tam'd, the tyger bears his bands,</l>
            <l>Leſs grimly growls, and licks his keeper's hands;</l>
            <l>But if by chance he taſtes forbidden gore,</l>
            <l>He yells amain, and makes his dungeon roar:</l>
            <l>He glares, he foams, he aims a deſperate bound,</l>
            <l>And his pale maſter flies the dangerous ground.</l>
            <l>Now deeds are done, which man might charge aright</l>
            <l>On ſtubborn fate, or undiſcerning night,</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0579800301:62"/>Had not their guilt the lawleſs ſoldiers known,</l>
            <l>And made the whole malignity their own.</l>
            <l>The beds, the plenteous tables float with gore,</l>
            <l>And breaſts are ſtabb'd, that were embrac'd before:</l>
            <l>Pity awhile their hands from ſlaughter kept,</l>
            <l>Inward they groan'd, and, as they drew, they wept;</l>
            <l>But every blow their wavering rage aſſures,</l>
            <l>In murder hardens, and to blood inures.</l>
            <l>Crowds charge on crowds, nor friends their friends deſcry,</l>
            <l>But ſires by ſons, and ſons by fathers die.</l>
            <l>Black, monſtrous rage! each, with victorious cries,</l>
            <l>Drags his ſlain friend before the general's eyes,</l>
            <l>Exults in guilt, that throws the only ſhame</l>
            <l>On Pompey's cauſe, and blots the Roman name.</l>

            <l>Truth's pleaſant path, and virtue's peaceful way:</l>

            <l>That forms the conduct, or improves the ſenſe:</l>
            <l>Still muſt philoſophy renounce the prize,</l>
            <l>Still nature muſt to art ſuperior riſe;</l>

               <head>FABLE II. ALEXANDER'S STICK.</head>
               <l>GOD Alexander, it was ſaid,</l>
               <l>Like mortal man, lay ſick in bed:</l>
               <l>Without—'tis ſaid, without—we hear,</l>
               <l>How can a fabuliſt appear?</l>
               <l>Once on a day—once on a night—</l>
               <l>Time out of mind—are ours of right.</l>
               <l>So far digreſt, let's retrograde,</l>
               <l>Like others of the rhyming trade,</l>
               <l>And tell our ſtory as we can—</l>
               <l>This ſon of Jove was but a man:</l>
               <l>In bed we left him, and no doubt,</l>
               <l>You long to know his ail:—the gout.</l>
               <l>The gout! are kings tormented thus?</l>
               <l>Have they infirmities like us?</l>
               <l>Why not? one clay makes up our frame;</l>
               <l>And kings and ſubjects are the ſame.</l>
               <l>It happen'd, where our god was ſick,</l>
               <l>That on the carpet lay a ſtick;</l>
               <l>Yes, a crabſtick by chance lay there,</l>
               <l>No matter how, or whence, or where.</l>
               <l>The wanted ſtick was valued much,</l>
               <l>And ſoon was faſhion'd into crutch.</l>

                  <pb n="100" facs="tcp:0579800301:106"/>And now the monarch's dear ſupport,</l>
               <l>He thinks himſelf, like ſome at court,</l>
               <l>Of ſuch importance to the ſtate,</l>
               <l>All muſt on him obſequious wait.</l>
               <l>Such merit never can be ſlighted;</l>
               <l>And to be ſure he will be knighted.</l>
               <l>And then aloud how fame will blab,</l>
               <l>That he is dubb'd Sir Broomſtick Crab!</l>
               <l>Favour at court, I've often read,</l>

               <l>How muſt a ſimpleton behave?</l>
               <l>Sir Crab now hopes to be his grace,</l>
               <l>Since he ſupplies the ſceptre's place;</l>
               <l>For if a ſceptre's really good,</l>
               <l>Be it of ſilver, gold, or wood,</l>
               <l>'Tis not the matter which we prize,</l>
               <l>In merit all the difference lies.</l>
               <l>Merit I have no doubt, or why</l>
               <l>Should this great king on me rely?</l>
               <l>Laſt night, his generals around him</l>
               <l>Had left him all juſt as they found him;</l>

               <l>Of future conqueſts form'd the plan;</l>
               <l>Trac'd in the ſand, in caſe of need,</l>
               <l>How to fall back, and when proceed;</l>
               <l>Here we make war; there peace proclaim;</l>
               <l>With us great folks 'tis all the ſame.</l>

               <l>And fix the limits—if we can.</l>
               <l>But who ſhall check our bold career?</l>
               <l>Ambition knows of no barrier:</l>
               <l>Not rapid Ganges, deep and wide,</l>
               <l>Its bordering kingdoms can divide:</l>
               <l>If ſo, theſe kingdoms all ſhall prove,</l>
               <l>What 'tis t' oppoſe the ſon of Jove.</l>
               <l>Thus, whilſt our new-made courtier fed</l>
               <l>The wild chimera in his head,</l>
               <l>Some reſt the gouty hero gains;</l>
               <l>He finds a reſpite from his pains;</l>
               <l>And growing better every day,</l>
               <l>The uſeleſs ſtick is thrown away.</l>
               <l>By this example warning take,</l>
               <l>Ye courtiers! ye who dream awake:</l>
               <l>Court-favours are precarious things;</l>

            <byline>BY MR. C. DENIS.</byline>
            <l>HUlſe ſhook his head—poor Damon lay a dying;</l>
            <l>And cloſe by his bed-ſide his wife ſat crying:</l>
            <l>O ſtay, ſhe ſaid; and muſt we part?</l>
            <l>My ſoul, like thine, is on the wing;</l>
            <l>Methinks I feel death's iron dart;</l>
            <l>But oh! 'tis that which wounds thy heart,</l>
            <l>That bears to mine the ſting.</l>
            <l>Her grief was great, ſo was her moan:</l>
            <l>And much to die ſhe ſeem'd inclin'd;</l>
            <l>Howe'er, ſhe let him go alone,</l>
            <l>And prudently remain'd behind.</l>
            <l>A week, or ſo, was paſt and gone,</l>
            <l>Still ſhe continued weeping on,</l>
            <l>When to her houſe her father came,</l>
            <l>And thus addreſs'd the mournful dame:</l>
            <l>My child, ſaid he, enough of tears you've ſhed;</l>
            <l>Think of the living, and forget the dead.</l>
            <l>Another ſpouſe—don't ſtartle at the word,</l>

            <l>Young, handſome, rich, juſt one of thoſe</l>

            <l>Oh no: my only love is dead;</l>

            <l>The cares of mourning next took place;</l>
            <l>To dreſs her grief, and ſuit her face:</l>
            <l>'Twas Cupid's thought; for what exceeds</l>
            <l>A pretty widow in her weeds?</l>
            <l>And now each looking-glaſs could tell</l>

            <l>The ſmiles and graces, that were ſcar'd away,</l>

            <l>And Cytherea's doves,</l>

            <l>The father, if report ſays true,</l>
            <l>Another viſit made, ere mourning over;</l>
            <l>I'm glad, my dear, ſaid he, ſo well to find you;</l>

            <l>The thing's too ſerious to be made a joke of;</l>
            <l>Where is the huſband, pray, that once you ſpoke of?</l>

            <l>All lenient time expands his wings,</l>
            <l>Away he flies with human cares;</l>
            <l>Then back, full fraught with joy, repairs,</l>
            <l>And every balmy comfort brings.</l>
            <l>Time checks the mourning huſband's ſighs;</l>
            <l>'Tis he congeals the falling tear,</l>

            <l>'TIS now the dreary hour of night,</l>
            <l>When darkneſs ſhuts the ſenſe of ſight:</l>
            <l>Where ſparkles now that florid grace,</l>
            <l>That ſat enthron'd on nature's face?</l>
            <l>That golden flood of glory where,</l>
            <l>That ſtream'd its luſtre thro' the air?</l>
            <l>That private, zephyr-quivering ſhade,</l>
            <l>Where Thyrſis woo'd his lovely maid?</l>
            <l>Alas! the ſun, alas! the ſhade,</l>
            <l>Where Thyrſis woo'd his lovely maid,</l>
            <l>Are vaniſh'd, and the watery dyke,</l>
            <l>And flowery bank have charms alike.</l>
            <l>The velvet lawn, the tree-topt hill,</l>
            <l>The fertile mead, the neighb'ring rill,</l>
            <l>And all, that lately pleas'd my eye,</l>
            <l>In undiſtinguiſh'd darkneſs lie.</l>
            <l>Oh, darkneſs! each extreme degree</l>
            <l>Is reconcil'd alone by thee.</l>
            <l>What now avail Lucinda's eyes,</l>
            <l>That wont to dazzle and ſurprize?</l>
            <l>Or what the captivating charms</l>
            <l>Of Stella's lilly-colour'd arms?</l>
            <l>Since none the difference can ſee</l>

               <l>ON yon black cloud, behold Aquarius ſtand,</l>
               <l>Poiſing an ample urn in either hand!</l>
               <l>The load he ſways, then ſwiftly pours</l>
               <l>In cataracts the deluge down;</l>
               <l>The rough wind howls diſcordant with the ſhowers,</l>

               <l>The dripping poultry ſeek the cloſeſt ſheds:</l>
               <l>The penſive warblers droop their little heads:</l>
               <l>Nor without cauſe. No gilding ray</l>
               <l>Breaks thro' the foggy veil of air;</l>
               <l>But all is pictureſque of blank diſmay,</l>

               <l>Aquarius adds a luſtre to the day:</l>
