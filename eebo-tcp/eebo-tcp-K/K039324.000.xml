            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
                  <p>Murder, Madam! 'Tis Self defence; beſides, in theſe Sort of Skirmiſhes, there are never more than two or three kill'd: for, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they bring the whole Body of Militia upon us, down but with a Brace of them, and away fly the reſt of the Covey.</p>

               <p>To our Wiſhes, Sir. In ſhort I have managed the Buſineſs with ſuch Skill and Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity that neither your Circumſtances, nor my Veracity are ſuſpected.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Sharp.</speaker>
               <p>Beyond Expectation, Sir.—But in that particular I was obliged to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to Truth, and declare the real Situation of your Affairs. I told her we had ſo long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed our ſelves to dreſſing either Dinners or Suppers, that I was afraid we ſhould be but aukward in our Preparations. In ſhort, Sir,—at that inſtant a curſed Gnawing ſeized my Stomach, that I could not help telling her, that both you and myſelf ſeldom make a good Meal now-a-days once in a Quarter of a Year.</p>

               <p>Hell and Confuſion, have you betrayed me, Villain! Did not you tell me this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

               <p>I was going to tell you; but you won't hear Reaſon; my melancholy Face and piteous Narration had ſuch an Effect upon her generous Bowels, that ſhe freely forgives all that's paſt.</p>

when even you, who know me ſo well, can't help ſwallowing my Hook. Why, Sir, I could have play'd with you backwards and forwards at the End of my Line, till I had put your Senſes into ſuch a Fermentation, that you ſhould not have known in an Hour's Time, whether you was a Fiſh or a Man.</p>
