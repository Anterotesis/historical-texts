            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE Deſign of the following Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay is briefly and plainly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent the preſent State of Phyſick in this Kingdom; and to demonſtrate the Neceſſity of a Regulation in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it. And as I'm fully perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſuch a Regulation in Phyſick would tend both to the Honour of the Nation in general, and the Good of her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Subjects in particular; ſo there ſeems no need of making any manner of Apology for engaging in ſo very laudable an Attempt. I can, for my own Part ſincerely declare to thoſe whoſe Chance
<pb facs="tcp:0185201300:3"/>it may be to have this Eſſay fall into their Hands, that the Deſign of it is entirely honeſt, having aſſuredly no other View than that of doing Service to the aggrieved, which is the far greateſt Part of the Kingdom. No private Conſideration of what Nature ſoever could have mov'd me thus to expoſe my ſelf to the Cenſures of the World; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in an Affair for the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meddling with which, 'tis to be feared I may expect more Reproaches than Thanks. For tho' I have often had it in my Thoughts, that a Man could not do a better Piece of Service to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, than to demonſtrate the Neceſſity of ſuch a Regulation in Phyſick; yet the Conſideration of what a vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Enemies he muſt conſequently raiſe to himſelf, did for ſome time, I muſt confeſs, deter me from the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. I was very ſenſible, what a Multitude of People there are, who not only ſubſiſt but enrich themſelves
<pb facs="tcp:0185201300:4"/>by thoſe very Methods which I had undertaken to condemn; and therefore very well knew, that right or wrong I ſhould not fail to meet with a Legion of Opponents. But the Love of Truth, and a hearty Deſire of contributing ſomewhat to the common Good of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, did at laſt outweigh and prevail with me above all other Conſiderations.</p>
            <p>If then the following Eſſay may but in ſome Meaſure contribute to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of thoſe pernicious Encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which have been unhappily made upon the Province of Phyſick, I ſhall have gain'd my End, and ſhall deſpiſe any little Cenſures or Reflexions which thereby I may poſſibly draw upon my ſelf. And tho' I am not at preſent conſcious of any valid Objections which can be made againſt what I have advanc'd, yet do promiſe, whatever they be, if fairly and candidly propos'd, I'll en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to anſwer them in the ſame
<pb facs="tcp:0185201300:5"/>Manner. For to conclude, I have given the Title of an ESSAY to the following Sheets, becauſe I have only touch'd upon, and not exhauſted the Subject.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY Concerning the <hi>Growth of Empiriciſm,</hi> Or the Encouragement of <hi>Quacks.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>HEALTH being the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of Natural Bleſſings, 'tis as needleſs to ſay any thing in its Praiſe as to enlarge up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Uſefulneſs of Phyſick, which preſerves and reſtores it. But as there is nothing which would more
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0185201300:9"/>advance the Uſefulneſs of that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Art, (and is therefore of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Importance to the Publick Good) than a Regulation in the Practice of it; ſo there is nothing conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently more recommendable to the Conſideration of the Queen and Parliament than the preſent State of Phyſick in this Kingdom. The Encouragement which Quacks and Empiricks have lately met with, is not only ſo ſurprizingly great, but ſo vaſtly detrimental, that in the beſt of Governments, where Civil and Religious Properties are ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily ſecured, there ſeems nothing more wanting than ſome ſpeedy and powerful Expedient to reſtrain ſo growing an Evil.</p>
            <p>But before I proceed to offer any of my Reaſons for the Neceſſity of a Regulation in the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, or enter into a Detail of the evil Conſequences (deſervedly to
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0185201300:10"/>be lamented by all who have a juſt Senſe of them) which attend the Encouragement of Quacks and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricks, 'twill not be improper to give the definition of, or to let the Reader know what I deſire may be underſtood by the Words. The Word <hi>Quack,</hi> ſays the <hi>Gazophylacium An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glicanum,</hi> is of a <hi>Dutch</hi> Original, ſignifies a frivolous and vain Tat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler, and ſo is applicable to all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of any Profeſſion, who often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiouſly pretend to a great deal of Skill and Knowledge in Matters which they are really ignorant of, or do very little underſtand: And by a Quack or Empirick, I mean any and every one of thoſe who pretend to practice Phyſick without Knowledge of the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> to that moſt uſeful but moſt difficult Art. There are ſome, 'tis true, who would fain perſwade us, that the Medical Art is only to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0185201300:11"/>by Experiments, or obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving what things are hurtful, what beneficial in Diſeaſes; that the Study of Nature and the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Body are only trifling Curioſities, and things altogether ſuperfluous. But it's agreed, I am apt to think, amongſt the more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent part of Mankind, that there are ſeveral things perfectly and abſolutely neceſſary to be known, before a Man can reaſon, and make Judgment either of the Nature of Diſeaſes, or the Uſe of Methods and Medicines for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medying them, and therefore ought to be underſtood before he preſumes to take the Care of Mens Lives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands: For how can he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to cure Diſeaſes, unleſs he firſt apprehends what they are, and in what they conſiſt? How can he rationally preſcribe Medicines if he underſtands not their Operations?
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0185201300:12"/>Or how can he expect any manner of Advantage from them if he does not conſider the Relation between the Diſeaſe and the Operation? And how can he be qualified to do any of theſe things, unleſs he be firſt acquainted with the Nature, Properties and Functions, of a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body, the Subject of his Art, and to which they relate? And that this was the Opinion of the ancient Phyſicians, is evident from the Variety of Medical Introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Inſtitutions publiſh'd by them. For it was not in thoſe days thought proper that the Care of Mens Lives ſhould be entruſted with Perſons, till they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed in the Methods of preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them.</p>

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0185201300:15"/>to the Practice of Phyſick than an Acquiſition of the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Tongues; for as in thoſe Languages the Art is deliver'd; ſo without them the Terms in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlations are not poſſibly to be underſtood.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The next of the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> is Natural Philoſophy: For as the Art of Phyſick is only the Natural Knowledge apply'd to the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Health and Life; ſo whoever intend to apply themſelves to that Art will find it neceſſary to conſider the Human Body, the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their Art, as a meer Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Subſtance, before they proceed to the Conſideration of it as an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated Being. For tho' the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body, as an Animated Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is, ſtrictly ſpeaking, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Subject of their Care; yet the peculiar Properties of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0185201300:16"/>Subſtances cannot well be diſtinguiſh'd or underſtood, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the common Affections of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be firſt known, out of which, the Human as well as other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated Bodies are compos'd. And notwithſtanding thoſe Particles of Matter, which are modify'd into a Human Body, during that State, are enrich'd with Properties and Perfections, diſtinguiſhing them from all other Beings, yet there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in them ſome Affections com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to other animated Beings, and ſome promiſcuouſly to be found in all Natural Subſtances. Whoever, therefore deſigns to apply himſelf to the Art of Phyſick, ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the general Properties and Affections of Matter; the Origin and tranſitory Nature of Forms and Qualities; and how the Parts of a Human Body conſider'd as a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Subſtance may be mov'd, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0185201300:17"/>he begins to inform himſelf (or indeed rightly can) of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections obſervable in a human Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as animated or endued with Life. And this ſeems to have been the Method by which Novices were heretofore initiated into that Art, as appears by the Inſtitutes of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, Rhaſes, Sennertus, Fuchſius, &amp;c.</hi> as likewiſe in that they have blended and interwoven the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy eſteem'd in thoſe Ages with that moſt excellent Art, and have form'd that proverbial Saying,</p>
            <q>Ubi definit Phyſicus, ibi incipit Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicus.</q>
            <p>But Natural Philoſophy is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abſolutely neceſſary to form a right Apprehenſion of the Human Body as a Part or Portion of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but alſo to frame a true Idea of Medicines and their Operations,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0185201300:18"/>as will more fully appear under that Head.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The next of the <hi>Praerequiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> is the Knowledge of the Animal Oeconomy, or the Conſideration of the human Body as animated or endued with Life, and that as well in its natural or healthful, as in its praeternatural or morbid State; it being altogether neceſſary to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the natural State of the Body before the Nature of a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe can be rightly comprehended. The Animal Body is now known to be a pure Machine, and its A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Motions demonſtrated to be the neceſſary Conſequences of its Structure. And as the Actions of the Body, from which Life and Health do flow, are the neceſſary Conſequences of its Oeconomy; ſo likewiſe Diſeaſes and all their Symptoms, are nothing but Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0185201300:19"/>or Diſorders in it. It de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtratively therefore follows, that the greater the Knowledge of the one is, the better the Nature of the other muſt be known; and that a Phyſician ignorant of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimal Oeconomy is ignorant of the Structure and Uſes of the Machine he undertakes to regulate. The Parts of Animated Bodies are aptly and uſefully divided into Solid and Fluid. Anatomy, or the Art of Diſſecting the ſolid Parts of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Bodies, in order to an exact Diſcovery of their Situation, Stru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture, Uſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as it is abſolutely neceſſary to the Knowledge of the Animal Oeconomy, ſo it has ever been juſtly eſteem'd one of the Foundation Pillars of Phyſick. Nor indeed of leſs Uſe is the Doctrine of the Fluids; under which Head I include a right Apprehenſion of the general and particular Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0185201300:20"/>of the Animal Fluids, and of their different Motions, Nature, Uſes, Offices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other things alſo included in the Knowledge of the Animal Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy (and ſome few of them I ſhall juſt mention) which tho' not ſtrictly referable to either Branch of the above-mention'd Diviſion of the Parts, are yet equally neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be underſtood; <hi>viz.</hi> the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Dependencies the Parts have on, and the different Relations they bear to each other; the Powers of Motion (both Voluntary and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary) and Senſation; the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Reaſon and Nature of Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the Velocity of the Blood's Circulation, with the Reaſon of its Differences at different Diſtances from the Heart; the Neceſſity of Breathing after Birth, with the Force of the Air upon the Blood in that Action, <hi>&amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> But an
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0185201300:21"/>exact Knowledge of the Animal Structure and Oeconomy, will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards appear more particularly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, as well to explicate the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Operation of Medicines, as to aſcertain the Diagnoſis, and comprehend the Aetiology of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. Another of the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> is Pharmacology; comprehending the Knowledge, 1. Of ſimple Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Medicines, whether of the Animal, Vegetable, or Mineral Kingdom. 2. Of the ſeveral Parts of Pharmacy, both Galenical and Chymical. 3. Of the general Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Virtues, and Operation of Medicines. For as a Man cannot be ſaid to underſtand an Art, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out underſtanding the Inſtruments as well as the Subject of that Art; ſo the Human Body being the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and Medicines the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0185201300:22"/>of this Art, the Knowledge of the one muſt conſequently be as neceſſary as the Knowledge of the other.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By the Knowledge of ſimple Natural Medicines, I here mean that of the Substances themſelves as well as of their Medicinal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and Efficacies. 'Twould be altogether needleſs to waſt any Time in inſiſting upon the Neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of underſtanding this part of Pharmacology: For as without knowing the Subſtances, a Man in his Practice muſt wholly confide in, or rely upon the Gatherers and Venders of Medicines; ſo indeed the Knowledge of their Virtues and Efficacies, without knowing the Subſtances themſelves, ſeems to me, if of any, of a very dangerous Uſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Pharmacy contains the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Preparing and the Method of making ſuch ſimple Subſtances into
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0185201300:23"/>Medicines, and conſiſts of ſeveral Parts, whether according to the Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenical or Chymical Forms. All the ſeveral Parts of Pharmacy, and of Chymiſtry in particular, <hi>viz.</hi> as it teaches the moſt Compendious and Efficacious Preparation of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, are, and have been ſo often demonſtrated to be ſo abſolutely neceſſary to be underſtood by all who deſign for the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, that as there is nothing in which Men ſeem more agreed than in the Neceſſity of underſtanding theſe things; ſo it would be but Loſs of Time to enlarge any further upon them. I ſhall therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude what I have to offer under this Head, with the following Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; That ſince it is ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily incumbent upon every one who pretends to the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, to underſtand all the Parts of Pharmacy, there can be no Obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0185201300:24"/>made upon that Account, I mean, againſt a Phyſician's prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his own Medicines, but either by ignorant or intereſted Men. But tho' this Obſervation is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to excuſe the Phyſicians for gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving their own Medicines (which indeed is only reſuming what their Anceſtors either out of Pride or La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zineſs left off) yet it does not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that there is any manner of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology to be made for the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries intruding themſelves into the Practice of Phyſick, as will more fully afterwards appear.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Under the third Branch of Pharmacology is compriz'd the Knowledge of the general Nature, Virtues and Operation of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. And as Natural Philoſophy was proved to be neceſſary towards forming a right Notion of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body, ſo 'twill be found as neceſſary towards comprehending
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0185201300:25"/>the general Nature, Virtues and O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of Medicines. For Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines being only natural Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, only Parts or Portions of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, 'tis evident, that their Powers and Properties are not only under the ſame common Laws and Rules which are obſerved in the other Parts of Matter, but are alſo to be explain'd in the ſame Methods; and therefore Medicines are not only Natural Subſtances, but they alſo operate in a Natural Way, [<hi>i. e.</hi> by different Kinds and Degrees of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion] ſuch Natural Subſtances loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing only their Denomination, and not their Natures, by being term'd or applied as Medicines. By a due Apprehenſion of theſe things, and without which it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for a Practitioner in Phyſick to be really uſeful or ſerviceable in his Generation, Men will know what Effects to expect, and be prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0185201300:26"/>from a credulous Expectation of Effects, which can in no wiſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from them in a natural Way. Medicines, notwithſtanding the <hi>Materia Medica</hi> is made up of ſo vaſt a Variety of Natural Subſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, may, in reſpect of their gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Virtues or Operation, be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd under ſuch as produce ſome Evacuation, or ſuch as only effect ſome Alteration in the Body. And not only Natural Philoſophy, but a due Knowledge alſo of the Animal Oeconomy is absolutely neceſſary towards framing a right Notion of theſe Things: For unleſs Men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Structure, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Uſes and Offices of the Parts of the Body, it is impoſſible for them to know how, or by what Organs, or in what Regions, Parts or Juices, Medicines perform their Operations.</p>
            <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0185201300:27"/>
            <p n="5">V. The fifth and laſt of the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſita,</hi> which I ſhall mention, is Noſology; containing whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to the General Nature, Signs, Cauſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Diſeaſes. For as the Conſideration of the Human Body, in its natural or healthful State, is, by Phyſicians, only in order to the Conſideration of it in its Praeternatural or Morbid one; ſo conſequently there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more previouſly neceſſary to the Practice of Phyſick than what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever relates to the Knowledge of the General Nature, Signs, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And firſt the Want of a clear Idea of the General Nature of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes muſt be a certain Means of laying a neceſſary and afterwards unalterable Foundation of Error and Miſcarriage in Practice. One would be tempted to think, from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0185201300:28"/>the erroneous Proceedings of unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent Practitioners, that Diſeaſes were really ſeparate Eſſences, (or I know not what ſubſtantial Forms) and as ſuch enter'd and poſſeſs'd the Bodies of Men. Whereas, by a due Conſideration of their Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, they will be found to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different or diſtinct from the Body, but only Changes or Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Modification of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent Parts, or different Modes of Indiſpoſition in the ſame Body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, the Doctrine of the Signs, both Diagnoſtick and Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſtick, is not leſs neceſſary to be throughly underſtood, before a Man undertakes the Practice of Phyſick, than the General Nature of Diſeaſes. For as by a due Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Diagnoſtick Signs, he may be inſtructed truly to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh one Diſeaſe, tho' never ſo much alike, from another; ſo
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0185201300:29"/>thro' want of that Knowledge, one Diſeaſe is very often miſtaken for and treated as another. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, for Inſtance, has a <hi>Colica</hi> and a <hi>Nephritis,</hi> a <hi>Fluor Albus</hi> and a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhaea,</hi> a <hi>Chloroſis</hi> and a <hi>Phthiſis</hi> been confounded? So that the Foundation of Cure ſeems prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to be laid in a right Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Diagnoſtick Signs of each Diſtemper. But here it ought to be obſerved, that the better a Man underſtands the Animal Structure and Oeconomy, the more capable he will be both of comprehending and aſcertaining the Diagnoſis, and that a Man ignorant of thoſe things muſt neceſſarily miſlead himſelf by the Uſe of a common Name, and apply it to denote Circumſtances which are ſo far from being always alike, that they will be ſometimes found extremely different.</p>
            <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0185201300:30"/>
            <p>And as to the Prognoſtick Signs of Diſeaſes; tho' it be certain that the Recovery of the Sick is the great Deſign of the Medical Art, and undoubtedly more neceſſary than Preſaging the Event of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, yet the Advances which have been made in the Prognoſtick Part of Medicine, as acquiring no ſmall Eſteem and Authority to the Phyſician, ought diligently to be collected from the Obſervations of the Ancients, particularly of the Divine <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> as well as from the Writings of the Moderns.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, the Aetiology of Diſeaſes; I mean more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as to the immediate and conjunct Cauſes, will be found as neceſſary to be known by every Practitioner, as either the General Nature of Diſeaſes, or the Doctrine of the Signs. For if, as is very evident in Practice, Diſeaſes even of the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0185201300:31"/>ſame Denomination, ariſing from different Cauſes, do adminiſter different Indications, or indicate different Methods of Cure; the Aetiology muſt conſequently be a grand Source from whence Ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Indications can be drawn. 'Twere very eaſie to give Inſtances in almoſt all the Diſeaſes incident to the Human Body, but thinking it altogether needleſs, becauſe the Medical Writings are ſo full of them, I ſhall conclude this Head with ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving, That as an exact Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Animal Structure and Oeconomy is abſolutely neceſſary to comprehend the Aetiology of Diſeaſes; ſo the Modern Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in Anatomy have very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably advanc'd the Aetiological Part of Medicine.</p>
            <p>Having thus, with the utmoſt Brevity demonſtrated, that there
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0185201300:32"/>are ſeveral things perfectly and abſolutely neceſſary to be known by Men before they ought to pretend to the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; my preſent Deſign does not at all oblige me to enquire whether I have enumerated all the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> to the Medical Art; but from that Enumeration of them which I have made, and from what I have advanc'd, under each of thoſe Heads, may very fairly venture to draw the following Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>I. That Experience alone will not make a Phyſician.</item>
               <item>II. That the Enumeration of the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> to the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Art is a ſufficient Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with what Difficulty, a due Qualification for the Practice of it is attain'd.</item>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0185201300:33"/>
               <item>III. That it is a plain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, how unqualified the Quacks are for exerciſing the Profeſſion they pretend to.</item>
               <item>IV. That it is an evident Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the rational Part of Mankind, who do, and who do not, and that the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part of the Practioners in Phyſick do come under the Denomination of Quacks.</item>
               <item>V. That an Apothecary can no more be ſaid to be Qualified for the Practice of Phyſick, than any other Mechanical Tradeſman.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">I. That Experience alone will not make a Phyſician: For if there are, as I have already proved, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things abſolutely neceſſary to be known by Men, before they can judge of the Nature of Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes or Remedies, which are what I
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0185201300:34"/>mean by the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> to the Medical Art: It evidently follows that Experience alone, <hi>i. e.</hi> Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience without the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> will not make a Phyſician. The Art of Phyſick then may very aptly and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully be ſaid to conſiſt two Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> The Theoretical and Practical. And as there is nothing truer on the one hand, than that the Theory, <hi>viz.</hi> the Knowledge of the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> is, as has been fully prov'd, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary to the Practice: ſo there is nothing more evident on the other, than that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Theory, tho' previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly neceſſary, is only in order to, and therefore uſeleſs without, the Practice. For tho' 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (I affirm) a Man ſhould make any conſiderable Figure in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, who is ignorant of the praeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary Arts which compoſe the Theory of Phyſick: And if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0185201300:35"/>the Knowledge of thoſe Arts, a Man jumps, as I may ſay, into Practice, ſuch a one is never to be truſted, tho' he had ſeen Thouſands of Patients, and ten thouſand Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions; yet do I not (as it is ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous to) ſuppoſe, that Men ſhould reſt here, or dwell upon the Theory; or that the ſpeculative Part of Phyſick ſhould teach them to cure all manner of Diſtempers in their Cloſets, without a conſtant Attendance on the Sick, without a diligent and unwearied Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on Diſeaſes. A due Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of theſe things may be a Means to determine the many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary Diſputes concerning the Preference of one Part of Phyſick to the other; the Knowledge of the one abſolutely depending on, and conſequently being altogether as neceſſary as that of the other. And as Theory and Practice, ſo
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0185201300:36"/>Reaſon and Obſervation ought not to be compar'd with, or oppos'd to, each other, but join'd together, as mutually adorning and illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting one another to the fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating of a Phyſician. A Man may be an Advocate for Experience, and well appriz'd of the Uſefulneſs of accurate Obſervations, and at the ſame time not diſcard the Uſe of Reaſon in Phyſick. True Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations will never be found to contradict Right Reaſon, nor will Right Reaſon exert it ſelf in, oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to matter of Fact. But leſt any of the Empirical Tribe ſhould pretend to take Shelter under Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities, or to interpret what <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glivi</hi> ſays concerning Experience and Obſervation in favour of themſelves, I've purpoſely read over all the Works of that celebrated Author, and from innumerable Paſſages in his Writings, think nothing more
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0185201300:37"/>evident, than that it is a Literate, and not an Empirical Experience, which he contends for. 'Tis not Experience without the <hi>Praerequiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta,</hi> but ſuch a well grounded Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience as a Man duly qualify'd for the Practice of Phyſick, may daily with Reaſon, be ſuppos'd to acquire. And 'tis as evident, that what he has advanc'd, concerning the Importance of Obſervation in the Way of Phyſick, ought to be interpreted in that very Senſe. For tho' he ſays, That nothing ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tends to the Improvement of Phyſick, as Experiments and Obſervations, yet 'tis certainly true, that he deſires it might be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood (as indeed it ought to be) of Experiments directed by the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Animal Oeconomy, and of Obſervations grounded on that and the other <hi>Praerequiſita.</hi> So notwithſtanding what Dr. <hi>Syden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>
               <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0185201300:38"/>declares, <hi>viz.</hi>

               <hi>Praxin eſſe Medicinae Profitentium Lapidem Lydium,</hi> 'tis evident from Paſſages enough in that worthy Author, particularly from the whole 81ſt Page of the laſt mention'd Treatiſe, that he never deſign'd, by what he ſays, to advance an Empirical Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, or to preclude the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of underſtanding the <hi>Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>requiſita.</hi> As there is nothing more ridiculous than to ſuppoſe all Men capable of making a good Uſe of Experience, or able to draw right Concluſions from the Motions of Nature; ſo Quacks and Empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricks, who ſet out without either
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0185201300:39"/>Light or Method muſt undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly prove ſtupid and erroneous Obſervators: It being indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that Men ignorant of the Medical <hi>Praerequiſita,</hi> ſhould be capable of improving either them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or the Art by their Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and Obſervations. What there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is daily ſaid in praiſe of Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience (to which no one pays a greater Deference than my ſelf) and in Recommendation of expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienc'd Phyſicians, ought to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood with ſuch a Reſtriction as not to include the Practitioners, who never had Opportunities of Underſtanding the <hi>Praerequiſita.</hi> How ridiculous then is the Folly of thoſe People who magnifie an Empirical Experience, or cry up a Quack of whatſoever Figure or Fame, for a Man of Experience, which wanting a Foundation, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be of any real Uſe and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0185201300:40"/>either to himſelf or others.</p>
            <p n="2">II. That the Enumeration of the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> to the Medical Art, is a ſufficient Argument with what Difficulty a due Qualification for The Practice of it is attain'd. For if it be ſo abſolutely neceſſary, as has been already prov'd, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> to that Art, 'tis very eaſie to infer, both what Length of Time and Labour of Thought the Acquiſition of ſo much Knowledge will require. 'Tis not then a Raw and Superficial Knowledge of Receipts and Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of Diſeaſes and their Cures, which will qualifie a Man for the Practice of Phyſick, but a gradual Advancement thro' all the above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd Foundations of the Art. 'Tis not to be ſuppos'd, that the <hi>Ars longiſſima</hi> ſhould be ſo quickly acquir'd, or the moſt difficult of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0185201300:41"/>Sciences ſo inſtantly attain'd. And this Truth is not only confirm'd by <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> in his very firſt Aphoriſm<note n="*" place="bottom">

Yet notwithſtanding what has been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, concerning the <hi>Praerequiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta</hi> to the Medical Art, and the Difficulty of acquiring the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them; it is very ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing to conſider what a vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Perſons there are, what would fain become Phyſicians without La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and Study, and be ſaluted Sons of <hi>Apollo,</hi> without any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0185201300:42"/>of Right to the Title. But all and every one of thoſe who are ignorant of the Preliminary Arts, which compoſe the Theory, are but Pretenders in Phyſick, do jump, as I ſaid, into Practice, and are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be truſted tho' they had ſeen thouſands of Patients, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Preſcriptions. But I now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, in the third Place, more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to conſider,</p>
            <p n="3">III. That the Enumeration of the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> to the Medical Art, is a plain Demonſtration how unqualified the Quacks are for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſing the Profeſſion they pretend to. And if, as has been prov'd, there are ſo many things abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to be known, before a Man can either reaſon or judge of Diſeaſes; it evidently follows, that a Quack, ignorant of thoſe things, is abſolutely unqualified for that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0185201300:43"/>Profeſſion. Were but the Matter indeed, as impartially conſider'd as it ought to be, there ſeems no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more ridiculous than to pretend to the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, without a previous Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of them; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but ſuch People muſt make either Improper, Dangerous and Deſtructive, or Inſignificant and Uſeleſs Applications. It is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly true in Fact, that the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous often prove the moſt dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Medicines, if adminiſtred with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Judgment; but it is an every day's Obſervation, that thoſe very things which have the Reputation of being harmleſs and inoffenſive, if improperly applied, do too often create very great Miſchiefs. In the Practice of Phyſick there is requir'd not only great Labour of Thought, in ſearching into the ſeveral Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances and Circumſtances of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0185201300:44"/>Diſeaſes, but alſo great Strength of Judgment in duly weighing and comparing them together. And it is not here, as in many other Caſes, where Experiments may be repeated without any great Injury; for this perhaps admits but of one ſingle Tryal, which poſſibly may terminate in the Death of a Man, and one falſe Step, eſpecially in an acute Diſeaſe, may be of the moſt fatal Conſequence. Phyſick, 'tis true, abounds with a very large Number of excellent Medicines: But Medicines, being Relations to Human Bodies, can only be ſaid to be good or bad, as applied; and like all other Inſtruments to do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Good or Hurt, according to the Nature of the Hand which u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes them. As there is nothing more conſpicuous on the one hand, than the uſeful Effects of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, when Methodically and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0185201300:45"/>diciouſly adminiſtred: So there is nothing more obvious on the other, than the deadly Effects even of thoſe of the very firſt Rank, when us'd, without either Method or Judgment. Can any thing then more fully demonſtrate the Vanity of Empiriciſm than the daily Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience how Inefficacious and Uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, even the moſt celebrated Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cificks are without a Judicious and Methodical Application? For tho' a more Noble Specifick than the <hi>Cortex,</hi> for Inſtance, was never known, yet Experience convinces us how frequently we are forced even in intermitting Fevers, to call in to our Aſſiſtance, the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Animal Oeconomy; and by Vomiting, Purging, or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper Means, to render that Specifick uſeful, which would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe have been of no Effect: So that nothing ſeems more ridiculous
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0185201300:46"/>than for a Man to pretend to cure Diſeaſes, tho' arm'd with the beſt of Medicines, without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Animal Oeconomy, and the Noſological <hi>Praerequiſita.</hi> It may as well be expected that a blind Man ſhould ſhoot flying, or a deaf one tune an Organ.</p>
            <p>I cannot therefore conclude this Head without obſerving (which indeed naturally flows from the foregoing Conſiderations) how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountably infatuated they are, who apply themſelves to any of the Empirical Tribe; there being no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo monſtrous as their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; nothing, but the no leſs mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous Credulity of thoſe who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy them. But,</p>
            <q>Quos perdere vult Jupiter, prius dementat.</q>
            <p>Does any one Man more deſerve
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0185201300:47"/>to be ridicul'd, than he, who thinks his Gold Watch of too great Value to be put into the Hands of an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Workman, and at the ſame time, truſts his Body, a Machine of infinitely more curious Structure, with an ignorant Pretender in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick. Can a Man put a greater Affront upon his Reaſon? Or can he give an odder Demonſtration of his Kindneſs to Wife, Children or Friends, than to commit any of them to the Care of ſuch unequal Managers? In Matters of far leſs Moment, Men generally are more guided by the Dictates of Reaſon, and not ſo eaſily impos'd upon by any kind of empty Pretenſions. If the Title of an Eſtate, wherein they are concern'd, be never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſuſpected, they immediately ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the Beſt Advice, and will ſpare neither Coſt nor Pains for a Right Information; but which is
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0185201300:48"/>the moſt unaccountable Piece of Folly imaginable, are extremely leſs ſollicitous about the Care of their Bodies than their Eſtates.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. That the Enumeration of the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> to the Medical Art, is an evident Indication to the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Part of Mankind, who do, and who do not, and that the far greateſt Part of the Practitioners in Phyſick do come under the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of Quacks: I appeal to the Rational Part of Mankind, becauſe they are the fitteſt Judges in the Matter; for as they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of diſtinguiſhing who have, and who have not, had Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of underſtanding the <hi>Praerequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſita;</hi> ſo they cannot but at the ſame time be convinc'd, that the far greateſt Part of the Practitioners in Phyſick, come under the Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Quacks. There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0185201300:49"/>more Evident than that there are Pretenders in Phyſick, who are ſo far from having any Knowledge of the learned Languages, that they cannot write their own; are ſo far from having made any Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es into the vaſt Collection of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Learning, that they never perus'd even the Obſervations of the Moderns; are ſo far from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding Natural Philoſophy or the Animal Oeconomy, that they never had Opportunities of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Anatomy or Chymiſtry; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſaw a Diſſection, or one Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Preparation of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. What a melancholy Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection then is it, that ſuch a Trade of deceiving ſhould be carried on under the Pretences to ſo uſeful an Art; and to conſider, what a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of People there are who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no other Foundation but Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence and Ignorance, bubble ſo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0185201300:50"/>many Thouſands out of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and Lives?</p>
            <p n="5">V. That an Apothecary can no more be ſaid to be Qualified for the Practice of Phyſick than any other Mechanical Tradeſman. Tho' the Preparation of Medicines, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Preſcript is properly ſpeaking the Buſineſs of an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary, and which Preparation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires only the Knowledge of the Subſtances themſelves, and not of their Medicinal Virtues and Effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacies; yet let us ſuppoſe an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary endued with that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge alſo, and let us conſider how far it will qualify him for the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Phyſick. We will then ſuppoſe him to know that this Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine will purge; this, vomit; and this produce other Evacuations, or perhaps only Alterations in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. But as to know what is Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0185201300:51"/>is one thing, and how to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer ſuch an Indication another; ſo the Knowledge of the Virtues and Efficacies of Medicines will not at all inſtruct or direct him in the Application of them. For Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines being Relations to Human Bodies, can be only good or bad, as juſtly or unjuſtly applied: And therefore, as I inſtanc'd, tho' we ſuppoſe a Man to know that ſuch a Medicine will undoubtedly Purge, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſollicit the Bowels into that Motion we call ſo; yet whether this will be to the Advantage of the Perſon to whom it is given, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not on the Man's Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Medicine's Operation, but on the Fitneſs and Diſpoſition of the Patients Body to receive it. Again, a Man may know, that there are ſome Preparations of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which will always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Vomiting. But tho' by the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0185201300:52"/>Exhibition of a Vomit, a Vitiated Stomach is ſometimes reſtor'd; yet when the Stomach is deprav'd from a Cauſe which cannot be removed by Vomiting, 'tis plain, that the Uſe of ſuch Medicines cannot poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly effect its Recovery. And a great many more Inſtances might be given in reſpect to the Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Medicines, which only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ſome Alteration in the Body. The Excellency then of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Art conſiſts in a right Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the Relation between the Powers of the Medicine, and the Circumſtances of the Diſeaſe. Now ſuch a right Apprehenſion of this Relation, as is ſufficient to qualify a Man for the Practice of Phyſick, cannot poſſibly be acquird by the Knowledge of Medicines, their Preparation and Virtues; but of all the abovemention'd <hi>Praere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſita</hi> to the Art. And this ſingle
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0185201300:53"/>Conſideration of the Relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Medicine and the Body, as it diſtinguiſhes a Regular from an Empirical Practice; ſo it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently expoſes the Vanity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiding in Receipts or <hi>Noſtrums,</hi> and plainly demonſtrates that the moſt celebrated Preparations (even of the Philoſophers by Fire) are not capable of curing Diſeaſes, without a Judicious and Methodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Application, and that there can be nothing conſequently more ridiculous than to ſuppoſe an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary capable of adviſing from ſeeing the Preſcripts of Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. If then the Knowledge of the Preparation of Medicines, if the Knowledge of their Virtues, and Efficacies, nay, if ſeeing the very Preſcripts of Phyſicians, will not amount to a Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; it demonſtratively follows that an Apothecary can no more
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0185201300:54"/>be ſaid to be Qualified far the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of Phyſick, having no other Means or Opportunities of acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring The reſt of the <hi>Praerequiſita,</hi> than any other Mechanical Tradeſ-man. That ſmall Pittance of Learning which is acquird at School, if not afterwards loſt in the ſervile Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Shop, can claim no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Conſideration: No; the Prolix and Laborious Study of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, ought aſſuredly to commence upon a more Literate Foundation; and the Knowledge of it is not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly attainable, but by an Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a quite different Nature.</p>
            <p>Twill be very pertinent to my preſent Deſign, and not unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my Reader, I hope, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him, how the Apothecaries firſt crept into Houſes, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd themſelves into the Practice of Phyſick. Their officious Viſits were at firſt made under Pretence
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0185201300:55"/>of carrying the Phyſick themſelves, which indeed might procure them the Reputation of careful Men, tho by running on the Errands tis plain they chang'd Offices, with their Servants, and left them at home to do the Duty of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. This gave them Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of inſinuating themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Nurſes, Servants, and, other weak Perſons attending the Sick; and by their Means of being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to give their Opinions; and thence under Pretence of good Husbandry for the Patient, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat the Phyſicians Bills, without his Order; and at laſt to preſcribe without his Advice. Yet I am not, I muſt confeſs, for wholly laying aſide this Order of Men, they being, in my Opinion very uſeful and ſerviceable in their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Station and Buſineſs, which is the Preparation of Medicines ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0185201300:56"/>to the Preſcript of the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician. But when an Apothecary deſerts his Station in the Shop, neglects the Buſineſs of his Trade, and runs about adviſing in all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers; he becomes an Empi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick, and invades a Profeſſion which he cannot be ſuppos'd to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. Can any thing be more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoniſhing than the levelling of a Learned Liberal Science, with a Mechanick Trade of the Hand di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by that Science? I could wiſh the Fool's Character had been preſerved in our Chronicles, or that his Features were now to be ſeen in his Statue of Braſs, who firſt ſent for the Handy-craft La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer of the Medicines to anſwer any Queſtions concerning the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>There is certainly no more Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between the Buſineſs of an Apothecary, and that of a Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0185201300:57"/>than between the Grinding of Colours and the Art of Painting: And therefore an Apothecary, who, without Knowledge of the <hi>Praere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſita,</hi> pretends to the Practice of Phyſick, is altogether as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous as a Colour-grinder, who, without any Skill in Drawing, ſhould preſume to manage a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil The one may hear the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients examin'd, make up the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines himſelf, and obſerve their Effects; the other may ſee the firſt Stroaks chalk'd out, prepare the Colours himſelf, and afterwards ſee his Maſter at Work; yet nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of them, without being firſt inſtructed in the various Rules as well as firſt Rudiments of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpective Arts, ſhall enter into the Skill of either the Phyſician or Painter, tho' they look'd on them till Dooms-day. What Pity 'tis the Imitations of both cannot be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0185201300:58"/>expos'd to view, that the unskilful Management of the one might be as conſpicuous as would be the ridiculous dawbing of the other.</p>
            <p>There is alſo another Body of Men, I mean the Surgeons, who notoriouſly enough (tho' not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſo frequently in great Towns as the Apothecaries) invade the Profeſſion of Phyſick. But as the Rules above-mention'd are ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to diſtinguiſh an Empirical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender from a Qualified Practitio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; ſo by the Application of thoſe Rules to the Surgeons, 'tis very ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily demonſtrable, that they cannot but come under the Denomination of Quacks in Phyſick.</p>
            <p>Tho from what has been alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy advanc'd, both concerning the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> and the Concluſions which have been drawn from the Enumeration of them, it may ſeem
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0185201300:59"/>altogether needleſs; yet I ſhall now proceed to offer three or four Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons more, which will further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate the Neceſſity of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation in Phyſick: And thoſe may be ſaid to regard,
<list>
                  <item>I. The Good of the Publick in General.</item>
                  <item>II. The Univerſities in Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</item>
                  <item>III. The Art of Phyſick it ſelf.</item>
                  <item>IV. The Regular Profeſſors of it.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. The firſt Reaſon then for the Neceſſity of ſuch a Regulation (concerns the Good of the Publick and) is the Loſs of her Majeſties Subjects. And if I affirm that the Encouragement of Quacks tends as much to the diſpeopling of the Kingdom as the Wars; The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation muſt be allow'd to be mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0185201300:60"/>provided they, kill as many in other Parts of the Kingdom as they do in thoſe within the Sphere of my own Obſervation. But the Truth of this Aſſertion will more evidently appear to any one who does but fairly conſider the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Quacks with which every Corner of this Kingdom has the Misfortune to abound. For what but the moſt diſmal Execution up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lives, or the moſt dreadful Deſtruction of Mankind, can be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from ſuch a Prodigious Number of Men, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding not what they profeſs; may truly be ſaid to be Qualified, as they are Licenc'd, to kill. And tho' the moſt horrid Slaughters are daily committed without any Fear of Puniſhment or Reproof; yet 'tis not a more melancholy Reflection to conſider what a vaſt Number of Men fall by the Hands of theſe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0185201300:61"/>Executioners, than that the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners themſelves ſhould eſcape the Hands of Publick Juſtice. I am not able to expreſs my Indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation againſt ſuch preſumptuous Homicides: They ought to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpated, if not at once, yet by Degrees, as the Wolves out of the Kingdom.</p>
            <p>But to return; I hope to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd (for whoſoever is well appriz'd of her Powers may be pardon'd) for aſſerting, That it is better truſting to Nature than to an ignorant Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender in Phyſick. That Phyſicians are only Servants to Nature, and that ſhe is <hi>Morborum Medicatrix,</hi> are Truths known to the Ancients, and confirmd by the irrefragable Experience of the Moderns. And as Nature alone will conquer ſome Diſeaſes, and judiciouſly aſſiſted the greateſt part; ſo nothing is a brighter Demonſtration of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0185201300:62"/>Greatneſs of her Strength, than that even the Miſmanagement of Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Apothecaries and other Quacks, is not able to hinder the Recovery of very large Numbers, which fall under their Hands. The greateſt part of the Symptoms of Diſeaſes are the Efforts of Nature, but which Efforts being eaſily diſturb'd, or ſoon oppos'd, require the moſt ſtrict and wary Obſervance, and without Judgment, we may ſooner injure than aſſiſt her; ſooner op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs than relieve her. A Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an ought therefore religiouſly to obſerve and obey the Motions of Nature, to look upon them as his ſureſt Guides in the Cure of any Diſtemper, and to be advis'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to them, what to do, and when, and in what manner to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed. The Art of Phyſick is not underſtood till the Artiſt compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends, in the Words of my Lord
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0185201300:63"/>
               <hi>Bacon, Quid Natura ferat, &amp; faciat.</hi> But if the Calamities of the Sick are encreas'd by the very Means which are uſed for their Relief; if inſtead of carefully aſſiſting Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in her Progreſſes to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Life, ſhe be clogg'd with uſeleſs and inſignificant, or oppreſs'd with dangerous and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Applications: I may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conclude the Condition of thoſe People who have the Misfortune to fall under ſuch Hands, to be indeed a very deplorable one; and the Loſs of her Majeſties Subjects, from the fatal Miſmanagement of ſo vaſt a Number of Quacks, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently ſo very great, that the Encouragement of them may truly be ſaid to tend as much to the diſpeopling of the Kingdom as the Wars.</p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:0185201300:64"/>
            <p n="2">II. Another Argument for the Neceſſity of a Regulation in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, is, that the Encouragement of Empiriciſm has already been a very great, and will hereafter be a far greater Detriment to the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſities: For it can never be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, that Men will be at the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of ſending their Sons to any of the Seminaries of Good Litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ingenuous Education, when the Honours and Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of a Faculty may be obtain'd without it, and there is ſo little Diſtinction made between a Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and an <hi>extempore</hi> Doctor. The Apothecaries, and other Quacks, now openly avow their Reſolutions of ſeizing on the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; and of excluding in time all the Univerſity Phyſicians. They give not only Examples, but alſo Aſſurances of Succeſs to all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0185201300:65"/>into Divinity, and others, of the pretended Education in the Liberal Sciences. It would indeed be no great Matter of Wonder or Complaint, were Empiricks encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged only by the Ordinary Sort of People; or as the <hi>French</hi> call them, the <hi>Petits Gens;</hi> there being, as I have often obſerv'd, a Sort of Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy between Underſtandings. But 'tis very unaccountably ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing, and a juſt Matter of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that any of the diſtinguiſh'd Part of Mankind ſhould venture e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in dangerous Caſes to employ ſuch illiterate, and conſequently ignorant Pretenders. And what ſtill enhances my Amazement is, that any of thoſe Gentlemen, and eſpecially any of the Clergy, who have had the Happineſs of an Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity Education; ſhould give any manner of Encouragement to this ſort of People. They have all laid
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0185201300:66"/>themſelves under the higheſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations of Preſerving the Honour and Dignity of thoſe Fountains of Learning. And the Phyſicians of the Soul in particular being obliged to viſit their Pariſhioners in Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ought not only to inform them that it is their Duty, but to preſs them alſo to apply to the Phyſicians of the Body, whom the Divine Laws<note n="*" place="bottom">Eccleſiaſt. 38. 1-12.</note> as well as our own have appointed; inſtead of either making uſe of Empiricks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or adviſing others to make uſe of them. I can never ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deplore theſe Indignities offer'd to our Univerſities, nor ever e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough blame and condemn the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bettors and Promoters of them; but am not without Hopes that ſuch growing Miſchiefs as theſe are,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0185201300:67"/>will ſometime be thought worthy the Conſideration of thoſe in whom alone is lodg'd the Power of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. Another Argument for the Neceſſity of a Regulation in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, regards the Art it ſelf; the Encouragement of Quacks and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricks threatning the Ruin of the Profeſſion as well as of the People. 'Twould be no very difficult Task to demonſtrate the Certainty of the Medical Principles, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the real Uſefulneſs of Phyſick to Mankind. But ſuch an Attempt does not at all ſeem neceſſary in my preſent Deſign; becauſe 'tis not to be ſuppos'd, that Perſons ſhould apply themſelves even to the moſt ignorant Pretenders in Phyſick, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſuch Perſons really thought they ſhould receive ſome Benefit from the Directions of thoſe to whom they
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0185201300:68"/>did apply. Yet notwithſtanding Phyſick is undoubtedly eſtabliſh'd upon ſuch Principles as do wholly free it from thoſe Reproaches of Uncertainty which it has often, tho' falſly, been charg'd with; it muſt, at the ſame time, be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd, that the Malignity of ſome Acute, and the Stubbornneſs of ſome Chronical Diſeaſes, do often elude all the Aſſiſtances of Human Art: For the moſt judicious and the moſt experienc'd Phyſicians can have no Power, as the Wiſe Man expreſſes it, in the Day of Death. But this can be no manner of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the Certainty of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Principles, becauſe it may happen and not proceed from any Defect in the Rules of the Art it ſelf. For from a due Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Materials which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a human Body, the Elegancy of its Structure, and the continued
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0185201300:69"/>Flux of its Parts, 'tis very evident that it muſt neceſſarily be obnoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to Diſorders, which are Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; and ſooner or later as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to a Diſſolution, which is Death. So that whoever is well appriz'd of the wonderful Fabrick of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body, how curiouſly contriv'd and divinely faſhion'd a Machine it is, may conſequently be rather amaz'd at our living ſo long, than at our dying ſo ſoon. But tho' it muſt be acknowledg'd that it is not in the Phyſician's Power at all times, or in all Extremities, to retrieve or preſerve his Patients from the Jaws of Death, (ſince to die is an Entail upon our Natures) yet it may with Modeſty be affirm'd, Experience abundantly proving it, that there is ſo much Power in Medicines, and ſo much Virtue in Methods, as to enable him, if he but heedfully weighs and judiciouſly applies them,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0185201300:70"/>to give Eaſe to ſuch as are in Pain, Sleep to ſuch as are wearied out with Watching, and Strength to withſtand the Approaches of grim and dreaded Death. But a Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician cannot, I ſay, be ſuppos'd capable of doing theſe things with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a due Conſideration of Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and a Judicious Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Medicines. For if Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are promiſcuouſly us'd in all Conſtitutions, or without Regard to the Circumſtances of each Caſe, 'tis no Wonder they ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Men in their Expectations of Succeſs. And therefore as the Knowledge pf the <hi>Praerequiſita</hi> is the only Means of Qualifying a Man for a ſucceſsful Practice in Phyſick, and conſequently of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing the Credit and Reputation of the Art; ſo the Ignorance of Quacks, both of the Nature, Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and Cure of Diſeaſes, muſt
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0185201300:71"/>neceſſarily produce ſo many and ſo groſs Miſmanagements as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but extremely prejudice Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in their Opinion of the Art. Their ill Succeſſes are doubtleſs imputed to the Uncertainty of the Art it ſelf, eſpecially by the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinguiſhing, which is much the larger Part of Mankind; and Men from their leſſen'd Opinion of it, will by Degrees neglect to apply to any Advice at all; whereas the truly Noble and Divine Art it ſelf ought by no Means to be charg'd with what is only to be imputed to the Ignorance of thoſe who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to profeſs it.</p>
            <p>Beſides, 'tis a true and general Obſervation, that Arts and Sciences do improve and grow uſeful, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Encouragement of thoſe who profeſs them. But the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Application to Quacks and Empiricks, by Men of all Ranks
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0185201300:72"/>and Degrees, even to the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted Stations, is ſo publick and ſo vaſt a Diſcouragement to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Phyſick, that it may truly be ſaid to threaten the very Ruin and Deſtruction of the Art it ſelf. For as ſuch a Diſcouragement muſt neceſſarily leſſen the Number of the Profeſſors in Phyſick; ſo it will conſequently obſtruct the glorious Progreſs of the Art, by hindring further Inventions, and future Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in it. And how inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable the illiterate Pretenders in Phyſick are of improving either themſelves or the Art, has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready demonſtrated. We may then very fairly ſuppoſe there will be but few Students in Phyſick, if after all the Labour and Pains of Acquiring that Knowledge, and after all the Expences of a Learned Education; their Bread ſhall be taken off their Trenchers, as we ſay, by every Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0185201300:73"/>Pretender. What a moſt ingenious Author obſerves upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Occaſion is very applicable to this. If we conſider, ſays he, the Expenſiveneſs of the Voyage, which is made in ſearch of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, 'tis very hard the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers ſhould be plunder'd of what they bring home by Privateers; under the very Canon which ſhould protect them. All which Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations are ſufficient to ſhew, how far the Encouragement of Quacks and Empiricks obſtructs the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of that glorious Art which teaches the Recovery as well as the Preſervation of Health; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently threatens the Ruin of the Profeſſion as well as the People.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The fourth and laſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which I ſhall offer for the Neceſſity of a Regulation in the Practice of Phyſick, regards the
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0185201300:74"/>Phyſicians themſelves, <hi>viz.</hi> That no Profeſſion is ſo invaded with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualify'd Pretenders, as theirs. I do not doubt, but 'twill evidently appear, that ſuch an Invaſion is ſingular to the Profeſſion of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, notwithſtanding what ſome have endeavour'd, tho' without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Colour of Reaſon, to maintain. 'Tis well known that Divinity and Law have their Paliſadoes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trenchements; for who dare pretend in their Pulpits or Courts, but thoſe who are fairly initiated ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Form and Cuſtom? Whereas the Cobweb Fences of Phyſick are every Day invaded, any broken Weaver, Taylor, Shoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, or merry Andrew, dub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing himſelf a Doctor <hi>Extempore,</hi> and ſetting up for a AESCULAPIUS. So that Quacking and Ale-keeping are now a days become the laſt Employments, to which Men of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0185201300:75"/>decay'd Fortunes apply themſelves to get Bread. And as none but thoſe who are fairly Initiated or Admitted do preſume upon the Profeſſions either of Divinity or Law; ſo there is but one way of Initiating or Admitting Perſons into the Exerciſe of them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as on the other ſide, Men are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to practiſe Phyſick by the moſt Unreaſonable, and as they are at preſent manag'd, I may with Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, I hope, venture to ſay, ſcandalous Methods; I mean by Licences out of the Eccleſiaſtical Courts. But that the Hardſhip of the Phyſicians Caſe may be ſet in the cleareſt Light, 'twill be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to enquire into the original End and Deſign, as well as pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Management of ſuch Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Licences: I am well enough ſatisfy'd that their original End and Deſign was very good and laudable.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0185201300:76"/>The Statute of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 3.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Pulton</hi>'s Statutes.</note> very pathetically expreſſes the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies enſuing by Ignorant Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons practiſing Phyſick, to the high Diſpleaſure of God, great Infamy to the Faculty, and the grievous Hurt, Damage, and Deſtruction of his Majeſties liege Subjects. For all which Reaſons it enacts that the Biſhop of each Dioceſe, or his Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>car-General, be empower'd to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine all thoſe (except Graduates) who ſhall practice Phyſick in that Dioceſe. But the Wiſdom of the ſame Statute is no leſs remarkable in obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging either of them to call to him ſuch expert Perſons in the ſaid Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, as his Diſcretion ſhall think fit. For I hope, I may venture to declare my Opinion thus far, that I cannot but think the Gentlemen of thoſe Courts very unfit Judges
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0185201300:77"/>of a Man's Capacity to practice Phyſick. And therefore in 14 and 15 of <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. 5. it is ſtill, I think, more prudentially enacted, That none ſhall practice in the Country, without a Teſtimonial of his Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency from the Preſident of the College of Phyſicians, and three of the Electors. I ſhall not here pretend to determine how far this poſterior may be ſaid to abrogate or null the prior Act. But the very End and Deſign of theſe Eccleſiaſtical Licences, <hi>viz.</hi> Prevention of the Inconveniences enſuing by Ignorant Perſons practiſing Phyſick, is not only, as they are manag'd at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, wholly fruſtrated, but entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perverted: For they are now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days ſo far from preventing, that they are the only Means of bringing thoſe Miſchiefs and Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies upon us, which the Statute mentions, by admitting ſuch Shoals
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0185201300:78"/>of unqualified Perſons to practice Phyſick. That the Examination previous to Admiſſion was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrict and ſevere, is as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain as that now a days Perſons are admitted without any manner of Examination at all. Nay, ſo far is the Practice of theſe Courts cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, and the very End and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of theſe Licences perverted, that they are now a days granted e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven from a Teſtimonial of two Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiates. Can any thing then be more evidently apparent than the Neceſſity of regulating theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters? For tho' (as I before obſerv'd) the firſt End and Deſign of theſe Licences was undoubtedly Good and Laudable, and tho' they were not Injurious (and I am apt to think they were not originally deſign'd to be or indeed really were) to the Regular Phyſicians; yet if the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Law ceaſes, the Law
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0185201300:79"/>it ſelf ought to be annull'd. But ſince the Method of Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſo very much alter'd; the Original End and Deſign of theſe Licences, ſo manifeſtly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, and they themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſo vaſtly Injurious both to the Faculty, and the Regular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Phyſick; theſe very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations are ſo many Arguments <hi>a fortiori</hi> for the Neceſſity of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation. And now I appeal to the ſenſible Part of Mankin, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Profeſſion be ſo invaded with unqualified Pretenders as Phyſick; and conſequently whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Phyſicians have not the greateſt Reaſon in the World to complain. And to whom ſhould they complain, but to the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? For doubtleſs, it was one of the Ends of Parliamentary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution to receive the Complaints, and redreſs the Grievances of the
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0185201300:80"/>Injur'd. Nay, do we not find the Legiſlature frequently interpoſing in other Profeſſions to prevent or remove Grievances; but what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard has there been to the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>normous ones in Phyſick? Are not our Lives worthy the Care of the Laws, as well as our Souls or Eſtates?</p>
            <p>I ſhall now endeavour to obviate ſome Objections which are general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made, tho' indeed without any Shadow of Reaſon, againſt what I have advanc'd. And it has been objected in the firſt Place, that ſuch a Regulation would be an Abridg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Natural Rights and Liberties of Mankind, to follow thoſe Employments whereby they may get a Livelihood. I ſhould be the moſt unwilling Man in the World to advance any thing which has the leaſt Tendency to ſuch an Abridgment. No, I have the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0185201300:81"/>Regard to their Civil as well as religious Properties. But this Objection would equally hold a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Suppreſſion of Gaming and other diſorderly Houſes, of the <hi>Royal Oak,</hi> and other ſuch publick Nuſances. For if the Good of the Publick ought not to be conſider'd and prefer'd to that of private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which I take to be an undenia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Maxim in all Governments; the Natural Liberties of Mankind may as properly be ſaid to be abridg'd by ſuch a Suppreſſion, as by ſuch a Regulation as I contend for. The ſame Anſwer will ſerve to ſome other Objections, which are much of the ſame Nature, and of no greater Force than the former, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Legiſlature is under no manner of Obligation to concern it ſelf in Miſchiefs which Men vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily pull upon themſelves; That all flouriſhing Governments
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0185201300:82"/>will encourage their People ſome Way or other to employ them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; That every Man is <hi>ſui Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> and has a natural Right of making Uſe of any Body he pleaſes, and if he be ſatisfy'd with the Riſque he runs, what has any one to ſay in contradiction to his Humour.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to invalidate ſome Excuſes which are frequently made in Extenuation of thoſe Practices which I have been condemning. And a great many People I am apt to believe, will think to clear them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the Imputation of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Quacks and Empiricks, by ſaying, That it is only in the Beginning of Diſeaſes they apply to them; That in Caſes of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, they generally have Recourſe to better Advice; and, That this Cuſtom being ſo very common, does not ſeem to need any manner
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0185201300:83"/>of Excuſe: But upon a ſtricter En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into this Matter, the Cuſtom of firſt ſending for an Apothecary or other Quack, will not, I am apt to think, appear the leſs ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, for being ſo frequent. For, as the Beginning of a Diſtemper is a very ſeaſonable Opportunity of Aſſiſting Nature, towards the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Health, ſo the Conduct of thoſe People cannot be ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemn'd, who neglect to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove that Opportunity, by not then calling in a judicious Aſſiſtant. But far more egregious is the Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of thoſe who then apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to any of the Empirical Tribe; it being impoſſible, as has been obſerv'd, but ſuch Perſons muſt make either inſignificant and uſeleſs, or dangerous and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive Applications. And as the Conſideration of neglecting the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of this Opportunity
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0185201300:84"/>ſufficiently condemns the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe who are call'd ſafe Men; who, as they ſay themſelves, will do no Hurt if they do no Good; ſo the preſumptuous Tamperers, on the other Side, may not only ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reparably injure the Patient, but ſo quite change the Face of a Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, as to render it very difficult, if poſſible, for even a judicious Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian, when call'd in, to diſcover its Nature. But when a Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an has the Care of a Diſeaſe from the Beginning, he is able to make right Obſervations of the Progreſs and Alteration of its Symptoms; and conſequently, not only to form a ſurer Prognoſtication of its Event, but more effectually to aſſiſt Nature in the Preſervation of Life.</p>
            <p>Again, there are others who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to excuſe themſelves for not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying to the beſt Advice upon the Account of ſaving Charges; tho' this
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0185201300:85"/>Conſideration can be of no manner of Force, unleſs it can be thought an Excuſe to have the Chance of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing kill'd cheap. But would thoſe very People, who ſatisfy themſelves with the Advice of an Empirical Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender, but uſe their Arithmetick, they would ſoon be convinc'd, they acted as much againſt their Intereſt as Reaſon. For by phyſicking the Symptoms, and neglecting the Cauſe of a Diſeaſe, the Length of the Bill, as well as the Diſtemper, muſt be conſequently encreas'd. 'Tis not the colluſive Pretence of giving Advice without a Fee, which can or ought to be eſteem'd an Equivalent.</p>
            <p>There are ſome again who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to excuſe themſelves by plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that thoſe to whom they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, are Maſters of ſome magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied Receipt, or pretended infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Remedy for this or that Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <pb n="79" facs="tcp:0185201300:86"/>
            <p>But the Vanity of confiding in ſuch Trifles has been ſufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd by the plaineſt Demonſtration, That the moſt celebrated Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions even of the Philoſophers by Fire are not capable of curing Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, without a Judicious and Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodical Application. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only ſubjoin another Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, which is an unanſwerable Argument of their Inſufficiency, <hi>viz.</hi> That none of theſe magnified Receipts or infallible <hi>Noſtrums</hi> have ever ſtood the Teſt of an Age. Accordingly, our very own Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is ſo far from confirming, that it daily contradicts the Pretended Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues which the Alchymical Writers, and the publick Venders of Quack Medicines, with a peremptory Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance aſcribe to them.</p>
            <p>'Tis urg'd again, that tho' it muſt be confeſs'd, that very eaſily cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Diſeaſes are often made fatal
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0185201300:87"/>by Quacks; yet 'tis equally true, that ſeveral Perſons recover under their Hands. To this I anſwer, That they recover, 'tis true, when the Patients have more of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Vigour than the others are able to deſtroy, and rather to the Strength of Nature is the happy E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent to be aſcrib'd, than to the Judgment of the Medicinal Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrator; ſuch Particular Caſes being no more Arguments of their Skill than a blind Man's throwing Stones, and hitting ſome People in a Crowd is an Argument of the Goodneſs of his Aim.</p>
            <p>Having thus fairly and impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially repreſented the preſent State of Phyſick in this Kingdom, plainly indicated the Number of Quacks, with which it is ſo unhappy as to abound; and fully demonſtrated not only the Impoſſibility of their being ſerviceable, but the abſolute
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0185201300:88"/>Neceſſity of their being injurious to it, in the Exerciſe of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion they pretend to: I think no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more conſequentially evident than the Neceſſity of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation in the Practice of Phyſick. And I am not without Hopes, that ſome of the above-mention'd Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, <hi>viz.</hi> The Good of her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Subjects in General; The Honour and Advantages of Her Univerſities in particular; The Life and Reputation of ſo uſeful an Art as Phyſick; or the Particular Hardſhips, which the Gentlemen of that Faculty have the Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to labour under; I am not without Hopes, I ſay, that ſome of theſe Reaſons will ſo far influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence our Legiſlators, as to prevail with them to take the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Caſe into their imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Conſideration: It is a Caſe undoubtedly, of the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0185201300:89"/>and Importance; for as the Life and Health of every individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Subject, ſo conſequently all Ranks and Qualities, all Parties and Diſtinctions of Men are in the higheſt Degree, and equally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd in it. And as the great Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the Debate makes it not unworthy the Cognizance and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry of our Legiſlators; ſo the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Nature of it ſeems more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to recommend it ſelf to their Conſideration. For 'tis certainly a great Shame, as well as an Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, that in a Kingdom where ſo many good Laws are in Force, and in which as much Care is taken of the Liberties and Properties of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, as in any Nation upon Earth, the People ſhould lie open and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded in their deareſt and moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Enjoyments, Health and Life. There is nothing, therefore, which in my Opinion ſeems more plainly
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0185201300:90"/>to demonſtrate a Deficiency in our Laws, than the Want of ſome to Regulate the groſs Miſcarriages and enormous Abuſes in the Practice of Phyſick. The College of Phyſicians, 'tis true, is veſted with ſome Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Authority; But as their Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority is confin'd to certain Limits; ſo, through Want of an Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Charter, it is not at preſent of that Uſe as ſeems corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondent to the Deſign of its Royal Inſtitution: But either by enlarging the Charter to the Colledge of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians, or by ſuch Ways and Means as the Wiſdom of our Legiſlature ſhall better approve of; there ſeems nothing more feaſible than to make a ſufficient Proviſion againſt theſe pernicious and deſtructive Practices. And whenever it ſhall ſeem expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to thoſe who ſit at the Helm of our excellent Government, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake ſo uſeful and neceſſary a
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0185201300:91"/>Work; I humbly recommend,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That the diſtinct Spheres of Phyſicians, Surgeons, and Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, be limited and ſpecified; The Surgeons reſtrain'd to their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Buſineſs; the Apothecaries con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd to their Shops; and all illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and Empirical Pretenders in Phyſick ſuppreſs'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That a Proviſion be made for the Poor to have their Share in the beſt Advice and Medicines.</p>
            <p>As the Want of ſuch a Regulation in Phyſick is one of the greateſt Flaws in our Conſtitution; and highly reflects upon the beſt of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, ſo ſuch a Regulation would undoubtedly tend as much to the Honour of our Nation, as the Preſervation of its People; and which not only the preſent, but all ſucceeding Generations will have the greateſt Reaſon in the World to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud.</p>
