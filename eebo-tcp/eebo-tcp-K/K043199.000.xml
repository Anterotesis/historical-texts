            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE unrelenting oppoſition which the productions of the author of the preſent comedy have experienced for ſeveral years is well known, to thoſe who pay attention to our public amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. It is not for him to pronounce how far this oppoſition has been merited by inability. Since the appearance of The Road to Ruin, his comedy of The Deſerted Daughter only has eſcaped; and that, as he imagines, becauſe it was not known on the night of its firſt performance by whom it was written. Love's Frailties, The Man of Ten Thouſand, and Knave or Not? have ſuſtained increaſing marks of hoſtility: ſo that the efforts made to afford rational amuſement to the public, emolument to the author, and improvement to morals, have been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered feeble and almoſt ineffectual. In the laſt inſtance, one miſtake appears to have pervaded the majority of the ſpectators. It was imagined that the author himſelf was as unqualified a libeller of mankind as Monroſe: in which character the writer's individual ſentiments were ſuppoſed to have been incorporated. Thoſe who have read his other works ſurely cannot attribute to him any ſuch indiſcriminate miſanthropy. The accuſation that has moſt generally been made againſt him is that he thinks men capable of gradations of virtue, which others affirm they can never attain. Perſons, who have made the human mind their ſtudy, have diſcovered that guilty men exert the whole force of their facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to juſtify their own courſe of action to themſelves. To this principle the writer was ſtrictly attentive, in pourtraying the character of Monroſe. His deſign was to draw a man of genius, miſled by his paſſions, reaſoning on his actions, ſyſtematizing them, condemning them in principle, but juſtifying them in practice, and heating his imagination by contemplating the crimes of others; that he might ſtill maintain that reſpect for himſelf of which the ſtrongeſt minds, even in the laſt ſtages of vice, are ſo tenacious. How far that ſpirit of faction, commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and anarchy, of which the author has long been and is ſtill ſo vehemently accuſed, is to be traced in the preſent co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy may now be ſeen. Sincerely deſirous of giving no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the paſſages which were moſt diſapproved, or to ſpeak more accurately reprobated, on the firſt night, have ſince been omitted in repreſentation: but they are printed between in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0737500700:3"/>
commas; that the cool judgment may decide whether the author could have been ſo inſane as actually to intend to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the ſpectators, and increaſe a ſpirit of enmity between men of different ſentiments: whom, could he reconcile, he would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it the moſt beneficial and heart conſoling action of his life. The ſeventh ſcene in the fourth act is likewiſe omitted, in the performance: becauſe, inſtead of giving pleaſure, it appeared tedious. It is inſerted here rather to preſerve a neceſſary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection between the ſcenes, than to appeal from the judgment and the feelings of a whole audience.</p>
            <p>Before the comedy appeared, all parties were anxious that no ſentence or word ſhould be ſpoken, which could be liable to miſrepreſentation. Some few paſſages, therefore, are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the preſs, which never were ſpoken on the Stage: par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the concluding part of the laſt ſpeech in the ſecond act, where Monroſe enquires into his qualifications for being a lord. A few years ago, this would have been common-place ſatire: and it is a ſubject of no little regret that, at preſent, lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and temporary applications are ſo liable to be made where none are intended.</p>
            <p>Truth requires it ſhould be mentioned that, in the original ſketch of this comedy, ſome hints were taken from IL RAG<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GIRATORE, LA SERVA AMOROSA, and IL PADRE DI FAMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GLIA, by GOLDONI: but of theſe, though he has not lately examined them, the author is perſuaded ſo few traces remain that they are ſcarcely diſcoverable. They are mentioned, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he conſiders the leaſt concealment of ſuch a kind as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatory to that veracity which it is the peculiar duty of moral writers to inculcate.</p>

                     <p>Why ay! Succeſs, fortune, and Aurelia ſhall be mine! As for fame, give me but wealth, and that will come unaſked. And yet my curſed querulous conſcience takes part with my ſiſter, and upbraids me for being an impoſtor. Abſurd! Who are not impoſtors? Is any man the thing he ſeems? And, if feign we muſt, is it not better to feign ſomething that the world reſpects, than ſomething that it deſpiſes? The ſon of a curate, I have daſhed into life, met variety of adventures, viſited the Continent, and aſſumed the airs of a foreign Count. I have certainly diſgraced myſelf; but the world does not think ſo. Who would ſhew his naked face when a maſk is ſo pleaſant, ſo profitable, and ſo eaſily put on? My father gave me education, Nature gave me deſires, and I have
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0737500700:52"/>
given myſelf a title. Why not? "If I am not a lord, it ſeems I ought to have been. I find no difficulty in being as extravagant as a lord, as proud as a lord, as idle as a lord, and as impudent as a lord. I could game like a lord, be duped like a lord, run in debt like a lord, and never pay, as naturally as if I had been born a lord. Let lords look to it, then, and reform. Let them be as ſuperior to the poor in virtue as they are in power, and I will bluſh for being an impoſtor."</p>
