            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE intention of the following Tract is to prove that the plea of <hi>ſudden Anger</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remove the imputation and guilt of <hi>Murder,</hi> when a <hi>Mortal Wound</hi> is <hi>wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> given <hi>with a weapon:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That the indulgence allowed by the Courts to <hi>voluntary Manſlaughter</hi> in Rencounters, and in ſudden Affrays and Duels, is <hi>indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminate,</hi> and without foundation in Law:</p>
            <p>And that <hi>impunity</hi> in ſuch caſes of <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Manſlaughter</hi> is one of the principal cauſes of the <hi>continuance</hi> and preſent <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe</hi> of the <hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>diſgraceful</hi> practice of Duelling.</p>
            <p>Univerſal Benevolence, including <hi>gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, patience</hi> and an unaffected <hi>placa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility</hi> in our behaviour, even towards thoſe
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0075801200:5"/>men who injure and affront us, is manifeſtly required of all men, who profeſs the true religion; and yet, unhappily for the Chriſtian world, this moſt obvious doctrine of the <hi>goſpel of peace,</hi> is too commonly either miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood, or elſe abſolutely rejected, though the <hi>temporal</hi> as well as the <hi>eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of mankind, greatly depends upon a conſcientious and proper obſervation of it. For a man cannot be a true Chriſtian with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obſerving this doctrine; and yet, ſo generally received is the oppoſite and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictory doctrine, concerning the neceſſity of revenging every perſonal affront with ſword and piſtol, for the ſake of, what is falſely called, <hi>honour,</hi> that a true Chriſtian is rarely to be with! Nay, we are fallen into ſuch groſs depravity, that the writer of a late publication on <hi>
                  <q>the principles of penal law,</q>
               </hi> has ventured to aſſert, (tho' he is in other reſpects, as I am informed, a ſenſible and ingenious young gentleman) that <q>the judge condemns the duelliſt, whilſt
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0075801200:6"/>he ſcarcely knows how in his own heart to diſapprove his behaviour.</q> (p. 224.) So that one would ſuppoſe Chriſtianity to be almoſt entirely extinct amongſt us, if its principles are ſo little regarded, <hi>even in our courts of juſtice,</hi> where they ought to be held <hi>moſt ſacred.</hi> My readers, perhaps, will ſtart at ſuch an idea in theſe enlightened days of reformation; but I will even go farther, and venture to aſſert, that the Europeans not only ceaſe to be Chriſtians, but will no longer deſerve the name even of <hi>men,</hi> if they perſiſt in ſuch a brutal and diabolical contradiction to the moſt indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſible principles of the laws of God and nature: for nothing deſerves to be eſteemed <hi>human</hi> that is <hi>unreaſonable;</hi> and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pravity, of which I complain, is not only incompatible with the laws of God, but abſolutely inconſiſtent with <hi>common ſenſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us view the character of the <hi>mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern man of honour</hi> (falſely ſo called)
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0075801200:7"/>who thinks it inconſiſtent with his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to paſs over a perſonal affront with that Chriſtian ſubmiſſion, which the goſpel requires of all men, without exception.</p>
            <p>Such an one perhaps will alledge, that his <hi>honour</hi> obliges him, whenever he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives an affront, to <hi>call out</hi> his adverſary, or <hi>to accept his challenge,</hi> leſt his <hi>courage</hi> ſhould be queſtioned; and therefore in ſuch caſe, the one muſt give, and the other take, what is commonly called <hi>gentleman-like Satisfaction.</hi> But let us examine this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of words. The <hi>Satisfaction</hi> to both parties is the riſk both of <hi>body</hi> and <hi>ſoul,</hi> in the perpetration of a moſt <hi>diſhonourable, baſe,</hi> and <hi>cowardly felony;</hi> which cannot, therefore, be <hi>gentleman-like,</hi> whatever the <hi>ſatisfaction</hi> of it may be. And 1ſt. It is <hi>Felony;</hi> becauſe no man can give, or accept, a challenge, without being guilty of <hi>Wilful Murder,</hi> if he <hi>kills</hi> his antagoniſt; which I hope is proved in the courſe of the
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0075801200:8"/>following tract. 2ndly. It is <hi>diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,</hi> becauſe it is an open violation of the indiſpenſible principles enjoined in the two great commandments of the ſupreme Law, viz. the <hi>love of God,</hi> and the <hi>love of our neighbour:</hi> for, in this reſpect, the offender is upon the ſame footing as culprits for <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glary, theft,</hi> or any other felony; the <q>
                  <hi>not having the fear of God before his eyes,</hi>
               </q> being equally applicable to all of them; and the common law of England eſteems no man qualified to be a member of ſociety, who wants this principle. The act is therefore highly <hi>diſhonourable;</hi> and to uſe a ſtill more humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating term of the ſame import, I muſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve—3dly, that it is alſo <hi>baſe;</hi> becauſe it affords the moſt apparent proof of a <hi>little Soul<note n="1" place="bottom">
                     <q>Nec Chriſtiani veteres hoc tantum viderunt, ſed et philoſophi, qui dixerunt <hi>puſilli eſſe animi contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam ferre non poſſe,</hi> ut alibi oſtendimus,</q> ſays the learned Grotius, in his 2d book De jure Belli et Pacis, p. 172.</note>;</hi> being, <hi>in reality,</hi> a <hi>brutal</hi> revenge;
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0075801200:9"/>
               <hi>brutal</hi> becauſe <hi>unreaſonable;</hi> (for how can <hi>Honour</hi> be vindicated or retrieved by the commiſſion of a <hi>notorious Felony?</hi>) and what is <hi>unreaſonable,</hi> muſt be diſgraceful to human nature, and therefore is truly <hi>baſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, it is <hi>cowardly</hi> (that is, when it cannot be imputed to <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Folly</hi>) becauſe a man ſubmits to it contrary to the light of his own reaſon, <hi>for fear</hi> his <hi>courage</hi> ſhould be called in queſtion; and yet <hi>he has not courage enough</hi> to withſtand the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous prejudices of a depraved world, leſt he ſhould ſuffer ſome temporal inconveniencies: and the <hi>ſlaviſh Fear</hi> which he entertains of theſe (for <hi>cowards</hi> always dread the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent evil moſt) deprives him of that <hi>reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fear,</hi> which he ought to entertain of God's judgment, becauſe he thinks it at a diſtance, though, he knows, it muſt inevit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably follow!—I condemn no man in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular; God forbid! I ſpeak of the queſtion
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0075801200:10"/>only in general: inveterate prejudices and cuſtoms may perhaps afford ſome excuſe in particular caſes to ſome <hi>individuals,</hi> who have <hi>ignorantly</hi> yielded thereto: but as <hi>ignorance</hi> is diſgraceful to <hi>humanity,</hi> I ſincerely wiſh that all perſons may enter into as careful an examination of this queſtion as I have done, by which they will not only be enabled to avoid a repetition of their crime, but alſo be prevented from attempting to defend what is paſt, and thereby afford the beſt proof of an ingenuous and honourable heart.</p>
            <p>This abominable practice of duelling, which of late years has increaſed to a moſt alarming degree, may chiefly be attributed (I humbly conceive) to the improper indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which our Engliſh courts of juſtice, for about two centuries back, have ſhewn to perſons <hi>convicted of killing in ſudden affrays and rencounters,</hi> through a falſe idea of mercy due to human failty, in caſes
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0075801200:11"/>of <hi>ſudden provocation;</hi> without preſerving the proper diſtinction of thoſe caſes wherein homicide, in <hi>ſudden anger,</hi> is really excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable by the laws of God, and of this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and the <hi>improper precedents,</hi> which have ariſen from this <hi>indiſcriminate and corrupt practice,</hi> have ſo miſled the more modern writers on <hi>Crown Law,</hi> that even the greateſt and moſt reſpectable of them have been unhappily induced to admit doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines on the ſubject of Manſlaughter, which are abſolutely incompatible with the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>neceſſary diſtinctions</hi> to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved between <hi>wilful murder</hi> and <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaughter,</hi> which they themſelves have laid down in other parts of their works: and it is on the authority of theſe juſt <hi>diſtinctions,</hi> with the neceſſary conſequences ariſing therefrom, (and not on my own preſumption) that this cenſure is founded; which the following tract I hope will clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0075801200:12"/>But as my readers might ſeem to give too much credit to an inconſiderable perſon like myſelf, were they, (without a previous intimation of what is propoſed,) to riſque any loſs of time in the peruſal of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and proofs at large, on which my vindication for this attempt depends, I think it my duty to ſtate the ſubject and intention of the tract, as briefly as I can, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatory addreſs, that my readers may, thereby, be enabled to judge, without much loſs of time, whether the matter is of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient conſequence to merit any more of their attention.</p>
            <p>I have already mentioned my opinion, that <q>No man can give or accept a challenge to fight <hi>with weapons,</hi> on any private difference whatever, without being guilty of <hi>wilful murder</hi> if he <hi>kills</hi> his antag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oniſt.</q> And the intention of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tract is to ſhew, that the writers on Crown Law have no juſt warrant for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0075801200:13"/>the contrary doctrines, which they have laid down concerning <hi>ſudden affrays</hi> and <hi>rencountres, viz.</hi> that <hi>the voluntary killing</hi> of a man on a <hi>ſudden provocation</hi> is only to be eſteemed <hi>Manſlaughter,</hi> and, as ſuch, is intitled to the benefit of Clergy. And they have alſo ſuppoſed that <hi>an aſſault</hi> is a ſufficient provocation to juſtify a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary manſlaughter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, certain it is; that ſome allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ought to be made for heat of blood upon a <hi>ſudden provocation,</hi> in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the extreme frailty of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; provided that there are no circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>malice</hi> in the caſe. As if (for inſtance) a man, <hi>in ſudden anger,</hi> ſhould ſtrike another, merely <hi>with his fiſt,</hi> or a ſmall <hi>cane,</hi> or <hi>ſtick,</hi> meaning only to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect, and ſhould <hi>accidentally kill;</hi> this would be, properly, <hi>manſlaughter;</hi> which, though it is deemed <hi>Felony</hi> (as the act of ſtriking, or beating another perſon is, in
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0075801200:14"/>itſelf, <hi>unlawful</hi>), is nevertheleſs <hi>pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> both by the laws of God and man. But when two perſons fight with <hi>dangerous weapons,</hi> an <hi>intention of killing</hi> is <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed</hi> by the <hi>weapons;</hi> and <hi>ſuch inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> renders the manſlaughter <hi>voluntary,</hi> which is the ſame thing as <hi>wilful;</hi> and conſequently the <hi>"malice prepenſed"</hi> (which excludes the benefit of clergy) is neceſſarily <hi>implied,</hi> though the ſudden anger be but a moment before the fatal ſtroke; for <hi>"malice prepenſed"</hi> is thus defined by Sir Edward Coke, <q>That is (ſays he) <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary,</hi> and of ſet purpoſe, though done <hi>upon a ſudden occaſion:</hi> for if it be <hi>voluntary</hi> the law implieth <hi>malice.</hi>

            <p>And yet the ſame great lawyer in p. <hi>55,</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>voluntary manſlaughter</hi> upon <hi>ſome ſudden falling out,</hi> as diſtinct from <hi>murder;</hi> which cannot, in reaſon, be true; for if the <hi>killing be voluntary,</hi> the evil
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0075801200:15"/>and <hi>malicious intention</hi> is neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the act, even though the fatal blow be given merely with <hi>the hand,</hi> or a <hi>ſmall cane</hi> or <hi>ſtick,</hi> which I have before mentioned as pardonable caſes, when the <hi>killing</hi> is not intended; for a <hi>voluntary ſtriking,</hi> without intention to kill, is indeed pardonable, though death enſues; but a <hi>vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary killing</hi> is ſo far from being ſo, that the law, according to Lord Coke's own rule, <hi>implieth malice;</hi> and, conſequently, the ſame muſt, neceſſarily, be eſteemed <hi>Murder,</hi> and not merely <hi>Manſlaughter;</hi> becauſe the neceſſary marks, whereby <hi>manſlaughter</hi> ought to be diſtinguiſhed, are abſolutely wanting therein: for <hi>manſlaughter</hi> muſt be "without <hi>malice</hi> expreſs or implied" (<hi>1</hi> Hale <hi>466. 4</hi> Blackſtone <hi>191</hi>) "<hi>Murder</hi> being aggravated" (ſays Lord Hale) <q>with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice preſumed or <hi>implied,</hi> but manſlaghter not.</q> And yet all theſe great and excellent lawyers have unhappily fallen into the ſame error of treating the <hi>voluntary branch</hi> of
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0075801200:16"/>killing, as bare <hi>Homicide,</hi> or <hi>manſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> whereas, all the older writers agree, that <hi>killing</hi> is pardonable only in caſes <hi>of inevitable neceſſity</hi> (Bracton, lib. <hi>iii.</hi> c. <hi>4.</hi> p. <hi>120.</hi> b. Fleta lib. <hi>i.</hi> c. <hi>23.</hi>) And the learned Judge Staunford ſays <q>That the whole matter conſiſts in the <hi>inevitable ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity;</hi> without which the <hi>killing</hi> is by <hi>no means excuſable</hi>
                  <note n="2" place="bottom">There is but one caſe of <hi>voluntary Killing,</hi> wherein the plea of <hi>ſudden Anger</hi> and atrocious provocation may ſeem entitled to ſome indulgence and conſideration: See Note in p. 46.</note> (n'eſt aſcun voi ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſable.</q> P.C. lib. <hi>i.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi>)</p>

            <p>The caſes of homicide which are juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or excuſed by the above-mentioned <hi>circumſtances</hi> of <hi>Accident</hi> and <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> are well underſtood, and, by many emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent writers, ſufficiently explained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the heads of <hi>Misfortune</hi> and <hi>Self-defence.</hi> But with reſpect to thoſe caſes of Homicide, which are attended with
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0075801200:24"/>circumſtances of <hi>infirmity</hi> (the third branch of circumſtances mentioned above) the writers on crown law in general have been <hi>very indiſcriminate,</hi> notwithſtanding that the true diſtinction between <hi>Murder</hi> and <hi>Manſlaughter</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends entirely on a clear ſtating of thoſe caſes of <hi>infirmity,</hi> which really deſerve conſideration and excuſe.</p>
            <p>Judge Foſter, indeed, is, for the moſt part, nice and accurate in his diſtinctions; yet he has paid ſo great a regard to the authority of <hi>precedents,</hi> that he has been unwarily led away (as well as other writers) from the neceſſary concluſions of <hi>his own arguments</hi> upon this point; I ſhall, nevertheleſs, make uſe of his words as far as they expreſs my own opinion of the ſubject.— <q>Whoever would ſhelter himſelf under the plea of <hi>Provocation</hi> muſt prove his caſe to the ſatisfaction of the jury.

               <q>It ought to be remembered (ſays he) that in all other caſes of homicide upon ſlight provocation<note n="g" place="bottom">But I have already ſhewn that <hi>no provocation</hi> whatever can juſtify a <hi>voluntary</hi> or <hi>wilful killing.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The firſt inſtance which he gives by way of illuſtration to this doctrine is cited from Judge Hale, vol. i. p. 473. <q>If <hi>A.</hi> come into the wood of <hi>B.</hi> and pull his hedges, or cut his wood, and <hi>B.</hi> beat him, whereof he dies, this is <hi>manſlaughter,</hi> becauſe, though it was not lawful for <hi>A.</hi> to cut the wood, it was not lawful for <hi>B.</hi> to beat him, but either to bring him to a Juſtice
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0075801200:31"/>of Peace, or puniſh him otherwiſe according to law.</q> But here Lord Hale is not ſufficiently diſtinct in ſtating the caſe; becauſe circumſtances are wanting, which are neceſſary for the determination of ſuch a caſe, whether it ought to be eſteemed <hi>manſlaughter</hi> or <hi>murder.</hi> The accurate Judge Foſter was ſenſible of this want of <hi>neceſſary circumſtances,</hi> and therefore adds, <q>But it muſt be underſtood (ſays he) that he beat him, <hi>not with a miſchievous intention,</hi> but meerly to chaſtiſe him for the treſpaſs, and to deter him from committing the like. For if he had knocked his brains out with <hi>a bill or hedgeſtake,</hi> or had given him <hi>an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rageous beating</hi> with an ordinary cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel beyond the bounds of a <hi>ſudden reſentment,</hi> whereof he had died, <hi>It had been Murder.</hi> For theſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances are ſome of the genuine ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of the <hi>Mala Mens,</hi> the heart
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0075801200:32"/>bent upon miſchief, which, as I have already ſhewn, enter into the true notion <hi>of Malice</hi> in the legal ſenſe of the word.</q> P. 291.</p>
            <p>The next inſtance he mentions is that of the parker tying the boy to his horſe's tail. Which was (ſays he) <q>
                  <hi>held to be murder.</hi>
               </q> 
               <q>For it was a deliberate act, <hi>and ſavoured of cruelty.</hi>
               </q> But the third inſtance, viz. that of Sted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the ſoldier killing a woman <hi>with a ſword</hi> (which Judge Foſter mentions as a caſe that <hi>was held clearly to be no more than manſlaughter</hi>) was, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, <hi>wilful murder:</hi> for tho' it appeared that the woman had ſtruck the ſoldier on the face with an iron patten; yet ſhe afterwards fled from him, and he <q>

            <p>By an act of the 2 Edw. III. it was ordained that a charter of pardon <q>ſhall not be granted, but only where <hi>the

                  <note n="y" place="bottom">This Statute was confirmed and enforced by two ſubſequent ſtatutes of the ſame reign (10 Ed. 3. c. 2. and 14 Ed. 3. c. 15.) in the plaineſt terms that words are capable of expreſſing; yet were they not ſufficient to root up the <hi>diſloyal</hi> practice of <hi>pardoning murderers:</hi> for in the following reign, King Richard the II.

                        <hi>the ſaid Commons re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted queſted our Lord the King, that ſuch charters might not be granted.</hi>
                     </q> The three former Statutes were <hi>then,</hi> as they ſtill are, unrepealed, and no ſubſequent Statute had at that time been made, that could poſſibly be conſtrued to affect them, or abate their force, ſo that the King's <hi>diſloyalty</hi> in granting ſuch <hi>prohibited charters</hi> was notorious; and his anſwer to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons was not leſs <hi>diſloyal</hi> than his practice, viz. <q>
                        <hi>That he will ſave his liberty and regality as his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitors have done heretofore.</hi>
                     </q> Richard, however, conſented to admit ſome conſiderable limitation of his <hi>pretended prerogative</hi> in pardoning <hi>murder.</hi> See 2 ſtat. c. 1. whereby it is ordained, <q>
                        <hi>that no charter of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don from henceforth ſhall be allowed</hi> FOR MURDER, <hi>or for the death of a man ſlain by await, aſſault, or malice prepenſed, Treaſon or Rape of a Woman, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the ſame murder,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>be ſpecified in the ſame charter.</hi>
                     </q> On a ſlight view, the word "UNLESS" may ſeem, by a negative implication, to admit the <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance</hi> of a <hi>charter of pardon for murder;</hi> but Sir Edward Coke has remarked upon it, that <q>
                        <hi>the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid act of</hi> 13 R. 2. <hi>was</hi> NOT <hi>that the King ſhould grant a pardon for murder, by expreſs name in the charter; but becauſe the whole Parliament con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that he would never pardon Murder by ſpecial name for the cauſes aforeſaid, therefore was that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion made, which was grounded</hi>
                     </q> (ſays he) <q>
                        <hi>upon the Law of God, Quicunque effuderit humanum ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinem, fundetur ſanguis illius; ad imaginem quippe Dei creatus eſt Homo.</hi> NEC ALITER EXPIARI POTEST NISI PER EJUS SANGUINEM <hi>qui alterius ſanguinem effuderit.</hi>
                     </q> (Gen. 9.6. Num. 35.33.) So that this learned Lawyer really reſolves <q>THE INTENTION OF THE SAID ACT</q> into the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the <hi>Divine Law,</hi> for which I contend, viz. <hi>"that blood"</hi> (i. e. wilful murder) <q>
                        <hi>cannot be expiated but by the blood of the guilty.</hi>
                     </q> And happily the Act ſeems alſo to have been <hi>effectual</hi> to accompliſh that <hi>intention;</hi> for the learned Judge Blackſtone, after citing Sir Edward Coke's opinion, that it was <q>NOT THE INTENTION <hi>of the Parliament, that the King ſhould ever</hi> PARDON MURDER <hi>under theſe aggrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c. adds, <hi>"and it is remarkable enough"</hi> (ſays he) <q>
                        <hi>that there is</hi> NO PRECEDENT OF A PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DON <hi>in the regiſter for any homicide than that</hi> which happens SE DEFENDENDO, or PER INFORTUNIUM.</q> And with reſpect to the determination of the Court of K. B. cited by Salkeld 499, that <hi>the King may par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don on an indictment of murder,</hi> as well as the ſubject may diſcharge an appeal; I obſerve, that the force of the learned Judge Holt's argument for that doctrine, reſts on the repeal (in 16 R. 2. c. 6.) of the reſtrictions, and great difficulties which are put upon thoſe that ſhall be ſuitors for <hi>a pardon of murder</hi> in this Act of 13 R. 2. which (ſaid he) <q>
                        <hi>were found</hi> GRIEVOUS TO THE SUBJECT:</q> But that worthy and upright Judge would have acted on this point more like himſelf, if he had previouſly examined the nature of the ſuppoſed <hi>griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,</hi> whereby he would have known, whether it was really <hi>true</hi> and <hi>juſt,</hi> or only <hi>fained?</hi> For if the alledged <hi>"grievance to the ſubject"</hi> was only an <hi>unjuſt ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the whole Statute of <hi>Repeal,</hi> as far as relates to this point is <hi>null</hi> and <hi>void</hi> for the <hi>want of truth,</hi> as well as for being contrary to the 2d foundation of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh law, "for <hi>contra veritatem nihil poſſumus:</hi>" and again <hi>"contraveritatem lex nunquam aliquid permittit".</hi> (2 Inſt. 252 Plowden, &amp;c.) But above all, the FATAL END of King Richard II. ſhould warn and deter all fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Monarchs from preſuming to aſſert a PREROGA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIVE TO PARDON MURDER. The ill-fated Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch by his ignorance of the nature of <hi>Royal Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive</hi> in a <hi>limited</hi> or <hi>politic government,</hi> prepared the way for his own deſtruction, not conſidering that his <hi>regality</hi> had no foundation but the <hi>law;</hi> and that his neglect of the latter, did neceſſarily undermine the former, which he afterwards ſeverely experienced when compelled to deliver up both Crown and <hi>Regality</hi> with a public con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his own unworthineſs to bear them: And it is remarkable, that the <hi>murders</hi> which had increaſed through his criminal indulgence, were awefully retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted afterwards in his own <hi>blood:</hi> for, at laſt, he was himſelf, alſo, moſt cruelly and wickedly <hi>murdered,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>trary to the laws of God and man, as if the <hi>blood</hi> which he had unjuſtly refuſed to <hi>cleanſe from the land,</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate by the blood of the guilty,</hi> had fatally reſted on his own head!!!</note> that is to ſay, where a man ſlayeth another

<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0075801200:85"/>any private difference, howſoever great the provocation. Nevertheleſs, Mr. Hawkins ventures to aſſert a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent doctrine in his Pleas of the Crown, 1 Book c. xxviii. § 24. <q>I ſee no reaſon (ſays he) why a perſon, who without provocation is aſſaulted by another in any place whatſoever, in ſuch a manner as plainly ſhews an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to murder him, as by diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Piſtol, or puſhing at him with a drawn Sword, &amp;c. may not <hi>juſtify Killing</hi> ſuch an Aſſailant, as much as if he had attempted to rob him: for is not he, who attempts to Murder me (ſays he) more injurious than he who barely attempts to rob me? And can it be more juſtifiable to fight for my goods than for my life? And it is not only highly agreeable to reaſon, that a man in ſuch circumſtances may <hi>lawfully Kill</hi> another, but it ſeems
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0075801200:86"/>alſo to be confirmed by <hi>the general Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of our Law-books,</hi>
               </q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But howſoever ſpecious this argument may appear, I hope I have already proved <hi>"by the general Tenor of our Law-books;"</hi> that the <hi>Juſtifiable Kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of a Man muſt be through <hi>an inevita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity:</hi> and therefore what Mr. Hawkins afterwards advances, in his compariſon of ſuch a caſe with Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide in <hi>ſe Defendendo,</hi> cannot in the leaſt juſtify either his opinion on that point, or his aſſertion concerning <q>the general Tenor of the Law-books.</q>
            </p>
            <p>He endeavours to repreſent <hi>the Volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Killing</hi> of a Man as <hi>Juſtifiable Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide,</hi> and conſequently he muſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it a leſs crime than <hi>Excuſable Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micide,</hi> in <hi>ſe Defendendo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>He founds his opinion in the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of "ſome <hi>precedent Quarrel</hi>" in
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0075801200:87"/>the latter, "in which" (ſays he) <q>both parties always are, or at leaſt may <hi>juſtly be ſuppoſed</hi> to have been, in ſome fault, ſo that the neceſſity, to which a Man is at length reduced to kill another, is in ſome meaſure preſumed to be owing to himſelf:</q> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But may it not, as <hi>"juſtly be ſuppoſed"</hi> that the perſon, who <hi>Kills</hi> without <hi>ſuch neceſſity,</hi> is alſo <hi>"in ſome fault?"</hi> Is not the <hi>Preſumption of Law</hi> againſt him (as I have elſewhere ſhewn) by the <hi>bloody</hi> FACT, when he cannot prove that <hi>he endeavoured,</hi> at leaſt, to retreat, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to avoid unneceſſary bloodſhed? And is not FACT a more ſubſtantial ground for a criminal charge, than any idea that a Court can poſſibly form con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Murderous Intentions,</hi> which <hi>the Killer</hi> may attribute to <hi>the perſon Killed?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0075801200:88"/>The ſingle circumſtance that <hi>the Killer</hi> was under <hi>no neceſſity</hi> of endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to retreat, and avoid the aſſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, is not only a proof that <hi>his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> (though he might not be the firſt aggreſſor) were nearly as criminal, as thoſe he attributes to the <hi>perſon Killed,</hi> but it alſo affords a ſtrong preſumption, that <hi>the latter</hi> was not very ſtrenuous or ſanguine, either in his attack, or in his ſuppoſed <hi>intention to commit murder:</hi> ſo that the very pretence, by which Mr. Hawkins endeavours to juſtify ſuch a <hi>voluntary Killing,</hi> muſt neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily fall to the ground, whenever <hi>the Killer</hi> is unable to prove, that he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to avoid the attack<note n="gg" place="bottom">I have already made the neceſſary exceptions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Civil Officers in the legal Execution of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, &amp;c.</note> And tho' the Deceaſed might have had <q>a Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Drawn,</q> yet that circumſtance affords no poſitive proof of his <hi>criminal
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0075801200:89"/>intention;</hi> for he might have thought himſelf obliged to draw in his own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, through a reciprocal ſuſpicion of his adverſary's <hi>criminal intentions:</hi> and as he cannot plead his own cauſe, it is reaſonable that the Law ſhould <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume,</hi> that he really did draw in his own defence, eſpecially as the circumſtance, that <hi>the Killer</hi> was under no neceſſity of endeavouring to avoid him, affords a ſufficient Ground for ſuch <hi>a preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And even in caſes where it may be ſuppoſed that the <hi>perſon Killed</hi> might really have had <hi>"an intent to murder,"</hi> we ought to remember that the Laws of England do not puniſh men <hi>merely</hi> for their <hi>"criminal intentions"</hi> without ſome fact! and, therefore, it would be highly abſurd to ſuppoſe, that the Law, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome apparent neceſſity, would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt every individual, indiſcriminately,
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0075801200:90"/>with a ſupreme Authority, which it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies <hi>even</hi> to the Higheſt and moſt ſolemn Courts of Juſtice; I mean an Authority to inflict capital puniſhment without a previous Trial <hi>per pares;</hi> and that mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for <hi>"a Criminal Intention;"</hi> which, in many caſes, might as eaſily, (through fear, paſſion, or violent prejudice) be miſtaken, or imaginary, as be real!</p>
            <p>And therefore <q>
                  <hi>an Aſſault upon the Perſon</hi>
               </q> is not (as I have before in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in p. 5. againſt the opinion of Judge Foſter) <q>Provocation ſufficient to free <hi>the Party Killing</hi> from the Guilt of Murder.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The caſe of Gentlemen in the Army, nevertheleſs, ſeems peculiarly hard upon ſuch unhappy occaſions. The firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of their profeſſion is <hi>Courage;</hi> and the World, in general, is too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved to diſtinguiſh in what caſes a
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0075801200:91"/>Man of <hi>true Courage</hi> may retreat <hi>with honour</hi> from the Aſſault of an Enemy; ſo that Military Men are liable to be <hi>unjuſtly</hi> deſpiſed, whenever they act <hi>rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably</hi> in caſes either of inſult, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault!</p>
            <p>Yet, at the ſame time, it ought to be remembered, that thoſe men who ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>the Slaviſh Yoke</hi> of other Men's depraved opinions or unreaſonable cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms (in contradiction to that <hi>natural Knowledge</hi> of <hi>Good and Evil,</hi> which they inherit, in common with the reſt of Mankind, from our firſt Parents), can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not <hi>juſtly</hi> be deemed <hi>Men of Honour;</hi> and, conſequently, are unworthy of <hi>Rank</hi> in the honourable Profeſſion of Arms. And though ſuch men may ſupport an outward <hi>appearance</hi> of <hi>Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age</hi> in the eye of the world, by <hi>daring</hi> to violate the Laws of God and Man in <hi>private</hi> Quarrels, yet that very act af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0075801200:92"/>the moſt manifeſt token of the Want of <hi>real</hi> and <hi>ſteady Courage:</hi> for unleſs the ſubmiſſion to that depraved cuſtom can be attributed to <hi>inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or</hi> to <hi>the want of Knowledge,</hi> it muſt neceſſarily be ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Duelliſt had not ſufficient Courage</hi> to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert his <hi>natural Right</hi> of Acting agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Dictates of his <hi>own reaſon and conſcience;</hi> and was <hi>unable to face the Terrors</hi> of <hi>an</hi> adverſe Fortune <hi>in a good Cauſe;</hi> and therefore, like a wretched <hi>Coward,</hi> he yielded himſelf a priſoner and ſlave to the faſhionable Depravity!</p>
            <p>I am far from meaning however to charge all Soldiers with Cowardice that have fought Duels: ſometimes Paſſion and falſe Pride, but more frequently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſideration, and ignorance of the Laws of God and Man (as I have before hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) occaſion the baſe ſubmiſſion and conformity to thoſe <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble

            <p>Nor do I ſo much blame <hi>the Military Gentlemen,</hi> for this unnatural depravity, as I do <hi>the Profeſſors of the Law;</hi> who ought to have ſet them a better exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and yet, have rather contributed to <hi>the ignorance of the times,</hi> by the many <hi>groſs perverſions</hi> of <hi>our Law,</hi> which they have admitted into the Books.
