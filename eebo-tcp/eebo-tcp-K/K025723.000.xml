            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN examining a Religion, which pretends to come from God, one of the <hi>firſt</hi> things which forceth itſelf upon our attention, is the <hi>Influence</hi> of its <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Precepts</hi> upon human <hi>Felicity.</hi> If the natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of <hi>theſe,</hi> be to <hi>regulate</hi> the paſſions, and to <hi>promote</hi> the general Happineſs of Mankind; a ſtrong preſumption ariſeth, that its pretenſions to a divine origin, <hi>may</hi> be well founded. But if a Religion obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly tendeth to <hi>leſſen</hi> human happineſs, or
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1102902400:4"/>
to <hi>diſturb the peace of Society</hi>; we may, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out further examination, conclude with <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty,</hi> that it cometh <hi>not</hi> from that great, and beneficent Being, who (far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting in the miſery of his creatures) would have <hi>all</hi> to be pious, and virtuous, <hi>only,</hi> that <hi>all</hi> may be finally, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely happy, in thoſe realms where Death hath no dominion.</p>
            <p>Viewed in <hi>this</hi> light, Chriſtianity is <hi>emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently</hi> diſtinguiſhed above every other reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Inſtitution, which hath hitherto pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed in the world. It teacheth in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, the duties of <hi>Man</hi> to <hi>Man</hi>; it affordeth <hi>divine</hi> aids to <hi>human</hi> weakneſs; and encourageth the practice of what it ſheweth to be good, by motives the moſt engaging, and the moſt exalted.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Religion exhorteth us to be mindful of <q rend="inline">whatſoever things are true, honeſt, juſt, pure, lovely, or of good report</q>—to forgive our enemies, to love our neighbours as ourſelves, to do good, as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1102902400:5"/>
we have opportunity, to every individual of the human race, and, as much as lieth in us, to live peaceably with all men.</p>
            <p>In Society <hi>only</hi> are theſe duties <hi>practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi>; and, without Government and Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination, <hi>Society could not ſubſiſt.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the divine Author, and Finiſher of our Faith, <hi>in order to give efficacy to his other commands,</hi> enforced obedience to the civil Magiſtrate <hi>by an injunction of the Goſpel,</hi> requiring his followers to <q rend="inline">render unto <hi>Caeſar</hi> the things that were <hi>Caeſar's,</hi>
               </q>  as well as <q rend="inline">unto <hi>God</hi> the things that were <hi>God's.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>ſame</hi> courſe of ſalutary inſtruction, was faithfully purſued by the Apoſtles, and others, the firſt Preachers of Chriſtianity; who earneſtly exhorted their Converts to <q rend="inline">render to <hi>all</hi> their dues; tribute to whom tribute was due; cuſtom to whom cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom; fear to whom fear; honour to whom honour; to ſubmit themſelves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1102902400:6"/>
ſake; whether to the King as ſupreme, or to Magiſtrates, as unto them, who are ſent by him for the Puniſhment of evil-doers, and for the Praiſe of them that do well.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To <hi>theſe</hi> Precepts of <hi>Civil Obedience</hi> no objection of importance hath ever been made. They are (on the contrary) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded both by the believer, and by the unbeliever,—by him who reverenceth the Goſpel, as the power of God unto Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—and by him who conſidereth it as a cunningly deviſed fable, calculated <hi>merely</hi> to erect a Dominion over the conſciences of men.</p>
            <p>But the Precept of my <hi>Text,</hi> hath fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently been viewed in a light <hi>leſs favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</hi> It, <hi>certainly ſuppoſeth</hi> an Authority different from that of the <hi>civil</hi> Magiſtrate, <hi>whoſe</hi> Duty is to watch, <hi>not</hi> for the <hi>Souls, but</hi> for the <hi>Lives</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and to <hi>that</hi> Authority St. Paul, here, enjoineth an <hi>Obedience,</hi> which the <q rend="inline">chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1102902400:7"/>
of this world</q> are <hi>little willing to pay.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It would be idle to reaſon in ſupport of <hi>ſpiritual Authority</hi> with ſuch as doubt, or deny the divine origin of the Goſpel; for THESE MEN muſt be convinced that they HAVE SOULS, before they can be perſuaded to enquire WHO are appointed to <hi>watch</hi> for them; to WHOM, on <hi>that</hi> account, their obedience is due; or WHAT is the <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Extent</hi> of the obedience required.</p>
            <p>THEY are not, however, ALL infidels, who <hi>deny</hi> the reality of ſpiritual Powers;—for many ſincere believers in Chriſtianity contend that, under the Goſpel-diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there is nothing which bears the ſmalleſt reſemblance to an excluſive Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; that the Authority which is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in my Text, either ceaſed with the Apoſtles; or that (if it ſtill continueth in the Church) it can be conferred on one claſs of Chriſtians, <hi>only,</hi> by the <hi>Election</hi> of others; and that, <hi>therefore,</hi> we are bound
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1102902400:8"/>
to obey it, <hi>no farther,</hi> than is neceſſary to preſerve <hi>Decency</hi> and <hi>Order</hi> in the conduct of public worſhip.</p>
            <p>That, our bleſſed Lord gave to none of his immediate followers Authority or Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, of <hi>ſuch a nature</hi> as, to interfere with the Rights of the Rulers of the Earth, is, indeed, an undoubted Truth,—for <hi>all ſuch Authority</hi> was diſclaimed by <hi>Himſelf</hi>; <q rend="inline">My kingdom,</q> ſaid He to Pilate, <q rend="inline">is not of this world</q>—And, upon being aſked by a certain perſon to decide a <hi>queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Property</hi> between him and his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, his Reply was, <q rend="inline">Man—<hi>who</hi> made <hi>me</hi> a Judge, or a Divider over you?</q> But when it is conſidered that, Chriſt came into the world to <q rend="inline">turn men from Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto Light, and from the Power of Satan unto God;</q>  that, <q rend="inline">He gave him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for us, that He might redeem us from <hi>all</hi> Iniquity, and purify to himſelf a peculiar people <hi>zealous</hi> of good works</q>—and that of <hi>theſe works very many</hi> are ſuch
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1102902400:9"/>
as unregenerate humanity cannot perform; and that the <hi>Doctrines</hi> which he revealed, are ſuch as <hi>human Reaſon</hi> could <hi>never</hi> have diſcovered; it will be ſeen how <hi>neceſſary</hi> it was that, when he aſcended into Heaven, he ſhould ſubſtitute ſome <hi>Authority,</hi> on Earth, to <hi>illuſtrate the Revelation</hi> which he had <hi>given,</hi> and to <hi>enforce obedience</hi> to the <hi>Laws</hi> which he had <hi>enacted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is nothing more ſtrictly required of Chriſtians, than that they ſhould live together in <hi>Unity</hi>; profeſſing the <hi>ſame</hi> Faith, joining in the <hi>ſame</hi> Worſhip, and practiſing the <hi>ſame</hi> Virtues on the <hi>ſame</hi> Principles. Now, as Men have <hi>different</hi> Paſſions, Prejudices, and Purſuits, <hi>ſuch Unity</hi> would be impoſſible, were they <hi>not</hi> linked together in <hi>one</hi> Society; under the Government of Perſons authoriſed to <hi>watch over the Faith,</hi> to <hi>preſcribe the Forms of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Worſhip,</hi> and to <hi>inculcate the neceſſity,</hi> and <hi>explain the Nature</hi> and <hi>Extent</hi> of the <hi>ſeveral Virtues.</hi>

In the Scriptures of the New Teſtament, the Society of Chriſtians is (on account of its unity and organization) compared to the human body; <q rend="inline">for as we have <hi>many</hi> members in <hi>one</hi> body, and all members have not the <hi>ſame office</hi>; ſo <hi>we,</hi> being many, are <hi>one Body</hi> in Chriſt, and every one <hi>members one of another.</hi>
               </q> (<bibl>Rom. XII. 4. 5</bibl>)<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>   This Society of Believers, in our common Deliverer, is called the CHURCH, 'the <hi>Kingdom of God</hi>',—and 'the <hi>Kingdom of Heaven</hi>'; and ITS affairs (like the affairs of every other Kingdom) are adminiſtered by <hi>proper</hi> officers in ſubordination to <hi>the one Lord</hi>; who <q rend="inline">when he aſcended on high, and led captivity captive, gave <hi>ſome</hi> Apoſtles, and <hi>ſome</hi> Prophets, and <hi>ſome</hi> Evangeliſts, and <hi>ſome</hi> Paſtors, and Teachers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Miniſtry, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt; that, henceforth we ſhould be <hi>no more</hi> children toſſed to and fro, and carried
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1102902400:11"/>
about with <hi>every</hi> wind of Doctrine, by the ſleight of men, and cunning crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs whereby they lie in wait to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive; but ſpeaking the truth in love, may grow up into <hi>Him</hi> in all things, which is the Head, even Chriſt, from <hi>whom</hi> the whole Body fitly joined toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and compacted by <hi>that</hi> which every joint ſupplieth, according to the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual working in the meaſure of <hi>every</hi> part, maketh increaſe of the body unto the edifying of itſelf in love.</q> (<bibl>Epheſ. IV. 11. 12. 14. 15. 16.</bibl>)</p>
            <p>Now,—of <hi>this</hi> Society (as of a philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Sect) it is <hi>not</hi> left to <hi>every</hi> man's choice, as a thing indifferent, whether or <hi>not</hi> he will become a Member. ALL who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace the Faith of the Redeemer of the world, are required to be <hi>baptized,</hi> under the pain of forfeiting the <hi>benefits of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> (St. Mark, XVI. 16.—St. John, III. 5.) But <hi>one great purpoſe</hi> propoſed by the inſtitution of Baptiſm, was the Initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1102902400:12"/>
of Perſons into the Church of Chriſt; <q rend="inline">For <hi>by one Spirit</hi>
               </q>  (ſaith St. Paul, <bibl>1 Cor. XII. 13. 27. 28. 29.</bibl>) <q rend="inline">are we all bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized <hi>into one Body,</hi> whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> (whatever be the Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance) it is evident that to receive it is, <hi>not</hi> (like moral Juſtice, or the Veneration of the Supreme Being) a Duty reſulting from the <hi>Nature of the Relations of Man</hi>; and that <hi>all</hi> its efficacy (which in Scripture is ſaid to be <hi>nothing leſs than the Remiſſion of Sins,</hi> Acts II. 38. and XXII. 16.) is derived from <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Inſtitution,</hi> and can accompany the external Rite, <hi>only,</hi> when <hi>that</hi> Rite is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered in the <hi>manner preſcribed,</hi> and by the <hi>perſons authoriſed</hi> to adminiſter it.</p>
            <p>That <hi>all Chriſtians,</hi> in common, are <hi>not</hi> veſted with this authority, is plain from the Commiſſion, which (after his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection) the bleſſed Jeſus gave to his Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles. We are aſſured that the number of
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1102902400:13"/>
his followers was then <hi>five hundred at leaſt</hi>; but it was ONLY to the ELEVEN DISCI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PLES that <q rend="inline">He came and ſpake ſaying, All power is given unto me in Heaven, and Earth; Go YE therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</q> (<bibl>St. Matthew, XXVIII. 16. 17. 18. 19.</bibl>)  Now there is no reaſon to ſuppoſe that there were not <hi>many</hi> of the five hundred well qualified to inſtruct either a Jew, or a Gentile, in the doctrines of the the Goſpel; and it is certain, that <hi>any one</hi> of them could have waſhed his Converts with water in the Name of the Holy Trinity, as well as St. Peter, or St. John: but then, ſuch an <hi>unauthorized waſhing</hi> would not have been <hi>Chriſtian Baptiſm,</hi> or of equal Validity with <hi>it,</hi> any more than the <hi>Opinion</hi> of a <hi>Lawyer at the Bar,</hi> is the <hi>Judgement of a Court of Juſtice,</hi> or of equal obligation: It is the <hi>Commiſſion of the Sovereign</hi> which gives force to the <hi>Judgement of the Court</hi>; as it is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1102902400:14"/>

with the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, to make Inſtitutions which, (like Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper) are <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally</hi> neceſſary to the Salvation of <hi>all</hi> Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, depend upon the <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion</hi> of a <hi>particular Order</hi>; Becauſe, by ſuch an Economy, an <hi>intolerable Domina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> would be eſtabliſhed over the Souls of Men; and the purpoſe, for which the Son of God died, might, in <hi>ſome degree,</hi> be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feated, by the Caprice of an <hi>ignorant</hi> and <hi>arbitrary Prieſthood</hi>:—But, <hi>this objection,</hi> is either of <hi>no</hi> weight, or it militates with <hi>equal force</hi> againſt <hi>all</hi> Religion, natural as well as revealed<note n="c" place="bottom">Although, in conformity with the uſual mode of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, I have diſtinguiſhed between <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>revealed</hi> Religion, I do not imagine that there ever <hi>was,</hi> or <hi>could have been,</hi> a conſiſtent ſcheme of Religion excogitated by the <hi>mere ſtrength of human Genius:</hi> the Authors who detail to us Syſtems of, what is called, the <hi>Religion of Nature,</hi> borrow ſometimes (without adverting to it) their Principles from the Holy Scriptures, and then, not unfrequently, turn againſt Revelation <hi>thoſe arms</hi> with which <hi>it</hi> hath furniſhed them.—In vigour of Intellect <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Cicero</hi> were, ſurely, <hi>not inferior</hi> to <hi>Mr. Woolaſton</hi>; and yet, it is certain, that in their writings are not to be found <hi>ſo many Truths,</hi> and <hi>ſo few miſtakes,</hi> relating to the Supreme Being, as He has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in <hi>one ſmall Volume</hi>—Whence, then, had the Author of <hi>the Religion of Nature delineated</hi> this ſuperiority over the greateſt Men of Antiquity?—Undoubtedly, from his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe Truths, which are recorded in the Old and New Teſtaments, and of which the Philoſophers of Athens and Rome, knew <hi>nothing,</hi> except what had come down to them from the primeval times, through the precarious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of oral tradition.—When a propoſition is <hi>once</hi> known to be true, it requires no extraordinary ſtrength of mind to underſtand the <hi>Grounds</hi> of its Truth.

Even, <hi>in Society,</hi> it would be impoſſible for <hi>any Man,</hi> without the Aſſiſtance of others, to underſtand, in the <hi>preſent Age,</hi> the <hi>very firſt Principles of Chriſtianity</hi>; for the Scriptures, in which <hi>alone,</hi> thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples can be found, are written in Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages which are <hi>now,</hi> no where <hi>vernacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar.</hi> In the Fidelity of Tranſlators, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, every illiterate Diſciple of Jeſus, <hi>muſt confide</hi> for the <hi>Truth</hi> of thoſe Doctrines, which conſtitute the <hi>Foundation of all his Hopes</hi>; and, as <hi>no</hi> man ever pretended that the <hi>Chriſtian Sacraments</hi> are more <hi>neceſſary</hi> to Salvation than the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> where is the <hi>impropriety,</hi> or <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> of thoſe Perſons receiving the Sacraments of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the Lord's Supper, by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of <hi>others,</hi> who, by ſuch <hi>miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> muſt, of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> receive the Truths of the Goſpel?</p>

            <p>
               <hi>One Party</hi> maintains that, originally, the Officers of the Church were ALL, Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ONE ORDER, and veſted with equal Powers; Whilſt <hi>others</hi> (and the Church of England eſpecially) hold that Chriſt and his Apoſtles appointed DIVERS ORDERS of Miniſters in the Church; that of THESE ORDERS the HIGHST ALONE, was veſted with Authority to ORDAIN OTHERS; and that, <hi>therefore,</hi> Obedience (as to thoſe <q rend="inline">who watch for our Souls</q>) can be due ONLY to ſuch as are EPISCOPALLY OR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DAINED.</p>
            <p>This is the <hi>famous Queſtion,</hi> concerning the apoſtolic Model of Church-Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which has (almoſt from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Reformation) been agitated between <hi>us,</hi> and the <hi>Diſſenters of the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Sect.</hi>

The Plea urged in Behalf of the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terians is, that the Titles, <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter,</hi> being in the New Teſtament indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently given to the <hi>ſame</hi> Perſons, cannot be the Titles of <hi>diſtinct</hi> eccleſiaſtical Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; which appears, it is ſaid, <hi>ſtill more evident</hi> from the Ordination of Timothy, who (although the <hi>firſt</hi> Biſhop of Epheſus) was veſted with his epiſcopal Character by the Impoſition of the <hi>Hands of the Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame Man</hi> is, in the New Teſtament, ſometimes called a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and ſometimes a <hi>Preſbyter,</hi> cannot perhaps be denied; but although every apoſtolic <hi>Biſhop</hi> was, therefore, undoubtedly a <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi>;—it does <hi>not</hi> follow that every <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byter</hi> was likewiſe a <hi>Biſhop.</hi> In the Old Teſtament Aaron, and his Sons are (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Diſcrimination of Order) frequently ſtyled <hi>Prieſts</hi>;—as in the New Teſtament both St. Peter, and St. John call themſelves <hi>Preſbyters.</hi> (1 Pet. V. 1.—2 John, 1.—
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1102902400:24"/>
3 John 1.) And St. Paul upon <hi>one</hi> occaſion, denominates himſelf a Deacon. (Coloſſ. 1. 24. 25. See the original) Yet, I believe, <hi>no</hi> man ever ſuppoſed that thoſe Apoſtles were <hi>ſuch eccleſiaſtical Officers,</hi> as <hi>modern preſbyterian Miniſters, or Deacons</hi>: And it is univerſally known that in the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſthood, there were <hi>different</hi> Orders; and that <hi>Aaron</hi> was of an Order <hi>ſuperior</hi> to his <hi>Sons.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>This</hi> being the Caſe; the <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> by the laying on of <hi>whoſe Hands</hi> Timothy was made a Biſhop, <hi>may</hi> have been of the ſame Order with St, Peter, and St. John; and, <hi>if ſo, his</hi> Conſecration was undoubtedly <hi>Epiſcopal.</hi> We are (at <hi>all Events</hi>) <hi>certain</hi> that it was not (in the modern ſenſe of the word) <hi>Preſbyterian</hi>; for the Gift, which in the firſt Epiſtle is ſaid to have been given to him by Prophecy, <q rend="inline">with the laying on of the Hands of the <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery</hi>;</q> is in the ſecond ſaid to have been in him <q rend="inline">by the putting on of the

            </p>
            <p>It appears, therefore, that (from the

               <hi>promiſcuous uſe</hi> of the Titles <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and <hi>Preſbyter</hi>) <hi>nothing</hi> can with certainty be concluded on <hi>either</hi> Side of this celebrated Queſtion.

            <p>During our Saviour's Stay upon Earth, we know that He had under Him <hi>two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Orders</hi> of Miniſters; the <hi>Twelve</hi> and the <hi>Seventy:</hi> and after his Aſcenſion (im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately before which he had enlarged the Powers of the Eleven) we read of <hi>Apoſtles.

               <hi>Apoſtolic</hi> Order was deſigned for continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.—A Quaker ſays the ſame thing of Water-Baptiſm; and, I know not by what <hi>Text of Scripture,</hi> or by what <hi>Mode of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, Thoſe</hi> who, upon <hi>this</hi> Plea, reject the Apoſtolic Order of Chriſtian Miniſters, could overthrow the <hi>Principles</hi> upon which the Diſciples of George Fox reject the Uſe of <hi>that</hi> Rite, inſtituted for the Initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind into the Chriſtian Church.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>They</hi> were the <hi>Eleven, alone,</hi> to whom our Saviour ſaid <q rend="inline">Go <hi>ye,</hi> therefore, and teach <hi>all</hi> Nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt—teaching them to obſerve <hi>all</hi> things whatſoever I have commanded you.</q> (Matthew XXVIII. 16. 19. 20.)   And, therefore, although we frequently find Preſbyters and Deacons ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtering the Sacrament of Baptiſm; we muſt conclude that (as a Judge adminiſters Juſtice by Authority derived from his So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, ſo) thoſe <hi>inferior</hi> Officers of the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1102902400:28"/>
Church adminiſtered Baptiſm by <hi>Authority</hi> derived from the <hi>Apoſtles</hi>: Indeed, had they pretended to act by <hi>any other Authority,</hi> it is not <hi>eaſy</hi> to conceive how <hi>their Baptiſm</hi> could have been the <hi>Baptiſm of Chriſt</hi>; for it was <hi>not</hi> with the external waſhing, by <hi>whomſoever</hi> performed, but with the <hi>Eleven</hi> and <hi>their Succeſſors</hi> that Chriſt promiſed to <hi>be</hi> 
               <q rend="inline">always, even unto the End of the World.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That the Eleven did <hi>not</hi> conſider this Promiſe, or the Commiſſion with which it was given, as terminating with <hi>their Lives,</hi> is evident from their admitting <hi>others</hi> into their <hi>own Order</hi>; for which they had competent Authority, as having been <hi>ſent</hi> by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as he was <hi>ſent</hi> by his <hi>Father</hi> (St. John.

            <p>Now, it being certain that, from the Days of the Apoſtles to thoſe of Calvin, <hi>no man</hi> was authorized to miniſter in holy things, but by Ordination from the Hands of a <hi>Biſhop</hi>;<note n="g" place="bottom">Should it be granted, in Defiance of all Antiquity and, as I think, in contradiction to the cleareſt Evidence of Scripture; that in the Church, there were at firſt <hi>but two</hi> permanent Orders of Miniſters, of which the higheſt were called Biſhops or Preſbyters <hi>indifferently,</hi> and the other Deacons; I ſee no advantage which, from ſuch a conceſſion, could redound to the Preſbyterian cauſe. According to this Suppoſition, the Apoſtolical Preſbyters muſt have been inveſted, as it is contended they were, with all the powers of modern Biſhops—with the power of preaching, of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtering the Sacraments, and of <hi>ſending</hi> Labourers into Chriſt's Vineyard: But it is notorious that, <hi>at the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and in <hi>every prior period of the Church</hi> of which Hiſtory makes mention, there were <hi>three Orders of Miniſters,</hi> of which the <hi>Second</hi> was authorized to preach the Goſpel, and to adminiſter the Sacraments, but <hi>not</hi> to <hi>ſend</hi> La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers into Chriſt's Vineyard, which was the Prerogative of the <hi>higheſt</hi> alone: That <hi>ſecond</hi> Order, being, therefore, upon this ſuppoſition, <hi>unknown</hi> in the Apoſtolic Age, muſt have been introduced into the Church, by <hi>no competent Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</hi> But it is from <hi>it</hi> that the Preſbyterians derive their <hi>Miſſion,</hi> which, therefore, upon their <hi>own</hi> Principles, MUST BE TOTALLY VOID.

But if an eſtabliſhed Religion be <hi>neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary</hi> to the Tranquility of a State (which hath been repeatedly proved by arguments that have not, <hi>yet,</hi> been overthrown); and if that Religion, which <hi>is</hi> eſtabliſhed, hath, likewiſe, the BEST Evidence of being TRUE, which, if I miſtake not, is, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily, the Caſe in England; it is, <hi>ſurely,</hi> the <hi>Duty</hi> of thoſe, who are the <hi>Clergy</hi> of the Eſtabliſhment, to point out its <hi>various Excellencies</hi>; and it is as plainly the Duty of <hi>thoſe,</hi> who are its <hi>legal Guardians,</hi> to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its <hi>avowed Enemies</hi> from intruding into Stations, whence they might be able to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail it with weapons <hi>very different</hi> from <q rend="inline">the <hi>Sword of the Spirit.</hi>

the Cauſe of Truth, injure the <hi>equally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Cauſe</hi> of <hi>univerſal, tender, heaven directed Charity</hi> towards all the Deſcendants of Adam.

            <p>Let us, therefore, extend to Sectaries, and Diſſenters of every Denomination, thoſe Indulgences which, (when they were tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, and the Church was in the Duſt) <hi>we did not enjoy</hi>; and whilſt Duty requires us to <hi>expoſe</hi> their <hi>Errors,</hi> and to <hi>repel</hi> their <hi>Encroachments</hi>; Let our Conduct convince ſuch of them as are <hi>open to Conviction,</hi> that we can <hi>love the Men,</hi> whoſe <hi>Principles we diſapprove.</hi>
