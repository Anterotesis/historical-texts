            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p n="1">1. I Know not of any human attempt which bears a better reſemblance to the knight of La Mancha's attack of a wind-mill, than that of combating vulgar errors; of reaſoning againſt received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. The moſt powerful and pointed arguments generally fall to the ground, when oppoſed by the impenetrable ſhield of common prejudice. Nevertheleſs, in the preſent age, when ſcience is hourly making ſuch rapid advances towards the diſcovery of truth; when knowledge is ſo much more univerſally diffuſed than in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0165700800:4"/>former times, it ſeems not unreaſonable to hope, that mankind may be perſuaded to beſtow a few moments unbiaſſed atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on a ſubject confeſſedly of the higheſt medical importance.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This ſubject hath indeed been amply and learnedly treated by ancient and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern phyſicians, in various countries and languages; in this kingdom particularly, by the celebrated Dr. Mead, and the no leſs famous Dr. James; the latter of whom publiſhed, in the year 1760, an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire volume on Canine Madneſs. Ancient authors were leſs diffuſe, and were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſatisfied with tranſcribing from each other. Moſt of theſe writers I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered with attention, and acknowledge myſelf much obliged to them for many important facts: I cannot, however, avoid obſerving, that their labours have a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt tendency to confirm the fatal preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice which I moſt devoutly wiſh to eradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; I therefore think myſelf juſtified in adding a ſmall pamphlet to the volumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous tracts already written on the diſeaſe commonly, but improperly, called the <hi>hydrophobia,</hi> or dread of water. I ſay
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0165700800:5"/>
               <hi>improperly,</hi> becauſe this averſion to water, or to drink of every kind, is only one <hi>ſymptom</hi> of the diſeaſe in queſtion, and that not conſtantly nor excluſively; for there are many examples on record, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently authenticated, of this ſymptom, this <hi>hydrophobia,</hi> in patients not bitten by a dog, or by any other animal.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I am even inclined to aſſert, that the <hi>hydrophobia</hi> is not generally a ſymptom of the diſeaſe produced by the bite of a mad dog. It rarely happens that the patient has any averſion to water or other liquid; until by experience he finds an inſuperable difficulty in ſwallowing. He then dreads the approach of water, having already found that the attempt to ſwallow any liquid produces a violent and painful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſion; ſo that the ſymptom in queſtion is rather a real difficulty of ſwallowing liquids, than a dread of water. As far as my own experience reaches, I can, with great truth, aver, that I have never yet met with a ſingle patient, who expreſſed any averſion to the ſight, ſound, or mention of water, until he had found, by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that drinking gave him pain.</p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0165700800:6"/>
            <p n="4">4. Some years ago, I was ſent for to a young gentleman, who, about ſix weeks before, had been bit in the arm by one of his father's hounds. A few hours before his death, he ſtept into a tub of warm water without fear, ſat down, and continued in it half an hour. I ſhall, in its proper place, relate his caſe circumſtantially: I mention it at preſent only to prove, that the <hi>hydrophobia</hi> is improperly conſidered as a diagnoſtic ſymptom of this diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I am equally inclined to diſpute the propriety of the denomination <hi>rabies ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nina,</hi> canine madneſs; for though perſons thus unhappily afflicted are often violently agitated during a ſhort time previous to their death, yet they generally retain their reaſon to the laſt moment: this diſeaſe, therefore, is improperly conſidered as a ſpecies of madneſs, if by madneſs we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, a diſtraction, ſuſpenſion, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the reaſoning faculties.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Writers, fond of ſearching into an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity for what is not worth finding, have taken great pains to diſcover the moſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient authors that have written on canine
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0165700800:7"/>madneſs. Hippocrates, moſt certainly, has not ſaid a ſingle word on the ſubject, whatever ſome of his wiſe commentators may have imagined. A learned liſt of ancient authors, who have written on the <hi>hydrophobia,</hi> may be collected from vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous modern writers; but we ſearch in vain for uſeful information on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject among the remains of high antiquity.</p>
            <p n="7">7. But if the diſeaſe we are about to inveſtigate be neither a ſpecies of <hi>rabies,</hi> nor <hi>hydrophobia,</hi> what ſhall we call it!— It were idle to diſpute about a mere name; but when a miſnomer conveys a falſe idea, it is no longer a matter of indifference. The fatal diſorder communicated to the human ſpecies by the bite of a mad dog is doubtleſs a ſpaſm of the organs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glutition and reſpiration; a ſpecies of <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina convulſiva, vel ſuffocativa.</hi> The generic term <hi>Angina,</hi> is thus defined by the learned Boerhaave, in his 783d apho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſm—<hi>Impedita valde, dolens admodum, vel et impedita et dolens ſimul, deglutitio atque reſpiratio, quae contingit a cauſa morboſa agente in partes binis his functionibus inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vientes, ſupra pulmones et ſupra ſtomachum
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0165700800:8"/>poſitas, Angina vocatur;</hi> and in aphoriſm 818, he ſays,—<hi>Si convulſionum cauſa quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque muſculos pharingis laryngeſve oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupaverit, oritur ſubita ſuffocativa an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gina.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="8">8. As I am here writing particularly to medical readers, it is unneceſſary to tranſlate the above quotation. Such read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, after comparing theſe definitions with the ſymptoms of the <hi>hydrophobia,</hi> as it is called, will, I believe, acknowledge their ſurpriſe, that Boerhaave ſhould not rather have claſſed it as a ſpecies of <hi>angina</hi> than of <hi>mania.</hi> Later noſologiſts ſeem equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate in point of arrangement. In the ſyſtem of the celebrated Sauvages, we find <hi>Hydrophobia</hi> in the claſs <hi>Veſaniae,</hi> and order <hi>Moroſitates.</hi> His definition of the claſs is, <hi>error in imaginatione, appetitu, vel juditio;</hi> of the order, <hi>cupiditates aut averſiones depravatae.</hi> Now, I appeal, not to ſyſtematic writers, but to thoſe who have attended patients ſuffering under this dreadful diſtemper; and I requeſt them to recollect, whether erroneous imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, appetite, or judgment, or depraved deſires or averſions, were among the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0165700800:9"/>they obſerved? As to the patient's refuſing to drink, it proceeds not from an imaginary averſion to water, but from a real, a painful convulſion in the organs of deglutition, excited by every effort to ſwallow liquids.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Linneus divides the diſeaſe in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into two diſtinct genera, <hi>viz. Rabies,</hi> and <hi>Hydrophobia:</hi> the firſt he defines in theſe words, <hi>Deſiderium mordendi laceran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dique innocuos;</hi> the ſecond, thus, <hi>Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatio potulentorum cum rigore et ſardiaſi,</hi> adding, <hi>ſoepius praecedenti maritata.</hi> He places them in the claſs <hi>Mentales,</hi> and order <hi>Pathetici,</hi> where, from what I have ſaid above, they muſt appear to have no buſineſs.</p>
            <p n="10">10. In Vogel's arrangement, under the claſs of <hi>Febres,</hi> and order <hi>continuae,</hi> we find the <hi>Hydrophobia</hi> thus characterized, <hi>Febris cum averſatione liquidorum, ſingultu, convulſione, et delirio.</hi> The abſurdity of making the hydrophobia a continued fever is ſo obvious, that it requires no comment.</p>
            <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0165700800:10"/>
            <p n="11">11. Dr. Cullen denominates his ſecond claſs of diſeaſes, <hi>neuroſes,</hi> which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines— <hi>Senſus et motus laeſi, ſine pyrexia et ſine morbo locali. Spaſmi</hi> conſtitute the third order of this claſs, and of this order, the laſt genus is <hi>hydrophobia,</hi> thus defined — <hi>Potionis cujuſlibet, ut convulſionem pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryngis dolentem cientis, faſtidium et horror; plerumque e morſu animalis rabidi.</hi> Of this genus he admits two ſpecies, <hi>viz. vulgaris,</hi> and <hi>ſpontanea,</hi> the firſt of which is the immediate object of our preſent conſideration.</p>
            <p n="12">12. Dr. Cullen, with his uſual ſaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, ſaw the error of former medical writers, who miſtook this ſpaſm in the organs of deglutition, for a ſpecies of madneſs.</p>
            <p n="13">13. But by what name ſoever we diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh this dreadful diſeaſe, previous to our enquiry concerning its ſymptoms in the human ſpecies, let us endeavour to aſcertain thoſe by which it may be known in the brute, where it originates.</p>
            <p>Authors have amuſed themſelves with learned diſquiſitions concerning the cauſe
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0165700800:11"/>of this <hi>rabies</hi> in dogs, wolves, foxes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Some accuſe worms within the cranium, or under the tongue. Dr. Cheyne aſcribed it to a ſuperabundance of animal ſalts, and Dr. James was of opinion that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream heat, want of water,<note place="margin">Treat. on canine madneſs, p. <hi>20</hi>
               </note> and putrid animal food, are generally the cauſe of this madneſs in dogs, which he calls a fever.</p>
            <p n="14">14. The uſual ſymptoms which indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate approaching madneſs in a dog, are, firſt, an evident diminution of his natural keen appetite for food. He eats, indeed, and laps his milk or water, but with obvious indifference. His eyes have loſt their uſual luſtre; he drops his ears and tail, ſhews no ſign of hilarity at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of his maſter, and his whole aſpect exhibits a picture of melancholy, perfectly intelligible to thoſe who are accuſtomed to obſerve this animal with attention. In a day or two more, he refuſes both meat and drink, ſhuns the ſociety of other dogs, and is equally, after a ſhort reconnoitre, avoided by them. He now quits his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, runs forward, evidently without having any thing in purſuit, ſnaps at every
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0165700800:12"/>animal that comes in his way, and within forty-eight hours dies convulſed.</p>
            <p n="15">15. Such are the ſymptoms of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper in the brute creation; and theſe ſymptoms are ſo conſtant and unequivocal, that all danger might eaſily be prevented, by the ſmalleſt degree of attention. In the firſt ſtage of the diſorder, the dog has no propenſity to bite, ſo that he may be ſeized and tied up without fear.</p>
            <p n="16">16. Boerhaave has collected from <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtorius</hi> and other writers, a catalogue of ſymptoms more numerous, and ſomewhat different from thoſe above enumerated; but as it was not the reſult of his own obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, his deſcription of this, as of many other diſeaſes, ſhould be read, <hi>cum grano ſalis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="17">17. Pliny,<note place="margin">Hiſt. nat. Lib. 29, c. 5.</note> in his chapter <hi>de medicina animalium,</hi> tells us, that there is a worm under the tongues of dogs, which if ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted when they are whelps prevents their running mad. This doubtleſs was a vulgar error of the times in which he wrote, and thus the univerſal prevalence
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0165700800:13"/>of this abſurd opinion down to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent age is accounted for. Dr. James very juſtly ridicules this idea of a worm under the tongue.<note place="margin">On can. mad. p. <hi>203.</hi>
               </note>—<q>"I take it (ſays the Doctor) to be a nerve; and this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting when recently taken away, the ideots fancy it ſtirs, and believe it a worm, towhich it bears no manner of reſemblance."</q>—He is certainly right in believing it not to be a worm; but he is miſtaken in ſuppoſing it a nerve, for a reaſon which himſelf hath adduced, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, its contraction; nerves are not elaſtic. He is alſo wrong in ſaying, it bears no reſemblance to a worm.<note place="margin">De ſed. &amp; cauſ. morb. lib. <hi>1.</hi> eſſ. <hi>viii.</hi> art. <hi>35.</hi>
               </note> Morgagni pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably was nearer the truth, in calling it a tendinous ligament. Be it what it may, it is certainly of uſe to the dog and its extirpation anſwers no ſalutary purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="18">18. Let us now trace the progreſs of this fatal diſeaſe in thoſe of the human ſpecies who have the misfortune to be bit by a mad dog or cat. The wound, on immediate inſpection, diſcovers no ſigns of malignity. If it be ſo ſuperficial as ſcarcely to have drawn blood it generally heals without the leaſt inflammation, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0165700800:14"/>in that caſe there is little or no danger: on the ſecond day it ſeems a mere ſcratch, and on the third it is hardly viſible. But if, on the ſecond morning, we obſerve an inflamed circle ſpreading from the wound, reſembling that which ſurrounds the puncture when inoculation for the ſmall-pox has taken effect, there is reaſon to believe that part of the poiſonous <hi>ſaliva</hi> of the enraged animal is abſorbed, and the conſequent ſymptoms may be rationally expected.</p>
            <p n="19">19. Meanwhile the patient takes the Ormſkirk, or ſome other equally infallible medicine, is hurried away to the ſea, in which he is two or three times dipped and half drowned; the wound heals, and all his apprehenſions vaniſh. Unhappily, this deluſion alſo vaniſhes in the ſpace of five or ſix weeks, about which period he feels a<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſymptom is ſaid to have been firſt mentioned by Salius.</note> pain in the part where he was bit, gradually extending over the whole limb. He now recollects his misfortune. The horrible ſtories he has heard ruſh upon his mind, and the hourly expectation of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0165700800:15"/>madneſs and death fill his whole ſoul. Under ſuch apprehenſions it is no wonder that he ſhould diſcover ſymptoms of impatience, anxiety, and even of delirium. But theſe ſymptoms proceed from, and are always in proportion to, his appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions. His reaſoning faculties continue unimpaired; his pulſe becomes irregular and quick; but there is no preternatural heat, foul tongue, nor any other febrile ſymptom. He complains of a fullneſs and prickling in his throat, and ſwallows his ſpittle with difficulty. So far from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing any averſion to water, he calls for drink; but in the attempt to ſwallow it he is convulſed, and, after two or three painful efforts, the approach, or even the ſight of any liquid produces horror. He continues ſome time longer to ſwallow ſolid food without much pain or difficulty. At laſt even that is impoſſible. He now becomes ſenſible of an irreſiſtable inclination to ſtruggle, and wiſhes to be held; he breathes quick and with great difficulty, and in a few hours after dies convulſed, as if he were ſtrangled with a cord.</p>
            <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0165700800:16"/>
            <p n="20">20. Such, and ſuch only, are the proper diagnoſtic ſymptoms of this fatal diſorder: they are amply ſufficient to diſtinguiſh it from any other, and are therefore all that are neceſſary to be generally known; but as a diſeaſe ſo frequently mortal cannot be too well underſtood, I ſhall proceed to mention the ſymptoms above omitted, as I find them enumerated by the principal authors that have written on this ſubject.</p>
            <p n="21">21. <hi>Coelius Aurelianus,</hi> who collected his hiſtory of the <hi>hydrophobia</hi> from <hi>Eudemus, Soranus,</hi> and other writers with whom we are little acquainted, tells us that the <hi>hydrophobia</hi> is immediately pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by extreme irritability, unuſual motions of the body, diſturbed ſleep or abſolute wakefulneſs, indigeſtion, ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yawning, nauſea, imaginary notions of bad weather, and no appetite for drink. To theſe ſymptoms, according to the ſame author, ſucceed, when the <hi>hydro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phobia</hi> begins, a deſire to drink<note n="*" place="bottom">Appetentia bibendi, <hi>which Dr. James tranſlates,</hi> a violent and inſatiable thirſt.—Treat. On Can, Madn. p. <hi>55.</hi>
               </note>, with terror at the ſight, ſound, or name of water. The patient is afraid even of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0165700800:17"/>fomentations with oil; his pulſe is denſe <hi>(denſus)</hi> ſmall and irregular: ſometimes a ſmall degree of fever, convulſive motions of the ſtomach, ſpaſms in the precordia, numbneſs of the joints, and torpor of the inteſtinal canal; frequent inclination to make water; trembling and catchings of the limbs; voice hoarſe, reſembling the barking of a dog; ſpiral poſture of the body, like that of a dog lying on the ground; anxiety when any perſon enters the room, as if apprehenſive that he ſhould bring water; redneſs of the face and eyes; body emaciated, the ſuperior parts pale and ſweating; <hi>veretri frequens tenſio cum ſeminis involuntario jactu,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="22">22. To the ſymptoms above mentioned Boerhaave adds the following—Laſſitude,<note place="margin">Aphor. 1138.</note> weight, and indolence in every muſcle of the body; diſturbed ſleep, frequent ſtartings, frightful dreams, convulſions; conſtant inquietude, depreſſion, ſighing, and love of ſolitude. If the patient be bled, the blood exhibits no morbid ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. He now complains of a ſqueez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about his heart. He is terrified not only at the ſight of any fluid, but even of
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0165700800:18"/>any pellucid or reflecting body. He vomits viſcid bilious phlegm or poraceous bile; grows hot and feveriſh. To a gradual exacerbation of theſe ſymptoms are now accumulated a dry projected tongue, open foaming mouth, extreme thirſt, an irreſiſtable inclination to ſpit at, and bite thoſe that are near him; cold ſweats, complete <hi>rabies,</hi> and on the fourth day the patient dies.</p>
            <p n="23">23. Dr. Mead copies Boerhaave without any material alteration, except in ſaying that death relieves the patient in two days after the firſt ſymptom of <hi>hydrophobia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sauvages, in his <hi>Noſologia,</hi> adds no other ſymptom to thoſe above related; but from Dr. James we learn the following very curious and material proof of the ſalutary inſtinct of dogs, namely, that they fly from perſons actually infected by the bite of a mad animal.</p>
            <p n="24">24. Such readers as are not acquainted with medical authors, and particularly with the writings of the celebrated Leyden profeſſor, will wonder why he
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0165700800:19"/>ſhould have exhibited ſo numerous a catalogue of ſymptoms, if it be true, that ſo few of them really occur in patients afflicted with this malady. But his wonder will ceaſe, when he is told that Boer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haave, when he began the ſtudy of phyſic, found the ſcience a mere chaos. He immediately conceived the idea of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it to method, and, after much reading, condenſed and arranged his materials in the form of aphoriſms, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting a new ſyſtem of phyſic, which aphoriſms he uſed as the text of his acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical lectures. All his ſymptoms very ſeldom occur in the ſame patient: they were collected from a variety of authors, and are to be remembered by phyſicians, rather as poſſible <hi>phenomena</hi> than as abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute diagnoſtics.</p>

            <p n="34">34. On the authority, therefore, of Morgagni, who was a man of moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive anatomical reading and experience, we muſt conclude, that diſſections have not hitherto diſcovered the part, or parts, of the human body particularly affected, or injured, and conſequently no curative indication can thence be deduced.

                  <hi>Aph.</hi> 1142.</note> from the hiſtory and compariſon of the <hi>hydrophobia</hi> with other diſeaſes, was induced to believe, that it is firſt an affection of the nerves; that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of the <hi>viſcera</hi> are thence produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that the blood and humours thence become vitiated; but that the primary ſeat of the diſorder is in the region of the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0165700800:25"/>ſtomach. In this laſt part of his theory, he followed the opinion of <hi>Arthemidorus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Coel. Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel. Lib. <hi>iii.</hi> c. <hi>14.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Artorius,</hi> and the diſciples of <hi>Aſclepiades.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="36">36. Dr. Mead was perſuaded,<note place="margin">Mechan. Acc. of Poiſons. Eſſay, <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> that the ſeat of the diſeaſe is in the nervous fluid, contaminated by the ſaliva of the dog act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as a ferment, and gradually aſſimilat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole to its own degree of morbid acrimony.</p>
            <p n="37">37. Dr. James ridicules theſe opinions, and roundly declares,<note place="margin">P. 37.</note> that <q>"he does not believe one ſyllable of the modern doctrine of nervous juices and nervous diſtempers."</q> Previous to the diſplay of his own theory, in order to render it intelligible to readers unacquainted with anatomy, he tranſlates, from Boerhaave's preface to his <hi>collection of authors on the venereal diſeaſe,</hi> a minute deſcription of the cellular membrane; to which he adds two pages more, on the ſame ſubject, from Cheſelden. The firſt of theſe begins thus—<q>"This membrane is of a vaſcular contexture,"</q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is certainly not true. If Dr. James had ever read ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon a book as Haller's <hi>Primae Lineae,</hi> he
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0165700800:26"/>would not have quoted Boerhaave and Cheſelden on this occaſion. His theory, however, is briefly this—The poiſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the ſaliva of the mad dog is communicated through the wound made by his teeth to the fat contained in the cellular membrane, which fat, by fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation with the ſaliva, is aſſimilated into a poiſon; now this fat being mixt with the blood, and conveyed to the liver, by the <hi>vena portarum,</hi> the bile is contami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and neceſſarily produces all the ſymptoms obſervable in canine madneſs.</p>
            <p n="38">38. To render this theory more intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, the Doctor informs the ignorant reader,<note place="margin">P. 77.</note> 
               <q>"that there is a perpetual inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe betwixt the blood veſſels and the cellular membrane, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently between the contents of both, the blood and fat."</q>—It is ſomewhat ſingular, that this poiſoned fat ſhould, in its paſſage to the liver, mix with the blood without injuring that fluid, which throughout the entire progreſs of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe is found to differ in nothing from that of a perſon in health. This obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle was too obvious to eſcape the Doctor;
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0165700800:27"/>but he tumbles over it very clumſily: he ſuppoſes, notwithſtanding appearances, that the blood muſt be ultimately viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by the bile; ſo that the blood firſt vitiates the bile, and the bile returns the compliment to the blood.</p>
            <p n="39">39. Thus, then, according to Dr. James, the liver is the primary ſeat and fountain of the hydrophobia, which <hi>viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus,</hi> he tells us,<note place="margin">P. 82.</note> 
               <q>"ſupplies the reſt of the body with bile in immenſe quantities."</q> In what phyſiological ſchool the Doctor learnt that the reſt of the body is ſupplied with bile in immenſe quantities is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to imagine. I know of no part of the body which is ſupplied with bile except the <hi>duodenum,</hi> where, mixing with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted aliment iſſuing from the ſtomach, part of it is converted into chyle, and thereby bereft of all its bilious qualities, and the remainder carried through the inteſtinal canal, and finally ejected: ſo that no bile, <hi>quaſi</hi> bile, is abſorbed, and conſequently no part of the body except the inteſtinal canal is ſupplied with this fluid.</p>
            <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0165700800:28"/>
            <p n="40">40. But, if it be true that the liver is the part of the body chiefly affected in the human ſpecies, we may, I think, fairly conclude, that this <hi>viſcus</hi> is alſo the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary ſeat of the diſorder in dogs. Now, it is very certain, that the liver of a mad dog, ſuppoſed to be an infallible remedy againſt canine madneſs, hath been frequently eaten without any bad effect.</p>
            <p n="41">41. There is yet another objection to Dr. James's <hi>hypotheſis,</hi> which the ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomical reader will probably think of ſome weight.—Page 78 of his treatiſe, he tells us, that <q>"the poiſonous ſaliva ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to the tooth of a dog is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately communicated to the fat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiding in one or more of the cells of the cellular membrane;" that "a ſcratch is ſufficient, if it only raiſe the cuticle, without drawing a drop of blood;" for (continues the Doctor) this ſubtile poiſon, as well as the venereal venom, is capable of entering the cellular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane when applied to any part not covered by the <hi>cuticula.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0165700800:29"/>
            <p n="42">42. Is it poſſible that Dr. James, the author of a medical dictionary in three folio volumes, ſhould not have known, that there is no external part of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body which is not covered by the cuticle. That he was really ignorant of this fact is ſtill more evident from the following paſſage in his 16th page—After relating a caſe from Van Swieten, who quotes it from <hi>Palmarius,</hi> of ſeveral chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren having caught the <hi>hydrophobia</hi> by kiſſing their father, who had been bit by a mad dog, he ſays—<q>"In this caſe it is very poſſible that ſome of the frothy ſaliva might be conveyed to the lips or the mouth of the children, which, <hi>not being defended by the cuticle,</hi> might communicate the contagion, as it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens with reſpect to the venereal poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon."</q> —Now, it is not only certain that the <hi>glans penis,</hi> the lips, and mouth, are covered by the cuticle, but that it is continued through the fauces, <hi>oeſophagus</hi> and inteſtinal canal.</p>
            <p n="43">43. But the Doctor aſſures us that, for the ſaliva of the dog to poiſon the fat, <q>"a ſcratch is ſufficient, if it only raiſes the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0165700800:30"/>cuticle."</q> Surely, the Doctor had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got, that the cellular membrane, with which he took ſo much pains to make his readers acquainted, and in which the fat reſides, adheres to the <hi>internal</hi> ſurface of the <hi>cutis vera,</hi> which therefore muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily be perforated before the ſaliva can be brought into contact with the fat.</p>
            <p n="44">44. If Dr. James had been at all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the abſorbent lymphatic veſſels, whoſe extremities perforate the cuticle in every part of the ſurface of the body, he would not have deemed thoſe parts only which he ſuppoſed deſtitute of this external ſhield ſuſceptible of the canine poiſon. Though the medical world be much indebted to the minute enquiries of Doctors Monro and Hunter for a more perfect intelligence of the lymphatic ſyſtem, yet the abſorption of fluids through the pores of the ſkin hath been generally known, even prior to the days of Galen, who, as a proof of this fact,<note place="margin">Gal. de uſu puls. c. <hi>5.</hi>
               </note> ſays—<hi>Si ſitiens balneum ineat, illi ſitis ſedabitur.</hi> Innumerable experiments have been made by later writers in order to eſtabliſh this doctrine, particularly by
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0165700800:31"/>Boyle, Bellini, and many others.<note place="margin">Phil. Tr. No. <hi>II.</hi>
               </note> In the Philoſophical Tranſactions we read of men working in quickſilver mines, whoſe bodies had imbibed ſo much of that metal, that they changed the colour of braſs by rubbing it with their hands, or even by breathing upon it. We know that by handling turpentine the urine acquires a violet ſmell; that tobacco will vomit, and aloes purge, when externally ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied; but the fact moſt univerſally known is the conſtant effect of mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial unction.</p>
            <p n="45">45. Hence it is evident that the <hi>cuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cula,</hi> or <hi>epidermis,</hi> as it was called by the Greeks, is no defence againſt the canine, or any other poiſon, if the application be continued ſufficiently to give time for its abſorption: it is therefore neceſſary, when the <hi>ſaliva</hi> of a mad dog touches any part of the ſkin, to wipe it off immediately, and waſh the ſpot. The examples, indeed, of perſons thus infected without a wound are not numerous, becauſe thoſe on whoſe hand or face the <hi>ſaliva</hi> reſts naturally wipe it off before it can be abſorbed.</p>
            <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0165700800:32"/>
            <p n="46">46. But, in defence of Dr. James it may be urged, that, whether the cuticle be pervious or not, or in whatſoever manner the canine poiſon paſs the <hi>cutis,</hi> it proves nothing againſt that part of his <hi>hypotheſis</hi> which eſtabliſhes the fat as the immediate receptacle of the poiſon, and its future vehicle to the liver.</p>
            <p n="47">47. In reply to this defence, it will be ſufficient to obſerve, that the bibulous lymphatics, by which fluids on the ſurface of the body are abſorbed, do not diſcharge their contents into the cellular texture, but, creeping along its membranes, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with larger veins which ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate in the <hi>receptaculum chyli,</hi> the thoracic <hi>duct,</hi> or jugular vein; ſo that the canine poiſon, or any other fluid, abſorbed from the ſurface of the body, cannot remain in a ſtate of extravaſation with the fat in the cellular web, but muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily be thrown into the general maſs of circulating fluids<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>"I ſhall avail myſelf (ſays Dr. James) of but one more argument to illuſtrate the probability of the canine venom being received and foſtered in the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane which contains the fat, or rather in the fat itſelf. And this I draw from the method of cure; for that very medicine which cures the venereal diſeaſe, whoſe reſidence is in the fat, is alſo found effectual in preventing and even curing canine madneſs."</q>— Unfortunately for this argument the venereal diſeaſe <hi>does not</hi> reſide in the fat.</note>.</p>

            <p n="48">48. Dr. James's theory, therefore, being contradicted by anatomical demonſtration, neceſſarily falls to the ground. The hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis of Boerhaave, Mead, and others, who ſuppoſed the ſeat of the diſeaſe to be in the nervous fluid, is equally inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, becauſe no ſuch fluid circulates in the nerves, which are not tubes but ſolid fibres, whoſe extremities therefore are incapable of abſorption.</p>
            <p n="49">49. If theſe theories be falſe, thoſe who read for information will aſk, where lies the truth? If ſuch readers have ſufficiently attended to the 47th paragraph they will eaſily conceive that the poiſonous ſaliva of the dog is abſorbed by the capillary lymphatic veins, whoſe ramifications ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pand to every part of the ſurface of the human body; thoſe veins which imbibe the matter communicated by inoculation, the venereal <hi>virus,</hi> water, and infectious <hi>miaſmata</hi> from the air.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0165700800:34"/>
            <p n="50">50. But, if this be true, why is it neceſſary, in order to communicate the ſmall pox by inoculation, that the cuticle ſhould be raiſed?—I anſwer: It is not neceſſary; but that by this operation the communication of the diſeaſe is rendered more certain, becauſe the matter being lodged under the cuticle, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining its moiſture, continues longer in a fit ſtate for abſorption.</p>
            <p n="51">51. If it ſhould be further aſked, why the canine poiſon, thus introduced, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues circulating in the body five or ſix weeks before it produces that diſeaſe, of a ſingle paroxiſm, called the <hi>hydrophobia?</hi> —I anſwer, that in this it differs from other inoculated diſeaſes only in point of time, In all inoculations there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of ſome days between the cauſe and effect; but why that of canine madneſs requires a longer time for aſſimilation and maturity muſt remain a myſtery, until we are better acquainted with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's <hi>modus operandi.</hi> Probably there are other contagious diſeaſes whoſe malignant <hi>miaſmata</hi> may be equally ſlow in their progreſs from admiſſion to efficiency.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0165700800:35"/>
            <p n="52">52. Some attempts have been made to diſcover the nature of this canine poiſon by the help of microſcopes and chemical experiments; but to no purpoſe. Dr. Mead ſuppoſed it to conſiſt of fiery ſaline particles.<note place="margin">Diſſert. Med. de rab. can. Edinb. <hi>1771.</hi>
               </note> Dr. Heyſham believes it to be an acid; but this is mere conjecture. All we know of the matter is, that it is a poiſon <hi>ſui generis,</hi> which, being abſorbed by the lymphatic veins, produces certain effects in the human body; no mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical nor chemical theory, therefore, can aſſiſt us in the invention of a remedy againſt the bite of a mad dog. Analogy may poſſibly be of ſome uſe. Chance, the great inventor of medicines, hath not, I think, been ſucceſsful in the preſent caſe. Let us, however, proceed to the moſt important, the therapeutic diviſion of our eſſay.</p>
            <p n="53">53. Mithridates, king of Pontus, about two thouſand years ago, is ſaid to have invented that farrago of more than forty ingredients called by his name. Hiſtorians tell us that, believing it to be an univerſal antidote, he took a doſe of it every morning. In juſtice however to his
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0165700800:36"/>Pontic majeſty, I muſt not ſuppreſs what <hi>Samonicus</hi> writes on this ſubject. <q>"When Pompy (ſays he) took the baggage of Mithridates, he found, among his papers, the preſcript for compounding the famous antidote againſt all poiſons, invented by that king: he was much ſurpriſed to find that it conſiſted only of twenty leaves of rue, two walnuts, two figs, and a little ſalt."</q> To whoſe inventive genius we are indebted for the forty ingredients which were afterwards added I know not, unleſs to that of <hi>Damocrates,</hi> under whoſe name this cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated antidote ſhines conſpicuous even in the laſt edition of the London <hi>Phar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macopoeia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="54">54. <hi>Andromachus,</hi> a native of Crete, cotemporary with Galen, not ſatisfied with an antidote of forty-five ingredients, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed one of more than ſixty, which he called <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="55">55. If the inventors of <hi>theriacas</hi> had any ideas at all, they probably thought that, in ſo great a number of ingredients, it was poſſible ſome one of them might hit the mark they aimed at, for the ſame reaſon that ſportſmen prefer a number of ſmall ſhot to a ſingle bullet; but I am rather inclined to think them the inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome arch apothecary's apprentice, who had a mind to try what ſort of a medicine he could produce by jumbling together every drug in the ſhop. Be their origin however what it might, they are certainly the oldeſt antidotes upon record, and, from the proportion of opium they contain, might poſſibly alleviate the ſpaſmodic ſymptoms incidental to the bite of a viper, or of a mad dog.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0165700800:38"/>
            <p n="56">56. <hi>Dioſcorides</hi> wrote a treatiſe on the <hi>Theriaca,</hi> in the ſecond chapter of which he recommends, as a medicine that might be depended on for the bite of a mad dog, two ſpoonfuls of the aſhes of the river crab, with half the quantity of gentian, to be taken in a large glaſs of wine.<note place="margin">De ſimpl. med. facul.</note> Galen preſcribes the ſame medicine, with the addition of a ſmall quantity of frankin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe: the crabs he burnt alive in a copper diſh, after the riſing of the ſtar <hi>Sirius,</hi> when the ſun was in the conſtellation <hi>Leo,</hi> and on the eighteenth day of the moon.

            <p n="57">57. Dr. Mead is of opinion that this remedy is recommended by the ancients upon rational grounds, becauſe it is a diuretic; <q>"For (ſays he) "the ſureſt reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in all ages againſt this venom have been ſuch as provoke a great diſcharge by urine."</q> Reflecting on this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0165700800:39"/>this <hi>Eſculapius</hi> of his times, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the great idea of recommending to the world his infallible <hi>Pulvis Antyliſſus,</hi> which, at the doctor's requeſt, was ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured with a place in the London <hi>Pharmacopoeia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="58">58. Whence did Dr. Mead conclude that this powder of calcined river crabs, or crawfiſh (for ſuch he ſuppoſes them to have been) would <hi>promote a great diſcharge of urine?</hi> He certainly thought that this calcination, like the incineration of vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, would produce an alkaline ſalt. If he had poſſeſſed the leaſt degree of chemical knowledge, he would have known that the animal itſelf would burn to a mere earth, totally inert, and that its ſhell would be converted into quick lime, of which conſequently, with a very ſmall proportion of earth, this ſpecific muſt conſiſt.</p>
            <p n="59">59. Dr. James's chemical knowledge appears to have been not much inferior to that of Dr. Mead, whom he thinks to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally wrong in tranſlating the <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Dioſcorides,</hi> and Galen, <hi>River Crawfiſh.</hi> He is clearly of opinion, and
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0165700800:40"/>takes ſome pains to prove, that theſe authors meant a ſpecies of river crab, and not crawfiſh. Dr. James prudently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that we ought to be very accurate in our quotations from ancient authors, <q>"leſt the medicine recommended be miſtaken for ſomething that may not poſſeſs the ſame virtues."</q> This is doubtleſs a wiſe obſervation; but any chemiſt's boy would have told him, that the virtues, whatever they may be, of a calcined crawfiſh, crab, or oiſter, are exactly the ſame; that all ſhells are calca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious earth, and conſequently burn to quick lime, in no reſpect different from that produced by the calcination of chalk, lime-ſtone, or marble. But, that Dr. James, as well as Dr. Mead, ſuppoſed that this calcination of river crabs produced an alkaline ſalt is evident from the following paſſage. Speaking of this powder, he ſays — <q>"I believe it may have ſome efficacy in preventing the canine madneſs,<note place="margin">P. 215.</note> though none that can be depended upon. This opinion is founded on its being an highly alkaline ſubſtance; and all or moſt of the pretended ſpecifics for this diſtemper are alkaline, and deſtroyers of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0165700800:41"/>acids; as the celebrated pancake made of oiſter-ſhells, mentioned by Deſſault, <hi>Armenian Bole, Tin,</hi> and many other."</q> Theſe laſt words put the doctor's ſkill in chemiſtry quite out of doubt.</p>
            <p n="60">60. But, as we can hardly ſuppoſe that Dioſcorides and Galen ventured to give their patients two ſpoonfuls of quick lime, it is probable that they did not calcine theſe crabs, or crawfiſh, ſufficiently to convert the ſhells into lime, though long enough to diſſipate the volatile parts of the animal. On this ſuppoſition this ſpecific powder becomes a mere abſorbent earth, a <hi>pulvis è chelis cancrorum,</hi> poſſeſſed of no diuretic virtue; yet Galen pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces it infallible.<note place="margin">De ſimpl. med facul.

            </p>
            <p n="61">61. The next diuretic antidote of the ancients, <q>"recommended (as Dr. Mead thinks) upon rational grounds,"</q> is the <hi>Spongia Cynorrhodi,</hi> ſponge of the dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, <q>"Which (ſays the Doctor) is ſo celebrated an antidote, that <hi>P.

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0165700800:42"/>with the ſame name, and equally inſignificant in its medical capacity. Theſe <hi>panaceas</hi> are generally good for nothing. But Dr. Mead ranks this gall of the briar among his animal diuretics, becauſe Mr. Ray found it to be the nidus of a fly.— <q>"Now (ſays the Doctor) all inſects abound with a diuretic ſalt."</q>—If the lie direct were admiſſible in polite conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, I would ſay, <hi>this is not true.</hi> But I marvel exceedingly that he did not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that this <hi>Sanatodos</hi> of the Sicilians is called in England a <hi>Dog</hi>-roſe, becauſe it produces a medicine for a mad-<hi>dog:</hi> alſo, that he forgot to inform his readers, that this celebrated antidote originated in the dream of an old woman, as he muſt have read in Pliny.</p>
            <p n="62">62. Dr. Mead, after ſpecifying, from the ancients, other diuretics, which cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly are <hi>not</hi> diuretics, proceeds to the recommendation of his infallible <hi>Pulvis Antilyſſus,</hi> which he declared never failed of ſucceſs, though he had uſed it a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times. <q>"I have often wiſhed (adds the Doctor) that I knew ſo certain a remedy in any other diſeaſe."</q>—Surely
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0165700800:43"/>ſuch teſtimony, from ſo great a phyſician, muſt be more than ſufficient to eſtabliſh the infallibility of any medicine beyond all ſuſpicion: and yet two greater men, Boerhaave and Van Swieten,<note place="margin">Aph. 1147.</note> are of opinion that it is good for nothing; and Dr. James aſſures us, that <q>"it has been given,<note place="margin">Pa. 227.</note> without ſucceſs, to a great number of people and animals in many parts of the kingdom."</q>
            </p>
            <p n="63">63. This infallible <hi>Pulvis Antilyſſus</hi> is preſcribed by Dr. Mead in the following words— <q>"Take of the herb called, in Latin, <hi>Lichen cinereus terreſtris,</hi> in Engliſh, Aſh-coloured ground-liver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, cleaned, dried, and powdered, half an ounce; of black pepper pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, two drachms.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0165700800:45"/>I think, juſtly proceed to the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the infallible <hi>Pulvis Antilyſſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="65">65. But Dr. Mead, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the world that he had not adopted this medicine without proper ſcientific inveſtigation, informs his readers, that he examined the <hi>Lichen cinereus terreſtris</hi> by diſtillation, and that the reſult of his ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyſis was, ſome acid water, ſome oil, and ſome coal that contained fixt ſalt. A bunch of docks, of nettles, of thiſtles, or of any other common weed, would have yielded the ſame. This ſort of analyſis can be of no uſe in diſcovering the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal virtues of plants. The receipt to make this celebrated <hi>Pulvis Antilyſſus</hi> was firſt brought to England by Captain Dampier, who called the plant Jew's Ear (<hi>Tremella auricula</hi> of <hi>Linnaeus</hi>) a kind of aſh-coloured fungus, which is frequently found on the trunks of old trees. But it ſeems Sir Hans Sloane was of opinion that the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was miſtaken; that he certainly meant the aſh-coloured Liverwort, which, on the authority of ſo great a naturaliſt, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly adopted. Is it not probable from this hiſtory, that, in rejecting the
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0165700800:46"/>original Jew's Ear, Dr. Mead ſeized the ear of the wrong ſow?</p>
            <p n="66">66. The next infallible medicine I ſhall examine is that which, about thirty years ago, was brought from Tonquin by Sir George Cobb, when he returned from the Eaſt Indies. It conſiſts of native and factitious Cinnabar each twenty-four grains, with ſixteen grains of Muſk, powdered and mixt well together. This doſe is to be taken in a glaſs of Arrack once only, and repeated after an interval of thirty days The abſurdity of making any diſtinction between <hi>native</hi> and <hi>factiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Cinnabar, which are preciſely the ſame thing, is too obvious to need a commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary: it proves, however, the ignorance of the Chineſe old woman who probably invented the medicine, and of all thoſe who in preſcribing this powder have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to obſerve the ſame ridiculous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction. But, in the compoſition of this ſpecific, there is another abſurdity of more importance. All the cinnabars, whether <hi>native, factitious,</hi> or of cinnabar of <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> are mere powder of poſt; abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely inert.</p>
            <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0165700800:47"/>
            <p n="67">67. <q>"Factitious cinnabar (ſays Dr. James) is made of three parts of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury to one of ſulphur; and,<note place="margin">Pa. 155.</note> as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, a pound of good native cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar yields near fourteen ounces of fluid mercury; and therefore it ſeems that the good effects of this medicine ought to be principally, if not entirely, aſcribed to mercury."</q>—Dr. James, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolved to ſport a preparation of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury as the only ſpecific for canine mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was quite ſatisfied with this ſort of reaſoning: but <hi>we</hi> muſt come nearer to the point.</p>
            <p n="68">68. Native cinnabar is the ore of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury; that is, mercury mineralized by ſulphur, in the proportion of about ſix, ſeven, or eight parts of the former to one of the latter.—Sulphur poſſeſſes the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar property, in combination with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury or antimony, of rendering both theſe violent metallic ſubſtances inactive. It is particularly well known of antimony that it is more or leſs mild in proportion as the <hi>regulus</hi> is combined with more or leſs ſulphur. This chemical fact Dr. James muſt have known, if he had underſtood
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0165700800:48"/>the proceſs for making his own fever-powder. But mercury, before it can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert its ſtimulant power, muſt not only be completely extricated from the ſulphur with which it formed cinnabar, but muſt afterwards be divided by trituration, or diſſolved in a mineral acid. Now, the only means of decompoſing cinnabar is by fire, in, what is called by chemiſts, the dry way. In the human body, therefore, it is impoſſible; but if we could ſuppoſe the mercury actually ſeparated from the ſulphur, not being diſſolved by a mineral acid, or otherwiſe divided, it would ſtill remain in a ſtate of total inactivity: <hi>a priori,</hi> therefore, cinnabar may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced inert.</p>
            <p n="69">69. But, leſt the advocates for this Tonquin medicine ſhould deem this ſort of philoſophical argument inconcluſive, let us take the opinions of a few eminent chemiſts on the ſubject.<note place="margin">Pa. 451.</note>—Dr. Cullen, in his Lectures on <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> ſpeaking of mercurial preparations, ſays— <q>"Crude mercury, and the combination in cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar and <hi>Aethiops mineralis,</hi> to which may be added <hi>Aethiops antimonialis,</hi> in

This I could determine <hi>à priori,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was in the form of Aethiops mineral, or native or factitious cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar."</q>—Dr. Lewis in his Diſpenſatory tells us, that <q>"cinnabar, like Aethiops,<note place="margin">Pa. 331.</note> is inactive."</q>—Cartheuſer, having given a large quantity to a dog, ſays, that it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced no ſenſible effect, but that part of it paſſed through the inteſtines unaltered, and that the remainder was found in the ſtomach and bowels.—Dr. Longfield, whom I have before mentioned, wrote the following note on the article <hi>cinnabaris factitia</hi> in the <hi>Pharm. Col. Reg. Med. Londinenſis</hi>—<q>"It is a ſhame that the cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabars are not totally exploded: they have not the leaſt title to the character of nervous medicines; they are both inert."</q>—But it were unfair to conceal from the reader, that a famous German chemiſt of the laſt century was of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent opinion. He conſidered cinnabar as an efficacious medicine, and aſcribed its virtue to its beautiful colour, with which
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0165700800:50"/>
               <hi>Archeus</hi> is ſo charmed as to neglect the diſeaſe which he was employed in exiting; for it ſeems this <hi>Archeus,</hi> this creature of Van Helmont's diſtempered brain, is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully delighted with the colour red.</p>
            <p n="70">70. In anſwer to all this reaſoning <hi>à priori,</hi> I ſhall be told, that experience is the only teſt, and that the inſtances upon record, of the hydrophobia being cured or prevented by the Tonquin powder are innumerable. In reply to this anſwer— <hi>Firſt,</hi> there are examples upon record of perſons having died of the hydrophobia after taking it, particularly in two caſes related in the London <hi>Medical Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Page <hi>195,</hi> and apen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix, p. <hi>3.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> many other medicines, equally infallible and equally extolled, have deſervedly ſunk into contempt: <hi>Thirdly,</hi> no atteſtation of facts will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince a rational being that an effect was produced without a ſufficient cauſe: now, a ſubſtance which is demonſtrably inert can produce no effect in an animal body, and therefore can cure no diſeaſe.</p>
            <p n="71">71. Cinnabar being thus, I think, fairly diſpatched, if there be any anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotal
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0165700800:51"/>power in the Tonquin medicine, it muſt be attributed to to the antiſpaſmodic virtue of the musk: Dr. James aſcribes it to its alkaline quality— <q>"Muſk (he tells us) is an animal ſubſtance, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of an alkaline nature; and as alkalies have in all ages been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended in this caſe, it ſeems at leaſt to be not prejudicial."</q>—This is <hi>damning muſk with faint praiſe.</hi> But what did the Doctor mean by aſcribing to it an alkaline quality becauſe it is an animal ſubſtance? Had he forgot that animal matter wants the aſſiſtance of fire to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce alkali? If every ſpecies of animal matter be an alkaline medicine, the parings of his own nails would have done as well. Muſk, however, is doubtleſs a powerful antiſpaſmodic, and for that reaſon may be of ſervice in the <hi>hydrophobia.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="72">72. This Tonquin powder is ordered to be taken in a glaſs of Arrack, doubtleſs with no other intention than to cover the taſte of the muſk. This vehicle, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſuggeſts an idea, which, though I may think it extravagant, I will commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate. Suppoſe, when the ſymptoms of

Who, without trying it, will pretend to circumſcribe the antiſpaſmodic effect of this remedy? It is certainly not contra-indicated by any febrile or mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acal ſymptoms. In a forlorn hope no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt can be too extravagant.

Having thus, I hope not unfairly, conſidered the pretenſions to infallibility of the ſpecifics introduced and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by particular men, we are come at laſt to that ſovereign remedy extolled by every writer on canine madneſs, ancient and modern, and uſed in all countries, in every age, from the days of Celſus to the preſent moment—I mean <hi>bathing in cold water.</hi> To this part of our ſubject I beg the reader's particular attention, becauſe I am very certain that many lives have been loſt by a fooliſh dependence on this broken reed. I have ſaid that all writers on canine madneſs, ancient and modern, have recommended cold-bathing; but I muſt except Dr. Falck, the author of <hi>The Seaman's Medical Inſtructor,</hi> and Dr. Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thergill, who wrote a paper in the <hi>London Medical Obſervations,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Vol. v. p. 290.</note> purpoſely to prove the inefficacy of bathing in the ſea.</p>
            <p n="81">81. The phyſician laſt mentioned was of opinion, that the practice of bathing
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0165700800:59"/>in ſalt-water, as a preſervative, originated in a miſtake. Celſus directs the patient,<note place="margin">Celſ. lib. <hi>v.</hi> c. <hi>27.</hi>
               </note> actually labouring under the hydrophobia, to be thrown unexpectedly into a fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond: if he cannot ſwim, he is to be ſuffered to flounce and drink, raiſing him a little now and then, ſo as to keep him from drowning; but, if he can ſwim, he is to be frequently ducked, that in ſpite of himſelf he may be ſatiated with water: <q>"Thus (ſays Celſus) his thirſt and dread of water will be cured at the ſame time."</q>
            </p>
            <p n="82">82. <hi>Celſus</hi> was miſtaken in ſuppoſing that he could force the patient to drink by holding him under water, or that, after being half drowned, he would look on water with leſs horrour, or ſwallow liquids with greater eaſe. The latter part of this diſcipline is daily practiſed, by the old women at the watering places, on the wretched creatures that are ſent by old women, male and female, from the inland country. This practice of drowning the patient in order to cure him of an averſion to water, abſurd as it is, was probably taken from <hi>Celſus,</hi> who, though a ſenſible
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0165700800:60"/>man, poſſibly without experience or much reflexion, preſcribed it on the authority of ſome Greek writer; but why the ſea was ſubſtituted for a fiſh-pond, and how it came to paſs that what <hi>Celſus</hi> ordered as a cure for the hydrophobia actually preſent, ſhould be applied as a prophy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lactic, a preſervative remedy, is difficult to conceive.</p>
            <p n="83">83. Who was the inventor of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſion in ſalt water I cannot determine. I am inclined to think that it originated in Holland or Flanders, in the days of panaceas, charms, witches, and hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblins. That it was a common practice in the Netherlands in the ſixteenth century appears from the following paſſage from Van Helmont; which, as his books are not in every library, and, I believe, were never <hi>done</hi> into Engliſh, I ſhall endeavour to tranſlate literally.—<q>"There is a fortreſs on the ſea-coaſt, about four leagues from Ghent, called Sluce. There I ſaw a ſhip paſſing by, and in it an old man, naked, bound, and weights faſtened to his feet. Under his arms they had tied a rope, the other end of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0165700800:61"/>which was fixed to the yard-arm of the veſſel. I aſked the meaning of this ſpectacle, and was anſwered by one of the ſailors, that the old man had got the <hi>hydrophobia,</hi> having, ſome time ago, been bit by a mad dog. Why, I aſked, is he brought to the ſea? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they meant to drown him? 'No, no, (ſaid the ſailor) he will ſoon be cured; ſuch is the bleſſing of God upon the ſea, that it will inſtantly cure this kind of madneſs.' At my requeſt they took me on board. We had ſcarce ſailed a mile, when the ſailors, by pulling out a plug in the bottom of the ſhip, let in the water, till ſhe ſunk almoſt to the edge of the gunwale. This ſea-water they collected for the purpoſe of making ſalt. The plug being now re-adapted, two men hauled down the oppoſite end of the yard, and thus hoiſted the old man into the air. They then let him drop into the ſea, and he remained under water <hi>ad ſpatium Miſerere.</hi> They repeated this operation twice more, keeping him each time under water <hi>ad ſpatium Salutationis Angelicae."</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0165700800:62"/>
            <p n="84">84. Some profane readers may poſſibly be inclined to comment ludicrouſly on this <hi>ſpatium Salutationis Angelicae;</hi> but, chooſing rather to treat the matter ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly, I requeſted a friend to read over the <hi>Miſerere,</hi>
               <note place="margin">

Van Helmont is not ſufficiently explicit in this important part of his narrative. Whether this was only a method of computing time, or whether theſe pſalms were actually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated during the immerſion, does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. I am inclined to think they were: if ſo, this capital omiſſion in our old women on the ſea coaſt ſufficiently ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts for their fallibility. But to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed with Van Helmont's ſtory.</p>
            <p n="85">85. <q>"They then laid him on his back acroſs a barrel, and covered him with a watch-coat. I concluded he was dead; but the ſailors ridiculed my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions. Being now releaſed from his bonds, he diſcharged all the water which he had <hi>inſpired,</hi> and preſently revived. He was a cooper from Ghent,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0165700800:63"/>and being cured of his <hi>hydrophobia,</hi> continued perfectly well."</q>
            </p>
            <p n="86">86. If the poor cooper remained long in that poſition, <hi>ſupino dorſo ſuper vas teres,</hi> I marvel that he ever recovered. That the Dutch ſailors ſhould believe that his lungs were full of water is no great wonder: Van Helmont ſhould have known better. There are, indeed, writers of ſome reputation, who tell us that they have found water in the lungs and ſtomach of drowned ſubjects; but, waving the improbability of the fact, later experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prove inconteſtably that drowning animals rarely imbibe any water; certainly no quantity to do them any injury. <hi>Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagni</hi> drowned guinea-pigs, hedge-hogs,<note place="margin">

The opinion that drowned perſons are full of water, erroneous as it certainly is, prevails ſo univerſally among the ignorant, that I am perſuaded many have been prevented from recovering by holding them up by the heels, or laying them on the ſide of a hill, with the head downwards.</p>
            <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0165700800:64"/>
            <p n="87">87. Theſe Dutch ſkippers told Van Helmont, that a ſalt herring applied imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to the wound was an infallible cure for the bite of a mad dog, and that half drowning in ſalt water was only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary when this remedy had been neglected; ſo that we have neither the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of Celſus, nor the practice of the Netherlands, to plead in favour of ſea-bathing as a preſervative. The caſe of this cooper, if we believe that he was really ſo mad as to require being fettered, affords a ſingular example of the hydrophobia actually cured by immerſion in ſalt water: it is indeed ſo ſingular, that I can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce but one more on any tolerable au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.

For theſe fourſcore years paſt they have been continually cutting off pieces from this holy veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; nevertheleſs it remains, to this day, perfectly entire. Now, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible there ſhould be any impoſture in the caſe; for they have never been able to diſcover whether this miraculous robe be of linen, woollen, or of ſilk, conſequently it cannot be annually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed. They cut off a piece of the robe, and incarnate a thread between the ſkin of the patient's forehead. Hence another miracle; for a perſon thus cured becomes poſſeſſed of a power to poſtpone the hydrophobia during forty days in any of his acquaintance, who, after being bitten, may not have leiſure immediately to viſit St. Hubert: on this condition, however, that if they exceed the forty days ever ſo little, without applying for a prorogation of the term, they go mad irrecoverably."</q>
            </p>
            <p n="94">94. Thoſe who are converſant with books on this ſubject, will aſk, why I have taken no notice of the celebrated
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0165700800:72"/>powder invented by Palmerius?—I have two reaſons: <hi>firſt,</hi> becauſe it <hi>deſerves</hi> no notice; <hi>ſecondly,</hi> becauſe it is never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in this kingdom, and therefore can do no miſchief. I have omitted ſeveral other <hi>infallible</hi> medicines for the ſame reaſon. An idle diſplay of medical eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition on ſo trite a ſubject were ridiculous. I ſat down ſolely with a deſign to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the leſs informed part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, that their opinions concerning the prevention of canine madneſs, or <hi>hydrophobia,</hi> are fatally erroneous, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as that dependence precludes the application of more rational means. I determined to employ a few leiſure hours on this ſubject, becauſe Boerhaave, Mead, and other phyſicians of high reputation, have authoriſed ſuch irrational dependence.</p>
            <p n="95">95. But this is not the ſole miſchief of which the erroneous opinions of eminent men are productive. Dr. Mead, fully perſuaded of the all-ſufficiency of his <hi>Pulvis Antilyſſus,</hi> endeavours moſt irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, to divert his readers from an attention to the wound. Theſe are his words—<q>"The ancient phyſicians,<note place="margin">P. 88.</note> who are
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0165700800:73"/>followed in this by the moderns, adviſe, where the place will admit of it, to enlarge the wound by inciſion; to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply a cupping-glaſs; to burn it with a hot iron, and to keep a diſcharge from the ulcer for many days. I cannot but ſay, that I think all this ſeverity uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs."</q>—<q>"It happens in moſt caſes that the wound, being ſmall,<note place="margin">P. 89.</note> is healed up before the patient ſeeks for help. For this reaſon, and becauſe it is of no great conſequence whether it be cured or not, in the paper which I printed and diſperſed ſome years ſince, entitled, <hi>A certain cure for the bite of a mad dog,</hi> I took no notice of any outward appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation."</q>—I will, without heſitation, venture to pronounce this the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious doctrine that ever was taught by any phyſician ancient or modern. It af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords one of the moſt flagrant examples in the annals of medicine, of a ſenſible man and a ſcholar ſacrificing his reaſon, his common ſenſe, to a preconceived hypotheſis. He imagined that the poiſon contained in the ſaliva of the inraged ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal contaminated a nervous fluid—which has no exiſtence; and that this poiſon
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0165700800:74"/>might be carried off by a diuretic medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine —which is certainly neither diuretic nor any thing elſe. He adviſed cold bathing, becauſe, on mechanical prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, he ſuppoſed that the external preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the water, by conſtringing the vaſcular ſyſtem, would determine the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregated poiſon to the kidneys, and ſo aſſiſt the operation of his <hi>Pulvis Antilyſſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="96">96. Before I preſcribe that which I conceive to be the only rational means of preventing the fatal effect of the bite of a mad dog, it is neceſſary that I ſhould anſwer a very natural queſtion.—If (ſays the reader) the ſeveral ſpecifics above con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned are really good for nothing, how comes it that ſo many perſons bit by mad dogs are daily cured by the Ormſkirk medicine, bathing in the ſea, &amp;c.? —If this were not what is called begging the queſtion, I ſhould be diſtreſſed for an anſwer; but the truth is, that all thoſe who believe themſelves cured by theſe futile preſervative remedies were never infected; and conſequently no harm would have happened, whether they had uſed them or not. Fortunately for mankind,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0165700800:75"/>not one in fifty of the dogs ſuppoſed to be mad are really mad; and of thoſe few that are ſo, their teeth are often wiped clean by the clothing of the perſon bit, and conſequently no inoculation takes place. It happens alſo, as in all other infectious diſeaſes, that the body is frequently not diſpoſed to receive the infection. Theſe, and theſe only, are the cauſes of all the tranſitory reputation which the various <hi>infallible</hi> medicines have from time to time acquired.</p>
            <p n="97">97. Nevertheleſs, as the caſe is always doubtful—as poſſibly the dog may be actually mad, and the poiſon really im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed, nothing can be more imprudent than to depend on the chance of its being otherwiſe: we are, therefore, to act as if we were certain that dog was a mad dog. The perſon bit muſt immediately apply his mouth to the wound, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to ſuck it during ten minutes or a quarter of an hour, frequently ſpitting out, and waſhing his mouth after each time with water, warm or cold, no matter which. If the wound be in a part of his body which he cannot reach with his
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0165700800:76"/>mouth, poſſibly he may prevail on ſome rational friend to do him this kind office; eſpecially when I aſſure him, poſitively aſſure him, that it may be done without the leaſt danger. My own ſon, then about eight years old, in returning from ſchool, was bit by a dog in the thigh. My eldeſt daughter, being informed of the accident, without the leaſt heſitation immediately ſucked the wound. She had heard me ſay it might be done with ſafety. The dog was certainly not mad; but I relate the ſtory in juſtice to her affectionate intrepidity, which, in a young girl, was ſomewhat extraordinary.</p>
            <p n="98">98. Neither ancient nor modern writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, if I remember right, have adviſed ſucking the wound received by the bite of a mad dog:<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> III. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> yet Galen, in his book <hi>de Temperaments,</hi> ſays, <hi>that the ſaliva of this animal is not equally dangerous when ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the ſtomach;</hi> therefore, it is probable that, in ſome part of his volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous writings, he may have mentioned this experiment. But, in the bite of a venomous ſerpent,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Lib.</hi> V. <hi>c.</hi> 27. P. 37.</note> Celſus, and after him Dr. Mead, lays great ſtreſs on this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0165700800:77"/>application. It is very extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, that in one caſe the Doctor ſhould deem it of ſo much, and in the other, of ſo little importance. The firſt of theſe authors aſſures us, that the Pſylli, a people who pretended to an hereditary and excluſive power of curing the bite of ſerpents by ſuction, owed their ſucceſs ſolely to their reſolution; for, ſays he, <hi>Venenum non guſtu, ſed in vulnere nocet;</hi> adding, <q>"whoever, therefore, ſucks the wound after the example of theſe Pſylli, will ſave his friend, and do himſelf no injury."</q>
            </p>
            <p n="99">99. Dr. Mead was informed by a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon who lived in Virginia,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mead,</hi> P. 40.</note> that the Indians there cure the bite of the rattle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſnake by firſt ſucking the wound<note n="*" place="bottom">This is alſo a common practice in the Highlands of Scotland. See <hi>Pennant's Tour. append.</hi> p. 275.</note>, and then ſwallowing a large quantity of a decoction of the rattle-ſnake root, ſo as to vomit plentifully. Now, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction contributes nothing towards the cure, I preſume will be readily admitted; ſucking the wound, therefore, is the ſole remedy, which was certainly dictated by
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0165700800:78"/>the natural ſagacity of this people. That this cure is effectual is confirmed by the caſe of a man in London, who, being bit by a rattle-ſnake brought from Virginia, ſucked the wound, and recovered. <q>"As the poiſon (ſays Dr. Mead) of this ſnake is more quick and deadly than any other that we know,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Mead,</hi> p. 38.</note> a remedy for this will moſt certainly prove effectual againſt that of ſmaller vipers, and all other creatures of this kind"</q>—and why not of every other kind? Was not the analogy ſufficiently obvious? If the poiſon of a ſerpent may be ſucked from a wound, is there any reaſon to imagine that the <hi>virus</hi> in the <hi>ſaliva</hi> of a dog may not? But then the infallible <hi>Pulvis Antilyſſus</hi> would have been of no uſe. Seriouſly, I believe, that if this ſimple operation were immediately and reſolutely performed, no other remedy would be required. The beſt medicines are often the moſt ſimple, and thoſe which are neareſt at hand. We are too apt ſuperciliouſly to overlook the ſimple dictates of nature and common ſenſe, to the diſcredit of our profeſſion, and the loſs of our patients. Art, chemiſtry, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds, and ſyſtems, are the hobby-horſes
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0165700800:79"/>of young phyſicians; and it is not till they have grown old in the profeſſion, that they return to Nature and Hippocrates.</p>
            <p n="100">100. But, though I have great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence on this ſimple preſervative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, we cannot be provided with too many weapons; offenſive and defenſive, againſt ſo formidable an enemy. Thoſe who want reſolution to attack the foe perſonally, will be glad of a ſubſtitute. That ſubſtitute is a cupping glaſs, or any other veſſel that will anſwer the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. If no ſurgeon be preſent take a pretty large piece of paper; twiſt it gently, ſo that it may eaſily be thruſt into a narrow-mouthed jug; light the paper well, and, having put it into the veſſel, fix it tight over the wound, and let it remain in that poſition till it may be eaſily taken off. Repeat this operation three or four times.</p>
            <p n="101">101. Ancient and modern writers on this ſubject have generally adviſed ſearing the wound with a hot iron; partly with a deſign to deſtroy the poiſon, but particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly with an intention to produce an
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0165700800:80"/>ulcer. This, I think not only an unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, but a pernicious act of cruelty. Let us ſuppoſe that a particle of the poiſon, ſufficient to communicate the diſeaſe, is abſorbed by a lymphatic vein, what will be the effect of the application of a red hot iron to the extremity of that vein, after ſuch abſorption? Will it not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſhrink and ſhrivel? and will not the reduction of the poiſonous <hi>fomes,</hi> by any external application, be thus effectually prevented?</p>
            <p n="102">102. The wound being now wiped dry with lint or tow, let two drachms of mercurial ointment be rubbed into it, and let the part be then covered by a bliſtering plaſter ſomewhat longer than the wound. As ſoon as a bladder is perceived to have riſen under the plaiſter, raiſe the edge of it, and let out the lymph; and, in order to keep it running, let it be daily dreſſed, during fourteen days or longer, with an ointment compoſed of equal parts of <hi>Emplaſtrum veſicatorium,</hi> and <hi>Unguentum coerubeum fortius,</hi> P. L. melted together in a very gentle heat. Let a drachm of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial ointment be rubbed into the fore
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0165700800:81"/>part of the legs of the patient every other night, and on the nights intervening let him take a bolus, compoſed of three or four grains of Calomel, ſix grains of Camphore, and a drachm of Conſerve of Roſes. If any ſigns of ſalivation ſhould appear, it muſt be checked by a day or two's ſuſpenſion, and a doſe of Glauber's Salt.</p>
            <p n="103">103. It may poſſibly be aſked, on what foundation I have differed from ſo many eminent writers in not adviſing immediate ſcarification?—I anſwer, becauſe they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed ſcarification on a groundleſs ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. They imagined that the canine <hi>virus</hi> was communicated to the blood; therefore they wiſely ordered the blood thus contaminated to be drawn away; but I conceive the poiſonous <hi>fomes</hi> to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed by the lymphatic veſſels, and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I prefer bliſtering the part.</p>
            <p n="104">104. Every perſon who, from the bite of a dog really mad, has received the fatal poiſon, whoſe conſtitution is at that time diſpoſed for ſuch infection, and who has ignorantly depended on ſea-bathing, or
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0165700800:82"/>on any ſpecific taken internally, will, moſt certainly, in the ſpace of a few weeks, perceive ſymptoms of the approaching cataſtrophy, called <hi>hydrophobia.</hi> In this ſtage of the diſeaſe I fear there is very little probability of recovery. I have, in paragraph 72, perhaps rather wantonly, adviſed intoxication; I am ſtill of opinion that it is an experiment worth trying. It can certainly do no harm. I remember ſomewhere to have read of opium, in large doſes, being ſucceſsfully adminiſtered; but I do not find this practice confirmed by experience. Powerful anti-ſpaſmodics are certainly indicated.</p>
            <p n="105">105. In the 4th paragraph of this eſſay, I mentioned the caſe of a young gentleman, whom I attended in the laſt ſtage of this horrible diſorder. He had been bitten by one of his father's hounds, ſix or ſeven weeks before. A day or two before I ſaw him he complained of a pain in the arm which had been bitten, gradually extending towards his ſhoulder. He had taken many doſes of the expreſſed juice of Ribwort, which in that country was univerſally deemed a ſpecific, and had
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0165700800:83"/>bathed every day in the river. I ſaw him about ten in the morning. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of nothing but a pain in his arm, and ſome little difficulty in ſwallowing. I ordered a warm bath to be prepared, in which he ſat half an hour with great com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure. I rubbed a conſiderable quantity of mercurial ointment into each arm, and gave him a grain of crude opium every hour, till nine or ten o'clock at night, without the leaſt effect. About eleven he became extremely reſtleſs, and died at twelve, retaining his ſenſes to the laſt moment, without any ſymptoms of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or propenſity to bite his attendants.</p>
            <p n="106">106. This pamphlet, inconſiderable as it may appear to ſome readers, was not written <hi>ſtans pede in uno;</hi> it was nearly finiſhed before the publication of Dr. Cullen's third volume of <hi>Firſt Lines of the Practice of Phyſic.</hi> I ſaw, in that volume, with infinite ſatisfaction, my own opinion, concerning the cure of the diſeaſe in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, confirmed by that of my venerable preceptor, who concludes his chapter on canine madneſs with theſe words.— <q>"Whilſt the ſtate of our experience, with
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0165700800:84"/>reſpect to ſeveral remedies now in uſe, is uncertain, I cannot venture to aſſert that any of theſe is abſolutely inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual; but I can give it as my opinion, that the efficacy of mercury given very largely, and perſiſted in for a long time, both as a means of preventing the diſeaſe, and of curing it when it has actually come on, is better vouched by experience than that of any other remedy now propoſed, or commonly employed."</q>
            </p>
            <p n="107">107. This Eſſay may poſſibly be read by perſons who live in the country, at ſome diſtance from an apothecary, and conſequently, in caſe of an accident, it may be many hours before any mercurial ointment can be procured. Such readers will neceſſarily aſk, what then is to be done?—Whilſt the perſon bit is ſucking the wound, let a ſpoonful of lard, or tallow, or fat of any kind, be melted, and immediately, with the hand, rubbed into the part, continuing the operation until the fat be entirely abſorbed. Let him then take his horſe and ride leiſurely to the neareſt apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecary, who will proceed as above directed.</p>
            <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0165700800:85"/>
            <p n="108">108. On the teſtimony of <hi>Deſſault,</hi> and the Jeſuit <hi>Choiſel,</hi> particularly the latter, mercury appears to be a certain antidote for the poiſon of a mad dog. The firſt uſed mercury only in the ointment: Choiſel, beſides uſing the ointment, gave alſo a mercurial bolus. They both ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. From Deſſault's practice we learn, that mercury externally applied is ſufficient; but evidence is wanting to prove that mercury taken internally, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the external application of the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, will prevent the <hi>hydrophobia.</hi> May we not, therefore, hazard a conjecture, that the lard or fat of which the mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ointment is made is the real preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive? Is not this conjecture powerfully ſupported by the analogy between the canine poiſon and that of a viper, which is effectually deſtroyed by viper's fat, or oil of any kind, applied to the part? I mention this merely as a conjecture, future experiments may poſſibly diſcover it to be a fact: meanwhile, when mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ointment can be had, doubtleſs it ought to be preferred.</p>
