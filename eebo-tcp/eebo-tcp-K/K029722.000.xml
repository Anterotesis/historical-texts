            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But, Monſieur Gage, vill you bring your friend, and taſte my vine; I have got every ting for you and your friend, I aſſure you. M.

                  <p>Your ſarvant Mr. Blaud, though faith to do him juſtice, he has forgot the faſhion of his country, for when he is determined to be a rogue he is honeſt enough to own it. But pray what connection have you with the ſuttlers? You are no victualler here are you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>Not abſolutely a victualler, but I deal in various articles.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>O Daub.</speaker>
                  <p>A contractor! Why what the devil you are not riſen to ſuch preferment as that ſure? I never knew you was able to furniſh any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gage.</speaker>
                  <p>Nothing more eaſy; the circumſtance depends upon the quantity, not the quality. I got on very well lately, but at firſt it brought me in ſeveral confounded ſcrapes.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>O Daub.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gage.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, I undertook to ſerve a regiment with hair powder.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>O Daub.</speaker>
                  <p>Hair powder? What, and you ſent them flower I ſuppoſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gage.</speaker>
                  <p>Flower! no, no—I ſhould have ſaved nothing by that: I went to the fountain head—the pit, and gave 'em a plentiful ſtock of lime.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>O Daub.</speaker>
                  <p>Lime? brick and mortar lime?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gage.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, brick and mortar lime.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>O Daub.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Gage.</speaker>
                  <p>Why at firſt it anſwered the purpoſe very well, while the weather was fine it did charmingly, but one field-day they was all caught in a fine ſoaking ſhower; the ſmoke ran along the lines, ecod their heads were all ſlack'd in an inſtant, and by the time they returned to the camp, damme if

all their heads were not as ſmooth as an old half crown.</p>

                  <speaker>O Daub.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Gage.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I ſtood a near chanceof being tied up to the halberts; but I excuſed myſelf by ſaying, they looked only like raw recruits before; but now they appeared like old veterans of ſervice.</p>

                  <p>Your farm?—what would would you plow and ſow for the hungry Frenchmen to come and reap. Come my lads! let your fields lie fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this year, and I'll inſure you double crops ever after.

                  <p>That's right my lads; this is much better than to be dragg'd away like a ſlave, or be ſcratch'd off the church door for the militia. Now you have preſent pay, and the bounty money into the bargain. But come my lads, let me aſk you a few queſtions, and then the buſineſs is done.</p>

for ever, had not cruel fate ſeparated us; the regiment being ordered to march immediately, no reſource was then left, but my flying from my father's houſe: I procured a dreſs from one of our neighbours ſons, and that love which induced me to forſake my ſex, ſtill ſupports me under e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very affliction.

                  <p>No Nelly, that's impoſſible, and you would think ſo, had you heard how ſhe plighted her faith to me, and vowed, notwithſtanding her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were my enemies, nothing but death ſhould prevent our union.</p>

                  <p>Tho' Indeed I think you are very fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh to plague yourſelf ſo, for even had Nancy loved you well enough to have carried your knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack, you would have been very imprudent to have ſuffered her.</p>

                  <p>Aye, but prudence, you know, is not a ſoldiers virtue. Its our buſineſs to hold life itſelf cheap, much more the comforts of it. Shew me a young fellow in our regiment who, if he gains the heart of a worthy girl, and afraid to marry her for want of a little wealth, I would have him drummed out of the regiment for diſcretion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Nell.</speaker>
                  <p>Very fine! but muſt not the poor girl ſhare in all your fatigues and miſhaps.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Will.</speaker>
                  <p>There Nell I own is the objection, but tenderneſs and affection may ſoften even theſe; yet if my Nancy ever makes the trial, though I may not be able to prevent her from undergoing hardſhips, I am ſure my affection will make her wonder at their being called ſo; I wiſh I could once boaſt that the experiment was made.</p>

                  <p>Why ſeriouſly then, I think it the worſt planned thing I ever beheld, for inſtance now, the tents are all ranged in a ſtrait line, now Lady Gorget, can any thing be worſe than a ſtrait line; and is not there a horrid uniformity in their infinite viſta of canvas? no curve, no break, and the avenue of marquees abominable.</p>

                  <p>Very well, but how will you excuſe this; the officer's tents are cloſe to the common ſoldiers; what an arrangment is that now?

                  <speaker>L. Plume.</speaker>
                  <p>But, Sir Harry, it is rather unlucky that the military ſpirit is ſo univerſal, for you will hardly find one to ſide with you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir Harry.</speaker>
                  <p>Univerſal indeed; and the ridicule of it is to ſee how this madneſs had infected the whole road from Maidſtone to London; the camp jargon is as current all the way as bad ſilver; the very poſtillions that drive you talk of their cavalry, and refuſe to charge on a trot up the hill, the turnpikes ſeem converted into redoubts, and the dogs demanded the counterſign of my ſervants, inſteed of the tickets; then when I got to Maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone I found the very waiters had got a ſmattering of tactics, for enquiring what I could have for dinner, a curſed drilled waiter, after reviewing his bill of fare, with the air of a field marſhal,
