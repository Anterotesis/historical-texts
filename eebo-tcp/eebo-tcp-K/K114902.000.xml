            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE Firſt Diviſion of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom into <hi>Hundreds</hi> and <hi>Tithings</hi> was ordained by the virtuous and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic King Alfred,
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Lambard's explication of words prefixed to his Archaionomia, on the word <hi>Centuria.</hi>
               </note> who is expresſly ſaid to have therein followed the prudent Council given by Jethro to Moſes,
<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>The 1ſt Eſtabliſhment of this prudent advice of Jethro I have examined more at large in my Tract on <hi>"the Law of Nature and Principles of Action in Man,"</hi> p. 325 to 329. Wherein I have ſhewn <hi>the Right of the People</hi> to ELECT Judges and Officers, Civil as well as Military, (Religious Officers and Miniſters excepted,) from the <hi>Colonel,</hi> or Captain, of a <hi>Thouſand,</hi> (who was alſo a <hi>juſticiary,)</hi> down to the Serjeant (Decurio) or Tithingman; (Deut. i. 9-17.) all which Officers were <hi>elected</hi> and <hi>nominated</hi> by the people before they were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with Authority by Moſes. This <hi>Right of the People</hi> to ELECT <hi>Judges</hi> and <hi>Officers</hi> is clearly confirmed by a parallel Text in the ſame Book. Chap. xvi. 18.—<q>JUDGES <hi>and</hi> OFFICERS <hi>ſhalt thou make thee in all thy Gates, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, throughout thy Tribes, and they ſhall judge the People with juſt Judgement.</hi>
                     </q> When this is rendered literally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Original, the <hi>popular Right of Election</hi> appears ſtill more manifeſt.—<q>Judges and Officers ſhalt thou give to thyſelf,</q> (<gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>) which could no otherwiſe be than by a <hi>free Election</hi> in all their Gates, (i. e. the Gates of their Cities, where the public Courts were anciently held,) for the <hi>Judges and Officers</hi> to each Tribe reſpectively.—Let us be truly thankful to God for the <hi>Juſtice</hi> of his Laws, and let us pray that we may have Grace to adopt them! As far as the nature of our political Eſtabliſhments will legally permit, let us, for the honour of <hi>Human Nature,</hi> imitate the <hi>glorious State of Political Liberty</hi> with which God was pleaſed to bleſs his people ISRAEL; and in which he would, moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, have maintained them, if they had perſevered in <hi>the right Faith,</hi> and in due obedience to <hi>his Laws!</hi> But, when men forſake GOD, they unavoidably loſe their LIBERTY! Let no man conceive that the <hi>Rights of Election,</hi> which I have proved by Scripture, were the Rights only of a <hi>ſingle</hi> Nation, the <hi>People of Iſrael;</hi> on the contrary, let us remember, that, as <hi>all</hi> Nations under the Chriſtian Diſpenſation, or rather <hi>all</hi> Nations that are really <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> are ſaid to be engrafted on the <hi>Iſraelitiſh</hi> Olive-Tree, and are thereby entitled to the <hi>name</hi> of ISRAEL, ſo they are undoubtedly entitled likewiſe to all the immunities and privileges of <hi>redeemed Iſrael:</hi> for, the only <hi>people,</hi> perhaps, that are <hi>judicially</hi> excluded from thoſe <hi>national</hi> Rights, are the <hi>Branches</hi> which were <hi>broken off from that good Olive-Tree for their unbelief,</hi> i. e. the Jews themſelves, who are <hi>broken off,</hi> indeed, for a <hi>time,</hi> (a long <hi>time,</hi> alas, it has now been!) and are diſperſed or <hi>ſtrewed</hi> (like <hi>Dead Branches</hi> ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from their proper Root) <hi>amongſt all the nations of the Earth;</hi> thus <hi>univerſally</hi> exhibiting, as it were, <hi>a monumental Proof</hi> of the Scripture Teſtimonies againſt that peculiar Nation!</p>
                  <p>But, under the Chriſtian Diſpenſation, there is not only the <hi>ſame reaſon</hi> for claiming to the <hi>people</hi> the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelitiſh privilege of <hi>electing all temporal</hi> JUDGES and OFFICERS; but there are alſo unqueſtionable Proofs that the <hi>elective Rights</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian People</hi> are enlarged ſtill farther to the choice of all their <hi>Spiritual Officers;</hi> and <hi>Miniſters;</hi> whereas, even in Iſrael, all <hi>Spiritual Functions</hi> were <hi>hereditary</hi> and not <hi>elective.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus are the <hi>Elective Rights</hi> of Chriſtian People ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly enlarged; and all perſons, who withhold or oppoſe theſe juſt <hi>Rights,</hi> ought to beware leſt they be found at laſt amongſt the Enemies of the <hi>King of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs;</hi> for it is remarkable that the <hi>great apoſtacy,</hi> ſo long foretold in the Chriſtian Church, could not <hi>mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt itſelf in power</hi> until the unwearied encroachments and uſurpations of <hi>Popes, Emperors,</hi> and <hi>Kings,</hi> had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the <hi>Church</hi> (i. e. the <hi>Congregation of Clergy and People</hi> in each Country or Diſtrict) that <hi>moſt eſſential Right</hi> of all others, the ancient uſage of <hi>electing their own Biſhops!</hi> See a long Note on this Subject beginning at p. 331 of my Tract on the Law of Retribution.</p>

               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0996200400:32"/>The title of <hi>Deciner</hi> could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly belong to any but the <hi>ten</hi> houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders themſelves, from whoſe <hi>number</hi> his diviſion was formerly called <hi>Tienman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tale,</hi> id eſt, (ſays Mr. Lambard,) <q>

               </q> (ſays he) <q>
                  <hi>that divers colonies from Rome were in Britain, as at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melodunum, now Malden in Eſſex,</hi> &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The conſideration of this circumſtance enables us to propoſe a much more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable etymology of the Engliſh word <hi>Denizen</hi> than what is generally aſſigned. Lord Coke ſuppoſes it from <q>
                  <hi>deins nee, born within;</hi>
               </q> and alſo from <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naiſon,</hi> 
               <q>becauſe the freedom <hi>is given by the King.</hi>
               </q> But a learned writer (Davies) aſſerts, that <q>
                  <hi>Denizen is a Britiſh law term, which the Saxons and Angles found here and retained.</hi>
               </q> It could not, therefore, be derived from
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0996200400:34"/>the <hi>French</hi> tongue, before that modern language was known, or even formed.</p>
            <p>Neither is the <hi>Welch</hi> etymology of it at all ſatisfactory, becauſe it ſeems very uncouth, and not ſufficiently ſimilar in ſound to the word. But, if we derive the word immediately from the <hi>Latin,</hi> it will appear moſt natural and eaſy, both in <hi>ſound</hi> and <hi>ſenſe;</hi> for, the word <hi>Deni,</hi> being derived <hi>à Decem pro Deceni,</hi> is a proper adjective expreſſive of its relation to the number of <hi>ten</hi> perſons in a <hi>Decenary;</hi> and, as the Romans had their <hi>Decuriones,</hi> and conſequently <hi>Decenaries</hi> alſo, a proper <hi>Latin</hi> verb to expreſs the initia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or introduction of a perſon to the privileges and franchiſes of a <hi>Decenary,</hi> is very naturally formed from the word <hi>Deni,</hi> viz. <hi>Denizo,</hi> which verb and its derivatives are frequently uſed by our law-writers, when they ſpeak of the admiſſion of <hi>Aliens</hi> to the franchiſes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0996200400:35"/>of the native inhabitants; and, the ſaid <hi>franchiſes</hi> being maintained in ancient times by mutual <hi>frank-pledge</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Decenaries,</hi> it is obvious, that the participle <hi>"Denizatus,"</hi> which frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly occurs, and the derived noun-ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>"Denizatio,"</hi> are applied in ſuch caſes in their proper <hi>Latin</hi> ſenſe; though the law-writers, who uſed them, have overlooked that moſt obvious etymology, which is confirmed by the <hi>ſound</hi> as well as the true <hi>Latin ſenſe</hi> of thoſe terms.</p>
            <p>Lord Coke ſays <q>
                  <hi>Denizen</hi> is taken for an alien born, that is <hi>infranchiſed,</hi> or DENIZATED by Letters Patent, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the King doth grant unto him, that in all things he ſhould be reputed, eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, held, and governed, as our liege ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſprung up</q> (from his anceſtors) <q>within our ſaid kingdom of England, and not otherwiſe, nor in any other manner.</q> And he cites Dier, in the ſame page, 1 Inſt. lib. 2. p. 129. reſpecting this

               </q>—When foreigners, therefore, were admitted to the privileges and fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes of Engliſhmen, they became the King's <hi>liege</hi> ſubjects,—<q>

                  <hi>renting of a houſe, at a certain rent, by the year,</hi>
               </q> is the ancient legal deſcription of <hi>burgage
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0996200400:37"/>tenure. "It is called</hi> BURGH," (ſays Sir Edward Coke,) <q>

                  <hi>And it is called</hi> TENURE IN BURGAGE,</q> (ſays Little<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,) <q>

In the <hi>Borough</hi> of Southwark, and many others to this day, <hi>the renters</hi> of tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or <hi>houſekeepers in general,</hi> paying ſcot and lot, are the Electors of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties to Parliament; ſo that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is unqueſtionable. And, in the City of Weſtminſter, and ſeveral other an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cities, the ſame RIGHT, by <hi>bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage tenure,</hi> of voting for Repreſentatives, prevails to this day; becauſe, <hi>all Cities</hi> were originally deemed. <hi>Boroughs,</hi> as being the habitations of <hi>freo-borges,</hi> or

               <hi>free pledges,</hi> i. e. the aſſociated <hi>houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,</hi> who were mutually <hi>pledged</hi> to maintain the public peace, and defend and ſupport the due execution of the laws: and, if the right of voting were fully reſtored, throughout the kingdom, to all <hi>houſeholders,</hi> or <hi>maſters of families,</hi> who principally ſupport the burthens of the ſtate, even if the franchiſe ſhould deſcend no lower, it would be amply ſufficient, I truſt, to deſtroy the preſent deplorable corruption in the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or rather the <hi>miſ-repreſentation,</hi> of the Commons, and to reſtore the ancient dignity and freedom of Parliament; eſpecially if all the ſaid <hi>houſeholders</hi> were duly incorporated as <hi>Deciners</hi> or <hi>Free-Borhes,</hi> in their reſpective neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods.</p>
            <p>For then the number of <hi>Deciners</hi> or <hi>Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders</hi> in each county would be regularly known, howſoever much the numbers
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0996200400:42"/>of other males in the ſeveral <hi>Tithings</hi> might vary; and the advantage of this <hi>regularity of numbers</hi> would not only be the effecting a proportionable <hi>regularity of manners,</hi> but it would alſo greatly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitate the much wiſhed-for meaſure of a <hi>more equal repreſentation of the people;</hi> nay, the repreſentation may be made not only <hi>more equal,</hi> but <hi>moſt equal</hi> or <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly equal,</hi> if all <hi>Deciners</hi> in each county were allowed to vote, as unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably, in juſtice and conſtitutional right, they ought to do: for, the junction of ten <hi>equal</hi> hundreds of <hi>Deciners</hi> into one aſſociated body would form the court of the <hi>thouſand,</hi> well known in the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelitiſh commonwealth; which, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as a proportionable <hi>diviſion</hi> of a county, perfectly regular in numerical order, both of Officers and other <hi>Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> would much facilitate the conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ordering of public buſineſs.
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0996200400:43"/>And <hi>two</hi> ſuch diviſions, of <hi>a thouſand Deciners each,</hi> would be a proper num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber to ſend <hi>one Deputy</hi> to Parliament, according to the preſent population of the kingdom, ſo as not to exceed, but rather diminiſh, the preſent number of repreſentatives. Thus, a <hi>moſt equal repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of all the families in the kingdom</hi> would be obtained; and <hi>two thouſand</hi> families (one with another) might well afford to pay ample wages to <hi>one</hi> Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative; and the ſtipend might be very eaſily collected, if the <hi>Decenaries</hi> were duly formed and eſtabliſhed, and the ſeveral courts, which regularly ariſe from the <hi>Decenaries,</hi> viz. the <hi>Hundred</hi> Courts, and alſo the Courts of <hi>one Thouſand</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies each, above propoſed; and laſtly, the junction of <hi>two</hi> ſuch <hi>Courts of the Thouſand,</hi> for the election of <hi>one</hi> Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative in the great Common Council of the Realm.

                  <p>"No ſhuffling arts or equivocations whatſoever can lighten this monſtrous load of guilt, for which the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders muſt <hi>one day</hi> moſt certainly be called to account, notwithſtanding that they may have eſcaped the penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of this Engliſh Statute: for indeed it is merely the penalties (or execution) of the ſaid Statute which they eſcape and not the guilt of breaking it; becauſe the ſame is ſo warily drawn up, that there is not the leaſt room for mental reſervation.</p>
                  <p>"A very large proportion of the freeholders in this kingdom, it is to be feared, are involved in this horrid guilt!

This long digreſſion, from the ſubject of Negro Slaves, the author hopes may be pardoned, eſpecially if the reader will pleaſe to conſider, that ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and political Slavery, as well as Slavery to ſenſual appetites, are ſo very nearly connected with each other, in their nature and effects, that it is no very conſiderable tranſition from the preſent point to ſpeak of them together. But the caſe of this poor Negro is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. If he is a Slave, yet it was not with his own conſent that he was made ſo. He neither <hi>ſold himſelf,</hi> nor has he <hi>betrayed others,</hi> and cannot therefore be liable to ſuch ſevere penalties. He has not been guilty of any offences, that I know of, for which he might <hi>lawfully</hi> (like corrupt and venal voters who accept of money, meat, or drink, at elections) <hi>be diveſted of his humanity;</hi> and therefore it muſt certainly be allowed, that he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from a horſe or a dog in this very <hi>eſſential point,</hi> viz. <hi>his humanity."</hi>

            </p>
            <p>The million of <hi>Houſeholders</hi> would form exactly ONE THOUSAND diviſions of <hi>one thouſand Houſeholders</hi> each, viz. 1000 <hi>Courts of the Thouſand,</hi> which I have before recommended from ancient exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and the junction of <hi>two</hi> ſuch <hi>Courts of the Thouſand,</hi> for the election of <hi>one</hi> Member of Parliament, as before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, would form 500 Courts of <hi>two thouſand Houſeholders</hi> each, which would elect <hi>five hundred Repreſentatives</hi> for South Britain; a proportion ſufficiently near to the number 513, at preſent elected for that part of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; becauſe a reduction in number, would, perhaps, be more beneficial than otherwiſe; for certain it is, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

            <p>This plan would indeed occaſion ſome variation in modes and forms, but no real <hi>innovation</hi> with reſpect to the national conſtitution; becauſe the <hi>right of election</hi> would ſtill be veſted where it ought, viz. in ALL <hi>the free Houſeholders,</hi> or Freo-borges, of ALL <hi>the counties;</hi> and that, in the moſt <hi>perfect proportion of equality</hi> that can be deſired; which ought ſurely to recommend the propoſal, if <hi>equal repreſentation</hi> is at all a worthy object,—if <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>right</hi> are to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to their oppoſite extremes, <hi>in-equity</hi> or iniquity, and <hi>tort,</hi> which have too long prevailed;—or laſtly, if we have honeſty or humanity enough left amongſt us, in the fear of God, to <hi>reject the evil and chooſe the good,</hi> i. e. to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe

            <p>In all theſe various diviſions of the people, regular courts were anciently held for the maintenance of <hi>peace</hi> and <hi>right,</hi> and for adjuſting all differences amongſt neighbours, <hi>without expence;</hi> for, there was no cauſe or conteſt of ſuch magnitude and importance, for which a popular court of proportionable dignity could not be found in the larger diviſions of Wappentakes, Trithings, and Shires, to adjuſt and determine it; whereby tedious and vexatious lawſuits, and the ruinous expences attending them, were happily avoided.

                  <p>We need not wonder, therefore, at his boldneſs, in uſurping an <hi>unlimited</hi> authority over the poor <hi>unarmed</hi> Italian BISHOPS, (who were otherwiſe his equals in real dignity of office,) depoſing them <q>
                        <hi>according to his will,</hi>
                     </q> (a manifeſt token of the Beaſt,) and openly violating the moſt ſacred <hi>rights</hi> of the Italian CLERGY, AND PEOPLE, in their <hi>epiſcopal</hi> elections, that he might fill the Italian ſees with <hi>Monkiſh</hi> Prelates, who would be more attached to the growing power than <hi>married Biſhops,</hi> ſuch as were, for the moſt part, thoſe of the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church. But the particular inſtance, which I propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to mention, was at Rimini, in the year 591, where, on the death of a Biſhop, Gregory ſent a legate to interfere in the <hi>election;</hi> and one Odeatinus, a nobleman, being never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs <hi>elected</hi> Biſhop, the <hi>Pontif was pleaſed</hi> (PLACU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ISSET PONTIFICI) to command them, on pain of <hi>ponti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fical cenſure,</hi> to place <hi>another perſon</hi> in the ſee. The man <hi>elected</hi> and <hi>conſecrated</hi> for this purpoſe by Gregory was Caſtorius, who, not being <hi>elected</hi> by the people of Rimini, was of courſe thwarted by them, and ſuffered many things by PARTY OPPOSITION, the very evil which Gregory pretended to avoid by his MOST PAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIAL <hi>corruption</hi> of the election, <q>ne illam, i. e. <hi>elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionem,</hi> STUDIA PARTIUM <hi>corrumperent,</hi>
                     </q> for that was his plea for interference. Beſides this oppoſition, Caſtorius was grievouſly afflicted with a diſtemper in his head, on account of which he was invited by the <hi>Pontif</hi> to change the air and viſit him at Rome; but, being even there no better, he requeſted the Pontif that a Paſtor might be ſent to his church, who could better promote the divine ſervice; and, when the Pontif's hope of Caſtorius's recovery by the Roman air abated, he adminiſtered the charge of the church of Rimini by Leontius, Biſhop of Urbin, (a ſecond uſurpation,) who was alſo a Biſhop of <hi>his own</hi> appointment. In the mean while the ſick <hi>Caſtorius</hi> urged the Pontif with his entreaties; and at length prevailed on him to grant "POWER TO THE CLERGY AND PEOPLE" of Rimini to <hi>"elect a Biſhop for themſelves,"</hi> (i. e. to be re-inſtated in their ancient <hi>right,</hi>) <q>which was done <hi>in the year</hi> 595,</q>

"— <hi>ſauns faire l'aſſeſſe,</hi>" which, I ſuppoſe, ſhould rather be <hi>l'aſſiſe,</hi> i. e. without demanding a due enquiry into their caſe by <hi>inqueſt</hi> or <hi>aſſiſe</hi> of a <hi>jury.</hi> The priviledge ſhould afford them, indeed, a ſhort, temporary, aſylum from any ſingle, mercileſs, credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, yet not ſo as to favour their eſcape, but merely to give them time to call their other juſt creditors toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, in order to make an equal diviſion, as far as their effects will go, after giving up <hi>all</hi> upon oath, and then to be abſolutely at liberty by the <hi>common law</hi> without fear of farther arreſt if there is no juſt ſuſpicion of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

               <note n="*" place="bottom">This celebrated Tract, <hi>little</hi> as it is in bulk, hath ſtill <hi>leſs</hi> of truth and juſtice in its poſitions and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions; ſo that, after paying all due reſpect to <hi>the ſingular wit and humour</hi> of the writer, we muſt neceſſarily deem it as <hi>ſuperficial</hi> and <hi>groundleſs</hi> as it is <hi>ſhort!</hi> but it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs rendered important and conſiderable, by the great circulation and public notice with which it hath been honoured: for, though the author did not think proper to prefix <hi>his name,</hi> the bookſellers, it ſeems, have made no ſecret of it, and the work has been induſtriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retailed by piece-meal in the news papers, and has, therein, been publicly attributed to a certain facetious old gentleman of rank and conſequence in the polite world, and alſo of conſiderable celebrity as a writer; by which circumſtances we may eaſily account for the extraordinary ready ſale and circulation of ſuch a work.</note>;" for it would moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly afford the effectual means of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining perfect peace during the time of <hi>elections,</hi> and would render the polling of the electors, (be they ever ſo numerous,) not only <hi>practicable,</hi> but perfectly eaſy and free from confuſion, even if the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations of the <hi>right of voting</hi> were drawn out to the moſt liberal extent that has yet been propoſed; even according to the
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0996200400:153"/>
               <hi>plan,</hi> which this author <hi>ironically</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares, he <hi>"prefers to all the reſt,"</hi> viz. <q>
                  <hi>that of giving a right of voting univerſally together with annual elections.</hi>
               </q> This is the plan, which, he ſays, <q>
                  <hi>appears to be the moſt uniform, conſiſtent, and effectual:</hi>
               </q> but then he quaintly adds, <q>
                  <hi>it has, indeed, one capital defect, which is, that it is abſolutely and utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, &amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if this was as <hi>true</hi> as it is <hi>witty,</hi> the ſtate of the nation would indeed be deſperate! for, if the <hi>"moſt effectual"</hi> plan of reformation was really <hi>impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable,</hi> any attempt whatever to correct the enormous <hi>inequality,</hi> or <hi>in-equity,</hi> of the national repreſentation, and its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>ruinous venality</hi> and manifold <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive corruptions,</hi> would indeed be hopeleſs! and we ſhould, of courſe, be obliged to embrace this author's forlorn and <hi>diſloyal</hi> doctrine, (in p. 17.) which
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0996200400:154"/>may truly be ſaid to expreſs the ſcope and drift of all his arguments; becauſe they are, for the moſt part, <hi>deiſtically</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In a well-intended work of the ſame celebrated au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, wherein <hi>Deiſtical</hi> notions ought not to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared without their antidote, we may find ſeveral very heterodox and dangerous poſitions, ſtated as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of <hi>"ſome ſpeculative and refined obſervers,"</hi> viz. that to ſuch perſons <hi>"it has appeared incredible,"</hi> (ſay he,) <q>
                        <hi>that a wiſe and benevolent Creator ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted a world upon one plan, and a religion for it on another;</hi>

                        <hi>the love of power, riches, honour, and fame, are the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citements to generous and magnanimous actions; yet by this inſtitution</hi>

                     </q> (ibid.) 4thly, That <q>
                        <hi>nations</hi> CANNOT <hi>ſubſiſt without wars, nor wars be carried on without rapine, deſolation, and murder; yet are theſe prohibited under the ſevereſt threats,</hi>
                     </q> (p. 134 and 135.) 5thly, That <q>

                     </q> &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. And at laſt, he renders himſelf anſwerable for theſe pernicious and contradictory poſitions, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcriminately adopting them all, and making them his <hi>own,</hi> ſaying, <q>
                        <hi>To all this I anſwer, that ſuch indeed is the Chriſtian Revelation, though ſome of its advocates may, perhaps, be unwilling to own it, and ſuch</hi>

                        <hi>it is conſtantly declared to be by him who gave it, as well as by thoſe who publiſhed it under his immediate direction:</hi>
                     </q> But, happily for mankind and the honour of our holy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the texts, which he has cited to juſtify his aſſertion, contain nothing that can poſſibly afford the leaſt ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to any ſuch doctrines and contradictions. That <hi>world,</hi> which our Saviour ſpoke of as being in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>him</hi> and <hi>his,</hi> could not mean <hi>the world conſtituted upon the plan of the Creator,</hi> but only the wickedneſs of <hi>worldly men,</hi> ſuch as the apoſtle Paul has particularly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in his ſecond epiſtle to Timothy, (ch. iii. v. 2-9.) <q>

                     </q> (ſaid the apoſtle) <hi>"turn away;"</hi> manifeſtly giving the very ſame advice, which appears in one of the texts cited by this writer, "<hi>Be not conformed to this world,</hi>

                        <hi>world which is at enmity with God,</hi>
                     </q> mentioned in another of the texts cited, by him, from the apoſtle James. Nay, that
<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. ii. 6. Jom. iv. 4.</note> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>wiſdom of the world which is at enmity with God</hi>
                     </q> cannot be illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated by more flagrant examples than theſe very poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which our author has unguardedly adopted from <hi>"ſome ſpeculative and refined obſervers,"</hi> and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the third, that <q>
                        <hi>government cannot be managed without violence, corruption, and impoſition,</hi>
                     </q> which I propoſe more particularly to examine, becauſe it is a <hi>political</hi> doctrine too generally adopted by <hi>placemen</hi> and <hi>penſioners,</hi> and which is manifeſtly the very principle or eſſential ſpirit which pervaded, and has notoriouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced, every page of our author's <q>
                        <hi>Thoughts on a Parliamentary Reform!</hi>
                     </q> His <hi>firſt</hi> poſition is materially connected with the <hi>third,</hi> and will, of courſe, fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſame examination. With reſpect to his <hi>ſecond</hi> poſition, I ſhall briefly remark, that, though <q>
                        <hi>the love of power, riches, honour, and fame, are,</hi>
                     </q> indeed moſt commonly <q>
                        <hi>the great inoitements to generous and magna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous actions,</hi>
                     </q> yet, for the honour of human nature, theſe are not to be deemed the <hi>only</hi> incitements, becauſe the MOST <hi>"generous"</hi> and the MOST <q>
                        <hi>magnanimous actions</hi>
                     </q> have much more noble <hi>incitements</hi> than he has conceived, viz. the <hi>love of God,</hi> and the <hi>natural love</hi> of <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>right;</hi> ſo that his poſition proves nothing againſt the merit of actions that are <hi>truly</hi> and <hi>perfectly generous.</hi> And, beſides theſe worthy <hi>incitements,</hi> the agency, or influence, of GOD's HOLY SPIRIT is alſo to be deemed an <hi>incitement to generous and magnanimous actions;</hi> nay, it is certainly the higheſt <hi>incitement,</hi> or the <hi>ſupreme principle of action in man,</hi> by which <hi>all</hi> chriſtians <hi>ought</hi> to be influenced, and moſt certainly <hi>may</hi> be ſo, if they do not neglect the promiſed <hi>means!</hi> This, I truſt, is amply proved in my tract on <hi>the Law of Nature,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>fourth</hi> and <hi>fifth</hi> poſitions are grounded on a ſtrange miſunderſtanding of the true doctrine concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>non-reſiſtance;</hi> for though, we are, indeed, required to forgive <hi>perſonal injuries,</hi> and to ſubmit to them with chriſtian meekneſs, when any one of <hi>ourſelves</hi> is indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually the ſufferer, nevertheleſs we are, moſt certainly, bound in chriſtian duty to <hi>reſiſt evil</hi> and <hi>injury</hi> whenever the <hi>perſons,</hi> or <hi>property,</hi> of <hi>other</hi> men are in danger; and to defend <hi>each other</hi> from all unjuſt <hi>violence</hi> and <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine,</hi> whenever it is in our power to do ſo; and that even at the riſk of our lives, which I have fully ſtated in my tracts on <hi>Crown Law</hi> and <hi>Paſſive Obedience.</hi> And, if individuals may, legally, and conſiſtently with their duty as chriſtians, <hi>reſiſt evil</hi> in defence of <hi>each other,</hi> ſurely a whole chriſtian community, or <hi>nation,</hi> may, moſt conſcientiouſly, be allowed, in their united legiſlative or executive capacity, a power of <hi>defending the innecent,</hi> and of <hi>reſiſting evil</hi> and <hi>oppreſſion:</hi> for this is the true foundation of all <hi>juſt wars,</hi> which, certainly, in the neceſſary defence of a <hi>nation,</hi> may be carried on without the guilt of <hi>rapine</hi> and <hi>murder;</hi> ſince, even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>individuals,</hi> the <hi>inevitable killing</hi> of an adverſary, in the neceſſary defence of a man's own perſon, is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>juſtifiable</hi> in <hi>law,</hi> as well as in <hi>reaſon,</hi> which is the <hi>eternal</hi> law of God. And <hi>national juſtice</hi> in many caſes, is unqueſtionably required to <hi>reſiſt evil,</hi> even unto <hi>blood!</hi> The blood of the murderer (i. e. of the <hi>voluntary killer of a</hi> MAN) is abſolutely required to be ſhed by MAN, (<hi>"by man ſhall his blood be ſhed,"</hi> Gen. ix. 6.) and a moral reaſon is elſewhere aſſigned for this retaliation by <hi>man,</hi> viz. <q>
                        <hi>for blood it deſileth the land: and the land cannot be cleanſed of the blood that is ſhed therein, but by the blood of him that ſhed it.</hi>
                     </q> (Num. xxxv. 33.) And this, ſurely, is a <hi>reſiſtance to evil,</hi> a retaliation of <hi>violence in kind</hi> even to the utmoſt extremity of <hi>violence,</hi>—to death! This, however, muſt be underſtood only of <hi>judicial acts</hi> of retaliation, duly limited in all their circumſtances by the eſtabliſhed laws of the <hi>community,</hi> or nation, which inhabits <hi>the land where the blood is ſhed;</hi> but, under ſuch due reſtriction, the retaliation of <hi>blood</hi> for <hi>blood</hi> is ſo far from being forbid, that the land, it is manifeſt, cannot be <hi>cleanſed</hi> without it. The indiſcriminate doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, therefore, of <hi>non reſiſtance,</hi> as ſtated in theſe two poſitions, has no foundation in ſcripture, nor indeed any where elſe, except in the <hi>miſunderſtanding</hi> and inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy of theſe <hi>ſpeculative</hi> and <hi>refined obſervers!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I may now return to the conſideration of his third poſition, that <q>
                        <hi>government is eſſential to the nature of man, and</hi> CANNOT <hi>be managed without certain degrees of</hi> VIOLENCE, CORRUPTION, and IMPOSITION, <hi>yet all theſe are ſtrictly forbid.</hi>
                     </q> The firſt part of this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, as well as the laſt, muſt certainly be admitted as unqueſtionable <hi>truths;</hi> but if the middle part of the propoſition were equally <hi>true;</hi> viz. that government "CANNOT <hi>be managed without violence, impoſition,</hi>" &amp;c. it would follow, of courſe, that the <hi>neceſſity of the caſe</hi> muſt regularly ſuperſede all that is ſo <q>
                        <hi>ſtrictly forbid</hi>
                     </q> concerning it! and then, indeed, theſe <q>
                        <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative</hi> and <hi>refined obſervers</hi>
                     </q> would have a better foundation for their impious inſinuation, that the <hi>Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor hath</hi> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>conſtituted a world upon one plan, and a reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion for it on another!</hi>
                     </q> Nay, I have frequently heard theſe very principles avowed in converſation, by ſome other <hi>ſuch "friends to good government"</hi> as our author, in terms to the following effect. <q>
                        <hi>That public buſineſs cannot be carried on without</hi> BRIBERY and CORRUP<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION: <hi>that the meaſures of adminiſtration are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably</hi> NECESSARY <hi>to maintain due ſubordination and</hi> GOOD GOVERNMENT, <hi>and muſt not, therefore, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded by unſeaſonable negatives of parliament; ſo that</hi> POLITICAL NECESSITY <hi>will ſufficiently juſtify the ſtateſman in exerting all poſſible influence to obtain a majority at any rate.</hi>
                     </q> Thus the plea of NECESSITY is introduced to <hi>palliate</hi> and excuſe, nay, even to <hi>juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify</hi> and <hi>eſtabliſh,</hi> the moſt flagrant enormities! as if <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equity</hi> was become an eſſential principle of government, ſo authorized and <hi>eſtabliſhed</hi> by the ſanction of <hi>general uſage,</hi> that every attempt to correct it muſt be deemed an <hi>innovation to the conſtitution!</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In no other point of view can be underſtood the falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and groundleſs charge of INNOVATION which has regularly been oppoſed to <hi>parliamentary reform,</hi> by men of <hi>a certain deſcription,</hi> whenever it hath been propoſed. With theſe <hi>latitudinarians in principle,</hi> all diſtinctions between <hi>right</hi> and <hi>wrong</hi> muſt be meaſured by <hi>political expediency,</hi> becauſe <hi>government,</hi> according to them, <q>
                        <hi>cannot be managed without certain degrees of violence, corruption, and impoſition!</hi>
                     </q> Thus the celebrated wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hath very honeſtly ſtated the <hi>ruling</hi> maxim of that <hi>venal majority</hi> with whom he always <hi>voted</hi> and <hi>aſſociated.</hi> And, as theſe <hi>"ſpeculative and refined obſervers"</hi> have carried this wretched ſyſtem of <hi>political neceſſity and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency</hi> to the utmoſt extent that it was capable of, I have need only to cite their own <hi>woeful experience,</hi> as a moſt ſtriking and undeniable example of its abſurdity!</p>
                  <p>The INIQUITY of theſe acknowledged means of <hi>"managing government,"</hi> viz. <q>
                        <hi>violence, corruption, and impoſition,</hi>
                     </q> added to the MISCARRIAGES which ſuch worthy <hi>miniſterial accompliſhments</hi> have of late years no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly occaſioned, would form too heavy a burden for one broad back! I ſpeak, therefore, of the late <hi>governing</hi> majority, in the aggregate, and ſhall not be tempted to particularize, unleſs any of them ſhould ſtill perſiſt in ſoliciting and inviting, as it were, the national juſtice againſt themſelves, for their former miſconduct when in power, by any farther unreaſonable and <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking</hi> oppoſition to the neceſſary <hi>reformation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under the baneful auſpices of theſe juſtifying Majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and their <hi>Managers,</hi> the Patrons and Friends of this writer, (with the ſanction alſo of his <hi>own ſteady vote,</hi> in all their meaſures;) the moſt diſgraceful and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious exceſs, of "<hi>violence, corruption,</hi> and <hi>impoſition,</hi>" has been tried and puſhed to the utmoſt exertions of the national ſtrength and reſources; and at an expence of blood and treaſure, far beyond all example of former times!</p>
                  <p>And yet the deteſtable <hi>experiment</hi> has notoriouſly failed in almoſt every circumſtance propoſed to be effected by it, and, inſtead of <hi>raiſing a revenue,</hi> to gratify and eaſe <hi>"the country gentlemen,"</hi> has <hi>ſunk</hi> the national reſources in a hopeleſs <hi>gulph of debt,</hi> the very intereſt of which is an <hi>annual</hi> expence of more than the value of an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire! i. e. <hi>a revenue, by the rule of inverſe, againſt</hi> the ſtate, like the <hi>"negative quantity"</hi> of the algebraiſts, <hi>"leſs than nothing,"</hi> a <hi>"minus"</hi> of eight millions per annum, at leaſt, beſides a moſt diſgraceful diſmember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Britiſh empire! So much for the EXPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIENCE of the <hi>"ſpeculative and refined obſervers."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are many maxims, indeed, which ſeem to favour the plea of <hi>neceſſity,</hi> as

                  <p>The holy ſcriptures abound with ſuch ſtriking in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of <hi>bad,</hi> as well as of <hi>good,</hi> actions; but <hi>all</hi> of them are to be deemed as <hi>enſamples, written for our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition,</hi> (1 Cor. x. 11.) and therefore, we muſt not preſume to ſay, with the celebrated author, that ſome of the occurrences, related in ſcripture, are <q>

                        <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got,</hi>
                     </q> likewiſe, another circumſtance which is ſtill more unlucky for his aſſertion, viz. that the holy ſcripture has expreſsly informed us, that the apoſtle <hi>actually foretold the danger of the voyage,</hi> and has thereby given us ample proof of his being under <q>

                     </q> at the very time, and in the very fact, which the celebrated writer has ingeniouſly cited as a proof to the contrary! (See Acts. xxvii. 10.) The occurrence is, therefore, ſo far from being of <hi>"no importance at all,"</hi> that it is, perhaps, the <hi>moſt important</hi> of any in the whole hiſtory of that apoſtle! if we except his converſion; becauſe the actual attention of <hi>divine providence</hi> towards juſt and righteous men is exemplified (for the comfort of all perſons that are truly religious) in this eminent inſtance of God's regard to the perſon of Paul, in giving him ſuch <hi>foreknowledge for his preſervation.</hi> And the other circumſtances of the ſhipwreck are alſo <hi>highly important</hi> in many other reſpects; for, though the ſhip was really loſt, <hi>agreeable to the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle's prediction,</hi> yet God afterwards <hi>gave to Paul the lives of all that failed with him,</hi> whereby he was authorized to aſſure them of ſafety, even when they were at the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extremity of danger, ſaying, <q>
                        <hi>there ſhall not a hair fall from the head of any of you,</hi>

What perſon or perſons have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>bribes</hi> of any kind, or have <hi>eaten or drunk</hi> (the moſt pernicious participation of <hi>bribery</hi>) at the expence of others du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of an <hi>election?</hi> The penalty of receiving any <hi>"reward whatſoever"</hi> on ſuch occaſions is 500l. beſides an <hi>incapa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city</hi> from ever voting again: ſee ſtat. 2 Geo.

            <p>
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0996200400:188"/>35. What attornies, or other perſons, have been agents in diſtributing money, or other reward of any kind, or in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing reward or emolument during the time of an election?</p>
            <p>36. What public houſes have been <hi>opened</hi> (a term ſufficiently underſtood by the notorious practice of it) for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of influencing any election, after the teſte of the writ, or after the place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came vacant? and who hath paid (or hath undertaken to pay, and is, directly or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, reſponſible) for the expences incurred by ſuch public and unlawful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment? If the proofs on this head can be fairly traced, ſo as to criminate the <hi>perſons elected,</hi> they are thereby effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incapacitated from holding their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtly-acquired ſeats in parliament, and by virtue of the above-mentioned ſtatute of 7 and 8 William III. are <q>

            <p>37. What publican or victualler hath ſupplied <q>meat, drink, <hi>entertainment,</hi> or <hi>proviſion,</hi>

For, in this caſe, the publican is as much a criminal agent in <hi>bribery,</hi> as the petty-fogging attorney who <hi>bribes</hi> with caſh, notes, or promiſes, and is equally liable to all the penalties of <hi>bribery.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:0996200400:190"/>38.

            <p>There is no doubt but that regular <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual</hi> enquiries upon oath, in all parts of the kingdom, on theſe points, would put an effectual ſtop to the <hi>expences</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption</hi> of elections, and conſequently to the <hi>tumults</hi> and other immoralities of them, whereby the trite argument againſt the <hi>conſtitutional frequency of elections</hi> would, of courſe, be ſuperſeded; ſo that the ancient right of newly electing our repreſentatives for <hi>every ſeſſion of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> might again be happily reſtored, without either <hi>inconvenience</hi> to the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, or <hi>expence</hi> to the candidates.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:0996200400:191"/>And laſtly, as the original intention of theſe legal diviſions of the people into <hi>tithings</hi> and <hi>hundreds</hi> was obviouſly for <hi>military,</hi> as well as <hi>civil,</hi> purpoſes, ſome other additional articles of enquiry will alſo be neceſſary to re-eſtabliſh and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the ancient <hi>legal military duties</hi> of the people in a regular WATCH and WARD throughout the kingdom, in order to prevent every ſpecies of <hi>robbery, riot,</hi> or other <hi>violence</hi> whatſoever, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal enemies, as well as to be thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prepared, without the enormous and ruinous expence which at preſent is thought neceſſary againſt the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of invaſions by foreign enemies.</p>
            <p>That this was an ancient object of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry at <hi>views of Frankpledge</hi> is manifeſt, by the article which I cited from <hi>Fleta,</hi> in p. 138. n. viz. <q>

               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>I ſay a <hi>gradual decreaſe,</hi> becauſe I wiſh the reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our armies to be made without injury or any material inconvenience to the brave officers and men that have faithfully ſerved therein, to whom are certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly due all the kindneſs and reaſonable liberality that the nation can afford to ſhew them: and, though I am a <hi>profeſſed</hi> enemy to STANDING ARMIES in general, yet, at the ſame time, I <hi>profeſs,</hi> and really entertain, a very cordial regard and benevolence to the deſerving <hi>indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals,</hi> of which they are compoſed. The kind of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, therefore, which I wiſh to ſee, is ſuch as they themſelves, I believe, would not think either <hi>unjuſt</hi> or <hi>hard</hi> upon them: and yet, I truſt, that <hi>the ſavings,</hi> ariſing from it, would be as <hi>effectual</hi> and <hi>ſpeedy</hi> as thoſe of any other plan that the nation can (with conſiſtent honour and due liberality to the parties) adopt. Let us, therefore, ſuppoſe a reduction to be made <hi>by time</hi> rather than by the <hi>involuntary diſcharge</hi> of any one; and by putting an <hi>entire ſtep to recruiting, and to the granting of any new commiſſions,</hi> rather than by the <hi>ſtoppage</hi> of pay. Let <hi>diſcharges,</hi> however, be <hi>freely granted</hi> to all that <hi>requeſt</hi> them; and let <hi>liberal bounties</hi> (in proportion to rank and pay) be given, to incite <hi>ſuch requeſts;</hi> that induſtrious ſubaltern officers and men may be encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and enabled to engage themſelves in <hi>civil</hi> occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A preference ſhould alſo be given, in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of lucrative <hi>civil</hi> employments under the crown, (in ſuch employments, I mean, as are neceſſary to be continued) to deſerving officers that are properly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for them, provided they give up their <hi>military</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and profeſſion; which would much haſten the reduction of the army and <hi>its expences.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The corps of <hi>Engineers</hi> and the regiment of <hi>Artillery,</hi> however, are branches of the military eſtabliſhment which cannot ſo ſafely be reduced, or, at leaſt, not in ſo great a degree, as the other military corps, becauſe they cannot ſo eaſily as other regiments be raiſed again, in caſe of any ſudden want of them; a regular education being neceſſary for <hi>engineers</hi> and <hi>artillery</hi> officers in the ſtudy of mathematics, projectiles, mechanics, military architecture, ſurveying, drawing, &amp;c. But a proper eſtabliſhment in theſe two branches (duly maintained in ſtudy and practice) would, in caſe of any ſudden emergency, enable the <hi>preſent national militia,</hi> and the <hi>trained hundreds</hi> and <hi>thouſands,</hi> or HOSTS of the people, in their <hi>rotations</hi> of ſervice, to oppoſe, with ſufficient ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, any power (humanly ſpeaking) that could poſſibly be brought againſt them.

ARTHUR <hi>fought</hi> with the <hi>Saxons, Scots, Picts,</hi> &amp;c. muſt be readily allowed, and alſo that he <hi>fought not</hi> with the SARACENS; but if we conſider the men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of "SARACENOS" as a mere literary miſtake of an ignorant tranſcriber for SCANIOS or SCANDIOS, (an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient name, much leſs known to the vulgar at the time when this copy was wrote, than that of the SARACENS,) there will be no cauſe for farther cavil againſt the authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticity of the copy, becauſe ſuch a miſtake in a copy ought not to injure the credit of the original compiler of the work. And that the word SCANIOS, or SCANDIOS, was really intended, is manifeſt from the context (two pages farther) wherein expreſs mention is made of K. <hi>Arthur</hi>'s conqueſt of <hi>Scantia</hi> and <hi>Gutland,</hi> the countries from whence proceeded the moſt of Arthur's enemies, even the <hi>Saxons</hi> themſelves originally, (ſee Sheringham de Anglorum Gentis Origine,) if not the <hi>Picts</hi> alſo, the very nations mentioned by Mr. Prynne himſelf, and alſo by all the authors to whom he has appealed.</p>
                  <p>There is juſt ſuch another <hi>mere literal</hi> miſtake, a few pages farther, which, without proper warning, might ſtill farther induce a ſuperficial reader to ſuſpect the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticity of the exemplar; I mean the paſſage where mention is made of the election of king Ina, viz. <q>
                        <hi>qui electus ſuit in regem per</hi> ANGELUM,</q> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>who was elected king through</hi>
                     </q> (or by means of) "AN ANGEL, (a very improbable circumſtance,) inſtead of the obvious meaning of the original writer, i. e. "<hi>per</hi> ANGLIAM" "<hi>throughout</hi> ENGLAND." For, this latter ſenſe is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupported by the context immediately following, which relates, that <q>
                        <hi>Ina firſt obtained the monarchy of this</hi> WHOLE KINGDOM,</q> &amp;c. <q>
                        <hi>et qui</hi> PRIMO <hi>obtinuit monarchiam</hi> TOTIUS REGNI HUJUS <hi>poſt adventum</hi> AN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GLORUM <hi>in Brytanniam.</hi> PRIMUS <hi>enim fuit rex co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronatus</hi> ANGLORUM ET BRYTONUM SIMUL MANEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIUM IN BRITANNIA <hi>poſt adventum Saxonum,</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c. And a little farther the text relates that he obtained <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>Cornwall</hi> by his ſecond wife, as alſo the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Britiſh crown, which belonged to the laſt Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh king, Cadwallader; ſo that the circumſtance mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly intended to be expreſſed was the <hi>general acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of</hi> INA, <hi>as king over both the</hi> ENGLISH and the BRITONS, that is, <hi>"per Angliam,"</hi>

                     </q> and not <hi>"per Angelum."</hi> Nevertheleſs theſe two palpable errors of tranſcribers have been copied in all the ſubſequent editions of K. Edward's laws, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt animadverſion of the publiſhers to clear the original compilers, and their work, from the diſcredit of ſuch improbable circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to Mr. Prynne's objection to the antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>hundred</hi> courts, as declared in this addition to K. Edward's laws, viz. that <hi>"Arthur found this law," "Hanc legem invenit Arthurus," &amp;c.</hi> "and ſo" (by means thereof) <q>
                        <hi>united and confederated the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Britain into one,</hi>
                     </q> (et ita conſolidavit et confoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deravit regnum Britanniae univerſum ſemper in unum;) and that <q>
                        <hi>by virtue of</hi> THIS LAW <hi>the ſaid Arthur drove the</hi> SCANTIANS (or Scandinavinians) <hi>and enemies out of the kingdom,</hi>
                     </q> &amp;c. I muſt obſerve that Mr. Prynne has aſſigned nothing but <hi>negative evidence</hi> againſt the fact, which is by no means ſufficient to diſprove it. On the other hand, as <hi>Arthur</hi> did really ſucceed in <hi>uniting</hi> and <hi>ſtrengthening</hi> the kingdom againſt his <hi>enemies,</hi> the other part of the ſentence is the more probable, (that <q>
                        <hi>he found this law,</hi>
                     </q>) becauſe he certainly could not have pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued a more effectual and ſpeedy means of reſtoring a divided and weakened kingdom than by reviving and enforcing <hi>"this law,"</hi> which he is ſaid to have <hi>found;</hi> and, had he been as careful, <hi>after his ſucceſs, to maintain "this law,"</hi> and to eſtabliſh it in the countries which he conquered, with <hi>free</hi> and <hi>equal</hi> liberty to all the inhabitants, the happy effects of his ſucceſs would not have had ſo ſhort a duration.</p>
                  <p>For, though the Britons certainly <hi>had "this law"</hi> both before and after the time of <hi>Arthur,</hi> yet they generally <hi>had</hi> it rather in <hi>name</hi> than in <hi>uſe,</hi> or elſe they would certainly have been <hi>leſs diſſolute</hi> in their morals, and more <hi>united</hi> and powerful againſt their enemies. They <hi>had "this law,"</hi> I may ſay, much in the ſame manner as we <hi>have</hi> it at this day; it was really the <hi>law of the kingdom,</hi> but not duly maintained; the <hi>nominal diviſions</hi> remained, as at preſent, but theſe diviſions became <hi>local</hi> inſtead of <hi>popular;</hi> the mere <hi>diviſions of ſpace,</hi> inſtead of exact numerical <hi>diviſions of the people,</hi> which <hi>"this law"</hi> requires to be effective. A ſufficient anſwer to Mr. Prynne's objection, againſt the antiquity of <hi>"this law,"</hi> may be gathered from a former part of this tract, (p. 33-36.) where I have referred to ample evidence that the <hi>diviſions of hundreds and tithings</hi> (CENTURIAE

                           </q> And this muſt neceſſarily be underſtood from the very nature of <hi>Frankpledge,</hi> becauſe <hi>every man,</hi> according to this <hi>conſtitutional law,</hi> muſt be incorporated in ſome <hi>tithing</hi> and <hi>hundred,</hi> which are the regular component parts of every <hi>county-court,</hi> and not the mere <hi>landholders</hi> alone, as ſome perſons of late have erroneouſly conceived.</note>.</q> And therefore, I think, we may ſafely admit the aſſertion in this copy of K. Edward's law, that <q>
                        <hi>Arthur found this law,</hi>
                     </q> (notwithſtanding the authority of Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi> to the contrary,) and that the ſucceſs of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> monarch in <hi>uniting</hi> and confederating, by it, his whole kingdom againſt foreign and domeſtic <hi>enemies</hi> is an example per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly ſuitable to the purpoſe of my preſent work
<note n="†" place="bottom">At the time when K. Arthur is ſaid to have <hi>"found this law,"</hi> it was, perhaps, no more in general <hi>uſe</hi> than it is at preſent; for WE, even at this day, may alſo be ſaid to <hi>"find this law,"</hi> that is, we <hi>find it</hi> mentioned in all the law-writers of the beſt authority, as being the <hi>law and conſtitution of the kingdom,</hi> though the <hi>uſage</hi> is certainly loſt. In a caſe ſolemnly argued in the court of common pleas, even ſo late as the 5th K.

                           <hi>and it appeareth by the ſaid act of</hi> 18 Edw.

And, afterwards, we are told that <hi>Solomon</hi> made a ſpeech <hi>unto all</hi> Iſrael, 2 Chron. i. 2. <hi>to the captains of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every governor in all</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the chief of the fathers.</hi> And thus, when that pious prince <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was reſolved upon a reformation both of religion and manners, throughout his kingdom, it is ſaid, 2 Chron. xxix. 20. <hi>Then</hi> Hezekiah <hi>the king roſe early, and gathered the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers of the city, and went up to the houſe of the Lord.</hi>

                     <q>As to their judiciary capacity, they were not, ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpeaking, judges themſelves, but had the power of admitting what cauſes they thought were proper to come before the judges, and of rejecting what they looked upon as frivolous or unneceſſary to be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into. * * * * * *</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>Of the judiciary authority of theſe rulers, we read farther in the caſe of <hi>Jeremiah.</hi> When (another) <hi>Micaiah</hi> had heard his prophetical denunciations againſt <hi>Iſrael</hi> and <hi>Judah,</hi> Jer. xxxvi. 11. he went down <hi>into the king's houſe, into the ſcribe's chamber, where all the princes</hi> (theſe rulers) <hi>were ſitting,</hi> and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of it. And after, when <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was going out of the city into the land of Benjamin, <hi>Irijah,</hi> who ſuſpected that he was going to deſert to the army of the <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> who were lately broken up from beſieging the city, Jer. xxxvii. 12. <hi>took</hi> Jeremiah <hi>and brought him to the princes. Wherefore the princes were wroth with</hi> Jeremiah, <hi>and ſmote him, and put him in priſon.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>And upon his farther propheſying that <hi>the city ſhould be given into the band of the king of</hi> Babylon, <hi>Therefore the princes ſaid unto the king, We beſeech thee, let this man be put to death. Then</hi> Zedekiah <hi>the king ſaid, Behold he is in your hand; for the king is not he that can do any thing againſt you.</hi> Which ſhews that they bore a mighty ſway in the <hi>great council</hi> of the nation; and that, when they prayed judgement and execution againſt any one, even the king thought it moſt ſafe and prudent to comply with them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>The number of theſe <hi>rulers,</hi> in every city, was in proportion to the number of its inhabitants; as many <hi>thouſands</hi> as it contained, ſo many <hi>rulers,</hi> of that rank and denomination, belonged to it; from which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, the eſtimation and conſequence of each city was diſcernible at one view. And from this conſideration ariſes that fine alluſion of one of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets concerning the place where Chriſt ſhould be born; ſo underſtood and applied by <hi>the chief prieſts</hi> and <hi>ſcribes</hi> themſelves, as the Evangeliſt informs us. Mat. ii. 5. Mic. v. 2. <hi>But thou,</hi> Bethlehem Ephratah, <hi>though thou be little among the thouſands of</hi> Judah, (in compariſon of thoſe cities that have <hi>rulers of thouſands</hi> belonging to them,) <hi>yet out of thee he ſhall come forth unto me, that is, to be ruler in</hi> Iſrael; <hi>whoſe goings forth have been of old, from everlaſting.</hi> So exactly was almoſt every minute circumſtance, relating to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of mankind, delineated and foretold by thoſe divinely-inſpired writers, who lived ſo many hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years before he came into the world. * *</q>

                     <q>The <hi>captains of thouſands</hi> ſeem to have been much the ſame as colonels of regiments with us; and the <hi>captains of hundreds</hi> might probably anſwer to thoſe who, in our army, have the command of troops and companies; the <hi>captains of fifties</hi> and <hi>tens,</hi> to our ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balterns, ſerjeants and corporals.</q>

                     <q>Among the liſt of <hi>David</hi>'s adherents while he fled from <hi>Saul,</hi> 1 Chron. xii. 1.14. and <hi>kept himſelf cloſe at</hi> Ziklag; after ſeveral names mentioned, it is ſaid; <hi>Theſe were of the ſons of God, captains of the hoſt: one of the leaſt was over an hundred, and the greateſt over a thouſand.</hi> Again, we read of others ſaid, 1 Chron. xii. 20. to be <hi>captains of the thouſands that were of</hi> Manaſſeh. And, when <hi>David</hi> had thoughts of bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Ark of God</hi> from <hi>Kirjathjearim,</hi> we are told, 1 Chron. xiii. 1. he <hi>conſulted with the captains of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and hundreds, and with every leader.</hi> And again, when he declared his intentions about build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the temple, it is ſaid that he, 1 Chron. xxviii. 1. <hi>aſſembled all the princes of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>the princes of the tribes, and the captains of the companies that miniſtered to the king by courſe, and the captains over the thouſands, and the captains over the hundreds.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>So when <hi>Jehoiada</hi> the high-prieſt had a mind to bring on the reſtoration, by declaring <hi>Joaſh</hi> to be king, 2 Kings xi. 4. <hi>he ſent for the rulers over hundreds, with the captains, and the guard, and ſhewed them the king's ſon;</hi> and gave them proper inſtructions what they were to do. <hi>And the captains over the hundreds did according to all things that</hi> Jehoiada <hi>the prieſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded. And to the captains over hundreds did the prieſt give king</hi> David<hi>'s ſpears and ſhields, that were in the temple of the Lord. And he took the rulers over hundreds, and the captains, and the guard, and all the people of the land, and they brought down the king from the houſe of the Lord, and be ſate on the throne of the kings.</hi> And we read, 2 Kings i. 9, 11, 13. of <hi>three captains of fifties,</hi> who, with their fifties, were ſent ſucceſſively by <hi>Ahaziah,</hi> king of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to bring the prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> to him. The Apocryphal writings tell us, 1 Mac. iii. 55. that <hi>Judas ordained captains over the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, even captains over thouſands, and over hundreds, and over fifties, and over tens.</hi>

                     <q>Theſe officers, from the <hi>captain of the hoſt</hi> down to the loweſt ſubaltern, appear, after the monarchy took place, to have received their commiſſions from the king.</q> (Whereas they were before choſen by the people.) <q>When <hi>Samuel</hi> declares to the people the <hi>manner</hi> of the king that was to reign over them, this is part of it; 1 Sam. viii. 12. <hi>he will appoint him cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains over thouſands, and captains over fifties,</hi> &amp;c. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly when <hi>Saul</hi> began to grow jealous of <hi>David</hi>'s riſing glory, 1 Sam. xviii. 13. <hi>he removed him from him, and made him his captain over a thouſand.</hi> So we read, 2 Sam. xviii. 1. that <hi>David numbered the people that were with him, and ſet captains of thouſands, and captains of hundreds over them.</hi> 2 Chron. xxv. 5. and that <hi>Amaziah gathered</hi> Judah <hi>together, and made them captains over thouſands, and captains over hundreds.</hi>

THE preſent great national evil, the notorious <hi>miſrepreſentation</hi> of the commons in parliament, cannot <hi>ſafely</hi> be remedied or altered for the purpoſe of amendment, by any other mode than that of reverting back to the firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of the conſtitution, and by revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the <hi>ancient rights</hi> of all denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or claſſes of the people; at the ſame time carefully rejecting every <hi>inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation</hi> that is not <hi>conſiſtent in principle</hi> with the <hi>ancient uſages</hi> of the realm, of which the <hi>certain effects</hi> are already known: whereas no human prudence can inſure the <hi>real</hi> tendency and final effect of <hi>an innovation</hi> in matters of ſtate, howſoever plauſible it may at firſt appear.</p>

            <p>In the great annual courts of <hi>Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pledge</hi> throughout the kingdom, <hi>every houſekeeper</hi> was incorporated with nine other neighbouring <hi>houſekeepers,</hi> (arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhops,

<pb n="249" facs="tcp:0996200400:249"/>certain intereſt in the ſtate, paying ſcot and lot, being liable to all <hi>national,</hi> as well as <hi>county</hi> and <hi>pariſh,</hi> rates.</p>
            <p>And theſe ten <hi>Freeborgs</hi> of each <hi>tithing</hi> were ſtill farther diſtinguiſhed by the title of <hi>deciners,</hi> (i. e. <hi>decenarii,</hi>) a term very properly expreſſive of their rank and quality as fixed and permanent members of a <hi>decenary,</hi> conſiſting of <hi>ten</hi> ſuch aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated members, one of which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually elected <hi>chief of the ten,</hi> or <hi>tithing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The term <hi>deciner</hi> has been very much miſtaken and miſrepreſented by law wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; ſome applying it merely to the head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, or <hi>capitalis-friborgus,</hi> the <hi>ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingman,</hi> or head of each ten <hi>free-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſſes;</hi> and others again to <hi>every man</hi> that was included in a <hi>tithing;</hi> which is a groſs abuſe of the term: for a <hi>tithing</hi> may conſiſt of many more than <hi>ten,</hi> (even 20 or 30 males,) yet the <hi>ten houſekeepers</hi>

            <p>Again, the word <hi>denizen</hi> has ſtrangely puzzled the etymologiſts; who have ſought its derivation, ſome from the French tongue, others again from the antient <hi>Britiſh,</hi> but both equally in vain: For, though it appears, that the <hi>Britons</hi> had the term <hi>denizen</hi> in uſe amongſt them before the coming in of the Anglo-Saxons, yet, as all the <hi>Roman colonies,</hi> eſtabliſhed among the Britons, were not only divided into <hi>centuriae</hi> or <hi>hundreds,</hi> but had alſo their <hi>decuriones,</hi> and conſequently <hi>decena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> alſo, (for the captain of <hi>the ten</hi> could not be without <hi>the nine</hi> whom he headed,) both in their <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>military</hi> govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it is clear, that the term <hi>denizen</hi> is of pure <hi>Latin</hi> original, from the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral adjective <hi>deni,</hi> forming the Latin verb
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0996200400:251"/>
               <hi>denizo,</hi> to expreſs the adoption of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon into all the franchiſes and rights of a <hi>decenary.</hi> And our law-writers have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly uſed the participle <hi>denizatus,</hi> and the derivative ſubſtantive <hi>denizatio,</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the introduction of <hi>aliens</hi> to the fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſes of natural-born ſubjects, and yet they have not perceived the obvious mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of theſe words both in ſenſe and ſound.</p>
            <p>For the alien is admitted by <hi>denization</hi> to all the rights of mutual protection en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed by the community of natives in their eſtabliſhed <hi>decenaries;</hi> and if he then becomes a houſekeeper, and one of the <hi>ten</hi> houſekeepers, who jointly conſtitute a tithing, or <hi>decinary,</hi> he is, of courſe, a <hi>deciner;</hi> and, with other <hi>deciners,</hi> is an incorporated member of the county which he inhabits; for, as the <hi>hundreds</hi> are the conſtituent parts of the <hi>county,</hi> and the <hi>tithings</hi> the conſtituent parts of each <hi>hundred,</hi> it neceſſarily follows, that the
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0996200400:252"/>
               <hi>deciners</hi> are ſuitors of the <hi>county-courts;</hi> which right at preſent is very improperly attributed to the <hi>freeholders,</hi> or (more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly) to the <hi>land-owners</hi> alone; for the right of the deciners, or <hi>free burgeſſes,</hi> to the county-courts is demonſtrated by the examples which have been given of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral elections for <hi>knights, citizens, and burgeſſes, all together promiſcuouſly in the county-courts;</hi> which I have recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a former tract
<note n="*" place="bottom">See <q>Equitable Repreſentation neceſſary to the Eſtabliſhment of Law, Peace, and good government,</q> &amp;c. p. 22-29.</note>, as <hi>one</hi> means of reducing the enormous diſproportion of repreſentation (at preſent enjoyed by ſome particular <hi>boroughs,</hi> to the effectual diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>franchiſement of all the reſt!) whereby the kingdom has loſt the means of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>ſenſe of the people</hi> in parliament; and the king has been <hi>deluded</hi> by majorities of alternate factions; factions, which, falſely calling themſelves <hi>the commons of
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0996200400:253"/>England,</hi> have plunged the nation into deſperate meaſures and enormous ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences, and thereby loaded it with a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, which it cannot poſſibly bear and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trieve without a ſpeedy reformation.</p>
            <p>Though the repreſentatives of cities are now called <hi>citizens,</hi> yet it appears that all cities and large towns have their right of voting as being ancient <hi>boroughs;</hi> that is, they had their right of voting from the inhabitants being <hi>freo-borges,</hi> or <hi>free-pledges</hi> of each other, in their reſpective <hi>decenaries,</hi> as <hi>deciners;</hi> and their right of becoming <hi>deciners</hi> aroſe from their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>houſeholders,</hi>

                  <hi>paying each of them year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an annual rent:</hi>
               </q> for that is the true definition of <hi>burgage-tenure,</hi> as deſcribed by Littleton; and therefore, not only <hi>houſeholders</hi> whoſe houſes are their own property, but alſo EVERY RENTER OF A HOUSE, OR TENEMENT, <hi>who is equally

<pb n="255" facs="tcp:0996200400:255"/>in ſome other places, partly through the encroachments of <hi>purchaſers of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughs,</hi> to reduce the number of voters; and partly by granting excluſive privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges to a <hi>few people</hi> in the incorporated chartered boroughs.</p>
            <p>The ſhorteſt and moſt eaſy mode of reſtoring, to <hi>all the houſeholders of this realm, their ancient right of voting,</hi> is, firſt, to reſtore their ancient capacity of DECINERS, by adviſing them to <hi>throw themſelves</hi> into tithings or <hi>decenaries;</hi> and to hold an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual courts of <hi>Frankpledge</hi> (now too long neglected) for the <hi>renewal</hi> and continual preſervation of the <hi>tithing aſſociations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this means both the <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> government of the people will be completely reſtored, and peace and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence will be completely ſecured, ſo that <hi>houſebreaking</hi> and <hi>robbery</hi> will no longer be known amongſt us, for ſuch was <hi>once</hi> the happy ſtate of the kingdom; and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0996200400:256"/>by the <hi>very ſame</hi> regulations here recommended. A farther advantage, by reſtoring this ancient, legal, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional, mode of government, will be, that the exact proportions of the people in each county, who have a <hi>right to vote,</hi> will be truly aſcertained; whereby may <hi>hereafter</hi> be introduced a repreſentation of all the counties, <hi>perfectly equal,</hi> in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their reſpective numbers of <hi>houſeholders:</hi> for if, in each county, divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were formed, conſiſting each of 200 <hi>decenaries</hi> or <hi>tithings,</hi> (including 2000 houſeholders each,) that proportion will be found, on calculation, to contain the moſt convenient and proper number to be joined in the election of <hi>one deputy</hi> for parliament, in order to obtain an <hi>equal repreſentation</hi> of <hi>all the families in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> and no perſons will be excluded but ſervants and others, who have <hi>no fixed habitation of their own;</hi> and, conſequently,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0996200400:257"/>at preſent, have no permanent intereſt in the ſtate; or, at leaſt, do not bear ſo large a proportion of relief to its burdens as the <hi>houſekeepers</hi> do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Two thouſand</hi> families might well af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford to pay ample wages to <hi>one</hi> repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative; and the ſtipend might be very eaſily collected, if the <hi>decenaries</hi> were duly formed and eſtabliſhed, and the ſeveral courts which regularly ariſe from the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenaries,</hi> viz. the <hi>hundred courts;</hi> and thoſe which might moſt conveniently be added to ſuperintend and regulate the <hi>hundred courts,</hi> viz. the court of <hi>one thouſand</hi> families, (anſwering to thoſe of the Iſraelitiſh commonwealth, the <hi>thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands</hi> of Ephraim, the <hi>thouſands</hi> of Judah,) and laſtly the junction of TWO <hi>ſuch courts of the thouſand, for the election of</hi> ONE <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative.</hi> This laſt propoſed court of 2000 <hi>houſeholders</hi> would probably be
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:0996200400:258"/>equal to what ſome of the old <hi>trithing courts</hi> formerly were; which are ſaid to have ſometimes included the third or fourth part of a county.</p>
            <p>If every diviſion of 2000 <hi>families</hi> were to elect <hi>one</hi> deputy to repreſent them in the great <hi>common council</hi> of the kingdom, the whole number of <hi>repreſentatives,</hi> for South Britain, would amount (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſent ſtate of population) to about 476
<note n="*" place="bottom">This calculation is formed from the account of the number of houſes charged, chargeable, and excuſed, in 1777, viz. 952, 734.

In my former propoſal, from which this is extracted, where I make the number of repreſentatives amount to 500, I have, for the ſake of a round number, followed Dr. Price's advice, when he ſays, concerning the number of houſes, in p. 14. <q>

THE propoſal for a ſettlement on the coaſt of Africa will deſerve all en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, if the ſettlers are <hi>abſolutely prohibited from holding any kind of proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the perſons of men, as ſlaves, and from ſelling either man, woman, or child.</hi> Even <hi>to claim</hi> any human perſon, as <hi>a ſlave,</hi> ought to be conſidered as an affront to the whole community, and be puniſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the propoſal for leave to <hi>purchaſe ſlaves,</hi> the permiſſion, if grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at all, muſt be very carefully guarded; and the price given muſt be conſidered and declared, at the time of purchaſe, to be a mere <hi>pecuniary debt for redemption,</hi> due from the perſon purchaſed to the ſociety or ſtate of the ſettlement; and by
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0996200400:262"/>no means to be tranferred to any ſingle individual, (which would introduce do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic tyranny and traffic in the bodies of men,) but the debt to be diſcharged at leiſure, without increaſe or intereſt, whenever the redeemed, or his friends, ſhall tender the amount of the firſt price; in default of which, the price ſhould be worked out by a limited proportional ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to the ſtate; and the ſtate ſhould hold forth, at the ſame time, ample encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to engage compliance and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion: but it ſhould be an eſtabliſhed principle, that the ſtate or ſociety ought rather to loſe the value of the purchaſe than, <hi>by compulſion, to enforce involuntary ſervitude,</hi> whereby honeſt labour, that ſhould always be deemed honourable, is rendered odious and ſlaviſh.</p>
            <p>Rules muſt alſo be laid down to prevent <hi>the monopoly of land</hi> within the bounds of the ſettlement: and a ſufficient reſerve of
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0996200400:263"/>
               <hi>land</hi> muſt be made for public ſervices <hi>(ſchools and religious inſtruction)</hi> in each townſhip; and for <hi>cottage land</hi> to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed in ſmall parcels to new ſettlers and redeemed captives; which parcels <hi>muſt revert to the ſtate or community, for the ſame benevolent inveſtiture to others of the like condition,</hi> as ſoon as the temporary poſſeſſors are enabled to purchaſe larger lots; for it will prevent, in ſome degree, the monopoly of land, if the <hi>cottage-lots</hi> are untenable with other land. <hi>Common land</hi> ſhould alſo be reſerved for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent diſtance round each town and village, wherein <hi>all inhabitants,</hi> rich and poor, ſhould have an <hi>equal perſonal right:</hi> becauſe <hi>the claims of rich landholders,</hi> when made in proportion to the ſize of their bordering eſtates, is unreaſonable and unjuſt; and has occaſioned a cruel perverſion of the utility of common lands in England: for the live ſtocks of rich
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0996200400:264"/>farmers, occaſionally turned looſe upon the commons, generally deprived the cattle of the poor inhabitants of their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſuſtenance; and the late diviſions for encloſures, by act of parliament, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been, for the moſt part, inconſiderate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly granted in the ſame unjuſt proportions, have at length nearly annihilated <hi>the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon lands of England:</hi> whereas, on the contrary, the large poſſeſſions of the neighbouring landholders ought, in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and natural juſtice, rather to have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded them from the leaſt ſhare in the inheritance of the poor inhabitants; or, at moſt; their ſhare ſhould have been <hi>merely perſonal,</hi> as men, and individuals, <hi>equal to,</hi> but not exceeding, the claims of their neighbours, that the <hi>common lands</hi> might be truly <hi>in common.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The managers, entruſted with the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety's property to form the ſettlement, ſhould have no ſettled dominion or au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0996200400:265"/>over the people as governors or judges, but ſhould be contented with that ſuperiority and influence, which their pecuniary truſt, as agents and overſeers for the ſociety, will naturally afford them; and their ſervices may be amply rewarded and encouraged after the firſt year's ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, by an admiſſion to a due proportion or ſhare with the members of the ſociety in the general profits of the ſettlement, and in the profits of the common or public trade of the ſociety; but <hi>no private trade</hi> whatſoever ſhould be permitted to any of the ſociety's managers and agents.</p>
            <p>The officers for internal government, as the governor or mayor, the ſheriffs and other magiſtrates, conſtables, &amp;c. &amp;c. ſhould be <hi>freely elected every year by all the inhabitants,</hi> due qualifications being premiſed to render men eligible to offices of dignity and truſt.</p>

                  <p>
                     <q>Theſe regulations might be eaſily reſtored and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered as effectual as ever. The prepoſſeſſions of the people are ſtrongly in their favour; and, perhaps, no others can be contrived which will not ſet the body of the people <hi>at enmity</hi> with government; which will perfectly allay their apprehenſions and jealouſies; will make them the miniſters of their own ſecurity, while the power of the king <hi>reaches every individual of them, by a chain, every link of which is effectual,</hi> and <hi>will not interfere with the prerogative of the king in other departments of the ſtate,</hi> however the buſineſs of them may be adminiſtered. * * * *</q>

                  <p>"If you mean that it is impracticable," (ſays he, in letter III.) <q>becauſe the inhabitants of this country are too far advanced in luxury, too indolent, too effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, to enter on any plan of ſecurity, which will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the leaſt trouble, or put them to the leaſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience; and if you can aſcertain this fact, I have no anſwer to make. But the trouble and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience are ſuch as would not be complained of by women. What is it but an amuſement to learn the common uſe of arms? What inconvenience to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to ſuch regulations as may bring together a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, a pariſh, the ward of a city, a town, a diſtrict, &amp;c. to clear them of vagabonds, occaſionally to aſſiſt the civil magiſtrate, and to lay the baſis of a general ſecurity, confidence, and ſtrength, where it ought to be laid, in the whole body of the people?</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>I will venture to affirm, that there is no other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod by which diſturbances, riots, and inſurrections, can be prevented, without debaſing the people into the condition of brutes: and there is no other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod by which a king may hold every man in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in his hands; while every man in the nation would feel and know himſelf to be as free as it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible he ſhould be in ſociety.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>Hints have been thrown out of acts of parliament which render ſuch aſſociations, as I recommend, ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal; but the acts are not ſpecified. I know there are laws forbidding a man's going armed, in a time of tranquillity and peace, without leave from a magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, and ſpecifying ſuch aſſemblies of people as are dangerous and ſeditious; but without the moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant reference to the right which every man has, from nature, from the connivance of the moſt deſpotic go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments, and from the expreſs proviſions of the Engliſh conſtitution, to provide for his own defence and that of his family; and to unite with his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, under the eye and direction of the ſupreme magiſtrate, for the general peace and order of the community.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>If there were ſuch laws as you mention, they could not poſſibly have effect, againſt not only <hi>a neceſſary right or nature, but an eſſential principle of the Engliſh conſtitution.</hi> If a law were made, that, becauſe it is <hi>poſſible</hi> an Engliſh elector may become venal, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all electors muſt relinquiſh the right of voting,— would this conſtitute an obligation? Will any man ſay, that the legiſlature is competent to the making of ſuch a law?—how much leſs to annihilate the firſt and moſt important principles of human ſociety, by awarding, that, as it is poſſible men may make an improper uſe of their limbs, or their arms, which may be as neceſſary as their limbs, they muſt therefore ſuffer them to be <hi>taken off.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <q>The power of the legiſlature, like every power in human ſociety, is limited by certain and accurate bounds; it may exceed theſe bounds, and commit abſurdities, and even offences. The Engliſh legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature is juſt as competent to make a law, by which every Engliſhman may be baniſhed to the Orkneys, or put to death, as it is to enjoin the people to give up the right of ſelf-defence and preſervation, by the uſe of their limbs, or by the uſe of arms.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>The apprehenſion that aſſociations will produce commotions and riots, inſtead of preventing them, muſt be pretended only. And all the arguments for depriving the people of the right of aſſociating, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have often aſſembled for miſchievous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, are deluſive. Cardinal de Retz ſays, that all numerous aſſemblies are mobs; and I will add, that all mobs are miſchievous. Let the people, who might form ſuch aſſemblies, <hi>be divided into ſmall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; and, though the individuals be not improved, they will act reaſonably and well.</hi> The deſign of aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is, to <hi>prevent large and tumultuous aſſemblies; to arrange the people under the eye of government,</hi> as accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately as an army, <hi>without diminiſhing their conſtitutional independence and liberty;</hi> to increaſe the difficulty of miſleading them, and to deſtroy all ideas of <hi>appeals to them.</hi>

                     <q>Here I beg to be underſtood, not as aiming at any of the rights of the people: but the idea of an <hi>appeal to them</hi> has been borrowed from the government of <hi>Rome;</hi> in England it is, like the introduction of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary force, a thing that negligence or miſmanage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may render <hi>neceſſary;</hi> but the conſtitution is perfect without it; no ſuppoſition is made of the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of having any occaſion to make it; and, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it is made, the remedy may be as hazardous as any evil it can be deſigned to remove.

SEVERAL years ago I made ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandums of <q>
                  <hi>A Method of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing frontier Settlements,</hi>
               </q> which I co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied from the ſecond edition of a book firſt printed at Philadelphia, but reprinted at London in 1766, and intituled <q>
                  <hi>An Hiſtorical Account of the Expedition againſt the Ohio Indians, in the Year</hi> 1764, <hi>under the Command of Henry Bouquet, Eſq. to which are annexed Military Papers, containing Reflections on the War with the Savages; a Method of forming frontier Settlements,</hi>
               </q> 
               <hi>&amp;c.</hi> My reference for the laſt-mentioned ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is to p. 51 of the ſaid book; but, as I have not the book itſelf at preſent, I cannot pretend to be perfectly accurate in my quotations from it; neither do I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0996200400:282"/>whether the author recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a government by <hi>tithing</hi> and <hi>hundred</hi> courts, with their proper officers, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Anglo-Saxon model; but only that his propoſed ſettlements were (happily for my preſent purpoſe) laid out in equal diviſions of <hi>one hundred</hi> lots each, for the maintenance of <hi>one hundred</hi> families; ſo that, of courſe, the conſtitutional regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations for <hi>hundreds,</hi> recommended in the preceding tracts, will not be leſs ſuitable and beneficial to <hi>his</hi> ſcheme than <hi>his</hi> certainly is to mine.</p>
            <p>"Let us ſuppoſe a ſettlement" (ſays he) <q>to be formed for <hi>one hundred fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,</hi> compoſed of five perſons each upon an average.</q>

            <p>
               <q>The four ſides of the ſquare mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures 7040 yards, which gives to each
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0996200400:283"/>houſe about 70 yards in front, to ſtoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kade, and the ground, allowed for building, will be 210 feet front and about 100 feet deep.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>An acre of ground will produce at leaſt 30 buſhels of Indian corn; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, two acres are ſufficient to ſupply five perſons at the rate of 12 buſhels each perſon; two other acres will be for cows and ſheep, another for hay, or to be ſown with red clover; the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining half acre may be laid out for a garden.</q> Thus far the author's plan may be applicable to lands even in England, eſpecially if laid out in leſs diviſions of <hi>tithings,</hi> inſtead of <hi>hundreds,</hi> preſerving the ſame due proportion of land in lots for each family. The <hi>ten</hi> fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies with their habitations would form a compact little village, under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>tithing-man,</hi> annually elected from among themſelves, whereby all
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0996200400:284"/>would be rendered mutually reſponſible for each other, for the common peace; and to make good every damage that might be occaſioned by the ill behaviour of any individual among them. An eſtate laid out in ſmall farms, with ſuch a <hi>tithing</hi> village in the centre of it, for a conſtant ſupply of labourers, might be made to maintain a much greater number of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple than land generally does in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way of farming; and would, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, be much more beneficial both to the landlords and to the nation at large. Commons and waſte foreſts or chaſes might thus be laid out and occupied by the labouring poor, to the great reduction of pariſh rates as well as of the price of labour; for, free and uſeful labourers would never be wanting, if ſuch a regular proviſion, under their own management could be found for their families. But the poſſeſſion of ſuch pariſh-lots ſhould
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0996200400:285"/>be limited to thoſe perſons, who occupy no other land; and ſhould be delivered up to the pariſh or community, for the uſe of other unprovided families, as ſoon as any poſſeſſor obtains more land, either as a farm, or in fee, (as recommended in a former Tract,) to prevent <hi>the monopoly of land,</hi> and the entire deprivation of the poor from any ſhare in it, as at preſent.</p>
            <p>The remainder of the author's ſcheme is ſuitable only to unoccupied countries, like many parts of Africa and America, where the people are few, and the lands of ſmall value, viz. "Round the town" (ſays he) <q>are the commons of three miles ſquare, containing, excluſive of the lots above-mentioned, 5120 acres. On three ſides of the town, five other ſquares will be laid out, of three ſquare miles, containing 5760 acres each; one of which is reſerved for wood, for the uſe of the ſettlement; the other four
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0996200400:286"/>to be divided into 25 out-lots, or plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, of about 230 acres each; ſo that in the four ſquares there will be 100 ſuch plantations, for the 100 fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. Another townſhip may be laid out joining this, upon the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ame plan, and as many more as you pleaſe, upon the ſame line, without loſing any ground.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The following is a rough Sketch of the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0996200400:287"/>
               <figure/>

            <p>
               <pb n="292" facs="tcp:0996200400:288"/>The banks of the river (as in ancient times) ſhould be deemed <hi>common</hi> or <hi>public</hi> as the river itſelf, under the conſervation of the <hi>community;</hi> and ſhould be reſerved for future improvements, (as for the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation, not only of fiſhermen, but alſo of manufacturers, traders, and of all induſtrious ſtrangers,) and docks, or navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable cuts (whenever the level of the country will permit) ſhould be made from the river, as far back, at leaſt, as the centre between every two townſhips.</p>
            <p>The ſpaces between the ſquares are left for roads and common communications between the ſeveral lots; and the roads which divide two diſtinct townſhips ſhould be ſtill more ſpacious for the common uſe of all the inhabitants, the cartage of their produce and other traffic, the dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of cattle, &amp;c. and a ſpacious road, to be formed lengthways throughout the whole ſettlement, ought, in forming the
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:0996200400:289"/>lots, to be reſerved through the centre of each townſhip: the central lots, which will thereby be diminiſhed in <hi>ſize,</hi> will find ample compenſation, in <hi>value,</hi> by their ſituation on the great central road, which I have expreſſed by a dotted line. I do not remember whether any roads, or ſpaces for them, were expreſſed in the original plan of the author.</p>
            <p>I would likewiſe deviate from the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal plan of the author, with reſpect to the ſituation of the 5760 acres of wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for each townſhip; which, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, had better be reſerved in one of the moſt diſtant ſquares, at an angular ſituation from each town, inſtead of being in the oppoſite ſquare, according to his propoſal: for the towns will not only be more healthy, by having the uncleared lands more diſtant from them, but alſo the inhabitants, when on watch and ward duty, will be better enabled to diſcover
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0996200400:290"/>the approach of any lurking ſavages, or other enemies in time of war.</p>

                  <p>Thus it appears that the conqueſt of <hi>Ireland</hi> by King Edgar did not affect the juſt liberties of the <hi>church of Ireland;</hi> for the <hi>Norman</hi> colonies therein ſtill enjoyed the uninfluenced <hi>election</hi> of their own Biſhops: and though they acknowledged the juriſdiction of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Canterbury in <hi>eccleſiaſtical matters,</hi> even when they were become <hi>independent,</hi> and ſeparated from us, under a King of their own, yet that ſubmiſſion was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly <hi>voluntary</hi> and <hi>free,</hi> and was continued for no other reaſon than becauſe they had originally received <hi>epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal ordination</hi> from the Archbiſhops of that ſee. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs they declared themſelves at liberty to receive conſecration from the Archbiſhop of Armagh, and other Iriſh Biſhops, (who earneſtly deſired to confer it on them.) in caſe the prelates of Canterbury ſhould be negligent in their ſuperintendency. And the Biſhops alſo of the <hi>native Iriſh</hi> and their flocks were equally free and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent in <hi>eccleſiaſtical matters,</hi> having preſerved a due ſucceſſion of the ſacred order of epiſcopacy from the early times of their <hi>firſt</hi> converſion (<hi>before</hi> the time of the <hi>firſt Patrick</hi>) down to the barbarous times of our K. Henry II. who invaded their iſland, under the deluſive ſanction of a <hi>papal commiſſion,</hi> to compel the ſubmiſſion of the <hi>church of Ireland</hi> to the juriſdiction and doctrines of the <hi>church of Rome,</hi> and to pay an annual tribute to the pope of one penny for every houſe; and all this on the deluſive pretence of <hi>inſtructing</hi> the Iriſh, <hi>reforming their manners,</hi> &amp;c. Henry obtained his firſt commiſſion for theſe pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes from pope Adrian IV. A. D. 1155, which Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop Uſher has inſerted in his ſaid collection of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient epiſtles, p. 109. And he informs us, in p. 152. (from <hi>Trivettus,</hi>) that Henry treated with his parliament at Wincheſter concerning the <hi>conqueſt of Ireland,</hi> but, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it did not pleaſe his mother the empreſs, that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition was poſtponed to another time.

                  <p>Afterwards, however, in the year 1172, Pope Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander III. revived the former wicked and preſumptuous grant of Adrian, for invading and uſurping the <hi>temporal rights</hi> as well as ſpiritual juriſdiction of the <hi>clergy and people of Ireland,</hi> (whereby "<hi>the dominion of the Iriſh kingdom was</hi> INDULGED <hi>to</hi>" Henry,) and, in the pleni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of his <hi>unlimited</hi> and <hi>unlawful</hi> power, this <q>

                     </q> &amp;c. (a work commonly attributed to the late lord-chancellor <hi>King,</hi>) has laboured hard to level the <hi>primitive Biſhops</hi> to the degree of mere <hi>Rectors of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes,</hi> and to elevate the <hi>Preſbyters</hi> to the rank of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> though there are clear proofs of the ſuperiority of <hi>Biſhops</hi> (and of the ordinary reſidence, in each place, but of <hi>one</hi> Biſhop, with <hi>ſeveral</hi> Preſbyters and Deacons at the ſame time) included even in ſome of the citations which he has collected to favour a contrary doctrine. His opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion ſeems to have been built principally on a peculiar explanation of the word <hi>ordination.</hi> "That <hi>ordination,</hi>" (ſays he,) <q>that I ſhall ſpeak of, is this, the grant of a peculiar commiſſion and power, which remains inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible in the perſon to whom it is committed, and can never be obliterated or raſed out, except the perſon himſelf cauſe it by his hereſie, apoſtacy, or moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely groſs and ſcandalous impiety.</q> (Thus far there is no need to oppoſe his ſenſe of <hi>ordination;</hi> but he adds,) "Now this ſort of <hi>ordination</hi>" (ſays he) <q>was conferred <hi>only upon Deacons and Preſbyters,</hi> or <hi>on Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons and Biſhops, Preſbyters and Biſhops being here to be conſidered as all one,</hi> as Miniſters of the church univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal,</q> p. 115. This appears to be the key-ſtone, whereby the whole fabric of the doctrine throughout his work is ſuſpended and held up, and conſequently, the whole building muſt fall by the removal of it! Very happily, for the determination of the diſpute, he has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced (within a few pages after the place from whence this quotation was taken) ſome clear and unqueſtionable examples of the <hi>ordination</hi> of ſome perſons to the degree of <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> who really <hi>were not Biſhops,</hi> and never had <hi>epiſcopal</hi> dignity in the ordinary eccleſiaſtical ſenſe of the word <hi>epiſcopal,</hi> ſo that they could not, conſiſtently with truth, <hi>"be conſidered as all one"</hi> with <hi>Biſhops,</hi> according to this learned writer's hypotheſis.</p>
                  <p>He cites (in p. 133.) the expreſs teſtimony of Euſebius for the <hi>ordination</hi> of ORIGEN to be a <hi>Preſbyter,</hi> 
                     <q>that the Biſhops of Caeſarea and Jeruſalem <hi>ordained</hi>

Here then is a clear proof of the ordination of a perſon to be a <hi>Preſbyter,</hi> by the hands of <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and yet no man, that has any regard to the teſtimony and truth of eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, will preſume to ſay that <hi>Origen</hi> was a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> though he was unqueſtionably or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to be a <hi>Preſbyter;</hi> and, conſequently, it cannot be true, that the ordination of "<hi>Preſbyters</hi> and <hi>Biſhops</hi>" is <hi>"to be conſidered as all one."</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By another quotation, in p. 135, from Euſebius, this learned writer proves alſo that <q>
                        <hi>Novatian was ordained a</hi> PRESBYTER <hi>by impoſition of hands,</hi>
                     </q> i.e. the hands of a BISHOP, as Euſebius declares: <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>. Cornel. apud Euſeb. lib. 6. cap. 43. p. 245.</p>
                  <p>And that this is a clear example of <hi>the ordination of a mere Preſbyter,</hi> manifeſtly diſtinct from <hi>ordination to the epiſcopal dignity,</hi> is demonſtrated by the ſame chapter of Euſebius, which relates the wicked fraud of <hi>this ſame Preſbyter,</hi> Novatian, at a time when he was already a <hi>Preſbyter,</hi> to obtain a <hi>farther ordination</hi> for the <hi>epiſcopal</hi> dignity, by inveigling three ſimple country Biſhops to <hi>ordain him a Biſhop</hi> by the impoſition of their hands. And therefore, though <hi>all Biſhops</hi> are certainly <hi>Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> yet theſe examples, cited by the learned writer, clearly demonſtrate that <hi>all Preſbyters are</hi> NOT <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and, conſequently, that their <hi>ordination</hi> is NOT <q>
                        <hi>to be conſidered as all one.</hi>
                     </q> The rite of ordination (i. e. <hi>the laying on of hands by the Biſhops, after ſolemn prayer of the whole congregation for the aſſiſtance of the Holy Spirit</hi>) is, indeed, <hi>"all one,"</hi> as well in the ordaining of <hi>Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons,</hi> as in the ordination of <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of Biſhops, differing only in the <hi>deſignation</hi> to theſe reſpective offices of the Chriſtian Miniſtry, as I have already remarked in p. 316 n; but then this ſingle circumſtance of <hi>deſignation</hi> is ſufficiently effectual to occaſion an <hi>eſſential</hi> difference in the three degrees of holy <hi>orders;</hi> for what are <hi>orders</hi> but <hi>deſignations,</hi> or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations of the office conferred, or function to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged? inſomuch that a perſon who hath been duly ordained by the <hi>ſame ſolemn rite,</hi> with a <hi>deſignation</hi> to the office of a <hi>Deacon,</hi> may not aſſume the office of a <hi>Preſbyter,</hi> without a <hi>repetition of that rite,</hi> and an expreſs <hi>order,</hi> or <hi>deſignation,</hi> to the office and duty of a <hi>Preſbyter;</hi> and a <hi>Preſbyter,</hi> who has <hi>twice</hi> received holy <hi>orders</hi> by the ſame ſolemn rite, cannot lawfully aſſume the dignity and office of a Biſhop, until he hath been <hi>firſt</hi> duly <hi>elected to be a Biſhop;</hi> and, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> (which is the <hi>moſt eſſential</hi> circumſtance, by which <hi>epiſcopal</hi> authority is really con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred,) until he have been once more <hi>ordered,</hi> or <hi>ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> (notwithſtanding his two former <hi>orders,</hi> as a Deacon, and as a <hi>Preſbyter,</hi>) and that with a repetition of the <hi>ſame ſolemn rite,</hi> (the laying on of hands with previous pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,) but differing in this, that there is always an expreſs <hi>order,</hi> or <hi>deſignation,</hi> to the <hi>epiſcopal</hi> function, previous to the prayers and laying on of hands. The example of <hi>Novatian,</hi> cited above, ſhews that the <hi>re-ordination</hi> of <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> in order to obtain the degree and function of a <hi>Biſhop,</hi> was <hi>deemed neceſſary,</hi> even early in the third century. Other examples, which I have quoted in pages 340-342 n. concerning the <hi>re-ordination</hi> of <hi>Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters</hi> that had been <hi>elected</hi> to be <hi>Biſhops,</hi> prove that the ſame opinion as well as <hi>practice</hi> was preſerved in the middle centuries of Chriſtianity; and the <hi>preſent</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal practice of the epiſcopal church, in giving <hi>prieſts orders</hi> always previous to <hi>epiſcopal</hi> conſecration, is too well known and eſtabliſhed, to need the citation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular examples for illuſtration.</p>
                  <p>The learned Chancellor (if he was the writer of the ſaid book) hath alſo <hi>ſuppoſed,</hi> that the petition of a <hi>candidate for holy orders</hi> 
                     <q>was to the whole Preſbytery, becauſe</q> (ſays he, p. 115.) <q>a Biſhop alone could not give thoſe holy orders, as is moſt evident</q> (ſays he) <q>from <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who aſſures us, that <hi>all clerical ordinations were performed by the common counſel of the whole Preſbytery;</hi> and, therefore,</q> (ſays he,) <q>when, upon a <hi>moſt urgent and neceſſary occaſion,</hi> he had been forced to ordain one but a <hi>Lector,</hi> without the advice and conſent of his <hi>Preſbytery,</hi> which, one would be apt to think, was no great uſurpation, he takes great pains to juſtify and excuſe himſelf for ſo doing.</q> But all this ſuppoſition falls, at once, to the ground, as ſoon as the authority, which he has cited for it, (Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prian's 24th Epiſt.) is more carefully examined; for it really contains no ſuch doctrine, and doth <hi>not at all</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to <hi>"clerical ordinations,"</hi> which he has too haſtily ſuppoſed; Cyprian had <hi>not</hi> given <hi>"holy orders"</hi> (the ſubject of the learned writer's argument) to the perſons for whoſe appointment he thought it neceſſary to apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize in that epiſtle; for they were ſtill <hi>"ſub clero,"</hi> as he expreſsly declares, <hi>under the degree of clergy;</hi> ſo that the apology could not be for having <hi>ordained</hi> any one in the <hi>eccleſiaſtical</hi> ſenſe of that word; but only for <q>
                        <hi>having</hi> MADE (or appointed) one man a <hi>Lector,</hi> or <hi>Reader,</hi> in the church, and for <hi>having</hi> MADE another man a <hi>Subdeacon.</hi>

                     </q> Theſe were mere local functions in the church, at the diſpoſal, not only of the <hi>Preſbyters</hi> and Deacons, but alſo of the <hi>laity,</hi> or whole congregation, who have a <hi>right</hi> to elect to ſuch offices, in many places, even to this day; ſo that an apology was really neceſſary in this caſe, for having acted <hi>without their conſent;</hi> but no apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy would have been due, had the caſe been a <hi>mere or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> or <hi>conferring of holy orders.</hi> The example is entirely foreign to the queſtion of <hi>preſbyters</hi> having a right to <hi>confer holy orders;</hi> and, as a proof that it is ſo, be pleaſed to remark, that the apology is addreſſed <hi>jointly to the Preſbyters and Deacons;</hi> and cannot, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, prove the right of the <hi>former</hi> to confer <hi>holy orders,</hi> without admitting, alſo, the <hi>latter</hi> to the ſame degree of authority, an idea which the learned writer never intended to promote.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cyprian</hi> has been as much miſunderſtood by ſome former advocates for the <hi>Preſbyterian</hi> pretenſions to the <hi>right of ordaining;</hi> who <q>to prove that <hi>ordination by Biſhops, without the aſſiſtance of</hi> PRESBYTERS, <hi>was always forbidden and oppoſed,</hi> tell us</q> (ſays Dr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond) <q>of <hi>Aurelius</hi>'s being ordained by <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and his <hi>collegues,</hi> ep. 33. and then aſſure us, from ep. 58. that, by his <hi>collegues,</hi> he means his <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> (where yet there is no other proof of it, but the uſing of theſe <hi>words</hi> in the <hi>inſcription</hi> of the <hi>epiſtie,</hi> Cypri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus <hi>cum collegis,</hi> et <hi>ego et collegae,</hi> Cyprian <hi>with his collegues,</hi> and <hi>I and my collegues.)</hi> This</q> (ſays Dr. Hammond) <q>is a great, but diſcernible, <hi>fallacy,</hi> put upon the <hi>reader,</hi> as will ſoon appear, 1. if we but obſerve that the 33d epiſtle, where he tells of Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius, was written by <hi>Cyprian</hi> to his <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> and ſo THEY ARE the perſons whom he advertiſeth, what <hi>he and his collegues</hi> had done, and ſo, ſure, WERE NOT thoſe <hi>collegues</hi> that did it <hi>with</hi> him. Or, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, if, for the underſtanding <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s notion of <hi>collegues,</hi> ep. 58. we ſhall but look forward to the next epiſtle, 59, for that will fully diſcover it, being this, <hi>Cyprianus et caeteri collegae qui in concilio affuerunt numero</hi> LXVI. where <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s <hi>colleagues</hi> are evidently the 66 Biſhops that were in <hi>council</hi> with him.

The <hi>Popiſh</hi> times did not begin at the council of <hi>Arles,</hi> yet there we had our Biſhops: The fathers of the council of <hi>Nice</hi> had ſpent their days under the ſevereſt perſecutions of the heathen, and were juſt entered upon the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the chriſtian empire, and ſhall we think that popery was then prevalent? Our church is now ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled as it was at that time: Not only Biſhops all over <hi>Britain,</hi> ſo far as it was chriſtian, but very near the ſame number of Biſhops. The three chief biſhop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rics were ſettled at three moſt diſtant and proper places to have juriſdiction over the reſt, <hi>London, York,</hi> and <hi>Caerleon:</hi> There were in all 28 cities, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly 28 biſhoprics, as the number is given us both by <hi>Gildas</hi> and <hi>Bede;</hi> and, if we have now two leſs, yet ſo much of Britain as lies between <hi>Berwick</hi> and <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> now belonging to <hi>Scotland,</hi> may well be allowed for the making of two. At the council of <hi>Nice,</hi> the juriſdiction of their metropolitans was ſettled, and the union of all the Biſhops of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince provided for: Such was the order and harmony of the whole clergy, that, though the dioceſe was ſo large that it could not be particularly known and taught by the ſuperior officers of the church, yet every one acting in his place, and being accountable to thoſe above him, there was no defect either in the doctrine or diſcipline of thoſe primitive times.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>Certainly there is demonſtration for epiſcopacy, in that there <hi>were not only Biſhops before popery,</hi> but when the popiſh miſſionaries ſet up in the world, <hi>the old Biſhops were the very men that made the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt them.</hi> Nothing can be more undoubted in hiſtory, than that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Biſhops met <hi>Auſtin</hi> and his companions at the famous oak upon the banks of <hi>Severn,</hi> and there utterly broke with them, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptorily refuſing ſubjection to the pope of Rome, It is alſo as certain that <hi>Colman,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Lindis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>farn,</hi> and his northern clergy, who had their origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Chriſtianity from <hi>Britain,</hi> maintained the grand diſpute at <hi>Streanſhale</hi> againſt <hi>Agelbert, Wilfrid,</hi> and the reſt of the Romaniſts; that they retired and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſook their preferments rather than they would ſubmit to the impoſitions of <hi>Rome.</hi> The laying aſide their ancient obſervations, and receiving the papal tonſure, were looked upon by them both as innovations and badges of ſervitude to a foreign power, and therefore rejected by them, as they are by us at this day. We muſt maintain, like them, the cuſtoms of the church, which have been from the beginning; there <hi>always was a commemoration of Chriſt and his apoſtles at certain times,</hi> which we alſo obſerve without any he or ſhe ſaints of the <hi>Roman</hi> make: There always was a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to the authority of the church in matters of decency and order, which is all that we require, without the leaſt ſubjection to the church of <hi>Rome:</hi> We yield no deference, we utterly renounce her au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over us. And, to ſuppoſe that our reformers either wanted judgement to diſtinguiſh between the ancient cuſtoms of the church and the later inventions of popery, or that they wanted integrity to the true chriſtian religion, whoſe works and martyrdom bear witneſs in their favour, is ſuch a pretence as cannot ſupport itſelf under a ſincere conſideration.</q>

               <salute>Dear SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE ancient mode of dividing great cities was by <hi>wards;</hi> each of which was governed by an <hi>alderman,</hi> the <hi>ealdor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> of the Anglo-Saxons, an officer of great authority in the <hi>common law;</hi> being a JUSTICIARY, and having all the powers of our modern <hi>juſtices of the peace;</hi> and, what is more, was always elected by the
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:0996200400:362"/>
               <hi>houſe-keepers</hi> or <hi>deciners</hi> of the <hi>ward over</hi> which he preſides. This antient mode of diviſion by no means interferes with the leſſer diviſions of <hi>tithings</hi> and <hi>hundreds;</hi> ſo far from it, that the government of the <hi>wards</hi> is not complete without them. The Lord Mayor's precept, to the alder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, orders them (to this day) to hold courts of <hi>frankpledge</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">See Bohun's Privilegia Londini, p. 386. under the head of <hi>Wardmote Courts</hi> and the Lord Mayor's annual Precept to hold them; which latter, amongſt other things, contains the following article.—No. 11. <q>And, for that, of late, there is more reſort to the city of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons evil affected in religion, and otherwiſe, than in former times hath been; you ſhall diligently inquire if any man be received to dwell or abide within your Ward, that is not <hi>put under</hi> FRANKPLEDGE, <hi>as he ought to be by the cuſtom of the city:</hi>
                  </q> &amp;c.</note>; which were not without the regular diviſions of <hi>tithings</hi> to give them effect. The wards are <hi>local</hi> diviſions of various magnitude, and have been formed, (as you ſuggeſt,) ſome by <hi>ſtreets,</hi> ſome by the interſection of <hi>brooks,</hi> now covered over; but thoſe various di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſions
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:0996200400:363"/>of ſpace required a regular <hi>nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical</hi> diviſion of the <hi>houſekeepers,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to aſcertain the due proportion of the repreſentatives in the <hi>common-council</hi> of the city.</p>
            <p>The average-rate of <hi>common-council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> to the <hi>houſekeepers,</hi> or <hi>deciners,</hi> is, at preſent, about one to 90. And as the city was, in antient times, more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, and the houſes ſmaller for each fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, when men were reſtrained by law from building in the environs of the city, it is probable that the true proportion of <hi>houſekeepers,</hi> to elect <hi>one common-council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> ſhould be 100; ſo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon council has formerly been an aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of <hi>hundreders</hi> or <hi>high conſtables.</hi> As the gates of the city have been removed ſo as to leave this moſt important place entirely expoſed to the fatal conſequences of any ſudden riot, the attacks of any
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:0996200400:364"/>hardened banditti, and (eſpecially in caſes of any alarms by fire,) to the moſt dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous confluence of multitudes of unknown people, many of whom plunder the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed, and others hinder the neceſſary means of aſſiſtance, it is highly expedient that ſome means of defence ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed. I have been told, that, in the great cities of Japan, the ſtreets are barricadoed and ſhut up with <hi>paliſade</hi> gates every night, and that the people are actually divided into <hi>tithings</hi> and <hi>hundreds.</hi> I have much to ſay on this ſubject; and, if you are not going out of town immediately, I will do myſelf the honour to wait on you and communicate my thoughts.</p>
