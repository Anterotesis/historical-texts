            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Oh, thinks I, my dear, you're in a fine Humour to make us ſome Diverſion. So, ſays I, <hi>Frank,</hi> I hear the Match is quite concluded between Mrs. <hi>Hazard</hi> and you; and that ſhe has fix'd the firſt Night of her Comedy for your Wedding-Night.—Sir, ſays he, (with a very grave Face) you may ſay what you pleaſe of Mrs. <hi>Hazard;</hi> for as ſhe's going to expoſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhe muſt expect that every Fool will be as impertinent as ſhe is ridiculous:—but I would adviſe you not to mention my Name any more
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0578900500:11"/>
in that Manner, for, if you do, I ſhall take it extremely ill. Lord! ſays Miſs <hi>Giggle,</hi> Mr. <hi>Surly,</hi> how can you be ſo croſs? expoſe herſelf!—I'll ſwear, I believe Mrs. <hi>Hazard</hi> can write a very pretty Play, for ſhe has a great deal of Wit and Humour.—Wit and Humour! ſays he, why there are not ten Women in the Creation that have Senſe enough to write a conſiſtent <hi>N. B.</hi>—Marry her! I would ſooner marry a Woman that had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in ten Amours, than one, who, in Defiance to all Advice, and without the Pretence that moſt People write for, (for every body knows ſhe's a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of Fortune) will convince the whole World ſhe's an Ideot.</p>

Ha, ha, ha, well, let me die if that is not a very good Thing.—But 'tis well for me, <hi>Witling,</hi> the Town don't hear me; not that I mean quite what I ſay neither, for to do them Juſtice, they're generally in the right in their Cenſure; tho' ſometimes indeed they will out of Humanity for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give an Author Stupidity, and overlook his being a Fool; provided he will do them the Favour not to be a Beaſt; for which Reaſon, <hi>Witling,</hi> I have taken great Care to be delicate; I may be dull, but I am delicate; ſo that I am not at all afraid of the Town: I wiſh I could ſay the ſame of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formers: Lord, what pity 'tis the great Tragedy Actors can't ſing!

               <p>Why whoſe do they ſay it is, pray?—Not yours, <hi>Witling;</hi> not quite ſo bad as that I hope. No, my Motive for writing, was really Compaſſion; the Town has been ſo overwhelmed with Tragedies late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that they are in one entire Fit of the Vapours.—They think they love 'em, but it's no ſuch Thing. I was there one Night this Seaſon at a Tragedy, and there was ſuch an univerſal Yawn in the Houſe, that, if it had not been for a great Quantity of Drums and Trumpets, that moſt judiciouſly every now and then came in to their Relief, the whole Audience would have fallen aſleep.</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. HAZARD.</speaker>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Croſs,</hi> what did you ſay? I can't believe what I have heard! Mrs. <hi>Clive</hi> ſend me Word ſhe can't come to my <hi>Rehearſal,</hi> and is gone to Ladies about her Benefit! Sir, ſhe ſhall have no Benefit. Mr. <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi>

did you ever hear of a Parallel to this Inſolence? Give me my Copy, Sir; give me my Copy. I'll make Mrs. <hi>Clive</hi> repent treating me in this manner.

               <p>Why, Madam, if you wou'd be ſo good, as the Muſic are here, and the other Characters dreſs'd, it would be very obliging: And if you pleaſe to put on Mrs. <hi>Clive</hi>'s, her Dreſſer is here to attend, as ſhe expected her, and I believe it will fit you exactly, as you're much of her Size.</p>
