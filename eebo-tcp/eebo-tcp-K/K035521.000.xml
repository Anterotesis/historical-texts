            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Why I am aſtoniſh'd, that you make ſo light of what has happen'd to her; whether you conſider it as the loſs of a miſtreſs, or whether as a misfortune to a woman you muſt be ſuppos'd to have lov'd, and to whom you muſt have had obligations of the ſtrongeſt and moſt tender kind: one of theſe lights you muſt ſee it in.</p>

                  <p>Marrying her! Egad, ſhe knew a trick worth two o'that.

Yet an old woman upon theſe occaſions I cannot bear: and, in ſhort, I can no

longer bear a young one—It is my fate, they ſay, to be miſerable, if I don't get acquainted with the fineſt girl in <hi>England,</hi> without wiſhing for her; and I was told by a little goblin that ſtarted up before me, after it had led me, under the appearance of a Jack o' Lantern, into a wood, That if I could ſpend the king's hunting month here in this diſguiſe, all would be right: but how my being in petticoats ſhould make me leſs likely to love a fine girl, I cannot conceive! A fine girl, indeed, may be leſs likely to love me; but as to myſelf, it is high time for me to get into breeches, that I may get out of temptation. Here they flock about me—one ſits down juſt before me, and, without any ceremony, ties her garter—another gets me to adjuſt her tucker.—I'm the witneſs of ſo many pranks, and the confidant of ſo many ſecrets! Then I have my hours of mortification too: I am tormented by a ſwarm of profligate fops, who try to debauch every woman they ſee, with as little concern as they take ſnuff: wretches, who are as deſtitute of love, as they are of virtue; and have as little enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as they have underſtanding!

I have been defam'd by ſome ſcandalous falſehood, and I muſt do my honour juſtice—I can, at a ſmall ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of diſſimulation, get that wretch, <hi>Florimond,</hi> to repeat to me all that he has told to <hi>Gondibert:</hi> I will do it—and I will as yet lie in ambuſh under this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, to make ſure of my blow.</p>

If I had told her the ſtory, I muſt have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered myſelf to convince her it could not be true: but who knows what a jealous woman might have thought upon finding the very perſon, who is ſaid to have gone off with her lover, in ſo ſtrange a diſguiſe! —Yet ſhe will certainly contrive to hear it from <hi>Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond</hi>; and then, good heaven! what will ſhe ſuffer,

if I do not convince her that it is falſe!—I muſt, I will truſt her—I have no other chance to ſave her, but by making a diſcovery, which, if I had really gone off with <hi>Edgar,</hi> it is certain I ſhould not have made, eſpecially to her. But I muſt not intrude upon her now: I will plant myſelf where I may intercept her before ſhe can ſee <hi>Florimond,</hi> and truſt to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous friendſhip for the event. <stage>Exit.</stage>

But now ſhe's in the pannicks, leſt I ſhould reſent it. Now ſhe has ſomething to ſay—and—if I am diſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gag'd,—ſhe will be glad to meet me upon the terrace. If I ſhould humble her now, and not meet her—but that would be cruel. I will, however, take ſome ſtate upon me—I will look a little formal; it may ſave me ſome trouble in my future advances.—Here ſhe comes.</p>

                  <p>Sir, I am very ſorry that I ſhou'd have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truded upon your privacy; but, perhaps, I have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented ſomething that would have had worſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.</p>

                  <p>You will excuſe a woman, though a ſtranger, ſir, upon ſuch an occaſion: may I intreat to know, ſir, who has had the misfortune to incur the reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a gentleman, who ſeems ſo little to deſerve ill treatment, and ſo able to puniſh it?</p>

                  <p>Madam, you do me honour—She is making advances already <stage>aſide.</stage>—Why, madam, as the treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have received makes it an act of juſtice to tell, what I ſhould otherwiſe rather die than diſcover, I will comply with your requeſt—Hem! A little dirty dependant upon the court here, madam, one <hi>Gondi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> thought fit to ſend me a challenge, upon account of ſomething I happened to ſay concerning a lady, in whole good graces I happen'd to be, and whom a fooliſh young fellow that I was a friend to has thought fit to run away with; and, madam, though I have ſo far treated him like a gentleman, as to accept his challenge, he has not come to the place appointed, and it is now half an hour paſt the time.</p>

            <head>EPILOGUE. Written by Mr. GARRICK. Spoken by Mrs. YATES.</head>
            <lg>
               <l>OLD times, old faſhions, and the Fairies gone;</l>
               <l>Let us return, good folks, to ſixty-one—</l>
               <l>To this bleſt time, ye Fair, of female glory,</l>
               <l>When pleaſures unforbidden lie before ye!</l>
               <l>No <hi>Sprites</hi> to fright you now, no guardian <hi>Elves;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Your wiſe directors are—your own dear ſelves—</l>
               <l>And every Fair One feels, from old to young,</l>
               <l>While theſe your guides—you never can do wrong.</l>
               <l>Weak were the ſex of yore—their pleaſures few—</l>
               <l>How much more wife, more ſpirited are <hi>You?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Would any Lady <hi>Jane,</hi> or Lady <hi>Mary,</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Ere they did <hi>this</hi> or <hi>that,</hi> conſult a <hi>Fairy?</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Would they permit this ſaucy pigmy crew,</l>
               <l>For each ſmall ſlip, to pinch 'em black and blue?</l>
               <l>Well may you ſhudder—for, with all your charms,</l>
               <l>Were this the caſe—good heaven, what necks and arms!</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Thus did they ſerve our grandames heretofore—</l>
               <l>The very thought muſt make us moderns ſore!</l>
               <l>Did their pour hearts for cards or dancing beat,</l>
               <l>Theſe <hi>Elves</hi> rais'd bliſters on their hands and feet:</l>
               <l>Tho' <hi>Loo</hi> the game, and fiddles play'd moſt ſweetly—</l>
               <l>They could not ſqueeze dear <hi>Pam,</hi> nor foot <hi>Moll Peatly.</hi>
               </l>
               <l>
                  <pb facs="tcp:0670100500:44"/>Were wives with huſbands but a little wilful,</l>
               <l>Were they at that ſame <hi>Loo</hi> a little <hi>ſkilful;</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Did they with pretty fellows laugh or ſport—</l>
               <l>Wear ruffs too ſmall, or petticoats too ſhort:</l>
               <l>Did they, no matter how, diſturb their cloaths;</l>
               <l>Or, ever-lilied, add a little roſe!—</l>
               <l>Theſe ſpiteful Fairies rattled round their beds,</l>
               <l>And put ſtrange frightful nonſenſe in their heads!</l>
               <l>Nay, while the huſband ſnor'd and prudiſh aunt,</l>
               <l>Had the fond wife but met the dear gallant—</l>
               <l>Tho' lock'd the door, and all as ſtill as night—</l>
               <l>Pop thro' the key-hole whips the Fairy Sprite,</l>
               <l>Trips round the room—"My huſband!" madam cries—</l>
               <l>"The devil! where!" the frighted beau replies—</l>
               <l>Jumps thro' the window—ſhe calls out in vain—</l>
               <l>He, cur'd of love—and cool'd with drenching rain,</l>
               <l>Swears—"Dem him if he'll e'er intrigue again!"</l>
               <l>Theſe were their tricks of old—But all allow,</l>
               <l>No childiſh fears diſturb our Fair Ones now.—</l>
            </lg>
            <lg>
               <l>Ladies, for all this trifling, 'twould be beſt</l>
               <l>To keep a little <hi>Fairy</hi> in your breaſt:</l>
               <l>Not one that ſhould with moderate paſſions war;</l>
               <l>But juſt to tweak you—when you go too far.</l>
