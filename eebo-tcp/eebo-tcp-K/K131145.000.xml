            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

For which Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay any thing on that Matter wou'd be only <hi>Crambe repe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tita,</hi> and by conſequence rather Tireſome than acceptable to 'em: My preſent Deſign therefore is to <hi>Continue</hi> here, and not to <hi>Repeat</hi> that Subject, by preſenting my Readers with a ſmall Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which ſhall <hi>Commence,</hi> and take its <hi>Beginning,</hi> where Treatiſes on the Secret Diſeaſe, and Veneral Cures uſually <hi>End.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that this Book is not deſigned for Perſons who have any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or Stage of the Secret Diſeaſe <hi>Actually</hi> upon them, till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they are eſteem'd Cured, and <hi>have taken Leave</hi> of their Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician: And <hi>THEN</hi> 'tis, that I addreſs this preſent Work to them: In which to proceed in Order and Method I muſt take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to my Reader, that</p>

Since there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Animal Body is now known to be a pure Machine, and many of its Motions and Actions are demonſtrated to be the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Conſequences of its Structure, it as neceſſarily follows that the Symptoms of Diſeaſes in general, and of <hi>GLEETS</hi> in particular are likewiſe the neceſſary Conſequences of the Alteration of the Structures of certain particular Parts of this Oeconomy. Inſomuch that a <hi>Gleet</hi> (as hereafter will clearly be ſhewed) as neceſſarily follows from a Change of this Oeconomy and Structure of the Part which is its proper Seat, as perfect Health without any Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1046500300:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>of a <hi>Gleet</hi> at all, is the conſequence of the perfect Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy of the Part before any ſuch <hi>Change</hi> happened.</p>
            <p>If a <hi>Pendulum</hi> of ſuch a Length makes a <hi>Clock</hi> to go ex<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>actly true; does not the Alteration of this <hi>Pendulum</hi> as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rily cauſe it to go too faſt or too ſlow? and when all the <hi>Move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> is known to be in good Order, does not the quick or ſlow <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Clock,</hi> as neceſſarily ſhew the Fault of the <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulum?</hi> It is the ſame thing in that <hi>Part of the Animal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> which is the <hi>Seat of a Gleet:</hi> For the ſame <hi>Reaſonings</hi> hold good, <hi>caeteris paribus</hi> in all Sorts of <hi>Machines,</hi> whoſe <hi>Motions</hi> are the neceſſary <hi>Conſequences</hi> of their <hi>Structures.</hi> Now ſuppoſe a Perſon to be entirely ignorant of the <hi>Structure</hi> of a <hi>Clock</hi> or <hi>Watch;</hi> it is impoſſible he ſhould ever be able to put it in right Order, tho' he had never ſo exact a <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of its irregular <hi>Motions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tis on this Account that the <hi>Ancients</hi> not acquainted with our <hi>Modern Anatomical Diſcoveries;</hi> were wholy ignorant of the true <hi>SEAT</hi> of the <hi>Infirmity</hi> we here treat of; the <hi>Know-</hi> of which is the only thing capable of informing our <hi>Judgment</hi> as to the <hi>Cauſe</hi> and <hi>Cure</hi> of it. This ſo puzled them in expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it's <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Origin;</hi> that ſome placed it in one thing, and ſome in another, but None of them in the right; for which reaſon it was, that the generality of them miſſing of its Cure, it began to be reputed an <hi>Infirmity</hi> and <hi>Weakneſs</hi> truly not much leſs the <hi>Opprobrium Medicorum,</hi> then the <hi>Gout,</hi> and on this Account it is, that a <hi>Gleet</hi> (eſpecially if of any date) having elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Skill of very able <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> has been by the greateſt part of them pronounced incurable; which Reproach is not at all to be wondered at, ſince the <hi>Seat</hi> and <hi>Nature</hi> of it was ſo little under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, and therefore might ſtill have remained ſo, had it not been for thoſe moſt excellent Diſcoveries of late made by that great and ingenious Anatomiſt Mr. <hi>Cowper,</hi> whoſe nice Obſervations of the inward Frame and Structure of That particular Part where a <hi>Gleet</hi> is ſituated, has given more Light and Information in this our preſent Queſtion, than all the Writings of the Ancients put together (the beſt of which upon this Subject were only the Effect of a happy Gueſs, and nothing at all of Certainty or Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) ever did before. If therefore the Anatomical World, in theſe latter Years, had not been indefatigable in the Purſuit of farther Diſcoveries, we might have ſet down to this Day by the glimmering Lights of the old Anatomiſts, and ſatisfy our ſelves with their Chance Gueſſes as well in this as many other Matters. So that to this Ignorance of the true Seat of the Diſorder, has
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1046500300:4"/>ſeen all along owing the frequent want of Succeſs in its Cure. For how can any Perſon be ſuppoſed to form a true Method of Cure for any Ailment or Infirmity, the Seat (and by Conſequence the Nature and Cauſe) of which he is not firſt rightly appriſed of?</p>
            <p>As to the Motive of publiſhing this preſent Treatiſe, (which I ſhall endeavour to perform with as much Circumſpection and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, as the Nicety of the Subject will poſſibly admit of; and therefore, throughout the whole, I ſhall take care not to ſully the Chaſteſt Imagination, or give any the leaſt Offence to the moſt Modeſt of Mankind.) 'tis Twofold:</p>
            <p n="1">1ſt. The great Uneaſineſs (notwithſtanding a daily Change of Linnen) which a great many Gentlemen and others oftentimes for many Years labour under, by reaſon of this Infirmity continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally upon them, which tho' for the preſent may give no other Trouble, than as it is oppoſite to Cleanlineſs, being no pleaſant Companion at all to a Clean Neat Perſon, yet will in time impair and break the very beſt of Conſtitutions, and bring on a Conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as hereafter will clearly be ſhewed.</p>
            <p n="2">2ly The great Inconvenience Perſons afflicted with <hi>Gleets,</hi> and other ſuch Weakneſſes, frequently labour under, from the great Quantities of Phyſick exhibited to them for their Cure, which even it ſelf is a Diſeaſe, and oftentimes ſerves for little elſe than breaking a ſound Conſtitution, or making a bad one worſe.</p>
            <p>In Order therefore to explicate more clearly the true Cauſe and Nature of <hi>Gleets</hi> and other ſuch Weakneſſes; and thereby be led into the trueſt and moſt rational Method of their Cure, it will firſt of all be abſolutely neceſſary to examine a little the Anatomy of That particular Part, where this Weakneſs is ſituated. As 1ſt, Its inward Structure and Make. 2ly. What Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations this its Structure is ſubject to, and capable of. 3ly. What Effects ſuch Alterations are likely to produce. And laſtly, Whether or no theſe Effects are ſuch as Gentlemen and others find in themſelves, who have the Unhappineſs of a <hi>Gleet,</hi> and other ſuch Weakneſſes upon them.</p>

            <head>CHAP. I. <hi>Some few Anatomical Obſervations neceſſary to be taken Notice of, in order to a right Knowledge of the true Cauſe, Seat, and Nature of</hi> Gleets, <hi>and other ſuch Weakneſſes.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>BY a GLEET is underſtood an <hi>Involuntary</hi> and almoſt conſtant Efflux or <hi>Dripping</hi> away of Matter from a Human Body, and that in much the ſame Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whether the Perſon be aſleep or awake. From which Definition it naturally offers it ſelf to our Conſideration, to enquire into the Cauſe of this Efflux of Matter, and how
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1046500300:5"/>it happens that ſuch a Quantity of Matter ſhould thus Involuntarily come away. Which Difficulty will eaſily be remov'd by examining the inward Anatomical Structure of the Part where this Weakneſs is ſituated, which is the only thing that can give Light to our preſent Queſtion: And then to examin if there is naturally any Liquor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated in that Part, capable of becoming the Matter of that Epidemical Weakneſs and common Companion of Mankind, uſually called a GLEET.</p>
            <p>It is obſervable by Anatomy, that in the Nervo-Spon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Subſtance of the Urethra or Urinary Paſſage, there are ſeveral Glandulous Openings, firſt diſcovered by that great Anatomiſt Mr. <hi>Cowper,</hi> which ſerve as ſo many ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretory Ducts or Channels deſigned by Naure conſtantly to convey and furniſh a certain viſcid, clammy, Mucous kind of Liquor or Moiſture into the Urinary Paſſage; The Uſe of which Liquor is to lubricate and beſmear, by its Viſcidity, the Pipe or Paſſage, and thereby to preſerve and defend it from being fretted and corroded by the ſharp Salts of the Urine which is daily paſſing thro' it, and which, without this defenſative Liquor, would certainly be Fretted, and become Raw, and by conſequence Sore, as <hi>any</hi> Fleſhy Part wou'd be, that ſhould have ſuch a ſalt ſharp acrimonious fretting Liquor as Urine ſo often paſſing on it, unleſs it were preſerved by ſome ſuch proper Defenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, as the continual anointing or beſmearing it with ſome ſuch ſmooth, ſoft, balſamick, unctious Subſtance would be: Inſomuch that were it not for this unctious Liquor or Moiſture that Nature is continually ſupplying the Urinary Paſſage with, by means of thoſe Glandu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Openings abovementioned, to keep it thus moiſt, it would in a little time become ſo fretted and Raw, by the Sharpneſs of the Urine daily paſſing thro' it, that <hi>All Mankind wou'd have a perpetual Scalding and Heat of Urine;</hi> by which I do not mean, that the Urine in it ſelf would be Hotter, in that Suppoſition, than it is now, but that the Paſſage being raw and ſore for want of that defenſative ſlimy Moiſture, which now protects it, it wou'd be fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Saltneſs of the Urine, and ſo wou'd ſmart, and ſeem as it were to Burn and Scald, whenever the Urine paſſed thro' it: Juſt as any other Raw Sore Place dive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of its Scarf-Skin, wou'd ſmart and ſeem as it were to burn if one ſhou'd throw Urine, or Salt Water upon it.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:1046500300:6"/>
            <p>This being thus eſtabliſh'd from the nice Anatomical Inſpection of the Urethra, we are now to conſider what Changes and Alterations theſe Glandulous Openings in the Paſſage, are ſubject to, and capable of: And then whether or no ſuch Changes can furniſh us with ſuch a large Supply of Matter as daily is experienced <hi>Involuntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> to Drip away from Perſons who have that Weakneſs commonly called a <hi>Gleet</hi> upon them. So that a thorough Enquiry into this Matter will lead us directly into an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Knowledge of the true Seat, Cauſe, and Nature of <hi>Gleets,</hi> without being put upon any Neceſſity of having Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to any other Part, that in reality has no manner of Claim to fall under our preſent Conſideration: As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> or Seminal Veſſels, which tho' vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garly eſteem'd to furniſh the Matter of a <hi>Gleet,</hi> yet have no Share at all in it; and for this Reaſon it is, that the Vulgar commonly, tho' very ignorantly and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly call a <hi>Gleet</hi> a <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> which are widely different, as hereafter will appear; the true and only Seat of a Gleet, being the Urethra, or Urinary Paſſage, as by and by will clearly be made appear.</p>
            <p>Our next Endeavour therefore muſt be to examine how the <hi>Urethra</hi> only and the Glandulous Openings abovemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned which it contains, are able to furniſh ſo great a quantity of Matter, as is obſerved to be <hi>involuntarily</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged in the courſe of a <hi>Gleet.</hi> In order to which we muſt conſider, That Nature deſigning theſe Glands in the Urethra conſtantly to furniſh and ſupply a certain Moiſture to the whole Pipe or Paſſage, which may defend it from being fretted by the ſharp Urine ſo frequently paſſing through it, as has been already ſhewed, the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifices or Mouths of theſe Glands in entire healthy, ſound, hail Perſons are in ſome meaſure, (if I may uſe the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon <hi>ſervata</hi> always <hi>debitâ proportione</hi>) like the Sphin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter Muſcles of the <hi>Anus,</hi> Bladder, &amp;c. I mean by this, that the openings of theſe Glands, notwithſtanding their being ſo very ſmall, have a certain Springineſs and Ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticity proportionable to their Bigneſs and Size, belong ing to them, by which they are endowed with a certain power of ſtraitning, contracting and drawing themſelves, togather more or leſs upon every Emiſſion of that Moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture Nature deſigns them to ſupply the Urethra with: juſt as the Sphincter Muſcle of the Bladder is endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1046500300:7"/>with a Power of retaining, holding, and keeping in the Urine. And by this means it is, that juſt ſo much and no more of this Moiſture is thrown out of theſe Glands into the Urethra, than is juſt neceſſary for the Lubrication and Moiſtening of it, preparatively for the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Urine. Nor is this at at all to be queſtioned, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Orifices and Mouths of theſe ſmall mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute Glands in the paſſage, have every one of them a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per power of opening and contracting themſelves, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to their bigneſs and ſize, not unlike, as I juſt now ſaid, to the Sphincter Muſcles in other Parts of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, ſince we ſee that even a ſmall Mite, taken for Example out of corrupted Cheeſe, and which is ſcarce diſcernable by the naked Eye, yet by the help of a good Microſcope, it appears to be an Animal as compleatly furniſhed with all neceſſary Parts, as other Animals whoſe ſize makes them the conſpicuous Objects of our unaſſiſted Sight So that as by reaſon of the ſtrength and vigour of the Sphincter Muſcles, for Example of the Bladder; the Neck and Mouth of it is endowed with a power of ſtraitening, contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cloſing it ſelf together after every Emiſſion of Urine, every one experiences in themſelves a power of either holding or letting go their Water: So, much in the ſame manner, by reaſon of the ſtrength and vigour of the Orifices of theſe Glandules, they are endowed with not an unlike power of ſtraitening, contracting, and drawing themſelves together (which I deſire my Reader always to ſuppoſe to be in a degree proportionable ſtill to their Bigneſs) after every Emiſſion of the mucous ſlimy Liquor they contain: Which ſtrength being once loſt, the power alſo of retaining and keeping in this Liquor is alſo loſt with it. The State then and Condition of theſe Glandulous openings (or as Dr. <hi>Drake</hi> calls them <hi>Mucous Glands</hi>) from their thus furniſhing and ſupplying the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage with this Mucous Liqor,) being thus conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd in healthy Perſons. Our next Enquiry muſt be into the ſtate of theſe Mucous Glands in Perſons afflicted with a <hi>Gleet.</hi> Which ſtate we ſhall ſoon be appriſed of by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering that when a Perſon has been under Cure for the Secret Diſeaſe, the fatigue of Antivenereal Medicines, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially if ill adminiſtred, by a frequent preſſure upon, and irritation of theſe Glands, has rendred them flaccid, limber, weak, and looſe, which before were healthy, vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1046500300:8"/>ſpringy and ſtrong. The truth of theſe Aſſertions (abſtracting from the reaſonableneſs they carry along with them) will appear by giving my Reader an Account of the ſtate of theſe Glands as they have been obſerved in ſome Anatomical Diſſections made of that particular part where all <hi>Gleets</hi> are ſeated, I mean the Urethra or U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinary Paſſage.</p>
            <p>That great Anatomiſt Mr. <hi>Cowper</hi> tells us, that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form himſelf the better in this Point, he Diſſected the Urinary Paſſage of ſeveral Criminals who had been Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted: Some of which were healthy found Perſons: The others were Executed with <hi>Gleets</hi> upon them. In the healthy ſound Perſons, he found theſe Glandulous open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to be ſo firm, as to have had a perfect Elaſticity, or Springineſs: Inſomuch that upon preſſing them, he ſays, they diſcharged a certain quantity of a tranſparent viſcous Liquor, ſuch as it ſhews it ſelf, and ought to be <hi>in ſtatu ſano;</hi> whereas if theſe Glands had not had ſuch a firmneſs and ſtrength, in which conſiſted their power of retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or letting go the viſcid clammy Liquor they contain; this Liquor would have ſlipped out of them without any Preſſure at all: And by conſequence, its not owzing out, but upon ſuch a preſſure, was an evident mark of their ſpringyneſs and ſtrength. He alſo obſerved the whole U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rethra to be beſmeared and lined with a Liquor of a viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous clammy contexture, which he ſuppoſed to have been diſcharged from theſe <hi>Glandulae Mucoſae,</hi> in order to lubricate the Paſſage.</p>
            <p>But in the Urethra of Criminals Executed with a <hi>Gleet</hi> actually upon them, and which they had had many Years, the Caſe was quite different. He obſerved the Mucous Glands to be limber, flaccid, and looſe, very much ſtretched and dilated: And their Orifices by the help of a nice Microſcope to be viſibly open, and thereby totally deſtitute of their Strength and Vigour, from whence he judiciouſly concluded, that they were alſo entirely deprived of their retentive Faculty and Springyneſs, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving no power left of contracting themſelves upon any emiſſion of that mucous clammy Liquor they contain, as thoſe other Glands could do in the Criminals that were Executed in perfect Health. After this he examined in the Executed Criminals that were thus diſſected, the ſtate of the <hi>Proſtatae,</hi> the <hi>Veſiculae Seminales</hi> and the <hi>Paraſtatae,</hi> all
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1046500300:9"/>which he found to be as perfectly ſound and entire, as in any healthy Perſon he ever diſſected in his life; which is a convincing Proof, that neither the <hi>Proſtatae, Veſiculae Seminales</hi> nor the <hi>Paraſtatae</hi> have any the leaſt ſhare at all in the Seat or Cauſe of a <hi>Gleet.</hi> This will appear ſtill more clear, by an Example from Perſons who have a <hi>Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betes</hi> upon them: For from the loſs of the Springineſs and Tone of the Sphincter Muſcle of the Bladder; the Neck and Mouth of it is ſo weakened and relaxed, as to be deprived of its retentive Faculty, through a want of that power of contracting and drawing it ſelf together after any Emiſſion of Urine which healthy Perſons ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in themſelves: from whence it follows, that the Urine comes away involuntarily from them, being alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether deprived of both that Expulſive, as well as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive power which healthy Perſons have.</p>
            <p>Theſe Obſervations being thus premiſed, and which are fully ſufficient to convince any one whoſe Eyes are not ſhut againſt demonſtration, that what the Ancients gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought as to the Cure of Gleets was built upon a very wrong Foundation: <hi>viz.</hi> An erroneous Notion of its Cauſe and Seat. We muſt now enquire how it happens that this change of ſtate of theſe Mucous Glands, <hi>viz.</hi> from an Elaſtick, Springy, and ſtrong ſtate, to a limber, looſe, and flaccid one can produce and be the Cauſe of that quantity of Matter which continually drips and comes away in the courſe a <hi>Gleet:</hi> Or in other Terms, (but the meaning is ſtill the ſame) whether or no the productive cauſe of a <hi>Gleet</hi> i. e. the Relaxation of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the mucous Glands in the Urethra can ſo far en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the quantity of Liquor naturally produced by theſe Glands, as to be ſuch as is daily experienced by Gentlemen and others who have this Infirmity upon them.</p>

            <p>THE Springineſs and retentive Faculty of the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Glands in the Urethra of healthy ſound Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are ſuppoſed never to have had the Secret Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe upon them conſiſting in their Strength and Power of either diſating or contracting their Orifices or <hi>Oſtiola,</hi> (as in the foregoing Chapter has been ſhewed) by which Power of retaining or letting out the viſcous Liquor
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1046500300:10"/>they contain, they diſcharge juſt ſo much and no more of it, than is juſt neceſſary for the lubrication and beſmear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Paſſage: it muſt of Neceſſity follow, that when theſe Glands are, by the long Uſe of Medicines, or other means, as a long Continuance of the Diſeaſe <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo weakened as to become limber, flaccid, flabby, and looſe, they muſt alſo be deprived of this retentive Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or Faculty. Inſomuch that altho' theſe Glands in heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy ſound Perſons, who never had the Misfortune of the <hi>Secret Diſeaſe,</hi> are naturally ſo Springy and Strong as to diſcharge and let out into the Urethra, juſt ſo much and no more of the ſlimy Liquor deſigned by Nature to beſmear, and as it were cover over the whole Tube or Paſſage, and there by defend it from the Sharpneſs of the Urine: Yet in moſt Perſons who have been ever cured of the Secret Diſeaſe, the Caſe is generally ſpeaking not ſo. For the Orifices or <hi>Oſtiola</hi> of theſe Glands in theſe <hi>Cured</hi> Perſons, are ſo weakened and relaxed by the Fatigue of the Diſeaſe, and its Cure, as to be in a manner always o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, by which means the Mucous Liquor they contain, is continually ſlipping out of them into the Urethra; the Openings of theſe Glands not having Springineſs, Elaſtici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, nor Strength left to contract themſelves, and thereby to keep it in as formerly; by which means the contained Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor involuntarily and continually comes out into the Urethra, and by ſucceſſive Quantities of it puſhing one after another drips and owzes away <hi>Involuntarily</hi> from the Body.</p>
            <p>The Difficulty then that now remains is to conceive how ſuch very ſmall Glands and their Orifices can fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſuch a Quantity of Matter, as is daily experienced to flow away in ſome <hi>Gleets,</hi> and how the Mucous Liquor which is naturally diſcharged out of theſe Glands into the Urethra in healthy Perſons, ſhould be increaſed to ſuch a degree as 'tis in Perſons who have a <hi>Gleet.</hi> This Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty will eaſily be removed to any Perſon who will but allow that the Mucous Glands in the Urethra, altho' ſo very ſmall in themſelves as to be inviſible to the Naked Eye, unleſs aſſiſted by the Help of a Microſcope, yet they may naturally ſecerne ſuch a Quantity of Fluid in any determinate Time, as is fully ſufficient to become the Matter of (that common Accident now adays) a <hi>Gleet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To illuſtrate this Matter, I hope it will be allowed that theſe Mucous Glands, as little as they are, may naturally
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1046500300:11"/>diſcharge into the Urethra for its Lubrication, as much of this Liquor in one Minute as may weigh at leaſt one Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a Grain: This in an Hour will be 15 Grains, or a Quarter of a Dram: In 24 Hours, or a natural Day, it will amount to 6 Drams, which is 3 Quarters of an Ounce; a Quantity ſufficient in all reaſon to give that Uneaſineſs to the Perſon, as well as Wetneſs to the Linnen, which is uſually experienced by thoſe under the uncomfortable Circumſtances of a <hi>Gleet:</hi> And which is more than either the <hi>Veſiculae Seminales</hi> or the <hi>Proſtatae</hi> can continue to furniſh in any conſiderable Space of Time, without infinite more Detriment to the Body, than Perſons afflicted with <hi>Gleets</hi> uſually experience. Hence it is evident that the Glands the Urethra are full as capable of being the Springs that ſupply the Liquor that Drips away in a <hi>Gleet,</hi> as the <hi>Proſta<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tae,</hi> or any other pretended Part ſituated at a Diſtance.</p>
            <p>If you ask, how theſe Glands in the Urethra can diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge ſo great a Quantity of Fluid in the time of a <hi>Gleet,</hi> above what they do in their natural State. I anſwer, that it is manifeſt from the Animal OEconomy, that if any Gland or excretory Duct be Weakened, and depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of its retentive Faculty, the Quantity of Liquor that it diſcharges, by Reaſon of that Weakneſs, is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly augmented in Proportion to the greater or leſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grce of Weakneſs with which theſe Glands or Ducts are affected: Juſt as a little Powder of <hi>Cantharides</hi> applied any where, by breaking thro' the Texture of the Cuticular Scarf-Skin, does ſo weaken the Glands as ſoon to excite a Bliſter, and by it thus weakning the Glands, makes them diſcharge a Quantity of Matter immenſly greater than what wou'd naturally flow away from that Part by inſenſible Perſpiration only. Much in the ſame Manner the Orifices of theſe Glands being weakened and relaxed, have thereby loſt their retentive Faculty, and therefore cannot hold in the Liquor they contain, but lets more of it ſlip away than the mere Lubrication of the Urethra re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, and therefore it continually is diſcharging it ſelf by that Dripping, which is commonly called a <hi>Gleet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hence all the Difficulties about a <hi>Gleet</hi> are overcome in a few Words; Its Symptoms become obvious upon a ſmall Principle ſo clear in Anatomy, as to carry not only Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence along with it, but alſo more clearly explicates all the Symptoms and Effects of it, than hitherto is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1046500300:12"/>to have been done.</p>
            <p>But beſides a <hi>Gleet</hi> from the abovementioned Cauſes it frequently happens, that ſome Perſons after even a ſafe and ſure Cure of the Secret Diſeaſe, eſpecially where the Infection has been confiderable, have for a long Time after been vexed with the Appearance of a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle owzing of a ſlimy tranſparent Subſtance not ſo much as the Quantity of a Drop at a Time; which upon their Linnen looks ſometimes of no ill Colour, tho' alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it will give it a yellowiſh Tinge no bigger per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps than a great Pin's Head, which frequently alarms 'em, they thinking ſome Infection lies ſtill lurking, when the Cauſe in reality has been over-weakneſs, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heating of the Parts <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and which, upon endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to carry off by Purging, has rather increaſed, by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxing the Veſſels, and weakning their Springineſs and and Tone: Perſons with ſuch <hi>Gleets</hi> as theſe, have ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally little Threads, and Skins, or ſuch like, ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming in Variety of Figures about their Urine, and the Orifice of the Urinary Paſſage is frequently gumm'd up therewith. Theſe <hi>Gleets</hi> uſuall attend hot ſanguine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and in Time brings on pains and Weakneſs in the Loins, and has at laſt terminated in incureable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions, whereas if ſome ſtrengthning Medicines pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly adapted to thoſe Parts, had but at firſt been ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly applied, not only the Diſorder it ſelf might have been timely cured, but alſo theſe ill Conſequences happily prevented. By which Medicines I underſtand ſuch as are appropriated to reſtore the injured Parts to a State of Soundneſs, as well as to preſerve them ſo. Thus if the Tone of the Parts be but reeſtabliſhed by Proper Reſtorative Medicines, their acquired Strength will enable them to reſiſt the Ingreſs of new Supplies of peccant Matter, and turn them off to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged another way. Thus the Cure is attained with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Violence, Pain, or Inconvenience to the Patient: and in this Senſe it is (generally ſpeaking) to be underſtood, that ſometimes a <hi>Gleet</hi> will remain after the beſt of Cures.</p>

Ideo percuſſit eum Dominus quod rem</hi> DETESTABILEM <hi>faceret,</hi> ſays the Vulgate Edition. And yet notwithſtanding ſo very ſevere an Expreſſion of the Scripture, this Unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Misfortune is ſo frequent, and crying an Offence, eſpecially amongſt the more Flouriſhing Part of Man kind, that there is a great deal of Reaſon to imagin that many Delinquents would never have been ſuch, if they had but been throughly appriſed of the Heinouſneſs of the Crime, and the very ſad Conſequences to the Body, as well as the Soul, which follow from it; And which indeed is the Motive that has induced me to the writing of this Chapter.</p>
            <p>But as it is very difficult to write on a Subject of ſo nice a Nature as this is, within the reach of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Capacities, without making ſome Encroachment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Rules and Bounds of Decency, and the Riſque of giving ſome Offence, notwithſtanding it may proceed from a Deſign to promote Virtue, and diſcourage Vice: I ſhall therefore rather chooſe to expreſs my ſelf ſo as to be leſs intelligible to ſome, by leaving ſeveral Things to my Readers private Conſideration, than by an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freedom of Expreſſion, to run the hazard of putting that into any chaſt Mind, which every Perſon ought with the utmoſt Chriſtian Courage and Care to ſtifle and deſtroy.

            <p>I doubt not but thoſe Perſons whoſe guilty Conſcience ſhall tell them that they are concerned in this preſent Chapter, will underſtand the Meaning of it, without much Explication: And 'tis to them I recommend it, with my hearty Deſire of their moſt ſerious Conſideration of what is contained in it: And as for thoſe whom it no way concerns, and by conſequence who underſtand it not (O happy Ignorance!)

            <p>To proceed therefore in our Subject: By this Doctrine is excluded every even the leaſt Impure and Immodeſt Action as unlawful, and to be baniſhed the Converſation of Chriſtians, whoſe Characteriſtick Mark ought to be Modeſty, as being thereby the very <hi>T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

The Apoſtles Argument is this: That if Material Temples, dedicated only to the external Worſhip of Almighty God, are in no wiſe to be proſaned; much leſs Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ones, ſuch as our Bodies are, in which the Spirit of Almighty God inhabits. This Reflection of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> gives us clearly to underſtand, that whenever we give our ſelves over to Uncleanneſs, our Bodies are no more the Temples of the Holy Ghoſt: For which Reaſon he tells us expreſsly, that not being our own, by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence we are not at our own Diſpoſal, being <hi>Bought with a great Price,</hi> and ought therefore to be ſo far from Abuſing and defiling our ſelves, that we ought to glorify God in even our BODIES, which are God's, as well as our Spirits, all which is utterly deſtroyed by thoſe Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes this Chapter here treats of.</p>
            <p>My Reader may therefore take this for a general Rule,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1046500300:15"/>that a Chriſtian is bound to ſhun whatever Senſualizes the Soul, and tends only to gratify unlawful (i. e. out of a Conjugal State) Paſſions, it being always unlawful out of that State, to draw any immodeſt Pleaſure from our own Bodies, on any Pretence whatſoever.</p>
            <p>To condemn therefore, and diſſwade againſt a Sin, ſo very diſpleaſing to Almighty God: So detrimental to the Common-Wealth: And ſo highly injurious to our ſelves, requires no Arguments which are not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely agreeable to Truth, and can ſtand the Teſt of the ſtricteſt Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Its being a very great Offence againſt Almighty God, ſufficiently appears, in that there is not a Place in Holy Writ, where Sins of Uncleanneſs are condemned, but that Unhappy One this Chapter treats of, is amongſt others hinted at, with a Concluſion, that <hi>Nothing Impure, nor who acts any ſuch Abominable Things, ſhall ever inherit the Kingdom of God:</hi> but are to <hi>have a Part in the Lake that burns with Fire and Brimſtone:</hi> And altho 'tis a Saying no leſs true than Terrible, of an Ancient Author, that Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are always <hi>Sure</hi> of their Sin, and <hi>Uncertain</hi> of their Pardon; yet from what has hitherto been ſaid, all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons herein concerned ought ſeriouſly to betake themſelves to true Repentance, and that betimes too, leſt by Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in the End they misfortunately find themſelves in the Circumſtances of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> of whom it is related, that <hi>Orabat Scel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1046500300:16"/>ſo profuſely ſquandred away, that very few can after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards much boaſt of the Fruits of a Married State. But ſuppoſe ſuch Perſons have Children, which happens not often, they are moſt commonly Weak; Puny, Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Things, that either die ſoon, or if they happen by Chance and mere Force more of Phyſick than the Kitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, to grow up, they become Tender Sickly Perſons, always ailing and complaining of one Malady or another.</p>
            <p>What a Pleaſure is it to ſee, ſays an Ancient Author, a Man at the Age of Fourſcore, with a Wife near the ſame Antiquity, both bleſſed with healthy hail Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions, freſh wholeſome Looks, ſound Minds, and perfect Senses, (<hi>Mens Sana in Corpore ſano,</hi> as <hi>Juvenal</hi> ſays) with active, ſtrait, upright Limbs, walking without the adventitious Support of either Stick or Staff, and chearful Tempers, reſiding over a healthful numerous Progeny perhaps to the 3d. or 4th Generation; and all theſe Bleſſings owing under Almighty God to the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance and Continence of their Youths: And now wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in a good Old Age, to reſign their Breath in Peace. <hi>Et factus eſt in Pace locus ejus.</hi> — When if we do but turn our Eyes upon Licentious Livers, we ſhall find them ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a whole Legion and Complication of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes: Lean Jaws, hagged pale livid Looks, hollow Eyes ſunk into their Heads, feeble Hams, Legs without Calves, limping and hobling with a Stick, Gouty unactive Limbs, continually complaining of Weakneſſes and Pains in the Small of their Backs; in fine, worn and waſted away in the Prime of their Years by ſuch ſelf-Defilements: And in their latter Years, by Gleets, Gonorrhaeas and Conſumptions, their Spirits ſunk, Body waſted, Strength decayed, ſtill ſhifting about for change of Air; trying all the Baths in Chriſtendom; always conſulting one Phyſician or another, and yet after all, upon the leaſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of any Seaſon, or any other ſmall Accident, to give up their ſinful (and 'tis well if not almoſt deſpairing) Breath; and all this from having Enervated, Exhauſted, Conſumed, and Worn out their Bodies and Strength with the SINS OF THEIR YOUTHS, and by which Means they are now become a Jeſt to others, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes thought (tho' how unjuſtly, plainly appears to any one that only confiders the unhappy Conduct of their flouriſhing Youthful Days) the Reproach of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians,

What a diſmal Thing is it for a Perſon thus to to ſee that they are old, and have deſtroyed themſelves oftentimes before they are even 30 Years of Age? Inſomuch that no Sin draws its Slaves and Votaries into a greater Abyſs of Evils and Ruin than this.</p>
            <p>As to the Injuries Perſons do themſelves by this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Practice, they are no leſs evident, ſince of ſuch Perſons who have theſe Abominarions in their Youth proſtrated and enervated their Strength, very few ever come to that Strength and Robuſtneſs, which otherwiſe they would have arrived at, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides Stranguries, Gleets, Gonorrhaeas, and other ſuch Weakneſſes, far more difficult to be Cured than thoſe Contracted from either the Secret Diſeaſe or its Cure: So that we'll ſuppoſe 2 Perſons to be afflicted with Gleets: One of theſe Gleets is purely the Effect of the Secret Diſeaſe and its Cure, in a Perſon whom we will ſuppoſe never to have been in all their Life Guilty of the Misfortune this Chapter treats of. The other Gleet is not only the Effect of the Secret Diſeaſe and its Cure, but alſo is on a Perſon whom we'll ſuppoſe to be concerned in this Chapter: This laſt Gleet is much harder to Cope with and Cure, than the Former: The Reaſon of this will be obvious to every Perſon who does but conſider, that ſuch deteſtable Actions, being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together Unnatural, by conſequence are ſo many Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, Strains, &amp; Forces upon and againſt Nature; &amp; therefore not only the Mucous Glands in the Paſſage, but even the <hi>Proſtatae, Parastatae,</hi> &amp; <hi>Seminal Veſſels</hi> themſelves, are ſo extremely Relaxed, Debilitated, Weakned, &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervated thereby, that it is no wonder that the whole Conſtitution pays dearly for it afterwards; as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of Perſons too fatally experience, who ever in their Youths have been guilty of this abominable Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; Inſomuch that many Young Perſons, who were
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1046500300:18"/>ſtrong and luſty before they abandoned themſelves to this Vice, have been ſo entirely Worn out and Ruined by it, as to become Old before half their Years came on: For by thus robbing themſelves of their Strength, and empoveriſhing their Spirits by depriving their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of its Balmy and Vital Juice by this abominable Practice, they have become ſo dry and emaciated, as to be ſent to their Graves, a great many Years ſooner than otherwiſe they would have been.</p>
            <p>Perhaps my Reader may ask of me, that ſince the Weakneſs of Mankind and Propenſion to Ill is ſo very great, that if we run thro' the whole Decalogue, there is not one Precept whoſe Transgreſſors deſerve more Commiſeration and Pity than this: What way muſt Youth preſerve themſelves from it? No one's Strength being to be depended on in this Point, for thoſe who think themſelves ſecure, St. <hi>Paul</hi> charges to take Care leaſt they fall: So that if we truſt only to our Reaſon, we ſhall find in the End that this is no manner of Match at all to our Inclinations, which are infinitely ſtronger: Inſomuch that whoever beats a Parley with Senſual Pleaſures, is already capitulating with his Enemy, and will be vanquiſhed at laſt. The great Preſervative then is chiefly to avoid Idleneſs, and fly all Occaſions of Ill: <hi>Apprehende Fugam,</hi> (ſays an Ancient Author) <hi>ſi vis habere Victoriam.</hi> For <hi>Qui tangit Picem,</hi> as ſurely <hi>inquina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitur ab eâ,</hi> As he who loves <hi>Periculum,</hi> moſt certainly ſooner or later <hi>in illo peribit.</hi> And therefore they will find to their Sorrow, that a ſhort Fleeting Pleaſure of only a Moment, <hi>in fine mordebit ut Coluber:</hi> Like a poor ſilly Fly hovering about the Flame, thinking it to be as ſweet as it appears fair, periſhes at the firſt Tryal. And however ſuch Perſons may thro' the Inſtigation of the Devil flatter themſelves, that whenever the Fact is committed, that it is but a trifling Fault; yet it has ſo Tarniſhed their Soul, that afterwards they can have no Innocence to boaſt of, having prodigally Barter'd it for a momentary Satisfaction, as <hi>Eſau</hi> did with his Birth-right, for the tranſient Senſuality of a Meſs of Pottage; the Barrier that fenced their Chaſtity being broke, the Enemy to Purity and Holineſs makes daily Incurſions, and ravages thro' every Paſſage of the Conquered Soul. And altho' by a demure outward Be
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1046500300:19"/>haviour and Carriage, the Eyes of Men may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, yet an All-ſeeing God cannot be hinder'd from witneſſing an Act which his Holineſs ſo much abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, as to exclude us (without true Repentance for it) eternally from the Kingdom of Heaven: A Loſs, to ballance which our Saviour expreſsly tells us, that the whole World is not an Aequivalent, <hi>What Profit is it to a Man to gain the whole World, if he loſes his own Soul.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How many unhappy Souls are there in the World, who never would have been guilty of enormous Crimes, if they had not in their Youths been initiated in Sin by this unhappy Practice? And how many again are there, whoſe Affairs in the World Almighty God has attended with Judgments ever ſince, as a Puniſhment of ſuch horrid Facts committed formerly in their Youth. To avert all which the only way is to practice Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue betimes, and early to leave off theſe Abominations: And whatever Difficulty is experienced in overcoming a vicious Habit, the perſons muſt conſider, that it is a Burden of their own making, and therefore they ought the more chearfully to undergo the overcomeing it.</p>

            <head>CHAP. 4. <hi>Of a</hi> Simple Gonorrhaea, <hi>whence it proceeds, and how it differs from a common</hi> Gleet.</head>
            <p>BEſides the Infirmity hitherto treated of, there is yet another ſort of Weakneſs of much worſe Conſequence, and which for the reſemblance it bears to a Gleet, is often confounded under the ſame Name by Perſons unacquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Difference, whereas in rigour 'tis no ſuch thing, and is properly called a <hi>Simple Gonorrhaea,</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh it from that virulent Efflux of Matter common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, tho' very improperly called a Gonorrhaea, and is That which afflicts Perſons who have actually the Secret Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Simple Gonorrhaea</hi> is an involuntary Emiſſion of a real ſeminal Matter by reaſon of the Caruncles through which it owzes from the Neck of the Veſiculae ſeminales into the Urethra being ſo injured, weakned and relaxed in their Fibres, as to permit the ſeminal Matter inſenſibly to come away. This is an Infirmity that may indeed, but does not often happen; and when it does, the Perſon in a little time grows lean, pale, weak and feeble, eſpecially about the Loins, and is ſoon brought into a <hi>Tales Dorſalis,</hi> and if not ſpeedily taken care of, to his Grave. So that notwithſtanding the vulgar call almoſt every involuntary

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> this Infirmity laſt mentioned is only and truly a <hi>Gonorrhaea</hi> or Efflux of real and true ſeminal Matter. Wherea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> manifeſt from what has been already ſaid of a Gleet; and alſo in the Firſt Chapter of the Practical Scheme above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned concerning a Gonorrhaea. So that a <hi>Gleet,</hi> which is commonly tho moſt improperly called a Gonorrhaea, is in reality nothing but only a dripping or owzing away of that mucous ſlimy Liquor, ſeparated by the Glands in the Urethra for the lubrication of it, as has been above fully ſaid, and generally ſpeaking, free from any Venereal Infection: So that a Perſon may have a <hi>Gleet</hi> upon them a conſiderable time without being ſo viſibly emaciated and weakened as they wou'd be in a very ſmall time by a Simple Gonorrhaea: Tho' nevertheleſs, to let a Gleet run on from Year to Year as many do, without ſeeking a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for it, is a moſt certain Means to bring on a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, as hereafter will be ſhewed.</p>
            <p>A Simple Gonorrhaea is cauſed by Falls, Strains, lifting too great a Weight, Wreſtling, violent Riding, Running, Jumping, carrying of heavy Burdens, &amp;c. and is ſo very difficult an Infirmity to Cure, as oftentimes to be even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curable. But as for a <hi>Gleet,</hi> 'tis only after Venereal Cures, or ſome certain over-ſtrainings and Self-abuſes, too much or unskilful Purging, &amp;c. Inſomuch that through a very great weakneſs and relaxation of the Orifices of the Glands in the Urethra from the above-mentioned Cauſes, a great many Perſons have been left with ſeeming incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Gleets upon them, tho' under the Care of other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reputed ingenious Men in their Profeſſion: For which Reaſon it is, that few Perſons get clear of a Clap without more or leſs of a Gleet.</p>
            <p>From what has hitherto been ſaid, it appears that the true Seat of a ſimple Gonorrhaea is in the ſeminal Veſſels: Whereas the Seat of a virulent Running and a Gleet is in no other Part than the Urethra, as fully has already been ſhewed, and alſo in the Firſt Chapter of the Practical Scheme. And 'tis for want of a true diſtinction in this Point that ſo many People are ruined by improper Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, from an erroneous Notion of the Seat of the Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>Moreover, beſides the above-mentioned cauſes of a

            <p>THeſe are Infirmities I ſhould here take no Notice of, if it were not for the ſake of a great many Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Perſons labouring under them, who to beſure will ſend for this little Book in expectation of Aſſiſtance from it, and in hopes thereby to avoid the Shock of diſcovering and making known thoſe Ailments to others which moſt who labour under them uſe their utmoſt diligence to Screen and Hide: That therefore this preſent little Tract may not be defective, but fully anſwer whatever can be expected from its Title: Theſe Weakneſſes being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which altho ſome Women are more ſubject to then others, yet at ſome time or another ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny labour under them, that ſcarce any are wholly exempt from them: And what is ſtill worſe, out of ſuch great Numbers as are afflicted with them, very few ever get a true and ſolid Cure, either thro a difficulty in themſelves to diſcover 'em: Or a neglect of their Cure, by thinking them trivial Infirmities, which time will Cure, without conſidering the ill conſequences they will produce: Or for want of Judgment in thoſe that undertake their Cure, they thro a baſhfulneſs of diſcovering their Caſe to Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Skill, conſult only ſuch whoſe knowledge reaches no farther then <hi>Turpentine Pills, Bole Armenick</hi> &amp; <hi>Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, Arch-Angel, Clary</hi> and other ſuch like things, as inſignificant to many, as the Judgment was defective that preſcribed them.</p>
            <p>I muſt here therefore take Notice, That the Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1046500300:22"/>obſervable in moſt Accounts of theſe Weakneſſes (for by this Name of WEAKNESS, I ſhall always for Decency ſake throughout this Chapter mean the Subject it treats of) hitherto publiſhed, and the ſhocking expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in deſcribing them, have induced me to ſay ſome thing on this ſubject, which I'll endeavour to do in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as may lead thoſe of my Readers to whom this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter only belongs, into a true knowledge of their State, and Method of its Cure, with as little Information to others not concerned in it (I mean the Men) as poſſibly the Subject will admit of.—Theſe Weakneſſes are of much the ſame Nature as <hi>Gleets</hi> in Men: For as the abovementioned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxed and weakned Mucous Glands in the <hi>Urethra</hi> or <hi>Uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Paſſage,</hi> ſeparate and diſcharge that Matter which conſtitutes a GLEET in Men; ſo (obſerving a requiſite Proportion) other Cervical Glandules or ſmall Veſſels of the ſame Nature proportionably in the Neck of the Womb in Women, and deſigned for much the ſame Uſe of lubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating it, ſeparates &amp; diſcharges alſo the Matter of theſe Weakneſſes; So that theſe Glandules being rendred Weak, Lax, and Looſe, &amp; thereby deprived of their natural due Tone and Springyneſs, either from the ill Conſtitution of the Stomach, and a Seroſity or Crude Chyle in the Maſs of Blood, depraved by Diſtempers, or ſome ill Accidents, by which Means thoſe Veſſels cannot ſufficiently retain the proper Humor ſeparated by them from the Blood, for much the ſame uſe proportionably as in Men, <hi>viz.</hi> to Lubricate or Moiſten the Paſſage tho for another end, but let it Gleet thus involuntarily and ſlide away. And altho Women being of a more cold and moiſt Habit of Body then Men; &amp; on that account, &amp; ſome others more liable to be afflicted with theſe WEAKNESSES then Men are with Gleets: Yet a Gleet in Men, and theſe Weakneſſes in Women are oftentimes one &amp; the ſame Diſeaſe, &amp; owe their Origin very often to the ſame Cauſes, which gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in Men are Venereal ones, tho not always ſo in Women: but ſometimes Hard and Difficult Labours, Colds or Hurts in Lying in, eſpecially in weak and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed Habits of Body, and many other Accidents which attend the Sex. But to ſpeak the Truth: Gleets in Men moſt commonly owe their beginning to the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Diſeaſe, and ſo ſometimes does alſo theſe Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes in Women; the Infection of which having been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried

               </gap> Weeping or Dripping properly called a Gleet in Men, and Weakneſſes in Women, will, (eſpecially in an ill ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of Body) for a long time after remain; unleſs proper Meaſures be taken for a Cure.</p>
            <p>From what has been hitherto ſaid plainly appears what a Simple Gonorrhaea (which very ſeldom happens) and what a Gleet in Men; and what Weakneſſes in Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are (which are very common Infirmities.) They are all (generally ſpeaking) free from any Infection, &amp; can never (let Practitioners ſay what they pleaſe to fright timorous Patients) degenerate into the Venereal Diſeaſe. Theſe Weakneſſes as well as Gleets in Men are generally eſteem'd very hard to Cure, and ſo indeed frequently they are, but if proper Meaſures and Means be but taken; both Men &amp; Women, may in a competent time, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much inconvenience be freed from theſe trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome and diſagreeable Companions, eſpecially to Neat and Cleanly Perſons.</p>
            <p>There are few Women eſpecially of the Weaker Sort, but at one time or other are aflicted with theſe Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, they being an Infirmity often attendant upon, and cauſed by concomitant or preceeding Diſtempers: Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that generally ſpeaking whatever Diſeaſe reduces a Woman to a languid weakly State, it is commonly ſucceeded by this Indiſpoſition: For which Reaſon Women that are naturally of a more weak Conſtitution or Habit of Body than ordinary, are more ſubject to theſe Weakneſſes than others.</p>
            <p>Some Women indeed have theſe Weakneſſes much more moderate than others, and not continually, but at certain Times only, without cauſing any great or remarkable Proſtration of Strength 'till after a Year or 2 or more: But then it becomes more violent and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, weakning the Body exceſſively, and is then much more hard to cure. This being a known and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Truth, that the longer theſe Weakneſſes have afflicted the Patient, and the larger in Quantity they are, the longer Time will be required, and the more difficult will it be, to accompliſh the Cure, the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1046500300:24"/>being more habituated to come away, and the Glandules in the Veſſels more weakned and ſpoiled.</p>
            <p>It is equally as hard a matter as it is uſeful for a Phyſician ſometimes to diſtinguiſh well between theſe Weakneſſes and other Diſtempers which reſemble them, their Conſequences and their Cure being widely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent: For Numbers of Women who have met with ill Husbands, have labour'd under the Venereal or Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Diſeaſe for ſome Years together, ſtill imagining it to be that Weakneſs this preſent Chapter treats of.</p>
            <p>Thus it being very difficult for Women to diſtinguiſh theſe Diſtempers, and yet abſolutely neceſſary that they ſhould, it may (generally ſpeaking,) be done by this Rule of <hi>Hippocrates,</hi> which altho' for Decency ſake I ſhall be very cautious in expreſſing, yet thoſe Perſons to whom this Chapter belongs, and is deſign'd for, will ſufficiently comprehend. The Rule is this. That theſe Weakneſſes, of which this preſent Chapter Treats, ceaſes in Women at certain Periodical Times, and do not trouble them 'till ſuch Times are over. Whereas a Venereal Running remains conſtantly upon the Patient, and does nor ceaſe at any Time.</p>
            <p>Many are the deplorable Ill Effects of theſe Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, (the unhappy Companion of Womankind) if not in time remedied; but as this Subject s more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the following Chapter, where I ſhall treat at large of the ill Conſequences of theſe Weakneſſes, I ſhall refer my Readers to it.</p>

            <p>A Great many Perſons not knowing, or at leaſt not reflecting, and conſidering the ill Conſequences of <hi>Gleets</hi> and other ſuch Weakneſſes, look upon them as trivial Infirmities which Time and Patience will Cure: Whereas, altho' at preſent, theſe Infirmities may give no other uneaſineſs or trouble than what is oppoſite to Neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Cleanlineſs, being no grateful Companions to a clean neat Man, yet by their continuance greatly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair the Health, by waſting the Body, and bringing it into a viſible Conſumption. The reaſon of which is: A <hi>Gleet</hi> may in ſome meaſure, and not improperly be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to an Iſſue, which ſeems as a Receptacle for the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors of the whole Body, but more eſpecially of the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1046500300:25"/>adjacent Parts to run to; ſo that Perſons who have a <hi>Gleet,</hi> or any other like Weakneſs upon them, have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a conſtant Drain to their Body, which as has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed, by a continual diſcharge of that Matter which comes away, not only exhauſts it of that Mucous Liquor, which is a ſtrength and ſupport to the Parts where a <hi>Gleet</hi> is ſituated, but alſo draws away thereby a conſtant ſupply of thoſe other Juices, wherein the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor and Strength of the Conſtitution conſiſts: The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of which is, that near theſe Parts both of Men and Women, there are certain Emunctories placed, whoſe uſe is to receive the ſuperfluous Humors or Recre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the whole Body, and diſcharge them thro' the genital Parts: So that the greater this diſcharge of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors is, the more are the Parts not only weakn'd by it, &amp; the more inceſſantly &amp; plentifully do theſe Humors flow, but alſo the Nutritious Juices deſtined to the nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſupport of the Neighbouring Parts, flows down with it, and are evacuated. So that at length by reaſon of this loſs of the Nutritious Juice, which flowing to the ſame Place, is alſo corrupted and continually ſent away, not only Weakneſs and Pains, together with a Pining and Waſting of the neighbouring Parts, but of the whole Body does ſucceed, from a poor weak and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pirited Chyle the Blood abounds with. And to this Cauſe it is, that the greateſt part of Broken and decay'd Conſtitutions are owing. But as I have treated at large on this Subject of Spoiled and Broken Conſtitutions by Faſt Living, former ill Cures, Salivations, and Mercury in the 3d Chapter of my <hi>Practical Scheme,</hi> to be had GRATIS where this Book is Given away; I ſhall not repeat that Subject here, but refer my Reader to it.</p>
            <p>The Body therefore being thus emptied and drained of thoſe Nutritious Juices, which in healthy, hail, ſound Perſons, are its ſupport: In length of time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Pains and Weakneſs, eſpecially in the Loins and ſmall of the Back, enſues; together with a debility and weakneſs in the Nerves and Joints, Pale, Faint and livid Looks, eſpecially about the Eyes, Melancholy, loſs of Appetite, decay of Spirits and Strength, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Wearyneſs over the whole Body, ſwelling in the Legs, and an univerſal decay of Strength.</p>
            <p>So that theſe Symptoms not ſtoping in time, (as moſt
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1046500300:26"/>Perſons in the begining deceive themſelves they will, fancing a <hi>Gleet</hi> to be an inconſiderable Thing, and that it will wear off of it ſelf, in proceſs of Time) they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, and are followed alſo by others, as an almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual Thirſt, a hectical Diſpoſition, Atrophy, and waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Fleſh, till at length the Body is ſo drained, as to be brought into the higheſt degree of a Conſumption.</p>
            <p>All which Symptoms are occaſioned by the great loſs of the Mucous Liquor of the Glands, which being thus weakned and relaxed, have their Meatus's or openings ſo widened, and looſened, as not be able to reſtrain the Flux or dripping away of the Matter, whereby the withering of the whole Body, with a dryneſs and Sicci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Nerves and Nervous Juices muſt neceſſarily in a ſhort time enſue.</p>
            <p>As for the effects or ill Conſequences of a real Simple Gonorrhaea, they are no leſs diſmal then ſpeedy; For in a little time, ſays Dr. <hi>Willis,</hi> from the vaſt Efflux of real ſeminal Matter, the whole Strength is proſtrated, a <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bes dorſalis</hi> preſently enſues, and terminates in the Grave.</p>
            <p>It remains now to ſpeak a Word or two of the ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects and conſequences of Weakneſſes in Women, as I have already done of <hi>Gleets</hi> in Men, as I promiſed above in the foregoing Chapter. Since therefore what I have already ſaid in this Chapter, is to be proportionably ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to Women: The Effects of theſe Weakneſſes are Pains in the ſmall of the Back and Head, want of Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite, bad Digeſtion, Wearineſs, and Reſtleſſneſs, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſwellings of the Legs, pale livid Countenance. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And as this Evil is moſtly occaſioned by foregoing Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, (tho alſo ſometimes by ſudden Frights, violent Exerciſe, irregular Living, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) ſo it weakens the Body alſo more and more, bringing the whole human Frame into a pining deſperate State, unleſs cured by proper Remedies skillfully adminiſtred in time, no evil in the World, that uſually happens to Women, being of ſo very ill conſequence to the Looks, Complexion, Mind, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, Strength, and whole Body as this.</p>
            <p>Inſomuch that if this great Evil (which too often proves the BANE and Ruin of Woman kind) be not timely remedied, it certainly cauſes either untimely Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs, or if they have Children, they are weak, infirm, and diſeaſed, and the Blood and Juices become more and
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1046500300:27"/>more impoveriſhed, till an inevitable Conſumption, Dropſy and other Diſtempers, prove only the Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of immediately enſuing Death.</p>

            </head>
            <p>THE Deſign of this Chapter being to ſhew how every Perſon that has received an Injury, and been under Cure for it, may know whether the Malignity be wholy carried off or not: And if there be any Running or Gleeting ſtill remaining afterwards, whether it proceeds from any Secret Infection ſtill lurking behind, or from Medicines taken for a Cure, or from a natural Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Parts, which ſome Perſons from a more then ordinary delicacy and tenderneſs of Conſtitution are lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to, notwithſtanding the utmoſt Care both of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Perſon under whoſe Hands they were during their Cure; My Reader is to take notice, that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a due evacuation and clearing of the Body of the Venereal Infection, the mattery running which before was Yellowiſh, Green or Bloody, looſes by Degrees both it's colour and quantity, and comes at laſt to a perfect Whiteneſs or Tranſparency, reſembling very much the white of an Egg, and is Slimy, Mucilaginous, and Ropy; and the Parts are eaſy and cool: All which are admirable Signs, and the ſtrongeſt Preſumption that the Malignity is carried off, and the Perſon cured and well. But ſince it frequently alſo happens that a Perſon may be ſaid to be (not ill) cured, altho' theſe ſigns of a good Cure, may not be altogather ſo very perfect as here they are deſcribed to be, we muſt examin this matter ſtill a little farther, for the full Satisfaction of the moſt timorous of my Readers.</p>
            <p>It has indeed been a common Opinion that in <hi>Gleets,</hi> when the Matter that comes away is ſtill diſcouloured being either yellowiſh or green, that it is a certain Sign, (and indeed an only one) of a remaining Infection, and an imperfect or ill Cure. 'Tis true, that when the Matter that comes away in a <hi>Gleet,</hi> or other ſuch Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is not diſcouloured at all, but is pure White, Glu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinous

               </gap> lurking Infection, or a former ill Cure, when even theſe ſigns are not ſo very perfect. The reaſon of this is; that in ſome Habits of Body the Owzing Matter which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutes a <hi>Gleet</hi> will in ſome length of time, and in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed habits of Body, in its Separation from the Blood be ſo permixt with ſome certain Corroſive (but not at all Venereal) Particles, as thereby to be ſo colliquat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and altered in it's Texture and Coheſion of it's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituent Parts, as to appear a ſort of Pus, Sanies or Matter ſomething diſcoloured, that will very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble the Relicks and Remains of a Venereal Infection, or an ill Cure: And if a Perſon ſhould think to change this Colour by Purging, one might, as Dr <hi>Harvey</hi> obſerves, Purge a Perſon's Life away as ſoon as change either it's Colour, or cauſe it's entire Abatement. So that the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctitioner imagining that all yellowiſh Runnings are malignant (which is a vulgar Error) goes on ſtill in hopes of changing it, 'till at length the Parts are ſo weakned, that the Poor Patient has a <hi>Gleet</hi> fixt upon him, and thereby rendred worſe inſtead of better, and perhaps at laſt told they are incurable.</p>
            <p>To ſhew the Truth of this, it is to be obſerved that the imprudent Continuation of Venereal Catharticks, rather keeps on the yellowneſs of the Running then abates it, by keeping up the humors in a conſtant Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Ebullition, and thereby inflaming and frothing them up into a yellow Bilous Spume or Scum, which is daily ſeparated in the Parts, that are now become as it were a Ciſtern, to which Cuſtom has made an open Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and converted the Orifice of the Urethra into (as it were) an Iſſue, to which the depraved humors of the Body, and eſpecially of the adjacent Parts flow: And which humors, as the Blood (even in very well cured Perſons) is tinctured with Choler, and depraved and altered by a long Courſe of Phyſick, do alſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably partake more or leſs of a yellowiſh Colour.

            <p>AS I have endeavoured hitherto demonſtratively to deduce the Seat and Nature of a <hi>Gleet,</hi> and other ſuch Weakneſſes from it's Symptoms, and the Anatomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Structure of the Part it affects, without engaging in any of the Hypotheſes of the Ancients; ſo I'll now endeavour to draw ſuch conſequences from the Nature of the Infirmity thus diſcovered, which will prove the plaineſt and moſt ſatisfactory Courſe that can be taken to arrive at the moſt exact ways of curing it; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the common Methods of Cure of late Years in Practice, are found from their want of Succeſs not ſufficiently grounded on Reaſon and Experience. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a manifeſt truth, that the beſt Methods of Cure are always taken from a <hi>Rational</hi> Notion of the Nature and Cauſe of a Diſeaſe: Human <hi>Reaſon</hi> being never of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe in any part of human Life, then it is in the Practice of Phyſick. For as Dr. <hi>Mead</hi> ſays in the Preface
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1046500300:30"/>to his Eſſays on Poiſons, He alone is the moſt likely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to Cure any ailment or diſorder in a human Body, who beſt underſtands the human Oconomy, the Tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Parts, the Motions of the Fluids, and by conſequence the Source and <hi>Origin</hi> of the Diſorder, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that of Celſus, <hi>Recte Curaturum, quem prima origo Cauſae non fefellerit.</hi> Having therefore above in the ſecond and following Chapters, clearly accounted for the moſt Rational Cauſe of <hi>Gleets,</hi> Simple <hi>Gonorrhaeas</hi> and other Weakneſſes, the ſubject Matter of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Treatiſe: I hope alſo as clearly now to ſhew the moſt Rational Method of their Cure: As follows:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>In omnibus contrarietas Remedio eſt,</hi> is an Aphoriſm of the great Hippocrates, and holds good in the Cure of our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Infirmity, as well as in the Cure of any other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſorder of the Body whatſoever. Inſomuch that if there be a Heat and Inflammation in any Part, recourſe muſt be had to thoſe things that are Cooling. In cold Diſeaſes to warm Medicines. If any Humor is ſharp and corroſive, it muſt be reduced to a due degree of ſoftneſs by mollifying Medicines. If any parts are injured, and weakned, ſtrengthning, healing and Balſamick ones muſt be made uſe of before ever a Cure can be effected, in order to reſtore the debilita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Parts to their firſt Tone and Vigour. So that in our preſent Infirmity which we have now before us, we find from what has been hitherto ſaid, the following obſtacle, and which muſt neceſſarily be removed before ever we can hope to reinſtate the Patient, <hi>viz.</hi> — The openings of the Mucous Glands ſo often abovemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Urethra being weakned, looſned, and relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the above mentioned Cauſes, are thereby become flabby, limber and looſe, which before in a ſound State were ſpringy, vigorous and ſtrong; ſo that by this means the <hi>Oſtiola</hi> or Mouths of them being deprived of their natural Power of (in ſome meaſure proportionable at leaſt to their bigneſs,) contracting and drawing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together after every Emiſſion of that Mucous ſlimy Liquor they contain, are by conſequence always open, by which means this Liquor is continually owz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out from them and coming away. This being the true ſtate of our preſent Queſtion, and the rational Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle we have now to encounter with, as ſufficiently
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1046500300:31"/>appears from what has been above ſaid: 'Tis natural to conclude, that the only true and rational Method of Cure of <hi>Gleets,</hi> and any other Weakneſſes of the ſame kind whether in Men or Women, muſt conſiſt, in one word for all, without any manner of Evaſion or going round the Buſh, in affecting the very Place it ſelf from whence the dripping Liquor is diſcharged; and this is done by STRENGTHNING theſe Glands, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by reſtoring their Openings and Mouths to their former power of contracting, and conſtringing themſelves after every Emiſſion of the Mucous Liquor they contain; by which means a certain Bar and Hindrance will be put to their diſcharging more of it, then is wiſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Nature, as juſt enough for the lubrication and moiſtening of the Paſſage and no more, and for which end alone ſhe has deſigned it. This being once effected, juſt ſo much and no more of this Liquor will afterwards proceed from theſe Glands, as juſt the defence of the Urethra requires as a Preſervative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſharpneſs and ſaltneſs of the Urine as it paſſes thro: it being an eſtabliſhed Maxim in Philoſophy, That upon the removal of any Cauſe, the effect pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ceaſes. So that wherever the Cauſe lies, <hi>That</hi> muſt be applied to, before ever we can expect the effects to ceaſe. But how to bring this about, <hi>Hic Labor, hoc Opus eſt,</hi> it's Reſidence being in a part which Nature ſeems particularly to have affected the concealment.</p>
            <p>Hence my Reader may plainly ſee, that the great difficulty which has now puzled ſo many Ages in the Cure of <hi>Gleets</hi> and other ſuch ſorts of Weakneſſes, is all (from only a few evidently demonſtrable Principles above eſtabliſhed) reduceable, to one only ſingle inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Cure, <hi>viz.</hi> to Strengthen theſe Glands. 'Tis no wonder then that the Ancients found ſuch difficulty in this matter, as after all poſſible endeavours ſometimes to leave their Patients at beſt only <hi>in ſtatu quo;</hi> tho' in rigour this may be very much doubted, it being pretty certain that neither the continuance of a <hi>Gloet,</hi> nor any of the common Methods of its Cure, have been ever as yet found to improve a Conſtitution, or to change it, otherwiſe, then from a ſtrong to a weaker one.</p>
            <p>Our next Enquiry then muſt be, how this Intention of Cure is to be brought about and effected with the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1046500300:32"/>greateſt Eaſe and Security to the Patient, and what t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> other whatſoever Cauſes. And for want of ſuch a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as this 'tis, that a great many Perſons (altho, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe perfectly well) come to have ſeemingly incure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Gleets</hi> fixt and entailed upon them. For which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is that a <hi>Gleet</hi> is always more or leſs difficult to Cure, as it is of greater or leſs Continuance, or is occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by more or leſs Frequent ſelf Abuſes, or a more or leſs virulent Humor which gave the preceeding Infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion; by every one of which cauſes the <hi>Glands</hi> are always more or leſs ſtretched, weakned and debilitated</p>
            <p>The Method then I here aim at in the Cure of our preſent Infirmities, is by ſuch Medicines as are appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in a peculiar manner, and by a Singular Specifick qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Influence, and tendency to the Injured and debilitated Glands in the Urethra and parts adjacent chiefly above any other Part or Parts of the Body whatſoever, and thereby not only ſo to act upon and affect THEM in particular as to ſtrengthen cloſe and conſtringe their Mouths and Orifices, but alſo to preſerve them hereafter in this ſound State. So that theſe Glands being reeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by this Method of Cure, their acquired Vigour will enable them to reſiſt any future ingreſs of faſter ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of the Matter they ſeparate and ſecerne, then is juſt neceſſary and no more for the moiſtening and lubrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Urethra, and ſo turning them off to be diſcharged by Nature another way. So that whilſt the Ancients were Trifling with <hi>Their</hi> long tedious and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain Methods of Cure, Wonders are performed by <hi>This.</hi> Beſides, this Method of Cure ſucceeding to the Satisfaction of the Patient, is a ſtrong Confirmation of the Truth of the Theory above eſtabliſhed: Whereas

            <p>From what has been hitherto ſaid, it plainly appears that this our Method of Cure is not only effectual in Men, but will be found upon Tryal to be inferiour to few, for thoſe Weakneſſes mentioned above in the 4th Chap. in Women.</p>
            <p>I will not here trouble my Readers in proving that in Nature there are ſome certain Medicines which being taken into the Stomach, will immediately tend towards and make their Way to, ſome one particular part of the Body <hi>Electively</hi> and preferably to any other: Having fully cleared that Difficulty in the 8th, 9th, and 10th Chapters of the 3d Edition of My New SYSTEM of the GOUT and RHEUMATISM, to be had Gratis where this Book is Given away. I deſire them therefore to read thoſe Chapters, wherein I have clearly ſhewn how Medicines by a particular Specifick Quality they are endowed with, will (being taken into the Stomach) tend to and have an influence over ſome one peculiar Part of the Body, which they are deſigned particularly to relieve, rather then any other, as is there clearly ſhewed in Medicines appropriated to the Cure of the GOUT. All which I hope will fully convince any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the Poſſibility of a Strengthning Reſtorative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine's being taken into the Stomach, and from thence to tend towards and make it's way (by means of the Bloods Circulation) immediately to that Part in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar above any other in the Body whatſoever, which is the true Seat of a <hi>Gleet,</hi> I mean the Urethra or Urinary Paſſage. This Point therefore being fully diſcuſſed in thoſe Chapters of the abovementioned Syſtem, I'll ſay nothing more of that Subject here, but refer my Reader to the peruſal of that Book, which he may have for only Asking for, at the Places abovementioned where this Book is Given away.</p>

               </gap> Strengthning Medicines that are made uſe of in the Cure of <hi>Gleets,</hi> be alſo endowed with a certain detergent Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, by which they may in their paſſage to thoſe Parts they are chiefly deſigned for, ſo Cleanſe, Sweeten and Purify the Blood, as at the ſame time that they Streng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Glands in the Urethra, they may alſo change the Colour of the Liquor theſe Glands contain: And by thus changing of it's ill Colour, it's Subſtance if too thin will alſo <hi>ſecundario</hi> &amp; <hi>per accidens</hi> be changed at the ſame time. For ſince whenever the Matter Dripping &amp; Owzing away in <hi>Gleets</hi> and other ſuch Weakneſſes is too thin, it proceeds from its being Colliquated (and if I may uſe the Expreſſion as it were in a manner melted down and Liquid) by thoſe Impurities which are mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and blended with it out of the Maſs of Blood: Theſe Impurities and Foulneſſes being once cleanſed out of the Blood, the Mucous ſlimy Matter will naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume again its own natural Tenacious and Glutinous Conſiſtence, as it has in <hi>Statu ſano.</hi>

            <p>My Reader perhaps will ask me whether or no this Method of Cure is proper in <hi>all ſorts</hi> of <hi>Gleets</hi> and other ſuch Weakneſſes. To which I Anſwer, that when a <hi>Gleet</hi> is purely ſuch, and entirely free from any Relicks or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of former Infection, the abovementioned Method of Cure is inferiour to few in the World. If therefore the <hi>Gleet</hi> or other ſuch Weakneſs be what proceeds from a former Cured Injury, and that the Perſon had no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſuch Infirmity upon them before they received and were Cured of that Injury, it is abſolutely neceſſary for the Patients ſafety firſt of all to be ſatisfied, that there is no remaining Malignity attending it, which my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will ſufficiently be inſtructed in from what has been above ſaid in the foregoing Chapter. But if Perſons are any ways doubtful whether or no the <hi>Gleet</hi> may ſtill Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of any Preceeding Infection, it will be neceſſary to clear the Body and by Conſequence the <hi>Gleet</hi> or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch Weakneſs of whatever former Infection it may be ſtill blended, and mixed with, leaſt inſtead of Cure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Perſon of a <hi>Gleet,</hi> ſomething of worſe Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence be fixt and rivetted upon him.

            <p>Hence it appears that <hi>Gleets</hi> and other ſuch Weakneſſes are not ſo difficult of Cure as a great many Perſons make them to be, who after all their Endeavours to rid the Patients of them to no purpoſe, diſmiſs them at laſt with their Opinion that they'll never be cured, aſſuring them at the ſame time, it will never hurt them, &amp; that Nature at length will Wear and throw it off, and the like: Which a great many give Credit to, in hopes of finding it true, 'till time has made this Error too mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly appear, for inſtead of Natures overcoming it, &amp; their finding no inconvenience by it, it has grown worſe and worſe, and proved at laſt ſo very inconvenient, that the poor Patient has born it with no ſmall Uneaſyneſs.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IX. <hi>Of a certain Strengthning Restorative Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for the Cure of Gleets and other ſuch Weakneſſes.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>THE Learned Dr. <hi>Cockburn</hi> in his Treatiſe of a <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norrhaea,</hi> 2d <hi>Edition,</hi> pag. 210. lays this down for a general Rule in Phyſick: <hi>Viz.</hi> That no Medicine is to be received for its ſingular Uſe, 'till it has had many Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als in proper Circumſtances; <hi>i. e.</hi> 'till it has been uſed on a Number of People equally ill, or that it has its Effects, when no reaſonable hopes are left of a Cure by the beſt of other Medicines Skilfully adminiſtred. Hence it is by conſequence to be concluded that when a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine has ſhewed its Efficacy in theſe Circumſtances, it not only may, but even ought to be received by eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Perſon ſolicitous for their Health and Welfare.</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1046500300:36"/>
            <p>After therefore having proceeded thus far with this Treatiſe, I ſhould be injurious to my Readers thus to explicate the Origin, Cauſe, Symptoms, Effects, and ill Conſequences, together with the moſt rational Method of Cure of their Infirmities, if I ſhould leave them there, perhaps ſomething Wiſer then they were before as to the juſt now enumerated Heads, but not a bit the nearer to a Cure. In order then not to entertain them with meer Speculations, I'll endeavour to give them ſome Practical Aſſiſtance, by propoſing here to the World, a truly Great and Noble Remedy for thoſe Weakneſſes and Diſorders here treated of.</p>
            <p>The Medicine I propoſe is a moſt excellent <hi>Balſamick Restorative,</hi> which for Recovering Nature in thoſe many Weakneſſes ſo frequently abovementioned has not many equals. It being a moſt Noble Strengthner in all Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, whether from Hard Labours, Over-ſtrainings, Wrenches, Miſcarriages, Self-Abuſes, &amp; other Secret Injuries and their Cures, in either Sex. Its efficacy alſo reaches ſtill farther, being of admirable Uſe to Cure Pains, Weakneſſes, and all Imbecilities of Nature, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Back, Reins, Loins, or elſewhere; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move or take away any Stoppage of Urine, by effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and yet gently (as Nature ſeems to defire) carrying off all Mucous, Filthy, Sanious and Infectious Matter Slime or Gravel lodged in the Reins, and elſewhere by ill Cures or other Cauſes; &amp; which either produces a Sharpneſs in the Urine, or a too frequent Provocation to make it: And thereby recovers the loſt Tone of the Seminal Veſſels and Mucous Glands in the Urethra ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten abovementioned. Deſtroying thereby all Relicks of Venereal Venom that lurking in the Body inſenſibly waſts and decays the Fleſh and Strength.</p>
            <p>And leaſt my Readers ſhould ſuſpect the poſſibility of the Operation of a Medicine taken in at the Mouth, and from thence conveyed into the Stomach, on a Part ſo remote from it, as that is which I have proved above in the 2d Chap. to be true, real, and indeed only Seat of a <hi>Gleet</hi> and other ſuch Weakneſs: I muſt refer them to what I have ſaid on this Subject in the 9th &amp; 10th Chapters of my abovementioned Syſtem of the GOUT &amp; <hi>Rheumatiſm.</hi> In which Chapters is as clearly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſo Nice &amp; Intricate a Subject will admit from the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1046500300:37"/>of the Modern Philoſophy, how 'tis very poſſble for a Medicine to be taken in at the Mouth, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed into the Stomach, and from thence to be mixed with that Portion of the Maſs of Blood which it finds circulating in the Veſſels there, by which means of the Bloods Circulation it is ſoon carried about the Body, &amp; by conſequence to That very individual part it is deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to relieve: As is fully proved in thoſe Chapters of the juſt now mentioned Syſtem, of the Operation of the Anti-Arthritick Medicine there propoſed to act upon even the very utmoſt and remoteſt extremities of the Body, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe Joints which uſually the Gout ſeizes. I deſire therefore my Readers, that ſince, they may have that <hi>System</hi> for only Asking for, they will be pleaſed to peruſe the 9th &amp; 10th Chapters of it, and apply them to this Subject, that I may not repeat the ſame Matter here over again. For as a Medicine taken for the Gout if it be a true and real <hi>Anti-Arthritick,</hi> never attempts to exert its principal Force of acting till it arrives along with the Blood, at the Glands of thoſe very Joints it is deſigned to relieve; juſt ſo the Great <hi>Restorative</hi> and Stengthing Medicine I here propoſe, being taken a few Drops of it, in a little Wine, Ale, or Beer, is thereby carried down into the Stomach, from whence it mixes it ſelf (being of a Spirituous Volatil Nature) with the Maſs of Blood, and is carried with it about the Body, and among other Parts, to that which is the true Seat of thoſe Infirmities here treated of. Being arrived there by a particular Specifick influence it bears over, &amp; Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to that Part above any other, and the Mucous Glands contained in it, it there begins to exert its force and to operate, by Strengthning, Healing, and Reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Mouths and Oſtiola of thoſe little Glands, to their former Elaſticity, Springyneſs and Vigour, by which means they will naturally again recover that Power they formerly had of Conſtringing themſelves as naturally they ought to do after every Emiſſion of the Mucous ſlimy Liquor they Contain, and which Nature has wiſely deſigned for the Lubrication of the Paſſage, as has ſufficiently been above explicated. This being once performed by this Great <hi>Reſtorative</hi> Medicine, and the Mouths of theſe Glands being recovered from their looſeneſs and flabbyneſs, to an Elaſtick Springy State, by
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1046500300:38"/>conſequence a Bar will thereby be put for the future, by which juſt ſo much and no more of this Mucous ſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my Liquor will be let out &amp; come away, then juſt the Moiſtening &amp; Lu brication of the Paſſage in a hail ſound ſtate requires: By which means, a <hi>Gleet</hi> which perhaps for a long time has afflicted the Patient will be taken away, and the Parts reſtored to their former due ſtate of Health and Strength.</p>
            <p>The property of this great <hi>Reſtorative</hi> is not only Traumatick, <hi>i. e.</hi> only to Heal and thereby to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the Mucous Glands in the Paſſage and the Womb-Veſſels, by gently ſtraitening them, and reducing them to their natural Tone, but alſo to deterge and cleanſe them of whatever Filth they may by their Weakneſs have contracted, never diſordering the Body, but keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in a due State. 'Tis not unpleaſant to take, &amp; being once received in a proper Vehicle as a Glaſs of Wine, Ale, Beer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into the Stomach, it (by means of the Bloods Circulation) diſplays its Vertues after a wonderful manner, effectually anſwering the intentions of Cure. Beſides all which it is a very great purifier &amp; ſweetner of the Blood and Juices, and thereby invigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates, enlivens, and ſtrengthens the whole Body, taking away Weakneſſes, and Pains in the Back, Loins, and elſewhere, rendring the Perſon brisk, lively, healthy, and ſtrong, and puts an end to thoſe troubleſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions commonly called <hi>Gleets,</hi> &amp; other ſuch Weakneſſes.</p>
            <p>So that to a Perſon even never ſo well in Health that ſhould take of it, it will cleanſe, ſweeten, and purifie the Blood, and thereby wonderfully enliven, animate, ſtrengthen, and invigorate the whole Conſtitution, but above all in a more particular manner then ordinary thoſe Parts which being hidden in the Body are too remote for any Manual Operation to act upon, as the Seminal &amp; Urinary Veſſels, the Proſtatae, Paraſtatae, and Mucous Glands in the Urethra. This Noble <hi>Medicine</hi> being to be taken by Drops may be carried in the Pocket, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as well abroad as at home, without any manner of uneaſineſs, trouble, ſuſpicion, or confinement, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample at the Tavern, Coffee-Houſe, or any other Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Place, by which means Gentlemen and others will be Cured in a manner inſenſibly and before they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt aware of it. Its Operation is principally by Urine,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1046500300:39"/>but nevertheleſs it will in moſt Conſtitutions ſo aſſiſt Nature as to promote the having one Stool in about 24 Hours. Nothing does exceed this admirable Remedy in the abovementioned Caſes, where either too much Purging has over relaxed and weakned the Tone of the Parts, or too free a uſe of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and other Pernici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous methods of Cure have been made Uſe of, reſtoring the Body to a due State of health and Strength.</p>
            <p>This Great <hi>Restorative</hi> in fine neat Bottles is Sealed up (with the Print of the Anodyne NECKLACE which the late Dr. <hi>Paul Chamberlen</hi> in his life time Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for Childrens TEETH ſo often abovemention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to diſtinguiſh it from any COUNTERFEIT) toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Printed Directions in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French</hi> for its Uſe, ſo clear, eaſy, full, and plain that Perſons may Cure themſelves with it in any remote Country, Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, Climate, or Part of the World, (for if well Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked it will not grow worſe with keeping) Price a Guinea.
