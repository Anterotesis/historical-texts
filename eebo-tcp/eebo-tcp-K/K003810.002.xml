            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head type="sub">TO MRS. ARNOLD.</head>
               <p>BY a line juſt received from Louiſa I am interdicted at preſent from writing to her, and the ſentiments which now oppreſs me are, indeed on <hi>all</hi> accounts improper to offer a mind pierced by ſo ſimilar a ſorrow. Yet, to reſtrain the whole dreadful weight in my own boſom would ſurely kill me. Do <hi>you</hi> then, O my dear couſin, my worthy Caroline, do <hi>you</hi> aſſiſt me.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0149005102:4"/>—Tell me, I conjure you, where the feeling heart ſhall find a ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary? Tell me, what foliage is thick and impenetrable enough to repel that terror which aſſails an unhappy wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, when the object of every hope and every fear is determined upon dangers the moſt complicated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive? Henry, your <hi>favourite</hi> Henry, is gone, you know, to defend his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, to ſignalize his bravery, and to ſerve his King, I admit the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of the enterprize, according to the laws of <hi>honour,</hi> but I weep at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of its horror when tried by the laws of <hi>feeling</hi> and <hi>humanity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The glowing arguments of that dear departed, I did not dare to oppoſe.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0149005102:5"/>
I faintly breathed the female reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. I feared, leſt my affection might ſeem to be ſelfiſh, by conteſting the point of ſeparation. I violated the ſoftneſs of my ſex, and the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my nature, to reſtrain the flowing tide that roſe in billows to my hearr, which laboured with the agony of ſuppreſſion. His being this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the ſea, eager to gain the ſeats of hoſtility, is a proof of it! Perhaps, I might have ſeduced him from this adventure, ſince humanity and love (oh, how oppoſite from ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage and war!) are the principles which figure faireſt in the ſpotleſs hiſtory of Henry's youth. But I dreaded the after operations of inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable honour, which might deteſt the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0149005102:6"/>
trembling hand that ſaved it from the ſword.</p>
               <p>Yet <hi>now</hi> my Caroline, <hi>now</hi> that he is far removed from the voice of my complainings, and can no longer be diſarmed by their ſweet oppreſſion, ſuffer, oh ſuffer me to mourn—ſuffer me to execrate that inſatiate and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>power,</hi> which ſcatters deſolation o'er the land! Ah this dire <hi>daemon</hi> of <hi>battle!</hi>—this <hi>daemon,</hi> who, with giant footſteps, tramples upon the beſt and moſt beautiful affections of the ſoul—who delights to hear the wail of the wounded, and the groans of the expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring—whoſe veſſels ſail upon a ſea of tears, and are waſted by ſighs which are extorted from the tender boſom.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0149005102:7"/>
I ſee, I ſee the ſanguinary power. He ſhoots athwart the realms of affrighted fancy, in a robe of crimſon, ten times dyed in the blood of his votaries. The ſoft verdure of the ſpring withers into the ſterility of winter as he advances. The ſtreams of plenty, which fertilized a happy world, ſtand checked in their progreſs, or roll onward a bed of troubled waters. Behold where the ruthleſs monarch approaches. The bounties and the beauties of nature fall before him. Territories are torn up by the roots, and empires mingle in the common ravage. Chained to his triumphal car—behold the lover, the orphan, the friend, the father, and the widow. Oh, Heavens! Fear, deſpair, and all the bleeding virtues,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0149005102:8"/>
and all the family of pain, form his retinue. Dreadful, dreadful proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion! And all for what?—for what, my Caroline? Wherefore is the peace of the world thus to be deſtroyed, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is man to raiſe his hand againſt the life of man, and deliberate mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be entitled to applauſe?</p>
               <p>Hear, O humanity, the reply, and be <hi>ſtill,</hi> if thou canſt! The rulers of different realms, in the wanton exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of power, infringe upon what is falſely called the property of each other. Men, who are utter ſtrangers to the very perſons of one another, and are ſeparated, perhaps, by parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a thouſand leagues, quarrel for a few vile acres of the dirt which
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0149005102:9"/>
ſhall preſently cover the toiling race; and the lives of a people are devoted to the ſword. Earth itſelf, wide as is extended her beautiful domain, is not <hi>enough</hi> extenſive for theſe pigmy mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals to divide amongſt themſelves; nor are the natural miſeries of a very ſhorn life, with all its moral, all its civil, all its ſocial evils, ſufficient, without the aids of untimely and <hi>voluntary</hi> ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The hurry of the ſcene, the din of the battle, and that political muſic which drowns the cry of diſtreſs, may <hi>paſs over</hi> theſe ſentiments, and huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity will not have time to hear, nor to be heard. But in the quieter moment, when the <hi>gentle</hi> power reviſits the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, and reſumes the lovely throne from whence ſhe has been driven, oh
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0149005102:10"/>
how impious, and how contemptible, will appear thoſe bickerings, which terminate in the effuſion of human blood! And could theſe heroes enter coolly into the <hi>conſequence</hi> of this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous practice: this practice of defa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing and hacking away the expreſs image of their God, to aſcertain privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, in a world which was made for the reception and accommodation, the peace and the pleaſure, of <hi>all</hi> mankind—could they be ſpectators of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity which equally attends the ſhout of victory and the ſhriek of defeat— could they behold the inconſolable wife ſink upon her widowed bed, and the child, ſtretching forth its little hands in vain to greet a returning fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—a father, left naked, mangled,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0149005102:11"/>
and unburied upon a foreign and an inhoſpitable ſhore—would not the touch of human pity aſſert its ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening preſſure, and all agree to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the bleſſings of univerſal bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood?</p>
               <p>How many wretches, forlorn and fallen, are at this inſtant pining away on the ſorrow-ſteeped couch, while the heedleſs multitude echo the prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of one who has earned a laurel at the expence of adding acres to his King, and anguiſh to his country-women? I am no politician, Mrs. Arnold, I am a human being. I am a chriſtian. I am one who proſeſs to adore a religion of peace—one too, who can never be perſuaded that the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0149005102:12"/>
cherub countenance of man—the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs image of the deity, is created thus fair, and thus amiable, to be cruelly ſported away in the riots of ambition, pride, and folly.</p>
               <p>Ah my dear Henry! alive as thou art to all that is moſt endearing, what will be <hi>thy</hi> ſenſations <hi>after</hi> the bloody affray! Thou, whoſe boſom is gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler than the mildeſt and kindlieſt bree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes of the ſpring!—what wilt <hi>thou</hi> feel, ſhould ſome hapleſs woman, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by all her little orphans, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, of thy victorious hand, the ſlaughtered huſband, and the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered ſire? Or ſhould but thy <hi>fancy</hi> ſuggeſt ſuch a groupe, ruſhing through the ranks, and in piercing tones of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0149005102:13"/>
agony exclaiming— <hi>"reſtore, reſtore</hi> them to me,"—how would'ſt thou ſupport it? Thou, Hammond, whom the female ſigh, the female tear, the female ſhriek, would at any time penetrate to the ſoul!—</p>
               <p>On the other hand (and the chance alas, is equal) ſhould it be <hi>thy</hi> fate to fall—oh thou deareſt, beſt-beloved, and moſt <hi>worthy</hi> to be ſo—ſhould the malignant ſtar, that influences, full often, the hero's fortunes—ſhould it ordain that—</p>
               <p>O Caroline, Caroline, I congeal with horror. I can derive no laſting ſerenity from the pious example of the reſigned Louiſa. I rage, I rave. I
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0149005102:14"/>
cannot bear it. Indeed I cannot! Hope, duty, religion, are inſufficient. I ſhall be detected in the deepeſt exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of my ſorrow.—The tears are deluging my paper. My ſenſes ſeem to turn—I am bowed to the earth—I am—Oh how ſhall I conceal what I am?—How diſguiſe the horrors which preſs down the ſpirit of the moſt afflicted</p>

               <p>MY fair pupil makes a ſurpriſing progreſs in her new ſtudies; and were not her heart too ſoft to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the pain occaſioned by her hand, ſhe would, in a little time, perform her amputation, and dreſs her wound with the beſt of us.</p>
               <p>She ſeeks this barren novelty of knowledge by way of ſolace: yet it affords her little; for, through all her efforts to amuſe and to diſguiſe, I can ſee her diſtreſs. Ah Frederick, that it was permitted me to relieve that diſtreſs! Yet if <hi>Henry</hi>'s image ſtill exiſts in her boſom—and, oh!
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0149005102:16"/>
how likely that it ſhould!—it would be the very <hi>phrenzy</hi> of hope to expect ſucceſs on my part. Would I had continued in India! Fortune has been extremely perverſe. The gaiety of my character is paſſing away. Every pleaſant habit is dropping from me, and the peace of my ſoul is about to take flight. Can a virtuous paſſion produce theſe revolutions? Yes, Frederick, nothing <hi>but</hi> a virtuous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion <hi>can</hi> produce them. It is a <hi>chaſte affection,</hi> and will, depend upon it, be one way or another, rewarded.

I want words to tell you how I am touched by thoſe exertions you have made to acquire a conqueſt of reaſon over paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and though I have ſometimes detected the tear upon your cheek, and felt the breath of your ſigh as it broke, by ſtealth, from your boſom; yet—In ſhort my ſweet girl, it ſeems now to be a proper criſis to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the hopes, anxieties, and expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0149005102:19"/>
of my heart. O! I have ſome important ſecrets to diſcloſe! yet I tremble to begin. Wherefore <hi>ſhould</hi> I tremble? You are delicate and obliging. Ere I quit this ſublunary ſcene, I have <hi>two</hi> great ends to wiſh accompliſhed; and after that, wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moment which ſhall re-unite me to the cherub who was once your mother, and who gave to me my NOW only child—who gave the pledge of her fidelity to theſe paternal arms, in this very room:—for <hi>here</hi> was Emma born, and here is the proper place, to date an addreſs which intreats her to make her birth a bleſſing to me.—<hi>When</hi> and <hi>where,</hi> then, ſhall an aged father whiſper his wiſhes to a daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?—O let the reciprocal duties be

The Times are greatly changed, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire great innovations of conduct. New modes of duty ſpring from new circumſtances.

               <p>O My father, why this unneceſſary preparation, this awful cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony? Why the formal interview ſo ſolemnly announced?—announced too by a <hi>letter,</hi> written under the ſame roof!

               <p>I AM ſuddenly ſummoned into my father's apartment. He is not there, but I attend his coming. In aſcending the ſtairs, I trembled at every ſtep. In this very room I was born.

                  <salute>MY DEAR COUSIN,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IT is with great willingneſs I ſit down to make a reply to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter you addreſſed to me; but it is not without much concern that I find it neceſſary to uſe the pen in anſwer to thoſe which you addreſſed to Louiſa, whoſe preſent ſtate of health is ſuch as to prevent her writing. Anxious, however, even as ſhe preſſes the pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low of ſickneſs, to alleviate the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of her beloved Emma (in regard to the promiſed articles of confidence) ſhe inſtructs me to acquaint you in the conciſeſt way that I am able, of the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0149005102:27"/>
means by which ſhe became the wife of your unfortunate brother, as well as with the reaſons which prevailed with her to keep that union a ſecret from <hi>his</hi> family, from her <hi>own,</hi> and from the <hi>world.</hi> She conceives too, that the deeper colours of diſtreſs in <hi>her</hi> fate, may by compariſon, alleviate the ſofter tints of wretchedneſs in <hi>yours;</hi> for at the worſt, my dear cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin, as matters now ſtand, you have a lover living who is very properly the, object of many a charming hope; while the poor Louiſa is daily tortured with reflecting on the death of one yet dearer than a lover—even a huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band and a father, who is the object of many a miſery too mighty for the ſolace of ſighs and tears.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0149005102:28"/>With reſpect to the letter I have had the pleaſure to receive from you, it beſpeaks a heart overflowing with ſtreams of genuine philanthropy, and beautifully becomes the pen of Emma Corbett. But believe me, believe a woman who has been connected from her infancy with men devoted to the trade of arms—believe the daughter of a veteran chief, and the widow of one who felt the military paſſion in all its force—believe <hi>her</hi> when ſhe tells you, that ſuch gentle arguments are never of the leaſt conſequence in the eyes, or on the minds of a ſoldier. They ſerve only to make female weakneſs the more pitied by the men, who think the dignity of a more reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved courage <hi>concerned</hi> to ſhew itſelf in
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0149005102:29"/>
                  <hi>contraſt.</hi> Sometimes, it is true, the tears of a wife will excite the manly drop in the eye of a huſband; but it tarries not. The voice of public fame is, on theſe occaſions, louder than that of private affection. The world fixes an earneſt look on the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of an officer. One hero in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flames another: the ſparks of glory paſs like an electric power: the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of a brave <hi>example</hi> becomes appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent: the profeſſion ſoon grows into a darling paſſion. The blood warms: the genius of war takes poſſeſſion of every faculty: home-connexions are forgotten: the ſcene of action ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minates the proſpect: the warrior can ſee no farther. Valour and victory ſeem marching before him. There is
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0149005102:30"/>
not leiſure for a private emotion, and tenderneſs would aſſiſt the efforts of his foe. He gives himſelf up, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, nobly, and abſolutely, to the battle; wounds can make no impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon him in the progreſs of his ardent career; and death itſelf is, in that moment, leſs terrible than defeat.</p>
               <p>Theſe, my lovely couſin, are not the ſentiments of a theoriſt, but caught immediately from the lips of the very heroes who practiſed every action they relate. In the period of peace, few men of any order have a more elegant humanity than the Engliſh officers; and all the endearing qualifications, which make up the great domeſtic characters, are to be found amongſt
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0149005102:31"/>
them; but in the day of conteſt, my couſin, a different duty calls upon them, and military fame is as eaſily wounded, and its wounds as vital to felicity, as thoſe of a woman.</p>
               <p>Let not your glowing pencil paint the protectors of our country as beings deſtitute of every tender feeling, but allow for their ſituation, which ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times renders incompatible the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate union of love and glory: or the duties of peace with the duties of war.</p>
               <p>While I cloſe this ſentence, Louiſa expreſſes a wiſh to write to you <hi>her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> To-morrow ſhe imagines that ſhe ſhall be equal to the taſk, and ſhe
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0149005102:32"/>
aſſures me that nothing which relates to the hiſtory of <hi>her</hi> huſband and <hi>your</hi> brother, can come ſo properly from any pen as her own. In the hope of her gaining ſtrength for the friendly effort, I will fold up my letter, and bid you farewell.</p>

                              <p>OH for the hiſtory of that wound! ſaid I; ſeeing a ſcar upon the cheek of the perſon ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to ſhew me the hoſpital!—Oh for the hiſtory of that wound!</p>
                              <p>Not worth the telling, anſwered the man, pointing to the ſtump of his left thigh, as to a more important ſubject of curioſity. He took me into a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent quarter of the building, which preſented the lodgings of thoſe who were penſioners. In each was a ſmall-bed,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0149005102:38"/>
bed, a chair, and a table. The atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant's name was Julius Carbine. At a door leading into one of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments he ſtopped; and then looked through an aperture, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the room.</p>
                              <p>The luckieſt of all moments, ſaid Julius—for brother Neſtor will ſoon be at it, and it is a day of diſcipline. We will enter.</p>
                              <p>Julius, ſaid the owner of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as we entered, ſit down with your company. The ſide of the bed was covered with a clean white cloth by a little girl who opened the door, and I had alſo a little girl with me, and we all ſat down. It was actually
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0149005102:39"/>
the <hi>brother,</hi> and not the brother <hi>ſoldier</hi> only, to whom Julius introduced us. In their appearance there was a frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſimilarity, not ſo much conſiſting in the features and limbs which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained, as in the misfortunes which had happened to thoſe inviſible parts which lay ſcattered in different quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the globe.</p>
                              <p>Julius was the younger of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bines, and as he placed himſelf <hi>ſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> upon the bed, and deſired Carbine the elder (whoſe name was Neſtor) to ſuſpend the attack—he told his ſtory.</p>
                              <p>We ſlept in the ſame cradle, and were nurſed up for the ſervice. Our little arms—</p>
                              <p>
                                 <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0149005102:40"/>He flouriſhed a ſtump which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected about four inches from the right ſhoulder—Our little arms—</p>
                              <p>But I have begun the matter wrong and prematurely, for before I relate the account which Carbine gave of himſelf, I ſhould offer ſome deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of his perſon, as well as that of his brother Neſtor. It is the ſtump of Julius which reminds me of this.</p>
                              <p>Carbine the elder was the remnant of a noble figure, who in the upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his youth muſt have riſen ſix feet from the earth perpendicularly. He had the marks of about ſeventy years wearing in his face—allowing for the natural vigour of his form, the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0149005102:41"/>
invaſions of incident, time, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. The preſent ſtoop in his ſhoulders was favourable to the height, or rather to the want of height in his apartment. It is not without juſt cauſe that I called Neſtor a <hi>rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant.</hi> Nature originally mixed up in him her faireſt proportions. At the time I ſaw him he was a capital figure reduced. For inſtance, if you looked him in the face, or, more properly to ſpeak, in the reſidue of his face, you would perceive, in his left cheek, a deep ſcarification, which boaſted no ſort of rivalſhip with the glorious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>browning of the other that had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no injury. Though Neſtor himſelf ſaid, "the whole cheek, in compariſon with the half cheek,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0149005102:42"/>
looked like an errant poltroon." "It is a cheek," cried he, "which ſeems to have done no duty; now here," continued he, turning the other ſide to view with much triumph, "here are the ſigns of ſervice."</p>
                              <p>Both the Carbines, indeed, had <hi>ſerved</hi> to ſome purpoſe. In point of honorary credentials there was little cauſe of jealouſy. Nothing could be more equally divided than the mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual marks of brotherhood in bravery. Sorely battered were the outworks of both. It is worth while to obſerve how the matter was ſettled to their ſatisfaction and credit. The thigh of Julius became the victim of a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, but then Neſtor was even with
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0149005102:43"/>
him when he had the honour to drop his left arm in the counterſcarp. But as if fortune did not imagine an arm, and that a <hi>left</hi> arm, a ſufficient equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent to a whole thigh, amputated at one deciſive whizz by a cannon ball, ſhe deprived Neſtor of his right foot, which was left at the bottom of an entrenchment in Flanders. The younger Carbine had the track of a muſquet viſible at the extremity of his neck, and the bullets with which that muſquet was charged ſlanted along the left jaw, carrying off ſome of the fineſt teeth in the world, and which, perhaps, are even yet to be ſeen in one of the foſſés. To bring the military ſcale even, on the part of Julius, he has the good fortune to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0149005102:44"/>
conceal under his hat (which upon account of that concealment he ſeldom wears) a reſpectable confuſion, which; beginning at the left ear, ſwept away not only the greateſt part of that, but all that grew in its path, from one end to the other; which diſtinguiſhing ſtroke is in honour of the baſtion. But Julius had his <hi>unoſtentatious</hi> wounds too: his ſhirt covering no leſs than ſix, inſomuch that his boſom was croſſed this way and that, direct and tranſverſe, like a draught-board. I detected the fluſh of ſomething like victory in the countenance of Julius, as he threw open his chitterlin, and opened his ſhirt-collar under pretence of too much heat: but Carbine the elder checked his brother's ambition
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0149005102:45"/>
by baring his right arm to his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, (or rather begging <hi>me</hi> to bare it) and there diſcovering a maſked battery of blows, which were a fair match for thoſe in the breaſt of Julius.</p>
                              <p>Thus were the teſtimonies of their proweſs participated; and if (ſaid they) either of us could have boaſted a leſs equal diviſion, it would have been a blow too many for our friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and, perhaps, have bred ill blood betwixt us.</p>
                              <div type="part">

                                 <p>They entered the Temple of Peace: but not quite on the footing of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary members. The ſenior Carbine privately enjoyed ſome ſmall privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, and the junior was in poſſeſſion of the caſualties, derivable from ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the hoſpital to ſuch as had the curioſity to ſurvey it: and he hopped about with his <hi>ruins</hi> in a manner that engaged one's pity and admiration.</p>

                                    <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0149005102:47"/>Now Neſtor was a man of inali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enable affections. They were not to be ſubdued. The military paſſion was by no means dead in his boſom. The heart of the ſoldier was ſtill viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in his little bed-chamber. There were to be ſeen, ſuſpended from the walls, the battered corſlet that had co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his breaſt, and the firelock, whoſe iron mouth was almoſt worn out by the loadings. They were brightly burniſhed, and the niceſt care taken to clean them weekly.</p>
                                 <p>But this was nothing. The practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal part of a ſoldier's diſcipline did
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0149005102:48"/>
Neſtor carry on in a room of forty inches diameter.</p>
                                 <p>No ſooner were we all ſeated by the ſide of the bed, than a ſingular cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony began. He had ſix ſons, all little, all living for their country, and in ſecret training for the battle under their father. It was his cuſtom, thrice in the week, to turn the key upon all the penſioners but his brother, and inſtruct his family in the art of war. Poor as he was, he had actually been at the coſt of equipping them; had fitted up for them ſomething that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled a uniform, and, in miniature accoutrements, preſented them with the ſword, the muſquet, and the bayonet.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0149005102:49"/>The ſoldier's ſcience was taught them by the veteran. One branch or another of the art military was the ſubject of every day. The ſons of Neſtor Carbine knew not the enerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting luxuries of artificial heat: they thawed the ſeverity of the ſeaſons with nobler fires. Their education was wholly martial. At night they liſtened to the lecture, and their ſwords were drawn forth to practice what they had heard in the morn. They engaged their ſtrengthening arms in the <hi>mock</hi> fight, that they might be prepared for the <hi>real</hi> one. It was now the evening of the ravelin, then of the flanking; now of the fortification, then of the foſſé now of the half-moon, then of the epaulement; now of the ſaps, and

                                 <p>They had juſt began an engage ment as we entered the room.</p>
                                 <p>It will be beſt related before the younger Carbine tells his ſtory. Let him therefore repoſe a little longer upon the bed.</p>
                                 <p>The ſtripling troops were drawn up three deep in the center of the room, and the object of attack was a large deal trunk ſet upright betwixt the contending parties. One ſide were to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0149005102:51"/>
oppoſe and one to defend. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was commander, and in good time came the brother, who inſtead of repoſing on the bed as above-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, ſprung up with ſurprizing agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and hopped away to head the adverſe party, making a kind of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like muſic with a little drum tattoo'd by the timber inſtrument that ſerved him for an arm. Neſtor, meantime, aſſumed a whiſtle which ſerved for a clarionet.</p>
                                 <p>The engagement was carried on in the exacteſt military order; they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, they retreated, they rallied, and they came on again. Every little heart panted with ambition, every eye ſparkled with expectation of victory.
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0149005102:52"/>
The mimic ardour ſoon became real, and the two generals were themſelves wrought up into a ſerious ſenſation. Julius ſhouted, and Neſtor encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged. But, preſently, the aſpect of the battle altered, for one of the <hi>beſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,</hi> (a boy of uncommon bravery) took one of the <hi>beſieged</hi> priſoner. The conqueror flouriſhed his little foil, but the captive ſhed tears of ſlavery and ſorrow. The general on the worſted ſide affected to be diſmayed. His opponent, ſpirited up his army, purſued his victory, took a <hi>ſecond</hi> of the enemy priſoner, and the town (that is, the <hi>box</hi>) was taken.</p>
                                 <p>A ſhout of joy was heard on one ſide, while the poor remains of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0149005102:53"/>
conquered troops fled to a corner that was the interior encampment behind the bed. Julius beat the dead march with his wooden drumſtick: but Neſtor and his troops, having burſt the city gates, (that is, the box <hi>lid</hi>) proceeded to plunder. It contained all the magazines of the enemy, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of new foils, martial caps, belts, wooden bayonets, confections and fruits. Theſe were the prizes of conqueſt. They were all fairly won, and divided amongſt the victors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ſeniority. The little girl, who had ſat on the bed, now ſprung up, took a ſmall ozier baſket from a hook, and ſtrewed flowers in the path of the victorious, ſinging a ſong of triumph as they marched round the
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0149005102:54"/>
room. The ceremonies, however, being over, both parties came for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and ſhook hands very heartily in token of good will, and then the affair ended with <q>God ſave great George our King</q> and a general huzza.</p>

                                    <hi>He</hi> triumphed in the firſt teſtimony of the warrior.</p>
                                 <p>I am an elder brother, ſaid Neſtor, and the firſt blow was my birth-right.</p>
                                 <p>But I was ſoon even with him: for, towards the cloſe of the campaign, a random ſhot—when I was thinking of nothing leſs, gave the four fingers of my left hand to the enemy. In that condition we entered into winter quarters.</p>
                                 <p>But no ſooner was my brother cured of the wound in his face—</p>
                                 <p>You may ſee the mark of it here, ſir, ſaid Neſtor.</p>

                                 <p>Give me thy hand, Ferdinand, ſaid Neſtor; and, brother, do you go on with your ſtory, for it entertains the gentleman and his little daughter, and I like to hear it. You were always good at a ſtory from a child. Go on.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0149005102:62"/>—would you believe it ſir, that a fellow ſo ſliced ſhould have the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudence to attack one of the prettieſt girls in England?</p>

                                 <p>—like a brave boy of the blade, he puſhed his point right on, turned his <hi>worſt</hi> ſide to the wench, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon her taking the ſcars as a recommendation.</p>
                                 <p>Why they <hi>were</hi> ſo, ſaid Neſtor, holding his knee ſtill while he ſpoke.</p>
                                 <p>—in this manner he continued to batter the citadel which trembled
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0149005102:63"/>
in the boſom of the poor girl, and in leſs than a month (no time at all for ſuch a ſiege) he entered the fair caſtle of her affections in triumph.</p>
                                 <p>By the blood that I have ſhed, ſir, ſaid Neſtor, and by the drops which <hi>yet</hi> flow in my body, Frances was the beſt and braveſt wench that ever lay by the ſide of a ſoldier.</p>
                                 <p>Neſtor, ſaid Julius, hold your tongue.—His limbs, ſir, were almoſt conſtantly on the move. War carried them away. What of that? His joke was ready. Never mind, Frances, (would he ſay to his wife) I am the winner yet. Fear nothing. Were I reduced to my trunk, I ſhould flouriſh
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0149005102:64"/>
ſtill, my girl. A ſoldier, whoſe chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have blood in their veins, is invul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable. He is immortal in his ſons.</p>
                                 <p>Let us <hi>engage,</hi> father! ſaid one of the boys eagerly, as he brandiſhed his ſoil.</p>
                                 <p>Thus would my brother heal up the wounds of the war: but be that as it may, wounds are but ſorry things in a family. Often has my brother diſputed with me on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. "Julius, (would he ſay) thou art but half a loyal ſubject ſtill—<hi>thou</hi> giveſt to thy country the ſervices only of an individual, while <hi>I</hi> furniſh it with the force of a whole family. As an <hi>individual,</hi> thou muſt ſoon die; but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0149005102:65"/>
hadſt thou taken care to <hi>multiply</hi> thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as I have done, thou mighteſt well expect to live and conquer theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years. Brother, brother, it is a falſe notion; a ſoldier ought of all men in his Majeſty's dominions the ſooneſt to marry: he ought indeed." Notwithstanding this, ſir, I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be prevailed upon. No, though an honeſt girl offered to ſling my knapſack acroſs her ſhoulder after the loſs of my thigh. To confeſs the plain truth to you, I did not like cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta
in ceremonies betwixt my brother and ſiſter, at their partings. Frances indeed wept but little, but in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſhe <hi>looked</hi> a much deeper ſorrow than is to be expreſſed by a pair of wet eyes.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0149005102:66"/>Neſtor hemm'd violently.</p>
                                 <p>And as to my brother, though he cocked his hat fiercely—pretended to have caught cold—rubbed up his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coutrements, and bluſtered mightily, he never was ſteadily himſelf—and how the devil <hi>ſhould</hi> he be— for a week after. Theſe things, ſir, are againſt the grain. The bruſh of a bullet is nothing at all: it may take off your head, or it may only take off your hat: either way, no great matter—but the cries of a woman—the piercing ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies of a wife to come acroſs one's thoughts in the laſt moments—no, ſir,— no, damn it—there is no bearing that— I will live and die a batchelor!</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="69" facs="tcp:0149005102:67"/>But this is not the worſt, ſir. <hi>Death</hi> ſometimes comes at the bottom of the account to <hi>unſoldier</hi> a man. He knocked at brother Neſtor's door, and carried Frances away while ſhe was nurſing him of a fever into which he was thrown by the pain of a wound. Zounds! that was a terrible day, Neſtor, was it not?</p>
                                 <p>Terrible! ſaid Neſtor, turning his head from the company.</p>
                                 <p>She died ſuddenly. Courage, ſaid I, brother. He waved his hand and ſpoke not. Brother, ſaid I, have cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage. "Fool, replied he, in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion—(if he had called me ſo in cold blood, I would have had him out)—
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0149005102:68"/>
Fool, ſaid he, (in a way that one could not but forgive him, ſtamping his foot on the ground at the ſame time) am I, thinkeſt thou, before GOD ALMIGHTY or the enemy? What has courage to do before HIM? thou ſhould'ſt tell me to be <hi>patient.</hi> I ſaid no more: for the poor Frances lay dead before his eyes; and there being but one bed of any ſize, the living and the dead lay together.</p>
                                 <p>Child, (ſaid Neſtor to the little girl, his daughter, who was ſobbing at the ſide of the bed, with her apron thrown over her eyes)—come hither. Thou art <hi>like</hi> thy mother—kiſs me.</p>
                                 <p>Neſtor (continued Julius) tied the crape round his arm, and his ſoul was
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0149005102:69"/>
in mourning. He gave Frances to the earth. Decency—</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <hi>Go no farther,</hi> ſaid Neſtor.</p>
                                 <p>—Decency required <hi>my</hi> atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, ſir. My poor Carbine ſhed then the firſt tears that I ever ſaw upon his cheek. Oh! he was melted down into ſomething ſofter than his mother. He wanted to prevent the man from ſtriking the nails into the coffin.—</p>
                                 <p>Julius, GO NO FARTHER, I ſay, (cried Neſtor) preſſing his daughter cloſe to his breaſt.</p>
                                 <p>I wiſh my uncle would hold his tongue, ſaid one of the boys.</p>

He drew his hand gently over the cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin as the ſexton was beginning to lower it. He kneeled down to ſee that it was put <hi>ſoftly</hi> into the ground. He let it go, and ſaid he was perfectly reſigned; then came away, and then returned, then went off a ſecond time, and ſought the grave again, wringing his hand, and declaring he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly reſigned all the time—</p>
                                 <p>Wilt <hi>kill</hi> me, Julius? ſaid Neſtor; ſtop, I ſay!</p>
                                 <p>—in ſhort ſir, he—he—he—did ſo many things upon that occaſion,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0149005102:71"/>
that; ſurely, if a man has any love for a woman, he ought to be a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chelor.</p>

                                 <p>after the engagement, the ſolemn thoughts again came on. Julius rubbed his face twice or thrice along the pillow, and declared that while the wind continued in that quarter, his old achs would twinge him a little.</p>
                                 <p>

                                 <p>He rubbed his face again upon the pillow. Well, ſaid he riſing, every dog has his day!</p>
                                 <p>Upon this Neſtor began to whiſtle:—not one of thoſe tunes, which ariſe from vacancy, but a whiſtle truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative; it was more ſlow and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive as he proceeded, and in its cloſing cadence, a tear ſtarted from his eye. Streaming almoſt to the borders of the upper lip, it ſettled there, and though as he waved his head back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards, it trembled upon the edge of his cheek, it did not fall.</p>
                                 <p>
                                    <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0149005102:73"/>When he had opened the door, I ſtole an Opportunity to put ſomething into his hand.</p>

                                 <p>His daughter's hand was ſtill cloſed in his; but ſhe looked at the tear, and was taking out her handkerchief.</p>

               <p>I KNOW not whether I ſhall live long enough to relate the horrors of my ſituation!</p>
               <p>On the evening of the day that I deſired the ſuſpenſion, I felt an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe, more ſtrong and more ſacred than that of common curioſity, to know the full ſcope of my ſuſpicions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Before</hi> this interview, my diſtreſs ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſufficiently great. Alas! we are continually exclaiming that the heart will break, without knowing what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional burthens it will bear, even when we think it is <hi>moſt</hi> ſurcharged.</p>

                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0149005102:80"/>Come hither, dear Emma, ſaid my father—drawing me gently to him—his hand trembling as he touched my gown.</p>
               <p>—Come hither, I want to thank you for the long ſeries of ſoft compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, which your dutiful heart hath poured into this aged boſom. <hi>But</hi> for thee, my child, your unfortunate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would have no pillow to ſupport him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Unfortunate,</hi> ſir, did you ſay?</p>
               <p>O <hi>moſt</hi> unfortunate, my Emma! I am in diſtreſs—<hi>worldly</hi> diſtreſs. And it is ſo extreme, that I have been compelled (ah, hard neceſſity!) to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0149005102:81"/>
of this fair manſion, which hath more than a century owned a Corbett for its Lord. This very room, my dear, which gave—oh ſpare me, Emma—this very room, the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crated ſpot of <hi>thy nativity,</hi> is now another's; and ſo are the late heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary lands that ſmile around it. The ruin has been <hi>deliberate</hi> too; and I have concealed it from every eye, even (and indeed chiefly) from <hi>thine,</hi> till now, that I am in the <hi>arms of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty.</hi> There is, at this moment, an execution entering my houſe in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don; which contains the laſt reliques of a fortune, that, ſome years ſince, amounted to an hundred thouſand pounds.</p>

               <p>Here it begins, my child!—but where will it cloſe? Oh ſlavery—oh impriſonment! how terrible are thy horrid walls and galling fetters to <hi>one</hi> whoſe boſom burns with the divine flame of liberty!—how inſupportable to an old man!—to a father, whoſe daughter's <hi>conſequence</hi> in life muſt flow from <hi>his.</hi>

               <p>Oh, Emma! bred up to elevated expectations, what is to become of thee? Your brother is ſlain. Your father old and enervated, a prey to pain of body from the moſt piercing of human diſorders, and to anguiſh of mind, from reflections the moſt cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.

Your property both at home and abroad (for mine was naturally your's) loſt or deſpoiled!</p>
               <p>Oh, Emma! what is to become of thee? Would you renovate my youth—would you rebuild your for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes?—</p>
               <p>I could not ſpeak, Louiſa.</p>
               <p>If you <hi>would,</hi> continued my father, receive with a ſmile thoſe accents which inform you, there is a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man—rich, generous, virtuous, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, and of whom you have a good opinion—a gentleman who would eſteem the <hi>hand of Emma</hi>—</p>

               <p>NO, my loved ſiſter, I will not, cannot, ſend a long ſtory. A few pages will compriſe the main circumſtances; and let thoſe ſuffice till days of future converſation. Your father had ever an ambition to enlarge the fortune of his Edward by marriage: and Edward had already ſufficient to his wiſhes. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted his father of the love which he bore to Louiſa. It produced a diſpute. My brother happened to be preſent. He entered, as your father exclaimed, "What but beggary can be expected with a girl like Louiſa
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0149005102:87"/>
Hammond, of ſcarce an hundred pounds a year!"—The converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtopped.</p>
               <p>Sir, (ſaid Henry to Edward, when they were alone) had any man living but Emma's father ſpoke in thoſe terms of my ſiſter, he ſhould have been puniſhed for it ſeverely.—I love <hi>Emma Corbett,</hi> and to her he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for—</p>
               <p>And I love <hi>Louiſa Hammond,</hi> ſir, (replied your brother) but my father has an arm of his own, and that fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he has that of a <hi>ſon,</hi> to defend him from the inſults of a boy, ſhould he <hi>dare</hi> to—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0149005102:88"/>It is an improper place to diſcuſs the queſtion, ſaid Henry. They went out. Henry commanded Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, in terms of intolerable ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, never to offer his hand to Louiſa, while Edward inſiſted, that Henry ſhould deſiſt from farther engaging the affections of Emma. The inhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition was promiſed to be obſerved, and a breach of it was to terminate in the laſt frightful deciſion amongſt men. Edward ceaſed his viſits, and I knew not the cauſe. Henry did the ſame, and you was equally ignorant of the motive. I fell ſick; a fever ſeized my ſpirits, and my life was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaired of. Edward heard of my ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and came to viſit me at a time that he knew Henry was from home.
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0149005102:89"/>
He found me in the extremity—the fever was become putrid, and the phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician ordered no one to approach my breath any nearer than could be avoided; the bed was ſtrewed with the herbs which are ſuppoſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent infection. Regardleſs of this, and every other image of ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, Edward ruſhed into my cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, threw himſelf upon his knees by the ſide of the bed, and hung his head over my face, which received and welcomed the tender tears that were ſtreaming from his eyes. O! Louiſa, Louiſa, (ſaid he) I can bear it no longer! At theſe words Henry was heard upon the ſtairs, Edward leaped up—Heavens! ſaid he, can it be poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, is Henry returned! Well, it is
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0149005102:90"/>
no matter. My brother entered the room, and at the ſight of Edward ſtept back, like a man aſtoniſhed. Edward ran up to him, threw his arms about his neck, and inſiſted that the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace ſhould be returned. Oh Henry, he exclaimed, too long have we mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſuffered a falſe delicacy to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail. Enough have we ſacrificed to pique, for Emma and Louiſa have been the victims. I heard that your ſiſter was dying, and I could not deny myſelf the mournful privilege of a friend—will you chide me for it Henry?—will you ſtill withhold your hand and your heart from the brother of Emma Corbett? <hi>Will you?</hi> This was the firſt moment I had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the diſpute. The ſurpriſe
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0149005102:91"/>
was too much for me in the <hi>firmeſt</hi> ſtate of my conſtitution. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition I <hi>then</hi> was, it had well-nigh proved fatal. All which my ſtrength ſuffered me to do was to raiſe myſelf on my pillow, fold my hands in the attitude of intreaty, and with feeble accents to implore, they would ſpare my laſt moments, and not embitter them by <hi>their</hi> enmity.</p>
               <p>Ere I had uttered this, Henry and Edward were weeping on the necks of each other, and Henry ſaid, alas! Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, I <hi>owe</hi> you more than this, for on my part was the promiſe firſt bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. I have ſecretly maintained the uſual correſpondence with Emma, ſince ſhe has been away: and found
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0149005102:92"/>
the <hi>tenderneſs</hi> ſuperior to the <hi>anger</hi> of my temper. Indeed we have <hi>both</hi> been wrong. Henceforward, let us be <hi>more</hi> than friends—if poſſible, let us be brothers. Shall we not my Edward?</p>
               <p>Again Emma I claſped my hands, and a ſudden ſenſe of joy came over me that gave a turn—a <hi>happy</hi> turn to my diſorder. I recovered. It was agreed between us that the <hi>cauſe of the quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel,</hi> and the means of t
he reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhould be equally a ſecret. The families were re-united, and none but Edward, Henry, and Louiſa, could account for the late coolneſs on the part of the two former. But the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony was not of long duration;—
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0149005102:93"/>
it was again interrupted by your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's violence in the cauſe of <hi>America,</hi> oppoſed to that of my brother in the cauſe of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> Edward ſided with the former, and, though it no longer prevented an intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, it threatened an eternal ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of political intereſts. At the ſame time Henry was permitted to addreſs you, and Edward conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued openly his partiality for me. Nay, your father at laſt declared, he hoped ſtill to ſee two countries reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the embraces of each other, and two happy matches to felicitate their union. You were, my dear Emma, fortunately from home on a viſit during moſt of theſe tranſactions, and your Henry did not think it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0149005102:94"/>
to break the thread of an elegant affection by the little jarrings that were happening to croſs it at home. The conteſt now became fierce on the other ſide the Atlantic, and threatened to carry bloadſhed and rapine to that part of the continent where Edward had property. Louiſa, (ſaid he to me, one evening) I muſt croſs the ſeas: my fortune is in danger: it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns equally you and me, that I ſhould endeavour to deſend it, yet I will wait another month to hear the event of terms that are propoſing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the countries—if they produce <hi>peace,</hi> you know how ready I ſhall be to continue in England; if they <hi>fail</hi> of that end, you muſt have reſolution enough to part from me for a ſhort
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0149005102:95"/>
ſeaſon. But, continued he, as no man can tell the chances of the ſlighteſt ſeparation, I ardently wiſh to call you by the tendereſt of all human titles, <hi>mine,</hi> before I go. <hi>Publickly</hi> this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done, for though my father affects to conſent, our union would make himun happy. No, Louiſa: let our happineſs be known only to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves till it is proper to communicate ir. Impart it nor, till my return at leaſt, to Emma, to Henry, or to any part of the family. I have my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for it, even more ſtrong than thoſe that have been already related.</p>
               <p>Soon after this converſation, Emma, we were privately married, and none of the appointments that led to the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0149005102:96"/>
ceremony, or which ſucceeded it, were diſcovered or ſuſpected. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the voyage of my hapleſs huſband, he put into my hand a ſealed paper, containing his will, and he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired I would not open it till his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. In the fond hope of that return being poſſible, I have, till within theſe few days, kept the ſeal unbroken, and now, alas! I find it is a teſtamentary diſpoſal of his property abroad, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed entirely to me as ſole exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutrix.—</p>
               <p>Yes, my dear Emma, there <hi>is</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs Edward, and Heaven only knows whether the father had any knowledge of its birth before he died. I repeatedly ſent letters, full of all a
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0149005102:97"/>
mother's minute and affecting ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, but I received no replies. To Mrs. Arnold, dear and generous friend as ſhe is, I owe the power of keeping my huſband's ſecret, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding an event that promiſed to betray it. The poor little one was lately taken ill, and his death every moment expected. It was that (oh Nature!) made me write the diſordered ſcrawl, which intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Emma to forbear her viſit. On my reaching the houſe of our wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Caroline, I found the cold hand of death lay heavy on my child. I wept ſore. I offered up the prayer of the deſolate widow, not <hi>wholly</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reave me; and begged (ah how ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly)
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0149005102:98"/>
the Bleſſed God to reſtore <hi>one</hi> or receive <hi>both!</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My prayer was heard. My child grew well. Your letter came in the warmeſt, neweſt, and moſt melting moment of matron extacy. The ſmile of the babe was in my eye, and in my heart. I ſaw miniatur'd forth, the features of the murdered Edward. Oh the beautiful extreme of rapture! It grew too big for bearing. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured my child with kiſſes. I ran with weeping joy to Mrs. Arnold. I thought of thee, oh lovely Emma, as of Edward's ſiſter, and I gave thee, in that charmingly unguarded period, the dear depoſit of my boſom, which none but Caroline ſhares with thee.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0149005102:99"/>Edward, the <hi>infant</hi> Edward, ſleeps as I write this. His gentle breathing is as the muſic of the ſpheres to his mother's ear.

               <p>O Wonder-working Providence! I feel your intelligence, deareſt Mrs. Corbett, in every vein! I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge you as a friend. I receive you as a ſiſter. But <hi>there</hi> is the <hi>boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary</hi> of my power. Embrace your child, and do not complain. Louiſa, you may now receive an example of patience from the fortitude of Emma. The father and the child are both in the bed of ſickneſs, and both labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the dire extremes of diſtemper and diſtreſs. I can no more. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well. I murmur not.</p>

               <p>CASTLEBERRY is the ſeat of confuſion, and calamity. It ſeems, as if I were doomed to be the murderer of my gueſts. I can impute the illneſs of parent and child to no other cauſe, than becauſe the one too much <hi>deſires</hi> a match, which the other with too much reaſon <hi>deteſts.</hi>—Oh, mighty God! the myſtery is explained.

Within a few hours my fortunes are altered ſo much for the worſe, that it is impoſſible for me to deſire you will advance farther in the treaty relating to Emma. I cannot now give her a ſingle guinea; all ſhe will ever have, is three thouſand pounds, which is a legacy: nor can I expect your paſſion to weigh down every pecuniary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.

Sir Robert, is <hi>poverty</hi> to what my child might have expected. Suffer us then to depart. I am ſtung to the quick by various wrongs.

               <p>THE irreſolute note which I ſent this morning to your chamber, is not worth your attempting to decy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher. I wanted to expreſs my ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy of your preſent misfortune in a way more anſwerable to the emotions of my friendſhip. I wiſhed to gather ſuch knowledge of ſome perſons <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with your loſs,</hi> as might enable me to plan ſome pious fraud to relieve your ſtuation without wounding your delicacy. But I ſhould make bung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling work of it, and deſtroy the feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city I intended to promote. I am a man of plain feelings, and have no dexterity of addreſs when it is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0149005102:107"/>
to adorn them. Accept then, dear Corbett, of an honeſt mind, in lieu of elegant manners. Is any decoration neceſſary to introduce a friendly circumſtance?—and if there is not, wherefore do I thus lengthen the preface?</p>
               <p>Corbett, I am one of thoſe whom the world calls an unthrifty fellow: for I value money merely as it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces to my happineſs. My happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs depends on ſociety, and not on myſelf alone. I have fixed it in the dear domeſtic circle that encloſes Emma and her father. Beyond that barrier I do nor deſire to wander; and if I can promote their felicity, my own will, of neceſſity, be compleat.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0149005102:108"/>
You ſee my ſyſtem. It is ſimple and conciſe. By uncommon chance I am become rich, you know. The ſum I poſſeſs is too much to be diſſipated, and not enough if I had a paſſion to accumulate. It is quite ſufficient to render three perſons happy, ſo far as happineſs takes its colour from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Amongſt three perſons then let it be divided; but let only two of thoſe know the ſource by which the third is ſupplied. You may eaſily perſuade Emma to believe (what in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed will be true) that by an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected turn, your loſſes are repaired. She will be too much rejoiced at the event to teaze herſelf about the means. Or, if ſhe <hi>ſhould</hi> enquire, her curioſity is of a tender kind, and will readily
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0149005102:109"/>
be pacified. I hope you love me too well to make ſcruples; and yet I ſhall prepare myſelf to combat them. It is really a very hard and mortifying thing, that theſe <hi>bare-weight</hi> duties betwixt friend and friend, ſhould be ſo rare as to make the offer of them a matter of embarraſsment; as if there was nothing expected in ſociety but its etiquette and profeſſions. All I deſire is, that you will loſe no time in ſettling your affairs, and no otherwiſe remember the <hi>mode</hi> by which they are accommodated, than as it may im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs your boſom with tender ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſtrengthen the cement of that alliance which is formed between us. With Emma, I will (on the above conditions) take my chance as before,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0149005102:110"/>
but for the wealth of worlds I would not have her acquainted with a tittle of our private tranſactions. Nor muſt you attempt to ſway her. Leave her to the ſame chances as would <hi>before</hi> have happened. It is very unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable that I ſhould expect her to marry <hi>me</hi> for <hi>affection:</hi> but, for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven's ſake, ſave me the diſtreſs of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the ſacrificed hand of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude I am glad it is in my power to offer my teſtimonies of friendſhip to you before ſhe has been <hi>influenced.</hi> I will be with you preſently, and you ſhall have no prejudices of cuſtom about you, till you detect any thing of (what is fooliſhly called) the wiſdom of the world, clinging to the hand or the heart of</p>

               <p>I FANCY there was ſome <hi>miſtake</hi> in the letter that I encloſed from Corbett: for I find his affairs are all re-adjuſted, and the generous refuſal of my overtures to Emma (at a time when moſt parents would think them moſt acceptable) has no longer force. The prohibition is taken off, and I am again at liberty to make myſelf tenderly unhappy.</p>
               <p>Corbett is now as much recovered in health, as in his circumſtances, and word is juſt brought that Emma is better. O my heart! how ſhall I ſupport the ſight of her!—If her ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0149005102:115"/>
has made any great alteration—if ſhe appears to be in pain, or in any kind of danger, I ſhall aſſuredly diſcover myſelf. Methinks I have more fondly wiſh'd myſelf her huſband ſince her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement and indiſpoſition, than while ſhe was rejoicing in health and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. I do not deſire to unite myſelf to her beauty, more than to her weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and diſtreſs. Surely, Frederick, the tender offices of a friend are <hi>moſt</hi> amiable, where they are <hi>leaſt</hi> obſerved by the world. The feebleneſſes to which the tender frame of woman is ſubject, are, perhaps, more ſeducing than her bloom. The <hi>healthy</hi> flower looks ſuperior to protection, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pands itſelf to the ſun in a kind of

which ſhould have been ſmoothed by a daughter's care; and of wholſome viands, provided by your child.

But theſe arguments are unneceſſary, as you are reſtored to happineſs, and there is, it ſeems, ſome noble inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which Providence has made uſe of to produce the bleſſing.

                     <pb n="132" facs="tcp:0149005102:129"/>I have been weeping over the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of a <hi>compleat victory,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied Emma. She then traced the bloody progreſs of the pictured battle, and in all the pathos of philanthropy addreſſed me thus.</p>
                  <p>"O Sir Robert, behold the images of conqueſt and defeat! Obſerve two mighty hoſts of human beings met together, after the moſt deliberate plans of attack, to butcher one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther—to perpetrate <hi>generally</hi> that very crime which, in any <hi>particular</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, is puniſhed by the reſtitution of a ſhameful death. To deſtroy an individual is ignominy, but at the maſſacre of an army, the trumpet ſounds its note of boldeſt triumph.
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0149005102:130"/>
The gallows and the halter, the awful trial or gloomy dungeon preceding theſe, are prepared for him, who, in the phrenzy of paſſion, or the raging of deſire, deprives the irritating object of farther <hi>power</hi> to torment; while the laurel &amp; the bay contribute to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land of <hi>thoſe heroes,</hi> who, after returning from the cities they have depopula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the territories they have laid waſte, come bluſhing home in all the honours of blood and of ſlaughter—</p>
                  <p>She pauſed a moment. A glow of generous ſcorn was in her eye, and ſhe again extended her white arm along the picture, and proceeded.</p>
                  <p>"Here, ſir, you may obſerve, law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and <hi>glory-crowned murder,</hi> exhibited

in every form. See—ſee, into, that wretch's quivering ſide, the. ball has juſt entered!—Here lies a head ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the body.—There are the mangled reliques of an arm torn from the ſhoulder; and there the wounded horſes are trampling upon their wounded maſters!</p>

Louiſa. Nor will any <hi>but</hi> Louiſa ſoothe me. Mrs. Arnold is generous and ſenſible, elegant and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, but oh! ſhe has not drank ſo largely of that bitter, yet ſalutary cup which ſubdues the efferveſcence of the ſpirit, and diſpoſes us to melt at the miſeries of another.

Beſeech that the hoſpitable barks may ſalute each other, and that their ſeparation may alleviate mine. Implore that theſe things be granted, and my heart ſhall be at reſt.</p>
               <p>—At reſt! and will my alarms be huſhed by ſuch a circumſtance? Are the beating of the <hi>billows</hi> all I have to fear? Alas, the perils of the water are merely introductory to thoſe of the land. Scarce will the dangers of the ſtood be paſt, ere thoſe of the

               <p>I am now in London, attending the ſick chamber of Emma, into which I gain acceſs only by virtue of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. Her affection preys faſt upon her health.

               <p>In vain, Frederick, you ridicule, invite, and adviſe. I cannot quit Emma. She is ſick, and I am wretched. She loves another, and it does not relax the diligent attentions I pay to her virtue and her beauty. She has fallen in the path of my life, and I make a dead ſtop. I cannot

               <p>I WILL not affect to miſconceive you, my only parent. You ſeem conſtantly anxious to connect me with ſome worthy man, as the aſſociate of my life; yet do not recollect that my choice is made, my principles fixed, and my heart <hi>inalienably</hi> engaged. An unſubdued veneration for truth attends me. I caught the inſpiring affection I bear her, from the reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able authors of my being. It is a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice as early as it is amiable, and you ſhould not wonder if I walk ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily in the way of my directors. This, ſir, I have often told you. I have been brought up to conſider the happineſs
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0149005102:152"/>
of life, not as deducible from the maxims of the world, but from impli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit reliance upon that power whom Heaven has ſeated upon the throne of the ſoul, as an unerring judge in all caſes of moral arbitration. It has been a hard taſk for me to ſtruggle with the various inflictions which have long hung over our houſe, and though the burſt of nature has ſometimes bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unawares, it was not in <hi>thoſe</hi> ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that I was the moſt unhappy. When only the pitying eye of GOD was upon me, when I ſought the ſilent corner, and could ſecretly commune with my own heart, and enter into all its inclinings: then—<hi>then,</hi> my father, it was that the extreme of your Emma's wretchedneſs came over her;
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0149005102:153"/>
for ſhe found it impoſſible to wean her affections from an object, one ſo en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely and with ſo good reaſon appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and now ſo entirely, and (you will pardon me) without any ſolid rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, rejected. I have not, at this period, my deareſt father, collection of mind enough for much argument; but you will pleaſe to recollect that it was you who firſt kindled the ſparks of tenderneſs for Henry. Beſides that we were brought up together, when gentle impreſſions are eaſily admitted and unreſervedly avowed, you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented him as an orphan of honour, talents, and good-ſenſe. I depend on every thing you ſay, and was charmed with a ſentiment correſpondent to my own. The affection was full grown,
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0149005102:154"/>
and had expanded into bloſſom, ere you attempted to deſtroy, or even to check it. Then, <hi>all at once,</hi> you ſaid you had your reaſons, (which to this hour remain partly unexplained) to deſire I would think no more of Henry Hammond: yet, you averred, it was not fortune nor any other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance relating to what the world calls <hi>a good match,</hi> that created a change in your eſteem. Want of <hi>worth</hi> I am ſure it <hi>could</hi> not be; and yet you ſtill perſiſt to diſſuade me from attaching myſelf to merit, elegance, and virtue.</p>
               <p>I am glad this method of addreſſing each other by letter, though in the ſame houſe, has, by accident, been adopted. It appeared awkward at
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0149005102:155"/>
firſt, but hath now the familiarity of a habit. It may well be ſaid, in <hi>my</hi> caſe, "to excuſe the bluſh and pour out all the heart." Yet wherefore do I talk of bluſhing! Surely, it is not neceſſary. I yield not to any roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic pomps of paſſion. I make it not a ſubject, where it can be likely to create one diſcordant feeling. I love with ſimplicity and truth: and it is far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my power—far, even as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of a ſolemn vow is from the breach of it, to change my object but with a change of its purity. The oaths that are taken at the altar, ſir, may <hi>ratify</hi> tenderneſs, but cannot <hi>create</hi> it: and amongſt the ſordid connections of men, it is not uncommon to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the public ſanction with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0149005102:156"/>
ever receiving a private aſſent from the underſtanding or the heart. I do not think the law of the land, of itſelf, ſufficient to make a woman happy. Marriage is a very honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but it may be a very miſerable inſtitution: that is, it may produce miſery while it confers honour. The <hi>ceremony</hi> is only the <hi>ſeal</hi> of mutual love, but the <hi>bond</hi> ſhould be made before; and in point of attachment I hold my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at this moment as religiouſly uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Henry as if all the forms of the earth had paſſed my lips in confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation. The ſame idea will be lodged in my boſom whether that confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be remote or near. It is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by Heaven to be the affection of a year only. It is to laſt for life.
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0149005102:157"/>
It is to follow its object through all perils and dangers. Its holy ardour is to burn equally bright and pure, and nothing but death is to extinguiſh it. Thus contracted, my father, in ſpirit and in truth, you will eaſily judge how light muſt be the ſacrifice of my couſin's ſtrange legacy.

ſhall again proſper. The treaſures of either hemiſphere ſhall again be ſhared. The arms of a great nation ſhall no longer be employed to annoy but to defend.

The temporary eſtrangement ſhall only ſerve, like the quarrel of friends, to brighten the bonds of future amity.</p>

She is injured—ſhe is aggrieved, my daughter. Her oppreſſions are at my heart.—The ſtrings that fix it to my boſom are trembling for her.—She glows with a generous love of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.—She has been condemned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a hearing.—She was ſtabbed into reſiſtance.—The ſword was held to her throat ere ſhe thought of ſelf-defence. Conflagration, famine, and parricide, have entered her late peaceful habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.—The common bounties of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence have been denied her.—The blood of citizens, of brothers, and of friends, are flowing in rivers through her ſtreets.</p>
               <p>I have not, Emma, been one of thoſe who hawk about my principles,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0149005102:186"/>
and ſaunter in babbling ignorance from coffee-houſe to coffee-houſe. I am <hi>fixed</hi> in <hi>my</hi> politicks, and think my ſteady adherence to them a part of my <hi>religion.</hi> Since we are cruelly taught to make a ſanguinary mark of diſtinction betwixt an Engliſhman and and an American, I own myſelf the latter, and deplore the infirmities that prevent me from ruſhing to the field. My child, my child, I know the rui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous rapacity, the murder, the VII<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LAINY of this unnatural war. I enter deeply, and pathetically, into every wrong which America ſuſtains. It is the only point wherein I am enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic, and it is the only point where enthuſiam is great and glorious! Do not imagine, raſh girl!—monſtrous
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0149005102:187"/>
thought!—do not DARE to imagine ungrateful Henry ſhall ever receive the hand of Emma. Spare me, belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved daughter, in this one part—this ſore, this tender part—and in every <hi>other,</hi> command your father! You owe me this ſubmiſſion, you owe me this FAVOUR, this <hi>indulgence.</hi> I would have preſerved your Hammond, and oppoſed his entering into this wicked employment, but it was impoſſible. High of heart, he ſcorned to be even <hi>tenderly</hi> controuled. I endeavoured to win him generouſly over to an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable cauſe. He called it inſult, bribery, baſeneſs. The military diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction was throbbing in every vein. When I argued, he juſtified every meaſure of miniſtry. <hi>Great-Britain,</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0149005102:188"/>
he ſaid, was groſsly abuſed—her le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity ſcorned—her laws defied—her ſublime prerogative contemptuouſly ſet at nought. He ſpoke loud and vehement of American <hi>rebellion.</hi> The honour of the empire, he ſaid, now depended on the exertion of each in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual, and it was the duty of every young man (whom every tie of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, every bond of loyalty, and every principle of policy called upon) to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt his zeal, his courage, and his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment. He went on, my child in all the foaming folly of youth, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring, that he ſhould account himſelf baſe, were he to deny the <hi>contribution</hi> of his arm. The greater his love for <hi>Emma,</hi> the nobler his <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> he ſaid. He was determined: he had made up
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0149005102:189"/>
his mind: and was reſolved to defend his country or gloriouſly periſh in her ruins. I pitied his delirium, yet ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated his ardour. Well directed, of what was it not ſuſceptible! He was above admonition, and kept er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring on. In true tenderneſs to thee, my Emma, I forgot the dignity of age, and even ſtooped to intercede. After all my letters to him were in vain, I privately ſought a perſonal interview, but his boiling ſpirit took fire, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctantly withdrew, and gave up the point.</p>
               <p>Oh America, thou bleeding inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, how art thou laden with oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions! Oh my child, my child! Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Religion, and Religion's <hi>God,</hi>

are on her ſide; and will you take to your arms, and to your embraces, a youth who propenſely <hi>violates</hi> theſe? —a cruel youth whoſe reeking blade may at this moment ſmoke with kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred gore! Tyranny hath not a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve of barbarity in ſtore. She is exhauſted. Your Henry is a <hi>volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer</hi> amongſt thoſe who, as an acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Britiſh army, have added the tomahawk, the hatchet, and the ſcalping knife. And will the tender-hearted Emma continue to love ſuch a barbarian? Away, away, it will not bear a thought! Baniſh, obliviate, <hi>deteſt</hi> him. He is in open rebellion againſt the <hi>laws of nature.</hi> Let your affections flow into a fairer channel—

               <p>I HAVE a ſuſpicion that Mr. Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond is wounded; let that cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, oh my father, account to you for the horrors of mind which have for ſome days locked up every power of hand and of voice. The former faculty is in ſome meaſure reſtored, ſo far at leaſt, as tremblingly to trace upon paper ſomething like an anſwer to your affecting favour; every ſylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of which is as an envenomed ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row fixing in my boſom. Your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined objection then to poor Henry is at laſt accounted for! I thought the ſanguine track of party was waſhed wholly from a father's heart by the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0149005102:199"/>
blood of my brother. Shall political prejudices interrupt the fineſt affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of humanity? Horrid is the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of battle, view it on either ſide. It cannot ſhift to an attitude, nor take <hi>one poſition,</hi> to ſoften its terrors upon the reflecting <hi>mind.</hi> To THAT it is uniformly odious; nor is it at all amen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded by conſidering, that as it began ſoon after the <hi>creation,</hi> it will ſcarcely end till the <hi>deſtruction</hi> of the world. It has, even within the narrow pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cincts of <hi>our</hi> family, divided the ſon from the father, and the lover from his miſtreſs; let it not be rendered <hi>more</hi> dire by ſetting the intereſt of the daughter againſt that of her moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured parent, ſince <hi>that</hi> would be to encourage the madneſs of mortals,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0149005102:200"/>
and the civil peſtilence, that in the form of a <hi>family-war,</hi> is gone forth againſt us. It would violate the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle laws of nature, and tear down thoſe conciliating ties which faſten <hi>kindred</hi> in one vaſt chain of connexion, ample as earth, and beautiful as heaven. You have painted your own patriotiſm and that of Henry, ſir, with equal vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of language; at leaſt, you have ſaid enough either way to prove that <hi>both</hi> fancy the <hi>cauſe adopted</hi> is the cauſe of rectitude and glory. When one ſide attacks, the other muſt naturally defend; on which account, while the ſpirit of contention remains, ſome will vehemently cenſure the very meaſures which ſome as vehemently applaud. But, in avowing your own enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſm,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0149005102:201"/>
my dear father, do you not, in effect, juſtify that of Henry? You both ſeem to hug to your boſoms a political Cleopatra, for whoſe ſake you are willing to gain or to loſe a world. England is to Henry what America is to you. Each inſiſts that he is eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the cauſe of an injured friend: and while this is the caſe, how can it be expected that <hi>either</hi> ſhould yield? In fact, would not ſuch a conceſſion, according to the preſcriptions of <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour,</hi> in this world's acceptation of the word, be accounted baſe? You have, you ſay, attempted to direct the ſword of Henry on the better ſide of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute. <hi>Which</hi> is that better ſide? Henry declares for Britain; you for America. What third perſon ſhall
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0149005102:202"/>
decide between you? The feeble voice of a woman will neither be heard or admitted. Elſe, might ſhe ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to aſſert that your countrymen are bleeding abroad, while the point of right and wrong is adjuſting at home. This, however, is clear, my dear father, from your own premiſes: if Henry thought himſelf inſulted by the propoſal of changing his ſide, <hi>you</hi> would have been no leſs ſtung, had a ſimilar propoſition come from <hi>him</hi> to <hi>you.</hi> And this proves, that both are acting on what is called patriotic prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. What right reaſon then has the one to be diſpleaſed with the other? Yet upon this diſpleaſure on your part, you urge me to withdraw my vows. Are then virtuous reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0149005102:203"/>
ſo to be withdrawn, my father? When affection is faſhioned by the feelings, and long cheriſhed in a ſoul which neither projects nor practiſes any ill, whoſe every thought is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the holy criticiſm of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, nor ever dreads the ſcrutiny—is it, under theſe circumſtances, of a texture ſo convenient, as to ſhift from object to object with every gale of opinion, and move away at the word of command? Wherefore, let me once again tenderly enquire, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did you originally inſpire me with a veneration for ſober reaſon? why infuſe in me a ſteady and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous way of thinking? Was it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned for ornament or for uſe? If not intended as the <hi>governing rule of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct,</hi>
                  <pb n="207" facs="tcp:0149005102:204"/>
through every meander of this mortal pilgrimage, oh wherefore did you not at <hi>firſt,</hi> even in the nurſery, while every power was impreſſive and would have taken the form you choſe to give it—wherefore <hi>then</hi> did you not lead me into the path that I was to tread without ſtop or turning? Alas! you have given me fixed princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, acknowledged they were good, ſaw them with joy take root in my heart, and now you expect in their fulleſt growth and fineſt foliage, that they ſhould ſuddenly periſh. But the habits of my youth are grown ſo ſtrong, that I feel it is too late for me to deal in diſguiſes. I will not now begin an artificial character. Oh! ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer me to implore you, ſir, to continue
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0149005102:205"/>
my attachment to Truth and Nature. I know nothing of ſtate wrangles, or Congreſs quarrels. I mix not with the infuriate errors of party. I only act up to thoſe ſimple principles of moral life, which aſſure me that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy in favour of <hi>a known valuable object</hi> (not obſtinate predilection to a <hi>bad one</hi>) is the baſis on which the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtructure of all that is noble, juſt, and good, muſt be raiſed. My wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is extremely limited. It ſtretches not into thoſe maxims which deſolate the earth for a vapour of victory, nor does it preſume to penetrate the wiles of government. All it <hi>does</hi> pretend to, belongs to that ſmall and dear ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem in which every woman ought to be inſtructed; namely, that a <hi>well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixed
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0149005102:206"/>
tenderneſs</hi> ſhould never be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that it ſhould brave the ſtorms of fortune and diſtreſs, that while life remains it ſhould be the animating <hi>purpoſe</hi> of life to <hi>cultivate</hi> it, and that death, and death <hi>only,</hi> ſhould diſſolve the bonds which virtue had made. If my beloved father would for one moment lay the clamorous contenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a bickering ſpecies aſide, and ſubmit to be charmed by that diſpaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate power which decides calmly of truth and falſhood, he would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of this. I am ſure he would: for his nature is gentle and his heart is ſoft. Ah think what a taſk it is for your ſoul-ſick Emma to be under the neceſſity of uſing theſe pleadings at <hi>ſuch a time!</hi> Come to her bed ſide—
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0149005102:207"/>
