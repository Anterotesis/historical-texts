            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <salute>MY DEAR FRIENDS!</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IN a converſation, ſome months ago, I happened to mention to you the idea I had long enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of that celebrated Epiſtle of Horace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly diſtinguiſhed by the title of THE ART OF POETRY. I will not ſay that you acceded to my opinion; but I flatter myſelf that I, in ſome degree intereſted your curioſity, and engaged your attention: our diſcourſe at leaſt revived an intention I had once formed, of communicating my thoughts on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Publick; an intention I had only dropt for want of leiſure and inclination to attempt a tranſlation of the Epiſtle, which I thought neceſſary to accompany the original, and my remarks on it.

In the original, Horace aſſumes the air and ſtyle of an affectionate teacher, admoniſhing and inſtructing his young friends and pupils: but the following tranſlation, together with the obſervations annexed, I addreſs to You as my Maſters, from whom I look for ſound information, a well-grounded confirmation of my hypotheſis, or a ſolution of my doubts, and a correction of my errors.</p>
               <p>It is almoſt needleſs to obſerve, that the Epiſtle in queſtion has very particularly exerciſed the critical ſagacity of the literary world; yet it is remarkable that, amidſt the great variety of comments and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions on the work, it has been almoſt univerſally conſidered, except by one acute and learned writer of this country, as a looſe, vague, and deſultory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition; a maſs of ſhining materials; like pearls unſtrung, valuable indeed, but not diſplayed to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage.</p>
               <p>Some have contended, with Scaliger at their head, that this pretended <hi>Art of Poetry</hi> is totally void of art; and that the very work, in which the beauty and excellence of <hi>Order</hi> (ORDINIS VIRTUS ET VENUS!) is ſtrongly recommended, is in itſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected, confuſed, and immethodical. The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocates
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0587000703:12"/>
for the writer have in great meaſure confeſſed the charge, but pleaded, in excuſe and vindication, the familiarity of an Epiſtle, and even the genius of Poetry, in which the formal diviſions of a proſaick treatiſe on the art would have been inſupportable. They have alſo denied that Horace ever intended ſuch a treatiſe, or that he ever gave to this Epiſtle the title of <hi>the Art of Poetry</hi>; on which <hi>title</hi> the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of Scaliger, and his followers, are chiefly grounded. The title, however, is confeſſedly as old as the age of Quintilian; and that the work it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf has a perpetual reference <hi>to Poets and Poetry,</hi> is as evident, as that it is, from beginning to end, in its manner, ſtyle, addreſs, and form, perfectly <hi>Epiſtolary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The learned and ingenious Critick diſtinguiſhed above, an early ornament to letters, and now a worthy dignitary of the church, leaving vain com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and idle diſputes on the <hi>title</hi> of the work, ſagaciouſly directed his reſearches to ſcrutinize the work itſelf; properly endeavouring to trace and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigate from the compoſition, the end and deſign of the writer, and remembering the axiom of the Poet, to whom his friend had been appointed the commentator.</p>

               <p>With this view of illuſtrating and explaining Horace's Art of Poetry, this ſhrewd and able writer, about thirty years ago, republiſhed the original Epiſtle, giving the text chiefly after Dr. Bentley, ſubjoining an Engliſh Commentary and Notes, and prefixing an Introduction, from which I beg leave to tranſcribe moſt part of the three firſt paragraphs.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>It is agreed on all hands, that the antients are our maſters in the <hi>art</hi> of compoſition. Such of their writings, therefore, as deliver inſtructions for the exerciſe of this <hi>art,</hi> muſt be of the higheſt value. And, if any of them hath acquired a credit, in this reſpect, ſuperior to the reſt, it is, perhaps, the <hi>following work:</hi> which the learned have long ſince conſidered as a kind of <hi>ſummary</hi> of the rules of good writing; to be gotten by heart by every young ſtudent; and to whoſe deciſive authority the greateſt maſters in taſte and compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition muſt finally ſubmit.</p>
                  <p>But the more unqueſtioned the credit of this poem is, the more it will concern the publick, that it be juſtly and accurately underſtood. The writer of theſe ſheets then believed it might be of
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0587000703:14"/>
uſe, if he took ſome pains to clear the ſenſe, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nect the method, and aſcertain the ſcope and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, of this admired Epiſtle. Others, he knew indeed, and ſome of the firſt fame for critical learning, had been before him in his attempt. Yet he did not find himſelf prevented by their labours; in which, beſides innumerable leſſer faults, he, more eſpecially, obſerved two invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate errors, of ſuch a ſort, as muſt needs perplex the genius, and diſtreſs the learning, of <hi>any</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentator. The <hi>one</hi> of theſe reſpects the SUBJECT; the other, the METHOD of the <hi>Art of Poetry.</hi> It will be neceſſary to ſay ſomething upon each.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the <hi>Art of Poetry,</hi> at large, is not the <hi>proper</hi> ſubject of this piece, is ſo apparent, that it hath not eſcaped the dulleſt and leaſt attentive of its Criticks. For, however all the different <hi>kinds</hi> of poetry might appear to enter into it, yet every one ſaw, that <hi>ſome</hi> at leaſt were very ſlightly conſidered: whence the frequent attempts, the <hi>artes et inſtitutiones poeticae,</hi> of writers, both at home and abroad, to ſupply its deficiencies. But, though this truth was ſeen and confeſſed, it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily happened, that the ſagacity of his nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Commentators went no further. They ſtill
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0587000703:15"/>
conſidered this famous Epiſtle as a <hi>collection,</hi> though not a <hi>ſyſtem,</hi> of criticiſms on poetry in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; with this conceſſion, however, that the ſtage had evidently the largeſt ſhare in it<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <q>Satyra haec eſt in ſui ſaeculi poetas, PRAECIPUE vero in Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Drama. <bibl>Baxter.</bibl>
                        </q>
                     </note>. Under the influence of this prejudice, ſeveral writers of name took upon them to comment and explain it: and with the ſucceſs, which was to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from ſo fatal a miſtake on ſetting out, as the not ſeeing, <q rend="inline">'that the proper and ſole pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the Author, was, not to abridge the Greek Criticks, whom he probably never thought of; nor to amuſe himſelf with compoſing a ſhort criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſyſtem, for the general uſe of poets, which every line of it abſolutely confutes; but, ſimply to criticize the ROMAN DRAMA.'</q> For to this end, not the tenor of the work only, but as will appear, every ſingle precept in it, ultimately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers. The miſchiefs of this original error have been long felt. It hath occaſioned a conſtant perplexity in defining the <hi>general</hi> method, and in fixing the import of <hi>particular</hi> rules. Nay, its effects have reached ſtill further. For conceiving, as they did, that the whole had been compoſed out of the Greek Criticks, the labour and ingenuity
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0587000703:16"/>
of its interpreters have been miſemployed in picking out authorities, which were not wanted, and in producing, or, more properly, by their ſtudied refinements in <hi>creating,</hi> conformities, which were never deſigned. Whence it hath come to paſs, that, inſtead of inveſtigating the order of the Poet's own reflexions, and ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinizing the peculiar ſtate of the Roman Stage (the methods, which common ſenſe, and common criticiſm would preſcribe) the world hath been nauſeated with inſipid lectures on <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> and <hi>Phalereus</hi>; whoſe ſolid ſenſe hath been ſo attenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated and ſubtilized by the delicate operation of French criticiſm, as hath even gone ſome way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards bringing the <hi>art</hi> itſelf into diſrepute.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But the wrong explications of this poem have ariſen, not from the miſconception of the <hi>ſubject</hi> only, but from an inattention to the METHOD of it. The <hi>latter</hi> was, in part, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine conſequence of the <hi>former.</hi> For, not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting an unity of deſign in the ſubject, its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreters never looked for, or could never find, a conſiſtency of diſpoſition in the method. And this was indeed the very block upon which HEINSIUS, and, before him, JULIUS SCALIGER,
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0587000703:17"/>
himſelf ſtumbled. Theſe illuſtrious Criticks, with all the force of genius, which is required to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embarraſs an involved ſubject, and all the aids of learning, that can lend a ray to enlighten a dark one, have, notwithſtanding, found themſelves utterly unable to unfold the order of this Epiſtle; inſomuch, that SCALIGER <note n="*" place="bottom">Praef. in LIB. POET. et l. vi. p. 338.</note> hath boldly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the conduct of it to be <hi>vicious</hi>; and HEIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIUS had no other way to evade the charge, than by recurring to the forced and uncritical expedient of a licentious tranſpoſition. The truth is, they were both in one common error, that the Poet's purpoſe had been to write a criticiſm of the Art of Poetry at large, and not, as is here ſhewn, of the Roman Drama in particular.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The remainder of this Introduction, as well as the Commentary and Notes, afford ample proofs of the erudition and ingenuity of the Critick; yet I much doubt, whether he has been able to convince the learned world of the truth of his main propoſition, <q rend="inline">"that it was the proper and ſole purpoſe of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, ſimply <hi>to criticiſe the</hi> ROMAN DRAMA."</q> His Commentary is, it muſt be owned, extremely ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; yet the attentive reader of Horace will perhaps
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0587000703:18"/>
often fancy, that he perceives a violence and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint offered to the compoſition, in order to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate it to the ſyſtem of the Commentator; who, to ſuch a reader, may perhaps ſeem to mark tranſitions, and point out connections, as well as to maintain <hi>a method</hi> in the Commentary, which cannot clearly be deduced from the text, to which it refers.</p>
               <p>This very ingenious <hi>Commentary</hi> opens as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The ſubject of this piece being, as I ſuppoſe, <hi>one,</hi> viz. <hi>the ſtate of the Roman Drama,</hi> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe requiring, even in the freeſt forms of compoſition, ſome kind of <hi>method,</hi> the intelligent reader will not be ſurprized to find the poet proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his ſubject in a regular, well-ordered <hi>plan</hi>; which, for the more exact deſcription of it, I diſtinguiſh into three parts:</p>
                  <p n="1">I. The firſt of them [from l. 1 to 89] is prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to the main ſubject of the Epiſtle, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſome general rules and reflections on poetry, but principally with an eye to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing parts: by which means it ſerves as an uſeful introduction to the poet's deſign, and opens with that air of eaſe and elegance, eſſential to the epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolary form.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0587000703:19"/>II. The main body of the Epiſtle [from l. 89 to 295] is laid out in regulating the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtage; but chiefly in giving rules for Tragedy; not only as that was the ſublimer ſpecies of the <hi>Drama,</hi> but, as it ſhould ſeem, leſs cultivated and underſtood.</p>
                  <p n="3">III. The laſt part [from l. 295 to the end] ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts to correctneſs in writing; yet ſtill with an eye, principally, to the <hi>dramatick ſpecies:</hi> and is taken up partly in removing the cauſes, that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it; and partly in directing to the uſe of ſuch means, as might ſerve to promote it. Such is the general plan of the Epiſtle.</p>
               </q>
               <p>In this general ſummary, with which the Critick introduces his particular Commentary, a very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial circumſtance is acknowledged, which perhaps tends to render the ſyſtem on which it proceeds, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely doubtful, if not wholly untenable. The original Epiſtle conſiſts of four hundred and ſeventy-ſix lines; and it appears, from the above numerical analyſis, that not half of thoſe lines, only two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſix verſes [from v. 89 to 295] are employed on the ſubject of <hi>the Roman Stage.</hi> The firſt of the three parts above delineated [from v. 1 to 89] cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0587000703:20"/>
                  <hi>contains general rules and reſtrictions on poetry,</hi> but ſurely with no particular reference to the Drama. As to the ſecond part, the Critick, I think, might fairly have extended the Poet's conſideration of the Drama to the 365th line, ſeventy lines further than he has carried it: but the laſt hundred and eleven lines of the Epiſtle ſo little allude to the Drama, that the only paſſage in which a mention of the Stage has been ſuppoſed to be implied, [<hi>luduſque repertus, &amp;c.</hi>] is, by the learned and ingenious Critick himſelf, particularly diſtinguiſhed with a very different inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation. Nor can this portion of the Epiſtle be conſidered, by the impartial and intelligent reader, as a mere exhortation <q rend="inline">"to correctneſs in writing; taken up partly in removing the cauſes that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it; and partly in directing to the uſe of ſuch means, as might ſerve to promote it."</q> 
                  <hi>Correctneſs</hi> is indeed here, as in many other parts of Horace's Satires and Epiſtles, occaſionally inculcated; but ſurely the main ſcope of this animated concluſion is to deter thoſe, who are not bleſt with genius, from attempting the walks of Poetry.</p>
               <p>I much approve what this writer has urged on the <hi>unity of ſubject, and beauty of epiſtolary method</hi> obſerved in this Work; but cannot agree that <q rend="inline">"the main
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0587000703:21"/>
ſubject and intention was <hi>the regulation of the Roman Stage.</hi>"</q> How far I may differ concerning particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar paſſages, will appear from the notes at the end of this tranſlation. In controverſial criticiſm differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of opinion cannot but be expreſſed, <hi>(veniam petimuſque damuſque viciſſim,)</hi> but I hope I ſhall not be thought to have delivered my ſentiments with petulance, or be accuſed of want of reſpect for a character, that I moſt ſincerely reverence and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to ſet down in writing, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what I ſuggeſted to you in converſation, concerning my own conceptions of the end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of Horace in this Epiſtle. In this explanation I ſhall call upon Horace as my chief witneſs, and the Epiſtle itſelf, as my principal voucher. Should their teſtimonies prove adverſe, my ſyſtem muſt be aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, like many that have preceded it, as vain and chimerical: and if it ſhould even, by their ſupport, be acknowledged and received, it will, I think, like the egg of Columbus, appear ſo plain, eaſy, and obvious, that it will ſeem almoſt wonderful, that the Epiſtle has never been conſidered in the ſame light, till now. I do not wiſh to dazzle with the luſtre of a new hypotheſis, which requires, I think,
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0587000703:22"/>
neither the ſtrong opticks, nor powerful glaſſes, of a critical Herſchel, to aſcertain the truth of it; but is a ſyſtem, that lies level to common apprehenſion, and a luminary, diſcoverable by the naked eye.</p>
               <p>My notion is ſimply this. I conceive that one of the ſons of Piſo, undoubtedly the Elder, had either written, or meditated, a poetical work, moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly a Tragedy; and that he had, with the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the family, communicated his piece, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, to Horace: but Horace, either diſapproving of the work, or doubting of the poetical faculties of the Elder Piſo, or both, wiſhed to diſſuade him from all thoughts of publication. With this view he formed the deſign of writing this Epiſtle, addreſſing it, with a courtlineſs and delicacy perfectly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to his acknowledged character, indifferently to the whole family, the father and his two ſons. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtola ad Piſones, de Arte Poeticâ.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He begins with general reflections, generally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to his <hi>three</hi> friends. <hi>Credite,</hi> PISONES!—PATER, <hi>&amp;</hi> JUVENES <hi>patre digni!</hi>—In theſe prelimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rules, equally neceſſary to be obſerved by Poets of every denomination, he dwells on the neceſſity of unity of deſign, the danger of being dazzled by the
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0587000703:23"/>
ſplendor of partial beauties, the choice of ſubjects, the beauty of order, the elegance and propriety of diction, and the uſe of a thorough knowledge of the nature of the ſeveral different ſpecies of Poetry: ſumming up this introductory portion of his Epiſtle, in a manner perfectly agreeable to the concluſion of it.</p>

               </q>
               <p>From this general view of poetry, on the canvas of Ariſtotle, but entirely after his own manner, the writer proceeds to give the rules and hiſtory of the Drama; adverting principally to Tragedy, with all its conſtituents and appendages of diction, fable, character, incidents, chorus, meaſure, muſick, and decoration. In this part of the work, according to the interpretation of the beſt Criticks, and indeed (I think) according to the manifeſt tenor of the Epiſtle, he addreſſes himſelf entirely to <hi>the two young gentlemen,</hi> pointing out to them the difficulty, as well as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, of the Dramatick Art; inſiſting on the avowed ſuperiority of the Graecian Writers, and aſcribing the comparative failure of the Romans to negligence and avarice. The Poet, having
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0587000703:24"/>
exhauſted this part of his ſubject, ſuddenly drops a <hi>ſecond,</hi> diſmiſſing at once no leſs than <hi>two</hi> of the <hi>three</hi> Perſons, to whom he originally addreſſed his Epiſtle, and turning ſhort on <hi>the</hi> ELDER PISO, moſt earneſtly conjures him to ponder on the danger of precipitate publications, and the ridicule to which the author of wretched poetry expoſes himſelf. From the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of this partial addreſs, O MAJOR JUVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUM, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> [v. 366] to the end of the poem, <hi>almoſt a fourth part of the whole,</hi> the ſecond perſon plural, <hi>Piſones!—Vos!—Vos, O Pompilius Sanguis!</hi> &amp;c. is diſcarded, and the ſecond perſon ſingular, <hi>Tu, Te, Tibi,</hi> &amp;c. invariably takes its place. The argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments too are equally relative and perſonal; not only ſhewing the neceſſity of ſtudy, combined with natural genius, to conſtitute a Poet; but dwelling on the peculiar danger and deluſion of flattery, to a writer of rank and fortune; as well as the ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble value of an honeſt friend, to reſcue him from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion and contempt. The Poet, however, in reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Muſe, qualifies his exaggerated deſcription of an infatuated ſcribbler, with a moſt noble enco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mium on the uſes of Good Poetry, vindicating the dignity of the Art, and proudly aſſerting, that the moſt exalted characters would not be diſgraced by the cultivation of it.</p>

               <p>It is worthy obſervation, that in the ſatyrical picture of a frantick bard, with which Horace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes his Epiſtle, he not only runs counter to what might be expected as a Corollary of an Eſſay on <hi>the Art of Poetry,</hi> but contradicts his own uſual practice and ſentiments. In his Epiſtle to Auguſtus, inſtead of ſtigmatizing the love of verſe as an abominable phrenſy, he calls it <hi>(levis haec inſania) a ſlight mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and deſcants on its good effects—<hi>quantas</hi> VIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TUTES <hi>habeat, ſic collige!</hi>

                  <pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0587000703:26"/>To conclude, if I have not contemplated my ſyſtem, till I am become blind to its imperfections, this view of the Epiſtle not only preſerves to it all that <hi>unity of ſubject, and elegance of method,</hi> ſo much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on by the excellent Critick, to whom I have ſo often referred; but by adding to his judicious general abſtract the familiarities of perſonal addreſs, ſo ſtrongly marked by the writer, ſcarce a line ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears idle or miſplaced: while the order and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Epiſtle to the Piſos appears as evident and unembarraſſed, as that of the Epiſtle to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtus; in which laſt, the actual ſtate of the Roman Drama ſeems to have been more manifeſtly the object of Horace's attention, than in the Work now under conſideration.</p>
               <p>Before I leave you to the further examination of the original of Horace, and ſubmit to you the Tranſlation, with the Notes that accompany it, I cannot help obſerving, that the ſyſtem, which I have here laid down, is not ſo entirely new, as it may perhaps at firſt appear to the reader, or as I myſelf originally ſuppoſed it. No Critick indeed has, to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, directly conſidered <hi>the whole Epiſtle</hi> in the ſame light that I have now taken it; but yet <hi>parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular paſſages</hi> ſeem ſo ſtrongly to enforce ſuch an
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0587000703:27"/>
interpretation, that the Editors, Tranſlators, and Commentators, have been occaſionally driven to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations of a ſimilar tendency; of which the Notes annexed will exhibit ſeveral ſtriking inſtances.</p>
               <p>Of the following verſion I ſhall only ſay, that I have not, knowingly, adopted a ſingle expreſſion, tending to warp the judgement of the learned or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned reader, in favour of my own hypotheſis. I attempted this tranſlation, chiefly becauſe I could find no other equally cloſe and literal. Even the Verſion of Roſcommon, though in blank verſe, is in ſome parts a paraphraſe, and in others, but an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract. I have myſelf, indeed, endeavoured to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port my right to that force and freedom of tranſlation which Horace himſelf recommends; yet I have faithfully exhibited in our language ſeveral paſſages, which his profeſſed tranſlators have abandoned, as impoſſible to be given in Engliſh.</p>
               <p>All I think neceſſary to be further ſaid on the Epiſtle, will appear in the Notes.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE reſerved the Notes to this place, that the reader might be left to his genuine feelings, and the natural impreſſion on reading the Epiſtle, whether adverſe or favourable to the idea I ventured to premiſe, concerning its Subject and Deſign. In the addreſs to my learned and worthy friends I ſaid little more than was neceſſary to open my plan, and to offer an excuſe for my undertaking. The Notes deſcend to particulars, tending to illuſtrate and confirm my hypotheſis; and adding occaſional explanations of the original, chiefly intended for the uſe of the Engliſh Reader. I have endeavoured, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the beſt of my ability, to follow the advice of ROSCOMMON in the lines, which I have ventured to prefix to theſe Notes. How far I may be entitled to <hi>the poetical bleſſing</hi> promiſed by the Poet, the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick muſt determine: but were I, avoiding arrogance, to renounce all claim to it, ſuch an appearance of <hi>Modeſty</hi> would include a charge of <hi>Impèrtinence</hi> for having hazarded this publication.</p>

                  <head>THE ART of POETRY, an EPISTLE, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Q. HORATII FLACCI EPISTOLA AD PISONES.</head>
                  <div n="title" type="note">
                     <p>THE work of Horace, now under conſideration, has been ſo long known, and ſo generally received, by the name of <hi>The Art of Poetry,</hi> that I have, on account of that notoriety, ſubmitted this tranſlation to the Publick, under that title, rather than what I hold to be the true one, <hi>viz. Horace's</hi> EPISTLE TO THE PISOS. The Author of the Engliſh Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary has adopted the ſame title, though directly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to his own ſyſtem; and, I ſuppoſe, for the very ſame reaſon.</p>
                     <p>The title, in general a matter of indifference, is, in the preſent inſtance, of much conſequence. On the title Julius Scaliger founded his invidious, and injudicious, attack. <hi>De arte quaeres quid ſentiam. Quid? equidem quod</hi> DE ARTE, SINE ARTE <hi>traditâ.</hi> To <hi>ehe Title</hi> all the editors, and commentators, have
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0587000703:96"/>
particularly adverted; commonly preferring the Epiſtolary Denomination, but, in contradiction to that preference, almoſt univerſally inſcribing the Epiſtle, <hi>the Art of Poetry.</hi> The conduct, however, of JASON DE NORES, a native of Cyprus, a learned and ingenious writer of the 16th century, is very remarkable. In the year 1553 he publiſhed at Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice this work of Horace, accompanied with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary and notes, written in elegant Latin, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing it, after Quintilian, <hi>Q. Horatii Flacci</hi> LIBER DE ARTE POETICA<note n="*" place="bottom">I think it right to mention that I have never ſeen the firſt edition, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed at Venice. With a copy of the ſecond edition, printed at Paris, I was favoured by Dr. Warton of Wincheſter.</note>. The very next year, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he printed at Paris a ſecond edition, enriching his notes with many obſervations on Dante and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch, and changing the title, after mature conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, to <hi>Q. Horatii Flacci</hi> EPISTOLA AD PISONES, <hi>de Arte Poeticâ.</hi> His motives for this change he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns in the following terms.</p>

                     <p>Deſprez, the Dauphin Editor, retains both titles, but ſays, inclining to the Epiſtolary, <hi>Attamen</hi> ARTEM POETICAM <hi>vix appellem cum Quintiliano et aliis: ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lim vero</hi> EPISTOLAM <hi>nuncupare cum nonnullis eruditis.</hi> Monſieur Dacier inſcribes it, properly enough, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the idea of Porphyry, <hi>Q.

                     <p>Julius Scaliger certainly ſtands convicted of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical malice by his poor cavil at <hi>the</hi> SUPPOSED <hi>title</hi>;

and has betrayed his ignorance of the eaſe and beauty of Epiſtolary method, as well as the moſt groſs miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apprehenſion, by his ridiculous analyſis of the work, reſolving it into thirty-ſix parts. He ſeems, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to have not ill conceived the genius of the poem, in ſaying that <hi>it reliſhed of</hi> SATIRE. This he has urged in many parts of his Poeticks, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the Dedicatory Epiſtle to his ſon, not omitting, however, his conſtant charge of <hi>Art with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Art. Horatius</hi> ARTEM <hi>cum inſcripſit,</hi> ADEO SINE ULLA DOCET ARTE, UT SATYRAE PROPIUS TOTUM OPUS ILLUD ESSE VIDEATUR. This comes almoſt home to the opinion of the Author of the elegant commentaries on the two Epiſtles of Horace to the Piſos and to Auguſtus, as expreſſed in the Dedica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the latter: With the recital of that opinion I ſhall conclude this long note. <q rend="inline">"The genius of Rome was bold and elevated: but Criticiſm of any kind, was little cultivated, never profeſſed as an <hi>art,</hi> by this people.

                        <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0587000703:100"/>Monſieur Dacier, at a very early period, feels the influence of <hi>the perſonal addreſs,</hi> that governs this Epiſtle. Remarking on this paſſage, he obſerves that Horace, anxious to inſpire <hi>the Piſos</hi> with a juſt taſte, ſays earneſtly <hi>Truſt me, my Piſos! Credite Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſones!</hi> an expreſſion that betrays fear and diſtruſt, left <hi>the young Men</hi> ſhould fall into the dangerous error of bad poets, and injudicious criticks, who not only thought the want of unity of ſubject a pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effect of Genius, but even the mark of a rich and luxuriant imagination. And although this Epiſtle, continues Monſieur Dacier, is addreſſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>differently to Piſo the father, and his Sons, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by v. 24 of the original, yet it is <hi>to the ſons in particular</hi> that theſe precepts are directed; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration which reconciles the difference mentioned by Porphyry. <hi>Scribit ad Piſones, viros nobiles di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertoſque, patrem et filios; vel, ut alii volunt,</hi> AD PISONES FRATRES.</p>

Theſe examples he has accompanied with much ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant and judicious obſervation, as the reader of

taſte will be convinced by the following ſhort ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts.</p>
                     <q>The writers of that time had ſo <hi>latinized</hi> the Engliſh language, that the pure <hi>Engliſh Idiom,</hi> which Shakeſpeare generally follows, has all the air of <hi>novelty,</hi> which other writers are uſed to affect by foreign phraſeology.—In ſhort, the articles here enumerated are but ſo many ways of departing from the uſual and ſimpler forms of ſpeech, without neglecting too much the grace of eaſe and perſpicuity; in which well-tempered li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence one of the greateſt charms of all poetry, but eſpecially of Shakeſpeare's poetry, conſiſts. Not that he was always and every where ſo happy. His expreſſion ſometimes, and by the very means, here exemplified, becomes <hi>hard, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,</hi> and <hi>unnatural.</hi> This is the extreme on the other ſide.

                     <p>The ingenious author of the Engliſh Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary, to whom I have ſo often referred, and to whom I muſt continue to refer, has diſcovered particular taſte, judgement, and addreſs, in his explication of this part of the Epiſtle. It runs thus.</p>
                     <q>From reflections on <hi>poetry, at large,</hi> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds now to <hi>particulars:</hi> the moſt obvious of
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0587000703:113"/>
which being the different <hi>forms</hi> and <hi>meaſures</hi> of poetick compoſition, he conſiders, in this view, [from v. 75 to 86] the four great ſpecies of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etry, to which all others may be reduced, <hi>the Epick, Elegiack, Dramatick, and Lyrick.</hi> But the diſtinction of the <hi>meaſure,</hi> to be obſerved in the ſeveral ſpecies is ſo obvious, that there can ſcarcely be any miſtake about them. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is to know [from v. 86 to 89] how far each may partake of the <hi>ſpirit</hi> of the other, without deſtroying that <hi>natural and neceſſary difference,</hi> which ought to ſubſiſt betwixt them all. To ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain this, which is a point of great nicety, he conſiders [from v. 89 to 99] the caſe of Drama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Poetry; the two ſpecies of which are as di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct from each other, as any two can be, and yet there are times, when the features of the one will be allowed to reſemble thoſe of the other.—But the Poet had a further view in chuſing this inſtance. For he gets by this means into the main of his ſubject, which was Dramatick Poetry, and, by the moſt delicate tranſition imaginable, proceeds [from 89 to 323] to deliver a ſeries of rules, interſperſed with hiſtorical accounts, <hi>and enlivened by digreſſions,</hi> for the regulation of the ROMAN STAGE.</q>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0587000703:114"/>It is needleſs to inſiſt, that my hypotheſis will not allow me to concur entirely in the latter part of this extract; at leaſt in that latitude, to which the ſyſtem of the writer carries it: yet I perfectly agree with Mr. Duncombe, that the learned Critick, in his obſervation on this Epiſtle, <q rend="inline">"has ſhewn in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, the connection and dependence of one part with another, in a clearer light than any other Commentator."</q> His ſhrewd and delicate commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary is, indeed, a moſt elegant contraſt to the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous analyſis of Scaliger, drawn up without the leaſt idea of poetical tranſition, and with the uncouth air of a mere dry logician, or dull grammarian. I think, however, the <hi>Order</hi> and <hi>Method,</hi> obſerved in this Epiſtle, is ſtricter than has yet been obſerved, and that the <hi>ſeries of rules</hi> is delivered with great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity; NOT <hi>enlivened by digreſſions,</hi> but paſſing from one topick to another, by the moſt natural and eaſy tranſitions. The Author's diſcrimination of the different ſtiles of the ſeveral ſpecies of poetry, leads him, as has been already ſhewn, to conſider THE DICTION of the Drama, and its accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the <hi>circumſtances</hi> and <hi>character</hi> of the Speaker. A recapitulation of theſe <hi>circumſtances</hi> carries him to treat of the due management of <hi>characters already known,</hi> as well as of ſuſtaining thoſe that are entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

                        <hi>original</hi>; to the firſt of which the Poet gives the preference, recommending <hi>known</hi> CHARACTERS, as well as <hi>known</hi> SUBJECTS: And on the mention of this joint preference, the Author leaves further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of <hi>the</hi> DICTION, and ſlides into diſcourſe upon <hi>the</hi> FABLE, which he continues down to the 152d verſa.

                        </q>
Having diſpatched <hi>the</hi> FABLE, the Poet proceeds, and with ſome Solemnity of Order, to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>the</hi> CHARACTERS; not in regard to ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>diction,</hi> for of that he has already ſpoken, but in reſpect to <hi>the manners</hi>; and, in this branch of his ſubject, he has as judiciouſly borrowed from <hi>the Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toricks</hi> of Ariſtotle, as in the reſt of his Epiſtle from the <hi>Poeticks.</hi> He then directs, in its due place, the proper conduct of particular INCIDENTS <hi>of the fable</hi>; after which he treats of the CHORUS; from whence he naturally falls into the <hi>hiſtory</hi> of theatrical MU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SICK; which is, as naturally, ſucceeded by an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Origin of <hi>the Drama</hi> itſelf, which the Poet commences, like his maſter Ariſtotle, even from the Dithyrambick Song, and carries it down
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0587000703:116"/>
to the eſtabliſhment of the New Greek Comedy; from whence he paſſes eaſily and gracefully, to <hi>the</hi> ROMAN STAGE, acknowledging the merits of the Writers, but pointing out their defects, and aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the cauſes. He then ſubjoins a few general ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, and concludes his long diſcourſe on <hi>the</hi> DRAMA, having extended it to 275 lines. This diſcourſe, together with the reſult of all his reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on Poets and Poetry, he then applies in the moſt earneſt and <hi>perſonal</hi> manner to <hi>the</hi> ELDER PISO; and with a long and moſt pathetick <hi>peroration,</hi> if I may adopt an oratorical term, concludes the Epiſtle.</p>

real life, which every man of ſenſe perceives, and <hi>feels</hi> the want of upon our ſtage; a want, which nothing but ſuch an expedient as the Chorus can poſſibly relieve. And, 2. The importance of its other office [l. 196] to the <hi>utility</hi> of the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, is ſo great, that, in a moral view, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can compenſate for this deficiency. For it is neceſſary to the truth and decorum of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, that the <hi>manners,</hi> bad as well as good, be drawn in ſtrong, vivid colours; and to that end that immoral ſentiments, forcibly expreſſed and ſpeciouſly maintained, be sometimes <hi>imputed</hi> to the ſpeakers. Hence the ſound philoſophy of the Chorus will be conſtantly wanting, to rectify the wrong concluſions of the audience, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ill impreſſions that might otherwiſe be made upon it. Nor let any one ſay, that the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is well able to do this for itſelf: Euripides did not find even an Athenian theatre ſo quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſighted. The ſtory is well known, [Sen. Ep. 115.] that when this painter of the <hi>manners</hi> was obliged, by the rules of his art, and the character to be ſuſtained, to put a run of bold ſentiments in the mouth of one of his perſons, the people inſtantly took fire, charging the poet with the <hi>imputed</hi> vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lainy, as though it had been his <hi>own.</hi> Now if
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0587000703:130"/>
ſuch an audience could ſo eaſily miſinterpret an attention to the truth of character into the real doctrine of the poet, and this too, when a Chorus was at hand to correct and diſabuſe their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, what muſt be the caſe, when the <hi>whole</hi> is left to the ſagacity and penetration of the people? The wiſer ſort, it is true, have little need of this information. Yet the reflections of ſober ſenſe on the courſe and occurrences of the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, clothed in the nobleſt dreſs of poetry, and enforced by the joint powers of <hi>harmony</hi> and <hi>action</hi> (which is the true character of the Chorus) might make it, even to such, a no unpleaſant or unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable entertainment. But theſe <hi>two</hi> are a ſmall part of the <hi>uſes</hi> of the Chorus; which in every light is ſeen ſo important to the truth, decorum, and dignity of the tragick ſcene, that the <hi>modern</hi> ſtage, which hath not thought proper to adopt it, is even, with the advantage of, ſometimes, the juſteſt moral painting and ſublimeſt imagery, but a very faint ſhadow of the <hi>old</hi>; as muſt needs appear to thoſe who have looked into the ancient models, or, diveſting themſelves of modern pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices, are diſpoſed to conſult the dictates of plain ſenſe.

                     <p>After two examples from Euripides; in one of which the truſty CHORUS conceals the premeditated <hi>ſuicide</hi> of Phaedra; and in the other abets Medea's intended <hi>murder of her children</hi>; both which are moſt ably vindicated by the Critick; the note concludes in theſe words.</p>
                     <q>In ſum, though theſe acts of ſevere avenging juſtice might not be according to the expreſs letter of the laws, or the more refined concluſions of the PORCH or ACADEMY; yet there is no doubt, that they were, in the general account, eſteemed
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0587000703:139"/>
fit and reaſonable. And, it is to be obſerved, in order to paſs a right judgment on the ancient Chorus, that, though in virtue of their office, they were obliged univerſally to ſuſtain a moral character; yet this moral was rather political and popular, than ſtrictly legal or philoſophic. Which is alſo founded on good reaſon. The ſcope and end of the ancient theatre being to ſerve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of virtue and ſociety, on the principles and ſentiments, already ſpread and admitted amongſt the people, and not to correct old errors, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them in philoſophic truth.</q>
                     <p>One of the cenſurers of Euripides, whoſe opinion is controverted in the above note, is Monſieur Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cier; who condemns <hi>the</hi> CHORUS in this inſtance, as not only violating their <hi>moral</hi> office, but <hi>tranſgreſſing the laws of</hi> NATURE <hi>and of</hi> GOD, <hi>by a fidelity</hi> so VICIOUS and CRIMINAL, <hi>that theſe women,</hi> [<hi>the</hi> CHORUS!] <hi>ought to fly away in the Car of Medea, to eſcape the puniſhment due to them.</hi> The Annotator above, agrees with the Greek Scholiaſt, that <hi>the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthian women</hi> (<hi>the</hi> CHORUS) <hi>being free,</hi> properly deſert the intereſts of Creon, and keep Medea's ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets, <hi>for the ſake of juſtice,</hi> according to their cuſtom. Dacier, however, urges an inſtance of their infidelity
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0587000703:140"/>
in the Ion of Euripides, where they betray the ſecret of Xuthus to Creuſa, which the French Critick de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends on account of their attachment to their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; and adds, that the rule of Horace, like other rules, is proved by the exception. <q rend="inline">"Beſides (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues the Critick in the true ſpirit of French gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry) ſhould we ſo heavily accuſe the Poet for not having made <hi>an aſſembly of women</hi> KEEP A SE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRET?"</q>
                        <hi>D'ailleurs, peut on faire un ſi grand crime à un poete, de n'avoir pas fait en ſorte qu'une troupe de femmes garde un ſecret?</hi> He then concludes his note with blaming Euripides for the perfidy of Iphigenia at Tauris, who abandons theſe faithful guardians of her ſecret, by flying alone with Oreſtes, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to the fury of Thoas, to which they muſt have been expoſed, but for the intervention of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva.</p>
                     <p>On the whole, it appears that the <hi>moral importance</hi> of <hi>the</hi> CHORUS muſt be conſidered <hi>with ſome limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions:</hi> or, at leaſt, that <hi>the</hi> CHORUS is as liable to be miſuſed and miſapplied, as any part of modern Tragedy.</p>

                        <p>That the poet's intention certainly was not to cenſure the <hi>falſe</hi> refinements of their ſtage-muſic; but, in a ſhort digreſſive hiſtory (ſuch as the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dactic form will ſometimes require) to deſcribe the riſe and progreſs of the <hi>true.</hi> This I collect, 1. From <hi>the expreſſion itſelf</hi>; which cannot, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out violence, be underſtood in any other way. For, as to the words <hi>licentia</hi> and <hi>praeceps,</hi> which have occaſioned much of the difficulty, the <hi>firſt</hi> means a <hi>freer uſe,</hi> not a <hi>licentiouſneſs,</hi> properly ſo called; and the <hi>other</hi> only expreſſes a vehemence and rapidity of language, naturally productive of a quicker elocution, ſuch as muſt of courſe attend the more numerous harmony of the lyre:—not, as M. Dacier tranſlates it, <hi>une eloquence temeraire et outrêe,</hi> an extravagant ſtraining and affectation of ſtyle. 2. From <hi>the reaſon of the thing;</hi> which makes it incredible, that the muſic of the theatre ſhould then be moſt complete, when the times were barbarous, and entertainments of this kind little
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0587000703:142"/>
encouraged or underſtood. 3. From <hi>the character of that muſic itſelf</hi>; for the rudeneſs of which, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, in effect, apologizes in defending it only on the ſcore of the imperfect ſtate of the ſtage, and the ſimplicity of its judges.</p>
                     </q>
                     <p>The above interpretation of this part of the Epiſtle is, in my opinion, extremely juſt, and exactly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds with the explication of De Nores, who cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures Madius for an error ſimilar to that of Dacier. <hi>Non rectè ſentire videtur Madius, dum putat potius</hi> IN ROMANORUM LUXURIAM <hi>invectum Horatium, quam</hi> DE MELODIAE INCREMENTO <hi>tractaſſe.</hi>

                     <p>THE MUSICK, having always been a neceſſary appendage to <hi>the</hi> CHORUS, I cannot (as has already been hinted in the note on l. 100 of this verſion) conſider the Poet's notice of the Pipe and Lyre, as a <hi>digreſſion,</hi> notwithſtanding it includes a ſhort hiſ<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tory of the rude ſimplicity of the Muſick in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

M. <hi>Dacier</hi> hath I know not what conceit about a compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Roman</hi> and <hi>Greek</hi> ſtage. His reaſon is, <hi>that the lyre was uſed in the Greek Chorus, as appears,</hi> he ſays, <hi>from Sophocles himſelf playing upon this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument himſelf in one of his tragedies.</hi> And was it not uſed too in the Roman Chorus, as appears from Nero's playing upon it in ſeveral tragedies? But the learned critic did not apprehend this matter. Indeed from the caution, with which his guides, the dealers in antiquities, always touch this point, it ſhould ſeem, that they too had no very clear conceptions of it. The caſe I take to have been this: The <hi>tibia,</hi> as being moſt proper to accompany the declamation of the acts, <hi>can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanti ſuccinere,</hi> was conſtantly employed, as well in the Roman tragedy as comedy. This appears from many authorities. I mention only two from
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0587000703:148"/>
Cicero. <hi>Quam multa</hi> [Acad. l. ii. 7.] <hi>quae nos fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giunt in cantu, exaudiunt in eo genere exercitati: Qui primo inflatu Tibicinis, Antiopam eſſe aiunt aut An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dromacham, cum nos ne ſuſpicemur quidem.</hi> The other is ſtill more expreſs. In his piece entitled <hi>Orator,</hi> ſpeaking of the negligence of the Roman writers, in reſpect of <hi>numbers,</hi> he obſerves, <hi>that there were even many paſſages in their tragedies, which, unleſs the</hi> TIBIA <hi>played to them, could not be dlſtinguiſhed from mere proſe: quae, niſi cum Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bicen acceſſerit, orationi ſint ſolutoe ſimillima.</hi> One of theſe paſſages is expreſsly quoted from <hi>Thyeſtes,</hi> a tragedy of <hi>Ennius</hi>; and, as appears from the meaſure, taken out of one of the acts. It is clear then, that the <hi>tibia</hi> was certainly uſed in the <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation</hi> of tragedy. But now the ſong of the tragic chorus, being of the nature of the ode, of courſe required <hi>fides,</hi> the lyre, the peculiar and appropriated inſtrument of the lyric muſe. And this is clearly collected, if not from expreſs teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timonies; yet from ſome occaſional hints dropt by the antients. For, 1. the lyre, we are told, [Cic. De Leg. ii. 9 &amp; 15.] and is agreed on all hands, was an inſtrument of the Roman theatre; but it was not employed in comedy. This we certainly know from the ſhort account of the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0587000703:149"/>
muſic prefixed to Terence's plays. 2. Further, the <hi>tibicen,</hi> as we ſaw, accompanied the declama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the acts in tragedy. It remains then, that the proper place of the lyre was, where one ſhould naturally look for it, in the ſongs of the Chorus; but we need not go further than this very paſſage for a proof. It is unqueſtionable, that the poet is here ſpeaking of the Chorus only; the following lines not admitting any other poſſible interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. By <hi>fidibus</hi> then is neceſſarily underſtood the inſtrument peculiarly uſed in it. Not that it need be ſaid that the <hi>tibia</hi> was never uſed in the Chorus. The contrary ſeems expreſſed in a paſſage of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca, [Ep. lxxxiv.] and in Julius Pollux [l. iv. 15: § 107.] It is ſufficient, if the <hi>lyre</hi> was uſed ſole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or principally, in it at this time. In this view, the whole digreſſion is more pertinent, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nects better. The poet had before been ſpeaking of tragedy. All his directions from l. 100, reſpect this ſpecies of the drama only. The application of what he had ſaid concerning muſic, is then moſt naturally made, 1. to the <hi>tibia,</hi> the muſic of the acts; and, 2. to <hi>fides,</hi> that of the choir: thus confining himſelf, as the tenor of this part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to tragedy only. Hence is ſeen the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take, not only of M. Dacier, whoſe comment is
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0587000703:150"/>
in every view inſupportable; but, as was hinted, of Heinſius, Lambin, and others, who, with more probability, explained this of the Roman comedy and tragedy. For, though <hi>tibia</hi> might be allowed to ſtand for comedy, as oppoſed to <hi>tragoedia,</hi> [as in fact, we find it in l. ii. Ep. 1.98,] that being the only inſtrument employed in it; yet, in ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſly of the muſic of the ſtage, <hi>fides</hi> could not determinately enough, and in contradiſtinction to <hi>tibia,</hi> denote that of tragedy, it being an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment uſed ſolely, or principally, in the Chorus; of which, the context ſhews, he alone ſpeaks. It is further to be obſerved, that, in the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion here made, beſides the muſic, the poet takes in the other improvements of the Tragic Chorus, theſe happening, as from the nature of the thing they would do, at the ſame time.</p>

                        <p>Of the uſe and propriety of theſe geſtures, or dances, it will not be eaſy for us, who ſee no ſuch things attempted on the modern ſtage, to form any very clear or exact notions. What we cannot doubt of is, 1. That the ſeveral theatrical dances of the antients were ſtrictly conformable to the genius of the different ſpecies of compoſition, to which they were applied. 2. That, therefore, the tragic dance, which more eſpecially accompanied the Chorus, muſt have been expreſſive of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gravity and decorum, tending to inſpire ideas of what is <hi>becoming, graceful,</hi> and <hi>majeſtic</hi>; in which view we cannot but perceive the important aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance it muſt needs lend to virtue, and how greatly it muſt contribute to ſet all her graces and attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the faireſt light. 3. This idea of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient tragic dance, is not ſolely formed upon our knowledge of the conformity before-mentioned; but is further collected from the name uſually given to it, which was <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">

                           </gap>, This word cannot well be tranſlated into our language; but expreſſes all that grace and concinnity of motion, which the dignity of the choral ſong required. 4. Laſtly, it
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0587000703:152"/>
muſt give us a very high notion of the moral effect of this dance, when we find the ſevere Plato ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting it into his commonwealth.</p>

Only it will be proper to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve one or two particulars, which have been greatly miſunderſtood, and without which it will be impoſſible, in any tolerable manner, to explain what follows.</p>
                        <p n="1">I. The deſign of the poet, in theſe lines, is not to fix the origin of the ſatyric piece, in aſcribing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0587000703:154"/>
the invention of it to Theſpis. This hath been concluded, without the leaſt warrant from his own words, which barely tell us, <q rend="inline">"that the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of tragedy was in elder Greece followed by the <hi>ſatires</hi>;"</q> and indeed the nature of the thing, as well as the teſtimony of all antiquity, ſhews it to be impoſſible. For the <hi>ſatire</hi> here ſpoken of is, in all reſpects, a regular drama, and therefore could not be of earlier date than the times of Aeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chylus, when the conſtitution of the drama was firſt formed. It is true indeed, there was a kind of entertainment of much greater antiquity, which by the antients is ſometimes called <hi>ſatyric,</hi> out of which (as Ariſtotle aſſures us) tragedy itſelf aroſe, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                              <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                           </gap> But then this was nothing but a Chorus of ſatyrs [Athenaeus, l. xiv.] celebrating the feſtivals of <hi>Bacchus,</hi> with rude ſongs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth dances; and had little reſemblance to that which was afterwards called <hi>ſatiric</hi>; which, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that it retained the Chorus of ſatyrs, and turned upon ſome ſubject relative to Bacchus, was of a quite different ſtructure, and, in every reſpect, as regular a compoſition as tragedy it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>
                        <p n="2">
                           <pb n="93" facs="tcp:0587000703:155"/>II. There is no doubt but the poem, here diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the name of SATYRI, was in actual uſe on the Roman ſtage. This appears from the turn of the poet's whole criticiſm upon it. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, his addreſs to the Piſos, l. 235 and his obſervation of the offence which a looſe dialogue in this drama would give to a <hi>Roman</hi> auditory, l. 248, make it evident that he had, in fact, the practice of his own ſtage in view.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. For the abſolute merit of theſe ſatires, the reader will judge of it himſelf by comparing the Cyclops, the only piece of this kind remaining to us from antiquity, with the rules here delivered by Horace. Only it may be obſerved, in addition to what the reader will find elſewhere [<hi>n.</hi> l. 223.] apologized in its favour, that the double character of the ſatires admirably fitted it, as well for a ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible entertainment to the wiſe, as for the ſport and diverſion of the vulgar. For, while the groteſque appearance and jeſting vein of theſe fantaſtic per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages amuſed the one, the other ſaw much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and conſidered them, at the ſame time, as replete with ſcience, and informed by a ſpirit of the moſt abſtruſe wiſdom. Hence important leſſons of civil prudence, intereſting alluſions to public

affairs, or a high, refined moral, might, with the higheſt probability, be inſinuated, under the ſlight cover of a ruſtic ſimplicity. And from this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive caſt, which from its nature muſt be very obſcure, if not impenetrable, to us at this day, was, I doubt not, derived the principal pleaſure which the antients found in this ſpecies of the drama. If the modern reader would conceive any thing of the nature and degree of this pleaſure, he may in part gueſs at it, from reflecting on the entertainment he himſelf receives from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of the clowns in Shakeſpeare; <hi>who,</hi> as the poet himſelf hath characterized them, <hi>uſe their folly, like a ſtalking horſe, and, under the preſentation of that, ſhoot their wit.</hi> [As you like it.]—</p>

an entertainment for their rude holiday audience, interſperſed the grave ſtrains of tragedy with comick and <hi>ſatyrical</hi> Interludes, producing thereby a kind of medley, ſomething congenial to what has appeared on our own ſtage, under the name of TRAGI-COMEDY. Nor, if I am able to read and comprehend the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text, do the words of Horace tell us, <q rend="inline">"that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of Tragedy was, in elder Greece, <hi>followed</hi> by <hi>the</hi> SATYRS."</q> The Satyrs compoſed a part of the Tragedy in its infancy, as well as in the days of Horace, if his own words may be quoted as authority.

that of which Horace ſpeaks in this place, cannot, I think, convey to us a very exact idea of <hi>the Tragick Paſtorals,</hi> whoſe <hi>origin</hi> he here deſcribes. <hi>The</hi> CY<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CLOPS, ſcarce exceeding 700 lines, might be played, according to the idea of ſome criticks, after another performance: but that cannot, without the greateſt violence to the text, be ſuppoſed of the ſatyrick piece here mentioned by Horace. The idea of <hi>farces,</hi> or <hi>after-pieces,</hi> tho' an inferior branch of the Drama, is, in fact, among the refinements of an improved age.

                           <hi>concerning that point thereby determined,</hi> yet it is to be noted, <hi>that he purpoſely deſcribes the Satyr.</hi> IN ITS RUDE AND LESS POLISHED FORM; <hi>glancing even at ſome barbarities, which deform</hi> THE BACCHIC CHORUS; WHICH WAS PROPERLY THE SATYRICK PIECE, <hi>before</hi> Aeſchylus had, by his regular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Drama, introduced it, <hi>under a very different form,</hi> on the ſtage."</q> In a ſubſequent note, the ſame learned Critick alſo ſays, that <q rend="inline">"the connecting particle, <hi>verum,</hi> [<hi>verum ita riſores, &amp;c.</hi>] expreſſes the oppoſition intended between the <hi>ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Satyr</hi> and that which the Poet approves."</q> In both theſe paſſages the ingenious Commentator ſeems, from the mere influence of the context, to approach to the interpretation that I have hazarded of this paſſage, avowedly one of the moſt obſcure parts of the Epiſtle.</p>
                     <p>The explanation of the words INCOLUMI GRA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VITATE, in the latter part of the above note, though favourable to the ſyſtem of the Engliſh Commentary, is not only contrary to the conſtruction of all other interpreters, and, I believe, unwarranted by any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptation of the word INCOLUMIS, but, in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, leſs elegant and forcible than the common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation.</p>

                     <p>The Commentators have given various explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of this precept. <hi>De Nores</hi> interprets it to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify <hi>that the ſame actor, who repreſented a God or Hero in the</hi> TRAGICK <hi>part of the Drama, muſt not be employed to repreſent a Faun or Sylvan in the</hi> SA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TYRICK.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dacier</hi> has a ſtrange conceit concerning the joint performance of a <hi>Tragedy</hi> and <hi>Atellane</hi> at one time, the ſame God or Hero being repreſented as the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſubject and character of both; on which occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, (ſays he) the Poet recommends to the author not to debaſe the God, or Hero of <hi>the</hi> TRAGEDY, by ſinking his language and manners too low in <hi>the</hi> ATELLANE; whoſe ſtyle, as well as meaſure, ſhould be peculiar to itſelf, equally diſtant from Tragedy and Farce.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0587000703:166"/>The author of the Engliſh Commentary tells us, that <q rend="inline">"Gods and Heroes were introduced as well into the <hi>Satyrick</hi> as <hi>Tragick</hi> Drama, and often the very ſame Gods and Heroes, which had borne a part in THE PRECEDING TRAGEDY; a practice, which Horace, I ſuppoſe, intended, by this hint, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend as moſt regular."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The two ſhort notes of Schrevelius, in my opinion, more clearly explain the ſenſe of Horace, and are in theſe words.</p>

                     <p>On the whole, ſuppoſing <hi>the</hi> SATYRICK <hi>Piece</hi> to be <hi>Tragi-Comick,</hi> as Dacier himſelf ſeems half in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to believe, the precept of Horace only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends to the author ſo to ſupport his principal perſonage, that his behaviour in the SATYRICK ſcenes ſhall not debaſe the character he has ſuſtained in the TRAGICK. No ſpecimen remaining of the Roman SATYRICK Piece, I may be permitted to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate the rule of Horace by a brilliant example from the <hi>ſerio-comick</hi> HISTORIES of the Sovereign of our Drama. The example to which I point, is the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0587000703:167"/>
character of <hi>the</hi> PRINCE <hi>of</hi> WALES, in the two Parts of <hi>Henry the Fourth.</hi> Such a natural and beautiful decorum is maintained in the diſplay of that cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that the <hi>Prince</hi> is as diſcoverable in the looſe ſcenes with Falſtaff and his aſſociates, as in the Preſence Chamber, or the Cloſet. After <hi>the natural,</hi> though MIXT DRAMAS, of Shakeſpear, and Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont and Fletcher, had prevailed on our ſtage, it is ſurpriſing that our progreſs to <hi>pure</hi> Tragedy and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy, ſhould have been interrupted, or diſturbed, by <hi>the regular monſter of</hi> TRAGI-COMEDY, nurſed by Southerne and Dryden.</p>

                     <q>The Greek Drama, we know, had its origin from the looſe, licentious raillery of the rout of Bacchus, indulging to themſelves the freeſt ſallies of taunt and invective, as would beſt ſuit to law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs natures, inſpirited by feſtal mirth, and made extravagant by wine.

                     <p>Horace having, after the example of his maſter Ariſtotle, ſlightly mentioned the firſt riſe of Tragedy in the form of a CHORAL SONG, ſubjoining an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>the</hi> SATYRICK CHORUS, that was ſoon (MOX <hi>etiam</hi>) combined with it, proceeds to ſpeak particularly of the Iambick verſe, which he has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned generally, as the meaſure beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated to the Drama. In this inſtance, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Poet has treſpaſſed againſt <hi>the order and method</hi> obſerved by his philoſophical guide; and by that treſpaſs broken the thread of his hiſtory of the Drama, which has added to the difficulty and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of this part of his Epiſtle.

If the reader would judge of the <hi>poetical beauty,</hi> as well as <hi>logical preciſion,</hi> of ſuch an arrangement, let him transfer this ſection of the Epiſtle [beginning, in the original at v. 251. and ending at 274,] to the end of the 284th line; by which tranſpoſition, or I am much miſtaken, he will

                     <p>The Engliſh reader, inclined to make the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment, muſt take the lines of the tranſlation from v. 268. to v. 403, both incluſive, and inſert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after v. 420.</p>

                     <p>It is ſurpriſing that Dacier, who, in a controverſial note, in refutation of Heinſius, has ſo properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked Horace's adherence to Ariſtotle, ſhould not have obſerved that his hiſtory of the Drama opens and proceeds nearly in the ſame order. Ariſtotle in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed does not name Theſpis, but we cannot but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his improvements among the changes, to which the Critick refers, before Tragedy acquired a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent form under Aeſchylus. Theſpis ſeems not only to have embodied <hi>the</hi> CHORUS, but to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a theatrical apparatus for an itinerant exhibition; to have furniſhed diſguiſes for his performers, and to have broken the continuity of <hi>the</hi> CHORUS by an <hi>Interlocutor</hi>; to whom Aeſchylus adding another per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, thereby firſt created DRAMATICK DIA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOGUE; while at the ſame time by a <hi>further diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the</hi> CHORUS, by improving the dreſſes of the actors, and drawing them from their travelling waggon to a fixt ſtage, he created <hi>a regular theatre.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0587000703:173"/>It appears then that neither Horace, nor Ariſtotle, aſcribe <hi>the origin</hi> of Tragedy to THESPIS. The Poet firſt mentions the rude beginning of Tragedy, <hi>(carmen tragicum) the</hi> GOAT-SONG; he then ſpeaks of <hi>the Satyrick Chorus,</hi> ſoon after interwoven with it; and then proceeds to the <hi>improvements</hi> of theſe Bacchic Feſtivities, by Theſpis, and Aeſchylus; though their perfection and final eſtabliſhment is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed by Ariſtotle to Sophocles.</p>
                     <p>DACIER very properly renders this paſſage, <hi>On dit que Theſpis fut le premier qui inventa</hi> UNE ESPECI DE TRAGEDIE AUPARAVANT INCONNUE AUX GRECS. <q rend="inline">"Theſpis is ſaid to be the firſt inventor of <hi>a ſpecies</hi> of Tragedy, <hi>before unknown to the Greeks.</hi>"</q>

                        <p>This judgment of the poet, recommending do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick ſubjects, as fitteſt for the ſtage, may be inforced from many obvious reaſons. As, 1. that it renders the drama infinitely more <hi>affecting:</hi> and this on many accounts, 1. As a ſubject, taken from our own annals, muſt of courſe carry with it an air of greater probability, at leaſt to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the people, than one borrowed from
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0587000703:177"/>
thoſe of any other nation. 2. As we all find a perſonal intereſt in the ſubject. 3. As it of courſe affords the beſt and eaſieſt opportunities of catch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our minds, by frequent references to our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, prejudices, and cuſtoms. And of how great importance this is, may be learned from hence, that, even in the exhibition of foreign charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, dramatic writers have found themſelves obliged to ſacrifice truth and probability to the humour of the people, and to dreſs up their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages, contrary to their own better judgment, in ſome degree according to the mode and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of their reſpective countries<note n="*" place="bottom">

                           </note>. And, 4. as the writer himſelf, from an intimate acquaintance with the character and genius of his own nation,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0587000703:178"/>
will be more likely to draw the manners with life and ſpirit.</p>
                        <p n="2">II. Next, which ſhould ever be one great point in view, it renders the drama more generally uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in its moral deſtination. For, it being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant about domeſtic acts, the great inſtruction of the fable more ſenſibly affects us; and the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters exhibited, from the part we take in their good or ill qualities, will more probably influence our conduct.</p>
                        <p n="3">III. Laſtly, this judgment will deſerve the greater regard, as the conduct recommended was, in fact, the practice of our great models, the Greek writers; in whoſe plays, it is obſervable, there is ſcarcely a ſingle ſcene, which lies out of the confines of Greece.</p>
                        <p>But, notwithſtanding theſe reaſons, the practice hath, in all times, been but little followed. The Romans, after ſome few attempts in this way (from whence the poet took the occaſion of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livering it as a dramatic precept), ſoon relapſed into their old uſe; as appears from Seneca's, and the titles of other plays, written in, or after the Auguſtan age. Succeeding times continued the
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0587000703:179"/>
ſame attachment to Grecian, with the addition of an equal fondneſs for Roman, ſubjects. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in both inſtances hath been ever the ſame: that ſtrong and early prejudice, approaching ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to adoration, in favour of the illuſtrious names of thoſe two great ſtates. The account of this matter is very eaſy; for their writings, as they furniſh the buſineſs of our younger, and the amuſement of our riper, years; and more eſpecially make the ſtudy of all thoſe, who devote themſelves to poetry and the ſtage, inſenſibly infix in us an exceſſive veneration for all affairs in which they were concerned; inſomuch, that no other ſubjects or events ſeem conſiderable enough, or riſe, in any proportion, to our ideas of the dignity of the tragick ſcene, but ſuch as time and long admiration have conſecrated in the annals of their ſtory. Our Shakeſpeare was, I think, the firſt that broke through this bondage of claſſical ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition. And he owed this felicity, as he did ſome others, to his want of what is called the advantage of a learned education. Thus uninfluenced by the weight of early prepoſſeſſion, he ſtruck at once into the road of nature and common ſenſe: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out deſigning, without knowing it, hath left us in his hiſtorical plays, with all their anomalies,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0587000703:180"/>
an exacter reſemblance of the Athenian ſtage, than is any where to be found in its moſt profeſſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirers and copyiſts.</p>
                        <p>I will only add, that, for the more ſucceſsful execution of this rule of celebrating domeſtic acts, much will depend on the aera, from whence the ſubject is taken. Times too remote have almoſt the ſame inconveniences, and none of the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, which attend the ages of Greece and Rome. And for thoſe of later date, they are too much fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarized to us, and have not as yet acquired that venerable caſt and air, which tragedy demands, and age only can give. There is no fixing this point with preciſion. In the general, that aera is the fitteſt for the poet's purpoſe, which, though freſh enough in our minds to warm and intereſt us in the event of the action, is yet at ſo great a diſtance from the preſent times, as to have loſt all thoſe mean and diſparaging circumſtances, which unavoidably adhere to recent deeds, and, in ſome meaſure, ſink the nobleſt modern tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions to the level of ordinary life.</p>

                        <p>Nothing in the art requires more attention and judgment, or more of that power of diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which may not improperly be called Genius, than the ſteering between general ideas and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduality; for though the body of the whole muſt certainly be compoſed by the firſt, in order to communicate a character of grandeur to the whole, yet a daſh of the latter is ſometimes neceſſary to give an intereſt. An individual model, copied with ſcrupulous exactneſs, makes a mean ſtyle like the Dutch; and the neglect of an actual model, and the method of proceeding ſolely from idea, has
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0587000703:185"/>
a tendency to make the Painter degenerate into a manneriſt.</p>
                        <p>It is neceſſary to keep the mind in repair, to replace and refreſhen thoſe impreſſions of nature, which are continually wearing away.</p>
                        <p>A circumſtance mentioned in the life of Guido, is well worth the attention of Artiſts: He was aſked from whence he borrowed his idea of beauty, which is acknowledged ſuperior to that of every other Painter; he ſaid he would ſhew all the models he uſed, and ordered a common Porter to ſit before him, from whom he drew a beautiful countenance; this was intended by Guido as an exaggeration of his conduct; but his intention was to ſhew that he thought it neceſſary to have <hi>ſome model</hi> of nature before you, however you deviate from it, and correct it from the idea which you have formed in your mind of <hi>perfect beauty.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>In Painting it is far better to have a <hi>model</hi> even to <hi>depart</hi> from, than to have nothing fixed and certain to determine the idea: There is ſomething then to proceed on, ſomething to be corrected; ſo that even ſuppoſing that no part is taken, the model has ſtill been not without uſe.</p>

The DIDACTICK and the EPISTOLARY ſtile were never more happily blended. The Poet aſſumes the air of a father adviſing his ſon, rather than of a teacher inſtructing his pupils. Many Criticks have thrown out a curſory obſervation or two, as it were extorted from them by the pointed expreſſions of the Poet: but none of them, that I have conſulted, have attempted to aſſign any reaſon, why Horace, having cloſed his particular precepts, addreſſes all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of his Epiſtle, on the nature and expediency of Poetical purſuits, to <hi>the</hi> ELDER PISO only. I have endeavoured to give the moſt natural reaſon for this conduct; a reaſon which, if I am not deceived, renders the whole of the Epiſtle intereſting, as well as clear and conſiſtent; a reaſon which I am the more inclined to think ſubſtantial, as it confirms in great meaſure the ſyſtem of the Author of the Engliſh

                     <p>I have endeavoured, after the example of the learned and ingenious author of the Engliſh Commentary, though on ſomewhat different principles, to prove <q rend="inline">"an unity of deſign in this Epiſtle,"</q> as well as to illuſtrate <q rend="inline">"the pertinent connection of its ſeveral parts."</q> Many perhaps, like myſelf, will heſitate to embrace the ſyſtem of that acute Critick; and as many, or more, may reject my hypotheſis. But I am thoroughly perſuaded that no perſon, who has conſidered this work of Horace with due attention, and carefully examined the drift and intention of the writer, but will at leaſt be convinced of the folly or blindneſs, or haſte and careleſſneſs of thoſe Criticks, however diſtinguiſhed, who have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced it to be a crude, unconnected, immethodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, and inartificial compoſition. No modern, I believe, ever more intently ſtudied, or more clearly underſtood the works of Horace, than BOILEAU. His Art of Poetry is deſervedly admired. But I am ſurpriſed that it has never been obſerved that the Plan of that work is formed on the model of this Epiſtle, though ſome of the parts are more in detail, and others varied, according to the age and country of the writer. The firſt Canto, like the firſt Section of <hi>the Epiſtle to the Piſos,</hi> is taken up in general pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts. The ſecond enlarges on the Lyrick, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0587000703:205"/>
Elegiack, and ſmaller ſpecies of Poetry, but cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorily mentioned, or referred to, by Horace; but introduced by him into that part of the Epiſtle, that runs exactly parallel with the ſecond Canto of Boi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leau's Art of Poetry. The third Canto treats, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely on the ground of Horace, of Epick and Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick Poetry; though the French writer has, with great addreſs, accommodated to his purpoſe what Horace has ſaid but collaterally, and as it were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally, of the Epick. The laſt Canto is formed on the final ſection, the laſt hundred and eleven lines, of <hi>the Epiſtle to the Piſos:</hi> the author however, judiciouſly omitting in a profeſſed Art of Poetry, the deſcription of the Frantick Bard, and concluding his work, like the Epiſtle to Auguſtus, with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to the Sovereign.</p>
                     <p>This imitation I have not pointed out, in order to depreciate the excellent work of Boileau; but to ſhew that, in the judgment of ſo great a writer, the method of Horace was not ſo ill conceived, as Scaliger pretends, even for the outline of an Art of Poetry: Boileau himſelf, at the very concluſion of his laſt Canto, ſeems to avow and glory in the charge of having founded his work on that of HORACE.</p>

                     <p>Many paſſages of this Dedication, as well as other pieces of Dryden's proſe, have been verſified by Pope. His opinion alſo, on the Epiſtle to the Piſos, is ſaid to have agreed with that of Dryden; though the Introduction to his Imitation of the Epiſtle to Auguſtus forbids us to ſuppoſe he entertained the like ſentiments of that work with his great prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor. His general idea of Horace ſtands recorded in a moſt admirable didactick poem; in the courſe of which he ſeems to have kept a ſteady eye on this work of our author.</p>

                  <p>☞ I have now compleated my obſervations on this popular Work of Horace, of which I at firſt attempted the verſion and illuſtration, as a matter of amuſement; but which, I confeſs, I have felt, in the progreſs, to be an arduous undertaking, and a laborious taſk. Such parts of the Epiſtle, as cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded with the general ideas of Modern Poetry, and the Modern Drama, I flattered myſelf with the hopes of rendering tolerable to the Engliſh Reader;
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0587000703:209"/>
but when I arrived at thoſe paſſages, wholly relative to the Antient Stage, I began to feel my friends dropping off, and leaving me a very thin audience. My part too grew leſs agreeable, as it grew more difficult. I was almoſt confounded in the ſerio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comick ſcenes of the Satyrick Piece: In the muſical department I was ready, with Le Fevre, to execrate the Flute, and all the Commentators on it; and when I found myſelf reduced to ſcan the merits and demerits of Spondees and Trimeters, I almoſt fancied myſelf under the dominion of ſome <hi>plagoſus Orbilius,</hi> and tranſlating the <hi>proſodia</hi> of the Latin Grammar. Borrowers and Imitators cull the ſweets, and ſuck the claſſick flowers, rejecting at pleaſure all that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſour, bitter, or unpalatable. Each of them travels at his eaſe in the high turnpike-road of poetry, quoting the authority of Horace himſelf to keep clear of difficulties;

                  <p>The reader, I fear, will fancy I rejoice too much at having broke looſe from my bondage, and that I grow wanton with the idea of having regained my liberty. I ſhall therefore engage an advocate to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend me to his candour and indulgence; and as I introduced theſe notes with ſome lines from a noble Poet of our own country, I ſhall conclude them with an extract from a French Critick: Or, if I may ſpeak the language of my <hi>trade,</hi> as I opened theſe annotations with a <hi>Prologue</hi> from ROSCOMMON, I ſhall drop the curtain with <hi>an Epilogue</hi> from DA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CIER. Another curtain now demands my attention. I am called from the contemplation of Antient Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, to ſacrifice, with due reſpect, to Modern Taſte: I am ſummoned from a review of the mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent ſpectacles of Greece and Rome, to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hearſal of a Farce at the Little Theatre in the Hay-market.</p>
                  <q>
                     <p>Voila tout ce que j'ai cru neceſſaire pour l'in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence de la Poetique d'Horace! ſi Jule Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liger l'avoit bien entendue, il lui auroit rendu plus de juſtice, &amp; en auroit parlé plus modeſtement.
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0587000703:211"/>
Mais il ne s'eſtoit pas donnê la temps de le bien comprendre. Ce Livre eſtoit trop petit pour eſtre gouté d'un homme comme lui, qui faiſoit grand cas des gros volumes, &amp; qui d'ailleurs aimoit bien mieux donner des regles que d'en recevoir. Sa Poetique eſt aſſurément un ouvrage d'une erudition infinie; on y trouve par tout des choſes fort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherchées, &amp; elle eſt toute pleine de ſaillies qui marquent beaucoup d'eſprit: mais j'oſerai dire qu'il n'y a point de juſteſſe dans la pluſpart de ſes jugemens, &amp; que ſa critique n'eſt pas heureuſe. Il devoit un peu plus etudier ces grands maitres, pour ſe corriger de ce defaut, qui rendra toujours le plus grand ſavoir inutile, ou au moins rude &amp; ſec. Comme un homme delicat etanchera mille fois mieux ſa ſoif, &amp; boira avec plus de goût &amp; de plaiſir dans un ruiſſeau dont les eaux ſeront clairs &amp; pures, que dans un fleuve plein de bourbe &amp; de limon: tout de même, un eſprit fin qui ne cherche que la juſteſſe &amp; une certaine fleur de critique, trouvera bien mieux ſon compte dans ce petite traité d'Horace, qu'il ne le trouverait dans vingt volumes auſſi enormes que la Poetique de Scaliger. On peut dire veritablement que celuy qui boit dans cette ſource pure, <hi>pleno ſe proluit auro;</hi> &amp; tant pis pour celuy qui ne ſait pas le

connoiſtre. Pour moi j'en ai un tres grand cas, Je ne ſay fi j'auray eſté aſſez heureux pour la bien éclaircir, &amp; pour en diſſiper ſi bien toutes les dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficultés, qu'il n'y en reſte aucune. Les plus grandes de ces difficultés, viennent des paſſages qu'Horace a imité des Grecs, ou des alluſions qu'il y a faites. Je puis dire au moins que je n'en ay laiſſé paſſer aucune ſans l'attaquer; &amp; je pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rois me vanter,

                     <p>En general je puis dire que malgré la foule des Commentateurs &amp; des Traducteurs, Horace eſtoit tres-malentendu, &amp; que ſes plus beaux endroits eſtoient défigurés par les mauvais ſens qu'on leur avoit donnés juſques icy, &amp; il ne faut pas s'en étonner. La pluſpart des gens ne reconnoiſſent pas tant l'autoritè de la raiſon que celle du grand nombre, pour laquelle ils ont un profond reſpect. Pour moy qui ſay qu'en matiere de critique on ne doit pas comptez les voix, mais les peſer; j'avoüe que j'ay ſecoüé ce joug, <hi>&amp; que ſans m'aſſujetir au ſentiment de perſonne, j'ay tâché de ſuivre Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>race, &amp; de démêler ce qu'il a dit d'avec ce qu'on luy a fait dire.</hi> J'ay meſme toûjours remarqué

               <p>WERE we to analyſe the Literary Merits of Dr. Johnſon, perhaps an accurate Critick would aſcribe his higheſt praiſe to his labours in Biography.

At preſent, however, I ſhall only ſay, that this train of thought gave birth to the following Epigram, which (if you pleaſe) you may hitch into your Poet's Corner.</p>

                  <l>WELCOME, ye Generous, Polite, and Fair,</l>
                  <l>Who to our lowly Roof this Night repair!</l>
                  <l>Who come, invited by our humble Bill,</l>
                  <l>To the Old Theatre on Richmond Hill;</l>

                  <l>No Theatre we boaſt ſuperbly built,</l>
                  <l>A Gingerbread Round O, a Cock-pit gilt;</l>
                  <l>But a plain Booth, of Boards ill put together,</l>

                  <l>Here Tragedy ſhall take three narrow Strides;</l>
                  <l>And laughing Comedy hold both her Sides:</l>
                  <l>Here ſhall the Moor ſay—"Haply for I am black!"</l>
                  <l>And here plump Falſtaff—"Give me a Cup of Sack,"</l>
                  <l>Here Bobadill ſhall don his dirty Buff,</l>
                  <l>And cry—"the Cabin is convenient enough."</l>

                  <l>Were of thoſe days the Darby and Old Joan.—</l>
                  <l>In Wicker-Chair well-pleas'd the Thunderer ſat,</l>
                  <l>Laugh'd, ſung, drank, ſmok'd, and join'd their ruſtick chat:</l>

                  <l>IN Fletcher's days it was the favourite plan</l>

                  <l>Their Virtue nought could ſhake, no ſiege could alter:</l>
                  <l>A rock, impregnable as Gibraltar!</l>
                  <l>In vain were ſighs, and tears, and idle flattery,</l>
                  <l>Their red-hot balls laid low each hoſtile battery,</l>

                  <l>I am an author too, my name is Bayes;</l>

                  <l>'Tis no work of Science, or ſparkle of Wit,</l>

                  <l>All means muſt be tried, and our Drama ſhows one.</l>

The Epilogue was written at the particular inſtance of a very worthy friend of Mr. Jephſon, by whom and by the author it was received with cordial thanks and the warmeſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation. Mrs. Siddons however ſeeming to expect the Epilogue, her Importance to the Piece rendered the friends of the Author unwilling to queſtion her Claim, and a few alterations were made in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductory lines, which the change of the Suppoſed Speaker required.—<hi>Suppoſed,</hi> for Mrs. Siddons, after keeping the Epilogue ſome days, returned it with a declaration that ſhe would not ſpeak it; and a requeſt of another. The alterations, with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional couplet, occurred between the 6th and 13th lines, and are here ſubjoined with the variations printed in Italicks.</p>

                  <l>I Am a poor Strolling Player—and my hapleſs condition</l>
                  <l>Obliges me to wait upon you with my Humble Petition.</l>
                  <l>Thro' England, South Wales, and North Wales,</l>
                  <l>I have travell'd many years ſince,</l>
                  <l>And repreſented Lover and Hero, Wit and Fool,</l>
                  <l>Stateſman and Cuckold, Beggar and Prince;</l>
                  <l>Nay more than Roſcius, Betterton, Booth, or Garrick himſelf could ſay,</l>
                  <l>I have acted every part—women as well as men—every part in every play.</l>
                  <l>Not long ago, at Oſweſtry, we did the falchion wield:</l>
                  <l>Now near this place we pitch our tent—very near here—even in Wrexham <hi>Field</hi>;</l>
                  <l>By Metaphor I ſay <hi>Field,</hi> for in fact, at a very great expence,</l>
                  <l>We have fitted up the Town Hall, and (for the firſt time) made it the Theatre of Common Senſe.</l>

                  <l>And what I am ſure in our cauſe will make you very hearty,</l>
                  <l>The little Manager from the Hay-market is one of the party.</l>
                  <l>They call themſelves <hi>Gentlemen</hi> indeed, but ſtill I ſay ſo much the worſe!</l>
                  <l>For when Gentlemen act unlike Gentlemen, 'tis a private and a publick curſe.</l>
                  <l>Why ſhould a Gentleman pretend to more than he underſtands,</l>
                  <l>Take the bread out of our mouths, and our trade out of our hands?</l>
                  <l>All arts are beſt executed by the artiſts themſelves;</l>
                  <l>Gentlemen Artiſts are moſtly mere Dabblers and ignorant Elves.</l>
                  <l>Says Sir John, his round hat on his head, a Quid in his mouth, and long Whip in his hand,</l>

                  <l>Such are Baronet Drivers! and thus Country Squires hunt a pack, or ride matches;</l>
                  <l>Thus Generals write plays, and thus Nobles ſing Catches,</l>
