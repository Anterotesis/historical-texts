            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO JOHN COWLEY, ESQ.</head>
            <p>WHEN letters were in their inſancy, and when knowledge and the arts were groping their way through ſeemingly impervious miſts, ſome ſplendid name was neceſſary to give an author celebrity—hence the cuſtom of DEDICATIONS; hence thoſe f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oods of adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which poured from the preſs, and outraged the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the addreſſer and the addreſſed.</p>
            <p>But now, when poets and writers of every denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, accept patronage only from the public, and when fame is to be obtained only by deſerving it, the cuſtom of dedicating can be continued, only, as a medium through which to convey perſonal reſpect. It is <hi>delightful</hi> to make an offering to thoſe we love, when that offering has had a value ſtampt on it, by the voice of the world. Thus THE FATE OF SPARTA wreathed with laurel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When I hinted an intention to addreſs this Tragedy to you, you ſhrunk from the idea, and deſired me to chooſe a worthier name. My deareſt Brother, where ſhall I

turn to find it? THIS ſhall <hi>not</hi> be an addreſs of adula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, therefore I ſhall only obſerve, that thoſe to whom you are known, will acknowledge that I am juſtified in the choice I have made of a patron; and thoſe who know you not, will do my pride the credit to believe I ſhould not have ſelected for that patron, a man whoſe name and whoſe ſituation did not reflect honour on me.</p>
            <p>There is yet another motive for uſing my <hi>poetic wand</hi> to call your ſhade before poſterity. As your regard has been one of the chief bleſſings of my life, I wiſh thoſe who ſucceed us to know how much I hold myſelf indebted to it: I wiſh my own children and yours to feel the ſweet inf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

DEAR Children! who will wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der again and again over this page, after the hand which traces it moves no more, after the heart to which it is addreſſed, hath ceaſed to beat!</p>
            <p>I was going to conclude with this penſive idea, but I recollect that I have not yet mentioned in <hi>d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

He, though my hero, is not "a faultleſs monſter;"—if the lady ſhould be <hi>too perfect,</hi> I appeal to the grave authority of Plutarch, who I believe is not ſuſpected of writing fictions to compliment women.</p>

            <p>How much the FATE OF SPARTA has been indebted to that lady, and to ſome of the other performers, the public prints bear teſtimony—and I gratefully record it: becauſe it is a circumſtance highly flattering to myſelf, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I wiſh the preſent I thus offer you, to be ſurrounded with every appendage that can make you feel it ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable.</p>
