            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Worthy SIR,</salute>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S the following Diſſertations owe their birth to your judicious choice of the ſubject, and liberal encouragement of it, they now naturally wait upon you for your protection and countenance. Your original deſign having been only to excite a noble emulation among the youth of an infant Seminary, in a remote part of the world, and to turn their early attention to a matter of very high and national importance, you will not look for any thing in the execution beyond their years, their experience, or opportunities of information.</p>
            <p>YOUR known candor will likewiſe lead you to conſider the peculiar difficulties, ariſing from the times and circumſtances, in which theſe pieces were compoſed. An act of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament had become the
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0151302000:11"/>fatal cauſe of an unhappy breach of that UNION which had ſo long ſubſiſted (and ever ought to ſubſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>) between the Colonies and the mother country; and very general were the agitations and uneaſineſs thereby produced on this ſide of the <hi>Atlantic.</hi> Even hoary age, and men of the moſt ſubdued paſſions among us, admi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ting the moſt plenary juriſdiction of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, could not, in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe, but conſider their conduct as at leaſt unkind to their <hi>American</hi> fellow ſubjects, in deſiring (without any preſent neceſſity that appeared to us) to come between us and our Sovereign, and to lay a foundation which might eaſily have b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>en drawn into a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for depriving us of all future oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of teſtifying our loyalty, by the free and voluntary grant of our own money.</p>
            <p>If, then, ſuch was the light in which the <hi>cool</hi> and the <hi>aged</hi> conſidered this matter, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of a warmer and more unguarded kind might have dropt from the pens of youth! Yet no ſuch thing appears in the following Diſſertations, which are laid before the public in the genuine form and dreſs wherein they were preſented by their authors.
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0151302000:12"/>Nor was it poſſible that the ſmalleſt additions or alterations could be made conſiſtent with the plan purſued in the execution of your truſt; which plan you ought to have an account of, and it may alſo be of uſe to preſerve it here, by way of precedent for future occaſions of the like kind.</p>
            <p>SEVERAL conſiderations having prevented the Truſtees of the College from propoſing your MEDALS to be contended for by the youth, the firſt year after the receipt of them; they were at laſt propoſed, by an adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſement as follows, viz.</p>

                  <p>WHEREAS John Sargent, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant in London, and member of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, hath preſented to this College a<note n="*" place="bottom">Only ſo much of the advertiſement is here inſerted as relates to the diſpoſition of the Medal, which produced the following Eſſays; Mr. Sargent's other Medal not being yet diſpoſed of.</note> GOLD MEDAL, for the beſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> eſſay <hi>on the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual</hi> UNION <hi>between</hi> Great-Britain <hi>and her</hi> Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican <hi>Colonies.</hi>— Notice is hereby given, by order of the Truſtees, that the ſaid <hi>Medal</hi> will be diſpoſed of at the enſuing
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0151302000:13"/>commencement in <hi>May,</hi> for the beſt eſſay that ſhall be produced on the ſubject pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, by any of thoſe who have received any degree, or part of their education in this College—And as the ſaid ſubject is one of the moſt important which can at this time employ the pen of the <hi>patriot</hi> or <hi>ſcholar,</hi> and is thus left open to all thoſe who have had any connection with this College, either as ſtudents or graduates, it is hoped, for the honour of the Seminary, as well as their own, they will nobly exert themſelves on a ſubject ſo truly animating, which may be treated in a manner alike intereſting to good men, both here and in the mother country.</p>
                  <p>Each candidate is deſired to prefix a motto, and a mark or device to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, and ſeal it up, without his name, in a ſeparate cover. He is then to put his name under another ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aled cover, writing on the outſide of this cover the ſame motto and mark or device, which he has prefixed to his performance.</p>
                  <p>THE utmoſt impartiality will be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by the Truſtees and Profeſſors in
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0151302000:14"/>examining the ſeveral performances, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out opening any of the covers that contain the names, till it is firſt determined which of the performances is entitled to the Medal, and then only that cover will be opened on which the motto is written that directs to the name of the perſon entitled to the prize, which ſhall be given in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic at the enſuing commencement; and therefore the ſeveral candidates are deſired to ſend their compoſitions and names ſealed and covered as aforeſaid, to the Provoſt, on or before the 8th day of <hi>May.</hi>—</p>
               </body>
            </floatingText>
            <p>ON the 8th day of <hi>May</hi> accordingly nine different performances were produced, on a careful peruſal of which, the three im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following were laid aſide for a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond reading; after which the Medal was unan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>mouſly decreed to the firſt. The ſecond alſo was judged a maſterly, judicious and ſenſible performance, worthy of a Medal alſo, if there had been another for the ſame ſubject; and the third was likewiſe greatly approved of as a ſpirited performance, ſo far as it went; and it was agreed that the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of both, together with the prize-piece,
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0151302000:15"/>would be of ſervice at this criſis; which determination was immediately inſerted in the public papers; in purſuance whereof the modeſt and ingenious youth, who is author of the ſecond Diſſertation, gave leave to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh it with his name. The author of the third Diſſertation, wrote, concerning his piece, that he <q>had but two days to ſpare, from a particular hurry of buſineſs in his profeſſion, to prepare it in; and that ſo far from thinking it diſgraced by being the third beſt, he would have rejoiced, for the honor of the Seminary in which he received his firſt education, if all the other ſix had been ſuperior alſo; and that if there were any obſervations in it which had not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to the other gentlemen, or were likely to ſerve as hints for abler pens to ſet ſo important a ſubject in a proper light, he readily conſented to its publication; but requeſted, for particular reaſons, that his name might not be annexed to it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE fourth little piece is the production of an ingenious ſon of the college, in his own eaſy unpremeditated way. He has by many compoſitions done honor to the place of his
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0151302000:16"/>education; and by this, which was only the ſudden work of a few hours of that day, in which the other pieces were under exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, he meant not to come in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition for the prize, but only to throw his mite into the general ſtock. After his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture to <hi>England,</hi> ſome of his friends having deſired it to be publiſhed, with the three firſt pieces, it was accordingly annexed; and had any of the authors of the other five remaining pieces, or their friends, made the like requeſt, they would have been indulged in it. Indeed moſt of them would have well deſerved to be laid before the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, had we not been afraid that the repetition of many of the ſame ſentiments, which muſt unavoidably run through them all, on the ſame ſubject, would at length become tire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome to the reader.</p>
            <p>WE have only now to mention the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of the following Eulogium. By your own propoſal, as well as by order of the Truſtees of the College, the Medal was to be conferred at a public commencement, Wherefore, at the commencement, <hi>May</hi> 20th, 1766, immediately after the valedic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0151302000:17"/>oration, the Hon. JOHN PENN, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Governor of the province, as Preſident of the Truſtees of the College, delivered the <hi>Medal</hi> to the Provoſt, ordering him to confer it in public agreeable to their previous deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. The Provoſt accordingly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the audience that the ſame had been decreed to JOHN MORGAN, M.D. F.R.S. &amp;c. and profeſſor of the theory and practice of phyſic in the College of <hi>Philadelphia;</hi> and then requeſted Dr. <hi>Morgan</hi> to deliver his Diſſertation in public; which being finiſhed, the EULOGIUM accompanied the conferring of the Medal.</p>

            <p>AS the reward of your great merit in this elegant performance, I am, in the name of the Truſtees and Faculty of this College, as well as in behalf of the worthy Donor, to beg your acceptance of this GOLD MEDAL—Its intrinſic value may not be an object of much conſideration to you; but the truly honourable circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, by which it now becomes yours, muſt render it one of the moſt valuable jewels in your poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0151302000:19"/>ADORNED tho' you have been with honors in diſtant lands, yet we truſt thoſe will not be the leaſt acceptable to you, which your native country beſtows.</p>

               <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> who, by her liberality, had raiſed this College from a helpleſs to a flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing ſtate, had an undoubted demand on us, in our particular capacity, for all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of gratitude.

            <p>THE occaſion now calls me to addreſs a few things to you, Gentlemen, who have juſt received your degrees in this Seminary; but I would not treſpaſs on the patience of this candid audience.</p>

            <p>WHAT we have often given in ſolemn charge to thoſe who have gone before you, and what you have often heard delivered in the courſe of your ſtudies here, is, I hope, engraven on your memories, and need not now be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated.</p>
            <p>YOU will conſider all arts, all ſciences, all eloquence, all philoſophy, as intended to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline the ſoul for eternity, and ſo far as they center not ultimately in this grand view, they are at beſt but empty trifles.

            <p>WHEN I look back on the dreadful ſtate of ſuſpence, in which theſe Colonies have been ſo long agitated; when, in the room of foreboding doubt and painful ſollicitude, I behold joy in every look, the clouds diſperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the ſun breaking in upon us again, and

            <p>O GLORIOUS day! O happy <hi>America!</hi> if now we but know how to prize our happineſs— The unguarded ſallies of intemperate zeal will ſoon be forgotten; but the ſtedfaſt, the noble, the patriotic efforts of cool and good men, in the vindication of native and conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional rights, will more and more claim the regard of all the Free, in every clime and age; and perhaps be conſecrated by time into one of the brighteſt tranſactions of our ſtory; aſſerting our pedigree, and ſhewing that we were worthy of having been deſcended from the illuſtrious ſtock of <hi>Britons!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE cauſe of Liberty, Civil and Religious, is the cauſe of <hi>Britain</hi> herſelf—nay it is the cauſe of heaven; and it was with inexpreſſible ſatisfaction that I beheld more than one of the gentlemen, who have written on the ties of UNION between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, deriving a very capital argument from the ties of a Common Religion.</p>
            <p>

            </p>
            <p>CIVIL Liberty, the Proteſtant Religion, the principles of Toleration, in their purity, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable as they are to human nature, ſubſiſt but in few places of the globe; and <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is their principal reſidence.</p>

            <p>THIS ſentiment, it is hoped, will more and more gain ground among good men both here and in the mother country; convincing them that to check the ſpirit of Freedom, or diſcourage the propagation of knowledge here in <hi>America,</hi> would, on the part of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi>

            <p>ANIMATED by theſe principles, and guided by an enlightened zeal, it will become us to manifeſt our gratitude and love to the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country, by every means in our power.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>EVER hath the cauſe of Liberty employed the pen of any of her votaries upon a ſubject of greater importance to <hi>Britain</hi> and her Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies,<note place="margin">Introduction.</note> than the <hi>reciprocal advantages</hi> of which a perpetual UNION between them muſt neceſſarily be productive. To inveſtigate theſe advantages, and to place them in a clear and conſpicuous point of view, requires much ſkill and ingenuity, and affords ample ſcope for a vigorous exertion of the brighteſt genius, aſſiſted and improved by the moſt extenſive literature. A competent knowledge of the great and fundamental principles of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0151302000:33"/>of the nature of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution, the particular rights and privileges of the ſeveral Colonies, together with the hiſtory of their produce, trade and commerce, is indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary to ſuch an undertaking.</p>
                  <p>UNEQUAL as I am to the arduous taſk,<note place="margin">Motives for this undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</note> and trembling, leſt the ſubject ſhould ſuffer under my unpractiſed hand, I have been almoſt tempted to decline it; but when I conſider myſelf at once as a <hi>Briton</hi> and an <hi>American,</hi> and reflect upon the invaluable privileges and benefits, to which, in both theſe characters and capacities, I am ſo happy as to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled, every apprehenſion vaniſhes; an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt confidence takes place, and I venture to deliver my ſentiments, rude and unpoliſhed as they are, upon this intereſting theme, depending for ſucceſs upon that love of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and that warm zeal for my country's welfare, with which my boſom does, and, I truſt, will always glow. 'Tis this alone gives me reaſon to hope for that candour from my dear countrymen, to which I am well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced my poor abilities can lay no claim.</p>
                  <p>BUT I have an additional incentive to this undertaking: for I am called to it,<note place="margin">Further mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> as the ſon
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0151302000:34"/>of an Inſtitution, wherein I imbibed the true principles of Liberty, and was taught to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire the beauty and excellency of that civil conſtitution, in which the governing powers mutually controul, and are controuled by each other, in which the rights of prince and people are accurately diſcriminated, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and property effectually ſecured by a government of laws, not of men; in which civil and religious rights and privileges are held ſacred and inviolable, and declared to be no leſs the birth-right of the meaneſt ſubject, in the moſt diſtant and obſcure corner of the realm, than of the higheſt courtier that baſks in the ſun-ſhine of royal favour.</p>
                  <p>THIS <hi>Britiſh American</hi> ſeminary, which was founded upon theſe principles, and is careful to tranſmit them pure and uncorrupted to all her children, is juſtly intituled to a greater tribute from me than I have it in my power to pay. She has often inculcated this leſſon upon my youth, "That my head, my hand and my heart ſhould be at the ſervice of my country." My head and my hand perhaps may fail of rendering her ſuch aſſiſtances as ſhe receives from better heads and abler
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0151302000:35"/>hands: but the preſent occaſion will, at leaſt, enable me to ſhew, that I have an heart as deeply intereſted in my country's welfare, as any of her ſons. 'Tis upon this principle alone, that I ſtand a candidate for the honours which are now propoſed "to the beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation on the reciprocal advantages of a perpetual Union between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her colonies."</p>
                  <p>IN treating of this important ſubject,<note place="margin">The plan of treating the ſubject.</note> was I to enter upon a full and compleat enumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all theſe advantages, I ſhould doubtleſs exceed the limits uſually preſcribed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances of this nature. The principal arguments that I ſhall advance in favour of this perpetual union, ſhall be derived from one or other of theſe two ſources.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> From a conſideration of the nature and extent of the Commerce that ſubſiſts between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her Colonies, and the amazing increaſe of riches and power which they reciprocally derive from that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> From the glorious proſpect of the advancement of the Proteſtant Religion,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0151302000:36"/>which they profeſs, and ſpreading the Goſpel in its purity, through the vaſt benighted re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of this weſtern world.</p>
                  <p>BUT a full diſcuſſion of the ſeveral argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be drawn even from theſe two ſources, would require a volume, inſtead of a ſhort diſſertation. I ſhall therefore confine myſelf chieſly to thoſe which may be drawn from the firſt ſource, and only touch upon the ſecond, in the cloſe of the performance.</p>
                  <p>IN the firſt place then,<note place="margin">A general view of the preſent ſtate of the colonies</note> if we do but take a general view of the preſent flouriſhing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of the Colonies, and reflect upon the very ſmall beginnings from which they have roſe, in ſo ſhort a time, to ſuch a height as now renders them the richeſt jewel in the crown of <hi>Britain;</hi> if we conſider the figure that <hi>New-England, New-York,</hi> the <hi>Jerſeys, Pennſylvania, Maryland, Virginia,</hi> and <hi>Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina</hi> make at this day, compared with the ſtate of theſe countries in the hands of their original proprietors; if we attend a little to the amazing increaſe of their inhabitants, their products and exports, the prodigious quantities of manufactures they take off
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0151302000:37"/>from <hi>England,</hi> and the ballance of trade which ſhe obtains from their commodities, the ſhipping this commerce requires, the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men it raiſes, the mouths it feeds, the hands it employs, and the accumulated wealth which it brings to thouſands, nay millions of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, we cannot but be fully convinced of the vaſt importance and advantage of a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Union between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her <hi>American</hi> colonies.</p>
                  <p>CAN the warmeſt imagination form to itſelf an idea of aught more ſublime and delightful,<note place="margin">Their great improvement.</note> than thoſe happy effects which commerce, and the full enjoyment of civil and religious liberty, have ſo ſuddenly produced in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which were not long ſince the dreary haunts of ſavage beaſts and ſavage men.

Particular ranks of men have particular feelings peculiar to themſelves, and often contrary to the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts and feelings of the reſt of the ſociety, and therefore have no right to make, and much leſs to impoſe laws on their fellow-ſubjects, inconſiſtent with and oppoſite to thoſe intereſts and thoſe ſeelings; therefore a ſociety, government or real public, muſt conſiſt of freemen, chuſing or conſenting to laws themſelves. "To watch over ſuch a ſyſtem, and to promote its good as much as lies in our power, to reſiſt every encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on it, and to defend it to the utmoſt, is the political duty of every citizen."<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Preceptor, Vol. 2, on Ethics.</note> But
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0151302000:55"/>to ſacrifice the intereſts of one part to thoſe of another part weakens the affection of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, inasmuch as the preſervation of our rights, the ſecurity of our perſons, liberties and property, on the one hand, and obedience to government, on the other hand, are the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciprocal duties of the rulers and ruled.</p>

                  <p>THIS conſideration is indeed as far ſuperior to that which I have hitherto dwelt upon,<note place="margin">Superior to that of mere commerce, &amp;c.</note> as things eternal are to thoſe of a mere temporal nature. One relates to the greateſt of this world's good, even liberty and property. The other extends to a future and eternal world; and is employed upon ſuch objects as are moſt likely to ſecure the happy enjoyment of it. 'Tis the glory of <hi>Britain,</hi> that ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys both theſe advantages in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0151302000:61"/>that the means of preſerving the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is ſecured to her by the beſt <hi>civil</hi> conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and the means of obtaining the latter by the beſt <hi>religious</hi> eſtabliſhment in the world.</p>

                  <p>IN this Appendix, to obſerve ſome order, I ſhall begin with an account of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſettlements to the <hi>Northward;</hi> and firſt with <hi>Newfoundland.</hi> This great iſland, which is above three hundred miles long and two hundred broad, forms the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> boundary of the Gulf of St. <hi>Lawrence,</hi> and extends from thence <hi>Southward</hi> near ten degrees of latitude, along the <hi>Eaſtward</hi> part of <hi>Nova-Scotia.</hi> It is chiefly valuable for the great Fiſhery upon thoſe ſhoals,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Newfoundland,</hi> its Fiſhery.</note> which are called the Banks of <hi>Newfoundland.</hi> The plenty of Cod, and ſeveral other ſpecies of Fiſh here, is almoſt inconceivable, as well as along the ſhores of the iſland of <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> the coaſts <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> and <hi>New-England,</hi> which pours in
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0151302000:64"/>a treaſure of riches on <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> Our ſhare of the <hi>Newfoundland</hi> fiſhery was former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly computed to increaſe the national ſtock at leaſt three hundred thouſand pounds ſterling a year in gold and ſilver, remitted for the Cod we ſell in the different parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> in <hi>Spain, Portugal, Italy</hi> and the <hi>Levant,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="‡" place="bottom">See Account of <hi>European</hi> ſettlements in <hi>America,</hi> by <hi>Dodſley.</hi>
                     </note> of how much more wealth muſt it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive at preſent to the mother country, as <hi>Newfoundland</hi> and <hi>Nova-Scotia</hi> belong now ſo entirely to <hi>Great-Britain?</hi> The advantages which attend an extenſive and well-managed fiſhery are great and obvious. The ſea may be conſidered as a mine out of which the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is taken at a very little expence, and even that expence is advantageous, ſince it promotes ſeveral manufactures, and goes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely amongſt our own people. Fiſh is a valuable commodity, both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. According to ſome writers, the <hi>Dutch</hi> make more of their fiſhery in our ſeas, than the <hi>Spaniards</hi> do by the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi> Beſides, this fiſhery, properly attended to, would infalliably furniſh us with a conſtant ſupply of experienced, active and healthy
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0151302000:65"/>ſailors for manning our fleets; the gradual increaſe of which would prove not only a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and inexhauſtible ſource of wealth, and add to the ballance of trade in our favour, but augment our maritime force, to a degree that would make us a match for all <hi>Europe</hi> in naval power.<note n="†" place="bottom">Preceptor.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>ADJACENT to <hi>Newfoundland</hi> is the country of <hi>Nova-Scotia,</hi> which,<note place="margin">Nova-Scotia.</note> although the progreſs of it was at firſt but ſlow, is now become a conſiderable ſettlement, and is a very ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous place for fiſhing.

                  </p>
                  <p>BUT much more conſiderable is the colony of <hi>New-England.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">New-England.</note> This colony is in length near three hundred miles, and in ſome part near two hundred miles in breadth, lying between the forty-firſt and forty-fifth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of <hi>North</hi> latitude, and comprizes the four provinces of <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay, Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut, Rhode-Iſland</hi> and <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THERE is a noble Cod-fiſhery on this coaſt,<note place="margin">Its Fiſhery.</note> which employs a vaſt number of their people,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0151302000:66"/>and proves a very conſiderable article of trade. They are enabled by this to export annually above thirty thouſand quintals of choice Cod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh to <hi>Spain, Italy</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> and near twenty thouſand quintals of the refuſe ſort to the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> as food for the <hi>Negroes,</hi> beſides a large quantity to <hi>Madeira</hi> and <hi>Fyal,</hi> for wines and brandy.</p>
                  <p>THE buſineſs of ſhip-building is one of the moſt conſiderable which <hi>Boſton,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Its Tiade.</note> or the other ſea-port towns in <hi>New-England</hi> carry on. This country has materials enough to build ſhips for half the employment of <hi>Britain.</hi> It can furniſh the trade and navy too with naval ſtores, for the ſupplies of which from the <hi>Baltic,</hi> two or three hundred thouſand pounds ſterling annually was wont to be expended. In their trade to foreign parts, the profits of their voyage are generally received in bills of exchange upon <hi>London,</hi> or in returns of goods through the hands of <hi>Engliſh</hi> factors. By this circuitous commerce, they pay in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> for various ſorts of goods got from thence, to the amount of ſome hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds ſterling a year. Although their commerce is not carried on immediately with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0151302000:67"/>
                     <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> nor with <hi>Britiſh</hi> veſſels, yet here the profits chiefly center, where all the money, which the Colonies, can make in any manner, muſt center at laſt. Pot-aſhes, a moſt neceſſary article in manufactures, particularly in bleaching, as many thouſand barrels are annually conſumed for this one purpoſe in <hi>Ireland,</hi> have, within theſe few years, proved a very advantageous article of trade in ſeveral of the Colonies, particularly in <hi>New-England,</hi> and is likely to become a very valuable and growing remittance to the mother country. The amount of the pot-aſhes exported home from <hi>New-England</hi> only, within the laſt twelve months, is ſaid to be not leſs than thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds ſterling; and it is imagined that the quantity this year will ariſe to a much more conſiderable ſum. The ſpirit of gain which the making of pot-aſhes has already inſpired, it is probable, will every year conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to render this manufacture an object of much greater importance to <hi>America</hi> than has been generally imagined. Near ſix hundred ſail of ſhips have been laden in a year for <hi>Europe</hi> and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> plantations. From Chriſtmas 1747, to Chriſtmas 1748, five hundred veſſels cleared out from the port of <hi>Boſton</hi> only, for
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0151302000:68"/>a foreign trade, and four hundred and thirty were entered inwards. Great is the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage therefore of the <hi>New-England</hi> trade and navigation, if only conſidered as a nurſery of ſeamen; how much more by conſidering the addition it makes to the national ſtock?<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hiſtory of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire in <hi>America.</hi>

                  <p>GREAT quantities of Flax and Hemp are raiſed in theſe provinces. Mines of iron have been opened in them all, and a rich mine of copper has been ſucceſsfully worked in <hi>Eaſt-Jerſey,</hi> which may prove highly advantageous to the manufactures of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> The trade of theſe provinces to the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi> is very
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0151302000:69"/>conſiderable in Proviſions, Hides, Tallow, Lumber and Soap, &amp;c. for which they can procure Sugars, and from this find ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource of making remittance to <hi>England</hi> for the goods they get from thence.

The whole amount for the cuſtoms of Tobacco is more than a million. Such is the immenſe advantage

In the year 1754, the export of Rice from <hi>Charles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town,</hi> amounted to 104,682 barrels. In the year 1757, this branch of commerce was
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0151302000:72"/>computed to be annually worth, at the loweſt eſtimation, £. 150,000 ſterling. Great has been its increaſe ſince; and we may well reckon it to be at this time worth £. 200,000 ſterling.</p>
                  <p>IT was long before <hi>Carolina</hi> went into the profitable trade of Indigo; they began it ſince the year 1750, and in the year 1754, was exported from <hi>Charleſtown,</hi> to the amount of above 200,000 lb. weight; and 500,000 lb. weight was made in the year 1757. If the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants continue to improve the advantages with the ſame ſpirit in which they have begun, they muſt naturally and neceſſarily come to ſupply the whole conſumption of the world with this commodity, and conſequently make their country the richeſt part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions.<note n="‡" place="margin">See Account of <hi>European</hi> Settlements, printed by <hi>Dodſley.</hi>

                  <p>THE author is very ſenſible, that it would have been proper, in compoſing the following Eſſay, to have conſulted with gentlemen who reſide in the ſeveral places he had occaſion to ſpeak of, and are well acquainted with the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and extent of their commerce. Would the time, allowed for theſe performances, have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fored him an opportunity of procuring ſuch information, he flatters himſelf his piece would have been more <hi>original,</hi> with reſpect to matters of trade, and more worthy of public notice. He would have been thereby enabled to form a more exact eſtimate of the <hi>preſent</hi> ſtate of trade in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> Depriv'd of this advantage, he was obliged to have recourſe to commercial writers, amongſt whom he is chiefly indebted to <hi>Gee</hi> and <hi>Beawes.</hi> And when it is conſidered, that few perſons, though of far greater abilities and experience in the commercial world than the author, would be able of their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to furniſh an adequate account of every material branch in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> and <hi>American</hi> trade, he cannot deſpair of the Reader's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE ſituation of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> ſeparated from the reſt of the world by the ſurrounding ocean, and deſtitute of thoſe endleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſources, which an extent of continent affords its inhabitants, very early ſuggeſted to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and obſerving men, that a naval force would be the eaſieſt and moſt ſure means of her defence, againſt foreign encroachments. The great <hi>Alfred,</hi> of glorious and immortal memory, was fully convinced of this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant truth. He knew, by ſad experience, that the want of ſuch a force had ſubjected the iſland to the inſults and depredations of the <hi>Danes,</hi> and other <hi>Northern</hi> robbers. Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with affection for his ſubjects, and fir'd with a juſt reſentment of the injuries they had received, he reſolved, if poſſible, to ſupply ſuch a fatal defect. By equipping, with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible expedition, a fleet, conſiderable in
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0151302000:79"/>thoſe days, he rendered himſelf maſter of the ſea, and freed his people from the dread of being plundered. But in a few years, this beneficial, this glorious project, unſupported by a ſufficient fund, was almoſt entirely laid aſide. The inhabitants, employed in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of arms, or agriculture, and raiſing what was barely neceſſary for their own ſubſiſtence, could not poſſibly defray the expence of having a fleet always in readineſs. The <hi>Danes,</hi> taking advantage of their remiſſneſs in this important affair, ſoon over-run and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued the greateſt part of the iſland; but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attentive to a leſſon, which their own ſucceſs might have taught them, they, in their turn, fell a prey to an innundation of <hi>Normans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THUS the <hi>Britiſh</hi> navy, though ſeveral at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were made to render it reſpectable by monarchs, who underſtood their own intereſts, continued, nevertheleſs, to make no great figure, till the reign of queen <hi>Elizabeth.</hi> Till this time alſo the trade of <hi>England</hi> was very ſmall, and contracted within a narrow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs. It conſiſted chiefly in exporting Tin, Lead, Wool, and a few other articles, which ſerved to purchaſe what foreign goods were
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0151302000:80"/>wanted. That wiſe queen, aſſiſted by a wiſe and experienced miniſtry, diſcovered the grand ſecret unknown to her predeceſſors; they knew the advantages of a fleet, but the conſequent expences they knew not how to defray. An extenſive commerce was now very judiciouſly conſidered as the only ſource adequate to ſuch large and continual diſburſements. This it was thought, would not only afford a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply of money, ſufficient to equip and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a powerful navy, but would alſo be a ſchool or nurſery of ſeamen.</p>
                  <p>ON theſe conſiderations, encouragement was given to the perſecuted <hi>Walloons</hi> to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move and ſettle in <hi>England.</hi> They very wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly embraced an opportunity of tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves to a land of freedom, and brought with them the Woollen manufactory, which, favoured with the countenance and protection of a wiſe government, ſoon arrived at great perfection. In purſuance of the ſame plan, a trade was opened to <hi>Turkey, Muſcovy,</hi> the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> and almoſt every conſiderable country in the known world. Under the auſpices of the ſame queen, plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations were begun in <hi>AMERICA,</hi> and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0151302000:81"/>with vigour. They at firſt met with nearly inſuperable difficulties; nevertheleſs, by the indefatigable induſtry and perſeverance of the planters, and the generous aſſiſtance of their mother Country, thoſe difficulties were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted, and the Colonies brought to a pitch of greatneſs, that, conſidering the ſhort time of their growth, is almoſt incredible.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE taken this retroſpect in order to ſhew, that the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Trade, the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Navy, and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> ſprung up together. They are moſt nearly allied, being children of the ſame good policy; and it is worthy the notice and attention of every politician, who ſtudies to promote his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's welfare, that as they had their riſe at the ſame time, they have ever ſince continued to increaſe and flouriſh in proportion. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence is mutual, and if either of them be affected, the others ſooner or later will feel it in a very ſenſible manner.</p>
                  <p>GREAT has been my ſurprize at the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance or malevolence of ſeveral late pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions. The writers of them, either blinded by paſſion, or employed and inſtigated by the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0151302000:82"/>enemies of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſow diſcord and diſſention between the Mother Country and her <hi>American</hi> Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. Some have ſtrove to render the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts ſuſpected, by repreſenting them as an ungrateful, licentious people, aiming at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence, and impatient of any ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> whilſt others, no leſs enemies to the welfare and proſperity of both, would excite <hi>their</hi> jealouſy, by under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valuing the aſſiſtance <hi>ſhe</hi> has offerded them, and placing her in the light of a cruel Step<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother.</p>
                  <p>I am too well convinced of the good ſenſe of my countrymen, both of <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>America,</hi> to imagine them capable of being deluded by ſuch partial repreſentations, Conſidering themſelves as members of one grand body politic, they will naturally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that the good of the whole muſt reſult from a due connection and harmony of all the parts; and from the mutual exchange and intercourſe of friendly offices. Nevertheleſs, as this point ſeems to have been controverted, a few obſervations, tending to evince, that a "perpetual <hi>UNION</hi> between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her <hi>American</hi> Colonies, will be mutually and
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0151302000:83"/>
                     <hi>reciprocally</hi> advantageous," may not be leſs agreeable, than neceſſary, in the preſent Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation.</p>
                  <p>THIS is a ſubject, the moſt truly important and intereſting, which can claim a <hi>Briton</hi>'s notice, and does honour to that worthy gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who propos'd its diſcuſſion by the Sons of this Seminary. Struck with its vaſt delicacy and importance, and conſcious of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ability to treat it in a manner ſuited to its dignity, I had almoſt declin'd the arduous taſk; but it is a glory even to fail in great at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; and if I ſhould afford a hint to ſome abler pen, or contribute to remove the ſmalleſt prejudice, I ſhall think myſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely happy in being ſo far beneficial to the public.</p>
                  <p>WE have already obſerved, that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, the ſtrength and glory of <hi>Britain,</hi> principally depend on her Navy; and that her Navy can only be maintained by Trade and Commerce. Theſe are points too plain to be denied or diſputed by the moſt obſtinate and perverſe ſceptic: and it is a very natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from theſe premiſes, that whatever contributes to enlarge and extend her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, is highly advantageous to <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0151302000:84"/>IT muſt likewiſe be acknowledged, that new ſettlements and young countries ſtand in need of the aſſiſtance and protection of ſome powerful commercial ſtate. Deſtitute of theſe, they would be expoſed to the attacks of lawleſs invaders, for want of ſtrength to defend themſelves, and to the inclemency of weather for want of proper cloathing; for manufactures cannot be brought to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of perfection, or extended to advantage, except in well-ſettled countries; although agriculture, where the land is tolerably fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile, and the ſettlement ſecure, may enable the inhabitants to procure the neceſſary manufactures in return for its productions.</p>
                  <p>I HOPE therefore to make it appear, that a reciprocal emolument will ariſe from a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual union between <hi>Britain</hi> and her <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Colonies; as ſhe may by their means greatly enlarge her trade and commerce, and become ſtill more rich and powerful; and as they will reap the advantage of her riches and power, by being protected from their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and ſupplied with the conveniencies of life at a cheaper rate, and of a better quality than if manufactured by themſelves.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0151302000:85"/>IF we take a ſurvey of the commerce of <hi>Britain,</hi> we ſhall find it extended to almoſt every part of the known world; there is ſcarcely any place conſiderable for trade that is not viſited by her adventurous merchants. The means which have enabled her to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, and ſupport with dignity and advantage, ſuch large mercantile connections, are to be ſought for in her various manufactories; amongſt which the Woollen is univerſally al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the preference. Commercial writers have taken much pains to enumerate the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kinds of <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures; to ſhew their mutual dependence, and wherein the peculiar advantage of each conſiſts. As their works are in every one's hands, it is the leſs neceſſary for me to repeat their ſubſtance, and to particularize the articles which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to ſupport the trade of <hi>Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT there are two branches of commerce, whcih though not ſo generally attended to, are nevertheleſs moſt highly beneficial. The Fiſheries of <hi>Newfoundland, Cape-Breton</hi> and St. <hi>John</hi>'s, and there-exportation of foreign goods, have greatly increaſed the <hi>Britiſh</hi> navigation,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0151302000:86"/>riches and power. It is ſuppoſed that 2000 ſail of veſſels are employed in thoſe fiſheries: the number of hands neceſſary to navigate them, to cure and dry the fiſh, muſt be very large; and great the conſumption of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, nets and other utenſils, brought almoſt entirely from <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>GOODS for re-exportation are received from different quarters; ſome from <hi>Germany, Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,</hi> &amp;c. but in the greateſt quantities from the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> The bullion ſent to the former, is made an objection to that trade, the force of which it is not my province to determine. Nothing of this ſort can, however, be objected to the trade to the <hi>American</hi> plantations, which is of all moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the nation. There is ſcarcely any one ſpecies of <hi>Engliſh</hi> manufactures, that is not vended in <hi>America;</hi> thoſe of <hi>India</hi> likewiſe come here to a ready market. In ſhort, it is from <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies import almoſt every thing, requiſite for cloathing, agriculture, and other uſes. In return for theſe, they ſend her Sugar, To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco, Rice, Furs, Pot-aſh, Naval Stores,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0151302000:87"/>Gold and Silver, and the ballance of a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable trade with <hi>Portugal, Spain,</hi> and other countries, bordering on the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> in Bills of Exchange.</p>
                  <p>HERE is an occaſion to expatiate on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits deriv'd to <hi>Britain</hi> from each of theſe particulars; to obſerve the prodigious prices ſhe paid for them to foreigners, before their production in <hi>Britiſh America,</hi> and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparatively ſmall prices for which they are procured at preſent. The large quantities re-exported to foreign markets, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a demand upon them for very great ſums annually, might alſo be mentioned with much propriety. Nor would it be amiſs to ſhew the immenſe addition theſe articles bring to the revenue. But all theſe topics have been ſo largely inſiſted on in late pamphlets and detached pieces, and muſt be ſo well known to every one, that further mention of them is unneceſſary. Only I would beg leave to obſerve a particular ſtill unnoticed; in the year 1703, the government of <hi>Sweden</hi> refuſed a ſupply of Pitch and Tar, unleſs for ready money, at their own price, and in <hi>Swediſh</hi>
                     <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0151302000:88"/>bottoms. Such a groſs impoſition awaken'd the indignation and reſentment of <hi>Britain,</hi> and taught the true policy of deriving them from the Colonies. Encouragement was thereupon given, and ſoon produced a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient quantity to anſwer all her demands. But the ſpirit of the nation was again lull'd; the <hi>Sweeds</hi> reſumed their trade, and that of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi> was very much neglected.</p>
                  <p>SOME, perhaps, will readily grant, that the exportation of theſe articles from <hi>America,</hi> is beneficial to her, and ſerves to enrich her inhabitants; but in what reſpect can it be eſteemed advantageous to <hi>Britain?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>THIS queſtion admits a very obvious ſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is advantageous to <hi>Britain</hi> in various reſpects. It affords freight for many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ton of her ſhipping, and a nurſery of ſeamen for the royal navy; the commiſſions enrich her merchants, and the re-exportation brings abundance of wealth into the kingdom. The duties they pay are an immenſe increaſe of the revenue, and they are received from the plantations in return for <hi>Britiſh</hi> produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and manufactures, of which the Colonies
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0151302000:89"/>take off more than any foreign market what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever. The importation of <hi>Britiſh</hi> goods, and thoſe received by the way of <hi>Britain,</hi> has, on a medium, for ſeveral years paſt, amounted to upwards of two millions annually; a ſum ſo immenſe, that although the Colonies abound with valuable articles, extremely well adapted to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> market, and very beneficial to her trade and navigation, and though they make large remittances by the way of <hi>Spain, Portugal</hi> and <hi>Italy,</hi> in bills of exchange, yet the produce of all theſe ſources leaves a large ballance in favour of <hi>Britain,</hi> which they pay her in gold and ſilver. This in part furniſhes bullion for the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> trade; on account of which, and the vaſt conſumption of <hi>India</hi> goods, the flouriſhing condition of that valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able branch of commerce, may, in no ſmall degree, very juſtly be attributed to the <hi>American</hi> Colonies.</p>
                  <p>THUS we ſee, that not only every ſpecies of the manufactures of <hi>Britain,</hi> but alſo her fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign trade and navigation are much indebted to <hi>America.</hi> Hence riches have flowed into her coffers, and enabled her to ſupport a fleet,
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0151302000:90"/>ſufficient to maintain the empire of the ocean. And whoever conſiders the ſtate of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, muſt conclude, that they have not been loſers by their intercourſe with their mother country. Conſideration being had of the ſhort time the <hi>American</hi> ſettlements have been made, the inhabitants have increaſed in riches and number to admiration; though far from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying that affluence, of which ſome would repreſent them poſſeſſed. The advantages of their trade have been mutual. <hi>She,</hi> by their means, has continued to riſe in wealth and power; whilſt <hi>they,</hi> in the ſunſhine of her aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance and protection, and the enjoyment of a beneficial commerce, have grown up and flouriſhed, and ſtill continue to flouriſh, the equal advantage, ornament, and glory of <hi>Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>BUT, ſhould we only take a retroſpect, ſhould we confine ourſelves barely to what is paſt, much injuſtice would be done to this animating ſubject, and we ſhould loſe a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect which cannot but afford the higheſt pleaſure to every <hi>Briton.</hi> Let us therefore look forward to the mutual benefits, which, with proper attention, may hereafter ariſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0151302000:91"/>IN order to this, it will be neceſſary briefly to enumerate thoſe articles of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>'s foreign importations, which have relation to the preſent ſubject. They are raw, thrown and wrought Silk, Velvets, Linens, Timber, Boards, Pot-aſh, and all kinds of Naval Stores. Several writers on trade have computed the ballances paid by <hi>Britain</hi> for thoſe ſorts of goods to <hi>France, Italy, Germany, Flanders, Norway, Denmark, Sweeden</hi> and <hi>Ruſſia;</hi> and none I have met with make the amount leſs than two millions annually; this ſhe diſcharges in gold and ſilver. Perhaps matter of fact may be oppoſed to this eſtimate, becauſe there is not ſo great an exportation of bullion; but the argument is not hereby invalidated. If the ballance on ſome other trade: which would elſe be brought home and added to the national ſtock, be diverted and ſent to thoſe places, it is equally pernicious to the kingdom, as if it was imported and then ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported. And this is certainly the caſe. <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> on her particular trade with <hi>Holland,</hi> for inſtance, has a right to a very large ballance in ſpecie; but the latter, by keeping in her Debt the nations abovementioned, or ſeveral
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0151302000:92"/>them, who have demands on <hi>Britain,</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by their means to ſatisfy her <hi>Britiſh</hi> creditors, and ſave her money; and beſides this, bullion is ſent to <hi>Holland</hi> to anſwer bills of exchange drawn in favour of thoſe nations.</p>
                  <p>THE conſideration of this muſt deeply af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect every one, who has at heart the trade and proſperity of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and would preſerve her independent of her <hi>European</hi> neighbours; eſpecially as the wollen manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory is in its decline. <hi>France</hi> not only ſupplies her own people with woollens, but by the cheapneſs of her goods, and the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the court of <hi>Spain,</hi> has in a great meaſure ſupplanted <hi>England</hi> in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> markets. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> themſelves, ſenſible of their impolitic conduct, ſeem determined to perſiſt no longer in an error, the reſult of ill-grounded principles and miſtaken notions of honour. They have made ſeveral efforts to eſtabliſh manufactories of their own Wool, which have by no means proved fruitleſs. Other nations of <hi>Europe,</hi> obſerving the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of <hi>France,</hi> have copied her example, by
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0151302000:93"/>which <hi>England</hi> has loſt much of her woollen trade, particularly with <hi>Portugal,</hi> where the importation of this ſtaple commodity ſeems to meet with many diſcouragements.</p>
                  <p>FROM this reflection our attention is natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally turned to <hi>America,</hi> which will be her ſureſt, and perhaps in time, her only market, as reſtored fabrication is likely to take place in every part of <hi>Europe.</hi> If under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſuch large ſums are continually paid for foreign imports, the ballance of trade in favour of <hi>Britain</hi> will be materially di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed. The only remedy for this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evil is to be found in <hi>America,</hi> who can furniſh a variety of the moſt uſeful raw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials on terms mutually beneficial.</p>
                  <p>GREAT quantities of Furs and Peltry have been, and ſtill are, ſent from the Colonies to <hi>Britain,</hi> the acquiſition of <hi>Canada</hi> having thrown that whole trade into our hands; but it is capable of greater improvement, and may well ſuperſede the fur trade to Ruſſia. The <hi>Northern Indians,</hi> with a little encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement, will bring their Ermines and other fine furs from the 70th degree of latitude,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0151302000:94"/>which is parallel with the <hi>European</hi> countries, where the moſt valuable Furs are procured. The diſtance thoſe people will travel to trade with our ſettlements, is well known to all acquainted with their affairs. This would likewiſe be a means of diſperſing <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures amongſt a multitude of <hi>Indian</hi> tribes, at preſent unknown to our traders.</p>
                  <p>IRON mines are ſo plenty in almoſt every province on the continent, that it is thought with good reaſon, they could ſupply all the markets in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for Timber, Boards, Pitch and Tar, they may likewiſe be procured here in great abundance. <hi>Britiſh America,</hi> extended along the coaſt more than 2000 miles, and reaching an unknown, but prodigious way into the continent, is almoſt one continued foreſt, fill'd with every kind of uſeful timber, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great devaſtions made within the two laſt centuries.</p>
                  <p>HERE it may poſſibly be objected, that the expenſive freight of theſe bulky articles, would render them unfit for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> markets. The <hi>Danes, Swedes,</hi> and others,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0151302000:95"/>employed at preſent in the Lumber trade, are no doubt by long experience become ſkillfull and can afford their goods at the cheapeſt. rates: but the Colonies might be put upon a par with them by encouragement from the legiſlature. Greater difficulties in other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances have yielded to the efforts of <hi>Britiſh</hi> adventurers. <hi>America</hi> may vie with any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try whatever in plenty of materials, and other conveniences; and if large bulky ſhips were built, of ſeven or eight hundred tons, capable of being navigated by fewer hands in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their burthen, than thoſe in preſent uſe, the expence of navigation would be much diminiſhed. The difference of diſtance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>America,</hi> and the Gulphs of <hi>Bothnia</hi> and <hi>Finland,</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> is inconſiderable; and <hi>America</hi> is neareſt to <hi>Liſbon, Cadiz,</hi> and all the markets to the <hi>Southward</hi> of <hi>Cape Finiſterre,</hi> and therefore might more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently ſupply thoſe markets.</p>
                  <p>THE inconvenience, and even abſurdity of being ſupplied with Naval Stores by foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, beſides the diſadvantage of conſuming the national wealth, is very evident. Every one knows, that ſhould a war be entered into with thoſe
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0151302000:96"/>nations, or ſhould they be confederated with the enemies of <hi>Britain,</hi> by cutting off the ſinews of her ſtrength, they might reduce her to the utmoſt diſtreſſes. Both inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences would be remedied, if Naval Stores were entirely procured from <hi>America;</hi> who, being connected with the Mother Country by every powerful tie, would not fail to afford them in plenty on any emergency.</p>
                  <p>HEMP, Flax and Silk, manufactured and unmanufactured, are articles for which <hi>Britain</hi> pays large ſums to foreigners, as was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved before. Rough materials may be procured in the Colonies, which abound with low bottoms and deep rich ſoils, requiring only cultivation to produce the moſt luxuriant crops of Hemp and Flax, particularly in the <hi>Southern</hi> Colonies. To confirm this, I might mention the fertility of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which lies nearly under the ſame parallels of latitude with <hi>Florida, Georgia, Carolina</hi> and <hi>Virginia</hi> and is famous for the production of theſe commodities in the greateſt perfection; but experience is preferable to a thouſand ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0151302000:97"/>I MENTION Silk, becauſe the abundance of Mulberry-trees in the <hi>Southern</hi> Colonies, ſeems naturally to point out the cultivation of that valuable article. To this may be added, that their ſoil, climate and marme ſituation, are pretty much the ſame with <hi>Nankin</hi> and <hi>Chekiang,</hi> the moſt famous Silk provinces in all <hi>China.</hi> Theſe circumſtances afford good reaſon to believe, the Silk-worm would thrive very well here, and experience heightens the belief into certainty. Small trials have been made, and ſome ſilk produced in <hi>Carolina,</hi> was eſteemed by good judges equal to the fineſt of <hi>China</hi> or <hi>Italy.</hi> The hands employed in the cultivation of Hemp and Flax, will have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient leiſure to gather the leaves and feed the worms, which will enable the planters to afford all theſe articles cheaper than may at firſt be imagined.</p>
                  <p>FROM this it ſeems evident, that materials for carrying on the Silk and Linen manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factories to the greateſt extent, may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured from <hi>America.</hi> And in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> are prodigious numbers of poor, who would chearfully work to maintain themſelves and families, doom'd to miſery for want of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment.
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0151302000:98"/>To eſtabliſh manufactories of thoſe goods by public encouragement, would therefore be an undertaking of the higheſt utility both to <hi>Britain</hi> and the Colonies. <hi>"Fas eſt et ab hoſte doceri."</hi> It could be no diſgrace to imitate in this reſpect the policy of <hi>France,</hi> who knowing that trade is the only ſolid foundation of greatneſs, is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to monopolize the three grand branches of manufactures.</p>
                  <p>NOR need the woollen manufacturer be afraid, that his buſineſs would hereby receive the ſmalleſt prejudice. There is a ſufficient number of hands in the three kingdoms to carry on each of them to the greateſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage. Many who at preſent can't afford themſelves the neceſſary covering, would then be able to purchaſe more decent and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable cloathing; and the Colonies having their ſources of remittance enlarged, would increaſe their already enormous demands for <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures.</p>
                  <p>SHOULD this beneficial ſcheme be carried into execution, more than two millions would be annually ſaved to the nation; ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0151302000:99"/>employment provided for an incredible number of hands in <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> and the trade, navigation and riches of both would receive very large additions.</p>
                  <p>IT may poſſibly be thought from my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to confine fabrication to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> that I am no friend to the Colonies, as there has of late been ſo many propoſals for erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manufactories in <hi>America.</hi> I ſhould eſteem myſelf very unhappy in the diſpleaſure of my countrymen. None of the numerous ſons of <hi>Britiſh America</hi> more ardently wiſhes her proſperity than myſelf, or has a heart more devoted to her ſervice. Conſcious there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the rectitude of my intentions, I will not doubt of being heard with candor, tho' I venture to maintain, that to divert their hands from their preſent lucrative Employments, and ſet them to work on manufactories, would be incompatible with the true intereſt of the Colonies.</p>
                  <p>THE number of their inhabitants, though near three millions, is ſmall in proportion to the extent of continent they poſſeſs. Lands are conſequently cheap, and labour dear;
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0151302000:100"/>whatever therefore can be produced by means of the land with little labour, muſt prove moſt advantageous. Hence ariſes the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſhip-building, wherein the materials, thus procurable, are of primary conſideration.</p>
                  <p>For the ſame reaſon, agriculture will bring more emolument to the Colonies, than could poſſibly ariſe from manufacturing goods, whoſe chief value depends on the artificer's labour. Nor will this circumſtance render them at all more dependent. Abounding with the neceſſaries of life, and materials for fabrication, the produce of the willing earth, they can at any time <hi>command</hi> a ſupply of the goods they want, in greater plenty, and of a better quality than would have been the reſult of their labour, employed in manufactures. I would not be underſtood by this reaſoning, to exclude the induſtrious farmer from work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up his Wool, and other coarſe articles, unfit for exportation; this will be doubly advantageous, it will be a ſaving to himſelf, and enable him to pay for the finer goods he may purchaſe with greater eaſe and punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0151302000:101"/>Now upon a review of the whole we find, that the trade of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to ſome places is vaſtly advantageous, bringing large ſums of money into the kingdom; to others, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though no returns are made in ſpecie, but as much of their produce and manufactures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived as is ſent them of <hi>Britiſh,</hi> it is never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs profitable, affording employment for her people; to a third ſort, though perhaps lucrative to ſome private merchants, it is very pernicious, and unprofitable to the nation in general, as it drains the kingdom of great quantities of gold and ſilver. We may alſo obſerve, that the neceſſity of continuing the latter is removed by the colonies, which are capable of furniſhing, at leaſt, materials for manufacturing all the particulars procured thereby, with mutual benefit. It likewiſe appears, that a great part of her moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous trade depends on the Colonies, and that it may be ſtill farther improved by <hi>America;</hi> that whilſt the Colonies have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted ſo much to enrich and aggrandize their mother country, they have themſelves been enriched and protected; and that the ſcheme for rendering them ſtill more advantageous to <hi>Britain,</hi> promiſes them an equal ſhare of profit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="73" facs="tcp:0151302000:102"/>WHOEVER conſiders theſe circumſtances, will, I am perſuaded, anticipate my conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; but I cannot diſmiſs the ſubject without ſuggeſting another argument, which will not be eſteemed a trifling one by men of ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reflection. The benefits ariſing from the Proteſtant Religion to thoſe ſtates which have embraced it, and indeed to the world in general, are very obvious. Every one, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the affairs of <hi>Europe,</hi> muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their ſituation is far better than it was four or five centuries ago; the religious and civil liberties of mankind, are underſtood with more clearneſs and preciſion; the human mind, which before was crampt and confined in its reſearches, has become more expanded, and acquired much clearer knowledge in the Arts, in Philoſophy and Divinity. It is now very well known, that Philoſophy does not conſiſt in monkiſh jargon, and that without Virtue there can be no Religion. Even thoſe countries, that are enemies to Proteſtantiſm, have been ſharers in its happy eſſects; the rays of knowledge have, in ſome meaſure, illuminated their clouded underſtandings; but like thoſe of the ſun within the <hi>Polar</hi> climates, they are weak and languid.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="74" facs="tcp:0151302000:103"/>
                     <hi>Great-Britain</hi> has been the bulwark of the Proteſtant intereſt, ever ſince its exiſtence; and by her the attacks of its enemies have been repelled. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> Colonies, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed on principles of Civil and Religious Liberty, have hitherto been protected therein by their own noble efforts, and her kind aſſiſtance; and while they remain united, the enjoyment of their liberties of both kinds, will, no doubt, be continued in its full extent. What would be the conſequence of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>union, none can tell; but there is more than a probability, that theſe particulars would be deeply affected. <hi>France,</hi> our ever-watchful enemy, will be ready to ſeize any advantage that may offer. She would have her arma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments prepared to enter by <hi>St. Lawrence</hi> and the <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> and might poſſibly over-run all the Colonies. Should this be the caſe, the candle of Science would be ſoon extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, and Ignorance introduced, in order to keep up a blind devotion and implicit obedience. The Genius of Liberty would be driven from <hi>Britiſh America,</hi> where ſhe hath hitherto delighted to reſide; and whether the mother country would be more fortunate, I leave to the conſideration of her Patriot Sons. ALL</p>

                     <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0151302000:104"/>SINCE, then, ſo many reciprocal advantages are the reſult of Union between <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> to render that Union perpetual, will be the only means of ſecuring and tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to poſterity, together with thoſe immenſe benefits, which are yet in proſpect. Intereſt and affection,—all the tender and endearing ties, which connect mankind,— backed by the venerable authority of Religion, plead for it with irreſiſtable eloquence.</p>
                  <p>WHETHER the Union ought to remain on its preſent eſtabliſhment, or whether it ſhould receive a new form and impreſſion, are mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters foreign to my purpoſe: Only permit me to ſuggeſt that, in the important determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no partial views ſhould be purſued; but the intereſt of each, and its relation to the whole, ſhould have a proper conſideration.— He muſt be either a madman, or a novice in politicks, who would ſet the intereſt of one in competition with that of the other.—They are inſeperably connected, and muſt ſtand or fall together.—That maxim of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> may be here applied with much truth and propriety;—"Self love and ſocial are the ſame:" each will find their accounts in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0151302000:105"/>the others happineſs and proſperity, In the diſcuſſion, the trade of the colonies me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits a peculiar attention. Should thoſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, I have taken the liberty to mention, be fallen upon to enlarge it, and free ports eſtabliſhed in ſome parts of <hi>Britiſh America,</hi> the national riches would be greatly increaſed. The inhabitants of the <hi>Spaniſh, Portugueſe,</hi> and other <hi>American</hi> ſettlements, would reſort thither for ſupplies of <hi>Britiſh</hi> manufactures, and the produce of the Colonies; leaving in exchange for them large quantities of gold and ſilver; a very conſiderable part of which would ultimately center in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WARMED and animated with a ſincere love for my country, I cannot but indulge a pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hope, that <hi>Britain</hi> and her colonies, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their true intereſt, will ſteadily and with unremitting zeal purſue meaſures calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to cement this Union.—The repeal of a late<note n="*" place="margin">The American Stamp Act.</note> act of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament, and the preſent favourable diſpoſition of that moſt reſpectable body, fill us with the higheſt joy, and promiſe redreſs of all our grievances: and I am well perſuaded, my fellow ſubjects

The wound, which ſeemed to be attended with ſymptoms fatal to the mutual confidence ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting between them, will now be healed, and I flatter myſelf without a ſcar, by way of remembrance. Jealouſies will ſubſide; ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities be forgotten; harmony will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in every part of the body politick; and innumerable bleſſings entailed on poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>

                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:0151302000:110"/>To point out thoſe that are moſt obvious, and which muſt neceſſarily follow, is the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this Eſſay, which pretends to no more than ſketching out the imperfect out-lines of a picture, whoſe beauty has indeed been ſhaded: but we truſt and believe that time and experience will point out thoſe blemiſhes, and ſoon reſtore it to its former purity and luſtre. To facilitate this has been the deſign of the generous friend to this inſtitution, who propoſed the diſcuſſion of the preſent ſubject; and it is a deſign worthy the benevolent patriotic ſpirit of an Engliſh Senator.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rome</hi> the miſtreſs of the world and arbiter of nations, by her wiſe policy and prudent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to her allies and coloniſts, raiſed herſelf to an aſtoniſhing pitch of grandeur and power; ſhe encouraged, ſhe incorporated, and never deprived them of any eſſential privileges. By theſe rules ſhe gained their affections, and of factious, turbulent citizens, and often of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vererate enemies ſhe made faithful, zealous, and uſeful ſubjects. <hi>Great-Britain</hi> has at much expence of blood and treaſure ſecured and protected her <hi>American</hi> colonies from the deſigns of <hi>France,</hi> who viewed their riſing power and growing importance with a jealous eye, and therefore determined to nip them in
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0151302000:111"/>the bud, before they could ripen to any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of formidable perfection. Happily for us theſe ambitious and fatal projects were cruſhed by the united valour and ſkill of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her provinces. To a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and ſucceſsful Union in War, let us then add the happy and harmonious Union of Peace, nor loſe its bleſſings by in-attention to, or diſregard of, the ineſtimable advantages that may, nay that muſt attend it.</p>
                  <p>Colonies are emigrations from the mother country, either occaſioned by a quick Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo as to render it too ſmall for the ſupport of its growing inhabitants; or by Oppreſſion, Tyranny, and undue exerciſe of Power; or ſometimes by the diſtreſſes and deſolation of War.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt caſe, they are always formed not only with the countenance, but with the expreſs encouragement and direction of the mother country.—In the ſecond inſtance un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs prohibited by legal authority, they ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally go with its implyed conſent. In the laſt, which was the caſe of the <hi>Trojans</hi> after the deſtruction of <hi>Troy,</hi> they go under a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity which is ſuperior to all law. In either of theſe caſes then, but eſpecially the two
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0151302000:112"/>firſt, they cannot be ſuppoſed to relinquiſh their claim to any of the rights and privileges of the country from which they go, nor yet to have forfeited it. No; however remote, they ſtill continue ſubjects of the ſame kingdom, and unleſs ſpecially relinquiſhed, intituled to all the liberties, privileges, and immunities of that country, of which they form one or more of the conſtituent parts. If this be as true in fact as it is grateful in ſuppoſition, the analogy made by an eminent writer<note n="*" place="margin">Dr. Strahan's Preface to Domat's Civil Law.</note> between the <hi>American</hi> colonies and thoſe of <hi>Spain,</hi> which he ſuppoſes to be ſettled upon the ſame principles, and therefore to be governed by the ſame policy, muſt appear very ſtrange. But the principle upon which it is founded, is as erroneous as the conſequence deduced from it is derogatory to ENGLISH LIBERTY.</p>
                  <p>The AMERICAN COLONIES have been entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled by thoſe who came under the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate protection and countenance of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or fled to it as an aſylum from arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary and oppreſſive power. A due conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the rights they claim, and the duties they owe to the mother country, may be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in ſome degree to aſcertain with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion the advantages that will accrue from a
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0151302000:113"/>compleat, and perfect Union. Theſe <hi>rights</hi> and <hi>duties</hi> are RECIPROCAL, as well as the Intereſt which ariſes from them.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Rights</hi> we claim are the <hi>full</hi> and <hi>free</hi> enjoyment of CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY, PROTECTION from foreign invaſions, and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> in every <hi>commercial intereſt,</hi> which does not directly interfere with that of the mother country.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Duties</hi> we owe, are OBEDIENCE under <hi>conſtitutional</hi> and <hi>legal</hi> reſtrictions, and an excluſive preference to the mother country in every article of commerce and trade. Under one or other of theſe heads, however widely diffuſed, may be comprized every duty, either owing to or from the mother country. And and it is by a due and mutual obſervance of theſe only, that their reſpective and reciprocal intereſts can be promoted. From this juſt and wiſe policy will flow all thoſe advantages which render a cloſe and perfect Union ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable an object—and theſe may be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either as they tend to increaſe the power and glory of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> or as they ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance its grand commercial intereſt, and
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0151302000:114"/>become the channels of its wealth. Or with regard to the Colonies, as they conduce to their ſafety, nouriſhment and protection; for though the true riches of a nation are ſaid to conſiſt in the number of its inhabitants, and treaſures are called the ſinews of war, it is very certain a nation may be very poor, and very powerful at the ſame time; or abound with wealth, and yet be weak and impotent. <hi>Rome,</hi> in its early ages, was poor in every thing but the public ſpirit and bravery of her people, while ſhe was the dread and terror of the nations round her. And <hi>Spain</hi> is at preſent a lively inſtance that wealth and power are not inſeparable; who, as the treaſures of the <hi>Indies</hi> have flowed in upon her, has loſt the martial animated ſpirit of her anceſtors.</p>
                  <p>As ſubjects of the ſame kingdom, bearing allegiance to the ſame Prince, and controuled by the ſame executive power, the <hi>Americans</hi> are bound to contribute, in proportion to their numbers and abilities, to the defence and ſafety of the common cauſe. What an acceſſion of power to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire then is three millions of ſubjects, dutiful, loyal and brave, who have on many occaſions
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0151302000:115"/>diſtinguiſhed themſelves, and ſhewn they were not unworthy the glorious ſtock from which they ſprung; who intereſt themſelves in the honour and glory of the nation, and partake of the veneration and reſpect due to it?</p>
                  <p>HERE is a fund of hardy, brave ſoldiers, inured to fatigue and frugality, ready to engage in the ſervice of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe thinks proper to require them. From this fruitful, this increaſing ſource, her armies and navies may receive conſtant ſupplies, not of mercenary hierlings ready to engage in the ſervice of the higheſt bidder, but faithful, dutiful children, animated with becoming fortitude, freedom and loyalty. Theſe, if encouraged, cheriſhed and protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will indeed prove</p>
                  <q>"Of <hi>Britain</hi>'s empire the ſupport and ſtrength."

                  <p>IN order to make a colony of the moſt uſe and benefit to the mother country, it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that its climate, its ſoil, and natural
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0151302000:116"/>produce, ſhould be eſſentially different from hers. This will create a neceſſary connection and dependance between them. The Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing the commodities and produce of the one, for thoſe of the other, will not only deſtroy the heart-burnings and jealouſy of a competition, but produce an intercourſe equally beneficial and durable to both. It is happy, therefore, when the ſubjects of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce</hi> cannot be the ſame, as they thereby reap an advantage, from which other nations are excluded, who might either by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding diſtreſs them, or raiſe the ballance againſt them when their neceſſities were not mutual and equal. In this reſpect, <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is peculiarly happy in her Colonies, whoſe wide extent and different ſituations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a variety of climates, ſoils and produce, and thus form a proper baſis for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial intereſt, to which every other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſhould ſubmit. The iſlands produce commodities which the mother country muſt uſe, and yet cannot raiſe; theſe therefore ſhe muſt procure by an intercourſe with her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, or lie at the mercy of thoſe powers whoſe intereſt it might occaſionally be to
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0151302000:117"/>diſtreſs her. But what adds to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage is, that the ſubjects of commerce are not only eaſily procured, but procured by a mutual exchange, equally convenient and ſatisfactory to both; and at the ſame time a large revenue ſecured, not only upon the home conſumption, but on the ſurplus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their reſpective wants and neceſſities. Thus alſo, as to the continent, <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> both as a naval and commercial nation, would be in a critical, dangerous ſituation, if ſhe did not hold within her own reach, all the materials neceſſary for the ſupport of both. An intire dependance upon any of her neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours for one neceſſary article would, in ſome degree, make her ſubject to that neighbour. But her Colonies ſet her above every appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of this kind. Her <hi>Northern</hi> provinces abound with timber of every kind, neceſſary for building and equipping her navies. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe bodies of Ore, both Iron and Copper, are already diſcovered and uſefully employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and, doubtleſs, much more lies ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in the bowels of the earth, whoſe ſoil, it properly cultivated and encouraged, is richly productive of Hemp and Flax; for
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0151302000:118"/>the former of which <hi>Great-Britain</hi> pays, <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munibus annis,</hi> £. 300,000 ſterling. Her more <hi>Southern</hi> Colonies furniſh her with the few remaining marine articles of Pitch, Tar and Turpentine.</p>
                  <p>HERE then are found all the materials of Timber, Iron, Cordage, and every other ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Naval Stores, neceſſary for the ſupport, nay, the exiſtence of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> as a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritime power. Should I here mention bodies of Saltpetre, the ſpontaneous produce of the earth, I may perhaps be thought too pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature; but if the promiſing appearances of that uſeful and expenſive, but neccſſary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, be happily confirmed, here is a new ſource of national wealth and independance. A large and conſtant ballance, which <hi>Great-Britain</hi> pays to the <hi>Indies</hi> in ſpecie, will be inſtantly ſaved, and a ſurer, quicker, and cheaper ſupply at once ſecured. Next to the ſubjects of COmmerce, which are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to enable the mother country to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her independance and rank among the other powers or <hi>Europe,</hi> we may place all theſe, which are articles of convenience, Luxury, and the ſurplus of thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0151302000:119"/>which are not applied to naval purpoſes. The real and abſolute neceſſaries of life are but few, the ſubjects of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce are many and various, as they contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute not only to the real, but the imaginary, capricious wants, of mankind. To provide therefore againſt theſe wants, upon advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous terms, is a juſt and neceſſary policy; and there are few, very few, of theſe articles, which the coloniſts cannot furniſh, under proper encouragements. The iſlands tender the various produce of their climate equal in quantity and quality with thoſe of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. The <hi>Southern</hi> Colonies of <hi>North-America</hi> have, as far as the infancy of the country will permit, produced the different articles of Silk, Rice, Indigo, Tobacco, and even the Tea plant has not been altogether uncultivated. Some of theſe have been car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a much greater degree of cultivation than others; but where it has, <hi>Great-Britain</hi> has received a proportionate benefit. In the inſtance of Tobacco only, ſhe has become not only the ſole vender, but almoſt the ſole ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturer for <hi>Europe,</hi> beſides the immenſe revenue flowing immediately into her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0151302000:120"/>WINES are an article of luxury, and it is perhaps upon that account they have not been ſo much attended to by the frugal, temperate <hi>American;</hi> but it is certain, not only from theory, but experience, that the ſituation and ſoil of many parts of this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended continent, are well adapted for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing them. To what degree of perfection not only the cultivation of theſe, but the other articles of convenience and luxury may arrive, is difficult to determine; but it is eaſy to ſee, that the great, the eventual profit, will terminate in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> I mentioned before the produce of the Colonies as Naval Stores, but conſidered as the raw materials of great and extenſive manufactories, which give bread to thouſands; and of idle, clamorous ſtarving ſubjects, make uſeful and induſtrious citizens, I cannot err, when I ſay they are immenſely uſeful to their mother country. Upon a view of the foreign trade of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> we ſhall find, that except that to <hi>Portugal,</hi> the ballance is againſt her in every one. To <hi>Ruſſia,</hi> to <hi>Sweden,</hi> to <hi>Denmark,</hi> to <hi>Germany,</hi> ſhe pays annually large ſums in ſpecie, for thoſe very commodities which her <hi>American</hi> Colonies can and do produce; and a great writer has obſerved, <q>That a country
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0151302000:121"/>which conſtantly exports fewer manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures or commodities than it receives, will ſoon find the ballance ſinking, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive leſs and leſs, till falling into extreme poverty, it will receive nothing at all.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>HERE then we may trace the great utility of the Colonies, not only that they afford a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and ſure ſupply of the ſubjects of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, neceſſary for the ſupport of the power and manufactures of the mother country, but in that ſhe has an indiſputable excluſive preference in the ſale of them; and the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in return are the fixed and conſtant cuſtomers for all her manufactures and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, to which they are indiſpenſably obliged to give the preference over thoſe of other countries; for as the deſign of colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizing was not to found a new empire, but to extend the old, there is no impropriety in appropriating the trade of the Colonies to the mother country only. If the ballance was therefore in favour of Colonies, as is the caſe between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> it would be more eligible it ſhould fall into the hands of its own ſubjects, however remote, than into thoſe of a foreign power. But where that ballance is actually and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0151302000:122"/>greatly in favour of the mother country, it becomes an intereſt that ought to be very dear; to the cultivating of which, the greateſt care and attention of government ſhould be applied. That this is the caſe of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her continential Colonies, the vaſt exportation of bullion, and the ſtill remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing debt of five millions, moſt evidently evince. With what a rapid, aſtoniſhing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, this beneficial, this lucrative trade has advanced, the growing increaſe of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports declare, which aroſe from the Year 1744, from £. 1,436,227, to the amazing amount of £. 2,710,520. To this the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther country, in a great meaſure, owes her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance as a trading nation, when deprived of her valuable Levant trade and her inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe even with <hi>Portugal</hi> greatly diminiſhed, and leſſened by her active induſtrious rivals, the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch.</hi> It is from this foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain thoſe treaſures flow, which enable her to pay the reſpective ballances to thoſe countries with whom ſhe trades, on a diſadvantageous footing. <hi>America,</hi> it is true, does not extract them immediately from her own bowels. She has a more valuable and durable reſource, in
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0151302000:123"/>in the labour and induſtry of her inhabitants; who exchange the ſurplus of their commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, beyond their own conſumption, (and which might, in ſome reſpects, interfere with the ſtaples of the mother country, or at leaſt be uſeleſs to her) for thoſe treaſures which are only valuable to the coloniſts, as they enable them to diſcharge paſt, and contract future engagements for the manufactures of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>WHILE, therefore, ſhe poſſeſſes a market, which ſhe can call <hi>excluſively</hi> her own, ſubject to her own regulations, and the ballance always in her favour; whatever the Colonies may acquire from any collateral branches of trade, will quickly flow to the mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as the great centre of all their external proſits. To reſtrain, therefore, or rather ſtop up thoſe channels of remittance, is, in effect, to prohibit the conſumption of the manufactures of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as our deſires to procure them have at all times been equal to, and ſometimes exceed, our ability to pay for them. Whence it follows, that a policy which enſures a ſmall immediate revenue, at the expence of a great, though indirect
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0151302000:124"/>national gain, is mean and ſordid, unworthy the noble enterprizing ſpirit of a commercial nation.</p>
                  <p>BUT I ſhould leave this ſubject very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect indeed, if I ſhould omit two great funds of national wealth and power, the FISHERIES and the FUR-TRADE. The firſt of theſe is a mine richer than that of <hi>Potoſi,</hi> and more inexhauſtible. For while our Fiſheries ſerve as a great ſubject of commerce, they are alſo a fruitful nurſery of brave, hardy ſeamen, trained up to fatigue, to difficulty and danger.</p>
                  <p>THE FUR-TRADE, which is now ſecured almoſt beyond the reach of accident, is dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly valuable, as it is enjoyed ſolely and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively —an advantage which is not confined to a monopoly of the raw materials, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hances their price only, but enables <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to be both the merchant, and the manufacturer alſo, and that upon her own terms; while other nations muſt depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a precarious uncertain ſupply, which which may either be raiſed in its price, or totally withheld, as the fluctuating policy of intereſt or friendſhip ſhall require. This
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0151302000:125"/>acquiſition is not only valuable, as it will probably revive a languiſhing, dying manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory, but as it is a preſent, an actual, and conſiderable ſource of revenue, both on the home conſumption, and alſo on that of foreigners.</p>
                  <p>THESE are a few of the principal advantages with which a proper cultivation, eſtabliſhment and tender regard of the Colonies may be attended to the mother country. She has likewiſe many inferior ones. The reſidence of thoſe of affluent fortunes who may be led thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by veiws of education, or mere curioſity is not altogether unworthy regard. Theſe all depend on, and can only flow from a perfect compleat Union—by ſupporting that relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onſhip between the Mother country and her Colonies, which has planted in their boſoms ſo ſtrong and lively an affection, as to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh <hi>Great-Britain</hi> by the tender endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing appellation of HOME.</p>
                  <p>BUT 'tis time now that we ſhould turn to the COLONIES and ſee what advantages they may propoſe to themſelves from a dutiful and affectionate UNION with the mother country; and from our paſt feelings we ſhall readily
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0151302000:126"/>acknowledge we ſtand in need of her protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nurture and care. Expoſed by our ſituation, by a rivalſhip and competition of Intereſts, and yet in a ſtate of infancy, it would be extremely difficult, if not impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, to form any Union among ourſelves that would be ſufficient to repel the attacks of a formidable invader. In this weak, this defenceleſs ſtate, therefore, we muſt look up to our indulgent parent, whoſe vigorous, ſalutary aid we have ſo often already expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced. Upon her we muſt rely for ſupport, and under her wing ſhelter ourſelves againſt any attempts of thoſe, whoſe principles and government are incompatible with our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and Liberty. A ſeparation would be attended with certain ruin to the Colonies, in thier preſent ſituation, as they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily fall a prey to one or other of thoſe powers, who would ſnatch with eagerneſs ſo tempting a prize.</p>
                  <p>THE firſt principle of nature, ſelf-preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, therefore, dictates to the Colonies, a ſteady, a ſtrict adherence to the mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, as upon that depends the enjoyment of every invaluable privilege of a civil or religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature. But we may not only conſider her
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0151302000:127"/>as the protector, but as the nurſing mother of her Colonies. Arts, Sciences, Agriculture and Commerce, riſe by ſlow degrees, and are long before they arrive to any degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. They are not of quick or ſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taneous growth. They muſt be planted, cheriſhed and encouraged. And have we not experienced the tenderneſs of our mother country in this reſpect, by her bounties diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed not only in public channels, but by private ſocieties and patriotic individuals? Have we not reaſon to expect a continuance and perhaps an increaſe of her benevolent efforts in our behalf? Thus taking our enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing genius by the hand, and leading it on in the paths of induſtry and uſeful im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements.</p>
                  <p>To turn the attention of the Colonies to the cultivation of thoſe ſubjects of Commerce which the mother country does not, or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not produce, tho' to her it may be eventually profitable, is to the Colonies immediately and directly ſo; and when it is done by mild, by bountiful meaſures, deſerves our gratitude and thankful returns. A fixed and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent UNION between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her Colonies, is abſolutely neceſſary for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0151302000:128"/>of the peace and harmony of their internal adminiſtration. For to form the conſtitution and plan of a new government, or even to new model and reviſe the old, is no eaſy or inconſiderable taſk. That of the mother country has been the work of ages; and, to uſe the words of an eminent writer, ſeems dictated by wiſdom itſelf. While, therefore, the coloniſts can enjoy all the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of an <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtitution undiminiſhed and uninterrupted, it would be ſuperlative madneſs and folly to run the riſk of a change, which could not poſſibly be for the better, and might be infinitely worſe. Unconnected and divided as they are at preſent, both in ſituation and intereſt (owing to the difference of Settlement, of Charters, of Religion, and Commerce, which are often claſhing) how difficult, and next to impoſſible, would it be to reſcue them from a ſtate of anarchy; and form a conſtitution, for which I will venture to ſay from the extent of <hi>America,</hi> there can no precedent be found; a conſtitution which at the ſame time that it reconciles theſe jar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring intereſts, muſt preſerve every religious and civil Liberty intire?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0151302000:129"/>THE difficulties of an Union for the purpoſes of empire, are almoſt inſuperable. To canton out the provinces into petty independent kingdoms, beſides the arduous taſk of ſettling the internal police, would ſubject them not only to perpetual quarrels with each other, but render them an eaſy prey to ſome foreign power, as they would ſingly be weak, though united under one head, truly formidable. The only remaining reſource of deſperate diſtreſs, muſt be to form the provinces into diſtricts, having full power of legiſlation within themſelves—but ſubject to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul of ſome ſupreme, ſuperintendant au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority raiſed out of the collective body, as in ſome inſtances in <hi>Germany,</hi> or with more probability like <hi>Holland</hi> or <hi>Switzerland.</hi> But this the vaſt extent of the Colonies will render almoſt impoſſible, as it would give being to an ariſtocracy—a kind of government as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the genius and temper of <hi>America,</hi> as deſpotic monarchy.</p>
                  <p>I THEREFORE repeat it, that the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our laws, commerce, and every other bleſſing of domeſtic peace, by the wiſe policy of the mother country, can only be made the baſis of a cloſe and firm connection between her and them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0151302000:130"/>NEXT to the ſecurity of a ſtate, its wealth and convenience are to be regarded, and to judge how beneficial <hi>Great-Britain</hi> is to the Colonies in this reſpect, it may be proper to remark, that as other countries produce the ſame commodities, and have hitherto been able to underſell the <hi>Americans</hi> in a variety of articles, wherever an excluſive, or even a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable market has been given to the latter, the advantage muſt be obvious. This has been done in many inſtances by prohibitions, or by duties charged on ſuch commodities as interfered with thoſe from the Colonies, which in ſome caſes amount to a prohibition. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> Whale Fiſhery has been almoſt wholly given up, in favour of the <hi>American</hi> Fiſheries. Sugars, Hemp, Indigo and Tobacco, beſides a variety of other articles from the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, have met with every mark of encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while the ſame commodities from other countries have been diſcountenanced, or whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prohibited. This is wiſe and juſt policy in the mother country, at the ſame time that it diſcovers a tender regard to her children, and makes it their intereſt to unite more cloſely. In ſhort they have every thing that can make a nation great, happy and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to hope from a Union, every thing that is dangerous to fear from a diviſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0151302000:131"/>
                     <hi>"Divide et impera,"</hi> was the <hi>Roman</hi> mot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. May it not be applicable to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her <hi>American</hi> Colonies, who, if united, have proved themſelves equal, nay ſuperior to two of the principal powers of <hi>Europe;</hi> but if divided, if ſtruggling with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtine commotions and civil diſcord, I fear will prove unable to contend with either. This, to uſe the expreſſion of a great and eminent friend of the Colonies, is the <hi>grand</hi> FAMILY COMPACT, which muſt be cemented by every tie of duty, loyalty and affection from the Provinces, and every mark of kind protecting tenderneſs from the mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. A fatal, underſcerning policy had almoſt ſnapt theſe intereſting cords aſunder, never perhaps to have been cloſed again; but the guardian genius of <hi>Britain</hi> and of <hi>America</hi> ſtept between them and ruin, and with out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtretched hand ſaved a ſinking nation.</p>
                  <p>THE <hi>Romans</hi> decreed a crown to him who ſaved the life of a citizen in battle; but what crowns or ſtatues can do ſufficient honour to the Man or Men who ſave a country, a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, in the hour of diſtreſs, and reſcue a fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtate from the brink of ruin? <hi>Rome</hi> may juſtly boaſt her <hi>Brutus</hi>'s, her <hi>Curtius</hi>'s, her
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0151302000:132"/>
                     <hi>Cato</hi>'s and her <hi>Tully</hi>'s — they were the PITTS, the <hi>Conways</hi> and the <hi>Barres</hi> of that age, alike warmed by the ſacred fire of <hi>Liberty,</hi> alike crowned with Immortality, and handed down to poſterity the wonder and delight of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring nations. Theſe glorious architects, nobly aided by many others whoſe names will be held in long veneration, have prop'd the tottering fabrick of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> EMPIRE, and pointed out that noble, generous policy, which will make one great ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof <hi>Britain</hi> will be the common centre of attraction.</p>
                  <p>UNDER ſuch a policy, we can with joy look forwards, and behold PEACE, LIBERTY and COMMERCE diffuſing their kindly influence over all the parts of GREAT-BRITAIN's <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire;</hi> whoſe true happineſs and permanent ſecurity can be no way effectually eſtabliſhed but by "a perpetual UNION between her and her AMERICAN COLONIES!"</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>T this important juncture, when the eyes of all <hi>America</hi> are lifted to the mother country in anxious expectation; when trembling fear or bold defiance, enlivening hope or myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſurmiſe, diſtract every breaſt and ſit in every brow; what ſubject can be more inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting than the "Reciprocal advantages of a perpetual Union between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her Colonies"? and yet there is no ſubject, perhaps, which the public is ſo little diſpoſed to receive with candour, and judge of with impartiality. How then ſhall a native of <hi>America,</hi> and an unexperienced writer, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in matters of ſuch high importance, preſume to draw his pen? But the worthy Gentleman who has propoſed this ſubject, and back'd his propoſal with the reward of diſtinguiſhed honour, has raiſed in us who are
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0151302000:134"/>candidates on this occaſion, that ambition which hath, in all ages, prompted men to greater undertakings than cooler judgement would have ſuffered them to engage in.</p>
                  <p>I Do not mean, in this <hi>little Eſſay,</hi> to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the advantages of <hi>trade</hi> between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her Colonies, in order to ſhew that they are <hi>reciprocal.</hi> By the very nature of Commerce they muſt be ſo. There is no country in the world that exports ſtaple com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities or manufactures, but for an advantage to be gained; or imports them, but for the ſame reaſon.</p>
                  <p>As the God of nature has adapted different countries to abound in different kinds of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, or excell in various uſeful arts; it is evident, that a commercial intercourſe muſt redound to the benefit of the whole. But how muſt this advantage be increaſed when we conſider that <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> in her trade with her Colonies, does not ſupport a foreign peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whoſe religion, politics and cuſtoms are different from her own; but ſhe ſupports and nouriſhes her own offspring, at the ſame time that ſhe enriches herſelf by the natural profits of an extenſive trade; and ſhe ſtrengthens herſelf by protecting and encouraging her own religion, government and cuſtoms, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted to <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0151302000:135"/>COMMERCE between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her Colonies, is like the wholeſome food which a man eats. He cannot ſay, his head, his hands or his feet, are more particularly bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by it; but the finer parts thereof circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late through the whole body, and the whole body is nouriſhed and ſupported.</p>
                  <p>THE three grand objects worthy the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a wiſe people, are the ſtate of their <hi>Commerce, Liberty</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> If the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce,</hi> the <hi>Liberty,</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> both of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her Colonies can alone be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and ſtrengthened by a cloſe and laſting Union between them, then the <hi>reciprocal ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages</hi> of ſuch an UNION muſt be ſelf-evident.</p>
                  <p>I HAVE ſlightly touched the firſt of theſe. There have been ſo many accurate mercantile calculations made in almoſt every pamphlet that has been lately publiſhed on the ſubject, that I take it for granted, as a truth univerſally admitted, that the advantages of trade between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her Colonies are reciprocal.</p>
                  <p>WITH reſpect to <hi>political Liberty,</hi> ſhould it not be the glory of <hi>England</hi> to tranſplant, to water and carefully to nurſe, even in a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0151302000:136"/>diſtant land, a ſyſtem of government which is the admiration of the world; and ſhould not <hi>America</hi> adopt, and chearfully ſubmit to ſuch a government? Were it poſſible for <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> with an high and arbitrary hand, to think of ſnatching from her Colonies the eſſential privileges of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and yet would have them ſubmit as <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> to her government, and bear only the name and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the free-born ſons of Liberty; it would be to dreſs her ſlaves in livery, and deck <hi>America</hi> in robes of paper, to make her the contempt and deriſion of every other nation. On the other hand, ſhould the Colonies, with baſe ingratitude, attempt to throw off all dependance on the mother country, they would put themſelves in the ſituation of a ſilly girl, who leaves the guidance and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of a wiſe and affectionate parent, and wandering away expoſes herſelf to ruin by the artful inſinuations of every wicked and deſigning ſtranger. But why ſhould the mutual connection between the parent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>country and her Colonies ever come into queſtion? Are we not one nation and one people? And do we not own obedience to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0151302000:137"/>one common King? Thoſe who adopt the ſame religion, the ſame plans of government, and the ſame cuſtoms, are undoubtedly of the ſame nation. Different climates and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſoils mark out countries, but not nations. We of <hi>America,</hi> are in all reſpects <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> notwithſtanding that the <hi>Atlantic</hi> rolls her waves between us and the throne to which we all own allegiance. Nor can we, though in ever ſo flouriſhing a ſtate, throw off our dependance, or diſſolve this <hi>Union,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking the very bonds of nature. As well might the branch ſay unto the trunk, See how I glow with bloſſoms and wave with foliage: I have no further need of thy ſap, keep it for thy own nouriſhment!</p>
                  <p>ON the other hand, does not <hi>Great-Britain</hi> by tranſplanting her conſtitution into <hi>America,</hi> as a ſcion from the ſtock, propagate her own likeneſs? Nay, does ſhe not make unto her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf another crown and another ſceptre?</p>
                  <p>IN all attacks that ſhall be made upon <hi>Great-Britain</hi> by the numerous rivals of her power, and enemies to her proſperity; her colonies, like a number of dutiful and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0151302000:138"/>children, growing up round her, will more and more add to her ſtrength, and contribute to her importance. And ſhould it ever happen, amid the revolution of things human, that thoſe enemies ſhould prevail againſt her, what could her ſons loſe but the beautiful iſland they have ſo long poſſeſſed? Even in that caſe (which we truſt and believe will never happen) they might find in the Colonies a ſure aſylum; thither they might remove with all the noble privileges of their conſtitution, as to a people and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try they can call their own; and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> throne might yet ſhine with undiminiſhed glory even in the preſent wilds of <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>LASTLY, with reſpect to the religious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the people of <hi>England,</hi> how precious they are, let the price which has been paid for them declare — And theſe will be as much ſtrengthened by a perpetual <hi>Union</hi> with the colonies, as their civil liberties.</p>
                  <p>BUT excluſive of this conſideration, it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly muſt be the glory of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> to propagate, protect and encourage in her co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies that ſacred ſyſtem of religious truth
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0151302000:139"/>which ſhe holds ſo dear. Indeed that ſhe herſelf judges in this manner is evident from her many charitable donations for promoting the intereſt of learning and virtue in <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>IN ſhort, the Proteſtant Religion, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly that excellent branch of it the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church of England, is the pure and healthful air in which the political conſtitution of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> moves and breathes with health and vigour; religious Liberty being hereby fixed on as firm and broad a baſis as Civil Liberty; both of which are ſo eſſentially interwoven with the nature of her govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that it cannot be adminiſtered without them. Nor can her empire be more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ſtrengthened, than by extending with it whatever ſhe finds valuable in her own poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion. This is her intereſt, and it muſt be her honour, as it is likewiſe the intereſt and honour of the Colonies to receive, nouriſh and join with her in the ſupport of every thing of this kind, which can only be done by a perpetual Union between them.</p>
                  <p>How deteſtable then muſt the politician be, who ſhall ever attempt to kindle the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0151302000:140"/>flames of jealouſy between two friends, whom nature ſeems to have united in the cloſeſt bonds, and whoſe hearts and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts are and ever ought to be one? Should any one ever ſucceed in this (which God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid) I doubt not but that after much cruel contention and unnatural bloodſhed, each would ruſh into the other's arms, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatically cry out, "We are both in the wrong."</p>
                  <p>THIS ſubject might be expanded into vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, and no doubt will be; but I leave the full diſcuſſion of it to more able hands; and humbly hope this <hi>little Eſſay</hi> will be accepted as the oblation of one who intimately feels the importance of this great truth, that "a perpetual Union between <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and her Colonies will ever be reciprocally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous."</p>
