            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The Caterpillar of this ſingular Inſect is very common in May; it is of a green colour, with a white ſtripe down the back, and one on each ſide; it caſts its ſkin ſeveral times.</p>
               <p>We have obſerved ſome Caterpillars which were quite ſmooth, after caſting their ſkin become rough or covered with hairs; and others which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0622600704:7"/>
were white become black by the ſame proceſs; in this caterpillar we have obſerved a ſimilar change: a ſpecimen which was of a plain green as before deſcribed, became ſuddenly ſpotted with black as ſhewn in our plate, that ſkin being caſt off it aſſumed its former appearance and became a pupa.</p>
               <p>It feeds on graſs, nettles, &amp;c. near the ſides of ditches, and is found ſporting in the evening, when in the fly ſtate among the graſs and herbage.</p>
               <p>The Caterpillar becomes a Pupa about the beginning of June.—It affixes itſelf by the tail to a ſtalk of graſs in the ſame manner as thoſe of the Butterfly genus, and like them is often found with the head ſuſpended downwards; it can by a ſudden ſpring turn itſelf upright again.</p>
               <p>In a little book entitled the AURELIAN'S POCKET COMPANION, by Moſes Harris, we find this ſpecies deſcribed, and called the <hi>White Plumed,</hi> but the Linnaean ſpecified Name <hi>Didactyla</hi> is added:—And under the Linnaean name Pentadactyla (our preſent ſpecimen) he has deſcribed the <hi>Brown plumed</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Another ſpecimen of the ſame diviſion of the genus <hi>(Aluctae)</hi> but of a brown colour "Alis fiſſis fuſcis, &amp;c." <hi>Linn.</hi>
                  </note>.—The ſame confuſion is extended to his folio work the AURELIAN. In Plate 1. he has figured the White plumed under the ſpecific name Didactyla, and in Plate 30, the Brown plume, under Pentadactyla. Linnaeus has compriſed all thoſe Lepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopterous Inſects whoſe wings appear to conſiſt of ſeveral diſtinct feathers, connected only at the ſhafts, under the ſubdiviſion <hi>Aluctae,</hi> but Fabricius has given them the new name PTEROPHORUS, and added the name Alucitae to a ſmall diviſion of the Tinea, as Phal. Chriſtyloſtella, &amp;c. of <hi>Linn.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Phal. Pentadactyla appears in the perfect ſtate about the latter end of June, ſometimes earlier.</p>

               <p>We have never found this Inſect common, though it muſt not be conſidered as a rare ſpecies; it is ſeldom met with near London: our ſpecimen was found in the Caterpillar ſtate at Dartford in May. It changed to Chryſalis in June. The fly came forth in September.</p>
               <p>The male is rather ſmaller than the female generally, though not always. The ſtrength of their colours is very inconſtant, eſpecially in the female, which we have ſeen very dark in ſome ſpecimens; in others nearly as pale as the male; the general diſtinction however between the two ſexes is, the male being of a light grey with ſpots and waves of brown, the female of an obſcure brown with ſpots more diffuſed.</p>

               <p>The wonderful inſtinct that directs the ſmalleſt Inſects to provide for the ſafety of their future progeny, never fails to ſtrike the attention of the inquiſitive reſearcher into their oeconomy.—To perpetuate their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0622600704:35"/>
race is the great end of their being, and the moſt aſtoniſhing effort of their ingenuity and care is employed to perfect this grand deſign. We not only find innumerable eggs, and larvae of Inſect on all kinds of plants; in all ſtanding waters; and in animal matter, when putrid; but many which can only be hatched from the egg by the warmth of living animals; thus the Tabanus pierces the thick hide of the Cow, and plunges its eggs into the fleſh; the heat and moiſture of which nouriſhes both in the egg, and larva; the Hippoboſca equina pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trudes its eggs into the <hi>rectum</hi> of Horſes; and the Ichneumon into living Caterpillars: to thoſe we could add many remarkable inſtances of Inſects, who have ſhewn a lower ſpecies of perception, by depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their eggs in places where the larvae would find abundance of proper food; and with ſuch ingenious contrivances for their ſafety in a defenceleſs ſtate, as we could only expect from the ſagacity of larger animals; but it is only our intention to premiſe with thoſe general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, leſt the ſubject we have choſen for our preſent Plate ſhould be conſidered as a ſolitary example of ſuch ingenuity, and care towards their future offspring.</p>
               <p>The Natural Hiſtory of the Common Bee has been both fully and ably treated of, by <hi>Schirach, Maraldi, Reaumur, Debraw,</hi> and other authors of reſpectability, and may be ſuppoſed to be pretty generally known by thoſe converſant in rural affairs; the manners, however, of other ſpecies of the ſame genus has neither been ſo fully explained, nor examined; they yet preſent a fund for the enquiries of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſt, equally worthy his attention; though leſs beneficial; as the honey they make cannot be converted to our uſe.</p>
               <p>Among the ſolitary Bees, ſome penetrate into the earth, ſcoop out hollow cavities; then poliſh the ſides within, and depoſit their eggs, with proper food for the larvae, till it becomes a Pupa. Others form neſts of looſe ſand, which they glue together with a ſtrong cement; thoſe neſts are generally formed againſt walls that are expoſed to the ſouth; without, they are rude and irregular, but within are very neatly finiſhed, and divided into ſeveral cells or apartments, in each of which the Parent Bee lodges an egg. Of our preſent, and a few other ſpecies, we may ſay,

               <p>We find this ſeaſon, the Apis Centuncularis has done conſiderable injury among the Timber Plantations in <hi>Eſſex;</hi> and we have ſimilar information from ſome parts of <hi>Cambridgeſhire.</hi> A Gentleman ſent me (early in the Spring) a piece of Oak, containing a quantity of the larva, from his plantation at <hi>Birdbrook,</hi> in <hi>Eſſex.</hi> He informs me, ſeveral Gentlemen in his neighbourhood had found large trunks of apparently healthy Oaks, completely perforated and filled with the larva of this miſchievous Inſect; in many inſtances the trunk had been materially injured, and the caſes were arranged as ſhewn by the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zontal Section at Fig. 4, in our Plate.—The perforations were in a longitudinal direction, ſeveral feet through the ſolid timber, and when the leaves were freſh, appeared as ſhewn at Fig. 1.</p>
               <p>The Inſect commences its operation at the upper part of the trunk of the tree; then boring in an oblique direction for about two inches or more, it follows a longitudinal courſe, it divides the ligneous fibres, or threads, till it forms the diameter of the cavity, which is about three-eighths of an inch, its depth various; ſometimes only a few inches, at others, conſiderably more; when the cavity is entirely formed, and all the duſt and fragments cleared away, it finiſhes the ſides perfectly ſmooth; the hardeſt knot in the timber being inſufficient to reſiſt the ſtrength of its jaws.—The cavity, when finiſhed, appears divided by ſlight ridges, placed at the diſtance of about three quarters of an inch from each other; this ſerves to regulate the ſize of each apartment or cell; and it now only remains to be lined for the reception of the egg: this lining is generally compoſed of roſe-leaves; and is applied to the apartments in a very curious manner: the Parent Bee flies with a leaf to the orifice of the perforation, where ſhe clips it round to the ſize of the hole; this is forced to the bottom of the loweſt cell; about ſeven, eight, or ten of ſuch pieces form the firſt layer; it next forms the ſides, or cylindrical part of the lining; this is done by laying ſeveral whole leaves partly over each
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0622600704:37"/>
other, as ſhewn in our Plate, and cementing them together with a glutinous ſubſtance; thus the ſides and bottom, each conſiſting of ſeveral layers, being finiſhed, (in the form of a thimble) the Bee partly fills it with a kind of paſte, then throws over it a ſmall quantity of leaves, reduced to powder, and depoſits the egg; the covering to the whole is formed of the ſame materials, and in the ſame manner as the bottom; when ſhe has forced about ten or fifteen circular pieces of leaves into the avenue and cemented them to the top, the covering is completed, and the egg is completely ſecured from accident.—The covering ſeparated is ſhewn in the Plate, at fig. 3, the larvae, at fig. 2.</p>
               <p>In this manner ſhe proceeds with, and finiſhes every cell diſtinctly, till the perforation is entirely filled: in ſome trees forty or fifty ſuch perforations are placed within a quarter of an inch of each other.— The Bee comes forth late in Auguſt; if the loweſt is formed before thoſe above, it eats its way up the channel, through their caſes.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> in his Eſſay on the Microſcope, mentions a remarkable circumſtance of a Bee (we ſuſpect of this ſpecies). "A friend of mine (ſays he) had a piece of wood cut from a ſtrong poſt <note n="*" place="bottom">We learn this poſt was fir.</note> that ſupported the roof of a cart-houſe, full of theſe cells or round holes, three-eighths of an inch diameter, and about three-fourths deep, each of which was filled with theſe roſe-leaf caſes, finely covered in at top and bottom."</p>

                  <p>It has been ſuſpected by ſome Entomologiſts, that this Inſect ſhould only be conſidered as a variety of Curculio Argentatus. Much of its beautiful appearance depends on the time we take it in; when firſt hatched its colours are very rich and highly gloſſed with gold, but it gradually becomes dirty brown, or almoſt black.</p>
                  <p>The cauſe of this alteration in its appearance is eaſily perceived by the microſcope; the firſt, or ground colour is dark brown, but is entirely covered with oblong ſcales of various beautiful colours, particularly of a reddiſh gold, or bronze, interſperſed with thoſe of green, and brown colour; when the Inſect is firſt hatched, the ſcales lay over each other ſo as to conceal the ground colour; but as they rub off, or are otherwiſe injured, the brown becomes the general colour.—They vary alſo very much from red, to
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0622600704:41"/>
yellow, or green hues, when firſt hatched; and are ſometimes found late in the ſeaſon, with almoſt every ſcale rubbed off.</p>

               <p>A very rare ſpecies of Phalaena. In the perfect ſtate it is ſeldom met with; and in the Caterpillar ſtate few Collectors are acquainted with its haunts. It feeds on the ſallow, willow, and poplar, and may be found ſometimes by ſtripping off the bark of thoſe trees.</p>

                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0622600704:49"/>Our ſpecimen was taken in the vicinity of Oak-of-Honor Hill, Surry.

                  <p>The ſmall Caterpillars are of a dark purpliſh colour, when nearly full fed they have a yellow under ſide marked with black, with the back purple; before they change to the pupa ſtate, they become almoſt brown.</p>

               <head>PHALAENA ANASTOMOSIS. FIG. IV.</head>
               <p>Since the publication of the laſt Number, we have been favoured with a moſt beautiful ſpecimen of the Moth figured in the 124th Plate of this Work, and preſent a figure of it to our ſubſcribers, together with the ſeveral changes of the Phalaena Haſtata; it will ſhew how very liable this Inſect is to variation in its colours, ſize, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We find alſo that though this Inſect has been named Phalaena Anaſtomoſis in the moſt ſcientific Cabinets in London, and always received as ſuch by the beſt authority, it is not the Inſect referred to by Fabricius in his Species Inſectorum under that title; that Author, as well as Linnaeus, refers under the ſpecific name <hi>Ph. Curtula</hi> to the 43d Plate of the third Volume of Roeſel's Inſects; in this Plate is figured a Moth which is certainly a ſpecies diſtinct from our Inſect, and is well known by its Linnaean name <hi>Curtula,</hi> or Engliſh title <hi>Chocolate Tip;</hi> yet Fabricius gives an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional reference for the ſame ſpecies to the 11th Plate of Roeſel's
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0622600704:62"/>
fourth Volume of Inſects, and in this we find the figure of a Moth whoſe markings and general appearance correſpond with our ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, though its colours are totally different, being a very pale grey with ſcarcely any dark colour near the apex of the wings; the larva much more reſembles our figure, and induces us to conclude, that though the figure of this laſt Moth is ſo extremely different, it is probably intended for the ſame ſpecies as our Inſect; and therefore that the two diſtinct ſpecies have been confounded together, by a falſe quotation of Linnaeus's Amanuenſis.</p>
               <p>And we are partly confirmed in this ſuppoſition by the words of Linnaeus himſelf; he ſays, <hi>Ph. Anaſtomoſis</hi> is very like <hi>Ph. Curtula,</hi> but the Moth figured in Roeſel's plate, and referred to in the Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyms under Anaſtomoſis, does not bear the leaſt reſemblance to it; —our Inſect on the contrary, though evidently a diſtinct ſpecies, is not unlike it.</p>

            <p>The preſent ſpecies is perhaps not uncommon in many places, but it is very difficult to diſcover its hiding-places in the day-time; its chirp is ſometimes heard in a calm Summer's evening, about ſun-ſet, iſſuing from the buſhes where it is concealed; and from which it ſeldom ventures till night: it continues its chirping at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals till morning.</p>
            <p>The female ſeems to prefer a warm, and rather moiſt ſituation, to depoſit her eggs in, and this is commonly the ſide of a bank that is expoſed to the ſun; but is well covered with graſs and other herbage to keep it moiſt. She is furniſhed with a ſharp double edged ſheath, like a <hi>ſword,</hi> with which ſhe opens the ground in a perpendicular direction; firſt ſcooping out a convenient cylindrical aperture, and then widening the lower part into a ſpacious apartment for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of the eggs. <hi>See</hi> Fig. I.</p>
            <p>When the Inſect burſts from the egg it is very minute, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Wings; in this ſtate it nips the tender ſhoots of graſs, &amp;c. It ſoon increaſes in ſize and aſſumes the pupa form; in which ſtate though the Wings are not perfect, their rudiments appear next the Thorax: it continues in this ſtate till it has nearly acquired its full ſize before the Wings burſt open from the protuberances.</p>

               <p>The Caterpillars of the Grey Dagger-Moth is frequently found on fruit trees; particularly on the cherry: it feeds alſo on the willow and poplar, and on almoſt all plants indiſcriminately when confined in the breeding cage.

               <p>Among an almoſt endleſs variety of ſpecies, which the tribes of Inſects preſent, few have a more ſingular appearance than the little creature we have ſelected for our preſent ſubject. It is perhaps one of the moſt curious pieces of natural mechaniſm (if we may be allowed the expreſſion) that can be conceived, for of a moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated fabric which the wings appear, every part, though ſeparate,
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0622600704:83"/>
acts in perfect uniſon with the reſt; in moſt winged Inſects we find the tendons of each wing united by ſtrong membranaceous webs, which prevent any one from acting without the others, but in this every tendon muſt perform a diſtinct part, and yet perfectly in conformity with the reſt to aſſiſt the Inſect in its flight. When the Inſect reſts the feathers fold over one another; but when it flies, they are thrown open, and reſemble a full expanded fan.</p>
               <p>The natural ſize of this ſingular creature is given at Fig. 1. and as a more correct figure than can be ſhewn in ſuch a ſmall compaſs was thought neceſſary, its magnified appearance is repreſented at Fig. 2.</p>
               <p>The plumes of this Inſect differs ſo much from thoſe of other Moths, that we have alſo added, at Fig. 3, the appearance of the upper part of one, as ſeen by a very deep lens of the Microſcope; by this the ſtem or quil is obſerved covered with ſcales of the form uſually found on other Moths, but the ſides are finely feathered with long hairs, in tufts, alternately of a light and dark colour, and which, owing to the minuteneſs of the Inſect appear like patches of an uniform colour, before it is examined with the Microſcope.</p>
               <p>This Inſect is not uncommon in Summer, it flies about hedges in the evening.</p>

                  <p>A figure of this Inſect is given in Villers's Entomology as a native of France; in this he follows the authority of Fourcroy, who has a deſcription of the ſame ſpecies in his Catalogue of Inſects, found in the environs of Paris. This laſt author calls it Le Cigale renflée, from its puffed or ſwelled appearance. The name given by Villers is Cicada dilatata.</p>
                  <p>The confuſion made by Fabricius, in his alterations of the <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naean genera,</hi> renders it doubtful whether he has deſcribed this Inſect, though, from its being commonly found in moſt parts of Europe, we muſt ſuppoſe he has not paſſed over it without notice: we have examined his laſt work, (Entomologia Syſtematica, &amp;c.) and cannot find an Inſect anſwering our ſpecies with any reference either to Fourcroy or Villers, we therefore prefer the ſpecific name given by the latter author.</p>
                  <p>Is found in June; and is leſs common than any Inſect of the ſame genus hitherto given in this work.</p>

               <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0622600704:93"/>The Phalaena Meticuloſa certainly exceeds many other Inſects of the ſame tribe for elegance and ſimplicity: the variety of teints ſo delicately, indeed almoſt inſenſibly ſoftened into one another, and neatneſs of the waves and lines interſperſed over the whole, amply compenſate for the defection of more gaudy colours. In the cater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pillar ſtate it is ſcarcely leſs deſerving attention; the yellow ſpecks on a beautiful, yet lucid green, have a very pleaſing effect. The web it ſpins round its pupa is of a fine white colour, and ſilky tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the pupa within of a blackiſh chocolate colour.</p>
            <p>This ſpecies is ſometimes met with in plenty, though leſs ſo in ſome ſeaſons than in others; and not unfrequently is more abundant when the ſeaſon appears moſt unfavourable. It feeds on nettles chiefly, but we have found it on ſeveral other plants; and once on a young oak, in Kent; the leaves of which we fed it on ſome time. In the caterpillar ſtate it is found in April, changes to the pupa ſtate in May, the Moth appears in June.</p>

               <p>Early in July we find this ſpecies flying about the narrow paths and lanes in woods where Oaks are plenty. It is obſerved to ſhelter itſelf in the day time, generally among ſuch trees as have the foliage

thick and the bark covered with moſs, &amp;c. and very ſeldom among young trees. In the Caterpillar ſtate it lives concealed in a fine ſilky web, ſpun up on the leaves. When it is diſturbed it drops by a ſingle thread from one branch to another, the glutinous ſubſtance of the thread adhering wherever it touches, ſo that if it is damaged in any part the Inſect is in no danger of falling, unleſs the laſt faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening breaks off. The Caterpillar changes to the pupa ſtate early in June: the firſt appearance of the Moth is commonly about the end of the ſame month.</p>
               <p>In England we have another ſmall Moth (Phalaena Chlorana) which at firſt ſight may be miſtaken for Phalaena Viridana. It differs from this Inſect in ſeveral reſpects; the under Wings are whiter, and the ſtripe along the anterior margin of the upper Wings incline more to a cream colour than in our preſent ſpecies; the Caterpillar alſo is very different and feeds on the Willow.</p>
