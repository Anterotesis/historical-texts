         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE unfortunate Licinius was the laſt rival who oppoſed the greatneſs, and the laſt captive who adorned the triumph, of Conſtantine. After a tranquil and proſperous reign, the Conqueror bequeathed to his family the inheritance of the Roman Empire; a new capital, a new policy, and a new religion; and the innovations which he eſtabliſhed have been embraced and conſecrated by ſucceeding genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The age of the great Conſtantine and his ſons is filled with important events; but the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian muſt be oppreſſed by their number and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0034700103:9"/>
unleſs he diligently ſeparates from each other the ſcenes which are connected only by the order of time. He will deſcribe the political in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions that gave ſtrength and ſtability to the empire, before he proceeds to relate the wars and revolutions which haſtened its decline. He will adopt the diviſion unknown to the ancients, of civil and eccleſiaſtical affairs: the victory of the Chriſtians, and their inteſtine diſcord, will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply copious and diſtinct materials both for edifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and for ſcandal.</p>
            <p>After the defeat and abdication of Licinius, <note place="margin">Deſign of a new ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital.</note> his victorious rival proceeded to lay the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a city, deſtined to reign, in future times, <note place="margin">A. D. 324.</note> the miſtreſs of the Eaſt, and to ſurvive the empire and religion of Conſtantine. The motives, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of pride or of policy, which firſt induced Diocletian to withdraw himſelf from the ancient ſeat of government, had acquired additional weight by the example of his ſucceſſors, and the habits of forty years. Rome was inſenſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the dependent kingdoms which had once acknowledged her ſupremacy; and the country of the Caeſars was viewed with cold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference by a martial prince, born in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of the Danube, educated in the courts and armies of Aſia, and inveſted with the purple by the legions of Britain. The Italians, who had received Conſtantine as their deliverer, ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively obeyed the edicts which he ſometimes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to addreſs to the ſenate and people of Rome; but they were ſeldom honoured with the preſence of their new ſovereign. During the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0034700103:10"/>
of his age, Conſtantine, according to the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious exigencies of peace and war, moved with ſlow dignity, or with active diligence, along the frontiers of his extenſive dominions; and was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prepared to take the field either againſt a foreign or a domeſtic enemy. But as he gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reached the ſummit of proſperity and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of life, he began to meditate the deſign of fixing in a more permanent ſtation the ſtrength as well as majeſty of the throne. In the choice of an advantageous ſituation, he preferred the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines of Europe and Aſia; to curb, with a power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful arm, the barbarians who dwelt between the Danube and the Tanais; to watch with an eye of jealouſy the conduct of the Perſian monarch, who indignantly ſupported the yoke of an ignominious treaty. With theſe views, Diocletian had ſelected and embelliſhed the reſidence of Nicomedia: but the memory of Diocletian was juſtly abhorred by the protector of the church; and Conſtantine was not inſenſible to the ambition of founding a city which might perpetuate the glory of his own name. During the late operations of the war againſt Licinius, he had ſufficient opportunity to contemplate, both as a ſoldier and as a ſtateſman, the incomparable poſition of Byzantium; and to <note place="margin">Situation of Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium.</note> obſerve how ſtrongly it was guarded by nature againſt an hoſtile attack, whilſt it was acceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible on every ſide to the benefits of commercial intercourſe. Many ages before Conſtantine, one of the moſt judicious hiſtorians of antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty <note n="1" place="bottom">Polybius, l. iv. p. 423. edit. Caſaubon. He obſerves that the peace of the Byzantines was frequently diſturbed, and the extent of their territory contracted, by the inroads of the wild Thracians.</note>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0034700103:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had deſcribed the advantages of a ſituation, from whence a feeble colony of Greeks derived the command of the ſea, and the honours of a flouriſhing and independent republic <note n="2" place="bottom">The navigator Byzas, who was ſtyled the ſon of Neptune, founded the city 656 years before the Chriſtian Aera. His followers were drawn from Argos and Megara. Byzantium was afterwards rebuilt and fortified by the Spartan general Pauſanias. See Scaliger Animadverſ. ad Euſeb. p. 81. Ducange Conſtantinopolis, l. i. part i. cap. 15, 16. With regard to the wars of the Byzantines againſt Philip, the Gauls, and the kings of Bithynia, we ſhould truſt none but the ancient writers who lived before the greatneſs of the imperial city had excited a ſpirit of flattery and fiction.</note>.</p>
            <p>If we ſurvey Byzantium in the extent which it <note place="margin">Deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of CON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>STANTI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NOPLE.</note> acquired with the auguſt name of Conſtantinople, the figure of the imperial city may be repreſented under that of an unequal triangle. The obtuſe point, which advances towards the eaſt and the ſhores of Aſia, meets and repels the waves of the Thracian Boſphorus. The northern ſide of the city is bounded by the harbour; and the ſouthern is waſhed by the Propontis, or ſea of Marmara. The baſis of the triangle is oppoſed to the weſt, and terminates the continent of Europe. But the admirable form and diviſion of the circumjacent land and water cannot, without a more ample ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, be clearly or ſufficiently underſtood.</p>
            <p>The winding channel through which the waters <note place="margin">The Bol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phorus.</note> of the Euxine flow with a rapid and inceſſant courſe towards the Mediterranean, received the appellation of Boſphorus, a name not leſs cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0034700103:12"/>
in the hiſtory, than in the fables, of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity <note n="3" place="bottom">The Boſphorus has been very minutely deſcribed by Dionyſius of Byzantium, who lived in the time of Domitian (Hudſon Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph. Minor. tom. iii.), and by Gilles or Gyllius, a French tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller of the XVIth century. Tournefort (Lettre XV.) ſeems to have uſed his own eyes and the learning of Gyllius.</note>. A crowd of temples and of votive al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, profuſely ſcattered along its ſteep and woody banks, atteſted the unſkilfulneſs, the terrors, and the devotion of the Grecian navigators, who, after the example of the Argonauts, explored the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the inhoſpitable Euxine. On theſe banks tradition long preſerved the memory of the palace of Phineus, infeſted by the obſcene harpies <note n="4" place="bottom">There are very few conjectures ſo happy as that of Le Clerc (Bibliotheque Univerſelle, tom. i. p. 248.), who ſuppoſes that the harpies were only locuſts. The Syriac or Phaenician name of thoſe inſects, their noiſy flight, the ſtench and devaſtation which they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and the north wind which drives them into the ſea, all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to form this ſtriking reſemblance.</note>; and of the ſylvan reign of Amycus, who defied the ſon of Leda to the combat of the Ceſtus <note n="5" place="bottom">The reſidence of Amycus was in Aſia, between the old and the new caſtles, at a place called Laurus Inſana. That of Phineus was in Europe, near the village of Mauromole and the Black Sea. See Gyllius de Boſph. l. ii. c. 23. Tournefort, Lettre XV.</note>. The ſtreights of the Boſphorus are terminated by the Cyanean rocks, which, according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of the poets, had once floated on the face of the waters; and were deſtined by the gods to protect the entrance of the Euxine againſt the eye of profane curioſity <note n="6" place="bottom">The deception was occaſioned by ſeveral pointed rocks, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately covered and abandoned by the waves. At preſent there are two ſmall iſlands, one towards either ſhore: that of Europe is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by the column of Pompey.</note>. From the Cyanean rocks to the point and harbour of Byzantium, the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0034700103:13"/>
winding length of the Boſphorus extends about ſixteen miles <note n="7" place="bottom">The ancients computed one hundred and twenty ſtadia, or fifteen Roman miles. They meaſured only from the new caſtles, but they carried the ſtreights as far as the town of Chalcedon.</note>, and its moſt ordinary breadth may be computed at about one mile and a half. The <hi>new</hi> caſtles of Europe and Aſia are conſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, on either continent, upon the foundations of two celebrated temples, of Serapis and of Jupiter Urius. The <hi>old</hi> caſtles, a work of the Greek em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, command the narroweſt part of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, in a place where the oppoſite banks advance within five hundred paces of each other. Theſe fortreſſes were reſtored and ſtrengthened by Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet the Second, when he meditated the ſiege of Conſtantinople <note n="8" place="bottom">Ducas Hiſt. c. 34. Leunclavius Hiſt. Turcia Muſulmanica, l. xv. p. 577. Under the Greek empire theſe caſtles were uſed as ſtate priſons, under the tremendous name of Lethe, or towers of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion.</note>: but the Turkiſh conqueror was moſt probably ignorant, that near two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years before his reign, Darius had choſen the ſame ſituation to connect the two continents by a bridge of boats <note n="9" place="bottom">Darius engraved in Greek and Aſſyrian letters on two marble columns, the names of his ſubject-nations, and the amazing num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of his land and ſea forces. The Byzantines afterwards tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported theſe columns into the city, and uſed them for the altars of their tutelar deities. Herodotus, l. iv. c. 87.</note>. At a ſmall diſtance from the old caſtles we diſcover the little town of Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis, or Scutari, which may almoſt be conſidered as the Aſiatic ſuburb of Conſtantinople. The Boſphorus, as it begins to open into the Propon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis, paſſes between Byzantium and Chalcedon. The latter of thoſe cities was built by the Greeks,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0034700103:14"/>
a few years before the former; and the blindneſs of its founders, who overlooked the ſuperior ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the oppoſite coaſt, has been ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized by a proverbial expreſſion of contempt <note n="10" place="bottom">Namque artiſſimo inter Europam Aſiamque divortio Byzan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tium in extremâ Europâ poſuere Graeci, quibus, Pythium Apolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem conſulentibus ubi conderent urbem, redditum oraculum eſt, quaererent ſedem <hi>caecorum</hi> terris adverſam.

            <p>The harbour of Conſtantinople, which may be <note place="margin">The port.</note> conſidered as an arm of the Boſphorus, obtained, in a very remote period, the denomination of the <hi>Golden Horn.</hi> The curve which it deſcribes might be compared to the horn of a ſtag, or, as it ſhould ſeem, with more propriety, to that of an ox <note n="11" place="bottom">Strabo, l. x. p. 492. Moſt of the antlers are now broke off; or, to ſpeak leſs figuratively, moſt of the receſſes of the harbour are filled up. See Gyllius de Boſphoro Thracio, l. i. c. 5.</note>. The epithet of <hi>golden</hi> was expreſſive of the riches which every wind wafted from the moſt diſtant countries into the ſecure and capacious port of Conſtantinople.

                  <p>Zeuxippus was an epithet of Jupiter, and the baths were a part of old Byzantium. The difficulty of aſſigning their true ſituation has not been felt by Ducange.

Many opulent ſenators of Rome, and of the Eaſtern provinces, were probably invited by Conſtantine to adopt for their country the fortunate ſpot which he had choſen for his own reſidence.

In this divine hierarchy (for ſuch it is frequently ſtyled), every rank was marked with the moſt ſcrupulous exactneſs, and its dignity was diſplayed in a variety of trifling and ſolemn ceremonies, which it was a ſtudy to learn, and a ſacrilege to neglect <note n="74" place="bottom">The emperor Gratian, after confirming a law of precedency publiſhed by Valentinian, the father of his <hi>Divinity,</hi> thus continues: Siquis igitur indebitum ſibi locum uſurpaverit, nulla ſe ignoratione defendat; ſitque plane <hi>ſacrilegii</hi> reus, qui <hi>divina</hi> praecepta neglexerit.

Two hundred years before, the race of the Metelli themſelves were confounded among the Plebeians of Rome; and from the etymology of their name of <hi>Caecilius,</hi> there is reaſon to believe that thoſe haughty nobles derived their origin from a ſutler.</note>. The Patrician families, on the other hand, whoſe original number was never recruited till the end of the commonwealth, either failed in the ordinary courſe of nature, or were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed in ſo many foreign and domeſtic wars, or, through a want of merit or fortune, inſenſibly mingled with the maſs of the people <note n="95" place="bottom">In the year of Rome 800, very few remained, not only of the old Patrician families, but even of thoſe which had been created by Caeſar and Auguſtus.

But this extravagant number is too much even for the whole Sena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torial order, unleſs we ſhould include all the Roman knights who were diſtinguiſhed by the permiſſion of wearing the laticlave.</note>. Little more was left, when Conſtantine aſcended the throne, than a vague and imperfect tradition, that the Patricians had once been the firſt of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.

            <p n="2">II. The fortunes of the Praetorian praefects <note place="margin">The Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</note> were eſſentially different from theſe of the conſuls and patricians. The latter ſaw their ancient great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs evaporate in a vain title. The former, riſing by degrees from the moſt humble condition, were inveſted with the civil and military adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Roman world. From the reign of Severus to that of Diocletian, the guards and the palace, the laws and the finances, the armies and the provinces, were intruſted to their ſuperintend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing care; and, like the Vizirs of the Eaſt, they held with one hand the ſeal, and with the other the ſtandard, of the empire. The ambition of the praefects, always formidable, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fatal to the maſters whom they ſerved, was ſupported by the ſtrength of the Praetorian bands; but after thoſe haughty troops had been weakened by Diocletian, and finally ſuppreſſed by Conſtantine, the praefects, who ſurvived their fall, were reduced without difficulty to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of uſeful and obedient miniſters. When they were no longer reſponſible for the ſafety of the emperor's perſon, they reſigned the juriſdiction which they had hitherto claimed and exerciſed over all the departments of the palace. They were deprived by Conſtantine of all military com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, as ſoon as they had ceaſed to lead into the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0034700103:50"/>
field, under their immediate orders, the flower of the Roman troops; and at length, by a ſingular revolution, the captains of the guards were trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed into the civil magiſtrates of the provinces. According to the plan of government inſtituted by Diocletian, the four princes had each their Praetorian praefect; and, after the monarchy was once more united in the perſon of Conſtantine, he ſtill continued to create the ſame number of FOUR PRAEFECTS, and entruſted to their care the ſame provinces which they already adminiſtered. 1. The praefect of the Eaſt ſtretched his ample juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction into the three parts of the globe which were ſubject to the Romans, from the cataracts of the Nile to the banks of the Phaſis, and from the mountains of Thrace to the frontiers of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia. 2. The important provinces of Pannonia, Dacia, Macedonia, and Greece, once acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the authority of the praefect of Illyricum. 3. The power of the praefect of Italy was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to the country from whence he derived his title; it extended over the additional territory of Rhaetia as far as the banks of the Danube, over the dependent iſlands of the Mediterranean, and over that part of the continent of Africa which lies between the confines of Cyrene and thoſe of Tingitania. 4. The praefect of the Gauls com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended under that plural denomination the kindred provinces of Britain and Spain, and his authority was obeyed from the wall of Antoninus to the fort of Mount Atlas <note n="99" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. ii. p. 109, 110.

After the Praetorian praefects had been diſmiſſed from all military command, the civil functions which they were ordained to exerciſe over ſo many ſubject nations, were adequate to the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and abilities of the moſt conſummate mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. To their wiſdom was committed the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme adminiſtration of juſtice and of the finances, the two objects which, in a ſtate of peace, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend almoſt all the reſpective duties of the ſovereign and of the people; of the former, to protect the citizens who are obedient to the laws; of the latter, to contribute the ſhare of their property which is required for the expences of the ſtate.

It may be ſufficient for the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian to ſelect two ſingular and ſalutary proviſions intended to reſtrain the abuſe of authority. 1. For the preſervation of peace and order, the governors of the provinces were armed with the ſword of juſtice. They inflicted corporal puniſhments, and they exerciſed, in capital offences, the power of life and death. But they were not authoriſed to indulge the condemned criminal with the choice of his own execution, or to pronounce a ſentence of the mildeſt and moſt honourable kind of exile. Theſe prerogatives were reſerved to the praefects, who alone could impoſe the heavy fine of fifty pounds of gold: their vicegerents were confined to the trifling weight of a few ounces <note n="114" place="bottom">The preſidents, or conſulars, could impoſe only two ounces; the vice-praefects, three; the proconſuls, count of the eaſt, and praefect of Egypt, ſix. See Heineccii Jur. Civil. tom. i. p. 75. Pandect. l. xlviii. tit. xix. n. 8. Cod. Juſtinian. l. i. tit. liv. leg. 4. 6.</note>. This diſtinction, which ſeems to grant the larger, while it denies the ſmaller degree of authority, was founded on a very rational motive. The ſmaller degree was infinitely more liable to abuſe. The paſſions of a provincial magiſtrate might fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently provoke him into acts of oppreſſion,
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0034700103:59"/>
which affected only the freedom or the fortunes of the ſubject; though, from a principle of prudence, perhaps of humanity, he might ſtill be terrified by the guilt of innocent blood. It may likewiſe be conſidered, that exile, conſiderable fines, or the choice of an eaſy death, relate more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to the rich and the noble; and the perſons the moſt expoſed to the avarice or reſentment of a provincial magiſtrate, were thus removed from his obſcure perſecution to the more auguſt and impartial tribunal of the Praetorian praefect. 2. As it was reaſonably apprehended that the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity of the judge might be biaſſed, if his intereſt was concerned, or his affections were engaged; the ſtricteſt regulations were eſtabliſhed, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any perſon, without the ſpecial diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the emperor, from the government of the province where he was born <note n="115" place="bottom">Ut nulli patriae ſuae adminiſtratio ſine ſpeciali principis permiſſu permittatur.

The firſt experiment was made of their judicial talents, by appointing them to act occaſionally as aſſeſſors to the magiſtrates; from thence they were often raiſed to preſide in the tribunals before which they had pleaded.

From the time of Commodus to the reign of Conſtantine, near one hundred governors might be enumerated, who, with various ſucceſs, erected the ſtandard of revolt; and though the innocent were too often ſacrificed, the guilty might be ſometimes prevented, by the ſuſpicious cruelty of their maſter <note n="125" place="bottom">The Abbé Dubos, who has examined with accuracy (ſee Hiſt. de la Monarchie Françoiſe, tom. i. p. 41—100. edit. 1741.) the inſtitutions of Auguſtus and of Conſtantine, obſerves, that if Otho had been put to death the day before he executed his conſpiracy, Otho would now appear in hiſtory as innocent as Corbulo.</note>.

All theſe provincial generals were therefore <hi>dukes;</hi> but no more than ten among them were dignified with the rank of <hi>counts</hi> or companions, a title of honour, or rather of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which had been recently invented in the
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0034700103:66"/>
court of Conſtantine. A gold belt was the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign which diſtinguiſhed the office of the counts and dukes; and beſides their pay, they received a liberal allowance ſufficient to maintain one hundred and ninety ſervants, and one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty-eight horſes. They were ſtrictly prohibited from interfering in any matter which related to the adminiſtration of juſtice or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue; but the command which they exerciſed over the troops of their department, was inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of the authority of the magiſtrates. About the ſame time that Conſtantine gave a legal ſanction to the eccleſiaſtical order, he inſtituted in the Roman empire the nice balance of the civil and the military powers. The emulation, and ſometimes the diſcord, which reigned between two profeſſions of oppoſite intereſts and incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible manners, was productive of beneficial and of pernicious conſequences. It was ſeldom to be expected that the general and the civil governor of a province ſhould either conſpire for the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance, or ſhould unite for the ſervice, of their country. While the one delayed to offer the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance which the other diſdained to ſolicit, the troops very frequently remained without orders or without ſupplies; the public ſafety was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, and the defenceleſs ſubjects were left ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the fury of the Barbarians.

military diſcipline, and prepared the ruin of the empire. The nineteen years which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded his final victory over Licinius, had been a period of licenſe and inteſtine war. The rivals who contended for the poſſeſſion of the Roman world, had withdrawn the greateſt part of their forces from the guard of the general frontier; and the principal cities which formed the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary of their reſpective dominions were filled with ſoldiers, who conſidered their countrymen as their moſt implacable enemies. After the uſe of theſe internal garriſons had ceaſed with the civil war, the conqueror wanted either wiſdom or firmneſs to revive the ſevere diſcipline of Diocletian, and to ſuppreſs a fatal indulgence, which habit had endeared and almoſt confirmed to the military or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.

The moſt flouriſhing cities were oppreſſed by the intolerable weight of quarters. The ſoldiers inſenſibly forgot the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of their profeſſion, and contracted only the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0034700103:68"/>

It was in vain that Conſtantine repeated the moſt dreadful menaces of fire and ſword againſt the Borderers who ſhould dare to deſert their colours, to connive at the inroads of the Barbarians, or to

            <p>The ſame timid policy, of dividing whatever is <note place="margin">Reduction of the legions.</note> united, of reducing whatever is eminent, of dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every active power, and of expecting that the moſt feeble will prove the moſt obedient, ſeems to pervade the inſtitutions of ſeveral princes, and particularly thoſe of Conſtantine.

The reſources of the Roman trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury were exhauſted by the encreaſe of pay, by the repetition of donatives, and by the invention of new emoluments and indulgences, which, in the opinion of the provincial youth, might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſate the hardſhips and dangers of a military life.

although ſlaves, at leaſt by a tacit connivance, were indiſcriminately received into the ranks, the inſurmountable difficulty of procuring a regular and adequate ſupply of volunteers, obliged the emperors to adopt more effectual and coercive methods. The lands beſtowed on the veterans, as the free reward of their valour, were hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forwards granted under a condition, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the firſt rudiments of the feudal tenures; that their ſons, who ſucceeded to the inheritance, ſhould devote themſelves to the profeſſion of arms, as ſoon as they attained the age of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; and their cowardly refuſal was puniſhed by the loſs of honour, of fortune, or even of life <note n="136" place="bottom">See the two titles, De Veteranis, and De Filiis Veteranorum, in the ſeventh book of the Theodoſian Code.

His mind was more ſeriouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged by the general direction of the poſts and arſenals of the empire. There were thirty-four cities, fifteen in the eaſt, and nineteen in the weſt, in which regular companies of workmen were perpetually employed in fabricating defenſive ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, offenſive weapons of all ſorts, and military engines, which were depoſited in the arſenals, and occaſionally delivered for the ſervice of the troops. 3.

But this obſcure point of antiquity is conteſted by other writers.</note>; a ſimilar aſſiſtant was granted to every proconſul, and to every praetor, who exerciſed a military or provincial command; with the extent of conqueſt, the two quaeſtors were gradually multiplied to the number of four,

Whilſt Auguſtus affected to maintain the freedom of election, he conſented to accept the annual privilege of recommending, or rather indeed of nominating, a certain propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of candidates; and it was his cuſtom to ſelect one of theſe diſtinguiſhed youths, to read his ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or epiſtles in the aſſemblies of the ſenate <note n="147" place="bottom">Sueton. in Auguſt. c. 65. and Torrent. ad loc.

their minute and intricate detail) conſiſted of two diſtinct operations; the reſolving the general im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition into its conſtituent parts, which were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed on the provinces, the cities, and the indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals of the Roman world; and the collecting the ſeparate contributions of the individuals, the cities, and the provinces, till the accumulated ſums were poured into the Imperial treaſuries. But as the account between the monarch and the ſubject was perpetually open, and as the renewal of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand anticipated the perfect diſcharge of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding obligation, the weighty machine of the finances was moved by the ſame hands round the circle of its yearly revolution. Whatever was honourable or important in the adminiſtration of the revenue, was committed to the wiſdom of the praefects, and their provincial repreſentatives; the lucrative functions were claimed by a crowd of ſubordinate officers, ſome of whom depended on the treaſurer, others on the governor of the province; and who, in the inevitable conflicts of a perplexed juriſdiction, had frequent opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities of diſputing with each other the ſpoils of the people. The laborious offices, which could be productive only of envy and reproach, of expence and danger, were impoſed on the <hi>Decurions,</hi> who formed the corporations of the cities, and whom the ſeverity of the Imperial laws had condemned to ſuſtain the burthens of civil ſociety <note n="172" place="bottom">The title concerning the Decurions (l. xii. tit. i.) is the moſt ample in the whole Theodoſian Code; ſince it contains not leſs than one hundred and ninety-two diſtinct laws to aſcertain the duties and privileges of that uſeful order of citizens.</note>. The
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0034700103:92"/>
whole landed property of the empire (without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the patrimonial eſtates of the monarch) was the object of ordinary taxation; and every new purchaſer contracted the obligations of the former proprietor. An accurate <hi>cenſus</hi>

The lands were meaſured by ſurveyors, who were ſent into the provinces; their nature, whether arable or paſture, or vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards or woods, was diſtinctly reported; and an eſtimate was made of their common value from the average produce of five years. The numbers of ſlaves and of cattle conſtituted an eſſential part of the report; an oath was adminiſtered to the proprietors, which bound them to diſcloſe the true ſtate of their affairs; and their attempts to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varicate, or elude the intention of the legiſlator, were ſeverely watched, and puniſhed as a capital crime, which included the double guilt of treaſon and ſacrilege <note n="174" place="bottom">Siquis ſacrilegâ vitem falce ſucciderit, aut feracium Ramorum foetus hebetaverit, quo declinet fidem Cenſuum, et mentiatur callide paupertatis ingenium, mox detectus capitale ſubibit exitium, et bona ejus in Fiſci jura migrabunt. Cod. Theod. l. xiii. tit. xi. leg. 1. Although this law is not without its ſtudied obſcurity, it is, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, clear enough to prove the minuteneſs of the inquiſition, and the diſproportion of the penalty.</note>. A large portion of the tribute

was paid in money; and of the current coin of the empire, gold alone could be legally accepted <note n="175" place="bottom">The aſtoniſhment of Pliny would have ceaſed. Equidem miror P.

The remainder of the taxes, according to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions determined by the annual indiction, was furniſhed in a manner ſtill more direct, and ſtill more oppreſſive. According to the different na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of lands, their real produce, in the various articles of wine or oil, corn or barley, wood or iron, was tranſported by the labour or at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the provincials to the Imperial maga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zines, from whence they were occaſionally diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted, for the uſe of the court, of the army, and of the two capitals, Rome and Conſtantinople. The commiſſioners of the revenue were ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obliged to make conſiderable purchaſes, that they were ſtrictly prohibited from allowing any compenſation, or from receiving in money the value of thoſe ſupplies which were exacted in kind. In the primitive ſimplicity of ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, this method may be well adapted to collect the almoſt voluntary offerings of the people; but it is at once ſuſceptible of the utmoſt latitude and of the utmoſt ſtrictneſs, which in a corrupt and abſolute monarchy muſt introduce a perpetual conteſt between the power of oppreſſion and the arts of fraud <note n="176" place="bottom">Some precautions were taken (ſee Cod.

The avarice of an unlettered governor would ſupply the ignorance of precept or precedent.</note>. The agriculture of the

Roman provinces was inſenſibly ruined, and, in the progreſs of deſpotiſm, which tends to diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point its own purpoſe, the emperors were obliged to derive ſome merit from the forgiveneſs of debts, or the remiſſion of tributes, which their ſubjects were utterly incapable of paying. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the new diviſion of Italy, the fertile and happy province of Campania, the ſcene of the early victories and of the delicious retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the citizens of Rome, extended between the ſea and the Appenine from the Tyber to the Silarus. Within ſixty years after the death of Conſtantine, and on the evidence of an actual ſurvey, an exemption was granted in favour of three hundred and thirty thouſand Engliſh acres of deſert and uncultivated land; which amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to one-eighth of the whole ſurface of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. As the footſteps of the Barbarians had not yet been ſeen in Italy, the cauſe of this amazing deſolation, which is recorded in the laws, can be aſcribed only to the adminiſtration, of the Roman emperors <note n="177" place="bottom">Cod.

The returns which were ſent of every province or diſtrict, expreſſed the number of tributary ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and the amount of the public impoſitions. The latter of theſe ſums was divided by the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; and the eſtimate, that ſuch a province con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained ſo many <hi>capita,</hi> or heads of tribute; and that each <hi>head</hi> was rated at ſuch a price, was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received, not only in the popular, but even in the legal computation. The value of a tributary head muſt have varied, according to many accidental, or at leaſt fluctuating circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but ſome knowledge has been preſerved of a very curious fact, the more important, ſince it relates to one of the richeſt provinces of the Roman empire, and which now flouriſhes as the moſt ſplendid of the European kingdoms. The rapacious miniſters of Conſtantius had exhauſted the wealth of Gaul, by exacting twenty-five pieces of gold for the annual tribute of every head. The humane policy of his ſucceſſor reduced the capitation to ſeven pieces <note n="179" place="bottom">Quid profuerit <hi>(Julianus)</hi> anhelantibus extremâ penuriâ Gallis, hinc maxime claret, quod primitus partes eas ingreſſus, pro <hi>capitibus</hi> ſingulis tributi nomine vicenos quinos aureos reperit flagitari; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedens vero ſeptenos tantum munera univerſa complentes.

A moderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between theſe oppoſite extremes of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary oppreſſion and of tranſient indulgence, may therefore be fixed at ſixteen pieces of gold,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0034700103:96"/>
or about nine pounds ſterling, the common ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard perhaps of the impoſitions of Gaul <note n="180" place="bottom">In the calculation of any ſum of money under Conſtantine and his ſucceſſors, we need only refer to the excellent diſcourſe of Mr. Greaves on the Denarius, for the proof of the following prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples: 1. That the ancient and modern Roman pound, containing 5256 grains of Troy weight, is about one twelfth lighter than the Engliſh pound, which is compoſed of 5760 of the ſame grains. 2. That the pound of gold, which had once been divided into forty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eight <hi>aurei,</hi> was at this time coined into ſeventy-two ſmaller pieces of the ſame denomination. 3. That five of theſe aurei were the legal tender for a pound of ſilver, and that conſequently the pound of gold was exchanged for fourteen pounds eight ounces of ſilver, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Roman, or about thirteen pounds according to the Engliſh, weight. 4. That the Engliſh pound of ſilver is coined into ſixty-two ſhillings. From theſe elements we may compute the Roman pound of gold, the uſual method of reckoning large ſums, at forty pounds ſterling; and we may fix the currency of the <hi>aureus</hi> at ſomewhat more than eleven ſhillings.</note>. But this calculation, or rather indeed the facts from whence it is deduced, cannot fail of ſuggeſting two difficulties to a thinking mind, who will be at once ſurpriſed by the <hi>equality,</hi> and by the <hi>enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity</hi> of the capitation. An attempt to explain them may perhaps reflect ſome light on the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting ſubject of the finances of the declining empire.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is obvious, that, as long as the immutable conſtitution of human nature produces and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains ſo unequal a diviſion of property, the moſt numerous part of the community would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of their ſubſiſtence, by the equal aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a tax from which the ſovereign would derive a very trifling revenue. Such indeed might be the theory of the Roman capitation; but in the practice, this unjuſt equality was no longer
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0034700103:97"/>
felt, as the tribute was collected on the principle of a <hi>real,</hi> not of a <hi>perſonal</hi> impoſition. Several indigent citizens contributed to compoſe a ſingle <hi>head,</hi> or ſhare of taxation; while the wealthy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial, in proportion to his fortune, alone repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſeveral of thoſe imaginary beings. In a poetical requeſt, addreſſed to one of the laſt and moſt deſerving of the Roman Princes who reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Gaul, Sidonius Apollinaris perſonifies his tribute under the figure of a triple monſter, the Geryon of the Grecian fables, and intreats the new Hercules that he would moſt graciouſly be pleaſed to ſave his life by cutting off three of his heads <note n="181" place="bottom">

               </note>. The fortune of Sidonius far exceeded the cuſtomary wealth of a poet; but if he had purſued the alluſion, he muſt have painted many of the Gallic nobles with the hundred heads of the deadly Hydra, ſpreading over the face of the country, and devouring the ſubſtance of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred families. II. The difficulty of allowing an annual ſum of about nine pounds ſterling, even for the average of the capitation of Gaul, may be rendered more evident by the compariſon of the preſent ſtate of the ſame country, as it is now go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the abſolute monarch of an induſtrious, wealthy and affectionate people. The taxes of France cannot be magnified, either by fear or by
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0034700103:98"/>
flattery, beyond the annual amount of eighteen millions ſterling, which ought perhaps to be ſhared among four-and-twenty millions of inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants <note n="182" place="bottom">This aſſertion, however formidable it may ſeem, is founded on the original regiſters of births, deaths, and marriages, collected by public authority, and now depoſited in the <hi>Contrôle General</hi> at Paris. The annual average of births throughout the whole kingdom, taken in five years (from 1770 to 1774, both incluſive) is, 479, 649 boys, and 449, 269 girls, in all 928, 918 children. The province of French Hainault alone furniſhes 9906 births: and we are aſſured, by an actual numeration of the people annually repeated from the year 1773 to the year 1776, that, upon an average, Hainault con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 257,097 inhabitants. By the rules of fair analogy, we might infer, that the ordinary proportion of annual births to the whole people, is about 1 to 26; and that the kingdom of France contains 24, 151, 868 perſons of both ſexes and of every age. If we content ourſelves with the more moderate proportion of 1 to 25, the whole population will amount to 23, 222, 950. From the diligent reſearches of the French government (which are not unworthy of our own imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation), we may hope to obtain a ſtill greater degree of certainty on this important ſubject.</note>. Seven millions of theſe, in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of fathers, or brothers, or huſbands, may diſcharge the obligations of the remaining multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of women and children; yet the equal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of each tributary ſubject will ſcarcely riſe above fifty ſhillings of our money, inſtead of a proportion almoſt four times as conſiderable, which was regularly impoſed on their Gallic an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. The reaſon of this difference may be found, not ſo much in the relative ſcarcity or plenty of gold and ſilver, as in the different ſtate of ſociety in ancient Gaul and in modern France. In a country where perſonal freedom is the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of every ſubject, the whole maſs of taxes, whether they are levied on property or on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, may be fairly divided among the whole
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0034700103:99"/>
body of the nation. But the far greater part of the lands of ancient Gaul, as well as of the other provinces of the Roman world, were cultivated by ſlaves, or by peaſants, whoſe dependent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition was a leſs rigid ſervitude <note n="183" place="bottom">Cod.

In ſuch a ſtate the poor were maintained at the expence of the maſters, who enjoyed the fruits of their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and as the rolls of tribute were filled only with the names of thoſe citizens who poſſeſſed the means of an honourable, or at leaſt of a decent ſubſiſtence, the comparative ſmallneſs of their numbers explains and juſtifies the high rate of their capitation. The truth of this aſſertion may be illuſtrated by the following example: The Aedui, one of the moſt powerful and civilized tribes or <hi>cities</hi> of Gaul, occupied an extent of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory, which now contains above five hundred thouſand inhabitants, in the two eccleſiaſtical dioceſes of Autun and Nevers <note n="184" place="bottom">The ancient juriſdiction of <hi>(Auguſtodunum)</hi> Autun in Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gundy, the capital of the Aedui, comprehended the adjacent ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory of <hi>(Noviodunum)</hi> Nevers. See d'Anville, Notice de l'ancienne Gaule, p. 491. The two dioceſes of Autun and Nevers are now compoſed, the former of 610, and the latter of 160, pariſhes. The regiſters of births, taken during eleven years, in 476 pariſhes of the ſame province of Burgundy, and multiplied by the moderate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of 25 (ſee Meſſance Recherches ſur la Population, p. 142.), may authoriſe us to aſſign an average number of 656 perſons for each pariſh, which being again multiplied by the 770 pariſhes of the dioceſes of Nevers and Autun, will produce the ſum of 505, 120 perſons for the extent of country which was once poſſeſſed by the Aedui.</note>; and with the
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0034700103:100"/>
probable acceſſion of thoſe of Châlons and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>çon <note n="185" place="bottom">We might derive an additional ſupply of 301, 750 inhabitants from the dioceſes of Châlons <hi>(Cabillonum)</hi> and of Maçon <hi>(Matiſco);</hi> ſince they contain, the one 200, and the other 260, pariſhes. This acceſſion of territory might be juſtified by very ſpecious reaſons. 1. Châlons and Maçon were undoubtedly within the original juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of the Aedui.

They do not appear to have been epiſcopal ſeats before the fifth and ſixth centuries. Yet there is a paſſage in Eume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius (Panegyr.

In the time of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine, the territory of the Aedui afforded no more than twenty-five thouſand <hi>heads</hi> of capita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of whom ſeven thouſand were diſcharged by that prince from the intolerable weight of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute <note n="186" place="bottom">Eumenius in Panegyr.

But this tax, or capitation, on the proprietors of land, would have ſuffered a rich and numerous claſs of free citizens to eſcape. With the view <note place="margin">Capitation on trade and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.</note> of ſharing that ſpecies of wealth which is derived from art or labour, and which exiſts in money or in merchandiſe, the emperors impoſed a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct and perſonal tribute on the trading part of their ſubjects <note n="188" place="bottom">See Cod.

Some indulgence was granted to the profeſſion of the liberal arts: but every other branch of commercial induſtry was affected by the ſeverity of the law. The honourable mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant of Alexandria, who imported the gems and ſpices of India for the uſe of the weſtern world; the uſurer, who derived from the intereſt of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney a ſilent and ignominious profit; the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious manufacturer, the diligent mechanic, and even the moſt obſcure retailer of a ſequeſtered village, were obliged to admit the officers of the revenue into the partnerſhip of their gain: and the ſovereign of the Roman empire, who tolerated the profeſſion, conſented to ſhare the infamous ſalary, of public proſtitutes. As this general tax upon induſtry was collected every fourth year, it was ſtyled the <hi>Luſtral Contribution:</hi> and the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian Zoſimus <note n="189" place="bottom">Zoſimus, l. ii. p. 115.

of the citizens, who were often compelled by the impending ſcourge to embrace the moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horred and unnatural methods of procuring the ſum at which their property had been aſſeſſed. The teſtimony of Zoſimus cannot indeed be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from the charge of paſſion and prejudice, but, from the nature of this tribute, it ſeems reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to conclude that it was arbitrary in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution, and extremely rigorous in the mode of collecting. The ſecret wealth of commerce, and the precarious profits of art or labour, are ſuſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible only of a diſcretionary valuation, which is ſeldom diſadvantageous to the intereſt of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury; and as the perſon of the trader ſupplies the want of a viſible and permanent ſecurity, the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the impoſition, which, in the caſe of a land-tax, may be obtained by the ſeizure of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, can rarely be extorted by any other means than thoſe of corporal puniſhments. The cruel treatment of the inſolvent debtors of the ſtate, is atteſted, and was perhaps mitigated by a very humane edict of Conſtantine, who, diſclaiming the uſe of racks and of ſcourges, allots a ſpacious and airy priſon for the place of their confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <note n="190" place="bottom">Cod.

            <p>Theſe general taxes were impoſed and levied by the abſolute authority of the monarch; but the <note place="margin">Free gifts.</note> occaſional offerings of the <hi>coronary gold</hi> ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the name and ſemblance of popular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.

to the ſucceſs of the Roman arms; and even the cities of Italy, who admired the virtues of their victorious general, adorned the pomp of his triumph by their voluntary gifts of crowns of gold, which, after the ceremony, were conſecrated in the temple of Jupiter, to remain a laſting monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his glory to future ages. The progreſs of zeal and flattery ſoon multiplied the number, and increaſed the ſize, of theſe popular donations; and the triumph of Caeſar was enriched with two thouſand eight hundred and twenty-two maſſy crowns, whoſe weight amounted to twenty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand four hundred and fourteen pounds of gold. This treaſure was immediately melted down by the prudent dictator, who was ſatisfied that it would be more ſerviceable to his ſoldiers than to the gods: his example was imitated by his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; and the cuſtom was introduced, of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing theſe ſplendid ornaments for the more acceptable preſent of the current gold coin of the empire <note n="191" place="bottom">See Lipſius de Magnitud.

The ſubjects of Conſtantine were incapable of diſcerning the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of genius and manly virtue, which ſo far degraded them below the dignity of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors; but they could feel and lament the rage of tyranny, the relaxation of diſcipline, and the encreaſe of taxes. The impartial hiſtorian, who acknowledges the juſtice of their complaints, will obſerve ſome favourable circumſtances which tended to alleviate the miſery of their condition.

            <p>THE character of the prince who removed the ſeat of empire, and introduced ſuch important changes into the civil and religious <note place="margin">Character of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine.</note> conſtitution of his country, has fixed the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and divided the opinions, of mankind. By the grateful zeal of the Chriſtians, the deliverer of the church has been decorated with every at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of a hero, and even of a ſaint; while the diſcontent of the vanquiſhed party has compared Conſtantine to the moſt abhorred of thoſe tyrants, who, by their vice and weakneſs, diſhonoured the Imperial purple. The ſame paſſions have in ſome degree been perpetuated to ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and the character of Conſtantine is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, even in the preſent age, as an object either of ſatire or of panegyric. By the impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial union of thoſe defects which are confeſſed by his warmeſt admirers, and of thoſe virtues which are acknowledged by his moſt implacable ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, we might hope to delineate a juſt portrait of that extraordinary man, which the truth and candour of hiſtory ſhould adopt without a

Euſebius and Zoſimus form indeed the two extremes of flattery and invective. The intermediate ſhades are expreſſed by thoſe writers, whoſe character or ſituation variouſly tempered the influence of their religious zeal.</note>. But it would ſoon appear, that the vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to blend ſuch diſcordant colours, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile ſuch inconſiſtent qualities, muſt produce a figure monſtrous rather than human, unleſs it is viewed in its proper and diſtinct lights, by a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſeparation of the different periods of the reign of Conſtantine.</p>
            <p>The perſon, as well as the mind of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, <note place="margin">His vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.</note> had been enriched by nature with her choiceſt endowments. His ſtature was lofty, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance majeſtic, his deportment graceful; his ſtrength and activity were diſplayed in every manly exerciſe, and from his earlieſt youth, to a very advanced ſeaſon of life, he preſerved the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour of his conſtitution by a ſtrict adherence to the domeſtic virtues of chaſtity and temperance. He delighted in the ſocial intercourſe of familiar converſation; and though he might ſometimes indulge his diſpoſition to raillery with leſs reſerve than was required by the ſevere dignity of his ſtation, the courteſy and liberality of his manners gained the hearts of all who approached him. The ſincerity of his friendſhip has been ſuſpected; yet he ſhewed, on ſome occaſions, that he was not incapable of a warm and laſting attachment. The diſadvantage of an illiterate education had not prevented him from forming a juſt eſtimate
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0034700103:108"/>
of the value of learning; and the arts and ſciences derived ſome encouragement from the munificent protection of Conſtantine. In the diſpatch of buſineſs, his diligence was indefatigable; and the active powers of his mind were almoſt continually exerciſed in reading, writing, or meditating, in giving audience to ambaſſadors, and in examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the complaints of his ſubjects. Even thoſe who cenſured the propriety of his meaſures were compelled to acknowledge, that he poſſeſſed mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity to conceive, and patience to execute, the moſt arduous deſigns, without being checked either by the prejudices of education, or by the clamours of the multitude. In the field, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed his own intrepid ſpirit into the troops, whom he conducted with the talents of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate general; and to his abilities, rather than to his fortune, we may aſcribe the ſignal victories which he obtained over the foreign and domeſtic foes of the republic. He loved glory, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, perhaps as the motive, of his labours. The boundleſs ambition, which, from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his accepting the purple at York, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears as the ruling paſſion of his ſoul, may be juſtified by the dangers of his own ſituation, by the character of his rivals, by the conſciouſneſs of ſuperior merit, and by the proſpect that his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs would enable him to reſtore peace and order to the diſtracted empire. In his civil wars againſt Maxentius and Licinius, he had engaged on his ſide the inclinations of the people, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the undiſſembled vices of thoſe tyrants, with the ſpirit of wiſdom and juſtice which ſeemed
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0034700103:109"/>
to direct the general tenor of the adminiſtration of Conſtantine <note n="2" place="bottom">The virtues of Conſtantine are collected for the moſt part from Eutropius, and the younger Victor, two ſincere pagans, who wrote after the extinction of his family. Even Zoſimus, and the <hi>Emperor</hi> Julian, acknowledge his perſonal courage and military achievements.</note>.</p>
            <p>Had Conſtantine fallen on the banks of the <note place="margin">His vices.</note> Tyber, or even in the plains of Hadrianople, ſuch is the character which, with a few excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he might have tranſmitted to poſterity. But the concluſion of his reign (according to the moderate and indeed tender ſentence of a writer of the ſame age) degraded him from the rank which he had acquired among the moſt deſerving of the Roman princes <note n="3" place="bottom">See Eutropius x. 6. In primo Imperii tempore optimis princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pibus, ultimo mediis comparandus. From the ancient Greek ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Poeanius (edit. Havercamp. p. 697.), I am inclined to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that Eutropius had originally written <hi>vix</hi> mediis; and that the offenſive monoſyllable was dropped by the wilful inadvertency of tranſcribers. Aurelius Victor expreſſes the general opinion by a vulgar and indeed obſcure proverb. <hi>Trachala</hi> decem annis praeſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſimus; duodecim ſequentibus <hi>latro;</hi> decem noviſſimis <hi>pupillus</hi> ob immodicas profuſiones.</note>. In the life of Auguſtus, we behold the tyrant of the republic, converted, almoſt by imperceptible degrees, into the father of his country and of human kind. In that of Conſtantine, we may contemplate a hero, who had ſo long inſpired his ſubjects with love, and his enemies with terror, degenerating into a cruel and diſſolute monarch, corrupted by his fortune, or raiſed by conqueſt above the neceſſity of diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation.

               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0034700103:110"/>
was a period of apparent ſplendor rather than of real proſperity; and the old age of Conſtantine was diſgraced by the oppoſite yet reconcileable vices of rapaciouſneſs and prodigality. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated treaſures found in the palaces of Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entius and Licinius, were laviſhly conſumed; the various innovations introduced by the conqueror, were attended with an encreaſing expence; the coſt of his buildings, his court, and his feſtivals, required an immediate and plentiful ſupply; and the oppreſſion of the people was the only fund which could ſupport the magnificence of the ſovereign <note n="4" place="bottom">Julian.

His unworthy favourites, enriched by the boundleſs liberality of their maſter, uſurp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with impunity the privilege of rapine and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption <note n="5" place="bottom">The impartial Ammianus deſerves all our confidence.

A ſecret but univerſal decay was felt in every part of the public adminiſtration, and the emperor himſelf, though he ſtill retained the obedience, gradually loſt the eſteem, of his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. The dreſs and manners, which, towards the decline of life, he choſe to affect, ſerved only to degrade him in the eyes of mankind. The Aſiatic pomp, which had been adopted by the pride of Diocletian, aſſumed an air of ſoftneſs and effeminacy in the perſon of Conſtantine. He

is repreſented with falſe hair of various colours, laboriouſly arranged by the ſkilful artiſts of the times; a diadem of a new and more expenſive faſhion; a profuſion of gems and pearls, of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and bracelets, and a variegated flowing robe of ſilk, moſt curiouſly embroidered with flowers of gold. In ſuch apparel, ſcarcely to be excuſed by the youth and folly of Elagabalus, we are at a loſs to diſcover the wiſdom of an aged monarch, and the ſimplicity of a Roman veteran <note n="6" place="bottom">Julian, in the Caeſars, attempts to ridicule his uncle. His ſuſpicious teſtimony is confirmed however by the learned Spanheim, with the authority of medals (See Commentaire, p. 156. 299. 397. 459.). Euſebius (Orat. c. 5.) alleges, that Conſtantine dreſſed for the public, not for himſelf. Were this admitted, the vaineſt cox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb could never want an excuſe.</note>. A mind thus relaxed by proſperity and indulgence, was incapable of riſing to that magnanimity which diſdains ſuſpicion, and dares to forgive. The deaths of Maximian and Licinius may perhaps be juſtified by the maxims of policy, as they are taught in the ſchools of tyrants; but an impartial narrative of the executions, or rather murders, which ſullied the declining age of Conſtantine, will ſuggeſt to our moſt candid thoughts, the idea of a prince, who could ſacrifice without reluctance the laws of juſtice, and the feelings of nature, to the dictates either of his paſſions or of his intereſt.</p>
            <p>The ſame fortune which ſo invariably followed <note place="margin">His family.</note> the ſtandard of Conſtantine, ſeemed to ſecure the hopes and comforts of his domeſtic life. Thoſe among his predeceſſors who had enjoyed the longeſt and moſt proſperous reigns, Auguſtus,

Trajan, and Diocletian, had been diſappointed of poſterity; and the frequent revolutions had never allowed ſufficient time for any Imperial family to grow up and multiply under the ſhade of the purple. But the royalty of the Flavian line, which had been firſt ennobled by the Gothic Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, deſcended through ſeveral generations; and Conſtantine himſelf derived from his royal father the hereditary honours which he tranſmitted to his children. The emperor had been twice married. Minervina, the obſcure but lawful object of his youthful attachment <note n="7" place="bottom">Zoſimus and Zonaras agree in repreſenting Minervina as the concubine of Conſtantine: but Ducange has very gallantly reſcued her character, by producing a deciſive paſſage from one of the pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyrics: "Ab ipſo fine pueritiae te matrimonii legibus dediſti."</note>, had left him only one ſon, who was called Criſpus. By Fauſta, the daughter of Maximian, he had three daughters, and three ſons known by the kindred names of Conſtantine, Conſtantius, and Conſtans. The unambitious brothers of the great Conſtantine, Julius Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Dalmatius, and Hannibalianus <note n="8" place="bottom">Ducange (Familiae Byzantinae, p. 44.) beſtows on him, after Zonaras, the name of Conſtantine; a name ſomewhat unlikely, as it was already occupied by the elder brother. That of Hannibalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus is mentioned in the Paſchal chronicle, and is approved by Tille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 527.</note>, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to enjoy the moſt honourable rank, and the moſt affluent fortune, that could be conſiſtent with a private ſtation. The youngeſt of the three lived without a name, and died without poſterity. His two elder brothers obtained in marriage the daughters of wealthy ſenators, and propagated new branches of the Imperial race. Gallus and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0034700103:113"/>
Julian afterwards became the moſt illuſtrious of the children of Julius Conſtantius, the <hi>Patrician.</hi> The two ſons of Dalmatius, who had been deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with the vain title of <hi>Cenſor,</hi> were named Dalmatius and Hannibalianus. The two ſiſters of the great Conſtantine, Anaſtaſia and Eurropia, were beſtowed on Optatus and Nepotianus, two ſenators of noble birth and of conſular dignity. His third ſiſter, Conſtantia, was diſtinguiſhed by her pre-eminence of greatneſs and of miſery. She remained the widow of the vanquiſhed Lici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius; and it was by her entreaties, that an inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent boy, the offspring of their marriage, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for ſome time, his life, the title of Caeſar, and a precarious hope of the ſucceſſion. Beſides the females, and the allies of the Flavian houſe, ten or twelve males, to whom the language of modern courts would apply the title of princes of the blood, ſeemed, according to the order of their birth, to be deſtined either to inherit or to ſupport the throne of Conſtantine. But in leſs than thirty years, this numerous and encreaſing family was reduced to the perſons of Conſtantius and Julian, who alone had ſurvived a ſeries of crimes and calamities, ſuch as the tragic poets have deplored in the devoted lines of Pelops and of Cadmus.</p>
            <p>Criſpus, the eldeſt ſon of Conſtantine, and the <note place="margin">Virtues of Criſpus.</note> preſumptive heir of the empire, is repreſented by impartial hiſtorians as an amiable and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed youth. The care of his education, or at leaſt of his ſtudies, was entruſted to Lactantius, the moſt eloquent of the Chriſtians; a praeceptor
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0034700103:114"/>
admirably qualified to form the taſte, and to excite the virtues, of his illuſtrious diſciple <note n="9" place="bottom">Jerom. in Chron. The poverty of Lactantius may be applied either to the praiſe of the diſintereſted philoſopher, or to the ſhame of the unfeeling patron. See Tillemont, Mem. Eccleſiaſt. tom. vi. part i. p. 345. Dupin, Bibliothéque Eccleſiaſt. tom. i. p. 205. Lardner's Credibility of the Goſpel Hiſtory, part ii. vol. vii. p. 66.</note>. At the age of ſeventeen, Criſpus was inveſted with the title of Caeſar, and the adminiſtration of the Gallic provinces, where the inroads of the Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans gave him an early occaſion of ſignalizing his military proweſs. In the civil war which broke out ſoon afterwards, the father and ſon di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided their powers; and this hiſtory has already celebrated the valour as well as conduct diſplayed by the latter, in forcing the ſtreights of the Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſpont, ſo obſtinately defended by the ſuperior fleet of Licinius. This naval victory contributed to determine the event of the war; and the names of Conſtantine and of Criſpus were united in the joyful acclamations of their eaſtern ſubjects: who loudly proclaimed, that the world had been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, and was now governed, by an emperor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed with every virtue; and by his illuſtrious ſon, a prince beloved of heaven, and the lively image of his father's perfections. The public fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, which ſeldom accompanies old-age, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed its luſtre over the youth of Criſpus. He deſerved the eſteem, and he engaged the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of the court, the army, and the people. The experienced merit of a reigning monarch is acknowledged by his ſubjects with reluctance, and frequently denied with partial and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented

murmurs; while, from the opening vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues of his ſucceſſor, they fondly conceive the moſt unbounded hopes of private as well as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic felicity <note n="10" place="bottom">Euſeb.

            <p>This dangerous popularity ſoon excited the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention <note place="margin">Jealouſy of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine.</note> of Conſtantine, who, both as a father and as a king, was impatient of an equal. Inſtead of <note place="margin">A.

Criſpus ſoon had reaſon to complain, that while his infant brother Conſtantius was ſent, with the title of Caeſar, to reign over his peculiar department of the Gallic provinces <note n="11" place="bottom">Compare Idatius and the Paſchal Chronicle, with Ammianus (l. xiv. c. 5.). The <hi>year</hi> in which Conſtantius was created Caeſar, ſeems to be more accurately fixed by the two chronologiſts; but the hiſtorian who lived in his court, could not be ignorant of the <hi>day</hi> of the anniverſary. For the appointment of the new Caeſar to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Gaul, ſee Julian, Orat. i. p. 12. Godefroy, Chronol, Legum, p. 26. and Blondel de la Primauté de l'Egliſe, p. 1183.</note>, <hi>he,</hi> a prince of mature years, who had performed ſuch recent and ſignal ſervices, inſtead of being raiſed to the ſuperior rank of Auguſtus, was confined almoſt a priſoner to his father's court; and expoſed, without power or defence, to every calumny which the malice of his enemies could ſuggeſt. Under ſuch painful circumſtances, the royal youth might not always be able to compoſe his behaviour, or ſuppreſs his diſcontent; and we may be aſſured, that he was
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0034700103:116"/>
encompaſſed by a train of indiſcreet or perfidious followers, who aſſiduouſly ſtudied to inflame, and who were perhaps inſtructed to betray, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guarded warmth of his reſentment. An edict of <note place="margin">A. D. 325, October 1.</note> Conſtantine, publiſhed about this time, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly indicates his real or affected ſuſpicions, that a ſecret conſpiracy had been formed againſt his perſon and government. By all the allurements of honours and rewards, he invites informers of every degree to accuſe without exception his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates or miniſters, his friends or his moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate favourites, proteſting, with a ſolemn aſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veration, that he himſelf will liſten to the charge, that he himſelf will revenge his injuries; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding with a prayer, which diſcovers ſome ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of danger, that the providence of the Supreme Being may ſtill continue to protect the ſafety of the emperor and of the empire <note n="12" place="bottom">Cod.

            <p>The informers, who complied with ſo liberal <note place="margin">Diſgrace and death of Criſpu's,</note> an invitation, were ſufficiently verſed in the arts of courts to ſelect the friends and adherents of <note place="margin">A.

The ſtory of theſe unhappy princes, the nature and evidence of their guilt, the forms of their trial, and the circumſtances of their death, were buried in myſterious obſcurity; and the courtly biſhop, who has celebrated in an elaborate work the virtues and piety of his hero, obſerves a prudent ſilence on the ſubject of theſe tragic events <note n="19" place="bottom">See the Life of Conſtantine, particularly l. ii. c. 19, 20.

the greateſt monarchs of the preſent age.

They pretend, that as ſoon as the afflicted father diſcovered the falſehood of the accuſation by which his credulity had been ſo fatally miſled, he publiſhed to the world his repentance and remorſe; that he mourned forty days, during which he ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained from the uſe of the bath, and all the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary comforts of life; and that, for the laſting inſtruction of poſterity, he erected a golden ſtatue of Criſpus, with this memorable inſcription: TO MY SON, WHOM I UNJUSTLY CONDEMNED <note n="21" place="bottom">In order to prove that the ſtatue was erected by Conſtantine, and afterwards concealed by the malice of the Arians, Codinus very readily creates (p. 34.) two witneſſes, Hippolitus, and the younger Herodotus, to whoſe imaginary hiſtories he appeals with unbluſhing confidence.</note>. A tale ſo moral and ſo intereſting would deſerve to be ſupported by leſs exceptionable authority: but if we conſult the more ancient and authentic writers, they will inform us, that the repentance of Conſtantine was manifeſted only in acts of blood and revenge; and that he atoned for the murder of an innocent ſon, by the execution,

perhaps, of a guilty wife. They aſcribe the misfortunes of Criſpus to the arts of his ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother Fauſta, whoſe implacable hatred, or whoſe diſappointed love, renewed in the palace of Conſtantine the ancient tragedy of Hippolitus and of Phaedra <note n="22" place="bottom">Zoſimus (l. ii. p. 103.) may be conſidered as our original.

thought, that the remembrance of a conjugal union of twenty years, and the honour of their common offspring, the deſtined heirs of the throne, might have ſoftened the obdurate heart of Conſtantine; and perſuaded him to ſuffer his wife, however guilty ſhe might appear, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piate her offences in a ſolitary priſon.

the motives of the emperor, when he endangered the ſafety both of his family and of his people, by the unneceſſary elevation of his two nephews, Dalmatius and Hannibalianus. The former was raiſed, by the title of Caeſar, to an equality with his couſins. In favour of the latter, Conſtantine invented the new and ſingular appellation of <hi>Nobiliſſimus</hi> 
               <note n="30" place="bottom">Zoſim. l. ii. p. 117.

The moſt celebrated profeſſors of the Chriſtian faith, of the Grecian philoſophy, and of the Roman juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudence, were invited by the liberality of the emperor, who reſerved for himſelf the important taſk of inſtructing the royal youths in the ſcience of government, and the knowledge of mankind. But the genius of Conſtantine himſelf had been formed by adverſity and experience. In the free intercourſe of private life, and amidſt the dangers of the court of Galerius, he had learned to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand his own paſſions, to encounter thoſe of his equals, and to depend for his preſent ſafety and future greatneſs on the prudence and firmneſs of his perſonal conduct. His deſtined ſucceſſors had the misfortune of being born and educated in the Imperial purple.

them to deſcend from that elevated ſtation from whence the various characters of human nature appear to wear a ſmooth and uniform aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect. The indulgence of Conſtantine admitted them, at a very tender age, to ſhare the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the empire; and they ſtudied the art of reigning at the expence of the people entruſted to their care. The younger Conſtantine was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to hold his court in Gaul; and his brother Conſtantius exchanged that department, the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient patrimony of their father, for the more opulent, but leſs martial, countries of the Eaſt. Italy, the Weſtern Illyricum, and Africa, were accuſtomed to revere Conſtans, the third of his ſons, as the repreſentative of the great Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine. He fixed Dalmatius on the Gothic frontier, to which he annexed the government of Thrace, Macedonia, and Greece. The city of Caeſarea was choſen for the reſidence of Hannibalianus; and the provinces of Pontus, Cappadocia, and the Leſſer Armenia, were deſigned to form the extent of his new kingdom. For each of theſe princes a ſuitable eſtabliſhment was provided. A juſt proportion of guards, of legions, and of auxiliaries, was allotted for their reſpective dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and defence. The miniſters and generals, who were placed about their perſons, were ſuch as Conſtantine could truſt to aſſiſt, and even to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol, theſe youthful ſovereigns in the exerciſe of their delegated power. As they advanced in years and experience, the limits of their autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity were inſenſibly enlarged: but the emperor always reſerved for himſelf the title of Auguſtus;
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0034700103:126"/>
and while he ſhewed the <hi>Caeſars</hi> to the armies and provinces, he maintained every part of the empire in equal obedience to its ſupreme head <note n="34" place="bottom">Euſebius (l. iv. c. 51, 52.), with a deſign of exalting the authority and glory of Conſtantine, affirms, that he divided the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man empire as a private citizen might have divided his patrimony. His diſtribution of the provinces may be collected from Eutropius, the two Victors, and the Valeſian fragment.</note>.

The moveable camps or cities, the ordinary reſidence of their wives and children, conſiſted only of large wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons drawn by oxen, and covered in the form of tents. The military ſtrength of the nation was compoſed of cavalry; and the cuſtom of their warriors, to lead in their hand one or two ſpare horſes, enabled them to advance and to retreat with a rapid diligence, which ſurpriſed the ſecurity, and eluded the purſuit, of a diſtant enemy <note n="37" place="bottom">Ammian. l. xvii. c. 12.

The allurements of plenty engaged them to ſeek a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent eſtabliſhment on the frontiers of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. Soon after the reign of Auguſtus, they obliged the Dacians, who ſubſiſted by fiſhing on the banks of the river Teyſs or Tibiſcus, to retire into the hilly country, and to abandon to the victorious Sarmatians the fertile plains of the Upper Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary, which are bounded by the courſe of the Danube and the ſemi-circular incloſure of the Carpathian mountains <note n="41" place="bottom">The Sarmatians Jazygae were ſettled on the banks of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiſſus or Tibiſcus, when Pliny, in the year 79, publiſhed his Natural Hiſtory.

After ſome experience of the ſuperior ſtrength and numbers of their adverſaries, the Sarmatians im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored the protection of the Roman monarch, who beheld with pleaſure the diſcord of the nations, but who was juſtly alarmed by the progreſs of the Gothic arms. As ſoon as Conſtantine had declared himſelf in favour of the weaker party, the haughty Araric, king of the Goths, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of expecting the attack of the Legions, boldly paſſed the Danube, and ſpread terror and devaſtation through the province of Maeſia. To oppoſe the inroad of this deſtroying hoſt, the aged emperor took the field in perſon; but on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion either his conduct or his fortune betrayed the glory which he had acquired in ſo many fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign

But on this occaſion his narrative is, for the moſt part, conſiſtent and probable; nor is there much difficulty in conceiving that an emperor might have acceſs to ſome ſecret archives, which had eſcaped the diligence of meaner hiſtorians. For the ſituation and hiſtory of Cherſone, ſee Peyſſonel des Peuples barbares qui ont habité les Bords du Danube, c. xvi. p. 84—90.</note>, whoſe capital ſituate on the weſtern coaſt of the Tauric or Crimaean peninſula, ſtill retained ſome veſtiges of a Grecian colony, and was governed by a perpetual magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, aſſiſted by a council of ſenators, emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally ſtyled the Fathers of the City. The Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonites
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0034700103:132"/>
were animated againſt the Goths, by the memory of the wars which, in the preceding cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, they had maintained with unequal forces againſt the invaders of their country. They were connected with the Romans by the mutual bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of commerce; as they were ſupplied from the provinces of Aſia with corn and manufactures, which they purchaſed with their only productions, ſalt, wax, and hides. Obedient to the requiſition of Conſtantine, they prepared, under the conduct of their magiſtrate Diogenes, a conſiderable army, of which the principal ſtrength conſiſted in croſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows and military chariots. The ſpeedy march and intrepid attack of the Cherſonites, by divert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the attention of the Goths, aſſiſted the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Imperial generals. The Goths, van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed on every ſide, were driven into the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, where, in the courſe of a ſevere campaign, above an hundred thouſand were computed to have periſhed by cold and hunger. Peace was at length granted to their humble ſupplications; the eldeſt ſon of Araric was accepted as the moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable hoſtage; and Conſtantine endeavoured to convince their chiefs, by a liberal diſtribution of honours and rewards, how far the friendſhip of the Romans was preferable to their enmity. In the expreſſions of his gratitude towards the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cherſonites, the emperor was ſtill more mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent. The pride of the nation was gratified by the ſplendid and almoſt royal decorations beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on their magiſtrate and his ſucceſſors. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual exemption from all duties was ſtipulated for their veſſels which traded to the ports of the Black Sea. A regular ſubſidy was promiſed, of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0034700103:133"/>
iron, corn, oil, and of every ſupply which could be uſeful either in peace or war. But it was thought that the Sarmatians were ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded by their deliverance from impending ruin; and the emperor, perhaps with too ſtrict an oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy, deducted ſome part of the expences of the war from the cuſtomary gratifications which were allowed to that turbulent nation.</p>

Their inroads on the territory of the empire pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the indignation of Conſtantine to leave them to their fate; and he no longer oppoſed the ambition of Geberic, a renowned warrior, who had recently aſcended the Gothic throne. Wiſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar, the Vandal king, whilſt alone and unaſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, he defended his dominions with undaunted courage, was vanquiſhed and ſlain in a deciſive battle which ſwept away the flower of the Sarma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian youth. The remainder of the nation em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced the deſperate expedient of arming their ſlaves, a hardy race of hunters and herdſmen, by whoſe tumultuary aid they revenged their defeat, and expelled the invader from their confines. But they ſoon diſcovered that they had exchanged a foreign for a domeſtic enemy, more dangerous and more implacable. Enraged by their former ſervitude, elated by their preſent glory, the ſlaves, under the name of Limigantes, claimed and uſurped the poſſeſſion of the country which they had ſaved. Their maſters, unable to withſtand the ungoverned fury of the populace, preferred
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0034700103:134"/>
the hardſhips of exile, to the tyranny of their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants. Some of the fugitive Sarmatians ſolicited a leſs ignominious dependence, under the hoſtile ſtandard of the Goths. A more numerous band retired beyond the Carpathian mountains, among the Quadi, their German allies, and were eaſily ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſhare a ſuperfluous waſte of uncultivated land. But the far greater part of the diſtreſſed nation turned their eyes towards the fruitful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of Rome.

The arts of fraud were made ſubſervient to the deſigns of cruelty; and a manifeſt forgery was atteſted by a perſon of the moſt ſacred character. From the hands of the biſhop of Nicomedia, Conſtantius received a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſcroll, affirmed to be the genuine teſtament of his father; in which the emperor expreſſed his ſuſpicions that he had been poiſoned by his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and conjured his ſons to revenge his death,

The firm alliance which he maintained with Conſtantine, was productive of ſpiritual as well as of temporal benefits: by the converſion of Tiridates, the character of a ſaint was applied to that of a hero, the Chriſtian faith was preached and eſtabliſhed from the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates to the ſhores of the Caſpian, and Armenia was attached to the empire by the double ties of policy and of religion. But as many of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menian nobles ſtill refuſed to abandon the plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of their gods and of their wives, the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic tranquillity was diſturbed by a diſcontented faction, which inſulted the feeble age of their ſovereign, and impatiently expected the hour of his death. He died at length after a reign of <note place="margin">A. D. 342.</note> fifty-ſix years, and the fortune of the Armenian monarchy expired with Tiridates. His lawful heir was driven into exile, the Chriſtian prieſts

were either murdered or expelled from their churches, the barbarous tribes of Albania were ſolicited to deſcend from their mountains; and two of the moſt powerful governors, uſurping the enſigns or the powers of royalty, implored the aſſiſtance of Sapor, and opened the gates of their cities to the Perſian garriſons. The Chriſtian party, under the guidance of the archbiſhop of Artaxata, the immediate ſucceſſor of St. Gregory the Illuminator, had recourſe to the piety of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius. After the troubles had continued about three years, Antiochus, one of the officers of the houſehold, executed with ſucceſs the Imperial commiſſion of reſtoring Choſroes, the ſon of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridates, to the throne of his fathers, of diſtribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing honours and rewards among the faithful ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of the houſe of Arſaces, and of proclaiming a general amneſty, which was accepted by the greater part of the rebellious Satraps. But the Romans derived more honour than advantage from this revolution. Choſroes was a prince of a puny ſtature, and a puſillanimous ſpirit. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal to the fatigues of war, averſe to the ſociety of mankind, he withdrew from his capital to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired palace, which he built on the banks of the river Eleutherus, and in the centre of a ſhady grove; where he conſumed his vacant hours in the rural ſports of hunting and hawking. To ſecure this inglorious eaſe, he ſubmitted to the conditions of peace which Sapor condeſcended to impoſe; the payment of an annual tribute, and the reſtitution of the fertile province of Atropatene, which the

the day was moſt commonly adverſe to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, but in the battle of Singara, their impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent valour had almoſt atchieved a ſignal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſive victory. The ſtationary troops of Singara retired on the approach of Sapor, who paſſed the Tigris over three bridges, and occupied near the village of Hilleh an advantageous camp, which, by the labour of his numerous pioneers, he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded in one day with a deep ditch, and a lofty rampart. His formidable hoſt, when it was drawn out in order of battle, covered the banks of the river, the adjacent heights, and the whole extent of a plain of above twelve miles, which ſeparated the two armies. Both were alike impatient to engage; but the Barbarians, after a ſlight reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, fled in diſorder; unable to reſiſt, or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to weary, the ſtrength of the heavy legions, who, fainting with heat and thirſt, purſued them acroſs the plain, and cut in pieces a line of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry, clothed in complete armour, which had been poſted before the gates of the camp to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect their retreat. Conſtantius, who was hurried along in the purſuit, attempted, without effect, to reſtrain the ardour of his troops, by repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them the dangers of the approaching night,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0034700103:148"/>
and the certainty of completing their ſucceſs with the return of day. As they depended much more on their own valour, than on the experience or the abilities of their chief, they ſilenced by their cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours his timid remonſtrances; and ruſhing with fury to the charge, filled up the ditch, broke down the rampart, and diſperſed themſelves through the tents, to recruit their exhauſted ſtrength, and to enjoy the rich harveſt of their labours. But the prudent Sapor had watched the moment of victory. His army, of which the greater part, ſecurely poſted on the heights, had been ſpectators of the action, advanced in ſilence, and under the ſhadow of the night; and his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian archers, guided by the illumination of the camp, poured a ſhower of arrows on a diſarmed and licentious crowd. The ſincerity of hiſtory <note n="61" place="bottom">Acerrimâ nocturnâ concertatione pugnatum eſt, noſtrorum copiis ingenti ſtrage confoſſis. Ammian. xviii. 5.

In the ſpace of twelve years, Niſibis, which, ſince the time of Lucullus, had been deſervedly eſteemed the bulwark of the eaſt, ſuſtained three memorable ſieges againſt the power <note place="margin">A.

The event of the two former ſieges elated their confidence; and exaſperated the haughty ſpirit of the Great King, who advanced a third time towards Niſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis, at the head of the united forces of Perſia and India. The ordinary machines, invented to bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or undermine the walls, were rendered inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual by the ſuperior ſkill of the Romans; and many days had vainly elapſed, when Sapor em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced a reſolution worthy of an eaſtern monarch, who believed that the elements themſelves were ſubject to his power. At the ſtated ſeaſon of the melting of the ſnows in Armenia, the river Myg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donius, which divides the plain and the city of Niſibis, forms, like the Nile <note n="66" place="bottom">Julian.

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0034700103:151"/>
over the adjacent country. By the labour of the Perſians, the courſe of the river was ſtopped be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the town, and the waters were confined on every ſide by ſolid mounds of earth. On this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial lake, a fleet of armed veſſels, filled with ſoldiers, and with engines which diſcharged ſtones of five hundred pounds weight, advanced in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of battle, and engaged, almoſt upon a level, the troops which defended the ramparts. The irreſiſtible force of the waters was alternately fatal to the contending parties, till at length a portion of the walls, unable to ſuſtain the accumulated preſſure, gave way at once, and expoſed an ample breach of one hundred and fifty feet. The Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians were inſtantly driven to the aſſault, and the fate of Niſibis depended on the event of the day. The heavy-armed cavalry, who led the van of a deep column, were embarraſſed in the mud, and great numbers were drowned in the unſeen holes which had been filled by the ruſhing waters. The elephants, made furious by their wounds, encreaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the diſorder, and trampled down thouſands of the Perſian archers. The Great King, who from an exalted throne beheld the misfortunes of his arms, ſounded, with reluctant indignation, the ſignal of the retreat, and ſuſpended for ſome hours the proſecution of the attack. But the vigilant citizens improved the opportunity of the night; and the return of day diſcovered a new wall of ſix feet in height, riſing every moment to fill up the interval of the breach. Notwithſtanding the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment of his hopes, and the loſs of more than twenty thouſand men, Sapor ſtill preſſed the

Alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this intelligence, he haſtily relinquiſhed the ſiege, and marched with rapid diligence from the banks of the Tigris to thoſe of the Oxus. The danger and difficulties of the Scythian war en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged him ſoon afterwards to conclude, or at leaſt to obſerve, a truce with the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, which was equally grateful to both princes; as Conſtantius himſelf, after the deaths of his two brothers, was involved, by the revolutions of the weſt, in a civil conteſt, which required and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exceed the moſt vigorous exertion of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided ſtrength.</p>
            <p>After the partition of the empire, three years <note place="margin">Civil war, and death of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</note> had ſcarcely elapſed, before the ſons of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine ſeemed impatient to convince mankind that they were incapable of contenting themſelves <note place="margin">A.

The eldeſt of thoſe princes ſoon complained, that he was defrauded of his juſt proportion of the ſpoils of their murdered kinſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and though he might yield to the ſuperior guilt and merit of Conſtantius, he exacted from Conſtans the ceſſion of the African provinces, as an equivalent for the rich countries of Macedo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia and Greece, which his brother had acquired
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0034700103:153"/>
by the death of Dalmatius. The want of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, which Conſtantine experienced in a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and fruitleſs negociation, exaſperated the fierceneſs of his temper; and he eagerly liſtened to thoſe favourites, who ſuggeſted to him that his honour, as well as his intereſt, was concerned in the proſecution of the quarrel. At the head of a tumultuary band, ſuited for rapine rather than for conqueſt, he ſuddenly broke into the domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Conſtans, by the way of the Julian Alps, and the country round Aquileia felt the firſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of his reſentment. The meaſures of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtans, who then reſided in Dacia, were directed with more prudence and ability. On the news of his brother's invaſion, he detached a ſelect and diſciplined body of his Illyrian troops, propoſing to follow them in perſon with the remainder of his forces. But the conduct of his lieutenants ſoon terminated the unnatural conteſt. By the artful appearances of flight, Conſtantine was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into an ambuſcade, which had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in a wood, where the raſh youth, with a few attendants, was ſurpriſed, ſurrounded, and ſlain.

The pride aſſumed by Conſtans, from the unmerited ſucceſs of his arms, was rendered more contemptible by his want of abilities and application.

His behaviour may remind us of the patriot earl of Leiceſter, the famous Simon de Montfort, who could perſuade the good people of England, that he, a Frenchman by birth, had taken arms to deliver them from foreign favourites.</note>. The choſen bands of Jovians and Herculians, who acknowledged Magnentius as their leader, maintained the moſt reſpectable and important
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:0034700103:155"/>
ſtation in the Imperial camp. The friendſhip of Marcellinus, count of the ſacred largeſſes, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with a liberal hand the means of ſeduction. The ſoldiers were convinced by the moſt ſpecious arguments, that the republic ſummoned them to break the bonds of hereditary ſervitude; and, by the choice of an active and vigilant prince, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the ſame virtues which had raiſed the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors of the degenerate Conſtans from a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate condition to the throne of the world. As ſoon as the conſpiracy was ripe for execution, Marcellinus, under the pretence of celebrating his ſon's birth-day, gave a ſplendid entertainment to the <hi>illuſtrious</hi> and <hi>honourable</hi> perſons of the court of Gaul, which then reſided in the city of Autun. The intemperance of the feaſt was artfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted till a very late hour of the night; and the unſuſpecting gueſts were tempted to indulge themſelves in a dangerous and guilty freedom of converſation. On a ſudden the doors were thrown open, and Magnentius, who had retired for a few moments, returned into the apartment, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the diadem and purple. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpirators inſtantly ſaluted him with the titles of Auguſtus and Emperor. The ſurpriſe, the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, the intoxication, the ambitious hopes, and the mutual ignorance of the reſt of the aſſembly, prompted them to join their voices to the general acclamation. The guards haſtened to take the oath of fidelity; the gates of the town were ſhut; and before the dawn of day, Magnentius became maſter of the troops and treaſure of the palace and city of Autun. By his ſecrecy and diligence he
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0034700103:156"/>
entertained ſome hopes of ſurpriſing the perſon of Conſtans, who was purſuing in the adjacent fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt his favourite amuſement of hunting, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome pleaſures of a more private and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal nature. The rapid progreſs of fame al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, however, an inſtant for flight, though the deſertion of his ſoldiers and ſubjects deprived him of the power of reſiſtance.

The martial countries

Attached by habit, by duty, and by gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, to the houſe of Conſtantine, he imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately gave the ſtrongeſt aſſurances to the only ſurviving ſon of his late maſter, that he would expoſe, with unſhaken fidelity, his perſon and his troops, to inflict a juſt revenge on the traitors of Gaul. But the legions of Vetranio were ſeduced, rather than provoked, by the example of rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion; their leader ſoon betrayed a want of firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or a want of ſincerity; and his ambition de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived a ſpecious pretence from the approbation of the princeſs Conſtantina.

He recommended the care of the eaſt to his lieutenants, and afterwards to his couſin Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, whom he raiſed from a priſon to a throne; and marched towards Europe, with a mind agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated by the conflict of hope and fear, of grief and indignation. On his arrival at Heraclea in Thrace, the emperor gave audience to the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Magnentius and Vetranio. The firſt author of the conſpiracy, Marcellinus, who in ſome meaſure had beſtowed the purple on his new maſter, boldly accepted this dangerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; and his three colleagues were ſelected from the illuſtrious perſonages of the ſtate and army. Theſe deputies were inſtructed to ſoothe the reſentment, and to alarm the fears, of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius. They were empowered to offer him the friendſhip and alliance of the weſtern princes, to cement their union by a double marriage; of Conſtantius with the daughter of Magnentius, and of Magnentius himſelf with the ambitious Conſtantina; and to acknowledge in the treaty the pre-eminence of rank, which might juſtly be claimed by the emperor of the eaſt. Should pride and miſtaken piety urge him to refuſe theſe equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table

conditions, the ambaſſadors were ordered to expatiate on the inevitable ruin which muſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend his raſhneſs, if he ventured to provoke the ſovereigns of the weſt to exert their ſuperior ſtrength; and to employ againſt him that valour, thoſe abilities, and thoſe legions, to which the houſe of Conſtantine had been indebted for ſo many triumphs. Such propoſitions and ſuch ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments appeared to deſerve the moſt ſerious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; the anſwer of Conſtantius was deferred till the next day; and as he had reflected on the importance of juſtifying a civil war in the opinion of the people, he thus addreſſed his council, who liſtened with real or affected credulity: <q>Laſt night, ſaid he, after I retired to reſt, the ſhade of the great Conſtantine, embracing the corpſe of my murdered brother, roſe before my eyes; his well-known voice awakened me to revenge, forbade me to deſpair of the republic, and aſſured me of the ſucceſs and immortal glory which would crown the juſtice of my arms.</q> The authority of ſuch a viſion, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the prince who alleged it, ſilenced every doubt, and excluded all negociation. The igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious terms of peace were rejected with diſdain. One of the ambaſſadors of the tyrant was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed with the haughty anſwer of Conſtantius; his colleagues, as unworthy of the privileges of the law of nations, were put in irons; and the contending powers prepared to wage an impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable war <note n="75" place="bottom">See Peter the Patrician, in the Excerpta Legationum, p. 27.</note>.</p>

Such was the conduct, and ſuch perhaps was the duty, of the brother of Conſtans towards the perfidious uſurper of Gaul.

It was an eaſy taſk to deceive the frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſimplicity of Vetranio, who, fluctuating ſome time between the oppoſite views of honour and intereſt, diſplayed to the world the inſincerity of his temper, and was inſenſibly engaged in the ſnares of an artful negociation. Conſtantius ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged him as a legitimate and equal col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>league in the empire, on condition that he would renounce his diſgraceful alliance with Magnen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, and appoint a place of interview on the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers of their reſpective provinces; where they might pledge their friendſhip by mutual vows of fidelity, and regulate by common conſent the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture operations of the civil war. In conſequence of this agreement, Vetranio advanced to the city of Sardica <note n="76" place="bottom">Zonaras, tom. ii. l. xiii. p. 16.

In the centre, according to the rules of ancient diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, a military tribunal, or rather ſcaffold, was erected, from whence the emperors were accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed, on ſolemn and important occaſions, to harangue the troops. The well-ordered ranks of Romans and Barbarians, with drawn ſwords, or with erected ſpears, the ſquadrons of cavalry, and the cohorts of infantry, diſtinguiſhed by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of their arms and enſigns, formed an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe circle round the tribunal; and the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſilence which they preſerved was ſometimes interrupted by loud burſts of clamour or of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. In the preſence of this formidable aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the two emperors were called upon to explain the ſituation of public affairs: the precedency of rank was yielded to the royal birth of Conſtantius; and though he was indifferently ſkilled in the arts of rhetoric, he acquitted himſelf, under theſe difficult circumſtances, with firmneſs, dexterity, and eloquence. The firſt part of his oration ſeemed to be pointed only againſt the tyrant of Gaul; but while he tragically lamented the cruel murder of Conſtans, he inſinuated, that none, except a brother, could claim a right to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0034700103:162"/>
of his brother. He diſplayed, with ſome complacency, the glories of his Imperial race; and recalled to the memory of the troops, the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, the triumphs, the liberality of the great Conſtantine, to whoſe ſons they had engaged their allegiance by an oath of fidelity, which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude of his moſt favoured ſervants had tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to violate. The officers, who ſurrounded the tribunal, and were inſtructed to act their parts in this extraordinary ſcene, confeſſed the irreſiſtible power of reaſon and eloquence, by ſaluting the emperor Conſtantius as their lawful ſovereign. The contagion of loyalty and repentance was communicated from rank to rank; till the plain of Sardica reſounded with the univerſal acclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <q>Away with theſe upſtart uſurpers! Long life and victory to the ſon of Conſtantine! Under his banners alone we will fight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer.</q> The ſhout of thouſands, their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacing geſtures, the fierce claſhing of their arms, aſtoniſhed and ſubdued the courage of Vetranio, who ſtood, amidſt the defection of his followers, in anxious and ſilent ſuſpence. Inſtead of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the laſt refuge of generous deſpair, he tamely ſubmitted to his fate; and taking the diadem from his head, in the view of both armies, fell proſtrate at the feet of his conqueror.

He often expreſſed his grateful ſenſe of the goodneſs of Conſtantius, and, with a very amiable ſimplicity, adviſed his benefactor to reſign the ſceptre of the world, and to ſeek for content (where alone it could be found) in the peaceful obſcurity of a private condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="78" place="bottom">The younger Victor aſſigns to his exile the emphatical appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of "Voluptarium otium."

Conſtantius had declared his intention of deciding the quarrel in the fields of Cibalis, a name that would animate his troops by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the victory which, on the ſame auſpicious ground, had been obtained by the arms of his father Conſtantine. Yet, by the impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable fortifications with which the emperor en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſſed his camp, he appeared to decline, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than to invite, a general engagement. It was the object of Magnentius to tempt or to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel his adverſary to relinquiſh this advantageous poſition; and he employed, with that view, the various marches, evolutions, and ſtratagems, which the knowledge of the art of war could ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to an experienced officer. He carried by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault the important town of Siſcia; made an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack on the city of Sirmium, which lay in the rear of the Imperial camp; attempted to force a paſſage over the Save into the eaſtern provinces of

During the greater part of the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, the tyrant of Gaul ſhewed himſelf maſter of the field. The troops of Conſtantius were ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſed and diſpirited; his reputation declined in the eye of the world; and his pride condeſcended to ſolicit a treaty of peace, which would have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to the aſſaſſin of Conſtans the ſovereignty of the provinces beyond the Alps. Theſe offers were enforced by the eloquence of Philip, the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial ambaſſador; and the council as well as the army of Magnentius were diſpoſed to accept them. But the haughty uſurper, careleſs of the remonſtrances of his friends, gave orders that Philip ſhould be detained as a captive, or at leaſt as a hoſtage; while he diſpatched an officer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach Conſtantius with the weakneſs of his reign, and to inſult him by the promiſe of a pardon, if he would inſtantly abdicate the purple. <q>That he ſhould confide in the juſtice of his cauſe, and the protection of an avenging Deity,</q> was the only anſwer which honour permitted the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror to return.

The field of battle round Murſa was a naked and level plain: on this ground the army of Conſtantius formed, with the Drave on their right; while their left, either from the nature of their diſpoſition, or from the ſuperiority of their cavalry, extended far beyond the right ſlank of Magnentius <note n="83" place="bottom">This poſition, and the ſubſequent evolutions, are clearly, though conciſely, deſcribed by Julian, Orat. i. p. 36.</note>.

The ſilence of flattery is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times equal to the moſt poſitive and authentic evidence.</note>. They deſerved his confidence by the valour and military ſkill which they exerted. They wiſely began the action upon the left; and advancing their whole wing of cavalry in an oblique line, they ſuddenly wheeled it on the right flank of the enemy, which was unprepared to reſiſt the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuoſity of their charge.

            <p>THE divided provinces of the empire were again united by the victory of Conſtantius; but as that feeble prince was deſtitute of perſonal <note place="margin">Power of the eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuchs.</note> merit, either in peace or war; as he feared his generals, and diſtruſted his miniſters; the triumph of his arms ſerved only to eſtabliſh the reign of the <hi>eunuchs</hi> over the Roman world.

Different cities of Ionia and Bithynia were aſſigned for the places of their exile and education; but, as ſoon as their growing years excited the jealouſy of the emperor, he judged it more prudent to ſecure thoſe unhappy youths in the ſtrong caſtle of Macellum, near Caeſarea.

Their priſon was an ancient palace, the reſidence of the kings of Cappadocia; the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was pleaſant, the buildings ſtately, the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſpacious. They purſued their ſtudies, and practiſed their exerciſes, under the tuition of the moſt ſkilful maſters; and the numerous houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold appointed to attend, or rather to guard, the the nephews of Conſtantine, was not unworthy of the dignity of their birth. But they could not diſguiſe to themſelves that they were deprived of fortune, of freedom, and of ſafety; ſecluded from the ſociety of all whom they could truſt or eſteem, and condemned to paſs their melancholy hours in the company of ſlaves, devoted to the commands of a tyrant, who had already injured them beyond the hope of reconciliation. At length, however, the emergencies of the ſtate compelled the emperor, or rather his eunuchs, to inveſt Gallus, in the twenty-fifth year of his age, with the title of Caeſar, and to cement this poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical <note place="margin">Gallus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared Caeſar,</note> connection by his marriage with the princeſs Conſtantina. After a formal interview, in which <note place="margin">A.

Conſtantius continued his march towards the Weſt, and Gallus fixed his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence

He ſupported that character with generous firmneſs; but M. de Tillemont (Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 1120.) thinks it very improbable that an heretic ſhould have poſſeſſed ſuch virtue.</note>. In this fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate change, the new Caeſar was not unmindful of his brother Julian, who obtained the honours of his rank, the appearances of liberty, and the reſtitution of an ample patrimony <note n="14" place="bottom">Julian was at firſt permitted to purſue his ſtudies at Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople, but the reputation which he acquired ſoon excited the jealouſy of Conſtantius; and the young prince was adviſed to withdraw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the leſs conſpicuous ſeenes of Bithynia and Ionia.</note>.</p>

Every apartment of the palace was adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the inſtruments of death and torture, and a general conſternation was diffuſed through the capital of Syria. The Prince of the Eaſt, as if he

had been conſcious how much he had to fear, and how little he deſerved to reign, ſelected for the objects of his reſentment, the provincials accuſed of ſome imaginary treaſon, and his own courtiers, whom with more reaſon he ſuſpected of incenſing, by their ſecret correſpondence, the timid and ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious mind of Conſtantius. But he forgot that he was depriving himſelf of his only ſupport, the affection of the people; whilſt he furniſhed the malice of his enemies with the arms of truth, and afforded the emperor the faireſt pretence of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting the forfeit of his purple, and of his life <note n="18" place="bottom">See in Ammianus (l. xiv. c. 1. 7.) a very ample detail of the cruelties of Gallus.

The aſſaſſins had ſeduced a great number of legionaries; but their deſigns were diſcovered and revealed by an old woman in whoſe cottage they lodged.</note>. But when the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory was decided in favour of Conſtantius, his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent colleague became leſs uſeful and leſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable. Every circumſtance of his conduct was ſeverely and ſuſpiciouſly examined, and it was pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately reſolved, either to deprive Gallus of the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0034700103:183"/>
purple, or at leaſt to remove him from the indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent luxury of Aſia to the hardſhips and dangers of a German war. The death of Theophilus, conſular of the province of Syria, who in a time of ſcarcity had been maſſacred by the people of Antioch, with the connivance, and almoſt at the inſtigation, of Gallus, was juſtly reſented, not only as an act of wanton cruelty, but as a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous inſult on the ſupreme majeſty of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius. Two miniſters of illuſtrious rank, Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, the Oriental praefect, and Montius, quaeſtor of the palace, were empowered by a ſpecial com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to viſit and reform the ſtate of the Eaſt. They were inſtructed to behave towards Gallus with moderation and reſpect, and, by the gentleſt arts of perſuaſion, to engage him to comply with the invitation of his brother and colleague. The raſhneſs of the praefect diſappointed theſe prudent meaſures, and haſtened his own ruin, as well as that of his enemy. On his arrival at Antioch, Domitian paſſed diſdainfully before the gates of the palace, and alleging a ſlight pretence of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, continued ſeveral days in ſullen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement, to prepare an inflammatory memorial, which he tranſmitted to the Imperial court. Yielding at length to the preſſing ſolicitations of Gallus, the praefect condeſcended to take his ſeat in council; but his firſt ſtep was to ſignify a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and haughty mandate, importing that the Caeſar ſhould immediately repair to Italy, and threatening that he himſelf would puniſh his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay or heſitation, by ſuſpending the uſual allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his houſehold. The nephew and daughter
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0034700103:184"/>

The quaeſtor reproached Gallus in haughty language, that a prince, who was ſcarcely au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to remove a municipal magiſtrate, ſhould preſume to impriſon a Praetorian praefect; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked a meeting of the civil and military officers; and required them, in the name of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, to defend the perſon and dignity of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives. By this raſh declaration of war, the impatient temper of Gallus was provoked to embrace the moſt deſperate counſels. He order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his guards to ſtand to their arms, aſſembled the populace of Antioch, and recommended to their zeal the care of his ſafety and revenge. His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were too fatally obeyed. They rudely ſeized the praefect and the quaeſtor, and tying their legs together with ropes, they dragged them through the ſtreets of the city, inflicted a thouſand inſults and a thouſand wounds on theſe unhappy victims, and at laſt precipitated their

            <p>After ſuch a deed, whatever might have been <note place="margin">Dangerous ſituation of Gallus.</note> the deſigns of Gallus, it was only in a field of battle that he could aſſert his innocence with any hope of ſucceſs. But the mind of that prince was formed of an equal mixture of violence and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Inſtead of aſſuming the title of Auguſtus, inſtead of employing in his defence the troops and treaſures of the Eaſt, he ſuffered himſelf to be deceived by the affected tranquillity of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius, who, leaving him the vain pageantry of a court, imperceptibly recalled the veteran le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions from the provinces of Aſia. But as it ſtill appeared dangerous to arreſt Gallus in his capital, the ſlow and ſafer arts of diſſimulation were prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed with ſucceſs. The frequent and preſſing epiſtles of Conſtantius were filled with profeſſions of confidence and friendſhip; exhorting the Caeſar to diſcharge the duties of his high ſtation, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his colleague from a part of the public cares, and to aſſiſt the Weſt by his preſence, his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and his arms. After ſo many reciprocal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries, Gallus had reaſon to fear and to diſtruſt. But he had neglected the opportunities of flight and of reſiſtance; he was ſeduced by the flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſurances of the tribune Scudilo, who, under the ſemblance of a rough ſoldier, diſguiſed the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0034700103:186"/>
moſt artful inſinuation; and he depended on the credit of his wife Conſtantina, till the unſeaſonable death of that princeſs completed the ruin in which he had been involved by her impetuous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions <note n="22" place="bottom">She had preceded her huſband; but died of a fever on the road, at a little place in Bithynia, called Coenum Gallicanum.</note>.</p>

The progreſs of the journey might, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, have warned him of the impending danger.

After Gallus had been permitted to repoſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a few days at Hadrianople, he received a mandate, expreſſed in the moſt haughty and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute ſtyle, that his ſplendid retinue ſhould halt in that city, while the Caeſar himſelf, with only ten poſt-carriages, ſhould haſten to the Imperial reſidence at Milan. In this rapid journey, the profound reſpect which was due to the brother and colleague of Conſtantius, was inſenſibly changed into rude familiarity; and Gallus, who diſcovered in the countenances of the attendants that they already conſidered themſelves as his guards, and might ſoon be employed as his exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutioners, began to accuſe his fatal raſhneſs, and to recollect with terror and remorſe the conduct by which he had provoked his fate. The diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation which had hitherto been preſerved, was laid aſide at Petovio in Pannonia. He was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to a palace in the ſuburbs, where the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Barbatio, with a ſelect band of ſoldiers, who could neither be moved by pity, nor corrupted by rewards, expected the arrival of his illuſtrious victim. In the cloſe of the evening he was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted, ignominiouſly ſtripped of the enſigns of Caeſar, and hurried away to Pola in Iſtria, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered priſon, which had been ſo recently pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted with royal blood. The horror which he felt, was ſoon increaſed by the appearance of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable enemy the eunuch Euſebius, who, with the aſſiſtance of a notary and a tribune, proceeded to interrogate him concerning the adminiſtration of the Eaſt. The Caeſar ſunk under the weight of ſhame and guilt, confeſſed all the criminal
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0034700103:188"/>
actions, and all the treaſonable deſigns with which he was charged; and by imputing them to the advice of his wife, exaſperated the indignation of Conſtantius, who reviewed with partial prejudice the minutes of the examination. The emperor was eaſily convinced, that his own ſafety was incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible with the life of his couſin: the ſentence of death was ſigned, diſpatched, and executed; and the nephew of Conſtantine, with his hands tied behind his back, was beheaded in priſon like the vileſt malefactor <note n="24" place="bottom">See the complete narrative of the journey and death of Gallus in Ammianus, l. xiv. c. 11.

Thoſe who are inclined to palliate the cruelties of Conſtantius, aſſert that he ſoon relented, and endeavoured to recal the bloody mandate; but that the ſecond meſſenger entruſted with the reprieve, was detained by the eunuchs, who dreaded the unforgiving temper of Gallus, and were deſirous of re-uniting to <hi>their</hi> empire the wealthy provinces of the Eaſt <note n="25" place="bottom">Philoſtorgius, l. iv. c. 1.

the court of Milan; where he languiſhed above ſeven months, in the continual apprehenſion of ſuffering the ſame ignominious death, which was daily inflicted, almoſt before his eyes, on the friends and adherents of his perſecuted family. His looks, his geſtures, his ſilence, were ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinized with malignant curioſity, and he was perpetually aſſaulted by enemies, whom he had never offended, and by arts to which he was a ſtranger <note n="26" place="bottom">See Ammianus Marcellin. l. xv. c. 1. 3. 8. Julian himſelf, in his epiſtle to the Athenians, draws a very lively and juſt picture of his own danger, and of his ſentiments. He ſhews, however, a tendency to exaggerate his ſufferings, by inſinuating, though in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure terms, that they laſted above a year; a period which cannot be reconciled with the truth of chronology.</note>. But in the ſchool of adverſity, Julian inſenſibly acquired the virtues of firmneſs and diſcretion.

But the effects of a ſecond in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview were dreaded by the eunuchs; and Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian was adviſed to withdraw for a while into the neighbourhood of Milan, till the emperor thought <note place="margin">He is ſent to Athens,</note> proper to aſſign the city of Athens for the place <note place="margin">A.

As he had diſcovered, from his earlieſt youth, a propenſity, or rather paſſion, for the language, the manners, the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and the religion of the Greeks, he obeyed with pleaſure an order ſo agreeable to his wiſhes. Far from the tumult of arms, and the treachery of courts, he ſpent ſix months amidſt the groves of the academy, in a free intercourſe with the philoſophers of the age, who ſtudied to cultivate the genius, to encourage the vanity, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame the devotion of their royal pupil. Their

labours were not unſucceſsful; and Julian in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably preſerved for Athens that tender regard, which ſeldom fails to ariſe in a liberal mind, from the recollection of the place where it has diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and exerciſed its growing powers. The gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affability of manners, which his temper ſuggeſted and his ſituation impoſed, inſenſibly engaged the affections of the ſtrangers, as well as citizens, with whom he converſed. Some of his fellow-ſtudents might perhaps examine his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour with an eye of prejudice and averſion; but Julian eſtabliſhed, in the ſchools of Athens, a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral prepoſſeſſion in favour of his virtues and talents, which was ſoon diffuſed over the Roman world <note n="29" place="bottom">Libanius and Gregory Nazianzen have exhauſted the arts as well as the powers of their eloquence, to repreſent Julian as the firſt of heroes, or the worſt of tyrants.

The im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity of rapine had increaſed the boldneſs and numbers of the wild Iſaurians: thoſe robbers de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended from their craggy mountains to ravage the adjacent country, and had even preſumed, though without ſucceſs, to beſiege the important city of Seleucia, which was defended by a garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of three Roman legions. Above all, the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian monarch, elated by victory, again threatened the peace of Aſia, and the preſence of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror was indiſpenſably required, both in the Weſt, and in the Eaſt. For the firſt time, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius ſincerely acknowledged, that his ſingle ſtrength was unequal to ſuch an extent of care and of dominion <note n="30" place="bottom">Succumbere tot neceſſitatibus tamque crebris unum ſe quod nunquam fecerat apertè demonſtrans.

            <p>The emperors of the age of Conſtantine no longer deigned to conſult with the ſenate in the choice of a colleague; but they were anxious that their nomination ſhould be ratified by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the army.

As ſoon as the ceremony of his inveſtiture had been performed, Conſtantius addreſſed him with the tone of authority, which his ſuperior age and ſtation permitted him to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume; and exhorting the new Caeſar to deſerve, by heroic deeds, that ſacred and immortal name, the emperor gave his colleague the ſtrongeſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances of a friendſhip which ſhould never be impaired by time, nor interrupted by their ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration into the moſt diſtant climates.

By the induſtry and courage of his friends, the fraud was however detected, and in a great council of the
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0034700103:198"/>
civil and military officers, held in the preſence of the emperor himſelf, the innocence of Sylvanus was publicly acknowledged. But the diſcovery came too late; the report of the calumny, and the haſty ſeizure of his eſtate, had already provoked the indignant chief to the rebellion of which he was ſo unjuſtly accuſed. He aſſumed the purple at his head-quarters of Cologne, and his active powers appeared to menace Italy with an invaſion, and Milan with a ſiege. In this emergency, Ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicinus, a general of equal rank, regained, by an act of treachery, the favour which he had loſt by his eminent ſervices in the Eaſt. Exaſperated, as he might ſpeciouſly allege, by injuries of a ſimilar nature, he haſtened with a few followers to join the ſtandard, and to betray the confidence, of his too credulous friend. After a reign of only twenty-eight days, Sylvanus was aſſaſſinated: the ſoldiers who, without any criminal intention, had blindly followed the example of their leader, immediately returned to their allegiance; and the flatterers of Conſtantius celebrated the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and felicity of the monarch who had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed a civil war without the hazard of a battle <note n="40" place="bottom">Ammianus (xv. 5.) was perfectly well informed of the conduct and fate of Sylvanus.

He proceeded from Milan to Rome along the Aemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian and Flaminian ways; and as ſoon as he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached within forty miles of the city, the march of a prince who had never vanquiſhed a foreign enemy, aſſumed the appearance of a triumphal proceſſion. His ſplendid train was compoſed of all the miniſters of luxury; but in a time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found peace, he was encompaſſed by the glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing arms of the numerous ſquadrons of his guards and cuiraſſiers. Their ſtreaming banners of ſilk, emboſſed with gold, and ſhaped in the form of dragons, waved round the perſon of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror.

The ſevere diſcipline of the Perſian youth had been introduced by the eunuchs into the Imperial palace; and ſuch were the habits of patience which they had inculcated, that, during a ſlow and ſultry march, he was never ſeen to move his hand towards his face, or to turn his eyes either to the right or to the left. He was received by the magiſtrates and ſenate of Rome; and the emperor ſurveyed, with attention, the civil honours of the republic, and the conſular images of the noble families. The ſtreets were lined
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0034700103:200"/>
with an innumerable multitude. Their repeated acclamations expreſſed their joy at beholding, after an abſence of thirty-two years, the ſacred perſon of their ſovereign; and Conſtantius him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf expreſſed, with ſome pleaſantry, his affected ſurpriſe that the human race ſhould thus ſuddenly be collected on the ſame ſpot. The ſon of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine was lodged in the ancient palace of Auguſtus: he preſided in the ſenate, harangued the people from the tribunal which Cicero had ſo often aſcended, aſſiſted with unuſual courteſy at the games of the Circus, and accepted the crowns of gold, as well as the panegyrics which had been prepared for this ceremony by the deputies of the principal cities. His ſhort viſit of thirty days was employed in viewing the monuments of art and power, which were ſcattered over the ſeven hills and the interjacent vallies. He admired the awful majeſty of the capitol, the vaſt extent of the baths of Caracalla and Diocletian, the ſevere ſimplicity of the Pantheon, the maſſy greatneſs of the amphitheatre of Titus, the elegant archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecture of the theatre of Pompey and the Temple of Peace, and, above all, the ſtately ſtructure of the Forum and column of Trajan; acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the voice of fame, ſo prone to invent and to magnify, had made an inadequate report of the metropolis of the world.

The ſatisfaction which Conſtantius had received from this journey excited him to the generous emulation of beſtowing on the Romans ſome me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial <note place="margin">A new obeliſk.</note> of his own gratitude and munificence. His firſt idea was to imitate the equeſtrian and coloſſal ſtatue which he had ſeen in the Forum of Trajan; but when he had maturely weighed the difficulties of the execution <note n="42" place="bottom">Hormiſdas, a fugitive prince of Perſia, obſerved to the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, that if he made ſuch a horſe, he muſt think of preparing a ſimilar ſtable (the Forum of Trajan).

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0034700103:202"/>
which, from its ſize or ſanctity, eſcaped for a long time the rapacious vanity of the conquerors. It was deſigned by Conſtantine to adorn his new city <note n="45" place="bottom">Ammian.

the Barbarians; and particularly to the inroads of the Quadi, a fierce and powerful nation, who ſeem to have exchanged the inſtitutions of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many for the arms and military arts of their Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matian allies <note n="47" place="bottom">The events of this Quadian and Sarmatian war are related by Ammianus, xvi. 10. xvii. 12, 13. xix. 11.</note>. The garriſons of the frontier were inſufficient to check their progreſs; and the indolent monarch was at length compelled to aſſemble, from the extremities of his dominions, the flower of the Palatine troops, to take the field in perſon, and to employ a whole campaign, with the preceding autumn and the enſuing ſpring, in the ſerious proſecution of the war. The emperor paſſed the Danube on a bridge of boats, cut in pieces all that encountered his march, penetrated into the heart of the country of the Quadi, and ſeverely retaliated the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which they had inflicted on the Roman pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. The diſmayed Barbarians were ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſue for peace: they offered the reſtitution of his captive ſubjects, as an atonement for the paſt, and the nobleſt hoſtages as a pledge of their future conduct. The generous courteſy which was ſhewn to the firſt among their chieftains who implored the clemency of Conſtantius, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged the more timid, or the more obſtinate, to imitate their example; and the Imperial camp was crowded with the princes and ambaſſadors of the moſt diſtant tribes, who occupied the plains of the Leſſer Poland, and who might have deemed themſelves ſecure behind the lofty ridge of the Carpathian mountains. While Conſtantius gave
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0034700103:204"/>
laws to the Barbarians beyond the Danube, he diſtinguiſhed with ſpecious compaſſion the Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matian exiles, who had been expelled from their native country by the rebellion of their ſlaves, and who formed a very conſiderable acceſſion to the power of the Quadi. The emperor, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing a generous but artful ſyſtem of policy, releaſed the Sarmatians from the bands of this humiliating dependence, and reſtored them, by a ſeparate treaty, to the dignity of a nation united under the government of a king, the friend and ally of the republic. He declared his reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of aſſerting the juſtice of their cauſe, and of ſecuring the peace of the provinces by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpation, or at leaſt the baniſhment, of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migantes, whoſe manners were ſtill infected with the vices of their ſervile origin. The execution of this deſign was attended with more difficulty than glory. The territory of the Limigantes was protected againſt the Romans by the Danube, againſt the hoſtile Barbarians by the Teyſs. The marſhy lands which lay between thoſe rivers, and were often covered by their inundations, formed an intricate wilderneſs, pervious only to the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, who were acquainted with its ſecret paths and inacceſſible fortreſſes. On the approach of Conſtantius, the Limigantes tried the efficacy of prayers, of fraud, and of arms; but he ſternly rejected their ſupplications, defeated their rude ſtratagems, and repelled with ſkill and firmneſs the efforts of their irregular valour. One of their moſt warlike tribes, eſtabliſhed in a ſmall iſland towards the conflux of the Teyſs and the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0034700103:205"/>
Danube, conſented to paſs the river with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of ſurpriſing the emperor during the ſecurity of an amicable conference. They ſoon became the victims of the perfidy which they meditated. Encompaſſed on every ſide, tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pled down by the cavalry, ſlaughtered by the ſwords of the legions, they diſdained to aſk for mercy; and with an undaunted countenance ſtill graſped their weapons in the agonies of death. After this victory a conſiderable body of Romans was landed on the oppoſite banks of the Danube; the Taifalae, a Gothic tribe engaged in the ſervice of the empire, invaded the Limigantes on the ſide of the Teyſs; and their former maſters, the free Sarmatians, animated by hope and revenge, penetrated through the hilly country into the heart of their ancient poſſeſſions. A general conflagration revealed the huts of the Barbarians, which were ſeated in the depth of the wilderneſs; and the ſoldier fought with confidence on marſhy ground, which it was dangerous for him to tread. In this extremity the braveſt of the Limigantes were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to die in arms, rather than to yield: but the milder ſentiment, enforced by the authority of their elders, at length prevailed; and the ſuppliant crowd, followed by their wives and children, repaired to the Imperial camp, to learn their fate from the mouth of the conqueror. After celebrating his own clemency, which was ſtill inclined to pardon their repeated crimes, and to ſpare the remnant of a guilty nation, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius aſſigned for the place of their exile a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote country, where they might enjoy a ſafe and
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0034700103:206"/>
honourable repoſe. The Limigantes obeyed with reluctance; but before they could reach, at leaſt before they could occupy, their deſtined habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, they returned to the banks of the Danube, exaggerating the hardſhips of their ſituation, and requeſting, with fervent profeſſions of fidelity, that the emperor would grant them an undiſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſettlement within the limits of the Roman provinces. Inſtead of conſulting his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of their incurable perfidy, Conſtantius liſtened to his flatterers, who were ready to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the honour and advantage of accepting a colony of ſoldiers, at a time when it was much eaſier to obtain the pecuniary contributions, than the military ſervice of the ſubjects of the empire. The Limigantes were permitted to paſs the Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nube; and the emperor gave audience to the multitude in a large plain near the modern city of Buda. They ſurrounded the tribunal, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hear with reſpect an oration full of mildneſs and dignity; when one of the Barbarians, caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſhoe into the air, exclaimed with a loud voice, <hi>Marha! Marha!</hi> a word of defiance, which was received as the ſignal of the tumult. They ruſhed with fury to ſeize the perſon of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror; his royal throne and golden couch were pillaged by theſe rude hands; but the faithful defence of his guards, who died at his feet, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him a moment to mount a fleet horſe, and to eſcape from the confuſion. The diſgrace which had been incurred by a treacherous ſurpriſe was ſoon retrieved by the numbers and diſcipline of the Romans; and the combat was only terminated
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0034700103:207"/>
by the extinction of the name and nation of the Limigantes. The free Sarmatians were reinſtated in the poſſeſſion of their ancient ſeats; and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Conſtantius diſtruſted the levity of their character, he entertained ſome hopes that a ſenſe of gratitude might influence their future conduct. He had remarked the lofty ſtature and obſequious demeanour of Zizais, one of the nobleſt of their chiefs. He conferred on him the title of King; and Zizais proved that he was not unworthy to reign, by a ſincere and laſting attachment to the intereſt of his benefactor, who, after this ſplendid ſucceſs, received the name of <hi>Sarmaticus</hi> from the acclamations of his victorious army <note n="48" place="bottom">Genti Sarmatarum magno decori conſidens apud eos regem dedit.

Two of the eaſtern miniſters of Conſtantius, the Prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian praefect Muſonian, whoſe abilities were diſgraced by the want of truth and integrity, and Caſſian duke of Meſopotamia, a hardy and vete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran ſoldier, opened a ſecret negociation with the Satrap Tamſapor <note n="49" place="bottom">Ammian. xvi. 9.</note> Theſe overtures of peace, tranſlated into the ſervile and flattering language of Aſia, were tranſmitted to the camp of the Great King; who reſolved to ſignify, by an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſador,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0034700103:208"/>
the terms which he was inclined to grant to the ſuppliant Romans. Narſes, whom he inveſted with that character, was honourably received in his paſſage through Antioch and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople: he reached Sirmium after a long jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and, at his firſt audience, reſpectfully un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolded the ſilken veil which covered the haughty epiſtle of his ſovereign. Sapor, King of Kings, and Brother of the Sun and Moon (ſuch were the lofty titles affected by Oriental vanity), ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his ſatisfaction that his brother, Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Caeſar, had been taught wiſdom by adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. As the lawful ſucceſſor of Darius Hyſtaſpes, Sapor aſſerted, that the river Strymon in Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia was the true and ancient boundary of his empire; declaring, however, that as an evidence of his moderation, he would content himſelf with the provinces of Armenia and Meſopotamia, which had been fraudulently extorted from his anceſtors. He alleged, that, without the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of theſe diſputed countries, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to eſtabliſh any treaty on a ſolid and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent baſis; and he arrogantly threatened, that if his ambaſſador returned in vain, he was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to take the field in the ſpring, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the juſtice of his cauſe by the ſtrength of his invincible arms. Narſes, who was endowed with the moſt polite and amiable manners, endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as far as was conſiſtent with his duty, to ſoften the harſhneſs of the meſſage <note n="50" place="bottom">Ammianus (xvii. 5.) tranſcribes the haughty letter.

<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0034700103:209"/>
and ſubſtance were maturely weighed in the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial council, and he was diſmiſſed with the following anſwer: <q>Conſtantius had a right to diſclaim the officiouſneſs of his miniſters, who had acted without any ſpecific orders from the throne: he was not, however, averſe to an equal and honourable treaty; but it was highly indecent, as well as abſurd, to propoſe to the ſole and victorious emperor of the Roman world, the ſame conditions of peace which he had indignantly rejected at the time when his power was contracted within the narrow limits of the Eaſt: the chance of arms was uncertain; and Sapor ſhould recollect, that if the Romans had ſometimes been vanquiſhed in battle, they had almoſt always been ſucceſsful in the event of the war.</q> A few days after the departure of Narſes, three ambaſſadors were ſent to the court of Sapor, who was already returned from the Scythian expedition to his ordinary reſidence of Cteſiphon. A count, a notary, and a ſophiſt, had been ſelected for this important commiſſion; and Conſtantius, who was ſecretly anxious for the concluſion of the peace, entertained ſome hopes that the dignity of the firſt of theſe miniſters, the dexterity of the ſecond, and the rhetoric of the third <note n="51" place="bottom">Ammianus, xvii. 5. and Valeſius ad loc.

Their ſkilful guide, changing his plan of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, then conducted the army by a longer cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit, but through a fertile territory, towards the head of the Euphrates, where the infant river is reduced to a ſhallow and acceſſible ſtream. Sapor overlooked, with prudent diſdain, the ſtrength of Niſibis; but as he paſſed under the walls of Amida, he reſolved to try whether the majeſty of his preſence would not awe the garriſon into im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſubmiſſion. The ſacrilegious inſult of a random dart, which glanced againſt the royal tiara, convinced him of his error; and the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant monarch liſtened with impatience to the advice of his miniſters, who conjured him, not to ſacrifice the ſucceſs of his ambition to the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of his reſentment.

The emperor Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius had recently conferred on Amida the honour of his own name, and the additional fortifications of ſtrong walls and lofty towers. It was provided with an arſenal of military engines, and the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary garriſon had been reinforced to the amount of ſeven legions, when the place was inveſted by the arms of Sapor <note n="57" place="bottom">The operations of the ſiege of Amida are very minutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Ammianus (xix. 1—9.), who acted an honourable part in the defence, and eſcaped with difficulty when the city was ſtormed by the Perſians.</note>. His firſt and moſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine hopes depended on the ſucceſs of a general
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0034700103:214"/>
aſſault. To the ſeveral nations which followed his ſtandard their reſpective poſts were aſſigned; the ſouth to the Vertae, the north to the Alba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians, the eaſt to the Chionites, inflamed with grief and indignation; the weſt to the Segeſtans, the braveſt of his warriors, who covered their front with a formidable line of Indian elephants <note n="58" place="bottom">Of theſe four nations, the Albanians are too well known to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any deſcription. The Segeſtans inhabited a large and level country, which ſtill preſerves their name, to the ſouth of Khoraſan, and the weſt of Hindoſtan (See Geographia Nubienſis, p. 133. and d'Herbelot, Bibliotheque Orientale, p. 797.). Notwithſtanding the boaſted victory of Bahram (vol. i. p. 410.), the Segeſtans, above fourſcore years afterwards, appear as an independent nation, the ally of Perſia. We are ignorant of the ſituation of the Vertae and Chionites, but I am inclined to place them (at leaſt the latter) to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the confines of India and Scythia. See Ammian. xvi. 9.</note>. The Perſians, on every ſide, ſupported their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, and animated their courage; and the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch himſelf, careleſs of his rank and ſafety, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in the proſecution of the ſiege, the ardor of a youthful ſoldier. After an obſtinate combat, the Barbarians were repulſed; they inceſſantly returned to the charge; they were again driven back with a dreadful ſlaughter, and two rebel le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Gauls, who had been baniſhed into the Eaſt, ſignalized their undiſciplined courage by a nocturnal ſally into the heart of the Perſian camp. In one of the fierceſt of theſe repeated aſſaults, Amida was betrayed by the treachery of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter, who indicated to the Barbarians a ſecret and neglected ſtaircaſe, ſcooped out of the rock that hangs over the ſtream of the Tigris. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty choſen archers of the royal guard aſcended in ſilence to the third ſtory of a lofty tower which
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0034700103:215"/>
commanded the precipice; they elevated on high the Perſian banner, the ſignal of confidence to the aſſailants, and of diſmay to the beſieged; and if this devoted band could have maintained their poſt a few minutes longer, the reduction of the place might have been purchaſed by the ſacrifice of their lives. After Sapor had tried, without ſucceſs, the efficacy of force and of ſtratagem, he had recourſe to the ſlower but more certain opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a regular ſiege, in the conduct of which he was inſtructed by the ſkill of the Roman de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerters. The trenches were opened at a conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient diſtance, and the troops deſtined for that ſervice advanced under the portable cover of ſtrong hurdles, to fill up the ditch, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the foundations of the walls. Wooden towers were at the ſame time conſtructed, and moved forwards on wheels, till the ſoldiers, who were provided with every ſpecies of miſſile wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, could engage almoſt on level ground with the troops who defended the rampart. Every mode of reſiſtance which art could ſuggeſt, or courage could execute, was employed in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Amida, and the works of Sapor were more than once deſtroyed by the fire of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans. But the reſources of a beſieged city may be exhauſted. The Perſians repaired their loſſes, and puſhed their approaches; a large breach was made by the battering-ram, and the ſtrength of the garriſon, waſted by the ſword and by diſeaſe, yielded to the fury of the aſſault. The ſoldiers, the citizens, their wives, their children, all who
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0034700103:216"/>
had not time to eſcape through the oppoſite gate, were involved by the conquerors in a promiſcuous maſſacre.</p>
            <p>But the ruin of Amida was the ſafety of the <note place="margin">Of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara, &amp;c.</note> Roman provinces. As ſoon as the firſt tranſports of victory had ſubſided, Sapor was at leiſure to <note place="margin">A.

The corn was ripe when Sapor invaded Meſopotamia; "Cum jam ſtipulâ flavente turgerent;" a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which, in the latitude of Aleppo, would naturally refer us to the month of April or May. See Harmer's Obſervations on Scripture, vol. i. p. 41. Shaw's Travels, p. 335. edit. 4 to. 2. The progreſs of Sapor was checked by the overflowing of the Euphrates, which generally happens in July and Auguſt. Plin. Hiſt. Nat. v. 21. Viaggi di Pietro della Valle, tom. i. p. 696. 3. When Sapor had taken Amida, after a ſiege of ſeventy-three days, the autumn was far advanced. <q>Autumno precipiti haedoruinque improbo ſidere extoto.</q> To reconcile theſe apparent contradictions, we muſt allow for ſome delay in the Perſian king, ſome inaccuracy in the hiſtorian, and ſome diſorder in the ſeaſons.</note>. Thirty thouſand of his veterans had fallen under the walls of Amida, during the continuance of a ſiege which laſted ſeventy-three days; and the diſappointed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch returned to his capital with affected triumph and ſecret mortification. It is more than prob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, that the inconſtancy of his Barbarian allies was tempted to relinquiſh a war in which they had encountered ſuch unexpected difficulties; and that the aged king of the Chionites, ſatiated with revenge, turned away with horror from a ſcene of action where he had been deprived of the hope of his family and nation. The ſtrength as well as
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0034700103:217"/>
ſpirit of the army with which Sapor took the field in the enſuing ſpring, was no longer equal to the unbounded views of his ambition. Inſtead of aſpiring to the conqueſt of the Eaſt, he was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to content himſelf with the reduction of two fortified cities of Meſopotamia, Singara and Bezabde <note n="60" place="bottom">The account of theſe ſieges is given by Ammianus, xx. 6, 7.</note>; the one ſituate in the midſt of a ſandy deſert, the other in a ſmall peninſula, ſurrounded almoſt on every ſide by the deep and rapid ſtream of the Tigris. Five Roman legions, of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive ſize, to which they had been reduced in the age of Conſtantine, were made priſoners, and ſent into remote captivity on the extreme confines of Perſia. After diſmantling the walls of Singara, the conqueror abandoned that ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary and ſequeſtered place; but he carefully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored the fortifications of Bezabde, and fixed in that important poſt a garriſon or colony of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terans; amply ſupplied with every means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and animated by high ſentiments of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and fidelity. Towards the cloſe of the cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, the arms of Sapor incurred ſome diſgrace by an unſucceſsful enterprize againſt Virtha, or Tecrit, a ſtrong, or, as it was univerſally eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed till the age of Tamerlane, an impregnable fortreſs of the independent Arabs <note n="61" place="bottom">For the identity of Virtha and Tecrit, ſee d'Anville, Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphie Ancienne, tom. ii. p. 201.

By a ſecond order, which iſſued from the ſame jealous and inconſtant counſels, Urſicinus was again diſpatched to the frontier of Meſopota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia, and condemned to ſuſtain the labours of a war, the honours of which had been transferred to his unworthy rival. Sabinian fixed his indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſtation under the walls of Edeſſa; and while he amuſed himſelf with the idle parade of military exerciſe, and moved to the ſound of flutes in the Pyrrhic dance, the public defence was abandoned to the boldneſs and diligence of the former gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Eaſt. But whenever Urſicinus recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended any vigorous plan of operations; when he propoſed, at the head of a light and active army, to wheel round the foot of the mountains, to intercept the convoys of the enemy, to haraſs the wide extent of the Perſian lines, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve

the diſtreſs of Amida; the timid and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious commander alleged, that he was reſtrained by his poſitive orders from endangering the ſafety of the troops. Amida was at length taken; its braveſt defenders, who had eſcaped the ſword of the Barbarians, died in the Roman camp by the hand of the executioner; and Urſicinus himſelf, after ſupporting the diſgrace of a partial enquiry, was puniſhed for the miſconduct of Sabinian by the loſs of his military rank. But Conſtantius ſoon experienced the truth of the prediction which honeſt indignation had extorted from his injured lieutenant, that as long as ſuch maxims of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment were ſuffered to prevail, the emperor himſelf would find it no eaſy taſk to defend his eaſtern dominions from the invaſion of a foreign enemy. When he had ſubdued or pacified the Barbarians of the Danube, Conſtantius proceeded by ſlow marches into the Eaſt; and after he had wept over the ſmoking ruins of Amida, he formed, with a powerful army, the ſiege of Bezabde. The walls were ſhaken by the reiterated efforts of the moſt enormous of the battering-rams; the town was reduced to the laſt extremity; but it was ſtill defended by the patient and intrepid valour of the garriſon, till the approach of the rainy ſeaſon ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged the emperor to raiſe the ſiege, and inglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly to retreat into his winter-quarters at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioch <note n="63" place="bottom">Ammian. xx. 11.

            <p>In the blind fury of civil diſcord, Conſtantius <note place="margin">Invaſion of Gaul by the Germans.</note> had abandoned to the Barbarians of Germany the countries of Gaul, which ſtill acknowledged the authority of his rival.

But the emperor, who for a temporary ſervice had thus imprudently provoked the rapacious ſpirit of the Barbarians, ſoon diſcovered and lamented the difficulty of diſmiſſing theſe formidable allies, after they had taſted the richneſs of the Roman ſoil. Regardleſs of the nice diſtinction of loyalty and rebellion, theſe undiſciplined robbers treated as their natural enemies all the ſubjects of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, who poſſeſſed any property which they were deſirous of acquiring. Forty-five flouriſhing cities, Tongres, Cologne, Treves, Worms, Spires, Straſburgh, &amp;c. beſides a far greater number of
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0034700103:221"/>
towns and villages, were pillaged, and for the moſt part reduced to aſhes. The Barbarians of Germany, ſtill faithful to the maxims of their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, abhorred the confinement of walls, to which they applied the odious names of priſons and ſepulchres; and fixing their independent ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations on the banks of rivers, the Rhine, the Moſelle, and the Meuſe, they ſecured themſelves againſt the danger of a ſurpriſe, by a rude and haſty fortification of large trees, which were felled and thrown acroſs the roads. The Alemanni were eſtabliſhed in the modern countries of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſace and Lorraine; the Franks occupied the iſland of the Batavians, together with an extenſive diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict of Brabant, which was then known by the appellation of Toxandria <note n="65" place="bottom">Ammianus (xvi. 8.). This name ſeems to be derived from the Toxandri of Pliny, and very frequently occurs in the hiſtories of the middle age. Toxandria was a country of woods and moraſſes, which extended from the neighbourhood of Tongres to the conflux of the Vahal and the Rhine. See Valeſius, Notit.

The retired ſcholaſtic edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of Julian, in which he had been more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant with books than with arms, with the dead than with the living, left him in profound ignorance of the practical arts of war and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and when he awkwardly repeated ſome military exerciſe which it was neceſſary for him to learn, he exclaimed with a ſigh, <q>O Plato, Plato, what a taſk for a philoſopher!</q> Yet even this ſpeculative philoſophy, which men of buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs are too apt to deſpiſe, had filled the mind of Julian with the nobleſt precepts, and the moſt ſhining examples; had animated him with the love of virtue, the deſire of fame, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of death.

in the ſevere diſcipline of a camp. The ſimple wants of nature regulated the meaſure of his food and ſleep. Rejecting with diſdain the delicacies provided for his table, he ſatisfied his appetite with the coarſe and common fare which was allotted to the meaneſt ſoldiers. During the rigour of a Gallic winter, he never ſuffered a fire in his bed-chamber; and after a ſhort and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſlumber, he frequently roſe in the middle of the night from a carpet ſpread on the floor, to diſpatch any urgent buſineſs, to viſit his rounds, or to ſteal a few moments for the proſecution of his favourite ſtudies <note n="67" place="bottom">The private life of Julian in Gaul, and the ſevere diſcipline which he embraced, are diſplayed by Ammianus (xvi. 5.), who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to praiſe, and by Julian himſelf, who affects to ridicule (Miſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pogon, p. 340.), a conduct, which, in a prince of the houſe of Conſtantine, might juſtly excite the ſurpriſe of mankind.</note>. The precepts of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which he had hitherto practiſed on fancied topics of declamation, were more uſefully applied to excite or to aſſuage the paſſions of an armed multitude: and although Julian, from his early habits of converſation and literature, was more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly acquainted with the beauties of the Greek language, he had attained a competent know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Latin tongue <note n="68" place="bottom">Aderat Latine quoque diſſerenti ſufficiens ſermo. Ammianus, xvi. 5. But Julian, educated in the ſchools of Greece, always con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the language of the Romans as a foreign and popular dialect, which he might uſe on neceſſary occaſions.</note>. Since Julian was not originally deſigned for the character of a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator, or a judge, it is probable that the civil juriſprudence of the Romans had not engaged any conſiderable ſhare of his attention: but he
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0034700103:224"/>
derived from his philoſophic ſtudies an inflexible regard for juſtice, tempered by a diſpoſition to clemency; the knowledge of the general prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of equity and evidence, and the faculty of patiently inveſtigating the moſt intricate and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious queſtions which could be propoſed for his diſcuſſion. The meaſures of policy, and the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of war, muſt ſubmit to the various acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of circumſtance and character, and the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practiſed ſtudent will often be perplexed in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of the moſt perfect theory. But in the acquiſition of this important ſcience, Julian was aſſiſted by the active vigour of his own genius, as well as by the wiſdom and experience of Salluſt, an officer of rank, who ſoon conceived a ſincere attachment for a prince ſo worthy of his friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and whoſe incorruptible integrity was adorned by the talent of inſinuating the harſheſt truths, without wounding the delicacy of a royal ear <note n="69" place="bottom">We are ignorant of the actual office of this excellent miniſter, whom Julian afterwards created praefect of Gaul. Salluſt was ſpeedily recalled by the jealouſy of the emperor; and we may ſtill read a ſenſible but pedantic diſcourſe (p. 240—252), in which Julian deplores the loſs of ſo valuable a friend, to whom he acknowledges himſelf indebted for his reputation, See La Bleterie, Preface à la Vie de Jovien, p. 20.</note>.</p>
            <p>Immediately after Julian had received the <note place="margin">His firſt campaign in Gaul,</note> purple at Milan, he was ſent into Gaul, with a feeble retinue of three hundred and ſixty ſoldiers. <note place="margin">A.

deliverance of Autun. That large and antient city, protected only by a ruined wall and puſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanimous garriſon, was ſaved by the generous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of a few veterans, who reſumed their arms for the defence of their country. In his march from Autun, through the heart of the Gallic provinces, Julian embraced with ardour the earlieſt opportunity of ſignalizing his courage. At the head of a ſmall body of archers, and heavy cavalry, he preferred the ſhorter but the more dangerous of two roads; and ſometimes eluding, and ſometimes reſiſting, the attacks of the Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, who were maſters of the field, he arrived with honour and ſafety at the camp near Rheims, where the Roman troops had been ordered to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble. The aſpect of their young prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived the drooping ſpirit of the ſoldiers, and they marched from Rheims in ſearch of the enemy, with a confidence which had almoſt proved fatal to them. The Alemanni, familiarized to the knowledge of the country, ſecretly collected their ſcattered forces, and ſeizing the opportunity of a dark and rainy day, poured with unexpected fury on the rear-guard of the Romans. Before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitable diſorder could be remedied, two legions were deſtroyed; and Julian was taught by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, that caution and vigilance are the moſt important leſſons of the art of war. In a ſecond and more ſucceſsful action, he recovered and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his military fame; but as the agility of the Barbarians ſaved them from the purſuit, his vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory was neither bloody nor deciſive.

The power of the enemy was yet unbroken; and the Caeſar had no ſooner ſeparated his troops, and fixed his own quarters at Sens, in the centre of Gaul, than he was ſurrounded and beſieged by a numerous hoſt of Germans. Reduced in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity to the reſources of his own mind, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played a prudent intrepidity which compenſated for all the deficiencies of the place and garriſon; and the Barbarians, at the end of thirty days, were obliged to retire with diſappointed rage.</p>

Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellus, maſter-general of the cavalry in Gaul, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreting too ſtrictly the jealous orders of the court, beheld with ſupine indifference the diſtreſs of Julian, and had reſtrained the troops under his command from marching to the relief of Sens.

In his room Severus was appointed general of the cavalry; an experienced ſoldier, of approved courage and fidelity, who could adviſe with reſpect, and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute with zeal; and who ſubmitted, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance, to the ſupreme command which Julian, by the intereſt of his patroneſs Euſebia, at length obtained over the armies of Gaul <note n="72" place="bottom">Severus, non diſcors, non arrogans, ſed longa militiae frugali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate compertus; et eum recta praeeuntem ſecuturus, ut ductorem mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigerus miles.

Julian himſelf, at the head of the remains of the veteran bands, and of ſome new levies which he had been permitted to form, boldly penetrated into the centre of the German cantonments, and carefully re-eſtabliſhed the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications of Saverne, in an advantageous poſt, which would either check the incurſions, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept the retreat, of the enemy. At the ſame time Barbatio, general of the infantry, advanced from Milan with an army of thirty thouſand men, and paſſing the mountains, prepared to throw a bridge over the Rhine, in the neighbourhood of Baſil. It was reaſonable to expect that the Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manni, preſſed on either ſide by the Roman arms,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0034700103:228"/>
would ſoon be forced to evacuate the provinces of Gaul, and to haſten to the defence of their native country. But the hopes of the campaign were defeated by the incapacity, or the envy, or the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret inſtructions, of Barbatio; who acted as if he had been the enemy of the Caeſar, and the ſecret ally of the Barbarians. The negligence with which he permitted a troop of pillagers freely to paſs, and to return almoſt before the gates of his camp, may be imputed to his want of abilities; but the treaſonable act of burning a number of boats, and a ſuperfluous ſtock of proviſions, which would have been of the moſt eſſential ſervice to the army of Gaul, was an evidence of his hoſtile and criminal intentions. The Germans deſpiſed an enemy who appeared deſtitute either of power or of inclination to offend them; and the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious retreat of Barbatio deprived Julian of the expected ſupport; and left him to extricate him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from a hazardous ſituation, where he could neither remain with ſafety, nor retire with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour <note n="73" place="bottom">On the deſign and failure of the co-operation between Julian and Barbatio, ſee Ammianus (xvi. 11.), and Libanius, Orat. x. p. 273.</note>.</p>

ponderous javelin, which he had victoriouſly wielded againſt the brother of Magnentius, led the van of the Barbarians, and moderated by his experience the martial ardour which his example inſpired <note n="74" place="bottom">Ammianus (xvi. 12.) deſcribes, with his inflated eloquence, the figure and character of Chnodomar.

He was followed by ſix other kings, by ten princes of regal extraction, by a long train of high-ſpirited nobles, and by thirty-five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the braveſt warriors of the tribes of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many. The confidence derived from the view of their own ſtrength, was encreaſed by the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which they received from a deſerter, that the Caeſar, with a feeble army of thirteen thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, occupied a poſt about one-and-twenty miles from their camp of Straſburgh. With this inadequate force, Julian reſolved to ſeek and to encounter the Barbarian hoſt; and the chance of a general action was preferred to the tedious and uncertain operation of ſeparately engaging the diſperſed parties of the Alemanni. The Romans marched in cloſe order, and in two columns, the cavalry on the right, the infantry on the left; and the day was ſo far ſpent when they appeared in ſight of the enemy, that Julian was deſirous of deferring the battle till the next morning, and of allowing his troops to recruit their exhauſted ſtrength by the neceſſary refreſhments of ſleep and food. Yielding, however, with ſome reluctance,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0034700103:230"/>
to the clamours of the ſoldiers, and even to the opinion of his council, he exhorted them to juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify by their valour the eager impatience, which, in caſe of a defeat, would be univerſally branded with the epithets of raſhneſs and preſumption. The trumpets ſounded, the military ſhout was heard through the field, and the two armies ruſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with equal fury to the charge. The Caeſar, who conducted in perſon his right wing, depended on the dexterity of his archers, and the weight of his cuiraſſiers. But his ranks were inſtantly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by an irregular mixture of light-horſe and of light-infantry, and he had the mortification of beholding the flight of ſix hundred of his moſt renowned cuiraſſiers <note n="75" place="bottom">After the battle, Julian ventured to revive the rigour of ancient diſcipline, by expoſing theſe fugitives in female apparel to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion of the whole camp.

The fugitives were ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped and rallied by the preſence and authority of Julian, who, careleſs of his own ſafety, threw himſelf before them, and urging every motive of ſhame and honour, led them back againſt the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious enemy. The conflict between the two lines of infantry was obſtinate and bloody. The Germans poſſeſſed the ſuperiority of ſtrength and ſtature, the Romans that of diſcipline and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per; and as the Barbarians, who ſerved under the ſtandard of the empire, united the reſpective advantages of both parties, their ſtrenuous efforts, guided by a ſkilful leader, at length determined the event of the day.

Chnodomar himſelf was ſurrounded and taken priſoner, with three of his brave companions, who had devoted themſelves to follow in life or death the fate of their chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Julian received him with military pomp in the council of his officers; and expreſſing a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous pity for the fallen ſtate, diſſembled his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward contempt for the abject humiliation of his captive. Inſtead of exhibiting the vanquiſhed king of the Alemanni, as a grateful ſpectacle to the cities of Gaul, he reſpectfully laid at the feet of the emperor this ſplendid trophy of his victory.

            <p>After Julian had repulſed the Alemanni from <note place="margin">Julian ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dues the Franks,</note> the provinces of the Upper Rhine, he turned his arms againſt the Franks, who were ſeated nearer <note place="margin">A.

Although they were ſtrongly actuated by the allurements of rapine, they profeſſed a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted love of war; which they conſidered as the ſupreme honour and felicity of human nature; and their minds and bodies were ſo completely hardened by perpectual action, that, according to the lively expreſſion of an orator, the ſnows of winter were as pleaſant to them as the flowers of ſpring. In the month of December, which followed the battle of Straſburg, Julian attacked a body of ſix hundred Franks, who had thrown themſelves into two caſtles on the Meuſe <note n="80" place="bottom">Ammianus, xvii. 2.

In the midſt of that ſevere ſeaſon they ſuſtained, with inflexible conſtancy, a ſiege of fifty-four days; till at length, exhauſted by hunger, and ſatisfied that the vigilance of the enemy in breaking the ice of the river, left them no hopes of eſcape, the

Ordering his ſoldiers to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with biſcuit for twenty days, he ſuddenly pitched his camp near Tongres, while the enemy ſtill ſuppoſed him in his winter-quarters of Paris, expecting the ſlow arrival of his convoys from Aquitain. Without allowing the Franks to unite or to deliberate, he ſkilfully ſpread his legions from Cologne to the ocean; and by the terror, as well as by the ſucceſs of his arms, ſoon reduced the ſuppliant tribes to implore the cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency, and to obey the commands, of their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror. The Chamavians ſubmiſſively retired to their former habitations beyond the Rhine: but the Salians were permitted to poſſeſs their new eſtabliſhment of Toxandria, as the ſubjects and

The treaty was ratified by ſolemn oaths; and perpetual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectors were appointed to reſide among the Franks, with the authority of enforcing the ſtrict obſervance of the conditions. An incident is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, intereſting enough in itſelf, and by no means repugnant to the character of Julian, who ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly contrived both the plot and the cataſtrophe of the tragedy. When the Chamavians ſued for peace, he required the ſon of their king, as the only hoſtage in whom he could rely. A mournful ſilence, interrupted by tears and groans, declared the ſad perplexity of the Barbarians; and their aged chief lamented in pathetic lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that his private loſs was now embittered by a ſenſe of the public calamity. While the Chamavians lay proſtrate at the foot of his throne, the royal captive, whom they believed to have been ſlain, unexpectedly appeared before their eyes; and as ſoon as the tumult of joy was huſhed into attention, the Caeſar addreſſed the aſſembly in the following terms: <q>Behold the ſon, the prince, whom you wept. You had loſt him by your fault. God and the Romans have reſtored him to you. I ſhall ſtill preſerve and educate the youth, rather as a monument of my own virtue, than as a pledge of your ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity. Should you preſume to violate the

faith which you have ſworn, the arms of the republic will avenge the perfidy, not on the innocent, but on the guilty.</q> The Barbarians withdrew from his preſence, impreſſed with the warmeſt ſentiments of gratitude and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion <note n="83" place="bottom">This intereſting ſtory, which Zoſimus has abridged, is related by Eunapius (in Excerpt.

The diſcourſe which is addreſſed to the Athenians contains an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, though general, account of the war againſt the Germans.</note>. Caeſar has related, with conſcious pride, the manner in which he <hi>twice</hi> paſſed the Rhine.

Julian ad S. P. Q. Athen. p. 280.</note>. The conſterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Germans, after the battle of Straſburgh, encouraged him to the firſt attempt; and the reluctance of the troops ſoon yielded to the perſuaſive eloquence of a leader, who ſhared the fatigues and dangers which he impoſed on the meaneſt of the ſoldiers. The villages on either
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0034700103:236"/>
ſide of the Meyn, which were plentifully ſtored with corn and cattle, felt the ravages of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vading army. The principal houſes, conſtructed with ſome imitation of Roman elegance, were conſumed by the flames; and the Caeſar boldly advanced about ten miles, till his progreſs was ſtopped by a dark and impenetrable foreſt, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by ſubterraneous paſſages, which threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with ſecret ſnares and ambuſh, every ſtep of the aſſailant. The ground was already covered with ſnow; and Julian, after repairing an ancient caſtle which had been erected by Trajan, granted a truce of ten months to the ſubmiſſive Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. At the expiration of the truce, Julian undertook a ſecond expedition beyond the Rhine, to humble the pride of Surmar and Hortaire, two of the kings of the Alemanni, who had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the battle of Straſburgh. They promiſed to reſtore all the Roman captives who yet remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alive; and as the Caeſar had procured an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act account from the cities and villages of Gaul, of the inhabitants whom they had loſt, he detected every attempt to deceive him with a degree of readineſs and accuracy, which almoſt eſtabliſhed the belief of his ſupernatural knowledge. His third expedition was ſtill more ſplendid and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant than the two former. The Germans had collected their military powers, and moved along the oppoſite banks of the river, with a deſign of deſtroying the bridge, and of preventing the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Romans. But this judicious plan of defence was diſconcerted by a ſkilful diverſion. Three hundred light armed and active ſoldiers
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0034700103:237"/>
were detached in forty ſmall boats, to fall down the ſtream in ſilence, and to land at ſome diſtance from the poſts of the enemy. They executed their orders with ſo much boldneſs and celerity, that they had almoſt ſurpriſed the Barbarian chiefs, who returned in the fearleſs confidence of intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation from one of their nocturnal feſtivals. Without repeating the uniform and diſguſting tale of ſlaughter and devaſtation, it is ſufficient to obſerve, that Julian dictated his own conditions of peace to ſix of the haughtieſt kings of the Alemanni, three of whom were permitted to view the ſevere diſcipline and martial pomp of a Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man camp. Followed by twenty thouſand cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, whom he had reſcued from the chains of the Barbarians, the Caeſar repaſſed the Rhine, after terminating a war, the ſucceſs of which has been compared to the ancient glories of the Punic and Cimbric victories.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the valour and conduct of Julian <note place="margin">Reſtores the cities of Gaul.</note> had ſecured an interval of peace, he applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to a work more congenial to his humane and philoſophic temper. The cities of Gaul, which had ſuffered from the inroads of the Barbarians, he diligently repaired; and ſeven important poſts, between Mentz and the mouth of the Rhine, are particularly mentioned, as having been rebuilt and fortified by the order of Julian <note n="86" place="bottom">Ammian. xviii. 2. Libanius, Orat. x. p. 279, 280. Of theſe ſeven poſts, four are at preſent towns of ſome conſequence; Bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen, Andernach, Bonn, and Nuyſs.

The active zeal of Julian urged the proſecution of the work; and ſuch was the ſpirit which he had diffuſed among the troops, that the auxiliaries themſelves, waving their exemption from any duties of fatigue, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended in the moſt ſervile labours with the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of the Roman ſoldiers. It was incumbent on the Caeſar to provide for the ſubſiſtence, as well as for the ſafety, of the inhabitants and of the garriſons. The deſertion of the former, and the mutiny of the latter, muſt have been the fatal and inevitable conſequences of famine. The tillage of the provinces of Gaul had been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the calamities of war; but the ſcanty harveſts of the continent were ſupplied, by his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal care, from the plenty of the adjacent iſland. Six hundred large barks, framed in the foreſt of the Ardennes, made ſeveral voyages to the coaſt of Britain; and returning from thence laden with corn, ſailed up the Rhine, and diſtributed their cargoes to the ſeveral towns and fortreſſes along the banks of the river <note n="87" place="bottom">We may credit Julian himſelf, Orat. ad S. P. Q. Athenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſem, p. 280. who gives a very particular account of the tranſaction. Zoſimus adds two hundred veſſels more, l. iii. p. 145. If we compute the 600 corn ſhips of Julian at only ſeventy tons each, they were capable of exporting 120,000 quarters (See Arbuthnot's Weights and Meaſures, p. 237.); and the country, which could bear ſo large an exportation, muſt already have attained an improved ſtate of agriculture.</note>.

reſtored a free and ſecure navigation, which Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantius had offered to purchaſe at the expence of his dignity, and of a tributary preſent of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds of ſilver. The emperor parſimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly refuſed to his ſoldiers the ſums which he granted with a laviſh and trembling hand to the Barbarians.

He devoted the leiſure of his winter-quarters to the offices of civil government; and affected to aſſume, with more pleaſure, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a magiſtrate than that of a general. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he took the field, he devolved on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial governors, moſt of the public and private cauſes which had been referred to his tribunal; but, on his return, he carefully reviſed their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, mitigated the rigour of the law, and pronounced a ſecond judgment on the judges themſelves. Superior to the laſt temptation of virtuous minds, an indiſcreet and intemperate zeal for juſtice, he reſtrained, with calmneſs and dignity, the warmth of an advocate who proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0034700103:240"/>
for extortion, the preſident of the Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonneſe province. <q>Who will ever be found guilty, exclaimed the vehement Delphidius, if it be enough to deny?</q> 
               <q>and who, replied Julian, will ever be innocent, if it is ſufficient to affirm?</q> In the general adminiſtration of peace and war, the intereſt of the ſovereign is commonly the ſame as that of his people; but Conſtantius would have thought himſelf deeply injured, if the virtues of Julian had defrauded him of any part of the tribute which he extorted from an oppreſſed and exhauſted country. The prince who was inveſted with the enſigns of royalty, might ſometimes preſume to correct the rapacious inſolence of the inferior agents; to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe their corrupt arts, and to introduce an equal and eaſier mode of collection. But the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the finances was more ſafely entruſted to Florentius, Praetorian praefect of Gaul, an effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate tyrant, incapable of pity or remorſe; and the haughty miniſter complained of the moſt decent and gentle oppoſition, while Julian himſelf was rather inclined to cenſure the weakneſs of his own behaviour. The Caeſar had rejected with abhorrence, a mandate for the levy of an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary tax; a new ſuperdiction, which the prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect had offered for his ſignature; and the faithful picture of the public miſery, by which he had been obliged to juſtify his refuſal, offended the court of Conſtantius. We may enjoy the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of reading the ſentiments of Julian, as he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes them with warmth and freedom in a letter to one of his moſt intimate friends. After ſtating
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0034700103:241"/>
his own conduct, he proceeds in the following terms: <q>Was it poſſible for the diſciple of Plato and Ariſtotle to act otherwiſe than I have done? Could I abandon the unhappy ſubjects entruſted to my care? Was I not called upon to defend them from the repeated injuries of theſe unfeeling robbers? A tribune who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts his poſt is puniſhed with death, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the honours of burial. With what juſtice could I pronounce <hi>his</hi> ſentence, if, in the hour of danger, I myſelf neglected a duty far more ſacred and far more important? God has placed me in this elevated poſt; his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence will guard and ſupport me. Should I be condemned to ſuffer, I ſhall derive comfort from the teſtimony of a pure and upright con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience. Would to heaven, that I ſtill poſſeſſed a counſellor like Salluſt! If they think proper to ſend me a ſucceſſor, I ſhall ſubmit without reluctance; and had much rather improve the ſhort opportunity of doing good, than enjoy a long and laſting impunity of evil <note n="90" place="bottom">Ammian. xvii. 3.

The river bathed the foot of the walls; and the town was acceſſible only by two wooden bridges. A foreſt overſpread the northern ſide of the Seine; but on the ſouth, the ground, which now bears the name of the Univerſity, was inſenſibly covered with houſes, and adorned with a palace and amphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theatre, baths, an aqueduct, and a field of Mars for the exerciſe of the Roman troops.

            </head>
            <p>THE public eſtabliſhment of Chriſtianity may be conſidered as one of thoſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and domeſtic revolutions which excite the moſt lively curioſity, and afford the moſt valuable inſtruction. The victories and the civil policy of Conſtantine no longer influence the ſtate of Europe; but a conſiderable portion of the globe ſtill retains the impreſſion which it received from the converſion of that monarch; and the eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical inſtitutions of his reign are ſtill connected, by an indiſſoluble chain, with the opinions, the paſſions, and the intereſts of the preſent genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>In the conſideration of a ſubject which may be <note place="margin">Date of the converſion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine.</note> examined with impartiality, but cannot be viewed with indifference, a difficulty immediately ariſes of a very unexpected nature; that of aſcertaining the real and preciſe date of the converſion of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine. The eloquent Lactantius, in the midſt <note place="margin">A. D. 306.</note> of his court, ſeems impatient <note n="1" place="bottom">The date of the Divine Inſtitutions of Lactantius has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curately diſcuſſed, difficulties have been ſtarted, ſolutions propoſed, and an expedient imagined of two <hi>original</hi> editions; the former pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed during the perſecution of Diocletian, the latter under that of Licinius. See Dufreſnoy, Prefat. p. v. Tillemont, Mem. Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt. tom. vi. p. 465—470. Lardner's Credibility, part ii. vol. vii. p. 78—86. For my own part, I am <hi>almoſt</hi> convinced that Lactantius dedicated his Inſtitutions to the ſovereign of Gaul, at a time when Galerius, Maximin, and even Licinius, perſecuted the Chriſtians; that is, between the years 306 and 311.</note> to proclaim to the
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:0034700103:246"/>
world the glorious example of the ſovereign of Gaul; who, in the firſt moments of his reign, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and adored the majeſty of the true and only God <note n="2" place="bottom">Lactant. Divin. Inſtitut. i. 1. vii. 27. The firſt and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant of theſe paſſages is indeed wanting in twenty-eight manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts; but it is found in nineteen. If we weigh the comparative value of thoſe manuſcripts, one of 900 years old, in the king of France's library, may be alleged in it's favour; but the paſſage is omitted in the correct manuſcript of Bologna, which the P. de Montfaucon aſcribes to the ſixth or ſeventh century (Diarium Italic. p. 409.). The taſte of moſt of the editors (except Iſaeus, ſee Lactant. edit. Dufreſnoy, tom. i. p. 596.) has felt the genuine ſtyle of Lactantius.</note>. The learned Euſebius has aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed the faith of Conſtantine to the miraculous ſign which was diſplayed in the heavens whilſt he meditated and prepared the Italian expedition <note n="3" place="bottom">Euſeb. in Vit. Conſtant. l. i. c. 27—32.</note>. <note place="margin">A.

The per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity <note place="margin">A. D. 326.</note> produced by theſe diſcordant authorities, is derived from the behaviour of Conſtantine him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. According to the ſtrictneſs of eccleſiaſtical language, the firſt of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> emperors was unworthy of that name, till the moment of his death; ſince it was only during his laſt illneſs <note place="margin">A. D. 337.</note> that he received, as a catechumen, the impoſition
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0034700103:247"/>
of hands <note n="5" place="bottom">That rite was <hi>always</hi> uſed in making a catechumen (ſee Bing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham's Antiquities, l. x. c. 1. p. 419. Dom.

From the connection of theſe two facts, Valeſius (ad loc. Euſeb.) has drawn the concluſion which is reluctantly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by Tillemont (Hiſt. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 628.), and oppoſed with feeble arguments by Moſheim (p. 968.).</note>, and was afterwards admitted, by the initiatory rites of baptiſm, into the number of the faithful <note n="6" place="bottom">Euſeb. in Vit. Conſtant. l. iv. c. 61, 62, 63. The legend of Conſtantine's baptiſm at Rome, thirteen years before his death, was invented in the eighth century, as a proper motive for his <hi>donation.</hi> Such has been the gradual progreſs of knowledge, that a ſtory, of which Cardinal Baronius (Annal. Eccleſiaſt. A. D. 324, No. 43—49.) declared himſelf the unbluſhing advocate, is now feebly ſupported, even within the verge of the Vatican. See the Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates Chriſtianae, tom. ii. p. 232; a work publiſhed with ſix appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bations at Rome, in the year 1751, by Father Mamachi, a learned Dominican.</note>. The Chriſtianity of Conſtantine muſt be allowed in a much more vague and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified ſenſe; and the niceſt accuracy is required in tracing the ſlow and almoſt imperceptible grada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by which the monarch declared himſelf the protector, and at length the proſelyte, of the church. It was an arduous taſk to eradicate the habits and prejudices of his education, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the divine power of Chriſt, and to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand that the truth of <hi>his</hi> revelation was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible with the worſhip of the gods. The obſtacles which he had probably experienced in his own mind, inſtructed him to proceed with caution in the momentous change of a national religion; and he inſenſibly diſcovered his new opinions, as far as he could enforce them with
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0034700103:248"/>
ſafety and with effect. During the whole courſe of his reign, the ſtream of Chriſtianity flowed with a gentle, though accelerated, motion: but its general direction was ſometimes checked, and ſometimes diverted, by the accidental circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the times, and by the prudence, or poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly by the caprice, of the monarch. His mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were permitted to ſignify the intentions of their maſter in the various language which was beſt adapted to their reſpective principles; <note n="7" place="bottom">

While this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant revolution yet remained in ſuſpenſe, the Chriſtians and the Pagans watched the conduct of their ſovereign with the ſame anxiety, but with very oppoſite ſentiments. The former were prompted by every motive of zeal, as well as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to exaggerate the marks of his favour, and the evidences of his faith. The latter, till their juſt apprehenſions were changed into deſpair and

The ſame paſſions and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices have engaged the partial writers of the times to connect the public profeſſion of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity with the moſt glorious or the moſt igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious aera of the reign of Conſtantine.</p>
            <p>Whatever ſymptoms of Chriſtian piety might <note place="margin">His Pagan ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> tranſpire in the diſcourſes or actions of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, he perſevered till he was near forty years of age in the practice of the eſtabliſhed religion <note n="10" place="bottom">Theodoret (l. i. c. 18.) ſeems to inſinuate that Helena gave her ſon a Chriſtian education; but we may be aſſured, from the ſuperior authority of Euſebius (in Vit.

His liberality reſtored and enriched the temples of the gods: the medals which iſſued from his Imperial mint are impreſſed with the figures and attributes of Jupiter and Apollo, of Mars and Hercules; and his filial piety increaſed the council of Olympus by the ſolemn apotheoſis of his father Conſtantius <note n="11" place="bottom">See the medals of Conſtantine in Ducange and Banduri. As few cities had retained the privilege of coining, almoſt all the medals of that age iſſued from the mint under the ſanction of the Imperial authority.</note>. But the devotion of Conſtantine was more peculiarly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected to the genius of the Sun, the Apollo of Greek and Roman mythology; and he was pleaſed to be repreſented with the ſymbols of the
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0034700103:250"/>
God of Light and Poetry. The unerring ſhafts of that deity, the brightneſs of his eyes, his laurel wreath, immortal beauty, and elegant accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, ſeem to point him out as the patron of a young hero. The altars of Apollo were crowned with the votive offerings of Conſtantine; and the credulous multitude were taught to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the emperor was permitted to behold with mortal eyes the viſible majeſty of their tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telar deity; and that, either waking or in a viſion, he was bleſſed with the auſpicious omens of a long and victorious reign. The Sun was univerſally celebrated as the invincible guide and protector of Conſtantine; and the Pagans might reaſonably expect that the inſulted god would purſue with unrelenting vengeance the impiety of his ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful favourite <note n="12" place="bottom">The panegyric of Eumenius (vii. inter Panegyr.

            <p>As long as Conſtantine exerciſed a limited <note place="margin">He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tects the Chriſtians of Gaul,</note> ſovereignty over the provinces of Gaul, his Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian ſubjects were protected by the authority, and perhaps by the laws, of a prince, who wiſely left <note place="margin">A.

If we may credit the aſſertion of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine himſelf, he had been an indignant ſpectator of the ſavage cruelties which were inflicted, by the hands of Roman ſoldiers, on thoſe citizens whoſe religion was their only crime <note n="13" place="bottom">Conſtantin.

The ſon of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius immediately ſuſpended or repealed the edicts of perſecution, and granted the free exerciſe of their religious ceremonies to all thoſe who had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready profeſſed themſelves members of the church.

            <p>About five months after the conqueſt of Italy, <note place="margin">A.

<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0034700103:252"/>
The wiſdom of the emperors provided for the reſtitution of all the civil and religious rights of which the Chriſtians had been ſo unjuſtly deprived. It was enacted, that the places of worſhip, and public lands, which had been confiſcated, ſhould be reſtored to the church, without diſpute, without delay, and without expence: and this ſevere in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction was accompanied with a gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, that if any of the purchaſers had paid a fair and adequate price, they ſhould be indemnified from the Imperial treaſury. The ſalutary regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations which guard the future tranquillity of the faithful, are framed on the principles of enlarged and equal toleration; and ſuch an equality muſt have been interpreted by a recent ſect as an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous and honourable diſtinction. The two emperors proclaim to the world, that they have granted a free and abſolute power to the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and to all others, of following the religion which each individual thinks proper to prefer, to which he has addicted his mind, and which he may deem the beſt adapted to his own uſe. They carefully explain every ambiguous word, remove every exception, and exact from the governors of the provinces a ſtrict obedience to the true and ſimple meaning of an edict, which was deſigned to eſtabliſh and ſecure, without any limitation, the claims of religious liberty. They condeſcend to aſſign two weighty reaſons which have induced them to allow this univerſal toleration: the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane intention of conſulting the peace and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0034700103:253"/>

They gratefully acknowledge the many ſignal proofs which they have received of the divine favour; and they truſt that the ſame Providence will for ever continue to protect the proſperity of the prince and people. From theſe vague and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite expreſſions of piety, three ſuppoſitions may be deduced, of a different, but not of an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible, nature. The mind of Conſtantine might fluctuate between the Pagan and the Chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions. According to the looſe and complying notions of polytheiſm, he might acknowledge the God of the Chriſtians as <hi>one</hi> of the <hi>many</hi> deities who compoſed the hierarchy of heaven. Or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he might embrace the philoſophic and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing idea, that, notwithſtanding the variety of names, of rites, and of opinions, all the ſects and all the nations of mankind are united in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the common Father and Creator of the univerſe <note n="16" place="bottom">A panegyric of Conſtantine, pronounced ſeven or eight months after the edict of Milan (ſee Gothofred.

The partial and increaſing favour of Conſtantine
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:0034700103:254"/>
may naturally be referred to the eſteem which he entertained for the moral character of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; and to a perſuaſion, that the propagation of the goſpel would inculcate the practice of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and public virtue. Whatever latitude an abſolute monarch may aſſume in his own conduct, whatever indulgence he may claim for his own paſſions, it is undoubtedly his intereſt that all his ſubjects ſhould reſpect the natural and civil obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſociety. But the operation of the wiſeſt laws is imperfect and precarious. They ſeldom inſpire virtue, they cannot always reſtrain vice. Their power is inſufficient to prohibit all that they condemn, nor can they always puniſh the actions which they prohibit. The legiſlators of antiquity had ſummoned to their aid the powers of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of opinion. But every principle which had once maintained the vigour and purity of Rome and Sparta, was long ſince extinguiſhed in a declining and deſpotic empire. Philoſophy ſtill exerciſed her temperate ſway over the human mind, but the cauſe of virtue derived very feeble ſupport from the influence of the Pagan ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Under theſe diſcouraging circumſtances, a prudent magiſtrate might obſerve with pleaſure the progreſs of a religion which diffuſed among the people a pure, benevolent, and univerſal ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of ethics, adapted to every duty and every condition of life; recommended as the will and reaſon of the Supreme Deity, and enforced by the ſanction of eternal rewards or puniſhments. The experience of Greek and Roman hiſtory could not inform the world how far the ſyſtem of national

manners might be reformed and improved by the precepts of a divine revelation; and Conſtantine might liſten with ſome confidence to the flattering, and indeed reaſonable, aſſurances of Lactantius. The eloquent apologiſt ſeemed firmly to expect, and almoſt ventured to promiſe, <hi>that</hi> the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of Chriſtianity would reſtore the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence and felicity of the primitive age; <hi>that</hi> the worſhip of the true God would extinguiſh war and diſſenſion among thoſe who mutually conſidered themſelves as the children of a common parent; <hi>that</hi> every impure deſire, every angry or ſelfiſh paſſion, would be reſtrained by the knowledge of the goſpel; and <hi>that</hi> the magiſtrates might ſheath the ſword of juſtice among a people who would be univerſally actuated by the ſentiments of truth and piety, of equity and moderation, of harmony and univerſal love <note n="17" place="bottom">See the elegant deſcription of Lactantius (Divin.

The primitive Chriſtians derived the inſtitution of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, not from the conſent of the people, but from the decrees of heaven.

To the Deity alone he was accountable for the abuſe of his power; and his ſubjects were indiſſolubly bound, by their oath of fidelity, to a tyrant, who had violated every law of nature and ſociety. The humble Chriſtians were ſent into the world as ſheep among wolves; and ſince they were not permitted to employ force, even in the defence of their religion, they ſhould be ſtill more criminal if they were tempted to ſhed the blood of their fellow-creatures, in diſputing the vain privileges, or the ſordid poſſeſſions, of this tranſitory life. Faithful to the doctrine of the apoſtle, who in the reign of Nero had preached the duty of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conditional ſubmiſſion, the Chriſtians of the three firſt centuries preſerved their conſcience pure and innocent of the guilt of ſecret conſpiracy, or open rebellion.

Perhaps the patience of the primitive church may be aſcribed to its weakneſs, as well as to its virtue. A ſect of unwarlike ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beians, without leaders, without arms, without fortifications, muſt have encountered inevitable deſtruction in a raſh and fruitleſs reſiſtance to the maſter of the Roman legions. But the Chriſtians, when they deprecated the wrath of Diocletian, or ſolicited the favour of Conſtantine, could allege, with truth and confidence, that they held the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of paſſive obedience, and that, in the ſpace of three centuries, their conduct had always been conformable to their principles. They might add, that the throne of the emperors would be eſtabliſhed on a fixed and permanent baſis, if all their ſubjects embracing the Chriſtian doctrine, ſhould learn to ſuffer and to obey.</p>

examples of the more immediate interpoſition of the Deity in the government of his choſen people. The ſceptre and the ſword were committed to the hands of Moſes, of Joſhua, of Gideon, of David, of the Maccabees; the virtues of thoſe heroes were the motive or the effect of the Divine favour, the ſucceſs of their arms was deſtined to atchieve the deliverance or the triumph of the church. If the judges of Iſrael were occaſional and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary magiſtrates, the kings of Judah derived from the royal unction of their great anceſtor, an hereditary and indefeaſible right, which could not be forfeited by their own vices, nor recalled by the caprice of their ſubjects. The ſame extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary providence, which was no longer confined to the Jewiſh people, might elect Conſtantine and his family as the protectors of the Chriſtian world; and the devout Lactantius announces, in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic tone, the future glories of his long and univerſal reign <note n="22" place="bottom">Lactant.

The tragic deaths of Galerius and Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min ſoon gratified the reſentment, and fulfilled the ſanguine expectations, of the Chriſtians. The ſucceſs of Conſtantine againſt Maxentius and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinius, removed the two formidable competitors who ſtill oppoſed the triumph of the ſecond David, and his cauſe might ſeem to claim the peculiar interpoſition of Providence.

of the Roman tyrant diſgraced the purple and human nature; and though the Chriſtians might enjoy his precarious favour, they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, with the reſt of his ſubjects, to the effects of his wanton and capricious cruelty. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Licinius ſoon betrayed the reluctance with which he had conſented to the wiſe and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane regulations of the edict of Milan. The convocation of provincial ſynods was prohibited in his dominions; his Chriſtian officers were ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominiouſly diſmiſſed; and if he avoided the guilt, or rather danger, of a general perſecution, his partial oppreſſions were rendered ſtill more odious, by the violation of a ſolemn and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary engagement <note n="23" place="bottom">Our imperfect knowledge of the perſecution of Licinius is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from Euſebius (Hiſt. Eccleſ. l. x. c. 8. Vit. Conſtantin. l. i. c. 49—56. l. ii. c. 1, 2.). Aurelius Victor mentions his cruelty in general terms.</note>. While the Eaſt, according to the lively expreſſion of Euſebius, was involved in the ſhades of infernal darkneſs, the auſpicious rays of celeſtial light warmed and illuminated the provinces of the Weſt. The piety of Conſtantine was admitted as an unexceptionable proof of the juſtice of his arms; and his uſe of victory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed the opinion of the Chriſtians, that their hero was inſpired, and conducted, by the Lord of Hoſts. The conqueſt of Italy produced a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral edict of toleration: and as ſoon as the defeat of Licinius had inveſted Conſtantine with the ſole dominion of the Roman world, he immediately, <note place="margin">A. D. 324.</note> by circular letters, exhorted all his ſubjects to imitate, without delay, the example of their ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,

            <p>The aſſurance that the elevation of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine <note place="margin">Loyalty and zeal of the Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian party.</note> was intimately connected with the deſigns of Providence, inſtilled into the minds of the Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians two opinions, which, by very different means, aſſiſted the accompliſhment of the prophecy. Their warm and active loyalty exhauſted in his favour every reſource of human induſtry; and they confidently expected that their ſtrenuous ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts would be ſeconded by ſome divine and mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous aid. The enemies of Conſtantine have imputed to intereſted motives the alliance which he inſenſibly contracted with the Catholic church, and which apparently contributes to the ſucceſs of his ambition. In the beginning of the fourth century, the Chriſtians ſtill bore a very inadequate proportion to the inhabitants of the empire; but among a degenerate people, who viewed the change of maſters with the indifference of ſlaves, the ſpirit and union of a religious party might aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the popular leader, to whoſe ſervice, from a principle of conſcience, they had devoted their lives and fortunes <note n="25" place="bottom">In the beginning of the laſt century, the Papiſts of England were only a <hi>thirtieth,</hi> and the Proteſtants of France only a <hi>fifteenth</hi> part of the reſpective nations, to whom their ſpirit and power were a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant object of apprehenſion. See the relations which Bentivoglio (who was then nuncio at Bruſſels, and afterwards cardinal) tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the court of Rome (Relazione, tom. ii. p. 211. 241.).

of public offices, he had the advantage of ſtrengthening his government, by the choice of miniſters or generals, in whoſe fidelity he could repoſe a juſt and unreſerved confidence. By the influence of theſe dignified miſſionaries, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelytes of the new faith muſt have multiplied in the court and army; the Barbarians of Germany, who filled the ranks of the legions, were of a care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs temper, which acquieſced without reſiſtance in the religion of their commander; and when they paſſed the Alps, it may fairly be preſumed, that a great number of the ſoldiers had already conſecrated their ſwords to the ſervice of Chriſt and of Conſtantine <note n="26" place="bottom">This careleſs temper of the Germans appears almoſt uniformly in the hiſtory of the converſion of each of the tribes. The legions of Conſtantine were recruited with Germans (Zoſimus, l. ii. p. 86.); and the court even of his father had been filled with Chriſtians. See the firſt book of the Life of Conſtantine, by Euſebius.</note>. The habits of mankind, and the intereſt of religion, gradually abated the horror of war and bloodſhed, which had ſo long prevailed among the Chriſtians; and in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils which were aſſembled under the gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of Conſtantine, the authority of the biſhops was ſeaſonably employed to ratify the obligation of the military oath, and to inflict the penalty of excommunication on thoſe ſoldiers who threw away their arms during the peace of the church <note n="27" place="bottom">De his qui arma projiciunt in <hi>pace,</hi> placuit eos abſtinere a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munione.

A ſecret diſaffection was diffuſed among the Chriſtian ſubjects of Maxentius and Licinius; and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment which the latter did not attempt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal, ſerved only to engage them ſtill more deeply in the intereſt of his competitor. The regular correſpondence which connected the biſhops of the moſt diſtant provinces, enabled them freely to communicate their wiſhes and their deſigns, and to tranſmit without danger any uſeful intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, or any pious contributions, which might promote the ſervice of Conſtantine, who publicly declared that he had taken up arms for the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance of the church <note n="28" place="bottom">Euſebius always conſiders the ſecond civil war againſt Licinius as a ſort of religious cruſade.

The authority of the church might alone have had ſufficient weight to juſtify the devotion of Conſtantine, who in the ſame prudent and gradual progreſs acknowledged the truth, and aſſumed the ſymbol, of Chriſtianity.

Three arguments from the title of the book, and from the names of Donatus and Caecilius, are produced by the advocates for Lactantius (See the P. Leſtocq, tom. ii. p. 46—60.).

was regularly adminiſtered by the biſhop himſelf, with his aſſiſtant clergy, in the cathedral church of the dioceſe, during the fifty days between the ſolemn feſtivals of Eaſter and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt; and this holy term admitted a numerous band of infants and adult perſons into the boſom of the church. The diſcretion of parents often ſuſpended the baptiſm of their children till they could underſtand the obligations which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted: the ſeverity of ancient biſhops exacted from the new converts a noviciate of two or three years; and the catechumens themſelves, from different motives of a temporal or a ſpiritual na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, were ſeldom impatient to aſſume the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of perfect and initiated Chriſtians. The ſacrament of baptiſm was ſuppoſed to contain a full and abſolute expiation of ſin; and the ſoul was inſtantly reſtored to its original purity, and entitled to the promiſe of eternal ſalvation. Among the proſelytes of Chriſtianity, there were many who judged it imprudent to precipitate a ſalutary rite, which could not be repeated; to throw away an ineſtimable privilege, which could never be recovered. By the delay of their baptiſm, they could venture freely to indulge their paſſions in

the enjoyment of this world, while they ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in their own hands the means of a ſure and eaſy abſolution <note n="68" place="bottom">The fathers, who cenſured this criminal delay, could not deny the certain and victorious efficacy, even of a death-bed baptiſm. The ingenious rhetoric of Chryſoſtom could find only three arguments againſt theſe prudent Chriſtians. 1. That we ſhould love and purſue virtue for her own ſake, and not merely for the reward. 2. That we may be ſurpriſed by death without an opportunity of baptiſm. 3. That although we ſhall be placed in heaven, we ſhall only twinkle like little ſtars, when compared to the ſuns of righteouſneſs who have run their appointed courſe with labour, with ſucceſs, and with glory. Chryſoſtom in Epiſt. ad Hebraeos, Homil. xiii. apud Chardon, Hiſt. des Sacremens, tom. i. p. 49. I believe that this delay of baptiſm, though attended with the moſt pernicious conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, was never condemned by any general or provincial council or by any public act or declaration of the church. The zeal of the biſhops was eaſily kindled on much ſlighter occaſions.</note>. The ſublime theory of the goſpel had made a much fainter impreſſion on the heart than on the underſtanding of Conſtantine himſelf. He purſued the great object of his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition through the dark and bloody paths of war and policy; and, after the victory, he abandoned himſelf, without moderation, to the abuſe of his fortune. Inſtead of aſſerting his juſt ſuperiority above the imperfect heroiſm and prophane phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy of Trajan and the Antonines, the mature age of Conſtantine forfeited the reputation which he had acquired in his youth. As he gradually advanced in the knowledge of truth, he propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably declined in the practice of virtue; and the ſame year of his reign in which he convened the council of Nice, was polluted by the execution, or rather murder, of his eldeſt ſon.

But the epiſcopal chair was ſolicited, eſpecially in the great and opulent cities of the empire, as a temporal, rather than as a ſpiritual dignity.

The canons of ancient diſcipline, by requiring ſeveral epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal qualifications of age, ſtation, &amp;c. reſtrained in ſome meaſure the indiſcriminate caprice of the electors. The authority of the provincial biſhops, who were aſſembled in the vacant church to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the choice of the people, was interpoſed to moderate their paſſions, and to correct their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes.

The diſcipline of the Weſt was indeed leſs relaxed than that of the Eaſt; but the ſame paſſions which made thoſe regulations neceſſary, rendered them ineffectual.

The converſion of the magiſtrates themſelves, and of the whole empire, might gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually remove the fears and ſcruples of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians.

But they ſtill reſorted to the tribunal of the biſhops, whoſe abilities and integrity they eſteemed; and the venerable Auſtin enjoyed the ſatisfaction of complaining that his ſpiritual func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were perpetually interrupted by the invidious labour of deciding the claim or the poſſeſſion of ſilver and gold, of lands and cattle. 4. The ancient privilege of ſanctuary was transferred to the Chriſtian temples, and extended, by the liberal piety of the younger Theodoſius, to the precincts of conſecrated ground <note n="113" place="bottom">See Cod.

The preachers recommended the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the ſocial duties; but they exalted the perfection of monaſtic virtue, which is painful to the individual, and uſeleſs to mankind. Their charitable exhortations betrayed a ſecret wiſh, that the clergy might be permitted to manage the wealth of the faithful, for the benefit of the poor. The moſt ſublime repreſentations of the attributes and laws of the Deity were ſullied by an idle mixture of metaphyſical ſubtleties, puerile rites, and fictitious miracles: and they expatiated, with the moſt fervent zeal, on the religious merit of hating the adverſaries, and obeying the miniſters, of the church. When the public peace was diſtracted by hereſy and ſchiſm, the ſacred orators ſounded the trumpet, of diſcord, and perhaps of ſedition.

The primates of Rome, Alexandria, Antioch, Carthage, and afterwards Conſtantinople, who exerciſed a more ample juriſdiction, convened the numerous aſſembly of their dependent biſhops.

            <p>THE grateful applauſe of the clergy has conſecrated the memory of a prince who indulged their paſſions and promoted their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. Conſtantine gave them ſecurity, wealth, honours, and revenge: and the ſupport of the orthodox faith was conſidered as the moſt ſacred and important duty of the civil magiſtrate. The edict of Milan, the great charter of toleration, had confirmed to each individual of the Roman world, the privilege of chuſing and profeſſing his own religion. But this ineſtimable privilege was ſoon violated: with the knowledge of truth, the emperor imbibed the maxims of perſecution; and the ſects which diſſented from the Catholic church, were afflicted and oppreſſed by the triumph of Chriſtianity. Conſtantine eaſily believed that the Heretics, who preſumed to diſpute <hi>his</hi> opinions, or to oppoſe <hi>his</hi> commands, were guilty of the moſt abſurd and criminal obſtinacy; and that a ſeaſonable application of moderate ſeverities might ſave thoſe unhappy men from the danger of an everlaſting condemnation. Not a moment was loſt in excluding the miniſters and teachers of the ſeparated congregations from any ſhare of the rewards and immunities which the emperor had
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0034700103:314"/>
ſo liberally beſtowed on the orthodox clergy. But as the ſectaries might ſtill exiſt under the cloud of royal diſgrace, the conqueſt of the Eaſt was immediately followed by an edict which announced their total deſtruction <note n="1" place="bottom">Euſebius in Vit. Conſtantin. l. iii. c. 63, 64, 65, 66.</note>. After a preamble filled with paſſion and reproach, Conſtantine abſolutely prohibits the aſſemblies of the Heretics, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſcates their public property to the uſe either of the revenue or of the Catholic church. The ſects againſt whom the Imperial ſeverity was directed, appear to have been the adherents of Paul of Samoſata; the Montaniſts of Phrygia, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an enthuſiaſtic ſucceſſion of prophecy; the Novatians, who ſternly rejected the temporal efficacy of repentance; the Marcionites and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinians, under whoſe leading banners the various Gnoſtics of Aſia and Egypt had inſenſibly rallied; and perhaps the Manichaeans, who had recently imported from Perſia a more artful compoſition of Oriental and Chriſtian theology <note n="2" place="bottom">After ſome examination of the various opinions of Tillemont, Beauſobre, Lardner, &amp;c. I am convinced that Manes did not propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate his ſect, even in Perſia, before the year 270. It is ſtrange, that a philoſophic and foreign hereſy ſhould have penetrated ſo rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the African provinces; yet I cannot eaſily reject the edict of Diocletian againſt the Manichaeans, which may be found in Baronius. (Annal. Eccl. A. D. 287.)</note>. The deſign of extirpating the name, or at leaſt of reſtraining the progreſs of theſe odious Heretics, was proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted with vigour and effect. Some of the penal regulations were copied from the edicts of Diocle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; and this method of converſion was applauded
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0034700103:315"/>
by the ſame biſhops who had felt the hand of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and had pleaded for the rights of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Two immaterial circumſtances may ſerve, however, to prove that the mind of Conſtantine was not entirely corrupted by the ſpirit of zeal and bigotry. Before he condemned the Mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaeans and their kindred ſects, he reſolved to make an accurate enquiry into the nature of their religious principles. As if he diſtruſted the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partiality of his eccleſiaſtical counſellors, this delicate commiſſion was entruſted to a civil magiſtrate; whoſe learning and moderation he juſtly eſteemed; and of whoſe venal character he was probably ignorant <note n="3" place="bottom">Conſtantinus, enim cum limatius ſuperſtitionum quaereret ſectas, Manichaeorum et ſimilium, &amp;c.

The inflexible zeal of freedom and fanaticiſm ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated the Donatiſts to refuſe obedience to the uſurpers, whoſe election they diſputed, and whoſe ſpiritual powers they denied. Excluded from the civil and religious communion of mankind,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0034700103:319"/>
they boldly excommunicated the reſt of mankind, who had embraced the impious party of Caecilian, and of the Traditors, from whom he derived his pretended ordination. They aſſerted with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence, and almoſt with exultation, that the Apoſtolical ſucceſſion was interrupted; that <hi>all</hi> the biſhops of Europe and Aſia were infected by the contagion of guilt and ſchiſm; and that the prerogatives of the Catholic church were confined to the choſen portion of the African believers, who alone had preſerved inviolate the integrity of their faith and diſcipline. This rigid theory was ſupported by the moſt uncharitable conduct.

A fourth part of the Donatiſt biſhops followed the independent ſtandard of the Maximianiſts. The narrow and ſolitary path which their firſt leaders had marked out, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to deviate from the great ſociety of mankind.

But as ſoon as we preſume to reaſon of infinite ſubſtance, of ſpiritual generation; as often as we deduce any poſitive concluſions from a negative idea, we are involved in darkneſs, perplexity, and inevitable contradiction. As theſe difficulties ariſe from the nature of the ſubject, they oppreſs, with the ſame inſuperable weight, the philoſophic and the theological diſputant; but we may obſerve two eſſential and peculiar circumſtances, which diſcriminated the doctrines of the Catholic church from the opinions of the Platonic ſchool.</p>

            <p n="2">II. The devotion of individuals was the firſt <note place="margin">Authority of the church.</note> circumſtance which diſtinguiſhed the Chriſtians from the Platoniſts: the ſecond was the authority of the church. The diſciples of philoſophy aſſerted the rights of intellectual freedom, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect for the ſentiments of their teachers was a liberal and voluntary tribute, which they offered to ſuperior reaſon. But the Chriſtians formed a numerous and diſciplined ſociety; and the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of their laws and magiſtrates was ſtrictly exerciſed over the minds of the faithful. The looſe wanderings of the imagination were gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually confined by creeds and confeſſions <note n="40" place="bottom">The moſt ancient creeds were drawn up with the greateſt lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. See Bull (Judicium Eccleſ.

But in an age of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious controverſy, every act of oppreſſion adds new force to the elaſtic vigour of the mind; and the zeal or obſtinacy of a ſpiritual rebel was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtimulated by ſecret motives of ambition or
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:0034700103:334"/>
avarice. A metaphyſical argument became the cauſe or pretence of political conteſts; the ſubtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Platonic ſchool were uſed as the badges <note place="margin">Factions.</note> of popular factions, and the diſtance which ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated their reſpective tenets was enlarged or mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified by the acrimony of diſpute. As long as the dark hereſies of Praxeas and Sabellius laboured to confound the <hi>Father</hi> with the <hi>Son</hi> 
               <note n="41" place="bottom">The hereſies of Praxeas, Sabellius, &amp;c. are accurately explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Moſheim (p. 425. 680—714.). Praxeas, who came to Rome about the end of the ſecond century, deceived, for ſome time, the ſimplicity of the biſhop, and was confuted by the pen of the angry Tertullian.</note>, the orthodox party might be excuſed if they adhered more ſtrictly and more earneſtly to the <hi>diſtinction,</hi> than to the <hi>equality</hi> of the divine perſons. But as ſoon as the heat of controverſy had ſubſided, and the progreſs of the Sabellians was no longer an object of terror to the churches of Rome, of Africa, or of Egypt; the tide of theological opinion began to flow with a gentle but ſteady motion toward the contrary extreme; and the moſt orthodox doctors allowed themſelves the uſe of the terms and defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitions which had been cenſured in the mouth of the ſectaries <note n="42" place="bottom">Socrates acknowledges, that the hereſy of Arius proceeded from his ſtrong deſire to embrace an opinion the moſt diametrically oppoſite to that of Sabellius.</note>. After the edict of toleration had reſtored peace and leiſure to the Chriſtians, the Trinitarian controverſy was revived in the ancient ſeat of Platoniſm, the learned, the opulent, the tumultuous city of Alexandria; and the flame of religious diſcord was rapidly communicated from the ſchools, to the clergy, the people, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince,

His com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petitor Alexander aſſumed the office of his judge. The important cauſe was argued before him; and if at firſt he ſeemed to heſitate, he at length pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced his final ſentence, as an abſolute rule of faith <note n="45" place="bottom">Sozomen (l. i. c. 15.) repreſents Alexander as indifferent, and even ignorant, in the beginning of the controverſy; while So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates (l. i. c. 5.) aſcribes the origin of the diſpute to the vain curioſity of his theological ſpeculations.

But as thoſe oppoſite extremes ſeemed to overthrow the foundations either of natural, or revealed, religion, they mutually agreed to qualify the rigour of their principles: and to diſavow the juſt, but invidious, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, which might be urged by their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts. The intereſt of the common cauſe inclined them to join their numbers, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their differences; their animoſity was ſoftened by the healing counſels of toleration, and their diſputes were ſuſpended by the uſe of the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>Homoouſion,</hi> which either party was free to interpret according to their peculiar tenets.

But the more faſhionable ſaints of the Arian times, the intrepid Athanaſius, the learned Gregory Nazianzen, and the other pillars of the church, who ſupported with ability and ſucceſs the Nicene doctrine, appeared to conſider the expreſſion of <hi>ſubſtance,</hi> as if it had been ſynonimous with that of <hi>nature;</hi> and they ventured to illuſtrate their meaning, by affirming that three men, as they belong to the ſame com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſpecies, are conſubſtantial or homoouſian to each other <note n="58" place="bottom">According to Ariſtotle, the ſtars were Homoouſian to each other. <q>That <hi>Homoouſius</hi> means of one ſubſtance in <hi>kind,</hi> hath been ſhewn by Petavius, Curcellaeus, Cudworth, Le Clerc, &amp;c. and to prove it, would be <hi>actum agere.</hi>

We repent of what we have done, we defend thoſe who repent, we anathematiſe thoſe whom we defended.

            <p>It will not be expected, it would not perhaps <note place="margin">Arian ſects.</note> be endured, that I ſhould ſwell this theological digreſſion, by a minute examination of the eighteen creeds, the authors of which, for the moſt part, diſclaimed the odious name of their parent Arius. It is amuſing enough to delineate the form, and to trace the vegetation, of a ſingular plant; but
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:0034700103:346"/>
the tedious detail of leaves without flowers, and of branches without fruit, would ſoon exhauſt the patience, and diſappoint the curioſity, of the laborious ſtudent. One queſtion which gradually aroſe from the Arian controverſy, may however be noticed, as it ſerved to produce and diſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the three ſects, who were united only by their common averſion to the Homoouſion of the Nicene ſynod. 1. If they were aſked, whether the Son was <hi>like</hi> unto the Father; the queſtion was reſolutely anſwered in the negative, by the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics who adhered to the principles of Arius, or indeed to thoſe of philoſophy; which ſeem to eſtabliſh an infinite difference between the Creator and the moſt excellent of his creatures. This obvious conſequence was maintained by Aetius <note n="67" place="bottom">In Philoſtorgius (l. iii. c. 15.) the character and adventures of Aetius appear ſingular enough, though they are carefully ſoftened by the hand of a friend. The editor Godefroy (p. 153.), who was more attached to his principles than to his author, has collected the odious circumſtances which his various adverſaries have preſerved or invented.</note>, on whom the zeal of his adverſaries beſtowed the ſurname of the Atheiſt. His reſtleſs and aſpiring ſpirit urged him to try almoſt every profeſſion of human life. He was ſucceſſively a ſlave, or at leaſt a huſbandman, a travelling tinker, a gold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſmith, a phyſician, a ſchoolmaſter, a theologian, and at laſt the apoſtle of a new church, which was propagated by the abilities of his diſciple Euno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius <note n="68" place="bottom">According to the judgment of a man who reſpected both thoſe ſectaries, Aetius had been endowed with a ſtronger underſtanding, and Eunomius had acquired more art and learning (Philoſtorgius, l. viii. c. 18.). The confeſſion and apology of Eunomius (Fabricius, Bibliot. Graec. tom. viii. p. 258—305.) is one of the few heretical pieces which have eſcaped.</note>. Armed with texts of ſcripture, and with
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0034700103:347"/>
captious ſyllogiſms from the logic of Ariſtotle, the ſubtle Aetius had acquired the fame of an invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible diſputant, whom it was impoſſible either to ſilence or to convince. Such talents engaged the friendſhip of the Arian biſhops, till they were forced to renounce, and even to perſecute, a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous ally, who, by the accuracy of his reaſoning, had prejudiced their cauſe in the popular opinion, and offended the piety of their moſt devoted fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. 2. The omnipotence of the Creator ſuggeſted a ſpecious and reſpectful ſolution of the <hi>likeneſs</hi> of the Father and the Son; and faith might humbly receive what reaſon could not preſume to deny, that the Supreme God might communicate his infinite perfections, and create a being ſimilar only to himſelf <note n="69" place="bottom">Yet, according to the opinion of Eſtius and Bull (p. 297.), there is one power, that of creation, which God <hi>cannot</hi> communicate to a creature. Eſtius, who ſo accurately defined the limits of Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potence, was a Dutchman by birth, and by trade a ſcholaſtic divine. Dupin, Bibliot. Eccleſ. tom. xvii. p. 45.</note>. Theſe Arians were powerfully ſupported by the weight and abilities of their leaders, who had ſucceeded to the management of the Euſebian intereſt, and who occupied the principal thrones of the Eaſt. They deteſted, perhaps with ſome affectation, the impiety of Aetius; they profeſſed to believe, either without reſerve, or according to the ſcriptures, that the Son was different from all <hi>other</hi> creatures, and ſimilar only to the Father. But they denied, that

he was either of the ſame, or of a ſimilar ſubſtance; ſometimes boldly juſtifying their diſſent, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times objecting to the uſe of the word ſubſtance, which ſeems to imply an adequate, or at leaſt a diſtinct, notion of the nature of the Deity. 3. The ſect which aſſerted the doctrine of a ſimilar ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, was the moſt numerous, at leaſt in the provinces of Aſia; and when the leaders of both parties were aſſembled in the council of Seleucia <note n="70" place="bottom">Sabinus (ap. Socrat. l. ii. c. 39.) had copied the acts; Atha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſius and Hilary have explained the diviſions of this Arian ſynod; the other circumſtances which are relative to it are carefully collected by Baronius and Tillemont.</note>, <hi>their</hi> opinion would have prevailed by a majority of one hundred and five to forty-three biſhops. The Greek word, which was choſen to expreſs this myſterious reſemblance, bears ſo cloſe an affinity to the orthodox ſymbol, that the profane of every age have derided the furious conteſts which the difference of a ſingle diphthong excited between the Homoouſians and the Homoiouſians. As it frequently happens, that the ſounds and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters which approach the neareſt to each other, accidentally repreſent the moſt oppoſite ideas, the obſervation would be itſelf ridiculous, if it were poſſible to mark any real and ſenſible diſtinction between the doctrine of the Semi-Arians, as they were improperly ſtyled, and that of the Catholics themſelves. The biſhop of Poitiers, who in his Phrygian exile very wiſely aimed at a coalition of parties, endeavours to prove that, by a pious and faithful interpretation <note n="71" place="bottom">Fideli et piâ intelligentiâ...De Synod. c. 77. p. 1193.

The inhabitants of the Weſt were of a leſs inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive ſpirit; their paſſions were not ſo forcibly moved by inviſible objects; their minds were leſs frequently exerciſed by the habits of diſpute; and ſuch was the happy ignorance of the Gallican church, that Hilary himſelf, above thirty years after the firſt general council, was ſtill a ſtranger to the Nicene creed <note n="72" place="bottom">Teſtor Deum coeli atque terrae mecum neutrum audiſſem, ſemper tamen utrumque ſenſiſſe. . . .

and of diſcipline; and the minority was conducted by Valens and Urſacius, two biſhops of Illyricum, who had ſpent their lives in the intrigues of courts and councils, and who had been trained under the Euſebian banner, in the religious wars of the Eaſt. By their arguments and negociations, they embarraſſed, they confounded, they at laſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, the honeſt ſimplicity of the Latin biſhops; who ſuffered the palladium of the faith to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from their hands by fraud and importunity, rather than by open violence.

The deſtructive earthquake of Nicomedia, the difficulty of finding a convenient place, and perhaps ſome ſecret mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of policy, produced an alteration in the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.

Taurus, the Praetorian praefect, was inſtructed not to diſmiſs the prelates till they ſhould all be united in the ſame opinion; and his efforts were ſupported by a power of baniſhing fifteen of the moſt refractory, and a promiſe of the conſulſhip if he atchieved ſo difficult an adventure.

Athanaſius had openly diſapproved that ignominious peace, and the emperor was diſpoſed to believe, that he had abuſed his eccleſiaſtical and civil power, to perſecute thoſe odious ſectaries; that he had ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiouſly broken a chalice in one of their churches of Maraeotis: that he had whipped or impriſoned ſix of their biſhops; and that Arſenius, a ſeventh biſhop of the ſame party, had been murdered, or at leaſt mutilated, by the cruel hand of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate <note n="103" place="bottom">The treatment of the ſix biſhops is ſpecified by Sozomen (l. ii. c. 25.); but Athanaſius himſelf, ſo copious on the ſubject of Arſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and the chalice, leaves this grave accuſation without a reply.</note>.

Theſe charges, which affected his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and his life, were referred by Conſtantine to his brother Dalmatius the Cenſor, who reſided at Antioch; the ſynods of Caeſarea and Tyre were ſucceſſively convened; and the biſhops of the Eaſt were inſtructed to judge the cauſe of Athanaſius, before they proceeded to conſecrate the new church of the Reſurrection at Jeruſalem. The primate might be conſcious of his innocence; but he was ſenſible, that the ſame implacable ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which had dictated the accuſation, would direct the proceeding, and pronounce the ſentence. He prudently declined the tribunal of his enemies, deſpiſed the ſummons of the ſynod of Caeſarea; and, after a long and artful delay, ſubmitted to the peremptory commands of the emperor, who threatened to puniſh his criminal diſobedience if he refuſed to appear in the council of Tyre <note n="104" place="bottom">Athanaſ. tom. i. p. 788.

The Arians, who had ſecretly determined the guilt and condemnation of their enemy, attempted, however, to diſguiſe their injuſtice by the imitation of judicial forms: the ſynod appointed an epiſcopal commiſſion of ſix delegates to collect evidence on the ſpot; and this meaſure, which was vigorouſly oppoſed by the Egyptian biſhops, opened new ſcenes of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and perjury <note n="105" place="bottom">See, in particular, the ſecond Apology of Athanaſius (tom. i. p. 763—808.), and his Epiſtles to the Monks (p. 808—866.).

They alleged, that his innocence had been atteſted by the unanimous biſhops of Egypt, and had been acknowledged in the councils of Rome and Sardica <note n="126" place="bottom">More properly by the orthodox part of the council of Sardica. If the biſhops of both parties had fairly voted, the diviſion would have been 94 to 76.

and extravagant accuſations. Their language was ſpecious; their conduct was honourable: but in this long and obſtinate conteſt, which fixed the eyes of the whole empire on a ſingle biſhop, the eccleſiaſtical factions were prepared to ſacrifice truth and juſtice, to the more intereſting object of defending, or removing, the intrepid champion of the Nicene faith. The Arians ſtill thought it prudent to diſguiſe in ambiguous language, their real ſentiments and deſigns: but the orthodox biſhops, armed with the favour of the people, and the decrees of a general council, inſiſted on every occaſion, and particularly at Milan, that their adverſaries ſhould purge themſelves from the ſuſpicion of hereſy, before they preſumed to arraign the conduct of the great Athanaſius <note n="127" place="bottom">Sulp.

A formulary of conſent was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the meſſengers of ſtate to the abſent biſhops: and all thoſe who refuſed to ſubmit their private opinion to the public and inſpired wiſdom of the councils of Arles and Milan, were
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0034700103:382"/>
immediately baniſhed by the emperor, who affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to execute the decrees of the Catholic church. Among thoſe prelates who led the honourable band of confeſſors and exiles, Liberius of Rome, Oſius of Cordova, Paulanus of Treves, Diony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius of Milan, Euſebius of Vercellae, Lucifer of Cagliari, and Hilary of Poitiers, may deſerve to be particularly diſtinguiſhed. The eminent ſtation of Liberius, who governed the capital of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; the perſonal merit and long experience of the venerable Oſius, who was revered as the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite of the great Conſtantine, and the father of the Nicene faith; placed thoſe prelates at the head of the Latin church: and their example, either of ſubmiſſion or reſiſtance, would probably be imitated by the epiſcopal crowd. But the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated attempts of the emperor to ſeduce or to intimidate the biſhops of Rome and Cordova, were for ſome time ineffectual. The Spaniard declared himſelf ready to ſuffer under Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, as he had ſuffered threeſcore years before under his grandfather Maximian. The Roman, in the preſence of his ſovereign, aſſerted the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence of Athanaſius, and his own freedom. When he was baniſhed to Beraea in Thrace, he ſent back a large ſum which had been offered for the accommodation of his journey; and inſulted the court of Milan by the haughty remark, that the emperor and his eunuchs might want that gold to pay their ſoldiers and their biſhops <note n="128" place="bottom">The exile of Liberius is mentioned by Ammianus, xv. 7.

The diſgrace and exile of the orthodox biſhops of the Weſt were deſigned as ſo many preparatory ſteps to the ruin of Athanaſius himſelf <note n="133" place="bottom">Ample materials for the hiſtory of this third perſecution of Athanaſius may be found in his own works. See particularly his very able Apology to Conſtantius (tom. i. p. 673.), his firſt Apology for his flight (p. 701.), his prolix Epiſtle to the Solitaries (p. 808.), and the original Proteſt of the People of Alexandria againſt the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences committed by Syrianus (p. 866.). Sozomen (l. iv. c. 9.) has thrown into the narrative two or three luminous and important circumſtances.</note>. Six <note place="margin">Third ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion of Athana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſius from Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</note> and twenty months had elapſed, during which the Imperial court ſecretly laboured, by the moſt inſidious arts, to remove him from Alexandria, and to withdraw the allowance which ſupplied his <note place="margin">A. D. 356.</note> popular liberality. But when the primate of of Egypt, deſerted and proſcribed by the Latin church, was left deſtitute of any foreign ſupport, Conſtantius diſpatched two of his ſecretaries with a verbal commiſſion to announce and execute the order of his baniſhment. As the juſtice of the ſentence was publicly avowed by the whole party, the only motive which could reſtrain Conſtantius from giving his meſſengers the ſanction of a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten mandate, muſt be imputed to his doubt of the event; and to a ſenſe of the danger to which he might expoſe the ſecond city, and the moſt fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile province of the empire, if the people ſhould perſiſt in the reſolution of defending, by force of arms, the innocence of their ſpiritual father. Such extreme caution afforded Athanaſius a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious pretence reſpectfully to diſpute the truth of an order, which he could not reconcile, either with the equity, or with the former declarations,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0034700103:386"/>
of his gracious maſter. The civil powers of Egypt found themſelves inadequate to the taſk of perſuading or compelling the primate to abdicate his epiſcopal throne; and they were obliged to conclude a treaty with the popular leaders of Alexandria, by which it was ſtipulated, that all proceedings and all hoſtilities ſhould be ſuſpended till the emperor's pleaſure had been more diſtinctly aſcertained. By this ſeeming moderation, the Catholics were deceived into a falſe and fatal ſecurity; while the legions of the Upper Egypt, and of Libya, advanced, by ſecret orders and haſty marches, to beſiege, or rather to ſurpriſe, a capital, habituated to ſedition, and inflamed by religious zeal <note n="134" place="bottom">Athanaſius had lately ſent for Antony, and ſome of his choſen Monks. They deſcended from their mountain, announced to the Alexandrians the ſanctity of Athanaſius, and were honourably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted by the archbiſhop as far as the gates of the city. Athanaſ. tom. ii. p. 491, 492. See likewiſe Rufinus, iii. 164. in Vit. Patr. p. 524.</note>. The poſition of Alexandria, between the ſea and the lake Mareotis, facilitated the approach and landing of the troops; who were introduced into the heart of the city, before any effectual meaſures could be taken, either to ſhut the gates, or to occupy the important poſts of deſence. At the hour of midnight, twenty-three days after the ſignature of the treaty, Syri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anus duke of Egypt, at the head of five thouſand ſoldiers, armed and prepared for an aſſault, unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectedly inveſted the church of St. Theonas, where the archbiſhop, with a part of his clergy and people, performed their nocturnal devotions. The doors of the ſacred edifice yielded to the impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:0034700103:387"/>
of the attack, which was accompanied with every horrid circumſtance of tumult and blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed; but, as the bodies of the ſlain, and the fragments of military weapons, remained the next day an unexceptionable evidence in the poſſeſſion of the Catholics, the enterpriſe of Syrianus may be conſidered as a ſucceſsful irruption, rather than as an abſolute conqueſt. The other churches of the city were profaned by ſimilar outrages; and, during at leaſt four months, Alexandria was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the inſults of a licentious army, ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the eccleſiaſtics of an hoſtile faction. Many of the faithful were killed; who may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the name of martyrs, if their deaths were neither provoked nor revenged; biſhops and preſbyters were treated with cruel ignominy; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated virgins were ſtripped naked, ſcourged, and violated; the houſes of wealthy citizens were plundered; and, under the maſk of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious zeal, luſt, avarice, and private reſentment, were gratified with impunity, and even with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe. The Pagans of Alexandria, who ſtill formed a numerous and diſcontented party, were eaſily perſuaded to deſert a biſhop whom they feared and eſteemed. The hopes of ſome peculiar favours, and the apprehenſion of being involved in the general penalties of rebellion, engaged them to promiſe their ſupport to the deſtined ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor of Athanaſius, the famous George of Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>padocia. The uſurper, after receiving the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of an Arian ſynod, was placed on the epiſcopal throne by the arms of Sebaſtian, who had been appointed Count of Egypt for the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0034700103:388"/>
of that important deſign. In the uſe, as well as in the acquiſition, of power, the tyrant George diſregarded the laws of religion, of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and of humanity; and the ſame ſcenes of violence and ſcandal which had been exhibited in the capital, were repeated in more than ninety epiſcopal cities of Egypt. Encouraged by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, Conſtantius ventured to approve the conduct of his miniſters. By a public and paſſionate epiſtle, the emperor congratulates the deliverance of Alexandria from a popular tyrant, who deluded his blind votaries by the magic of his eloquence; expatiates on the virtues and piety of the moſt reverend George, the elected biſhop; and aſpires, as the patron and benefactor of the city, to ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs the fame of Alexander himſelf. But he ſolemnly declares his unalterable reſolution to purſue with fire and ſword the ſeditious adherents of the wicked Athanaſius, who, by flying from juſtice, has confeſſed his guilt, and eſcaped the ignominious death which he had ſo often de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved <note n="135" place="bottom">Athanaſ. tom. i. p. 694.

            <p>Athanaſius had indeed eſcaped from the moſt <note place="margin">His beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</note> imminent dangers; and the adventures of that extraordinary man deſerve and fix our attention. On the memorable night when the church of St. Theonas was inveſted by the troops of Syrianus, the archbiſhop, ſeated on his throne, expected, with calm and intrepid dignity, the approach of death. While the public devotion was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:0034700103:389"/>
by ſhouts of rage, and cries of terror, he animated his trembling congregation to expreſs their religious confidence, by chanting one of the pſalms of David, which celebrates the triumph of the God of Iſrael over the haughty and impious tyrant of Egypt. The doors were at length burſt open; a cloud of arrows was diſcharged among the people; the ſoldiers, with drawn ſwords, ruſhed forwards into the ſanctuary; and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful gleam of their armour was reflected by the holy luminaries which burnt round the altar <note n="136" place="bottom">Theſe minute circumſtances are curious, as they are literally tranſcribed from the proteſt, which was publicly preſented three days afterwards by the Catholics of Alexandria. See Athanaſ. tom. i. p. 867.</note>. Athanaſius ſtill rejected the pious importunity of the Monks and Preſbyters, who were attached to his perſon; and nobly refuſed to deſert his epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal ſtation, till he had diſmiſſed in ſafety the laſt of the congregation. The darkneſs and tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mult of the night favoured the retreat of the archbiſhop; and though he was oppreſſed by the waves of an agitated multitude, though he was thrown to the ground, and left without ſenſe or motion, he ſtill recovered his undaunted courage; and eluded the eager ſearch of the ſoldiers, who were inſtructed by their Arian guides, that the head of Athanaſius would be the moſt acceptable preſent to the emperor. From that moment the primate of Egypt diſappeared from the eyes of his enemies, and remained above ſix years concealed in impenetrable obſcurity <note n="137" place="bottom">The Janſeniſts have often compared Athanaſius and Arnauld, and have expatiated with pleaſure on the faith and zeal, the merit and exile, of thoſe celebrated doctors.

The deſpotic power of his implacable enemy filled the whole extent of the Roman world; and the exaſperated monarch had endeavoured, by a <note place="margin">His retreat,</note> very preſſing epiſtle to the Chriſtian princes of <note place="margin">A.

Counts, praefects, tribunes, whole armies, were ſucceſſively employed to purſue a biſhop and a fugitive; the vigilance of the civil and military powers were excited by the Imperial edicts; liberal rewards were promiſed to the man who ſhould produce Athanaſius, either alive or dead; and the moſt ſevere penalties were denounced againſt thoſe who ſhould dare to protect the public enemy <note n="138" place="bottom">Hinc jam toto orbe profugus Athanaſius, nec ullus ci tutus ad latendum ſuper-erat locus.

When their dark retreats were invaded by a military force, which it was impoſſible to reſiſt, they ſilently ſtretched out their necks to the executioner; and ſupported their national character, that tortures could never wreſt from an Egyptian the confeſſion of a ſecret which he was reſolved not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe <note n="140" place="bottom">Et nulla tormentorum vis inveniri adhuc potuit; quae ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durato illius tractûs latroni invito elicere potuit, ut nomen proprium dicat.

The archbiſhop of Alexandria, for whoſe ſafety they eagerly devoted their lives, was loſt among a uniform and well-diſciplined multitude; and on the nearer approach of danger, he was ſwiftly removed, by their officious hands, from one place of concealment to another, till he reached the formidable deſerts, which the gloomy and credulous temper of ſuperſtition had peopled with daemons and ſavage monſters. The retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Athanaſius, which ended only with the life of Conſtantius, was ſpent, for the moſt part, in the ſociety of the Monks, who faithfully ſerved him as guards, as ſecretaries, and as meſſengers;
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0034700103:392"/>
but the importance of maintaining a more inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate connection with the Catholic party, tempted him, whenever the diligence of the purſuit was abated, to emerge from the deſert, to introduce himſelf into Alexandria, and to truſt his perſon to the diſcretion of his friends and adherents. His various adventures might have furniſhed the ſubject of a very entertaining romance. He was once ſecreted in a dry ciſtern, which he had ſcarcely left before he was betrayed by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery of a female ſlave <note n="141" place="bottom">Rufin. l. i. c. 18.

Without imparting the ſecret to any one, ſhe inſtantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted Athanaſius into her moſt ſecret chamber, and watched over his ſafety with the tenderneſs of a friend and the aſſiduity of a ſervant.

By an edict of Conſtantius againſt the Catholics, which has not been judged worthy of a place in the Theodoſian code, thoſe who refuſed to communicate with the Arian biſhops, and particularly with Macedonius, were deprived of the immunities of eccleſiaſtics, and of the rights of Chriſtians; they were compelled to relinquiſh the poſſeſſion of the churches; and were ſtrictly prohibited from holding their aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies within the walls of the city.

The Donatiſts who were taken in arms, received, and they ſoon deſerved, the ſame treatment which might have been ſhewn to the wild beaſts of the deſert. The captives died, without a murmur, either by the ſword, the axe, or the fire; and the meaſures of retaliation were multiplied in a rapid proportion, which aggravated the horrors of rebellion, and excluded the hope of mutual forgiveneſs. In the beginning of the preſent century, the example of the Circumcellions has been renewed in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution, the boldneſs, the crimes, and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm of the Camiſards; and if the fanatics of Languedoc ſurpaſſed thoſe of Numidia, by their military atchievements, the Africans maintained their fierce independence with more reſolution and perſeverance <note n="159" place="bottom">The Hiſtoire des Camiſards, in 3 vol. 12mo. Villefranche, 1760, may be recommended as accurate and impartial. It requires ſome attention to diſcover the religion of the author.</note>.</p>
            <p>Such diſorders are the natural effects of religious tyranny; but the rage of the Donatiſts was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed <note place="margin">Their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious ſuicides.</note> by a frenzy of a very extraordinary kind;
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0034700103:409"/>
and which, if it really prevailed among them in ſo extravagant a degree, cannot ſurely be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leled in any country, or in any age. Many of theſe fanatics were poſſeſſed with the horror of life, and the deſire of martyrdom; and they deemed it of little moment by what means, or by what hands, they periſhed, if their conduct was ſanctified by the intention of devoting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the glory of the true faith, and the hope of eternal happineſs <note n="160" place="bottom">The Donatiſt ſuicides alleged in their juſtification the example of Razias, which is related in the 14th chapter of the ſecond book of the Maccabees.</note>. Sometimes they rudely diſturbed the feſtivals, and profaned the temples of paganiſm, with the deſign of exciting the moſt zealous of the idolaters to revenge the inſulted honour of their gods. They ſometimes forced their way into the courts of juſtice, and compelled the affrighted judge to give orders for their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate execution. They frequently ſtopped tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers on the public highways, and obliged them to inflict the ſtroke of martyrdom, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a reward, if they conſented, and by the threat of inſtant death, if they refuſed to grant ſo very ſingular a favour. When they were diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of every other reſource, they announced the day on which, in the preſence of their friends and brethren, they ſhould caſt themſelves head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long from ſome lofty rock; and many precipices were ſhewn, which had acquired fame by the number of religious ſuicides. In the actions of theſe deſperate enthuſiaſts, who were admired by one party as the martyrs of God, and abhorred by
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0034700103:410"/>
the other, as the victims of Satan, an impartial philoſopher may diſcover the influence and the laſt abuſe of that inflexible ſpirit, which was ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally derived from the character and principles of the Jewiſh nation.</p>
            <p>The ſimple narrative of the inteſtine diviſions, <note place="margin">General character of the Chriſtian ſects,</note> which diſtracted the peace, and diſhonoured the triumph, of the church, will confirm the remark of a pagan hiſtorian, and juſtify the complaint of a <note place="margin">A.

The experience of Ammianus had convinced him, that the enmity of the Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians towards each other, ſurpaſſed the fury of ſavage beaſts againſt man <note n="161" place="bottom">Nullas infeſtas hominibus beſtias, ut ſunt ſibi ferales plerique Chriſtianorum expertus.

Nazianzen, Orat. i. p. 33. See Tillemont, tom. vi. p. 501. quarto edit.</note>. The fierce and partial writers of the times, aſcribing <hi>all</hi> virtue to themſelves, and imputing <hi>all</hi> guilt to their adverſaries, have painted the battle of the angels and daemons. Our calmer reaſon will reject ſuch pure and perfect monſters of vice or ſanctity, and will impute an equal, or at leaſt an indiſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate, meaſure of good and evil to the hoſtile ſectaries, who aſſumed and beſtowed the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of orthodox and heretics. They had been educated in the ſame religion, and the ſame civil ſociety. Their hopes and fears in the preſent, or in a future, life, were balanced in the ſame pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion. On either ſide, the error might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent,
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0034700103:411"/>
the faith ſincere, the practice meritorious or corrupt. Their paſſions were excited by ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar objects; and they might alternately abuſe the favour of the court, or of the people. The meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical opinions of the Athanaſians and the Arians, could not influence their moral character; and they were alike actuated by the intolerant ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, which has been extracted from the pure and ſimple maxims of the goſpel.</p>
            <p>A modern writer, who, with a juſt confidence, <note place="margin">Toleration of pagan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</note> has prefixed to his own hiſtory the honourable epithets of political and philoſophical <note n="163" place="bottom">Hiſtoire Politique et Philoſophique des Etabliſſemens des Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropéens dans les deux Indes, tom. i. p. 9.</note>, accuſes the timid prudence of Monteſquieu, for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enumerate, among the cauſes of the decline of the empire, a law of Conſtantine, by which the exerciſe of the pagan worſhip was abſolutely ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and a conſiderable part of his ſubjects was left deſtitute of prieſts, of temples, and of any public religion. The zeal of the philoſophic hiſtorian for the rights of mankind, has induced him to acquieſce in the ambiguous teſtimony of thoſe eccleſiaſtics, who have too lightly aſcribed to their favourite hero the <hi>merit</hi> of a general per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution <note n="164" place="bottom">According to Euſebius (in Vit. Conſtantin. l. ii. c. 45.) the emperor prohibited, both in cities and in the country, <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>; the abominable acts or parts of idolatry. Socrates (l. i. c. 17.) and Sozomen (l. ii. c. 4, 5.) have repreſented the conduct of Conſtantine with a juſt regard to truth and hiſtory; which has been neglected by Theodoret (l. v. c. 21.) and Oroſius (vii. 28.). Tum deinde (ſays the latter) primus Conſtantinus <hi>juſto</hi> ordine et <hi>pio</hi> vicem vertit edicto; ſiquidem ſtatuit citra ullam homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num caedem, paganorum templa claudi.</note>. Inſtead of alleging this imaginary
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:0034700103:412"/>
law, which would have blazed in the front of the Imperial codes, we may ſafely appeal to the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal epiſtle, which Conſtantine addreſſed to the followers of the ancient religion; at a time when he no longer diſguiſed his converſion, nor dreaded the rivals of his throne. He invites and exhorts, in the moſt preſſing terms, the ſubjects of the Roman empire to imitate the example of their maſter; but he declares, that thoſe who ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe <note place="margin">by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine,</note> to open their eyes to the celeſtial light, may freely enjoy their temples, and their fancied gods. A report, that the ceremonies of paganiſm were ſuppreſſed, is formally contradicted by the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror himſelf, who wiſely aſſigns, as the principle of his moderation, the invincible force of habit, of prejudice, and of ſuperſtition <note n="165" place="bottom">See Euſebius in Vit. Conſtantin. l. ii. c. 56. 60. In the ſermon to the aſſembly of ſaints, which the emperor pronounced when he was mature in years and piety, he declares to the idolaters (c. xi.), that they are permitted to offer ſacrifices, and to exerciſe every part of their religious worſhip.</note>. Without violating the ſanctity of his promiſe, without alarming the fears of the pagans, the artful mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch advanced, by ſlow and cautious ſteps, to undermine the irregular and decayed fabric of polytheiſm. The partial acts of ſeverity which he occaſionally exerciſed, though they were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly prompted by a Chriſtian zeal, were colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the faireſt pretences of juſtice, and the public good; and while Conſtantine deſigned to ruin the foundations, he ſeemed to reform the abuſes, of the ancient religion. After the example
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0034700103:413"/>
of the wiſeſt of his predeceſſors, he condemned, under the moſt rigorous penalties, the occult and impious arts of divination; which excited the vain hopes, and ſometimes the criminal attempts, of thoſe who were diſcontented with their preſent condition. An ignominious ſilence was impoſed on the oracles, which had been publicly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of fraud and falſehood; the effeminate prieſts of the Nile were aboliſhed; and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine diſcharged the duties of a Roman cenſor, when he gave orders for the demolition of ſeveral temples of Phoenicia; in which every mode of proſtitution was devoutly practiſed in the face of day, and to the honour of Venus <note n="166" place="bottom">See Euſebius, in Vit. Conſtantin. l. iii. c. 54—58. and l. iv. c. 23. 25. Theſe acts of authority may be compared with the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Bacchanals, and the demolition of the temple of Iſis, by the magiſtrates of Pagan Rome.</note>. The Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perial city of Conſtantinople was, in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, raiſed at the expence, and was adorned with the ſpoils, of the opulent temples of Greece and Aſia; the ſacred property was confiſcated; the ſtatues of gods and heroes were tranſported, with rude familiarity, among a people who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered them as objects, not of adoration, but of curioſity: the gold and ſilver were reſtored to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation; and the magiſtrates, the biſhops, and the eunuchs, improved the fortunate occaſion of gratifying, at once, their zeal, their avarice, and their reſentment. But theſe depredations were confined to a ſmall part of the Roman world; and the provinces had been long ſince accuſtomed to

Libanius ſays (Orat. pro Templ. p. 23.), that the emperor often gave away a temple, like a dog, or a horſe, or a ſlave, or a gold cup; but the devout philoſopher takes care to obſerve, that theſe ſacrilegious favourites very ſeldom proſpered.</note>; every indulgence was ſhewn to the illegal behaviour of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians; every doubt was explained to the diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of paganiſm; and the demolition of the temples was celebrated as one of the auſpicious events of the reign of Conſtans and Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius <note n="169" place="bottom">See Gothofred.

Cod. Theodoſ. l. xvi. tit. x. leg. 4. Chronology has diſcovered ſome contradiction in the date of this extravagant law; the only one, perhaps, by which the negligence of magiſtrates is puniſhed by death and confiſcation. M. de la Baſtie (Mem. de l'Academie, tom. xv. p. 98.) conjectures, with a ſhew of reaſon, that this was no more than the minutes of a law, the heads of an intended bill, which were found in Scriniis Memoriae, among the papers of Conſtantius, and afterwards inſerted, a worthy model, in the Theodoſian Code.</note>.</q> But there is the ſtrongeſt reaſon to believe, that this formidable edict was either compoſed without being publiſhed, or was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed without being executed. The evidence of facts, and the monuments which are ſtill extant of braſs and marble, continue to prove the public exerciſe of the pagan worſhip during the whole reign of the ſons of Conſtantine. In the Eaſt, as well as in the Weſt, in cities, as well as in the country, a great number of temples were reſpected, or at leaſt were ſpared; and the devout multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude ſtill enjoyed the luxury of ſacrifices, of feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, and of proceſſions, by the permiſſion, or by the connivance, of the civil government. About four years after the ſuppoſed date of his
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:0034700103:416"/>
bloody edict, Conſtantius viſited the temples of Rome; and the decency of his behaviour is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by a pagan orator as an example worthy of the imitation of ſucceeding princes. <q>That emperor, ſays Symmachus, ſuffered the privileges of the veſtal virgins to remain inviolate; he beſtowed the ſacerdotal dignities on the nobles of Rome, granted the cuſtomary allowance to defray the expences of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic rites and ſacrifices: and, though he had embraced a different religion, he never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to deprive the empire of the ſacred worſhip of antiquity <note n="171" place="bottom">Symmach.

The title, the enſigns, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of SOVEREIGN PONTIFF, which had been inſtituted by Numa, and aſſumed by Auguſtus, were accepted, without heſitation, by ſeven Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian emperors; who were inveſted with a more abſolute authority over the religion which they had deſerted, than over that which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed <note n="172" place="bottom">The fourth Diſſertation of M. de la Baſtie, ſur le Souverain Pontificat des Empereurs Romains (in the Mem. de l'Acad. tom. xv. p. 75—144), is a very learned and judicious performance, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains the ſtate, and proves the toleration, of paganiſm from Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine to Gratian.

Georgic. ii. 382.). 2. By an eaſy extenſion of the word, <hi>pagan</hi> and rural became almoſt ſynonymous (Plin. Hiſt. Natur. xxviii. 5.); and the meaner ruſtics acquired that name, which has been corrupted into <hi>peaſants</hi> in the modern languages of Europe. 3. The amazing increaſe of the military order intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the neceſſity of a correlative term (Hume's Eſſays, vol. i. p. 555.); and all the <hi>people</hi> who were not enliſted in the ſervice of the prince were branded with the contemptuous epithet of pagans (Tacit. Hiſt. iii. 24. 43. 77. Juvenal. Satir. xvi. Tertullian de Pallio, c. 4.). 4. The Chriſtians were the ſoldiers of Chriſt; their adverſaries, who refuſed his <hi>ſacrament,</hi> or military oath of baptiſm, might deſerve the metaphorical name of pagans; and this popular reproach was introduced as early as the reign of Valentinian (A. D. 365.) into Imperial laws (Cod. Theodoſ. l. xvi. tit. ii. leg. 18.) and theological writings. 5. Chriſtianity gradually filled the cities of the empire: the old religion, in the time of Prudentius (adverſ. Symmachum, l. i. ad fin.) and Oroſius (in Praefat. Hiſt.), retired and languiſhed in obſcure villages; and the word <hi>pagans,</hi> with its new ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, reverted to its primitive origin. 6. Since the worſhip of Jupiter and his family has expired, the vacant title of pagans has been ſucceſſively applied to all the idolaters and polytheiſts of the old and new world. 7. The Latin Chriſtians beſtowed it, without ſcruple, on their mortal enemies the Mahometans; and the pureſt <hi>unitarians</hi> were branded with the unjuſt reproach of idolatry and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganiſm. See Gerard Voſſius Etymologicon Linguae Latinae, in his works, tom. i. p. 420. Godefroy's Commentary on the Theodoſian Code, tom. vi. p. 250. and Ducange, mediae &amp; infimae Latinitat.
