            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT human kind were not
deſigned merely to ſojourn a
few Days upon this Earth: that
a Being of ſuch Excellence as
the Soul of Man, ſo capable of a nobler
Life, and having ſuch a high Senſe of
Things moral and intellectual, was not crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
in the ſole View of being impriſoned in
an earthly Tabernacle, and partaking a few
Pains and Pleaſures which chequer this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
Life, without aſpiring to any thing ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
above or beyond it, is a Fundamental
Doctrine as well of Natural Religion as of
the Chriſtian. It comes at once recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1082102300:4"/>
by the Authority of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
and Evangeliſts. And that there ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
is in the Mind of Man a ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct
and deſire, an appetite and tendency
towards another and a better State, income<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably
ſuperior to the preſent, both in
point of Happineſs and Duration, is no
more than every one's Experience and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Feeling may inform him. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiety
and diſreliſh attending ſenſual Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
the reliſh for things of a more pure
and ſpiritual kind, the reſtleſs Motion of
the Mind, from one terrene Object of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
to another, and often a Flight or Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
above them all towards ſomething un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known,
and perfective of its Nature, are ſo
many ſigns and tokens of this better State,
which in the Style of the Goſpel is termed
Life Eternal.</p>
            <p>AND as this is the greateſt Good that
can befal us, the very end of our Being,
and that alone which can crown and ſatisfy
our Wiſhes, and without which we ſhall be
ever reſtleſs and uneaſy; ſo every Man,
who knows and acts up to his true Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
muſt make it his principal Care and
Study to obtain it: And in order to this,
he muſt endeavour to live ſuitably to his
Calling, and of conſequence endeavour to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1082102300:5"/>
make others obtain it too. For how can
a Chriſtian ſhew himſelf worthy of his Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,
otherwiſe than by performing the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of it? And what Chriſtian Duty is
more eſſentially ſo, than that of Charity?
And what Object can be found upon Earth
more deſerving our Charity, than the Souls
of Men? Or, how is it poſſible for the
moſt beneficent Spirit to do them better
Service, than by promoting their beſt and
moſt laſting Intereſt, that is by putting
them in the Way that leads to Eternal
Life.</p>
            <p>WHAT this Eternal Life was, or how
to come at it, were Points unknown to the
Heathen World. It muſt be owned, the
wiſe Men of Old, who followed the Light
of Nature, ſaw even by that Light, that
the Soul of Man was debaſed, and born
downwards, contrary to its natural Bent,
by carnal and terrene Objects; and that,
on the other hand, it was exalted, purged,
and in ſome ſort aſſimulated to the Deity,
by the Contemplation of Truth and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
of Virtue. Thus much in general they
ſaw or ſurmiſed. But then about the Way
and Means to know the one, or perform
the other, they were much at a loſs. They
were not agreed concerning the true End
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1082102300:6"/>
of Mankind; which, as they ſaw, was miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken
in the vulgar Purſuits of Men; ſo
they found it much more eaſy to confute
the Errors of others, than to aſcertain the
Truth themſelves. Hence ſo many Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Diſputes about a Point which it
moſt imported them to know, inſomuch as
it was to give the Bias to human Life, and
govern the whole Tenor of their Actions
and Conduct.</p>
            <p>BUT when Life and Immortality were
brought to Light by the Goſpel, there could
remain no Diſpute about the chief End and
Felicity of Man, no more than there could
about the Means of obtaining it, afer the
expreſs Declaration of our Bleſſed Lord in
the Words of my Text; <hi>This is Life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
that they may know thee, the only true
God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
For the right underſtanding of which Words
we muſt obſerve, that by the Knowledge
of God, is not meant a barren Speculation,
either of Philoſophers or Scholaſtic Divines,
nor any notional Tenets fitted to produce
Diſputes and Diſſentions among Men; but,
on the contrary, an holy practical Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
which is the Source, the Root, or
Principle of Peace and Union, of Faith,
Hope, Charity, and univerſal Obedience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:1082102300:7"/>
A Man may frame the moſt accurate Notions,
and in one Senſe attain the exacteſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God and Chriſt that human Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties
can reach, and yet, notwithſtanding
all this, be far from knowing them in that
ſaving Senſe. For St. <hi>John</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">1 Joh. iii. 6.</note> that
<hi>whoſoever ſinneth, hath not ſeen Chriſt, nor
known him.</hi> And again,<note place="margin">1 Joh. iv. 8.</note> 
               <hi>He that loveth not,
knoweth not God.</hi> To know God as we
ought, we muſt love him; and love him
ſo as withal to love our Brethren, his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and his Children. I ſay that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God and Chriſt, which is Life
eternal, implies univerſal Charity, with all
the Duties ingrafted thereon, or enſuing
from thence, that is to ſay, the Love of
God and Man. And our Lord expreſly
ſaith,<note place="margin">John xiv. 21.</note> 
               <hi>He that hath my Commandments, and
keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.</hi> From
all which it is evident, that this ſaving
Knowledge of God is inſeparable from
the Knowledge and Practice of his Will;
the explicit Declaration whereof, and of
the Means to perform it, are contained
in the Goſpel, that divine Inſtrument of
Grace and Mercy to the Sons of Men.
The metaphyſical Knowledge of God,
conſidered in his abſolute Nature of Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence,
is one thing, and to know him as
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1082102300:8"/>
he ſtands related to us as Creator, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and Sanctifier, is another. The
former kind of Knowledge (whatever it
amounts to) hath been, and may be, in
Gentiles as well as Chriſtians, but not the
latter, which is Life eternal.</p>
            <p>FROM what hath been ſaid, it is a plain
Conſequence, that whoever is a ſincere
Chriſtian, cannot be indifferent about
bringing over other Men to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God and Chriſt; but that every
one of us, who hath any Claim to that
Title, is indiſpenſably obliged in Duty to
God, and in Charity to his Neighbour, to
deſire and promote, ſo far as there is Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity,
the Converſion of Heathen and
Infidels, that ſo they may become Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers
of Life and Immortality. For, <hi>this
is Life eternal, to know thee the only true
God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN my preſent Diſcourſe upon which
Words; I ſhall,<list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> CONSIDER in general, the Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
that Chriſtians lie under, of
bringing other Men to the Knowledge
of the only true God, and of Jeſus
Chriſt. And,</item>
                  <item>
                     <pb n="9" facs="tcp:1082102300:9"/>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> I ſhall conſider it in Reference
to this laudable Society, inſtituted for
the Propagation of the Goſpel. And
under each Head, I propoſe to obviate
ſuch Difficulties as may ſeem to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard,
and intermix ſuch Remarks as
ſhall appear proper to forward ſo
good a Work.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>NOW although it be very evident, that
we can really have neither a juſt Zeal for
the Glory of God, nor a beneficent Love
of Man, without wiſhing and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
as occaſion ſerves, to ſpread the glad
Tidings of Salvation, and bring thoſe who
are benighted in the Shadow of Death, to
Life eternal, by the Knowledge of the only
true God, and of Jeſus Chriſt whom he
hath ſent. Yet this Duty, plain and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted
as it ſeems, happens to be too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
overlooked, even by thoſe, whoſe At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
to other Points would make one
think their Neglect of this, not an Effect
of lukewarm Indifference, ſo much as of
certain miſtaken Notions and Suppoſitions.
Two principal Conſiderations occur, which,
in this particular, ſeem to have ſlackened
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1082102300:10"/>
the Induſtry of ſome, otherwiſe zealous and
ſerious Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>ONE I apprehend to be this, that it is
ſurmiſed, the Chriſtian Religion is in a
declining State, which by many Symptoms
ſeems likely to end either in Popery, or a
general Infidelity. And that of Courſe a
prudent Perſon has nothing to do, but to
make ſure of his own Salvation, and to
acquieſce in the general Tendency of things,
without being at any fruitleſs Pains to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
what cannot be prevented, to ſteer
againſt the Stream, or reſiſt a Torrent,
which as it flows, gathers Strength and
Rapidity, and in the End, will be ſure to
overflow, and carry all before it. When
a Man of a deſponding and foreboding
Spirit hath been led, by his obſervation of
the Ways of the World, and the prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Humour of our Times, to think af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
this manner; he will be inclined to
ſtrengthen this his preconceived Opinion,
as is uſual in other the like Caſes, by Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>application
of holy Scripture: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
by thoſe Words of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour,<note place="margin">Luke xviii. 8.</note>
               <hi>When the Son of Man cometh, ſhall
he find Faith upon Earth?</hi> which have
been applied to this very purpoſe, as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting
that before the final Judgment,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1082102300:11"/>
Chriſtian Faith ſhould be extinguiſhed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Earth; Although theſe Words do, from
the Context, ſeem plainly to refer to the
Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and the obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
Blindneſs of the Jews, who even
then when they felt the Hand of God,
ſhould not acknowledge it, or believe the
<hi>Roman</hi> Army to be the Inſtrument of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Vengeance, in the Day of their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitation,
by him whom they had injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
treated, rejected, and put to Death.</p>
            <p>BUT, granting the former Senſe might
be ſupported by no abſurd Hypotheſis, or
no improbable Gueſs; yet ſhall the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours
of Chriſtian Men for propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
the Goſpel of Chriſt be foreſtalled
by any Suppoſitions or Conjectures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever?
admitting, I ſay, thoſe Words
regard the future Advent of Jeſus Chriſt,
yet can any one tell how near or how far
off that Advent may be? Are not the Times
and Seaſons foreknown only to God? And
ſhall we neglect a certain Duty to Day, upon
an uncertain Surmiſe of what is to come
hereafter? This way of thinking might
furniſh as ſtrong Reaſons againſt Preaching
at home, as abroad, within, as without the
Pale of the Church. It would be as ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
an Argument againſt the one as the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1082102300:12"/>
but in reality can conclude againſt nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.
For, as we know not when that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Time of general Infidelity is to be, or
whether it will be at all; ſo, if it were
ever ſo ſure, and ever ſo near, it would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs
become us to take Care, that it
may not be an Effect of our own particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Indifference and Neglect.</p>
            <p>BUT if we take our Notions, not from
the uncertain Interpretation of a particular
Text, but from the whole Tenor of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Oracles, from the expreſs Promiſe and
reiterated Predictions of our Bleſſed Lord,
and his Apoſtles, we ſhall believe, that
<note place="margin">Phil. ii. 9, 10, 11.</note>
               <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is highly exalted of God, to the
End,
that at his Name every Knee ſhall
bow, and every Tongue confeſs that he is the
Lord, to the Glory of God the Father.</hi> That
<note place="margin">1 Cor. xv. 25.</note>
               <hi>he muſt Reign till he hath put all Enemies
under his Feet.</hi>
That <note place="margin">Mat. xxviii. 20.</note>
               <hi>He is with us alway,
even unto the End of the World.</hi>
And that,
<note place="margin">Mat. xvi. 18.</note>
               <hi>The Church of the living God, the pillar and
ground of Truth, is ſo far from being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd
human Means,
that the gates of
Hell</hi> (all the infernal Powers) <hi>ſhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail
againſt it.</hi> Let us therefore baniſh all
ſuch Conceits as may ſeem to juſtifie our In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence,
as may reaſon us out of all courage
and vigour in the Race that is ſet before
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1082102300:13"/>
us; let us not, I ſay, ſlacken our own Hands,
nor enfeeble our own Knees, by preconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Fancies and Suppoſitions, conſidering
that as the Succeſs of all Enterpriſes in
great Meaſure depends on the Spirit of the
Undertakers, ſo nothing is more apt to raiſe
a Spirit than Hope; or to depreſs it, than
Deſpondency. We ought therefore to ſhake
off every vain Fear in our ſpiritual Warfare.
The Number, the Preſumption, and the
Abilities of thoſe, who take Counſel toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
againſt the Lord, and againſt his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointed,
ſhould not diſhearten, but rather
excite and encourage us to ſtand in the Gap.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER Conſideration, that may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
withhold divers ſincere Believers from
contributing their Endeavours for bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men to the Knowledge of God and
Chriſt, and thereby to eternal Life, is the
want of Miracles in the preſent Age. Men
naturally caſt about for Reaſons to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance
the Part they take. And as the Gift
of Miracles was of mighty Influence and
Help to thoſe, who were commiſſioned to
ſpread abroad the Light of the Goſpel in
its firſt promulgation, ſo no Pretence offers
it ſelf more naturally to excuſe a Man
from executing any purpoſe, than the want
of Authority, which, in the Opinion of
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1082102300:14"/>
Men, cannot be without a juſt Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
nor this unleſs diſtinguiſhed by thoſe
proper Means and Powers that have been
known to attend it. Now, with regard to
this defect of Miracles, I ſhall beg leave to
make two Obſervations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is to be obſerved, that if we have
not Miracles, we have other Advantages
which make them leſs neceſſary now, than
in the firſt ſpreading of the Goſpel: Whole
Nations have found the Benefit of Chriſt's
Religion, it is protected by Princes, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed
and encouraged by Laws, ſupported by
Learning and Arts, recommended by
the Experience of many Ages, as well as
by the Authority and Example of the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt
and moſt knowing Men. Certainly,
if the greater Part of Mankind are Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
or Mahometans, it cannot be denied
that the moſt knowing, moſt learned, and
moſt improved Nations, profeſs Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
and that even the Mahometans them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
bear Teſtimony to the Divine Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of Jeſus Chriſt. Whereas therefore,
in the Beginning, a few illiterate Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers,
of the meaneſt of the People, had
the Prejudices, the Learning, and the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
of their own, as well as other Nations,
in one Word, the whole World, to oppoſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1082102300:15"/>
and overcome: Thoſe who at this Day en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in the Propagation of the Goſpel, do
it upon Terms in many Reſpects far more
eaſy and advantageous. It is Power againſt
Weakneſs, Civility againſt Barbariſm, Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
againſt Ignorance, ſome or other, if
not all theſe Advantages, in the preſent
Times, attending the Progreſs of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
Religion, in whatever Part of the
World Men ſhall attempt to plant it.</p>
            <p>IN the ſecond Place we may reflect, that
if we have not the Gift of Miracles, this
is a good Reaſon why we ſhould exert
more ſtrongly thoſe human Means which
God hath put in our Power; and make
our ordinary Faculties, whether of the
Head, or the Hand, or the Tongue, our
Intereſt, our Credit, or our Fortune, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient
to the great Giver of them; and
chearfully contribute our humble Mite to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
haſtening that Time,
wherein <note place="margin">Pſalm lxxxvi. 9.</note>
               <hi>all
Nations whom thou haſt made, ſhall come
and worſhip before thee, O Lord, and ſhall
glorifie thy Name.</hi> It is at leaſt a plain
Caſe, that the Want of Apoſtolical Gifts
ſhould not be pleaded as a Bar to our
doing that, which in no Reſpect, either
of Difficulty or Danger, equals, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
the Apoſtolical Office. What
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1082102300:16"/>
Pretence can this ſupply for Mens being
quite unconcerned about the ſpreading of
the Goſpel, or the Salvation of Souls? For
Mens forgetting that they are Chriſtians,
and related to human Kind? How can
this juſtify their overlooking Opportunities
which lie in their Way, their not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
a ſmall Part of their Fortune
towards forwarding a Deſign, wherein they
ſhare neither Pains nor Peril; the not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowing
on it, even the cheap Aſſiſtance
of their Speech, Attention, Counſel, or
Countenance, as Occaſion offers? How un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like
is this worldly, ſelfiſh Indifference, to
that Account which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
that <note place="margin">1 Cor. x. 33.</note>
               <hi>he ſought not his own the Profit, but
the Profit of many, that they may be ſaved.</hi>
And yet herein he expected the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi>
(and the ſame Reaſon will hold for
us) ſhould be like him; for he ſubjoins, <hi>Be
ye Followers of me as I alſo am of Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>HAVING conſidered the Duty in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral,
I come now to treat of it with Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
to <hi>America,</hi> the peculiar Province of
this Venerable Society; which I ſuppoſe
well informed of the State and Progreſs of
Religion in that part of the World, by
their Correſpondencies with the Clergy
upon their Miſſion. It may nevertheleſs
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1082102300:17"/>
be expected that one who had been engaged
in a Deſign in this very View, who hath
been upon the Place, and reſided a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Time in one of our Colonies, ſhould
have obſerved ſomewhat worth reporting.
It is to be hoped, therefore, that one Part
of my Audience will pardon, what the
other may, perhaps, expect, while I detain
them with the Narrative of a few Things
I have obſerved, and ſuch Reflections as
thereupon ſuggeſted themſelves; ſome
part of which may poſſibly be found to
extend to other Colonies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> with a Portion of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
Continent, under the ſame Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is inhabited by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colony,
conſiſting chiefly of Sectaries of many differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Denominations, who ſeem to have worn
off part of that Prejudice, which they inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited
from their Anceſtors, againſt the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
Church of this Land; though it
muſt be acknowledged at the ſame Time,
that too many of them have worn off a
ſerious Senſe of all Religion. Several in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
of the better Sort are accuſtomed to
aſſemble themſelves regularly on the Lord's
Day for the Performance of Divine Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
But moſt of thoſe, who are diſperſed
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1082102300:18"/>
throughout this Colony, ſeem to rival
ſome well-bred People of other Countries,
in a thorough Indifference for all that is
ſacred, being equally careleſs of outward
Worſhip, and of inward Principles, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
of Faith or Practice. Of the Bulk
of them it may certainly be ſaid, that
they live without the Sacraments, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſo much as baptized: And as for their
Morals, I apprehend there is nothing to
be found in them that ſhould tempt others
to make an Experiment of their Principles,
either in Religion or Government. But
it muſt be owned, the general Behaviour
of the Inhabitants in thoſe Towns where
Churches and Meetings have been long
ſettled, and regularly attended, ſeems ſo
much better, as ſufficiently to ſhew the
Difference, which a ſolemn regular Worſhip
of God makes between Perſons of the ſame
Blood, Temper, and natural Faculties.</p>
            <p>THE native Indians, who are ſaid to
have been formerly many Thouſands, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
the compaſs of this Colony, do not at
preſent amount to one Thouſand, includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
every Age and Sex. And theſe are
all either Servants or Labourers for the
Engliſh, who have contributed more to
deſtroy their Bodies by the Uſe of ſtrong
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1082102300:19"/>
Liquors, than by any Means to improve
their Minds, or ſave their Souls. This
ſlow Poiſon, jointly operating with the
Small-Pox, and their Wars (but much
more deſtructive than both) hath conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med
the Indians, not only in our Colonies,
but alſo far and wide upon our Confines.
And having made Havock of them, is
now doing the ſame Thing by thoſe who
taught them that odious Vice.</p>
            <p>THE Negroes in the Government of
<hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> are about half as many more
than the Indians; and both together ſcarce
amount to a ſeventh Part of the whole
Colony. The Religion of theſe People,
as is natural to ſuppoſe, takes after that
of their Maſters. Some few are baptized;
ſeveral frequent the different Aſſemblies:
and far the greater Part none at all. An
antient Antipathy to the Indians, whom,
it ſeems, our firſt Planters (therein as in
certain other Particulars affecting to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate
Jews rather than Chriſtians) imagined
they had a Right to treat on the Foot
of <hi>Canaanites</hi> or <hi>Amalekites,</hi> together with
an irrational Contempt of the Blacks, as
Creatures of another Species, who had
no Right to be inſtructed or admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to the Sacraments, have proved a
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1082102300:20"/>
main Obſtacle to the Converſion of theſe
poor People.</p>
            <p>TO this may be added, an erroneous No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
that the being baptized, is inconſiſtent
with a State of Slavery. To undeceive
them in this Particular, which had too
much Weight, it ſeemed a proper Step, if
the Opinion of his Majeſty's Attorney and
Sollicitor-General could be procured. This
Opinion they charitably ſent over, ſigned
with their own Hands; which was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly
printed in <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and diſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
throughout the Plantations. I heartily
wiſh it may produce the intended Effect.
It muſt be owned, our reformed Planters,
with reſpect to the Natives and the Slaves,
might learn from thoſe of the Church of
<hi>Rome,</hi> how it is their Intereſt and Duty to
behave. Both <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> have
intermarried with <hi>Indians,</hi> to the great
Strength, Security and Increaſe of their
Colonies. They take Care to inſtruct both
them and their Negroes, in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
to the Reproach of thoſe who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs
a better. They have alſo Biſhops and
Seminaries for Clergy; and it is not found
that their Colonies are worſe Subjects,
or depend leſs on their Mother Country,
on that Account.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:1082102300:21"/>
IT ſhould ſeem, that the likelieſt Step
towards converting the Heathen, would be
to begin with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Planters; whoſe
Influence will for ever be an Obſtacle to
propagating the Goſpel, till they have a
right Senſe of it themſelves, which would
ſhew them how much it is their Duty to
impart it to others. The Miſſionaries em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by this Venerable Society have done,
and continue to do, good Service, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
thoſe Planters to a ſerious Senſe of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
which, it is hoped, will in time ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
to others. I ſpeak it knowingly, that
the Miniſters of the Goſpel, in thoſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces
which go by the Name of <hi>New-England,</hi>
ſent and ſupported at the Expence
of this Society, have, by their Sobriety of
Manners, diſcreet Behaviour, and a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
Degree of uſeful Knowledge, ſhewn
themſelves worthy the Choice of thoſe who
ſent them; and particularly in living on a
more friendly Foot with their Brethren of
the Separation; who, on their Part, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo
very much come off from that Narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of Spirit, which formerly kept them
at ſuch an unamicable Diſtance from us.
And as there is reaſon to apprehend, that
Part of <hi>America</hi> could not have been thus
diſtinguiſhed, and provided with ſuch a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1082102300:22"/>
Number of proper Perſons, if one half of
them had not been ſupplied out of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting
Seminaries of the Country, who, in
Proportion as they attain to more liberal
Improvements of Learning, are obſerved to
quit their Prejudice towards an Epiſcopal
Church; ſo I verily think it might increaſe
the Number of ſuch uſeful Men, if Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
were made to defray their Charges in
coming hither to receive holy Orders; paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
and repaſſing the Ocean, and tarrying
the neceſſary Time in <hi>London,</hi> requiring an
Expence that many are not able to bear.
It would alſo be an Encouragement to the
Miſſionaries in general, and probably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
good Effects, if the Allowance of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Miſſionaries were augmented, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the Service they had done, and
the Time they had ſpent in their Miſſion.
Theſe Hints I venture to ſuggeſt, as not
unuſeful in an Age, wherein all humane
Encouragements are found more neceſſary,
than at the firſt Propagation of the Goſpel.
But they are, with all due Deference and
Reſpect, ſubmitted to the Judgment of this
Venerable Audience.</p>
            <p>AFTER all, it is hardly to be expected,
that ſo long as Infidelity prevails at home,
the Chriſtian Religion ſhould thrive and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1082102300:23"/>
flouriſh in our Colonies abroad. Mankind,
it muſt be owned, left to themſelves, are ſo
much bewildered and benighted, with reſpect
to the Origin of that Evil which they feel,
and from which they are at a Loſs about the
Means of being freed; that the Doctrines of
the lapſed State of Man, his Reconciliation
by Chriſt, and Regeneration by the Spirit,
may reaſonably be hoped to find an eaſy
Admiſſion, as bringing with them Light and
Comfort, into a Mind not hardened by Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency,
nor fore-cloſed by Pride, nor
bias'd by Prejudice. But, ſuch is the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
of Man, that no Prejudice operates
more powerfully than that in Favour of
Faſhion; and no Faſhions are ſo much
followed by our Colonies, as thoſe of the
Mother Country, which they often adopt
in their Modes of living, to their great
Inconvenience, without allowing for the
Diſparity of Circumſtance or Climate.
This ſame Humour hath made Infidelity
(as I find it too credibly reported) ſpread
in ſome of our wealthy Plantations; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>educated
Men being more apt to tread in
the Steps of Libertines and Men of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
than to model themſelves by the
Laws and Institutions of their Mother
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1082102300:24"/>
Country, or the Lives and Profeſſions of
the virtuous and religious Part of it.</p>
            <p>BUT this is not all; While thoſe abroad
are leſs diſpoſed to receive, ſome at home
are, perhaps, leſs diſpoſed to propagate the
Goſpel, from the ſame Cauſe. It is to be
feared, I ſay, that the prevailing Torrent
of Infidelity, which ſtaggers the Faith of
ſome, may cool the Zeal, and damp the
Spirit of others, who, judging from the
Event and Succeſs of thoſe, who impugn
the Church of Chriſt, may poſſibly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
ſome Scruple or Surmiſe, whether it
may not be, for the preſent at leaſt, aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
by Providence, and that human Care
muſt ineffectually interpoſe, till it ſhall pleaſe
God, <hi>yet once more to ſhake not the Earth
only, but alſo the Heavens.</hi> This Point hath
been touched before, but deſerves farther
Conſideration: to the end, that the peculiar
Impiety of a profane Age, may not be a Bar
to thoſe very Endeavours, which it ſelf ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
more neceſſary, and calls for more loud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
now than ever.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER Men may think, the Arm
of the Lord is not ſhorten'd. In all this
Prevalency of Atheiſm and Irreligion, there
is no Advantage gained, by the Powers of
Darkneſs, either againſt God, or godly Men,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1082102300:25"/>
but only againſt their own wretched Partiſans.
The Chriſtian Diſpenſation is a Diſpenſation
of Grace and Favour. The Chriſtian Church
a Society of Men intitled to this Grace,
on performing certain Conditions. If this
Society is diminiſhed, as thoſe who remain
true Members of it ſuffer no Loſs to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
ſo God loſeth no Right, ſuffereth no
Detriment, foregoeth no Good; his Grace
reſiſted or unfruitful, being no more loſt to
him, than the Light of the Sun ſhining on
deſart Places, or among People who ſhut
their Eyes.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, this Exceſs, this unſtemmed
Torrent of Profaneneſs, may poſſibly, in the
Concluſion, defeat itſelf, confirm what it
meant to extirpate, and inſtead of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
prove a Means of preſerving our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;
the evil Fruits and Effects thereof
being ſo notorious and flagrant, and ſo ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
felt, as in all likelyhood to be able to
open the Eyes, and rouſe the Attention of
thoſe, who may be blind and deaf to every
other Argument and Conſideration. Or, who
knows but the Chriſtian Church corrupted
by Proſperity, is to be reſtored and purified
by Adverſity? which may prove, for ought
we can tell, as ſalutary in future, as it hath
been in paſt Ages. Many inſolent and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1082102300:26"/>
Foes have ſet themſelves againſt
the Church of God; whoſe Hook neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
may be in their Noſtrils, and his Bridle
in their Lips, managing and governing, even
their Rage and Folly, to the fulfilling of his
own wiſe Purpoſes; and who may not fail
in the End, to deal by them as he did by the
King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> when he had <hi>performed his
Work upon Sin and upon Jeruſalem, puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their ſtout Heart and high Looks.</hi> This
preſumptuous Conqueror was, without
knowing it, a Tool or Inſtrument in the
Hands of that God whom he blaſphemed.
<note place="margin">Iſa. x. 5, 6, 7.</note>
               <hi>O Aſſyrian,
the Rod of mine Anger! I will
ſend him againſt an hypocritical Nation, and
againſt the People of my Wrath will I give
him a Charge to take the Spoil, and to take
the Prey, and to tread them down like the
Mire of the Streets. Howbeit he meaneth
not ſo, neither doth his Heart think ſo, but
it is in his Heart to deſtroy and cut off Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
not a few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS much at leaſt is evident: It is no
new Thing, that great Enormities ſhould
produce great Humiliations, and theſe again
noble Vertues, which have often recovered
both ſingle Men, and whole States, even in a
natural and civil Senſe. And if the Captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
Diſtreſſes, and Deſolations of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1082102300:27"/>
Church, have occaſioned their Return to
God, and reinſtated them in his Favour;
nay, if it was actually foretold, whenever
they lay under the Curſe of God, at the
Mercy of their Enemies, peeled and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
in a foreign Land, that nevertheleſs
upon their calling his Covenant to Mind,
and returning to him, <note place="margin">Deut. xxx. 3.</note>
               <hi>the Lord their God
would turn their Captivity,
and have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
upon them.</hi> I ſay, if Things were ſo,
why may we not in Reaſon hope for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
analogous thereto, in behalf of the
Chriſtian Church. It cannot be denied, that
there was a great Analogy between the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
Inſtitutions, and the Doctrines of the
Goſpel; for inſtance, between the Paſchal
Lamb, and the Lamb of God ſlain from the
Foundation of the World; between the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian</hi>
Bondage, and that of Sin; the earthly
<hi>Canaan,</hi> and the heavenly; the fleſhly Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, and the ſpiritual. In theſe and
many other Particulars, the Analogy ſeems ſo
plain, that it can hardly be diſputed. To be
convinced that the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the
Jewiſh Oeconomy were Figures and Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
of the Evangelical, we need only look
into the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> May we
not therefore, in purſuance of this ſame A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalogy,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1082102300:28"/>
ſuppoſe a ſimilar Treatment of the
Jewiſh and Chriſtian Church?</p>
            <p>LET us then ſee, on what Terms the
former ſtood with God, in order to diſcover
what the latter may reaſonably expect. The
ſolemn Denunciation to the Jews was,<note place="margin">Deut. xxviii. 1.</note> 
               <hi>If thou
ſhalt kearken diligently to the Lord thy God,
to obſerve and to do all his Commandments,
which I command thee this Day, the Lord thy
God will ſet thee on high above all the Nations
of the Earth.</hi> But in caſe of Diſobedience,
it is added among many other Threats and
Maledictions:<note place="margin">Ver. 22, 23.</note> 
               <hi>The Lord ſhall ſmite thee
with Blaſting and with Mildew: and the
Heaven that is over thy Head ſhall be Braſs,
and the Earth that is under thy Feet ſhall be
Iron.</hi>
And again,<note place="margin">Ver. 28</note> 
               <hi>The Lord ſhall ſmite thee
with Madneſs, and Blindneſs, and Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Heart.</hi> Have not the People of this
Land drawn down upon it, by more Ways
than one, the juſt Judgments of Heaven?
Surely we have felt in a Metaphor the firſt
of the forementioned Judgments; and the
laſt hath been literally fulfilled upon us.
Is it not viſible that we are leſs knowing,
leſs vertuous, leſs reaſonable, in proportion
as we are leſs religious? Are we not grown
drunk and giddy with Vice and Vanity
and Preſumption, and Free-thinking, and
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1082102300:29"/>
Extravagance of every kind? to a Degree
that we may truly be ſaid to be <hi>ſmitten with
Madneſs, and Blindneſs, and Aſtoniſhment of
Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS antiently moſt unchriſtian Schiſms and
Diſputes, joined with great Corruption of
Manners, made way for the Mahometan in the
Eaſt, and the Papal Dominion in the
Weſt; even ſo here at home in the laſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury,
a weak Reliance upon human Politics
and Power on the one hand, and enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic
Rage on the other, together with car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Mindedneſs on both, gave occaſion to
introduce Atheiſm and Infidelity. If the
temporal State, and outward Form of the
Jewiſh Church was, upon their Defection,
overturned by Invaders, in like manner, when
Chriſtians are no longer governed by the
Light of Evangelical Truth, when we reſiſt
the Spirit of God, are we not to expect, that
<hi>the Heaven above will be as Braſs,</hi> that the
Divine Grace will no longer ſhower down
on our obdurate Hearts, that our Church
and Profeſſion will be blaſted by licentious
Scorners, thoſe Madmen, who in Sport <hi>ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
Firebrands, Arrows and Death</hi>? As all
this is no more than we may reaſonably ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
will enſue upon our Backſliding, ſo we
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1082102300:30"/>
may, with equal Reaſon, hope it will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied
upon our Return to God.</p>
            <p>FROM what hath been ſaid it follows,
that in order to propagate the Goſpel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad,
it is neceſſary we do it at home, and
extend our Charity to domeſtic Infidels, if
we would convert or prevent foreign ones.
So that a View of the declining State of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
here at home, of thoſe things that
produced this Declenſion, and of the proper
Methods to repair it, is naturally connected
with the Subject of this Diſcourſe. I ſhall
therefore beg your Patience, while I juſt
mention a few Remarks or Hints, too ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious,
perhaps, in themſelves to be new or
unknown to any preſent, but too little vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
in their Effects, to make one think
they are, by all, much attended to.</p>
            <p>SOME, preferring Points notional or ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual
to the Love of God and Man, conſider
the National Church only as it ſtands oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to other Chriſtian Societies. Theſe ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
have a Zeal without Knowledge, and
the Effects are ſuitable to the Cauſe; they
really hurt what they ſeem to eſpouſe. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
more ſolicitous about the Diſcovery
of Truth, than the Practice of Holineſs,
employ themſelves, rather to ſpy out Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
in the Church, than enforce its Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1082102300:31"/>
Theſe, it is to be feared, poſtpone
the great Intereſts of Religion to Points of
leſs Concern, in any Eyes but their own.
But ſurely they would do well to conſider,
that an humble, though confuſed or indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct,
Faith in the Bond of Charity, and
productive of good Works, is much more
Evangelical than an accurate diſputing and
conceited Knowledge.</p>
            <p>A Church which contains the Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals,
and nothing ſubverſive of thoſe Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals,
is not to be ſet at naught by any
particular Member; becauſe it may not, in
every Point, perhaps, correſpond with his
Ideas, no not, though he is ſure of being
in the right. Probably there never was, or
will be, an eſtabliſhed Church in this World,
without viſible Marks of Humanity upon
it. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth,<note place="margin">x Cor. iii. 12.</note> that <hi>on the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation
of Jeſus Chriſt,
there will be human
Superſtructures of Hay and Stubble,</hi> things
light and trivial, wrong or ſuperſtitious,
which indeed is a natural Conſequence of
the Weakneſs and Ignorance of Man. But
where that living Foundation is rightly laid
in the Mind, there will not fail to grow and
ſpring from thence thoſe Vertues and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
which are the genuine Effects and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens
of true Faith, and which are by no
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1082102300:32"/>
means inconſiſtent with every Error in The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory,
or every needleſs Rite in Worſhip.</p>
            <p>THE Chriſtian Religion was calculated
for the Bulk of Mankind, and therefore
cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed to conſiſt in
ſubtle and nice Notions. From the time
that Divinity was conſidered as a Science,
and human Reaſon enthroned in the San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary
of God, the Hearts of its Profeſſors
ſeem to have been leſs under the Influence
of Grace. From that time have grown ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
unchriſtian Diſſentions and Controverſies,
of Men <note place="margin">1 Tim. vi. 4.</note>
               <hi>knowing nothing,
but doating about
Queſtions and Strife of Words, whereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
Envy, Strife, Railings, evil Surmiſes, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
Diſputings of Men of corrupt Minds,
and deſtitute of Truth.</hi> Doubtleſs, the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king
Religion a notional Thing, hath been
of infinite Diſſervice. And whereas its ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Myſteries are rather to be received with
Humility of Faith, than defined and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured
by the accuracy of human Reaſon; all
Attempts of this kind, however well inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,
have viſibly failed in the Event; and
inſtead of reconciling Infidels, have, by cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating
Diſputes and Heats among the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors
of Chriſtianity, given no ſmall Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
to its Enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1082102300:33"/>
TO conclude, if we proportioned our
Zeal to the Importance of Things: If we
could love Men whoſe Opinions we do not
approve: If we knew the World more,
and liked it leſs: If we had a due Senſe
of the Divine Perfection and our own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects:
If our chief Study was the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
from above, deſcribed by St. <hi>Paul.</hi>
And if, in order to all this, that were done
in Places of Education, which cannot ſo
well be done out of them: I ſay, if theſe
Steps were taken at home, while proper
Meaſures are carrying on abroad, the one
would very much forward or facilitate
the other. As it is not meant, ſo it muſt
not be underſtood, that foreign Attempts
ſhould wait for domeſtic Succeſs, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
that it is to be wiſhed they may co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate.
Certainly if a juſt and rational,
a genuine and ſincere, a warm and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Piety, animated the Mother-Country,
the Influence thereof would ſoon reach
our Foreign Plantations, and extend through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
their Borders. We ſhould ſoon ſee
Religion ſhine forth with new Luſtre and
Force, to the Converſion of Infidels, both
at home and abroad, and to <note place="margin">2 Cor. x. 5.</note>
