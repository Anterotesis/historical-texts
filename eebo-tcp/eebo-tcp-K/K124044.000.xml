            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A LETTER OF AN Eminent Divine, TO THE DISPENSARY PHYSICIANS.</head>
            <p>I Had in my Sermon diſcours'd, That the Creator of the World had given Reaſon to Mankind, to adapt the Governments and Laws to their various Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; as the Foods and Medicines, which are beſtow'd on us in the greateſt abundance, have been prepar'd from Obſervation and Experience, in the different Climates, for the Preſervation of Life. All the Governments have been and muſt be proſperous, when (as all the parts of our Body are deſign'd for the common Life of the whole) the People ſhall with Courage defend the Prince, and cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully obſerve the Laws; and when the Supreme and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feriour Magiſtrates ſhall vigilantly preſerve the Properties of the Subjects. The firſt and the greateſt Property is Life, which demands the Preſervation, by the Laws, of the Plenty of all things neceſſary to maintain it. As all the Parts of our Body aſſiſt the other, every Subject is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0722502100:3"/>oblig'd to defend one the other, muſt repell all Aſſaults, muſt demand of the inferiour Magiſtrates their Care of the Publick Welfare. The happineſs of Mankind is inſur'd to us on theſe Conditions only, and are not loſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray'd but by our own Follies; as our Health, by Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Exceſs, and our Life in Diſeaſes by the neglect or unhappy application or Medicines. It is Impious to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect Miracles to ſupply our Negligence of our own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. The Clergy are appointed to act, as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puties of the Supreme Power, to admoniſh the Prince and the People, to exact the great mutual Duties of Juſtice, Obedience, and the Care of the Publick Proſperity.</p>
            <p>You will be ſurpriz'd, Gentlemen, how much this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe inflam'd my Pariſhioners, to debate and diſcover if any Care is taken of the People in Sickneſs, it has from them recoyl'd on me, and ſav'd me, as thoſe that heard it. I could not vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>it any one Family, but I was moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly affected. We are the moſt neglected, tho' moſt op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt People in the World. The Poor, the Servants, the meaner Tradeſmen are undone in every Sickneſs. We are cheated for one Dram and for one Spoonful of the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in a greater degree of Expence, than the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment formerly did, and now can and muſt ſecure to us a Pound and a Gallon of the beſt Medicines in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; and then to multiply theſe Frauds, we muſt in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Diſeaſe take the oppreſſive, pernicious Multitude of the little ſhamming Doſes. In other Houſes, <hi>Lord have Mercy on us!</hi> VVhat do the Magiſtrates think, to ſuffer every Boy ſetting up the Trade of an <hi>Apothecary</hi> (whoſe Skill has never been examin'd) and every Vagabond from Foreign Countries to impoſe on our Weakneſs by a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Lyes, to undertake all the dangerous Diſeaſes? Do they ſee and hear, that many near them are daily kill'd by their Ignorance of the Diſeaſe, by the Numbers of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, by which only they pay themſelves for their deadly Care and Advice? Are they inſenſible of all Humanity, of the Guilt they contract, as Accomplices? The Eternal Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0722502100:4"/>of the Inhabitants of the Iſland is gloriouſly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſ'd, ſhall we be wretchedly heedleſs of ſecuring the Union of the Soul and Body of every Inhabitant? VVe muſt imitate the excellent Diſcipline of the <hi>Britains</hi> of the Northern Part, encourage Virtue and the Publick Spirit, and repel the raging Libertinage and Contempt of all Order and the Laws deſtructive to all Societies. Are the furious Inroads and Devaſtations and Butcheries of the Borders aboliſh'd, and all the Profeſſions of Religion, the Law and Phyſick without defence, laid open to the Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of every impudent Pretender, with the Arts only and Abilities to cheat and delude the People, deſtitute of the Advice and Defence of the Magiſtrates? The VVicked Phyſicians and Surgeons are the firſt and Principal Cauſe of our Miſeries, they baſely juſtify to us their wretched Quackery, when call'd in at the Extremity; they vainly labour to mend the Miſtakes by contrary Methods, and they improve the Robbery by appointing the ſame endleſs quantities of the little Doſes, many ſuperfluous and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, many more than they uſe in their own Houſes. Theſe two Enormous Crimes (the Phyſicians and Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have almoſt engroſs'd to themſelves) deſerve Death. The College and the Company ſupported by the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment can only ſave us. But there are Phyſicians and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons more Honeſt and Learned than our Enemies, who would ſecure us from this Robbery and Deſtruction, and preſerve the College and Company to improve all the Members in the reſpective Arts and Sincerity to the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, they are both aſſaulted by the perjur'd Perfidiouſneſs of many of both the Societies. Dr. <hi>R.</hi> ſwears every day he will damn and deſtroy it; that there is, and ſhall be no other Phyſician in the Nation but himſelf. The largeſt part of the Phyſicians delude us fatally, commending the vile VVork the Apothecary has made, deſign nothing more in the Preſcription than his Profit, ruin their own Profeſſion to gain the prevalent Recommendation, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Apothecaries favour. There is a Surgeon
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0722502100:5"/>of the ſame Principles and Morals with the Bravo Doctor, who breaks his Company, and the Improvements and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of his Prentices, that he may be nois'd as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Judge and Operator. The others, by a deadly piece of Work they are now and then prefer'd to. What will be the Fate of the miſerable <hi>Engliſh,</hi> when the Apothecaries are increas'd by two or three Prentices in all the Shops, when the College and Company ſhall be deſerted, and our Life, and the two Profeſſions ſhall be deſtitute of the Care of the Magiſtrate?</p>
            <p>You know, Gentlemen, I came lately to my Prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment here from the Univerſity; we have the ſame Uſage in <hi>Oxford</hi> and <hi>Cambridge.</hi> The Profeſſors are inſenſible, that the Faculty is invaded, almoſt ruin'd. Do they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the Students in the faithful and learned Practice, to preſerve the Patients and the Profeſſion together? I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Outlyers affront the College, refuſe to unite with it, betray it and themſelves, and the Sick, to the Apothecaries Encroachments. Alarm'd with theſe Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages, I demanded of many of the Apothecaries Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, how long they intended to cultivate and increaſe the fraudulent and pernicious Practice? They reply'd with great Impudence, as long as the People cannot diſcover it, as long as we muſt live by it. We own, that the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and People are us'd by us in the moſt filthy man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. We ſhall be call'd <hi>Scavengers</hi> and <hi>Reformers,</hi> if we uſe them otherwiſe. We have no other ways to come into Buſineſs, but yielding all the Diſeaſes to the Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caries, 'till Danger or Death appear; we muſt complement the Choice of us to mend the matter, by extolling their great Skill and Care, and by writing two or three Guineas a Day of the ſmall Doſes, let the Caſe be what it will. We will not riſque thoſe our only Fees and Reputation, to ſave the Kingdom. Many Surgeons aſſur'd me, their Caſe was the ſame, and oblig'd me with the Information of the Remonſtrances of your College, which they ſaid, aſſert Surgery as well as Phyſick, ſold at the <hi>Crane</hi> in <hi>St.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0722502100:6"/>Paul</hi>'s <hi>Church-yard,</hi> to which no Phyſician or Surgeon had dar'd to reply, which will amply inſtruct you, how great, how many are the Calamities of the Sick, from our Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheries to them. The moſt infamous of both heartily wiſh, the Government would chaſtiſe and reform us; but who will call on the Magiſtrate, who do not know their own Loſſes, and Pains, and Danger, and are ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the numberleſs Forgeries of the Apoſtate Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Surgeons, united with the innumerable Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries their Maſters, and the Governours of the Families?</p>
            <p>Your College Diſcourſes have no other Deſign, but the Preſervation of the Royal Family, the Nobility, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and People, by the ſincere and learn'd Practice. The <hi>Diſpenſary Poem,</hi> writ at the Requeſt, and by the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Preſident, and the Majority of the Society, avows the deteſtable Knavery, and the moſt certain great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Ignorance of the Phyſicians, as well of the Medicines, as Diſeaſes. The Surgeons muſt be in the ſame Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances with you.</p>
            <p>On Saturday Morning, a great part of my Pariſh, of the Church and Diſſenters, fill'd my Parlour. I obſerv'd a Paleneſs, but a reſolv'd Air in all their Faces, as in the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies puſhing the <hi>French</hi> at <hi>Ramillies.</hi> Their Onſet on the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who neglect the Laws, their Property and Life, and the perfidious Phyſicians and Surgeons, more cruel Enemies than the moſt raging Tyrant, was as brave, and will gain the Victory. Their Language, I perceive, was taken from your Treatiſes, which they had read, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſeriouſly debated: The Proofs of every Article are publiſh'd in them.</p>
            <p>We cry out to you for Juſtice, and our natural and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Right, the Puniſhment and Reformation of the moſt impious Practiſers, who betray the only poſſible Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the young Phyſicians and Surgeons, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bine with the Apothecaries to have us forc'd to take their illegal, unexamin'd, unlicens'd Advice, by the inſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Payments for the Medicines; we are compell'd to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0722502100:7"/>hazard and loſe our Life, imploying them from the intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Expence, and kill the Growth of the Knowledge of the two Profeſſions. You inform'd us from the Pulpit, that Providence is not, and cannot be deficient in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of the greateſt Plenty of all the Neceſſaries to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve Mankind. The Magiſtrate is the Steward, and muſt keep open thoſe Magazines of Bread, the Foods, and all the other neceſſary Supports, and invite us to enjoy our Shares of the vaſt Abundance. Our Government has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly appointed the general Medicines of common and moſt frequent Uſe, to be fold for our Relief, which are all of the cheapeſt Values: In the laſt Age, every Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly knew all thoſe Medicines, how to divide or mix them; what were the low Prices of each. This Privilege is now ſacredly preſerv'd in the other Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> We now are undone, we are plunder'd by the ſcandalous Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of one Hundred Parts more than the juſt common Rates. We have together warily examin'd all the Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars; we avow, the Remedies are in the ſmall Portions of their Doſes cheaper than Bread, and the common Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhments. Our vile Phyſicians and Surgeons are the Contrivers or Abettors of the Cheats of the little Doſes, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of the larger Quantities, which they formerly or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Houſes to buy, and to divide and mix, and uſe in the more eaſie Caſes: we are now pillag'd by them in the Proportions of 40, 50, 100 to one. VVe are forc'd to explain it to you, by a vulgar, but moſt inſtructive Example. If my Phyſician or Surgeon adviſe me to take Old <hi>Malaga</hi> VVine, ſhall they permit me to ſend for it to the Vintner's, at 2 <abbr>
                  <hi>s.</hi>
               </abbr> and 6 <abbr>
                  <hi>d.</hi>
               </abbr> the Quart, or ſhall they add a fulſome Syrup to deceive me, to alter the Colour, to make it more nauſeous and unwholſome? Contrive with the Vintner to ſend it in by his Boys in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minutive Parcels, that the one Quart ſhall draw five Pounds out of me? Do not the Fools engage me to ſtick cloſe to the Vintner and his Boys, and to command them to adviſe us? Since we muſt pay five Guineas for every
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0722502100:8"/>Quart of <hi>Malaga,</hi> we will make them ſave us all their Fees.</p>
            <p>They ſaw me trembling, I was aſſur'd of their Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but they ruſh'd on me with a Rage not to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd to you. I paid ſix Guineas for the Vulgar <hi>Bitter Decoction,</hi> ſent in the ſmall Glaſſes, and the Ingredients were heretofore, and may now be had for one Shilling. The 2 <abbr>
                  <hi>d.</hi>
               </abbr> I paid 30 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> for <hi>Perle Juleps</hi> in 14 Days, when one of them is worth but 8 <abbr>

               </abbr>
               <hi>Venice Treacle, Diaſcordium<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mithridate,</hi> are very cheap in the Pound. I paid two G<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>neas every day, in a long Sickneſs, for the <hi>Dram Boles</hi> of them and the ſmall Draught to waſh them down.

I knew a poor Woman reduc'd to Beggary, by a Crown for every one of many of them every day ſhe was ſick, 'till a Charitable Phyſician made the Cure in a Week, with the Charge of one of them.

            <p>They ſtopt me with the Acclamations of Victory, when the Enemy runs. We have the wicked Phyſicians and Surgeons under our Feet. Our Impeachment of them will require and deſerve your Attention and Patience. Our Government, as in all Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> commanded the College to appoint Medicines for the general Uſe. By this <hi>Book,</hi> the Apothecaries muſt prepare all the Remedies of their Shops. They are, as they muſt be, <hi>perfect Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,</hi> every one fully deſign'd to anſwer the ſeveral Purpoſes, without the Delay and Trouble of Mixture, as far as it is poſſible to contrive them.

They muſt report to us the Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of each of theſe publick, and our Remedies to be us'd. We can mix (as well as in old <hi>England,</hi> and all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nations) the <hi>ſimple,</hi> and the <hi>compound Waters,</hi> the <hi>Spirits</hi> and <hi>Tinctures.</hi> We can divide their Doſes, and of

They are now preſcrib'd by the knaviſh Phyſicians and Surgeons, in Mixtures of very many of them together, only to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe them from our Knowledge, and the Price of the whole. They are parcel'd by their Order into many little ſhamming Doſes, to extort 3 or 4 Guineas a day, when often we have all of them ready in the Cloſet, and the greateſt Expence of them cannot be 3 or 4 Shillings. The Government demands, that we ſhall know the <hi>Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the</hi> 4 or 5 <hi>Cordial Juleps,</hi> now only us'd, and the <hi>

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0722502100:19"/>to ſeize the juſt Informations, and prevent the fatal Effect of any one violently oppoſing the natural Deſigns of the Recovery. But, as the Mob are for ſighting inſtantly, and are well contented, tho' they are beaten, if a great many are killed, our wretched People judge only by the boiſterous Management, with the vaſt Exceſs of the Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom Shots of the Medicines. If one preſumes to give the firſt and the richeſt Cordial, the Proſpect of certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, will you dare go on as you begin, let Nature recover it ſelf. Dr. <hi>R.</hi> and the bluſtering Surgeon, take away all the hope of Recovery at firſt ſight. They ſwear and damn they ſhall die, and ſome do ſo; but when one does well, we magniſie the Cure, and are infinitely pleas'd with the moſt hazardous Eſcape. Thus every <hi>Fever</hi> and <hi>Small Pox,</hi> tho' the Kind, reigning then, may be ſafe, muſt have every two Hours, <hi>ſuch a Quantity of Boles and Draughts, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

The People will not ſee the Dangers they were preſerv'd from, when an equal Proportion remains on the Table. You ſhall hear them lament, that tho' ſeven of the Houſe got over the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> by the honeſt Treatment, they loſt one dear Child, they fear had not all the Remedies could be taken. The judicious Phyſician muſt grievouſly ſuffer, and the poor Patients with him, when <hi>profuſe and frequent Bleedings, the rudeſt Vomits, Cupping</hi> and <hi>Scarifying,</hi> and <hi>much Bliſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and bloody Water and Pain ſhall give the grand Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as the Vulgar cry up <hi>Surgeons from cutting off a Limb, gaſhing, and letting out of a deal of Matter, and trepanning the Skull.</hi> I have lately been aſſur'd by ſeveral Phyſicians, that no Credit can be acquir'd by ſaving the Life of a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, by preventing the deadly Symptoms, by conducting and ſupporting the natural Powers. The healthy Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment and Feaſt is rejected, and the Luxury and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery are the Demonſtration of much Reſpect and Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: tho' the Stomach and the Head terribly ſuffer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0722502100:20"/>and a dreadful Fever follows the Surfeit. The Phyſicians have compell'd me to believe them, that their Fame was uſually advanc'd after the Patients had fall'n by the Load of ungrateful oppreſſive Doſes, the World never knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: That they lamented from their Souls, the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Sick, when the Dr. is every day driven on by the Apothecary, and vehemently drag'd forward by the Attendants to oppoſe the Life, by the half Sheet of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions in every Viſit or many Doſes, and to be pleas'd when the next Day they remain from the Sleep interve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, or the fortunate Averſion of the Patient. When we do not comply with the Importunities for the ſuperfluous Remedies, we muſt trick the fooliſh People, with the <hi>odd ſilly Advices of an Iſſue on the top of the Head, or a Seton, or going to</hi> Bath <hi>or</hi> Turnbridge, <hi>what ever the Diſeaſe is,</hi> when there are very many may be uſed to better purpoſe than two Waters only. Shou'd you at any time diſcover one of the many Deaths, that you loſt your Son by the exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Doſing, or a little impertinent Whimſey of diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Advice, and cry out for Juſtice on the Murthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; you muſt be reprimanded, that you do not conſult the ancient Gentlemen of the oldeſt and wiſeſt Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that you cannot ſee with your own Eyes, that Millions of Children have ſaved themſelves by the fierce Cries, and beating off, and ſpattering out the Boles; that thouſands of old Men and Women had protected their Life to the longeſt Periods, by the Chamber, and Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and the Dread of too many Medicines. But you muſt, with all your Power, maintain the Honour and Diſcipline of the College, which can only, by the mutual Improvements of the learned and faithful Practice, give you the great Standards to judge by. You muſt uſe your Reaſon, the Methods the Government has given you, and not cry out to be help'd, like the careleſs Child, who will be taken up, when he might have kept his Legs, if he pleas'd. If the <hi>Mirmils, Querpoes, Bards,</hi> and the <hi>

            <p>All the Company call'd aloud, we will oppoſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries, the Origine of all our Sufferings, and not pay the Bill of two or three Guineas a day, which we can have in the Quantities for two or three Shillings.</p>

Why do you uſe any Phyſicians, that are not honeſt and juſt to you, do not inform you of the Proviſion of all the Neceſſaries of Life, your Property, and the obvious Skill of adapting them to the frequent Occaſions?

I ſuppoſe they had the diſmal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the vaſt Yearly Payments, of the Death of their Children, of the Defeats in the Tryals with the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries; I heard die Shrieks, and Groans, and Gnaſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Teeth, as in the <hi>Old Baily</hi>; when the Sentence is pronounc'd to the Barr full of Criminals.</p>

They ſhall not, with the moſt abhor'd Perjury, aſſault their own Societies, and deliver to the Apothecary's Ignorance, all the Caſes which can only nouriſh and increaſe their Knowledge, and by the Communications, the Stock of Sience of the two Profeſſions. The Sick formerly were expos'd in the Temples, and the Porches of their Houſes,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0722502100:23"/>to the Views and Advice of all the Spectators, we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compaſs'd only with the Impoſtures of the Apothecaries, the moſt wicked Phyſicians and Surgeons, without the Knowledge of the Goodneſs and Virtues of the Medicines, or the different Circumſtances of our Diſeaſes. We will implore the <hi>Lords Spiritual and Temporal,</hi> to addreſs to the Fountain of Juſtice for the Viſitation of them, and the moſt ſevere Inſpection into the State of the Nation, the Health and Life of the Subjects.</p>
            <p>I was almoſt deter'd from the Purſuit of my Deſign, fearing the Nobility and Gentry would not receive the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and the common People boyſterouſly rage, when aſſur'd, that their eminent Phyſicians and Surgeons, are only the Setters and Sweetners for the Apothecaries to pilfer them, that they have not the Learning and Abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which will preſerve them in any one very dangerous Diſeaſe. But then, the College aſſerts both in many parts of their Remonſtrances, and our moſt Religious and moſt Learned K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. and the Lords of this Council, and all the Judges of <hi>England,</hi> did moſt ſolemnly avow, that, without the one Soverein Remedy, the Profeſſion muſt be more and more corrupted to the Conſumption of all its Virtue and Knowledge. You have try'd many Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines without Succeſs. Your College, and the Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Company, muſt humbly addreſs to her Majeſty, who derives all the Royal Virtues from your great Patron, K. <hi>Charles</hi> I.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0722502100:24"/>ſcorn and defie all the Objections the deluded <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen can invent. Are they more wiſe than the King? Have they more Honour than the Lords of the Council in that Reign? Is not the moſt profound Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Judges, at that time, admir'd in this? To come cloſe to my Adverſaries, your College demonſtrated, that the Profeſſion of Phyſick muſt be deſtroy'd, when the Apothecaries are ſuffer'd to intrude into the Chambers of the Sick, leaving their Station and Duties of preparing, and carefully delivering the Medicines in the Shop, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Reward, but what they contrive out of the Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Dearneſs of the Doſes. Their Numbers force them to ſuggeſt all the Forgeries imaginable, to cry up that ſort of Phyſicians, who ſhall fatally deceive the People, ſupport their moſt abſurd and pernicious Advices, and juſtifie and improve the Profit from the many and dear Medicines. They muſt cry down the other ſort, who ſhall caution them for the future, againſt the unexamin'd, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate Pretenders, and maintain the Property of the Uſe of the publick Remedies, and preſerve their Knowledge of the ſmall Prices of the moſt generous Medicines.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty and the Council, allow'd the cleareſt: and the greateſt Truth.</p>
            <p>You then proceed to avow; that it is the greateſt Folly, that God has not afflicted Mankind with the Permiſſion of any more deadly Infatuation, than to take an Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Judgment, in the tender or furious<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Begining of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, whoſe Capacity was never examin'd, to force him to pay himſelf what he pleaſes, 1, 2, 3 <abbr>

               </abbr> a Day, by the Number of the Doſes, and the fraudulent Prices, when all the Parts of the Univerſe have obſerv'd, that many ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Diſeaſes paſs off by the Strength of Nature, aſſiſted or not diſorder'd, and that the largeſt Part of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines of our own Growth, are, and muſt be of the loweſt Rates. But that the unhappy People will eaſily be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd on by the Impoſtures of no Efficacies in the moſt plentiful, of the few pretended to be dear, being mix'd
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0722502100:25"/>in every thing they ſhall take, eſpecially when the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jur'd Phyſicians are ready to vouch all the Articles of the Forgery.</p>
            <p>Your College then, with a Generoſity never to be pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel'd, confeſs'd, that the Phyſicians Knowledge of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes was almoſt loſt; that by treacherouſly commending every Practice of the Apothecaries, they were by degrees, more and more neglected; that the Diſeaſe is broken from the natural Types every day, by the improper and hourly intruded Remedies, that preſcribing in that Confuſion of the genuine and unnatural Symptoms, they can never judge of the Diſeaſe: That their Violations of the Laws of Phyſick muſt deſtroy all the Patients, unleſs the natural Vigour is able to oppoſe them, and perform the Cure.</p>
            <p>The Phyſicians muſt loſe all the Knowledge of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, not able to diſcern the beſt from the moſt So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſticate, not commend or reject the Uſe of them in the moſt hazardous Caſes, and not diſtinguiſh the true Qualites and Virtues, or judge of the Operations, when they conſpire with the Apothecaries to blend together, with the moſt fatal Inhumanity to the Sick, the perfect, complete Remedies, deſign'd to be us'd in their full Power, unmix'd. The Confuſion of them confounds and breaks the Efficacy to be rely'd on. This muſt be the great Art and Myſtery of the Practice to kill and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literate the Peoples Diſcernment of their Prices, and their Application of them in the more eaſie and frequent Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers. The Apothecaries will inſult the Phyſician's Ignorance, will affront them, if they pry into the Secrets of the Shop, and obſerve the ſingle unmix'd Medicines there, will reject the Preſcription, which ſhall give the unuſual Trouble of Preparation, in the place of the Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, always ready to be clapt together, will command the Phyſicians, fearing their Diſpleaſure, never to examine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Qualities or Virtues of any Simple, or contrive any more rational Preparation, or bring to the Teſt, any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly or lately publiſh'd. They will demand in all the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0722502100:26"/>Houſes they govern, their faithful Aſſurance, that they will decry all the Improvements of the Learning in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in the publick Laboratory of the College or their own, and report it Scandalous to reflect, what Medicines their Patients ſhall take.</p>
            <p>When the Phyſicians of more cultivated Learning and Experience, ſhall with Reluctance betray their Patients, the Apothecaries will ſelect the poor and neceſſitous, and daring Impudence of the Novices, who have not had the Obſervations of Diſeaſes or Remedies to compare and form a juſt Judgment of. Theſe muſt unite and blaſt the Phyſicians of long Practice and Diſcernment of the Succeſſes of the various Methods of Cure, whoſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions and Cautions can only educate and raiſe to Perfection the Crude Attempts of the Practice lately begun. They ſhall never or after the Deſtruction of many of the Sick begin to correct their Errors, and fear there may be more rational ways of treating the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes and better Medicines to be employ'd.</p>
            <p>His Majeſty, and the Lords of the Council, and the Judges were pleas'd to allow the moſt neceſſary Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences in the Art of Phyſick, and in all other Profeſſions, and therefore determined to diſſolve the Apothecaries Company, to appoint the competent Number in the City. The Application was prevented by the Rebellion breaking forth ſoon after.</p>
            <p>Your College generouſly imitates your Learned and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Spirited Predeceſſors: You have preſented to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and Gentry the boldeſt Diſcovery of the Ignorance of the Phyſicians in all the Diſeaſes and Medicines. You aſſert that <hi>the great Enquiries are no more,</hi> and by a large variety in the firſt and laſt Pages you endeavour to convince them, <hi>that the Profeſſion</hi> (and the Surgeons cannot be ſecluded,) <hi>has no Honour or Conſcience, no Deſign or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, or Ability to procure Health and Life.</hi> It will be unpreſidented to admit Dr. R., <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to enter their Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>I know our Gentlemen are proud of their Wit and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements from Converſation, and fancy that Divinity, Law and Phyſick are learned by Rote and by the Ear, and in good Company. Becauſe ſome uſeful, many very ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Inventions have entertain'd the Age, they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, that it excells all the preceding times. All before us were nothing to us. The <hi>French,</hi> they ſay, conquer'd the Iſland in the Reign of our King <hi>Henry,</hi> V. the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> ſubdued us in 88, that the Reformers of our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had no Learning, that the Judges and the Lawyers were not regarded, that they had then no Phyſick: That we are wiſer than all the World beſide, and have more Courage and Bravery, that they would conquer the <hi>French</hi> ſooner, without any Allies. Tho' our preſent Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans are not inſtructed by the Profeſſors in the Univerſity, nor by any one ever after at all wiſer than themſelves, tho' they pretend to little Study and Diligence, value them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on the general Learning, preliminary only to, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enter all the Profeſſions, or are very elaborate in Trifles nothing to their Purpoſe, they aſſume a Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter they have no Pretence to, a Grandeur and Luſtre to cover the Crimes, of which you accuſe them. I am therefore oblig'd to deduce the Hiſtory of Phyſick from its Original, out of your Books, and the Comments on them to the almoſt total Corruption and Death of it in our Age. The Records are authentick, your Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons moſt juſt, that the noiſy Admirers of the Modern Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments ſhall be forc'd to confeſs their Folly and repair the Weakneſs of their Underſtanding.</p>
            <p>The firſt Labours and Induſtry of Mankind were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercis'd in diſcovering the Fruits, and Grains, and Fountains, the grateful and preſent Remedies of Hunger and Thirſt, then in diſcovering the Caverns of Rocks, and building, in imitation of them, their Securities and Defences from the Cold and the Ravages of the Beaſts of Prey, till they
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0722502100:28"/>had learnt from them to aſſault and deſtroy their own kind. The firſt Surfeits and Pains, and Fevers, Bruiſes and wounds, rais'd their moſt eager Affections to relieve, and the moſt unwearied Solicitudes to find the Medicines, which ſhould be able in the parallel Dangers to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The Plants they had taſted in their ſearches after Food, and had rejected from their Qualities and Vertues more powerfully affecting the Palate and the Stomach, were inſtantly demanded and apply'd. The natural Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings and Inſtincts of the Patients were heard and regar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, the Averſions and Antipathies were moſt warily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd and recorded. The obſervations of the various Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes were made in the view and Inqueſt of all the little Communities, and preſerved for the uſe of Poſterity. When the ſmall Governments increaſt and multiply'd to Kingdoms and Empires, the Medical Knowledge of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting and curing Diſeaſes was proportionably extended. The firſt moſt populous Countries were therefore moſt famous from the Improvements of Phyſick, before all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Arts. <hi>Apollo</hi> therefore and <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> were immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliz'd as the greateſt Benefactors, from the great Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Science, which preſerves Life: they were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor'd in their Temples, where all the Healthy and Diſeas'd made their daily Sacrifices for their Protection and Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Many of the other Deities were neglected, there was no City, where <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> was not addreſt to for his Inſpirations and Communications of the moſt Sovereign Medicines. This alone was the Profeſſion, which engag'd the moſt indefatigable Induſtry of all the Princes of both Sexes, of all the Nobility, of the moſt ſagacious Popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, till after many Ages, a great Magazine of Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all Diſeaſes, and their moſt prevalent Remedies had been collected, and the Application committed to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduous Practiſers of the Science. Can it be doubted, that it was in many Centuries advane'd to the greateſt Height and Honours, when the Patients and Obſervations innumerable had made infinite Records of all things inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0722502100:29"/>to Health, of the unhappy and moſt proſperous E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of Millions of Attempts in all the different Diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and their Symptomes. They then had from the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of Nature, the good Sence the <hi>Engliſh</hi> have now loſt and cannot recover, to deſire in the firſt Invaſions of the moſt deadly Enemies, the moſt celebrated and moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>par'd Adviſer? Navigation and Commerce communicated from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and from <hi>Egypt</hi> to the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the differences of Diſeaſes, the various Methods to attempt the Recoveries. <hi>Hippocrates</hi> is not the firſt Writer of Antiquity, he records many before him. There were many thouſand of Diſcourſes of Diſeaſes, and Medicines to furniſh his admirable Collection, and the moſt ſublime Philoſophy, of the Motions of our Nature, to relieve it ſelf from the Violences of Diſeaſes, and in the Progreſs of them, and of the moſt powerful Succours of its Allies, the Operations of the Medicines, as many thouſand Poets flouriſh'd before <hi>Homer,</hi> who inflam'd his Emulation to ſurpaſs them in his Poems, which have never been imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated or equall'd. The moſt neceſſary Art was purſu'd with the greateſt Ardour through many Ages, till <hi>Galen</hi> in the moſt eloquent and learned Volumes, collected the Hiſtories of all the Diſeaſes, which can afflict us, and almoſt all the Remedies, which are able to repell them. Our Gentlemen will rave at my Aſſertion, but I aſſert, that the Genius of Antiquity (when Human Nature was rais'd to its greateſt Elevation, when the Governments were ſecur'd by the moſt equal and wiſeſt Laws, when the Courage and Arts of Invaſion and Defence, when the Buildings of Magnificence and Uſe, the Hiſtories, Poetry, Oratory, Painting, Statuary and Muſick, and all the other Entertainments of Life ſurpaſs our juſt Compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, as they explode our pretences to imitation) could not be wanting or defective in advancing the Profeſſion of conquering the moſt deadly and ſtubborn Diſeaſes to its greateſt Perfection. The Gentlemen, who do not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand me, will pelt me with moſt terrible Objections: I
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0722502100:30"/>muſt in the firſt place requeſt them to conſider moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dately and maturely the moſt important Affair they have ever examin'd and refer them to the moſt inſtructive Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on your College Publications. There are not many Diſtempers, which are not largely treated of in the Writings of the Antients. But they give the moſt neceſſary, the infallible Rudiments, the only firm and ſolid Foundations, on which alone the Superſtructure can be rais'd; all the different Symptomes of Diſeaſes our Nature can be affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted with, all their neceſſary Conſequences and Events, which will paſs off by the Natural Efforts alone, and which of them require the moſt tender Treatments or the moſt vigorous Oppoſitions. As the <hi>General</hi> does not learn to conquer one Enemy and one Army, to beſiege one Fortification only: Nor the <hi>Maſter</hi> to conduct the Ship into one Port, and govern it in the Storms of one Seaſon of the Year. Had they great Plenty of the Medicines? They were Maſters of the Knowledge of the Qualities and Preparations of all the Plants the Univerſe produces. Is a ſmall Pittance pretended to be lately diſcover'd? How vaſt a Number of theirs are known only by their Names? their Properties and Uſes are now neglected, baniſh'd from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Enquiries and Practice? Our People fooliſhly fond of the ſufficiency of the Moderns, will be angry our Phyſicians ſhall be commanded to conſult <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes, Diaſcorides, Galen.</hi> They have poſſeſs'd, engroſt all the immenſe Wealth of Knowledge in their Treaſury. They are the Originals and Maſter-pieces, which we muſt copy after and labour to imitate. We muſt obey the immutable Laws of Nature they have publiſh'd, and every Devia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the moſt perfect is erroneous and abſurd, and in the preſent Caſe fatal to Life. They were examin'd, approv'd, authoriz'd by all the Nations in many ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Ages; the Diſeas'd muſt dye, if they cannot be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and preſerv'd by them. Shall any one conceit, that the Preparations of their Medicines were not then the moſt exquiſite? Did they take care of their Bread and Wine
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0722502100:31"/>only? Did they exceed us in all the Incentives of Luxury and Debauchery, and neglect the moſt potent Preſervers and Reſtorers of Life? Their Medicines were prepar'd in the greateſt degrees of Perfection, not enervated or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſt by the impudent Fallacy to amuſe and defraud the Sick, not the colluſive Preſcripts, void of all Virtue and Efficacy to delude, not the raging and violent, waſting and conſuming the Blood and Spirits they pretend to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. The Patients had all the natural mixture of their Powers and Operations in the Subſtance, or in the Extracts, or the admir'd innumerable Infuſions in their Wines or other Liquors. But the Art, as the Life it defends, after Maturity declines from its Beauty and Vigour. The Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, Emulation, and rapacious Avarice of Phyſicians corrupted it. The Diſeaſes, the moſt terrible, had been frequently cur'd, and Life extended to the longeſt Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods, but in Pain, in the dreaded Dangers, the ſolicitude for a greater, for a new Medicine, more vigorous they fancy in the firſt Invention, gave the Honours to all the Innovations, the giddy Deſertions from, and the impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Affronts to all the eſtabliſh'd and conſtant Succeſſes of the general Uſe. The <hi>Grecians</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted by barbarous Nations they were prevented by their Calamities, from debaſing their Phyſick by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate Demands, and therefore indefatigable Purſuits of their Phyſicians, after the endleſs Novelties of Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. The Proſperity of the <hi>Arabians</hi> unhappily deſtroy'd the natural ſincere Practice, the Contagion from them ſpread into <hi>Europe.</hi> Our Age ſuſpects, becauſe the <hi>Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> was lately apply'd to direct our Navigation, that the Ancients had no Ships, or Commerce: becauſe <hi>Printing</hi> was not long ſince invented, that they knew not the Art of Writing; that they made War with Clubs and Stones, for want of our Powder and Artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery. It muſt be repeated, as the firſt and greateſt Point in the Controverſie, that the <hi>Eaſtern Nations,</hi> the <hi>Greci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> and the <hi>Romans,</hi> who excell'd the <hi>Moderns</hi> in all things
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0722502100:32"/>of <hi>Neceſſity</hi> and <hi>Grandeur,</hi> has all the moſt rational <hi>Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Infuſions</hi> and <hi>Decoctions,</hi> all the <hi>Extracts,</hi> the <hi>Artifices</hi> of all the <hi>Balſams</hi> and <hi>Ointments,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Externals</hi> for all the various Purpoſes; that they were able to comprehend the two firſt and greateſt Laws of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, that the Remedy, whoſe Qualities and Virtues have been examin'd, and confim'd by the Experience of repeated Succeſs, muſt be given to the Patient without the Load and Incumbrance of many Ingredients of uncertain, of ſuſpected, of contrary Qualities, but only to convey the great Specifick more pleaſantly to the Palate and Stomach, to bribe the one, and fortifie the other, to receive the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for the whole Body. The other Inſtance of their Wiſdom and Fidelity, demands our Gratitude and Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As the <hi>Fruits</hi> muſt be eaten before they are dead and rotten; <hi>Bread,</hi> before it is dry and mouldy; <hi>Fleſh,</hi> without Salt, and dry'd in the Smoak; when the newly prepar'd is moſt agreeable to the Taſte, and Appetite, and Digeſtion. In this manner, were the Remedies then ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred: the great Specifick, which governs the Cure, (by altering and reducing the obſerv'd vicious Intempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Blood and Spirits) or inſtantly powder'd, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly extracted, infus'd, or decocted, the entire unevapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Powers were preſented to the Sick. But the hot and reſtleſs <hi>Arabians,</hi> with the parallel Folly of rejecting the noble Models of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Architecture, 'till they know the Elements of Marble; the Nature of the Cement, all the Qualities of the Iron Tools; with the Madneſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to ſail, to acquire the Wiſdom and Wealth of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Nations; 'till they have diſputed on, and reſolv'd the Cauſes of the Winds, and of the Ebbing and Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sea, loſt the Subſtance for the Shadow, heated one another with the never-ceaſing Diſputes concerning the Cauſes and Modes of all the Operations of, and on the Humours of the Body, when the firſt are felt and diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red by a thouſand Signs, and the other are obvious to all our Senſes. The <hi>Churchmen</hi> were more early corrupting
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0722502100:33"/>in the ſame manner, <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Morality,</hi> by their end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Controverſies, to adjuſt the plaineſt Truths to the Notions of <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> But to return to the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines; the <hi>Arabians</hi> inſulted, and affronted all the moſt faithful Obſervations of the great Effects of the moſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and rational Preparations, and impos'd on their Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Nobility and People, the moſt abſurd and ſophiſtica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, deſir'd for their Novelty by the Imagination debauch'd by the aſſum'd grater Induſtry and Penetration of the Impoſtors. Theſe could not be ſtop'd in their Career of Riches and Glory, to be acquir'd by the new Faſhions of Medicines: They ſtrove to outdo one another, vitiating and deſtroying the genuine Preparations and Mixtures of the Sovereign Simples, by their newly diſcover'd <hi>ſimple</hi> and <hi>compound Waters,</hi> and <hi>Conſerves,</hi> and <hi>Syrups.</hi> The obvious Frauds of the Craft, prompted and incited their Dillgence, to invent <hi>many Thouſand new Waters, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, and Syrups.</hi> To prepare theſe, there muſt be a <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Apothecaries,</hi> they and the Phyſicians unite, in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federacy, all their Forces, to damn and decry all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded Remedies: The new, tho' infinite, will not ſubſiſt them without Deceit, and the Artifices of mending the Trade. An <hi>Arabian Prince and Phyſician</hi> had his Army peſter'd with another Army of <hi>Apothecaries,</hi> as numerous. He reſolv'd to leſſen their Numbers, by ſeparating the Honeſt from the Knaves. He appointed an unintelligible Jargon of inſignificant Words, to be publiſh'd as a Receit of a general Remedy; many Thouſands undertook to prepare it, were detected buſie in the compounding it, and were diſcarded. 'Tis now time to return to <hi>Europe,</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> to obſerve how we have been, and how we are treated at this time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>France, Spain, Germany, Great Britain,</hi> had from the <hi>Phenicians</hi> firſt, then the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans,</hi> (beyond their own Diſcoveries in common with all the other parts of the World) the Obſervations of the various Diſeaſes, the Uſe of the moſt natural and rational Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0722502100:34"/>eſtabliſh'd by Preſcription of conſtant uſe. When the <hi>Mahometans</hi> conquer'd <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Greece,</hi> the diſtreſs'd Nobility and Gentry, and the learned fled for Refuge into <hi>Italy,</hi> then barbarous, after its Subjection to the wild Northern Invaders. The Princes, who receiv'd them with the greateſt Humanity, had the ample Reward, the <hi>Communication of the</hi> Grecian <hi>Learing. Printing</hi> was at that time invented. Who is able to expreſs. with what Ardour and indefatigable Induſtry, all the Parts of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing were in that <hi>Century</hi> cultivated by them? The <hi>Britains,</hi> the <hi>French,</hi> the <hi>Germans</hi> travell'd to <hi>Italy,</hi> (as the old Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers into the <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Egypt</hi>) to collect the ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Riches of all Literature from the Profeſſors. Theſe Merchants return'd with the Cargoes of the Wealth of Knowledge of <hi>Philoſophy, Phyſick, Surgery,</hi> the <hi>Anatomy</hi> almoſt finiſh'd by the Ancients, their <hi>Pharmacy of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines,</hi> which ſcorns and deſpiſes all the Modern Pretenſions to alter or improve it. <hi>France</hi> firſt, then <hi>Germany,</hi> reapt the great Harveſt and Plenty, from the Seed receiv'd from the <hi>Italians.</hi> But the <hi>Germans</hi> confin'd, during the long and frozen Winters, to their Stoves, outdid the <hi>Arabians,</hi> worrying all the <hi>Minerals, Animals</hi> and <hi>Plants,</hi> into ten Thouſand Preparations of <hi>Spirits, Oils, Tinctures</hi> and <hi>Salts.</hi> Their <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> heated into Phrenzies by their Fires, ſwore every one of their Medicines would cure ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Hundred of Diſeaſes at the firſt taking, in few Drops, or 3 or 4 Grains. The <hi>Italians</hi> and <hi>French</hi> invade them in their turns, with fierce and numerous Armies of hard and unintelligible Notions, then with the <hi>Atomical</hi> Solu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of every thing, tho' above the Sence and Reaſon of Mankind to comprehend. The <hi>Mechanicks</hi> have ſince come into the <hi>Farce.</hi> The People, they imagine, will have the ſureſt Confidence in their Advice and Medicines, when one ſort of the Operators ſhew the minute indiviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Corpuſcles of their ſick Humors, and of the Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and the other undertake every thing by the Laws of Motion, by Meaſure and Weight. <hi>Great Britain</hi> in its
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0722502100:35"/>Order had, as its Manufacture and Trade, the Ancient and Modern Learning imported from Abroad. Our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Univerſities had their Profeſſors from <hi>Italy;</hi> the Court and Nobility, their Phyſicians from <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> Our moſt Learned and Magnanimous King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. Eſtabliſh'd by <hi>Act of Parliament,</hi> the <hi>College</hi> of <hi>Phyſicians:</hi> Your <hi>Royal College,</hi> compos'd of Phyſicians from the two Univerſities prepar'd by their Profeſſors, in a City, which furniſhes innumerable Caſes of all Diſeaſes, and the ſureſt Methods of Cure, and moſt juſt Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Effects of the Medicines, could not fail to emulate the Glory of the Univerſities of <hi>Paris, Montpelier,</hi> and of <hi>Italy</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi> The frequent Lectures and Conſultations, and Converſations of ſo many learned Phyſicians, improv'd the Stock of Learning, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of the Society. Who can want to be inform'd, how much our <hi>Great Britain</hi> has rais'd its Fame equal to its Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals by Dr. <hi>Linacre, Caius, Goulſton,</hi> the <hi>immortal Harvey, Hamey, Gliſſon, Wharton, Scarborough, Miclethwayte, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jean, Bates, Willis, Lower, Sydenham?</hi> Theſe Phyſicians were capable to aſſiſt and inſtruct one the other; the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter often enrich'd with the moſt valued Materials, with which he raiſes the Structure of his Treatiſes and Fame. The moſt difficult Profeſſion in the World cannot be created by the vain ridiculous Preſumptions of any one Impoſtor. They were then as grave as the Judges, and as learned as the Biſhops; their Modeſty equal to the vaſt Extent of their Kowledge of all the Languages and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors. Nothing could eſcape their early and indefatigable Purſuits: After the general Learning of the Languages and Philoſophy, neceſſary to all the Profeſſions, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors exacted from them the Task of peruſing carefully <hi>Hippocrates, Diaſcorides, Galen,</hi> the Sacred Oracles of the Art, and compare with them the Comments of the late celebrated Authors: But our Phyſician is a Novice, knows not one Diſeaſe nor Medicine from the Books alone, as a thouſand Books cannot deſcribe a Face to be certainly
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0722502100:36"/>known, nor make the Colour, Taſt, and ſtrength of any one Wine judg'd of without Errour. They were there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore introduc'd into Practice by the Profeſſors and other Phyſicians of Experience, prudently obſerving the preſent State, the Symptomes, the Progreſs, and the Criſes of every Diſeaſe. They were commanded to make all the uſual Preparations, to examine in their Laboratories, the Qualities and Virtues of all the Remedies. Common Sence and the Experience and Uſage of Mankind inform us, that all the Arts of Difficulty, and the higheſt Importance muſt be taught by the Maſter and Inſtructor. Can there be any <hi>General, Admiral, Merchant,</hi> any excellent Artiſt without this neceſſary Education; and the Maſter is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly improv'd, while he is offering his beſt prepar'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions? But how forcible is the Neceſſity, to revive the neglected Methods of ripening the knowledge of the <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> who are as the <hi>Surgeons,</hi> the <hi>ſupreme General,</hi> and Judge, the Patient muſt forfeit his Life from his Errour and want of Conduct?</p>
            <p>How many Patients muſt they deſtroy, before they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to ſuſpect, they have err'd in the Judgment of the Courſe of the Diſeaſe, or the juſt fitneſs of the Remedy for the Caſe and Conſtitution? But your College ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declares, that the preſent Phyſicians, (who never had Profeſſors, nor read the Authors, nor learnt the Langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, nor ever had any Guide or Director in the firſt or lateſt Practice) know not one Diſeaſe or Medicine. A great Number of the moſt elevated ſtation of Quality are of the ſame Mind, and you have all moſt ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd it. A <hi>Surgeon</hi> in Print publiſhes, that his Art has had no Improvements, has loſt the Knowledge and Uſe of many the moſt excellent Methods and Operations practis'd by the Ancients. All the modeſt Surgeons avow with the Phyſicians, the Ignorance of their preſent Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, and the publick, as for you, are not wanting in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the certainty. But <hi>our impudent Phyſicians and Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> pretend to great Sence, to great Cures, and they alone
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0722502100:37"/>demand to be excepted from the common and general Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions or Accuſations. They dread they are undone, if our People ſhall be willing to learn (which the Comments on your Diſcourſes demonſtrate) that the ſtrength of the Life deſign'd for old Age cannot be overcome by every Gentleman's Surfeits and Debauchery, and every one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Diſcretion of a Fool, wou'd remark, how many <hi>Fevers</hi> and <hi>Small-Pox,</hi> and the <hi>uſual incidental Diſorders</hi> are heal'd by <hi>Nature alone,</hi> by <hi>Reſt, Abſtinence,</hi> and the <hi>uſe only of the general Cordials.</hi> Theſe are Dr. <hi>R.</hi> and the other Phyſicians Cures, whoſe great Fidelity and Dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity are confin'd to the crafty magnifying of thoſe high Performances, when the Patient had the good Fortune to eſcape the many Neglects, and the many Errors, and the fooliſh or vile Medicines they employ. Our moſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Surgeons are now detected, by the more modeſt and qualify'd, moſt erroneous in their Judgments, unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate in their Operations, tho' there are many, they dare not undertake.

Our eminent Phyſicians and Surgeons are notoriouſly engag'd in the Conſpiracy to deſtroy them by their own, and the future Ignorance of all the Phyſicians and Surgeons, when they betray the College and their Company; the Lectures, the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive Communications, and the great Advances from the mutual Knowledge of all the Members.

Your College has been lately oblig'd to reject from both, when the Candidates had not the leaſt pretence to any degree of Merit. Your Examinations have neceſſarily abated the Rigour of your Statutes, to comply with the Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of the new Phyſicians. If the Profeſſors are excu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable, they will plead; that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are mad and will employ a young Phyſician of inexpreſſible Impudence, who ſwears, he is above and ſcorns the Profeſſors Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, or any other Councils and Helps of any Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician of long Experience in the World, and that all the Practicers of great Learning and Obſervation are Fools to him, that he can never Kill a Patient, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the new Projects of Diſeaſes, and the lately faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Medicines; that he pretends every Day new Projects of Diſeaſes, and will give the Remedies in a way peculiar to himſelf, never thought of before him. Dr. <hi>R.</hi> claims the Precedence of this new way of treating the Patients, when he had paſt his Time many Years merrily, and had the firſt initiating ſmatterings of Learning, in common with every one beſide: <hi>T. A.</hi> an Apothecary, who never knew, nor had one good Medicine, the Profeſſor and Leader of the Youngſters, advis'd him to drink with the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0722502100:39"/>Tutors, and over the Bottle with them cry down and banter all the Phyſicians of Judgment and Experience. Will they call you to their Pupils, or the Gentlemen of the Country uſe you, if you allow the Profeſſor and the other Learned Phyſicians, to be better than your ſelf? T. <hi>A.</hi> at the ſame time, plaid his part, and aſſur'd the Tutor's eaſie to be impos'd on, and the Gentlemen's Grooms, and that all the other Doctors were rid out, and they could now have him only in the preſent Difficulty. When he was mounted the Stage, it was a pleaſant Part to perſwade, that he was the only good Phyſician of the Age, and had then, all the Knowledge he would ever pretend to; that he was then above all others, and even then equal to himſelf. This I avow to all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen, carries its own Evidence in all the Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Profeſſions of Hazard and Moment. Another of the more pale and ſullen Impudence, ſhews his <hi>Skele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> is the greateſt Dr. on the Earth the firſt Year, blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemes the Profeſſor in all his Companies, beſpatters all the other Phyſicians, is forc'd to run away, deludes the greateſt Quality to imagine, the little Sonnets in Latin beſpeak a Man able to allay the moſt furious Vehemence of Diſeaſes. But can the Phyſicians, that drink hard, and theſe Poets, take all the Underſtanding from all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? There is a more potent and latent Cauſe, which the College in its Remonſtrance, has diſcover'd to us, fully explain'd in its Commentaries. When King <hi>James</hi> I. made the Apothecaries a Company, the greateſt part of the Phyſicians were <hi>Gentlemen of Integrity,</hi> poſſeſs'd of all the Acquiſitions of Learning, of Diſeaſes and Medicines, by the moſt unwearied Induſtry and Study, and their Modeſty applying in all Caſes of Difficulty to the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, the experienc'd Officers of the Art to lead and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct them, increas'd their Skill and their Courage, fluſh'd them with frequent Victories.

Your vicious Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, many of them your Preſidents, have fruſtated all your generous Attempts to relieve the Nation; the <hi>lewd Atheiſts
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0722502100:43"/>of the Surgeons</hi> have broken all the great Deſigns of that Company. But the thinking and the ſuffering Gentlemen cry out, if the Phyſicians would unite, if the Surgeons would unite, they can ſave us and their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions: But all the <hi>villanous Phyſicians and Surgeons are united;</hi> they are the major part of both Societies, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to ſacrifice the Publick for their preſent Glory and Advantages. Since therefore, the weigthty Cauſe of the Properties and Life of all the Subjects will be brought before <hi>her Majeſty in Council,</hi> and Viſitors appointed to repel the Violences of the Apothecaries and their Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and Surgeons, and their Allowance of, and exacting the Obſervance of 2 or 3 neceſſary Statutes, will preſerve us: I deſign to move all my Brethren to ſolicite the <hi>Lords Spiritual,</hi> to introduce it to <hi>Her Majeſty.</hi> I am oblig'd to collect the irreſiſtible Proofs you produce, that the Phyſicians and Surgeons know no more than the common general Medicines, that they deſtroy the Sick by the Numbers of the Doſes of the worſt of them now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt only advis'd; that they have not the Knowledge of the Qualities and Virtues of any of the Specifick Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, neceſſary in the great Caſes of Danger, that the People therefore are deſtroy'd by them in the Diſeaſes, their Nature alone would expel, and cannot be preſerv'd, wanting the great Aſſiſtance or Controulers of the natural Motions in Diſeaſes. You ſupport me, profeſſing, that the <hi>Art is turn'd into a ſcandalous Craft, that the Phyſicians are Homicides.</hi> How ſhall I be able, in the narrow ſpace I have confin'd my ſelf to, that the Gentlemen may ſee, without much Trouble, that Dr. <hi>R.</hi> and the eminent Phyſicians and Surgeons, can only pretend to the Title of Witty and Crafty Homicides?</p>
            <p>I will therefore recollect and fortify the Articles of Impeachment, and conclude with the neceſſary Methods, you muſt purſue, that the Enemies to the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and the Nation, may on the Promiſe and Proſpect of their Reformation, be pardon'd, or receive the Puniſhments
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0722502100:44"/>they deſerve. In the firſt Collection of Laws, the Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of Killing precedes that of Stealing. I am oblig'd to invert that order, becauſe the Apothecaries and their Phyſicians and Surgeons deſign only to pilfer from, and ſtrip the Patients; it was in the beginning Conſequential, that the Sick were deſtroy'd; but its now inevitable, the Artiſts having been train'd up and educated to the cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary Practice, and have not the Knowledge of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and the true Medicines to ſave the Life, tho' they moſt ardently deſir'd it. I will promiſe for my Flock, and will engage for my Brethren the Clergy, that they ſhall call out Thieves in all the Families, and put them on their Guard, and direct them, to defend themſelves. How adſurd and impious is it to imagine, that Providence has not given us all the neceſſary Medicines to preſerve us? That the wealthy and prodigal are alone provided for? The Fields and Gardens, and the large Cargoes of the imported Simples, oppoſe and confute the heedleſs Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors. The <hi>Frauds of Phyſick,</hi> and <hi>all your Publications,</hi> demonſtrate the great Plenty and Cheapneſs in all the Particulars.</p>
            <p>The Government will command the Apothecaries to make their Defence, and clearly prove, (which they dare not undertake) that more than five or ſix only do exceed the value of one Peny in the Portion of their Uſe, and that they are Richer in their Virtues. Every Family in <hi>England</hi> was able to ſupport the great Truth by their Teſtimony, when their Cloſets were ſtor'd with the Remedies for themſelves, and their generous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to all their Neighbours, the ſame Remedies, which are now ſham'd on them under the Cover and Diſguiſe of the more unwholſome Mixture. When a malignant Fever, or Peſtilential threatned the common Safety, the Munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Nobility and Gentry, provided for the People the moſt powerful <hi>Alexipharmicks</hi> to arm them againſt, and expel the Enemy: The large Quantities of them did not riſe to any higher Rate, than that of the now frequent

The Magiſtrates at this time, have no Concern, whether the Poor are ſtarv'd or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done in every Diſeaſe. Let us have the great Medicines to ſave our Life, coſt what they will. But their Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is equally pitiable, and muſt be releiv'd. You have demonſtrated, that our eminent Phyſicians and Surgeons
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0722502100:46"/>have not the Knowledge of the truly efficacious Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, and they dare not make any Defence.

What excellent Medicines are theſe, which are not to offend, tho they pretend to no Activity and Qualities which ſhall oppoſe the Diſtemper? The <hi>Diſtill'd Waters</hi> of almoſt no Taſt, made <hi>comfortable to the Stomach,</hi> with a ſmall Addition of a <hi>Cordial Water.</hi> The <hi>Powders</hi> are not to moleſt the Stomach or Blood, by any kind of Virtues or Operations.

You inform us, that the Apothecaries have prevail'd on the Nobility and Gentry, to permit, <hi>that the Eyes of the Phyſicians and Surgeons to pluck'd forth, their Tongues pull'd out, and their Hands cut off.</hi> By long Uſage, Dr. <hi>R.</hi> and the others have been <hi>gelt,</hi> made <hi>Eunuchs,</hi> after the Manners of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Empires, that they ſhall not propagate and preſerve the Race of the Medicines, which will too ſoon, and effectually cure the Patients, to the great Trouble and Detriment of the Apothecaries, gaining the 2 or 3 Guineas a day by the inſtantaneous Mixture of the <hi>Waters</hi> Into <hi>Draughts,</hi> and the <hi>Conſerves</hi> and <hi>Syrups</hi> into <hi>Boles.</hi> What ſort of Gentlemen will haſtily object, that they may write them out of the Books, and, when the Patient have taken them twenty four Hours, come and conſider what has been the Effects and Qualities? If they tranſcribe the <hi>Huddles</hi> and <hi>Jargons</hi> of the Compoſitions, they ſhall <hi>never know the Smell, and Taſte, and Powers of any one.</hi> But they dare not preſcribe more than 3 or 4 <hi>Decoctions,</hi> the <hi>Sweating,</hi> the <hi>Bitter,</hi> the <hi>Pectoral,</hi> the <hi>Emulſions</hi> by Roat and Memory, and almoſt the ſame in every Diſeaſe and Conſtitution, if they

How much the Health and Life of the poor Patients ſuffer from the Idleneſs and Ignorance of the modiſh Adviſers, exacted with ſo much Cruelty by their Maſters the Apothecaries, will appear to all Mankind, who ſhall diſtinctly conſider the <hi>Energies and Properties of the ſix Claſſes of the Remedies.</hi> They are the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, Sweet, Acid, Bitter, Aſtringent, Acrid.</hi> Under theſe are a vaſt Diverſity at <hi>Energies</hi> and <hi>Properties</hi> compriz'd. There are many of the <hi>Watery,</hi> which have a <hi>Mixture</hi> of the Qualities of the other, and there is not one, which is not allay'd or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd by one of the other.

The other will powerfully deterge the Slime of the Stomach, and revive the Appetite, and corroborate the Digeſtion. The <hi>Aſtringent</hi> can unite the Parts of the Blood in <hi>Malignant Diſeaſes,</hi> and with the <hi>Acrid</hi> enable it to <hi>ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and reject by the known Evacuations the morbid Humours.</hi> The Dyſcraſies of the Blood, which ſpecifie and diſtinguiſh every Diſeaſe, muſt be remedied by the Antagoniſt Quality of the Medicines united with it. Theſe therefore, are the only Medicines, which by the <hi>firſt Intention (Bleeding, Vomitting, Purging, Sweating,</hi> are to be us'd only on the juſt Occaſions) of changing the vicious Diſorders, muſt be us'd often to
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0722502100:51"/>ſupply gradually that Principle and Quality which the Blood wants, to reduce it to the <hi>Temperature it has loſt, and muſt recover, before the Diſeaſe is cur'd.</hi> Theſe only can redreſs the Diſeaſes of the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Nerves,</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> of the <hi>Breaſt,</hi> and <hi>Bowels,</hi> and <hi>Limbs,</hi> of the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Viſcera,</hi> and <hi>thoſe pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to the Sex.</hi> They have never wanted Succeſs in all the preceding Ages, and at this time, in the Parts of <hi>Europe,</hi> where they are us'd, and in <hi>England,</hi> by the <hi>fortunate Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſelect Simples prepar'd or infus'd</hi> (to name only the great and ſudden Cure of the <hi>King's Evil</hi> in the Treatiſe of Exerciſe, when the Shop Doſes had lead the Patient to the Atrophy, and almoſt Death) from the <hi>Records of the Ancient Practice, in the Memorials, or Tradition of the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</hi> Our Writers have in many Ages ſwell'd their Books to the admir'd Bulk and Conceit of the Reader, of their extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Induſtry, with varied and ſhuffled Receits, a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Cordials,</hi> and <hi>Electuaries,</hi> and <hi>Pills, &amp;c.</hi> (of which Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> is a late Inſtance) which they had never us'd, whoſe <hi>contrary Qualities make an inteſtine War, and break the Powers of one the other,</hi> and are detected by frequent Obſervation, to have no Operation. Many Phyſicians, wanting the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Philoſophy, and Experiments and a juſt Judgment, and to diſtinguiſh themſelves by a pretended rigorous Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs, have <hi>appointed the Services and Stations of the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines to one part, to the Head, the Eyes, the Heart, and the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and Womb,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are commanded by them to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Men only, theſe the Women in their reſpective Complaints and Diſorders: When the Parts of the Body, and both the Sexes, are preſerv'd by the Blood and Spirits, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd or reduc'd to the natural State. Beſides the Decrees of the moſt Eminent Phyſicians in all Ages, our natural Reaſon will inſtruct us, that the <hi>leſs compounded Preparations</hi> are moſt agreeable, and will have the ſureſt Efficacies, as by the <hi>moſt ſimple Diet,</hi> the Appetite and Concoction are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and Health and Life ſupported. If then, the <hi>admir'd natural Compoſition of each Plant</hi> makes many of the <hi>Watery, Acrid</hi> and <hi>Hot,</hi> many <hi>Aſtringent, Laxative,</hi> the <hi>Bitters are ſome Acid, others Inflaming;</hi> what Havock ſhall be made on Life in the nice and various Conſtitutions? when the Quality not
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0722502100:52"/>underſtood by the Phyſician, ſhall <hi>confine the Humours in a Pleuriſie, and purge in a Conſumption,</hi> when the <hi>malignant Humours in a Fever, flying off by the Bowels, ſhall be detain'd and driven back into the Blood again.</hi> And it is impoſſible, it is abſurd to imagine, that our Phyſicians ſhall ever acquire the Knowledge of the Conditions of the peccant Humours in the Stomach, in the Blood, when they know nothing of the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Medicines, which correct them. Theſe alone, are and can be the only Eſſays and Diſcoveries of them. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous Examination of the Qualities and Virtues of the Drugs will baniſh the Idleneſs of the Mode, entertain them with the Obſervations and Improvements of the moſt pleaſant and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded Philoſophy, which examines the Preparations of the old and new Pharmacy. The moſt <hi>learned</hi> and <hi>candid Chymiſts</hi> have lately confeſs'd, that their <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> is very poor with the Preſumption of the largeſt Abundance. All the <hi>acid Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits</hi> are almoſt the ſame: The <hi>Volatile</hi> have almoſt no Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences; all the <hi>Oils</hi> are equally burning; in a thouſand <hi>fix'd Salts</hi> there's hardly any Variety; all the <hi>Magiſteries</hi> and <hi>Calcinations</hi> are a dead <hi>Earth,</hi> and good for nothing, all the <hi>Alkali Powders</hi> are matcht by the <hi>Bones calcin'd.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I will maintain before all the Learn'd and Unlearn'd of the Nation, and prove beyond Contradiction, that if the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians and Surgeons have had by the Apothecaries expell'd out of them the Enquiry after, and the Knowledge of the only ſaving Medicines, and uſe in their place only the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious ſhamming Juleps, and the <hi>offenſive deſtructive Sweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meat of the Conſerves and Syrups;</hi> or have loſt their Learning by their Idleneſs and Sottiſhneſs, and plying the Gentlemens and the Apothecaries over the Bottle, the Setters and Finders of their Buſineſs, that the Differences of Diſeaſes, their Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, and the natural Attempts of Recovery are equally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them. I ſhall calm all the noiſie Oppoſitions, and eradicate all the filly Prepoſſeſſions and Prejudices of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded People, when I produce the Confeſſion of your Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, that all the Patients are, and muſt be now deſtroy'd by you. They will cover their Face, and bow down the Head, adore and reward your Diſcovery, and importun'd Preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your Aſſaſſination of all the Diſeas'd. Beyond your
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0722502100:53"/>Atteſtation, there are concurrent circumſtantial Evidences too ſtrong to be reſiſted. Dr. <hi>R.</hi> and the impudent Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizers of all the Skill, ſwear, that all the Patients but only their own are murther'd. The more modeſt and learned Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians retort, that he was never taught, or ſtudied any part of the Profeſſion, that he never ſaw a Diſſection, that he knows not the Places or Uſes of any part of the Body, that he never ſees but broken pieces of Diſeaſe, and never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults but with the Apothecaries, who manage the 3 or 4 days of his Abſence; never read the Authors who deliver the Laws, and report the Hiſtory of the Victories or Defeats, preſcribes only the <hi>trifling Waters and Powders, and Mineral VVaters to all the Caſes.</hi> The Surgeon, who has abus'd his Study, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupting and deſtroying all the Principles of Religion and Virtue, makes his Reputation from the moſt eaſie and obvious Cures, but denounces them inſuperable and fatal, to cover and conceal the perpetual Blunders of his Head and Hand, but is out-done in the Hoſpital by the Surgeons he tramples on, plies the Patients with the ſame Internals as the Dr. he now co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies after, and will not pretend to the Recovery of more pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful, which have always been communicated to them by the Phyſicians, when their Learning, and the Knowledge of the neceſſary internal Alteratives to reduce all the Chirurgical Caſes made their Aſſiſtance thought of the greateſt Uſe. How ſhall we be able to pronounce the Sentence in the moſt puzling, and the greateſt Cauſe in the World? The People cry out, they were ſav'd, they had been in the Grave, if the Doctor, Surgeon or Apothecary had not preſerv'd them, that we are bleſs'd with the beſt in <hi>Europe.</hi> It is infallible, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture (as it recovers the Herbs and Plants of the Fields and Gardens by the Sun, by the Change of the Seaſons, by Dews and Rain) by its own Force, with Reſt and Labour, Abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, and the regular Uſe of the Foods, in a ſhort or lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger time does paſs off many the moſt terrible Diſeaſes. The <hi>frightful Convulſions</hi> are ſubdu'd by the <hi>Periods of Age</hi> and the Ripening of the Sexes, when all the Remedies had been baf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fled. The <hi>Plague</hi> and <hi>Malignant Fevers</hi> ſhall be attack'd by one with the <hi>Acids,</hi> by others, with the burning <hi>Alixiphar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks,</hi> with, and without <hi>Bliſters,</hi> by many, by few or reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0722502100:54"/>Medicines, by Phyſicians and Surgeons of the preſent Smatterings of Skill, or of none at all, <hi>many of both ſhall eſcape and ſurvive.</hi> Then it is as infallible, that a knaviſh or ſilly Artiſt ſhall ſpoil the beſt Work, overſet the natural Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Strength, by the <hi>Impoſture and Conſumption of a large Number of the vile Medicines.</hi> A Phyſician was permitted by a Prince in a <hi>Italy,</hi> to lay the Wager, if there were 500 Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſers in the City. He expos'd himſelf muffled for the <hi>Tooth-ach,</hi> and had 500 Cures offer'd to him. But I have known many who have had from their Phyſicians the Pain aſſwag'd by Death. Dr. <hi>Sydenham</hi> calls aloud to the People, that our <hi>Tampering in the Fevers, Small-Pox, &amp;c.</hi> deſtroys more, than the Rage of War. What muſt we fear, when not many Years paſt, only 5 Medicines undertook all the Diſeaſes? Dr. <hi>O.</hi> has in Print expos'd the <hi>many Pairs of Bliſters, the ſweating Boles</hi> and <hi>ſilly Powders</hi> and <hi>Juleps of Dr.</hi> R. as moſt abſurd and fatal; if the mighty Aſſurances of his ſingle Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities do not ſupport the natural Vigour, as true and preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous as the <hi>Blank Paper</hi> ſent to him from Court, to fill with his own <hi>Panegyrick</hi> and <hi>Demands.</hi> All the wary Obſervers, and the beſt Judges, the Families who have retain'd the old, or acquir'd the lately reviv'd more ſincere and judicious Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, do avow, that Millions yearly are kill'd by the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thecaries and their Doctors raiſing the 2 or 3 Guineas a day, or the 25 or 30 Guineas, out of the Medicines in every <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Small-Pox</hi> and <hi>Meaſles,</hi> when in the favourable Seaſons, every one recovers from the prudent Uſe of the <hi>ſovereign ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Infuſions.</hi> The now famous Foreign Phyſicians are proud of their <hi>Kings,</hi> who feeble from the Cradle, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd with Age, are preſerv'd by them, when the Loſs of many our <hi>Royal Family</hi> are lamented. The <hi>dark Myſtery</hi> muſt then be expos'd to view, as bright as the Rays of the Sun, in the Parallel of my Ld <hi>R</hi>—<hi>r</hi> turning <hi>Quack</hi> on <hi>Tower-Hill,</hi> with the Name of Dr <hi>Bendo,</hi> when the King had commanded him to leave the Court. In his printed Invitation he rails bitterly at the College, deſpiſes and pities the Ignorance of all the Doctors, his Brethren, had his Share of the common polite Learning, had an Apothecary to prompt him behind the Scenes, and us'd all Dr. <hi>R</hi>'s Remedies. The Gentlemen and

            </p>
            <p>What ſovereign Remedy can prevent and extinguiſh all theſe our Calamities of the Sick? We muſt call for that provided by our moſt Learned Magnanimous King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and of the <hi>Lords and Commons in Parliament,</hi> who eſtabliſh'd, from the moſt preſſing Inducements, your College and the Company of Surgeons, to avert the <hi>High Diſpleaſure of God,</hi> when the Sick ſhall be expos'd to the Robbery and Deſtruction of the Traders in the Remedies, of the Apothecaries, who are to ſave the Life, and at the ſame time thruſt into the Patient all the Numbers and Exactions of the Doſes, neceſſary for their own Preſervation. I am not able to repreſent the vehemence of the Zeal, the ſacred Rage of that great Prince and his Parliament againſt the execrable Inhumanity, and the impious Temerity of the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0722502100:56"/>Quacks and Apothecaries, intruding their illiterate unexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd Dealings on the Life of the People, in the moſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and dangerous Diſeaſes. This the moſt religious, the moſt wiſe and neceſſary Law was reviv'd and reſtor'd to its Health and Force, by our moſt learned and pious K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. after the moſt mature Deliberations of his Privy Council, with the Advice of all the Judges. Our moſt terrible Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies frequently preſent us with the moſt important Wiſdom and Vigilance. We will appeal to the <hi>French</hi> King the Grand Patron of Learning, and of all the Arts and moſt uſeful Knowledge. Not to inſiſt on the <hi>Royal Academy of Sciences,</hi> that of <hi>Painters</hi> will to the life repreſent the vaſt Deſign of the <hi>Royal Eſtabliſhment of your College and the Company of Surgeons.</hi> The <hi>Painters</hi> meet often in their <hi>Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy,</hi> compare their Peices with the moſt accompliſh'd Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances there. The fundamental Laws of the ſtricteſt Imitation of Nature in the Lines and Colours, the Qualities and Mixtures of the Colours are demonſtrated, and promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated.

Your College (as that of the Surgeons) was erected by the Acts of Parliament, as the <hi>Supreme and only <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of Phyſick.</hi> The <hi>two famous <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſities</hi> can only inſtruct the Students, in the previous and preparatory Learning of the Languages and Philoſophy.

The <hi>Solemn Lectures in the College</hi> (and in all the Sciences the great Advancements have almoſt only been made from theſe publick Diſcourſes) will reduce to the moſt poſſible

            <p>When <hi>Her Majeſty in Council</hi> ſhall Graciouſly receive your <hi>Humble Addreſs,</hi> and tenderly commiſerate the Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the moſt injur'd People in the Univerſe: the Decree of the <hi>Royal Martyr</hi> ſhall be put in force. The <hi>learned and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0722502100:58"/>Honourable Viſitors</hi> appointed will inſtantly redreſs all the deplor'd Grievances of the Nation. The <hi>Obſervance of</hi> 3 or 4 <hi>Statutes</hi> confirm'd by them will be rigorouſly exacted, that the Phyſicians and Surgeons ſhall not dare to rob and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Sick by <hi>Blending</hi> the <hi>complete and perfect now pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Remedies,</hi> to blind the Families from their Knowledge of the ſmall Prices, and great uſes in the vulgar incidental Diſorders, and contrive the moſt abject and Knaviſh Falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the minute high pris'd Doſes: That no Phyſician or Surgeon ſhall ever diſcourſe of the Diſeaſe, and reſolve the Method of Cure, and perform the Operations, in the imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent Intruſions of the Apothecaries, from their neceſſary Duties in the Shops, to infatuate the People into the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, that they are able on the next occaſions to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their Places: That the <hi>mutual Affection and Emulation</hi> ſhall be more religiouſly obſerv'd, that Dr. <hi>R.</hi> ſhall never preſume to magnify himſelf to an immenſe Bigneſs, without the cleareſt Reaſons aſſign'd, of his indefatigable ſtudy and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and of his great Proficiency from the moſt frequent Conſultations with the moſt learned and experienc'd Phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians: and that the deteſtable <hi>Mirmils</hi> ſhall not give their <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cences</hi> to Practice to every <hi>Quack</hi> and <hi>Apothecary,</hi> by extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their Skill and Judgment and Succeſs, when run for at the laſt Gaſp, before their own. As our Kings have almoſt the Divine Complacence and Honours, when they ſee the Magiſtrates diligent in exciting the Obſervance of the Laws; the <hi>Viſitors</hi> will obſerve the College enforcing the Induſtry and Sincerity of all the Members, after the <hi>Election</hi> of the <hi>Preſident</hi> (<hi>not by and out of the</hi> 8 <hi>Elects only</hi>) and of the <hi>Cenſors</hi> and <hi>Committee</hi> by the <hi>Society</hi> yearly, by the Names written, and deliver'd, as in the <hi>Bank</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-India Company:</hi> Becauſe all the <hi>Publick Calamities,</hi> and the <hi>Diſſolution of the Royal College</hi> prognoſticated and dreaded by you, are imputed by you to the <hi>Treachery</hi> and <hi>Debauchery,</hi> and the <hi>Paſſiveneſs of the Preſident and Cenſors, and Committees,</hi> who have been brib'd to the Neglect of all their Statutes by the Apothecaries Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents of the Patients to them, or the Terrors of Poverty and Diſgrace from their Reſentment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I, and my Brethren the Clergy,</hi> muſt not look on as <hi>indifferent
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0722502100:59"/>Spectators,</hi> offer up the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the Congregation, for the <hi>Divine Influence</hi> on the <hi>illegal</hi> and <hi>pernicious Quackeries</hi> of the Empiricks and Apothecaries. VVe are oblig'd to viſit every Houſe, every one of our Flock in Sickneſs; we muſt, with the <hi>ſharpeſt Severity, ſcourge away all the Exchangers of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lacious Doſes with the Health and Life of the Patients.</hi> We muſt inform them, it is their <hi>Duty</hi> to apply to the <hi>Phyſicians,</hi> the <hi>Divine Laws and our own</hi> have appointed; that their Obligations to the juſteſt Care of the Families will cure the preſent <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, Idleneſs and Debauchery, and Neglect of the neceſſary Knowledge of Diſeaſes,</hi> from the induſtrious Peruſal of the Authors, and the Enquiry into the Improvements of all Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines. We ſhall then inſtruct them, how great, how many will be <hi>their Rewards and Advantages,</hi> from the moſt diligent and rational Adjuſtment of the few cheap, neceſſary Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that the conſtant Phyſician is compell'd by his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, to <hi>communicate to them the Knowledge of the more eaſie Diſeaſes,</hi> the <hi>Values,</hi> and the <hi>Diviſions</hi> and <hi>Mixtures</hi> of all the <hi>Preparations</hi> directed by the Government to the Publick for their Uſe. Then we and they ſhall (as formerly with the greateſt Pleaſure) diſtribute the <hi>Divine Bounty</hi> of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent publick Medicines to the Poor, or more Indigent of the People, who will not then greedily entertain the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piricks from all Countries, when they can receive our Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of our own more ſovereign Preparations.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Clergy, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Gentry are under the ſacred Obligations</hi> with you, to preſerve the <hi>Honour and Dignity of our two famous Nurſeries of all Learning.</hi> We may recover the Zeal of the Officers, by reviving the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, which their ineſtimable Services claim from the Cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance and Beneficence of the Court, the Nobility and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The Univerſities may be mov'd by us to correct and reform their Phyſicians, their perfidious Enemies, who deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them up to the illiterate Impoſtors, by the Combinations you have ſo often detected; that they will not ſuffer our <hi>Out-lying Phyſicians from them</hi> to increaſe their Numbers and Power, and <hi>haſten the Ruine of this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity of Phyſick,</hi> our Laws command them to ſupport. Our <hi>Vigilance and Courage</hi> will be animated by the <hi>imminent Dangers and Deſtruction</hi> of
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0722502100:60"/>all Learning in the Nation, from the impetuous Libertinage, which, in the late Rebellion, inſulted on all the Orders and Profeſſions. <hi>Religion</hi> now ſuffers from the ſame Cauſes, which affect you, from the <hi>Preferments</hi> beſtow'd on us by the <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts,</hi> the <hi>Lewd</hi> and <hi>Ignorant,</hi> with the ſame <hi>Conditions</hi> annext of their unmoleſted Ravages on all Learning and Virtue, their aſſum'd Sufficiency to determine in Religion, as in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, from the trifling Pamphlets they read in their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongue.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Rights of the Chriſtian Church</hi> give us Power to admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> from the <hi>Pulpit,</hi> to <hi>avoid</hi> the <hi>Guilt,</hi> (which is adjudged unpardonable by all the Divines) expoſing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the Life of the People to the endleſs Increaſe and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of the Apothecaries, and other Unlicens'd Underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. The <hi>Company</hi> will confeſs (as an <hi>Apothecary in Print has</hi>) the invincible Reaſons for their ſpeedy Reduction. The <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Swarms of their Numbers, from</hi> 2 <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>Prentices in every Shop,</hi> and their filling all the Streets, muſt, from the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Proofs you aſſign, threaten or take away the Life of the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> the <hi>Nobility, Gentry</hi> and <hi>People.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before old Laws and Eſtabliſhments are pull'd down, and the Rubbiſh remov'd, we ſhould council them to frame a new and better Model, to make the Draught of the Fabrick, and expoſe it to the Judgments of the wiſeſt in the Nation. The Plan of the new Structure is, that the People ſhall have the liberty to do and ſuffer what they pleaſe; to gratifie the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Rage for Anarchy and Confuſion. They ſhall be cheated and kill'd by any one, who ſhall fall into that Trade and Employment. The Government has made a triple Contract with your College and the Company, and impos'd an Oath on all the Members to defend the Profeſſions neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Life of the Subjects. You are oblig'd to return your Commſſion, and Requeſt to be declar'd abſolv'd from the ſacred Obligation; that the Societies ſhall be diſſolv'd, when they have publickly been declar'd uſeleſs, to be abandon'd and demoliſh'd, as a Fortreſs of no Importance. You may move, that the Committees may examine your Conduct and Diſcharge of your Truſt, when they conſider, what Laws are obſolete or neceſſary to be reviv'd. You may both humbly
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0722502100:61"/>offer to them (the greateſt part of whoſe Laws, as of the Government and all the Arts are infallible) that the raſh bold Attemps may be allow'd in Caſes deſperate, never ſeen be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but are condemn'd and exploded, when the known Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods receiv'd and juſtly apply'd, never fail'd of Succeſs. The Merchants and other Traders may venture, as Volunteers of an Army, their own, or the Stocks of their Creditors, in the moſt hazardous Projects, new Diſcoveries and Settlements: But the General will not betray his aſſur'd Victory, and forfeit the Honours of his VViſdom and Conduct. The two Societies are a part of the Government, their Eſtabliſhment is in force; the Conſultation will not reſolve their Extirpation, if the Mortification is capable of Cure, if they can be reſtor'd to their Health and Vigour, and the Support or Defence of the whole.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, it is your Duty to reſerve to the <hi>Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> their <hi>Property of all the Remedies</hi> aſſign'd them by the Government and College, to make the frequent <hi>Additions,</hi> to amend the <hi>Defective</hi> from the many Diſcoveries of the <hi>modern experimental Philoſophy,</hi> and the late excellent <hi>Receit-Books</hi> of almoſt all the <hi>Cities</hi> of <hi>Europe.</hi> But it is impoſſible for you to attempt or perform it without the conſtant Uſe of your <hi>publick Laboratory,</hi> and <hi>the more neceſſary and productive Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of your private and retir'd,</hi> in imitation of all the moſt famous Phyſicians, and of our moſt excellent Mr. <hi>Boyle.</hi> You muſt open the <hi>Stores</hi> of your <hi>three Diſpenſaries,</hi> to furniſh the general Remedies to all the Families. You muſt revive the Practice of all Ages, by <hi>adviſing only the Patients in Charity not too remote from you,</hi> that the Sick may hope the ſureſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery from the ſame Adviſer, obſerving the Progreſs of the Diſeaſes and collecting all the Obſervations, they ſhall preſent to him. You muſt apply to the <hi>Ld. Mayor, Court of Aldermen and Common Council,</hi> who, by their <hi>Committee with yours,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, that the <hi>Prices ſhould be ſubſcrib'd in every Preſcription,</hi> that the <hi>Bills</hi> ſhould be ſent to the <hi>Apothecaries, promiſing to deliver them at the Rates aſſign'd.</hi> They were aſſur'd, that 30 or 40 Shops are ſufficient to prepare and ſell all the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines in the large Quantities demanded, the infinite, moſt facil Diviſions being made in the Chambers. <hi>Religion and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0722502100:62"/>Honeſty</hi> exact your Care of the Sick, to direct your Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents to thoſe Shops only, 'till the Government and you ſhall be aſſur'd, that the <hi>Medicines</hi> (lately condemn'd in the eminent Shops) <hi>are not ſophiſticated and wanting all the chiefeſt Ingredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</hi> The <hi>Law</hi> has carefully preſerv'd to you <hi>the Right of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring and diſpoſing of the Medicines,</hi> and the <hi>Defence of your Profeſſion requires you to invade the Apothecaries, to deter them from the moſt unjuſt and abſurd Invaſion of your Practice.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Patient cannot be ſafe without it. If you adviſe the moſt proper Medicine, the Incroaching Apothecary breaks the Heart of all the Sick; It is well enough, a pretty tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Preſcript, he could have ſent in a better. But if he has a wretched Phyſician to bring in, or would ſet up for the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician alone, he changes the Medicines, enrages the Impatient againſt the Doctor by one of no Operation, provokes the moſt Patient by a violent deſtructive Doſe, as you prove in many Criminals you expoſe. <hi>Your own Intereſt will ſollicite you to barter and communicate your Obſervations of the improv'd Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations,</hi> and the Recoveries of the many loſt. But the <hi>Specifick and Appropriate to each Diſeaſe</hi> muſt be reſerv'd from the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who are now craving after the endleſs Changes and Shiftings from this to the other ſorts, and importuning every knaviſh Practiſer to cheat and deſtroy them. You will lay before them and the Quacks, as Edg'd-Tools in the Reach of Children, the moſt efficacious Qualities of the Medicines to caſt at, with the known Chances and Hazards, every Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe, which falls in their way. The Surgeons do not publiſh their Balſams and Tinctures, and lend their Knives and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments for the grand Operations. The <hi>French</hi> King did not importune our Dr. <hi>Tabor,</hi> to reveal the Remedy he gave to the <hi>Royal Princeſs,</hi> and the <hi>Nobility of both Sexes.</hi> It is the moſt deadly Poiſon to kill the Induſtry of the Phyſicians, who would retrieve the Negligence and Loſſes of this Age. <hi>The Cabinet Councellors, our Generals and Admirals,</hi> do not divulge the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns they have form'd. The Painter does not ſuffer the Face he draws to ſee his manner of mixing or laying on the Colours. The Forbidden Fruits are moſt violently coveted. The Fox in the Fable was many Hours eagerly craving the Food in the Glaſs, the Tongue could not penetrate. You
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0722502100:63"/>muſt aſſert to your Profeſſion, the Prerogative truly Royal, the moſt magnificent Bounties to the Diſtreſs'd, from the publick Magazine of the general Remedies preſented to them, but you muſt reſerve the moſt Soveraign for the moſt Deſerving, and you are above the Fear of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded or compell'd.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs of his experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Philoſophy in Phyſick,</hi> repreſents to us the moſt ſublime Character in the inſpir'd Hiſtory <hi>(He went about doing good,)</hi> above the <hi>pretended Glories of ambitious Princes,</hi> who have conſum'd their Life, and Mankind by their Ravages and Conqueſts. <hi>The Honours and Diſtinctions</hi> of the Subjects in all Governments have no other Foundation, <hi>than being ſerviceable to the Publick, and promoting the common Proſperity.</hi> How great will the Publick Gratitude be to you, when your College ſhall preſerve the Profeſſion the moſt Learned, and moſt implor'd in the greateſt Diſtreſſes of Pain and Fear of Death? You reſtore to the Kingdom its <hi>Right,</hi> its <hi>Property</hi> in all the general Medicines, as a Charity diverted from, and hid from the Poor, the Pious Donors reliev'd. You will have the Honours you demand, from every one, who can comprehend the Value of the almoſt immenſe Benefaction, and will pity and deſpiſe the Careleſs, and the Fooliſh, Unable to fathom its Extent and Importance; as the <hi>Deity</hi> receives the Adorations of the <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> who inceſſantly ſearch after the inexpreſſible Grandeurs and Beauties of the Univerſe.</p>
