            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>BEING convinced from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberate reflections, that the imagination of pregnant women, can make no impreſſion on the form of the foetus: and, being witneſs to
<pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0493202200:3"/>much unhappineſs from adopting the contrary opinion, I was led to collect my thoughts on the ſubject, and throw them on paper.</p>
            <p>As it is a ſubject, under ſome cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, of very great importance to the fair ſex, I am induced to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs myſelf to them in particular; in hopes ſuch addreſs may engage an attentive peruſal; from whence, I flatter myſelf, I ſhall be the means of alleviating thoſe anxious fears raiſed by prejudice, and but too ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally attendant on the pregnant ſtate.</p>

            <p>Senſible that phyſical, and anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical diſquiſitions cannot be pleaſing to the fair ſex, I have intentionally avoided them as much, as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of my ſubject would admit, nor do I think my cauſe has in the leaſt ſuffered from ſuch conduct, as, excluſive of their aſſiſtance, my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign is anſwered, without fatiguing the ladies with perhaps at beſt but groundleſs conjecture.</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON THE Force of Imagination, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THAT the imagination of pregnant women is capable to mutilate or deform the foetus, is an opinion of a very ancient date, and has been ſupported by the ſentiments of the young, and old, wiſe, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe for ſeveral centuries paſt. The ill effects of adopting this erroneous doctrine, I ſhall forbear to enlarge
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0493202200:7"/>on. If I prove it to be built on irra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſuperſtitious notions, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the following pages will be ſufficiently anſwered.</p>
            <p>Preparatory to this intention, I beg leave to obſerve, "by imagination I underſtand (as Pope and Gay ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs it) that power which forms ideal or mental pictures;" this I apprehend is taking the word in its utmoſt la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude; and, under this acceptation, we are to conſider its effects, as they may tend to external objects; or, as they may influence the animal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine.</p>
            <p>It will require very little force of argument to ſhew how ineffectual is the power of imagination, unaſſiſted, to influence, or obtain any change on external objects.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0493202200:8"/>
            <p>The utmoſt exertion of its force can neither deprive the loadſtone of its attraction, prevent the vegetation of plants, or ſtop the deſcent of rain. For, in ſpite of our moſt ardent wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, nature's laws will be predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; the loadſtone will attract, plants will vegetate, and rain deſcend.</p>
            <p>Could imagination ſcreen us from want, whoſe wants would be unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied? the miſer would no longer have an object for his avarice, the ambitious would poſſeſs the extent of his ambition; and every man arrive to the ſummit of his wiſhes.</p>
            <p>The impotency of ideal concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being ſo glaringly obvious, it would be an inſult to our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuppoſe any change, either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, or unintended, could take
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0493202200:9"/>place on external objects; reſpecting their form, bulk, ſubſtance, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, without ſome intervening pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. Hence then to form an object concording with our ideas, requires an aſſiſtance found only in art. By the intervention of this, we are enabled to aſſiſt or prevent the effects of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, though to pervert the ſyſtem, baffles all human invention.</p>
            <p>Being convinced of the inability of ideal conceptions to produce any change on external objects, it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally occurs to conſider what influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the imagination has over the human machine.</p>
            <p>To attempt the diſcuſſion of this conſideration in its full extent would lead me into a labyrinth of philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic theories, doubts, and diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0493202200:10"/>The paſſions of the mind are an inexhauſtible fund for philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical inquiries. Every day ſome inſtances are to be obſerved where anger, grief, joy, and ſurprize have produced aſtoniſhing changes in the human conſtitution: nevertheleſs, theſe effects remain inexplicable by the narrow limits of our phyſiologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal knowledge. Hence then I ſhall limit this conſideration to the point in queſtion, viz. the influence of the imagination on the foetus.</p>
            <p>To judge of the propriety of what is hereafter to be advanced on this ſubject, it is neceſſary ſome idea ſhould be formed of the connections conſiſting between the mother and embryo.</p>
            <p>The foetus, or embryo during its ſtay in the womb, is envelloped in a
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0493202200:11"/>peculiar ſet of membranes (of a vaſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, ſpongy texture) aggregately term<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the burden: from the attachment the burden forms to the womb ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts a conſtant circulation of blood between the mother and child.</p>
            <p>This attachment is formed by an adheſion of the ſpongy cells of the burden, to the veins and arteries of the womb; one ſeries of the veſſels contained in the burden, being fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by means of its attachment to the womb with blood from that organ, after a variety of convolutions, empty their contents into the veins, form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a part of the umbilical cord, or navel-ſtring. This cord, paſſing from a certain place in the burden, enters the body of the foetus at the navel; from whence, by wonderful mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm, the blood is tranſported to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0493202200:12"/>very part of the foetus, and veſſels deſtined for that purpoſe. To preſerve a conſtant and free circulation, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which the foetus muſt ſuffer, the blood is returned from the child to the arteries of the navel-ſtring, from whence it is diſperſed into the burden; and, paſſing into the ſpongy cells connected to the womb, enters the circulation of the mother; and hence between her and the child the inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate connection ſubſiſts. The ill conſequences attending a detachment of the ſpongy cells of the burden from the womb, are too obvious to need mentioning: to prevent them, comes not only under the province of the phyſician, but the prudent care of every one.</p>
            <p>The phyſician will tell you that a diſtention of the blood-veſſels from
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0493202200:13"/>a preternatural fulneſs, or a relaxation from emptineſs; an undue velocity in the circulation, or too great lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor, are all capable of ſeparating the burden from the womb; conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, are all capable of producing abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and miſcarriage.</p>
            <p>Your own good ſenſe, ladies, will inform you that fear, grief, anxiety, joy, or ſurprize, will retard or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celerate the circulating fluids, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the actuating motive; hence, from theſe paſſions, miſcarriages fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently enſue: and give me leave to add, this is the greateſt effect the foetus can experience from the power of imagination.</p>
            <p>On a review of the connection ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting between the mother and child, together with a reflection on the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural properties and uſe of the blood
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0493202200:14"/>in adults, it is very apparent nature intended this circulation, ſolely for the nutrition and perfection of the foetus. From the ſimilitude of its office, I think it may very aptly be compared to water, poured on a plant or ſeed, without which, neither the plant would thrive or the ſeed vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate. The ſeed of a plant put into water, will by the aſſiſtance of a due degree of warmth and moiſture, vegetate and produce a plant bearing the ſame characteriſtic marks, as that from which the ſeed was gathered. The good or ill quality of the earth, the abundance or deficiency of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, the proper or improper tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the air, will affect the ſeed in no other way, than either totally ſuppreſſing its vegetation, or cauſing it to ſhoot forth in a more or leſs
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0493202200:15"/>healthy ſtate, as its nutritive eſſentials, earth, air, and water, were better, or worſe adapted for vegetation in the ſpecies of plant.</p>
            <p>The characteriſtic marks of the plant all ſpring from that ſmall atom, the ſeed; this particle is from the poſitive laws of nature decreed to ſhoot forth into ſuch marks, colours, and fibres, as the plant from which it was gathered is diſtinguiſhed. The proper nouriſhment, as I ſaid before, that is neceſſary to vegetation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of a due mixture and tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature of the earth, air, and water. Notwithſtanding any defect that may occur in theſe nutritive princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, the ſeed, when it vegetates, will produce the characteriſtic marks of the plant, though in an unhealthy aſpect. To an impregnated woman,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0493202200:16"/>it is ordained, by the ſame diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing power, to produce an offspring bearing the characteriſtic marks of the human race. It is the office of the circulation, paſſing between the mother and child, to afford nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the embryo; as it is the office of the elements to produce ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getation in the vegetable kingdom.</p>
            <p>Should ſickneſs, anxiety, or any cauſe whatſoever, debilitate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the woman, the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating fluids being thoroughly ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered incapable of affording proper nouriſhment; abortion, or the birth of a weakly, puny child, will be the conſequence. But the defects in the mother's conſtitution, from whatever cauſe they may ariſe, can no more alter the original form the foetus was endued with, than earth, air, and
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0493202200:17"/>water, aſſiſted with all the art of man, is capable to produce the flower of a roſe from the ſeed of a thiſtle. The inference I draw from this ſimilitude, ſerves only to corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate this indiſputable fact, viz. the organization of the embryo from the hour of impregnation; a fact every one tacitly acknowledges, who adopts the opinion, that impreſſions are made on the foetus by the force of imagination. Such impreſſions are ſaid to be produced inſtantaneouſly, and not confined to any term of pregnancy.</p>
            <p>The defects of a leg, toe, arm, or finger, have been aſcribed to a ſudden ſurprize on ſeeing objects in that lamentable ſtate. The very ſuppoſition tacitly implies the foetus was once perfectly formed, or rather
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0493202200:18"/>that the parts were, previous to the ſurprize, in a natural ſtate. If then the loſs of a member is thus ſuddenly accompliſhed, I ſhould wiſh to know how the haemorrhage, which muſt neceſſarily enſue from the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of ſuch parts, was reſtrained, and what became of the ſeparated parts. For among all the tales I have heard relative to this ſubject, I do not recollect one that mentions the appearance either of an haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage, or of the ſeparated part.</p>
            <p>The impoſſibility, ſatisfactorily to anſwer theſe inquiries, would, I ſhould think, ſufficiently evince the abſurdity of the ſuppoſition. But as theſe inquiries are unanſwerable, to explain them is never attempted, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch an attempt, if impartially purſued, muſt raiſe a train of ideas
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0493202200:19"/>that would inevitably deſtroy an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that, as it has been ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcated by the prejudice of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, requires more trouble to diveſt ourſelves of, than mankind in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral chooſe to take. But to return more immediately to the ſubject.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen that ideal concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions can make no impreſſions on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal objects; but as ſuch we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſider the foetus (from it's be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo intimately connected with the mother). Let us view it then in its proper light, viz. organized matter, placed in the womb, there to be nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and brought to a certain degree of perfection, and then to be expelled.</p>
            <p>We have obſerved, that the nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary to the perfection of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0493202200:20"/>the foetus, is obtained by the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating fluids paſſing between it and the mother. Excluſive of theſe fluids, we know of no intercourſe, conſequently of no power, paſſing from the mother to the child, that can poſſibly be ſubſervient to the mother's imagination. Hence then, if to mutilate or deform the foetus is the effect of the mother's imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the blood alone muſt be the immediate acting principle. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this principle has powers equal to the effects aſcribed, let plain common ſenſe decide; and when it reflects that blood is a ſmooth, oily fluid, will immediately acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſuch conſiſtence ſufficiently demonſtrates the blood's incapacity to mutilate the foetus, or impreſs any form imagination can deviſe.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0493202200:21"/>Were the form of the foetus in the power of imagination, our offspring would be as ſubject to the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priciouſneſs of mankind as our cloaths.</p>
            <p>The form of the child's mouth, noſe, eye, eye-brow, or any of its features, would as much depend on the reigning faſhion, as the cut of a cap, coat, or any part of our dreſs.</p>
            <p>No fortunes would then be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited for deficiency of male heirs; nor uneaſineſs at the birth of a ſon, when the mother ardently longed for a daughter.</p>
            <p>If the imagination could take off, or place on, the foetus, a leg, toe, or arm, it could certainly remove all kind of blemiſhes. With ſuch pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0493202200:22"/>aſſiſtance, who would bear the deformity of wens, carbuncles, warts, &amp;c. theſe being excreſcences nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed by the circulating fluids, and connected to the patient by blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſels, as the foetus is nouriſhed and connected to the mother? If theſe fluids are ſo powerful in ſome caſes, we may, from parity of reaſoning, expect the ſame in other.</p>
            <p>It is evident the imagination, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſiſted, can have no manner of effect on external objects: that as the foetus, from its ſituation, and intimate connection with the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is to be conſidered as part of her fabrick; yet, as to mark, or mutilate, requires a due degree of force; and the only power capable of conveying ſuch force to the foetus, in conſequence of the imagination,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0493202200:23"/>is the blood; I think it is a very ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious inference, that the imagination is as incapable of effecting any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the foetus, as on any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal body whatſoever.</p>
            <p>From what has been advanced, I hope I have ſatisfactorily proved, the imagination can make no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on the foetus. I ſhall now proceed to ſhew, that the marks attributed to the force of imagination are effects proceeding from other cauſes.</p>
            <p>The exact manner theſe marks are formed, is beyond the reach of my comprehenſion to explain. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince you they are not the effects of the cauſe aſcribed, let us convey our ideas to the vegetable and brute creation. In the former of theſe,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0493202200:24"/>we ſeldom ſee a collection of apples, pears, plumbs, nuts, &amp;c. but we diſcern ſome protuberance or defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency in their reſpective form, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing altogether out of the general courſe of nature. In the brute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it is by no means a very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frequent occurrence to meet cats, dogs, ſheep, &amp;c. &amp;c. diſmembered, and impreſſed with the greateſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of marks. Can we attribute theſe appearances to the force of imagination? We know of no ſuch exiſtence in the vegetable kingdom; and in the brute creation, under the form of inſtinct only. It is univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally acknowledged, there is no ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfactory way to account for theſe appearances; we call them defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences or luxuriances of nature. If, then, nature proves deficient in the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0493202200:25"/>productions of the animal and vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table kingdom, by what ſyſtem of logic are we to expect ſhe will be infallible to the offspring of man?</p>
            <p>Man claims a ſuperiority over all other created beings, from his pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar endowment, reaſon. This bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſtitutes his dominion. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, the ſame omnipotent wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is obſerved in the mechanical ſtructure of a fly, as in the formation of man. Hence we may conclude, that no peculiar providence is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for the perfection of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, beyond thoſe laws of nature framed by the omnipotent Being for the perfection of every created object. When infants come into the world with narrow breaſts, one ſhoulder higher than another, or with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted feet, we do not always attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0493202200:26"/>them to the force of imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but ſometimes to inexplicable cauſes in nature. If thus we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge nature protrudes ſome parts, and contracts others, I think it would be a greater proof of our reaſon to attribute all impreſſions and marks to the ſame ſource, than to believe the idle tales of ignorance and ſuperſtition. It has never been ſuppoſed the imagination could change the ſex of the child; that has ever been deemed impoſſible: but the ſame chain of arguments that will convince us of the imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticability of ſuch metamorphoſis, muſt alſo convince us, that to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilate or deform the foetus by the ſame power is equally impracticable.</p>
            <p>I ſhall next offer to your conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration a few thoughts on the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0493202200:27"/>and ſtrange ideas ſome preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant women are poſſeſſed with. Strange as theſe ideas are, they are not, as is generally ſuppoſed, pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to pregnancy, but are to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in men and maidens. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the cauſe, I think they are evidently the ſymptoms of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved taſte or appetite.</p>
            <p>Thoſe converſant in the practice of phyſic, find it no very unuſual thing for a patient (either in a fever, in an inſane ſtate of mind, or in the green-ſickneſs, which is the moſt familiar) to crave after what, in an healthy ſtate, they had conceived a great averſion to. Can we account for theſe cravings in any other way, than ſaying they are the ſymptoms of a vitiated taſte, brought on by a diſeaſe in the circulating fluids? To
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0493202200:28"/>believe this a fact, (and that it is ſo, to me appears inconteſtable) we muſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately infer, that, as taſte is a ſenſe liable to be vitiated by an alteration in the circulating fluids, and as the diſpoſition of the circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating fluids evidently becomes alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from impregnation, the deſires and longings of pregnant women are to be conſidered, like thoſe of men, the mere effects of a depraved or vitiated taſte.</p>
            <p>From what has been advanced, I hope, ladies, you are now ſenſible, no power of imagination can effect any mark or impreſſion on the foetus. Nevertheleſs, I apprehend, though your reaſon may in this coincide with my opinion, yet the prejudice of education is ſo very predominant,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0493202200:29"/>that you cannot totally diveſt your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the contrary opinion.</p>
            <p>The many tales you have heard in its favour, has, as it were, forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied your mind againſt the convict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing power of reaſon. To remove that barrier is a very difficult taſk, as it is not always in our power im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to diveſt ourſelves of thoſe prejudices that have been adopted by our friends, and by them incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with our education.</p>
            <p>To ſay that all the tales which have formed theſe prejudices, and told us by our anceſtors with all the confidence of truth, believed by our prejudiced friends, who, to corroborate their father's, or grandfather's report, will atteſt ſimilar occurrences to have happened within their own know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0493202200:30"/>I ſay for me to declare all theſe tales are falſe and erroneous, would be deemed to their author's veracity the groſſeſt inſult, and in me ſuch a ſtep would appear the higheſt pitch of arrogance. To a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the firſt, and wave the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the latter, I ſhall only ſay as my private opinion; that our friends reaſon hath been miſled; and ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the hiſtories have been miſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented, or the events recorded in them, ignorantly accounted for. In defence of this opinion, I beg leave to produce ſome inſtances, wherein will appear the ignorant credulity of two of the greateſt philoſophers, as ever adorned the Engliſh nation.</p>
            <p>The great Sir Francis Bacon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes the cure of ſome warts he
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0493202200:31"/>was afflicted with, to rubbing them with ſome lard, to which adhered the ſkin, which was afterwards expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to a ſouth wind.</p>
            <p>The Hon. Mr. Boyle records as facts, among many other, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hiſtories.</p>
            <p>A great lady (far from being cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous) confeſſed to me, as alſo did ſome of her ſervants, that with the common remedy of aſh-aſhes, formed by warm urine, into ſeven or nine cakes, and buried ſome days in a dunghill, ſhe was cured of the yellow jaundice, after having paſſed thro' a tedious courſe of phyſic.</p>
            <p>A phyſician afflicted with a maraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, (a ſpecies of conſumption) boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an egg till it was hard, in his own urine; and with a bodkin perforated
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0493202200:32"/>the ſhell in many places, and buried it in an ant's hill; where, as the emmets devoured it, he found his ſtrength return, and his diſeaſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe.</p>
            <p>Riverius tells us, that the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a great officer was exceſſively tormented with a whitloe, for which he ordered her finger to be put into the cat's ear, and within two hours after ſhe was freed from pain.</p>
            <p>Theſe few inſtances I have ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, are ſuch, that to believe them in the light theſe great men have ſhewn them in, no one in this age, who boaſts common ſenſe, unentrammeled with ſuperſtition, will pretend to. Nevertheleſs, they are told with a confidence of their veracity, and told by men of inconteſted learning, and
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0493202200:33"/>abilities. From ſuch authorities why do we diſcredit them?</p>
            <p>Becauſe, that ſpirit of free enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and general improvement, which diſtinguiſhes the preſent aera, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced us, (tho' the facts may be deemed indiſputable) that neither expoſing the lard's ſkin to a ſouth wind; burying the ſeven, or nine cakes of aſh-aſhes under a dunghill; the deſtruction of the egg by the ants; or placing the finger in the cat's ear, effected the cure reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively aſcribed to each.</p>
            <p>The melancholy effects ſaid to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from the ſting or bite of the tarantula, cured only by the charms of muſic, are almoſt univerſally be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and too well-known to need a repetition; yet theſe effects are now
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0493202200:34"/>rejected by people of ſenſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment, as tales propagated by knavery and impoſition. The exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the tarantula is not doubted; but its bite, from experience, has been found attended with no other incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, than would have enſued from the ſting of a large gnat, or waſp.</p>
            <p>The ſtories firſt told of the ſtrange ſymptoms attending the bite of this ſpider, were undoubtedly raiſed to anſwer ſome ſiniſter view. The cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, ſuperſtitious multitude ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the bait; and thus have ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled the cheat to be carried on to this very day, by cunning vagabonds, who, taking advantage of the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious folly of the country, act, in confederacy with the fidler, (to excite
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0493202200:35"/>charity) the wild extravagant geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſaid to be the ſymptoms pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the venomous bite of the tarantula.</p>
            <p>This contradiction to the received opinion is now well atteſted; but I believe the united teſtimonies of all the learned in England, will never eradicate the contrary notions from the vulgar and illiterate.</p>
            <p>In every age and clime, the crafty knave has found a multitude to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his impoſitions. The powers of amulets and charms; the bottle con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juror; rabbit woman; Cock-lane ghoſt; witchcraft and fortune-tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are perpetual teſtimonies of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh credulity.</p>
            <p>If we paſs to our neighbours un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the papal juriſdiction, we ſhall
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0493202200:36"/>there find credulity in (if poſſible) a more glaring, abſurd light. When we reflect on this prevailing folly of mankind; and that phyſick was once in the hands of prieſts, ſubjected to all the impoſitions paganiſm, ignorance and ſuperſtition could deviſe; we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wonder there ſhould remain ſome tints of its former ſubordination.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are wanting either of leiſure or abilities to think for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in matters of ſcience, are apt to place too great a faith in all that is told them: hence a continuance of error. And I think it is pretty obvious, while this oral tradition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues, there ever will be ſome, who will rely on the influence of the moon and ſtars; the powers of amulets and charms; and all ſuch idle, unphiloſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical notions.</p>
            <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0493202200:37"/>
            <p>The ſame chain of ideas, that ſhews the impropriety of believing the cure of a tooth-ach by a charm; the deſtruction of warts, by turning thief, and ſtealing raw meat; the cure of the cramp, by wearing roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary, or placing the ſoals of our ſhoes uppermoſt when we go to bed: I ſay, the ſame chain of ideas that ſhews the impropriety of believing theſe abſurdities, will, when applied with a real deſire to be informed, whether the imagination in pregnant women poſſeſſes the powers aſcribed, convince the enquirer, that the tales told of the mother's imagination ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted on the foetus, are a collection of falſities formed by ſuperſtition and ignorance, and continued by preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice and credulity.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0493202200:38"/>
            <p>I have now, ladies, finiſhed my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended plan. Am ſenſible how dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult a taſk it is to remove deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rooted prejudice: but, however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful my attempt may be to that purpoſe, my intentions, I flatter myſelf, are irreproachable: and if the arguments I have uſed, have not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient weight to induce my fair rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to adopt my opinion, they are ſuch as will not incur her cenſure.</p>
