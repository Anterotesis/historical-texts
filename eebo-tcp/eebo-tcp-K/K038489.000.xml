            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE outline of the following Opera (written about ten years ago, by way of relaxation from ſeverer ſtudies) was taken from the <hi>Country Laſſes</hi> of Mr. <hi>Charles Johnſon,</hi> particularly the pleaſing and romantic epiſode, borrowed from the <hi>Cuſtom of the Country</hi> of <hi>Beaumont and Fletcher.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The author, in accommodating his plan to the preſent taſte, was led, of courſe, to reject the revolting abſurdity of ſuppoſing the cuſtom in queſtion ſtill to ſubſiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0601100600:4"/>The conſiderable alterations and addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, alſo, which he found it expedient to make, both in the plot and dialogue, have ſo much diverſified the whole, that it has been as <hi>truly</hi> as <hi>ill-naturedly</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, <q>the piece reſembles a coat, ſtolen a ſecond time from a thief, ſo metamorphoſed, that the very tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, who firſt cut it out, would not know the handy-work of his own ſhears.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is no wonder that, in this age of <hi>originality,</hi> ſo many <hi>truly-original</hi> cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics, who never play at <hi>rob-thief</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſhould ſufficiently rally him on ſo artful and complete a transformation, He cannot help thinking, however, that theſe <hi>very honeſt</hi> gentlemen are a little unreaſonable in expecting him to do ſuch <hi>great things</hi> merely for his <hi>amuſement,</hi> as are done by thoſe who make play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing their ſerious <hi>occupation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:0601100600:5"/>If, therefore, this opera hath hitherto met with an approbation <note n="*" place="bottom">If it afford any conſolation to the profeſſional dramatiſts, who envy him this approbation, they may reſt ſatisfied, he is by no means diſpoſed even to amuſe himſelf any more the ſame way.</note> as general as even the beſt of their moſt elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate productions; the author cannot but impute it to the excellent acting of the theatrical performers, and the elegant taſte of the muſical compoſer.</p>

                  <p>Poh! that a man might do for an hundred women, he was never in love with. To die for a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, Manly, is a mere piece of gallantry. But to marry her, boy, is to live for her, a ſerious piece of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and perhaps with her too, which is—out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion, egad, and that is worſe than being out of the world by half.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Yet that I could bear with Flora.—fame, fortune, friendſhip, all put into the balance againſt her, appear light as a feather. My regard for her will be laſting as life.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
                  <p>Then you muſt die ſoon, Manly, take my word for it. However, if you have a mind to put your paſſion to a violent death, you will take the readieſt way. Marriage is as certain a remedy for love, as an incurable mortification is for all other diſorders.</p>

                  <p>Convert thyſelf, my friend. To marry a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man merely for her beauty, is to enſlave your whole body for the gratification only of your eyes.

                  <p>Well, Sir; as I find your character and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions are honourable, I am ſatisfied. I have no other objection to make than the general one againſt unequal and precipitate marriages. I could wiſh your affections had been of ſlower growth, to have taken deeper root. Beauty is like a rich but ſhallow ſoil. It is fertile; but I always ſuſpect its ſudden ſhoots come up too haſtily to be vigorous or laſting.</p>

You muſt ride ſome miles, and that expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly too, to procure a licence and get tacked toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within canonical hours.</p>

                  <p>Fairly jilted, by Jupiter! Here have I been waiting, like an aſs, the return of a ſkittiſh young filly, till it is broad day-light. By the noiſes that have continued all the while in the houſe, one would imagine this out-of-the-way old fellow kept his family up all night; or at leaſt that, like a ſhip's crew, they, kept watch and watch about. If I am not revenged of the little devils for playing me this trick.—Ha! here comes my arch little ſimpleton alone. An early riſer, 'faith. She may chance to get a fall before night.

               <stage>SCENE a Meadow near the Farm-Houſe.</stage>

                  <p>A fine time of day for a cool thruſt, juſt in the heat of the ſun. Egad I have no appetite for it. I wiſh it was over. But where's my rival! I am before my time, I ſee. <stage>[Looking at his watch.]</stage> Ha! Manly.</p>
               </sp>
               <stage>Enter Sir <hi>John Manly.</hi>

                  <speaker>Manly.</speaker>
                  <p>George, what are you doing here?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
                  <p>Doing. I have been looking about the fields for you. Where the deuce have you been all this morning, that I could not get a ſight of you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Manly.</speaker>
                  <p>With my charming Flora, to be ſure. Where ſhould I have been?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, and you have brought her to reaſon at laſt, have you?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Manly.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope ſo.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
                  <p>Ay, ay. I told you the way—Marry her, indeed! A fine ſcheme!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Manly.</speaker>
                  <p>True that's all over. I may go to bed to her now if I will, without aſking leave of the parſon.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
                  <p>If you will! And won't you? What the devil, have you more ſcruples than the girl?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Manly.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, faith, ſhe is ſo innocent and credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous that I cannot bear the thoughts of impoſing on her ſimplicity.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
                  <p>Well then, marry her afterwards, if you like it. But I may ſafely truſt you for that; you are too

good a friend to population to encourage the incloſure of commons.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Manly.</speaker>
                  <p>This ſpot, however, is neither common nor waſte, George; and a little legal incloſure is a convenience to life, when the land has been carefully cultivated.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, yes, it has been cultivated. I'll war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant it—But you cannot intend to marry the wench.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Manly.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, I did intend it in the morning.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Wild.</speaker>
                  <p>What, to take the refuſe of a clod-hopper to your bed, and ſhare her favours perhaps with a plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</p>

                  <p>Yes, the Baronet intercepted us, in our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from church, and infiſted on the celebration of our marriage at the manor houſe. You'll give us your company, George. <stage>Exit.</stage>

                  <p>Being a humoriſt and a man of pleaſure, he lately took it into his head to revive the obſolete cuſtom, I was going to tell you of; by promiſing a handſome marriage portion to a tenant's daughter, on condition of her indulging him in the privilege of a huſband on her wedding-night.</p>

                  <p>True, Sir John, that is as you take it; but the point is, your ſpouſe is the damſel, on whom my kinſman has promiſed to beſtow his bounty, and as he is ready to fulfil his part of the agreement, he thinks he has a right to inſiſt on the performance of covenants on the part of the bride.</p>

                  <p>Gadſo, but I am very ſerious, Sir John. The maiden, never dreaming it would be her lot to meet with a huſband, who ſhould object to the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the obligation, thought there was no harm in thus providing herſelf with ſomething to begin the world with. But, if you refuſe your conſent, to be ſure, the landlord muſt forego his claim.</p>

                  <p>Oh, yes, it is very poſſible that things ſhould be as they are. Well, Sir John, what ſay you now? Shall the marriage be conſummated or not?
