            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IT may be neceſſary to inform the Reader, who has not ſeen the following Sketch repreſented on the Stage, that the character of <hi>Apewell</hi> is meant merely as a vehicle for Mr. Caulfield's <hi>Imitations:</hi> with which both the Mimick, and the Author of the Piece, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, the reſpectable perſons imitated, have too much good ſenſe to be offended. They are given as <hi>Portraits,</hi> not as <hi>Caricatures;</hi> and the Publick has pronounced them to be ſtrong, but unexaggerated likeneſſes of originals, whom its diſcernment has long patroniſed and admired.</p>
            <p>Although the Author has been a litte free with his good friends the Winter Managers, (who are a little free with his Seaſon) he thinks it needleſs to offer any apology to them.

               <speaker>DAGGERWOOD.</speaker>
               <p>Fifteen years ſince I firſt ſmelt the lamp, Sir. My father was an eminent Button-maker, at Bir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mingham; and meant to marry me to Miſs Molly Metre, daughter to the rich Director of the Coal-works, at Wolverhampton: but I had a ſoul above buttons, and abhorred the idea of a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary marriage. I panted for a liberal profeſſion —ſo ran away from my father, and engaged with a travelling company of Comedians. In my travels, I had ſoon the happineſs of forming a romantick attachment with the preſent Mrs. Daggerwood— wife to Sylveſter Daggerwood, your humble ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant to command, whoſe benefit is fixed for the eleventh of June, by the particular deſire of ſeveral perſons of diſtinction. So, you ſee, Sir, I have a taſte.</p>

               <p>The title, I think will ſtrike. The faſhion of Plays, you know, now, is to do away old preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices; and to reſcue certain characters from the illiberal odium with which cuſtom has mark'd them.
