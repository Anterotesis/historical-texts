            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>I COULD not contrive to meet with Mr. Howard till dinner was announced, at which he ſeemed abſent and abſorbed; but as I then ſat next him, I aſked him to allow me to talk with him when we left the table.</p>
               <p>It is juſt the requeſt I was going to make, ſaid he: and when the ladies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to tea and coffee, under pretence of buſineſs he made his excuſes to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and joined me in Mrs. Hindon's dreſſing room.</p>
               <p>No time is to be loſt, dear Sir, ſaid I to him the moment he entered, in chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:1034200203:3"/>
our abode. The ſooner the alteration in our circumſtances takes place, the ſooner ſhall we be enabled to conquer that reluctance which it muſt at firſt occaſion. We have been unwillingly conſtrained, from a cruel peculiarity in our fate, to prove a burthen on the humanity of our friends too long. I will not wound your delicacy by touching on the unſpeakable obligations under which you have laid us, and for which ſimple gratitude is I fear all the return that will ever be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to teſtify; that however you may be aſſured is warm from our hearts, and never can be effaced from our remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: but your ſiſter, Mrs. Hindon, we have incommoded greatly too long. I have been conſidering many different plans, continued I; but as a ſtrict eco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy muſt be the baſis of all our ſchemes, and that is in fact an art I have yet to learn, it is not eaſy to fix; neither, from my ſhort reſidence in this country, am I
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1034200203:4"/>
an adequate judge of the ſafety or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of any ſtep, without aſking the advice and aſſiſtance of that friend whom Fate has left us. Do you imagine how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, without being too laviſh of your trouble, that a reputable family might be found who would conſent immediately to receive us for a moderate ſum, till that mode of life can be clearly aſcertained of which our finances will hereafter allow.</p>
               <p>Perhaps there might, ſaid he. But ſurely Miſs Seymour you do not think of removing immediately.</p>
               <p>You do not ſeem to approve of this ſcheme, cried I, finding he ſaid nothing more and ſeemed buried in thought. Is there any other you would adviſe?</p>
               <p>Ah, Miſs Seymour! cried he at laſt; there is a ſcheme—but I tremble to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it.</p>
               <p>At theſe words his face was overſpread with a confuſion which covered mine with bluſhes. The ſeriouſneſs of his
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:1034200203:5"/>
manner, the embarraſſment that had ſeized him, and an unuſual expreſſion of ſoftneſs in his countenance, altogether infuſed ſuſpicions into my mind of the moſt diſtreſſing nature: but Mr. Howard inſtantly recovered his dignity, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my hand with a benevolent ſmile, as if he had really penetrated into my thoughts and read my apprehenſions.—Be not alarmed, ſaid he; preſumptuous my ſecret wiſhes perhaps once were, but I have been long ſenſible of their utter impropriety; and the conviction that they never could be crowned with ſucceſs has long ſince nipped them in the bud. It is indeed a plan on which the whole hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of my future life depends, but of which I now confeſs to you your lovely ſiſter is the object.</p>
               <p>Situated as I was, continued he, (for I knew not what reply to make) an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate for months in your family, under the title of your father's friend, I enjoyed
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1034200203:6"/>
a dangerous intimacy to which no other man had acceſs. The ſnare, even at forty three, was not to be avoided; for where the mind and form both equally conſpire to charm and ſeduce, no age is exempted from feeling their united force. Againſt ſuch there is no defence, and one only cure; for where hope is completely extinguiſhed paſſion ſeldom continues to torment. In this caſe it often changes both its nature and its name, and melio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating into a tender friendſhip, conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes a leſs ſelfiſh gratification inſtead of proving the miſery of our lives.</p>
               <p>This, Miſs Seymour, has been exactly my caſe. My efforts however to eſcape from one danger have led me into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther no leſs inſinuating. Tho' I intreat you to believe me, when I ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that I never was for one moment either ſo mad or ſo intereſted as to wiſh for my own enjoyment at the price of your amiable ſiſter's proſperity; nor
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1034200203:7"/>
while her future proſpects ſeemed favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and her ſituation in life promiſed to prove almoſt equal to her merits, ſhould any conſideration on earth have induced me to make known my preſent preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I ſhould have had then no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining wiſh but for her happineſs and ſucceſs in every purſuit. The diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of my wiſhes as to the latter, has however given birth to hopes that the firſt is not ſtill unattainable, and induced me to flatter myſelf that ſhould ſhe deign to allow of my moſt zealous endeavours to contribute to it, it may not prove be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my power in ſome meaſure to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſole her for what ſhe has loſt.</p>
               <p>Do not however imagine, that I ſhall ſo far deſcend from my age and charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as to be offended by a refuſal. An admirer at my time of life muſt not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to aſſume the lover of twenty. I am aware of the great inequality of our years, and of many other objections your
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1034200203:8"/>
ſiſter may feel, and the force of which ſhe may not be able to ſurmount. If howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhe thinks, after conſulting with you, that there are any advantages to compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate theſe obſtacles, if the warmeſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment and the moſt unbounded in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, if my legal protection, and the command of a fortune much too narrow, alas! for her pretenſions and almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath her acceptance, yet with which I flatter myſelf a mind like her's could be contented;—if theſe circumſtances weigh in any degree againſt the oppoſite ſcale, I muſt ſo far adopt the language of a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as to declare that ſhe will literally render me the happieſt of men. I ſhall receive her hand as a freſh bleſſing from heaven, and regard it as a condeſcenſion for which I ſhall ever conſider myſelf her debtor.</p>
               <p>Some hints in this ſpeech of Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard's had confuſed me ſo extremely, that I made no attempt to anſwer or interrupt
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1034200203:9"/>
him, except by bowing my head in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the compliments he paid me. Finding however that he now expected a reply, I thanked him in my ſiſter's name for the honour of his good opinion; as to what ſucceſs his propoſal might receive, I declared myſelf wholly ignorant; grateful ſhe cannot fail to prove, ſaid I, but what lengths that ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent may carry her, I am unable to conjecture.</p>
               <p>If Miſs Fanny, ſaid he, elated with the gay hopes and lively proſpects of youth, ſhould think with reluctance on uniting herſelf to a man whoſe age correſponds ſo ill with her own, I muſt regret with fervor, but never ſhall repine at her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. There is one obſtacle how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, Miſs Seymour, which ſeverely damps my feeble hopes, and is indeed the circumſtance that has induced me to open my intentions firſt to you, as it is a particular in which I imagine you can
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1034200203:10"/>
fully ſatisfy me, and on which it ſolely depends whether I ſhall immediately mention this intereſting ſubject to your ſiſter, or be ſilent on it for ever. I have remarked, ſince her abode here, that your ſiſter has had a very zealous admirer, who cannot have failed I imagine in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting from the many opportunities he has enjoyed of ſoliciting her favor.</p>
               <p>Of Captain Wilmot, cried I, you need have no apprehenſions. I hope you do Fanny the juſtice to believe that the aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duities of ſuch a rival are by no means formidable.</p>
               <p>He poſſeſſes at leaſt youth and good looks in his favour, replied Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard; but you relieve my mind from a weight of painful anxiety, as this is a bar which muſt not only have proved wholly inſurmountable, but one of thoſe to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate which I could not even have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted; for though I ſhall not expect the heart of my miſtreſs, I muſt poſſeſs a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1034200203:11"/>
certain degree of her attachment; a wiſh to pleaſe, and a willingneſs to be pleaſed, on which to build my hopes of gaining the affections of my wife: without this I ſhould be myſelf miſerable, nor would it be in my power to render her happy.</p>
               <p>If ſhe cannot compleatly beſtow her heart, my dear Sir, cried I, may ſhe like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe withhold her hand. But I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my ſiſter is too ſenſible of the value of your's, to trifle with a propoſal ſo ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous and diſintereſted. If—for our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are not always in our own power, and the caprice of taſte is but too often at variance with reaſon and judgment—if ſhe cannot make a proper return, I am certain you have too much delicacy to wiſh her your's and too much good ſenſe to be offended.</p>
               <p>Offended! Miſs Seymour: be aſſured I never ſhall be offended; and believe me, hardly ſurpriſed.</p>
               <p>As Mr. Howard pronounced theſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1034200203:12"/>
words, Fanny opened the door of the dreſſing room and looked in. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, cried ſhe, are much aſtoniſhed at your long abſence; and Mrs. Hindon is ſo entertained with your tete a tete, that ſhe is abſolutely become witty on the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. I wiſh you would therefore ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in your own defence, for I am quite fatigued in finding excuſes for you.</p>
               <p>This ſhe ſaid with an air of gaiety that was inſtantly checked on perceiving the embarraſſment her ſudden appearance at this juncture occaſioned. Mr. Howard ſeemed rather at a loſs, and on his account I could not avoid feeling conſcious. Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny finding I anſwered her with ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of awkwardneſs, looked firſt to the one, then to the other, as if with a deſign of penetrating into the cauſe of our being ſo evidently diſconcerted; and obſerving the raillery in the drawing room accord ſo well with the confuſed ſituation into which her appearance had thrown us,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1034200203:13"/>
ſhe gave way to an expreſſive ſmile, and regarding me with an air that ſufficiently explained her ſuſpicions, haſtily ſhut the dreſſing-room door, and departed as if determined not to interrupt us.</p>
               <p>At this little manoeuvre, which plainly diſcovered her falſe concluſions on ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing us, I could not refrain from laughing; and even Mr. Howard was not able to reſiſt half ſmiling at her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. We then ſeparated; but I was forced to ſupport the whole weight of Mrs. Hindon's ridicule on being ſo long tete a tete with her brother. Her wit, however deficient in other reſpects, claims the merit of being voluble and keen in the extreme; but happily the entrance of more company ſoon relieved me.</p>
               <p>Fanny's countenance during the whole evening exhibited a picture of ſly mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſignificance, which it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely amuſing to behold. Every fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſeemed filled with the importance of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1034200203:14"/>
a newly-diſcovered ſecret: but in ſo large a party all explanation was impoſſible; and indeed had ſhe ever found an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity for importuning me on the ſubject, I had determined in my own mind to leave her under the influence of an unjuſt ſurmiſe rather than anticipate Mr. Howard's declaration.</p>
               <p>One of the company happening to mention with great encomiums an Italian performer who is expected in this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in the courſe of a month, all the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were expreſſing their eager expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of then ſeeing him. I fancy Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mione, whiſpered Fanny, we ſhall be mighty ſnug at Hubert Hill, (Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard's country ſeat,) by that time.</p>
               <p>Perhaps we may, returned I with a gay air, which confirming her ſuſpicions ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to give her much delight.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howard at that inſtant joining us, ſhe ſeemed ready to laugh in his face out of <hi>gayetê du coeur.</hi> Oh! cried ſhe, ſtill
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1034200203:15"/>
in a ſoft voice to me, it will be ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; tho' to own the truth I was afraid that haughty couſin of ours might have ſtood in the way.</p>
               <p>You are intirely out of the ſecret, ſaid I. But pray be quiet.</p>
               <p>We were then called to a party at Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and an end put to our little tete a tete, which merely ſerved to ſtrengthen Fanny in her error. Oh, thought I to myſelf, while I obſerved her eyes ſparkle with the proſpect of a happy termination thus appearing to the uncertainties and difficulties of our preſent uncomfortable ſituation, will the ſame ſatisfaction brighten your countenance and lighten your heart, my deareſt Fanny, when you find you are yourſelf the object that is to inſure us this advantage.</p>
               <p>Captain Wilmot, who has been (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps deſignedly,) out of town ever ſince our affairs have worn an unfavourable ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, came in for a few moments.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1034200203:16"/>
His addreſs to Fanny was conſtrained; her's to him, haughty, diſdainful, and contemptuous. It is not like Fanny to ſhew ſo much ſpirit; but affronted va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity will it ſeems excite a pride otherwiſe foreign to the character. It was eaſy to diſcern that he had been apprized of the change in our circumſtances. Every word, every look and motion, betrayed not the timidity of a lover but the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment and perplexity of a man who felt himſelf involved in difficulties and knew not how to act. I was charmed with Fanny's behaviour. She not only ſupported her own dignity, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly mortified the poor Captain, who tho' happy to be thus diſmiſſed, could not feel much gratified from perceiving the indifference with which the conqueſt was relinquiſhed.</p>
               <p>When the company were gone, and Fanny and I by ourſelves, ſhe interrogated me as to the tete a tete converſation that
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1034200203:17"/>
had paſſed; but I perſiſted in evading all her enquiries; for it is but juſtice to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Mr. Howard to plead his own cauſe, while her mind is unbiaſſed by any pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious determination. Let him at leaſt reap what benefit may reſult from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced ſurprize on finding herſelf warmly ſolicited by a man whom I know ſhe eſteems and reſpects.</p>
               <p>I believe you will not be aſtoniſhed, when I confeſs that did I think this a point in which it would be allowable for me to interfere, I ſhould prove a warm advocate in Mr. Howard's favour, and that I anxiouſly wiſh this union may take place. Did Fanny's heart feel the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt repugnance, far ſhould I be from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring an event, againſt which in that caſe principle and delicacy would equally revolt: but if ſhe is capable of enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſuch ſentiments as will allow her without reluctance to beſtow her hand on that amiable man, I think I could al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1034200203:18"/>
pronounce her felicity in the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage ſtate ſecured; and what a happy aſylum in our preſent ſituation muſt the houſe of Mr. Howard prove, when au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to live under his continued pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection by the ties of relationſhip as well as by thoſe of friendſhip. It is indeed an event which muſt at once relieve us from the difficulties that ſeem to await our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connected ſtate. Yet you may conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I would not for worlds inſinuate a hint towards urging her to a ſtep with which, in her place, I feel at this moment I myſelf could not comply.</p>
               <p>My ſiſter ſeemed diſappointed on find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her conjectures had been without foundation, and warmly joined in ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the praiſes of Mr. Howard; adding, that in ſpite of the diſproportion of our ages there was no man ſhe would eſteem ſo highly as a brother. Yet Sophia, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted as we ſometimes flatter our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves we are, we view with different
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1034200203:19"/>
eyes the ſame object when regarded as our own choice or as that of even our deareſt and moſt intimate friend; and forcible as were Fanny's expreſſions, I cannot conjecture with any degree of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty how ſhe will act. My influence over her mind is not trifling; but even were I ſtill more convinced than I am that I ſhould aſcertain her happineſs by promoting this affair, I ſhould not poſſeſs reſolution ſufficient for interfering on a point of ſuch infinite moment, eſpecially at this time, when a peculiar delicacy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters me. Fanny, on my account as well as her own, may wiſh to conquer a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance ſo adverſe to our mutual comfort and which ſo many powerful motives of prudence and reaſon oppoſe, while at the ſame time this conflict may prove ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, that it were cruelty to adviſe a ſtep which may in this caſe be denominated a ſacrifice.</p>

                  <p>On our return from morning prayers, I retired to read in my own apartment. Fanny remained in the parlour below, but joined me an hour after in the utmoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation. On entering, ſhe haſtily ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached me, and throwing her arms around my neck, burſt into a flood of tears, which inſtantly informed me of what ſhe was unable by words to expreſs.</p>
                  <p>My deareſt girl, ſaid I, whence pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds this agitation?</p>
                  <p>She could not immediately reply: but at laſt—Oh Hermione! exclaimed ſhe, what have I to tell you—Mr. Howard is my lover.</p>
                  <p>Well my dear, ſaid I ſmiling, that is no very great calamity.</p>
                  <p>Good, heavens! could you ever have ſuſpected ſuch a thing? Could you ever have imagined that any thing ſo unlucky would have happened!</p>
                  <p>I believe I could, anſwered I. But
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1034200203:21"/>
why unlucky? How comes it that the mere mention of a propoſal which muſt be at leaſt acknowledged diſintereſted, from an amiable and worthy object, ſhould give you this uneaſineſs. There are no rigid guardians to urge your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance, nor, alas! parents to command your obedience; and believe me, my love, your ſiſter will not even preſume to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe on a ſubject in which your own feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſentiments only are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted.</p>
                  <p>I ſoon found, however, that her tears were thoſe of agitation, doubt, and timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity. Diſguſt and repugnance had no part in her emotions. She confeſſed ſhe eſteemed Mr. Howard; that ſhe believed him one of the beſt men in the world; but I never once thought of being his wife, ſaid ſhe. I regarded him as a friend ſent by heaven to conſole us for the loſs of one parent who is gone for ever, and of another who diſowns us. I cannot
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1034200203:22"/>
think of marrying him. The idea is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt unnatural; for the poſſibility of ſuch an event never entered my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Indeed I always concluded his partiality to me was that of a father, and that the diſparity of our years would have alone proved ſufficient to have prevented the very notion of ſuch an attachment. Had it been you, I ſhould not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced the ſlighteſt ſurprize; for I have more than once ſuſpected that he loved you, particularly before we left Languedoc; but for myſelf, I always imagined he viewed me in the light of a girl who might have amuſed perhaps, but who had no likelihood of intereſting him. Oh! what made him think of me, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated ſhe ſeveral times in the greateſt perplexity.</p>
                  <p>Calm your agitation my dear Fanny, cried I. Conſider you are ſolicited, but not compelled. I have on my part long ſuſpected that you was the object of Mr.
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1034200203:23"/>
Howard's affections, and I ſincerely own have ſecretly wiſhed his paſſion that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs which in my opinion it ſo juſtly me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. I am convinced the attachment and protection of a character like his muſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure happineſs to the woman whom he honours with his choice, provided her heart is properly diſpoſed for feeling and anſwering the tenderneſs of his. If this is however wanting, believe me Mr. Howard himſelf has too much delicacy to demand the hand which prudence alone beſtows on him; and I am certain poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes too large a ſhare both of good ſenſe and modeſty to be diſobliged. If then you feel the leaſt actual repugnance to this union, after having maturely weighed and conſidered all ſides of the queſtion, heſitate not to tell him ſo without co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quetry or affectation.</p>
                  <p>Repugnance is a ſtrong word, ſaid ſhe, after a pauſe. We are under infinite ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations to him, and he is our only friend.
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1034200203:24"/>
I ſhould be ſhocked to diſoblige him. But he has ſo ſurprized me, that I know not what to think of the matter, nor how to collect my ſcattered thoughts to pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der on the conſequences. Now tell me ſeriouſly Hermione, what would you do in my caſe?</p>
                  <p>Why I will tell you ſincerely, ſaid I. Were I you, with your diſpoſition, your gratitude to Mr. Howard, and your indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to every other man, I believe I ſhould be his wife.</p>
                  <p>Yet I am not the leaſt in love with him, cried ſhe.</p>
                  <p>Involuntarily I was about to reply, that being romantically in love was by all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts far from an indiſpenſible requiſite towards happineſs in the married ſtate; but conſcious how different my own pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ſentiments were from according with this opinion, I checked myſelf from touching on an argument that carried not conviction to my own mind, though from
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1034200203:25"/>
my knowledge of Fanny's temper it might have been not improperly offered to her, and only added, that her own feelings muſt direct her.</p>
                  <p>We were interrupted by Mrs. Hindon, who came to inform us that the carriage waited to carry us to afternoon prayers. I believe poor Fanny's devotions were not a little diſturbed; and on our return I obſerved ſhe met the eyes of Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard with a confuſion which ſeemed to forebode no great ſeverity.</p>
                  <p>I had evidently ſhewn on which ſide my ſuffrage reſted; but I cautiouſly withheld any advice likely to prejudice her mind, which tho' diffident and fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, appeared neither averſe nor deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.</p>

               <p>WELL, my dear Sophia, after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments ſo ſevere, and proſpects ſo chearleſs and dreary, the ſcene begins to brighten. Fanny has at laſt yielded in Mr. Howard's favour, and finds herſelf perfectly ſatisfied and at eaſe now that her future fate ſeems determined.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howard appears delighted with his good fortune, tho' a propriety of feeling peculiar to himſelf deters him from teſtifying it in a manner too pointed. An admirer after forty muſt not, as he juſtly obſerved, adopt the behaviour of one twenty years younger. There is a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1034200203:27"/>
dignity ſuited to that period, which even love, all-powerful love, muſt not entirely diſcard. He poſſeſſes all the tenderneſs, while he has exploded the flights of a lover; and Fanny, who imagined that courtſhip muſt be ſerious, aweful and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal, and that ſhe ſhould find an unuſual embarraſſment attend her new ſituation, is charmed to perceive that Mr. Howard is exactly what he was before, and that ſhe is if poſſible ſtill more at eaſe with him than formerly.</p>
               <p>This is rendered more practicable, as they have taken the precaution of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent poſture of affairs a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſecret from this family; nor do they intend informing them how matters are likely to be concluded till it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary any longer to retain them in ignorance. Indeed Mrs. Hindon's entire diſregard of delicacy, added to her paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for raillery, makes her the laſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:1034200203:28"/>
with whom one would incline to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt a ſubject of this nature.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howard is extremely urgent with Fanny to have the ceremony which is to unite them as ſoon as poſſible performed; and as a thouſand reaſons conſpire to make us wiſh ourſelves no longer a burthen on the conſtrained civilities of Mrs. Hindon, Fanny has promiſed that after the uſual forms of law are concluded, ſhe ſhall not invent unneceſſary delays.</p>
               <p>Since my laſt Mrs. Hindon has more than once renewed her favorite topic. It is not without infinite reluctance that ſhe relinquiſhes any plan to which in her own mind ſhe has attached an importance. Lady Farnford however ſeems to have given up all hope; and her ſon, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand from Miſs Parſons, has been twice refuſed admittance at Mrs. Hindon's door, in purſuance no doubt of his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's requeſt to her friend to give no countenance or encouragement to a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1034200203:29"/>
now deprived of all the oſtentatious advantages that once rendered it ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable.</p>
               <p>Captain Wilmot appears to bear his diſappointment with an admirable good grace; though the frigid hauteur with which Fanny behaved to him the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they met, by diſcovering the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of her heart, and opening his eyes to the falſity of his ſelf-ſufficient ſecurity of her affections, muſt have proved very little gratifying to the all-potent vanity of his character. He has taken care to be conſtantly engaged ever ſince, except one morning, when he found courage to ſtep in for ten minutes. Fanny was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove ſtairs when he entered; but fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him a ſhort time after into the parlour. He bluſhed extremely, and appeared much embarraſſed on paying her the uſual compliments; nor did his awkwardneſs ſeem leſs conſpicuous from an air of forced gayety with which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1034200203:30"/>
to diſguiſe it. Finding his ſituation, in ſpite of all his efforts, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly uncomfortable, he made haſte to change it, and abruptly took leave.</p>

                  <p>Fanny and Mr. Howard have this day had a long converſation together, in the courſe of which he laid before her the ſtate of his finances, and ſuggeſted the plan of life which he thought would be moſt conducive to their mutual happineſs.</p>
                  <p>His paternal eſtate, Hubert Hill, does not exceed three hundred and twenty pounds a year; and this, with a couple of thouſands bequeathed him by a friend, conſtitutes his whole fortune; nor has he any addition to hope for independent of my ſiſter's precarious pittance when Mr. Benſeley's affairs are ſettled. This no doubt is a very ſlender income, eſpecially
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1034200203:31"/>
if a numerous family ſhould bleſs their union; yet as Mr. Howard is a man of moderate views, and addicted to no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive pleaſures, and Fanny has ever been accuſtomed to ſolitude and fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity if not abſolutely to a ſtrict oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, I think it ſufficient, with ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, for all the neceſſary indulgencies of life.</p>
                  <p>His little feat is ſituated, he ſays, in a delightful part of the country. The grounds are laid out with taſte; and the houſe, tho' ſmall, is fitted up with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite neatneſs in a ruſtic ſtyle. This he propoſes making their conſtant reſidence; and hopes, by living himſelf on the ſpot, to improve it to great advantage, being extremely fond of farming himſelf.</p>
                  <p>He did not fail, in the very firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Fanny's approbation, to give me the warmeſt and moſt preſſing invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to join their family. Indeed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that condition I believe he never
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1034200203:32"/>
would have prevailed with his bride, for ſhe has ever expreſſed the moſt painful reluctance at the idea of being ſeparated from me. It was no ſmall ſatisfaction to me however, to perceive the cordiality and eagerneſs with which Mr. Howard made this requeſt. Partial as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been, ſaid he, to the abode of my youth, with how much delight muſt I now enjoy it, when bleſt with compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions who poſſeſs the power of converting any ſpot into a paradiſe.</p>
                  <p>He ſets out for Hubert Hill to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, to give the neceſſary directions previous to our going down; and in the mean while all other preparations are making, that the ceremony may take place as ſoon as he returns. Are you not entertained with Fanny's metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis into a ſedate, ruſtic farmer's wife, who when you knew her but three years ago was a little wild giddy girl of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen. I am ſatisfied however ſhe will
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1034200203:33"/>
conduct herſelf to admiration in that ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. She is poſſeſſed of a very chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, contented diſpoſition, the firſt bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Providence; and the reverſes of fortune which the laſt five months have produced, by compleatly convincing her of the fallaciouſneſs of her ſanguine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of the gay enjoyments of the world, formed in ignorance and ſolitude, have diſpoſed her mind for reliſhing and returning to the pure pleaſures of retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and domeſtic life. In ſociety, ſhe has experienced only mortifications, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointments, and diſguſts, inſtead of finding it, as ſhe had concluded, a ſcene of perpetual gaiety, admiration, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. In lieu of univerſal conqueſt, her admirers have been tranſient, and her lover inſincere. She has made no friends ſince ſhe left France; and is therefore the more eager to cement to herſelf him who has proved on trial ſtrongly and truly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="33" facs="tcp:1034200203:34"/>As for myſelf, this event is every thing I can wiſh. It ſecures me an agreeable home with thoſe I love, and conveys me from this hateful city, which I wiſh from my ſoul I had never entered.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Howard is returned from his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion, much pleaſed with ſome little improvements he has begun; and the papers are now ready for ſigning. Mr. Howard, in the event of no family, leaves his wife ſole heireſs of all he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes: but ſhould any children ſpring from this marriage, her jointure is two hundred per annum. Having no friend to conſult on this occaſion, all ſhe feared was Mr. Howard's too great generoſity; and as ſhe was aſhamed even to mention pecuniary matters to him, I was unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly obliged on this occaſion to be her
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1034200203:35"/>
agent, and abſolutely inſiſted that if her own money, ſhould any be recovered, was ſettled upon her as he propoſed, a deduction of equal value ſhould be made from this ſtipulation. Every thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore relative to ſettlements is finally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted; and but that Fanny's timidity makes her catch at trifles to delay the aweful ceremony, things ere now would have been concluded.</p>
                  <p>Fearing Mrs. Hindon would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſobliged at Fanny's conduct in concealing from her this affair, I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded her the other day to confeſs her preſent ſituation; and ſuggeſted that as that lady, from whatever motives, had received us into her family, and teſtified towards us a thouſand civilities with great apparent hoſpitality and kindneſs, ſhe had reaſon to be not a little offended at the want of confidence and cordiality this ſecrecy betrayed; beſides common report would ſoon render all further con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealment
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1034200203:36"/>
uſeleſs, and deprive Fanny of an opportunity of paying her the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment of confidence.</p>
                  <p>She intreated me to undertake this commiſſion for her. It was not an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able one; but as to Fanny it would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps have been ſtill more awkward, I conſented.</p>
                  <p>Good heavens! cried Mrs. Hindon, as ſoon as I had hinted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>he connection which was likely ſoon to place my ſiſter among the liſt of her relations—married to my brother! Miſs Fanny to be my brother's wife! Well I declare he is extremely ſly, for I could have laid a bet that you were his favorite of the two. He is a bold man however, to think of incumbering himſelf with a wife and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in his preſent circumſtances. I wiſh them happy with all my heart; but I plainly perceive he had his own private reaſons for regarding my poor nephew's propoſals with ſo much diſapprobation.
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1034200203:37"/>
Well, every one for themſelves in this world; but I always ſuſpect ſome ſelf-intereſted motive at bottom when I hear ſuch a piece of work made about <hi>ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and ſo many profeſſions of <hi>diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted friendſhip</hi>; I think beſides, ſince matters were ſo far advanced, that Mr. Hindon and myſelf might have been ſooner made acquainted with a love af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair that was going on under our own roof.</p>
                  <p>I pleaded Fanny's diffidence as an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy; but my excuſe was in fact ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely lame, and was not eaſily admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Mrs. Hindon could with difficulty prevail on herſelf to pardon the diſreſpect. But this ſtory had gone in all points ſo contrary to her plans and wiſhes, that I could forgive a little ill humour occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by chagrin, and found it not on the whole ſo hard to reconcile her to it as I had feared. A marriage, tho' even not of her own negociating, afforded ſome
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1034200203:38"/>
ſpeculation for her active mind to work on; and ſo fond is ſhe of being officiouſly buſy, that ſhe has ſet off to-day, accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by Fanny, to aſſiſt with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt cordiality and eagerneſs in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of ſome bridal apparatus.</p>

                  <p>I had hardly laid down my pen this morning, when Mr. Roatſley was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.

                  <p>He comes, thought I, at once to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me how injurious were my ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions of his pride and duplicity, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his regret for the ill conduct of his relations, and to ſhew me how diſſimilar is his generous mind from that of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling mother.</p>
                  <p>So certain was I of the intention of his viſit, that I even wiſhed the explanation over, which muſt to him prove ſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſing, as it was likely ſo little to redound to the honor of his family, and expected every moment when the ſubject ſhould be introduced. But moſt care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1034200203:40"/>
did he guard againſt every topic that could lead to this point; which he evidently avoided with the moſt ſedulous precaution. Yet his manner poſſeſſed that inſinuating attention, and his voice that winning ſoftneſs, which ſeemed to imply the utmoſt ſatisfaction in my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and which beſtows on <hi>his</hi> a charm, that may be felt, Sophia, alas, too a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutely! but which cannot be delineated.</p>
                  <p>The intereſting elegance of his addreſs is indeed ſo uncommonly engaging, that I think it muſt be wholly impoſſible even for a ſtranger to behold him enter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out pleaſure, or ſee him depart without experiencing regret. It is not alone that he is perfectly well bred and intelligent, for from moderate parts, poliſhed by education and knowledge of the world, this may be expected, and uncharacte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtic of the Engliſh nation as the refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of good breeding is ſuppoſed to be, I have ſeen, ſince my reſidence here,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1034200203:41"/>
more than one perſon to whom I think that panegyric is juſtly due; but Mr. Roatſley's mind ſpeaks in his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and in his manner, and confers on every look and on every motion that grace which a diſpoſition compleatly amiable, and talents thoroughly well cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, cannot fail to diffuſe over the appearance and behaviour.</p>
                  <p>My firſt flutters giving way to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful eaſe of his converſation, I took courage at length to mention the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I owed him. I have been inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly deſirous, ſaid I, of an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to return you my moſt grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments for the attention and trouble you have been ſo humane as to beſtow upon an affair which has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned me more uneaſineſs and perplex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity than it is poſſible to conceive.</p>
                  <p>I am then extremely ſorry, cried he with warmth, that my preſence ſhould have induced you for an inſtant to recall
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1034200203:42"/>
a ſubject ſo painful. Let it be baniſhed, I beſeech you, for ever from your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, and along with it all ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of gratitude to which I cannot flatter myſelf I merit the ſlighteſt claim. Heaven knows what exertions I would make, what anxiety I would undergo, to merit the approbation of Miſs Seymour; but as yet I am not ſo happy as to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate myſelf with having had it in my power to perform any ſervice that could deſerve her thanks. Let me know my dear Madam, added he, by what means I can procure a title to that happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and you ſhall perceive, by the avi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity with which I ſhall obey your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, how infinitely I ſhould prize my good fortune in obliging you.</p>
                  <p>Does he wiſh me, thought I, to apply to him to interceed with Lord Belmont; or are theſe profeſſions mere words of courſe, to which are annexed neither meaning nor intention. I was piqued
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1034200203:43"/>
that he adhered ſo determinedly to the reſolutions of his relations, and only made a ſlight inclination of my head very gravely in return to this ſpeech.</p>
                  <p>A degree of ſurprize was evident in his countenance at the ſtatelineſs of my man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; the cauſe I think he muſt have been with eaſe able to comprehend. However he choſe to place it to another account; and finding that an air of chagrin invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily hung on my features——Miſs Seymour, ſaid he, after ſeveral ineffectual attempts to amuſe me on different ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects which a ſlight degree of penetration ſufficed to ſhew did not intereſt me—I cannot but perceive that I have been ſo unfortunate as to offend you; and ſo ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, ſo painful is this idea, that tho' my confeſſion may at firſt rather encreaſe than diminiſh your diſpleaſure, I cannot reſiſt truſting to your candour and indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence by a ſincere avowal of the only circumſtance wherein I think it is poſſible
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1034200203:44"/>
for me to have given cauſe for your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Finding I made no reply, for in truth I knew not what to anſwer—I ſincerely confeſs, continued be, and let, I beſeech you, the ſeverity of this confeſſion plead in my behalf, that after having been bleſt with your company that happy even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Dover, my ideas and expectations of the dignity of your behaviour were raiſed to ſo juſt an height, that they could not but ſuffer ſome abatement on witneſſing what I could not but conſider as an impropriety, and which I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Miſs Seymour herſelf would have regarded as an indelicacy. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious I ought to have judged leſs raſhly. I know that I ought to have ſuſpected my own eyes, rather than any indecorum in you; but I was led to do you injuſtice by a multiplicity of circumſtances, which can hardly have given more pain to your feelings than they have conveyed to mine;
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1034200203:45"/>
and you may recollect, Madam, that the inſtant you appeared ſtill more unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, inſtead of plunging deeper into doubt, I penetrated into the whole myſtery, and not only in my own mind fully acquitted you of the imprudence of a clandeſtine interview with a young man who merited only your ſcorn and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, but alſo immediately perceived that though the whole was wrapt in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity, the veil was not placed over your conduct by your own hands; and I no longer heſitated to aſk an explanation from Mr. Howard, ſince I was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleatly convinced all muſt redound to your honour.</p>
                  <p>Oh! Sir, cried I, penetrated by this ſpeech and the eagerneſs with which he entered on his juſtification, be aſſured when I reflect on this painful affair, it is not only without the ſlighteſt diſpleaſure at any part of your conduct, but with
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1034200203:46"/>
the utmoſt gratitude for the humane in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt you teſtified in it.</p>
                  <p>May I then flatter myſelf I am forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, cried he warmly, and kiſſed my hand with a fervor that dyed me with Crimſon.</p>
                  <p>I had juſt withdrawn it, when Mrs. Hindon and Fanny returned from their excurſion, followed by a ſervant loaded with various purchaſes.</p>
                  <p>I introduced Mr. Roatſley to Mrs. Hindon, who appeared much delighted with the acquiſition of an acquaintance of his rank and figure, and began con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with her accuſtomed volubility and avidity even before ſhe had ſeated herſelf.</p>
                  <p>As ſhe held a pretty large parcel in her hands, part of Fanny's paraphranalia, he politely offered to relieve her by plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it on the table.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps Sir, cried ſhe facetiouſly, theſe ladies may generouſly reward your
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1034200203:47"/>
trouble by preſenting you with part of the contents.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall be much delighted with the honor of any gift from theſe ladies, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned he. But pray may I be allowed to aſk of what nature is the donation?</p>
                  <p>Poor Fanny bluſhed up to the ears. Good God, Madam! cried ſhe, with a reproachful look.</p>
                  <p>Nay, anſwered ſhe, laughing immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, I'm ſure I ſhan't tell; but if Mr. Roatſley ſhould be clever enough to gueſs it, you know neither of us can help that. Lord, look, look, cried ſhe with entire diſregard to Fanny's confuſion, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious Miſs Fanny appears of the ſecret: and Miſs Seymour, I declare ſhe bluſhes too, as much as to ſay—but I muſt take care not to blab.</p>
                  <p>Roatſley ſmiled at our mutual confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; for indeed I felt extremely for poor Fanny, and was not a little aſhamed alſo for Mrs. Hindon's indelicate raillery.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:1034200203:48"/>If my enquiries give the ladies ſo much pain, ſaid he, I am afraid I muſt be contented to remain in ignorance; tho' I confeſs my curioſity is raiſed to the higheſt pitch to diſcover this important ſecret.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Hindon juſt then entered; and an introduction taking place between him and Mr. Roatſley, I was in hopes Fanny would have been relieved from her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution. His lady, however, ſeemed determined ſuch an excellent joke ſhould not have ſo ſpeedy a termination.</p>
                  <p>My dear, cried ſhe, let us ſee if <hi>you</hi>
can ſolve this riddle, which has puzzled Mr. Roatſley's brain in vain to unravel, and the bare mention of which has plunged theſe ladies into the moſt painful confuſion. The ſecret, or rather the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, is contained in that package of brown paper that lies on the table.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall take a very ſimple method of diſcovery, returned he, and ſeizing the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1034200203:49"/>
parcel as Fanny was flying to ſecure it, he inſtantly cut the packthread with which it was tied, and holding it above her reach a number of favors compoſed of white and ſilver dropt on the ground.</p>
                  <p>The ſecret is diſcovered at length, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Mrs. Hindon, laughing with great vociferation. Well I'm ſure ladies you need not care much, for it is of a nature that will ſoon ſpeak for itſelf, and I'm ſure you muſt acknowledge I ſaid never a word of the matter.</p>
                  <p>It is then a matrimonial one I preſume, ſaid Mr. Roatſley, with a conſtrained air and in a very low voice to Mrs. Hindon.</p>
                  <p>Yes, returned ſhe, ſmiling expreſſively as if ſhe was not at liberty to ſatisfy him further, though ſhe evidently ſeemed impelled by a ſtrong inclination to enter upon family tranſactions, equally unſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and impertinent.</p>
                  <p>Poor Fanny returned to her ſeat much aſhamed and confuſed; while Mr. Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1034200203:50"/>
following, laughed moſt indelicately in her face; and as I appeared little leſs embarraſſed—Poor Miſs Seymour! cried he half ironically, tapping me familiarly on the back, Mr. Roatſley I am certain will agree with me that <hi>your</hi> complexion requires no foreign aid, ſo pray don't bluſh ſo very deep:—which piece of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice you may ſuppoſe was not much cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to enable me to profit from it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Roatſley finding his preſence ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther augmented the awkwardneſs of Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny's ſituation, ſuddenly wiſhed us good morning and departed abruptly.</p>
                  <p>This tranſaction was in itſelf trifling, had it not ſhewn the family with whom we reſide in a vulgar and abſurd point of view; and the affair of the parcel could have excited neither curioſity nor ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, had not Mrs. Hindon beſtowed an importance on it by her ill-judged rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery, ſufficient to convince Mr. Roatſley that ſomething "more was meant than
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1034200203:51"/>
met the ear." However, except in hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given poor Fanny ſome uneaſy mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it was of little conſequence, as ſhe has at length conſented that Friday ſhall unite her with Mr. Howard; and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after the ceremony, at which on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Miſs Parſons and this family are to be preſent, we ſet off for Hubert Hill; which being ſeventy five miles from town, we ſhall not reach till the ſecond evening.</p>
                  <p>But tell me, my Sophia, how ſhall I account for Roatſley's behaviour during our tete a tete this morning? To ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him entirely ignorant of an affair which muſt have naturally and unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably occaſioned ſome diſturbance, and no ſmall degree of diſcuſſion in his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, is to imagine what is not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable, but I own almoſt impoſſible. Have I not reaſon then to be diſpleaſed with the inflexible pride, (alas, it is a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily failing!) which his conduct too plainly indicates: ſtill perhaps retaining
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1034200203:52"/>
the embers of that trifling partiality he ſeemed once diſpoſed to feel for me, yet proudly aſhamed, or weakly afraid to venture on a ſtep his family unjuſtly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits, he ſeeks my company and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation under the pretended veil of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance. But under a pretence ſo ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, never ſhall he receive the ſhadow of my notice, never ſhall I countenance that perſon as my friend, who diſdains to acknowledge he is allied to me.</p>
                  <p>Yet, my dear, how impoſſible is it to ſee Mr. Roatſley and to retain diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure. In vain I call offended dignity and wounded pride to the aid of my indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He is abſent, and I blame him; but when preſent, to preſerve even a cold reſerve, proves the utmoſt exertion of my reſolution.</p>

               <p>HOW infinitely inſinuating is this proud couſin of our's. I become every hour more afraid of myſelf, yet every moment exhauſts my imagination with efforts to diſcover indulgent motives for a conduct which reaſon and feeling equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemn.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Hindon having aſked the favor of his company to her aſſembly laſt night, I was not ſurpriſed to ſee him en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for I confeſs I expected he would profit from her invitation, tho' at the time he had hinted ſomething of a prior engagement, which he ſaid in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1034200203:54"/>
would prevent him. But never was I ſo much ſtruck, ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded by his appearance. How in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conceivably ſuperior did he look to every one of his own ſex who was preſent.</p>
               <p>There is an air of dignity, I had almoſt ſaid of grandeur, in his figure, equally the reſult of the moſt elegant ſymmetry of form and the moſt lively penetration and intelligence of countenance, which to a ſuperficial obſerver might, I ſhould ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine, at firſt ſight wear the aſpect of <hi>hauteur,</hi> did not the amiable ſoftneſs of his addreſs entirely contradict that idea; and I make no doubt but this contraſt may augment the prepoſſeſſion which every one on the ſlighteſt acquaintance ſeems inclined to feel for him; for all muſt be delighted to perceive that perſon who appears, tho' merely from the grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſuperiority of his height, to look down on others, deſcend on converſing with them into the gentleſt and leaſt aſſuming equality.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="54" facs="tcp:1034200203:55"/>The apartments were filled with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany before he arrived; and being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by a group of young people at one end of the room, he did not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately diſtinguiſh me.</p>
               <p>Shall I confeſs that I felt impatient on finding myſelf unnoticed, and hurt at per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that Mrs. Hindon, on his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, detained him in converſation a conſiderable time. I found ſome conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, however, in obſerving that he ſeemed to give her his attention with conſtraint, and that he often caſt his eyes with anxiety around, as if but little intereſted in what he heard.</p>
               <p>During this interval Miſs Farnford and another young lady detained me in an inſipid chit chat, while both my eyes and mind wandered to another ſubject. Having ſoon diſcovered him however, he inſtantly engaged their admiration, and attracted their whole attention.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="55" facs="tcp:1034200203:56"/>Who's that, pray, Miſs Pierſon? ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Miſs Farnford.</p>
               <p>It is the handſome Mr. Roatſley. I'm ſure you muſt have heard of him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the other.</p>
               <p>He is abſolutely the handſomeſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I ever beheld. Pray is he a man of fortune?</p>
               <p>Lord, cried the friend, don't you know that he is brother to Lord Linroſe, and poſſeſſed of heaven knows how many thouſands a year. He is juſt returned from abroad, in conſequence of a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did inheritance left him by an uncle in Ireland; and all the world ſays that he is amazingly clever, accompliſhed and agreeable; indeed he has all the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it, for he is aſtoniſhingly hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>I ſhould ſuppoſe then he a'nt married, ſince he is ſo lately come home?</p>
               <p>No, but juſt on the verge of being ſo. The wedding cloaths and equipages are
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1034200203:57"/>
all beſpoke, and I'm told his marriage is to take place immediately.</p>
               <p>Oh! Sophia! don't you feel for me at this moment. My ſenſations were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable. I felt as if my blood was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed within my veins, and every pulſe had refuſed any longer to perform it's function. I had not courage ſufficient to aſk Miſs Pierſon what authority ſhe had for this unlook'd-for information; but my companions, unſuſpicious of my agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, went on with their converſation in a half whiſper, and Miſs Farnford's curioſity ſoon ſatisfied mine.</p>
               <p>But who pray is the happy woman? cried ſhe gayly.</p>
               <p>Lord Mortonbury's daughter, Lady Elizabeth Sedley. She is a piece of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection by all accounts. Nobody before was ever ſo accompliſhed. She has all ſorts of languages—muſic, painting, nay poetry too, at her finger's ends; then ſhe is reckoned a prodigious fine woman,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:1034200203:58"/>
and dances divinely. Beſides all this, ſhe has a vaſt fortune, being an only child; ſo that ſhe is eſteemed the firſt match almoſt in England; and they ſay that her father and Lord Belmont, Mr. Roatſley's grandfather, have all along deſigned them for each other, even from their infancy.</p>
               <p>Well, that's ſo odd in old people, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Miſs Farnford. I'm ſure if papa was to do ſo by me, I ſhould hate my huſband horridly, were he ever ſo hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome.</p>
               <p>That is far from being the caſe with Lady Elizabeth; for it ſeems ſhe is vaſtly in love with him, and indeed no wonder, for I ſuſpect in her ſituation you would not carry your love of contradiction quite ſo far.</p>
               <p>Miſs Pierſon's converſation was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly interrupted by Mr. Roatſley's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; who having juſt at this moment diſcovered me, came forward in the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:1034200203:59"/>
height of my perturbation, with a ſmile which was ſuddenly on regarding me converted into a look of apprehenſion and anxiety. The intelligence to which I had juſt been liſtening, could not fail to give me the moſt uneaſy emotions, and the mortification attending this ſecret confeſſion, wounded me no leſs. What? cried I to myſelf, have I been all this while weakly allowing an attachment to ſteal on my heart, which can neither be excuſed by reaſon nor principle? Why do I envy another that happineſs which I never had the ſlighteſt grounds for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving would ever prove mine? and why ſhould I feel myſelf ſo unaccountably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in the fate of a man, of whoſe pride and inflexibility, ſpite of his inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating exterior, I have ſuch glaring proofs?</p>
               <p>Theſe interrogations, tho' meant to rouſe me from my too ſuſceptible weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, had by no means the deſired effect;
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:1034200203:60"/>
and ſcarcely had Mr. Roatſley begun the uſual enquiries after my health, when he added—I am afraid, Miſs Seymour, your countenance replies too plainly to my queſtion. I am afraid you find your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf indiſpoſed. Perhaps the heat of the room affects you? W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ll you allow me the honour of conducting you to the other, where you will have more air, I imagine. Hardly able to reply, I al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him to lead me away tacitly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming his conjecture, partly from the effects of an unconquerable embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which ſeized me at that inſtant, and partly with the view of concealing my agitation from my two companions, of whoſe ſuſpicions I was apprehenſive.</p>
               <p>Miſs Farnford however, the inſtant ſhe ſaw me addreſſed by a young man of ſo elegant an appearance, contrived to pin herſelf to me for the reſt of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in hopes of improving this acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal meeting into an acquaintance; and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:1034200203:61"/>
made ſo many attempts to attract his no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and engage him in converſation, that I really bluſhed for the forward and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh coquetry of her behaviour; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly as from ſeeing her conſtantly by my ſide, or hanging on my arm, he muſt have concluded her one of my moſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate friends; and tho' he anſwered her with civility, and the moſt ſcrupulous good breeding, he ſeemed by no means charmed with her ſtile of manners.</p>
               <p>She was ſo much delighted with him however, that I was in continual pain leſt he ſhould overhear her expreſſions of admiration—a matter which gave her very little concern. Pray don't you think this Mr. Roatſley the fineſt young man you ever beheld in your life? ſaid ſhe at length, when he had turned for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſpeak with Mrs. Hindon.</p>
               <p>Yes, he is handſome, ſaid I, with an affected air of indifference. At leaſt I believe he is thought ſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="61" facs="tcp:1034200203:62"/>Thought ſo! repeated ſhe; Lord but don't you think ſo. I never ſaw any perſon have ſo much the look of a man of faſhion. But he is juſt going to be married.</p>
               <p>Is he, ſaid I, faintly.</p>
               <p>Yes indeed, and the lady is ſo in love with him as never any body was before. Indeed I don't wonder at that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in the leaſt. But pray don't you think it is too much to be Mr. Roatſley and the poſſeſſor of ſuch prodigious wealth at once? Don't you think ſo?</p>
               <p>Yes, perhaps;—oh no, not at all, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned I with an emotion to which only Miſs Farnford could have been blind; but eager to talk, ſhe perceived not my perplexity, or attributed it to my late indiſpoſition.</p>
               <p>But pray tell me, how did you become ſo well acquainted with him?</p>
               <p>We croſſed over in the ſame packet boat from Calais.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:1034200203:63"/>Did you indeed. I wiſh I had made one of the party. I dare ſay it muſt have been a very agreeable one.</p>
               <p>Yes, pleaſant enough, ſaid I, quite fatigued with giving attention to a train of queſtions ſo little intereſting, while my thoughts were entirely occupied with a ſubject that proved, alas! too much ſo.</p>
               <p>Mr. Roatſley again joining us, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented her proceeding; and Lady Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford's carriage being announced, Miſs was ſummoned ſoon after to attend her mother. Being then relieved from the frivolous interruption of our companion, wo entered into a converſation, the life and ſpirit of which were maintained ſolely by his own efforts; for though I exerted myſelf to the utmoſt, a weight unſpeakable oppreſſed my ſpirits, and wholly dampt the ſatisfaction this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would have otherwiſe afforded.</p>
               <p>Yet I own his behaviour puzzled and
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1034200203:64"/>
aſtoniſhed me. Had you witneſſed what paſſed during this evening, Sophia; had you beheld the unconſcious eaſe with which he converſed, you never could have ſuſpected that any deſire of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lay upon his mind. All ſeemed open, ſincere, and unreſerved. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently wiſhed me to confeſs many little circumſtances relating to our life abroad, and even preſumed to hint at enquiries reſpecting my father and our abode in Languedoc, tho' with a politeneſs quite diſtinct from impertinent inquiſitiveneſs, and with which, in a ſtranger, I might have been gratified, ſuppoſing them the reſult of intereſt in my concerns; but which in my couſin I could only ſuſpect to be the conſequence of an imperfect information that had excited his curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Theſe are concluſions, however, which did not till afterwards occur. At the time, I could think of nothing but the intelligence that had juſt been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1034200203:65"/>
to me, and the deſtruction of a thouſand airy dreams which had made the ſtrongeſt impreſſion in my boſom.</p>
               <p>Oh! my Sophia! however you may and muſt condemn, do not deſpiſe me for the weakneſs which every line of my journal diſplays. Good heavens! were any eyes but yours to ſee my writing! The very idea makes me tremble. But to unburthen my mind to you, by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing my inquietudes, is the only ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of my exiſtence. When I reflect how unreſerved, how perfectly free from concealment or reſtraint, are my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, I can ſcarce conceive how I poſſeſs reſolution to tranſmit them to writing. Indeed had not an early habit of confidence familiariſed me to the idea of laying open my heart upon paper, I ſhould never have found courage to riſk the hazards of ſo long a journey as they muſt take before they reach your hands.</p>
               <p>Mr. Roatſley declined joining any of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1034200203:66"/>
the card parties, tho' ſtrongly ſolicited by Mrs. Hindon; and Fanny being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged at the commerce table, he gave to me his whole attention. He enquired what were my engagements in public, and hoped to have the pleaſure of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me either at Ranelagh next evening, or at the Opera on Saturday: but I ſaid, that on my ſiſter's account I ſhould not have it in my power to viſit any public place till her affairs were finally ſettled; and that immediately after it, I ſhould accompany her to the country.</p>
               <p>What? ſaid he with ſome ſurpriſe, at this unpropitious ſeaſon do you think of leaving town? I hope, however, your ſtay will be ſhort? The country can have no attractions at preſent.</p>
               <p>I have no thoughts of returning again to town, anſwered I with a melancholy I could not wholly repreſs. A thouſand reaſons conſpire to make me wiſh myſelf ſettled in the country, tho' we were
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1034200203:67"/>
blocked up with ſnow and enjoyed not the ſociety of a ſingle individual out of our own little family circle for months to come.</p>
               <p>That is a very ſingular taſte at your time of life, ſaid he. That Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour ſhould incline to ſeclude herſelf in retirement is not merely cruel, but I had almoſt ſaid, unnatural. Shall I not even have the pleaſure of ſeeing you at the Opera before you go?</p>
               <p>I anſwered I was afraid not, as we were to ſet off on Friday. At this moment Mrs. Hindon approaching, requeſted that he would favour her with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to ſupper together with a ſmall party who had been ſelected.</p>
               <p>To this he inſtantly conſented. On ſeating ourſelves at table, tho' he made an attempt to get by me, I was placed at a conſiderable diſtance, as Mrs. Hindon, out of reſpect, aſked him to ſeat himſelf at the upper end, at her right hand, and
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1034200203:68"/>
entertained him in a very earneſt half-whiſper during the repaſt.</p>
               <p>Senſible of her imprudence, I was ſeized with apprehenſion leſt we and our ſituation were the topics on which ſhe had choſen to expatiate; which, from her extreme neglect of delicacy and entire diſregard to propriety, was not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and muſt have involved us in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt mortification. I was ſeriouſly mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable from the inſtant this ſuſpicion oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred; and began even to dread that ſhe had been ſoliciting his aid or plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our cauſe;—an idea that tormented me in the cruelleſt manner; for ſhe often glanced her eye on Fanny and on me, and led Mr. Roatſley to regard us in a ſimilar manner. I am now happily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved however from theſe fears; for when I afterwards ſounded her on the ſubject, ſhe did not betray by the ſlighteſt hint having acted ſo imprudently, nor
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1034200203:69"/>
could I gather from her diſcourſe any circumſtances to alarm me.</p>
               <p>After ſupper I was aſked to ſing. Mr. Roatſley is paſſionately fond of muſic, and confeſſed himſelf a performer on ſeveral inſtruments. This you may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve did not diminiſh my natural timi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity; but the intreaties of the company were ſo preſſing, and thoſe of Mr. and Mrs. Hindon ſo importunate, that I was conſtrained to comply, and acquitted myſelf indeed very ill.</p>
               <p>My ſpirits, low and oppreſſed, made the little ſong of "Ah! my charmante Louiſe" affect me almoſt to tears while I ſung. How many painful recollections did it bring to my mind, when my So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia and myſelf received our inſtructions together in that delightful accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>I ſlept very ill laſt night. Confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a variety of conjectures, I knew not which implicitly to credit. From one
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1034200203:70"/>
ſource of anxiety however I conſidered it was in my power to be relieved, and any certainty was preferable to my preſent ſuſpenſe: beſides, to matrimonial intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence entire belief is not always to be given; and as Roatſley obſerves, to what we dread we are moſt liable to give our confidence; I therefore reſolved to pay a morning viſit to Miſs Pierſon, to whom I have owed one a conſiderable time, but whoſe acquaintance indeed, till this acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I had not much inclination to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate. At preſent however ſhe is the only channel from whence I can draw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, and her ſociety is become in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting. I intended, with all the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent indifference I could aſſume, to renew the ſubject of her recent intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and endeavour to diſcover on what grounds ſhe had advanced the fact with ſuch apparent certainty. She was from home however when I called, and I am juſt returned not a little diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:1034200203:71"/>How unlucky it is that I muſt leave town while I remain in this painful un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty. Yet why do I call it ſo, when but for the deluſions of a too ſanguine mind I ſhould not harbour a doubt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the authenticity of Miſs Pierſon's intelligence. I have formed fifty little ſchemes to meet with her; but not being able to form a pretext for calling again myſelf, I intend to make Fanny go in my place to pick up what accounts ſhe can learn reſpecting this affair.</p>

                  <p>Miſs Pierſon has ſaved me the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of planning ſome little artifice to meet with her, by returning my viſit this very evening in an eaſy way, accompanied by Miſs Farnford.</p>
                  <p>My heart beat ſeverely at their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. How do circumſtances, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1034200203:72"/>
the moſt trivial, change the face of things. Two girls, whoſe acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance but a few days ago, from the frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous though harmleſs inſipidity of their converſation I ſhould rather have avoided than courted, were now become the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of my moſt anxious ſolicitude.</p>
                  <p>I was in hopes, from the eagerneſs with which they had before entered on the ſubject I now wiſhed ſo much to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce, that they might of themſelves lead to it; and one is but too apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude others in ſome meaſure influenced by circumſtances that convey intereſt and agitation to our own boſoms. Miſs Farn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and her friend were ſtruck with Roatſley's elegance, and the intelligence of a wedding, intereſting to all girls, had attracted their curioſity and attention; but after the conjecture relating to jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, ſettlements, finery, &amp;c. were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted, to which ſuch a topic generally gives birth, the idea in all probability
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:1034200203:73"/>
occurred to them no more. I was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obliged to touch on it myſelf in the manner I imagined leaſt liable to ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion. Fortunately the penetration of my companions was not to be dreaded, and ſtill more fortunately Mr. and Mrs. Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don were engaged abroad.</p>
                  <p>In the courſe of converſation I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned a catalogue of marriages as the news of the day; and tacked Mr. Roatſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's to the end of my liſt, tho' not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a glow on my cheek.</p>
                  <p>O don't you remember it was I who told you of that match, ſaid Miſs Pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the other night when we were here.</p>
                  <p>I will not vouch for the authenticity of half my intelligence, ſaid I; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps little more credit ought to be given to this laſt union than to many of the others.</p>
                  <p>Oh I aſk your pardon. I aſſure you Mr. Roatſley's marriage is an undoubted fact. But certainly you ought to know
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1034200203:74"/>
all about it better than any body, for I am told that he is your couſin; tho' I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I ought to requeſt your excuſe for mentioning it, as I believe you don't wiſh it to be made public.</p>
                  <p>I never heard of it till the other even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſaid I; and now that I recollect, you I believe was my authority.</p>
                  <p>And that I promiſe you is as good as poſſible: for Lady Mary Lawrence, who is aunt to Lady Elizabeth Sedley, and who has had the charge of her from her infancy, (Lady Mortonbury having died when her daughter was quite a child,) is extremely intimate with my mother, and has frequently mentioned to her this projected alliance, which ſhe is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly eager ſhould take place, as the young man is a very particular favorite with her, and ſhe deſigns I know to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent her niece with a very valuable ſet of jewels on the occaſion, and they are actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally beſpoke: tho' Lady Mary told my
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1034200203:75"/>
mother the affair was not to be concluded till Lord Belmont's return from abroad, (who has been the chief promoter of the match,) and his Lordſhip is not expected till autumn; therefore the marriage is not publicly talked of by the relations on either ſide, but all the world knows of it for all that.</p>
                  <p>My doom is then fixed, ſaid I to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. My authority is undoubted, and all deluſion at an end. Let me not ſink however with unpardonable weakneſs under the blow. Let me reſiſt this over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming regret with all my fortitude. Had it not been from the foible of a too ſuſceptible heart, all efforts had been on this account unneceſſary. Let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore atone to my own mind by the moſt rigorous exertions for the error I have committed, and let a name ſo fatal, ſo intereſting, be mentioned in my journal no more.</p>
                  <p>Theſe reflections, which in an inſtant
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1034200203:76"/>
paſſed through my mind, beſtowed a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary enthuſiaſm that enabled me to talk with a compoſure on the ſubject for which I applauded myſelf not a little.</p>
                  <p>I make no doubt but Lady Elizabeth will be extremely happy, ſaid I, for Mr. Roatſley really ſeems to be an agreeable man.</p>
                  <p>Oh! extremely clever and agreeable certainly, cried Miſs Farnford, (who had been examining ſome work with Fanny above ſtairs, but who juſt then returned,) and the handſomeſt creature I ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held. But I think if he is actually go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be married the lady has reaſon to be not a little jealous, for if ever I diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered a man to be in love in my life, Mr. Roatſley is deeply ſo with Miſs Seymour.</p>
                  <p>I bluſhed exceſſively, but attempted to laugh it off.</p>
                  <p>Nay you need not bluſh ſo violently, cried Miſs Pierſon, for Miſs Farnford
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1034200203:77"/>
did not accuſe <hi>you</hi> of being in love with <hi>him.</hi> I give you my word however I made the ſame obſervation. During ſupper his eyes were never from you; and when you ſung, (and really you ſung di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinely,) I never beheld a countenance ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs admiration and delight as his did. He ſeemed to feel every note.</p>
                  <p>My confuſion was inexpreſſible. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious guilt made me extremely appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive leſt it ſhould excite the notice and raillery of my two gay companions; and Fanny, inſtead of endeavouring to relieve me from my embarraſſment, had the roguery to plunge me ſtill deeper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to difficulties. If muſic be the food of love, cried ſhe, Mr. Roatſley was proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly dreaming of his intended during the ſong, and of courſe might be more feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly diſpoſed to reliſh its pathetic charms than if he had been in the ſame comfortable ſtate of indifference with the performer. This ſhe uttered with a moſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:1034200203:78"/>
malicious ſmile; but fortunately the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were in haſte to pay other viſits, and left us ſoon after.</p>

               <p>HERE we are, all ſafe and well; tho' we have had two diſmal days for travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and did not arrive at the end of our journey till late yeſterday evening, the roads being rendered almoſt impaſſable by a late very heavy fall of ſnow. We
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:1034200203:79"/>
found a comfortable, ſnug manſion, a delightful fire, and an elegant little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt ready to be placed on the table, all of which we enjoyed extremely, after having been frozen ſo many hours on the road.</p>
               <p>Dinner being over, Mr. Howard car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried us through the different apartments of this ruſtic dwelling, which are fitted up with infinite taſte though with a fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality adapted to its ſize and ſimplicity. None of the rooms are large, but chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the higheſt degree, and having been all newly painted, papered, &amp;c. poſſeſs an air not only of uncommon neat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but even of elegance, a property which in my opinion conſiſts in ſymme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try rather than in ſplendor.</p>
               <p>I know you will expect the particulars of the wedding: but neither romance nor incident is to be expected where ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen is united to forty. Fanny would allow of no forms, though Mrs. Hindon
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:1034200203:80"/>
wiſhed extremely to detain us a few days, to introduce a little merriment to ſeaſon, as ſhe ſaid, the ſolemnity of the affair. But Fanny was inexorable. She would not even conſent to make a bridal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; but was dreſt ſimply in a tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling dreſs, being on the wing for Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Hill.</p>

                     </gap>ith ſnow; yet it appeared beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful. The houſe is ſituated in the moſt romantic ſpot I ever beheld; fronting the ſouth weſt, on the gentle ſlope of a hill which riſes by a very gradual aſſent. A noble river, the banks of which are ſhaded with very fine old trees, runs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1034200203:81"/>
within ſight of the windows; and the eminence behind, on which there is a thriving plantation, gives the little manſion a very ſnug appearance. The garden is an excellent one, and well ſtored with common fruit trees of the beſt kinds, that amply compenſate for the want of thoſe luxurious ones to be obtained only through the expenſive aid of a hot houſe. The pleaſure ground, tho' of ſmall extent, is laid out with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable taſte, and the little incloſures kept in ſuch good order, that I think in ſummer Hubert Hill muſt be the moſt delightful ſpot in the world.</p>
                  <p>I am ſurprized Mr. Howard ſpoke ſo faintly in its praiſe. But no doubt he wiſhed to ſurprize us in favor of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſidence. It is on a very ſmall ſcale indeed, and partakes more of an ornamented farm than a country feat; but I think the worthy owner has reaſon to be not a little vain of the improvements
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:1034200203:82"/>
he has himſelf effected ſince it came into his poſſeſſion by the death of his father; an event that took place only a few years previous to his acquaintance with our family.</p>
                  <p>From the period of his ſucceſſion to Hubert Hill till that of his leaving Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, an amiable ſiſter, who died of a conſumption at the age of twenty-nine, preſided at the head of his table; and it is to her taſte and regularity that Fanny owes the comfortable and neat elegance of various conveniences not to be expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the houſe of a bachelor.</p>

                  <p>Nothing but continual rain or ſnow, and no poſſibility of ſtirring out of doors. We endeavour, however, to make our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the more comfortable within; Fanny, who makes all the buſtle of a
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:1034200203:83"/>
young miſtreſs of a family vain of the importance of her new charge, finds con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual amuſement and employment in directing all her little houſhold matters, for which ſhe really ſeems to poſſeſs a talent, tho' I ſometimes alledge that her orders are calculated rather to confuſe than adjuſt. Being diſpleaſed with the furniture of her drawing room, which is a little antique, we have ſet about a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious piece of work in order to fit it up with elegance. We have begun to work chairs and hangings in imitation of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural flowers; which, as there is ſcope given both for taſte and ingenuity, is an agreeable occupation. You know this ſort of work is a convent accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; by which means Fanny and I are adepts in it. I have likewiſe undertaken to cover the walls of the little chearful parlour with landſcapes, for which many delightful ſcenes even from its windows furniſh ample ſubject; ſo that we are
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1034200203:84"/>
provided with abundant employment for at leaſt a twelvemonth to come. Mr. Howard, who has a well choſen collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the works of the beſt authors, both French and Engliſh, generally reads to us while we ſit at work. The even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings we divide with a little muſic, and our favourite cheſs, ſo that they never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear too long, and our life on the whole glides along in a tenor ſo ſmooth, ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and placid, that I hope in a ſhort time to enjoy it with perfect reliſh. Even at preſent I am conſcious I could no where be more happy.</p>

                  <p>This evening I received a letter from Mrs. Hindon. Oh Sophia into what agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has it not thrown me. Read, my dear, what that officious woman writes.</p>

                     <body>
                        <pb n="84" facs="tcp:1034200203:85"/>
                        <head>TO MISS SEYMOUR.</head>
                        <p>I have been prevented from writing you ſooner, my dear Miſs Seymour, by a ſlight fever, which though by no means alarming, proved troubleſome for a few days, and was attended by a headach ſo ſevere that an application to my pen has been till this day wholly impracticable; although I have been for this week paſt extremely deſirous to inform you of a piece of good fortune, the merit of which I muſt take entirely to my ſelf. To give you a clear and diſtinct idea of the whole affair, I muſt begin by previously ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting you, that perceiving you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hered obſtinately to your reſolution of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting no further application to your family, a meaſure which I always freely confeſſed to you I could not but highly diſapprove of, I myſelf, out of mere friendſhip, determined upon a ſtep, the happy ſucceſs of which I am convinced
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:1034200203:86"/>
muſt for once induce you to applaud my management.</p>
                        <p>As Mr. Roatſley, from his viſits and polite civility, appeared to have taken no part in the family tranſactions, I ſeized an opportunity, the evening he did us the honour of ſupping with us, to hint at the difficulties and diſtreſſing embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſments in which doubtleſs you muſt have found yourſelves involved, had not the marriage of the one ſiſter offered an agreeable home for both: but what was my ſurprize on finding that he liſtened to me with all the pity and aſtoniſhment of a man who was wholly unconcerned in the affair; and when, emboldened by the compaſſion he teſtified, I ventured to tell him what a ſevere diſappointment Lord Belmont's cruel behaviour had proved, he declared he had never been informed of the application, nor could he believe it poſſible he ſaid that an affair ſo melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and intereſting ſhould have failed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:1034200203:87"/>
of ſucceſs with his Lordſhip, whoſe heart was open to every call of diſtreſs and to every ſentiment of humanity. Theſe were Mr. Roatſley's very words. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted to find my auditor ſo much more agreeably diſpoſed than I could have hoped for, you may believe I delayed not laying hold of this favourable moment to expatiate on the mortifying and ſevere reverſe of ſituation which but a very ſhort time ago had been all at once pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented before your eyes, by the cruel re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of his Lordſhip, whoſe favour was now become, through the impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of your late guardian, ſtill more eſſential. I repreſented, in terms the moſt pathetic and moving, the ſtate of diſtreſsful poverty and dependence, to which but ſo lately it ſeemed likely you muſt both have been reduced, had not the happy and fortunate event before mentioned in part offered a relief, and I failed not to hint, in a pretty explicit
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:1034200203:88"/>
manner, how uſeful and acceptable, nay how neceſſary ſome addition to your preſent finances muſt undoubtedly prove; more eſpecially as your future expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were they even realized to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of your hopes, would afford but a very ſcanty ſupport and be ſcarcely ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of beſtowing the mere neceſſaries of dreſs; while for thoſe of ſubſiſtence you was conſtrained to depend upon the limited income of your brother in law.</p>
                        <p>Never was man more affected than Mr. Roatſley at this recital, and he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed his ſympathy in the ſtrongeſt terms. We had not however either lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or opportunity for diſcuſſing matters fully. But he faithfully promiſed to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert his utmoſt activity and avail himſelf of Lord Belmont's intereſt towards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing to place you in a ſituation ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your birth and education. So eager was he in the cauſe, that he called two different times on the two ſucceeding
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:1034200203:89"/>
days, with the intention no doubt of making further enquiries and to conſult what could be done moſt ſpeedily and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually for your ſervice. I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luckily from home both times, but I think you told me you had ſeen him the day before you left town, tho' I perceived he had not choſen as yet to make his good intentions known to you; and on my part, as I doubted not but my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication would turn to good account, I had determined to be ſilent on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject till I could ſurprize you agreeably with the certainty of your good fortune. The morning after Mr. Roatſley again did me the honour of calling; but we were then all engaged at church on the grand affair. Having been ſo unſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, he addreſſed himſelf to me by letter the very evening after, and a very pretty letter it is, I give you my word, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me in the genteeleſt terms that his endeavours in behalf of my friend had
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:1034200203:90"/>
been ſo happily crowned with ſucceſs, that thro' the intereſt of a certain noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in power, who was the intimate friend of Lord Belmont, a penſion of two hundred per annum had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured for Miſs Seymour, while ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained unmarried.</p>
                        <p>But as I have reaſon to imagine, (ſays he, for I give you the very words of his letter,) that your amiable young friend labours under preſent difficulties, will you Madam venture to aſſiſt me in a pious fraud which will engage my warm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt gratitude and reſpect: your friendſhip and intimacy in all probability muſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford you a pretext for offering Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that aſſiſtance which it may be improper to appear as coming from me. In anſwer to this, I immediately wrote Mr. Roatſley that I agreed moſt willingly to his generous ſcheme, and the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing received a bill for two hundred pounds, encloſed in a letter as expreſſive
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:1034200203:91"/>
of gratitude and acknowledgments as if I had conferred on him the greateſt of all favors.</p>
                        <p>As a boon from ſo near a relation, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably intended as a diſcharge in full of all demands upon himſelf and his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I cannot ſuppoſe that even your delicacy, (over refined as I have ſome times thought it,) will object to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; neither can I prevail with myſelf to take the merit of a gift, the magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of which, when conſidered as mine, muſt undoubtedly have awakened your ſuſpicion. Mr. Roatſley made yet ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther attempt to viſit me ſoon after this tranſaction, but I was confined to my bed, and had it not in my power to ſee him.</p>
                        <p>Adieu, dear Miſs Seymour! Pray accept Mr. Hindon's beſt wiſhes and mine, and preſent the ſame to my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and his fair bride; and believe me</p>

Oh! Sophia! what were my emotions on reading this letter! No words can ſpeak my feelings. Though penetrated with the exertions of my amiable couſin in my favour, how ſeverely was I morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, how deeply wounded, to find my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the object of his compaſſion—of his generoſity—of his pecuniary aſſiſtance. Oh! how did all the pride of my heart riſe at the humiliating idea.</p>
                  <p>Why did Mrs. Hindon preſume to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere, without my knowledge or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in an affair for which ſhe poſſeſſes the requiſites neither of judgment nor delicacy. Proud as ſhe appears of her ſucceſs, I ſhall for ever regret the buſy officiouſneſs which dictated a ſtep ſo dreadful to me to think of. Yet I fear I am unjuſt. The poor woman had cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly no apparent aim but my advantage in this unlucky tranſaction, and perhaps prejudice alone induces me to ſuſpect it the mere effects of her intermedling diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:1034200203:93"/>
which derives its higheſt grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication from prying into the concerns of others, and is delighted to find occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for its reſtleſs and frivolous activity.</p>
                  <p>The letter, at the firſt reading, threw me into agonies. I perceived only the mortifying point of view in which Mrs. Hindon had repreſented me to Roatſley, and that reflection poiſoned and wholly embittered the ſatisfaction which the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his anxiety and intereſt might otherwiſe have excited. To paint in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours the moſt pitiable and moving, ſo as to raiſe his pity and ſympathy, the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation to which we might have been reduced?—good heavens! can ſhe ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine this a circumſtance from which I could derive ſatisfaction? Her repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation too was by no means juſt, and had not even the merit of truth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it: for tho' at preſent I am conſtrained to depend upon the limited income of my brother in law, Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:1034200203:94"/>
expects that a very few weeks will in all human probability ſee Mr. Benſeley's affairs adjuſted, and two thouſand pounds at leaſt retrieved, for his wife's ſhare and mine, out of the wreck of our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. From the intereſt of my patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſlender as it is, in this retired abode I am certain I ſhall have not only all my neceſſary wants ſupplied, but poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the ability of making ſuch little uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful preſents to my ſiſter, as ſhall ſecure to me my independency in my own eyes. But this is a notion which to Mrs. Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don muſt appear the mere fiction of a romantic brain. Born an heireſs, and accuſtomed to derive that vain impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance on which her heart is fixed from the poſſeſſion of wealth and an oſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious diſplay of grandeur, ſhe regards opulence as the firſt of human bleſſings and its deprivation as the harbinger of the moſt acute miſery.</p>
                  <p>Of the penſion I heard with unfeigned
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:1034200203:95"/>
regret. Shocked at the circumſtances which had given birth to the acquiſition, I felt it as a painful weight which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed my mind, and from which to be free I would have given the world had I poſſeſſed it. But having communicated the letter to Mr. Howard, he repreſented it to me in ajuſter point of view; tho' in reading it to himſelf I obſerved that he bluſhed indignant at the unfeeling hints with which the epiſtle is interſperſed.</p>
                  <p>I ought to conſider, he ſaid, that the obligation of ſoliciting this annuity was inferior to the claims, which in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation juſtice alone, independent of humanity, gave me upon my relations; and that as an acquittal of the great debt owing me from their kindneſs and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this ſalary had doubtleſs been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, which was evidently deſigned to extinguiſh all future expectations.</p>
                  <p>As Mr. Howard perceived however that I was vexed and aſhamed, and as
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1034200203:96"/>
yet undetermined how to act, delicacy made him forbear any other advice on the ſubject than merely that which I had at firſt ſolicited and which naturally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted from reading the letter; and as my happineſs and advantage were the ſole ideas that dictated his ſentiments, he thought theſe acquirements would not readily be the production of a meaſure which even in proſpect gave birth to ſuch uneaſineſs. He therefore concluded, with a feeling peculiar to his diſpoſition, it muſt be confeſſed that our good ſiſter's notions of affluence are not the moſt ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic in the world; therefore while ſhe thought ſhe poſſeſſed the power of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing you what ſhe herſelf eſteems the chief good in life, and which no doubt beſtows many valuable and rational gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications, ſhe ſcrupled not by what means the advantage was gained, tho' a little more delicacy exerted in the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action had probably given it a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1034200203:97"/>
aſpect to what it now wears. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe meant all for the beſt, tho' it cannot be denied that to talk to her of eaſe, comfort, and compleat indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence on forty or fifty pounds a year, is to preſent different ſhades of colour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore eyes whoſe organs have been from infancy impaired. Indeed the happy diſpoſition that gives exiſtence to ſuch ſentiments, is beyond, infinitely beyond the reach of adverſe fortune; and is in itſelf a bleſſing which no worldly acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions can confer.</p>
                  <p>By praiſe ſo delicate, Mr. Howard la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to convince me, that however I ſhould determine, his opinion ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low mine; and that if my reſolution was to give way to pique, and to reject this ſeeming compromiſe with my family, he on his part ſhould rather applaud than blame the ſpirit that induced me to refuſe a favor, which, however otherwiſe advantageous, overwhelmed me with
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1034200203:98"/>
mortification. Yet it was not difficult to diſcern, that he might be apt to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my rejection as an abſurdity to which falſe delicacy and offended pride alone gave riſe; and when on the other hand I coolly reflected that my finances were by no means aſcertained, that it was not quite impoſſible amidſt the chapter of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents from which they had already ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſeverely but that I might really one day become dependent on the worthy Mr. Howard and my ſiſter, a ſituation I could indeed but ill brook, I reſolved to conquer my reluctance and yield to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity; tho' my heart roſe againſt my judgment, and had I been alone I ſhould have indulged in tears, which indeed were not wholly reſtrained even in Mr. Howard's preſence, at ſight of the bill.</p>
                  <p>Oh! Sophia! what ſteps were to be taken here, in this moſt cruel of all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances? —To return it inſtantly without doubt. But how conceal from
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1034200203:99"/>
the generous donor that I was acquainted from whence it came. Since Mrs. Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don could not retain <hi>his</hi> ſecret, tho' ſo powerfully urged and intreated, how could I poſſibly flatter myſelf that ſhe would pay greater regard to mine. I had no path to purſue that had not been attempted by him without ſucceſs; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever on ſome plan I was obliged ſuddenly to determine. I therefore ſat down to my bureau without loſs of time to anſwer her letter.</p>
                  <p>I thanked her in terms warmer than were my feelings, tho' I fear my coldneſs will ſurprize her, for the intereſt and trouble ſhe has taken in this buſineſs; but re-encloſed the bill, which I beſought her to return to the right owner, informing him that even as her gift, I could not poſſibly prevail with myſelf to accept of it.</p>
                  <p>I have aſked the favor of Mr. Howard to thank Mr. Roatſley by letter in his
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1034200203:100"/>
ſiſter's name for the intereſt he has taken in her concerns. I think I can do no leſs. An obligation may wound a proud ſpirit, but the teſtimonial of a proper gratitude cannot hurt an ingenuous one.</p>
                  <p>There is one circumſtance, material and intereſting, in Mrs. Hindon's letter, on which I have not yet touched, but which I conjecture will not paſs unnoticed even by you, and as for me, it has em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed my thoughts day and night ever ſince it reached me: Roatſley, ſhe tells me, appears to have been kept hitherto in utter ignorance with regard to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky tranſactions with his mother, and to be wholly unacquainted with the rejected application to our grandfather. Though how particulars of ſuch importance in the family ſhould have been concealed from his knowledge it is impoſſible to conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. There is indeed a myſtery in this affair which Mr. Howard, Fanny, and myſelf, attempt in vain to unravel. Is
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1034200203:101"/>
it too fanciful to imagine that Lady Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, fearing the known generoſity of her amiable ſon's diſpoſition might lead him to act againſt the wiſhes of Lord Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, may have determined on keeping him wholly in ignorance. I am bewil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in a variety of imaginary opinions, and not a little ſecretly delighted at find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf enabled to exculpate him from thoſe charges of pride and duplicity, which in ſpite of a too inſinuating parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, have ſometimes painfully recurred to my mind.</p>
                  <p>Can it be, my Sophia! that Roatſley has been ſo long ignorant, and what is equally aſtoniſhing and unaccountable, has been informed from the lips of Mrs. Hindon only, that we are ſo nearly allied by the ties of blood? Yet what are theſe ties? how weak, how inſufficient alone either to produce friendſhip or to excite eſteem or admiration! The connection is indeed productive of ſatisfaction,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:1034200203:102"/>
merely from the idea that it is a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for intercourſe and a pretext for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacy. I think however, even in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon politeneſs, he ought to have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared leſs dejected than he did upon the diſcovery. His ſilence and embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment during our laſt interview evidently confeſs what little ſatisfaction he derived from the information.</p>
                  <p>I have been reading Mrs. Hindon's letter once more; and tho' ſhock'd at the indelicacy too viſibly expreſſed in almoſt every line, now that I am cool there are ſome paſſages in it which do not wholly diſpleaſe me. How feeling, how conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, how noble, has been Roatſley's conduct. His heart is indeed open to every call of diſtreſs, and to every ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of compaſſion. How amiable is his delicacy compared to that of his part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the generous tranſaction. It pains me not, nay I ſhould be gratified, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an obligation from my couſin, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:1034200203:103"/>
from the ſordid and humiliating conſideration of money matters. The anxiety and trouble therefore which were exerted on this occaſion, dilate my heart and animate my gratitude. I am alone hurt that the repreſentations of my offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious agent were dictated with ſo little judgment as to excite his pity, and ſo little refinement as to mortify my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. To this was owing the diſtreſſing and unſucceſsful attempt to wound me ſtill more ſeverely by pecuniary favours.</p>
                  <p>I have received a letter from Miſs Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who promiſed at parting ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to let me hear from her. She tells us that ſhe is now moſt agreeably ſettled in that line, for which ſhe regarded her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as beſt qualified to earn her own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent ſubſiſtence, and that ſhe is to quit Mrs. Hindon's in a few days, who has been much diſpleaſed with the ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of her conduct towards ſo kind a
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:1034200203:104"/>
relation: theſe are the good lady's own words.</p>
                  <p>The lady with whom ſhe was in terms, held her determination ſuſpended as I told you, on account of ſome point on which Miſs Parſons did not anſwer her wiſhes; but on that deſerving young woman's offering her ſervices in perſon, ſhe was ſo much pleaſed with her ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, as to wave all deficiencies, and cloſed immediately with her terms. Pray who do you imagine this lady has turned out to be? no other than Lady Linroſe herſelf: and Miſs Parſons at this moment actually makes one of her family.</p>

               <p>I Have been ill and unfit for writing for ſome days paſt; and tho' ſtill feeble and dejected, I haſten to that ſoothing relief which pouring our anxieties into the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom of friendſhip ever beſtows, even in the moſt ditreſsful ſituations.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howard, rambling over his grounds the other evening as it began to grow duſk, perceived on the high road at the foot of the hill, a carriage and four driving with great vehemence, as if deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of arriving at the end of its journey before night ſhould render travelling, in
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:1034200203:106"/>
the preſent ſtate of the weather, dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous as well as uncomfortable. A period however was but too ſoon put to their career, by a moſt alarming accident: the axle-tree all at once gave way, and the coach was ſuddenly overſet with a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence which made Mr. Howard, who was at no great diſtance, tremble for the lives of the unfortunate travellers.</p>
               <p>He flew inſtantly to their aſſiſtance; and found they conſiſted of a lady and her maid, attended by two footmen on horſeback, who were endeavouring to pull the unlucky Abigail out of the ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered equipage. This, with the aid of Mr. Howard, was, tho' with difficulty, effected: but they ſoon perceived that the ſituation of the girl was infinitely leſs deplorable than the condition in which they beheld the poor lady, who lay with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out motion at the bottom of the coach, her head and arm cut ſeverely by the
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:1034200203:107"/>
glaſſes, her face covered with blood, and apparently dead.</p>
               <p>Having lifted her out of the coach, Mr. Howard, aſſiſted by the maid, who forgot her own ſufferings in her terror for her lady, wiped the blood from her face, endeavoured to ſtop its effuſions with her handkerchief, plentifully be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſprinkled her with water, which a late fall of ſnow abundantly ſupplied on all ſides; and having adminiſtered the aid of eau de luce, ſal volatile, &amp;c. the poor lady, to their unſpeakable joy, at length opened her eyes.</p>
               <p>As ſoon as ſhe was ſufficiently reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, Mr. Howard informed her that his houſe was not above a quarter of a mile from the ſpot, and that every aſſiſtance could there be ſpeedily procured to alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate her own ſufferings and thoſe of her maid; and beſought her to allow him to help her into his own little carriage, for which he had diſpatched one of the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:1034200203:108"/>
at the moment of his coming up, and which was now arrived. This con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance was by no means ſuited to the preſent exigency, being a one horſe chair, the only equipage this family boaſts of. In this, aſſiſted by the attendants, Mr. Howard placed the unfortunate la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and ſlowly approached the houſe.</p>
               <p>I have brought you an unexpected gueſt, my dear, cried Mr. Howard, as he entered, ſupporting the feeble unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate; but would to heaven we had been introduced to the honour of her ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance in circumſtances leſs unhappy, for ſhe has met with a moſt alarming ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident and is ſeverely hurt.</p>
               <p>Fanny received her with that cordial kindneſs to which her ſituation ſo juſtly laid claim. The ſurgeon, who had been ſent for from the village adjoining, on examining her bruiſes declared that one of her arms was diſlocated, and that there was a fracture of one of the ſmall bones
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:1034200203:109"/>
near the wriſt. The unfortunate lady immediately underwent the neceſſary ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; but the groans which her agony excited rendered us incapable of remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near her.</p>
               <p>At length however her acute ſufferings were over. The operator departed, having enjoined the ſtricteſt attention to quiet and reſt, and my ſiſter and I were again admitted into her apartment to ſee every thing prepared by Thereſe, her own maid being unable to attend her. We then returned to the parlour, not a little eager to be made acquainted with the name of our lovely gueſt, a point in which we ſtill remained ignorant.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howard inſtantly gratified our curioſity; having learnt from the ſervants that their lady was the Counteſs of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brey, and that they were on their way to her country reſidence in the next county, when this unfortunate accident put a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod for the preſent to their journey. He
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:1034200203:110"/>
informed us likewiſe that he had ſent an expreſs to Sir William Meredith, (whoſe lady was Lady Aubrey's neareſt relation, and tenderly attached to her, and who would be miſerable, the girl ſaid, if ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from her lady at a juncture ſo cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical), acquainting him with this unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate event, and requeſting that he and Lady Meredith would take up their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence at Hubert Hill till all alarm re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Lady Aubrey was at an end.</p>
               <p>This accident you may ſuppoſe, by inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting our compaſſion ſo powerfully, had diſcompoſed us not a little, and wholly interrupted the ſocial tranquillity in which our evenings are uſually ſpent.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howard in particular was uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly grave, and teſtified an anxiety, which, had not the ſingular humanity of his diſpoſition been well known to me, might have created ſuſpicion. I am very apprehenſive, ſaid he, for the life of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Aubrey. Her delicacy of frame
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:1034200203:111"/>
ſeems but ill calculated for ſuſtaining an accident of this kind, and too much cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion cannot be purſued.</p>
               <p>The conſequence too powerfully juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his alarm: about three in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was ſuddenly awakened by Thereſe, who haſtily drew aſide my curtain. Ah! Mademoiſelle! ſaid ſhe, la pauvre dame eſt tres mal.</p>
               <p>She then informed me that her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had been exceſſively unquiet all the night, and ſo low ſpirited, that appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently worn out by reſtleſneſs and pain, ſhe at length burſt into tears; and telling Thereſe ſhe could not reſt, ordered her to bring a light into her chamber as ſhe found ſleeping impoſſible.</p>
               <p>The girl entreated her to ſwallow a few drops in ſome water, to which ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented; and giving over all thoughts of repoſe, ſhe had her curtains drawn aſide, and tried to beguile the tedious hours of midnight by entering into converſation
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:1034200203:112"/>
with Thereſe; who poſſeſſes all the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacity of her nation, and who, from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countering few of her equals to whom ſhe can talk, ſeizes with avidity every opportunity ſhe can lay hold of to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnify herſelf for the painful penance of ſilence, by making repriſals upon thoſe who underſtand her language.</p>
               <p>Her Ladyſhip, ſhe ſaid, had made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny enquiries about my ſiſter and me, to whoſe humanity and hoſpitality ſhe often repeated ſhe owed her life; and the girl was in hopes ſhe found herſelf ſomewhat eaſier, when ſhe was ſeized all at once with a fit ſo violent and alarming, that Thereſe was obliged to call up her own maid to her aſſiſtance; and tho' ſhe is now rather more compoſed, continued ſhe, I am afraid Madame's fever is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely high. She talks very incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently, mutters to herſelf in a manner truely frightful, and juſt now inſiſts on riſing and being dreſſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="tcp:1034200203:113"/>This information made me haſtily get up; and unwilling to diſturb my ſiſter, who of late has been rather indiſpoſed, I threw my wrapping gown over me, and ordering Mr. Rudder, the ſurgeon, to be inſtantly ſent for, I ſtole ſoftly into Lady Aubrey's apartment, and approaching the bed, where her maid was unwillingly aſſiſting her to riſe, I enquired how ſhe found herſelf; but oh! Sophia! how ſhall I find words by which to convey to you an idea of the ſenſations which over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered me? Is it in language to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh expreſſions adequate to thoſe feelings which overwhelmed my ſenſes, when the amiable, the unfortunate Lady Aubrey, with a frantic violence that eluded all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, ſuddenly ſpringing from the bed, threw herſelf at my feet, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing my knees, exclaimed in accents which froze my blood—oh! my Lord! my beloved Lord Linroſe! for the ſake of heaven do not frown upon me ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribly.
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:1034200203:114"/>
Your looks ſtab me to the ſoul! you terrify me my Lord!—oh! have mercy upon me!—I was dear to you once!—did you not ſay ſo?—and I have long, long forgiven you all you have made me endure.</p>
               <p>I heard no more, but fell ſenſeleſs on the ground.</p>
               <p>Thereſe and the woman, terrified at the unaccountable ſcene before them, flew to our aſſiſtance; and while the one ineffectually adminiſtered hartſhorn and other volatile reſtoratives to me, the other entreated her diſtracted lady to ſuffer herſelf to be again undreſt and to return to bed: and ſo quickly does inſanity change the object of its intereſt and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, that forgetting the idea which had but a moment before ſo violently agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted her boſom, ſhe allowed herſelf to be again put to bed, and yielding to weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, was for ſome time tolerably ſtill and compoſed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="114" facs="tcp:1034200203:115"/>Finding in the mean while that I ſhewed no ſymptoms of recovery, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſe in terror awakened my ſiſter, who flew half dreſſed into the room juſt as I had opened my eyes and began to recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect my ſituation.</p>
               <p>A ſeaſonable flood of tears in ſome meaſure relieved the anguiſh of my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and allayed Fanny's apprehenſions of a relapſe; and with her aſſiſtance, I ſummoned ſtrength ſufficient to quit Lady Aubrey's chamber, where the ſound of her voice repeating in the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy accents my father's name, and breathing her ſoft and heart breaking complaints at his cruelty and deteſtation, threw me into agonies unſpeakable.</p>
               <p>Fanny, who was yet unacquainted with the cauſe of my agitation, and who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been merely informed that Lady Aubrey was delirious, in her anxiety on my account had not attended to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coherencies that fell from her lips, ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:1034200203:116"/>
poured upon me, the moment we left it, a thouſand enquiries reſpecting the occaſion of the fit with which I had been ſeized. I was unable to ſatisfy her; and felt relieved by the entrance of Mr. Howard, whoſe countenance informed me that to him at leaſt the taſk of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing it was unneceſſary.</p>
               <p>For heavens ſake, my deareſt ſiſter, compoſe yourſelf, cried Mr. Howard. The pain of this affecting incident I might have prevented, had I dreaded or foreſeen an explanation ſo diſtreſſing and abrupt: but the apprehenſion of inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an unneceſſary wound deterred me from an information which I was well qualified to have given the inſtant Lady Aubrey's name reached my ears.</p>
               <p>What information? cried Fanny. You frighten me, tho' without knowing why. I perceive this lady is one of our rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: but why ſhould the knowledge of that circumſtance wound or diſtreſs us.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:1034200203:117"/>If you will promiſe me, my dear, not to be too much affected—</p>
               <p>For heavens ſake tell me to what all this preparation tends?</p>
               <p>I am juſt going to do ſo, ſaid he, tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her hand; and I hope you will not be alarmed when I deſire you to recall to mind an unfortunate lady, whoſe name frequently occurs in the packet once en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to my care—Miſs Marſdon.</p>
               <p>Good God! is it poſſible! Can Lady Aubrey be in fact that miſerable, that ill fated woman: and ſubdued by a crowd of melancholy ideas, Fanny melted into tears; but frightened to witneſs the ſtill ſuperior anguiſh of my feelings, ſhe for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got her own diſtreſs to ſoothe mine.</p>
               <p>Oh! my deareſt Hermione! cried ſhe, do not give way to this agitation. You will diſtract me. Conſider, my love, that time muſt have long ſince greatly allayed Lady Aubrey's ſufferings. Thoſe of our dear, dear father, are hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:1034200203:118"/>
lulled to perpetual reſt. He is now diſengaged from all the pains and ſorrows of the world, and this accidental rencon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre ought not too ſeverely to affect us.</p>
               <p>The apprehenſion of alarming her made me exert myſelf to aſſume a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure to which I could not ſo ſpeedily attain; but revolving in my mind all the circumſtances that had occurred ſince Lady Aubrey's arrival, it was not diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult for me to trace the cauſe of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy delirium with which ſhe had been ſeized, nor of that ſudden burſt of grief that ſo wholly overpowered her the inſtant I was preſented to her ſight; and which, tho' it ſeemed to us the natural conſequence of depreſſion and uneaſineſs, had undoubtedly its ſource in my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance to my father, which has been ever deemed ſtrikingly remarkable, and which muſt have overwhelmed her, even at the firſt moment, with ſome ſlight ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of my being in fact one of thoſe
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:1034200203:119"/>
daughters of whoſe exiſtence I can hardly imagine ſhe has remained wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant; and her converſation with the lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quacious Thereſe, a converſation poſſibly deſigned to aſcertain her doubts, pouring undeniable conviction on her mind at a moment of fatigue, pain, and indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, no wonder that ſuch a conflict of emotions co-operating with her late acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, ſhould have diſordered her imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>Upon interrogating Thereſe more mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutely, I find theſe conjectures ſtrongly corroborated. Tho' ſighs and tears, ſhe ſays, often burſt from the unfortunate invalid, her expreſſions were diſtinct, and to all appearance her reaſon clear, till after midnight; when calling Thereſe to the ſide of her bed, ſhe enquired into a thouſand particulars relating to her two ladies. Were they lately arrived from abroad? in what part of the continent did they uſually reſide? did they give
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:1034200203:120"/>
into the gaieties of M—, (within ſixty miles of which place Thereſe had told her we lived,) or did we prefer the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirement of the country? on all of which Thereſe was ſufficiently communicative.</p>
               <p>Late in the evening Lady Meredith ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. All this day Lady Aubrey con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the moſt dangerous way. Her fever ſeemed rather on the encreaſe, tho' already ſo violent that ſhe had not had one interval of returning recollection, but raved with unceaſing and dreadful incoherency ſince the moment of my ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den appearance.</p>
               <p>During this time you may eaſily judge what were my ſenſations. The weight on my ſpirits was indeed inſupportable. Regarding Lady Aubrey in the light of a woman for whom my beloved parent had ſuffered ſo much—the woman who loved and had endured ſo much for him—my heart became attached to her by a ſtrong and irreſiſtible impulſe of affection, and
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1034200203:121"/>
I could not but feel deeply intereſted in a life which was once ſo dear to him. Anxiety, and a reſpect almoſt filial, ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged me to watch with eager ſedulity the turn of her fever, and to adminiſter with my own hands the preſcriptions ordered by the phyſicians who were called in to her aſſiſtance: but wholly overcome by the incoherent ravings of her delirium, no ſooner was I ſeated by her bed ſide than my feelings rendered me incapable of remaining in ſilence and compoſure, and I was obliged to fly to another apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the relief of weeping aloud and at liberty.</p>
               <p>My ſiſter and Mr. Howard intreated me to ſpare myſelf the anguiſh of a ſcene ſo dreadful; but when it became inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, I made my eſcape, and while I preſerved fortitude ſufficient for the taſk, I felt a ſecret idea of duty which recompenced me for the pain of my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="tcp:1034200203:122"/>Sir William Meredith was prevented from accompanying his lady by a fit of the gout. Her terrors on account of her niece were indeed extreme. She wept violently on alighting, and poſſeſſed hardly reſolution ſufficient for liſtening to the particulars of her accident.</p>
               <p>The countenance of the phyſician feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly told how much was to be dreaded, All I can in conſcience tell you, Madam, ſaid Doctor Harding to Lady Meredith, is, that you will not remain long in the miſery of ſuſpenſe. One way or other it muſt ſoon be decided.</p>
               <p>This day, alas! has produced no ſymptom in the leaſt favorable. Lady Aubrey continues to endure all the reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs turbulence of delirium, is in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual motion, ſhifts an uneaſy poſture perpetually without finding one that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows more relief, and is ſometimes obliged to be detained by force from leaving her bed. She talks inceſſantly; and tho' her
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:1034200203:123"/>
diſcourſe is incoherent, it is uniformly pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic, melancholy, and intereſting. She not only recurs often to my father's name, but if I miſtake not, even Mr. Benſeley's ſome hours ago eſcaped her. The friendly part he acted in thoſe diſmal ſcenes which lie ſo heavy on her diſordered mind, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders this a natural tranſition of ideas.</p>

                  <p>After a tedious ſuſpenſe of ten days, Lady Aubrey's fever, thank Heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to give way to medicine.

                  <p>This interval has been a period of real anguiſh to me. All the horrors of my father's ſufferings and misfortunes, this wonderful and unexpected incident has renewed in my mind with augmented poignancy; and that gloomy impreſſion which the ſoothing hand of time, the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit of frequent reflexion, and the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of his tranſition, I truſt, to a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier world, had in ſome meaſure effaced, this accidental meeting has reſtored with redoubled violence, attended if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with encreaſed depreſſion.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Howard and Fanny having inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on my relinquiſhing an attendance which the preſence of Lady Meredith rendered unneceſſary, and which, igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the ſecret and ſingular the that binds my heart to that of the unfortunate Lady Aubrey might be deemed officious by her aunt, I have ſtrictly forborn ever

ſince her arrival to enter the apartment; and ſo powerfully has my ſenſibility ſtrengthened by this forbearance, that had my aſſiſtance been required I ſcarce think I could have ſummoned reſolution ſufficient for encountering the hazard of again hearing my father's name pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced in the heart rending accents of the mournful invalid. Even now, that her reaſon and recollection, through the mercy of Heaven, are reſtored, I look forward with inexpreſſible apprehenſion to the idea of once more meeting her eyes. The pang this interview muſt occaſion to her boſom, the pain with which it muſt overwhelm mine even in anticipation, agitates me beyond expreſſion.</p>

to hazard any riſk of being diſordered or diſturbed in her preſent feeble condition; finding herſelf now, however, much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited both in ſtrength and ſpirits, ſhe hoped in a day or two to be well enough to aſk the favour of a viſit from us in her dreſſing room, and in the mean while recommended herſelf, with many kind and polite expreſſions, to our good wiſhes.</p>

                  <p>This formidable interview is at laſt over. Oh! Sophia! I did not imagine it more formidable than it proved.</p>
                  <p>This morning Lady Meredith came down to the parlour, for ſhe ſeldom gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies us with her company till dinner, and requeſted, in Lady Aubrey's name, the favour of my ſiſter's company and mine above ſtairs. My heart beat vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:1034200203:130"/>
at this meſſage. I felt myſelf change colour; and involuntarily ſat down on the firſt chair ſo evidently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed, that Lady Meredith concluded I was ill, and ſaid with much kindneſs, 'tis fortunate, my dear Miſs Seymour, that I would not be prevailed with to accept of your moſt obliging offer of ſharing my fatigue and attendance upon my niece, for I ſhould have undoubtedly ſuſpected that you had ſuffered for your humanity.

                  <p>I aſſured her I was perfectly well; but ſhe would not give immediate credit to my aſſertion, and entreated my ſiſter to prevail with me to allow of the phyſician's attendance. Finding however that we

both made light of the propoſal, ſhe left us to prepare her niece for our appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, who was ſo feeble and exhauſted, that a trifle ſhe ſaid diſcompoſed her ſpirits, and threw her into a tremor.</p>
                  <p>Alas! Sophia, this interview, though a circumſtance of no moment in the eyes of Lady Meredith, was by no means a trifle to the unfortunate Lady Aubrey; and ſo wholly did the proſpect of it over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power her feelings, that her aunt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to us in a few minutes with an apology and requeſt that we would be ſo kind as to defer our viſit till the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as ſhe found herſelf languid and oppreſſed, and meant to lie down for an hour or two.</p>
                  <p>I felt relieved by this ſhort reſpite; and in the mean while endeavoured to prepare myſelf for the approaching pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod with a compoſure that might wholly confute any ſuſpicions ſhe might enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of my being conſcious of the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:1034200203:132"/>
and melancholy events that form a connexion ſo ſingular between us. As for my ſiſter, her emotions, naturally leſs uncontroulable, at leaſt after the firſt moments of agitation, I was under no apprehenſion that ſhe would betray herſelf; and by preſerving if poſſible an air of ſerenity myſelf, I hoped to render this meeting leſs affecting to Lady Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brey, who by that means would be ſpared the painful reflections which our mutual perturbation might otherwiſe occaſion.</p>
                  <p>In the evening, Lady Meredith re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again into the parlour. I am come once more, ſaid ſhe, to aſk the favour of your company in Lady Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brey's dreſſing room. She is by no means well to-day; and I am ſo apprehenſive of a relapſe, that I would have perſuaded her to defer your viſit till to-morrow, and go to reſt early; but her heart is ſo bent upon the pleaſure of ſeeing you, that I fear oppoſition would prove more
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:1034200203:133"/>
hurtful than the flutter of ſpirits which the ſight of a new face in the preſent weak ſtate of her nerves may occaſion. I however ſhall remain below, and enjoy a tete a tete with Mr. Howard, that we may not prove too many at once for her.</p>
                  <p>We accordingly went up ſtairs. The dreſſing room windows had been dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with blinds, under pretence that the light was offenſive, but doubtleſs with the intention of concealing an emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for which the inadequate allegation of debilitude and recent indiſpoſition only could be given. Lovely even in ſickneſs, ſhe reclined on a ſopha; from which, the moment we appeared, ſhe made a feeble attempt to riſe; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf incapable of effecting it, ſhe fell back in evident diſcompoſure, and holding out a hand to each, burſt into tears.</p>
                  <p>All my reſolution forſook me at that moment. Beholding her the victim of
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:1034200203:134"/>
thoſe calamities which had wholly embit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the declining days of my father— calamities which ſhe ſtill lived to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plore, and evidently felt at that inſtant with all the agony of recent and bitter diſappointment, my heart melted with ſympathetic ſorrow, and forgetting the compoſure I had laboured to obtain, I preſſed her offered hand to my lips with an enthuſiaſtic fervour which told as plainly as words could have done that I partook in the griefs that oppreſſed her diſconſolate boſom. This language was indeed too expreſſive not to be inſtantly comprehended, for raiſing herſelf by a ſudden effort, ſhe claſped me in her arms, and ſupporting her head on my ſhoulder, ſobbed aloud..</p>
                  <p>Terrified at the violence of her emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, I would have broke from her to have called Lady Meredith; but redou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling her careſſes, do not leave me, cried ſhe the moment ſhe could articulate—
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:1034200203:135"/>
tears are habitual to me, and thoſe I ſhed at this moment are produced by ſenſations which have not often, alas! found entrance into my heart. Let not this agitation frighten you, added ſhe. It's vehemence will in time abate. The Almighty, I truſt, ſends you to me for my conſolation and ſupport. She was unable to proceed; but diſengaging her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from my embraces, ſhe ſtretched out her arms to Fanny, who flew into them drowned in tears.</p>
                  <p>For heavens ſake, deareſt Madam, cried ſhe, for I was unable to ſpeak, endeavour to compoſe yourſelf; for your own ſake and for ours try to be calm. Many, many days of happineſs are yet I hope in ſtore for us all. Your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and affection is alone able to conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute our felicity; and it will be the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light of our lives if you will honour us ſo far as to flatter us with the hopes of being enabled, from the ſolicitude of the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:1034200203:136"/>
tendereſt regard and moſt filial affection, in ſome ſlight degree to contribute to your's.</p>
                  <p>Alarmed for the conſequences of this ſcene, and afraid leſt the frankneſs of Fanny's diſpoſition ſhould lead her in the height of her emotions to touch on par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars much too delicate for the preſent moment, I ran to the door to call Lady Meredith, whoſe preſence I imagined would put a period to a converſation that was about to become much too intereſting to all parties, and which in the precarious ſtate of Lady Aubrey's health might prove exceedingly hurtful to a frame ſo infinitely delicate; but perceiving my intention, ſhe entreated me to ſit down by her, and having ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſome drops in water, ſhe became ſomewhat more compoſed.</p>
                  <p>I truſt in heaven, ſaid ſhe, again tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my hand and obliging Fanny to ſeat herſelf upon the ſopha, that there are
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:1034200203:137"/>
days of returning peace yet in ſtore for me, ſince the Almighty has been pleaſed in his gracious providence to vouchſafe me, by means ſo unexpected and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, the gratification of that eager wiſh, in which has been centered all my hopes and expectations of ſatisfaction on this ſide the grave; for know, my ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able young friends, continued ſhe in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents interrupted by tears, that you have been ever ſince—(her voice failed her,) ever ſince my return to England, the ſubject of my thoughts—of my very dreams—and the unceaſing ſource of my anxious but ineffectual purſuit. Poor Mr. Benſeley! He was the firm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alterable friend of both. His ſteady and inflexible attachment no circumſtances could change, no reverſes could ſhake, while he remained convinced, continued ſhe claſping her hands together with an energy the moſt affecting, that there ſtill lay concealed within the ſecret receſs of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:1034200203:138"/>
the heart, a hidden and obſcured, yet fervent ſentiment of virtue, which called for the ſoothing hand of friendſhip to guard it from diſtraction and deſpair.</p>
                  <p>You will not wonder, Sophia, that the concluſion of this ſpeech, by over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming me with the complicated ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of aſtoniſhment, admiration, ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and delight, ſhould wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power my feelings. Utterance was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied me: yet words, had I been able to command them, could have but feebly expreſſed the tumult of contending emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that agitated my boſom. Throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing myſelf on my knees before the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Lady Aubrey, I diſſolved into tears; and while I kiſſed her hand and preſſed it to my heart, my looks and my diſtreſs told her how much I venerated and admired her. Oh, Sophia! had you beheld the lovely unfortunate at that moment, you muſt have adored her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="138" facs="tcp:1034200203:139"/>She embraced me with the tendereſt emotion; and I then reiterated my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties that ſhe would allow us to leave her. But while ſhe detained me feebly by the hand, ſhe requeſted Fanny to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the blinds, which now almoſt wholly obſcured the declining rays of the evening, and fixing her eyes ſtea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily for an inſtant on my face, tears again began to flow, and ſighing with an expreſſion the moſt mournful, ſhe bade us good night. You may conclude that my ſiſter and I could not ſpeedily recover the appearance of compoſure. Yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting as this interview had proved, a mixture of ſomewhat ſoothing and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolatory has inſinuated itſelf amidſt the bitterneſs of more poignant ſenſations. By a wonderful interpoſition of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, we had been introduced to the knowledge of one of the moſt amiable of her ſex, who not only felt inclined to accord us her friendſhip and affection,
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:1034200203:140"/>
but who was already our friend, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with fervor the warm attachment our hearts had imbibed almoſt the firſt moment that ſhe was preſented to our view, and the bitter recollection of whoſe paſt calamities our aſſiduous attention might prove the fortunate means of ſoothing into tranquillity. Theſe reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were of the moſt pleaſing nature, and grateful to our hearts; yet were they but ill calculated for wiping the tears from our eyes: on the contrary, by melting every ſenſation into tenderneſs we were almoſt exhauſted with weeping, when Mr. Howard came to ſeek us in my dreſſing room, where we had taken refuge in hopes of acquiring that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure which our tete a tete had ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed ſtill further than ever from our minds.</p>
                  <p>He kiſſed a hand of each, and telling us that ſupper waited, and that Lady Meredith was already in the parlour, we
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:1034200203:141"/>
tried to aſſumed ſmiling faces, and defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring any account of our affecting inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view till a more convenient opportunity, accompanied him down ſtairs.</p>
                  <p>On our entrance, and during ſupper, Lady Meredith's countenance betrayed an expreſſion of grave reſerve ſo different from the frank and open familiarity of manner which ſince the relief of her anxiety had ſeemed the characteriſtic of her mind, that I inſtantly perceived ſhe had been but recently informed of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, which probably the agitation of Lady Aubrey's ſpirits had diſcovered to her only an hour or two before. Painful as it was both to witneſs this change and to ſuſpect the cauſe, I made large allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances for the prejudice which induced her to regard us with repugnance. That Lady Meredith ſhould behold with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt, the offspring of him whoſe name in all probability ſhe merely knew as the ſource of miſery to her beloved niece,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:1034200203:142"/>
and with whoſe ſubſequent agonies of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe ſhe may be wholly ignorant, is not ſurpriſing, when ſuch conſiderations have had power to outweigh in the ſcale of paternal affection every motive of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, compaſſion, and even duty. Yes, Sophia, even duty: for rigid as Lord Belmont's ſenſe of integrity is reported to be, in regard to us, a miſtaken notion of honour ſways his conduct. It is for minds like the angelic Lady Aubrey's only to prove ſuperior to ſuch ſentiments, to wave perſonal injuries, to diſcard pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate reſentment, and to forget her own feelings and ſufferings in her pity and affection for the penitent author of her calamities.</p>
                  <p>As Mr. Howard during ſupper had converſed on indifferent ſubjects, and Lady Meredith with an air of unuſual ceremony ſeemed determined to follow his lead, the mortifying coldneſs of her manner deterred me from finding cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:1034200203:143"/>
to aſk how Lady Aubrey found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and indeed I dreaded truſting my voice with the enquiry. However when the ſervants had retired, Mr. Howard ſaved me the trouble.</p>
                  <p>My niece tells me ſhe is no worſe, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered ſhe coldly; but ſhe is extremely low ſpirited; and the ſlighteſt agitation in her preſent weak condition may be fatal to a frame ſo exhauſted as her's. I own I am under great uneaſineſs about her: the apprehenſion of a relapſe terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies me.</p>
                  <p>A relapſe! cried I in a tone which betrayed my emotion, heaven forbid! or we ſhall never forgive ourſelves; and leaning my head upon my hand, I found myſelf unable longer to preſerve the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the tranquillity I had endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to aſſume.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Howard made me ſwallow a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond glaſs of Madeira; and Lady Mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith ſeemed ſo affected with my tears,
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:1034200203:144"/>
that preſſing my hand with even more than her accuſtomed kindneſs, all cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, prejudice, and reſerve, ſeemed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to give way to the kindeſt ſym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy and moſt ſoothing compaſſion. Compoſe yourſelf, my dear Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, cried ſhe; my apprehenſions have been always accuſed of greatly magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every impending danger. It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion only, thank God, that leads me to ſpeak in a tone of ſuch deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency. Lady Aubrey aſſures me, that far from being hurt by the late inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view, it has ſoothed and gratified her heart; and even had the violence of her feelings, naturally acute, exhauſted her a little for the preſent, from the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſenſibility of your ſympathetic hearts, I foreſee in future infinite ſatisfaction and conſolation to my unfortunate niece in the unexpected happineſs of your friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſociety.</p>
                  <p>The ſubject was too delicate to admit
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:1034200203:145"/>
of more, and ſoon after we ſeparated for the night.</p>
                  <p>This morning, when we met at break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, Lady Meredith paid us her compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with much kindneſs, and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of revived ſpirits. Her niece, ſhe ſaid, her beloved niece, (for ſhe ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom mentions her without ſome epithet expreſſive of affection) had enjoyed an excellent night's reſt, and found herſelf much refreſhed, ſo I hope in God, Miſs Seymour, all our fears were wholly ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
                  <p>On her Ladyſhip's leaving us imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately after breakfaſt, Mr. Howard in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed us that he had had a long walk with her in the morning, for ſhe is an early riſer, and that it had been produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a very intereſting converſation; in the courſe of which he had picked up ſome particulars relative to Lady Aubrey that he was certain we muſt be eager to learn.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="145" facs="tcp:1034200203:146"/>Lady Meredith, he ſaid, had entirely contradicted the report, ſo univerſally cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated and ſo generally credited, of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Aubrey's inſanity. A fever of the moſt alarming nature had indeed attacked her brain, and held her life for many weeks ſuſpended; but this was the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſequence of her misfortunes. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning reaſon had been the immediate follower of recruited health: and tho' the moſt mournful depreſſion had wholly baniſhed tranquillity and peace from her boſom, religion the moſt devout, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignation the moſt humble and ſincere, had ſupported her in the height of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and had preſerved her from the baneful effects of diſtraction and deſpair.</p>
                  <p>When her ill fated marriage took place, ſhe had been but a few weeks in England. She had ſpent her life abroad, where Lord Embdon had acted at the Court of Turin in a public capacity. She had hitherto enjoyed little perſonal inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:1034200203:147"/>
with her numerous relations, and was particularly attached to none of them. Her native country, endeared to her neither by the force of private friendſhip nor by the inſinuating remembrance of early prepoſſeſſion, it was the inevitable and natural effects of her misfortunes to be diſguſted with it, and her departure was a ſtep which delicacy, pride, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, all conſpired to dictate.</p>
                  <p>The death of Lord Embdon, which happened at this juncture, (a ſtroke which it is to be hoped his weakly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution rather than his child's calamities had inflicted,) involved the unfortunate daughter in accumulated diſtreſs. Thank heaven he died of a complaint wherein the ſpirits are not ſuppoſed by medical people to influence the diſorder. He had been for many years afflicted with the ſtone; and refuſing to ſubmit to an ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, fell a ſacrifice to that painful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="147" facs="tcp:1034200203:148"/>This event, while it diſſolved her only remaining tie to England, left her wholly at liberty to purſue her intended ſcheme of future ſecluſion. Her grandfather, the old Earl of Aubrey, indeed ſtill ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, and beheld the ruined peace of his family with the weeping eye of a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. He entreated his grand daughter, the heireſs of his poſſeſſions, not to deſert him in his old age; but as ſhe well knew that an hereditary regard for the ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of his name and titles alone dictated this requeſt, and that wholly governed by a woman who had lived with him for years, his heart but feebly retained the impreſſions of natural affection, her ſenſe of duty did not interfere with the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of her intentions.</p>
                  <p>She therefore bade adieu to England; and having for a ſhort time boarded her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and attendants in the quiet retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a monaſtry, ſhe from thence en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after an obſcure but elegant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:1034200203:149"/>
which an early and tender friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for it's deceaſed poſſeſſor had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared to her remembrance; and having purchaſed it from the preſent owner, ſhe retired thither with the deſign of ſeclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf for ever from the world.</p>
                  <p>When this reſolution was formed, Miſs Marſdon was but eighteen, and poſſeſſed in the full glow of radience thoſe charms which dejection, diſappointment, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition, for fifteen years more, have ſcarce been able to impair. Her days, bounded by diſtreſs, the dreary proſpect admitted no ray of reviving conſolation except what reſulted from the ſocety of one dear and maternal friend, who hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been lately deprived of the huſband of her heart, and never having been bleſſed with offspring, flew to indulge with her favorite young friend the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded luxury of ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Madame de St. Hillaire, for ſome time combated not the intended ſecluſion
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:1034200203:150"/>
of her amiable friend. But the violence of her own diſtreſs yielding to reſignation and compoſure, ſhe became conſcious that tho' grief is ſeldom abated by reaſoning the moſt convincing and judicious, time will infallibly leſſen, and variety in ſome meaſure divert, it's bitterneſs. Her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, tho' poignant, were ſoothing and enthuſiaſtic: tears unceaſingly fell from her eyes; but they were tears of relief. Some pleaſing recollection, ſome ſcene, intereſting and endearing, often made them flow, and the luxuriant reveries of paſt delight in a great meaſure ſoothed the preſent ſad reverſe.</p>
                  <p>Far otherwiſe was the ſource of the bitter anguiſh of her friend. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of paſt affection carried a ſting which made her in horror fly from the thought; and the idea that the man ſhe had loved and had loſt was torn from her arms by the common ſtroke of death, ſupported not her feeling mind in the
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:1034200203:151"/>
height of languor and depreſſion: all was miſery unmitigated: the paſt was hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, and the future preſented only unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved mortification and perpetual regret.</p>
                  <p>In ſolitude and obſcurity were centered the only ideas of dejected tranquillity that could find entrance into the boſom of the fair mourner: a boſom of acute ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, chilled by the cold hand of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment: but her anxious friend, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on her youth and amiable diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, hoped that after time had been given for meliorating her ſorrows into peaceful reſignation, a temper ſo calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the active duties of benevolence would not remain unſubdued by the heartfelt gratifications which that noble principle affords, and foreſaw that it would not prove impoſſible to prevail with her to relax in her preſent ſyſtem.</p>
                  <p>Time juſtified the predictions of this valuable friend. By degrees, at her earneſt entreaties, a ſelect acquaintance
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:1034200203:152"/>
was admitted; and altho' through the whole of Lady Aubrey's reſidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, till the preſent moment, a weight of melancholy impaired her health and clouded her ſpirits, religion and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple co-operating with the continual ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Madame de St. Hillaire, greatly ſoftened the firſt anguiſh of her ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and while ſhe remained incapable of participating in the gaieties of life, its rational comforts were reſtored to her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh. Her ſociety, tho' limited, was ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and judiciouſly choſen; and her ſolitary reſidence at length began to wear the aſpect of a peaceful retirement, which the ſad ſtroke of Madame de St. Hil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laire's death, added to the dying requeſt of her grandfather, would probably alone have prevailed with Lady Aubrey ever to have quitted.</p>
                  <p>Lord Aubrey, ſinding the infirmities of age overtake him with a haſty pace, the beginning of this year ſent an earneſt
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:1034200203:153"/>
intreaty to his grand daughter to grant him the ſatisfaction of beholding once more the laſt and only ſupporter of his family and dignities. She heſitated not to obey, however painfully her return to England muſt awaken every ſource of anguiſh, and arrived in London about the end of January, juſt in time to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his laſt injunctions, the old Lord having ſurvived this affecting meeting only a few days.</p>
                  <p>Lady Aubrey now found herſelf poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of the accumulated wealth of a long line of noble and opulent anceſtry. Independent of thoſe eſtates which from entail were annexed to the title, her grandfather had left her conſiderable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; and he requeſted that a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to an ancient and honourable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, of which ſhe was the head and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament, might prevail with her to ſpend her days in the old family caſtle; where her predeceſſors had lived time immemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:1034200203:154"/>
adored by their vaſſals, reſpected by their friends, and the pride and bleſſing of the country around.</p>
                  <p>In addition to theſe particulars, Lady Meredith mentioned to Mr. Howard, that though from ſeveral circumſtances which on recollection ſtrike her remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, ſhe conjectures her amiable niece wiſhed her to be made acquainted with the ſingular event of her rencontre with this famiy, never could ſhe ſummon cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and calmneſs ſufficient for entering on the painful ſubject till yeſterday evening, when the violence of her emotions ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering her aunt at once ſuſpicious and inquiſitive, drew the formidable ſecret from her boſom.</p>
                  <p>Tho' tenderly attached to my niece, ſaid Lady Meredith, the only ſurviving child of a deceaſed ſiſter whom I almoſt idolized, I have not had the happineſs, till her late return from abroad, of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying much of her company. She has
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:1034200203:155"/>
ſpent great part of her life on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, where it was only in my power to viſit her once for a few months; and it is only of late, that ſtrict intimacy and affection have taken place which always indeed ſubſiſted, but in a leſs powerful degree, between us. Length of abſence, and difference of years, have however precluded that unreſerved confidence, which, except at the open and undiſguiſed period of early youth, is not eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed. Aware of the quick ſenſibility of Lady Aubrey's feelings, I forbore to probe wounds ſcarce cloſed, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoided every ſubject likely to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call the paſt to her mind: till laſt night, when the emotion in which I found her paved the way for a communication as unexpected as extraordinary. Lady Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brey confeſſed that accident had intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to her knowledge a family, to meet with whom had been her moſt earneſt wiſh, tho' from a variety of circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:1034200203:156"/>
ſhe had for ever deſpaired of enjoying that ſatisfaction; and that altho' a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of agitating ſenſations had wholly overpowered her at the firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and rendered her ſo apprehenſive of a ſecond as to delay it till returning health and ſtrength might enable her to ſupport the feelings which ſhe knew it muſt occaſion, the inherent ſatisfaction reſulting from the event ſhe was convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced would be of infinite benefit both to her health and tranquillity in future.</p>
                  <p>It was not difficult, continued Lady Meredith, to divine who this family muſt be: and what I have ſeen of every individual in it, perſuades me that Lady Aubrey will not find herſelf deceived in this flattering expectation.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Howard had juſt concluded this intereſting narrative, when Lady Mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dith entering the parlour, told us that Lady Aubrey requeſted our company; and that while we attended her Ladyſhip
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:1034200203:157"/>
ſhe ſhould accompany Mr. Howard once more in his rambles thro' the wood, as it was impoſſible ever to tire in walking over ſo delightful a ſpot as Hubert Hill, and ſhe had not yet been ſhewn all the lions.</p>
                  <p>My ſiſter and I then went up ſtairs. We found our dear Lady Aubrey in bed, for ſhe is not allowed to riſe till the morning is far advanced; but ſhe looked more beautiful as ſhe ſat upright ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by pillows, than any other wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man I ever beheld in all the pride of youth, dreſs, and lovelineſs.</p>
                  <p>There is an expreſſion of feeling lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor in her charming eyes, that would be alone captivating beyond expreſſion, even diveſted of the aid they receive from the perfection of her other features, and I am not certain if it would be in my power to admire her ſo enthuſiaſtically was ſhe relieved from thoſe traces of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, which betraying the ravages of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:1034200203:158"/>
anguiſh, beſpeak in the ſame mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the warmeſt admiration and the moſt compaſſionate ſympathy. In the bloom of eighteen, Miſs Marſdon may have been more beautiful, but could not have proved ſo intereſting, ſo inſinuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as Lady Aubrey appears at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant.</p>
                  <p>She embraced us both tenderly, and apologized for requeſting our company at her bed ſide; but I cannot deny my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſaid ſhe, the gratification of your company from mere motives of cold ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony, while my heart is under the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of ſentiments ſo fervent. I am ſoothed and gratified beyond expreſſion, continued ſhe. My reſt laſt night was more refreſhing and tranquil than any I have enjoyed ſince my accident, which, far from accounting unfortunate, I ſhall ever regard as the bleſſing of providence. With a heart overflowing with gratitude to the Almighty, I offered up my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:1034200203:159"/>
thanks, and compoſed myſelf to ſleep with an inward ſenſation of relief and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, which caſt a gleam of content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment even over my dreams and my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
                  <p>She appeared indeed calm and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed beyond our moſt ſanguine hopes; and tho' a tear of feeling often fell from her eye, and her boſom heaved with an oppreſſion not to be ſuppreſſed, a ſmile of reſigned benevolence often broke thro' the ſedate melancholy ſeated on her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting countenance, and her ſighs ſeemed more the offspring of relief than uneaſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Amidſt the effuſions of that melting and ſoothing tenderneſs which linked our hearts together, and which was tacitly acknowledged to have but one common ſource in my dear father, yet was his name not once pronounced. Amidſt the free and mutual communication which a heart-felt intereſt claimed, tho' to this
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:1034200203:160"/>
every circumſtance alluded and every en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry tended, it was a point at which none of us could arrive. It ſeemed too ſacred, too aweful to be uttered, and muſt have led to particulars at which for worlds we would not as yet have ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to hint.</p>
                  <p>Lady Aubrey, however, by degrees informed us of all we were moſt anxious to know: that during the whole period of our reſidence abroad ſhe had main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a conſtant correſpondence with Mr. Benſley, unknown to every one, and under promiſe of profound ſecrecy. Doubtleſs the appearance of preſerving an intercourſe of any kind with the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed friend of my father, muſt have ſeemed an act of impropriety in the eyes of her own family, and might have been deemed romantic by the world; yet could not this amiable, this angelic woman, remain contentedly ignorant of the fate of a man to whom her whole heart had
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:1034200203:161"/>
once been given up, however unworthy he had proved himſelf by overwhelming her with unmerited ſhame and deſpair, and by driving her, in the gay ſeaſon of a youth which fortune and nature had conſpired to bleſs with a thouſand envied advantages, to bury herſelf in ſolitude and obſcurity.</p>
                  <p>The deſire of addreſſing myſelf to Mr. Benſeley, ſaid Lady Aubrey, had taken poſſeſſion of my mind for ſeveral months previous to my quitting England. From him only could a thouſand circumſtances reach my knowledge, which it was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely eſſential to my very exiſtence to know, and which to no other perſon could even be hinted; yet a number of objections, and difficulties almoſt inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable, deterred me from gratifying a wiſh that every moment grew more ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible. The awkwardneſs of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication by letter appeared formidable, and the apprehenſion of being detected
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:1034200203:162"/>
in a ſtep which I well knew my father would deem derogatory to my dignity, and fraught with impropriety, terrified me. This laſt bar was, alas! but too ſoon removed by that dear parent's death; and yielding to the potency of my anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety, I ventured at length to write to Mr. Benſeley, and informing him of my reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence abroad, where I meant immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to retire, requeſted the favor from time to time of hearing from him.</p>
                  <p>By his anſwer I was relieved from much miſery, and ſpared the anguiſh of vague and fruitleſs conjecture. I was made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with a thouſand particulars, minute and intereſting: I was ſatisfied in the point neareſt my heart—the point in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed which had dictated my ungoverna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and eager deſire of information. I was informed of your ſecluded reſidence in the ſouth of France, and my fervent and inceſſant prayers to heaven I found were at length anſwered:—remorſe the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:1034200203:163"/>
moſt poignant ſucceeded to errors which—</p>
                  <p>She ſtopped for a moment, unable to proceed; but recovering herſelf—dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this correſpondence, continued ſhe, which regularly ſubſiſted between Mr. Benſeley and myſelf till within a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night of his death, I was minutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, according to my moſt earneſt requeſt, of every particular of your man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life, your ſolitude, your amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the plan of education that had been adopted. All, all was intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to me; and this ſingular participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in your welfare gave an intereſt to my exiſtence; and while I deplored the bar that for ever excluded all perſonal knowledge or intercourſe between us, my heart ſtrongly cheriſhed and imbibed a warm and maternal affection, which was daily nouriſhed and encreaſed by the peruſal of letters from B— with which the worthy Mr. Benſeley, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:1034200203:164"/>
to my ſecret wiſhes though not to my avowed requeſt, often favoured me. Theſe letters, dated from your ſolitary abode in Languedoc, written with all the enthuſiaſm of paternal admiration and affection, repeated with unwearied de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light the virtues, the talents, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments of his amiable daughters; and though merely deſigned for the friendly eye of Mr. Benſeley, were faithfully in ſecret tranſmitted to me. The returning conſolation theſe epiſtles indicated thro' the means of his beloved children, to ſpirits worn out by agonizing repentance and remorſe, began at length to afford comfort to mine, and bleſſing heaven for having touched a heart where virtue though obſcured never was eradicated, I in my diſtant ſecluſion partook of his revived though dejected tranquillity, and bending with due humility under the juſt and aweful diſpenſations of Providence, ſtrove with augmented fortitude to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:1034200203:165"/>
to evils to which it had pleaſed hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to grant ſome alleviation.</p>
                  <p>In this way many years rolled on: in compliance with the earneſt entreaties of a friend, who partook of my retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and ſhared my ſorrows, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to admit the ſociety of a few cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen acquaintances, and at length began to experience the calm tranquillity, which, where religion poſſeſſes a due influence over a mind unburthened with the acute ſenſations of ſelf reproach, humility and ſubmiſſion always in ſome meaſure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore: yet ſtill the ſource, after heaven, from whence my chief comfort flowed, was the frequent and intereſting intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence which Mr. Benſeley's letters, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſing others from the quiet retreat at B—, often afforded me; till in Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber laſt, when a packet from my good friend, which had been anxiouſly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected for an unuſual length of time, was put into my hands. The ſeal an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:1034200203:166"/>
fatal news, and my heart with ſecret apprehenſions died within me.</p>
                  <p>Though the moſt romantic flight of imagination, continued this amiable wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſighing with a bitterneſs that ſeemed to rend her boſom, never flattered me with the poſſibility of more than merely knowing he lived, and the moſt miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fluctuation of human events could grant me nothing beyond what I at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enjoyed—the cold ſatisfaction of pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſing letters neither addreſſed to myſelf nor intended for my view; though the hand of death could ſcarce place a bar more unſurmountable between us than that which already ſubſiſted; yet to be told that death itſelf had divided us, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered me with a pang yet unfelt, the violence of which appeared aſtoniſhing even to myſelf.</p>
                  <p>Between thoſe calamities, however, with which, by the common lot of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, we are overwhelmed, and thoſe
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:1034200203:167"/>
which a chequered ſeries of diſmal and ſingular events have produced, a mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial difference muſt ever be felt. The lenient quality that time ſo powerfully poſſeſſes, in mitigating the aſperities of the former, proves wholly ineffectual in thoſe afflictions which diſappointed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or early mortifications have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted; and I confeſs this wound, though in the firſt moments of ſorrow not inferior perhaps to any I had endured, reaſon and reflection much more ſpeedily allayed; unlike the corroding ſting which the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of my former miſeries perpetually renewed, a ſoothing and not unpleaſing regret now reſts on my mind, which, while it melts and ſubdues my heart, does not raiſe a bluſh for the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querable weakneſs it confeſſes.</p>
                  <p>This affecting converſation, to which tears on my ſiſter's part and mine were the only interruption, and which made the eyes of our dear and amiable Lady
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:1034200203:168"/>
Aubrey overflow with a bitterneſs that almoſt wholly exhauſted her, terrified me with the apprehenſion of her ſinking wholly under her agitations. I entreated her to defer for the preſent all further diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on this ſubject, and to allow of our leaving her. But to this ſhe would not be perſuaded to conſent. My ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows have been of ſuch a nature, ſaid ſhe, that all communication of them is impoſſible; and confidence, a ſolace which except with my dear deceaſed friend Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam de St. Hillaire, I never could enjoy. A painful mixture of ſhame and pride, encreaſed perhaps by early proſperity and indulgence, ſealed my lips, and confined my ſufferings to my own ſolitary and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolated boſom; how then can my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, my dear children, (repeated ſhe, folding us alternately in her arms) deny me the ſatisfaction of giving vent to griefs in which their ſympathetic hearts muſt feel a generous concern.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="168" facs="tcp:1034200203:169"/>You may believe, Sophia, we returned the kind careſſes of this amiable friend with all the enthuſiaſtic warmth which a conduct ſo amiable, ſo truly great, could not fail to excite in circumſtances ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly intereſting.</p>
                  <p>Lady Aubrey then proceeded to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that Mr. Benſeley had minutely acquainted her with all our intended ſchemes, and had with his uſual kindneſs voluntarily promiſed, ſhould his declining health permit of ſuch a journey, to pay her a viſit in the courſe of the following ſummer, attended by his wards; to whom this angelic woman was to have been perſonally introduced as a lady who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nored him with ſingular marks of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and regard, but without the ſlighteſt hint of any ſecret connection.</p>
                  <p>To this ſoothing ſcheme, ſaid Lady Aubrey, which I had been unceaſingly revolving in my mind how to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh, I returned a moſt grateful and glad
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:1034200203:170"/>
aſſent, and requeſted to know at what time you were expected in England. But alas! to this letter I received no anſwer. I wrote another, and was informed by a relation, who had opened it after Mr. Benſeley's deceaſe, that the worthy man was no more. It is not eaſy to expreſs the anguiſh and diſappointment I expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced on hearing this diſmal intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence. Tho' inured to mortification and regret, I found I had yet much to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go ere I became callous to their attacks. This blow, by overturning the ſole fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorite plan on which I had built any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining hopes of comfort, ſunk me to the loweſt ſtate of deſpondency; and the loſs of my invaluable friend, Madame de St. Hillaire, put the finiſhing ſtroke to my ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>This laſt calamity preſſed hard indeed. In all my other diſtreſſes, this beloved friend had been, under heaven, my chief ſupport, and had in ſome meaſure ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:1034200203:171"/>
the place of all I had loſt. I had ſtill a friend to love, a friend who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned my warm affection. An early ſeparation from my relations in England, had kept me a ſtranger to all of them, my aunt, Lady Meredith excepted, and ſhe I had known for too ſhort a period to feel for her that attachment which now fills my heart. I was then bereſt of my laſt, my only friend. Ah! can human miſery preſent a more diſmal picture to a heart of ſenſibility, than the melancholy conſideration that none exiſts to animate the feelings of fervent affection.</p>
                  <p>Still, however, the only form in which alleviation touched my boſom, was the hopes of one day meeting with you; and revolving on the means to procure my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf this conſolation, in ſome meaſure diſſipated my gloomy reflections. I knew not where, or to whom to apply for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; and was in this ſtate of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy and uncertainty, when the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:1034200203:172"/>
of my Lord Aubrey's illneſs and requeſt to ſee me arrived. Painful as was the idea of reviſiting England, I he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitated not inſtantly to comply: and my repugnance was in a great meaſure ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, by the hopes of gaining ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation relative to you, tho' to chance alone I could owe the intelligence, Lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle likelihood indeed remained of ſucceſs. A cruel peculiarity of circumſtances de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived me of any light to guide my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearches, and an open and avowed purſuit was precluded me. Yet the poſſibility ſoothed and ſupported my ſpirits; and it was not till I had been ſome weeks in London, that I found how totally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable it was to diſcover a private family whoſe names muſt ever be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully guarded from my ears. My own maid, who had been with me from my early youth, I ventured to entruſt with the enquiry, and two different channels of information occurred; by means of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:1034200203:173"/>
Linroſe's ſervants, with one of whom ſhe was acquainted; and if this failed, Mr. Benſeley's relation might be applied to; but that gentleman I found was lately gone to Holland; and when I addreſſed myſelf by letter to him on the ſubject, he aſſured me in anſwer that the ladies names were as wholly unknown to him as was their abode; and Lady Linroſe's maid alſo informed mine that ſhe did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve two ſuch relations were expected by the family, nor had ſhe learnt that any account of them had been received.</p>
                  <p>Worn out by ſucceſſive diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I could only conjecture that you were ſtill in Languedoc; and unwillingly conſtrained to relinquiſh this purſuit, I prepared myſelf for taking poſſeſſion of my country reſidence according to the dying requeſt of Lord Aubrey, where I was anxious to find myſelf calmly ſettled. Fatigued with the civilities and attentions paid me by a numerous claſs of diſtant
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:1034200203:174"/>
relations and family acquaintance, who crowded on me immediately on my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival, I determined to ſet out for Aubrey Caſtle even at that unpropitious ſeaſon of the year, in defiance of ſundry remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances from my friends, and contrary to the wiſhes of my kind aunt, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to follow when the ſpring was fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther advanced. How ſhall I ever bleſs this reſolution, concluded Lady Aubrey, how fervently ſhall my grateful prayers aſcend to the Almighty, for having in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired a meaſure from which I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived ſuch unſpeakable comfort.</p>
                  <p>Shall not we too bleſs heaven, cried I, every hour of our lives, for the fortunate and providential rencontre. Ah! had we known, while we remained in that inhoſpitable city diſowned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friended—had we but ſuſpected that it contained one kind, invaluable friend, who could have participated in our diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, ſoothed our diſappointments, and

                  <p>Lady Aubrey finds herſelf now ſo much recovered, that the phyſicians de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare their attendance no longer neceſſary, and ſhe is now left to Mr. Rudder's care, who generally viſits her twice a day.</p>

This I could not poſſibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive to do, without touching on our diſappointment in regard to Lord Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont: but I paſſed over it as ſlightly as was in my power.

               <p>LADY Meredith left us ſome days ago. Her old man at home, ſhe ſaid, would be impatient for her return, and ſhe was ſenſible to what admirable hands ſhe entruſted the care of her dear niece's health. The interval ſince I laſt wrote, has indeed produced a change ſo favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in Lady Aubrey's health, that ſhe is able to join us in the parlour; and finds herſelf ſo well, that ſhe talks of leaving Hubert Hill in a few days.

ſhe tells us ſeriouſly that ſhe really longs to find herſelf tranquilly eſtabliſhed in her new reſidence; and we have at length, tho' with great unwillingneſs, given up our importunities.</p>
               <p>You may believe I readily and joyfully conſented to her earneſt requeſt of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companying her to Aubrey Caſtle, where Mr. and Mrs. Howard are to follow when ſome little buſineſs which at preſent detains the former here is concluded.</p>

                  <p>I am ſtill at Hubert Hill. Our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved Lady Aubrey ſet off this morning by herſelf. This change in our plans is occaſioned by an indiſpoſition which has ſeized my ſiſter, and which, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the leaſt alarming, renders her low ſpirited and oppreſt. I ſhould have been uneaſy at leaving her in her preſent

ſituation; and Lady Aubrey, had I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined, would not have deſired it. She has contented herſelf therefore with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting Mr. Howard's promiſe to carry us both to her in a ſhort time, when his buſineſs is finiſhed and my ſiſter's health re-eſtabliſhed.</p>
                  <p>Short as is to be this interval of ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, we did not ſeparate without tears. How gracious, Sophia, have been the diſpenſations of Providence towards us: when we have imagined ourſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted by the whole world, Mr. Howard excepted, and felt ourſelves outcaſts from our family, with what augmented reliſh muſt we not enjoy the ſoothing idea of poſſeſſing a tender and invaluable friend, who gratifies our hearts every moment with new proofs of attachment, and to whom our tenderneſs and regard are e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually eſſential. What a new ſource of happineſs has this unexpected connexion produced.</p>

                  <p>Mr. Howard, who is ever anxious to afford us ſuch amuſements as the unifor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of our tranquil ſtile of life admits, aſked me on Tueſday morning if I choſe to accompany him in an excurſion on horſeback towards a part of the country that was entirely new to me, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully romantic. I gladly conſented; but juſt as we were equipt for our little ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curſion, his attorney from town arrived on buſineſs, and perceiving how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient his leaving home muſt prove, I inſiſted on proſecuting my expedition without him; and merely taking old James the gardener, who has paſt his days in the county, as my eſcort.</p>
                  <p>Fanny was lazy, and would not be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded to ſtir from her work; ſo I ſet off about eleven, the morning being deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:1034200203:184"/>
for the ſeaſon, eager to explore ſome particular pictureſque ſcenes which Mr. Howard had deſcribed as admirable ſubjects for my pencil.</p>
                  <p>The country around was ſo ſingularly beautiful, that I was tempted to go on further than I at firſt intended; for as we are regular people at Hubert Hill, and keep early hours, I wiſhed to be home by two o'clock; but the ſight of a very fine country ſeat at no great diſtance induced me to prolong my ride, from the deſire of admiring it on a nearer view.</p>
                  <p>I had juſt turned the wall of a park that ſurrounded a houſe of a very noble appearance, which James, to whom I applied for information, acquainted me was called Holtenham Abbey, when a party of gentlemen and ladies iſſuing from a gate, with the intention of croſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the road, made my mare plunge, and unable to recover my ſeat, I was
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:1034200203:185"/>
thrown from it with ſuch violence that ſcreams reſounded from every voice.</p>
                  <p>Happily I did not ſuffer from any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tanglement with the ſtirrup or accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and felt at the moment no other bad conſequences from the fall, than the painful one of confuſion at having ſo many people to witneſs this awkward ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident, added to that diſmay which the ſudden ſhock unavoidably occaſioned me.</p>
                  <p>I believe half a dozen gentlemen at leaſt flew inſtantly to my aſſiſtance, to raiſe me from the ground, where, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and without motion, I lay for ſome moments. Good heavens, Madam, exclaimed they all, one after another, how do you find yourſelf? I hope you are not hurt? Where have you ſuffered? and the reſt of the company, who ſeemed diſperſed in walking parties of two or three together, juſt then coming up, I felt myſelf nearly as ſeverely ſtunned by the ſucceſſive repetitions of the ſame en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:1034200203:186"/>
to which at firſt I was unable to make any reply, as I was by the fall it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Smelling bottles were preſented me from all quarters; yet ſome little time elapſed before I could even recollect my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſufficiently to expreſs my thanks for the kindneſs and humanity of their ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
                  <p>An elderly lady, who appeared parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly concerned for me, and who ſeemed to be owner of the noble manſion, inſiſted, the moment I was a little reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, on having me conveyed into the houſe, from which an avenue of no great length only divided us; and aſked me, with much civility and tenderneſs, if I found it impoſſible with aſſiſtance to walk towards it.</p>
                  <p>Happy to eſcape from the company, and embarraſſed by the curioſity and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice I excited, I thankfully accepted this obliging offer, and made a feeble attempt to move forward.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="184" facs="tcp:1034200203:187"/>Pray allow me the honor of conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you, ſaid a young man, who had obliged me to lean on his arm, but whoſe face from perturbation I had not yet diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed: the voice, however, was fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar to my ears, and on regarding him I recollected my aſſiſtant to be Captain Bradſhaw, the friend of Roatſley, againſt whom, notwithſtanding that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, I had conceived no ſmall degree of prejudice, from cauſes which you will I am certain recollect.</p>
                  <p>At the inſtant I caſt my eyes on him, Miſs Seymour, I believe, ſaid he, and bowed with a diffidence that teſtified he had not forgotten the ſelf-introduction to which he owed the acquaintance.</p>
                  <p>The old lady then led the way; and I ſlowly followed, ſupported by Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, without whoſe aſſiſtance I now found I ſhould have been unable to have ſtirred, from a ſevere ſprain in my foot. Indeed ſo painful did it feel, that had not
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:1034200203:188"/>
my anxiety to eſcape from obſervation ſupplied me with fortitude to endure the uneaſineſs that walking occaſioned, I ſhould have concluded moving impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>Moſt of the ladies ſeemed inclined to accompany us, tho' I very earneſtly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated that I might not be the means of interrupting their walk. My worthy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troneſs however perceiving their intended civility conſiderably encreaſed my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity, immediately ſaid, pray ladies and gentlemen don't let this accident in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with your rambles: ſince it has not, thank heaven, turned out very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily, Mr. Bradſhaw and I ſhall attend the young lady; and ſaying this, ſhe made a motion with her hand, which obliged the whole party, tho' with ſeeming reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to leave us; for ſo powerfully does curioſity and the love of novelty prevail in moſt diſpoſitions, that perceiving I was not a ſevere ſufferer from the accident,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:1034200203:189"/>
the company appeared to regard it as a little adventure, the concluſion of which they ſhould not have been ſorry to have witneſſed.</p>
                  <p>When we reached the houſe, at which I did not arrive without conſiderable dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, the door was opened by a foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who uſhered us into a ſuperb par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, where a young lady apparently of about ſeventeen, who might have ſat for the picture of Hebe, was placed by the fire with a book in her hand.</p>
                  <p>She ſeemed to have been confined by ſome ſlight ailment, having a large cap and hood tied careleſsly under her chin.</p>
                  <p>I have brought you an unfortunate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid, Miſs Lucy, cried my conductreſs, and explained my accident in a few words, while Mr. Bradſhaw flew to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure me a glaſs of cold water.</p>
                  <p>Good God, Madam, what a ſhocking accident! cried the young lady with much kindneſs. How dreadfully pale
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:1034200203:190"/>
you look: pray where are you hurt? I hope not ſeverely? and no ſooner had I acknowledged that I ſuſpected my foot had been ſlightly diſlocated, than ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on ſupporting me into her dreſſing room; where, while the lady of the houſe diſpatched a ſervant for a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring ſurgeon, this amiable ſtranger aſſiſted her maid in chafing my foot with Goulard and water to allay the ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, which had encreaſed rapidly from the effort of walking.</p>
                  <p>Lady Mary, for ſo I found this hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble old lady was called, ordered wine and cordials of all kinds to be inſtantly brought, which ſhe inſiſted on adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering to me with a benevolence that diſplayed her character in a point of view ſo humane as to give me the moſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable opinion of her heart. Her young friend was if poſſible ſtill more kind and equally anxious to provide every thing for my eaſe and comfort. My foot
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:1034200203:191"/>
however grew more uneaſy, and ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo ſwelled as to be perfectly ſtiff and extremely painful.</p>
                  <p>Finding myſelf worſe, I was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive of being laid up with this ſtranger family, which ſpite of their civility and goodneſs might have proved as inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for them as diſagreeable to myſelf: I made therefore as light of the accident as I poſſibly could; aſſured the ladies it was quite trifling, and inſiſted on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting my mare and returning home; promiſing to walk her gently, and plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the terror my ſiſter muſt endure at my unaccountable length of abſence.</p>
                  <p>The ſurgeon made his appearance juſt as I ſpoke, and joined the ladies in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding this propoſal as abſolute frenzy. There is no treating caſualties of ſuch a nature in this manner, Madam, ſaid he, with much pompoſity, and though it is to be hoped that ten days confinement, with proper care, may effect a cure, as
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:1034200203:192"/>
many weeks, if you are imprudent, may not ſet you again on foot.</p>
                  <p>If I was your father or mother, my dear Madam, cried Lady Mary, or any relation who poſſeſſed authority or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence over you, I ſhould not only now, but <hi>for ever</hi> prohibit your again ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the back of that fiery, dangerous animal. I can no way reconcile myſelf, added ſhe, to the preſent prevailing mode of ladies becoming profeſſed jockies; an unaccountable paſſion for the maſculine accompliſhment of horſemanſhip ſeems now a days to have extended even to our ſex, and it muſt certainly be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the leaſt graceful and moſt abſurd cuſtom that faſhion ever introduced among females. I am ſure it perſuades many a timid girl to brave dangers from which, under any other form, ſhe would ſhrink with terror: but the <hi>ton</hi> is not only a ſufficient apology for ſuch enterprizes, but a ſupport likewiſe. Excuſe the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:1034200203:193"/>
of my obſervation, dear Madam, continued ſhe with a good humoured ſmile, and pray give me leave to ſend to inform your friends that you are ſafe and in good hands.</p>
                  <p>I returned a thouſand thanks to Lady Mary for her benevolent civilities; but entreated ſhe would not inſiſt on my ſtay as I acknowledged myſelf extremely anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious to get home, and aſſured her there was not the ſlighteſt probable danger in my returning on horſeback, as my mare was remarkably ſafe, and my fall had merely reſulted from the ſudden appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of ſome of the company, which had ſtartled her.</p>
                  <p>As to your going on horſeback, cried ſhe, pray talk of it no more, for indeed you muſt not think of ſuch imprudence. However, ſince you are ſo very eager to leave us, I really wiſh it was in my power to contrive your removal in the way that would the leaſt ſubject you to
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:1034200203:194"/>
inconvenience and uneaſineſs; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately I have at preſent no carriage to offer you; my niece's chariot requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome alterations, was left behind us in town, ſo that for ſome weeks we ſhall have no equipage but my coach, which a lady, who is juſt now my gueſt, got this morning to pay a viſit in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, and I am really uncertain whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or not ſhe will be home till the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Pray, my dear, turning to her young friend, is there any hopes, think you, that Lady Linroſe will behave bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than her promiſe, and return to us before dinner.</p>
                  <p>Conceive my regret and aſtoniſhment, Sophia, at the ſound of a name I ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle expected to hear, and imagine to your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf my concern upon finding there was ſo much probability of my meeting with her Ladyſhip, which her return every inſtant might ſubject me to; a mortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which of all things on earth I moſt
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:1034200203:195"/>
wiſhed to avoid. I was thunderſtruck on perceiving myſelf plunged into a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ſo awkward, and changed colour ſo rapidly, that had not the ladies been happily otherwiſe engaged, they muſt have remarked my emotion.</p>
                  <p>I am indeed afraid, Madam, replied Miſs Lucy, that my mother's return will hardly leave time ſufficient for the young lady's removal this evening; for you know Mrs. Pelcourt and ſhe are old friends; they muſt always have a long chat when they meet, and I make no doubt that if ſhe inſiſts on it, my mother will paſs the day with her.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Her mother.</hi> Here was a freſh ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, which wholly diſconcerted me. To find myſelf all at once involved in difficulties ſo ſingular and unlooked for, ſurrounded by relations who had behaved ſo unworthily by me, and who muſt feel themſelves, when they made the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, ſo aſhamed, ſo vexed at the ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contre,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:1034200203:196"/>
threw me into a confuſion and perplexity not to be expreſſed; and the idea that it was not impoſſible but Roatſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley himſelf might be of the party, put the finiſhing ſtroke to my embarraſſment.</p>
                  <p>You will aſk, I know, Sophia, why I, who was on this occaſion the ſuffering perſon, who had done no injury to La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Linroſe, and who had no cauſe to bluſh for my conduct towards her or her family, ſhould undergo ſuch apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions at the thoughts of ſeeing her:—ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions that ought only to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the conſciouſneſs of miſconduct. I own there might have been more ſpirit perhaps in braving than in yielding to my preſent feelings; but the certainty of plunging a whole family into confuſion was by no means either ſoothihg to my pride or gratifying to my reſentment. I felt myſelf an unwelcome intruder, who was about to create diſturbance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, and I ſunk under the dread of the ſcene that awaited me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="tcp:1034200203:197"/>Come, dear Madam, cried Lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, finding I was ſilent, this day at leaſt you muſt be contented to remain my gueſt: to-morrow, if you continue thus impatient, my carriage ſhall attend your commands; but in the mean time pray allow me to aſk whither the meſſage ſhall be directed with the aſſurances of your ſafety?</p>
                  <p>You are all goodneſs, Madam, ſaid I at length, and I am truly aſhamed of appearing thus obſtinate and ungrateful; but indeed buſineſs of real moment, bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the laſt importance, renders my abſence from home ſo particularly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate, that my ſtay is impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>I ſpoke with an energy that I believe ſurpriſed them, and muſt have ſurmount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all oppoſition had my removal been practicable.</p>
                  <p>Since the lady is ſo eager to be gone, ſaid the ſurgeon, I think ſhe might be conveyed with tolerable ſafety in a coach,
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:1034200203:198"/>
where her leg might be extended at eaſe on the oppoſite ſeat; but as for any other mode of travelling, particularly on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, that, Madam, addreſſing himſelf to me with much importance, you would find not merely inconvenient but painful in the extreme, and really when patients refuſe to be directed by their medical at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, they undoubtedly cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come reſponſible for the conſequences of imprudence.</p>
                  <p>The awkwardneſs of my ſituation giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defiance to all alarm, I was beyond meaſure provoked with the pedantic pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade of this man, who made my deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to depart appear ſtill more ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born and unaccountable: but the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he left the room, I enquired, tho' with many expreſſions of gratitude and obligation, if a carriage could not be procured from the neighbouring village.</p>
                  <p>It is a poor little place, anſwered Lady Mary, and boaſts of no conveyance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:1034200203:199"/>
a cart. I believe a hired chaiſe might indeed be had from N—; but 'tis twelve miles diſtant, and it muſt be ſo late before it could arrive, that I ſhould imagine a few hours could make little difference. 'Tis already almoſt two; and before a ſervant could go and return, the night muſt be far advanced: at all events to-morrow you ſhall have my coach; and tho' I ought to aſk pardon for importun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you ſo much, I muſt confeſs that I ſecretly ſuſpect this buſineſs of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to be nothing more than a pretext under which you wiſh to relieve the fears of your family in perſon. Now, my dear Madam, be aſſured I ſhall be moſt happy to be favoured with the company of any of your friends who on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may chuſe to viſit you, and as a meſſage to that effect can be inſtantly diſpatched by your own ſervant, ſome of your family will join you in a few hours.</p>
                  <p>This is a plan, cried Miſs Lucy with
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:1034200203:200"/>
the utmoſt kindneſs, which cannot fail to render you perfectly at eaſe; ſo do pray, dear Madam, be prevailed with at leaſt to continue with us till to-morrow.</p>
                  <p>My ſituation became now more diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing than ever. I at laſt determined on diſpatching James in all haſte to Hubert Hill, with orders inſtantly to return with Mr. Howard's one horſe chair, and this plan I flattered myſelf would ſave me the mortification of the impending meeting, as in all likelihood it would arrive before Lady Linroſe returned from her viſit.</p>
                  <p>Yet a thouſand different reaſons ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered this ſcheme, tho' the beſt I could deviſe at the time, defective and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable. Lady Linroſe I might by this means avoid; but her ſon might ſtill be of the party; he, and the reſt of the family, I might ſtill encounter; and the late pecuniary tranſactions that had taken place ſince we laſt met, the indigent light in which I had been repreſented to
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:1034200203:201"/>
him, and the pride and incivility of his behaviour on the diſcovery he had ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently made, all conſpired to make me wiſh myſelf in any quarter of the globe at that inſtant rather than under the ſame roof with him. A confuſion of painful and even oppoſite ſenſations agitated and perplexed me, while I felt proud, piqued, and diſpleaſed. I was ſunk, humbled, and dejected, and tears, owing their ſource leſs to mortification than ſenſibility, threatened every moment to burſt from my eyes.</p>
                  <p>This plan, however, I now diſcovered with bitter diſmay, was impracticable, for the day had ſuddenly changed it's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, and it rained with great violence; and tho' I would with pleaſure have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied any inconveniency, I knew not how to inſiſt further on departing without in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring the imputation of being ſelf-wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led and capricious. The weather equally prohibited every mode of travelling, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:1034200203:202"/>
that which was not to be procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; therefore all reſiſtance was at an end; and it only remained that I ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to comply with a good grace to this cruel neceſſity. My countenance, I am afraid, betrayed my feelings; for my two amiable companions joined in intreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me to make myſelf eaſy, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought me to loſe no time in diſpatching my ſervant home with Lady Mary's kind meſſage to my friends.</p>
                  <p>Juſt as they ſpoke, two ladies entered the dreſſing room. May I uſe the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to enquire for the young lady, ſaid one of them, (whom I recollected to have been particularly obliging and attentive to me at the moment of my accident,) I was ſorry to learn below that it had been found neceſſary to call a ſurgeon.</p>
                  <p>His attendance Madam, anſwered I, was wholly unneceſſary, as a ſlight ſprain is all the inconvenience my fall has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned; and I am ſure I ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:1034200203:203"/>
an accident to which I owe ſo much kindneſs and civility.</p>
                  <p>Indeed I am extremely ſorry you have been ſo unfortunate, returned ſhe; tho' we have profited ſo much from the event, that if it is only the means of confining you with us for ſome little time, we ſhall find difficulty enough in regretting it.</p>
                  <p>I endeavoured to return an anſwer ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive of my ſatisfaction on having en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countered a family whoſe humanity did ſo much honor to their characters; but my mind was uneaſy, and I fear my looks contradicted my words.</p>
                  <p>Yes, cried Lady Mary, interrupting, me, yet you were ſo extremely unwilling to truſt yourſelf, tho' but for a ſingle night, with this ſame hoſpitable family, that do you know, niece, our invalid in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on returning upon the identical horſe that gave us all this alarm, in ſpite of the ſurgeon's denunciation againſt ſo imprudent a ſcheme.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:1034200203:204"/>Good heavens! dear Madam, what an idea! But I hope you have entirely given up all thoughts of ſuch a plan.</p>
                  <p>Before I proceed, however, in my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this formidable day, I muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt the preſent converſation by giving you a deſcription of this lady, whoſe manners and converſation appear ſo affa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and engaging. I told you there were two who entered together; but the friend who accompanied this engaging young lady, and on whoſe arm ſhe hung, was remarkable for nothing but an air of ſycophantiſh obſequiouſneſs, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly informed me ſhe reſided in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily in the comfortable capacity of an humble friend.</p>
                  <p>The young lady herſelf appeared about twenty. Her extreme height, which rendered her figure at firſt ſight remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, had not imbibed the ſlighteſt degree of that awkwardneſs which often in very tall people precludes grace; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:1034200203:205"/>
her form was uncommonly ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant, and her features, tho' not ſo regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar on examination as a firſt glance lead me to conclude, being embelliſhed by a very beautiful complexion, and her ſhape improved by an eaſy air, fully entitled her to the encomium of being what is generally eſteemed <hi>a prodigious fine woman.</hi> You will preſently diſcover, Sophia, why my pen is ſo minute in it's deſcriptions.</p>
                  <p>I was much embarraſſed how to make an adequate return to ſo much civility, and yet retain in my own option the power of departing ſhould an opportunity offer.</p>
                  <p>I hope you will believe Ladies, ſaid I at length, that on any other occaſion I ſhould have been beyond meaſure grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with an opportunity of cultivating an acquaintance, which even by anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion gives me the moſt ſincere pleaſure; but this day my leaving home is ſo ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly inconvenient, that I muſt confeſs I
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:1034200203:206"/>
ſhall not be quite at eaſe till I find my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf there; and if the evening improves, I hope you will neither conclude me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful nor obſtinate, if I ſtill perſiſt in my firſt intentions. Hubert Hill is not, by my ſervant's account, above ſeven or eight miles diſtant, and I mean to ſend him off directly with orders to return with Mr. Howard's little carriage, which if the afternoon proves tolerable, is a very eaſy conveyance.</p>
                  <p>Oh no doubt he will ſend his coach for you, cried the young lady. But are you quite determined to leave us?</p>
                  <p>Mr. Howard? ſaid Lady Mary. I have the pleaſure of knowing him well, and an excellent man he is. I was indeed told that he had lately entered into the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſtate, but I did not know how for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate he had been.</p>
                  <p>Perceiving her miſtake, I preſently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceived her by ſaying that my ſiſter was equally ſo in her union with a man of his ſingular worth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="204" facs="tcp:1034200203:207"/>I make no doubt of it, returned ſhe: Mr. Howard is a character of uncommon merit, whoſe connexion muſt confer hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs on any family with whom he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied. I had at all events intended my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the honor of waiting upon him and his new married lady, but I ſhall now have an additional motive.</p>
                  <p>Both Mr. Howard and my ſiſter, I told her, would be much flattered with the intended favor; and added, that my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's one horſe chair would prove a ſafe and comfortable conveyance for my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, as in ſpite of my apparent courage I felt no inclination to venture on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, ſince a more agreeable method of getting home could be adopted.</p>
                  <p>It was wonderful to obſerve the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den change which this laſt ſpeech effected upon the manners of the young lady whoſe affability had hitherto appeared ſo engaging. An expreſſion of ſurprize, which her countenance betrayed, might
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:1034200203:208"/>
have paſſed unnoticed, as alſo the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of her companion, who had not as yet articulated one ſyllable, but had remained in reſpectful ſilence till a faint ſmile from her young patroneſs induced her to ſay, truly it may prove a very ſafe, but ſurely it can't prove a very <hi>comfortable</hi> conveyance in ſuch an evening as this promiſes to be.</p>
                  <p>The alteration which took place in the behaviour of the other, ſoon after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me I had conſiderably abated of my importance in her eyes, from being known. She immediately walked to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the window; her friend followed, and they whiſpered together ſome mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, while the bell ſummoned Miſs Lucy's maid to diſpatch James to Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert Hill.</p>
                  <p>So tis only the people at the little white houſe on the hill, ſaid the young lady in a low voice which I could diſtinctly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear while the meſſage was tranſacting;
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:1034200203:209"/>
her friend replied with ſo much caution that I could only diſtinguiſh the words, quite private ſort of people, I aſſure your Ladyſhip.</p>
                  <p>Lady Mary looked towards them as if uneaſy at their behaviour, and addreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf to her niece, endeavoured to engage her in general converſation: but evidently undeceived as to the fancied importance of the viſitor, her looks of civility and expreſſions of kindneſs were converted into ſilent indifference and haughty unconcern; and as if her curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity had been now thoroughly ſatisfied, ſhe ſoon after left the room.</p>
                  <p>Well, Miſs Seymour, cried Lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, whether you leave us or not, pray, while we have the pleaſure of your com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, don't let us deprive the reſt of my gueſts of partaking of it. I hope you are able to walk into the next room.</p>
                  <p>The amiable Miſs Dudley then inſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that I ſhould take the aſſiſtance of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:1034200203:210"/>
her arm, I made ſhift, tho' with no ſmall degree of pain, to walk into the drawing room, which was luckily on the ſame floor.</p>
                  <p>When we entered, we found ſeveral gentlemen and ladies differently employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: the young lady before mentioned was placed at the harpſichord, ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by moſt of the former, whom ſhe ſeemed enchanting by the divine power of muſic. Our appearance interrupted her for a moment; but after ſlightly bowing, ſhe continued her concerto.</p>
                  <p>The gentlemen all advanced, and made their enquiries after me with great po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs. I caſt my eyes over them with an anxious look, and a ſenſation of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing not unlike diſappointment, on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that Roatſley was not of the party, diſcovered to me that I ſhould not have been quite ſo ſorry to have beheld him as I had imagined.</p>
                  <p>Captain Bradſhaw, the only perſon in
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:1034200203:211"/>
company whom till that morning I had ever ſet eyes on, appeared to regard him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as an acquaintance, and paid me par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular attention. Ah, Sophia! how do trifles, as I have more than once ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, often influence us. This young man, againſt whom I had cheriſhed no ſmall degree of diſlike, now no longer appeared what I uſed formerly to conſider him. Nothing had occurred to alter my prejudice; yet it was already gone. I could regard him only as the friend of Roatſley; as his friend, I was convinced he muſt have merit; and the attentions of that friend could not but prove agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to me.</p>
                  <p>The certainty too of making him ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure his injurious opinion of me, grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied my pride, and the idea, ſuppoſing Roatſley was not at Holtenham, that on their next meeting Captain Bradſhaw might chance to mention me to him, gave life to my converſation, even while
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:1034200203:212"/>
my ſpirits were every moment ſinking under the apprehenſion of the return of Lady Linroſe.</p>
                  <p>I could not help feeling confounded, when Miſs Lucy Dudley, taking her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference from Mr. Bradſhaw, called me occaſionally <hi>Miſs Seymour.</hi> The name, it is true, could lead to nothing, yet the certainty that ſhe muſt have heard of me under that appellation confuſed me.</p>
                  <p>Oh! with what pleaſure did I contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate the countenance of the only female relation, my ſiſter excepted, whom I ever recollect to have ſeen, and how did I trace all the amiable qualities in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which Miſs Parſons's letter lead me to expect. Miſs Jenny kindly tells me, that a family likeneſs between her features and mine augmented the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality ſhe was inclined to feel for her. Ah! Sophia! do you imagine that a ſtrong and remarkable reſemblance to her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diminiſhed the affection I was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:1034200203:213"/>
to retain for her, from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhe was introduced to me.</p>
                  <p>The inſtant I was preſented to her, I thought I remembered having ſeen her before; but it was not immediately that I recollected her to be the young lady who once occaſioned me a pang, (I am ſorry to confeſs it,) not unlike jealouſy on perceiving her ſeated next her brother at the Opera, the evident object of his peculiar regard. There is the ſtrongeſt ſimilarity in the tones of their voices, which are both uncommonly pleaſing, and ſomething even in their turn of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion ſo much alike, that the ſweet Lucy recalled her brother every inſtant to my mind. Indeed, independent of this prepoſſeſſion, her countenance and manners convey an idea of ſuch infinite ſweetneſs and ſenſibility, that I think at all times I muſt have been partial to her.</p>
                  <p>She had placed herſelf on the ſopha by me; but in ſpite of her evident wiſh to
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:1034200203:214"/>
leſſen the awkwardneſs of my ſituation, ſurrounded by a large company to whom but two hours before I had been acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally introduced, and not one of whoſe names, (Captain Bradſhaw's excepted,) I even knew, you may believe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was not kept up without viſible difficulty.</p>
                  <p>At this time the young lady, before ſo particularly deſcribed, ſat at her harpſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chord rattling over ſome little cotillion tunes, and occaſionally interrupting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to laugh and chat with ſeveral gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who leant over her chair. Indeed I ſoon perceived the muſic was only a pretence to render the converſation, of which the poor ſtranger was evidently the topic, leſs remarked. She often looked at me herſelf, and carried the eyes of the gentlemen to examine me, while ſhe continued her diſcourſe in a half whiſper, which the jumbling of the keys prevented my overhearing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="212" facs="tcp:1034200203:215"/>She appeared in great ſpirits; but an affectation too viſible in every motion deſtroyed at leaſt to me the natural grace of her appearance. I began to ſuſpect ſhe might be Miſs Dudley; which idea prevented me from gratifying my curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity by means of her ſiſter, and I em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed myſelf ineffectually in trying to diſcover a reſemblance in her features either to thoſe of Miſs Lucy or her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>At length,however, on that young lady's being called to the end of the room to examine ſome muſic, I enquired of Captain Bradſhaw the name of the lady at the harpſichord; adding, I was ſo ſingularly ſituated as to be a ſtranger to the whole company.</p>
                  <p>Is it poſſible you ſhould be ignorant of it, ſaid he in a tone of ſurprize. It is the celebrated and admired Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth Sedley, whom I am certain you muſt at leaſt have heard of often.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="213" facs="tcp:1034200203:216"/>Sophia, conceive, if you can, my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings at this information. Ah! no! it is impoſſible: for except in a ſimilar ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, they are not to be conceived. My heart beat violently, even while a ſudden faintneſs came over me, and I fear my agitation muſt have been too apparent, for Miſs Lucy juſt then returning to her ſeat, ſaid with much ſweetneſs—I am afraid, Miſs Seymour, your foot is more uneaſy than you will own, for you look extremely pale; and Mr. Bradſhaw fixed his eyes on me with a look of inveſtigation that ſoon changed my complexion from the palid to a deeper dye.</p>
                  <p>The gentlemen now approaching the ſopha, the harpſichord ſeemed deſerted; and ſo I imagine thought Lady Elizabeth, for advancing towards us, ſhe called out in a tone of careleſs familiarity, I am a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid, Miſs Seymour, this will be a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable afternoon for your excurſion in the one horſe chair, for it rains extremely hard.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="214" facs="tcp:1034200203:217"/>The voice in which ſhe pronounced theſe words let me into a ſecret that I had before half ſuſpected, viz. that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of my equipage had ſo much lowered me in her Ladyſhip's eſtimation, as to produce the change in her manner for which I had not been able to aſſign any other motive.</p>
                  <p>I know not whether Miſs Dudley felt the indelicacy of her behaviour, but ſhe immediately ſaid, it is indeed extremely unfortunate, ſince Miſs Seymour is ſo anxious to go, that Mamma ſhould have occupied Lady Mary's coach to-day; for theſe little carriages, tho' mighty pleaſant in fine weather, are not well adapted for rain.</p>
                  <p>Oh in ſuch an evening the thing is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, cried all the gentlemen at once. Miſs Seymour cannot ſurely think of it.</p>
                  <p>It rained indeed harder than ever; and I was truly provoked by a change of weather ſo teizing and unlucky. My
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:1034200203:218"/>
foot was painful, my mind uneaſy, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired reſt for both, and here I was not likely to enjoy eaſe in any form.</p>
                  <p>A carriage was ſoon after heard driv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up to the door, and my heart panted with expectation. I was convinced it was Mr. Roatſley, and no longer har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured a doubt when I heard Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw call out, I dare ſay it is Roatſley, and inſtantly went out to meet him.</p>
                  <p>My perturbation, however, was not of long continuance; for this ſpeech con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced me that tho' he might be expected he made not one of the family; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after Mr. Bradſhaw returned, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by Sir Edward Sudbury.</p>
                  <p>He met with a very gracious reception from the whole company, particularly from Lady Elizabeth, who ſeemed much pleaſed by his entrance. As he did not immediately recognize me amongſt ſo large a company, I began to imagine that perhaps he deſigned to conduct himſelf
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:1034200203:219"/>
with a prudent reſerve; and recollecting his advances in town, which had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted by my departure, now abſence had probably cooled his flame, he might incline to keep at a diſtance and withdraw his notice by degrees.</p>
                  <p>I ſoon found, however, how unjuſt was this ſurmiſe, when Sir Edward, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering me, approached with his uſual modeſty and politeneſs, a glow of ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction being viſible on his countenance.</p>
                  <p>He enquired with anxiety after my health, then for my ſiſter and Mr. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, and regretted in ſtrong terms my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected departure from town, which he ſaid had aſtoniſhed him, as he had no doubt of finding me at Mrs. Hindon's on his return from a ſhort viſit he had made in the country about that time.</p>
                  <p>Dinner was ſoon after announced; and tho' with pain I walked into the parlour, ſupported by the arm of the ſweet Lucy, who gaily ordered all the gentlemen to
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:1034200203:220"/>
depart before us, and reſolutely refuſed all their offers of aſſiſting me.</p>
                  <p>She kindly placed herſelf next me at table; and Sir Edward, though Lady Elizabeth in a manner invited him to go to the other ſide by herſelf, contrived to ſeat himſelf on my other hand. This little mortification by no means ſoftened the hauteur of her behaviour to me; on the contrary, from the moment ſhe remarked Sir Edward's aſſiduities, her countenance betrayed a ſcornful diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but ill concealed under the maſk of neglect and indifference.</p>
                  <p>As the evening advanced, I grew more engroſſed with the expectation of ſeeing Lady Linroſe; and about eight her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip entered the drawing room, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by her eldeſt daughter.</p>
                  <p>I eaſily recollected the face that had been pointed out to me at the Opera. It's expreſſion, however, was much changed. The ſour ſeverity of her aſpect
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:1034200203:221"/>
had now entirely given place to ſmiles, good humour, and condeſcenſion; and though I could not wholly divert myſelf of the prejudice of my firſt prepoſſeſſion, I had at leaſt the impartiality to condemn myſelf for it.</p>
                  <p>I hope you did not wait dinner for me, Lady Mary, cried ſhe, after the firſt compliments were over, for my good friend was rather indiſpoſed, and ſo anxious for my ſtay, that I found it would have been unkind to have refuſed.</p>
                  <p>I did not expect your Ladyſhip, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Lady Mary, and now that you are returned I ought not to regret your abſence, as to that alone I owe the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of another viſitor, who has only fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured me with it becauſe my coach was not to be had to carry her home. Pray give me leave, Miſs Seymour, added ſhe, to have the pleaſure of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing you to Lady Linroſe.</p>
                  <p>I coloured at the introduction. But
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:1034200203:222"/>
Lady Linroſe, with much politeneſs and no change of countenance, ſaid ſhe ſhould be happy to have the honour of knowing me, and hoped her having the carriage had been no very material inconvenience to me.</p>
                  <p>Miſs Dudley, however, to whom I un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent the ſame ceremony, only half bowing to my curtſey, ſtared me in the face with evident curioſity, and a look of ſupercilious eaſe which wholly diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed me.</p>
                  <p>She is by no means plain; but a look of conſcious ſuperiority renders her fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures determinedly unpleaſing.</p>
                  <p>My accident, for which Lady Linroſe teſtified much regret and concern, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed converſation for the firſt quarter of an hour: but her open and unreſerved affability immediately convinced me that no ſuſpicion had ariſen in her mind on hearing my name, and her manner was ſo totally oppoſite from what I expected
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:1034200203:223"/>
to have found it, that in ſpite of my long cheriſhed reſentment I could not avoid feeling delighted to perceive the mother of Roatſley ſo much more amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than I had conceived poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Relieved from my alarm of being known, I flattered myſelf I ſhould ſoon grow more compoſed: but ah! Sophia, remained there not yet ſufficient to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turb and diſtreſs me? Lady Elizabeth! to meet with her, and in a party ſo gay, where the relations on both ſides ſeemed met to rejoice over the approaching union which was ſoon to cement their friendſhip and intimacy by ſtill ſtronger ties! Oh how ſunk, dejected, and diſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited did I feel.</p>
                  <p>The company were not yet ſat down to cards, but continued chatting during a ſhort interval which ſucceeded to the entrance of Lady Linroſe and her daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, when the door opened, and Mr. Howard, who anxious to relieve Fanny's
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:1034200203:224"/>
apprehenſions, had ſet off in defiance of the inclemency of the evening, was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced.</p>
                  <p>Lady Mary received him with the kindneſs and familiarity due to an old friend, (for I find they have been long acquainted), and congratulated him on my fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ety, which I give you my word, ſaid ſhe, you chiefly owe to me; for ſo eager was Miſs Seymour to return home, that I was obliged to exert the authority which above forty years ſeniority has given me over her, to prevent her riſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her neck upon that horrid horſe of your's, which I hope you will diſpoſe of in all haſte.</p>
                  <p>My joy at ſeeing Mr. Howard, who was equally delighted to find me ſo ſlightly hurt, drove Lady Linroſe for an inſtant from my mind. The idea ſoon recurred, however, when on turning round, I perceived the alteration which his unexpected appearance had produced
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:1034200203:225"/>
on her countenance. A look of gloom, aſtoniſhment, and vexation, were there predominant; and a fluſh of embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment tinged her cheeks. The truth ſeemed at once to have flaſhed upon her mind. Mr. Howard, ſhe well knew; and my name had been repeated to her ſo often from his lips, that no doubt could remain. She ſeemed for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment confounded and irreſolute, but on Lady Mary's preſenting Mr. Howard to her, ſhe appeared ſuddenly to recollect herſelf and received him as an utter ſtranger, whom ſhe had never before beheld, with a cold formality not untinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured with hauteur.</p>
                  <p>He on his part, finding her deſign was to affect ignorance, bowed with po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite diſtance, and continued to chat with his uſual eaſe to Lady Mary.</p>
                  <p>From the moment of his appearance, Lady Linroſe kept a profound ſilence. She often glanced upon me an eye of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:1034200203:226"/>
ſcrutiny as if by ſtealth, and her looks were by no means expreſſive of ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: but the inſtant I ſeemed to remark her notice, ſhe withdrew it and employed herſelf very buſily at her knitting, which ſhe entangled and diſentangled unceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly with much ingenuity.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Howard, in ſpite of the moſt preſſing entreaties, inſiſted on returning home, though the evening was damp and cold. I would have given the world to have accompanied him; but finding the propoſal would be received with great oppoſition, I prevailed on myſelf to ſay nothing, Lady Mary promiſing herſelf to accompany me to Hubert Hill in the morning.</p>
                  <p>After he was gone, the company di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into little parties. Thoſe who preferred cards, ſat down to the card ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, while moſt of the young people ſeemed more inclined to chat.</p>
                  <p>All the gentlemen, Sir Edward and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:1034200203:227"/>
Captain Bradſhaw excepted, flocked around Lady Elizabeth's chair. They ſeemed indeed moſt zealous in their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs, and attached themſelves wholly to her; liſtening with delight to every little ſally which levity drew from her lips, while ſhe received their homage with a pride ſhe took but little pains to conceal. Oh! my Sophia, from this ſevere ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, are you not afraid that my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate partiality has given birth to the worſt of paſſions, envy and injuſtice. Diſappointment, by calling forth our powers of exertion, is generally thought to improve the heart; but I fear you will conclude my mortifications have had a very different effect on mine. Believe me, however, my dear, when I ſolemnly declare that thoſe mean paſſions are far from having influenced me in my repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of Lady Elizabeth. Had her manners poſſeſſed that poliſhed dignity, or her converſation that unaſſuming good
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:1034200203:228"/>
ſenſe, which from the choice of Mr. Roatſley I could not but expect, be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured I ſhould have admired with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudiced eyes the woman of his heart: but oh! how oppoſite did I conceive that woman to be from what I find her. How pleaſed, how gratified did ſhe not ſeem with the flattery and attention of the gentlemen preſent; who really, as far as one day's acquaintance could ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble me to judge, appeared uncommonly inſipid in their converſation, and far from engaging in their addreſs. But pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably they ſuffered not a little from the compariſon my thoughts were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drawing between them and another, ah! how infinitely their ſuperior.</p>
                  <p>Ought I not to regard this marriage as a material fault in Mr. Roatſley's charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: for that his chief, if not his only aim in it is fortune, I cannot help being convinced; and is it not an unpardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble error to prize the advantages of ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:1034200203:229"/>
ſo highly, and to hold domeſtic happineſs in ſo low eſtimation. Yet I ought not to judge thus harſhly. We know not a thouſand circumſtances which may render this match not only laudable but meritorious; and of Lady Elizabeth I merely form my opinion from the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a few hours, where the little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of addreſs muſt be ſuppoſed wholly to have influenced my judgment. Erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous as this mode of concluſion may be, yet the manner ſo generally beſpeaks the character, that where the one is informed and intelligent, the other ſeldom or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver appears trifling or diſguſting.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the company. Lady Linroſe being engaged at whiſt, ſtill pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved towards me the cold diſtance ſhe had aſſumed ſince Mr. Howard's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and addreſſed herſelf to me no more during the remainder of the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Her eldeſt daughter ſeemed lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid and out of ſpirits, and at length
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:1034200203:230"/>
took up a book, in which however ſhe only occaſionally looked, often recurring to the inveſtigation of my figure, which appeared much the moſt amuſing em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of the two; for ſhe examined me ſometimes for minutes together with no great cordiality in her countenance, and with entire diſregard to the uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it gave me. Lady Elizabeth was ſoon perſuaded to retire to the next apartment, where ſhe was ſolicited to play on the organ, which induced almoſt all the company to follow her. Miſs Lucy Dudley, however, ſeeing me diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged and ſilent, kindly reſumed her ſeat on a ſopha; where, with Sir Edward and Mr. Bradſhaw, we made a ſort of diſtinct cotterie, and began to chat very agreeably together.</p>
                  <p>Lady Linroſe, who appeared to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark with diſpleaſure her daughter's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to me, ſoon called her to look over her cards, and kept her by her ſide
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:1034200203:231"/>
the reſt of the evening; and a meſſage from the muſic room ſoon after requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sir Edward to accompany on the flute Lady Elizabeth's voice in a ſong, unwillingly obliging him to leave the drawing room, Mr. Bradſhaw and I were left in a manner tete a tete on the ſopha. I found him agreeable and intelligent, attended with a certain bluntneſs of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner which rather inſpired the idea of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity than rudeneſs, and we ſoon entered into a moſt intereſting converſation.</p>
                  <p>Pray, ſaid he, may I aſk your opinion of Lady Elizabeth. She is univerſally followed and admired; yet I cannot help ſuſpecting that her ſplendid fortune and brilliant proſpects have contributed full as much to place her ſo high in the liſts of beauty as any intrinſic charms ſhe poſſeſſes; but I make no doubt you will not agree in my opinion, for I know on this ſubject it is impoſſible you ſhould talk according to conſcience.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="229" facs="tcp:1034200203:232"/>Why ſo, ſaid I.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe it is wholly but of nature for one fine woman to give her genuine ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of another.</p>
                  <p>Do you then imagine envy ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally prevalent.</p>
                  <p>By no means. I only believe that the terror of ſuch an imputation induces every handſome female to beſtow upon another encomiums infinitely beyond her private opinion.</p>
                  <p>To prove my ſincerity, ſaid I, I will acknowledge, that Lady Elizabeth, tho' undoubtedly a fine looking woman, is leſs ſo than from report I expected to find her.</p>
                  <p>Had ſhe truſted to nature, returned he, ſhe might have merited the appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you give her; but affectation and coquetry will diſtort the fineſt features, and produce awkwardneſs where we ought to admire grace.</p>
                  <p>That the friend of Mr. Roatſley ſhould
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:1034200203:233"/>
expreſs to a ſtranger, with ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, an opinion ſo unfavourable of the woman who was ſoon to be united to him, ſurprized me not a little, and I could only account for it by ſuppoſing that her coquetiſh behaviour had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked him ſo much as to put him out of all patience and had rendered his pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence off its guard.</p>
                  <p>I thought, ſaid I, all her little follies of that ſort were ſoon to have a ſpeedy concluſion.</p>
                  <p>Concluſion, repeated he, in a voice of undiſguiſed diſpleaſure; not ſo long as youth and good looks remain, I'll be ſworn; at leaſt if we may judge of the future by the preſent.</p>
                  <p>I thought Lady Elizabeth had been on the verge of matrimony, ſaid I, with as much compoſure as I could aſſume, yet trembling to hear it confirmed from authority ſo indiſputable.</p>
                  <p>And pray can you, Miſs Seymour,
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:1034200203:234"/>
who have paſſed part of the winter in town, pretend to imagine that matri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, to a vain woman, excludes the attentions of a crowd of followers.</p>
                  <p>Your reproof of my ignorance is juſt, ſaid I, (attempting to ſmile, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly depreſſed by an anſwer ſo unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory and evaſive, and which yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citly acknowledged the truth of Lady Elizabeth's engagement) but I was little in company, had few acquaintance, and ſpent my time chiefly at home in a very ſober domeſtic family.</p>
                  <p>Yes, we could not conceive where you had hid yourſelf, for you were to be ſeen no where. It was at one time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded that you muſt have left town.</p>
                  <p>That was exactly the caſe, returned I.</p>
                  <p>Not <hi>exactly,</hi> for I think you did not go till the beginning of March.</p>
                  <p>I could not avoid being rather ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, on finding Mr. Bradſhaw, with whom I had had when in town not the
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:1034200203:235"/>
ſlighteſt intercourſe or acquaintance, ſo well informed of my motions; and read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my thoughts from a tranſient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion in my countenance—you are aſtoniſhed, ſaid he, ſmiling, to find me ſo accurate in this point; but I believe you would be ſtill more ſo were I to inform you how long I have had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of conſidering myſelf intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with you, though entirely with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your knowledge or participation.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs my ſurpriſe, cried I, laughing, and alſo my regret, that I ſhould have been ſo fortunate without knowing it.</p>
                  <p>O, in regard to Miſs Seymour, I give you my word I am extremely intelligent.</p>
                  <p>I began faintly to ſuſpect from whence this information had been derived, and to flatter myſelf that it might have owed its origin to Roatſley's ſolicitude. This idea produced an anxiety beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure potent, to draw ſome ſoothing par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:1034200203:236"/>
from his friend; but as if eager to excite a curioſity be meant not to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify—perhaps, cried he, you might be no leſs ſurprized were you to know that I was in conſtant purſuit of you all the beginning of the winter; nay, and what is yet more wonderful and perplexing, I do not claim either merit to myſelf or gratitude from you, for the indefatigable pains and induſtry I employed in hunting after you at every place of amuſement where it was probable you might appear.</p>
                  <p>It is very wonderful indeed, cried I, ſecretly delighted, nor could I ever have ſuſpected, ſtranger as I found myſelf in this country, that I poſſeſſed any friends ſufficiently intereſted in me to be ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous how or where I paſſed my time.</p>
                  <p>O, cried he with an inveſtigating look that ſeemed to penetrate into what effect his words might produce, nature has been ſo bountifully profuſe to ſome of her happy favorites, as to endow them
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:1034200203:237"/>
with the gift of creating friends by a <hi>coup d'oeil</hi>—friends, who exiſt but in their ſight, who live but on their ſmiles, and who watch with unwearied patience and aſſiduity, every opportunity for a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which indulgent fortune may throw in their way: friends, who develope at one glance, and adore almoſt in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, thoſe virtues and excellencies which in common mortals require inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy, inveſtigation, and length of time, to expand and diſcover themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Vague as were theſe expreſſions, a dawning ray of hope led me to give them an interpretation ſo conſcious, as covered me with bluſhes. I knew not what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to make; and the earneſt look with, which he evidently tried to develope my thoughts, compleated my embarraſſment.</p>
                  <p>I am quite in the dark, cried I at length, and cannot conceive at what you aim.</p>
                  <p>So I perceive, ſaid he with a ſatyrical
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:1034200203:238"/>
ſmile; but I intreat that my words may not throw you into any perplexity. I ſhould be miſerable, were your reſt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night to be diſturbed from a fruitleſs at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to unriddle my myſterious oracles.</p>
                  <p>I believe my reſt will not be eaſily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted this night, replied I with a careleſs air, for my fatigues, or rather my alarm, has exhauſted me a good deal, and I feel quite drowſy and ſtupid.</p>
                  <p>Perceiving the gravity with which I ſpoke, Mr. Bradſhaw inſtantly-aſſumed a more reſerved behaviour, and ſhifting the diſcourſe to other topics, I diſcovered that he had not gone into the country at the time I imagined, from the private converſation I overheard, nor for ſome weeks after. "I was ſeveral times un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the apprehenſion of recruiting orders, ſaid he, but received a longer reprieve than I had dared flatter myſelf with the hopes of obtaining.</p>
                  <p>The card party having now concluded
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:1034200203:239"/>
their rubbers, and Lady Elizabeth, with her ſuite of attendants, being returned into the drawing room, a period was put to our converſation. But it left the ſtrongeſt impreſſion on my mind, and at ſupper I could not help ſecretly wiſhing that Mr. Bradſhaw might be placed next me. In this however I was diſappointed; for Sir Edward betrayed an anxiety ſo eager to procure a ſeat next mine, that the other with a grave bow gave way to him.</p>
                  <p>At this little manoeuvre Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth appeared by no means pleaſed. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed nothing could be more pointed than the haughtineſs of her manner to me the whole evening. A coquet, it would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, expects the excluſive privilege of enjoying the homage of every man who beholds her; for tho' the reſt of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, Mr. Bradſhaw excepted, attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her with the moſt zealous aſſiduity, the mortification ſhe experienced in finding
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:1034200203:240"/>
this devotion was not unanimous, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently hurt and corroded her. Whether the meanneſs of my equipage, and the humility of my abode, at the <hi>little whtie houſe on the hill,</hi> increaſed her indignation, I know not, but ſhe regarded me with looks of contempt, and behaved to Sir Edward with ſo much childiſh ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that I began at length to ſuſpect ſome ſecret partiality muſt have produced a conduct for which mere ſelfiſh vanity ſeemed an inadequate cauſe.</p>
                  <p>This ſullen behaviour of Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth, the cold diſtance of Lady Linroſe, and the imperious diſregard of her eldeſt daughter, added to my being conſcious how diſagreeable my preſence, tho' from very different motives, muſt prove to them all, made me feel beyond meaſure uncomfortable; and the painful weight which lay heavy at my heart, and wholly depreſſed my ſpirits, made Sir Edward's converſation not merely unpleaſant but
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:1034200203:241"/>
irkſome to me; eſpecially as my ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of Lady Elizabeth's attachment was ſtrengthened and confirmed every inſtant by her increaſing uneaſineſs. When I conſidered however how inferior Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward was in all points to his competitor, it was not poſſible for me to conceive that caprice, or folly itſelf, could be blind to the ſtriking difference between them.</p>
                  <p>The cordial intimacy that ſubſiſted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two families, and indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded all preſent but myſelf, not only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded me from all ſhare of the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which I was far from regretting, but made me feel awkward, as well as miſerable. Lady Mary indeed often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed herſelf to me with peculiar civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but as I was placed at a diſtance from her, politeneſs did not compenſate for the rude neglect of her niece.</p>
                  <p>The converſation happening to turn on reſemblances, I think, ſaid Sir Edward, I never beheld a more ſtriking likeneſs
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:1034200203:242"/>
than the profiles of Miſs Lucy Dudley and Miſs Seymour exhibit at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I have been conſidering them on each ſide of me for ſome time, with al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt an equal mixture of wonder and admiration.</p>
                  <p>A likeneſs! repeated Miſs Dudley. I muſt acknowledge I ſcarce ever beheld two faces in my opinion more oppoſite.</p>
                  <p>I am extremely ſorry to differ from you, Madam, returned he; but I ſtill dare ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the company if my remark is not juſt.</p>
                  <p>Strikingly ſo indeed, cried Lady Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; tho' till it was mentioned I own I was not ſenſible of the reſemblance. But in ſpite of the difference of complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion it is really remarkable. Don't your Ladyſhip think ſo, added ſhe, turning to Lady Linroſe?</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs, returned her Ladyſhip, with a cold, embarraſſed air, I am of
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:1034200203:243"/>
Caroline's opinion: I cannot perceive the likeneſs.</p>
                  <p>Good heavens! cried Caroline, how ſhould there be any. The eyes of the one are black, and Lucy's are quite blue.</p>
                  <p>I did not ſpeak of the eyes of the two ladies, but of their profiles, ſaid Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. There is even ſomewhat in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of countenance ſo much alike, that had I never before been in company with either, I ſhould have concluded them nearly related.</p>
                  <p>What effect theſe words produced in the countenances of Lady Linroſe and her daughters, I had not reſolution to examine, and conſcious confuſion made me keep my eyes fixed on the table; from which however I ſoon raiſed them in aſtoniſhment on hearing Lady Linroſe ſay, you pay my daughter a very unme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited compliment by the compariſon, Sir Edward, and really now you put it into my head, I don't know but there is ſome
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:1034200203:244"/>
ſort of likeneſs, eſpecially in the under part of the face: and ſoon after, when we were ſeparating for the night, her La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyſhip wiſhed me a good night with par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular civility and affability.</p>
                  <p>Confounded with the various events of the day, the moment I found myſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone in the chamber allotted me, I threw myſelf into a chair, and gave way to a train of reflections, which ſo wholly over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered me, as to baniſh all deſire of ſleep. I could not but admire the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity of that chance, which had conduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me ſo ſtrangely into the midſt of my relations, and to the party which of all others I wiſhed the moſt to avoid; while I knew that my preſence, by overwhelm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with confuſion and embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, muſt prove ſtill more diſagreeable to them than to myſelf. Lady Elizabeth too—to feel all my half-ſuppreſſed emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions animated and renewed by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:1034200203:245"/>
and unwiſhed for rencontre, ah! Sophia! don't you pity me?</p>
                  <p>After paſſing a very reſtleſs night, I found my foot ſo much worſe, that walking even into the next room was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impracticable. I therefore ſent a meſſage to Lady Mary by her maid, who aſſiſted me to dreſs, intimating that if her Ladyſhip would give me leave, I ſhould breakfaſt in my own apartment, where I wiſhed to remain till the carriage was ordered to carry me home. By this means I avoided ſeeing any of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, whom I really dreaded encounter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at breakfaſt, after the perturbation of the preceding day. I regretted how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, that in eſcaping from the others, I muſt be deprived of ſeeing Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, whoſe myſterious diſcourſe it muſt be owned aſtoniſhed though it did not perplex me, and formed no inconſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble portion of my reflexions during the night.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="243" facs="tcp:1034200203:246"/>Lady Mary entered my chamber ſoon after, and made a thouſand kind enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries reſpecting my health. She informed me that Lady Linroſe was confined to bed with a headach, and that Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw had ſet off for his quarters two hours before breakfaſt: and after kindly diſapproving of my imprudence in ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing home, told me, ſince I was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to go, ſhe ſhould herſelf ſee me ſafe to Hubert Hill, as ſhe wiſhed to take the earlieſt opportunity of waiting on Mrs. Howard.</p>
                  <p>Miſs Lucy Dudley was likewiſe ſo obliging as to pay me a viſit before I left Holtenham. While ſhe ſat with me in my chamber, Lady Mary again entered. I think an airing will be of ſervice to you, my dear, ſaid ſhe to her, after your late confinement. Pray will you accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany me to Mrs. Howard's. Her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band is an old friend of mine, and I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs few or none I reſpect ſo highly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:1034200203:247"/>With all my heart, my dear Madam, cried ſhe; and having ſent the maid for her hat, we immediately proceeded down ſtairs, which was to me a very difficult undertaking and one that I did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh without great pain, though I had an aſſiſtant on each hand.</p>
                  <p>When we entered the hall, we were met by Lady Elizabeth and Miſs Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. The former, with a reluctant bow, hoped I was well: and the other, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out even vouchſafing me that civility, haſtily called out—Lucy, where are you going?</p>
                  <p>I mean to accompany Lady Mary and Miſs Seymour. The day is fine, and an airing will be agreeable.</p>
                  <p>I believe Mamma will not allow of your going, ſiſter.</p>
                  <p>Why ſo.</p>
                  <p>Nay, I ſhall go aſk her: and inſtantly returning, ſaid—Mamma does not chuſe
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:1034200203:248"/>
you ſhould riſk taking cold by airing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Lucy.</p>
                  <p>Lord how odd, when it is the ſweeteſt weather in the world.</p>
                  <p>O there is no chance of cold in ſuch a morning, cried Lady Mary. It will do her good I'm convinced.</p>
                  <p>It is Mamma's commands, ſaid Miſs Caroline gravely; and although the ſweet Lucy went herſelf to ſolicit, ſhe came back diſappointed. I am very ſorry, ſaid ſhe, taking my hand, that I cannot have the pleaſure of your company a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle longer; but I hope Lady Mary will viſit at Hubert Hill more than once while we remain at Holtenham, and I ſhall moſt aſſuredly be of the party next time.</p>
                  <p>Lady Linroſe, you perceive, adheres with conſcientious integrity to her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of debarring all intercourſe between her family and ours. Angry as I am, there is ſomewhat in her manners ſo inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:1034200203:249"/>
that I cannot ſo cordially blame her conduct as I did before I ſaw her: nay what is ſtill more ſtrange, I cannot avoid ſuggeſting excuſes for her beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; and even feel ſomewhat ſoothing and conſolatory in the idea that Roatſley's mother, whom I deſire ſo much to love and reſpect, ſeems more worthy of theſe ſentiments than I ever imagined ſhe could prove. Her ſon reſembles her extremely, though the expreſſion is different.</p>
                  <p>I believe, Sophia, prejudice and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality blind the eye of judgment ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountably, that people are ſeldom to be truſted in their prepoſſeſſions where a ſtrong and lively intereſt is at ſtake. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps we have judged too hardly of this family. To oppoſe Lord Belmont in a favourite point, may be to relinquiſh all hopes of his favour for ever; and if ſuch is the inflexibility of his temper Lady Linroſe is not ſo much to blame.</p>
                  <p>Fanny was much relieved by my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:1034200203:250"/>
though I looked miſerably ill. My foot was painful, and my mind in agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the inſtant Lady Mary left us, I was put to bed, where however I did not ſleep, but enjoyed a more ſoothing relief in relating to my ſiſter all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of my diſagreeable adventure.</p>

               <p>AS my ſprain ſtill confines me to the ſopha, and my journal is always my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite amuſement, I have employed the two laſt days almoſt conſtantly in writing. Indeed I am happy to fly to
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:1034200203:251"/>
any occupation that has the power of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding my thoughts: for my Sophia will eaſily conceive the late incident was but ill calculated for deſtroying that fatal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, which I flattered myſelf time and abſence, aſſiſted by my moſt vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous exertions, would at length ſubdue. Would to heaven the marriage was once finally concluded. When doubt (abſurd as it is to doubt) is converted into cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, my endeavours I am convinced muſt be ſucceſsful. I may ſuffer at firſt, but theſe turbulent feelings will abate. At preſent a thouſand circumſtances are ever ready to occur to rouſe and animate an attachment alas! too inſinuating.</p>
               <p>How can I account for Roatſley's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, hinted to me by his friend. Oh! my dear, was it indeed Roatſley who oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned Mr. Bradſhaw's reſearches? why then his ſilence to Mr. Howard's letter; and why, with engagements ſo ſerious on his hands, could he allow in
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:1034200203:252"/>
himſelf a ſolicitude ſo fruitleſs? His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct altogether is inexplicable, and the more I attempt to unravel it, the leſs my conjectures give me ſatisfaction.</p>
               <p>Are you not aſtoniſhed, my love, at my repreſentation of Lady Elizabeth Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley. Is it poſſible to believe Roatſley can make ſuch a ſacrifice to fortune. Oh! Sophia! a ſacrifice to principle I am convinced it muſt be. Duty and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion have prevailed with him to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in a match on which his family have ſet their hearts.</p>

                  <p>I have been viſited during my confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by the good parſon's family, who ſpent yeſterday with us.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Heathcote, though unacquainted but by report with Lady Mary Lawrence, told us a thouſand little country anec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:1034200203:253"/>
of her, which all proved the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her heart and the liberality of her ample purſe; for ſhe is poſſeſſed of a ſplendid income, having been left by her late huſband the ſole diſpoſal of his fortune. This fortune, Mrs. Heathcote ſaid, it was generally ſuppoſed would center in her neice, Lady Elizabeth Sed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, who was not much beloved by the ladies in the neighbourhood, as ſhe uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly behaved to them with a conſcious ſuperiority, and imperious reſerve, that rendered her company formal and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting. Indeed, ſaid ſhe, her Ladyſhip, I am told, exacts a deference and atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that few are willing to pay; for which reaſon there is uſually a party at Holtenham of people of the firſt rank and importance from town, with whom alone Lady Elizabeth will aſſociate on a footing of equality.</p>
                  <p>I ventured to enquire, finding the good woman both intelligent and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:1034200203:254"/>
whether or not Lord Linroſe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed any property in this part of the country. She believed not, ſhe told me: but ſince Mr. Howard had left England, above one half of the eſtates around had changed their original proprietors; and my Lord Belmont had lately made two different purchaſes of conſiderable amount, which had ſecured to him a decided par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liamentary intereſt in the county. On one of theſe eſtates, ſaid ſhe, to which he has given the name of Mount Dudley, and which is not above ſeven miles diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, he has built a very elegant though not a very large houſe, and has preſented it to his favourite grand ſon Mr. Roatſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, who however has never lived in it as it has not yet been put in order for a family: but I underſtand they are fitting it up in all haſte, and furniſhing it very magnificiently for his place of reſidence ſo ſoon as his marriage is concluded: ſo
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:1034200203:255"/>
you will have them for neighbours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently.</p>
                  <p>Is that event ſoon to take place, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded Fanny.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, Madam, nobody ſeems to know. It has been long talked of; and before Mr. Roatſley ſet out on his tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels, every one ſaid it would happen di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly on his return. But it has been whiſpered ſince his return, that matters are not in ſuch forwardneſs as was ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. The young man's ardour is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be cooled; nay ſome people ſay it never was extremely violent; but that when he was very young, and the lady hardly fifteen, there ſubſiſted a childiſh attachment between them, which originated entirely on the ſide of Lady Elizabeth; and that Lord Belmont, who has been unfortunate in ſome of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, particularly in the article of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony, and who was not eaſily recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to the preſent Lord Linroſe on his
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:1034200203:256"/>
marriage, although by the death of a dlſtant relation her Ladyſhip has brought him a very conſiderable fortune, exacted a promiſe, and promoted an engagement between his grandſon and this lady, which is intended to be concluded on his Lordſhip's return from the Continent.</p>
                  <p>Lady Elizabeth is much to be pitied, in my opinion, cried Fanny, if with all her ſplendid advantages of birth and fortune they cannot ſecure the heart of the man ſhe has choſen.</p>
                  <p>I agree with you perfectly, Madam: But I believe ladies of ſuperior rank and education don't always think in that man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and by what I hear, Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth is not much calculated for domeſtic happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Conſcious of my ſecret anxiety, I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bore, while Mr. Howard and the reſt of the company were preſent, to prolong the ſubject: but finding my ſelf acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally alone with Mrs. Heathcote, for a
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:1034200203:257"/>
quarter of an hour after dinner, I artfully renewed the topic of Lady Elizabeth; and ſhe then told me ſhe was intimately connected with the gentlewoman who had ſuperintended her education as go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs, from whence ſhe had drawn the early part of her information. Mr. Roatſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, ſaid ſhe, has been I know acquainted with the young lady from infancy. She was his ſiſter's friend, and had often been his own playfellow. It is not improbable therefore that her infantine attachment had produced in him a return of affection before he went abroad that might par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take more of gratitude than paſſion. It muſt be owned Lady Elizabeth has but ill anſwered the fond expectations of her family; and probably he finds himſelf diſappointed, after ſeveral years abſence. But there is no truſting to report. It is very certain however that he has not once viſited at Holtenham ſince his arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; though, owing to Lady Mary's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:1034200203:258"/>
the family only paſſed a very few weeks this winter in town. They ſay Lady Elizabeth is much offended at the coolneſs of his aſſiduities, and that there is a very formidable rival, Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sudbury, in the way, who is much in favour with her Ladyſhip at preſent, but I dare ſay there is nothing in it.</p>
                  <p>All this accounts a little, Sophia, for Captain Bradſhaw's inſinuations.</p>

                  <p>To-day I have ventured to take a ſhort walk, and am conſiderably better. We have had compliments of enquiry from Lady Mary after my health more than once.</p>
                  <p>We have been rather uneaſy at not hearing from our dear, dear Lady Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brey all this while; and we now find we have had but too much reaſon for appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion:
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:1034200203:259"/>
alas! ſhe has had a relapſe; but thank God not an alarming one. She is now, ſhe tells us, in the kindeſt of letters which we received this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, quite recovered, and has got Sir William and Lady Meredith with her at the caſtle. I find myſelf ſettled here, ſays ſhe, much to my ſatisfaction. The ancient architecture of my abode has nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther baniſhed light, nor precluded cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs; and I am determined its gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur ſhall on no account be fettered with ſtate or parade. My mind begins to partake of the tranquility around me; and I am enabled myſelf to taſte that comfort which an overgrown and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe uſeleſs fortune allows me the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of diſpenſing to others. But when ſhall my riſing ſatisfaction receive its full completion in the dear ſociety of my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved children? when ſhall I again fold them to my heart, and receive, in tears of heartfelt pleaſure, a compenſation for
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:1034200203:260"/>
thoſe of bitterneſs and miſery which have flowed with ſuch profuſion from my eyes? I will not however ſoften your feeling hearts into a haſty compliance with my wiſhes, which may not prove, juſt at this time, wholly convenient to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Mr. Howard. I will truſt to your affection to expedite your viſit as ſoon as you can, and till I enjoy the happineſs of ſeeing you, do not fear that I am either ſolitary or deſponding; no, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, be aſſured I am grateful, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented, and happy. I have at preſent the pleaſure of Sir William and my dear aunt's company, who will not leave me for ſome time. My doors are never ſhut againſt thoſe in my neighbourhood who favour me with their viſits, without exacting a ſcrupulous return; and my mind is at eaſe while I reſt aſſured of the love and attachment of thoſe clear and amiable children who are ſo entirely poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of mine.</p>

               <p>I WILL not anticipate, Sophia. But why is fortune ſo induſtrious in throwing accidents in my way which prove the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt exertion of my reſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="259" facs="tcp:1034200203:262"/>Yeſterday Miſs Patty Heathcote walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the morning, to inform us that a ſet of ſtroling players had lately ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived in the little village near us; that they had fitted up their theatre in a barn, where for ſome preceding evenings they had performed ſome of the beſt plays, much to the ſatisfaction, ſaid ſhe inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently, of <hi>very excellent judges</hi>; and that as neither ſhe nor her mother had ever ſeen a play, they would take it as a <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious favour indeed</hi> if Mr. and Mrs. Howard and I would do them the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to go and make a party with them.</p>
               <p>The little girl's eyes, while ſhe deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered this meſſage, ſparkled with an ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs which perſuaded Mr. Howard at once to agree to the meaſure, and made me really anxious for its ſucceſs; and Fanny, who with the ſedate character of a ſober married woman preſerves all the innocent eagerneſs of ſeventeen, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:1034200203:263"/>
ſo much delighted with any frolic, that ſhe was deſirous of going the inſtant it was propoſed.</p>
               <p>As the village is ſcarce a mile and an half diſtant, and it was bright moon light, it was agreed that the whole party ſhould walk to and from the theatre, concluding that the performance would not detain us very late; myſelf excepted, whom Mr. Howard inſiſted on carrying thither in his little equipage, as walking, after my late accident, might prove hurtful, my foot, though almoſt well, being ſtill weak. Miſs Patty ran full ſpeed down the hill, breathleſs with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation to equip herſelf for the play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, and to requeſt that her father and mother and all the children old enough to accompany them, would aſſemble at Hubert Hill to dinner, from whence we ſhould all ſet off together.</p>
               <p>The labours of the toilet are little known in the rural world; and Nature
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:1034200203:264"/>
has ſo laviſhly decked this happy inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent family with roſy cheeks, ſparkling eyes, and ſmiling countenances, that they are as unneceſſary as unknown. An hour after, we beheld the good par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and his wife aſcending the hill, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by five of their children; and no maſked ball or birth night aſſembly ever occaſioned more entertainment and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light than did this excurſion to our ruſtic theatre.</p>
               <p>We ſet off at half paſt four, for the children would not ceaſe teizing us till we were on foot; and having arrived a full hour too ſoon, took poſſeſſion of the front bench, which in this play houſe might be denominated the ſtage boxes, being the moſt convenient place in the barn for ſeeing the performance.</p>
               <p>We had not been long ſeated, before ſeveral gentlemen entered, the moſt of whom by their dreſs appeared to be officers. Miſs Patty informed me they
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:1034200203:265"/>
belonged to a company at preſent quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered in the village; but as the place was but indifferently lighted up it was not eaſy immediately to diſtinguiſh their faces.</p>
               <p>They had not engaged my attention above a few moments, when my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, Miſs Patty, aſked me in a whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per if I did not think that gentleman in the dark coloured coat, the handſomeſt young man I had ever ſeen; and turning to where ſhe pointed, I beheld Mr. Roatſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley leaning againſt one of the ſide ſcenes, engaged in converſation with ſome gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen.</p>
               <p>You may eaſily imagine I was in a tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor; and I had not an inſtant given me to compoſe or recollect myſelf, when I perceived Mr. Bradſhaw approach him, and gently pulling him by the arm, whiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſomething in his ear, which made him at once change colour and glance his eyes with eagerneſs around the houſe.
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:1034200203:266"/>
Captain Bradſhaw juſt then made me a reſpectful bow; and his friend taking the reference of his look, inſtantly followed his example, with an expreſſion in his countenance of ſatisfaction and delight which I fear almoſt conveyed equal plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure into mine. He came directly up to me, and paid me his compliments with a politeneſs not however unmixed with confuſion; while on my part, the recollection of Mrs. Hindon's letter, the obligation for which my avowed acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements were due, and the ſecret hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliating benefit I knew he had intended to beſtow, threw an awkwardneſs and conſtraint over my reception of him which I could not for ſome time either conquer or conceal.</p>
               <p>Happily Mr. Howard immediately joined us; and by addreſſing himſelf to Roatſley, gave me a momentary relief. Perceiving I ſeemed at a loſs, he partly comprehended the cauſe; and kindly
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:1034200203:267"/>
paved the way for my acknowledgments by entering at once on the ſubject. I did myſelf the pleaſure of writing to you, Mr. Roatſley, ſaid he, ſome time ago, but as I have not been favoured with an anſwer—</p>
               <p>I ſhould not have failed moſt certainly in ſeizing the earlieſt opportunity of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging any letter of your's, returned he, had I been conſcious of the favour; but I have been making a little excurſion of late, and having no fixed abode, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they knew not where to forward my letters, as I was ſo negligent as to leave no orders about them.</p>
               <p>Nay, Sir, had you really been guilty of any omiſſion, no apology was neceſſary to me: for I acted but as amanuenſis to my fair ſiſter: and my letter was only intended to expreſs her acknowledgments added to my own, for the polite attention with which you have intereſted yourſelf in her affairs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="265" facs="tcp:1034200203:268"/>A deep bluſh overſpread the counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Mr. Roatſley at this ſpeech, and an embarraſſment took poſſeſſion of his features little inferior to my own when I added, that he muſt have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded me extremely ungrateful to have ſo long deferred returning my very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere thanks, for an obligation which ſhould always induce me to conſider my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as particularly indebted to him.</p>
               <p>His confuſion was now augmented; and bowing, he ſtammered not a little while he repeated—what pleaſure he muſt receive—how delighted he muſt be—and how happy he ſhould think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be of the ſmalleſt ſervice to Miſs Seymour.</p>
               <p>He then turned to addreſs himſelf to Mr. Bradſhaw as if anxious to change the ſubject; and juſt at that inſtant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving my ſiſter, for whom he had not even enquired, he left me to pay his compliments to her; but ſoon returning,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:1034200203:269"/>
he entered immediately on a new topic, enquired how I had amuſed myſelf in the country during the winter, aſked if I could really leave town at that gay ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon without the ſlighteſt regret, and placed himſelf next me, where there happened fortunately to be a vacant ſeat. His l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>te confuſion now gave way to a gaiety and animation which convinced me that the ceremony of diſtant and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional meetings had not hitherto al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed of that eaſy intimacy between us which developes without conſtraint or diſguiſe the real temper of mind. My conſcious feelings had always thrown a reſerve over my own manner to Mr. Roatſley, which could not fail to affect his; but the unexpected ſatisfaction of this ſudden rencontre had given to both a flow of ſpirits that would not be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained, and which while it wholly ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Lady Elizabeth Sedley from my recollection preſented Roatſley in a point
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:1034200203:270"/>
of view entirely new and ſtill more inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating. I had before admired him as a character of real and unaſſuming dignity. The amiable ſoftneſs of his addreſs had charmed me; and all I ſaw, and all I heard of his diſpoſition, (however com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated at times by pique and diſpleaſure) had ſerved but to augment my eſteem. I had conſidered him as rather of a grave turn of mind: this evening however, the early part of it at leaſt, fully ſatisfied me of my error. He was not merely in good ſpirits, but lively and animated beyond meaſure, and his friend Captain Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, who joined us, and who really is a very agreeable young man, added to the gaiety and life of the party.</p>
               <p>The commencement of the play, which by the way was King Lear, put a period for a ſhort time to this general chat. But the performance was ſo miſerable, that it was impoſſible to pay attention to it, and Mr. Roatſley again addreſſed himſelf in
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:1034200203:271"/>
converſation to me. He ſoon recurred to my leaving town, and talked of it with the moſt flattering regret. I ſhall not do you the injuſtice to ſuppoſe, ſaid he, that poſſeſſing in yourſelf thoſe never failing reſources which give defiance to vapours and ennui, you could either en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure much regret on leaving the mere amuſements of the town, or ſuffer from vacancy or languor on returning to the country; but early in March, every thing around is ſo bleak, and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between one neighbour and another ſo often impeded by bad roads or bad weather, that a comfortable, agreeable ſociety, in which (after all our various ways of purſuing pleaſure), it muſt be confeſſed our firſt enjoyment conſiſts, is leſs practicable in the country than in town; beſides moſt people are of that opinion, and the country of courſe muſt have been quite deſerted when you arrived in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:1034200203:272"/>Yes, anſwered I; but when I retired to Hubert Hill I was ſo ſingularly ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as to carry along with me the only friends to whom, at leaſt in this part of the world, I can lay claim, and they were ſuch as muſt have enlivened and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deared the moſt diſmal and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpot.</p>
               <p>After ſuch a declaration, I muſt not preſume to enquire of whom this enviable party conſiſted.</p>
               <p>You ſafely may, ſaid I, ſince my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſiſter conſtituted the whole.</p>
               <p>And is your heart, Miſs Seymour, ſo entirely engroſſed by theſe friends, amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and deſerving as they are, that no place is left in it for the numbers who muſt have mourned your abſence.</p>
               <p>When I left London, ſaid I with a ſudden warmth, which the recollection of our forlorn ſituation forcibly excited, it contained not one human ſoul, who, had they been certain they ſhould have
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1034200203:273"/>
beheld me no more, would have endured one moment's regret.</p>
               <p>The idea was ſo melancholy, that a tear ſtarted into my eye, not I'm afraid unſeen by Roatſley, for he inſtantly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied—Ah! Miſs Seymour, that is wholly and utterly impoſſible. Thoſe who are formed by nature for charming their own ſex and enchanting our's, cannot fail of converting into friends and admirers all bleſt with the happineſs of their acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>This compliment, pronounced in a voice of mixed eagerneſe and ſoftneſs, could not fail to confuſe me: and unable to make a proper reply, or to diſclaim a compliment much too flattering even for acknowledgement, I could only reply with much heſitation—oh! Mr. Roatſley, how can you poſſibly imagine—beſides you know I am quite a ſtranger in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
               <p>Lovelineſs, continued he in the ſame
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:1034200203:274"/>
ſtrain, is an object too intereſting to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general to prove a ſtranger in any quarter of the globe. Where there are ſouls to feel its influence, it muſt be felt with force and energy irreſiſtible.</p>
               <p>To this an anſwer was ſtill more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible and I did not attempt it. Find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I was ſilent—I have the pleaſure of conſidering myſelf, ſaid he, after a pauſe, as your firſt Engliſh acquaintance. Will you not then allow me the inexpreſſible happineſs of a place in this envied liſt of your friends. Be aſſured I ſhall yield to none in the intereſt. I hold in your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.</p>
               <p>The warmth of his expreſſions, and ſtill more the eagerneſs of his counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, covered me with bluſhes, and I could only reply by a ſlight bow of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement. I took courage at length to add, that the obligations I owed him ſufficiently proved his claim to be conſidered in that light.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="272" facs="tcp:1034200203:275"/>This converſation naturally led him, with a gaiety that ſoon baniſhed my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious confuſion, to mention the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our firſt meeting, from which, by an eaſy tranſition, he proceeded to talk upon many intereſting topicks. In the courſe of this diſcourſe, I was not a little ſurprized to hear him mention Lord Belmont's name more than once with the moſt unconſcious ingenuouſneſs, and found myſelf ſtill more bewildered when I perceived he ſeemed even deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of drawing from me every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance relating to my ſituation abroad that he could contrive, without an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of impertinent curioſity, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain.</p>
               <p>Various were the particulars into which he had the addreſs, though with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt politeneſs, to penetrate. I was aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed and confounded by his behaviour, yet I ſtill remained convinced that his ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance was feigned: and while I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:1034200203:276"/>
ſimply and naturally to all his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries, pride made me diſdain to force him to an explanation, which muſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect his duplicity, and cover him with confuſion.</p>
               <p>At length—your accent is ſo little defective Miſs Seymour, ſaid he, that it is difficult for me to believe you never were in England till now.</p>
               <p>I left it when ſo very young, replied I, that I have not the moſt diſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection of ever having been in it.</p>
               <p>Having quitted it ſo very early, is equivalent to your never having been in it. But I always underſtood, Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, that France had had the honour of your birth.</p>
               <p>Aſtoniſhed, and entirely off my guard at this ſpeech, I involuntarily exclaimed —good heavens! Mr. Roatſley, how can you ſay ſo? Is it poſſible you can affect this ignorance.</p>
               <p>Ignorance! repeated he. Little as I
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:1034200203:277"/>
have had the happineſs of enjoying your company, and ſhort as has been the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of our acquaintance, it is not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizing that I ſhould be ignorant of this as well as of a thouſand other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances into which I have never had the preſumption to enquire, however anxious my deſire of information has been.</p>
               <p>Are you indeed ſerious, cried I; for inexplicable as it appeared, I now per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that all was as yet a ſecret to him.</p>
               <p>Never more ſo than at this moment. But why ſhould it aſtoniſh you ſo much? is it not the natural conſequence of—</p>
               <p>Becauſe, cried I, interrupting him, I have believed till this inſtant that you were as perfectly well informed of every circumſtance of my birth and education as the moſt intimate of my friends can <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e, or as I myſelf am.</p>
               <p>My ignorance, be aſſured, anſwered he, has reſulted neither from want of anxiety nor want of exertion to obtain
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:1034200203:278"/>
information; but ſimply that from your recent arrival in this country your circle of acquaintance was not extenſive, and none ſeemed more in the ſecret than myſelf. Miſs Seymour cannot ſuppoſe that where ſhe appeared ſhe could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main diſregarded and unnoticed. Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous were the accounts relating to her that reached my ears; but they were uniformly vague and unſatisfactory, and I am convinced void of foundation. Since however the fate of my enquiries ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to you ſo extraordinary, I hope you will not think my earneſt requeſt of an explanation too preſuming. Under the happy title juſt now granted me may I dare to venture on ſuch a demand?</p>
               <p>Amazement, ſatisfaction, and a variety of other emotions, at once ſo powerfully aſſailed me, that for a few moments I could not articulate; and grew ſo ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly pale, that Roatſley haſtily applied to Miſs Patty for her ſmelling bottle;
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:1034200203:279"/>
who, extremely frightened, was about to have alarmed my ſiſter, and the reſt of the party, had I not recollected myſelf, and aſſured her my indiſpoſition was ſlight and already gone off. To any other perſon my countenance might have diſcovered that my ſpirits were more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected than my health; but engroſſed with the novelty of the performance, which had now advanced to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſecond act, my young com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion had not given the ſlighteſt atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our converſation, and having been often told I ſuppoſe that fine ladies were vapouriſh and hyſterical, did not ſeem either ſuſpicious or ſurpriſed.</p>
               <p>Far otherwiſe were the concluſions of Mr. Roatſley. Shocked and confounded, he began to apprehend a myſtery, to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ravel which he had not received the ſlighteſt hint or aſſiſtance. I am in the agonies of the moſt painful ſuſpenſe, ſaid he after a pauſe: but ſince the ſubject is
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:1034200203:280"/>
ſo diſtreſſing, I am contented nay even eager to remain in ignorance.</p>
               <p>You ſhall be informed of every thing you may deſire to know, ſaid I, when I found myſelf a little recovered; but at preſent all explanation is impoſſible. A few words will not ſuffice; and even if they ſhould, I am incapable myſelf of entering on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>From whom then, will you allow me to expect it?</p>
               <p>From my brother, Mr. Howard. He will tell you all.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>All!</hi> repeated he, ſtill more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. The ſolemnity of the phraſe almoſt alarms me.</p>
               <p>The entrance of a large party of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen and ladies juſt at this inſtant cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated a noiſe and buſtle which carried our eyes to the door. Good God! ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Roatſley in a tone of vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and I inſtantly diſcovered Lady Marry Lawrance, her niece Lady Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:1034200203:281"/>
Miſs Dudley, and in ſhort the whole party at Holtenham, (Lady Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe and Miſs Lucy Dudley excepted) eſcorted by Sir Edward Sudbury and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other young men.</p>
               <p>As we had taken poſſeſſion of the front bench, ſeats for ſo many people occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned ſome confuſion. That on which we were placed could not contain above one half of the ladies, it being already more than half filled; and though the one behind was almoſt empty, having been purpoſely kept for the more faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the audience, they ſeemed to diſdain occupying it, and ſtood ſome time very civilly expreſſing their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment aloud with the expectation that our party would riſe and give them place.</p>
               <p>This act of politeneſs, however, we had no ſort of intention of performing. Indeed, for myſelf, the haughty pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of their behaviour would have
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:1034200203:282"/>
deterred me from taking any ſteps to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards their accommodation; but at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the unexpected appearance of Lady Elizabeth, who for an hour before had not once obtruded on my mind, now wholly baniſhed that pleaſing ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction and inward complacency which the knowledge that Roatſley had not yet deſerted us diffuſed over my feelings. I was ſunk and diſpirited, and not in the leaſt diſpoſed to be civil and attentive to any of this faſhionable ſet, Lady Mary excepted, who came up to my ſiſter, and addreſſed us with her uſual good breeding and affability.</p>
               <p>Miſs Dudley, a few minutes after ſhe entered, perceiving her brother, who had riſen to pay his reſpects to the ladies, immediately called out—Lord brother, when did you arrive in this part of the world?</p>
               <p>Only laſt night, returned he. I came to ſpend a few days with Bradſhaw at his
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:1034200203:283"/>
quarters, and he brought me hither for the purpoſe of encouraging theſe poor people. I did not expect to find ſo much good company, nor to meet with ſo many of my friends.</p>
               <p>Nay, anſwered ſhe, we never ſhould have thought of coming to this poor lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle place, which muſt be a ſad, ſtupid affair, but it ſeems the man who dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies himſelf with the title of manager prayed Lady Mary ſo hard to patronize them, that out of mere compaſſion ſhe beſpoke the play, and inſiſted we ſhould all attend her.</p>
               <p>Lady Elizabeth juſt then advancing, exclaimed in a tone of impatience loud enough to be heard all over the houſe— Lard, only think of theſe people having taken our places; and preſently per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving me—how do you do, Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour? cried ſhe with a careleſs air; and without waiting a reply, continued in my
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:1034200203:284"/>
hearing to expreſs her wonder, <hi>what the people could mean.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Her harangue was all at once inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the unexpected ſight of Mr. Roatſley, who came forward to pay her his compliments. I watched what ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect this ſudden meeting might produce in the countenances of both, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked that they mutually reddened ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely at the rencontre; but while Roatſley addreſſed himſelf to her with a reſpectful but diſtant air, her manner to him appeared to betray an over acted diſplay of dignity and reſerve. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered her little embarraſſment very ſpeedily however; for ſhe immediately recurred to her ſcornful expreſſions of ſurpriſe, and repeated her complaints to him, who politely offered her the place he had juſt quitted by me.</p>
               <p>No, cried ſhe careleſsly, I can't be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided from my party.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="282" facs="tcp:1034200203:285"/>Had your Ladyſhip engaged places? ſaid he.</p>
               <p>O Lord, no. How ſhould one think of ſuch a thing in ſuch a place as this. But when the people came to ſolicit us to go, they told us the firſt bench ſhould be reſerved for any people of faſhion who might take it into their heads to come, and behold all the parſons wives and daughters I believe in the county have aſſembled to take poſſeſſion of the only tolerable places in the barn.</p>
               <p>Roatſley looked by no means pleaſed at this rude ſpeech, which he knew I could not but overhear, and replied with quickneſs—But as your Ladyſhip can't ſuppoſe any of the ladies will give up their ſeats, I would adviſe you to accept of mine.</p>
               <p>Mr. Howard and the good Doctor having by this time riſen to accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the company, and placed ſome of the children behind, room was at length
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:1034200203:286"/>
made for them; and by this arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Roatſley was once more placed next me with Lady Elizabeth on his other hand.</p>
               <p>Her Ladyſhip choſe not to favour me with any further notice during the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the evening; and Miſs Dud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, who did not even afford me the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility of a diſtant bow, ſat with her eyes fixed on the ſpot where her brother was placed, whom ſhe examined with an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſuch ill humour and diſpleaſure, every time he addreſſed himſelf to me, that I felt beyond meaſure uneaſy.</p>
               <p>She had not the ſmalleſt reaſon, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to dread or even to ſuſpect any aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity on his part towards me; for his behaviour was now totally changed. He looked grave, thoughtful, and abſorbed. The little he ſaid was forced and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and his attentions were divided with the moſt ſcrupulous exactneſs equally between Lady Elizabeth and myſelf.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="284" facs="tcp:1034200203:287"/>Her admirer, or rather her attendant, Sir Edward, under pretence of avoiding to crowd her, inſiſted on relinquiſhing a place her Ladyſhip had procured him immediately behind her, and teized me not a little, (for it muſt be owned I was not in the beſt humour) by ſtanding at my ſide with his uſual ſolicitude, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering into converſation with me. I was leſs than ever in a mood for liſtening to him, particularly as I obſerved that Roatſley lent an attentive <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ar to all that paſſed between us; the purport of which conſiſted in much anxiety in regard to my accident, and at length in an explicit but diffident requeſt that I would allow him the honour of viſiting me at Hubert Hill, and would favour him with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to Mr. Howard, whom he ſaid he had never been ſo fortunate as to meet at Mrs. Hindon's.</p>
               <p>The recollection of his behaviour on a certain occaſion, rendered a refuſal, or
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:1034200203:288"/>
even an evaſion of this demand, impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, though the unbounded ſatisfaction he teſtified on my compliance, made me ſpeedily apprehend that I ought not to have conſented, and induced me to fear I had granted more than I deſigned by the introduction.</p>
               <p>He and Mr. Roatſley ſeemed inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted. Between the acts they joined each other, and continued in earneſt converſation; and from the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the one countenance and the too apparent exultation of the other, I could not avoid ſuſpecting that Sir Edward was confeſſing his ſanguine expectations to his friend. You ſmile at my vanity, Sophia; but the attentions of this young man are ſo pointed and undiſguiſed, that they attract univerſal obſervation where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I meet him; though my manner (uniformly as reſerved as good breeding will allow it to be) teſtifies as plainly as
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:1034200203:289"/>
words almoſt could do, how little I am gratified by his notice.</p>
               <p>Lady Elizabeth, deprived of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs of one admirer, and not much ſoothed by the cold politeneſs of another, laviſhed all her ſmiles, good humour, and condeſcenſion, upon a young man of a very ſingular appearance, who ſat on her left hand, and who ſeemed ſo entirely to atone for the neglect of the others, that I perceived her ſuppoſed partiality to Sir Edward was merely the indiſcriminate love of flattery and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Her preſent lover (for ſuch his aſſiduities evidently confeſſed him to be) I was informed poſſeſſed a ſplendid for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, and was of diſtinguiſhed rank, but his name I have forgot. He was dreſſed in the ſtile of a common groom or horſe jockey, and his hair, cut ſhort behind, hung about his ears with a negligence which betrayed not only diſreſpect for the company, but a total diſregard both
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:1034200203:290"/>
of cleanlineſs and propriety; yet an air of conſcious conſequence, and a very handſome figure, which he tried in vain to diſguiſe, betrayed his latent impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. He ſeemed poſſeſſed of exuber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant ſpirits; for his Lordſhip and Lady Elizabeth, by their talking and laughing, gave great offence and occaſioned much diſturbance to the ruſtic part of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, who were not ſo refined as to deſpiſe the performance, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary enjoyed it with all the reliſh of no<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>velty.</p>
               <p>The actors indeed were ſo miſerably bad, that the whole exhibition had infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more the appearance of the comic than of the Tragic Muſe; and attending to it was ſo little intereſting, and in my ſituation of mind ſo impoſſible, that I ought not to blame her Ladyſhip for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to draw amuſement from another channel, eſpecially as I myſelf followed her example moſt part of the
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:1034200203:291"/>
evening: but there was an unfeeling and unpardonable indelicacy in teſtifying with ſo little diſguiſe the ridicule which the poor people who were labouring for our amuſement excited, and the burſts of ungoverned laughter, and ſevere raillery, that reached their ears from this polite party, was a mortification in which I would not for worlds have joined. I had the ſatisfaction of perceiving that Roatſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley was equally ſhocked at their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour: and not only applauded wherever any particular expectation of approbation was betrayed, but engaged all the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen round him to drown, by every teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of ſatisfaction, the hiſſing with which Lady Elizabeth's gay admirer frequently aſſailed the performers.</p>
               <p>All particular converſation was at an end between Roatſley and me from the moment of Lady Elizabeth's appearance; and that which had preceded her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, by perplexing andengroſſing us,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:1034200203:292"/>
had mutually unfitted us for diſcourſing on thoſe little trifles that uſually preſent themſelves as topics of general diſcuſſion. He ſeemed ſo evidently oppreſſed with ſomething that lay uneaſily on his mind, that I could not poſſibly conclude mere curioſity to have excited an impreſſion ſo apparently unſurmountable; and ſoothed and gratified as I had been in the beginning of the evening, I ſoon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſuſpect that he regarded with pain and diſpleaſure the coquetry of Lady Elizabeth's behaviour. He often fixed his eyes upon her for ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments together with a look of ſcrutiny and inveſtigation, ſeemed to watch every word and movement that eſcaped her, and though he ſeldom addreſſed himſelf to her, to <hi>me</hi> he attended ſtill leſs. He appeared indeed wholly abſorbed by his own reflections; and ſcarce could I trace the ſame inſinuating manner, which but
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:1034200203:293"/>
one half hour before had delighted me ſo much.</p>
               <p>The pain of this obſervation, which ſtrehgthened every moment, convinced me I had been unconſciouſly deluding myſelf with falſe and chimerical hopes. If Lady Elizabeth was indifferent to him, why did her conduct ſo evidently affect and diſpleaſe him; if his chains were heavy and his heart unconcerned, her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent conduct was preciſely what he ought to have deſired and enjoyed; and if his eager profeſſions of regard and friendſhip for me were as warm and potent as I wiſhed them, whence came this ſudden languor and reſerve, when by an act of confidence I was about to give him a proof of my eſteem.</p>
               <p>There was but one way of ſolving theſe inconſiſtencies, and it was blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not to perceive it: involved in an engagement, with the ſplendid advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of which probably he was himſelf
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:1034200203:294"/>
dazzled, he had reſolved to purſue the path ſo anxiouſly pointed out to him by his family, while the folly and inſipidity of the object of his vows, without ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating ſo violently as to deter him from his purpoſe, ſhocked his feelings and opened his eyes to the dangers of fulfilling it.</p>
               <p>Theſe reflections only ſerved to ſhew me that redoubled exertions were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to fortify my mind againſt the weakneſs of my heart; and I began to form a ſecret plan of mental rigour which I flattered myſelf muſt in time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore the tranquillity I had loſt.</p>
               <p>Sufficient time was given me for theſe good reſolutions; for Sir Edward on the one hand had been called away by Mr. Bradſhaw, and Roatſley on the other preſerved his determined ſilence ſo reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, that I had no apprehenſion of any interruption. The return of the former, however, at length forced me to
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:1034200203:295"/>
give a conſtrained attention to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation; but finding that to affect a gaiety foreign to my feelings was beyond meaſure irkſome and inſupportable in my preſent frame of mind, yet conſcious I could not too ſoon drive from my thoughts a crowd of flattering retroſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which ſometimes for an inſtant baniſhed my deſpondency and occaſioned a new conflict, I endeavoured, as an eſcape both from Sir Edward and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, to lend an ear to the play, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic beauties of which not even the miſerable deficiencies of the performers could wholly obſcure.</p>
               <p>The player who appeared in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Gloſter, happened to be in fact blind; a circumſtance which, as his voice was good and his action much ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior to that of his companions, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him an intereſting and moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy object. In the fourth act, when the unexpected meeting between Gloſter
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:1034200203:296"/>
and his ſon takes place, the pathos and feeling with which the unhappy father exclaimed—
<q>
                     <l>—Oh dear ſon Edgar!</l>
                     <l>The food of thy abuſed father's wrath!</l>
                     <l>Might I but live to <hi>ſee</hi> thee in my <hi>touch</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>I'd ſay I had eyes again—</l>
                  </q>
affected me ſo poignantly, that I could not command my tears. In this how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I was not ſingular; for I perceived Roatſley equally ſoftened: nothing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed could be more mournful than the ſcene before us, nor could any ſound have appeared more inhuman than a loud and childiſh fit of laughter, which juſt at that inſtant burſt from Lady Elizabeth. Good heavens! cried ſhe to her admirer, if the people a'nt cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Nay that is too ridiculous indeed. Pray do look, Mr. Roatſley, turning to him—pray for God's ſake obſerve the tears; how ſoft and pretty all this is.</p>
               <p>He gave her no reply; but regarding
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:1034200203:297"/>
me for a moment, who on this occaſion was the particular object of her obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and ridicule, a ſigh eſcaped him that ſeemed to be vented from the heart, and he again ſet himſelf to liſten to the play with the anxiety of a perſon who wiſhed to avoid all interruption.</p>
               <p>When all was concluded, Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw came up and enquired how I had been entertained. The performance on the whole, ſaid he, was ſuch as might have been expected, but that little ſtroke of Gloſter's was truly pathetic.</p>
               <p>Lady Elizabeth, who did not diſtinctly hear what he ſaid, choſe to join in the converſation though ſhe continued to preſerve towards me the ſame contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous diſregard, and demanded of what he was talking?</p>
               <p>I was mentioning to Miſs Seymour, cried he, the circumſtance, of the poor fellow who played Gloſter.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:1034200203:298"/>Oh yes! cried ſhe, inconſiderately, I never laughed ſo much in my life.</p>
               <p>It is an excellent jeſt to the poor blind devil, returned he ſarcaſtically, to be deprived of ſight; and being conſtrained in that diſmal ſtate to make ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions for ſubſiſtence is a ſtill better one.</p>
               <p>Lord I don't mean ſo, for that cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly muſt be quite dreadful to be ſure; only I was vaſtly amuſed ſeeing the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple pretend to cry, when undoubtedly the whole affair was more like a farce than any thing elſe.</p>
               <p>There is Roatſley, returned Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, who appears as much dejected as if he had been weeping the tender woes of Belvidera when performed by the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitable Mrs. Siddons, and Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour too looks not only as if ſhe had been crying, but as if ſhe could cry for an hour to come.</p>
               <p>I merely look as if I was fatigued and half aſleep, cried I.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:1034200203:299"/>How unfortunate muſt I be in my choice of topics, anſwered he with a ſmile; for twice have I endured the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of learning from Miſs Sey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour's lips that I had ſet her aſleep. Pray are <hi>you</hi> half aſleep too, cried he, turning to Roatſley, are <hi>you</hi> infected with Miſs Seymour's lethargic diſorder. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed if I may be allowed (lowering his voice) to judge from appearances, I ſhould pronounce you affected with ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar ſymptoms.</p>
               <p>This ſpeech, pronounced with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the moſt cruel archneſs, and of which I did not loſe a ſyllable, hurt me ſeverely. The moſt painful confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion dyed my cheeks, and I had not cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage for ſome moments to look up, leſt I ſhould encounter the eyes of Roatſley; but I believe he was equally confounded and embarraſſed, for he made no anſwer, and a ſhort ſilence ſucceeded, which was beyond meaſure awkward and diſtreſſing.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="297" facs="tcp:1034200203:300"/>This was ſoon interrupted by Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, who appeared rather to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed than regretted the mutual confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he had occaſioned. Miſs Seymour, cried he, I was extremely ſorry I was obliged to leave Holtenham without having the happineſs of again ſeeing you. I wiſhed much to enquire how you had reſted, and longed particularly to know of you if you had diſcovered the ſolution of the enigma I gave you to unriddle.</p>
               <p>I have even forgot that you gave me any enigma to ſolve, ſaid I; and as I raiſed my eyes to anſwer him with as much indifference as I could aſſume, I perceived Roatſley's eyes were fixed on my face with an expreſſion of earneſt penetration that wholly diſconcerted me; happily, however, my ſiſter, from whom by the accidental change of places I had been ſeparated juſt then joined us; and ſome previous conſultation in regard
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:1034200203:301"/>
to our mode of departure relieved me from further perſecution.</p>
               <p>The evening, though a little cool, was pleaſant, and walking, had I been able for it, was the method of travelling I ſhould have preferred; but my ſiſter, who in her rural ſituation retains the embers of latent vanity, was much pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked by the contempt and haughty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolence with which our humble party had been treated by the proud train from Holtenham, and was not a little morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at the idea of being obliged to find her way through a crowd of powdered footmen and magnificent equipages to go home on foot with the parſon and his wife; while this faſhionable company were leaving the ruſtic theatre with as much eclat and parade as had attended their entrance, followed by all the gay male part of the audience. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore determined to remain till the laſt, and whiſperingly informed me of the
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:1034200203:302"/>
reaſon; though Mr. Howard and the good Doctor, who were far from ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting this plan, urged her to be gone, as it began to grow late and there was no apparent reaſon for delay.</p>
               <p>Poor Fanny, aſhamed to confeſs this ſpark of ſecret pride, which would have appeared wholly incomprehenſible to the one and perhaps rather abſurd to the other, was put to great difficulties in order to compleat her project; but ſhe was reſolved to ſave herſelf this little humiliation if poſſible. Mrs. Heath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cote's care for herſelf and children, gave her likewiſe much pain. The good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man wrapt them all carefully up in large thick cloaks and handkerchiefs brought for the purpoſe, till they exactly reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled Ruſſian boors in the prints of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers; and beſought Fanny in a voice loud enough to be heard all over the houſe, to make herſelf warm, for <hi>walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing home</hi> in the <hi>night air</hi> was extremely
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:1034200203:303"/>
apt to give people colds; and indeed Mrs. Howard, though this cloak is old and a little worn out, it is thick and comfortable, and I wiſh you would allow me to wrap it round you.</p>
               <p>All this was the more ſevere on poor Fanny's irritable feelings, as Lady Mary's carriage, which had occaſioned her ſome little delay, juſt then being announced, her Ladyſhip in paſſing ſtopped to bid her good night; and Lady Elizabeth following, eſcorted by her gay admirer, looked with a ſmile of ridicule but half ſuppreſſed, at the appearance of our companions.</p>
               <p>Roatſley, who had been called away by his ſiſter, had returned but a moment before; but perceiving Lady Mary un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attended, again left me to conduct her to her carriage, having firſt beſought the honour of ſeeing me to mine, and requeſted that I would not depart till his return. This circumſtance rendered me
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:1034200203:304"/>
fully as anxious as my ſiſter to delay our going, while I was no leſs aſhamed to acknowledge the cauſe.</p>
               <p>My dear, cried Mr. Howard to Fanny on coming up to us, for heavens ſake let us be gone. We ſhall loſe the advantage of the moon if we are not directly on foot. It is already on its decline.</p>
               <p>I was ſilent; and ſhe only replied by ſaying we ſhould go preſently.</p>
               <p>Unconſcious of our ſecret views, he could only attribute to a childiſh deſire of outſtaying the company, our unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingneſs to depart, and inſiſted on ſetting off immediately with me, leaving his wife under the care of the good parſon, with whoſe family ſhe was to walk home.</p>
               <p>My ſiſter, much pleaſed with this plan, which left her motions in her own power, urged me to go; and ſevere as it was to leave the houſe before Roatſley's return, before we had finally adjuſted at what time and in what place he was to
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:1034200203:305"/>
receive the communication ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired, I was abſolutely conſtrained to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Sir Edward to lead me to the little carriage. Had I been perfectly uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of any ſecret intereſt beyond that anxiety which I felt in common with my ſiſter to be on terms of intimacy with a relation ſo amiable, I ſhould undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have acquainted Mr. Howard with my wiſh to remain, and acknowledged the cauſe; but the particulars were too long for immediate diſcuſſion at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and on that ſpot, where Sir Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward never for an inſtant left my ſide: afraid therefore to diſcover an eagerneſs too keen, eſpecially before Mr. Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhaw, of whoſe animadverſions I was extremely apprehenſive, I permitted Mr. Howard in ſilence to place himſelf by me and we drove off.</p>
               <p>On ſtepping in, I perceived by the glare of the flambeaux Roatſley in earneſt converſation with Lady Elizabeth at the
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:1034200203:306"/>
window of Lady Mary's carriage, and he ſtill ſtood in the ſame place when I loſt ſight of him.</p>
               <p>When we got home, Fanny being longer in making her appearance than we expected, Mr. Howard grew at length uneaſy, and went himſelf to ſee after the walking party. Finding myſelf alone, I threw myſelf on a chair, and giving way to a train of reflexions which alternately ſoothed and tormented me, I indulged unconſciouſly in a fit of muſing which ſoftened rather than relieved me.</p>
               <p>But I haſtily conclude this letter, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an immediate opportunity of ſending it to my Sophia.</p>
