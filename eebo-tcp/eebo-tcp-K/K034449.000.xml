            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The amiable delicacy of your temper, and your quick ſenſibility, only ſerve to make you unhappy.—To clear up this affair properly to Mr. Sterling, is the continual employment of my thoughts. Every thing now is in a fair train. It begins to grow ripe for a diſcovery; and I have no doubt of its concluding to the ſatisfaction of ourſelves, of your father, and the whole family.</p>

                  <p>But if they are made acquainted with it otherwiſe than by ourſelves, it will be ten times worſe: and a diſcovery grows every day more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable.

                  <p>Well—well—I meant to diſcover it ſoon, but would not do it too precipitately.—I have more than once ſounded Mr. Sterling about it, and will attempt him more ſeriouſly the next opportunity. But my principal hopes are theſe.—My relationſhip

                  <p>Oh, it gives me no manner of uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. But, indeed, Ma'am, I cannot be perſuaded but that Sir John is an extremely cold lover.

                  <p>Great improvements indeed, Mr. Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling! wonderful improvements! The four ſeaſons in lead, the flying Mercury, and the baſin with Neptune in the middle, are all in the very extreme of fine taſte. You have as many rich figures as the man at Hyde-Park Corner.</p>

                  <p>The chief pleaſure of a country houſe is to make improvements, you know, my Lord. I ſpare no expence, not I.—This is quite another-gueſs ſort of a place than it was when I firſt took it, my Lord. We were ſurrounded with trees. I cut down above fifty to make the lawn before the houſe, and let in the wind and the ſun—ſmack-ſmooth—as you ſee.—Then I made a green-houſe out of the old laundry,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0163801100:33"/>
and turned the brew houſe into a pinery.—The high octagon ſummer-houſe, you ſee yonder, is raiſed on the maſt of a ſhip, given me by an Eaſt-India cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, who has turned many a thouſand of my money. It commands the whole road. All the coaches and chariots, and chaiſes, paſs and repaſs under your eye. I'll mount you up there in the afternoon, my Lord. 'Tis the pleaſanteſt place in the world to take a pipe and a bottle,—and ſo you ſhall ſay, my Lord.</p>

                  <p>Nay, but prithee be ſerious, and think better of it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>I have thought better of it already, you ſee. Tell me honeſtly, Lovewell! Can you blame me? Is there any compariſon between them?</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>As to that now—why that—that is juſt—juſt as it may ſtrike different people. There are many admirers of Miſs Sterling's vivacity.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>Vivacity! a medley of Cheapſide pert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Whitechapel pride.—No—no—if I do go ſo far into the city for a wedding-dinner, it ſhall be upon turtle at leaſt.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Lovew.</speaker>
                  <p>But I ſee no probability of ſucceſs; for granting that Mr. Sterling wou'd have conſented to it at firſt, he cannot liſten to it now. Why did not you break this affair to the family before?</p>

                  <p>Under ſuch embarraſſed circumſtances as I have been, can you wonder at my irreſolution or perplexity? Nothing but deſpair, the fear of loſing my dear Fanny, cou'd bring me to a declaration
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0163801100:38"/>
even now: and yet, I think I know Mr. Sterling ſo well, that, ſtrange as my propoſal may appear, if I can make it advantageous to him as a money-tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action, as I am ſure I can, he will certainly come into it.</p>

                  <p>Why, faith, to ſay the truth, ſhe was a little ſurpriſed—and ſhe got away from me too, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cou'd thoroughly explain myſelf. If I ſhould not meet with an opportunity of ſpeaking to her, I muſt get you to deliver a letter from me.</p>

Conſider, Madam, that the future happineſs of my life depends on my preſent application to you! conſider that this day muſt determine my fate; and theſe are perhaps the only moments left me to incline you to warrant my paſſion, and to intreat you not to oppoſe the propoſals I mean to open to your father.</p>

                  <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
                  <p>For ſhame, for ſhame, Sir John! Think of your previous engagements! Think of your own ſituation, and think of mine!—What have you diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered in my conduct that might encourage you to ſo bold a declaration? I am ſhocked that you ſhould venture to ſay ſo much, and bluſh that I ſhould even dare to give it a hearing.—Let me be gone!</p>

                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>Nay, ſtay, Madam! but one moment!—Your ſenſibility is too great.—Engagements! what engagements have even been pretended on either ſide than thoſe of family-convenience? I went on in the trammels of matrimonial negotiation with a blind ſubmiſſion to your father and Lord Ogleby; but my heart ſoon claimed a right to be conſulted. It has devoted itſelf to you, and obliges me to plead earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for the ſame tender intereſt in your's.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>Have a care, Sir John! do not miſtake a depraved will for a virtuous inclination. By theſe common pretences of the heart, half of our ſex are made fools, and a greater part of yours deſpiſe them for it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>Affection, you will allow, is involuntary. We cannot always direct it to the object on which it ſhould fix—But when it is once inviolably attached, inviolably as mine is to you, it often creates recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal affection.—When I laſt urged you on this ſubject, you heard me with more temper, and I hoped with ſome compaſſion.</p>

                  <p>Who has obtained the moſt abſolute dominion over my heart. I have already declared my paſſion to her; nay, Miſs Sterling herſelf is alſo apprized of it, and if you will but give a ſanction to my preſent addreſſes, the uncommon merit of Miſs Sterling will no doubt recommend her to a perſon of equal, if not ſuperior rank to myſelf, and our families may ſtill be allied by my union with Miſs Fanny.</p>

                  <p>Mighty fine, truly! Why, what the plague do you make of us, Sir John? Do you come to market for my daughters, like ſervants at a ſtatute-fair? Do you think that I will ſuffer you, or any man in the world, to come into my houſe, like the

                  <p>A moment's patience, Sir! Nothing but the exceſs of my paſſion for Miſs Fanny ſhou'd have induced me to take any ſtep that had the leaſt appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of diſreſpect to any part of your family; and even now I am deſirous to atone for my tranſgreſſion, by making the moſt adequate compenſation that lies in my power.</p>

                  <speaker>Sterl.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>Come, come, Mr. Sterling; I know you to be a man of ſenſe, a man of buſineſs, a man of the world. I'll deal frankly with you; and you ſhall ſee that I do not deſire a change of meaſures for my own gratification, without endeavouring to make it advantageous to you.</p>

                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope not, Sir; as on my part, I will agree to wave my right to thirty thouſand pounds of the fortune I was to receive with her.</p>

                  <speaker>Sterl.</speaker>
                  <p>Why,—why,—there may be ſomething in that.—Let me ſee; Fanny with fifty thouſand inſtead of Betſey with fourſcore—But how can this be, Sir John?—For you know I am to pay this money into the hands of my Lord Ogleby; who, I believe—between you and me, Sir John,—is not overſtocked with ready money at preſent; and threeſcore thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of it, you know, is to go to pay off the preſent incumbrances on the eſtate, Sir John.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>That objection is eaſily obviated.—Ten of the twenty thouſand, which would remain as a ſurplus of the fourſcore, after paying off the mort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, was intended by his Lordſhip for my uſe, that we might ſet off with ſome little <hi>eclat</hi> on our marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age; and the other ten for his own.—Ten thouſand pounds therefore I ſhall be able to pay you imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately; and for the remaining twenty thouſand you ſhall have a mortgage on that part of the eſtate which is to be made over to me, with whatever ſecurity you ſhall require for the regular payment of the intereſt, 'till the principal is duly diſcharged.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sterl.</speaker>
                  <p>Why—to do you juſtice, Sir John, there is ſomething fair and open in your propoſal; and ſince I find you do not mean to put an affront upon the family—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>Nothing was ever farther from my thoughts, Mr. Sterling.—And after all, the whole affair is nothing extraordinary—ſuch things happen every day—and as the world has only heard generally of a treaty between the families, when this marriage takes place, nobody will be the wiſer, if we have but diſcretion enough to keep our own counſel.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>True, true; and ſince you only transfer from one girl to the other, it is no more than transferring ſo much ſtock, you know.</p>

No.—After you have ſettled the largeſt part of your property on your youngeſt daughter, can there be an equal portion left for the eldeſt? No.—Does not this overturn the whole ſyſtum of the fammaly? Yes, yes, yes. You know I was always for my niece Betſey's marrying a perſon of the very firſt quallaty. That was my maxum. And, therefore, much the largeſt ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was of courſe to be made upon her.—As for Fanny, if ſhe could, with a fortune of twenty or thirty thouſand pounds, get a knight, or a member of parliament, or a rich common-council-man for a huſband, I thought it might do very well.</p>

                  <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, Sir, it is impoſſible to conceive the tortures I have already endured in conſequence of my diſobedience. My heart has continually upbraided me for it; and though I was too weak to ſtruggle with affection, I feel that I muſt be miſerable for ever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your forgiveneſs.</p>

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0163801100:94"/>
miſtakes, which we had all better forget for our own ſakes; and the beſt way to forget them is to forgive the cauſe of them; which I do from my ſoul.—Poor girl! I ſwore to ſupport her affection with my life and fortune;—'tis a debt of honour, and muſt be paid—you ſwore as much too, Mr. Sterling; but your laws in the city will excuſe <hi>you,</hi> I ſuppoſe; for you never ſtrike a ballance without errors excepted.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sterl.</speaker>
                  <p>I am a father, my Lord; but for the ſake of all other fathers, I think I ought not to forgive her, for fear of encouraging other ſilly girls like herſelf to throw themſelves away without the conſent of their parents.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lovew.</speaker>
                  <p>I hope there will be no danger of that, Sir. Young ladies with minds, like my Fanny's, would ſtartle at the very ſhadow of vice; and when they know to what uneaſineſs only an indiſcretion has expoſed her, her example, inſtead, of encouraging, will rather ſerve to deter them.</p>

                  <speaker>Lord Ogle.</speaker>
                  <p>For my part, I indulge my own paſſions too much to tyrannize over thoſe of other people. Poor ſouls, I pity them. And you muſt forgive them too. Come, come, melt a little of your flint, Mr. Sterling!</p>

                  <p>Well—ſo do I then.—Nay, no thanks— <stage>[to Lovewell and Fanny, who ſeem preparing to ſpeak]</stage> there's an end of the matter.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Lord Ogle.</speaker>
                  <p>But, Lovewell, what makes you dumb all this while?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Lovew.</speaker>
                  <p>Your kindneſs, my Lord—I can ſcarce believe my own ſenſes—they are all in a tumult of fear, joy, love, expectation, and gratitude; I ever was, and am now more bound in duty to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0163801100:95"/>
for you, Mr. Sterling, if every moment of my life, ſpent gratefully in your ſervice, will in ſome meaſure compenſate the want of fortune, you perhaps will not repent your goodneſs to me. And you, ladies, I flatter myſelf, will not for the future ſuſpect me of artifice and intrigue—I ſhall be happy to oblige, and ſerve you.—As for you, Sir John—</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sir John.</speaker>
                  <p>No apologies to me, Lovewell, I do not deſerve any. All I have to offer in excuſe for what has happened, is my total ignorance of your ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Had you dealt a little more openly with me, you would have ſaved me, and yourſelf, and that lady, (who I hope will pardon my behaviour) a great deal of uneaſineſs. Give me leave, however, to aſſure you, that light and capricious as I may have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, now my infatuation is over, I have ſenſibility enough to be aſhamed of the part I have acted, and honour enough to rejoice at your happineſs.</p>
