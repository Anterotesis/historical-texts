            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>It is a frequent Complaint, that Tar-Water is
made of bad Tar, being of a reddiſh Colour, ſweetiſh
or diſagreeably inſipid. But though the Dregs of
Tar are often foul, and make foul Tar-Water, and
though Tar already uſed is often made uſe of by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair
Dealers a ſecond, if not a third Time, which
produceth a vile Potion, void of the genuine Flavour
and Virtue of Tar-Water. Yet I apprehend theſe
Defects may ſometimes be aſcribed, rather to the
Veſſel wherein the Tar-Water is made, than to the
Tar itſelf.</p>
                  <p>Tar-Water being made in an earthen Veſſel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glazed,
or that hath loſt Part of its Glazing, may
extract (as it is a ſtrong Menſtruum) from the Clay,
a fade Sweetiſhneſs, offenſive to the Palate. It ſhould
ſeem therefore that the beſt Way of making Tar-Water
is in a Stone Jug, or earthen Veſſel through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0374600900:9"/>
well glazed, and, as it will not fail to extract a
Tincture from any metallic Veſſel, it ſhould be
warmed in a well glazed Pipkin, rather than a
Sauce-pan.</p>
                  <p>By increaſing the Proportion of Tar to the Water,
and by ſtirring it longer, Tar-Water may be made
ſtrong enough for a Spoonful to impregnate a large
Glaſs, a Thing very uſeful on a Road.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who in chronical Diſorders, or as a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervative,
have for a long time drunk Tar-Water,
muſt in acute Caſes drink the more.</p>
                  <p>Tar-Water muſt be drunk warm in Agues, Small-pox,
Meaſles and Fevers, in Colics and Diſorders
of the Bowels, in Gout alſo, and Rheumatiſm, in
moſt other Ailments cold or warm, at the Choice of
the Patient.</p>
                  <p>In Fevers the Patient cannot begin too ſoon, or
drink too much. By undoubted Experience it is
found to cool the hot, and warm the cold, and to be
a moſt ſucceſsful Medicine in Fevers, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
its great Virtue in Palſies and Dropſies.</p>
                  <p>When not long ſince an Inflammation attacked
the Throat, Breaſt, and Lungs of Children, and
became general in my Neighbourhood, Numbers
were recovered by the Uſe of Tar-Water, nor did
I hear that any miſcarried who uſed it, though many
periſhed who did not.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it a Medicine leſs proper and efficacious in
old Age. At the ſame time that this inflammatory
Diſtemper raged among the Children, a Woman in
her ſixty-eighth Year, from violent Cold was ſeized
at once with Ague, Colic, and Jaundice, of all
which Maladies ſhe was cured in a Fortnight, by
drinking three Pints of warm Tar-water every Day.
Numberleſs ſuch Inſtances daily occur, which ſhew
it to be a ſafe and efficacious Medicine both for old
and young.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0374600900:10"/>
Evacuations by Sweat, which uſually render Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
very weak and diſpirited, have not the ſame
bad Effects when produced by Tar-Water, which
I have frequently known to give high Spirits in all
the Stages of a Fever, and under the loweſt Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
therefore old People and weak Perſons, who
cannot well bear common Evacuations, are beſt
cured by Tar-Water, which in ſome Sort ſeemeth
to renew thoſe who are worn out with Age and
Infirmities.</p>
                  <p>Tar-Water is of ſingular Uſe in ſtrengthening the
Stomach and Bowels, and agrees particularly well
with Infants, taken either by themſelves or by the
Nurſe, and beſt by both. Though as it throws the
ill Humours out into the Surface of the Skin, it
may render them for a Time, perhaps, unſeemly
with Eruptions, but withal healthy and lively. And
I will venture to ſay, that it lays in them the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples
of a good Conſtitution for the reſt of their
Lives.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it only uſeful to the Bodies of Infants, it
hath alſo a good Effect on their Minds, as thoſe who
drink it are obſerved to be remarkably forward and
ſprightly. Even the moſt heavy, lumpiſh, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſing
Infants, appear to be much improved
by it. A Child there is in my Neighbourhood, of
fine Parts, who at firſt ſeemed ſtupid and an Idiot,
but, by conſtant Uſe of Tar-Water, grew lively
and obſerving, and is now noted for Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
beyond others of the ſame Age.</p>
                  <p>Infants are eaſily brought to take it by Spoon, and
even grow to a Liking of it, and as their Diſorders
ariſe chiefly from Indigeſtion, they receive the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
Benefit from a Medicine ſo well calculated to
ſtrengthen the Inteſtines, and preſerve them from
Fits. In a word, if it were the common Practice
to accuſtom Infants from the Beginning to take Tar-Water,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0374600900:11"/>
this would greatly conduce to the Health
both of their Minds and Bodies. There is, I am
verily perſuaded, no one Thing in the power of
Art or Nature, that would ſo generally and effectually
contribute to repair the Conſtitutions of our Gentry
and Nobility, by ſtrengthning the Children, and
caſting off in their Infancy thoſe Impurities and
Taints, which they often bring into the World.</p>
                  <p>An Infant may take one Quarter of a Pint in the
Day, warm, by Spoonfuls; leſs may do good, and
there is no fear of Exceſs. When I conſider the
private Woe of Families, as well as the public
Loſs occaſioned by the Death of ſuch an incredible
Number of Infants, under two Years of Age, I
cannot but inſiſt on recommending Tar-Water, both
as a Remedy and Preſervative in that tender Age,
which cannot bear the common Treatment and
Methods of Phyſic, or with ſafety take thoſe Drugs
which are fitter for grown Perſons.</p>
                  <p>Another Reaſon which recommends Tar-Water,
particularly to Infants and Children, is the great
Security it brings againſt the Small-pox, to thoſe
that drink it, who are obſerved, either never to
take that Diſtemper, or to have it in the gentleſt
Manner.</p>
                  <p>There is no Diſtemper more contagious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive
than the Small-pox, or more generally
dreaded, attended with worſe Symptoms, or that
leaves behind it worſe Effects; I obſerve at the
ſame time, that Tar-Water is in no other Caſe a
more ſafe and ſure Remedy than in this; of which
Captain <hi>Drape</hi>'s Certificate, ſworn to before the
Mayor of <hi>Liverpool,</hi> in the preſence of ſeveral
principal Perſons of that Town, is a moſt evident
Proof.</p>
                  <p>That one hundred and ſeventy Perſons, ſeized at
once with the Small-pox, deprived of all Conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0374600900:12"/>
and in the worſt Circumſtances of a nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Ship and hot Climate, ſhould all recover by
the ſingle Medicine of Tar-Water, except one who
would not drink it, is a matter of Fact, ſo plain
and convincing, and ſo well atteſted, as to leave no
Doubt in Minds free from Prepoſſeſſion, about the
Uſefulneſs and Efficacy of Tar-Water in the Small-pox;
a Point I had been before ſufficiently convinced
of, by many Inſtances in my own Neighbourhood.</p>
                  <p>It hath been ſurmiſed by ſome celebrated Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
that one Day a Specific may be diſcovered
for the peculiar Venom of the Small-pox. There
ſeems to be ſome Reaſon for thinking that Tar-Water
is ſuch a Specific. I ſay this on good Grounds,
having by many Experiments obſerved its Virtue
in curing, as well as in preventing, that cruel Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper;
during the whole Courſe of which, it is to
be drank warm; a moderate Glaſs (about Half a
Pint) every Hour, in common Caſes, may ſuffice,
in bad Caſes more may be given; there is no Fear
of Exceſs.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who endeavour to diſcredit this cooling
Cordial, and ſalutary Medicine, as an Inflamer of
the Blood, do very conſiſtently decry its Uſe in the
Small-pox; but there can be nothing more clear,
full, and ſatisfactory than Captain <hi>Drape</hi>'s Affida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit,
to convince reaſonable People of the great and
ſurpriſing Efficacy of Tar-Water, in the Cure of
the Small-pox; and conſequently of the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs
of that Report, which aſcribes a heating or
inflaming Quality to it. And yet that groundleſs
Report hath hindred many from reaping the Benefit
they might otherwiſe have done, from the Uſe of
this Water, which is of excellent Virtue in all kinds
of inflammatory Diſorders, Fevers, Quinſies, Pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies,
and ſuch like of the hot and inflamed Kind,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0374600900:13"/>
whereof the Public as well as myſelf have known a
Multitude of Examples.</p>
                  <p>I ask whether the Fact ſworn before the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates
of <hi>Liverpool,</hi> be not a ſufficient Anſwer to
all that is objected, from an inflaming Quality, to
Tar-Water. Can any Inſtance be produced in the
whole <hi>Materia Medica,</hi> or Hiſtory of Phyſic, of
the Virtue of a Medicine tried on greater Numbers,
or under greater Diſadvantages, or with greater
Succeſs, or more credibly atteſted. I wiſh for
the common Good of Mankind, that the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment
was tried in our Hoſpitals. Probably
the World would ſoon be relieved from that great
and general Terror of the Small-pox.</p>
                  <p>When I hear of the Devaſtations made by this
Diſtemper, in great Cities and populous Towns,
how many Lives are loſt, or (as may be ſaid) thrown
away, which might have been in all likelihood eaſily
preſerved, by the Uſe of a Medicine, ſo cheap and
obvious, and in eyery one's power, it ſeems Matter
of great Concern and Aſtoniſhment, and leaves one
at a loſs to gueſs at the Motives, that govern hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Actions in Affairs of the greateſt moment.
The Experiment may be eaſily made, if an equal
Number of poor Patients in the Small-pox, were put
into two Hoſpitals at the ſame Time of the Year,
and provided with the ſame Neceſſaries of Diet and
Lodging, and, for further Care, let the one have a
Tub of Tar-Water and an old Woman; the other
Hoſpital, what Attendance and Drugs you pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>In all obſtinate Sores and Ulcers, I very much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
the drinking of Tar-Water, and waſhing
them with a ſtrong Lotion of it, will haſten the
Cure.</p>
                  <p>One of the moſt painful and dangerous Caſes is
that of a Woman's fore Breaſt. How many poor
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0374600900:14"/>
Creatures after long languiſhing in Miſery, are
obliged to ſuffer the moſt ſevere chirurgical Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
often the cutting off the entire Breaſt? The
Uſe of Tar-Water in thoſe Caſes hath been attended
with ſuch Succeſs, that I do earneſtly recommend
the drinking thereof, both as a Cure and Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
as a moſt effectual Medicine to remove the
ſhooting Pains that precede a Cancer, and alſo to
cure the Cancer itſelf, without Amputation. Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerous
and ſore Breaſts are ſuch cruel Caſes, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
by ſo many internal Cauſes, as well as out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Accidents, that it is a neceſſary Piece of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity,
to contribute all we can to the Prevention
and Cure thereof.</p>
                  <p>In the King's Evil, Leproſy, and fouleſt Caſes,
Tar-Water cannot be too much recommended. The
poor Vagabonds of <hi>Ireland,</hi> are many of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
and eaten up with the foul Diſeaſe, which
with them paſſeth for a Canker, as they call it.
Several Inſtances of extraordinary Cures have been
performed on ſuch Perſons, by drinking Tar-Water
copiouſly, for ſome Weeks or Months together,
without Confinement or other Reſtraint, than that
of a regular cool Diet. It is indeed a Specific, both
for this and all other Taints and Impurities of the
Blood.</p>
                  <p>An Extract of <hi>Siris</hi> was made, and Accounts of
the Effects of Tar-Water were reprinted in <hi>America,</hi>
in which Continent, as well as in the Iſlands, much
Uſe hath been made thereof, particularly by thoſe
who poſſeſs great Numbers of Slaves: Of this I have
been informed by Letters, and by Word of Mouth,
from Perſons belonging to thoſe Parts, who have
aſſured me of the extenſive and ſucceſsful Uſe of
this Medicine in many Caſes, and more eſpecially
in the moſt inveterate Kinds of the ſoul Diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0374600900:15"/>
I need not ſay how dearly they purchaſe Health
who obtain it by Salivation, and yet long and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
as that Courſe is, it is often unſucceſsful. There
are Inſtances of ſuch as having paſſed through it
with much Miſery and Patience, have been after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
cured by the ſimple Uſe of Tar-Water.</p>
                  <p>The King's Evil, ſo lothſom in its Symptoms
and Effects, and withal ſo difficult, if at all poſſible,
to cure by any other Method, is moſt ſurely and
eaſily cured by the Tar-Water, even when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
is far gone, even when he derives it from his
Anceſtors. A Quart <hi>per diem</hi> for a few Months,
I have known to cure the moſt deplorable and
abandoned Caſes.</p>
                  <p>How many wealthy Families, otherwiſe at their
Eaſe, are corrupted with this Taint in their Blood?
How many want Heirs and Husbands, through this
odious Malady? A Specific for this Diſeaſe alone,
would be juſtly eſteemed a moſt valuable Secret, and
the plenty and cheapneſs of the Medicine ought not
in Reaſon to make it leſs eſteemed.</p>
                  <p>Salivating, Bleeding, and Purging, are attended
with great Hardſhips and Inconveniencies (even
where the Patient recovers) reducing the Strength
and Spirits of thoſe who uſe them, whereas Tar-Water
greatly adds to both.</p>
                  <p>In Fractures and Wounds, a Quart or two drank
daily, while the Patient is under Cure, doth very
much aſſuage the Pain and promote his Recovery,
both as by its balſamic Nature it diſpoſeth the Parts
to heal, and alſo as it leſſens if not totally prevents
the Fever.</p>
                  <p>A poor Boy in <hi>Cloyne,</hi> having fallen from a
Tree, broke both Arm and Wriſt. This Accident
was concealed or neglected for two or three Weeks;
he was then put under the Care of a skilful Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetter,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0374600900:16"/>
who finding the Bones knit and grown
crooked, and that it would be neceſſary to break
them again, in order to ſet them right, and withal
conſidering the hot Seaſon of the Year (in <hi>July</hi>) he
apprehended his Patient's being thrown into a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
that might prove fatal. But the Boy being
made to drink copiouſly of Tar-Water, this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented
or leſſened the Fever in ſuch ſort, that the
Bones were broke and ſet again, and the Cure pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded
as eaſily and ſpeedily as Could be wiſhed.</p>
                  <p>I have known ſeveral Inſtances of Bruiſes and
Wounds cured by Tar-Water. A Perſon in my
Neighbourhood ran over by a Horſe was much
bruiſed, and cured only by drinking Tar-Water.
Another knocked down with a Mallet, thereupon
thrown into a violent Fever, and given for dead;
another wounded with an Axe, ſo that his Life was
thought in danger, were both recovered by the Uſe
of Tar-Water; which, as it is ſovereign againſt
Gangrenes and Fevers, hath great Succeſs in all
Sorts of Wounds, Contuſions, and Fractures, being
taken throughout the whole chirurgical Proceſs,
along with whatſoever other Methods or Remedies
are applied.</p>
                  <p>Tar-Water operates variouſly. In Dropſies and
Bruiſes it hath been known to work by purging.
The ſtronger Kind being uſed as a Waſh, is good
againſt ulcerous Eruptions. But in all Caſes where
the Lotion is uſed, I believe the drinking of Tar-Water
might alone ſuffice, albeit the Sores may be
longer withering and drying away.</p>
                  <p>There is a certain Age or Time of Life, when the
female Sex runs no ſmall Risk from the ceaſing of
their natural Evacuations. In this Caſe Tar-Water
is a good Preſervative, purifying the Blood, and
clearing it from that cancerous Tendency, which it
is ſometimes ſubject to, about that time. I take it
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0374600900:17"/>
to be a Specific in all cancerous Caſes, even the
bleeding Cancer, eſteemed incurable by Phyſicians,
hath been cured by Tar-Water.</p>
                  <p>In Diſeaſes peculiar to Women it is of no ſmall
Uſe. Several who had ſuffered much by Accidents
in Child-bearing, have found themſelves relieved by
Tar-Water. In all Sorts of Tumours, Wens, and
praeternatural Excreſcences, it hath been found an
excellent Remedy.</p>
                  <p>Many dangerous Symptoms, and even ſudden
Death are often owing to a Polypus, in ſome or
other of the Veſſels, through which the Blood cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culates,
than which it ſeems there is no inward Cauſe
of Death or Diſeaſe more to be dreaded and guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
againſt; how many drop down dead in our
Streets, or at Table, or in the midſt of Buſineſs or
Diverſions? how many are found dead in their Beds?</p>
                  <p>Tremors, Palpitations of the Heart, irregular
Pulſes, Apoplexies, ſudden Deaths, often proceed
from a ſlow, ſtagnating, interrupted Motion, or
ſtoppage of the Blood, in its Circulation through
the Body; and there ſeemeth to be no Cauſe ſo cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
productive of obſtructed Circulation, as the
Polypus, a Caſe, perhaps, much more frequent
than is commonly imagined. <hi>Morgagni,</hi> the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated
Profeſſor at <hi>Padua,</hi> and moſt eminent Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomiſt,
who was ſuppoſed to have diſſected more
human Bodies than any Man living, aſſured me,
above thirty Years ago, that in the far greater Part
of ſuch Bodies, he found Polypuſes, if not in the
Ventricles of the Heart or larger Veſſels, yet in
ſome other Veſſel or Cavity; to which he attributes
many Diſorders, and which he ſuppoſed to be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the obſtructed Motion of the Blood. To
prevent this, he diſſuaded from all tight Ligatures,
eſpecially in Sleep, unbuttoning the Neck and
Wriſt-bands of his Shirt every Night, a Practice he
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0374600900:18"/>
had learned (as he ſaid) from his Maſter, the famous
<hi>Malpighi.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Circulation is once quite ſtopped, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
can reſtore it, which would be the ſame thing
as reſtoring a dead Man to Life, and in Proportion,
as the Circulation of the Blood is obſtructed, the
Body is diſordered. Total Obſtruction is Death;
partial Obſtruction is Diſeaſe. The Polypus there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
is always hurtful, if not mortal. It is, indeed,
matter of ſerious Reflexion, that we may probably
carry about with us a Principle of Death, always
at work within, and of a Nature ſo violent and
ſudden in its Effects, ſo hard to come at, and ſo
difficult to ſubdue.</p>
                  <p>It may well be thought at firſt View, a vain Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking,
to attempt to diſſolve a fleſhy or mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branous
Subſtance, ſo latent and inacceſſible, by
common Means or Medicines. But, as Tar-Water
hath been undoubtedly known to diſſolve and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe
Wens, and other fleſhy or membranous Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours,
in the outward Parts of the Body<note n="*" place="bottom">See the Effects of Tar Water, Sect 228, and 229.</note>, having
been drank and circulated with the Blood, it ſhould
ſeem by a Parity of Reaſon, that it may alſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve
and put an End to thoſe Concretions that
are formed in the Ventricles of the Heart or Blood
Veſſels, and ſo remove one great Cauſe of Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexies
and ſudden Death; and what cures may
prevent. I have been the longer on this Subject,
for the ſake of many who lead ſickly Lives, as
well as ſeveral who are ſnatched away by untimely
Death.</p>
                  <p>Univerſally, in all Caſes where other Methods
fail, I could wiſh this of Tar-Water was tried. It
hath been ſometimes known, that the moſt inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
Head-aches, and other nervous Diſorders,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0374600900:19"/>
that would yield to no other Medicine, have been
cured by a Courſe of Tar-Water, regularly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
purſued.</p>
                  <p>Whereſoever pure Blood or Plenty of Spirits are
wanting, it may be concluded from manifold Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience,
that Tar-Water is of ſingular Benefit.
Several Perſons have acknowledged themſelves to be
much fitter to go through Buſineſs or Study from
the Uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it only medicinal to human Kind: it is
alſo of no ſmall uſe in the Curing of brute Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.
It hath been tried on ſeveral Kinds, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
with great Succeſs in the late epidemical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper
of our Horſes. And I have been credibly
informed, that being drank in plenty, it hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
even a glandered Horſe, that was thought
incurable.</p>
                  <p>And as it is of ſuch extenſive uſe, both to Man
and Beaſt, it ſhould ſeem, that a Tub of Tar-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
conſtantly ſupplied in a Market-Town, would
ſerve, in ſome ſort, for an Hoſpital. Many other
Drugs are not eaſily got, this is every where plenty
and cheap; many are of a doubtful Nature, this of
known Innocence; others ſoon periſh, this laſts
for Years, and is not the worſe for keeping. This,
in ſhort, is a Medicine for the common People,
being a ſafe and cheap Remedy; for ſuch as cannot
afford to be long ſick, or to make uſe of coſtly
Medicines.</p>
                  <p>A Patient who drinks Tar-Water, muſt not be
alarmed at Puſtules or Eruptions in the Skin; theſe
are good Symptoms, and ſhew the Impurities of the
Blood to be caſt out. It is alſo not amiſs to obſerve,
that, as Tar-Water by its active Qualities, doth
ſtir the Humours, entering the minuteſt Capillaries,
and diſlodging Obſtructions, it may happen that
this working ſhall ſometimes be felt in the Limbs,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0374600900:20"/>
or diſcharge itſelf in a Fit of the Gout, which, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
diſagreeable, proves ſalutary.</p>
                  <p>I am credibly informed of ſeveral ſtrange Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyances,
which Tar-Water hath found out, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
to diſcharge Impurities from the human Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.
A Perſon who had been in a bad ſtate
of Health above twenty Years, upon a Courſe of
Tar-Water was thrown into a moſt extraordinary
Fit of an Ague, and from that time recovered a
good State of Health. An old Gentleman in the
County of <hi>Cork,</hi> who for a long time had been a
Valetudinarian, afflicted with many Infirmities, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
adviſed to drink Tar-Water, found himſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved,
but it produced and ſoon cured a Pthiriaſis
or louſy Diſtemper, in which the putrid Humours
having diſcharged themſelves, left him quite ſound
and healthy.</p>
                  <p>In a Courſe of Tar-Water, if any Diſorder hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens
from ſome other Cauſe, as from Cold, from
the uſe of ſtrong Liquors, from a Surfeit, or ſuch
like Accident, it would not be fair to impute it
to Tar-Water; and yet this hath been ſometimes
done.</p>
                  <p>The Effects of Vomiting occaſioned by Tar-Water
are not to be apprehended. Some are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged
from drinking becauſe their Stomachs
cannot bear it. But when it takes a turn towards
working upwards, Nature, by that very way, hath
been often known to carry on the Cure. A worthy
Gentleman, Member of Parliament, came into my
Neighbourhood, in the Autumn of the Year 1750;
he was cachectic and extremely reduced, ſo that his
Friends thought him near his End. Upon his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering
into a Courſe of Tar-Water, it produced a
prodigious Vomiting, which weakened him much
for the preſent; but perſiſting to continue the Uſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0374600900:21"/>
thereof for about two Months, he was reſtored to
his Health, Strength and Spirits.</p>
                  <p>Tar-Water is very diuretic, thereby preventing
Stone and Gravel, and carrying off by Urine, thoſe
Salts that might otherwiſe occaſion Fevers, Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſms,
Dropſies, Head-aches, and many other
Diſorders, if retained in the Blood. Hence, ſome
have apprehended a Diabetes, from the continued
Uſe thereof, but it is ſo far from cauſing a Diabetes,
that it hath been known to cure that Diſorder.</p>
                  <p>The Conſtitution of a Patient ſometimes requireth
during a Courſe of Tar-Water, that he take Water
and Honey, alſo roſted Apples, ſtewed Prunes and
other Diet of an opening Kind. A Hint of this is
ſufficient. If the Reader now and then meets with
ſome Remarks, contained in my former Writings
on this Subject, he may be pleaſed to conſider, I
had rather repeat than forget what I think uſeful to
be known.</p>
                  <p>Some, endeavouring to diſcourage the Uſe of
Tar-Water in <hi>England,</hi> have given out that it may
indeed be ſerviceable in <hi>Ireland,</hi> where People live
on ſuch low Diet as ſour Milk and Potatoes, but it
cannot be of the ſame Service in <hi>England,</hi> where
Men are accuſtomed to a more liberal and hearty
Food; and indeed it muſt be owned, that the
Peaſants in this Iſland, live but poorly, but no
People in <hi>Europe</hi> live better (in the Senſe of Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
and Drinking) than our Gentry and Citizens;
and from theſe the Inſtances of Cures by Tar-Water
have been chiefly taken. Thoſe who would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
its Uſe to the moiſt Air and poor Diet of
<hi>Ireland,</hi> may be aſſured that all over <hi>Europe,</hi> in
<hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germany, Italy, Portugal,</hi> and <hi>Holland,</hi>
Tar-Water works the ſame Effect. In both <hi>North</hi>
and <hi>South,</hi> in <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> it hath been
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0374600900:22"/>
uſed and continues to be uſed with great Succeſs.
It hath reached all our Colonies both on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent
and the Iſlands, and many Barrels of Tar-Water
have been ſent from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> to <hi>Batavia;</hi>
of all which I have had authentic Accounts. But
its Uſe is no where more conſpicuous than at Sea,
in curing that Plague of ſea-faring Perſons, the
Scurvy, as was found in the late Attempt to diſcover
a north-weſt Paſſage; and (as I doubt not) will be
found as oft as it is tried. Every Ship in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's
Navy ſhould always have a Veſſel of Tar-Water
upon Deck, for the Uſe of the Sailors, both
in the Scurvy and other Maladies.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed a Medicine equally calculated for all
Climates, for Sea and Land, for rich and poor,
high and low Livers; being, as hath been elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
mentioned, a Cordial which doth not heat;
a peculiar Privilege this, and of excellent Uſe.
That it is a Cordial, is manifeſt from its cheering
and enlivening Quality, and that it is not heating,
is as manifeſt, from its ſingular Uſe in all Caſes
where the Blood is inflamed. As this Medicine
imparts a genial friendly Warmth, ſuited to the
human Conſtitution, thoſe who paſs through a
Courſe of Tar-Water, would do well not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
ſuch friendly Warmth to an inflaming Heat,
by a wrong Regimen of high-ſeaſoned Food and
ſtrong Liquors, which are not wanted by the Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of Tar-Water. There is a certain Degree of
Heat neceſſary to the Well-being and Life of Man.
More than this will be uneaſy, and this Uneaſineſs
indicates a proper Choice of Diet.</p>
                  <p>I have myſelf drank above a Gallon of Tar-Water
in a few Hours, and been cooled and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
from a Fever by it. So many Inſtances of
the ſame Nature I have known, as would make it
evident to any unprejudiced Perſon, that Tar-Water
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0374600900:23"/>
is a cooling Medicine; of which Truth I
am as thoroughly convinced, as it is poſſible to be
of any Theorem in Phyſic or natural Science.</p>
                  <p>The Unſucceſsfulneſs of other Methods, ſhould
rather be an Encouragement than a Bar to the Trial
of Tar-Water. A young Lady, Daughter to a
worthy Gentleman near <hi>Cork,</hi> had been long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted
with a grievous Pain in her Side, and having
had the beſt Advice that could be got, was not
relieved until ſhe drank Tar-Water, which quite
removed her Pain. Some time after ſhe was again
ſeized with the ſame Diſorder, but returning to the
Uſe of Tar-Water, ſhe grew well and ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues
ſo.</p>
                  <p>A Woman turned out of the Infirmary at <hi>Cork,</hi>
as incurable, becauſe ſhe would not ſubmit to the
cutting off her Leg, came to, <hi>Cloyne,</hi> where ſhe
continued half a Year drinking Tar-Water, and
living upon Bread and Milk, by which Courſe ſhe
recovered, and went to Service.</p>
                  <p>There is at preſent, while I am writing, a moſt
remarkable Caſe here at <hi>Cloyne,</hi> of a poor Soldier
in a Dropſy, whoſe Belly was ſwoln to a moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moderate
Size. He ſaid he had been five Months
in an Hoſpital at <hi>Dublin,</hi> and having tried other
Methods in vain, left it to avoid being tapped. It
is a Fortnight ſince he came to <hi>Cloyne,</hi> during which
Time he hath drunk two Quarts of Tar-Water
every Day. His Belly is now quite reduced: his
Appetite and Sleep which were gone are reſtored:
he gathers Strength every Moment: and he who
was deſpaired of, ſeems to be quite out of Danger,
both to himſelf, and to all who ſee him. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that upon drinking the Tar-Water, he
voided ſeveral Worms of a very extraordinary Size.
This Medicine, which is obſerved to make ſome
Perſons coſtive, is to hydropic Patients a ſtrong
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0374600900:24"/>
Purge. The preſent is but one of ſeveral Inſtances,
wherein the Dropſy hath been cured by Tar-Water;
which I never knew to fail in any Species of that
Malady.</p>
                  <p>I am very credibly informed, that an aged
Clergyman of <hi>Maidſtone</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> being reduced to
the laſt Extremity by the Gout in his Stomach, after
having tried ſtrong Liquors, and the Methods
uſual in that Caſe without Succeſs, betook himſelf
to drink a vaſt Quantity of warm Tar-Water, ſtill
repleniſhing and letting it take its Courſe; by which
it pleaſed God to deliver him from the Jaws of
Death.</p>
                  <p>A Gentleman in the County of <hi>Clare,</hi> near <hi>Ennis,</hi>
had a Fever and Pleuriſy, and Inflammation of the
Lungs, being at the laſt Extremity, and given over
by two Phyſicians, he was adviſed to drink Tar-Water,
which he did, eight Quarts. Next Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one of the Doctors asking at what Hour his
Patient died? to his great Surpriſe found he was
recovered. This I had from a Parliament-Man his
Neighbour.</p>
                  <p>When the yellow Fever (as it was called) raged
in the <hi>West-Indies,</hi> the Negroes, with a Tub of
Tar-Water in their Quarters, did well: but ſome
of the better Sort miſcarried, among whom the
Phyſician himſelf lay at the Point of Death; but
his Brother recovered him by pouring down his
Throat in Spoonfuls, ſome of the ſame Liquor that
recovered the Negroes. The Fact was related to
me by a Gentleman who was then in the Iſland of
<hi>St. Christopher's,</hi> and knew it to be true.</p>
                  <p>A Phyſician himſelf, not long ſince aſſured me,
he had cured an Ulcer in the Bladder, by ordering
his Patient to drink Tar-Water, when he had tried
all other Methods in vain, and thought the Case
incurable</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0374600900:25"/>
But it would be endleſs to relate the Effects of
Tar-Water, in deſperate Caſes. The Recovery of
Mrs. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> Daughter to the late Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi>
from a lingering hopeleſs Diſorder, was a noted
Caſe, and atteſted to by his Lordſhip. I have
even been informed upon good Authority, of two
or three Inſtances, wherein Perſons have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
by Tar-Water, after they had Rattles in
the Throat.</p>
                  <p>In certain Caſes, a ſmaller Quantity of Tar-Water
hath proved ineffectual, when a larger hath
perfected the Cure. A Woman of <hi>Cloyne</hi> got cold
after Child-bearing, which occaſioned a great Pain
in her Thigh, Swelling alſo and Redneſs; ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
in great Torment above three Weeks. She
then began to drink Tar-Water, but not drinking
much ſhe did not perceive much good; and when
there was not any Hopes of her Life, ſhe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded
to try what a Gallon a Day might do; upon
this ſhe grew better, the Swelling broke and ran; no
Dreſſing was uſed but Tar, and no Waſhing but
Tar-Water, until ſhe was quite recovered.</p>
                  <p>In Ailments of an odd and untried Nature, it
may be worth while to try Tar-Water. In Proof
of this many Inſtances might be given. A Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
with a wither'd Arm had it reſtored by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Tar-Water. Another who, by running his
Head againſt a Poſt, had a Concuſſion of the Brain
attended with very bad Symptoms, recovered by
drinking Tar-Water after other Medicines had failed.
In my own Neighbourhood, one had loſt the uſe of
his Limbs by Poiſon, another had been bitten by a
mad Aſs; theſe Perſons drank Tar-Water, and their
Cure was attributed to it.</p>
                  <p>When Tar-Water is copiouſly drank in Fevers,
the great Danger to be guarded againſt, is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
Flow of Spirits, which excites the Patient to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0374600900:26"/>
talk and divert himſelf with Company, which may
produce a Relapſe; of this I have known fatal
Effects.</p>
                  <p>If in a Courſe of Tar Water the Patient ſhould
find himſelf heated, let him abſtain from or leſſen
his Doſe of ſpirituous and fermented Liquors; for
Tar-Water alone never heats.</p>
                  <p>In chronical Diſorders it is not adviſeable, to
break off a Courſe of Tar-Water at once, but rather
to diminiſh the Quantity by Degrees.</p>
                  <p>The Acid alone hath not the medicinal Virtues
of Tar-Water. This is agreeable to Reaſon and
Experience, as well as the Opinion of the ableſt
Judges. Doctor <hi>Linden</hi> juſtly obſerves,  <q rend="inline">"that when
the empyreumatic Oil is entirely ſeparated from

                  <p>WHETHER the Proſperity that preceded,
or the Calamities that ſucceed the South
Sea Project have moſt contributed to our undoing,
is not ſo clear a Point as it is that we are actually
undone, and loſt to all Senſe of our true Intereſt;
nothing leſs than this could render it pardonable, to
have Recourſe to thoſe old faſhioned trite Maxims
concerning Religion, Induſtry, Frugality, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Spirit, which are now forgotten, but if revived
and put in practice, may not only prevent our final
Ruin, but alſo render us a more happy and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
People than ever.</p>
                  <p>Religion hath in former Days been cheriſhed and
reverenced by wiſe Patriots and Lawgivers, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
it to be impoſſible that a Nation ſhould thrive
and flouriſh without Virtue, or that Virtue ſhould
ſubſiſt: without Conſcience, or Conſcience without
Religion: inſomuch that an Atheiſt or Infidel was
looked on with Abhorrence, and treated as an
Enemy to his Country. But in theſe wiſer Times,
a cold Indifference for the national Religion, and
indeed for all Matters of Faith and divine Worſhip,
is thought good Senſe. It is even become faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to decry Religion; and that little Talent of
Ridicule is applied to ſuch wrong Purpoſes, that
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0374600900:30"/>
a good Chriſtian can hardly keep himſelf in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.</p>
                  <p>Liberty is the greateſt human Bleſſing that a
virtuous Man can poſſeſs, and is very conſiſtent
with the Duties of a good Subject and a good
Chriſtian, but the preſent Age aboundeth with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicious
Patrons of Liberty, who not diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
between that and Licentiouſneſs, take the ſureſt
Method to diſcredit what they would ſeem to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagate;
for, in effect, can there be a greater Affront
offered to that juſt Freedom of Thought and
Action, which is the Prerogative of a rational Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
or can any Thing recommend it leſs to honeſt
Minds than under Colour thereof to obtrude Scur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rility
and Profaneneſs on the World? But it hath
been always obſerved of weak Men, that they
know not how to avoid one Extreme without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
into another.</p>
                  <p>Too many of this Sort paſs upon vulgar Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
for great Authors, and Men of profound
Thought, not on account of any Superiority either
in Senſe or Stile, both which they poſſeſs in a very
moderate Degree, nor of any Diſcoveries they have
made in Arts and Sciences, which they ſeem to be
little acquainted with: but purely becauſe they flatter
the Paſſions of corrupt Men, who are pleaſed to
have the Clamours of Conſcience ſilenced, and thoſe
great Points of the Chriſtian Religion made ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,
which withheld them from many Vices of
Pleaſure and Intereſt, or made them uneaſy in the
Commiſſion of them.</p>
                  <p>In order to promote that laudable Deſign of
effacing all Senſe of Religion from among us, they
form themſelves into Aſſemblies, and proceed with
united Counſels and Endeavours; with what Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
and with what Merit towards the Public, the
Effect too plainly ſhews; I will not ſay, theſe
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0374600900:31"/>
Gentlemen have formed a direct Deſign to ruin
their Country, or that they have the Senſe to ſee
half the ill Conſequences, which muſt neceſſarily
flow from the ſpreading of their Opinions, but the
Nation feels them, and it is high time the Legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature
put a ſtop to them.</p>
                  <p>I am not for placing an invidious Power in the
Hands of the Clergy, or complying with the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowneſs
of any miſtaken Zealots, who ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline
to perſecute Diſſenters: but whatever Conduct,
common Senſe, as well as Chriſtian Charity obligeth
us to uſe, towards thoſe who differ from us in ſome
Points of Religion, yet the public Safety requireth,
that the avowed Contemners of all Religion ſhould
be ſeverely chaſtiſed, and perhaps it may be no
eaſy matter to aſſign a good Reaſon why Blaſphemy
againſt God ſhould not be inquired into, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with the ſame Rigour as Treaſon againſt the
King.</p>
                  <p>For though we may attempt to patch up our
Affairs, yet it will be to no Purpoſe, the Finger of
God will unravel all our vain Projects, and make
them Snares to draw us into greater Calamities, if
we do not reform that ſcandalous Libertiniſm which
(whatever ſome ſhallow Men may think) is our
worſt Symptom and the ſureſt Prognoſtic of our
Ruin.</p>
                  <p>Induſtry is the natural ſure Way to Wealth; this
is ſo true, that it is impoſſible an induſtrious free
People ſhould want the Neceſſaries and Comforts of
Life, or an idle enjoy them under any Form of
Government. Money is ſo far uſeful to the Public,
as it promoteth Induſtry, and Credit having the
ſame Effect, is of the ſame Value with Money; but
Money or Credit circulating through a Nation
from hand to hand without producing Labour and
Induſtry in the Inhabitants, is direct Gaming.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0374600900:32"/>
It is not impoſſible for cunning Men to make
ſuch plauſible Schemes, as may draw thoſe who are
leſs skilful into their own and the public Ruin.
But ſurely there is no Man of Senſe and Honeſty,
but muſt ſee and own, whether he underſtands the
Game or not, that it is an evident Folly for any
People, inſtead of proſecuting the old honeſt
Methods of Induſtry and Frugality, to ſit down to
a public Gaming-table, and play off their Money
one to another.</p>
                  <p>The more Methods there are in a State for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring
Riches without Induſtry or Merit, the leſs
there will be of either in that State; this is as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
as the Ruin that attends it. Beſides, when
Money is ſhifted from hand to hand in ſuch a
blind fortuitous Manner, that ſome Men ſhall from
nothing in an inſtant acquire vaſt Eſtates, without
the leaſt Deſert; while others are as ſuddenly ſtript
of plentiful Fortunes, and left on the Pariſh by their
own Avarice and Credulity, what can be hoped for
on the one hand, but abandoned Luxury and
Wantonneſs, or on the other, but extreme Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
and Deſpair.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, all Project for growing rich by ſudden
and extraordinary Methods, as they operate violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
on the Paſſions of Men, and encourage them
to deſpiſe the ſlow moderate Gains that are to be
made by an honeſt Induſtry, muſt be ruinous to the
Public, and even the Winners themſelves will at
length be involved in the public Ruin.</p>
                  <p>It is an eaſy matter to contrive Projects for the
Encouragement of Induſtry; I wiſh it were as eaſy
to perſuade Men to put them in Practice. There
is no Country in Europe where there is ſo much
Charity collected for the Poor, and none where it is
ſo ill managed. If the Poor-tax was fixed at a
Medium in every Pariſh, taken from a Calculation
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0374600900:33"/>
of the laſt ten Years, and raiſed for ſeven Years by
Act of Parliament, that Sum (if the common
Eſtimate be not very wrong) frugally and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
laid out in Work-houſes, would for ever
free the Nation from the Care of providing for the
Poor, and at the ſame time conſiderably improve
our Manufactures. We might by theſe means rid
our Streets of Beggars, even the Children, the
maimed and the blind, might be put in a way of
doing ſomething for their Livelihood. As for the
ſmall Number of thoſe, who by Age or Infirmities
are utterly incapable of all Employment, they
might be maintained by the Labour of others; and
the Public would receive no ſmall Advantage from
the Induſtry of thoſe, who are now ſo great a
Burden and Expence to it.</p>
                  <p>The ſame Tax, continued three Years longer,
might be very uſefully employed in making high
Roads, and rendering Rivers navigable, two Things
of ſo much Profit and Ornament to a Nation, that
we ſeem the only People in <hi>Europe</hi> Who have neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
them<note n="*" place="bottom">This was publiſhed before Turnpikes were erected.</note>. So that in the ſpace of ten Years
the Public may be for ever freed from a heavy Tax,
Induſtry encouraged, Commerce facilitated, and
the whole Country improved, and all this only by
a frugal honeſt Management, without raiſing one
Peny extraordinary.</p>
                  <p>The Number of People is both Means and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives
to Induſtry; it ſhould therefore be of great
uſe to encourage Propagation, by allowing ſome
Reward or Privilege to thoſe who have a certain
Number of Children; and on the other hand, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting
that the Public ſhall inherit half the unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailed
Eſtates of all who die unmarried of either

Beſides the immediate End propoſed by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going
Methods, they furniſh Taxes upon Paſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers,
and dead Bachelors, which are in no ſort
grievous to the Subject, and may be applied towards
clearing the public Debt, which, all Mankind agree,
highly concerneth the Nation in general, both Court
and Country. <hi>Caeſar</hi> indeed, mentions it as a Piece
of Policy, that he borrowed Money from his Officers
to beſtow it on the Soldiers, which fixed both to
his Intereſt; and though ſomething like this may
paſs for Skill at certain Junctures in civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet if carried too far, it will prove a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
Experiment.</p>
                  <p>There is ſtill Room for Invention or Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
in moſt Trades and Manufactures, and it is
probable, that Praemiums given on that Account to
ingenious Artiſts, would ſoon be re-paid an hundred-fold
to the Public. No Colour is ſo much wore
in <hi>Italy, Spain,</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> as Black; but our
black Cloth is neither ſo laſting, nor of ſo good a
Dye as the <hi>Dutch,</hi> which is the Reaſon of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing
the Profit of that Trade; this is ſo true,
that I have known <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants abroad wear
black Cloth of <hi>Holland</hi> themſelves, and ſell and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend
it as better than that of their own
Country. It is commonly ſaid the Water of <hi>Leyden</hi>
hath a peculiar Property for colouring Black, but it
hath been alſo ſaid and paſſed current, that good
Glaſſes may be made no where but at <hi>Venice,</hi> and
there only in the Iſland of <hi>Murano:</hi> which was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed
to ſome peculiar Property in the Air; and
we may poſſibly find other Opinions of that ſort
to be as groundleſs, ſhould the Legiſlature think it
worth while to propoſe Praemiums in the foregoing,
or in the like Caſes of general Benefit to the Public;
but I remember to have ſeen, about ſeven Years ago,
a Man pointed at in a Coffee-Houſe, who (they ſaid)
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0374600900:35"/>
had firſt introduced the right ſcarlet Dye among us,
by which the Nation in general, as well as many
private Perſons, have ſince been great Gainers
though he was himſelf a Beggar, who, if this be
true, deſerved an honourable Maintenance from the
Public.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo ſeveral Manufactures which we
have from abroad, that may be carried on to as
great Perfection here as elſewhere. If it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
that more fine Linen is wore in <hi>Great-Britain</hi>
than in any other Country of <hi>Europe,</hi> it will be
difficult to aſſign a Reaſon why Paper may not be
made here as good, and in the ſame Quantity, as in
<hi>Holland,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> or <hi>Genoa.</hi> This is a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture
of great Conſumption, and would ſave much
to the Public. The like may be ſaid of Tapeſtry,
Lace, and other Manufactures, which is ſet on foot
in cheap Parts of the Country, would employ many
Hands, and ſave Money to the Nation, as well as
bring it from abroad. Projects for improving old
Manufactures, or ſetting up new ones, ſhould not
be deſpiſed in a trading Country, but the making
them Pretences for Stockjobbing hath been a fatal
Impoſition.</p>
                  <p>As Induſtry dependeth upon Trade, and this, as
well as the public Security, upon our Navigation,
it concerneth the Legiſlature to provide, that the
Number of our Sailors do not decreaſe, to which it
would very much conduce, if a Law were made
prohibiting the Payment of Sailors in foreign Parts;
for it is uſual with thoſe on board Merchant-Men
as ſoon as they ſet foot on Shore to receive their
Pay, which is ſoon ſpent in riotous Living; and
when they have emptied their Pockets, the Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a Piſtole preſent Money, never faileth to
draw them into any foreign Service. To this, (if
I may credit the Information I have had from ſome
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0374600900:36"/>
                     <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factors abroad) it is chiefly owing, that
the <hi>Venetians, Spaniards,</hi> and others, have ſo many
<hi>Engliſh</hi> on board their Ships; ſome Merchants
indeed and Maſters of Veſſels may make a Profit
in defrauding thoſe poor Wretches when they pay
them in ſtrange Coin (which I have been aſſured
often amounts to twelve Pence in the Crown) as well
as in ridding themſelves of the Charge of keeping
them when they ſell their Ships, or ſtay long in
Port, but the Public loſe both the Money and the
Men; who, if their Arrears were to be cleared at
home, would be ſure to return, and ſpend them in
their own Country: It is a Shame this Abuſe ſhould
not be remedied.</p>
                  <p>Frugality of Manners is the Nouriſhment and
Strength of Bodies politic. It is that by which
they grow and ſubſiſt, until they are corrupted by
Luxury; the natural Cauſe of their Decay and Ruin.
Of this we have Examples in the <hi>Perſians, Lace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daemonians,</hi>
and <hi>Romans:</hi> not to mention many later
Governments which have ſprung up, continued a
while, and then periſhed by the ſame natural Cauſes.
But theſe are, it ſeems, of no uſe to us; and, in
ſpite of them, we are in a fair Way of becoming
ourſelves, another uſeleſs Example to future Ages.</p>
                  <p>Men are apt to meaſure national Proſperity by
Riches, it would be righter to meaſure it by the
Uſe that is made of them. Where they promote
an honeſt Commerce among Men, and are Motives
to Induſtry and Virtue, they are without doubt of
great Advantage; but where they are made (as too
often happens) an Inſtrument to Luxury, they
enervate and diſpirit the braveſt People. So juſt is
that Remark of <hi>Machiavel,</hi> that there is no Truth
in the common Saying, Money is the Nerves of
War; and though we may ſubſiſt tolerably for a
Time among corrupt Neighbours, yet if ever we
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0374600900:37"/>
have to do with a hardy, temperate, religious Sort
of Men, we ſhall find to our Coſt, that all our
Riches are but a poor Exchange for that Simplicity
of Manners which we deſpiſe in our Anceſtors.
This ſole Advantage hath been the main Support of
all the Republics that have made a Figure in the
World; and perhaps it might be no ill Policy in a
Kingdom to form itſelf upon the Manners of a
Republic.</p>
                  <p>Simplicity of Manners may be more eaſily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in a Republic than a Monarchy; but if once
loſt, may be ſooner recovered in a Monarchy, the
Example of a Court being of great Efficacy, either
to reform or to corrupt a People; that alone were
ſufficient to diſcountenance the wearing of Gold or
Silver, either in Cloaths or Equipage, and it the
ſame were prohibited by Law, the ſaving ſo much
Bullion would be the ſmalleſt Benefit of ſuch an
Inſtitution; there being nothing more apt to debaſe
the Virtue and good Senſe of our Gentry of both
Sexes, than the trifling Vanity of Apparel, which
we have learned from <hi>France,</hi> and which hath had
ſuch viſible ill Conſequences on the Genius of that
People. Wiſer Nations have made it their Care to
ſhut out this Folly by ſevere Laws and Penalties, and
its ſpreading among us can forbode no good, if
there be any Truth in the Obſervation of one of the
Ancients, that the direct Way to ruin a Man is to
dreſs him up in fine Cloaths.</p>
                  <p>It cannot be denied that Luxury of Dreſs giveth
a light Behaviour to our Women, which may paſs
for a ſmall Offence, becauſe it is a common one, but
is in truth the Source of great Corruptions. For
this very Offence the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> denounced a
ſevere Judgment againſt the Ladies of his Time.
I ſhall give the Paſſage at length; <q rend="inline">'Moreover, the
LORD ſaith, becauſe the Daughters of <hi>Zion</hi> are
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0374600900:38"/>
haughty, and walk with ſtretched forth Necks
and wanton Eyes, walking and mincing as they
go, and making a Tinkling with their Feet;
therefore the LORD will ſmite with a Scab the
Crown of the Head of the Daughters of <hi>Zion,</hi>
and the LORD will diſcover their ſecret Parts. In
that Day the Lord will take away the Bravery
of their tinkling Ornaments about their Feet, and
their Cauls, and their round Tires like the Moon,
the Chains, and the Bracelets, and the Mufflers,
the Bonnets, and the Ornaments of the Legs, and
the Head-bands, and the Tablets, and the Earrings,
the Rings, and Noſe jewels, the change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Suits of Apparel, and the Mantles, and the
Wimples, and the criſping Pins, the Glaſſes, and
the fine Linen, and the Hoods and the Vails.
And it ſhall come to paſs that inſtead of a ſweet
Smell there ſhall be a Stink; and inſtead of a
Girdle a Rent; and inſtead of well-ſet Hair, Bald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
and inſtead of a Stomacher, a Girding of
Sackcloth; and Burning inſtead of Beauty:'</q> The
Scab, the Stench, and the Burning are terrible
peſtilential Symptoms, and our Ladies would do
well to conſider, they may chance to reſemble thoſe
of <hi>Zion,</hi> in their Puniſhment as well as their
Offence.</p>
                  <p>But Dreſs is not the only Thing to be reformed,
ſumptuary Laws are uſeful in many other Points.
In former Times the natural Plainneſs and good
Senſe of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> made them leſs neceſſary. But
ever ſince the luxurious Reign of King <hi>Charles</hi> the
ſecond, we have been doing violence to our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
and are by this time ſo much altered for
the worſe, that it is to be feared, the very ſame
Diſpoſitions that make them neceſſary, will for
ever hinder them from being enacted or put in
Execution.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0374600900:39"/>
A private Family in difficult Circumſtances, all
Men agree, ought to melt down their Plate, walk
on Foot, retrench the Number of their Servants,
wear neither Jewels nor rich Cloaths, and deny
themſelves expenſive Diverſions; and why not the
Public? had any Thing like this been done, our
Taxes had been leſs, or which is the ſame thing,
we ſhould have felt them leſs. But it is very re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
that Luxury was never at ſo great a
Height, nor ſpread ſo generally through the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
as during the Expence of the late Wars, and
the heavy Debt that ſtill lieth upon us.</p>
                  <p>This Vice draweth after it a Train of Evils
which cruelly infeſt the Public; Faction, Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
Envy, Avarice, and that of the worſt kind,
being much more hurtful in its Conſequences,
though not ſo infamous as Penury. It was the
great Art of Cardinal <hi>Richelieu,</hi> by encouraging
Luxury and Expence to impoveriſh the <hi>French</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility,
and render them altogether dependent on
the Crown, which hath been ſince very ſucceſsfully
effected. Theſe and many more Conſiderations
ſhew the Neceſſity there is for ſumptuary Laws,
nor can any thing be ſaid againſt them in this
Iſland, which might not with equal Force be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected
in other Countries, which have nevertheleſs
judged the public Benefit of ſuch Inſtitutions, to be
of far greater Importance than the ſhort Sufferings
of a few, who ſubſiſt by the Luxury of others.</p>
                  <p>It is evident, that old Taxes may be better born,
as well as new ones raiſed by ſumptuary Laws ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly
framed, not to damage our Trade, but
retrench our Luxury. It is evident, that for want
of theſe, Luxury (which, like the other Faſhions,
never faileth to deſcend) hath infected all Ranks of
People, and that this enableth the <hi>Dutch</hi> and <hi>French</hi>
to underſell us, to the great Prejudice of our
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0374600900:40"/>
Traffic. We cannot but know that in our preſent
Circumſtances, it ſhould be our Care, as it is our
Intereſt to make Poverty tolerable; in ſhort we
have the Experience of many Ages to convince us,
that a corrupt luxurious People muſt of themſelves
fall into Slavery, although no Attempt be made
upon them. Theſe and the like obvious Reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſhould, one would think, have forced any
People in their Senſes upon frugal Meaſures.</p>
                  <p>But we are doomed to be undone. Neither the
plain Reaſon of the Thing, nor the Experience of
paſt Ages, nor the Examples we have before our
Eyes, can reſtrain us from imitating, not to ſay
ſurpaſſing, the moſt corrupt and ruined People, in
thoſe very Points of Luxury that ruined them.
Our Gaming, our Operas, our Maskerades, are,
in spite of our Debts and Poverty, become the
Wonder of our Neighbours. If there be
any Man ſo void of all Thought and common Senſe,
as not to ſee where this muſt end, let him but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare
what <hi>Venice</hi> was at the League of <hi>Cambray,</hi>
with what it is at preſent, and he will be convinced,
how truly thoſe faſhionable Paſtimes are calculated
to depreſs and ruin a Nation.</p>
                  <p>But neither <hi>Venice</hi> nor <hi>Paris,</hi> nor any other
Town in any Part of the World, ever knew ſuch
an expenſive ruinous Folly as our Maskerade.
This alone is ſufficient to inflame and ſatisfy the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Appetites for Gaming, Dreſſing, Intriguing,
luxurious Eating and Drinking. It is a moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
Abridgment, the very Quinteſſence, the abſtract
of all thoſe ſenſeleſs Vanities, that have ever been
the Ruin of Fools and Deteſtation of wiſe Men.
And all this under the Notion of an elegant Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment,
hath been admitted among us; though
it be in truth a Contagion of the worſt Kind.
The Plague, dreadful as it is, is an Evil of ſhort
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0374600900:41"/>
duration; Cities have often recovered and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
after it; but when was it known that a People
broken and corrupt by Luxury recovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves?
not to ſay, that general Corruption of
Manners never faileth to draw after it ſome heavy
Judgment of War, Famine, or Peſtilence. Of
this we have a freſh Inſtance in one of the moſt
debauched Towns of <hi>Europe</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Marſeilles.</note>, and no Body
knows how ſoon it may be our own Caſe. This
elegant Entertainment is indeed ſuſpended for the
preſent, but there remains ſo ſtrong a Propenſion
towards it, that, if the Wiſdom of the Legiſlature
does not interpoſe, it will ſoon return with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional
Temptation of having been forbid for a
Time. It were ſtupid and barbarous to declaim
againſt keeping up the Spirit of the People by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
Diverſions, but then they ſhould be proper,
ſuch as poliſh and improve their Mind, or increaſe
the Strength and Activity of their Bodies; none
of which Ends are anſwered by the Maskerade,
no more than by thoſe <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi> Follies,
which, to our Shame, are imported and encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
at a Time, when the Nation ought to be too
grave for ſuch Trifles.</p>
                  <p>It is not to be believed, what Influence public
Diverſions have on the Spirit and Manners of a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.
The <hi>Greeks</hi> wiſely ſaw this, and made a very
ſerious Affair of their public Sports. For the
ſame Reaſon, it will perhaps ſeem worthy the Care
of our Legiſlature, to regulate the public Diverſions,
by an abſolute Prohibition of thoſe which have a
direct Tendency to corrupt our Morals, as well as
by a Reformation of the Drama; which, when
rightly managed, is ſuch a noble Entertainment,
and gave thoſe fine Leſſons of Morality and good
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0374600900:42"/>
Senſe to the <hi>Athenians</hi> of old, and to our <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Gentry above a Century ago; but for theſe laſt
ninety Years, hath entertained us, for the moſt
part, with ſuch wretched Things as ſpoil, inſtead
of improving the Taſte and Manners of the Audi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence.
Thoſe who are attentive to ſuch Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
only, as may fill their Pockets, will probably
ſlight theſe Things as Trifles below the Care of
the Legiſlature. But I am ſure, all honeſt think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Men muſt lament to ſee their Country run
headlong into all thoſe luxurious Follies, which, it
is evident, have been fatal to other Nations, and
will undoubtedly prove fatal to us alſo, if a timely
Stop be not put to them.</p>
                  <p>Public Spirit, that glorious Principle of all that
is great and good, is ſo far from being cheriſhed
or encouraged, that it is become ridiculous in this
enlightened Age, which is taught to laugh at every
Thing that is ſerious as well as ſacred. The ſame
atheiſtical narrow Spirit, centring all our Cares upon
private Intereſt, and contracting all our Hopes
within the Enjoyment of this preſent Life, equally
produceth a Neglect of what we owe to God and
our Country. <hi>Tully</hi> hath long ſince obſerved, <q rend="inline">"that
it is impoſſible for thoſe, who have no Belief of
the Immortality of the Soul or a future State
of Rewards and Puniſhments, to ſacrifice their
particular Intereſts and Paſſions to the public
Good, or have a generous Concern for Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,"</q>
and our own Experience confirmeth the
Truth of this Obſervation.</p>
                  <p>In order therefore to recover a Senſe of public
Spirit, it is to be wiſhed that Men were firſt affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a true Senſe of Religion; <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi>
having ever been the great Motive to Courage and
Perſeverance in a public Cauſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="tcp:0374600900:43"/>
It would likewiſe be a very uſeful Policy, and
warranted by the Example of the wiſeſt Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
to make the natural Love of Fame and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation
ſubſervient to promoting that noble Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.
Triumphal Arches, Columns, Statues, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions,
and the like Monuments of public Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices,
have in former Times been found great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centives
to Virtue and Magnanimity, and would
probably have the ſame Effects on <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> which
they have had on <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> And per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
a Pillar of Infamy would be found a proper
and exemplary Puniſhment in Caſes of ſignal pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Villany, where the Loſs of Fortune, Liberty,
or Life, are not proportioned to the Crime; or,
where the Skill of the Offender, or the Nature of
his Offence, may skreen him from the Letter of
the Law.</p>
                  <p>Several of theſe are to be ſeen at <hi>Genoa, Milan,</hi>
and other Towns of <hi>Italy,</hi> where it is the Cuſtom
to demoliſh the Houſe of a Citizen, who hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired
the Ruin of his Country, or been guilty of
any enormous Crime towards the Public, and in
place thereof to erect a Monument of the Crime,
and Criminal deſcribed, in the blackeſt manner.
We have nothing of this ſort, that I know, but
that which is commonly called the Monument,
which in the laſt Age was erected for an Affair
no way more atrocious than the modern unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampled
Attempt<note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>South-Sea</hi> Project.</note> of Men eaſy in their Fortunes,
and unprovoked by Hardſhips of any ſort, in cool
Blood, and with open Eyes to ruin their native
Country. This Fact will never be forgotten, and
it were to be wiſhed that with it the public Deteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
thereof may be tranſmitted to Poſterity,
which would in ſome meaſure vindicate the Honour
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0374600900:44"/>
of the preſent, and be a uſeful Leſſon to future
Ages.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe noble Arts of Architecture, Sculpture,
and Paintings do not only adorn the Public, but
have alſo an Influence on the Minds and Manners
of Men, filling them with great Ideas, and ſpirit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
them up to an Emulation of worthy Actions.
For this Cauſe they were cultivated and encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the <hi>Greek</hi> Cities, who vied with each other
in building and adorning their Temples, Theatres,
Porticos, and the like public Works, at the ſame
Time that they diſcouraged private Luxury, the
very Reverſe of our Conduct.</p>
                  <p>To propoſe the building a Parliament Houſe,
Courts of Juſtice, Royal Palace, and other public
Edifices, ſuitable to the Dignity of the Nation, and
adorning them with Paintings and Statues, which
may tranſmit memorable Things and Perſons to
Poſterity, would probably be laughed at as a vain
Affair, of great Expence, and little Uſe to the
Public; and it muſt be owned, we have reduced
ourſelves to ſuch Straits, that any Propoſition of
Expence-ſuiteth ill with our preſent Circumſtances.
But how proper ſoever this Propoſal may be for
the Times, yet it comes ſo properly into a Diſcourſe
of public Spirit, that I could not but ſay ſomething
of it. And at another Time it will not ſeem un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,
if we conſider that it is no more than
the wiſeſt Nations have done before us, that it would
ſpirit up new Arts, employ many Hands, keep the
Money circulating at home, and laſtly, that it would
be a notable Inſtance of public Spirit, as well as a
Motive to it.</p>
                  <p>The ſame noble Principle may be alſo encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged
by erecting an Academy of ingenious Men,
whoſe Employment it would be to compile the
Hiſtory of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> to make Diſcourſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0374600900:45"/>
to inſpire Men with a Zeal for the Public, and
celebrate the Memory of thoſe who have been Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments
to the Nation, or done it eminent Service.
Not to mention that this would improve our Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
and amuſe ſome buſy Spirits of the Age;
which perhaps would be no ill Policy.</p>
                  <p>This is not without Example; for to ſay nothing
of the <hi>French</hi> Academy, which is proſtituted to
meaner Purpoſes, it hath been the Cuſtom of the
<hi>Venetian</hi> Senate to appoint one of their Order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue
the Hiſtory of the Republic. This was intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
in the flouriſhing State of that People, and is
ſtill in force. We fall ſhort of other Nations in
the Number of good Hiſtorians, though no Nation
in Chriſtendom hath produced greater Events, or
more worthy to be recorded. The <hi>Athenian</hi> Senate
appointed Orators to commemorate annually, thoſe
who died in Defence of their Country, which Solem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity
was performed at the Monuments erected in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
of them by the Public; and the Panegyrics,
compoſed by <hi>Iſocrates</hi> and <hi>Pericles,</hi> as well as
many Paſſages in <hi>Tully,</hi> inform us with what Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the ancient Orators uſed to expatiate in Praiſe
of their Country.</p>
                  <p>Concord and Union among ourſelves is rather to
be hoped for, as an Effect, of public Spirit, than
propoſed as a Means to promote it. Candid, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous
Men, who are true Lovers of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
can never be Enemies to one half of their
Countrymen, or carry their Reſentment ſo far as to
ruin the Public for the ſake of a Party. Now I
have fallen upon the mention of our Parties, I ſhall
beg leave to inſert a Remark or two, for the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
both of Whig and Tory, without entering
into their reſpective Merits. Firſt, it is impoſſible
for either Party to ruin the other, without involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
themſelves and their Poſterity in the ſame Ruin.
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0374600900:46"/>
Secondly, it is very feaſible for either Paty to get
the better of the other, if they could firſt get the
better of themſelves; and inſtead of indulging the
little womaniſh Paſſions of Obſtinacy, Reſentment,
and Revenge, ſteadily promote the true Intereſt of
their Country, in thoſe great clear Points of Piety,
Induſtry, Sobriety of Manners, and an honeſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard
for Poſterity; which, all Men of Senſe agree,
are eſſential to public Happineſs. There would be
ſomething ſo great and good in this Conduct, as
muſt neceſſarily overbear all Calumny and Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
But that Men ſhould act reaſonably, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
to be wiſhed than hoped.</p>
                  <p>I am well aware, that to talk of public Spirit,
and the Means of retrieving it, muſt to narrow ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did
Minds be matter of Jeſt and Ridicule, how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable
ſoever it be to right Reaſon, and the
Maxims of Antiquity. Though one would think,
the moſt ſelfiſh Man might ſee it was their Intereſt
to encourage a Spirit in others, by which they, to
be ſure, muſt be Gainers. Yet ſuch is the Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
and Folly of the preſent Age, that a public
Spirit is treated like Ignorance of the World, and
want of Senſe; and all the Reſpect is paid to cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
Men, who bend and wreſt the public Intereſt
to their own private Ends, that in other Times
hath been thought due to thoſe who were generous
enough to ſacrifice their private Intereſt to that of
their Country.</p>
                  <p>Such Practices and ſuch Maxims as theſe muſt
neceſſarily ruin a State. But if the contrary
ſhould prevail, we may hope to ſee Men in Power
prefer the public Wealth and Security to their own,
and Men of Money make free Gifts, or lend it
without Intereſt to their Country. This, how
ſtrange and incredible ſoever it may ſeem to us,
hath been often done in other States. And the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0374600900:47"/>
natural <hi>Engliſh</hi> Temper conſidered, together with
the Force of Example, no one can tell how far a
Propoſal for a free Gift may go among the moneyed
Men, when ſet on foot by the Legiſlature, and
encouraged by the Example of two or three Men
of Figure, who have the Spirit to do a generous
Thing, and the Underſtanding to ſee it is every
private Man's Intereſt to ſupport that of the Public.</p>
                  <p>If they who have their Fortunes in Money ſhould
make a voluntary Gift, the Public would be eaſed,
and at the ſame time maintain its Credit. Nor
is a generous Love of their Country the only Motive
that ſhould induce them to this. Common Equity
requires, that all Subjects ſhould equally ſhare the
public Burden. And common Senſe ſhews, that
thoſe who are foremoſt in the Danger, ſhould not
be the moſt backward in contributing to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>Before I leave this Subject, I cannot but take
notice of that moſt infamous Practice of Bribery,
than which nothing can be more oppoſite to public
Spirit, ſince every one who takes a Bribe plainly
owns, that he prefers his private Intereſt to that of
his Country. This Corruption is become a national
Crime, having infected the loweſt as well as the
higheſt among us, and is ſo general and notorious,
that, as it cannot be matched in former Ages, ſo it
is to be hoped it will not be imitated by Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>This calls to mind another national Guilt, which
we poſſeſs in a very eminent Degree; there being
no Nation under the Sun, where ſolemn Perjury
is ſo common, or where there are ſuch Temptations
to it. The making Men ſwear ſo often in their
own Caſes, and where they have an Intereſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal
the Truth, hath gradually wore off that awful
Reſpect which was once thought due to an Appeal
to Almighty God; inſomuch, that Men now a
Days break their Faſt, and a Cuſtom-Houſe Oath
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0374600900:48"/>
with the ſame Peace of Mind. It is a Policy pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
to us, the obliging Men to perjure or betray
themſelves, and hath had no one good Effect, but
many very ill ones. Sure I am, that other Nations,
without the hundredth Part of our Swearing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
to do their Buſineſs, at leaſt as well as we do.
And perhaps our Legiſlature will think it proper to
follow their Example. For whatever Meaſures are
taken, ſo long as we lie under ſuch a Load of Guilt,
as national Perjury and national Bribery, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible
we can proſper.</p>
                  <p>This poor Nation hath ſorely ſmarted of late,
and to eaſe the preſent Smart, a ſudden Remedy
(as is uſual in ſuch Caſes) hath been thought of.
But we muſt beware not to miſtake an Anodyne
for a Cure. Where the Vitals are touched, and the
whole Maſs of Humours vitiated, it is not enough
to eaſe the Part pained, we muſt look further, and
apply general Correctives; otherwiſe the ill Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
may ſoon ſhew itſelf in ſome other Part.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>South-Sea</hi> Affair, how ſenſible ſoever, is not
the original Evil, or the great Source of our Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes,
it is but the natural Effect of thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples,
which for many Years have been propagated
with great Induſtry. And as a ſharp Diſtemper, by
reclaiming a Man from Intemperance, may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
his Life, ſo it is not impoſſible but this pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
Calamity that lies ſo heavy on the Nation may
prevent its Ruin. It would certainly prove the
greateſt of Bleſſings, if it ſhould make all honeſt
Men of one Party; if it ſhould put Religion and
Virtue in Countenance, reſtore a Senſe of public
Spirit, and convince Men it is a dangerous Folly to
purſue private Aims in Oppoſition to the Good of
their Country, if it ſhould turn our Thoughts from
Cozenage and Stock-jobbing, to Induſtry and
frugal Methods of Life; in fine, if it ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vive
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0374600900:49"/>
and inflame that native Spark of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Worth
and Honour, which hath too long lain ſmothered
and oppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>With this View I have, among ſo many Projects
for remedying the ill State of our Affairs in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Inſtance, ventured to publiſh the foregoing
general Hints, which as they have been thrown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
from a Zeal for the public Good, ſo I heartily
wiſh they may be regarded neither more nor leſs,
than as they are fitted to promote that End.</p>
                  <p>Though it muſt be owned, that little can be
hoped if we conſider the corrupt degenerate Age we
live in. I know it is an old Folly to make peeviſh
Complaints of the Times, and charge the common
Failures of human Nature on a particular Age.
One may nevertheleſs venture to affirm, that the
preſent hath brought forth new and portentous Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies,
not to be paralleled in our own or any other
Hiſtory. We have been long preparing for ſome
great Cataſtrophe. Vice and Villany have by
degrees grown reputable among us; our Infidels
have paſſed for fine Gentlemen, and our venal
Traitors for Men of Senſe, who knew the World.
We have made a Jeſt of public Spirit, and cancelled
all Reſpect for whatever our Laws and Religion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute
ſacred. The old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Modeſty is quite
worn off, and inſtead of bluſhing for our Crimes,
we are aſhamed only of Piety and Virtue. In ſhort,
other Nations have been wicked, but we are the
firſt who have been wicked upon Principle.</p>
                  <p>The Truth is, our Symptoms are ſo bad, that
notwithſtanding all the Care and Vigilance of the
Legiſlature, it is to be feared the final Period of our
State approaches. Strong Conſtitutions, whether
politic or natural, do not feel light Diſorders. But,
when they are ſenſibly affected, the Diſtemper is for
the moſt part violent and of an ill Prognoſtic.
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0374600900:50"/>
Free Governments like our own were planted by
the <hi>Goths</hi> in moſt Parts of <hi>Europe;</hi> and though we
all know what they are come to, yet we ſeem
diſpoſed rather to follow their Example, than to
profit by it.</p>
                  <p>Whether it be in the Order of Things, that civil
States ſhould have, like natural Products, their
ſeveral Periods of Growth, Perfection, and Decay;
or whether it be an Effect, as ſeems more probable,
of human Folly, that as Induſtry produces Wealth,
ſo Wealth ſhould produce Vice, and Vice Ruin.</p>
                  <p>God grant the Time be not near, when Men ſhall

                  <p>THE Pretenſions and Diſcourſe of Men,
throughout theſe Kingdoms, would, at firſt
View, lead one to think the Inhabitants were all
Politicians; and yet, perhaps, political Wiſdom
hath in no Age, or Country, been more talked of,
and leſs underſtood. Licence is taken for the End
of Government, and popular Humour for its Origin.
No Reverence for the Law, no Attachment to the
Conſtitution, little Attention to Matters of Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
and great Altercation upon Trifles, ſuch
idle Projects about Religion and Government, as
if the Public had both to chooſe, a general Contempt
of all Authority, divine and human, an Indifference
about the prevailing Opinions, whether they tend to
produce Order or Diſorder, to promote the Empire
of God or the Devil: Theſe are the Symptoms that
ſtrongly mark the preſent Age; and this could
never have been the Caſe, if a Neglect of Religion
had not made Way for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="tcp:0374600900:53"/>
When the <hi>Jews</hi> accuſed <hi>Paul</hi> upon religious
Matters and Points of their Law before <hi>Gallio,</hi> the
<hi>Roman</hi> Magiſtrate; it is ſaid, that GALLIO <hi>cared
for none of thoſe Things.</hi> And, it is to be feared,
there are not a few Magiſtrates in this Chriſtian
Country who think with the ſame Indifference on
the subject of Religion. Herein, nevertheleſs,
they judge amiſs, and are much wanting to their
Duty. For, although it be admitted, that the
Magiſtrate's peculiar Object, is the temporal Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
of the State; yet, this will by no Means exclude
a proper Care about the prevailing Notions and
Opinions of Religion, which influence the Lives
and Actions of Men, and have therefore a mighty
Effect on the Public. Mens, Behaviour is the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence
on their Principles. Hence it follows, that
in order to make a State thrive and flouriſh, Care
muſt be taken, that good Principles be propagated
in the Minds of thoſe who compoſe it.</p>
                  <p>It would be vain to depend on the outward Form,
the Conſtitution, and Structure of a State; while
the Majority are ever governed by their inward
Ways of thinking, which at Times will break out
and ſhew themſelves paramount to all Laws and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions
whatſoever. It muſt be great Folly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
to overlook Notion, as Matters of ſmall Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the State; while Experience ſhews there
is nothing more important; and that a prevailing
Diſorder in the Principles and Opinions of its
Members, is ever dangerous to Society, and capable
of producing the greateſt public Evils.</p>
                  <p>Man is an Animal, formidable both from his
Paſſions and his Reaſon; his Paſſions often urging
him to great Evils, and his Reaſon furniſhing
Means to atchieve them. To tame this Animal,
and make him amenable to Order, to inure him
to a Senſe of Juſtice and Virtue, to withhold him
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0374600900:54"/>
from ill Courſes by Fear, and encourage him in
his Duty by Hopes; in ſhort, to faſhion and model
him for Society, hath been the Aim of civil and
religious Inſtitutions, and in all Times, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
of good and wiſe Men. The apteſt
Method for attaining this End, hath been always
judged a proper Education.</p>
                  <p>If Mens Actions are an Effect of their Principles,
that is, of their Notions, their Belief, their Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſions;
it muſt be admitted, that Principles early
ſown in the Mind, are the Seeds which produce
Fruit and Harveſt in the ripe State of Manhood.
How lightly ſoever ſome Men may ſpeak of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
yet, ſo long as the Soul governs the Body,
Mens Notions muſt influence their Actions, more
or leſs, as they are ſtronger or weaker; and to
Good or Evil, as they are better or worſe.</p>
                  <p>Our Notions and Opinions are a conſtant Check
on our Appetites, and Balance to our Paſſions;
and, although they may not in every Inſtance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol
and rule, yet they will never fail, ſtrongly to
affect both the one and the other. What is it that
bridles the impetuous Deſires of Men? That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrains
them when they are driven by the moſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
Paſſions? In a word, what is it that renders
this World habitable, but the prevailing Notions
of Order, Virtue, Duty and Providence? Some,
perhaps, may imagine, that the Eye of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate
alone is ſufficient to keep Mankind in Awe,
But, if every Man's Heart was ſet to do all the
Miſchief his Appetite ſhould prompt him to, as
often as Opportunity and Secrecy preſented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
there could be no Living in the World.</p>
                  <p>And although too many of thoſe intruſted with
civil Power, in theſe our Days, may be ſaid with
GALLIO, to <hi>care for none of thoſe Things;</hi> and
many more who would paſs for Men of Judgment
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0374600900:55"/>
and Knowledge, may look on Notions early im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed,
before their Grounds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Reaſons are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended
or underſtood, to be but mere Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices;
yet this will detract nothing from their
Truth and Uſefulneſs. To place this Matter in a
due Light, I propoſe to ſhew, that a Syſtem of
ſalutary Notions, is abſolutely neceſſary to the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
of every civil Conſtitution. I ſhall enforce
this Point, by the Teſtimony of thoſe who are
eſteemed the wiſeſt Men; and I ſhall make ſome
Remarks on the modern prevailing Spirit, and the
Tendency of the Maxims of our Times.</p>
                  <p>Order is neceſſary, not only to the Well-Being,
but to the very Being of a State. Now, Order
and Regularity in the Actions of Men, is not an
Effect of Appetite or Paſſion, but of Judgment;
and the Judgment is governed by Notions or
Opinions. There muſt therefore, of Neceſſity, in
every State, be a certain Syſtem of ſalutary Notions,
a prevailing Set of Opinions, acquired either by
private Reaſon and Reflexion, or taught and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilled
by the general Reaſon of the Public, that
is, by the Law of the Land. True it is, that
where Men either cannot, or will not uſe their own
Reaſon, think and examine for themſelves; in ſuch
Caſe, the Notions taught or inſtilled into their
Minds are embraced rather by the Memory, than
the Judgment. Nor will it be any Objection to
ſay, that theſe are Prejudices; inaſmuch as they are
therefore, neither the leſs uſeful, nor the leſs true,
although their Proofs may not be underſtood by all
Men.</p>
                  <p>Prejudices are Notions, or Opinions, which the
Mind entertains without knowing the Grounds and
Reaſons of them, and which are aſſented to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Examination. The firſt Notions which take
poſſeſſion of the Minds of Men, with regard to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0374600900:56"/>
Duties ſocial, moral, and civil, may therefore be
juſtly ſtiled Prejudices. The Mind of a young
Creature cannot remain empty; if you do not put
into it that which is good, it will be ſure to receive
that which is bad.</p>
                  <p>Do what you can, there will ſtill be a Bias from
Education; and if ſo, is it not better this Bias
ſhould lie towards Things laudable and uſeful to
Society? This Bias ſtill operates, although it may
not always prevail. The Notions firſt inſtilled, have
the earlieſt Influence, take the deepeſt Root, and
generally are found to give a Colour and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
to the ſubſequent Lives of Men, inaſmuch
as they are in Truth, the great Source of human
Actions. It is not Gold, or Honour, or Power,
that move Men to act, but the Opinions they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain
of thoſe Things. Hence it follows, that if
a Magiſtrate ſhould ſay, No Matter what Notions
Men embrace, I will take heed to their Actions;
therein he ſhews his Weakneſs; for ſuch as are
Mens Notions, ſuch will be their Deeds.</p>
                  <p>For a Man to do, as he would be done by; to
love his Neighbour as himſelf; to honour his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors;
to believe that God ſcans all his Actions,
and will reward or puniſh them; and to think,
that he who is guilty of Falſhood, or Injuſtice,
hurts himſelf more than any one elſe: Are not theſe
ſuch Notions, and Principles, as every wife Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
or Legiſlator, would covet above all Things,
to have firmly rooted in the Mind of every Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual
under his Care? This is allowed, even by
the Enemies of Religion, who would fain have it
thought the Offspring of State Policy; honouring
its Uſefulneſs at the ſame Time that they diſparage
its Truth. What, therefore, cannot be acquired
by every Man's Reaſoning, muſt be introduced by
Precept, and riveted by Cuſtom; that is to ſay, the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0374600900:57"/>
Bulk of Mankind muſt in all civilized Societies,
have their Minds by timely Inſtruction well ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
and furniſhed with proper Notions, which, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though
the Grounds or Proofs thereof be unknown
to them, will nevertheleſs influence their Conduct,
and ſo far render them uſeful Members of the State,
But, if you ſtrip Men of theſe their Notions, or,
if you will, Prejudices, with regard to Modeſty,
Decency, Juſtice, Charity, and the like; you will
ſoon find them ſo many Monſters, utterly unfit for
human Society.</p>
                  <p>I deſire it may be conſidered, that moſt Men want
Leiſure, Opportunity, or Faculties, to derive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſions
from their Principles, and eſtabliſh Morality
on a Foundation of human Science. True it is, (as
St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves) that <hi>The inviſible Things of God
from the Creation of the World, are clearly ſeen.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">ROM. Ch. i. Ver. 20.</note>
And from thence the Duties of natural Religion
may be diſcovered. But theſe Things are ſeen and
diſcovered by thoſe alone who open their Eyes, and
look narrowly for them. Now, if you look through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
the World, you ſhall find but few of theſe nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row
Inſpectors and Inquirers, very few who make
it their Buſineſs to analyſe Opinions and purſue them
to their rational Source, to examine whence Truths
ſpring, and how they are inferred. In ſhort, you
ſhall find all Men full of Opinions, but Knowledge
only in a few.</p>
                  <p>It is impoſſible from the Nature and Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
of human Kind, that the Multitude ſhould
be Philoſophers, or that they ſhould know Things
in their Cauſes. We ſee every Day, that the Rules,
or Concluſions alone, are ſufficient for the Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper
to ſtate his Account, the Sailor to navigate
his Ship, or the Carpenter to meaſure his Timber;
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0374600900:58"/>
none of which underſtand the Theory; that is to
ſay, the Grounds and Reaſons either of Arithmetic
or Geometry. Even ſo in moral, political, and
religious Matters, it is manifeſt, that the Rules and
Opinions early imbibed at the firſt Dawn of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding,
and without the leaſt Glimpſe of
Science, may yet produce excellent Effects, and be
very uſeful to the World: And that in Fact they
are ſo, will be very viſible to every one who ſhall
obſerve what paſſeth round about him.</p>
                  <p>It may not be amiſs to inculcate, that the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
between Prejudices and other Opinions doth
not conſiſt in this; that the former are falſe, and
the latter true; but in this, that the former are taken
upon Truſt, and the latter acquired by Reaſoning.
He, who hath been taught to believe the Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality
of the Soul, may be as right in his Notion,
as he who hath reaſoned himſelf into that Opinion.
It will then by no means follow, that becauſe this
or that Notion is a Prejudice, it muſt be therefore
falſe. The not diſtinguiſhing between Prejudices
and Errors, is a prevailing Overſight among our
modern Free-thinkers.</p>
                  <p>There may be, indeed, certain mere Prejudices
or Opinions, which having no Reaſons either aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned
or aſſignable, to ſupport them, are nevertheſs
entertained by the Mind, becauſe they intruded be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
into it. Such may be ſuppoſed falſe, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
they were early learned, or learned without
their Reaſons; but becauſe there are in truth no
Reaſons to be given for them.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, if a Notion may be concluded falſe,
becauſe it was early imbibed, or becauſe it is with
moſt Men an Object of Belief rather than of
Knowledge, one may by the ſame Reaſoning con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
ſeveral Propoſitions of <hi>Euclid</hi> to be falſe. A
ſimple Apprehenſion of Concluſions as taken in
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0374600900:59"/>
themſelves without the Deductions of Science, is
what falls to the Share of Mankind in general.
Religious Awe, the Precepts of Parents and
Maſters, the Wiſdom of Legiſlators, and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulated
Experience of Ages, ſupply the Place
of Proofs and Reaſonings with the Vulgar of all
Ranks: I would ſay, that Diſcipline, national Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution,
and Laws human or divine, are ſo many
plain Land Marks, which guide them into the
Paths wherein it is preſumed they ought to tread.</p>
                  <p>From what hath been premiſed, it plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
that in the Bulk of Mankind, there are, and
muſt be Prejudices; that is, Opinions taken upon
Truſt; or, in other Words, that there are Points
of Faith among all Men whatſoever, as well as
among Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>And, as it is evident, that the unthinking Part
of every Age, Sex, and Condition among us, muſt
neceſſarily receive Notions with the Submiſſion of
Faith; ſo it is very reaſonable, that they ſhould
ſubmit their Faith to the greateſt Authorities human
and divine, the Law and the Goſpel. But, if once
all Reverence for theſe be deſtroyed, our Pretenders
to moral Knowledge will have no Authority to
imbue the Multitude with ſuch Notions as may
control their Appetites. From all which it follows,
that the modern Schemes of our Free-thinkers, who
pretend to ſeparate Morality from Religion, how
rational ſoever they may ſeem to their Admirers,
are, in Truth and Effect, moſt irrational and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious
to civil Society.</p>
                  <p>Let any one, who thinks at all, conſider the ſavage
State of undiſciplined Men, whoſe Minds are
nurtured to no Doctrine, broke by no Inſtruction,
governed by no Principle. Let him at the ſame
Time reflect on a Society of Perſons educated in
the Principles of our Church, formed betimes to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0374600900:60"/>
fear God, to reverence their Superiors, to be grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
to their Benefactors, forgiving to their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
juſt and charitable to all Men; and he will
then be able to judge of the Merits of thoſe who
are ſo active to weed out the Prejudices of Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                  <p>Among the many wild Notions broached in theſe
giddy Times, it muſt be owned, that ſome of our
Declaimers againſt Prejudice have wrought them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into a Sort of Eſteem for Savages, as a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
and unprejudiced People. In Proof of which,
they alledge their being free from many Vices
practiſed in civilized Nations. Now, it is very
true, among Savages there are few Inſtances to be
found of Luxury, Avarice, or Ambition; not that
the contrary Virtues take place, but becauſe the
Opportunities and Faculties for ſuch Vices, are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.
For the ſame Reaſon you do not ſee them in
Brutes.</p>
                  <p>What they eſteem and admire in thoſe Creatures,
is not Innocence, but Ignorance; it is not Virtue,
but Neceſſity. Give them but the Means of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſing,
and they know no Bounds. For Example:
Supply the Water-drinking Savage with ſtrong
Liquor, and he ſhall be drunk for ſeveral Days and
Nights together. Again; we admit an unedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
Savage knows not how to ſupplant a Rival
with the refined Treachery of a Courtier; yet, if
you put his Foe once in his Power, you ſhall ſoon
ſee what a horrible Reliſh and Delight the Monſter
hath in Cruelty.</p>
                  <p>Above all others, religious Notions, or if you
will, Prejudices, (ſince this, as hath been already
obſerved, detracts nothing from their Truth and
Uſefulneſs) have the moſt Influence, they are the
ſtrongeſt Curb from Vice, and the moſt effectual
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0374600900:61"/>
Spur to worthy Conduct. And indeed, whether
we conſider the Reaſon of Things, or the Practice
of Men in all Times, we ſhall be ſatisfied, that
nothing truly great and good can enter into the
Heart of one attached to no Principles of Religion,
who believes no Providence, who neither fears Hell,
nor hopes for Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Puniſhments and Rewards have always had, and
always will have the greateſt Weight with Men;
and the moſt conſiderable of both Kinds are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by Religion, the Duties whereof fall in with
the Views of the civil Magiſtrate; it undeniably
follows, that nothing can add more Strength to
a good and righteous Government than Religion.
Therefore it mainly concerns Governors to keep an
attentive Eye on the Religion of their Subjects.
And indeed, it is one Leſſon to Magiſtrate and
People, Prince and Subject, <hi>Keep my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and live, and my Law as the Apple of thine
Eye.</hi>

                  <p>Although it is no Conſequence from what hath
been ſaid, that Men ſhould be debarred the free
Uſe of Reaſon and Inquiry; yet, ſurely it will
follow, that without good Reaſon, a Man ſhould
not reject thoſe Notions which have been inſtilled
by the Laws and Education of his Country. And
even they who think they have ſuch Reaſon, have
nevertheleſs no Right of dictating<note n="a" place="bottom">Though a Man's private Judgment be a Rule to himſelf, it will not thence follow, that he hath any Right to ſet up for a Rule to others.</note> to others. It
is true, divine Authority is ſuperior to all human
Prejudices, Inſtitutions and Regards whatſoever.
And it is wiſe, although at the Risk of Liberty,
or Life, to obey God rather than Man. But our
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0374600900:62"/>
modern Reformers of Prejudice, have nothing to
plead<note n="b" place="bottom">No Man can ſay he is obliged in Conſcience, Honour, or Prudence, to inſult the public Wiſdom, or to ridicule the Laws under whoſe Protection he lives.</note> of that kind.</p>
                  <p>There is no Magiſtrate ſo ignorant as not to
know that Power, phyſical Power, reſides in the
People; but Authority is from Opinion, which
Authority is neceſſary to reſtrain and direct the
People's Power, and therefore Religion is the great
Stay and Support of a State. Every Religion that
inculcates Virtue, and diſcourageth Vice, is ſo far
of public Benefit. The Chriſtian Religion doth
noth only this, but further makes every legal Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
ſacred by commanding our Submiſſion
thereto. <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject to the higher
Powers,</hi> ſaith St. PAUL, <hi>for the Powers that be, are
ordained of God</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">ROM. Ch. xiii. Ver. 1.</note>. And, in effect, for ſeveral Years
paſt, while the Reverence for our Church and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
hath been decaying and wearing off from
the Minds of Men, it may be obſerved, that Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty
hath in Proportion loſt ground; and now the
very Word ſeems quite forgotten. Submiſſion
for Conſcience, as well as for Wrath, was once
reckoned an uſeful Leſſon; but now, with other
good Leſſons, is laid aſide as an obſolete Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice.</p>
                  <p>That Prince or Magiſtrate, however great or
powerful, who thinks his own Authority ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
to make him reſpected and obeyed, lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
a woful Miſtake, and never fails to feel it ſooner
or later. Obedience to all civil Power is rooted in
the religious Fear of God; it is propagated, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
and nouriſhed by Religion. This makes
Men obey, not with Eye-Service, but in Sincerity
of Heart. Human Regards may reſtrain Men
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0374600900:63"/>
from open and penal Offences; but the Fear of
God is a Reſtraint from all Degrees of all Crimes,
however circumſtanced. Take away this Stay and
Prop of Duty, this Root of civil Authority; and
all that was ſuſtained by it, or grew from it, ſhall
ſoon languiſh. The Authority, the very Being of
the Magiſtrate, will prove a poor and precarious
Thing.</p>
                  <p>An inward Senſe of the ſupreme Majeſty of the
King of Kings, is the only Thing that can beget
and preſerve a true Reſpect for ſubordinate Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty
in all the Degrees of Power, the firſt Link of
Authority being fixed at the Throne of God. But
in theſe our Days, that <hi>Majeſtas imperii,</hi> that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credneſs
of Character, which rooted in a religious
Principle, was the great Guard and Security of
the State, is through Want thereof become the
public Scorn. And indeed, what Hold can the
Prince or Magiſtrate have on the Conſcience of
thoſe who have no Conſcience? How can he build
on the Principles of ſuch as have no Principles?
Or how can he hope for Reſpect where God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
is neglected?</p>
                  <p>It is manifeſt that no Prince upon Earth can
hope to govern well, or even to live eaſy and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure,
much leſs reſpected by his People, if he do
not contribute by his Example and Authority, to
keep up in their Minds an awful Senſe of Religion.
As for a moral Senſe and moral Fitneſs, or eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Relations, how inſufficient thoſe Things are
for eſtabliſhing general and juſt Notions of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
or for keeping Men within due Bounds, is
ſo evident from Fact and Experience, that I need
not now enter into a particular Diſquiſition about
them.<note n="*" place="bottom">

It must be owned, that the Claws of Rapine
and Violence, may in ſome Degree be pared and
blunted by the outward Polity of a State. But
ſhould we not rather try, if poſſible, to pull them
quite out? The evil Effects of Wickedneſs may be

not be better to heal the Source, and by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward

                  <p>I ſhall now add, that it is to be apprehended,
many of thoſe who are the moſt forward to baniſh
Prejudices, would be the firſt to feel the Want of
them. It is even pitiful to think what would be

were Prejudice really ſet aſide, and were all Men
to be weighed in the exact Scale of Merit, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
in Proportion only to their intrinſic Worth.
Some Prejudices are grounded in Truth, Reaſon and
Nature. Such are the Reſpects which are paid to
Knowledge, Learning, Age, Honeſty and Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage,
in all civilized Countries. Others are purely
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0374600900:67"/>

                  <p>GOD, comprehending within himſelf the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning,
End and Middle of all Things and Times,
exerts his Energy throughout the whole Creation.
He never ceaſeth to influence by Inſtinct, by the
Light of Nature, by his declared Will. And it
is the duty of Magiſtrates and Lawgivers, to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
and encourage thoſe divine Impreſſions in the
Minds of all Men under their Care. We are not
to think, it is the Work of God, and therefore not
to be ſeconded by human Care. Far otherwiſe, for
that very reaſon it claims our utmoſt Care and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
it being the indiſpenſible Duty of all good
Men, throughout the whole Courſe of their Lives,
to co-operate with the Deſigns of Providence. In
Religion, as in Nature, God doth ſomewhat, and
ſomewhat is to be done on the Part of Man. He
cauſes the Earth to bring forth Materials for Food
and Raiment; but human Induſtry muſt improve,

                  <p>It would be no hard Matter to produce a Cloud
of Teſtimonies in behalf of a national Religion,
from the moſt eminent of our own Writers; but I
ſhall content myſelf with adding one only, and that
from a very unſuſpected Writer, Mr. <hi>Harrington,</hi>
Author of the <hi>Oceana,</hi> who ſhews that to be juſt

                  <p>All theſe Authorities are taken from thinking
Men, and able Politicians, none of which can be
ſuppoſed to ſay what he did not really think; and
it had been very eaſy to have increased the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.
But, I am ſorry, I was obliged to mention any
at all, in proof of ſo plain and fundamental a Point
as that of a national Religion. It is indeed, a
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0374600900:72"/>
ſhameful Neceſſity we lie under, of proving at this
Time of Day the firſt Elements, I will not ſay of
Chriſtianity, but even of natural Light, from Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and from Authorities. The Spirit of the
Times hath rendered this unavoidable.</p>
                  <p>If it ſhould be asked after all, how comes it
then to paſs, that the faſhionable and prevailing
Maxims among our Betters, in a neighbouring Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
ſhould run directly counter to all ſuch Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
and Authorities? I will anſwer this Queſtion,
by asking when were our Neighbours known to
abound to that Degree in Highwaymen, Murderers,
Houſe-breakers, Incendiaries? When did ſuch Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers
lay violent Hands on themſelves? When was
there ſuch a general and indecent Contempt of
whatever is eſteemed ſacred, in the State as well as
the Church? When were there known among
them ſuch public Frauds, ſuch open Confederacies
in Villany, as the preſent Age hath produced?
When were they lower in Eſteem of Mankind, more
divided at home, or more inſulted abroad?</p>
                  <p>We of this Land have a fatal Tendency to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>look
the good Qualities, and imitate whatever is
amiſs in thoſe whom we reſpect. This leads me to
make ſome Remarks on the modern Spirit of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,
that works ſo ſtrongly in both theſe
Kingdoms.</p>
                  <p>Freedom of Thought is the general Plea and Cry
of the Age; and we all grant, that thinking is the
Way to know; and the more real Knowledge there
is in the Land, the more likely it will be to thrive.
We are not therefore againſt Freedom of Thought,
but we are againſt thoſe unthinking, overbearing
People,<note n="e" place="bottom">It is not Reaſon candidly propoſed that offends, but the Reviling, Inſulting, Ridiculing of the national Laws and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, all this profiteth for Free-thinking, and muſt needs be offenſive to all reaſonable Men.</note> who, in theſe odd Times, under that Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence,

all Impreſſions of Piety and Virtue, in order to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
Prejudices of another Kind, deſtructive of
Society.</p>
                  <p>We eſteem it a horrible Thing, to laugh at the

paſs, that the civil Magiſtrate daily loſeth his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,

It may be preſumed, that the Science of finding
Fault, which above all others is eaſieſt to learn, ſuits
beſt with a modern Education. Too many there
are of better Fortunes than Underſtandings, who
have made the Inquiry after Truth, a very ſmall
Part of their Care: Theſe ſee ſomewhat, but not
enough. It were to be wiſhed, they knew either
leſs or more. One Thing it is evident they do not
know; to wit, that while they rail at Prejudice,
they are undoing themſelves: They do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
(what hath been before hinted) that their
whole Figure, their political Exiſtence, is owing to
certain vulgar Prejudices, in Favour of Birth,
Title, or Fortune, which add nothing of real
Worth either to Mind or Body; and yet, cauſe
the moſt worthleſs Perſon to be reſpected.</p>
                  <p>Feedom of Thought is the Prerogative of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
Kind; it is a Quality inherent in the very
Nature of a thinking Being. Nothing is more
evident, than that every one can think his own
Way, in ſpite of any outward Force or Power
whatsoever. It is therefore ridiculous for any Man
to declaim in Defence of a Privilege, which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be denied or taken from him. But this will
not infer a boundleſs Freedom of Speech,<note n="f" place="bottom">Is there no Difference between indulging ſcrupulous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, and tolerating public Deriders of all Conſcience and Religion?</note> an open
Contempt of Laws, and a preſcribing from private

                  <p>The Conſtitution of theſe Kingdoms, hath been
one while over-heated by the indiſcreet Zeal of one
Set of Men: Again, it hath been cold and lifeleſs,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0374600900:75"/>
through the Indifference of another.<note n="h" place="bottom">There is a Medium in Things, which wiſe Men find out, while the unwiſe are always blundering in Extremes.</note> We have
alternately felt the furious Effects of Superſtition

is from the ſetting up of private Judgment, or an
inward Light, in Oppoſition to human and divine
Laws. Such an inward conceited Principle always
at work, and proceeding gradually and ſteadily,
may be ſufficient to diſſolve any human Fabric of
Polity or civil Government. To pretend to be

                  </p>
                  <p>The Magiſtrate, perhaps, may not be ſufficiently
aware, that thoſe pretended Advocates for private
Light and free Thought, are in reality ſeditious
Men, who ſet up themſelves againſt national Laws
and Conſtitutions. And yet, one would think,
all Mankind might ſee, that the Spirit which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails
againſt the Church and Religion, proceeds
from an Oppoſition rather to the Laws of the Land,
than to the Goſpel. Men quarrel not ſo vehemently
againſt Articles of Faith themſelves, as againſt the
eſtabliſhing of ſuch Matters; which is the ſole
Effect of Law and the ſupreme Power. It clearly
follows, the Freedom pleaded for is not ſo much
Freedom of Thought againſt the Doctrines of the
Goſpel, as Freedom of Speech and Action againſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0374600900:76"/>
the Laws of the Land. It is ſtrange, that thoſe
who are not blind in other Matters, ſhould yet not
ſee this; or, that ſeeing it, they ſhould not diſcern
the Conſequences thereof.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible, that whatever looks like a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
on Freedom of Inquiry, muſt be very diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable
to all reaſoning and inquiſitive Men. But
againſt this, I have ſaid nothing.<note n="k" place="bottom">The profane and lawleſs Scorner is one Thing, and the modeſt Inquirer after Truth another.</note> On the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
I will freely own, a judicious and impartial
Search after Truth, is the moſt valuable Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Mind. Thoſe who have the Talents,
and will be at the Pains, cannot do better than en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage
in that noble Purſuit. But thoſe who are not
qualified by Age or Education; thoſe who have
neither Diſpoſition nor Leiſure, nor Faculties to dig
in the Mine of Truth themſelves, muſt take it as
retailed out by others. I ſee no Remedy. GOD
who knows the Opportunities of every Man, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires
Impoſſibilities from no Man. And where
there is a ſincere Love of Truth and Virtue, the

                  <p>It hath been before obſerved, and ſhewed at large,
that the Bulk of Mankind muſt have their Minds
betimes imbued with good and wholſom Notions
or Principles, by their Parents, Paſtors, and Tutors,
or elſe bad Notions, hurtful to themſelves and
others, will undoubtedly take poſſeſſion thereof.
Such bad Notions have, for ſeveral Years paſt, been
propagated with uncommon Induſtry in theſe
Kingdoms: They now bring forth Fruit every Day
more and more abundant. It is to be feared, that
what hath been long ripening, is now near ripe.

But there cannot be a higher, or more flagrant
Symptom of the Madneſs of our Times, than
that execrable Fraternity of Blaſphemers, lately ſet
up within this City of <hi>Dublin.</hi> Blaſphemy againſt
GOD, is a great Crime againſt the State. But that
a Set of Men ſhould, in open Contempt of the
Laws, make this very Crime their Profeſſion,
diſtinguiſh themſelves by a peculiar Name<note n="*" place="bottom">Blaſters.</note>, and
form a diſtinct Society, whereof the proper and
avowed Buſineſs ſhall be, to ſhock all ſerious
Chriſtians by the moſt impious and horrid Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies,
uttered in the moſt public Manner: This
ſurely muſt alarm all thinking Men. It is a new
Thing under the Sun reſerved for our worthy Times
and Country.</p>
                  <p>It is no common Blasphemy I ſpeak of: It is not
ſimple Curſing and Swearing: It is not the Effect
either of Habit or Surpriſe; but a Train of ſtudied
deliberate Indignities againſt the divine Majeſty;
and thoſe of ſo black and helliſh a Kind, as the
Tongues alone which uttered them, can duly
characterize and expreſs. This is no ſpeculative
Hereſy, no remote or doubtful Inference from an
Author's Tenets. It is a direct and open Attack on
GOD himſelf. It is ſuch a calm premeditated Inſult
upon Religion, Law, and the very Light of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
that there is no Sect or Nation of Men,
whether Chriſtians, Jews, Mahometans, or even
civilized Heathens, that would not be ſtruck with
Horror and Amazement at the Thought of it, and
that would not animadvert<note n="l" place="bottom">They (if there be any ſuch) who think to ſerve the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, by joining with Blaſters and Devil-worſhippers in a Plea for Licence, are in truth a Scandal and Reproach to the Proteſtant Cauſe.</note> on its Authors with

                  <p>
                     <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0374600900:78"/>
Deliberate, atheiſtical Blaſphemy, is of all Crimes
moſt dangerous to the Public, inaſmuch as it opens
the Door to all other Crimes, and virtually contains
them all. A religious Awe and Fear of GOD, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
(as we have already obſerved) the Centre that
unites, and the Cement that connects all human
Society. He, who makes it his Buſineſs, to leſſen
or root out from the Minds of Men this Principle,
doth in effect, endeavour to fill his Country with
Highwaymen, Houſebreakers, Murderers, fraudulent
Dealers, perjured Witneſſes, and every other Peſt of
Society. Therefore, it would be the greateſt Cruelty
to our Children, Neighbours, and Country, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive
at ſuch a Crime; a Crime! which hath no
natural Paſſion or Temptation to plead for it, but is
the pure Effect of an abandoned Impudence in
Wickedneſs; and, perhaps, of a miſtaken Hope,
that the Laws and Magiſtrates are aſleep.</p>
                  <p>The Queſtion is not now, whether Religion ſhall
be eſtabliſhed by Law: The Thing is already done,
(and done with good Reaſon, as appeareth from the
Premiſes) but whether a Reverence<note n="m" place="bottom">They who plead a Right to contradict the Laws, can pretend none for doing it with Inſolence or Diſreſpect.</note> for the Laws
ſhall be preſerved. Religion, conſidered as a Syſtem
of ſaving Truths, hath its Sanction from Heaven;
its Rewards and Penalties are divine. But Religion,
as uſeful and neceſſary to Society, hath been wiſely
eſtabliſhed by Law; and ſo eſtabliſhed, and wrought
into the very Frame and Principles of our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
is become a main Part of the civil Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution.
Our Laws, are the Laws of a Chriſtian
Country: Our Government hath been conſtituted
and modelled by Chriſtians; and is ſtill admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered
and maintained by Men profeſſing Belief in
CHRIST. Can it then be ſuppoſed, that impious
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0374600900:79"/>
Men ſhall with Impunity invent and<note n="n" place="bottom">To make the Cauſe of ſuch Men the Cauſe of Liberty or Toleration, would be monſtrous. A Man is not ſuffered pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly to blaſpheme, therefore he may not think freely: A profane Miſcreant is not indulged in the public Worſhip of the Devil, therefore a conſcientious Perſon may not ſerve God his own Way: Is not this abſurd?</note> publicly
utter the moſt horrid Blaſphemies; and at the ſame
Time, the whole Conſtitution not be endangered?
Or can it be ſuppoſed, that Magiſtrates, or Men
inveſted with Power, ſhould look on, and ſee the
moſt ſacred Part of our Conſtitution trampled under
foot, and yet imagine their own Dignity and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
to be ſecure, which reſt intirely thereupon?
I will venture to ſay, that whoever is a wiſe Man,
and a Lover of his Country, will not only be
ſolicitous to preſerve the Honour of GOD ſacred
and intire; he will even diſcourage that prevailing
Prejudice againſt the Diſpenſers of GOD'S Word,
the Teachers of thoſe ſalutary Doctrines, without
which the Public cannot thrive or ſubſiſt. He will
be no Contemner, not even of thoſe Rites and
Ordinances enjoined by Law, as neceſſary to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print
and retain a Senſe of Religion in the Minds
of Men. He will extend his Care to the Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>works,
as knowing that when theſe are gone, it
may be difficult to preſerve the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the vain Aſſertion of thoſe
Men, who would juſtify the preſent, by ſaying <hi>All
Times are alike,</hi> it is moſt evident, that the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates,
the Laws, the very Conſtitution of theſe
Realms, have loſt no ſmall Share of their Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
and Reverence, ſince this great growth and
ſpreading of impious Principles. Whatever be the
Cauſe, the Effect is apparent. Whether we aſcribe
it to the natural Courſe of Things, or to a juſt
Judgment upon thoſe, who, having been careleſs
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0374600900:80"/>
to preſerve a due Senſe of the divine Authority,
have ſeen and ſhall ſee their own deſpiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Darius,</hi> a Heathen Prince, made a Decree, that
in every Dominion of his Kingdom, Men ſhould
tremble and fear before GOD.<note n="*" place="bottom">DAN. Ch. VI. Ver. 26.</note>
                     <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>
likewiſe, another Heathen, made a Decree, that
every People, Nation and Language which ſpoke
any Thing amiſs againſt GOD, ſhould be cut in
Pieces, and their Houſes made a Dunghill.<note n="†" place="bottom">DAN. Ch. III. Ver. 29.</note> And
if theſe Things were done in <hi>Perſia</hi> and <hi>Babylon,</hi>
ſurely it may be expected, that impious Blaſphemers
againſt GOD and his Worſhip, ſhould, at leaſt, be
diſcouraged and put out of Countenance in theſe
Chriſtian Countries. Now, a conſtant Courſe of
Disfavour from Men in Authority, would prove a
moſt effectual Check to all ſuch Miſcreants. When
therefore they are public and bold in their Blaſphemies,
this is no ſmall Reflexion on thoſe who
might check them if they would.</p>
                  <p>It is not ſo much the Execution of the Laws, as
the Countenance of thoſe in Authority, that is
wanting to the Maintenance of Religion. If Men
of Rank and Power, who have a Share in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributing
Juſtice, and a Voice in the public Councils,
ſhall be obſerved to neglect divine Worſhip them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
it muſt needs be a great Temptation for
others to do the ſame. But if they, and their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,
ſhould ſet a good Example, it may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
that Men of leſs Figure would be diſpoſed
to follow it. Faſhions are always obſerved to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend,
and People are generally fond of being in
the Faſhion: Whence one would be apt to ſuſpect,
the prevailing Contempt of GOD'S Word, and Eſtrangement
from his Houſe, to a Degree that
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0374600900:81"/>
was never known in any Chriſtian Country, muſt
take its Riſe from the Irreligion and bad Example
of thoſe who are ſtiled <hi>the better Sort.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Offences muſt come, but Woe be to him, by
whom the Offence cometh. A Man who is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted
with Power and Influence in his Country,
hath much to anſwer for, if Religion and Virtue
ſuffer through Want of his Authority and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.
But in Caſe he ſhould, by the Vanity
of his Diſcourſe, his Favour to wicked Men, or
his own apparent Neglect of all religious Duties,
countenance what he ought to condemn, and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorize
by his own Example what he ought to puniſh;
ſuch a one, whatever he may pretend, is in Fact
a bad Patriot, a bad Citizen, and a bad Subject, as
well as a bad Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Our Proſpect is very terrible, and the Symptoms
grow ſtronger every Day. The Morals of a People
are in this, like their Fortunes; when they feel a
national Shock, the worſt doth not ſhew itſelf
immediately. Things make a Shift to ſubſiſt for
a Time, on the Credit of old Notions and dying
Opinions. But the Youth born and brought up
in wicked Times, without any Bias to Good from
early Principle or inſtilled Opinion, when they
grow ripe muſt be Monſters indeed. And it is to
be feared, that Age of Monſters is not far off.</p>
                  <p>Whence this Impiety-ſprings, by what means it
gains ground among us, and how it may be
remedied, are Matters that deſerve the Attention
of all thoſe who have the Power and the Will to
ſerve their Country. And although many Things
look like a Prelude to ſome general Ruin; although
it is much to be apprehended, we ſhall be worſe
before we are better; yet who knows what may
enſue, if all Perſons in Power, from the ſupreme
Executor of the Law, down to a petty Conſtable,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0374600900:82"/>
would, in their ſeveral Stations, behave themſelves
like Men, truly conſcious and mindful, that the
Authority they are clothed with, is but a derivative
Ray from the ſupreme Authority of Heaven?
This may not a little contribute to ſtem that Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent,
which from ſmall Beginnings, and under
ſpecious Pretences, hath grown to ſuch a Head, and
daily gathers Force more and more to that Degree,
as threatens a general Inundation and Deſtruction
of theſe Realms.</p>

We are indeed (to our Shame be it ſpoken) more
inclined to hate for thoſe Articles wherein we differ,
than to love one another for thoſe wherein we agree.
But if we cannot extinguiſh, let us at leaſt ſuſpend
our Animoſities, and forgetting our religious Feuds,
conſider ourſelves in the amiable Light of Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
and Neighbours. Let us for once turn our
Eyes on thoſe Things, in which we have one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Intereſt. Why ſhould Diſputes about Faith
interrupt the Duties of civil Life? or the different
Roads we take to Heaven prevent our taking the
ſame Steps on Earth? Do we not inhabit the ſame
Spot of Ground, breathe the ſame Air, and live
under the ſame Government? why then ſhould we
not conſpire in one and the ſame Deſign, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
the common Good of our Country?</p>
                  <p>We are all agreed about the Uſefulneſs of Meat,
Drink, and Clothes, and without Doubt, we all
ſincerely wiſh our poor Neighbours were better
ſupplied with them. Providence and Nature have
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0374600900:85"/>
done their Part: no Country is better qualified to
furniſh the Neceſſaries of Life, and yet no People
are worſe provided. In vain is the Earth fertile,
and the Climate benign, if human Labour be
wanting. Nature ſupplies the Materials, which
Art and Induſtry improve to the Uſe of Man, and
it is the Want of this Induſtry that occaſions all our
other Wants.</p>

Shew your Charity in clothing the naked and feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

Breath of your Mouths. Give me leave to tell
you, that no Set of Men upon Earth have it in
their Power to do Good on eaſier Terms, with

                  <p>The Houſe of an <hi>Iriſh Peaſant</hi> is the Cave of
Poverty; within, you ſee a Pot and a little Straw;

without, a Heap of Children tumbling on the

Counterpart of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Deſcription in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verbs;
<hi>I went,</hi> ſaith that wiſe King, <hi>by the Field

Road the ragged Enſigns of Poverty are diſplayed;
you often meet Caravans of Poor, whole Families
in a Drove, without Clothes to cover, or Bread to
feed them, both which might be eaſily procured by
moderate Labour. They are encouraged in this
vagabond Life by the miſerable Hoſpitality they
meet with in every Cottage, whoſe Inhabitants
expect the ſame kind Reception in their Turn,
when they become Beggars themſelves; Beggary

                  <p>A ſlothful Man's Imagination is apt to dreſs up

Idleneſs is more to be dreaded, and a Life of

that whoever examines Things will find, there can
be no ſuch Thing as a happy Life without Labour,
and that whoever doth not labour with his Hands,
muſt in his own Defence labour with his Brains.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, planting and tilling the Earth is an
Exerciſe not leſs pleaſing than uſeful; it takes the
Peaſant from his ſmoky Cabin, into the freſh Air

                  <p>Convince your People that not only Pleaſure in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites,
but Neceſſity alſo drives them to labour. If
you have any Compaſſion for theſe poor Creatures,
put them in mind how many of them periſhed in
a late memorable Diſtreſs, through want of that
provident Care againſt a hard Seaſon, obſervable
not only in all other Men, but even in irrational
Animals. Set before their Eyes in lively Colours,
their own indigent and ſordid Lives, compared
with thoſe of other People, whoſe Induſtry hath
procured them hearty Food, warm Clothes, and
decent Dwellings. Make them ſenſible what a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
it is, that a Nation which makes ſo great
Pretenſions to Antiquity, and is ſaid to have
flouriſhed many Ages ago in Arts and Learning,
ſhould in theſe our Days turn out a lazy, deſtitute,
and degenerate Race.</p>
                  <p>Raiſe your Voices, <hi>Reverend Sirs,</hi> exert your
Influence, ſhew your Authority over the Multitude,
by engaging them to the Practice of an honeſt
Induſtry, a Duty neceſſary to all, and required in all,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0374600900:90"/>
whether <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> or <hi>Roman Catholics,</hi> whether
<hi>Chriſtians, Jews,</hi> or <hi>Pagans.</hi> Be ſo good among
other Points to find room for <hi>This,</hi> than which none
is of more Concern to the Souls and Bodies of your
Hearers, nor conſequently deſerves to be more
amply, or frequently inſiſted on.</p>
                  <p>Many and obvious are the Motives that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend
this Duty. Upon a Subject ſo copious, you
can never be at a loſs for ſomething to ſay. And
while by theſe Means you reſcue your Countrymen
from Want and Miſery, you will have the Satiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction
to behold your Country itſelf improved.
What Pleaſure muſt it give you to ſee theſe waſte
and wild Scenes, theſe naked Ditches, and miſerable
Hovels, exchanged for fine Plantations, rich
Meadows, well-tilled Fields, and neat Dwellings;
to ſee People well fed, and well clad, inſtead of
famiſhed, ragged Scarecrows; and thoſe very Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
tilling the Fields that uſed to beg in the Streets.</p>
                  <p>Neither ought the Difficulty of the Enterpriſe
to frighten you from attempting it. It muſt be
confeſſed a Habit of Induſtry is not at once intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced;
Neighbour, nevertheleſs, will emulate
Neighbour, and the Contagion of good Example
will ſpread as ſurely as of bad, though perhaps not
ſo ſpeedily. It may be hoped, there are many that
would be allured by a plentiful and decent Manner
of Life to take Pains, eſpecially when they obſerve
it to be attained by the Induſtry of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
in no Sort better qualified than themſelves.</p>
                  <p>If the ſame gentle Spirit of Sloth did not ſooth
our Squires as well as Peaſants, one would imagine
there ſhould be no idle Hands among us. Alas!
how many Incentives to Induſtry offer themſelves
in this Iſland, crying aloud to the Inhabitants for
Work? Roads to be repaired, Rivers made navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable,
Fiſheries on the Coaſts, Mines to be wrought,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0374600900:91"/>
Plantations to be raiſed, Manufactures improved,
and, above all, Lands to be tilled and ſowed with
all Sorts of Grain.</p>
                  <p>When ſo many Circumſtances provoke and ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
your People to Labour, when their private
Wants, and the Neceſſities of the Public, when the
Laws, the Magiſtrates, and the very Country calls
upon them, you cannot think it becomes you alone
to be ſilent, or hindmoſt in every Project for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting
the public Good. Why ſhould you, whoſe
Influence is greateſt, be leaſt active? why ſhould
you, whoſe Words are moſt likely to prevail, ſay
leaſt in the common Cauſe?</p>
                  <p>Perhaps it will be ſaid the Diſcouragements at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
thoſe of your Communion are a Bar againſt
all Endeavours for exciting them to a laudable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry.
Men are ſtirred up to labour by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
of bettering their Fortunes, by getting Eſtates,
or Employments; but thoſe who are limited in the
Purchaſe of Eſtates, and excluded from all civil Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments,
are deprived of thoſe Spurs to Induſtry.</p>
                  <p>To this it may be anſwered, that admitting theſe
Conſiderations do, in ſome meaſure, damp In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry
and Ambition in Perſons of a certain Rank,
yet they can be no Let to the Induſtry of poor
People, or ſupply an Argument againſt endeavouring
to procure Meat, Drink, and Clothes. It is not
propoſed, that you ſould perſuade the better Sort
to acquire Eſtates, or qualify themſelves for becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
Magiſtrates; but only that you ſhould ſet the
loweſt of the People at Work, to provide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
with Neceſſaries, and ſupply the Wants of
Nature.</p>
                  <p>It will be alledged in Excuſe of their Idleneſs,
that the Country People want Encouragement to
labour, as not having a Property in the Lands.
There is ſmall Encouragement, ſay you, for them
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:0374600900:92"/>
to build, or plant upon another's Land, wherein
they have only a temporary Intereſt. To which I
anſwer, that Life itſelf is but temporary; that all
Tenures are not of the ſame Kind; that the Caſe
of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> and the original <hi>Iriſh</hi> is equal in this
Reſpect; and that the true <hi>Aborigines,</hi> or natural
<hi>Iriſh</hi> are noted for Want of Induſtry in improving
even on their own Lands, whereof they have both
Poſſeſſion and Property.</p>
                  <p>How many induſtrious Perſons are there in all
civilized Countries, without any Property in Lands,
or any Proſpect of Eſtates, or Employments?
Induſtry never fails to reward her Votaries. There
is no one but can earn a little, and little added to
little makes a Heap. In this fertile and plentiful
Iſland, none can periſh for Want but the Idle
and Improvident. None who have Induſtry, Fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality,
and Foreſight, but may get into tolerable,
if not wealthy Circumſtances. Are not all Trades
and Manufactures open to thoſe of your Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion?
have you not the ſame free Uſe, and may
you not make the ſame Advantage of Fairs and
Markets as other Men? do you pay higher Duties,
or are you liable to greater Impoſitions than your
fellow Subjects? and are not the public Praemiums
and Encouragements given indifferently to Artiſts
of all Communions? have not, in Fact, thoſe of
your Communion a very great Share of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
of this Kingdom in their Hands? and is not
more to be got by this than by purchaſing Eſtates,
or poſſeſſing civil Employments, whoſe Incomes are
often attended with large Expences?</p>
                  <p>A tight Houſe, warm Apparel, and wholſom
Food are ſufficient Motives to labour. If all had
them, we ſhould be a flouriſhing Nation. And if
thoſe who take pains may have them, thoſe who
will not take pains are not to be pitied; they are to
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0374600900:93"/>
be looked on and treated as Drones, the Peſt and
Diſgrace of Society.</p>
                  <p>It will be ſaid, the Hardneſs of the Landlord
cramps the Induſtry of the Tenant. But if Rent
be high, and the Landlord rigorous, there is more
need of Induſtry in the Tenant. It is well known
that in <hi>Holland</hi> Taxes are much higher, and Rent
both of Land and Houſes far dearer than in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
But this is no Objection or Impediment to the Induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of the People, who are rather animated and ſpur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
on to earn a Livelihood by Labour, that is not
to be got without it.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, it is an eaſy Matter to make a
plauſible Diſcourle on Induſtry, and its Advantages;
but what can be expected from poor Creatures, who
are deſtitute of all Conveniencies for exerting their
Induſtry, who have nothing to improve upon, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to begin the World with? I anſwer, they
have their four Quarters, and five Senſes. Is it no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
to poſſeſs the bodily Organs found and entire!
That wonderful Machine the Hand, was it formed
to be idle?</p>
                  <p>Was there but Will to work, there are not want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in this Iſland either Opportunities or Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.
Spinning alone might employ all idle
Hands (Children as well as Parents) being ſoon
learned, eaſily performed, and never failing of a
Market, requiring neither Wit nor Strength, but
ſuited to all Ages and Capacities. The Public
provides Utenſils, and Perſons for teaching the Uſe
of them; but the Public cannot provide a Heart
and Will to be induſtrious. Theſe, I will not deny,
may be found in ſeveral Perſons in ſome other Parts
of the Kingdom, and where-ever they are found,
the comfortable Effects ſhew themſelves. But
ſeldom, very ſeldom are they found in theſe
<hi>Southern</hi> Peeple, whoſe Indolence figureth a Lion
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0374600900:94"/>
in the Way, and is Proof againſt all Encouarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>But you will inſiſt, how can a poor Man, whoſe
daily Labour goes for the Payment of his Rent, be
able to provide preſent Neceſſaries for his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily,
much leſs to lay up a Store for the future.
It muſt be owned, a conſiderable Share of the poor
Man's Time and Labour goes towards paying his
Rent. But how are his Wife and Children employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
or how doth he employ himſelf the reſt of his
Time? The ſame Work tires, but different Works
relieve. Where there is a true Spirit of Induſtry,
there will never be wanting ſomething to do, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Doors, or within, by Candle-light, if not by
Day-light. <hi>Labor ipſe Voluptas,</hi> ſaith the Poet, and
this is verified in Fact.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>England,</hi> when the Labour of the Field is over,
it is uſual for Men to betake themſelves to ſome
other Labour of a different kind. In the <hi>Northern</hi>
Parts of that induſtrious Land, the Inhabitants
meet, a jolly Crew, at one another's Houſes, where
they merrily and frugally paſs the long and dark
Winter Evenings; ſeveral Families by the ſame
Light, and the ſame Fire, working at their differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
Manufactures of Wooll, Flax, or Hemp, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
mean while mutually cheering and provoking
to labour. In certain other<note n="*" place="bottom">e. g. <hi>Newport-Pagnel</hi> in <hi>Buckinghamſhire.</hi>
                     </note> Parts you may ſee,
on a Summer's Evening, the common Labourers
ſitting along the Street of a Town or Village,
each at his own Door, with a Cuſhion before him
making Bone-lace, and earning more in an Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's
Paſtime than an <hi>Iriſh Family</hi> would in a whole
Day. Thoſe People inſtead of cloſing the Day
with a Game on greaſy Cards, or lying ſtretched be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the Fire, paſs their Time much more chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0374600900:95"/>
in ſome uſeful Employment, which Cuſtom
hath rendered light and agreeable.</p>
                  <p>But admitting, for the various Reaſons above
alledged, that it is impoſſible for our Cottagers to
be rich, yet it is certain they may be clean. Now
bring them to be cleanly, and your Work is half
done. A little Waſhing, ſcrubbing, and rubbing,
beſtowed on their Perſons and Houſes, would intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
a ſort of Induſtry, and Induſtry in any one
kind is apt to beget it in another.</p>
                  <p>Indolence in Dirt is a terrible Symptom, which
ſhews itſelf in our lower <hi>lriſh</hi> more, perhaps, than
in any People on this Side <hi>The Cape of Good Hope.</hi>
I will venture to add, that look throughout the
Kingdom, and you ſhall not find a clean Houſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited
by clean People, and yet wanting Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries;
the ſame Spirit of Induſtry that keeps Folk
clean, being ſufficient to keep them alſo in Food
and Raiment.</p>
                  <p>But alas! our poor <hi>Iriſh</hi> are wedded to Dirt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Principle. It is with ſome them a Maxim, that
the Way to make Children thrive is to keep them
dirty. And I do verily believe, that the Familiari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
with Dirt, contracted and nouriſhed from their
Infancy, is one great Cauſe of that Sloth which
attends them in every Stage of Life. Were Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
but brought up in an Abhorrence of Dirt, and
obliged to keep themſelves clean, they would
have ſomething to do, whereas now they do
nothing.</p>
                  <p>It is paſt all doubt, that thoſe who are educated
in a ſupine Neglect of all Things, either profitable
or decent, muſt needs contract a Sleepineſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolence,
which doth neceſſarily lead to Poverty,
and every other Diſtreſs that attends it. <hi>Love not
Sleep,</hi> cries <hi>Solomon, leſt thou come to Poverty; open
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0374600900:96"/>
thine Eyes and thou ſhalt be ſatisfied with Bread</hi>
                     <note n="‖" place="bottom">Prov. ch. xx. ver. 13.</note>.
It is therefore greatly to be wiſhed, that you would
perſuade Parents, to inure their Children betimes to
a Habit of Induſtry, as the ſureſt Way to ſhun the
Miſeries that muſt otherwiſe befal them.</p>
                  <p>An early Habit, whether of Sloth, or Diligence,
will not fail to ſhew itſelf throughout the whole
Courſe of a Man's Life. <hi>Train up a Child,</hi> ſaith
the <hi>Wiſeman, in the Way he ſhould go, and when he
is old he will not depart from it</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. ch. xxii. ver. 6.</note>. The firſt Tinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
often leaves ſo deep a Stain as no Afterthought
or Endeavour can waſh out. Hence Sloth in ſome
Minds is Proof againſt all Arguments and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples
whatſoever, all Motives of Intereſt and Duty,
all Impreſſions even of Cold and Hunger. This
Habit rooted in the Child, grows up and adheres
to the Man, producing a general Liſtleſſneſs,
and Averſion from Labour. This I take to be our
great Calamity.</p>
                  <p>For admitting, that ſome of our Squires and
Landlords are Vultures with Iron Bowels, and that
their Hardneſs and Severity is a great Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to the Tenant, who will naturally prefer Want
and Eaſe before Want and Toil; it muſt at the ſame
time be admitted, that neither is the Landlord, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
ſpeaking, ſo hard, nor the Climate ſo ſevere,
nor the Soil ſo ungrateful, as not to anſwer the
Husbandman's Labour, where there is a Spirit of
Induſtry; the Want of which is the true Cauſe of
our national Diſtreſs. Of this there are many evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
Proofs.</p>
                  <p>I have myſelf known a Man, from the loweſt
Condition of Life, without Friends or Education,
not knowing ſo much as to write or read, bred to
no Trade or Calling, by pure Dint of Day-labour,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0374600900:97"/>
Frugality, and Foreſight, to have grown wealthy,
even in this Iſland, and under all the abovementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned
Diſadvantages. And what is done by one, is
poſſible to another.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Holland</hi> a Child five Years old is maintained
by its own Labour; In <hi>Ireland</hi> many Children of
twice that Age do nothing but ſteal, or incumber
the Hearth and Dunghill. This ſhameful Neglect
of Education ſhews itſelf through the whole Courſe
of their Lives, in a matchleſs Sloth bred in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
Bone, and not to be accounted for by any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
Hardſhip or Diſcouragement whatever. It is
the native Colour, if we may ſo ſpeak, and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion
of the People. <hi>Dutch, Engliſh, French,</hi> or
<hi>Flemiſh</hi> cannot match them.</p>
                  <p>Mark an <hi>Iriſhman</hi> at Work in the Field; if a
Coach, or Horſeman go by, he is ſure to ſuſpend
his Labour, and ſtand ſtaring until they are out of
Sight. A Neighbour of mine made it his Remark
in a Journey from <hi>London</hi> to <hi>Briſtol,</hi> that all the
Labourers, of whom he enquired the Road, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
anſwered without looking up, or interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
their Work, except one who ſtood ſtaring and
leaning on his Spade, and him he found to be an
<hi>Iriſhman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a ſhameful Thing and peculiar to this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
to ſee luſty Vagabonds ſtrolling about the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,
and begging without any Pretence to beg.
Ask them why they do not labour to earn their own
Livelihood, they will tell you. They want Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment;
offer to employ them, and they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
your Offer; or, if you get them to work one
Day, you may be ſure not to ſee them the next. I
have known them tdecline even the lighreſt Labour,
that of Hay-making, having at the ſame time
neither Clothes for their Backs, nor Food for their
Bellies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0374600900:98"/>
A ſore Leg is an Eſtate to ſuch a Fellow, and
this may be eaſily got and continued with ſmall
Trouble. Such is their Lazineſs, that rather than
work they will cheriſh a Diſtemper. This I know
to be true, having ſeen more than one Inſtance,
wherein the ſecond Nature ſo far prevailed over the
firſt, that Sloth was preferred to Health. To theſe
Beggars who make much of their Sores, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long
their Diſeaſes, you cannot do a more thankleſs
Office than cure them, except it be to ſhave their
Beards, which conciliate a ſort of Reverence to that
Order of Men.</p>
                  <p>It is indeed a difficult Task to reclaim ſuch Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
from their ſlothful and brutal Manner of Life,
to which they ſeem wedded with an Attachment
that no temporal Motives can conquer; nor is there,
humanly ſpeaking, any Hopes they will mend, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept
their Reſpect for your Leſſons, and Fear of
ſomething beyond the Grave be able to work a
Change in them.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, if I may adviſe, you ſhould in Return
for the Lenity and Indulgence of the Government,
endeavour to make yourſelves uſeful to the Public;
and this will beſt be performed by rouſing your
poor Countrymen from their beloved Sloth. I
ſhall not now diſpute the Truth, or Importance of
other Points, but will venture to ſay, that you may
ſtill find Time to inculcate this Doctrine of an
<hi>honeſt Induſtry,</hi> and that this would by no means be
Time thrown away, if promoting your Country's
Intereſt, and reſcuing ſo many unhappy Wretches
of your Communion from Beggary, or the Gallows,
be thought worth your Pains.</p>
                  <p>It ſhould ſeem you cannot in your Sermons do
better than inveigh againſt Idleneſs, that extenſive
Parent of many Miſeries and many Sins; Idleneſs
the Mother of Hunger and Siſter of Theft; <hi>Idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0374600900:99"/>
which,</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Sirach</hi> aſſures us, <hi>teacheth
many Vices.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſame Doctrine is often preached from the
Gallows. And indeed the Poverty, Nakedneſs,
and Famine which Idleneſs entaileth on her Vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,
do make Men ſo wretched, that they may
well think it better to die than to live ſuch Lives.
Hence a Courage for all villanous Undertakings,
which bringing Men to a ſhameful Death, do then
open their Eyes when they are going to be cloſed
for ever.</p>
                  <p>If you have any Regard (as it is not to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed)
either for the Souls, or Bodies of your People,
or even for your own Intereſt and Credit, you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
fail to inveigh againſt this crying Sin of your
Country. Seeing you are obnoxious to the Laws,
ſhould you not in Prudence try to reconcile your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to the Favour of the Public; and can you do
this more effectually, than by co-operating with
the public Spirit of the Legiſlature, and Men in
Power?</p>
                  <p>Were this but done heartily, would you but <hi>be
inſtant in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon, reprove, rebuke,
exhort</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Tim. ch. iv. ver. 2.</note>, ſuch is the Aſcendent you have gained over
the People, that we might ſoon expect to ſee the
good Effects thereof. We might hope <hi>that our
Garners would be ſoon full, affording all manner of
Store, that our Sheep would bring forth thouſands,
that our Oxen would be ſtrong to labour, that there
would be no breaking in, nor going out,</hi> (no Robbery,
nor Migration nor Bread) <hi>and that there would be no
Complaining in our Streets.</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. cxliv. ver. 13, 14.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſtands you upon to act with Vigour in this
Cauſe, and ſhake off the Shackles of Sloth from
your Countrymen, the rather, becauſe there be
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0374600900:100"/>
ſome who ſurmiſe, that yourſelves have put them
on. Right, or wrong, Men will be apt to judge
of your Doctrines by their Fruits. It will reflect
ſmall Honour on their Teachers, if inſtead of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty
and Induſtry thoſe of your Communion are
peculiarly diſtinguiſhed by the contrary Qualities,
or if the Nation converted by the great and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<hi>Saint Patrick,</hi> ſhould, above ail other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
be ſtigmatiſed and marked out as good for
nothing.</p>
                  <p>I can never ſuppoſe you ſo much your own Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies,
as to be Friends to this odious Sloth. But
were this once aboliſhed, and a laudable Induſtry
introduced in its Stead, it may perhaps be asked,
who are to be Gainers? I anſwer, <hi>your Reverences</hi>
are like to be great Gainers; for every Peny you
now gain, you will gain a Shilling: you would
gain alſo in your Credit: and your Lives would be
more comfortable.</p>
                  <p>You need not be told, how hard it is to take
from Rags and Penury a tolerable Subſiſtence; or
how offenſive to perform the Duties of your Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
amidſt Stench and Naſtineſs; or how much
Things would change for the better, in Proportion
to the Induſtry and Wealth of your Flocks. Duty
as well as Intereſt calls upon you to clothe the
Naked, and feed the Hungry, by perſuading them
to <hi>eat</hi> (in the Apoſtle's Phraſe) <hi>their own Bread,</hi> or,
as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>the Labour of their
own Hands.</hi> By inſpiring your Flocks with a Love
of Induſtry, you will at once ſtrike at the Root of
many Vices, and diſpoſe them to practiſe many
Virtues. This therefore is the readieſt Way to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove
them.</p>
                  <p>Conſult your Superiors. They ſhall tell you the
Doctrine here delivered is a ſound Catholic Doctrine,
not limited to <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but extending to all, and
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0374600900:101"/>
admitted by all, whether <hi>Proteſtants</hi> or <hi>Roman Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholics,
Chriſtians</hi> or <hi>Mahometans, Jews</hi> or <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
And as it is of the greateſt Extent, ſo it is alſo of
the higheſt Importance. <hi>Saint Paul</hi> expreſly ſaith,
<hi>That if any provide not for his own, and eſpecially for
thoſe of his own Houſe, he hath denied the Faith, and
is worſe than an Infidel</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Tim. ch. v. ver. 8.</note>.</p>
                  <p>In vain then do you endeavour to make Men
Orthodox in Points of Faith, if at the ſame time
in the Eyes of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, you ſuffer
them to be worſe than Infidels, than thoſe who
have no Faith at all. There is ſomething it ſeems
worſe than even Infidelity; and to incite and ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulate
you to put away that curſed Thing from
among you, is the Deſign and Aim of this <hi>Addreſs.</hi>
The Doctrine we recommend is an evident Branch
of the Law of Nature; it was taught by Prophets,
inculcated by Apoſtles, encouraged and inforced
by Philoſophers, Legiſlators, and all wiſe States,
in all Ages, and in all Parts of the World. Let
me therefore intreat you to exert yourſelves, <hi>To be
Inſtant in Seaſon, and out of Seaſon, rebuke, reprove,
exhort.</hi> Take all Opportunities to drive the Lion
out of the Way; raiſe your Voices, omit no
Occaſion, public or private, of awakening your
wretched Countrymen from their ſweet Dream of
Sloth.</p>
                  <p>Many ſuſpect your Religion to be the Cauſe of
that notorious Idleneſs, which prevails ſo generally
among the Natives of this Iſland, as if the <hi>Roman
Catholic</hi> Faith was inconſiſtent with an honeſt
Diligence in a Man's Calling. But whoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders
the great Spirit of Induſtry that reigns in
<hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> and even beyond the <hi>Alps,</hi> muſt
acknowledge this to be a groundleſs Suſpicion. In
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0374600900:102"/>
                     <hi>Piedmont</hi> and <hi>Genoa,</hi> in the <hi>Milaneſe</hi> and the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netian
State,</hi> and indeed throughout all <hi>Lombardy,</hi>
how well is the Soil cultivated, and what Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
of Silk, Velvet, Paper, and other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities
flouriſh? The King of <hi>Sardinia</hi> will ſuffer
no idle Hands in his Territories, no Beggar to live
by the Sweat of another's Brow; it has even been
made penal at <hi>Turin,</hi> to relieve a ſtrolling Beggar.
To which I might add, that the Perſon whoſe Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
will be of the greateſt Weight with you,
even the <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf, is at this Day endeavouring
to put new Life into the Trade and Manufactures
of his Country.</p>
                  <p>Though I am in no Secret of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi>
yet I will venture to affirm, that neither <hi>Pope,</hi>
nor <hi>Cardinals,</hi> will be pleaſed to hear, that thoſe of
their Communion are diſtinguiſhed above all others,
by Sloth, Dirt, and Beggary; or be diſpleaſed at
your endeavouring to reſcue them from the Reproach
of ſuch an infamous Diſtinction.</p>
                  <p>The Caſe is as clear as the Sun; what we urge
is inforced by every Motive that can work on a
reaſonable Mind. The Good of your Country,
your own private Intereſt, the Duty of your Func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the Cries and Diſtreſſes of the Poor do with
one Voice call for your Aſſiſtance. And if it is
on all hands allowed to be right and juſt, if agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
both to Reaſon and Religion, if coincident
with the Views both of your temporal and ſpiritual
Superiors, it is to be hoped, <hi>this Addreſs</hi> may find a
favourable Reception, and that a Zeal for diſputed
Points will not hinder your concurring to propagate
ſo plain and uſeful a Doctrine, wherein we are all
agreed.</p>
                  <p>When a Leak is to be ſtopped, or a Fire extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed,
do not all Hands co-operate without Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
of Sect or Party? Or if I am fallen into a
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0374600900:103"/>
Ditch, ſhall I not ſuffer a Man to help me out,
until I have firſt examined his Creed? Or when I
am ſick, ſhall I refuſe the Phyſic, becauſe my Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician
doth, or doth not believe the <hi>Pope</hi>'s Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fas eſt et ab Hoſte doceri.</hi> But in truth, I am no
Enemy to your Perſons, whatever I may think of
your Tenets. On the contrary, I am your ſincere
Well-wiſher. I conſider you as my Countrymen,

November 18, 1749.</head>
                  <p>YOU will very much oblige many of your
conſtant Readers, if you acquaint the Public,
that the ADDRESS you lately publiſhed, intitled,
<hi>A Word to the Wiſe; or An Exhortation to the Roman
Catholic Clergy of Ireland,</hi> was received by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>
Catholic Clergy of <hi>Dublin,</hi> with the higheſt
Senſe of Gratitude; and they take the Liberty, in
this public Manner, to return their ſincere and hearty
Thanks to the worthy Author, aſſuring him, that
they are determined to comply with every Particular
recommended in it, to the utmoſt of their Power.
In every Page it contains a Proof of the Author's
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0374600900:104"/>
extenſive Charity: His Views are only towards the
public Good: The Means he preſcribeth are eaſily
complied with, and his Manner of treating Perſons
in their Circumſtances ſo very ſingular, that they
plainly ſhew the Good Man, the polite Gentleman,
and the true Patriot. All this hath ſo great an
Effect, upon them, that they have already directed
circular Letters to the Pariſh Prieſts of this Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſe,
recommending, in the moſt earneſt Manner,
the Peruſal, and zealous Execution of what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained

publiſhing this in your Journal, the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholic

taken conſiderable Pains to recommend, to
their reſpective Flocks, Induſtry, and a due Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
to their different Trades and Callings, as
an indiſpenſible Duty, and the Means of avoiding
the many Vices and bad Conſequences which
generally attend criminal Poverty and Want. But
the more effectually to prevent theſe Evils, and
remove all Excuſes for Sloth and Idleneſs,
they have, ſeveral Months ago, purſuant to the Example of
many Biſhopricks in <hi>Lombardy, Spain, Naples,</hi> &amp;c.
taken the Steps moſt proper and expedient, in their

be fully anſwered, to the great Advantage of the

in any Inſtance of Humanity, or good Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood
to any of you. For which Reaſon I find
myſelf ſtrongly inclined, at this critical Juncture,
to put you in mind, that you have been treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with a truly Chriſtian Lenity under the preſent
Government, that your Perſons have been protect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
and your Properties ſecured by equal Laws,
and that it would be highly imprudent as well as
ungrateful to forfeit theſe Advantages, by making
yourſelves Tools to the Ambition of foreign Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
who fancy it expedient to raiſe Diſturbances
among us at preſent, but as ſoon as their own Ends
are ſerved, will not fail to abandon you, as they

                     <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0374600900:106"/>
Is it not evident that your true Intereſt conſiſts in
lying ſtill, and waiting the Event, ſince <hi>Ireland</hi>
muſt neceſſarily follow the Fate of <hi>England;</hi> and that
therefore Prudence and Policy preſcribe Quiet to
the Roman Catholics of this Kingdom, who, in
caſe a Change of Hands ſhould not ſucceed, after
your attempting to bring it about, muſt then expect
to be on a worſe Foot than ever?</p>
                  <p>But we will ſuppoſe it ſucceeds to your Wiſh.
What then? Would not this undermine even your
own Intereſts and Fortune, which are often inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woven
with thoſe of your Neighbours? Would
not all thoſe, who have Debts or Money, or other
Effects in the Hands of Proteſtants, be fellow Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers
with them? Would not all thoſe who hold
under the Acts of Settlement, be as liable as Proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants
themſelves to be diſpoſſeſſed by the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors?
Or, can even thoſe who are ſtiled Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors,
flatter themſelves with Hopes of poſſeſſing
the Eſtates which they claim, which, in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood,
would be given to Favourites, (perhaps to
Foreigners) who are near the Perſon, or who fought
the Battles, of their Maſter.</p>
                  <p>Under Proteſtant Governments, thoſe of your
Communion, have formerly enjoyed a greater Share
of the Lands of this Kingdom, and more ample
Privileges. You bore your Part in the Magiſtracy
and the Legiſlature, and could complain of no
Hardſhips on the Score of your Religion. If theſe
Advantages have been ſince impaired or loſt, was
it not by the wrong Meaſures yourſelves took to
enlarge them, in ſeveral ſucceſſive Attempts, each
of which left you weaker and in a worſe Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
than you were before. And this, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
the vaunted Succours of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi>
whoſe vain Efforts in Conjunction with yours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
recoiled on your own Heads, even when
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0374600900:107"/>
your Numbers and Circumſtances were far more
conſiderable than they now are.</p>
                  <p>You all know theſe Things to be true. I appeal
to your own Breaſts. Dear bought Experience
hath taught you, and paſt Times inſtruct the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.
But perhaps you follow Conſcience rather
than Intereſt. Will any Men amongſt you pretend
to plead Conſcience againſt being quiet, or againſt
paying Allegiance and peaceable Submiſſion to a
Proteſtant Prince, which the firſt Chriſtians paid
even to Heathen, and which thoſe of your Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion,
at this Day, pay to Mahometan and to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous
Princes in <hi>Turky</hi> and <hi>China,</hi> and which you
yourſelves have ſo often profeſſed to pay to our
preſent gracious Sovereign? Conſcience is quite
out of the Caſe. And what Man in his Senſes
would engage in a dangerous Courſe, to which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Intereſt doth invite, nor Conſcience oblige
him?</p>
                  <p>I heartily wiſh, that this Advice may be as well
taken, as it is meant, and that you may maturely
conſider your true Intereſt, rather than raſhly repeat
the ſame Errors which you have ſo often repented
of. So recommending you to the merciful Guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance

                  <p>1. EVERY Man, by conſulting his own Heart,
may eaſily know whether he is or is not a
Patriot. But it is not ſo eaſy for the Byſtanders.</p>
                  <p>2. Being loud and vehement either againſt a
Court, or for a Court, is no Proof of Patriotiſm.</p>
                  <p>3. A Man whoſe Paſſion for Money runs high,
bids fair for being no Patriot. And he likewiſe
whoſe Appetite is keen for Power.</p>
                  <p>4. A Native than a Foreigner, a married Man
than a Bachelor, a Believer than an Infidel, have
a better Chance for being Patriots.</p>

                  <p>8. Every Knave is a thorough Knave. And a
thorough Knave is a Knave throughout.</p>
                  <p>9. A Man who hath no Senſe of God or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience:
would you make ſuch a one Guardian to
your Child? if not, why Guardian to the State?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0374600900:109"/>
10. A Sot, a Beaſt, benummed and ſtupified by
Exceſs, is good for nothing, much leſs to make a
Patriot of.</p>
                  <p>11. A Fop or Man of Pleaſure makes but a
ſcurvy Patriot.</p>
                  <p>12. A ſullen, churliſh Man, who loves no Body,
will hardly love his Country.</p>
                  <p>13. The Love of Praiſe and Eſteem may do
ſomething: but to make a true Patriot there muſt
be an inward Senſe of Duty and Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>14. Honeſty (like other Things) grows from its
proper Seed, good Principles early laid in the
Mind.</p>
                  <p>15. To be a real Patriot, a Man muſt conſider
his Countrymen as God's Creatures, and himſelf as
accountable for his acting towards them.</p>
                  <p>16. If <hi>pro Aris et Focis</hi> be the Life of Patriotiſm,
he who hath no Religion or no Home makes a
ſuſpected Patriot.</p>
                  <p>17. No Man perjures himſelf for the ſake of
Conſcience.</p>
                  <p>18. There is an eaſy Way of reconciling Male-contents.—<hi>Sunt
verba &amp; voces quibus hunc lenire
dolorem,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>19. A good Groom will rather ſtroke than ſtrike.</p>
                  <p>20. He who ſaith there is no ſuch Thing as
an honeſt Man, you may be ſure is himſelf a
Knave.</p>
                  <p>21. I have no Opinion of your bumper Patriots.
Some eat, ſome drink, ſome quarrel for their
Country. MODERN PATRIOTISM!</p>
                  <p>22. <hi>Ibycus</hi> is a carking, griping, cloſe-fiſted Fellow.
It is odds that <hi>Ibycus</hi> is not a Patriot.</p>
                  <p>23. We are not to think every clamorous Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranguer,
or every ſplenetic Repiner againſt a Court,
is therefore a Patriot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="115" facs="tcp:0374600900:110"/>
24. A Patriot is one who heartily wiſheth the
public Proſperity, and doth not only wiſh, but alſo
ſtudy and endeavour to promote it.</p>
                  <p>25. Gameſters, Fops, Rakes, Bullies, Stock-jobbers:
alas! what Patriots?</p>
                  <p>26. Some Writers have thought it impoſſible
that Men ſhould be brought to laugh at public
Spirit. Yet this hath been done in the preſent
Age.</p>
                  <p>27. The Patriot aims at his private Good in
the Public. The Knave makes the Public ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient
to his private Intereſt. The former conſiders
himſelf as Part of a Whole, the latter conſiders
himſelf as the Whole.</p>
                  <p>28. There is and ever will be a natural Strife be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
Court and Country. The one will get as
much, and the other give as little as it can. How
muſt the Patriot behave himſelf?</p>
                  <p>29. He gives the neceſſary. If he gives more,
it is with a View of gaining more to his Country.</p>
                  <p>30. A Patriot will never barter the public Money
for his private Gain.</p>
                  <p>31. Moral Evil is never to be committed, phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical
Evil may be incurred, either to avoid a greater
Evil, or to procure a good.</p>
                  <p>32. Where the Heart is right, there is true Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotiſm.</p>
                  <p>33. In your Man of Buſineſs, it is eaſier to meet
with a good Head than a good Heart.</p>
                  <p>34. A Patriot will admit there may be honeſt
Men, and that honeſt Men may differ.</p>
                  <p>35. He that always blames or always praiſes is
no Patriot.</p>
                  <p>36. Were all ſweet and ſneaking Courtiers, or
were all four Malecontents; in either Caſe the
Public would thrive but ill.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0374600900:111"/>
37. A Patriot would hardly wiſh there was no
Contraſt in the State.</p>
                  <p>38. Ferments of the worſt Kind ſucceed to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
Inaction.</p>
                  <p>39. A Man rages, rails and raves; I ſuſpect his
Patriotiſm.</p>
                  <p>40. The fawning Courtier and the ſurly 'Squire
often mean the ſame Thing, each his own Intereſt.</p>
                  <p>41. A Patriot will eſteem no Man for being of
his Party.</p>
                  <p>42. The factious Man is apt to miſtake himſelf
for a Patriot.</p>

                  <p>THE QUERIST was firſt printed in the
Year One Thouſand Seven Hundred and
Thirty-five; ſince which Time, the Face of Things
is ſomewhat changed. In this Edition, ſome Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations
have been made. The three Parts are
publiſhed in one; ſome Few Queries are added, and
many omitted, particularly, of thoſe relating to the
Sketch or Plan of a national Bank; which it may
be time enough to take again in hand, when the
Public ſhall ſeem diſpoſed to make uſe of ſuch an
Expedient. I had determined with myſelf never to
prefix my Name to the Queriſt, but in the laſt
Edition was over-ruled by a Friend, who was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
for purſuing the publicſ Intereſt with as
much Diligence, as others do their own. I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend
the ſame Cenſure on this, that I incurred upon
another Occaſion, for meddling out of my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.
Though to feed the Hungry and clothe
the Naked, by promoting an honeſt Induſtry, will,
perhaps, be deemed no improper Employment for
a Clergyman, who ſtill thinks himſelf a Member
of the Commonwealth. As the Sum of human
Happineſs is ſuppoſed to conſiſt in the Goods of
Mind, Body and Fortune, I would fain make my
Studies of ſome Uſe to Mankind, with regard to
each of theſe three Particulars, and hope it will not
be thought faulty or indecent in any Man, of what
Profeſſion ſoever, to offer his Mite towards, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving
the Manners, Health and Proſperity of his
Fellow-creatures.</p>

QUERIST.</head>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Qu.</hi> 1. WHETHER there ever was, is, or
will be, an induſtrious Nation poor,
or an idle rich?</p>
                  <p>2. Whether a People can be called poor, where
the common Sort are well fed, clothed and lodged?</p>
                  <p>3. Whether the Drift and Aim of every wiſe
State ſhould not be, to encourage Induſtry in its
Members? And, whether thoſe, who employ neither
Heads nor Hands for the common Benefit, deſerve
not to be expelled like Drones out of a well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
State?</p>
                  <p>4. Whether the four Elements, and Man's Labour
therein, be not the true Source of Wealth?</p>
                  <p>5. Whether Money be not only ſo far uſeful, as
it ſtirreth up Induſtry, enabling Men mutually to
participate the Fruits of each others Labour?</p>
                  <p>6. Whether any other Means, equally conducing
to excite and circulate the Induſtry of Mankind,
may not be as uſeful as Money?</p>
                  <p>7. Whether the real End and Aim of Men be
not Power? And whether he who could have every
Thing elſe at his Wiſh or Will, would value
Money?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="tcp:0374600900:115"/>
8. Whether the public Aim in every well go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
State be not, that each Member, according
to his juſt Pretenſions and Induſtry, ſhould have
Power?</p>
                  <p>9. Whether Power be not referred to Action; and
whether Action doth not follow Appetite or Will?</p>
                  <p>10. Whether Faſhion doth not create Appetites;
and whether the prevailing Will of a Nation is not
the Faſhion?</p>
                  <p>11. Whether the Current of Induſtry and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce
be not determined by this prevailing Will?</p>
                  <p>12. Whether it be not owing to Cuſtom, that
the Faſhions are agreeable?</p>
                  <p>13. Whether it may not concern the Wiſdom
of the Legiſlature to interpoſe in the making of
Faſhions; and not leave an Affair of ſo great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence,
to the Management of Women and Fops,
Taylors and Vintners?</p>
                  <p>14. Whether reaſonable Faſhions are a greater
Reſtraint on Freedom than thoſe which are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable?</p>
                  <p>15. Whether a general good Taſte in a People
would not greatly conduce to their thriving? And
whether an uneducated Gentry be not the greateſt
of national Evils?</p>
                  <p>16. Whether Cuſtoms and Faſhions do not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
the Place of Reaſon, in the Vulgar of all Ranks?
Whether, therefore, it doth not very much import
that they ſhould be wiſely framed?</p>
                  <p>17. Whether the imitating thoſe Neighbours in
our Faſhions, to whom we bear no Likeneſs in our
Circumſtances, be not one Cauſe of Diſtreſs to this
Nation?</p>
                  <p>18. Whether frugal Faſhions in the upper Rank,
and comfortable Living in the lower, be not the
Means to multiply Inhabitants?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:0374600900:116"/>
19. Whether the Bulk of our <hi>Iriſh</hi> Natives are
not kept from thriving, by that Cynical Content in
Dirt and Beggary, which they poſſeſs to a Degree
beyond any other People in Chriſtendom?</p>
                  <p>20. Whether the creating of Wants be not the
likelieſt Way to produce Induſtry in a People?
And whether, if our Peaſants were accuſtomed to
eat Beef and wear Shoes, they would not be more
induſtrious?</p>
                  <p>21. Whether other Things being given, as Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate,
Soil, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Wealth be not proportioned
to the Induſtry, and this to the Circulation of Credit,
be the Credit circulated or transferred by what
Marks or Tokens ſoever?</p>
                  <p>22. Whether, therefore, leſs Money, ſwiftly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culating,
be not, in effect, equivalent to more
Money ſlowly circulating? Or, whether, if the
Circulation be reciprocally as the Quantity of Coin,
the Nation can be a Loſer?</p>
                  <p>23. Whether Money is to be conſidered as hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
an intrinſic Value, or as being a Commodity,
a Standard, a Meaſure, or a Pledge, as is variouſly
ſuggeſted by Writers? And whether the true Idea
of Money, as ſuch, be not altogether that of a
Ticket or Counter?</p>
                  <p>24. Whether the Value or Price of Things, be
not a compounded Proportion, directly as the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
and reciprocally as the Plenty?</p>
                  <p>25. Whether the Terms Crown, Livre, Pound
Sterling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are not to be conſidered as Exponents
or Denominations of ſuch Proportion? And whether
Gold, Silver and Paper, are not Tickets or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
for Reckoning, Recording, and Transferring
thereof?</p>
                  <p>26. Whether the Denominations being retained,
although the Bullion were gone, Things might not
nevertheleſs be rated, bought and ſold, Induſtry
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0374600900:117"/>
promoted, and a Circulation of Commerce main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained?</p>
                  <p>27. Whether an equal raiſing of all Sorts of
Gold, Silver, and Copper Coin, can have any
Effect in bringing Money into the Kingdom? And
whether altering the Proportions between the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
Sorts, can have any other Effect, but multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
one Kind and leſſening another, without any
Increaſe of the Sum total?</p>
                  <p>28. Whether arbitrary changing the Denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
of Coin, be not a public Cheat?</p>
                  <p>29. What makes a wealthy People? Whether
Mines of Gold and Silver are capable of doing this?
And whether the Negroes amidſt the Gold Sands of
<hi>Afric,</hi> are not poor and deſtitute?</p>
                  <p>30. Whether there be any Virtue in Gold or
Silver, other than as they ſet People at Work, or
create Induſtry?</p>
                  <p>31. Whether it be not the Opinion or Will of
the People, exciting them to Induſtry, that truly
enricheth a Nation? And whether this doth not
principally depend on the Means for counting, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring,
and preſerving Power, that is, Property of
all Kinds?</p>
                  <p>32. Whether if there was no Silver or Gold in
the Kingdom, our Trade might not nevertheleſs
ſupply Bills of Exchange, ſufficient to anſwer the
Demands of Abſentees in <hi>England.</hi> or elſewhere?</p>
                  <p>33. Whether current Bank-Notes may not be
deemed Money? And whether they are not actually
the greater Part of the Money of this Kingdom?</p>
                  <p>34. Provided the Wheels move, whether it is
not the ſame Thing, as to the Effect of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine,
be this done by the Force of Wind, or Water, or
Animals?</p>
                  <p>35. Whether Power to command the Induſtry
of others be not real Wealth? And whether Money
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0374600900:118"/>
be not in truth, Tickets or Tokens for convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and recording ſuch Power, and whether it be
of great Conſequence what Materials the Tickets
are made of?</p>
                  <p>36. Whether Trade, either foreign or domeſtic,
be in truth any more than this Commerce of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry?</p>
                  <p>37. Whether to promote, transfer, and ſecure
this Commerce, and this Property in human Labour,
or, in other words, this Power, be not the ſole
Means of enriching a People, and how far this may
be done independently of Gold and Silver?</p>
                  <p>38. Whether it were not wrong to ſuppoſe Land
itſelf to be Wealth? And whether the Induſtry of
the People is not firſt to be conſidered, as that
which conſtitutes Wealth, which makes even Land
and Silver to be Wealth, neither of which would
have any Value, but as Means and Motives to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry?</p>
                  <p>39. Whether in the Waſtes of <hi>America,</hi> a Man
might not poſſeſs twenty Miles ſquare of Land, and
yet want his Dinner, or a Coat to his Back?</p>
                  <p>40. Whether a fertile Land, and the Induſtry
of its Inhabitants, would not prove inexhauſtible
Funds of real Wealth, be the Counters for convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and recording thereof what you will, Paper,
Gold, or Silver?</p>
                  <p>41. Whether a ſingle Hint be ſufficient to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
a Prejudice? And whether even obvious
Truths will not ſometimes bear repeating?</p>
                  <p>42. Whether if human Labour be the true
Source of Wealth, it doth not follow that Idleneſs
ſhould of all Things be diſcouraged in a wiſe State?</p>
                  <p>43. Whether even Gold, or Silver, if they ſhould
leſſen the Induſtry of its Inhabitants, would not be
ruinous to a Country? And whether <hi>Spain</hi> be not
an Inſtance of this?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="124" facs="tcp:0374600900:119"/>
44. Whether the Opinion of Men, and their
Induſtry conſequent thereupon, be not the true
Wealth of <hi>Holland,</hi> and not the Silver ſuppoſed to
be depoſited in the Bank at <hi>Amſterdam?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>45. Whether there is in truth any ſuch Treaſure
lying dead? And whether it be of great Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to the Public, that it ſhould be real, rather
than notional?</p>
                  <p>46. Whether in order to underſtand the true
Nature of Wealth and Commerce, it would not
be right to conſider a Ship's Crew caſt upon a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert
Iſland, and by degrees forming themſelves to
Buſineſs and civil Life, while Induſtry begot Credit,
and Credit moved to Induſtry?</p>
                  <p>47. Whether ſuch Men would not all ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
to Work? Whether they would not ſubſiſt
by the mutual Participation of each other's Induſtry?
Whether when one Man had in his Way procured
more than he could conſume, he would not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change
his Superfluities to ſupply his Wants?
Whether this muſt not produce Credit? Whether
to facilitate theſe Conveyances, to record and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate
this Credit, they would not ſoon agree on
certain Tallies, Tokens, Tickets, or Counters?</p>
                  <p>48. Whether Reflexion in the better Sort might
not ſoon remedy our Evils? And whether our real
Defect be not in a wrong Way of Thinking?</p>
                  <p>49. Whether it would not be an unhappy Turn
in our Gentlemen, if they ſhould take more Thought
to create an Intereſt to themſelves in this or that
County, or Borough, than to promote the real In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
of their Country?</p>
                  <p>50. Whether if a Man builds a Houſe he doth
not in the firſt Place provide a Plan which governs
his Work? And ſhall the Public act without an
End, a View, a Plan?</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="125" facs="tcp:0374600900:120"/>
51. Whether by how much the leſs particular
Folk think for themſelves, the Public be not ſo
much the more obliged to think for them?</p>
                  <p>52. Whether ſmall Gains be not the Way to
great Profit? And if our Tradeſmen are Beggars,
whether they may not thank themſelves for it?</p>
                  <p>53. Whether ſome Way might not be found for
making Criminals uſeful in public Works, inſtead
of ſending them either to <hi>America,</hi> or to the other
World?</p>
                  <p>54. Whether we may not, as well as other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
contrive Employment for them? And
whether Servitude, Chains, and hard Labour, for a
Term of Years, would not be a more diſcouraging,
as well as a more adequate Puniſhment for Felons,
than even Death itſelf?</p>
                  <p>55. Whether there are not ſuch Things in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
as bettering Houſes, for bringing young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen
to Order? And whether ſuch an Inſtitution
would be uſeleſs among us?</p>
                  <p>56. Whether it be true, that the Poor in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>
have no Reſource but their own Labour, and
yet there are no Beggars in their Streets?</p>
                  <p>57. Whether he whoſe Luxury conſumeth foreign
Products, and whoſe Induſtry produceth nothing
domeſtic to exchange for them, is not ſo far forth
injurious to his Country?</p>
                  <p>58. Whether Neceſſity is not to be hearkened
to before Convenience, and Convenience before
Luxury?</p>
                  <p>59. Whether to provide plentifully for the Poor,
be not feeding the Root, the Subſtance whereof will

Whether the greateſt Demand for a Thing be not

                  <p>584. Whether in every wiſe State the Faculties

ſtill continue in much the ſame Ignorance and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bariſm,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0374600900:185"/>
in which we found them above a hundred
Years ago.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall therefore venture to ſubmit my Thoughts
upon a Point, that I have long conſidered, to better
Judgments, in Hopes that any Expedient will be
favourably hearkened to, which is propoſed for the
Remedy of theſe Evils. Now, in order to effect
this, it ſhould ſeem the natural proper Method, to
provide, in the firſt Place, a conſtant Supply of
worthy Clergymen for the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Churches in thoſe
Parts; and in the ſecond Place, a like conſtant
Supply of zealous Miſſionaries, well fitted for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagating
Chriſtianity among the Savages.</p>
                  <p>For though the ſureſt Means to reform the
Morals, and ſoften the Behaviour of Men, be, to
preach to them the pure uncorrupt Doctrine of the
Goſpel, yet it cannot be denied, that the Succeſs of
preaching dependeth in good meaſure on the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
and Skill of the Preacher: Foraſmuch as
Mankind are more apt to copy Characters than to
practiſe Precepts, and foraſmuch as Argument, to
attain its full Strength, doth not leſs require the Life
of Zeal, than the Weight of Reaſon; and the ſame
Doctrine, which maketh great Impreſſion, when
delivered with Decency and Addreſs, loſeth very
much of its Force by paſſing through aukward or
unskilful Hands.</p>
                  <p>Now the Clergy ſent over to <hi>America</hi> have proved,
too many of them, very meanly qualified both in
Learning and Morals for the Diſcharge of their
Office. And indeed little can be expected from the
Example or Inſtruction of thoſe, who quit their
native Country on no other Motive, than that they
are not able to procure a Livelihood in it, which is
known to be often the Caſe.</p>
                  <p>To this may be imputed the ſmall Care that hath
been taken to convert the Negroes of our Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0374600900:186"/>
who, to the Infamy of <hi>England,</hi> and Scandal
of the World, continue Heathen under Chriſtian
Maſters, and in Chriſtian Countries. Which could
never be, if our Planters were rightly inſtructed
and made ſenſible, that they diſappointed their own
Baptiſm by denying it to thoſe who belong to them:
That it would be of Advantage to their Affairs, to
have Slaves who ſhould <hi>obey in all Things their
Maſters according to the Fleſh, not with Eye-ſervice
as Men-pleaſers, but in Singleneſs of Heart as fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
God:</hi> That Goſpel Liberty conſiſts with temporal
Servitude; and that their Slaves would only become
better Slaves by being Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>And though it be allowed that ſome of the Clergy
in our Colonies have approved themſelves Men of
Merit, it will at the ſame time be allowed, that the
moſt zealous and able Miſſionary from <hi>England</hi> muſt
find himſelf but ill qualified for converting the
<hi>American</hi> Heathen, if we conſider the Difference of
Language, their wild Way of Living, and above
all, the great Jealouſy and Prejudice which ſavage
Nations have towards Foreigners, or Innovations
introduced by them.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Conſiderations make it evident, that a
College or Seminary in thoſe Parts is very much
wanted; and therefore the providing ſuch a Semi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
is earneſtly propoſed and recommended to all
thoſe, who have it in their Power to
contribute to ſo good a Work. By this, two Ends would be
obtained.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, the Youth of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantations
might be themſelves fitted for the Miniſtry; and
Men of Merit would be then glad to fill the
Churches of their native Country, which are now
a Drain for the very Dregs and Refuſe of ours.</p>
                  <p>At preſent, there are, I am told, many Churches
vacant in our Plantations, and many very ill ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied;
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0374600900:187"/>
nor can all the Vigilance and Wiſdom of
that great Prelate, whoſe peculiar Care it is, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
this, ſo long as the aforeſaid Churches are
ſupplied from <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſupplied they muſt be, with ſuch as can be
picked up in <hi>England</hi> or <hi>Ireland,</hi> until a Nurſery of
Learning for the Education of the Natives is
founded. This indeed might provide a conſtant
Succeſſion of learned and exemplary Paſtors; and
what Effect this muſt be ſuppoſed to have on their
Flocks, I need not ſay.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Children of ſavage <hi>Americans,</hi>
brought up in ſuch a Seminary, and well inſtructed
in Religion and Learning, might make the ableſt
and propereſt Miſſionaries for ſpreading the Goſpel
among their Countrymen; who would be leſs apt
to ſuſpect, and readier to embrace a Doctrine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
by Neighbours or Relations, Men of
their own Blood and Language, than if it were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by Foreigners, who would not improbably be
thought to have Deſigns on the Liberty or Property
of their Converts.</p>
                  <p>The young <hi>Americans</hi> neceſſary for this Purpoſe,
may in the Beginning be procured, either by
peaceable Methods from thoſe ſavage Nations,
which border on our Colonies, and are in Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
with us, or by taking captive the Children of
our Enemies.</p>
                  <p>It is propoſed to admit into the aforeſaid College
only ſuch Savages as are under ten Years of Age,
before evil Habits have taken a deep root; and yet
not ſo early as to prevent retaining their Mother
Tongue, which ſhould be preſerved by Intercourſe
among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>It is further propoſed, to ground theſe young
<hi>Americans</hi> thoroughly in Religion and Morality,
and to give them a good Tincture of other Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0374600900:188"/>
particularly of Eloquence, Hiſtory, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
Mathematicks; to which it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
to add ſome Skill in Phyſic.</p>
                  <p>If there were a yearly Supply of ten or a dozen
ſuch Miſſionaries ſent abroad into their reſpective
Countries, after they had received the Degree of
Maſter of Arts in the aforeſaid College, and Holy
Orders in <hi>England,</hi> (till ſuch Time as Epiſcopacy
be eſtabliſhed in thoſe Parts) it is hardly to be doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
but, in a little time, the World would ſee
good and great Effects thereof.</p>
                  <p>For, to any conſidering Man, the employing
<hi>American</hi> Miſſionaries for the Converſion of <hi>America,</hi>
will, of all others, appear the moſt likely Method
to ſucceed; eſpecially if care be taken, that, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the whole Courſe of their Education, an Eye
ſhould be had to their Miſſion; that they ſhould
be taught betimes to conſider themſelves as trained
up in that ſole View, without any other Proſpect
of Proviſion, or Employment; that a Zeal for
Religion, and Love of their Country, ſhould be
early and conſtantly inſtilled into their Minds, by
repeated Lectures and Admonitions; that they
ſhould not only be incited by the common Topics
of Religion and Nature, but farther animated and
inflamed by the great Examples in paſt Ages, of
public Spirit and Virtue, to reſcue their Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
from their ſavage Manners, to a Life of Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
and Religion.</p>
                  <p>If his Majeſty would graciouſly pleaſe to grant a
Charter for a College to be erected in a proper
Place for theſe Uſes, it is to be hoped a Fund may
be ſoon raiſed, by the Contribution of well diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
Perſons, ſufficient for building and endowing
the ſame. For as the neceſſary Expence would be
ſmall, ſo there are Men of Religion and Humanity
in <hi>England,</hi> who would be pleaſed to ſee any Deſign
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0374600900:189"/>
ſet forward for the Glory of God and the Good of
Mankind.</p>
                  <p>A ſmall Expence would ſuffice to ſubſiſt and
educate the <hi>American</hi> Miſſionaries in a plain ſimple
Manner, ſuch as might make it eaſy for them to
return to the coarſe and poor Methods of Life in
uſe among their Countrymen; and nothing can
contribute more to leſſen this Expence, than a ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
Choice of the Situation, where the Seminary
is to ſtand.</p>
                  <p>Many Things ought to be conſidered in the
Choice of a Situation. It ſhould be in a good
Air; in a Place where Proviſions are cheap and
plenty; where an Intercourſe might eaſily be kept
up with all Parts of <hi>America</hi> and the Iſlands; in a
Place of Security, not expoſed to the Inſults of
Pirates, Savages, or other Enemies; where there
is no great Trade, which might tempt the Readers
or Fellows of the College to become Merchants,
to the Neglect of their proper Buſineſs; where
there are neither Riches nor Luxury to divert, or
leſſen their Application, or to make them uneaſy
and diſſatisfied with a homely frugal Subſiſtence;
laſtly, where the Inhabitants, if ſuch a Place may be
found, are noted for Innocence and Simplicity of
Manners. I need not ſay of how great Importance
this Point would be toward forming the Morals of
young Students, and what mighty Influence it muſt
have on the Miſſion.</p>
                  <p>It is evident the College long ſince projected in
<hi>Barbadoes,</hi> would be defective in many of theſe
Particulars; for though it may have its Uſe among
the Inhabitants, yet a Place of ſo high Trade, ſo
much Wealth and Luxury, and ſuch diſſolute
Morals, (not to mention the great Price and Scarcity
of Proviſions;) muſt at firſt Sight ſeem a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
Situation for a general Seminary intended
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0374600900:190"/>
for the forming Miſſionaries, and educating Youth
in Religion and Sobriety of Manners. The ſame
Objections lie againſt the neighbouring Iſlands.</p>
                  <p>And if we conſider the Accounts given of their
Avarice and Licentiouſneſs, their Coldneſs in the
Practice of Religion, and their Averſion from
propagating it, (which appears in the withholding
their Slaves from Baptiſm) it is to be feared, that
the Inhabitants in the populous Parts of our Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
on the Continent are not much fitter, than
thoſe in the Iſlands abovementioned, to influence
or aſſiſt ſuch a Deſign. And as to the more remote
and leſs frequented Parts, the Difficulty of being
ſupplied with Neceſſaries, the Danger of being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
to the Inroads of Savages, and above all, the
Want of Intercourſe with other Places, render
them improper Situations for a Seminary of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
and Learning.</p>
                  <p>It will not be amiſs to inſert here an Obſervation
I remember to have ſeen in an Abſtract of the
Proceedings, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> annexed to the Dean of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi>'s
Sermon, before the Society for the Propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation
of the Goſpel in foreign Parts; that the
ſavage <hi>Indians,</hi> who live on the Continent, will not
ſuffer their Children to learn <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Dutch,</hi> leſt
they ſhould be debauched by converſing with
their <hi>European</hi> Neighbours; which is a melancholy
but ſtrong Confirmation of the Truth of what hath
been now advanced.</p>
                  <p>A general Intercourſe and Correſpondence with
all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies, both on the Iſlands and
the Continent, and with other Parts of <hi>America,</hi>
hath been before laid down, as a neceſſary Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,
the Reaſon whereof is very evident. But
this Circumſtance is hardly to be found. For on
the Continent, where there are neither Inns, nor
Carriages, nor Bridges over the Rivers, there is
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0374600900:191"/>
no travelling by Land between diſtant Places.
And the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Settlements are reputed to extend
along the Sea-coaſt for the Space of fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
Miles. It is therefore plain, there can be
no convenient Communication between them,
otherwiſe than by Sea; no Advantage therefore,
in this Point, can be gained by ſettling on the
Continent.</p>
                  <p>There is another Conſideration which equally
regards the Continent and Iſlands, that the general
Courſe of Trade and Correſpondence lies from all
thoſe Colonies to <hi>Great-Britain</hi> alone: Whereas,
for our preſent Purpoſe, it would be neceſſary to
pitch upon a Place, if ſuch could be found, which
maintains a conſtant Intercourſe with all the other
Colonies, and whoſe Commerce lies chiefly or alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
(not in <hi>Europe,</hi> but) in <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is but one Spot that I can find, to which
this Circumſtance agrees; and that is the Iſles of
<hi>Bermuda,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>The Summer Iſlands.</hi> Theſe
having no rich Commodity or Manufacture, ſuch as
Sugar, Tobacco, or the like, wherewithal to trade
to <hi>England,</hi> are obliged to become Carriers for
<hi>America,</hi> as the <hi>Dutch</hi> are for <hi>Europe.</hi> The <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudans</hi>
are excellent Shipwrights and Sailors, and
have a great Number of very good Sloops, which
are always paſſing and repaſſing from all Parts of
<hi>America.</hi> They drive a conſtant Trade to the
Iſlands of <hi>Jamaica, Barbadoes, Antego,</hi> &amp;c. with
Butter, Onions, Cabbages, and other Roots and
Vegetables, which they have in great Plenty and
Perfection. They have alſo ſome ſmall Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factures
of Joiners Work and Matting, which
they export to the Plantations on the Continent.
Hence <hi>Bermudan</hi> Sloops are oftner ſeen in the Ports
of <hi>America,</hi> than any other. And indeed, by the
beſt Information I could get, it appears they are the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:0374600900:192"/>
only People of all the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Plantations, who hold
a general Correſpondence with the reſt.</p>
                  <p>And, as the Commerce of <hi>Bermuda</hi> renders it a
very fit Place, wherein to erect a Seminary, ſo
likewiſe doth its Situation, it being placed between
our Plantations on the Continent, and thoſe in the
Iſles, ſo as equally to reſpect both. To
which may be added, that it lies in the Way of Veſſels
paſſing from <hi>America</hi> to <hi>Great-Britain;</hi> all which
makes it plain, that the Youth, to be educated in
a Seminary placed in the <hi>Summer Iſlands,</hi> would
have frequent Opportunities of going thither and
correſponding with their Friends. It muſt indeed
be owned, that ſome will be obliged to go a long
Way to any one Place, which we ſuppoſe reſorted
to, from all Parts of our Plantations; but if we
were to look out a Spot the neareſt approaching
to an equal Diſtance from all the reſt, I believe it
would be found to be <hi>Bermuda.</hi> It remains, that
we ſee whether it enjoys the other Qualities or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions
laid down as well as this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Summer Iſlands</hi> are ſituated near the Latitude
of thirty three Degrees; no Part of the World
enjoys a purer Air, or a more temperate Climate,
the great Ocean which environs them, at once mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derating
the Heat of the South Winds, and the
Severity of the North-Weſt. Such a Latitude on
the Continent might be thought too hot; but the
Air in <hi>Bermuda</hi> is perpetually fanned and kept cool
by Sea-breezes, which render the Weather the moſt
healthy and delightful that could be wiſhed, being,
(as is affirmed by Perſons who have long lived there)
of one equal Tenour almoſt throughout the whole
Year, like the latter End of a fine <hi>May;</hi> inſomuch
that it is reſorted to as the <hi>Montpellier</hi> of <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor are theſe Iſles (if we may believe the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
given of them) leſs remarkable for Plenty
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:0374600900:193"/>
than for Health; there being, beſides Beef, Mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
and Fowl, great Abundance of Fruits, and
Garden-ſtuff of all Kinds in Perfection: To this,
if we add the great Plenty and Variety of Fiſh,
which is every Day taken on their Coaſts, it would
ſeem, that a Seminary could no where be ſupplied
with better Proviſions, or cheaper than here.</p>
                  <p>About forty Years ago, upon cutting down many
tall Cedars that ſheltered their Orange-trees from
the North-Weſt Wind, (which ſometimes blows
even there, ſo as to affect that delicate Plant)
great Part of their Orange Plantations ſuffered; but
other Cedars are ſince grown up, and no doubt, a
little Induſtry would again produce as great Plenty
of Oranges as ever was there heretofore. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
this, becauſe ſome have inferred from the
preſent Scarcity of that Fruit, for which <hi>Bermuda</hi>
was once ſo famous, that there hath been a change
in the Soil and Climate for the worſe. But this,
as hath been obſerved, proceeded from another
Cauſe, which is now in great meaſure taken away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bermuda</hi> is a Cluſter of ſmall Iſlands, which lie
in a very narrow Compaſs, containing in all, not
quite twenty thouſand Acres. This Groupe of Iſles
is (to uſe Mr. <hi>Waller</hi>'s Expreſſion) walled round
with Rocks, which render them inacceſſible to Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rates
or Enemies; there being but two narrow
Entrances, both well guarded by Forts. It would
therefore be impoſſible to find any where, a more
ſecure Retreat for Students.</p>
                  <p>The Trade of <hi>Bermuda</hi> conſiſts only in
Gardenſtuff, and ſome poor Manufactures, principally of
Cedar and the Palmetto-leaf. <hi>Bermuda</hi> Hats are
worn by our Ladies: They are made of a Sort of
Mat, or (as they call it) Platting made of the Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metto-leaf,
which is the only Commodity that I
can find exported from <hi>Bermuda</hi> to <hi>Great-Britain;</hi>
                     <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0374600900:194"/>
and as there is no Proſpect; of making a Fortune by
this ſmall Trade, ſo it cannot be ſuppoſed to tempt
the Fellows of the College to engage in it, to the
Neglect of their peculiar Buſineſs, which might
poſſibly be the Caſe elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Such as their Trade is, ſuch is their Wealth;
the Inhabitants being much poorer than the other
Colonies, who do not fail to deſpiſe them upon
that Account. But if they have leſs Wealth, they
have withal leſs Vice and expenſive Folly than
their Neighbours. They are repreſented as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented,
plain, innocent Sort of People, free from
Avarice and Luxury, as well as the other Corruptions
that attend thoſe Vices.</p>
                  <p>I am alſo informed, that they are more conſtant
Attendants on divine Service, more kind and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectful
to their Paſtor (when they have one) and
ſhew much more Humanity to their Slaves, and
Charity to one another, than is obſerved among
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in the other Plantations: One Reaſon
of this may be, that condemned Criminals, being
employed in the Manufactures of Sugar and To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bacco,
were never tranſported thither. But, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
be the Cauſe, the Facts are atteſted by a
Clergyman of good Credit, who lived long among
them.</p>
                  <p>Among a People of this Character, and in a
Situation thus circumſtantiated, it would ſeem that
a Seminary of Religion and Learning might very
fitly be placed. The Correſpondence with other
Parts of <hi>America,</hi> the Goodneſs of the Air, the
Plenty and Security of the Place, the Frugality and
Innocence of the Inhabitants, all conſpiring to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
ſuch a Deſign. Thus much at leaſt is evident,
that young Students would be there leſs liable to
be corrupted in their Morals; and the governing
Part would be eaſier, and better contented with a
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0374600900:195"/>
ſmall Stipend, and a retired academical Life, in a
Corner from whence Avarice and Luxury are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
than they can be ſuppoſed to be in the
midſt of a full Trade and great Riches, attended
with all that high Living and Parade which our
Planters affect, and which, as well as all faſhionable
Vices, ſhould be far removed from the Eyes of
the young <hi>American</hi> Miſſionaries, who are to lead
a Life of Poverty and Self-denial among their
Countrymen.</p>
                  <p>After all, it muſt be acknowledged, that though
every Thing elſe ſhould concur with our Wiſhes,
yet if a Set of good Governors and Teachers be
wanting, who are acquainted with the Methods of
Education, and have the Zeal and Ability requiſite
for carrying on a Deſign of this Nature, it would
certainly come to nothing.</p>
                  <p>An Inſtitution of this Kind ſhould be ſet on
Foot by Men of Prudence, Spirit and Zeal, as well
as competent Learning, who ſhould be led to it
by other Motives than the Neceſſity of picking up
a Maintenance. For upon this View, what Man of
Merit can be ſuppoſed to quit his native Country,
and take up with a poor College Subſiſtence in
another Part of the World, where there are ſo
many conſiderable Pariſhes actually void, and ſo
many others ill ſupplied for want of fitting In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbents?
Is it likely, that Fellowſhips of fifty
or ſixty Pounds a Year ſhould tempt abler or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier
Men, than Benefices of many Times their Value?</p>
                  <p>And except able and worthy Men do firſt engage
in this Affair, with a Reſolution to exert themſelves
in forming the Manners of the Youth, and giving
them a proper Education, it is evident the Miſſion
and the College will be but in a very bad Way.
This Inconvenience ſeems the moſt difficult to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0374600900:196"/>
againſt, and, if not provided againſt, it will
be the moſt likely to obſtruct any Deſign of this
Nature. So true it is, that where Ignorance or ill
Manners once take place in a Seminary, they are
ſure to be handed down in a Succeſſion of illiterate
or worthleſs Men.</p>
                  <p>But this Apprehenſion, which ſeems ſo well
grounded, that a College in any Part of <hi>America,</hi>
would either lie unprovided, or be worſe provided
than their Churches are, hath no Place in <hi>Bermuda;</hi>
there being at this Time ſeveral Gentlemen, in all
Reſpects very well qualified, and in Poſſeſſion of
good Preferments, and fair Proſpects at home, who
having ſeriouſly conſidered the great Benefit that
may ariſe to the Church and to Mankind from ſuch
an Undertaking, are ready to engage in it, and to
dedicate the Remainder of their Lives to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing
the Youth of <hi>America,</hi> and proſecuting
their own Studies upon a very moderate Subſiſtence
in a Retirement, ſo ſweet and ſo ſecure, and every
way ſo well fitted for a Place of Education and
Study, as <hi>Bermuda.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much the Writer hereof thought himſelf
obliged to ſay of his Aſſociates: For himſelf, he
can only ſay, that as he values no Preferment upon
Earth, ſo much as that of being employed in
the Execution of this Deſign; ſo he hopes to
make up for other Defects, by the Sincerity of his
Endeavours.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Europe,</hi> the Proteſtant Religion hath of late
Years conſiderably loſt ground, and <hi>America</hi> ſeems
the likelieſt Place, wherein to make up for what
hath been loſt in <hi>Europe,</hi> provided the proper
Methods are taken: Otherwiſe the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onaries
in the South, and the <hi>French</hi> in the North,
are making ſuch a Progreſs, as may one Day
ſpread the Religion of <hi>Rome,</hi> and with it the uſual

Hatred to Proteſtants, throughout all the ſavage
Nations in <hi>America;</hi> which would probably end in
the utter Extirpation of our Colonies, on the Safety
whereof depends ſo much of the Nation's Wealth,
and ſo conſiderable a Branch of his Majeſty's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</p>
                  <p>But if this Scheme were purſued, it would in
all probability have much greater Influence on the
<hi>Americans,</hi> than the utmoſt Endeavours of Popiſh
Emiſſaries can poſſibly have; who from the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
of Country, Language and Intereſt, muſt
lie under far greater Difficulties and Diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
than thoſe, whom we ſuppoſe yearly ſent
out from <hi>Bermuda</hi> to preach among their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen.</p>
                  <p>It cannot indeed be denied, that the great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of poor Regulars, inured to hard Living, and
brought up in an implicit Obedience to their Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors,
hath hitherto given the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>
in regard to her Miſſions, great Advantage over
the Reformed Churches. But from what hath been
ſaid, it is, I think, evident, that this Advantage
may be over-balanced by our employing <hi>American</hi>
Miſſionaries.</p>
                  <p>Nor is the Honour of the Crown, Nation, and
Church of <hi>England</hi> unconcerned in this Scheme;
which, it is to be hoped, will remove the Reproach,
we have ſo long lain under, that we fall as far ſhort
of our Neighbours of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Communion in
Zeal for propagating Religion, as we ſurpaſs them
in the Soundneſs and Purity of it. And at the ſame
time, that the doing what may be ſo eaſily done,
takes away our Reproach; it will caſt no ſmall
Luſtre on his Majeſty's Reign, and derive a Bleſſing
from Heaven on his Adminiſtration and thoſe who
live under the Influence thereof.</p>

Men of narrow Minds have a peculiar Talent at
Objection, being never at a loſs for ſomething to
ſay againſt whatſoever is not of their own propoſing.
And perhaps, it will be ſaid in Oppoſition to this
Propoſal, that if we thought ourſelves capable of
gaining Converts to the Church, we ought to begin
with Infidels, Papiſts, and Diſſenters of all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations
at home, and to make Proſelytes of
theſe before we think of Foreigners; and that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
our Scheme is againſt Duty. And further,
that conſidering the great Oppoſition, which is
found on the Part of thoſe who differ from us at
home, no Succeſs can be expected among Savages
abroad, and that therefore it is againſt Reaſon and
Experience.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to this I ſay, that Religion like Light
is imparted without being diminiſhed. That what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
is done abroad, can be no Hindrance or Lett
to the Converſion of Infidels or others at home.
That thoſe who engage in this Affair, imagine they
will not be miſſed, where there is no want of
Schools or Clergy; but that they may be of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
Service in Countries but thinly ſupplied with
either, or altogether deprived of both: That our
Colonies being of the ſame Blood, Language and
Religion, with ourſelves, are in effect our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
But that Chriſtian Charity, not being limited
by thoſe Regards, doth extend to all Mankind.
And this may ſerve for an Anſwer to the firſt Point,
that our Deſign is againſt Duty.</p>
                  <p>To the ſecond Point I anſwer: That Ignorance
is not ſo incurable as Error; that you muſt pull
down as well as build, eraſe as well as imprint, in
order to make Proſelytes at home: Whereas, the
ſavage <hi>Americans,</hi> if they are in a State purely na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural,
and unimproved by Education, they are alſo
unincumbred with all that Rubbiſh of Superſtition
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0374600900:201"/>
and Prejudice, which is the Effect of a wrong one.
As they are leſs inſtructed, they are withal leſs
conceited and more teachable. And not being
violently attached to any falſe Syſtem of their own,
are ſo much the fitter to receive that which is true.
Hence it is evident, that Succeſs abroad ought not
to be meaſured by that which we obſerve at home,
and that the Inference, which was made from the
Difficulty of the one to the Impoſſibility of the
other, is altogether groundleſs.</p>
                  <p>It hath more the Appearance of Reaſon to object
(what will poſſibly be objected by ſome) that this
Scheme hath been already tried to no Purpoſe, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<hi>Indians</hi> having returned to their ſavage Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners
after they had been taught to write and read,
and inſtructed in the Chriſtian Religion; a clear
Proof that their natural Stupidity is not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
by Education.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to this, I ſay that the Scheme now
propoſed hath never been tried, foraſmuch as a
thorough Education in Religion and Morality, in
divine and human Learning, doth not appear to
have been ever given to any ſavage <hi>American:</hi> That
much is to be hoped from a Man ripe in Years,
and well grounded in Religion and uſeful Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
while little or nothing can be expected from
a Youth but ſlightly inſtructed in the Elements of
either: That from the Miſcarriage or groſs Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity
of ſome, a general Incapacity of all <hi>Americans</hi>
cannot be fairly inferred: That they ſhew as much
natural Senſe as other uncultivated Nations: That
the Empires of <hi>Mexico</hi> and <hi>Peru</hi> were evident
Proofs of their Capacity, in which there appeared
a Reach of Politics, and a Degree of Art and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteneſs,
which no <hi>European</hi> People were ever known
to have arrived at without the Uſe of Letters or of
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0374600900:202"/>
Iron, and which ſome perhaps have fallen ſhort of
with both thoſe Advantages.</p>
                  <p>To what hath been ſaid, it may not be improper
to add, that young <hi>Americans,</hi> educated in an
Iſland at ſome Diſtance from their own Country,
will more eaſily be kept under Diſcipline till they
have attained a compleat Education, than on the
Continent; where they might find Opportunities
of running away to their Countrymen, and return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
to their brutal Cuſtoms, before they were
thoroughly imbued with good Principles and
Habits.</p>
                  <p>It muſt nevertheleſs be acknowledged a difficult
Attempt, to plant Religion among the <hi>Americans,</hi>
ſo long as they continue their wild and roving
Life. He who is obliged to hunt for his daily Food,
will have little Curioſity or Leiſure to receive In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.
It would ſeem therefore the right Way,
to introduce Religion and civil Life at the ſame
Time into that Part of the World: either Attempt
will aſſiſt and promote the other. Thoſe therefore
of the young Savages, who upon Trial are found
leſs likely to improve by academical Studies, may
be taught Agriculture, or the moſt neceſſary Trades.
And when Husbandmen, Weavers, Carpenters,
and the like, have planted thoſe uſeful Arts among
their ſavage Countrymen, and taught them to live
in ſettled Habitations, to canton out their Land and
till it, to provide vegetable Food of all Kinds, to
preſerve Flocks and Herds of Cattle, to make
convenient Houſes, and to clothe themſelves decent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:
This will aſſiſt the ſpreading the Goſpel among
them; this will diſpoſe them to ſocial Virtues, and
enable them to ſee and to feel the Advantages of a
religious and civil Education.</p>
                  <p>And that this View of propagating the Goſpel
and civil Life among the ſavage Nations of <hi>America,</hi>
                     <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0374600900:203"/>
was a principal Motive which induced the Crown
to ſend the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colonies thither, doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
from the Charter granted by King <hi>James</hi> I.
to the Adventurers in <hi>Virginia. See</hi> Purchas'<hi>s Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims,
Vol. 4. b.</hi> I. <hi>c.</hi> 9. And it is now but juſt
(what might then ſeem charitable) that theſe poor
Creatures ſhould receive ſome Advantage with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to their ſpiritual Intereſts, from thoſe who
have ſo much improved their temporal, by ſettling
among them.</p>
                  <p>It is moſt true, notwithſtanding our preſent
Corruptions, that there are to be found in no
Country under the Sun Men of better Inclinations,
or greater Abilities for doing Good, than in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>
But it is as true, that Succeſs, in many
Caſes, depends not upon Zeal, Induſtry, Wealth,
Learning, or the like Faculties, ſo much as on the
Method, wherein theſe are applied. We often ſee
a ſmall Proportion of Labour and Expence in one
Way, bring that about, which in others, a much
greater Share of both could never effect. It hath
been my Endeavour to diſcover this Way or
Method in the preſent Caſe. What hath been
done, I ſubmit to the Judgment of all good and
reaſonable Men; who, I am perſuaded, will never
reject or diſcourage a Propoſal of this Nature, on
the Score of ſlight Objections, Surmiſes, or Diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties,
and thereby render themſelves chargeable
with the having prevented thoſe good Effects, which
might otherwiſe have been produced by it.</p>
                  <p>For it is, after all, poſſible, that unforeſeen
Difficulties may ariſe in the Proſecution of this
Deſign, many Things may retard, and many
Things may threaten to obſtruct it; but there is
hardly any Enterpriſe or Scheme whatſoever, for
the public Good, in which Difficulties are not often
ſhewing themſelves, and as often overcome by the
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0374600900:204"/>
Bleſſing of God, upon the Prudence and Reſolution
of the Undertakers; though, for ought that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears,
the preſent Scheme is as likely to ſucceed,
and attended with as few Difficulties, as any of this
Kind can poſſibly be.</p>
                  <p>For to any Man, who conſiders the divine Power
of Religion, the innate Force of Reaſon and Virtue,
and the mighty Effects often wrought by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant
regular Operation even of a weak and ſmall
Cauſe; it will ſeem natural and reaſonable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
that Rivulets perpetually iſſuing forth from a
Fountain, or Reſervoir, of Learning and Religion,
and ſtreaming through all Parts of <hi>America,</hi> muſt
in due time have a great Effect, in purging away
the ill Manners and Irreligion of our Colonies, as
well as the Blindneſs and Barbarity of the Nations
round them: Eſpecially, if the Reſervoir be in a
clean and private Place, where its Waters, out of
the Way of any Thing that may corrupt them, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
clear and pure; otherwiſe they are more likely
to pollute than purify the Places through which they
flow.</p>
                  <p>The Greatneſs of a Benefaction is rather in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion
to the Number and Want of the Receivers,
than to the Liberality of the Giver. A wiſe and
good Man would therefore be frugal in the Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of his Charity; that is, contrive it ſo as that
it might extend to the greateſt Wants of the greateſt
Number of his Fellow-creatures. Now the greateſt
Wants are ſpiritual Wants, and by all Accounts
theſe are no where greater than in our weſtern Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
in many Parts whereof divine Service is
never performed for want of Clergymen; in others,
after ſuch a Manner and by ſuch Hands, as ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalize
even the worſt of their own Pariſhioners;
where many <hi>Engliſh,</hi> inſtead of gaining Converts,
are themſelves degenerated into Heathens, being
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0374600900:205"/>
Members of no Church, without Morals, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Faith, without Baptiſm. There can be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
in no Part of the Chriſtian World, a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
Want of ſpiritual Things than in our Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.</p>
                  <p>And, on the other hand, no Part of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
World are ſo inhuman and barbarous as the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vage
<hi>Americans,</hi> whoſe chief Employment and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
conſiſting in Cruelty and Revenge, their Lives
muſt of all others, be moſt oppoſite, as well to the
Light of Nature, as to the Spirit of the Goſpel.
Now to reclaim theſe poor Wretches, to prevent
the many Torments and cruel Deaths which they
daily inflict on each other, to contribute in any
ſort to put a Stop to the numberleſs horrid Crimes
which they commit without Remorſe, and inſtead
thereof to introduce the Practice of Virtue and
Piety, muſt ſurely be a Work in the higheſt
Degree becoming every ſincere and charitable
Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe, who wiſh well to Religion and Mankind,
will need no other Motive to forward an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking
calculated for the Service of both: I ſhall,
nevertheleſs, beg leave to obſerve, that whoever
would be glad to cover a Multitude of Sins by an
extenſive and well-judged Charity, or whoever,
from an excellent and God-like Temper of Mind,
ſeeks Opportunities of doing Good in his Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
will be pleaſed to meet with a Scheme that ſo
peculiarly puts it in his Power, with ſmall Trouble
or Expence, to procure a great and laſting Benefit
to the World.</p>
                  <p>Ten Pounds a Year, would (if I miſtake not) be
ſufficient to defray the Expence of a young <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi>
in the College of <hi>Bermuda,</hi> as to Diet, Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
Clothes, Books and Education: And if ſo,
the Intereſt of two hundred Pounds may be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0374600900:206"/>
Fund for maintaining one Miſſionary at the
College, for ever; and in this Succeſſion, many,
it is to be hoped, may become powerful Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
for converting to Chriſtianity and civil Life
whole Nations, who now ſit in Darkneſs and the
Shadow of Death, and whoſe cruel brutal Manners
are a Diſgrace to human Nature.</p>
                  <p>A Benefaction of this Kind ſeems to enlarge the
very Being of a Man, extending it to diſtant Places
and to future Times; inaſmuch as unſeen Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries

Bounty, while he himſelf reaps the Reward in the

                  <p>THAT human Kind were not deſigned meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
to ſojourn a few Days upon this Earth:
that a Being of ſuch Excellence as the Soul of
Man, ſo capable of a nobler Life, and having ſuch
a high Senſe of Things moral and intellectual, was
not created in the ſole View of being impriſoned in
an earthly Tabernacle, and partaking a few Pains
and Pleaſures which checker this mortal Life, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
aſpiring to any Thing either above or beyond
it, is a fundamental Doctrine as well of natural Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
as of the Chriſtian. It comes at once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended
by the Authority of Philoſophers and
Evangeliſts. And that there actually is in the
Mind of Man a ſtrong Inſtinct and Deſire, an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite
and Tendency towards another and a better
State, incomparably ſuperior to the preſent, both
in point of Happineſs and Duration, is no more
than every one's Experience and inward Feeling
may inform him. The Satiety and Diſreliſh at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending
ſenſual Enjoyments, the Reliſh for Things
of a more pure and ſpiritual Kind, the reſtleſs Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Mind, from one terrene Object or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
to another, and often a Flight or Endeavour
above them all towards ſomething unknown, and
perfective of its Nature, are ſo many Signs and
Tokens of this better State, which in the Stile of
the Goſpel is termed Life Eternal.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="216" facs="tcp:0374600900:211"/>
And as this is the greateſt Good that can befal
us, the very End of our Being, and that alone
which can crown and ſatisfy our Wiſhes, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
which we ſhall be ever reſtleſs and uneaſy; ſo
every Man, who knows and acts up to his true In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt,
muſt make it his principal Care and Study
to obtain it: And in order to this, he muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
to live ſuitably to his Calling, and of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
endeavour to make others obtain it too.
For how can a Chriſtian ſhew himſelf worthy of
his Calling, otherwiſe than by performing the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of it? And what Chriſtian Duty is more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially
ſo, than that of Charity? And what Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
can be found upon Earth more deſerving our
Charity, than the Souls of Men? Or, how is it
poſſible for the moſt beneficent Spirit to do them
better Service, than by promoting their beſt and
moſt laſting Intereſt, that is, by putting them in
the Way that leads to eternal Life.</p>
                  <p>What this eternal Life was, or how to come at
it, were Points unknown to the Heathen World.
It muſt be owned, the wiſe Men of old, who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed
the Light of Nature, ſaw even by that Light,
that the Soul of Man was debaſed, and borne down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
contrary to its natural Bent, by carnal and
terrene Objects; and that, on the other hand, it
was exalted, purged, and in ſome ſort aſſimulated
to the Deity, by the Contemplation of Truth and
Practice of Virtue. Thus much in general they
ſaw or ſurmiſed. But then about the Way and
Means to know the one, or perform the other, they
were much at a loſs. They were not agreed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
the true End of Mankind; which, as they
ſaw, was miſtaken in the vulgar Purſuits of Men;
ſo they found it much more eafy to conſute the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors
of others, than to aſcertain the Truth them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.
Hence ſo many Diviſions and Diſputes
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0374600900:212"/>
about a Point which it moſt imported them to know,
inſomuch as it was to give the Bias to human Life,
and govern the whole Tenor of their Actions and Conduct.</p>
                  <p>But when Life and Immortality were brought to
Light by the Goſpel, there could remain no Diſpute
about the chief End and Felicity of Man, no more
than there could about the Means of obtaining it,
after the expreſs Declaration of our bleſſed Lord in
the Words of my Text; <hi>This is Life eternal, that
they may know thee the only true God, and Jeſus
Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi> For the right Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing
of which Words we muſt obſerve, that by
the Knowledge of God, is not meant a barren Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation,
either of Philoſophers or Scholaſtic Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines,
nor any notional Tenets fitted to produce
Diſputes and Diſſenſions among Men; but, on the
contrary, an holy practical Knowledge, which is
the Source, the Root, or Principle of Peace and
Union, of Faith, Hope, Charity, and univerſal Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.
A Man may frame the moſt accurate No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and in one Senſe attain the exacteſt Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God and Chriſt that human Faculties can
reach, and yet, notwithſtanding all this, be far from
knowing them in that ſaving Senſe. For St. <hi>John</hi>
tells us, that<note n="*" place="bottom">1 John. iii. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>whoſoever ſinneth, hath not ſeen Chriſt,
nor known him.</hi> And again,<note n="†" place="bottom">1 John iv. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>He that loveth not,
knoweth not God.</hi> To know God as we ought, we
muſt love him; and love him ſo as withal to love
our Brethren, his Creatures and his Children. I
ſay, that Knowledge of God and Chriſt, which is
Life eternal, implies univerſal Charity, with all the
Duties ingrafted thereon, or enſuing from thence,
that is to ſay, the Love of God and Man. And
our Lord expreſly ſaith,<note n="‖" place="bottom">John xiv. 21.</note> 
                     <hi>He that hath my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments,
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0374600900:213"/>
and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me.</hi>
From all which it is evident, that this ſaving Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of God is inſeparable from the Knowledge
and Practice of his Will; the explicit Declaration
whereof, and of the Means to perform it, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
in the Goſpel, that divine Inſtrument of
Grace and Mercy to the Sons of Men. The Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical
Knowledge of God, conſidered in his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute
Nature or Eſſence, is one Thing, and to
know him as he ſtands related to us as Creator, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,
and Sanctifier, is another. The former
Kind of Knowledge (whatever it amounts to) hath
been, and may be, in Gentiles as well as Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,
but not the latter, which is Life eternal.</p>
                  <p>From what has been ſaid, it is a plain Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence,
that whoever is a ſincere Chriſtian cannot
be indifferent about bringing over other Men to
the Knowledge of God and Chriſt; but that every
one of us, who hath any Claim to that Title, is
indiſpenſably obliged in Duty to God, and in Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity
to his Neighbour, to deſire and promote, ſo
far as there is Opportunity, the Converſion of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens
and Infidels, that ſo they may become Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers
of Life and Immortality. For, <hi>this is Life
eternal, to know thee the only true God, and Jeſus
Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In my preſent Diſcourſe upon which Words; I
ſhall,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, conſider in general the Obligation that
Chriſtians lie under, of bringing other Men to
the Knowledge of the only true God, and of
Jeſus Chriſt. And,</p>
                  <p>Secondly, I ſhall conſider it in reference to
this laudable Society, inſtituted for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation
of the Goſpel. And under each
Head; I propoſe to obviate ſuch Difficulties
as may ſeem to retard, and intermix ſuch Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0374600900:214"/>
as ſhall appear proper to forward ſo
good a Work.</p>
                  <p>Now although it be very evident, that we can
really have neither a juſt Zeal for the Glory of
God, nor a beneficent Love of Man, without wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and endeavouring, as occaſion ſerves, to ſpread
the glad Tidings of Salvation, and bring thoſe who
are benighted in the Shadow of Death, to Life eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,
by the Knowledge of the only true God, and
of Jeſus Chriſt whom he hath ſent. Yet this
Duty, plain and undoubted as it ſeems, happens
to be too often overlooked, even by thoſe whoſe
Attention to other Points would make one think
their Neglect of this, not an Effect of lukewarm
Indifference, ſo much as of certain miſtaken Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
and Suppoſitions. Two principal Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
occur, which, in this particular, ſeem to have
ſlackened the Induſtry of ſome, otherwiſe zealous
and ſerious Chriſtians.</p>
                  <p>One I apprehend to be this, that it is ſurmiſed,
the Chriſtian Religion is in a declining State, which
by many Symptoms ſeems likely to end either in Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery,
or a general Infidelity. And that of courſe
a prudent Perſon has nothing to do, but to make
ſure of his own Salvation, and to acquieſce in the
general Tendency of Things, without being at any
fruitleſs Pains to oppoſe what cannot be prevented,
to ſteer againſt the Stream, or reſiſt a Torrent,
which as it flows, gathers Strength and Rapidity,
and in the End will be ſure to overflow, and carry
before it. When a Man of a deſponding and
foreboding Spirit hath been led, by his Obſervation
of the Ways of the World, and the prevailing Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour
of our Times, to think after this Manner; he
will be inclined to ſtrengthen this his preconceived
Opinion, as is uſual in other the like Caſes, by Miſ-application
of holy Scripture: For Inſtance, by
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0374600900:215"/>
thoſe Words of our bleſſed Saviour,<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke xviii. 8.</note> 
                     <hi>When
the Son of Man cometh, ſhall he find Faith on the
Earth?</hi> which have been applied to this very Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
as importing that before the final Judgment,
Chriſtian Faith ſhould be extinguiſhed upon Earth;
although theſe Words do, from the Context, ſeem
plainly to refer to the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and
the obſtinate Blindneſs of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who even then
when they felt the Hand of God, ſhould not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
it, or believe the <hi>Roman</hi> Army to be
the Inſtrument of divine Vengeance, in the Day of
their Viſitation, by him whom they had injuriouſly
treated, rejected, and put to Death.</p>
                  <p>But, granting the former Senſe might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
by no abſurd Hypotheſis, or no improbable
Gueſs; yet ſhall the Endeavours of Chriſtian Men
for propagating the Goſpel of Chriſt be foreſtalled
by any Suppoſitions or Conjectures whatſoever?
Admitting, I ſay, thoſe Words regard the future
Advent of Jeſus Chriſt, yet can any one tell how
near or how far off that Advent may be? Are
not the Times and Seaſons foreknown only to God?
And ſhall we neglect a certain Duty to Day, upon
an uncertain Surmiſe of what is to come hereafter?
This Way of thinking might furniſh as ſtrong
Reaſons againſt Preaching at home, as abroad,
within, as without the Pale of the Church. It
would be as ſpecious an Argument againſt the one as
the other, but in reality can conclude againſt neither.
For, as we know not when that ſuppoſed Time of
general Infidelity is to be, or whether it will be at
all; ſo, if it were ever ſo ſure, and ever ſo near, it
would nevertheleſs become us to take care, that it
may not be an Effect of our own particular Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference
and Neglect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0374600900:216"/>
But if we take our Notions, not from the uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
Interpretation of a particular Text, but from
the whole Tenor of the divine Oracles, from the
expreſs Promiſe and reiterated Predictions of our
bleſſed Lord and his Apoſtles, we ſhall believe,
that<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. ii. 9, 10, 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is highly exalted of God, to the
End; that at his Name every Knee ſhall bow, and
every Tongue confeſs that he is the Lord, to the Glory
of God the Father.</hi> That<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. xv. 25.</note> 
                     <hi>he muſt reign till he hath
put all Enemies under his Feet.</hi> That<note n="‖" place="bottom">Mat. xxviii. 20.</note> 
                     <hi>he is with us
alway, even unto the End of the World.</hi> And that,
the Church of the living God, the Pillar and Ground
of Truth, is ſo far from being deſtroyed by human
Means,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Mat. xvi. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>that the Gates of Hell</hi> (all the infernal
Powers) <hi>ſhall not prevail againſt it.</hi> Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
baniſh all ſuch Conceits as may ſeem to juſtify
our Indolence, as may reaſon us out of all Courage
and Vigour in the Race that is ſet before us; let us
not, I ſay, ſlacken our own Hands, nor enfeeble
our own Knees, by preconceived Fancies and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions,
conſidering that as the Succeſs of all En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſes
in great meaſure depends on the Spirit of
the Undertakers, ſo nothing is more apt to raiſe a
Spirit than Hope; nor to depreſs it, than Deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency.
We ought therefore to ſhake off every
vain Fear in our ſpiritual Warfare. The Number,
the Preſumption, and the Abilities of thoſe, who
take Counſel together againſt the Lord and againſt
his Anointed, ſhould not diſhearten, but rather ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite
and encourage us to ſtand in the Gap.</p>
                  <p>Another Conſideration, that may poſſibly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
divers ſincere Believers from contributing their
Endeavours for bringing Men to the Knowledge of
God and Chriſt, and thereby to eternal Life, is the
want of Miracles in the preſent Age. Men natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0374600900:217"/>
caſt about for Reaſons to countenance the Part
they take. And as the Gift of Miracles was of
mighty Influence and Help to thoſe, who were
commiſſioned to ſpread abroad the Light of the
Goſpel in its firſt Promulgation, ſo no Pretence of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers
itſelf more naturally to excuſe a Man from exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting
any Purpoſe, than the Want of Authority,
which, in the Opinion of Men, cannot be without
a juſt Commiſſion, nor this unleſs diſtinguiſhed
by thoſe proper Means and Powers that have been
known to attend it. Now, with regard to this
Defect of Miracles, I ſhall beg leave to make two
Obſervations.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is to be obſerved, that if we have not
Miracles, we have other Advantages which make
them leſs neceſſary now, than in the firſt ſpreading
of the Goſpel: Whole Nations have found the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit
of Chriſt's Religion, it is protected by Princes,
eſtabliſhed and encouraged by Laws, ſupported by
Learning and Arts, recommended by the Experience
of many Ages, as well as by the Authority and
Example of the wiſeſt it and moſt knowing Men.
Certainly, if the greateſt Part of Mankind are Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles
or Mahometans, it cannot be denied, that the
moſt knowing, moſt learned, and moſt improved
Nations, profeſs Chriſtianity; and that even the
Mahometans themſelves bear Teſtimony to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
Miſſion of Jeſus Chriſt. Whereas therefore,
in the Beginning, a few illiterate Wanderers, of
the meaneſt of the People, had the Prejudices, the
Learning, and the Power of their own, as well as
other Nations, in one World, the whole World, to
oppoſe and overcome: Thoſe who at this Day
engage in the Propagation of the Goſpel, do it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
Terms in many Reſpects far more eaſy and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous.
It is Power againſt Weakneſs, Civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
againſt Barbariſm, Knowledge againſt Ignorance,
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0374600900:218"/>
ſome or other, if not all theſe Advantages, in the
preſent Times, attending the Progreſs of the Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian
Religion, in whatever Part of the World Men
ſhall attempt to plant it.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond Place we may reflect, that if we
have not the Gift of Miracles, this is a good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
why we ſhould exert more ſtrongly thoſe human
Means which God hath put in our Power; and make
our ordinary Faculties, whether of the Head, or the
Hand, or the Tongue, our Intereſt, our Credit, or our
Fortune, ſubſervient to the great Giver of them;
and chearfully contribute our humble Mite towards
haſtening that Time, wherein<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. lxxxvi. 9.</note>
                     <hi>all Nations whom
thou haſt made, ſhall come and worſhip before thee, O
Lord, and ſhall glorify thy Name.</hi> It is at leaſt
a plain Caſe, that the Want of Apoſtolical Gifts
ſhould not be pleaded as a Bar to our doing that,
which in no Reſpect, either of Difficulty or Danger,
equals, or approaches the Apoſtolical Office. What
Pretence can this ſupply for Mens being quite uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned
about the Spreading of the Goſpel, or the
Salvation of Souls? for Mens forgetting that they
are Chriſtians, and related to human Kind? How
can this juſtify their overlooking Opportunities
which lie in their Way, their not contributing
a ſmall Part of their Fortune towards forwarding a
Deſign, wherein they ſhare neither Pains nor Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril;
the not beſtowing on it, even the cheap Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance
of their Speech, Attention, Counſel, or
Countenance, as Occaſion offers? How unlike is
this worldly, ſelfiſh Indifference, to that Account
which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of himſelf, that<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. x. 33.</note> 
                     <hi>he ſought
not his own Profit, but the Profit of many, that they
may be ſaved.</hi> And yet herein he expected the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinthians</hi>
(and the ſame Reaſon will hold for us)
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:0374600900:219"/>
ſhould be like him; for he ſubjoins, <hi>Be ye Followers
of me as I alſo am of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having conſidered the Duty in general, I come
now to treat of it with reference to <hi>America,</hi> the
peculiar Province of this venerable Society; which
I ſuppoſe well informed of the State and Progreſs
of Religion in that Part of the World, by their
Correſpondencies with the Clergy upon their Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
It may nevertheleſs be expected that one who
had been engaged in a Deſign upon this very View,
who hath been upon the Place, and reſided a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable
Time in one of our Colonies, ſould have
obſerved ſomewhat worth reporting. It is to be
hoped, therefore, that one Part of my Audience will
pardon, what the other may perhaps expect, while
I detain them with the Narrative of a few Things
I have obſerved, and ſuch Reflexions as thereupon
ſuggeſted themſelves; ſome Part of which may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly be found to extend to ether Colonies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> with a Portion of the adjacent
Continent, under the ſame Government, is inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Colony, conſiſting chiefly
of Sectaries of many different Denominations, who ſeem
to have worn off part of that Prejudice, which they
inherited from their Anceſtors, againſt the national
Church of this Land; though it muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
at the ſame Time, that too many of them
have worn off a ſerious Senſe of all Religion. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
indeed of the better Sort are accuſtomed to
aſſemble themſelves regularly on the Lord's Day
for the Performance of divine Worſhip. But moſt
of thoſe, who are diſperſed throughout this Colony,
ſeem to rival ſome well-bred People of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,
in a thorough Indifference for all that is ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acred,
being equally careleſs of outward Worſhip,
and of inward Principles, whether of Faith or
Practice. Of the Bulk of them it may certainly
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:0374600900:220"/>
be ſaid, that they live without the Sacraments, not
being ſo much as baptized: And as for their Morals,
I apprehend there is nothing to be found in them
that ſhould tempt others to make an Experiment of
their Principles, either in Religion or Government.
But it muſt be owned; the general Behaviour of the
Inhabitants in thoſe Towns where Churches and
Meetings have been long ſettled, and regularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
ſeems ſo much better, as ſufficiently to ſhew
the Difference, which a ſolemn regular Worſhip of
God makes between Perſons of the ſame Blood,
Temper, and natural Faculties.</p>
                  <p>The native <hi>Indians,</hi> who are ſaid to have been
formerly many Thouſands, within the Compaſs of
this Colony, do not at preſent amount to one
Thouſand, including every Age and Sex. And
theſe are either all Servants or Labourers for the
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> who have contributed more to deſtroy
their Bodies by the Uſe of ſtrong Liquors, than by
any means to improve their Minds, or ſave their
Souls. This ſlow Poiſon, jointly operating with
the Small-Pox, and their Wars (but much more
deſtructive than both) hath conſumed the <hi>Indians,</hi>
not only in our Colonies, but alſo far and wide upon
our Conſines. And having made Havock of them,
is now doing the ſame thing by thoſe who taught
them that odious Vice.</p>
                  <p>The Negroes in the Government of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi>
are about half as many more than the <hi>Indians;</hi> and
both together ſcarce amount to a ſeventh Part of
the whole Colony. The Religion of theſe People,
as is natural to ſuppoſe, takes after that of their
Maſters. Some few are baptized; ſeveral frequent
the different Aſſemblies; and far the greater Part
none at all. An ancient Antipathy to the <hi>Indians,</hi>
whom it ſeems, our firſt Planters (therein as in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
other Particulars affecting to imitate <hi>Jews</hi> rather
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:0374600900:221"/>
than <hi>Chriſtians</hi>) imagined they had a Right to treat
on the Foot of <hi>Canaanites</hi> or <hi>Amalekites,</hi> together
with an irrational Contempt of the Blacks, as
Creatures of another Species, who had no Right to
be inſtruced or admitted to the Sacraments, have
proved a main Obſtacle to the Converſion of theſe
poor People.</p>
                  <p>To this may be added, an erroneous Notion,
that the being baptized, is inconſiſtent with a State
of Slavery. To undeceive them in this Particular,
which had too much Weight, it ſeemed a proper
Step, if the Opinion of his Majeſty's Attorney and
Solicitor-General could be procured. This Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
they charitably ſent over, ſigned with their
own Hands; which was accordingly printed in
<hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> and diſperſed throughout the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations.
I heartily wiſh it may produce the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Effect. It muſt be owned, our reformed Planters,
with reſpect to the Natives and the Slaves, might
learn from thoſe of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> how it is
their Intereſt and Duty to behave. Both <hi>French</hi>
and <hi>Spaniards</hi> have intermarried with <hi>Indians,</hi> to
the great Strength, Security and Increaſe of their
Colonies. They take care to inſtruct both them
and their Negroes, in the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Religion, to the
Reproach of thoſe who profeſs a better. They
have alſo Biſhops and Seminaries for Clergy; and
it is not found that their Colonies are worſe Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
or depend leſs on their Mother Country, on
that Account.</p>
                  <p>It ſhould ſeem, that the likelieſt Step towards
converting the Heathen would be to begin with the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Planters; whoſe Influence will for ever be
an Obſtacle to propagating the Goſpel, till they
have a right Senſe of it themſelves, which would
ſhew them how much it is their Duty to impart it
to others. The Miſſionaries employed by this
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:0374600900:222"/>
venerable Society have done, and continue to do,
good Service, in bringing thoſe Planters to a ſerious
Senſe of Religion, which, it is hoped, will in Time
extend to others. I ſpeak it knowingly, that the
Miniſters of the Goſpel, in thoſe Provinces which
go by the Name of <hi>New-England,</hi> ſent and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
at the Expence of this Society, have, by their Sobriety of Manners, diſcreet Behaviour, and
a competent Degree of uſeful Knowledge, ſhewn
themſelves worthy the Choice of thoſe who ſent
them; and particularly in living on a more friendly
Foot with their Brethren of the Separation; who,
on their Part, were alſo very much come off from
that Narrowneſs of Spirit, which formerly kept
them at ſuch an unamicable Diſtance from us. And
as there is Reaſon to apprehend, that Part of <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>
could not have been thus diſtinguiſhed, and
provided with ſuch a Number of proper Perſons,
if one half of them had not been ſupplied out of
the diſſenting Seminaries of the Country, who, in
Proportion as they attain to more liberal Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
of Learning, are obſerved to quit their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice
towards an epiſcopal Church; ſo I verily
think it might increaſe the Number of ſuch uſeful
Men, if Proviſion were made to defray their Charges
in coming hither to receive Holy Orders; paſſing
and repaſſing the Ocean, and tarrying the neceſſary
Time in <hi>London,</hi> requiring an Expence that many
are not able to bear. It would alſo be an Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
to the Miſſionaries in general, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
produce good Effects, if the Allowance of
certain Miſſionaries were augmented, in proportion
to the Services they had done, and the Time they
had ſpent in their Million. Theſe Hints I venture
to ſuggeſt, as not unuſeful in an Age, wherein all
human Encouragements are found more neceſſary,
than at the firſt Propagation of the Goſpel. But
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0374600900:223"/>
they are, with all due Deference and Reſpect,
ſubmitted to the Judgment of this venerable Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.</p>
                  <p>After all, it is hardly to be expected, that ſo
long as Infidelity prevails at home, the Chriſtian
Religion ſhould thrive and flouriſh in our Colonies
abroad. Mankind, it muſt be owned, left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
are ſo much bewildered and benighted, with
reſpect to the Origin of that Evil which they feel,
and from which they are at a loſs about the Means
of being freed; that the Doctrines of the lapſed
State of Man, his Reconciliation by Chriſt, and
Regeneration by the Spirit, may reaſonably be
hoped to find an eaſy Admiſſion, as bringing with
them Light and Comfort, into a Mind not hardened
by Impenitency, nor fore-cloſed by Pride, nor bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſed
by Prejudice. But ſuch is the Vanity of Man,
that no Prejudice operates more powerfully than
that in Favour of Faſhion; and no Faſhions are ſo
much followed by our Colonies, as thoſe of the
Mother Country, which they often adopt in their
Modes of living, to their great Inconvenience,
without allowing for the Diſparity of Circumſtance
or Climate. This ſame Humour hath made Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity
(as I find it too credibly reported) ſpread in
ſome of our wealthy Plantations; uneducated Men
being more apt to tread in the Steps of Libertines
and Men of Faſhion, than to model themſelves by
the Laws and Inſtitutions of their Mother Country,
or the Lives and Profeſſions of the virtuous and
religious Part of it.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all: While thoſe abroad are leſs
diſpoſed to receive, ſome at home are, perhaps,
leſs diſpoſed to propagate the Goſpel, from the
ſame Cauſe. It is to be feared, I ſay, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing
Torrent of Infidelity, which ſtaggers the
Faith of ſome, may cool the Zeal and damp the
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:0374600900:224"/>
Spirit of others, who, judging from the Event and
Succeſs of thoſe who impugn the Church of Chriſt,
may poſſibly entertain ſome Scruple or Surmiſe,
whether it may not be, for the preſent at leaſt,
abandoned by Providence, and that human Care
muſt ineffectually interpoſe, till it ſhall pleaſe God,
<hi>yet once more to ſhake not the Earth only, but alſo the
Heavens.</hi> This Point hath been touched before,
but deſerves farther Conſideration: to the End,
that the peculiar Impiety of a profane Age, may
not be a Bar to thoſe very Endeavours, which itſelf
renders more neceſſary, and calls for more loudly
now than ever.</p>
                  <p>Whatever Men may think, the Arm of the Lord
is not ſhortened. In all this Prevalency of Atheiſm
and Irreligion, there is no Advantage gained by
the Powers of Darkneſs, either againſt God, or
godly Men, but only againſt their own wretched
Partiſans. The Chriſtian Diſpenſation is a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation
of Grace and Favour. The Chriſtian
Church a Society of Men intitled to this Grace, on
performing certain Conditions. If this Society is
diminiſhed, as thoſe who remain true Members of it
ſuffer no Loſs to themſelves, ſo God loſeth no
Right, ſuffereth no Detriment, forgoeth no Good;
his Grace reſiſted or unfruitful, being no more

on deſert Places, or among People who ſhut their
Eyes.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, this Exceſs, this unſtemmed Torrent of
Profaneneſs, may poſſibly, in the Concluſion, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat
itſelf, confirm what it meant to extirpate, and
inſtead of deſtroying, prove a Means of preſerving
our Religion; the evil Fruits and Effects thereof
being ſo notorious and flagrant, and ſo ſenſibly felt,
as in all likelihood to be able to open the Eyes,
and rouſe the Attention of thoſe, who may be blind
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:0374600900:225"/>
and deaf to every other Argument and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.
Or, who knows but the Chriſtian
Church corrupted by Proſperity, is to be reſtored
and purified by Adverſity? which may prove for
ought we can tell, as ſalutary in future, as it hath
been in paſt Ages. Many inſolent and preſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
Foes have ſet themſelves againſt the Church of
God; whole Hook nevertheleſs may be in their
Noſtrils, and his Bridle in their Lips, managing
and governing, even their Rage and Folly, to the
fulfilling of his own wiſe Purpoſes; and who may
not fail in the End, to deal by them as he did by
the King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> when he had<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſa. x. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>performed his
Work upon</hi> Sion <hi>and upon</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>puniſhing their
ſtout Heart and high Looks.</hi> This preſumptuous
Conqueror was, without knowing it, a Tool or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument
in the Hands of that God whom he blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. x. 5, 6, 7.</note> 
                     <hi>O</hi> Aſſyrian, <hi>the Rod of mine Anger! I
will ſend him againſt an hypocritical Nation, and
againſt the People of my Wrath will I give him a
Charge to take the Spoil, and to take the Prey, and
to tread them down like the Mire of the Streets.
Howbeit he meaneth not ſo, neither doth his Heart
think ſo, but it is in his Heart to deſtroy and cut off
Nations not a few.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much at leaſt is evident: It is no new
Thing, that great Enormities ſhould produce great
Humiliations, and theſe again noble Virtues, which
have often recovered both ſingle Men, and whole
States, even in a natural and civil Senſe. And if
the Captivities, Diſtreſſes, and Deſolations of the
Jewiſh Church, have occaſioned their Return to
God, and reinſtated them in his Favour; nay, if it
was actually foretold, whenever they lay under the
Curſe of God, at the Mercy of their Enemies,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0374600900:226"/>
peeled and ſcattered in a foreign Land, that never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs
upon their calling his Covenant to Mind,
and returning to him,<note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. xxx. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord their God would
turn their Captivity, and have Compaſſion upon them.</hi>
I ſay, if Things were ſo, why may we not in
Reaſon hope for ſomething analogous thereto, in
behalf of the Chriſtian Church, It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied,
that there was a great Analogy between the
Jewiſh Inſtitutions, and the Doctrines of the
Goſpel; for Inſtance, between the Paſchal Lamb,
and the Lamb of God ſlain from the Foundation
of the World; between the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Bondage, and
that of Sin; the earthly <hi>Canaan,</hi> and the heavenly;
the fleſhly Circumciſion, and the ſpiritual.
In theſe and many other Particulars, the Analogy ſeems ſo
plain, that it can hardly be diſputed. To be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
that the Law of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Jewiſh
Oeconomy were Figures and Shadows of the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical,
we need only look into the Epiſtle to the
<hi>Hebrews.</hi> May we not therefore, in purſuance
of this ſame Analogy, ſuppoſe a ſimilar Treatment
of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Church?</p>
                  <p>Let us then ſee, on what Terms the former
flood with God, in order to diſcover what the latter
may reaſonably expect. The ſolemn Denunciation
to the <hi>Jews</hi> was,<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut, xxviii. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>If thou ſhall hearken diligently
unto the Voice of the Lord thy God, to obſerve and
to do all his Commandments, which I command thee
this Day, that the Lord thy God will ſet thee on high
above all the Nations of the Earth.</hi> But in caſe of
Diſobedience, it is added among many other
Threats and Maledictions:<note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 22, 23.</note> 
                     <hi>The Lord ſhall ſmite
thee with Blaſting and with Mildew: and thy Heaven
that is over thy Head ſhall be Braſs, and the Earth
that is under thee ſhall be Iron.</hi> And again,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Ver. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>The
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:0374600900:227"/>
Lord ſhall ſmite thee with Madneſs, and Blindneſs,
and Aſtoniſhment of Heart.</hi> Have not the People of
this Land drawn down upon it, by more Ways
than one, the juſt Judgments of Heaven? Surely
we have felt in a Metaphor the firſt of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned
Judgments; and the laſt hath been
literally fulfilled upon us. Is it not viſible that we
are leſs knowing, leſs virtuous, leſs reaſonable, in
Proportion as we are leſs religious? Are we not
grown drunk and giddy with Vice and Vanity and
Preſumption, and Free-thinking, and Extravagance
of every Kind? to a Degree that we may truly be
ſaid to be <hi>ſmitten with Madneſs, and Blindneſs, and
Aſtoniſhment of Heart.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As anciently moſt unchriſtian Schiſms and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes,
joined with great Corruption of Manners,
made way for the <hi>Mahometan</hi> in the Eaſt, and the
Papal Dominion in the Weſt; even ſo here at home
in the laſt Century, a weak Reliance upon human
Politics and Power on the one hand, and enthuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtic
Rage on the other, together with Carnal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs
on both, gave occaſion to introduce
Atheiſm and Infidelity. If the temporal State,
and outward Form of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church was, upon
their Defection, overturned by Invaders; in like
manner, when Chriſtians are no longer governed
by the Light of Evangelical Truth, when we reſiſt
the Spirit of God, are we not to expect, that
<hi>the Heaven above will be as Braſs,</hi> that the divine Grace
will no longer ſhower down on our obdurate Hearts,
that our Church and Profeſſion will be blaſted by
licentious Scorners, thoſe Madmen, who in Sport
<hi>ſcatter Firebrands, Arrows, and Death?</hi> As all this
is no more than we may reaſonably ſuppoſe will
enſue upon our Backſliding, ſo we may, with equal
Reaſon, hope it will be remedied upon our Return
to God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0374600900:228"/>
From what hath been ſaid it follows, that in
order to propagate the Goſpel abroad, it is neceſſary
we do it at home, and extend our Charity to do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
Infidels, if we would convert or prevent
foreign ones. So that a View of the declining
State of Religion here at home, of thoſe Things
that produced this Declenſion, and of the proper
Methods to repair it, is naturally connected with
the Subject of this Diſcourſe. I ſhall therefore beg
your Patience, while I juſt mention a few Remarks
or Hints, too obvious, perhaps, in themſelves
to be new or unknown to any preſent, but too little
viſible in their Effects, to make one think they are,
by all, much attended to.</p>
                  <p>Some, preferring Points notional or ritual to the
Love of God and Man, conſider the national
Church only as it ſtands oppoſed to other Chriſtian
Societies. Theſe generally have a Zeal without
Knowledge, and the Effects are ſuitable to the
Cauſe; they really hurt what they ſeem to eſpouſe.
Others more ſolicitous about the Diſcovery of
Truth, than the Practice of Holineſs, employ
themſelves, rather to ſpy out Errors in the Church,
than enforce its Precepts. Theſe, it is to be feared,
poſtpone the great Intereſts of Religion to Points
of leſs Concern, in any Eyes but their own. But
ſurely they would do well to conſider, that an
humble, though confuſed or indiſtinct, Faith in the
Bond of Charity, and productive of good Works,
is much more Evangelical than any accurate diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and conceited Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>A Church which contains the Fundamentals, and
nothing ſubverſive of thoſe Fundamentals, is not to
be ſet at naught by any particular Member; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it may not, in every Point, perhaps, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond
with his Ideas, no not, though he is ſure
of being in the right. Probably there never was,
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0374600900:229"/>
or will be, an eſtabliſhed Church in this World,
without viſible Marks of Humanity upon it. Saint
<hi>Paul</hi> ſuppoſeth, that<note n="‖" place="bottom">1 Cor. iii. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>on the Foundation of Jeſus
Chriſt, there will be human Superſtructures of Hay
and Stubble,</hi> Things light and trivial, wrong or
ſuperſtitious, which indeed is a natural Conſequence
of the Weakneſs and Ignorance of Man. But
where that living Foundation is rightly laid in the
Mind, there will not fail to grow and ſpring from
thence thoſe Virtues and Graces, which are the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine
Effects and Tokens of true Faith, and which
are by no means inconſiſtent with every Error in
Theory, or every needleſs Rite in Worſhip.</p>
                  <p>The Chriſtian Religion was calculated for the
Bulk of Mankind, and therefore cannot reaſonably
be ſuppoſed to conſiſt in ſubtle and nice Notions.
From the Time that Divinity was conſidered as a
Science, and human Reaſon inthroned in the Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary
of God, the Hearts of its Profeſſors ſeem to
have been leſs under the Influence of Grace. From
that Time have grown many unchriſtian Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
and Controverſies, of Men<note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Tim. vi. 4, 5.</note> 
                     <hi>knowing nothing,
but doting about Queſtions and Strifes of Words,
whereof cometh Envy, Strife, Railings, evil Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes,
perverſe Diſputings of Men of corrupt Minds
and deſtitute of Truth.</hi> Doubtleſs, the making Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
a notional Thing, hath been of infinite Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervice.
And whereas its holy Myſteries are rather
to be received with Humility of Faith, than
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined and meaſured by the Accuracy of human
Reaſon; all Attempts of this Kind, however well
intended, have viſibly failed in the Event; and
inſtead of reconciling Infidels, have, by creating
Diſputes and Heats among the Profeſſors of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity,
given no ſmall Advantage to its Enemies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0374600900:230"/>
To conclude, if we proportioned our Zeal to the
Importance of Things: If we could love Men
whoſe Opinions we do not approve: If we knew
the World more, and liked it leſs: If we had a
due Senſe of the divine Perfection and our own
Defects: If our chief Study was the Wiſdom from
above, deſcribed by St. <hi>Paul:</hi> And if, in order
to all this, that were done in Places of Education,
which cannot ſo well be done out of them: I ſay,
if theſe Steps were taken at home, while proper
Meaſures are carrying on abroad, the one would
very much forward or facilitate the other. As it is
not meant, ſo it muſt not be underſtood, that
foreign Attempts ſhould wait for domeſtic Succeſs,
but only that it is to be wiſhed they may co-operate.
Certainly if a juſt and rational, a genuine and ſincere,
a warm and vigorous Piety, animated the Mother-Country,
the Influence thereof would ſoon reach
our foreign Plantations, and extend throughout
their Borders. We ſhould ſoon ſee Religion ſhine
forth with new Luſtre and Force, to the Converſion
of Infidels, both at home and abroad, and to

Hujus rei exempium ſit controverſia illa de propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione

Hanc autem ſententiam ſupponere, vim

                  <p>16. Quo clarius adhuc appareat, confuſionem
quandam miram per abſtractiones metaphyſicas in
doctrinam de motu introductam eſſe, videamus
quantum interſit inter notiones virorum celebrium
de vi &amp; impetu. Leibnitius impetum cum motu
confundit. Juxta Newtonum impetus revera idem
eſt cum vi inertiae. Borellus aſſerit impetum non
aliud eſſe quam gradum velocitatis. Alii impetum
&amp; conatum inter ſe differre, alii non differre vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunt.
Plerique vim motricem motui proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onalem
intelligunt, nonnulli aliam aliquam vim
praeter motricem, &amp; diverſimodè menſurandam,
utpote per quadrata velocitatum in moles, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligere

                  <p>17. <hi>Vis, gravitas, attractio,</hi> &amp; hujuſmodi voces
utiles ſunt ad ratiocinia, &amp; computationes de motu
&amp; corporibus motis: ſed non ad intelligendam
ſimplicem ipſius motus naturam, vel ad qualitates
totidem diſtinctas deſignandas. Attractionem cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te
quod attinet, patet illam ab Newtono adhiberi,
non tanquam qualitatem veram &amp; phyſicam, ſed
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0374600900:238"/>
ſolummodo ut hypotheſin mathematicam. Quin
&amp; Leibnitius, niſum elementarem ſeu ſolicitationem
ab impetu diſtinguens, fatetur illa entia non re ipſa
inveniri in rerum natura, ſed abſtractione facienda
eſſe.</p>
                  <p>18. Similis ratio eſt compoſitionis &amp; reſolutio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes

Haec mechanicae &amp; computationi inſerviunt:
ſed aliud eſt computationi &amp; demonſtrationibus
mathematicis inſervire, aliud, rerum naturam ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibere.</p>
                  <p>19. Ex recentioribus multi ſunt in eâ opinione,
ut putent motum neque deſtrui nec de novo gigni,
ſed eandem ſemper motus quantitatem permanere.
Ariſtoteles etiam dubium illud olim propoſuit,
utrum motus factus ſit &amp; corruptus, an vero ab
aeterno? phyſ. l. 8. Quod vero motus ſenſibilis
pereat, patet ſenſibus, illi autem eundem impetum,
niſum, aut ſummam virium eandem manere velle
videntur. Unde affirmat Borellus, vim in percuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſione,
non imminui ſed expandi, impetuſ etiam
contrarios ſuſcipi &amp; retineri in eodem corpore.
Item Leibnitius niſum ubique &amp; ſemper eſſe in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teria,

Caeterùm ſanior philoſophandi ratio videtur ab no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus

                  <p>24. Quicquid continetur in idea corporis novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus:

ii revera nihil aliud quam principium motus eſſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognitum

                  <p>25. Praeter res corporeas alterum eſt genus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum

corpora movendi, propria experientia didicimus,
quandoquidem anima noſtra pro lubitu poſſit ciere
&amp; ſiſtere membrorum motus, quacunque tandem
ratione id fiat. Hoc certè conſtat, corpora moveri
ad nutum animae, eamque proinde haud ineptè
dici poſſe principium motus; particulare quidem
&amp; ſubordinatum, quodque ipſum dependeat à primo
&amp; univerſali principio.</p>
                  <p>26. Corpora gravia feruntur deorſum, etſi nullo
impulſu apparente agitata, non tamen exiſtiman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
propterea in iis contineri principium motus:
cujus rei hanc rationem aſſignat Ariſtoteles, <hi>gravia
&amp; levia,</hi> inquit, <hi>non moventur à ſeipſis, id enim

eâdemque certâ &amp; conſtanti lege centrum telluris

vel facultas ulla motum iſtum ſiſtendi, minuendi
vel, niſi pro rata proportione, augendi, aut deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
ullo modo immutandi: habent adeò ſe paſſivè.
Porro idem, ſtrictè &amp; accuratè loquendo, dicendum
de corporibus percuſſivis. Corpora iſta quamdiu
moventur, ut &amp; in ipſo percuſſionis momento, ſe
gerunt paſſivè, perinde ſcilicet atque cum quieſcunt.
Corpus iners tam agit quam corpus motum, ſi res
ad verum exigatur: id quod agnoſcit Newtonus,
ubi ait, vim inertiae eſſe eandem cum impetu.
Corpus autem iners &amp; quietum nihil agit, ergo nec
motum.</p>
                  <p>27. Revera corpus aequè perſeverat in utrovis
ſtatu, vel motûs vel quietis. Iſta vero perſeveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia
non magis dicenda eſt actio corporis, quam
exiſtentia ejuſdem actio diceretur. Perſeverantia
nihil aliud eſt quam continuatio in eodem modo
exiſtendi, quae propriè dici actio non poteſt.
Caeterùm reſiſtentiam, quam experimur in ſiſtendo
corpore moto, ejus actionem eſſe fingimus vana
ſpecie deluſi. Revera enim iſta reſiſtentia quam
ſentimus, paſſio eſt in nobis, neque arguit corpus
agere, ſed nos pati: conſtat utique nos idem paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuros
fuiſſe, ſive corpus illud à ſe moveatur, ſive ab
alio principio impellatur.</p>
                  <p>28. Actio &amp; reactio dicuntur eſſe in corporibus:
nee incommodè ad demonſtrationes mechanicas.
Sed cavendum, ne propterea ſupponamus virtutem
aliquam realem quae motûs cauſa, ſive principium
ſit, eſſe in iis. Etenim voces illae eodem modo
intelligendae ſunt ac vox <hi>attractio,</hi> &amp; quemadmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum
haec eſt hypotheſis ſolummodo mathematica
non autem qualitas phyſica; idem etiam de illis

ſive motus iſte cauſari ſupponatur per actionem
corporum ſe mutuo attrahentium, ſive per actionem
agentis alicujus à corporibus diverſi impellentis

concedantur effectus ſenſibiles, &amp; ratiocinia

vim horum effectuum cauſatricem, eſſe in corpore,
ſive in agente incorporeo.</p>
                  <p>29. Auferantur ex idea corporis extenſio, ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditas,

ſunt ad motum indifferentes, nec in ſe quidquam
habent, quod motus principium dici poſſit. Hoc
ex ipſis ideis noſtris perſpicuum eſt. Si igitur voce
<hi>corpus</hi> ſignificatur, id quod concipimus: planè
conſtat inde non peti poſſe principium motus: pars
ſcilicet nulla aut attributum illius cauſa efficiens vera

                  <p>30. Datur res cogitans activa quam principium

l. 8. Plato inſuper in Timaeo tradit machinam
hanc corpoream, ſeu mundum viſibilem agitari &amp;

Quinetiam hodie philoſophi Carteſiani principium
motuum naturalium Deum agnoſcunt. Et New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonus
paſſim nec obſcurè innuit, non ſolummodo
motum ab initio à numine profectum eſſe, verum
adhuc ſyſtema mundanum ab eodem actu moveri.
Hoc ſacris literis conſonum eſt: hoc ſcholaſticorum
calculo comprobatur. Nam etſi peripatetici na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turam

interpretantur tamen naturam naturantem eſſe
Deum. Intelligunt nimirum corpora omnia ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tematis

                  <p>33. Caeterùm qui principium vitale corporibus
tribuunt, obſcurum aliquid &amp; rebus parùm con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniens

<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0374600900:244"/>
autem hujus ſaeculi doctiſſimi, pro principio in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dubitato
ponunt, omne corpus perſeverare in ſtatu
ſuo, vel quietis vel motûs uniformis in directum,
niſi quatenus aliunde cogitur ſtatum illum mutare;
è contrario, in anima ſentimus eſſe facultatem tam
ſtatum ſuum quam aliarum rerum mutandi; id
quod propriè dicitur vitale, animamque à corpori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
longe diſcriminat.</p>
                  <p>34. Motum &amp; quietem in corporibus recertiores
conſiderant velut duos ſtatus exiſtendi, in quorum
utrovis corpus omne ſua natura iners permaneret,
nulla vi externa urgente. Unde colligere licet,
eandem eſſe cauſam motûs &amp; quietis, quae eſt exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentiae

Itaque cognitionem de Deo vel ſupponit philoſophia

natura motus, atque is quidem, cum ſenſibus
clare percipiatur non tam natura ſua, quam doctis

atque ab omnibus aliis rebus ſejunctam,
contemplari ſtudent. Verùm idea illa tenuiſſima
&amp; ſubtiliſſima intellectûs aciem eludit: id quod
quilibet ſecum meditando experiri poteſt. Hinc
naſcuntur magnae difficultates de natura motus, &amp;
definitiones, ipſa re quam illuſtrare debent, longe
obſcuriores. Hujuſmodi ſunt definitiones illae
Ariſtotelis &amp; Scholaſticorum, qui motum dicunt
eſſe actum <hi>mobilis, quatenus eſt mobile, vel actum en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis

eſt illud, viri inter recentiores celebris, qui aſſerit
<hi>nihil in motu eſſe reale praeter momentaneum illud quod

conſtat, horum &amp; ſimilium definitionum auctores in

omni temporis &amp; ſpatii conſideratione, explicare,
ſed qua ratione abſtracta illa motus quinteſſentia (ut

                  <p>44. Neque hoc contenti, ulterius pergunt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſque

in hiſce rebus diſcutiendis, ſtantibus iis quae ſupra

                  <p>45. Multi etiam per <hi>tranſitum</hi> motu deſiniunt,

                  <p>46. Sed hujuſmodi minutiis diſtineri piget. Satis

autem hujus generis ſit, id omne motus commune

acceptum.</p>
                  <p>47. Et quemadmodum, ex una parte nimia ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtractio

motus efficiente confundere. Unde accidit ut
motus ſit quaſi biformis, unam faciem ſenſibus ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viam,
alteram caliginoſa nocte obvolutam habens.
Inde obſcuritas &amp; confuſio, &amp; varia de motu para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxa

                  <p>51. Juvat multum, ſicut in aliis omnibus, ita in

vix credo in diſputationem trahi potuiſſe, utrùm

                  <p>52. Peripatetici pro varietate mutationum, quas

qualitas poſitiva. Verùm qualis tandem extenſio
eſt illa, quae nec dividi poteſt, nec menſurari,
cujus nullam partem, nec ſenſu percipere, nec

niſi per res ſenſibiles. Cum ergo ſpatium abſolutum
nullo modo in ſenſus incurrat, neceſſe eſt ut inutile
prorlus ſit ad diſtinctionem motuum. Praeterea,
determinatio ſive directio motui eſſentialis eſt, ilia
vero in relatione conſiſtit. Ergo impoſſibile eſt ut
motus abſolutus concipiatur.</p>
                  <p>64. Poriò, quoniam pro diverſitate loci relativi,
varius ſit motus ejuſdem corporis, quinimò, uno
reſpectu moveri, altero quieſcere dici quidpiam
poſſit: ad determinandum motum verum &amp; quie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
veram, quo ſcilicet tollatur ambiguitas, &amp;
conſulatur mechanicae philoſophorum, qui ſyſtema
rerum latius contemplantur, ſatis fuerit ſpatium
relativum fixarum coelo, tanquam quieſcente ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,
concluſum adhibere, loco ſpatii abſoluti. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
autem &amp; quies tali ſpatio relativo definiti, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modè
adhiberi poſſunt loco abſolutorum, qui ab il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis
nullo ſymptomate diſcerni poſſunt. Etenim
imprimantur utcunque vires: ſint quicunque cona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus:
concedamus motum diſtingui per actiones in
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:0374600900:257"/>
corpora exercitas; nunquam tamen inde ſequetur,
dari ſpatium illud, &amp; locum abſolutum, ejuſque
mutationem eſſe locum verum.</p>
                  <p>65. Leges motuum, effectuſque, &amp; theoremata
eorundem proportiones &amp; calculos continentia, pro
diverſis viarum figuris, accelerationibus itidem &amp;
directionibus diverſis, mediiſque plus minuſve re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtentibus,
haec omnia conſtant ſine calculatione
motus abſoluti. Uti vel ex eo patet quod, quum
ſecundum illorum principia qui motum abſolutum
inducunt, nullo ſymptomate ſcire liceat, utrum
integra rerum compages quieſcat, an moveatur
uniformiter in directum, perſpicuum ſit motum ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutum
nullius corporis cognoſci pſſe.</p>
                  <p>66. Ex dictis patet ad veram motus naturam
perſpiciendam ſummopere juvaturum: 1<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guere
inter hypotheſes mathematicas &amp; naturas
rerum. 2<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Cavere ab abſtractionibus. 3<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiderare
motum tanquam aliquid ſenſible, vel ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem
imaginabile: menſuriſque relativis eſſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentos.
Quae ſi fecerimus, ſimul clariſſima quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que
philoſophiae mechanicae theoremata, quibus
referantur naturae receſſus, mundique ſyſtema cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culis
humanis ſubjicitur, manebunt intemerata:
et motus contemplatio à mille minutiis, ſubtilitatibus,
ideiſque abſtractis libera evadet. Atque haec de
natura motûs dicta ſufficiant.</p>
                  <p>67. Reſtat, ut diſſeramus de cauſa communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis
motuum. Eſſe autem vim impreſſam in
corpus mobile, cauſam motus in eo plerique exiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant.
Veruntamen, illos non aſſignare cauſam
motus cognitam, &amp; à corpore motuque diſtinctam,
ex praemiſſis conſtat. Patet inſuper vim non eſſe
rem certam &amp; determinatam, ex eo quod viri ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi
de illa multùm diverſa, immo contraria, profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant,
ſalva tamen in conſequentiis veritate. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quidem
Newtonus ait vim impreſſam conſiſtere in
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0374600900:258"/>
actione ſola, eſſeque actionem exercitam in corpus
ad ſtatum ejus mutandum, nec poſt actionem ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nere.
Torricellius cumulum quendam ſive aggre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatum
virium impreſſarum per percuſſionem in
corpus mobile recipi, ibidemque manere atque im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petum
conſtituere contendit. Idem fere Borellus
aliique praedicant. At vero, tametſi inter ſe pug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nare
videantur Newtonus &amp; Torricellius, nihilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minus,
quum dum ſinguli ſibi conſentanea profe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runt,
res ſatis commodè ab utriſque explicatur.
Quippe vires omnes corporibus attributae, tam ſunt
hypotheſes mathematicae quam vires atrtactivae in
planetis &amp; ſole. Caeterùm entia mathematica in
rerum natura ſtabilem eſſentiam non habent: pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
autem à notione definientis: unde eadem res
diverſimodè explicari poteſt.</p>
                  <p>68. Statuamus motum novum in corpore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſo
conſervari, ſive per vim inſitam, qua corpus
quodlibet perſeverat in ſtatu ſuo, vel motus, vel
quietis uniformis in directum: ſive per vim im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſam,
durante percuſſione in corpus percuſſum
receptam ibidemque permanentem, idem erit quoad
rem, differentia exiſtente in nominibus tantùm.
Similiter, ubi mobile percutiens perdit, &amp; percuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum
acquirit motum, parum refert diſputate, utrum
motus acquiſitus ſit idem numero cum motu per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dito,
ducit enim in minutias metaphyſicas, &amp;
prorſus nominales de identitate. Itaque ſive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camus
motum tranſire à percutiente in percuſſum,
ſive in percuſſo motum de novo generari, deſtrui
autem in percutiente, res eodem recidit. Utro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bique
intelligitur unum corpus motum perdere, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terum
acquirere, &amp; praeterea nihil.</p>
                  <p>69. Mentem, quae agitat &amp; continet univerſam
hancce molem corpoream, eſtque cauſa vera effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciens
motus, eandem eſſe, propriè &amp; ſtrictè lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quendo,
cauſam communicationis ejuſdem haud
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0374600900:259"/>
negaverim. In philoſophiâ tamen phyſicâ, cauſas
&amp; ſolutiones phaenomenôn à principiis mechanicis
petere oportet. Phyſicè igitur res explicatur non
aſſignando ejus cauſam verè agentem &amp; incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ream,
ſed demonſtrando ejus connexionem cum
principiis mechanicis: cujuſmodi eſt illud, <hi>actio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem
&amp; reactionem eſſe ſemper contrarias &amp; aequales,</hi> à
quo, tanquam fonte &amp; principio primario, eruuntur
regulae de motuum communicatione, quae à neo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tericis,
magno ſcientiarum bono, jam ante repertae
ſunt &amp; demonſtratae.</p>
                  <p>70. Nobis ſatis fuerit, ſi innuamus principium
illud alio modo declarari potuiſſe. Nam ſi vera
rerum natura, potius quam abſtracta matheſis ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetur,
videbitur rectius dici, in attractione vel
percuſſione paſſionem corporum, quam actionem,
eſſe utrobique aequalem. Exempli gratia, lapis
fune equo alligatus tantum trahitur verſus equum,
quantum equus verſus lapidem: corpus etiam mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
in aliud quieſcens impactum, patitur eandem
mutationem cum corpore quieſcente. Et quoad
effectum realem, percutiens eſt item percuſſum,
percuſſumque percutiens. Mutatio autem illa eſt
utrobique, tam in corpore equi quam in lapide,
tam in moto quam in quieſcente, paſſio mera.
Eſſe autem vim, virtutem, aut actionem corpoream
talium effectuum verè &amp; propriè cauſatricem non
conſtat. Corpus motum in quieſcens impingitur,
loquimur tamen activè, dicentes illud hoc impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lere:
nec abſurdè in mechanicis, ubi ideae mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticae
potius quam verae rerum naturae ſpectantur.</p>
                  <p>71. In phyſica, ſenſus &amp; experientia, quae ad
effectus apparentes ſolummodo pertingunt, locum
habent; in mechanica, notiones abſtractae mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticorum
admittuntur. In philoſophia prima ſeu
metaphyſica agitur de rebus incorporeis, de cauſis,
veritate, &amp; exiſtentia rerum. Phyſicus ſeries ſive
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0374600900:260"/>
ſucceſſiones rerum ſenſibilium contemplatur, qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus
legibus connectuntur, &amp; quo ordine, quid
praecedit tanquam cauſa, quid ſequitur tanquam
effectus animadvertens. Atque hac ratione dici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus
corpus motum eſſe cauſam motûs in altero,
vel ei motum imprimere, trahere etiam, aut im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellere.
Quo ſenſu cauſae ſecundae corporeae in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligi
debent, nullâ ratione habità verae ſedis virium,
vel potentiarum actricum, aut cauſae realis cui inſunt.
Porro, dici poſſunt cauſae vel principia mechanica,
ultra corpus, figuram, motum, etiam axiomata
ſcientiae mechanicae primaria, tanquam cauſae
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequentium ſpectata.</p>
                  <p>72. Cauſae verè activae meditatione tantum, &amp;
ratiocinio è tenebris erui quibus involvuntur poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunt,
&amp; aliquatenus cognoſci. Spectat autem ad
philoſophiam primam, ſeu metaphyſicam, de iis
agere. Quod ſi cuique ſcientiae provincia ſua tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buatur,
limites aſſignentur, principia &amp; objecta ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curatè
diſtinguantur, quae ad ſingulas pertinent,
tractare licuerit majore, cum facilitate, tum per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuitate.</p>
