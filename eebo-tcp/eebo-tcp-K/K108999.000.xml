            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.</head>
            <p>THE AUTHOR of the following ESSAY was ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous only for the honour of <hi>Shakeſpeare:</hi> he hath however, in <hi>his own</hi> capacity, little reaſon to complain of <hi>occaſional</hi> Criticks, or Criticks <hi>by profeſſion.</hi> The very FEW, who have been pleaſed to controvert any part of his Doctrine, have favoured him with better manners, than arguments; and claim his thanks for a further opportunity of demonſtrating the futility of <hi>Theoretick</hi> reaſoning againſt <hi>Matter of Fact.</hi> It is indeed ſtrange, that any <hi>real</hi> Friends of our immortal POET ſhould be ſtill willing to force him into a ſituation, which is not tenable: treat him as a <hi>learned</hi> Man, and what ſhall excuſe the moſt groſs violations of Hiſtory, Chronology, and Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy?</p>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> is the Motto of every <hi>Polemick:</hi> like his Brethren at the <hi>Amphitheatre,</hi> he holds it a merit to <hi>die hard</hi>; and will not ſay, <hi>Enough,</hi> though the Battle be decided. "Were it ſhewn, ſays ſome one, that the old Bard borrowed <hi>all</hi> his alluſions from <hi>Engliſh</hi> books then publiſhed, our <hi>Eſſayiſt</hi> might have poſſibly eſtabliſhed his Syſtem."
<pb facs="tcp:0048001200:4"/>
—In good time! —This had ſcarcely been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted by <hi>Peter Burman</hi> himſelf, with the Library of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> before him. — "Truly, as Mr. <hi>Dogberry</hi> ſays, for <hi>mine own</hi> part, if I were as tedious as a King, I could find in my heart to beſtow it all on this Subject:" but where ſhould I meet with a Reader? — When the main Pillars are taken away, the whole Building falls in courſe: Nothing hath been, or can be, pointed out, which is not eaſily removed; or rather, which was not <hi>virtually</hi> removed before: a very little <hi>Analogy</hi> will do the buſineſs. I ſhall there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore have no occaſion to trouble myſelf any further; and may venture to call my Pamphlet, in the words of a pleaſant Declaimer againſt <hi>Sermons on the thirtieth of January,</hi> "an Anſwer to every thing that ſhall hereafter be written on the Subject."</p>
            <p>But "this method of reaſoning will prove any one ignorant of the Languages, who hath written when Tranſlations were extant." — <hi>Shade</hi> of <hi>Burgerſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius!</hi> — does it follow, becauſe <hi>Shakeſpeare's</hi> early life was incompatible with a courſe of Education—whoſe Contemporaries, Friends and Foes, nay, and himſelf likewiſe, agree in his want of what is uſually called <hi>Literature</hi> —whoſe miſtakes from equivocal Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and even typographical Errors, cannot poſſibly be accounted for otherwiſe, —that <hi>Locke,</hi> to whom not one of theſe circumſtances is applicable, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood no <hi>Greek?</hi> —I ſuſpect, <hi>Rollin's</hi> Opinion of our Philoſopher was not founded on this argument.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> wanted not the Stilts of Languages to raiſe him above all other men. The quotation from <hi>Lilly</hi> in the <hi>Taming of the Shrew,</hi> if indeed it be his, ſtrongly proves the extent of his reading: had he known <hi>Terence,</hi> he would not have quoted erroneouſly
<pb facs="tcp:0048001200:5"/>
from his <hi>Grammar.</hi> Every one hath met with men in common life, who, according to the language of the <hi>Water-poet,</hi> "got only from <hi>Poſſum</hi> to <hi>Poſſet,"</hi> and yet will throw out a line occaſionally from their <hi>Accidence</hi> or their <hi>Cato de Moribus</hi> with tolerable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety. — If, however, the old Editions be truſted in this paſſage, our Author's memory ſomewhat fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him in point of <hi>Concord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The rage of <hi>Paralleliſms</hi> is almoſt over, and in truth nothing can be more abſurd. "THIS was ſtolen from <hi>one</hi> Claſſick, — THAT from <hi>another</hi>;"— and had I not ſtept in to his reſcue, poor <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> had been ſtript as naked of ornament, as when he firſt <hi>held Horſes</hi> at the door of the Playhouſe.</p>
            <p>The late ingenious and modeſt Mr. <hi>Dodſley</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared himſelf
<q>"Untutor'd in the lore of <hi>Greece</hi> or <hi>Rome:"</hi>
               </q>
Yet let us take a paſſage at a venture from any of his performances, and a thouſand to one, it is ſtolen. Suppoſe it be his celebrated Compliment to the <hi>Ladies,</hi> in one of his earlieſt pieces, <hi>The Toy-ſhop:</hi> "A good Wife makes the cares of the World ſit eaſy, and adds a ſweetneſs to its pleaſures; ſhe is a Man's beſt Companion in Proſperity, and his only Friend in Adverſity; the carefulleſt preſerver of his Health, and the kindeſt Attendant in his Sickneſs; a faithful Adviſer in Diſtreſs, a Comforter in Afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a prudent Manager in all his domeſtic Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs."—<hi>Plainly,</hi> from a fragment of <hi>Euripides</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by <hi>Stobaeus.</hi>

               <note n="a" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Seward</hi> in his Preface to <hi>Beaumont</hi> and <hi>Fletcher,</hi> 10 Vol. 8vo. 1750.</note> is a vaſt garden of criticiſm:" and certainly no one can be favoured with more weeders <hi>gratis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But how often, my dear Sir, are weeds and flowers torn up indiſcriminately?— the ravaged ſpot is re-planted in a moment, and a profuſion of cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical thorns thrown over it for ſecurity.</p>
            <p>"A prudent man therefore would not venture his fingers amongſt them."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0048001200:8"/>Be however in little pain for your friend, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gards himſelf ſufficiently to be cautious:—yet he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts with confidence, that no improvement can be expected, whilſt the natural ſoil is miſtaken for a hot-bed, and the Natives of the banks of <hi>Avon</hi> are ſcientifically choked with the culture of exoticks.</p>
            <p>Thus much for metaphor; it is contrary to the <hi>Statute</hi> to fly out ſo early: but who can tell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it may not be demonſtrated by ſome critick or other, that a deviation from rule is peculiarly happy in an Eſſay of <hi>Shakeſpeare!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You have long known my opinion concerning the literary acquiſitions of our immortal Dramatiſt; and remember how I congratulated myſelf on my coincidence with the laſt and beſt of his Editors. I told you however, that his <hi>ſmall Latin and leſs Greek</hi>
               <note n="b" place="bottom">This paſſage of <hi>Ben. Jonſon,</hi> ſo often quoted, is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en us in the admirable preface to the late Edition, with a various reading, "ſmall Latin and <hi>no</hi> Greek," which hath been held up to the Publick for a modern ſophiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation: yet whether an error or not, it was adopted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Century ago by <hi>W. Towers</hi> in a Panegyrick on <hi>Cartwright.</hi> His Eulogy, with more than fifty others, on this now forgotten Poet, was prefixed to the Edit. 1651.</note> would ſtill be litigated, and you ſee very aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly that I was not miſtaken. The trumpet hath been ſounded againſt "the darling project of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> as one of the illiterate vulgar;" and indeed to ſo good purpoſe, that I would by all means recommend the performer to the army of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0048001200:9"/>
the <hi>braying Faction,</hi> recorded by <hi>Cervantes.</hi> The teſtimony of his contemporaries is again diſputed; conſtant tradition is oppoſed by flimſy arguments; and nothing is heard, but confuſion and nonſenſe. One could ſcarcely imagine this a topick very like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to inflame the paſſions: it is aſſerted by <hi>Dryden,</hi> that "thoſe who accuſe him to have wanted learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, give him the greateſt commendation;" yet an attack upon an article of faith hath been uſually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with more temper and complacence, than the unfortunate opinion, which I am about to defend.</p>
            <p>But let us previouſly lament with every lover of <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> that the Queſtion was not fully diſcuſſed by Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> himſelf: what he ſees intuitively, others muſt arrive at by a ſeries of proofs; and I have not time to <hi>teach</hi> with preciſion: be contented therefore with a few curſory obſervations, as they may happen to ariſe from the Chaos of Papers, you have ſo often laughed at, "a ſtock ſufficient to ſet up an <hi>Editor in form."</hi> I am convinced of the ſtrength of my cauſe, and ſuperior to any little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from ſophiſtical arrangements.</p>
            <p>General poſitions without proofs will probably have no great weight on either ſide, yet it may not ſeem fair to ſuppreſs them: take them therefore as their authors occur to me, and we will afterward proceed to particulars.</p>
            <p>The teſtimony of <hi>Ben.</hi> ſtands foremoſt; and

            <p>One of the firſt and moſt vehement aſſertors of the learning of <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> was the Editor of his Poems, the well-known Mr. <hi>Gildon</hi>;<note n="f" place="bottom">Hence perhaps the <hi>ill-ſtar'd rage</hi> between this Critick and his elder Brother, <hi>John Dennis,</hi> ſo pathetically la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented in the <hi>Dunciad.</hi> Whilſt the former was perſuaded, that "the man who doubts of the Learning of <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> hath none of his own:" the latter, above regarding the attack in his <hi>private</hi> capacity, declares with great pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triotic vehemence, that "he who allows <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> had Learning, and a familiar acquaintance with the Ancients, ought to be looked upon as a detractor from the Glory of <hi>Great Britain."

            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ſuppoſed "little ground for the common opinion of his want of learning:" once indeed he made a proper diſtinction between <hi>learning</hi> and <hi>lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages,</hi> as I would be underſtood to do in my Title-page; but unfortunately he forgot it in the courſe of his diſquiſition, and endeavoured to perſuade himſelf that <hi>Shakeſpeare's</hi> acquaintance with the Ancients might be actually proved by the ſame medium as <hi>Jonſon's.</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Theobald</hi> is "very unwilling to allow him ſo poor a ſcholar, as many have laboured to repreſent him;" and yet is "cautious of declaring too poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively on the other ſide the queſtion."</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Warburton</hi> hath expoſed the weakneſs of ſome arguments from <hi>ſuſpected</hi> imitations; and yet offers others, which, I doubt not, he could as eaſily have refuted.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Upton</hi> wonders "with what kind of reaſoning any one could be ſo far impoſed upon, as to imagine that <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> had no learning;" and laſhes with much zeal and ſatisfaction "the pride and pertneſs of dunces, who under ſuch a name would gladly ſhelter their own idleneſs and ignorance."</p>

This appears very probable; and a pleaſant proof it is of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral learning of the times, and of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular. I wonder, he did not corroborate it with an extract from her injunctions to her Clergy, that "ſuch as were but <hi>mean Readers</hi> ſhould peruſe over before, once or twice, the Chapters and Homilies, to the intent they might read to the better under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the people."</p>
            <p>Dr. <hi>Grey</hi> declares, that <hi>Shakeſpeare's</hi> knowledge in the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> tongues cannot <hi>reaſonably</hi> be call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in queſtion. Dr. <hi>Dodd</hi> ſuppoſes it <hi>proved,</hi> that he was not ſuch a novice in learning and antiquity as <hi>ſome people</hi> would pretend. And to cloſe the whole, for I ſuſpect you to be tired of quotation, Mr. <hi>Whalley,</hi> the ingenious Editor of <hi>Jonſon,</hi> hath written a piece expreſsly on this ſide the queſtion: perhaps from a very excuſable partiality, he was willing to draw

               <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> from the field of Nature to claſſick ground, where alone, he knew, his Author could poſſibly cope with him.</p>
            <p>Theſe criticks, and many others their coadjutors, have ſuppoſed themſelves able to trace <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> in the writings of the Ancients; and have ſometimes perſuaded us of their own learning, whatever became of their Author's. Plagiariſms have been diſcovered in every natural deſcription and every moral ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Indeed by the kind aſſiſtance of the various <hi>Excerpta, Sententiae,</hi> and <hi>Flores,</hi> this buſineſs may be effected with very little expenſe of time or ſagacity; as <hi>Addiſon</hi> hath demonſtrated in his Comment on <hi>Chevy-chace,</hi> and <hi>Wagſtaff</hi> on <hi>Tom Thumb:</hi> and I my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf will engage to give you quotations from the elder <hi>Engliſh</hi> writers (for to own the truth, I was once idle enough to collect ſuch) which ſhall carry with them at leaſt an equal degree of ſimilarity.

For we cannot (alas) together pray, both for victorie, for our countrie, and for ſafety of thy life alſo: but a worlde of grievous curſes, yea more then any mortall enemie can heape uppon us, are forcibly wrapt up in our prayers. For the bitter ſoppe of moſt harde choyce is offered thy wife and children, to forgoe the one of the two: either to loſe the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſone of thy ſelfe, or the nurſe of their natiue contrie. For my ſelfe (my ſonne) I am determined not to tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, till fortune in my life time doe make an ende of this warre. For if I cannot perſuade thee, rather to doe good unto both parties, then to ouerthrowe and deſtroye the one, preferring loue and nature before the malice and calamitie of warres: thou ſhalt ſee, my ſonne, and truſt unto it, thou ſhalt no ſoner marche forward to aſſault thy countrie, but thy foote ſhall tread upon thy mother's wombe, that brought thee firſt into this world."</p>

But he is miſtaken: this too was the work of <hi>Boccace,</hi> and printed at <hi>Ferrara</hi> in Folio, <hi>con il commento di Andrea Baſſi,</hi> 1475. I have ſeen a copy of it, and a Tranſlation into modern <hi>Greek,</hi> in the noble Library of the very learned and communicative Dr. <hi>Aſkew.</hi>

               <hi>Pericles</hi> is one of the Plays omitted in the later Editions, as well as the early Folio's, and not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly; tho' it was publiſhed many years before the death of <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> with his name in the Title-page. <hi>Aulus Gellius</hi> informs us, that ſome Plays are aſcribed abſolutely to <hi>Plautus,</hi> which he only <hi>retouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>poliſhed</hi>; and this is undoubtedly the caſe with our Author likewiſe. The revival of this perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, which <hi>Ben. Jonſon</hi> calls <hi>ſtale</hi> and <hi>mouldy,</hi> was probably his earlieſt attempt in the Drama. I know, that another of theſe diſcarded pieces, the <hi>Yorkſhire Tragedy,</hi> hath been frequently called ſo; but moſt certainly it was not written by our Poet at all: nor indeed was it printed in his life-time.

               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0048001200:32"/>Sometimes a very little matter detects a forgery. You may remember a Play called the <hi>Double Falſhood,</hi> which Mr. <hi>Theobald</hi> was deſirous of palming upon the world for a poſthumous one of <hi>Shakeſpeare:</hi> and I ſee it is claſſed as ſuch in the laſt Edition of the <hi>Bodleian</hi> Catalogue.

               </q>
And in another place,
<q>"You have an <hi>Aſpect,</hi> Sir, of wondrous wiſdom."</q>
The word <hi>Aſpect,</hi> you perceive, is here accented on the <hi>firſt</hi> Syllable, which, I am confident, in <hi>any</hi> ſenſe of it, was never the caſe in the time of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi>; though it may ſometimes appear to be ſo, when we do not obſerve a preceding <hi>Eliſion.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Some of the profeſſed Imitators of our old Poets have not attended to this and many other <hi>Minutiae:</hi>

I could point out to you ſeveral performances in the reſpective <hi>Styles</hi> of <hi>Chaucer, Spenſer,</hi> and <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> which the <hi>imitated</hi> Bard could not poſſibly have either read or conſtrued.</p>
            <p>This very accent hath troubled the Annotators on <hi>Milton.</hi> Dr. <hi>Bentley</hi> obſerves it to be "a <hi>tone</hi> different from the preſent uſe." Mr. <hi>Manwaring,</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of Harmony and Numbers,</hi> very ſolemnly informs us, that "this Verſe is defective both in Accent and Quantity, B. 3. V. 266.

Enough of ſuch Commentators.—The celebrated

Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> had a <hi>Spirit,</hi> who would ſometimes conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend to correct him, when peccant in <hi>Quantity:</hi> and it had been kind of him to have a little aſſiſted the <hi>Wights</hi> abovementioned. —<hi>Milton</hi> affected the <hi>Antique</hi>; but it may ſeem more extraordinary, that the old Accent ſhould be adopted in <hi>Hudibras.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After all, the <hi>Double Falſhood</hi> is ſuperior to <hi>Theobald.</hi> One paſſage, and one only in the whole Play, he pretended to have written:
<q>
                  <l>——— "Strike up, my Maſters;</l>
                  <l>"But touch the Strings with a religious ſoftneſs:</l>
                  <l>"Teach ſound to languiſh thro' the Night's dull Ear,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe lines were particularly admired; and his vanity could not reſiſt the opportunity of claiming them: but his claim had been more eaſily allowed to <hi>any other</hi> part of the performance.</p>
            <p>To whom then ſhall we aſcribe it? — Somebody hath told us, who ſhould ſeem to be a <hi>Noſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger</hi> by his argument, that, let <hi>Accents</hi> be how they will, it is called <hi>an original Play of William Shakeſpeare</hi> in the <hi>King's Patent,</hi> prefixed to Mr. <hi>Theobald's</hi> Edition, 1728, and conſequently there <hi>could</hi> be no fraud in the matter. Whilff, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Laureat, Mr. <hi>Victor,</hi> remarks, (and were it true, it would be certainly deciſive) that the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0048001200:35"/>
Plot is borrowed from a Novel of <hi>Cervantes,</hi> not publiſhed 'till the year after <hi>Shakeſpeare's</hi> death. But unluckily the ſame Novel appears in a part of <hi>Don Quixote,</hi> which was printed in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> 1605, and in <hi>Engliſh</hi> by <hi>Shelton,</hi> 1612. — The ſame reaſoning however, which exculpated our Author from the <hi>Yorkſhire Tragedy,</hi> may be applied on the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
            <p>But you want <hi>my</hi> opinion: —and from every mark of Style and Manner, I make no doubt of aſcribing it to <hi>Shirley.</hi> Mr. <hi>Langbaine</hi> informs us, that he left ſome Plays in MS. — Theſe were written about the time of the <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> when the <hi>Accent</hi> in queſtion was more generally altered.</p>
            <p>Perhaps the miſtake aroſe from an <hi>abbreviation</hi> of the name. Mr. <hi>Dodſley</hi> knew not that the Tragedy of <hi>Andromana</hi> was <hi>Shirley's,</hi> from the very ſame cauſe. Thus a whole ſtream of Biographers tell us, that <hi>Marſton's</hi> Plays were printed at <hi>London,</hi> 1633, "by the care of <hi>William Shakeſpeare,</hi> the famous Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian."—Here again I ſuppoſe, in ſome Tranſcript, the real Publiſher's name, <hi>William Sheares,</hi> was <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>breviated.</hi> No one hath protracted the life of <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare</hi> beyond 1616, except Mr. <hi>Hume</hi>; who is pleaſed to add a year to it, in contradiction to all manner of evidence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shirley</hi> is ſpoken of with contempt in <hi>Mac Flecknoe</hi>;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0048001200:36"/>
but his Imagination is ſometimes fine to an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary degree. I recollect a paſſage in the fourth book of the <hi>Paradiſe Loſt,</hi> which hath been ſuſpected of <hi>Imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as a <hi>prettineſs</hi> below the Genius of <hi>Milton:</hi> I mean, where <hi>Uriel</hi> glides <hi>backward and forward</hi> to Heaven on a <hi>Sun-beam.</hi> Dr. <hi>Newton</hi> informs us, that this might poſſibly be hinted by a Picture of <hi>Annibal Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racci</hi> in the King of <hi>France's</hi> Cabinet: but I am apt to believe that <hi>Milton</hi> had been ſtruck with a Portrait in <hi>Shirley. Fernando,</hi> in the Comedy of the <hi>Brothers,</hi> 1652, deſcribes <hi>Jacinta</hi> at <hi>Veſpers:</hi>
               <q>

The paſſages on which theſe ſagacious remarks are made, occur in the <hi>Midſummer Night's Dream</hi>; and exhibit, we ſee, a clear proof of acquaintance with the <hi>Latin</hi> Claſſicks.

            <p>You perceive, my dear Sir, how vague and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate ſuch arguments muſt be: for in fact this <hi>ſweet Swan of Thames,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> calls him, hath more ſcraps of <hi>Latin,</hi> and alluſions to antiquity than are any where to be met with in the writings of <hi>Shakeſpeare.</hi> I am ſorry to trouble you with trifles, yet what muſt be done, when grave men inſiſt upon them?</p>

"They who are in ſuch aſtoniſhment at the <hi>learning</hi> of <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> forget that the Pagan Imagery was familiar to all the Poets of his time; and that abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of this ſort of learning was to be picked up from almoſt every <hi>Engliſh</hi> book, that he could take into his hands." For not to inſiſt upon <hi>Stephen Bate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's</hi> Golden booke of the leaden Goddes, 1577, and ſeveral other laborious compilations on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, all this and much more Mythology might as perfectly have been learned from the <hi>Teſtament of Creſeide,</hi>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Upton,</hi> not contented with <hi>Heathen</hi> learning, when he finds it in the text, muſt neceſſarily ſuper-add it, when it appears to be wanting; becauſe <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare</hi> moſt certainly hath loſt it by accident!</p>
            <p>In <hi>Much ado about Nothing,</hi> Don <hi>Pedro</hi> ſays of the inſenſible <hi>Benedict,</hi> "He hath twice or thrice cut <hi>Cupid's</hi> bow-ſtring, and the little <hi>Hangman</hi> dare not ſhoot at him."</p>
            <p>This mythology is not recollected in the Ancients, and therefore the critick hath no doubt but his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor wrote <hi>"Henchman,—a Page, Puſio:</hi> and <hi>this</hi> word ſeeming too hard for the Printer, he tranſlated the

            <p>I know it may be objected on the authority of ſuch Biographers, as <hi>Theophilus Cibber,</hi> and the Writer of the Life of Sir <hi>Philip,</hi> prefixed to the modern Editions; that the <hi>Arcadia</hi> was not publiſhed before 1613, and conſequently too late for this imitation: but I have a Copy in my own poſſeſſion, printed for <hi>W. Ponſonbie,</hi> 1590, 4to. which hath eſcaped the notice of the induſtrious <hi>Ames,</hi> and the reſt of our typographical Antiquaries.</p>
            <p>Thus likewiſe every word of antiquity is to be cut down to the claſſical ſtandard.</p>
            <p>In a Note on the Prologue to <hi>Troilus</hi> and <hi>Creſſida,</hi> (which, by the way, is not met with in the <hi>Quarto</hi>) Mr. <hi>Theobald</hi> informs us, that the very <hi>names</hi> of the gates of <hi>Troy,</hi> have been barbarouſly demoliſhed by the Editors: and a deal of learned duſt he makes in
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0048001200:45"/>
ſetting them right again; much however to Mr. <hi>Heath's</hi> ſatisfaction. Indeed the learning is modeſtly withdrawn from the later Editions, and we are quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſtructed to read,
<q>
                  <l>

But had he looked into the <hi>Troye boke</hi> of <hi>Lydgate,</hi> inſtead of puzzling himſelf with <hi>Dares Phrygius,</hi> he would have found the horrid demolition to have been neither the work of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> nor his Editors.</p>

            </p>
            <p>Here we ſeem fairly caught; — for <hi>Scaliger's</hi> work was never, as the term goes, <hi>done into Engliſh.</hi> But luckily in an old tranſlation from the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Peter Le Loier,</hi> entitled, <hi>A treatiſe of Specters, or ſtraunge Sights, Viſions and Apparitions appearing ſenſibly unto men,</hi> we have this identical Story from <hi>Scaliger:</hi> and what is ſtill more, a marginal Note gives us in all probability the very fact alluded to, as well as the word of <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> "Another Gentleman of this quality liued of late in Deuon neere Exceſter, who could not endure the playing on a <hi>Bagpipe."</hi>

               <l>——— "He was a man</l>
               <l>Of an unbounded Stomach, ever ranking</l>
               <l>Himſelf with Princes; one that by <hi>Suggeſtion</hi>
               </l>
               <l>Ty'd all the kingdom. Simony was fair play.</l>
               <l>His own opinion was his law, i'th' preſence</l>

               <l>But where he meant to ruin, pitiful.</l>
               <l>His promiſes were, as he then was, mighty;</l>
               <l>But his performance, as he now is, nothing.</l>
               <l>Of his own body he was ill, and gave</l>
               <l>The Clergy ill example."</l>
            </q>
            <p>The word <hi>Suggeſtion,</hi> ſays the Critick, is here uſed with great propriety, and <hi>ſeeming</hi> knowledge of the Latin tongue: and he proceeds to ſettle the ſenſe of it from <hi>the late Roman writers and their gloſſers.</hi> But <hi>Shakeſpeare's</hi> knowledge was from <hi>Holingſhed,</hi> whom he follows <hi>verbatim:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"This Cardinal was of a great ſtomach, for he compted himſelf equal with princes, and by craftie <hi>Suggeſtion</hi> got into his hands innumerable treaſure: he forced little on ſimonie, and was not pitifull, and

ſtood affectionate in his own opinion: in open pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence he would lie and ſeie untruth, and was double both in ſpeech and meaning: he would promiſe much and performe little: he was vicious of his bodie, and gaue the clergie euil example." Edit. 1587. p. 922.</p>
            <p>Perhaps after this quotation, you may not think, that Sir <hi>Thomas Hanmer,</hi> who reads <hi>Tyth'd</hi> — in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Ty'd all the kingdom,</hi> deſerves quite ſo much of Dr. <hi>Warburton's</hi> ſeverity. — Indiſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably the paſſage, like every other in the Speech, is intended to expreſs the meaning of the parallel one in the Chronicle: it cannot therefore be credit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that any man, when the <hi>Original</hi> was produced, ſhould ſtill chuſe to defend a <hi>cant</hi> acceptation; and inform us, perhaps, <hi>ſeriouſly,</hi> that in <hi>gaming</hi> language, from I know not what practice, to <hi>tye</hi> is to <hi>equal!</hi> A ſenſe of the word, as far as I have yet found, <hi>unknown</hi> to our old Writers; and, if <hi>known,</hi> would not ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have been uſed in <hi>this</hi> place by our Author.</p>
            <p>But let us turn from conjecture to <hi>Shakeſpeare's</hi> authorities. <hi>Hall,</hi> from whom the above deſcription is copied by <hi>Holingſhed,</hi> is very explicit in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the <hi>Cardinal:</hi> who having inſolently told the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> and <hi>Aldermen,</hi> "For ſothe I thinke, that <hi>halfe</hi> your ſubſtaunce were to litle," aſſures them by way of comfort at the end of his harangue, that

               <hi>upon an average</hi> the <hi>tythe</hi> ſhould be ſufficient; "Sers, ſpeake not to breake that thyng that is concluded, for <hi>ſome</hi> ſhal not paie the <hi>tenth</hi> parte, and <hi>ſome</hi> more." — And again; "Thei ſaied, the Cardinall by Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacions, makyng of Abbottes, probates of teſtamentes, graunting of faculties, licences, and other pollyngs in his Courtes legantines, had made his <hi>threaſore egall with the kynges."</hi> Edit. 1548. p. 138. and 143.</p>

                  <p>His Poems are printed with the title of "Pithy, Pleaſaunt, and Profitable Workes of Maiſter <hi>Skelton, Poete Laureate."</hi> — But, ſays Mr. <hi>Cibber,</hi> after ſeveral other Writers, "how or by what Intereſt he was made <hi>Laureat,</hi> or whether it was a title he aſſumed to himſelf, cannot be determined." — This is an error pretty generally received, and it may be worth our while to remove it.</p>

ſome fragments of <hi>Latin</hi> verſes, in the different <hi>Parts</hi> of this <hi>doubtful</hi> performance.</p>
            <p>It is ſcarcely worth mentioning, that two or three more <hi>Latin</hi> paſſages, which are met with in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, are immediately tranſcribed from the Story or Chronicle before him.

            <p>It hath lately been repeated from Mr. <hi>Guthrie's</hi> "Eſſay upon <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tragedy," that the <hi>Portrait</hi> of <hi>Macbeth's Wife</hi> is copied from <hi>Buchanan,</hi> "whoſe ſpirit, as well as words, is tranſlated into the Play of <hi>Shakeſpeare:</hi> and it had ſignified nothing to have pored only on <hi>Holingſhed</hi> for <hi>Facts."</hi> — "Animus etiam, per ſe ferox, prope quotidianis conviciis uxoris (quae omnium conſiliorum ei erat conſcia) ſtimula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur."— This is the whole, that <hi>Buchanan</hi> ſays of the <hi>Lady,</hi> and truly I ſee no more <hi>ſpirit</hi> in the <hi>Scotch,</hi> than in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Chronicler. "The wordes of the three weird Siſters alſo greatly encouraged him [to the Murder of <hi>Duncan</hi>], but ſpecially his wife lay ſore upon him to attempt the thing, as ſhe that was very ambitious, brenning in unquenchable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to beare the name of a Queene." Edit. 1577. p. 244.</p>
            <p>This part of <hi>Holingſhed</hi> is an Abridgment of <hi>Johne Bellenden's</hi> tranſlation of the <hi>noble clerk, Hector Boece, imprinted</hi> at <hi>Edingburgh,</hi> in <hi>Fol.</hi> 1541. I will give the paſſage as it is found there. "His wyfe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacient of lang tary (<hi>as all wemen ar</hi>) ſpecially quhare they ar deſirus of ony purpos, gaif hym gret artation to purſew the thrid weird, that ſche micht be ane

            <p>But we can <hi>demonſtrate,</hi> that <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> had not the Story from <hi>Buchanan.</hi> According to <hi>him,</hi> the Weïrd-Siſters ſalute <hi>Macbeth,</hi> "Una <hi>Anguſiae</hi> Tha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, altera <hi>Moraviae,</hi> tertia <hi>Regem."</hi>—Thane of <hi>Angus,</hi> and of <hi>Murray, &amp;c.</hi> but according to <hi>Holing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed,</hi> immediately from <hi>Bellenden,</hi> as it ſtands in <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> "The firſt of them ſpake and ſayde, All hayle <hi>Makbeth</hi> Thane of <hi>Glammis,</hi> — the ſecond of them ſaid, Hayle <hi>Makbeth</hi> Thane of <hi>Cawder</hi>; but the third ſayde, All hayle <hi>Makbeth,</hi> that hereafter ſhall be <hi>king of Scotland."</hi> p. 243.

               </q>
Here too our Poet found the equivocal Predictions, on which his Hero ſo fatally depended. "He had learned of certain wyſards, how that he ought to

take heede of <hi>Macduffe</hi>;—and ſurely hereupon had he put <hi>Macduffe</hi> to death, but a certaine witch whom he had in great truſt, had tolde, that he ſhould neuer be ſlain with <hi>man borne of any woman,</hi> nor vanquiſhed till the Wood of <hi>Bernane</hi> came to the Caſtell of <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinane."</hi> p. 244. And the Scene between <hi>Malcolm</hi> and <hi>Macduff</hi> in the fourth act is almoſt literally taken from the <hi>Chronicle.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Macheth</hi> was certainly one of <hi>Shakeſpeare's</hi> lateſt Productions, and it might poſſibly have been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted to him by a little performance on the ſame ſubject at <hi>Oxford,</hi> before King <hi>James,</hi> 1605. I will tranſcribe my notice of it from <hi>Wake's Rex Platonicus:</hi> "Fabulae anſam dedit antiqua de Regiâ proſapiâ hiſtoriola apud <hi>Scoto-Britannos</hi> celebrata, quae narrat tres olim Sibyllas occurriſſe duobus <hi>Scotiae</hi> proceribus, <hi>Macbetho</hi> &amp; <hi>Banchoni,</hi> &amp; illum praedixiſſe Regem fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turum, ſed Regem nullum geniturum; hunc Regem non futurum, ſed Reges geniturum multos.

            <p>A ſtronger argument hath been brought from the Plot of <hi>Hamlet.</hi> Dr. <hi>Grey</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whalley</hi> aſſure us, that for <hi>this, Shakeſpeare muſt</hi> have read <hi>Saxo Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticus</hi> in <hi>Latin,</hi> for no tranſlation hath been made into any modern Language. But the truth is, he did not take it from <hi>Saxo</hi> at all; a Novel called the
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0048001200:63"/>
               <hi>Hyſtorie of Hamblet</hi> was his original: a fragment of which, in <hi>black Letter,</hi> I have been favoured with by a very curious and intelligent Gentleman, to whom the lovers of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> will ſome time or other owe great obligations.</p>
            <p>It hath indeed been ſaid, that "IF <hi>ſuch an hiſtory ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts,</hi> it is almoſt impoſſible that any poet unacquainted with the <hi>Latin</hi> language (ſuppoſing his perceptive faculties to have been ever ſo acute) could have caught the characteriſtical madneſs of <hi>Hamlet,</hi> deſcribed by <hi>Saxo Grammaticus,</hi>
               <note n="a" place="bottom">"Falſitatis enim (<hi>Hamlethus</hi>) alienus haberi cupidus, ita aſtutiam veriloquio permiſcebat, ut nec dictis veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas deeſſet, nec acuminis modus verorum judicio prode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retur." This is quoted, as it had been before, in Mr. <hi>Guthrie's</hi> Eſſay on Tragedy, with a <hi>ſmall</hi> variation from the <hi>Original.</hi> See Edit. <hi>Fol.</hi> 1644. p. 50.</note> ſo happily as it is delineated by <hi>Shakeſpeare."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Very luckily, our Fragment gives us a part of <hi>Hamlet's</hi> Speech to his <hi>Mother,</hi> which ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies to this obſervation. —"It was not without cauſe, and juſte occaſion, that my geſtures, countenances and words ſeeme to proceed from a madman, and that I deſire to haue all men eſteeme mee wholy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priued of ſence and reaſonable underſtanding, bycauſe I am well aſſured, that he that hath made no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to kill his owne brother, (accuſtomed to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and allured with deſire of gouernement with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

controll in his treaſons) will not ſpare to ſaue himſelfe with the like crueltie, in the blood, and fleſh of the loyns of his brother, by him maſſacred: and therefore it is better for me to fayne madneſſe then to uſe my right ſences as nature hath beſtowed them upon me, The bright ſhining clearnes therof I am forced to hide vnder this ſhadow of diſſimulation, as the ſun doth hir beams vnder ſome great cloud, when the wether in ſummer time ouercaſteth: the face of a mad man, ſerueth to couer my gallant countenance, and the geſtures of a fool are fit for me, to the end that guiding my ſelf wiſely therin I may preſerue my life for the <hi>Danes</hi> and the memory of my late deceaſed father, for that the deſire of reuenging his death is ſo ingrauen in my heart, that if I dye not ſhortly, I hope to take ſuch and ſo great vengeance, that theſe Countryes ſhall for euer ſpeake thereof. Neuerthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe I muſt ſtay the time, meanes, and occaſion, leſt by making ouer great haſt, I be now the cauſe of of mine owne ſodaine ruine and ouerthrow, and by that meanes, end, before I beginne to effect my hearts deſire: hee that hath to doe with a wicked, diſloyall, cruell, and diſcourteous man, muſt vſe craft, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litike inuentions, ſuch as a fine witte can beſt imagine, not to diſcouer his interpriſe: for ſeeing that by force I cannot effect my deſire, reaſon alloweth me by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimulation, ſubtiltie, and ſecret practiſes to proceed therein."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0048001200:65"/>But to put the matter out of all queſtion, my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative Friend above-mentioned, Mr. <hi>Capell,</hi> (for why ſhould I not give myſelf the credit of his name?) hath been fortunate enough to procure from the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of the Duke of <hi>Newcaſtle,</hi> a <hi>complete</hi> Copy of the <hi>Hyſtorie of Hamblet,</hi> which proves to be a tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Belleforeſt</hi>; and he tells me, that "all the chief incidents of the Play, and all the capital Characters are there in <hi>embryo,</hi> after a rude and barbarous manner: ſentiments indeed there are none, that <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> could borrow; nor any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion but <hi>one,</hi> which is, where <hi>Hamlet</hi> kills <hi>Polonius</hi> behind the arras: in doing which he is made to cry out, as in the Play, <hi>"a rat, a rat!"</hi>—So much for <hi>Saxo Grammaticus!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſcarcely conceivable, how induſtriouſly the puritanical Zeal of the laſt age exerted itſelf in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying, amongſt better things, the innocent amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the former. Numberleſs <hi>Tales</hi> and <hi>Poems</hi> are alluded to in old Books, which are now perhaps no where to be found. Mr. <hi>Capell</hi> informs me, (and he is in theſe matters, the moſt able of all men to give information) that our Author appears to have been beholden to ſome <hi>Novels,</hi> which he hath yet only ſeen in <hi>French</hi> or <hi>Italian:</hi> but he adds, "to ſay they are not in ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> dreſs, proſaic or metrical, and perhaps with circumſtances nearer to his ſtories,

is what I will not take upon me to do: nor indeed is it what I believe; but rather the contrary, and that time and accident will bring ſome of them to light, if not all."—</p>

               <hi>W.

               <hi>Taming of the Shrew,</hi> that I think it puts the queſtion of <hi>Shakespeare's</hi> having read the Roman Comick Poets in the <hi>original</hi> language out of all doubt,

            <p>With reſpect to <hi>reſemblances,</hi> I ſhall not trouble you any further.—That the <hi>Comedy of Errors</hi> is founded on the <hi>Menaechmi,</hi> it is notorious: nor is it leſs ſo, that a Tranſlation of it by W. W. perhaps <hi>William Warner,</hi> the Author of <hi>Albions England,</hi> was extant in the time of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi>;<note n="c" place="bottom">It was publiſhed in 4to. 1595. The Printer of <hi>Lang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baine,</hi> p. 524. hath accidently given the date, 1515, which hath been copied implicitly by <hi>Gildon, Theobald, Cooke,</hi> and ſeveral others. <hi>Warner</hi> is now almoſt forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, yet the old Criticks eſteemed him one of "our chiefe heroical <hi>Makers."—Meres</hi> informs us, that he had "heard him termed of the beſt wits of both our Univerſities, our <hi>Engliſh Homer."</hi>
               </note> tho' Mr. <hi>Upton,</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0048001200:70"/>
and ſome other advocates for his learning, have cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly dropt the mention of it. Beſides this, (if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it were different) in the <hi>Geſta Grayorum,</hi> the Chriſtmas Revels of the <hi>Gray's-Inn</hi> Gentlemen, 1594, "a <hi>Comedy of Errors</hi> like to <hi>Plautus</hi> his <hi>Menechmus</hi> was played by the Players." And the ſame hath been ſuſpected to be the Subject of the <hi>goodlie Comedie of Plautus</hi> acted at <hi>Greenwich</hi> before the King and Queen in 1520; as we learn from <hi>Hall</hi> and <hi>Holingſhed: — Riccoboni</hi> highly compliments the <hi>Engliſh</hi> on opening their ſtage ſo well; but unfortunately, <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> in his Life of <hi>Wolſey,</hi> calls it, an <hi>excellent Interlude in Latine.</hi> About the ſame time it was exhibited in <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> at <hi>Nuremburgh,</hi> by the celebrated <hi>Hanſſach</hi> the <hi>Shoemaker.</hi>

            <p>Still, <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> quotes a line from the <hi>Eunuch</hi> of <hi>Terence:</hi> by memory too, and what is more, "pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely alters it, in order to bring the ſenſe within the compaſs of one line."—This remark was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to Mr. <hi>Johnſons</hi>; or indiſputably it would not have been made at all. — "Our Author had this line from <hi>Lilly</hi>; which I mention that it may not be brought as an argument of his learning."</p>
            <p>But how, cries an unprovoked Antagoniſt, can you take upon you to ſay, that he had it from <hi>Lilly,</hi>

            <p>We have hitherto ſuppoſed <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> the Author of the <hi>Taming of the Shrew,</hi> but his property in it is extremely diſputable.

Dr. <hi>Warburton</hi> declares it to be <hi>certainly</hi> ſpurious: and without doubt, <hi>ſuppoſing</hi> it to have been written by <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> it muſt have been one of his <hi>earlieſt</hi> productions; yet it is not mentioned in the Liſt of his Works by <hi>Meres</hi> in 1598.</p>

               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0048001200:74"/>And in fact, there is ſuch an old <hi>anonymous</hi> Play in Mr. <hi>Pope's</hi> Liſt. "A pleaſant conceited Hiſtory, called, <hi>The Taming of a Shrew</hi>— ſundry times acted by the Earl of <hi>Pembroke</hi> his Servants." Which ſeems to have been republiſhed by the Remains of that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in 1607, when <hi>Shakeſpeare's</hi> copy appeared at the <hi>Black-Friars</hi> or the <hi>Globe.</hi> — Nor let this ſeem derogatory from the character of our Poet. There is no reaſon to believe, that he wanted to claim the Play as his own; it was not even printed 'till ſome
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0048001200:75"/>
years after his death: but he merely revived it on his Stage as a <hi>Manager. — Ravenſcroft</hi> aſſures us, that this was really the caſe with <hi>Titus Andronicus</hi>; which, it may be obſerved, hath not <hi>Shakeſpeare's</hi> name on the Title-page of the only Edition publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his life-time. Indeed, from every internal mark, I have not the leaſt doubt but this <hi>horrible</hi> Piece was originally written by the Author of the <hi>Lines</hi> thrown into the mouth of the <hi>Player</hi> in <hi>Hamlet,</hi> and of the <hi>Tragedy of Locrine:</hi> which likewiſe from ſome aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance perhaps given to his Friend, hath been unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ignorantly charged upon <hi>Shakeſpeare.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>ſheet-anchor</hi> holds faſt: <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> himſelf hath left ſome Tranſlations from <hi>Ovid.</hi> The Epiſtles, ſays One, of <hi>Paris</hi> and <hi>Helen</hi> give a ſufficient proof of his acquaintance with <hi>that</hi> poet; and it may be concluded, ſays Another, that he was a competent judge of <hi>other</hi> Authors, who wrote in the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
            <p>This hath been the univerſal cry, from Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf to the Criticks of yeſterday. Poſſibly, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Gentlemen will heſitate a moment, if we tell them, that <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> was <hi>not</hi> the Author of theſe Tranſlations. Let them turn to a forgotten book, by <hi>Thomas Heywood,</hi> called <hi>Britaines Troy,</hi> printed by <hi>W.

pertinent to our Hiſtorie, ſays <hi>Heywood, I</hi> thought neceſſarie to tranſlate."—How then came they aſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>Shakeſpeare?</hi> We will tell them that likewiſe. The ſame voluminous Writer publiſhed an <hi>Apology for Actors,</hi> 4to. 1612, and in an Appendix directed to his new Printer <hi>Nic. Okes,</hi> he accuſes his old One, <hi>Jaggard,</hi> of "taking the two Epiſtles of <hi>Paris</hi> to <hi>Helen,</hi> and <hi>Helen</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> and printing them in a leſs vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume under the name of <hi>Another:</hi>— but <hi>he</hi> was much offended with Maſter <hi>Jaggard,</hi> that altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne to him, he had preſumed to make ſo bold with his Name."<note n="g" place="bottom">It may ſeem little matter of wonder, that the name of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> ſhould be borrowed for the benefit of the Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller; and by the way, as probably for a <hi>Play</hi> as a <hi>Poem:</hi> but modern Criticks may be ſurpriſed perhaps at the complaint of <hi>John Hall,</hi> that "certayne Chapters of the <hi>Proverbes,</hi> tranſlated by him into <hi>Engliſh</hi> metre, 1550, had before been untruely <hi>entituled</hi> to be the doyngs of Mayſter <hi>Thomas Sternhold."</hi>

            </p>
            <p>You now hope for land: We have ſeen through little matters, but what muſt be done with a whole book?—In 1751, was reprinted "A compendious or briefe examination of certayne ordinary complaints of diuers of our Countrymen in theſe our days: which although they are in ſome parte unjuſt and friuolous, yet are they all by way of Dialogue

throughly debated and diſcuſſed by <hi>William Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare,</hi> Gentleman." 8vo.</p>
            <p>This extraordinary piece was originally publiſhed in 4to, 1581, and dedicated by the Author, "To the moſt vertuous and learned Lady, his moſt deare and ſoveraigne Princeſſe, <hi>Elizabeth</hi>; being inforced by her Majeſties late and ſingular clemency in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning certayne his unduetifull miſdemeanour." And by the modern Editors, to the late King; as "a Treatiſe compoſed by the moſt extenſive and fertile Genius, that ever any age or nation produced."</p>
            <p>Here we join iſſue with the Writers of that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, tho' very unequal work, the <hi>Biographia Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannica:</hi>

                  <p>I muſt however correct a remark in the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Spenſer,</hi> which is impotently levelled at the firſt Criticks of the age. It is obſerved from the correſpondence of <hi>Spenſer</hi> and <hi>Gabriel Harvey,</hi> that the Plan of the <hi>Fairy Queen</hi> was laid, and part of it executed in 1580, <hi>three</hi> years before the <hi>Gieruſalemme Liberata</hi> was printed: "hence appears the impertinence of all the apologies for his choice of <hi>Arioſto's</hi> manner in preference to <hi>Taſſo's!"</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the fact is not true with reſpect to <hi>Taſſo. Manſo</hi> and <hi>Niceron</hi> inform us, that his Poem was publiſhed, though imperfectly, in 1574; and I myſelf can aſſure the Bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grapher, that I have met with at leaſt <hi>ſix</hi> other Editions, preceding his date for it's firſt publication. I ſuſpect, that <hi>Baillet</hi> is accountable for this miſtake: who in the <hi>Jugemens des Savans,</hi> Tom. 3. p. 399. mentions no Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion previous to the 4to. <hi>Venice,</hi> 1583.</p>
                  <p>It is a queſtion of long ſtanding, whether a part of the <hi>Fairy Queen</hi> hath been <hi>loſt,</hi> or whether the work was left <hi>unfiniſhed:</hi> which may effectually be anſwered by a ſingle quotation. <hi>William Browne</hi> publiſhed ſome Poems in <hi>Fol.</hi> 1616, under the name of <hi>Britannia's Paſtorals,</hi> "eſteemed <hi>then,</hi> ſays <hi>Wood,</hi> to be written in a ſublime ſtrain, and for ſubject <hi>amorous</hi> and <hi>very pleaſing."</hi>—In one of which, <hi>Book</hi> 2. <hi>Song</hi> 1. he thus ſpeaks of <hi>Spenſer:</hi>

            <p>The concurring circumſtances of the <hi>Name,</hi> and the <hi>Miſdemeanor,</hi> which is ſuppoſed to be the old Story of <hi>Deer-ſtealing,</hi> ſeem fairly to challenge our Poet for the Author: but they heſitate. — His claim may appear to be confuted by the date 1581, when <hi>Shake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeare</hi> was only <hi>Seventeen,</hi> and the <hi>long</hi> experience,

            <p>
               <hi>Strype,</hi> in his <hi>Annals,</hi> calls the Author SOME <hi>learned Man,</hi> and this gave me the firſt ſuſpicion.

            <p>I will be ſhort in my animadverſions; and take them in their order.</p>
            <p>The account of the <hi>Trade</hi> of the Family is not only contrary to all other Tradition, but, as it may ſeem, to the inſtrument from the Herald's office, ſo frequently reprinted.— <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> moſt certainly went to <hi>London,</hi> and commenced Actor thro' neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, not natural inclination. —Nor have we any rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſuppoſe, that he did act <hi>exceedingly well. Rowe</hi> tells us from the information of <hi>Betterton,</hi> who was inquiſitive into this point, and had very early op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of Inquiry from Sir <hi>W. Davenant,</hi> that he was no <hi>extraordinary Actor</hi>; and that the top of his performance was the Ghoſt in his own <hi>Hamlet.</hi> Yet this <hi>Chef d' Oeuvre</hi> did not pleaſe: I will give you an original ſtroke at it. Dr. <hi>Lodge,</hi> who was for ever peſtering the town with Pamphlets, publiſhed in the year 1596, <hi>Wits miſerie, and the Worlds mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, diſcovering the Devils incarnat of this Age.</hi> 4to.

<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0048001200:82"/>
of the <hi>Ghoſt,</hi> which cried ſo miſerably at the Theatre, like an Oiſter-wife, <hi>Hamlet revenge."</hi> Thus you ſee Mr. <hi>Holt's</hi> ſuppoſed <hi>proof,</hi> in the Appendix to the late Edition, that <hi>Hamlet</hi> was written after 1597, or perhaps 1602, will by no means hold good; whatever might be the caſe of the particular paſſage on which it is founded.</p>

                  <p>We had lately in a periodical Pamphlet, called, <hi>The Theatrical Review,</hi> a very <hi>curious</hi> Letter under the name of <hi>George Peele,</hi> to one Maſter <hi>Henrie Mark</hi>; relative to a diſpute between <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> and <hi>Alleyn,</hi> which was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>promiſed by <hi>Ben.

            <p>Thus much for the Learning of <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> with reſpect to the ancient languages: indulge me with an obſervation or two on his ſuppoſed knowledge of the modern ones, and I will promiſe to releaſe you.</p>

            <p>Mr. <hi>Whalley</hi> tells us, "the Author of this piece hath the happineſs to be at this time unknown, the remembrance of him having periſhed with himſelf:" <hi>Philips</hi> and others aſcribe it to one <hi>William Smith:</hi> but I take this opportunity of informing him, that it was written by <hi>Thomas Kyd</hi>; if he will accept the authority of his Contemporary, <hi>Heywood.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>More hath been ſaid concerning <hi>Shakeſpeare's</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with the <hi>French</hi> language. In the Play of <hi>Henry the fifth,</hi> we have a whole Scene in it: and in other places it occurs familiarly in the Dialogue.</p>
            <p>We may obſerve in general, that the early Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have not half the quantity; and every ſentence, or rather every word moſt ridiculouſly blundered. Theſe, for ſeveral reaſons, could not poſſibly be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by the Author;<note n="q" place="bottom">
                  <p>Every writer on <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> hath expreſſed his aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, that his author was not ſolicitous to ſecure his Fame by a correct Edition of his performances. This matter is not underſtood. When a Poet was connected with a particular Playhouſe, he conſtantly ſold his Works to the <hi>Company,</hi> and it was their intereſt to keep them from a number of Rivals. A favourite Piece, as <hi>Heywood</hi> informs us, only got into print, when it was copied <hi>by the ear,</hi> "for a double ſale would bring on a ſupicion of honeſtie." <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> therefore himſelf publiſhed nothing in the <hi>Drama:</hi> when he left the Stage, his copies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained with his Fellow-Managers, <hi>Heminge</hi> and <hi>Condell</hi>; who at their own retirement, about ſeven years after the death of the Author, gave the world the Edition now known by the name of the <hi>firſt Folio</hi>; and call the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious publications "ſtolne and ſurreptitious, maimed and deformed by the frauds and ſtealths of injurious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors." But <hi>this</hi> was printed from the Playhouſe Copies; which in a ſeries of years had been frequently altered thro' convenience, caprice, or ignorance. We have a ſufficient inſtance of the liberties taken by the Actors, in an old pamphlet, by <hi>Naſh,</hi> called <hi>Lenten Stuffe, with the Prayſe of the red Herring,</hi> 4to. 1599. where he aſſures us, that in a Play of his, called the <hi>Iſle of Dogs, "foure acts,</hi> without his conſent, or the leaſt gueſſe of his drift or ſcope, were ſupplied by the Players."</p>
                  <p>This however was not his firſt quarrel with them. In the Epiſtle prefixed to <hi>Greene's Arcadia,</hi> which I have quoted before, <hi>Tom.</hi> hath a laſh at ſome "vaine glorious Tragedians," and very plainly at <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar; which will ſerve for an anſwer to an obſervation of Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> that had almoſt been forgotten: "It was thought a praiſe to <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> that he ſcarce ever blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a line: — I believe the common opinion of his want of learning proceeded from no better ground. This too might be thought a <hi>praiſe</hi> by ſome." — But hear <hi>Naſh,</hi> who was far from <hi>praiſing:</hi> "I leaue all theſe to the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their <hi>Mother-tongue,</hi> that feed on nought but the crums that fall from the <hi>Tranſlator's</hi> trencher. — That could ſcarcely <hi>Latinize</hi> their neck verſe if they ſhould haue neede, yet <hi>Engliſh Seneca</hi> read by Candlelight yeelds many good ſentences — hee will affoord you whole <hi>Hamlets,</hi> I ſhould ſay, <hi>Handfuls</hi> of tragicall ſpeeches." —I cannot determine exactly when this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> was firſt publiſhed; but, I fancy, it will carry the original <hi>Ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let</hi> ſomewhat further back than we have hitherto done: and it may be obſerved, that the oldeſt Copy now extant is ſaid to be "Enlarged to almoſt as much againe as it was." <hi>Gabriel Harvey</hi> printed at the end of the year 1592, "Foure Letters and certaine Sonnetts, eſpecially touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Robert Greene:"</hi> in one of which his <hi>Arcadia</hi> is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. Now <hi>Naſh's</hi> Epiſtle muſt have been previous to theſe, as <hi>Gabriel</hi> is quoted in it with applauſe; and the <hi>Foure Letters</hi> were the beginning of a quarrel. <hi>Naſh</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, in "Strange newes of the intercepting certaine Letters, and a Convoy of Verſes, as they were going <hi>privilie</hi> to victuall the <hi>Low Countries,</hi> 1593." <hi>Harvey</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined the ſame year in <hi>"Pierce's</hi> Supererogation, or a new praiſe of the old Aſſe." And <hi>Naſh</hi> again, in "Have with you to <hi>Saffron-walden,</hi> or <hi>Gabriell Harvey's</hi> hunt is up; containing a full anſwer to the eldeſt Sonne of the halter-maker. 1596."</p>
                  <p>Dr. <hi>Lodge</hi> calls <hi>Naſh</hi> our <hi>true Engliſh Aretine:</hi> and <hi>John Taylor,</hi> in his <hi>Kickſey Winſey, or a Lerry Come-twang,</hi> even makes an oath "by ſweet Satyricke <hi>Naſh</hi> his urne." — He died before 1606, as appears from an old Comedy, called, "The return from <hi>Parnaſſus."</hi>
                  </p>
               </note> and it is extremely probable,
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0048001200:91"/>
that the <hi>French</hi> ribaldry was at firſt inſerted by a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent hand, as the many additions moſt certainly were after he had left the Stage. — Indeed, every
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0048001200:92"/>
friend to his memory will not eaſily believe, that he was acquainted with the Scene between <hi>Catharine</hi> and the <hi>old Gentlewoman</hi>; or ſurely he would not have admitted ſuch obſcenity and nonſenſe.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Hawkins,</hi> in the Appendix to Mr. <hi>Johnſon's</hi> Edition, hath an ingenious obſervation to prove, that <hi>Shakeſpeare,</hi> ſuppoſing the <hi>French</hi> to be his, had very little knowledge of the language.</p>
            <p>"Eſt-il impoſſible d'eſchapper la force de ton <hi>Bras?"</hi> ſays a <hi>Frenchman.</hi>— <hi>"Braſs,</hi> cur?" replies <hi>Piſtol.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0048001200:93"/>"Almoſt any one knows, that the French word <hi>Bras</hi> is pronounced <hi>Brau</hi>; and what reſemblance of ſound does this bear to <hi>Braſs?"</hi> —</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> makes a doubt, whether the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation of the French language may not be changed, ſince <hi>Shakeſpeare's</hi> time, "if not, ſays he, it may be ſuſpected that ſome other man wrote the <hi>French</hi> ſcenes:" but this does not appear to be the caſe, at leaſt in this termination, from the rules of the Grammarians, or the practice of the Poets. I am certain of the former from the <hi>French Alphabeth</hi> of <hi>De la Mothe,</hi>

there were more than one before our Poet's. — In <hi>Pierce Penileſſe his Supplication to the Diuell,</hi> 4to. 1592. (which, it ſeems, from the Epiſtle to the Printer, was not the firſt Edition,) the Author, <hi>Naſh,</hi> exclaims, "What a glorious thing it is to have <hi>Henry the fifth</hi> repreſented on the Stage leading the <hi>French King</hi> priſoner, and forcing both him and the <hi>Dolphin</hi> to ſweare fealty!" — And it appears from the Jeſts of the famous Comedian, <hi>Tarlton,</hi> 4to. 1611. that he had been particularly celebrated in the Part of the <hi>Clown</hi> in <hi>Henry the fifth</hi>; but no ſuch Character exiſts in the Play of <hi>Shakeſpeare. — Henry the ſixth</hi> hath ever been doubted; and a paſſage in the above-quoted piece of <hi>Naſh</hi> may give us rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe, it was previous to our Author. "How would it haue joyed braue <hi>Talbot</hi> (the terror of the <hi>French</hi>) to thinke that after he had lyen two hundred yeare in his Toomb, he ſhould triumph again on the Stage; and haue his bones new em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balmed with the teares of ten thouſand ſpectators at leaſt (at ſeuerall times) who in the Tragedian that repreſents his perſon, imagine they behold him freſh bleeding."—I have no doubt but <hi>Henry the ſixth</hi> had the ſame Author with <hi>Edward the third,</hi> which hath been recovered to the world in Mr. <hi>Capell's Proluſions.</hi>

               <note n="x" place="bottom">I have quoted many pieces of <hi>John Taylor,</hi> but it was impoſſible to give their original dates. He may be traced as an Author for more than half a Century. His <hi>Works</hi> were collected in <hi>Folio,</hi> 1630. but many were printed afterward; I will mention one for the Humour of the Title. "Drinke and welcome, or the famous Hiſtory of the moſt part of Drinkes in uſe in <hi>Greate Britain</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>; with an eſpecial Declaration of the Potency, Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and Operation of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Ale: with a deſcription of all ſorts of <hi>Waters,</hi> from the <hi>Ocean Sea</hi> to the <hi>Tears of a Woman.</hi> 4to. 1633." — In <hi>Wits Merriment, or Luſty Drollery,</hi> 1656. we have an "Epitaph on <hi>John Taylor,</hi> who was born in the City of <hi>Gloceſter,</hi> and died in <hi>Phoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nix Alley,</hi> in the 75 yeare of his age; you may find him, if the worms have not devoured him, in <hi>Covent Garden</hi> Church-yard." p. 130.— He died about two years before.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But to come to a concluſion, I will give you an irrefragable argument, that <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> did <hi>not</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand <hi>two</hi> very common words in the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> languages.</p>
            <p>According to the Articles of agreement between the Conqueror <hi>Henry</hi> and the King of <hi>France,</hi> the latter was to ſtile the former, (in the corrected <hi>French</hi> of the modern Editions,) "Noſtre <hi>tres cher</hi> filz <hi>Henry</hi> Roy d' <hi>Angleterre</hi>; and in <hi>Latin, Praeclariſſimus</hi> Filius, &amp;c." What, ſays Dr. <hi>Warburton,</hi> is <hi>tres cher</hi> in <hi>French, praeclariſſimus</hi> in <hi>Latin!</hi> we ſhould read <hi>praecariſſimus.</hi> — This appears to be exceedingly true; but how came the blunder? it is a typographical one
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0048001200:97"/>
in <hi>Holingſhed,</hi> which <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> copied; but muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputably have corrected, had he been acquainted with the languages. — "Our ſaid Father, during his life, ſhall name, call, and write us in <hi>French</hi> in this maner: Noſtre <hi>tres chier</hi> filz, <hi>Henry</hi> Roy d' <hi>Engleterre</hi> — and in <hi>Latine</hi> in this maner, <hi>Praeclariſſimus</hi> filius noſter." Edit 1587. p. 574.</p>
            <p>To corroborate this inſtance, let me obſerve to you, though it be nothing further to the purpoſe, that another error of the ſame kind hath been the ſource of a miſtake in an hiſtorical paſſage of our Author; which hath ridiculouſly troubled the Criticks.</p>

And when I am fairly rid of the Duſt of topogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical Antiquity, which hath continued much longer about me than I expected; you may very probably be troubled again with the ever fruitful Subject of SHAKESPEARE and his COMMENTATORS.</p>
