            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>IT will be ſufficient to ſay of this Edition, that the reader has here a much more correct and compleat copy of the <hi>DUNCIAD,</hi> than has hitherto ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd: I cannot anſwer but ſome miſtakes may have ſlipt into it, but a vaſt number of others will be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, by the Names being now not only ſet at length, but juſtified by the authorities and reaſons given. I make no doubt, the Author's own motive to uſe real rather than feign'd names, was his care to preſerve the Innocent from any falſe Applications; whereas in the former editions which had no more than the Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial letters, he was made, by Keys printed here, to hurt the inoffenſive; and (what was worſe) to abuſe his friends, by an impreſſion at <hi>Dublin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Commentary which attends this Poem was ſent me from ſeveral hands, and conſequently muſt be une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually written; yet will have one advantage over moſt Commentaries, that it is not made upon Conjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or at a remote diſtance of Time: and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cannot but derive one pleaſure from the very <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity</hi> of the perſons it treats of, that it partakes of the nature of a <hi>Secret,</hi> which moſt people love to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0112101600:6"/>
be let into, tho' the Men or the Things be ever ſo inconſiderable or trivial.</p>
            <p>Of the <hi>Perſons</hi> it was judg'd proper to give ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count: for ſince it is only in this Monument that they muſt expect to ſurvive (and here ſurvive they will, as long as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> tongue ſhall remain ſuch as it was in the reigns of Queen <hi>ANNE</hi> and King <hi>GEORGE,)</hi> it ſeem'd but humanity to beſtow a word or two upon each, juſt to tell what he was, what he writ, when he liv'd, and when he dy'd.</p>
            <p>If a word or two more are added upon the chief Offenders; 'tis only as a paper pinn'd upon the breaſt, to mark the Enormities for which they ſuffer'd; leſt the Correction only ſhould be remember'd, and the Crime forgotten.</p>
            <p>In ſome Articles, it was thought ſufficient barely to tranſcribe from <hi>Jacob, Curl,</hi> and other writers of their own rank, who were much better acquainted with them than any of the Authors of this Comment can pretend to be. Moſt of them had drawn each other's Characters on certain occaſions; but the few here inſerted are all that could be ſaved from the general deſtruction of ſuch works.</p>
            <p>Of the part of <hi>Scriblerus</hi> I need ſay nothing: his Manner is well enough known, and approv'd by all but thoſe who are too much concern'd to be Judges.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0112101600:7"/>
The <hi>Imitations</hi> of the <hi>Ancients</hi> are added, to gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify thoſe who either never read, or may have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten them; together with ſome of the <hi>Parodies</hi> and Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions to the moſt excellent of the <hi>Moderns.</hi> If from the frequency of the former any man think the Poem too much a <hi>Cento;</hi> our Poet will but appear to have done the ſame thing in jeſt which <hi>Boileau</hi> did in earneſt; and upon which <hi>Vida, Fracaſtorius,</hi> and many of the moſt eminent <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, profeſſedly va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued themſelves.</p>

            <head>A LETTER TO THE PUBLISHER, Occaſioned by the firſt correct EDITION of the DUNCIAD.</head>
            <p>IT is with pleaſure I hear that you have procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red a correct Copy of the DUNCIAD, which the many ſurreptitious ones have rendered ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and it is yet with more, that I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it will be attended with a COMMENTARY: a Work ſo requiſite, that I cannot think the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf would have omitted it, had he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd of the firſt Appearance of this Poem.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0112101600:9"/>
Such <hi>Notes</hi> as have occurr'd to me I herewith ſend you: You will oblige me by inſerting them amongſt thoſe which are, or will be, tranſmitted to you by others; ſince not only the Author's friends, but even ſtrangers, appear engag'd by hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, to ſome care of an orphan of ſo much ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius and ſpirit, which its parent ſeems to have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandoned from the very beginning, and ſuffered to ſtep into the world naked, unguarded, and unattended.</p>
            <p>It was upon reading ſome of the abuſive papers lately publiſh'd, that my great regard to a perſon, whoſe friendſhip I eſteem as one of the chief ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours of my life, and a much greater reſpect to Truth than to him or any man living, engag'd me in Enquiries of which the inclos'd Notes are the fruit.</p>
            <p>I perceived, that moſt of theſe authors had been (doubtleſs very wiſely) the firſt Aggreſſors. They had try'd till they were weary, what was to be got by railing at each other: no body was either concern'd, or ſurpriz'd, if this or that ſcribler was prov'd a dunce; but every one was curious to read what could be ſaid to prove Mr. POPE one, and was ready to pay ſomething for ſuch a diſcovery: A ſtratagem which would they fairly own, might not only reconcile them to me, but ſcreen
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0112101600:10"/>
them from the reſentment of their lawful Superiors, whom they daily abuſe, only (as I charitably hope) to get that <hi>by</hi> them, which they cannot get <hi>from</hi> them.</p>
            <p>I found this was not all: Ill ſucceſs in that had tranſported them to Perſonal abuſe, either of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or (what I think he could leſs forgive) of his friends. They had call'd men of virtue and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Bad men, long before he had either leiſure or inclination to call them Bad Writers: and ſome had been ſuch old offenders, that he had quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten their perſons as well as their ſlanders, till they were pleas'd to revive them.</p>
            <p>Now what had Mr. POPE done before, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe them? He had publiſh'd thoſe works which are in the hands of every body, in which not the leaſt mention is made of any of them. And what has he done ſince? He has laugh'd and written the DUNCIAD. What has that ſaid of them? A very ſerious truth which the publick had ſaid before, that they were dull: And what it had no ſooner ſaid, but they themſelves were at great pains to procure, or even purchaſe room in the prints, to teſtify under their hands to the truth of it.</p>
            <p>I ſhould ſtill have been ſilent, if either I had ſeen any inclination in my friend to be ſerious
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0112101600:11"/>
with ſuch accuſers, or if they had only meddled with his writings: ſince whoever publiſhes puts himſelf on his trial by his Country. But when his moral character was attack'd, and in a manner from which neither Truth nor Virtue can ſecure the moſt innocent, in a manner which though it annihilates the credit of the accuſation with the juſt and impartial, yet aggravates very much the guilt of the accuſer (I mean, by Authors <hi>without names)</hi> then I thought, ſince the danger was common to all, the concern ought to be ſo; and that it was an act of juſtice to detect the Authors, not only on this account, but as many of them are the ſame who for ſeveral years paſt, have made free with the greateſt of names in Church and State, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to the world the private misfortunes of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, abus'd all even to Women, and whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted papers (for one or other Party in the unhappy diviſions of their Country) have inſulted the Fallen, the Friendleſs, the Exil'd, and the Dead.</p>
            <p>Beſides this, which I take to be a publick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, I have already confeſs'd I had a private one. I am one of that number who have long lov'd and eſteem'd Mr. POPE, and had often declared it was not his capacity or writings (which we ever thought the leaſt valuable part of his character) but the honoſt, open, and beneficent man, that we moſt
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0112101600:12"/>
eſteem'd and lov'd in him. Now if what theſe people ſay were believ'd, I muſt appear to all my friends either a fool or a knave, either impos'd on my ſelf, or impoſing on them: ſo that I am as much intereſted in the confutation of theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies, as he is himſelf.</p>
            <p>I am no Author, and conſequently not to be ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected either of jealouſy or reſentment againſt any of the men, of whom ſcarce one is known to me by ſight; and as for their writings, I have ſought them (on this one occaſion) in vain, in the cloſets and libraries of all my acquaintance. I had ſtill been in the dark, if a Gentleman had not procur'd me (I ſuppoſe from ſome of themſelves, for they are generally much more dangerous friends than enemies) the paſſages I ſend you. I ſolemnly proteſt I have added nothing to the malice or abſurdity of them; which it behoves me to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare, ſince the vouchers themſelves will be ſo ſoon and ſo irrecoverably loſt. You may in ſome meaſure prevent it, by preſerving at leaſt their<note n="*" place="bottom">Which we have done in a Liſt in the <hi>Appendix.</hi>
               </note> Titles, and diſcovering (as far as you can depend on the truth of your information) the names of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal'd authors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:0112101600:13"/>
The firſt objection I have heard made to the Poem is, that the perſons are too <hi>obſcure</hi> for ſatire. The perſons themſelves, rather than allow the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, would forgive the ſatire; and if one could be tempted to afford it a ſerious anſwer, were not all aſſaſſinates, popular inſurrections, the inſolence of the rabble without doors, and of domeſticks with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, moſt wrongfully chaſtiſed, if the Meanneſs of offenders indemnified them from puniſhment? On the contrary, Obſcurity renders them more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, as leſs thought of: Law can pronouce judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment only on open facts, Morality alone can paſs cenſure on intentions of miſchief; ſo that for ſecret calumny, or the arrow flying in the dark, there is no publick puniſhment left, but what a good Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inflicts.</p>
            <p>The next objection is, that theſe ſort of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors are <hi>Poor.</hi> That might be pleaded as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe at the Old Baily, for leſſer crimes than De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famation, (for 'tis the caſe of almoſt all who are try'd there) but ſure it can be none, for who will pretend that the robbing another of his reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſupplies the want of it in himſelf? I queſtion not but ſuch authors are poor, and heartily wiſh the objection were removed by any honeſt liveli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. But Poverty is here the accident, not the ſubject: he who deſcribes malice and villany to be
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0112101600:14"/>
pale and meagre, expreſſes not the leaſt anger againſt Paleneſs or leanneſs, but againſt malice and villany. The Apothecary in <hi>Romeo</hi> and <hi>Juliet</hi> is poor, but is he therefore juſtified in vending poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? Not but Poverty itſelf becomes a juſt ſubject of ſatire, when it is the conſequence of vice, prodigality, or neglect of one's lawful calling; for then it increaſes the publick burden, fills the ſtreets and highways with Robbers, and the garrets with Clippers, Coiners, and Weekly Journaliſts.</p>
            <p>But admitting that two or three of theſe offend leſs in their morals, than in their writings: muſt Poverty make Nonſenſe ſacred? If ſo, the fame of bad authors would be much better than that of all the good ones in the world; and not one of a hundred had ever been call'd by his right name.</p>
            <p>They miſtake the whole matter: It is not cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to encourage them in the way they follow, but to get 'em out of it: For Men are not bunglers becauſe they are poor, but they are poor becauſe they are bunglers.</p>
            <p>Is it not pleaſant enough, to hear our authors crying out on the one hand, as if their perſons and Characters were too ſacred for Satire; and the publick objecting on the other, that they are too mean even for Ridicule? But whether bread or fame be their end, it muſt be allow'd, our author by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0112101600:15"/>
and in this Poem, has mercifully given 'em a little of both.</p>
            <p>There are two or three, who by their <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>fortune</hi> have no benefit from the former objections (ſuppoſing them good) and theſe I was ſorry to ſee in ſuch company. But if without any provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, two or three gentlemen will fall upon one, in an affair wherein his intereſt and reputation are equally imbark'd, they cannot certainly, after they have been content to print themſelves his <hi>enemies,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of being put into the Number of them?</p>
            <p>Others, I'm told, pretend to have been once his <hi>Friends.</hi> Surely they are their enemies who ſay ſo, ſince nothing can be more odious than to treat a friend as they have done. But of this I can't perſuade my ſelf, when I conſider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and eternal averſion of all bad writers to a good one.</p>
            <p>Such as claim a merit from being his <hi>Admirers,</hi> I would gladly ask, if it lays him under a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal obligation? at that rate he would be the moſt oblig'd humble ſervant in the world. I dare ſwear for theſe in particular, he never deſir'd them to be his Admirers, nor promis'd in return to be theirs: that had truly been a ſign he was of their acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; but would not the malicious world have ſuſpected ſuch an approbation of ſome motive worſe
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0112101600:16"/>
than ignorance, in the Author of the <hi>Eſſay</hi> on <hi>Criticiſm?</hi> Be it as it will, the reaſons of their Admiration and of his Contempt are equally ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting, for his works and theirs are the very ſame that they were.</p>
            <p>One therefore of their affertions I believe may be true, "That he has a contempt for their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings." And there is another which would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be ſooner allow'd by himſelf than by any good judge beſide, "That his own have found too much ſucceſs with the publick." But as it cannot conſiſt with his modeſty to claim this as a juſtice, it lies not on him, but entirely on the publick, to defend its own judgment.</p>
            <p>There remains what in my opinion might ſeem a better plea for theſe people, than any they have made uſe of. If Obſcurity or Poverty were to exempt a man from ſatire, much more ſhould Folly or Dulneſs, which are ſtill more involuntary, nay as much ſo as perſonal Deformity. But even this will not help them: Deformity becomes an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Ridicule when a man ſets up for being handſome; and ſo muſt Dulneſs when he ſets up for a Wit. They are not ridicul'd becauſe Ridicule in itſelf is, or ought to be, a pleaſure; but becauſe it is juſt, to undeceive and vindicate the honeſt and unpretending part of mankind from Impoſition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe particular intereſt ought to yield to general,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0112101600:17"/>
and a great number who are not naturally Fools ought never to be made ſo in complaiſance to a few who are. Accordingly we find that in all ages, all vain pretenders, were they ever ſo poor or ever ſo dull, have been conſtantly the topicks of the moſt candid Satiriſts, from the <hi>Codrus</hi> of JUVENAL to the <hi>Damon</hi> of BOILEAU.</p>
            <p>Having mention'd BOILEAU, the greateſt Poet and moſt judicious Critic of his age and country, admirable for his Talents, and yet perhaps more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable for his Judgment in the proper application of them; I cannot help remarking the reſemblance betwixt him and our Author in Qualities, Fame, and Fortune; in the diſtinctions ſhewn to them by their Superiors, in the general eſteem of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals, and in their extended reputation amongſt Foreigners; in the latter of which ours has met with the better fate, as he has had for his Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors perſons of the moſt eminent rank and abilities in their reſpective nations<note n="*" place="bottom">

<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0112101600:18"/>
holds in nothing more, than in their being equally abus'd by the ignorant Pretenders to Poetry of their times; of which not the leaſt memory will remain but in their own writings, and in the notes made upon them. What BOILEAU has done in almoſt all his poems, our Author has only in this: I dare anſwer for him he will do it in no more; and on his principle of attacking few but who had ſlander'd him, he could not have done it at all, had he been confin'd from cenſuring obſcure and worthleſs perſons, for ſcarce any other were his enemies. However, as the parity is ſo remarkable, I hope it will continue to the laſt; and if ever he ſhall give us an edition of this Poem himſelf, I may ſee ſome of 'em treated as gently (on their repentance or better merit) as <hi>Perault</hi> and <hi>Quinault</hi> were at laſt by BOILEAU.</p>
            <p>In one point I muſt be allow'd to think the character of our Engliſh Poet the more amiable.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0112101600:19"/>
He has not been a follower of Fortune or Succeſs; he has liv'd with the Great without flattery, been a friend to Men in power without penſions, from whom as he ask'd, ſo he receiv'd no favour, but what was done Him in his friends. As his Satires were the more juſt for being delay'd, ſo were his Pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyricks; beſtow'd only on ſuch perſons as he had familiarly known, only for ſuch virtues as he had long obſerv'd in them, and only at ſuch times as others ceaſe to praiſe, if not begin to calumniate them, I mean when out of power, or out of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion <note n="†" place="bottom">As Mr. <hi>Wycherley,</hi> at the time the Town de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim'd againſt his book of Poems: Mr <hi>Walſh,</hi> after his death: Sir <hi>William Trumbull,</hi> when he had reſign'd the office of Secretary of State: Lord <hi>Bolingbroke</hi> at his leaving <hi>England</hi> after the Queen's death: Lord <hi>Oxford</hi> in his laſt decline of Life: Mr. Secretary <hi>Crags</hi> at the end of the South-Sea Year, and after his death: Others only in <hi>Epitaphs.</hi>
               </note>. A Satire therefore on writers ſo notori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for the contrary practiſe, became no man ſo well as himſelf, as none (it is plain) was ſo little in their friendſhips, or ſo much in that of thoſe whom they had moſt abus'd, namely the Greateſt and Beſt of all Parties. Let me add a further rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that tho' ingag'd in their Friendſhips, he never eſpous'd their Animoſities; and can almoſt ſingly
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0112101600:20"/>
challenge this honour, not to have written a line of any man, which thro' Guilt, thro' Shame, or thro' Fear, thro' variety of Fortune, or change of Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts, he was ever unwilling to own.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude with remarking what a pleaſure it muſt be to every reader of Humanity, to ſee all along that our Author, in his very laughter, is not indulging his own ill-nature, but only puniſhing that of others.

            <head>MARTINUS SCRIBLERUS OF THE POEM.</head>
            <p>THIS Poem, as it celebrated the moſt grave and antient of things, Chaos, Night and Dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo is it of the moſt grave and antient kind. <hi>Homer</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ariſtotle)</hi> was the firſt who gave the <hi>Form,</hi> and (ſaith <hi>Horace)</hi> who adapted the <hi>Meaſure,</hi> to heroic poeſy. But even before this, may be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally preſumed from what the antients have left written, was a piece by <hi>Homer</hi> compoſed, of like nature and matter with this of our Poet. For of Epic ſort it appeareth to have been, yet of matter ſurely not unpleaſant, witneſs what is reported of it by the Learned Archbiſhop <hi>Euſtatbius,</hi> in Odyſſ. k. And accordingly <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> in his poetic, chap. 4. doth further ſet forth, that as the Iliad and Odyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0112101600:24"/>
gave example to Tragedy, ſo did this poem to Comedy its firſt Idaea.</p>
            <p>From theſe authors alſo it ſhou'd ſeem, that the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro or chief perſonage of it was no leſs <hi>obſcure,</hi> and his <hi>underſtanding</hi> and <hi>ſentiments</hi> no leſs quaint and ſtrange (if indeed not more ſo) than any of the actors in our poem. MARGITES was the name of this perſonage, whom Antiquity recordeth to have been <hi>Dunce the firſt;</hi> and ſurely from what we hear of him, not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be the root of ſo ſpreading a tree, and ſo numerous a poſterity. The poem therefore celebrating him, was properly and abſolutely a <hi>Dunciad;</hi> which tho' now unhappily loſt, yet is its nature ſufficiently known by the infallible tokens aforeſaid. And thus it doth appear, that the firſt Dunciad was the firſt Epic poem, written by <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf, and anterior even to the Iliad or Odyſſey.</p>
            <p>Now foraſmuch as our Poet had tranſlated thoſe two famous works of <hi>Homer</hi> which are yet left, he did conceive it in ſome ſort his duty to imitate that alſo which was loſt: And was therefore induced to be ſtow on it the ſame Form which <hi>Homer</hi>'s is reported to have had, namely that of Epic poem, with a title alſo framed after the antient <hi>Greek</hi> manner, to wit, that of <hi>Dunciad.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wonderful it is, that ſo few of the moderns have been ſtimulated to attempt ſome Dunciad! Since in
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0112101600:25"/>
the opinion of the multitude, it might coſt leſs pain and oil than an imitation of the greater Epic. But poſſible it is alſo that, on due reflection, the maker might find it eaſier to paint a <hi>Charlemagne,</hi> a <hi>Brute</hi> or a <hi>Godfry,</hi> with juſt pomp and dignity heroic, than a <hi>Margites,</hi> a <hi>Codrus,</hi> a <hi>Fleckno,</hi> or a <hi>Tibbald.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We ſhall next declare the occaſion and the cauſe which moved our Poet to this particular work. He lived in thoſe days, when (after Providence had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Invention of Printing as a ſcourge for the ſins of the learned) Paper alſo became ſo cheap, and printers ſo numerous, that a deluge of Authors cover'd the land: Whereby not only the peace of the honeſt unwriting ſubject was daily moleſted, but unmerciful demands were made of his applauſe, yea of his money, by ſuch as would neither earn the one, or deſerve the other: At the ſame time, the Liberty of the Preſs was ſo unlimited, that it grew dangerous to refuſe them either; For they would forthwith publiſh ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders unpuniſh'd, the authors being anonymous; nay the immediate publiſhers thereof lay ſculking under the wings of an Act of Parliament, aſſuredly intended for better purpoſes.</p>

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0112101600:26"/>
to diſſuade the dull, and puniſh the malicious, <hi>the only way that was left.</hi> In that public-ſpirited view he laid the plan of this Poem, as the greateſt ſervice he was capable (without much hurt or being ſlain) to render his dear country. Firſt, taking things from their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, he conſidereth the Cauſes creative of ſuch Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, namely <hi>Dulneſs</hi> and <hi>Poverty;</hi> the one born with them, the other contracted, by neglect of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per talent thro' ſelf-conceit of great abilities This truth he wrappeth in an <hi>Allegory,</hi>

low Criticiſms: He finds his Name to be <hi>Tibbald,</hi> and he becomes of courſe the Hero of the poem.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Fable</hi> being thus according to beſt example one and entire, as contain'd in the propoſition; the <hi>Machi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nery</hi> is a continued chain of Allegories, ſetting forth the whole power, miniſtry, and empire of Dulneſs, extended thro' her ſubordinate inſtruments, in all her various operations.</p>
            <p>This is branched into <hi>Epiſodes,</hi> each of which hath its Moral a part, tho' all conducive to the main end. The crowd aſſembled in the ſecond book demonſtrates the deſign to be more extenſive than to bad Poets only, and that we may expect other Epiſodes, of the Patrons, Encouragers, or Paymaſters of ſuch authors, as occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall bring them forth: And the third book, if well conſider'd, ſeemeth to embrace the whole world. Each of the Games relateth to ſome or other vile claſs of writers: The firſt concerneth the Plagiary, to whom he giveth the name of <hi>More;</hi> the ſecond the libellous Novelliſt, whom he ſtyleth <hi>Eliza;</hi> the third the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering Dedicator, the fourth the bawling Critic or noiſy Poet, the fifth the dark and dirty Party-writer, and ſo of the reſt; aſſigning to each ſome <hi>proper name</hi> or other, ſuch as he could find.</p>
            <p>As for the <hi>Characters,</hi> the publick hath already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd how juſtly they are drawn: The manners are ſo depicted, and the ſentiments ſo peculiar to thoſe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0112101600:29"/>
to whom applied, that ſurely to transfer them to any other, or wiſer, perſonages, would be exceeding dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult: And certain it is, that every perſon concerned being conſulted apart, hath readily owned the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance of every portrait, his own excepted.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Deſcriptions</hi> are ſingular; the <hi>Compariſons</hi> very quaint, the <hi>Narration</hi> various, yet of one colour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The purity and chaſtity of <hi>Diction</hi> is ſo preſerved, that in the places moſt ſuſpicious, not the <hi>words</hi> but only the <hi>images</hi> have been cenſured, and yet are thoſe images no other than have been ſanctified by Antient and Claſſical Authority, tho' (as was the manner of thoſe good times,) not ſo curiouſly wrapped up: yea and commented upon by moſt grave Doctors, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Critics.</p>
            <p>As it beareth the name of <hi>Epic,</hi> it is thereby ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to ſuch ſevere indiſpenſable rules as are laid on all Neoterics, a ſtrict imitation of the Antient; inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that any deviation, accompanied with whatever poetic beauties, hath always been cenſured by the ſound Critic. How exact that Imitation hath been in this piece, appeareth not only by its general ſtructure, but by particular alluſions infinite, many whereof have eſcaped both the commentator and poet himſelf; yea divers by his exceeding diligence are ſo alter'd and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with the reſt, that ſeveral have already been
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0112101600:30"/>

            <p>NOW before we preſent thee with our Exercita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on this moſt delectable Poem (drawn from the many volumes of our <hi>Adverſaria</hi> on modern Authors) we ſhall here, according to the laudable uſage of Editors, collect the various judgments of the Learned concerning our Poet: Various indeed, not only of different authors, but of the ſame au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor at different ſeaſons. Nor ſhall we gather only the Teſtimonies of ſuch eminent Wits as would of courſe deſcend to poſterity, and conſequently be read without our collection; but we ſhall likewiſe with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible labour ſeek out for divers others, which but for this our diligence, could never at the diſtance of

a few months appear to the eye of the moſt curious. Hereby thou may'ſt not only receive the delectation of Variety, but alſo arrive at a more certain judgment, by a grave and circumſpect compariſon of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes with each other, or of each with himſelf. Hence alſo thou wilt be enabled to draw reflections, not only of a critical, but a moral nature, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing let into many particulars of the Perſon as well as Genius, and of the Fortune as well as Merit, of our Author: In which, if I relate ſome things of little concern peradventure to thee, and ſome of as little even to him; I entreat thee to conſider how minutely all true Critics and commentators are wont to inſiſt upon ſuch, and how material they ſeem to themſelves if to none other. Forgive me therefore gentle reader, if (following learned example) I ever and anon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come tedious; allow me to take the ſame pain to find whether my author were good or bad, well or ill-natured, modeſt or arrogant; as another, whether his author were fair or brown, ſhort or tall, or whether he wore a coat or a caſſock?</p>

It is impoſſible for us who live in the latter ages of the world, to make obſervations in criticiſm, morality, or any art or ſcience, which have not been touch'd upon by others; we have little elſe left us, but to repreſent the common ſenſe of mankind in more ſtrong, more beautiful, or more uncommon lights.

               <head>REMARKS on BOOK the FIRST.</head>
               <p>This Poem was writ in 1726. In the next year an imperfect Edition was publiſhed at Dublin, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>printed at London in 120. another at Dublin, and another at London in 8vo, and three others in 120. the ſame year. But there was no perfect Edition before that of London in 4to 1728-9, which was attended with the following Notes. We are will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to acquaint Poſterity that this Poem (as it here ſtands) was preſented to King <hi>George</hi> the <hi>Second</hi> and his Queen, by the hands of Sir <hi>Robert Walpole,</hi> on the 12th of March, 1728-9.</p>

Nor is the neglect of a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle Letter</hi> ſo trivial as to ſome it may appear; the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration whereof in a learned language is an <hi>Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that brings honour</hi> to the Critic who advances it; and Dr. B. will be remembered to poſterity for his performances of <hi>this ſort,</hi> as long as the world ſhall have any eſteem for the Remains of <hi>Menander</hi> and <hi>Philemon.</hi>

               <p>I have a juſt value for the letter E, and the ſame affection for the name of this poem, as the forecited Critic for that of his author; yet cannot it induce me to agree with thoſe who would add yet another <hi>e</hi> to it, and call it the <hi>Dunceiade;</hi> which being a French
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0112101600:65"/>
and foreign termination, is no way proper to a word entirely Engliſh, and vernacular. One <hi>e</hi> therefore in this caſe is right, and two <hi>e</hi>'s wrong. Yet upon the whole I ſhall follow the Manuſcript, and print it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any <hi>e</hi> at all; mov'd thereto by Authority, at all times, with Critics, equal if not ſuperior to Reaſon. In which method of proceeding, I can never enough praiſe my very good friend, the exact Mr. <hi>Tho. Hearne;</hi> who, if any word occur which to him and all mankind is evidently wrong, yet keeps he it in the Text with due reverence, and only remarks in the Margin, <hi>ſic M. S.</hi> In like manner we ſhall not amend this error in the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle itſelf, but only note it <hi>obiter,</hi> to evince to the learned that it was not our fault, nor any effect of our igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance or inattention. <bibl>SCRIBLERUS.</bibl>

Wonderful is the ſtupidity of all the former Critics and Commentators on this work! it breaks forth at the very firſt line.

                  <hi>Lewis Tibbald</hi> (as pronounced) or <hi>Theobald</hi> (as written) was bred an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney, and ſon to an Attorney (ſays Mr. <hi>Jacob)</hi> of <hi>Sittenburn</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi> He was Author of many forgotten Plays, Poems, and other pieces, and of ſeveral ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous Letters in praiſe of them in <hi>Miſt</hi>'s Journal.

"That to expoſe any errors in it was impracticable."

But this Reſtorer, who was at that time ſolliciting favours of him by letters, did wholly conceal that he had any ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, till after its publication: (which he was ſince not aſham'd to own, in a <hi>Daily Journal</hi> of <hi>Nov.</hi> 26. 1728.) And then an outcry was made in the Prints,
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0112101600:88"/>
that our Author had joined with the Bookſeller to raiſe an <hi>extravagant ſubſcription;</hi> in which he had no ſhare, of which he had no knowledge, and againſt which he had publickly advertiſed in his own Propoſals for <hi>Homer.</hi> Probably that proceeding elevated <hi>Tibbald</hi> to the dignity he holds in this Poem, which he ſeems to deſerve no other way better than his brethren; unleſs we impute it to the ſhare he had in the Journals, cited among the <hi>Teſtimonies of Authors</hi> prefix'd to this work.</p>

                  </q> This alludes to the extravagancy of the Farces of that author; in which he alone could properly be repreſented as ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor to <hi>Settle,</hi> who had written <hi>Pope Joan, St. George for England,</hi> and other pieces for <hi>Bartlemew-Fair.</hi> See book 3. p. 279.</p>

                  </q>It is amazing how the ſenſe of this has been miſtaken by all the former Commentators, who moſt idly ſuppoſe it to imply that the Hero of the Poem wanted a ſupper. In truth a great abſurdity! Not that we are ignorant that the Hero of <hi>Homer</hi>'s <hi>Odyſſey</hi> is frequently in that circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and therefore it can no way derogate from the grandeur of Epic Poem to repreſent ſuch Hero under a calamity, to which the greateſt not only of Critics and Poets, but of Kings and Warriors, have been ſubject. But much more refin'd, I will venture to ſay, is the meaning of our author: It was to give us obliquely a curious precept, or what <hi>Boſſu</hi> calls a <hi>diſguiſed ſentence,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0112101600:89"/>
that "Temperance is the life of Study." The lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of Poeſy brings all into action; and to repreſent a Critic encompaſs'd with books, but without a ſupper, is a picture which lively expreſſeth how much the true Critic prefers the diet of the mind to that of the body, one of which he always caſtigates and often totally neglects, for the greater improvement of the other. <bibl>SCRIBLERUS.</bibl>

               <head>REMARKS on BOOK the SECOND.</head>
               <p>Two things there are, upon the ſuppoſition of which the very baſis of all Verbal criticiſm is founded
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0112101600:112"/>
and ſupported: The firſt, that an author could never fail to uſe the <hi>beſt word,</hi> on every occaſion: The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that a Critic cannot chuſe but know, <hi>which that is?</hi> This being granted, whenever any word doth not fully content us, we take upon us to conclude, firſt that the author could <hi>never have us'd it,</hi> and ſecondly, that he muſt have uſed <hi>that very one</hi> which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture in its ſtead.</p>
               <p>We cannot therefore enough admire the learned <hi>Scriblerus,</hi> for his alteration of the text in the two laſt verſes of the preceding book, which in all the former editions ſtood thus,
<q rend="inline">
                     <l>Hoarſe thunder to the bottom ſhook the bog,</l>
                     <l>And the loud nation croak'd, <hi>God ſave King</hi> Log!</l>
                  </q>
He has with great judgment tranpoſed theſe two epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets, putting <hi>hoarſe</hi> to the nation, and <hi>loud</hi> to the thunder: and this being evidently the true reading, he vouchſafed not ſo much as to mention the former; for which aſſertion of the juſt right of a Critic, he merits the acknowledgment of all ſound commentators.</p>

that he carried the Trade many lengths beyond what it ever before had arrived at, and that he was the envy and admiration of all his profeſſion.

                     <hi>The Publiſher.]</hi> Who he was is uncertain; but <hi>Edward Ward</hi> tells us in his preface to <hi>Durgen,</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">"that moſt judges are of opinion this preface is not of <hi>Engliſh</hi> extraction but <hi>Hibernian,</hi> &amp;c."</q> He means Dr. <hi>Swift,</hi> who whether publiſher or not, may be ſaid in a ſort to be author of the poem: For when he, together with Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> (for reaſons ſpecify'd in the preface to their Miſcellanies) determin'd to own the moſt trifling pieces in which they had any hand, and to deſtroy all that remain'd in their power, the firſt sketch of this poem was ſnatch'd from the fire by Dr. <hi>Swift,</hi> who perſuaded his friend to proceed in it, and to him it was therefore inſcribed. But the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of printing it was as follows.</p>
                  <p>There was publiſh'd in thoſe Miſcellanies, a Treatiſe of the <hi>Bathos,</hi> or <hi>Art of Sinking in Poetry,</hi> in which was a chapter, where the ſpecies of bad writers were rang'd in claſſes, and initial letters of names prefix'd for the moſt part at random. But ſuch was the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of poets eminent in that art, that ſome one or other took every letter to himſelf. All fell into ſo violent a fury, that for half a year or more the common News<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>papers (in moſt of which they had ſome property, as being hired writers) were filled with the moſt abuſive falſhoods and ſcurrilities they could poſſibly deviſe: A liberty no ways to be wonder'd at in thoſe people, and in thoſe papers, that, for many years, during the uncontrolled licenſe of the preſs, had aſperſed almoſt all the great characters of the age, and this with impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, their own perſons and names being utterly ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret and obscure. This gave Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> the thought, that he had now ſome opportunity of doing good, by <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> and dragging into light theſe common ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of mankind; ſince to invalidate this univerſal ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, it ſufficed to ſhew what contemptible men were the authors of it. He was not without hopes, that by manifeſting the dullneſs of thoſe who had only malice to recommend them, either the bookſellers would not find their account in employing them, or the men themſelves, when diſcovered, want courage to proceed in ſo unlawful an occupation. This it was that gave birth to the <hi>Dunciad,</hi> and he thought an happineſs, that by the late flood of ſlander on himſelf, he had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired ſuch a peculiar right over their names as was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to his deſign.</p>

            <p>IT will be found a true obſervation, tho' ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſurprizing, that when any ſcandal is vented againſt a man of the higheſt diſtinction and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, either in the State or in Literature, the publick

In general afford it a moſt quiet reception; and the arger part accept it as favourably as if it were ſome

kindneſs done to themſelves: whereas if a known ſcoundrel or blockhead but chance to be touch'd upon, a whole legion is up in arms, and it becomes the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe of all Scriblers, Bookſellers, and Printers whatſoever.</p>
            <p>Not to ſearch too deeply into the reaſon hereof, I will only obſerve as a fact, that every week for theſe two months paſt, the town has been perſecuted with <note n="b" place="bottom">

(not to mention <hi>Jerſey, Guernſey,</hi> the <hi>Orcades,</hi> thoſe in the New world, and Foreigners who have tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him into their languages) of all this number, not a man hath ſtood up to ſay one word in his defence.</p>
            <p>The only exception is the <note n="d" place="bottom">
                  <hi>The Author of the following Poem,</hi> &amp;c.] A very plain irony, ſpeaking of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> himſelf.</note>. author of the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing poem, who doubtleſs had either better inſight into the grounds of this clamour, or better opinion of Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s integrity, join'd with a greater perſonal love for him, than any other of his numerous friends and admirers.</p>
            <p>Further, that he was in his peculiar intimacy, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from the knowledge he manifeſts of the moſt private authors of all the anonymous pieces againſt him, and from his having in this poem attacked <note n="e" place="bottom">The publiſher in theſe words went a little too far: but it is certain whatever names the reader finds that are unknown to him, are of ſuch: and the exception is only of two or three, whoſe dulneſs or ſcurrility all mankind agreed to have juſtly entitled them to a place in the <hi>Dunciad.</hi>

            <p>How I came poſſeſt of it, is of no concern to the reader; but it would have been a wrong to him had I detain'd this publication: ſince thoſe names which are its chief ornaments die off daily ſo faſt, as muſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it too ſoon unintelligible If it provoke the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to give us a more perfect edition, I have my end.</p>

Who he is I cannot ſay, and (which is great pity) there is certainly <note n="f" place="bottom">
                  <hi>There is certainly nothing in his Style,</hi> &amp;c.] This irony had ſmall effect in concealing the author. The <hi>Dunciad,</hi> imperfect as it was, had not been publiſh'd two days, but the whole town gave it to Mr. <hi>Pope.</hi>
               </note>. nothing in his ſtyle and manner of writing which can diſtinguiſh or diſcover him: For if it bears any reſemblance to that of Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> 'tis not improbable but it might be done on purpoſe, with a view to have it paſs for his. But by the frequency of his alluſions to <hi>Virgil,</hi> and a labour'd (not to ſay af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected) <hi>ſhortneſs</hi> in imitation of him, I ſhould think him more an admirer of the <hi>Roman</hi> poet than of the <hi>Grecian,</hi> and in that not of the ſame taſte with his friend.</p>
            <p>I have been well inform'd, that this work was the labour of full <note n="g" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <hi>The labour of full ſix years,</hi> &amp;c.] This alſo was honeſtly and ſeriouſly believ'd, by divers of the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of the <hi>Dunciad. J. Ralph,</hi> pref. to <hi>Sawney,</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">"We are told, it was the labour of ſix years, with the utmoſt aſſiduity and application: It is no great compliment to the author's ſenſe to have employ'd ſo large a part of his life, &amp;c."</q> So alſo <hi>Ward,</hi> pref. to <hi>Durgen,</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">"The <hi>Dunciad,</hi> as the publiſher very wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſes, coſt the author ſix years retirement from all the pleaſures of life, tho' it is ſomewhat difficult to conceive, from either its bulk or beauty, that it could be ſo long in hatching, &amp;c.

retired himſelf from all the avocations and pleaſures of the world, to attend diligently to its correction and perfection; and ſix years more he intended to beſtow upon it, as it ſhould ſeem by this verſe of <hi>Statius</hi> which was cited at the head of his manuſcript,

            <p>Hence alſo we learn the true title of the Poem; which with the ſame certainty as we call that of <hi>Homer</hi> the <hi>Iliad,</hi> of <hi>Virgil</hi> the <hi>Aeneid,</hi> of <hi>Camoens</hi> the <hi>Luſiad,</hi> of <hi>Voltaire</hi> the <note n="i" place="bottom">
                  <hi>The Henriad.]</hi> The <hi>French</hi> poem of <hi>Monſieur Vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taire,</hi> entitled <hi>La Henriade,</hi> had been publiſh'd at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> the year before.</note>. <hi>Henriad,</hi> we may pronounce could have been, and can be no other, than</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The DUNCIAD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is ſtyled <hi>Heroic,</hi> as being <hi>doubly</hi> ſo; not only with reſpect to its nature, which according to the beſt rules of the ancients, and ſtricteſt ideas of the moderns, is critically ſuch; but alſo with regard to the heroical diſpoſition and high courage of the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who dar'd to ſtir up ſuch a formidable, irritable, and implacable race of mortals.</p>
            <p>The time and date of the Action is evidently in the laſt reign, when the office of City poet expir'd
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:0112101600:234"/>
upon the death of <hi>Elkanah Settle,</hi> and it is fix'd to the Mayoralty of Sir <hi>Geo. Thorold.</hi> But there may ariſe ſome obſcurity in Chronology from the <hi>names</hi> in the poem, by the inevitable removal of ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and inſertion of others, in their niches. For whoever will conſider the unity of the whole deſign, will be ſenſible, that the <hi>Poem was not made for theſe Authors, but theſe Authors for the Poem:</hi> I ſhould judge that they were clapp'd in as they roſe, freſh and freſh, and chang'd from day to day; in like manner as when the old boughs wither, we thruſt new ones into a chimney.</p>
            <p>I would not have the reader too much troubled or anxious, if he cannot decypher them; ſince when he ſhall have found them out, he will probably know no more of the perſons than before.</p>
            <p>Yet we judg'd it better to preſerve them as they are, than to change them for fictitious 'names, by which the ſatire would only be multiplied and applied to many inſtead of one. Had the Hero, for inſtance, been called <hi>Codrus,</hi> how many would have affirm'd him to have been Mr. <hi>W.</hi> Mr. <hi>D.</hi> Sir <hi>R. B,</hi> &amp;c. but now all that unjuſt ſcandal is ſaved by calling him <hi>Theobald,</hi> which by good luck happens to be the name of a real perſon.</p>
            <p>I am indeed aware, that this name may to ſome appear too mean for the Hero of an Epic Poem: But it is hoped, they will alter that opinion, when they find, that an author no leſs eminent than <hi>la Bruyere</hi> has honour'd him with frequent mention, and thought him worthy a place in his characters.</p>
