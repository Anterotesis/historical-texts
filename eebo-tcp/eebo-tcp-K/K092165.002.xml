            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

This morning the Duke ſent for me,
and addreſſed me in the following
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0238500402:9"/>
words: "You have been in danger
of degrading yourſelf by a marriage

            <p>"As a puniſhment, <hi>you</hi> were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned

ſpeak, when I ſunk motionleſs at
his feet. This accident he attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
to exceſs of joy; and in that miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
did he continue till about an

her days in the convent of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tina.
Her conduct has been highly

when her hand only was at her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal.
I endeavour to comfort her
as much as poſſible, and to ſupport
her in all her diſtreſſes. That ſhe
may receive from Heaven that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
which ſhe ſo much needs, ſhall
be the conſtant prayer of her af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted

            <p>SHE is to be with you in about three

amidſt all her diſtreſſes, Heaven has
ſpared ſo amiable and ſo real a friend
as ſhe has ever found in you. I
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0238500402:18"/>
wondered much that the Duke ſo

            <p>YESTERDAY I entered theſe

that when the iron gate, grating on
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0238500402:41"/>
its hinges, cloſed with apparent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance,
I wept. Not even the
appearance of Laura, who flew to
embrace me, was ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
my drooping ſpirits. I inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
retired to her apartment, and
there I remained till the hour of reſt.
Laura endeavoured to ſooth my agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
ſoul, but in vain; for I have
never ceaſed to weep ſince my arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val.
Oh what I felt when, in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing
through the ſaloon, I found it
filled with weeping domeſtics! To
ſee the poor old woman, that had
nurſed my father, wringing her
hands in an agony of deſpair, and
tearing thoſe venerable locks that
were ſilvered by the hand of time!
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0238500402:42"/>
Oh, it was too much! who could
bear it? — And when I was enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

licked my hand, and gave a
ſhort howl; as if he knew that I
was wretched, and pitied me. Oh
what I ſuffered when you waved
your hand from the battlements,
and bid me adieu in all the ſilent
agony of wo! Oh God, it was too
much! At our ſad parting, the
conſcious heavens wept; all nature
ſeemed overcaſt with melancholy

            <p>I MUST begin this letter with
imploring your forgiveneſs of
the deceit which I have practiſed on
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0238500402:45"/>
you: but I was unwilling that you
ſhould be acquainted with my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
of retiring to this ſad retreat,
till it ſhould be too late to prevent
it; as I dreaded the force of your
attachment to me, unworthy as I
am, might hurry you into the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion
of ſome violence which
would have involved both of us in
freſh difficulties. When you have
heard the motives that influenced,
you will, I truſt, approve the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
of Iſabella. My uncle gave
me the choice of two <hi>evils,</hi> and I
have choſen what to me appeared
the leaſt. I was neceſſitated either
to marry Altina or to retire to this
convent. My reaſons for preferring
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0238500402:46"/>
the latter were two. The <hi>firſt,</hi> that
I ſcorn ſo far to injure any man
as to yield my <hi>hand</hi> to his ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
when my <hi>heart</hi> was devoted to
another. The <hi>ſecond,</hi> that I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
you would ſuffer much leſs
from ſeeing me for ever ſecluded
from the world, than from ſeeing
me the property of another. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
had I become Counteſs of
Altina, I could not, conſiſtently
with the dictates of honour or of
virtue, have fulfilled my promiſe of
correſponding with you; a promiſe
which I made merely to preſerve
the life of my uncle, as I dreaded
the effects of unappeaſed anger.
Had I not been influenced by ſo
weighty a reaſon, I never would
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0238500402:47"/>
have granted a requeſt, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance
with which will certainly
tend to embitter the remainder of our
reſpective lives, as well as conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
call to our remembrance, and
perhaps greatly increaſe, an unhappy
paſſion, which can never now be
gratiſied; for whenever the year of
probation ſhall expire, I muſt aſſume
the veil, and bind myſelf by the
moſt ſolemn vows to conſecrate to
Heaven the remainder of a life that
has indeed been wretched. If you
wiſh to regain that peace you have
loſt, and not to embitter the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder

me from my promiſe; — if

Had you entertained for Alonzo

            <p>I HAVE written to Alonzo, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming
him of my return, and the
motives that induced me to prefer it
to the hand of Altina. He ſeems
much diſatisfied with my conduct,

them, as I did thoſe of the injured
Alonzo. I have no other heart to
offer as a bribe; and if I <hi>had,</hi> Altina
would not eſteem the atonement to
his injured honour ſufficient. How
fatal to repoſe are the effects of
pride! The truth of this aſſertion is
proved by every page of my ſad

            <head>LETTER LXIII.</head>
            <head type="sub">FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA
ISABELLA.</head>
            <p>SCARCE had I finiſhed the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſal
of your laſt, — where you
obſerve how fatal to happineſs are
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0238500402:62"/>
the effects of pride, — when the Duke
was brought home in the arms of
two ſervants, covered with wounds
and blood. He was followed by
Alonzo, who was alſo wounded; but
not ſo ſeverely. When the Duke
was placed on a couch, and the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons
had dreſſed his wounds, Alon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo
addreſſed him in the following
words: "Learn, Don John, from
this night's adventure, that a man
may act with <hi>honour,</hi> though his <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors</hi>
were not <hi>ennobled.</hi>" On ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
theſe words, he retired to his
own houſe, attended by the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons;
who have; declared that <hi>he</hi> is
not in any danger. About the <hi>Duke</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0238500402:63"/>
they art ſtill doubtful; but I hope
the beſt.</p>
            <p>FROM Alonzo, whom I this day
viſited, I learned the following ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of the adventure. As the
Duke was returning home in his
coach, he paſſed through a retired
ſtreet, where the carriage was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked,
by three Villains armed with
daggers. They ordered the coach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
to ſtop inſtantly. The Duke,
on hearing their voices, and ſeeing
them attempt to force open the door
of the carriage, opened the door on
the opoſite ſide, and jumped out. He
then ſet his back againſt a wall; and,
throwing his cloke over his left arm,
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0238500402:64"/>
ſtood on his defence. He was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
attacked by the ruffians, who
wounded him deſperately; his lac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keys
having in the mean time run
off, leaving their maſter to be aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinated.
Whilſt the Duke was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged
in this unequal conteſt, Alon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zo
happened to paſs that way. He
eaſily recognized the perſon who
was calling loudly for aſſiſtance; and
without delay ſtabbed two of the
villains, who inſtantly fell; whilſt
the other is ſecured and has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
that he was hired by the Count
of Altina to murder the Duke.—You,
Iſabella, refuſed to beſtow
your, hand on one man when your
heart was the property of another
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0238500402:65"/>
Heaven has, you ſee, rewarded you;
by delivering you from being united
to a man who is in fact an aſſaſſin.
A character; alas! too common in
Spain: The Duke's miſfortune has
not produced the leaſt change in his
ſentiments. I flattered myſelf, that
the perſon to whom he owed his
life might have been rewarded with
the hand of Iſabella: but, on my
ſuggeſting the matter to him, he was
much enraged; and ſaid, "that he
would rather have experienced a ſtill
more hateful death, than have his
life prolonged only to behold the
diſgrace of his family! — A family
that will ſoon be extinct; and of
which it may then be ſaid, that, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0238500402:66"/>
a courſe of nine hundred years,
it has retained its nobility unconta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated.
As to the young man
(continued he) who aſſiſted me
in diſpatching thoſe villains, I ſhall
reward him in a manner becoming
his ſtation, by beſtowing on him a
large ſum of money; — a reward
much fitter for a, merchant than an
illuſtrious wife!"—How Alonzo
will bear this freſh inſult I know
not; but as he is ſtrongly attached
to you, I truſt you will be able to
pacify his juſt reſentment.</p>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0238500402:69"/>
and ſo ſeriously injured you!
Receive the thanks of Iſabella: A
reward which, though greatly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequate
to your deſerts, is all that
ſhe has left to beſtow. Her heart
has long been yours; and if her
hand were at her own diſpoſal, it
ſhould ſoon be added: but ſhe is
not miſtreſs of her hand; and ſhe
fears, that the only perſon who has
a right to influence her in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal

beſtowing it on one who prizes it too
highly.</p>
            <p>I FLATTERED myſelf, that the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0238500402:70"/>
the Duke might have been deemed
by him a juſt claim to more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

hand of a poor orphan, who has no
ambition but to be virtuous; and
who, were ſhe at her own diſpoſal,
would imitate her mother's conduct,
and prefer Alonzo to the moſt illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious
grandee of Spain. But,
alas! Alberto informs me that there
are no hopes of any change in his
ſentiments on this head. Do, write

<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0238500402:73"/>
whom I am indebted for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longation
of that life which I have
lately riſked in her ſervice; for ſuch
I eſteem to have been the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of her uncle from the daggers
of aſſaſſins. It was not for the Duke
of Arandina I drew my ſword; it
was for a fellow-creature, and for
the uncle of Iſabella. Conſidered
in either of <hi>theſe</hi> capacities, he had
a right to my <hi>aſſiſtance:</hi> as Duke of
Arandina, he had <hi>every</hi> thing to <hi>fear,</hi>
and <hi>nothing</hi> to <hi>hope,</hi> from Alonzo.
But I have juſt received from him
a freſh inſult of ſuch a nature, that
it ſhould not go unrevenged an hour
if he were not connected with you.
He has ſent me a conſiderable ſum
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0238500402:74"/>
of money as a reward for the ſervice
I rendered him! Can you wonder
if this treatment provokes me to the
laſt degree! I have returned the
money with the utmoſt contempt;
adviſing him, at the ſame time, not
to impoſe any <hi>freſh</hi> taſk on the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance
of one whoſe patience is
almoſt exhauſted. Oh Iſabella, why
are you ſo rigid in your notions of
duty? Is he a parent? — is he a
friend? — is he a protector? — No; he
is your ſole torment! Yes, he is the
ſource of all the miſfortunes that
have befallen yourſelf and family;
and yet he is to experience from Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella
all that obedience and reſpect
which could only be due to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgent

are indeed cruel to threaten me with
retiring to a perpetual baniſhment,
if I refuſe to violate the laws of
duty. If I had no uncle to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul
me, I would, as before I told

it; for it is with unſeigned grief
that I communicate to you the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
intelligence.</p>
            <p>THREE nights ago, this convent
was near being reduced to aſhes by
the heedleſſness of a ſervant, who
neglected to extinguiſh the fire of
the kitchen before ſhe went to reſt.
About eleven at night, I was alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
by the cry of fire; and as ſoon as I
had left my apartment, I found that,
owing to the violence of the wind
which then blew high, the flames
had made a conſiderable progreſs.
I ordered the doors to be inſtantly
thrown open; and adviſed every one
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:0238500402:94"/>
to ſecure herſelf by flight: an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
which was followed by all but the
amiable girl, who was ſo lately
added to our ſociety. After we had
retired to a neighbouring church,
I inquired if all the ſiſterhood were
there in ſafety; and was ſhocked to
find that ſhe was ſtill miſſing. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
returned to the convent,
where I found the flames ſtill raging
with the utmoſt violence, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
every attempt to extinguiſh
them; but in vain I endeavoured to
learn any thing concerning the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Iſebella. You will eaſily conceive
what muſt have been my feelings.
The next morning, however, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0238500402:95"/>
the melancholy information
that ſhe was ſeen, after we had quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
the convent, lying at the foot of
the altar: but the confuſion was ſo
great, that no one was ſufficiently
recollected to render her the leaſt
aſſiſtance; and as that part of the
chapel was totally deſtroyed, there is,
alas! no room to doubt that ſhe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
in the flames. All attempts
to diſcover even the leaſt remains of
the dear girl have proved totally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectual.
You will do me the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice
to believe, that amongſt all the
fatal conſequences of this ſad cataſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trophe,
the loſs of that dear girl moſt
deeply affects her, who is, with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere

            <p>YOU, alas! are too well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the ſad tale to
need any freſh information on the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0238500402:101"/>
ſubject. O! Alberto, why was Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella
wretched? — why did ſhe, who
merited ſo much, never poſſeſs a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's
happineſs? Never ſhall I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
her more! Dear, amiable girl!
poſſeſſed of every human virtue — ſhe
is gone to join her ſiſter ſeraphs in
the realms of day — How ſelfiſh is
it in me thus to lament her fate!
Happineſs was never her lot on
earth; but now it is hers beyond the
reach of wo. Not the leaſt remains
of our gentle friend have eſcaped the
ravages of the fire; and I have the
melancholy reflection, that her ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred
aſhes are now trampled under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot
by the clowns who are repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the convent. Happily for me,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:0238500402:102"/>
Iſabella's apartment is deſtroyed; ſo
that I ſhall not have my grief heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
(if that be poſſible) by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating
the cell where ſhe wept:
For to that ſad employment alone
did ſhe conſecrate her hours ſince
her quitting Villarea.</p>
            <p>JUST heaven! for heaven ſtill is
juſt — what do I not ſuffer? Is there
no ſpot on this vaſt globe that will
afford to mortals a retreat ſecure
from wo! I have ſought repoſe in
vain. I, who have ſpent my whole
life within Ventina's now deſolated
walls, ſecluded from that world which
has proved ſo fatal to the repoſe of
my dear, my ever-to-be lamented
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0238500402:103"/>
friend, am now completely wretched!
I have now no ſource of comfort but
the certainty of death: <hi>that</hi> once
paſt, and Iſabella will again be mine.
That Heaven may <hi>accelerate</hi> the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival
of that: wiſhed-for hour, ſhall
be the conſtant prayer of one who is,
with ſincere regard,</p>

            <p>YOUR melancholy letter arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
here this evening; and
as I am a fellow-ſufferer with, you,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0238500402:105"/>
you will eaſily believe how ſincerely
I ſympathiſe with you on your loſs.
The ſad cataſtrophe, as you obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,
affects only thoſe friends who
are, perhaps for years, to lament the
fate of the dear Iſabella. You have
indeed ſuſtained a loſs, in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects,
ſeverer than mine; as I was,
from the moment ſhe quitted Villarea,
deprived of her ſweet ſociety. Yet
I ſhould have had the pleaſure of
her correſpondence. But ſhe is now
happy; her ſorrows are no more;
all her cares are paſt; and ſhe is
now receiving that reward her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed
virtue claimed.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0238500402:106"/>
I WILL not, however, by dwelling on
the merits of her who is now at peace,
add to the diſtreſs of her amiable
friend. But I cannot lay down my
pen without informing you of the
manner in which the Duke received
the news of her death. After per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſing
the fatal letter, <q>She has not
(ſaid he) diſgraced her family, and
ſhall therefore have a monument
erected, to her memory in the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-place
of the Dukes of Aran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dina.
You (ſaid he) ſhall draw
up an inſcription for the monument:
but do not mention the
names of her parents; only ſay,
that ſhe was niece to Don John,
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0238500402:107"/>
twentieth Duke of Arandina, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THUS was he <hi>afficted</hi> by her
death! and ſince that time he has
never mentioned her name; though
I do not ſo much wonder at his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
as his pride now nearly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
to madneſs; and if his life
be ſpared much longer, I have juſt
reaſon to apprehend a total loſs of
his reaſon: — A puniſhment <hi>that,</hi>
which Heaven often inflicts on thoſe
who are ſo haughty as is the poor
Duke.</p>

FATHER ALBERTO.</head>
            <p>THE happieſt of beings has now
the pleaſure to addreſs you;
and to inform you, that Iſabella,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0238500402:110"/>
whom you doubtleſs conſider as no
more, is in perfect health in New
Spain. To explain this myſtery,
you muſt know, that after I had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked
for that country, whence I
never thought to return, I found it
would be impoſſible to ſail till one
in the morning. On receiving this
intelligence, I got into a boat, and
went on ſhore to contemplate, for
the laſt time, thoſe hated walls that
deprived me of Iſabella. As the
convent is, you know, almoſt cloſe
to the ſhore, I ſoon found myſelf
there; and deſiring the men to wait
a little, I quitted them to indulge
myſelf in walking round the walls of
the garden. But as I was going to
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0238500402:111"/>
return to the boat, obſerving the
convent in flames, and the doors
thrown wide open, I inſtantly flew
to the gate, and paſſed unobſerved
through the crowd of nuns who
were ruſhing out, and who were
too much engaged by attention to
their own preſervation even to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
me. As I knew that my Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella
had not yet aſſumed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventual
dreſs, I was ſure ſhe had
not eſcaped me in the crowd. I
flew therefore to that part of the
convent where ſhe reſided; and as
I paſſed through the chapel, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
a female proſtrate at the foot
of the altar; who, on a nearer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
proved to be that dear angel,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0238500402:112"/>
who had fallen down in a ſwoon, and
lay there without any ſigns of life.
I, however, loſt no time; but,
catching the lovely burden in my
arms, bore her, ſtill ſenſeleſs, to
the boat that waited for me; which,
as the nuns had all fled the other
way, I reached totally unobſerved.
No ſooner had I placed her in the
boat, than I tried every poſſible
means to reſtore her; but to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.
My agonies were now incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable,
but I ſtill continued my
endeavours; and after rowing about
thirteen minutes, we reached the
veſſel, which was juſt going to hoiſt
ſail. The Captain, who had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
the fire, eaſily gueſſed whence
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0238500402:113"/>
I had ſtolen ſo invaluable a treaſure,
and objected to receiving her for fear
of conſequences; till obſerving that
ſhe had not the dreſs of a nun, at
my earneſt entreaties he conſented
to receive the dear girl; who now,
to my inexpreſſible joy, began to
diſcover ſigns of life. As ſoon as
we were on board, the veſſel got
under way, whilſt I conveyed Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella
into the great cabin; where
ſhe was ſoon reſtored, owing to the
kindneſs of a lady, who, with her
huſband, was going to New Spain.
As ſoon as ſhe recovered and learned
her ſituation, ſhe inſtantly relapſed,
and it was with difficulty that ſhe was
the ſecond time reſtored at all. When
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0238500402:114"/>
ſhe came to herſelf, I informed her
of the ſituation in which I had found
her; and that, had I not arrived at
the inſtant I did, ſhe muſt have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed
in the flames, as every one
had fled and left her to meet her
fate. She in <hi>time</hi> became more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled
to her ſituation; but at <hi>firſt</hi>
ſhe earneſtly intreated to be put on
ſhore. This, however, the Captain
aſſured her, was impoſſible; as the
ſhip run nine notes in the hour, and
our diſtance was then near twenty
miles from the ſhores of Spain. She
expreſſed her gratitude to me for
preſerving her life, but regretted
that I had taken advantage of the
general confuſion to elope with her.
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0238500402:115"/>
I pleaded only in my defence, that
I was human, and that no man could
have neglected to embrace ſo heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born
an opportunity of poſſeſſing all
he held dear on earth. But, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered
ſhe, my uncle will always
ſuſpect that mine was a <hi>voluntary</hi>
eſcape, and will never pardon me.
Nay, perhaps good Alberto may
even ſuſpect me (and here ſhe wept
bitterly.) If Laura ſtill live (Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
grant ſhe do), every ſhe may ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
Iſabella. — I aſſured her, that
thoſe who knew Iſabella would never
ſuppoſe her capable of acting but
as an angel would do, were it in her
ſituation. As to Laura, I could only
ſay, that I <hi>thought</hi> ſhe paſſed me in
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0238500402:116"/>
the crowd which ruſhed out as I
entered; and that as I ſaw no one in
the convent, I hoped and believed
ſhe was ſafe. In about a week, I
preſumed to ſolicit the bleſſing of
her hand, exerted all the perſuaſion
I was maſter of, and with great
difficulty prevailed on her to confer
on me a reward that would have
overpaid whole ages of miſery. As
there was a prieſt on board, who was
alſo a paſſenger, we were married,
and have now been here five months;
but no ſhip having failed ſince we
arrived, I could not ſooner commun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icate

when the heavenly news of your

all the inſenſibility of a Dutch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor

how far you were culpable in ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
yourſelf to be ſo delivered.
Far from making theſe inquiries, I
had no ſooner read the letter than I
burſt into tears of joy — of ecſtacy;
and have never ceaſed, ſince I heard
the news, to thank the Heaven that
delivered you from death and from
miſery.</p>
            <p>IT is with regret I inform you,
that the Duke can never be made
acquainted with the; ſtory of your
eſcape; as he has been for ſome
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0238500402:122"/>
time delirious, and all attempts
to recal his baniſhed reaſon have
proved ineffectual. This ſad cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity
was occaſioned totally by his
pride; which, of late, became ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive
indeed! He is now attended
by a medical man, who never loſes
ſight of him for an inſtant; but
who ſays, he does not apprehend
that his life will laſt long, as his

            <p>I WOULD wiſh you to return as

his pride increaſes! Even now he
deſires that no ſervant will preſent
him any thing but on the knee; and
gives every day ſome freſh inſtance
of growing arrogance. He is indeed
an object of pity and terror to all
who ſee him. Heaven reſtore him
to reaſon before it call him hence.</p>
            <p>LAURA is, as you will hear from

great noiſe iſſuing from the

<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0238500402:136"/>
to learn the reaſon of the tumult;
and the moment I entered the room,
perceived the Duke weltering in his
blood. The phyſician who attended
him told me, that he had left the
Duke only an inſtant, whilſt he went
to the next apartment to bring him
ſome medicine; and when he return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
he found him in this horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition,
with a dagger in his hand;
which it ſeems he had procured, but
<hi>how</hi> I have not been able to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.
When I arrived, there were
ſcarce any ſigns of life; and in a few

I HAVE ordered ſeveral hundred

the Almighty, ſhe may at laſt gain

            <p>THE Duke's funeral is fixed for

            <p>YESTERDAY a veſſel from
New Spain arrived here; on
board of which there was a lady of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0238500402:141"/>
diſtinction, whoſe huſband had been
drowned in the courſe of the voyage;
and I was informed that ſhe was in a
very bad ſtate. On receiving this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence,
I, as was my duty, went
on board the ſhip, and found that
the lady was of Villarea; and that
her only ſon, an infant of nine
months old, was with her. She was
ſo weak as not to be able to ſpeak,
and it was apprehended ſhe could
not ſurvive many days. I had her
landed and placed in one of the beſt
houſes here where ſhe is attended
by the faculty of the place; and
they give me hopes that ſhe may
yet recover. I learnt from one of
her attendants, that you are her
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0238500402:142"/>
particular friend, which has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned

            <head type="sub">FATHER ALBERTO to DONNA LAURA.</head>
            <p>I TOLD you in my laſt hurried
ſcrawl, that our Iſabella was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
in Spain, and what misfortunes
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0238500402:144"/>
had befallen her. The inſtant I had
ſcratched theſe few lines to you, I
ſet off for Cadiz, and found the ſad
mourner in a very miſerable ſtate,
as you will ſuppoſe. She had, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
recovered her ſtrength ſo much
as to be able to ſpeak; and ſhowed
great pleaſure at my arrival. She
was in bed, and appeared wan and
much exhauſted. On a little couch,
near the bed, lay a ſmiling inſant
that ſeems to inherit all its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
charms. She wept bitterly
on my kiſſing the ſweet babe;
and ſaid, it was all ſhe had by
which to remember her Alonzo.
It was about nine months old;
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0238500402:145"/>
and ſhe has named it Frederick
Alonzo.</p>
            <p>I HOPE God will ſupport her
in all her diſtreſſes, of which Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
has given her a large propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
Indeed I have never ceaſed
to weep ſince I arrived here. To
ſee the mother hang in agony over
her infant ſon, to hear her ſighs,
and to witneſs. her ſorrows, is too
much for me.</p>
            <p>OF poor, amiable, Alonzo's death,
I received the following account
from one of her attendants. After
they had embarked for Old Spain,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0238500402:146"/>
and were juſt out of the harbour,
Iſabella recollected a caſket, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
the certificate of her mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage,
which ſhe had left on ſhore.
Alonzo inſiſted on going to fetch it
himſelf, and got into a boat; they
were about this time two miles from
ſhore. Scarce had the boat got half
way, when a hurricane overſet her;
all her crew periſhed, and the ſhip
was driven out to ſea. The hurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane
continued for twelve hours; du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
which time the ſhip was in the
greateſt danger of foundering. When
the hurricane ſubſided, they found
themſelves far out at ſea; and the
wind was ſo contrary, that they
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0238500402:147"/>
could not return to inquire if the
corpſe of Alonzo had been driven on
ſhore; for there were no hopes of his
life being preſerved, as the hurricane
was ſo violent that no one could
gain the ſhore. Poor Iſabella was
for a long time quite delirious, and
accuſed herſelf as the cauſe of his
death. I truſt, however, that ſhe
will yet recover, and that the young
Alonzo will not be deprived of both
his parents.</p>
            <p>SHE ſays, whenever ſhe is able
to hold a pen, ſhe will write to
you. She ſends her love to you:
and I muſt now lay down my
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0238500402:148"/>
pen, as the phyſicians are arrived;
and I always attend her when they
come.</p>

            <p>O LAURA, what ecſtacy will
you feel at the peruſal of this
letter! Yeſterday, as the Marchioneſs
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0238500402:153"/>
and I were walking in the grove, a
figure approached us, which ſo near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
reſembled Alonzo that I ſtarted;
but on a nearer approach it proved
to be that very Alonzo, whoſe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
death had nearly proved fatal
to Iſabella. The interview, as you
will ſuppoſe, was intereſting in the
extreme. I will not attempt to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe
it, leſt I ſhould not do juſtice
to ſuch a ſcene. Suffice it to ſay,
that pleaſure now reigns unrivalled
within theſe happy walls. The
eſcape of Alonzo was indeed nearly
miraculous! He alone, of all the
crew, eſcaped by clinging to a plank,
and at length reached the ſhore near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0238500402:154"/>
dead with fatigue. His ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
during his abſence from Iſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella,
were doubtleſs of the ſevereſt
nature. Ignorant of her fate, and
Unable to acquaint her with his
eſcape, he embarked for Old Spain
in the next fleet that failed; and
immediately oh his arrival, wrote to
me to prepare Iſebella for his return:
but unhappily the letter never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived.
<hi>Unhappily,</hi> I ſay, becauſe
the ſurpriſe had nearly proved fatal
to Iſabella.</p>
            <p>GOD grant that the happineſs
which this amiable couple now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy,
may henceforth remain unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loyed

by misfortune, and that the
remainder of their days may be
ſpent in a ſtate of uninterrupted tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity.
In this prayer <hi>you,</hi> I am
