            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>AS cenſure is but awkwardly ſoftened by apology, I ſhall offer you no apology for this letter. The eventful criſis to which your double politics have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted the affairs of your country requires an inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation uncramped by ceremony.</p>
            <p>There was a time when the fame of America, moral and political, ſtood fair and high in the world. The luſtre of her revolution extended itſelf to every indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual; and to be a citizen of America gave a title to reſpect in Europe. Neither meanneſs nor ingratitude had then mingled itſelf into the compoſition of her character. Her reſiſtance to the attempted tyranny of England left her unſuſpected of the one, and her open acknowledgment of the aid ſhe received from
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0190703300:4"/>France precluded all ſuſpicion of the other. The Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington of politics had not then appeared.</p>
            <p>At the time I left America (April 1787) the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental convention that formed the federal conſtitution was on the point of meeting. Since that time new ſchemes of politics and new diſtinctions of parties, have ariſen. The term <hi>Antifederaliſt</hi> has been applied to all thoſe who combated the defects of that conſtitution, or oppoſed the meaſures of your adminiſtration. It was only to the abſolute neceſſity of eſtabliſhing ſome federal authority, extending equally over all the States, that an inſtrument, ſo inconſiſtent as the preſent fede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral conſtitution is, obtained a ſuffrage. I would have voted for it myſelf, had I been in America, or even for a worſe rather than have had none; provided it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the means of remedying its defects by the ſame appeal to the people by which it was to be eſtabliſhed. It is always better policy to leave removeable errors to expoſe themſelves, than to hazard too much in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending againſt them theoretically.</p>
            <p>I have introduced thoſe obſervations, not only to mark the general difference between antifederaliſt and anti-conſtitutionaliſt, but to preclude the effect, and even the application, of the former of thoſe terms to myſelf. I declare myſelf oppoſed to ſeveral matters in the conſtitution, particularly to the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which, what is called the Executive, is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to the long duration of the Senate; and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0190703300:5"/>if I live to return to America I will uſe all my en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to have them altered.<note n="*" place="bottom">I have always been oppoſed to the mode of refining Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment up to an individual, or what is called a ſingle Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. Such a man will always be the chief of a party. A plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is far better: It combines the maſs of a nation better to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: And beſides this, it is neceſſary to the manly mind of a republic, that it loſes the debaſing idea of obeying an individual.</note> I alſo declare my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf oppoſed to almoſt the whole of your adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for I know it to have been deceitful, if not even perfidious, as I ſhall ſhew in the courſe of this letter. But as to the point of conſolidating the ſtates into a federal government, it ſo happens, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for that purpoſe came originally from myſelf. I propoſed it in a letter to Chancellor Livingſton in the ſpring of the year 1782, whilſt that gentleman was mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter for foreign affairs. The five per cent. duty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended by Congreſs had then fallen through, having been adopted by ſome of the States, altered by others, rejected by Rhode Iſland, and repealed by Virginia after it had been conſented to. The propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal in the letter I allude to was to get over the whole difficulty at once, by annexing a continental legiſlative body to Congreſs; for, in order to have any law of the Union uniform, the caſe could only be, that either Congreſs, as it then ſtood, muſt frame the law, and the States ſeverally adopt it without alteration, or, the States muſt elect a Continental Legiſlature for the purpoſe. Chancellor Livingſton, Robert Morris, Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneur
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0190703300:6"/>Morris and myſelf had a meeting at the houſe of Robert Morris on the ſubject of that letter. There was no diverſity of opinion on the propoſition for a Continental Legiſlature. The only difficulty was on the manner of bringing the propoſition forward. For my own part, as I conſidered it as a remedy in reſerve, that could be applied at any time, <hi>when the States ſaw themſelves wrong enough to be put right</hi> (which did not appear to me to be the caſe at that time) I did not ſee the propriety of urging it precipitately, and declined being the publiſher of it myſelf. After this account of a fact, the leaders of your party will ſcarcely have the hardineſs to apply to me the term of antifederaliſt. But I can go to a date and to a fact beyond this; for the propoſition for electing a Continental Convention to form the Continental Government is one of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects treated of in the pamphlet <hi>Common Senſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus cleared away a little of the rubbiſh that might otherwiſe have lain in my way, I return to the point of time at which the preſent Federal Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and your adminiſtration began. It was very well ſaid by an anonymous writer in Philadelphia, about a year before that period, that <hi>"thirteen ſtaves and ne'er a hoop will not make a barrel,"</hi> and as any kind of hoop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the barrel, however defectively executed, would be better than none, it was ſcarcely poſſible but that conſiderable advantages muſt ariſe from the federal hooping of the States. It was with pleaſure that every
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0190703300:7"/>ſincere friend to America beheld, as the natural effect of union, her riſing proſperity; and it was with grief they ſaw that proſperity mixed, even in the bloſſom, with the germ of corruption. Monopolies of every kind marked your adminiſtration almoſt in the moment of its commencement. The lands obtained by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution were laviſhed upon partizans; the intereſt of the diſbanded ſoldier was ſold to the ſpeculator; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice was acted under the pretence of faith; and the chief of the army became the patron of the fraud. From ſuch a beginning what could be expected, but what has happened? A mean and ſervile ſubmiſſion to the inſults of one nation, treachery and ingratitude to another.</p>
            <p>Some vices make their approach with ſuch a ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did appearance, that we ſcarcely know to what claſs of moral diſtinctions they belong. They are rather vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues corrupted, than vices originally. But meanneſs and ingratitude, than vices originally. But meanneſs and ingratitude have nothing equivocal in their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. There is not a trait in them that renders them doubtful. They are ſo originally vice, that they are generated in the dung of other vices, and crawl into exiſtence with the filth upon their back. The fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives have found protection in you, and the levee-room is their place of rendezvous.</p>
            <p>As the Federal Conſtitution is a copy, not quite ſo baſe as the original, of the form of the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, an imitation of its vices was naturally to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0190703300:8"/>So intimate is the connection between <hi>form</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> that to adopt the one is to invite the other. Imitation is naturally progreſſive, and is rapidly ſo in matters that are vicious.</p>
            <p>Soon after the Federal Conſtitution arrived in England, I received a letter from a female literary correſpondent (a native of New York) very well mixed with friendſhip, ſentiment and politics. In my anſwer to that letter I permitted myſelf to ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble into the wilderneſs of imagination, and to antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate what might hereafter be the condition of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. I had no idea that the picture then drew was realizing ſo faſt, and ſtill leſs that, Mr. Waſhington was hurrying it on. As the extract I allude to is congenial with the ſubject I am upon, I here tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You touch me on a very tender point when you ſay, <hi>that my friends on your ſide the water cannot be reconciled to the idea of my abandoning America, even for my native England.</hi> They are right. I had rather ſee my horſe Button eating the graſs of Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentown or Morriſenia, than ſee all the pomp and ſhew of Europe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>A thouſand years hence, for I muſt indulge a few thoughts, perhaps in leſs, America may be what England now is. The innocence of her cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, that won the hearts of all nations in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, may ſound like a romance, and her inimita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0190703300:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>virtue as if it had never been. The ruins of that liberty, which thouſands bled to obtain, may juſt furniſh materials for a village tale, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort a ſigh from ruſtic ſenſibility; whilſt the faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of that day, enveloped in diſſipation, ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ride the principle and deny the fact.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>When we contemplate the fall of empires &amp; the extinction of the nations of the ancient world, we ſee but little more to excite our regret than the mouldering ruins of pompous palaces, magnificent monuments, lofty pyramids, and walls and towers of the moſt coſtly workmanſhip: But when the empire of America ſhall fall, the ſubject for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative ſorrow will be infinitely greater than crumbling braſs or marble can inſpire. It will not then be ſaid, here ſtood a temple of vaſt antiquity, here roſe a babel of inviſible height, or there a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace of ſumptuous extravagance; but here ah pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thought! the nobleſt work of human wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the grandeſt ſcene of human glory, the fair cauſe of freedom roſe and fell. Read this, and then aſk, if I forget America?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Impreſſed, as I was, with apprehenſions of this kind, I had America conſtantly in mind in all the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I afterwards made. The firſt, and ſtill more, the ſecond part of Rights of Man bear evident marks of this watchfulneſs; and the Diſſertation on Firſt Principles of Government goes more directly to the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0190703300:10"/>point than either of the former. I now paſs on to other ſubjects.</p>
            <p>It will be ſuppoſed by thoſe into whoſe hands this letter may fall, that I have ſome perſonal reſentment againſt you; I will therefore ſettle this point before I proceed farther.</p>
            <p>If I have any reſentment, you muſt acknowledge that I have not been haſty in declaring it; neither would it be now declared (for what are private re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentments to the public) if the cauſe of it did not unite itſelf as well with your public as your private charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and with the motives of your political conduct.</p>
            <p>The part I acted in the American revolution is well known; I ſhall not here repeat it. I know alſo that had it not been for the aid received from France in men, money and ſhips, that your cold and unmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary conduct (as I ſhall ſhew in the courſe of this letter) would, in all probability, have loſt America; at leaſt ſhe would not have been the independent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe now is. You ſlept away your time in the field till the finances of the country were completely exhauſted, and you have but little ſhare in the glory of the final event. It is time, fir, to ſpeak the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſguiſed language of hiſtorical truth.</p>
            <p>Elevated to the chair of the Preſidency you aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the merit of every thing to yourſelf, and the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ingratitude of your conſtitution began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear. You commenced your Preſidential carreer by
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0190703300:11"/>encouraging and ſwallowing the groſſeſt adulation, and you travelled America from one end—to the other, to put yourſelf in the way of receiving it. You have as many addreſſes in your cheſt as James the II. As to what were your views, for if you are not great enough to have ambition you are little enough to have vanity, they cannot be directly inferred from expreſſions of your own; but the partizans of your politics have divulged the ſecret.</p>
            <p>John Adams has ſaid (and John, it is known, was always a ſpeller after places and offices, and never thought his little ſervices were highly enough paid) John has ſaid, that as Mr. Waſhington had no child, that the Preſidency ſhould be made hereditary in the family of Lund Waſhington. John might then have counted upon ſome ſine-cure for himſelf and a proviſion for his deſcendants. He did not go ſo far as to ſay alſo, that the Vice Preſidency ſhould be he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary in the family of John Adams. He prudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left that to ſtand upon the ground, that one good turn deſerves another.<note n="*" place="bottom">Two perſons to whom John Adams ſaid this, told n e of it The ſecretary of Mr. Jay was preſent when it was told to me.</note>
            </p>
            <p>John Adams is one of thoſe men who never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated the origin of government, or compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended any thing of firſt principles. If he had, he muſt have ſeen that the right to ſet up and eſtabliſh hereditary government never did, and never can,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0190703300:12"/>exiſt in any generation, at any time whatever; that it is of the nature of treaſon; becauſe it is an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to take away the rights of all the minors living at that time, and of all ſucceeding generations. It is of a degree beyond common treaſon. It is a ſin againſt nature. The equal right of generations is a right fixed in the nature of things. It belongs to the ſon when of age, as it belonged to the father before him. John Adams would himſelf deny the right that any former deceaſed generation could have to decree authoritatively a ſucceſſion of Governors over him, or over his children; and yet he aſſumes the pretended right, treaſonable as it is, of acting it himſelf. His ignorance is his beſt excuſe.</p>
            <p>John Jay has ſaid (and this John was always the ſycophant of every thing in power, from Mr. Girard in America to Grenville in England) John Jay has ſaid, that the Senate ſhould have been appointed for life. He would then have been ſure of never wanting a lucrative appointment for himſelf, nor have had any ſears about impeachments.

            <p>Could I have known to what degree of corruption &amp; perfidy the adminiſtrative part of the government in America had deſcended, I could have been at no loſs to have underſtood the reſervedneſs of Mr.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0190703300:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>Waſhington towards me, during my impriſonment in the Luxembourg. There are caſes in which ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is loud language.</p>
            <p>I will here explain the cauſe of my impriſonment, and return to Mr. Waſhington afterwards.</p>
            <p>In the courſe of that rage, terror and ſuſpicion, which the brutal letter of the Duke of Brunſwick firſt ſtarted into exiſtence in France, it happened, that almoſt every man who was oppoſed to violence, or who was not violent himſelf, became ſuſpected. I had conſtantly been oppoſed to every thing which was of the nature, or of the appearance, of violence; but as I had always done it in a manner that ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to be a principle founded in my heart, and not a political manoeuvre, it precluded the pretence of accuſing me. I was reached, however, under ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pretence.</p>
            <p>A decree was paſſed to impriſon all perſons born in England; but as I was a member of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and had been complimented with the honorary ſtile of Citizen of France, as Mr. Waſhington and ſome other Americans had been, this decree fell ſhort of reaching me. A motion was afterwards made and carried, ſupported chiefly by Bourdon de l'Oiſe, for expelling foreigners from the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. My expulsion being thus effected, the two committees of Public Safety and of General Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0190703300:14"/>of which Robeſpierre was the dictator, put me in arreſtation under the former decree for impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſons born in England. Having thus ſhewn under what pretence the impriſonment was effected, I come to ſpeak of ſuch parts of the caſe as apply between me and Mr. Waſhington, either as Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or as an individual.</p>
            <p>I have always conſidered that a foreigner, ſuch as I was in fact with reſpect to France, might be a member of a Convention for forming a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without affecting his right of citizenſhip in the country to which he belongs, but not a member of a government after a conſtitution is formed; and I have uniformly acted upon this diſtinction. To be a member of a government requires that a perſon be in allegiance to that government and to the country locally. But a conſtitution being a thing of princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and not of action, and which, after it be formed, is to be referred to the people for their approbation or rejection, does not require allegiance in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons forming and propoſing it; and beſides this, it is only to the thing after it be formed and eſtabliſhed, and to the country after its governmental character is fixed by the adoption of a conſtitution, that alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance can be given. No oath of allegiance or of citizenſhip was required of the members who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the Convention; there was nothing exiſting in form to ſwear allegiance to. If any ſuch condition
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0190703300:15"/>had been required I could not,as Citizen of America in fact, though Citizen of France by compliment, have accepted a ſeat in the Convention.</p>
            <p>As my citizenſhip in America was not altered or diminiſhed, by any thing I had done in Europe (on the contrary it ought to have been conſidered as ſtrengthened, for it was the American principle of government that I was endeavouring to ſpread in Europe) and as it is the duty of every government to charge itſelf with the care of any of its citizens who may happen to fall under an arbitrary perſecution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and is alſo one of the reaſons for which Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors or Miniſters are appointed,—it was the duty of the executive department in America to have made (at leaſt) ſome enquiries about me, as ſoon as it heard of my impriſonment. But if this had not been the caſe, that government owed it to me on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ground and principle of honor and gratitude. Mr. Waſhington owed it to me on every ſcore of private acquaintance, I will not now ſay, firend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; for it has for ſome time been known, by thoſe who know him, that he has no friendſhips; that he is incapable of forming any; he can ſerve or deſert a man or a cauſe with conſtitutional indifference; and it is this cold hermophrodite faculty that impoſed it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon the world, and was credited for a while by enemies as by friends, for prudence, moderation and impartiality.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0190703300:16"/>Soon after that I was put in arreſtation and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſoned in the Luxembourg, the Americans who were then in Paris went in a body to the bar of the Convention to reclaim me. They were anſwered by the, then, Preſident, Vadier, who has ſince abſcond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that <hi>I was born in England;</hi> and it was ſignified to them by ſome of the Committee of surety Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to whom they were referred (I have been told it was Billaud Varrennes) that their reclamation of me was only that act of individuals without any autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from the American government.</p>
            <p>A few days after this, ail communication from perſons impriſoned to any perſon without the priſon was cut off by an order of the Police. I neither ſaw, nor heard from, any body for ſix months; and the only hope that remained to me was, that a new miniſter would arrive from America to ſuper-cede Morris, and that he would be authoriſed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into the cauſe of my impriſonment. But even this hope, in the ſtate to which matters were daily arriving, was too remote to have any conſolatory ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and I contented myſelf with the thought, that I might be remembered when it would be too late. There is perhaps no condition from which a man conſcious of his own uprightneſs cannot derive con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation; for it is in itſelf a conſolation for him to find that he can bear that condition with calmneſs and fortitude.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0190703300:17"/>From about the middle of March (1794) to the fall of Robeſpierre, 29th July, (9th of Thermidor) the ſtate of things in the priſon was a continued ſcene of horror. No man could count upon life for twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hours. To ſuch a pitch of rage and ſuſpicion was Robeſpierre and his committee arrived, that it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if they feared to leave a man to live. Scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a night paſſed but in which ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty or more were taken out of the priſon, carried before a pretended tribunal in the morning, and guillotined before night. One hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine were taken out of the Luxembourg in one night in the month of July and one hundred and ſixty of them guillotined. A liſt of two hundred more, according to the report in the priſon, was preparing a few days before Robeſpierre fell. In this laſt liſt I have good reaſon to believe I was included. A memorandum, in the hand writing of Robeſpierre, was afterwards produced in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, by the committee to whom the papers of Robeſpierre were referred, in theſe words:</p>
            <q>Demander que Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Paine ſoit decreté d'accuſation, pour l'in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teret de l'Amerique au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant que de la France.</q>
            <q>Demand that Thomas Paine be decreed of accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, for the intereſt of America as well as of France.</q>
            <p>I had then been impriſoned ſeven months, and the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0190703300:18"/>ſilence of the executive government of America, Mr. Waſhington, upon the caſe and upon every thing reſpecting me, was explanation enough to Robeſpierre that he might proceed to extremities.</p>
            <p>A violent fever which had nearly terminated my exiſtence, was I believe, the circumſtance that preſerved it. I was not in a condition to be remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or to know of what was paſſing, or of what had paſſed for more than a month. It makes a blank in my remembrance of life. The firſt thing I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of was the fall of Robeſpierre.</p>
            <p>About a week after this Mr. Monroe arrived to ſupercede Gouverneur Morris, and as ſoon as I was able to write a note legible enough to be read, I found a way to convey one to him, by means of the man who lighted the lamps in the priſon; and whoſe unabated friendſhip to me, from whom he had never received any ſervice, and with difficulty accepted any recompence, puts the character of Mr. Waſhington to ſhame.</p>
            <p>In a ſaw days I received a meſſage from Mr. Monroe, conveyed to me in a note from an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate perſon, with aſſurance of his friendſhip, and expreſſing a deſire that I would reſt that caſe in his hands. After a fortnight or more had paſſed and hearing nothing further, I wrote to a friend who was then in Paris, a citizen of Philadelphia, requeſting him to inform me what was the true
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0190703300:19"/>ſituation of things with reſpect to me. I was ſure that ſomething was the matter. I began to have hard thoughts of Mr. Waſhington; but I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to encourage them.</p>
            <p>In about ten days I received an anſwer to my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in which the writer ſays: <q>Mr. Monroe has told me that he has no orders (meaning from the preſident, Mr. Waſhington) reſpecting you, but that he (Mr. Monroe) will do every thing in his power to liberate you; but from what I learn from the Americans lately arrived in Paris, you are not conſidered, either by the American govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or by the individuals, as an American citizen.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I was now at no loſs to underſtand Mr. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington and his new fangled faction, and that their policy was ſilently to leave me to fall in France. They were ruſhing as faſt as they could venture, without awakening the jealouſy of America, into all the vices and corruptions of the Britiſh govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and it was no more conſiſtent with the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of Mr. Waſhington, and thoſe who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſurrounded him, than it was with that of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſpierre or of Pitt, that I ſhould ſurvive. They have however, miſſed the mark and the reaction is upon themſelves.</p>
            <p>Upon the receipt of the letter juſt alluded to, I ſent a memorial to Mr. Monroe which the reader will find in the appendix, and I received from him
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0190703300:20"/>the following anſwer. It is dated the 18th of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, but did not come to hand till about the 10th of October. I was then falling into a relapſe, the weather was becoming damp and cold, fuel was not to be had, and the abſceſs in my ſide, the conſequence of theſe things, and of the want of air and exerciſe, was beginning to form and which has continued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveable ever ſince. Here follows Mr. Monroe's letter.</p>

                     <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I was favoured ſoon after my arrival here with ſeveral letters from you and more latterly with one in the character of memorial, upon the ſubject of your confinement; and ſhould have anſwered them at the times they were reſpectively written had I not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded you would have calculated with certainty upon the deep intereſt I take in your welfare and the pleaſure with which I ſhall embrace every opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in my power to ſerve you. I ſhould ſtill purſue the ſame courſe, and for reaſons which muſt obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly occur, if I did not find that you are diſquieted with apprehenſions upon intereſting points, &amp; which juſtice to you and our country equally forbid you ſhould entertain. You mention that you have been informed you are not conſidered as an American citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen by the Americans, and that you have likewiſe
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0190703300:21"/>heard that I had no inſtructions reſpecting you by the government. I doubt not the perſon who gave you the information meant well, but I ſuſpect he did not even convey accurately his own ideas on the firſt point; for I preſume the moſt he could ſay is that you had likewiſe become a French citizen and which by no means deprived you of being an American one. Even this however may be doubted, I mean the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of citizenſhip in France, and I confeſs you have ſaid much to ſhew that it has not been made. I really ſuſpect that this was all that the gentleman who wrote you, and thoſe Americans he heard ſpeak upon the ſubject, meant. It becomes my duty however to declare to you, that I conſider you as an American citizen, and that you are conſidered uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally in that character by the people of America. As ſuch you are entitled to my attention; and ſo far as it can be given conſiſtently with thoſe obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which are mutual between every government and even a tranſient paſſenger you ſhall receive it.</p>
                  <p>The Congreſs have never decided upon the ſubject of citizenſhip in a manner to regard the preſent caſe. By being with us through the revolution you are of our country as abſolutely as if you had been born there, and you are no more of England than every native American is. This is the true doctrine in the preſent caſe, ſo far as it becomes complicated with any other conſideration. I have mentioned it
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0190703300:22"/>to make you eaſy upon the only point which could give you any diſquietude.</p>
                  <p>Is it neceſſary for me to tell you how much all your countrymen, I ſpeak of the great maſs of the people, are intereſted in your welfare? They have not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the hiſtory of their own revolution and the difficult ſcenes through which they paſſed; nor do they review its ſeveral ſtages without reviving in their boſoms a due ſenſibility of the merits of thoſe who ſerved them in that great and arduous conflict The crime of ingratitude has not yet ſtained, and I truſt never will ſtain, our national character. You are conſidered by them as not only having rendered important ſervices in our own revolution, but as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, on a more extenſive ſcale, the friend of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man rights, and a diſtinguiſhed, an able, advocate in favour of public liberty. To the welfare of Thomas Paine the Americans are not, nor can they be, indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent.</p>
                  <p>Of the ſenſe which the Preſident has always en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained of your merits, and of his friendly diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition towards you, you are too well aſſured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire any declaration of it from me. That I forward his wiſhes in ſeeking your ſafety is what I well know, and this will form an additional obligation on me to perform what I ſhould otherwiſe conſider as a duty.</p>
                  <p>You are, in my opinion, at preſent, menaced by no kind of danger. To liberate you will be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0190703300:23"/>of my endeavours, and as ſoon as poſſible. But you muſt, until that event ſhall be accompliſhed, bear your ſituation with patience and fortitude. You will likewiſe have the juſtice to recollect, that I am placed here upon a difficult theatre,<note n="*" place="bottom">This I preſume alludes to the embarraſſments which the ſtrange conduct of Gouv. Morris had occaſioned, and which, I well know, had created ſuſpicions upon the ſincerity of Mr. Waſhington.</note> many impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant objects to attend to, with few to conſult. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes me in purſuit of thoſe to regulate my conduct in reſpect to each, as to the manner and the time, as will, in my judgment, be beſt calculated to accompliſh the whole. With great eſteem and reſpect conſider me perſonally your friend.</p>

            <p>The part in Mr. Monroe's letter in which he ſpeaks of the Preſident (Mr. Waſhington) is put in ſoft lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. Mr. Monroe knew what Mr. Waſhington had ſaid formerly, and he was willing to keep that in view. But the fact is, not only that Mr. Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton had given no orders to Mr. Monroe, as the letter ſtated; but he did not ſo much as ſay to him, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire if Mr. Paine be dead or alive, in priſon or out, or ſee if there is any aſſiſtance we can given him.</p>
            <p>While theſe matters were paſſing the liberations from the priſons were numerous; from twenty to forty in the courſe of almoſt every twenty four hours.
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0190703300:24"/>The continuance of my impriſonment, after a new miniſter had arrived immediately from America, which was now more than two months, was a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo obviouſly ſtrange, that I found the character of the American government ſpoken of in very unqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified terms of reproach; not only by thoſe who ſtill remained in priſon, but by thoſe who were liberated, and by perſons who had acceſs to the priſon from without. Under theſe circumſtances I wrote again to Mr. Monroe, and found occaſion, among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things to ſay: <q>It will not add to the popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Mr. Waſhington to have it believed in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, as it is believed here, that he connives at my impriſonment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The caſe, ſo far as it reſpected Mr. Monroe was, that having to get over the difficulties which the ſtrange conduct of Gouverneur Morris had thrown in the way of a ſucceſſor, and having no authority from the American government to ſpeak officially upon any thing relating to me, he found himſelf obliged to proceed by unofficial means with individual mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; for though Robeſpierre was overthrown, the Robeſpierrian members of the Committee of Public Safety ſtill remained in conſiderable force, and had they found out that Mr. Monroe had no official au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority upon the caſe, they would have paid little or no regard to his reclamation of me. In the mean time my health was ſuffering exceedingly, the dreary
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0190703300:25"/>proſpect of winter was coming on, and impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſtill a thing of danger.</p>
            <p>After the Robeſpierrian members of the Committee were removed by the expiration of their time of ſerving, Mr. Monroe reclaimed me, and I was libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the 4th of November. Mr. Monroe arrived in Paris the beginning of Auguſt before. All the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of my impriſonment, at leaſt, I owe not to Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſpierre, but to his colleague in projects, George Waſhington. Immediately upon my liberation Mr. Monroe invited me to his houſe, where I remained more than a year and an half; and I ſpeak of his aid and his friendſhip, as an open hearted man will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways do in ſuch a caſe, with reſpect and gratitude.</p>
            <p>Soon after my liberation the Convention paſſed an unanimous vote to invite me to return to my ſeat among them. The times were ſtill unſettled and dangerous, as well from without as from within, for the coalition was unbroken, and the conſtitution not ſettled. I choſe, however, to accept the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; for as I undertake nothing but what I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve to be right, I abandon nothing that I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; and I was willing alſo to ſhew, that, as I was not of a caſt of mind to be deterred by proſpects or retro-proſpects of danger, ſo neither were my prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to be weakened by misfortune, or perverted by diſguſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:0190703300:26"/>Being now once more abroad in the world I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to find that I was not the only one who had conceived an unfavourable opinion of Mr. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington. It was evident that his character was on the decline as well among Americans as among fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners of different nations. From being the chief of a government, he had made himſelf the chief of a party; and his integrity was queſtioned, for his politics had a doubtful appearance. The miſſion of Mr. Jay to London, notwithſtanding there was an American miniſter there already, had then taken place, and was beginning to be talked of. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to others, as it did to me, to be enveloped in myſtery, which every day ſerved either to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe or to explain into matter of ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>In the year 1790, or about that time, Mr. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington as Preſident had ſent Gouverneur Morris to London as his ſecret agent to have ſome communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with the Britiſh miniſtry. To cover the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of Morris it was given out, I know not by whom, that he went as an agent from Robert Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris to borrow money in Europe, and the report was permitted to paſs uncontradicted. The event of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris's negociation was, that Mr. Hammond was ſent miniſter from England to America, and Pinckney from America to England, and himſelf miniſter to France. If while Morris was miniſter in France he was not an emiſſary of the Britiſh miniſtry and the
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0190703300:27"/>coaleſced powers, he gave ſtrong reaſons to ſuſpect him of it. No one who ſaw his conduct, and heard his converſation, could doubt his being in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; and had he not got off at the time he did, after his recall, he would have been in arreſtation. Some letters of his had fallen into the hands of the Committee of Public Safety, and enquiry was mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after him.</p>
            <p>A great buſtle has been made by Mr. Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton about the conduct of Genet in America; while that of his own miniſter, Morris, in France was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more reproachable. If Genet was impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent or raſh, he was not treacherous; but Morris was all three. He was the enemy of the French re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution in every ſtage of it. But, notwithſtanding this conduct on the part of Morris, and the known profligacy of his character, Mr. Waſhington, in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he wrote to him at the time of recalling him on the complaint and requeſt of the Committee of Public Safety, aſſures him, that though he had complied with that requeſt, he ſtill retained he ſame eſteem and friendſhip for him as before. This letter Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris was fooliſh enough to tell of; and, as his own character and conduct were notorious, the telling of it could have but one effect, which was that of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicating the character of the writer. Morris ſtill loiters in Europe, chiefly in England; and Mr. Waſhington is ſtill in correſpondence with him;
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0190703300:28"/>Mr. Waſhington ought therefore to expect, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally ſince his conduct in the affair of Jay's treaty, that France muſt conſider Morris and Waſhington as men of the ſame deſcription. The chief differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, however, between the two is (for in politics there is none) that the one is profligate enough to profeſs an indifference about <hi>moral</hi> principles, and the other is prudent enough to conceal the want of them.</p>
            <p>About three months after I was at liberty, the official note of Jay to Grenville on the ſubject of the capture of American veſſels by Britiſh cruiſers appeared in the American papers that arrived at Paris. Every thing was of a-piece. Every thing was mean. The ſame kind of character went to all circumſtances public or private. Diſguſted at this national degradation, as well as at the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar conduct of Mr. Waſhington to me, I wrote to him (Mr. Waſhington) on the 22d of February (1795) under cover to the then Secretary of State (Mr. Randolph) and entruſted the letter to Mr. Letombe, who was appointed French conſul to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, and was on the point of taking his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture. When I ſuppoſed Mr. Letombe had ſailed, I mentioned the letter to Mr. Monroe, and as I was then in his houſe, I ſhewed it to him. He expreſſed a wiſh that i would recall it, which he ſuppoſed migh be done, as he had learned that Mr. Letombe
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0190703300:29"/>had not then failed. I agreed to do ſo, and it was returned by Mr. Letombe under cover to Mr. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe.</p>

                  <p>I had written you a letter by Mr. Letombe, French conſul, but at the requeſt of Mr. Monroe I withdrew it, and the letter is ſtill by me. I was the more eaſily prevailed upon to do this, as it was then my intention to have returned to America the latter end of the preſent year, 1795; but the illneſs I now ſuffer prevents me. In caſe I had come, I ſhould
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0190703300:30"/>have applied to you for ſuch parts of your official letters (and of your private ones, if you had choſen to give them) as contained any inſtructions or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections either to Mr. Monroe, or to Mr. Morris, or to any other perſon reſpecting me; for, after you were informed of my impriſonment in France, it was incumbent on you to have made ſome enquiry into the cauſe, as you might very well conclude, that I had not the opportunity of informing you of it. I cannot underſtand your ſilence upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject upon any other ground, than as connivance at my impriſonment; and this is the manner it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood here, and will be underſtood in America, unleſs you can give me authority for contradicting it. I therefore write you this letter, to propoſe to you to ſend me copies of any letters you have written, that may remove that ſuſpicion. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face to the ſecond part of the Age of Reaſon, I have given a memorandum from the hand writing of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beſpierre, in which he propoſed decree of accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt me, <hi>"for the intereſt of America as well as of France."</hi> He could have no cauſe for putting America into the caſe, but by interpreting the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the American government into connivance and conſent. I was impriſoned on the ground of being born in England; and your ſilence in not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring into the cauſe of that impriſonment and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming me againſt it, was tacitly giving me up.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0190703300:31"/>I ought not to have ſuſpected you of treachery; but whether I recover from the illneſs I now ſuffer or not, I ſhall continue to think you treacherous, till you give me cauſe to think otherwiſe. I am ſure you would have found yourſelf more at your eaſe had you acted by me as you ought; for, whether your deſertion of me was intended to gratify the Engliſh government, or to let me fall into deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in France, that you might exclaim the louden againſt the French revolution, or whether you hoped by my extinction to meet with leſs oppoſition in mounting up the American government,—either of theſe will involve you in reproach you will not eaſily ſhake off.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0190703300:32"/>The dangers to which I have been expoſed cannot have been unknown to you, and the guarded ſilence you have obſerved upon that circumſtance is what I ought not to have expected from you, either as a friend or as Preſident of the United States.</p>
                  <p>You know enough of my character to be aſſured, that I could not have deſerved impriſonment in France, and without knowing any thing more than this, you had ſufficient ground to have taken ſome intereſt for my ſafety. Every motive ariſing from recollection of times paſt, ought to have ſuggeſted to you the propriety of ſuch a meaſure. But I cannot find that you have ſo much as directed any enquiry to be made, whether I was in priſon or at liberty, dead or alive; what the cauſe of that impriſonment was, or whether there was any ſervice or aſſiſtance you could render. Is this what I ought to have expected from America after the part I have acted towards her, or will it redound to her honour or to yours, that I tell the ſtory. I do not heſitate to ſay, that you have not ſerved America with more diſintereſtedneſs nor greater zeal, nor more fidelity, than myſelf, and I know not if with better effect. After the revolution of America was eſtabliſhed I ventured into new ſcenes of difficulties to extend the principles which that revolution had produced, and you reſted at home to partake of the advantages. In the progeſs of events you beheld yourſelf a Preſident in Ameaica
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0190703300:33"/>and me a priſoner in France. You folded your arms, forgot your friend, and became ſilent.</p>
                  <p>As every thing I have been doing in Europe was connected with my wiſhes for the proſperity of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, I ought to be the more ſurpriſed at this conduct on the part of her government. It leaves me but one mode of explanation, which is, <hi>that every thing is not as it ought to be amongſt you,</hi> and that the preſence of a man who might diſapprove, and who had credit enough with the Country to be heard and believed, was not wiſhed for. This was the operating motive with the deſpotic faction that impriſoned me in France (tho' the pretence was, that I was a foreigner) and thoſe that have been ſilent and inactive towards me in America, appear to me to have acted from the ſame motive, of wiſhing me out of the way. It is impoſſible for me to diſcover any other.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering the part I have acted in the revolution of America it is natural that I feel intereſted in whatever relates to her character and proſperity. Though I am not on the ſpot, to ſee what is immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately acting there, I ſee ſome part of what ſhe is acting in Europe. For your own ſake, as well as for that of America, I was both ſurpriſed and concerr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the appointment of Gouverneur Morris to be miniſter to France. His conduct has proved that the opinion I had formed of that appointment was well founded. I wrote that opinion to Mr. Jefferſon
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0190703300:34"/>at the time, and I was frank enough to ſay the ſame thing to Morris—<hi>that it was an unfortunate appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> His prating, inſignificant pompoſity, rendered him at once offenſive, ſuſpected, and ridiculous; and his total neglect of all buſineſs had ſo diſguſted the Americans, that they propoſed entering a proteſt againſt him. He carried this neglect to ſuch an extreme, that it was neceſſary to inform him of it, and I aſked him one day if he did not feel himſelf aſhamed to take the money of the country and do nothing for it. But Morris is ſo fond of profit and voluptuouſneſs that he cares nothing about character. Had he not been removed at the time he was, I think his conduct would have precipitated the two coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries into a rupture; and in this caſe, hated <hi>ſyſtemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally,</hi> as America is and ever will be by the Britiſh government, and ſuſpected by France, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of America would have fallen a prey to both countries.</p>
                  <p>If the inconſiſtent conduct of Morris expoſed the intereſt of America to ſome hazard in France, the puſillanimous conduct of Mr. Jay in England has rendered the character of the American government contemptible in Europe. Is it poſſible that any man who has contributed to the independence of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, and to free her from the tyranny and injuſtice of the Britiſh government, can read, without ſhame and indignation, the note of Jay to Grenville.
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0190703300:35"/>It is a ſatire upon the declaration of Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and an encouragement to the Britiſh government to treat America with contempt. At the time this miniſter of petitions was acting this miſerable part, he had every means in his hands to enable him to have done his buſineſs as he ought. The ſucceſs or failure of his miſſion depended upon the ſucceſs or failure of the French arms. Had France failed, Mr. Jay might have put his humble petition in his pocket and gone home. The caſe happened to be otherwiſe, and he has ſacrificed the honour and perhaps all the advantages of it, by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing petitioner. I take it for granted, that he was ſent to demand indemnification for the captured property; and in this caſe, if he thought he wanted a preamble to his demand, he might have ſaid: <q>That tho' the government of England might ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe itſelf under the neceſſity of ſeizing American property bound to France, yet that ſuppoſed ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity could not preclude indemnification to the proprietors, who, acting under the authority of their own government, were not accountable to any other.</q>—But Mr. Jay ſets out with an implied recognition of the right of the Britiſh government to ſeize and condemn; for he enters his complaint againſt the <hi>irregularity</hi> of the ſeizures and the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, as if they were reprehenſible only by not being <hi>conformable</hi> to the <hi>terms</hi> of the proclamation
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0190703300:36"/>under which they were ſeized. Inſtead of being the Envoy of a government he goes over like a lawyer to demand a new trial. I can hardly help believing, that Grenville wrote the note himſelf and Jay ſigned it, for the ſtile of it is domeſtic and not diplomatic. The term, <hi>His</hi> Majeſty, uſed without any deſcriptive epithet, always ſignifies the king whom the Miniſter that ſpeaks repreſents. If this ſinking of the demand into a petition was a jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle between Grenville and Jay, to cover the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnification, I think it will end in another juggle, that of never paying the money, and be made uſe of afterwards to preclude the right of demanding it; for Mr. Jay has virtually diſowned the right, <hi>by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing to the magnanimity of his Majeſty againſt the capturers.</hi> He has appointed this magnanimous Majeſty to be umpire in the caſe, and the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the United States muſt abide by the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. If, Sir, I turn ſome part of this affair into ridicule, it is to avoid the unpleaſant ſenſation of ſerious indignation.</p>
                  <p>Among other things, which I confeſs I do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, is the proclamation of neutrality. This has always appeared to me as an aſſumption on the part of the executive not warranted by the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But paſſing this over, as a diſputable caſe, and conſidering it only as political, the conſequence has been that of ſuſtaining the loſſes of war without the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0190703300:37"/>balance of repriſals. When the profeſſion of neutrali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on the part of America was anſwered by hoſtilities on the part of Britain, the object and intention of that neutrality exiſted no longer, and to maintain it after this was not only to encourage further inſults and depredations, but was an informal breach of neutrality towards France, by paſſively contributing to the aid of her enemy. That the government of England conſidered the American government as puſillanimous is evident from the encreaſing inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the former towards the latter, till the affair of General Wayne. She then ſaw it might be poſſible to kick a government into ſome degree of ſpirit. So far as the proclamation of neutrality was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to prevent a diſſolute ſpirit of privateering in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica under foreign colours, it was undoubtedly lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but to continue it as a government neutrality, after the commerce of the country was made war upon, was ſubmiſſion and not neutrality. I have heard ſo much about this thing called neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that I know not if the ungenerous and diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable ſilence (for I muſt call it ſuch) that has been obſerved by your part of the government towards me, during my impriſonment, has not in ſome meaſure ariſen from that policy.</p>
                  <p>Tho' I have written you this letter, you ought not to ſuppoſe it has been an agreeable undertaking to me. On the contrary, I aſſure you, it has coſt me
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0190703300:38"/>ſome diſquietude. I am ſorry you have given me cauſe to do it; for as I have always remembered your former friendſhip with pleaſure, I ſuffer a loſs by your depriving me of that ſentiment.</p>

            <p>That this letter was not written in very good tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is very evident; but it was juſt ſuch a letter as his conduct appeared to me to merit, and every thing on his part ſince has ſerved to confirm that opinion. Had I wanted a commentary on his ſilence with reſpect to my impriſonment in France, ſome of his faction has furniſhed me with it. What I here allude to is a publication in a Philadelphia paper, copied afterwards into a New York paper, both under the patronage of the Waſhington faction, in which the writer, ſtill ſuppoſing me in priſon in France, wonders at my lengthy reſpite from the ſcaffold; and he marks his politics ſtill further by ſaying: <q>It appears moreover, that the people of England did not reliſh his (Thomas Paine's) opinions quite ſo well as he expected, and that for one of his laſt pieces, as deſtructive to the peace and happineſs of their country, (meaning, I ſuppoſe, the <hi>Rights of Man)</hi> they threatened our knight-errant with ſuch ſerious vengeance, that, to avoid a trip to Botany-bay, he fled over to France, as a leſs dangerous voyage.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0190703300:39"/>I am not refuting or contradicting the falſhood of this publication, for it is ſufficiently notorious; neither am I cenſuring the writer; on the contrary I think him for the explanation he has incautiouſly given of the principles of the Waſhington faction. Inſignificant, however, as the piece is, it was capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of having had ſome ill effect, had it arrived in France during my impriſonment and in the time of Robeſpierre; and I am not uncharitable in ſuppoſing that this was the intention of the writer. <note n="*" place="bottom">I know not who the writer of the piece is; but ſome late Americans ſay it is Phineas Bond, an American refugee, and now a Britiſh Conſul; and that he writes under the ſignature of Peter Skunk, or Peter Porcupine, or ſome ſuch ſignature.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I have now done with Mr. Waſhington on the ſcore of private affairs. It would have been far more agreeable to me, had his conduct been ſuch as not to have merited theſe reproaches. Errors or caprices of the temper can be pardoned and forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; but a cold deliberate crime of the heart, ſuch as Mr. Waſhington is capable of acting, is not to be waſhed away. I now proceed to other matter.</p>
            <p>After Jay's note to Grenville arrived in Paris from America, the character of every thing that was to follow might be eaſily foreſeen; and it was upon this anticipation that my letter of February 22d was founded. The event has proved, that I was not miſtaken, except that it has been much worſe than I expected.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0190703300:40"/>It would naturally occur to Mr. Waſhington, that the ſecrecy of Jay's miſſion to England, where there was already an American miniſter, could not but create ſome ſuſpicion in the French government; eſpecially as the conduct of Morris had been noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and the intimacy of Mr. Waſhington with Morris was known.</p>
            <p>The character which Mr. Waſhington has at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to act in the world, is a ſort of non-deſcriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, cameleon-coloured thing, called <hi>prudence.</hi> It is, in many caſes, a ſubſtitute for principle, and is ſo nearly allied to hypocriſy, that it eaſily ſlides into it. His genius for prudence furniſhed him in this inſtance with an expedient, that ſerved, as is the natural and general character of all expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients, to diminiſh the embarraſſments of the moment and multiply them afterwards; for he authoriſed it to be made known to the French go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as a confidential matter (Mr. Waſhington ſhould recollect that I was a member of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, &amp; had the means of knowing what I here ſtate) he authorized it, I ſay, to be made known, and that for the purpoſe of preventing any uneaſineſs to France on the ſcore of Mr. Jay's miſſion to England, that the object of that miſſion, and of Mr. Jay's authority, was reſtricted to that of demanding the ſurrender of the weſtern poſts and indemnification for the cargoes captured in American veſſels. Mr. Waſhington knows
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0190703300:41"/>that this was untrue; and knowing this, he had good reaſon to himſelf for refuſing to furniſh the Houſe of Repreſentatives with copies of the inſtructions given to Jay; as the might ſuſpect, among other things, that he ſhould alſo be called upon for copies of inſtructions given to other miniſters, and that in the contradiction of inſtructions his want of integrity would be detected. Mr. Waſhington may now, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, learns, when it is too late, to be of any uſe to him, that a man will paſs better through the world with a thouſand open errors upon his bank, than in being detected in ONE ſly falſhood. When one is detected, a thouſand are ſuſpected.</p>
            <p>The firſt account that arrived in Paris of a treaty being negociated by Mr. Jay (for nobody ſuſpected any) came in an Engliſh newſpaper, which announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced that a treaty <hi>offenſive</hi> and <hi>defenſive</hi> had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded between the United States of America and England. This was immediately denied by every American in Paris, as an impoſſible thing; and though it was diſbelieved by the French, it imprinted a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion that ſome underhand buſineſs was going for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. <note n="*" place="bottom">It was the embarraſſment into which the affairs and credit of America were thrown at this inſtant by the report above alluded to, that made it neceſſary to contradict it, and that by every means, ariſing from opinion or founded upon authority. The Committee of Public Safety, exiſting at that time, had agreed to the full execution, on their part, of the treats between America and France, notwithſtanding ſome equivocal conduction the part of the American government, not very conſiſtent with the good <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

That Jay had no inſtructions beyond the points above ſtated, or none that could poſſibly be conſtrued to extend to the length the British treat goes, was a matter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in America, in England and in France; and without go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any other forecaſt followed naturally from the meſſage of the Preſident to Congreſs, when he nominated Jay upon that miſſion.

            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="tcp:0190703300:42"/>It is curious to obſerve how the appearances of character will change, whilſt the root that produces them remains the ſame. The Waſhington adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration having waded through the ſlough of negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and whilſt it amuſed France with profeſſions of friendſhip contrived to injure her, immediately throws off the hypocrite, and aſſumes the ſwagger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing air of a bravado. The party papers of that imbecile adminiſtration were on this occaſion filled with paragraphs about <hi>Sovereignty.</hi> A paltroon may boaſt of his ſovereign right to let another kick him, and this is the only kind of ſovereignty ſhewn in the treaty with England. But theſe daſhing paragraphs, as Timothy Pickering well knows, were intended for France; without whoſe aſſiſtance in men, money and
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0190703300:43"/>ſhips, Mr. Waſhington would have cut but a poor figure in the American war. But of his military ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents I ſhall ſpeak hereafter.</p>
            <p>I mean not to enter into any diſcuſſion of any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of Jay's treaty: I ſhall ſpeak only upon the whole of it. It is attempted to be juſtified on the ground of its not being a violation of any article or articles of the treaty pre-exiſting with France. But the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign right of explanation does not lie with George Waſhington and his man Timothy; France, on her part, has, at leaſt, an equal right; and when nations diſpute, it is not ſo much about words as about things.</p>
            <p>A man, ſuch as the world calls, a ſharper, and verſed, as Jay muſt be ſuppoſed to be, in the quibbles of the law, may find a way to enter into engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and make bargains in ſuch a manner as to cheat ſome other party, without that party being able, as the phraſe is, <hi>to take the law of him.</hi> This often happens in the cabaliſtical circle of what is called law. But when this is attempted to be acted on the national ſcale of treaties, it is too deſpicable to be defended, or to be permitted to exiſt. Yet this is the trick upon which Jay's treaty is founded, ſo far as it has relation to the treaty pre-exiſting with France. It is a counter-treaty to that treaty, and perverts all the great articles of that treaty to the injury of France, and makes them operate as a bounty to England with whom France is at war.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0190703300:44"/>The Waſhington adminiſtration ſhews great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that the treaty between France and the United States be preſerved. Nobody can doubt their ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity upon this matter. There is not a Britiſh miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, a Britiſh merchant, or a Britiſh agent or ſailor in America, that does not anxiouſly wiſh the ſame thing. The treaty with France ſerves now as a paſſport to ſupply England with naval ſtores and other articles of American produce, whilſt the ſame articles, when coming to France, are made contraband or ſeizable by Jay's treaty with England. The treaty with France ſays, that neutral ſhips make neutral pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty on board American ſhips; and Jay's treaty delivers up French property on board American ſhips to be ſeized by the Engliſh. It is too paltry to talk of faith, of national honour, and of the preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of treaties, whilſt ſuch a bare-faced treachery as this ſtares the world in the face.</p>
            <p>The Waſhington adminiſtration may ſave itſelf the trouble of proving to the French government its <hi>moſt faithful</hi> intentions of preſerving the treaty with France; for France has now no deſire chat it ſhould be preſerved. She had nominated an Envoy extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary to America, to make Mr. Waſhington and his government a preſent of the treaty, and to have no more to do with <hi>that</hi> or with <hi>him.</hi> It was, at the ſame time, officially declared to the American mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0190703300:45"/>at Paris, <hi>that the French Republic had rather have the American government for an open enemy than a treacherous friend.</hi> This, ſir, together with the internal diſtractions cauſed in America, and the loſe of character in the world, is the <hi>eventful criſis,</hi> alluded to in the beginning of this letter, to which your double politics have brought the affairs of your country. It is time that the eyes of America be opened upon you.</p>
            <p>How France would have conducted herſelf to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards America and American commerce after all treaty ſtipulations had ceaſed, and under the ſenſe of ſervices rendered and injuries received, I know not. It is, however, an unpleaſant reflection, that in all national quarrels, the innocent, and even the friendly, part of the community, become involved with the culpable and the unfriendly; and as the accounts that arrived from America continued to manifeſt an invariable attachment in the general maſs of the people to their original ally, in oppoſition to the new-fangled Waſhington faction,—the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions that had been taken were ſuſpended. It happened alſo fortunately enough, that Gouverneur Morris was not miniſter at this time.</p>
            <p>There is, however, one point that yet remains in embryo, and which, among other things, ſerves to ſhew the ignorance of the Waſhington treaty-mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and their inattention to pre-exiſting treaties
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0190703300:46"/>when they were employing themſelves in framing of ratifying the new treaty with England.</p>
            <p>The ſecond article of the treaty of commerce between the United States and France ſays: <q>The moſt chriſtian king and the United States engage mutually, not to grant any particular favour to other nations in reſpect of commerce and naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ſhall not immediately become common to the other party, who ſhall enjoy the ſame fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour freely, if the conceſſion was freely made, or on allowing the ſame compenſation if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion was conditional.</q>
            </p>
            <p>All the conceſſions therefore made to England by Jay's treaty are, through the medium of this ſecond article in the pre-exiſting treaty, made to France, and become engrafted into the treaty with France, and can be exerciſed by her as a matter of right, the ſame as by England.</p>
            <p>Jay's treaty makes a conceſſion to England, and that unconditionally, of ſeizing naval ſtores in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican ſhips and condemning them as contraband. It makes alſo a conceſſion to England to ſeize pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and <hi>other articles</hi> in American ſhips. <hi>Other articles</hi> are <hi>all other articles,</hi> and none but an ignoramus, or ſomething worſe, would have put ſuch a phraſe into a treaty. The condition annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this caſe is, that the proviſions and other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles ſo ſeized are to be paid for at a price to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0190703300:47"/>upon. Mr. Waſhington, as Preſident, ratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this treaty after he knew the Britiſh government had recommenced an indiſcriminate ſeizure of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions and of all other articles in American ſhips; and it is now known that thoſe ſeizures were made to fit out the expedition going to Quiberon Bay, and it was known, before hand that they would be made. The evidence goes, alſo, a good way to prove that Jay and Grenville underſtood each other upon that ſubject. Mr. Pinckney, when he paſſed through France on his way to Spain, ſpoke of the recommencement of the ſeizures as a thing that would take place. The French government had by ſome means received information from London to the ſame purpoſe, with the addition, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commencement of the ſeizures would cauſe no miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtanding between the Britiſh and American governments. Grenville, in defending himſelf a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the oppoſition in Parliament on account of the ſcarcity of corn, ſaid (ſee his ſpeech at the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Parliament that met Oct. 29th 1795) that <hi>the ſupplies for the Quiberon expedition were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed out of the American ſhips;</hi> and all the accounts received at that time from England ſtated, that thoſe ſeizures were made under the treaty. After the ſupplies for the Quiberon expedition had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured and the expected ſucceſs had failed, the ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ures were counter manded; and, had the French
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0190703300:48"/>ſeized proviſion veſſels going to England, it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that the Quiberon expedition could not have been attempted.</p>
            <p>In one point of view, the treaty with England o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates as a loan to the Engliſh government. It gives permiſſion to that government to take Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can can property at ſea to any amount and pay for it when it ſuits her; and besides this, the treaty is in every point of view a ſurrender of the rights of American commerce and navigation, and a refuſal to France of the rights of neutrality. The Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can flag is not now a neutral flag to France: Jay's treaty of ſurrender gives a monopoly of it to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>On the contrary, the treaty of commerce be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween America and France was formed on the moſt liberal principles, and calculated to give the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt encouragement to the infant commerce of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. France was neither a carrier nor an exporter of naval ſtores or of proviſions. Thoſe articles be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed wholly to America, and they had all the protection in that treaty which a treaty could give. But ſo much has that treaty been perverted, that the liberality of it, on the part of France, has ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to encourage Jay to form a counter-treaty with England; for the muſt have ſuppoſed the hands of France tied up by her treaty with America, when he was making ſuch large conceſſions in favour of
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0190703300:49"/>England. The injury which Mr. Waſhington's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration has done to the character as well as to the commerce of America is too great to be repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him. Foreign nations will be ſhy of making treaties with a government that has given the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs example of perverting the liberality of a former treaty to the injury of the party with whom it was made.</p>
            <p>In what a fraudulent light muſt Mr. Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's character appear in the world, when his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and his conduct are compared together! Here follows the letter he wrote to the Committee of Public Safety whilſt Jay was negociating in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſecrecy this treacherous treaty.</p>

            <p>Was it by entering into a treaty with England, to ſurrender French property on board American ſhips to be ſeized by the Engliſh, whilſt Engliſh property on board American ſhips was declared by the French treaty not to be ſeizable, <hi>that the bonds of friendſhip between America and France were to be drawn the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer?</hi> Was it by declaring naval ſtores contraband
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0190703300:51"/>when coming to France, when by the French treaty they were not contraband when going to England, that the <hi>connection between France and America was to be advanced?</hi> Was it by opening the American ports to the Britiſh navy in the preſent war, from which ports that ſame navy had been expelled by the aid ſolicited from France in the American war (and that aid gratuitouſly given) that the gratitude of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca was to be ſhewn, and the <hi>ſolicitude</hi> ſpoken of in the letter demonſtrated?</p>
            <p>As the letter was addreſſed to the Committee of Public Safety, Mr Waſhington did not expect it would get abroad in the world, or be ſeen by any other eye than that of Robeſpierre, or be heard by any other ear than that of the Committee; that it would paſs as a whiſper acroſs the Atlantic, from one dark chamber to the other, and there terminate. It was calculated to remove from the mind of the Committee all ſuſpicion upon Jay's miſſion to England, and, in this point of view, it was ſuited to the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of the moment then paſſing; but as the event of that miſſion has proved the letter to be hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical, it ſerves no other purpoſe of the preſent moment than to ſhew that the writer is not to be credited. Two circumſtances ſerved to make the reading of the letter neceſſary in the Convention. The one was, that thoſe who ſucceeded on the fall of Robeſpierre, found it moſt proper to act with
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0190703300:52"/>publicity; the other, to extinguiſh the ſuſpicions which the ſtrange conduct of Morris had occaſioned in France.</p>
            <p>When the Britiſh treaty, and the ratification of it by Mr. Waſhington, was known in France, all fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declarations from him of his good diſpoſition, as an ally and a friend, paſſed for ſo many cyphers; but ſtill it appeared neceſſary to him to keep up the farce of declarations. It is ſtipulated in the Britiſh treaty, that commiſſioners are to report at the end of two years on the caſe of <hi>neutral ſhips making neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tral property.</hi> In the mean time neutral ſhips do <hi>not</hi> make neutral property, according to the Britiſh treaty, and they do, according to the French treaty. The preſervation, therefore, of the French treaty became of great importance to England, as by that means ſhe can employ American ſhips as carriers, whilſt the ſame advantage is denied to France. whether the French treaty could exiſt as a matter of right after this clandeſtine perverſion of it, could not but give ſome apprehenſions to the partizans of the Britiſh treaty, and it became neceſſary to them to make up, by fine words, what was wanting in good actions.</p>
            <p>An opportunity offered to that purpoſe. The Convention, on the public reception of Mr. Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roe, ordered the American flag and the French flag to be diſplayed unitedly in the hall of the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0190703300:53"/>Mr. Monroe made a preſent of an American flag for the purpoſe. The Convention returned this compliment by ſending a French flag to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, to be preſented by their miniſter, Mr. Adet, to the American government. This reſolution paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed long before Jay's treaty was known or ſuſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it paſſed in the days of confidence; but the flag was not preſented by Mr. Adet till ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral months after the treaty had been ratified. Mr. Waſhington made this the occaſion of ſaying ſome ſine things to the French Miniſter, and the better to get himſelf into tune to do this, he began by ſaying the fineſt things of himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Born, ſir (ſaid he) in a land of liberty; <hi>having</hi> early learned its value; <hi>having</hi> engaged in a peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous conflict to defend it; <hi>having,</hi> in a word, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted the beſt years of my life to ſecure its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent eſtabliſhment in my own country; <hi>my</hi> anxious recollections, <hi>my</hi> ſympathetic feelings, and <hi>my</hi> beſt wiſhes are irreſiſtibly excited, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, in any country, I ſee an oppreſſed people unfurl the banners of freedom.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Waſhington having expended ſo many fine phraſes upon himſelf, was obliged to invent a new one for the French, and he calls them "wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful people!" The coaleſced powers acknowledge as much.</p>
            <p>It is laughable to hear Mr. Waſhington talk of
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0190703300:54"/>his <hi>ſympathetic feelings,</hi> who has always been remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, even among his friends, for not having any. He has, however, given no proof of any to me. As to the pompous encomiums he ſo liberally pays to himſelf, on the ſcore of the American revolution, the reality of them may be queſtioned; and ſince he has forced them ſo much into notice, it is fair to examine his pretenſions.</p>
            <p>A ſtranger might be led to ſuppoſe from the egotiſm with which Mr. Waſhington ſpeaks, that himſelf, and himſelf only, had generated, conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, compleated, and eſtabliſhed the revolution: In fine, that it was all his own doing.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place, as to the political part, he had no ſhare in it; and therefore the whole of <hi>that</hi> is out of the queſtion with reſpect to him. There remains then only the military part, and it would have been prudent in Mr. Waſhington not to have awakened enquiry upon that ſubject. Fame then was cheap; he enjoyed it cheaply; and nobody was diſpoſed to take away the laurels, that, whether they were <hi>acquired</hi> or not, had been <hi>given.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Waſhington's merit conſiſted in conſtancy. But conſtancy was the common virtue of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Who was there that was inconſtant? I know of but one military defection, that of Arnold; and I know of no political defection, among thoſe who made themſelves <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, when the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0190703300:55"/>was formed by the declaration of independence. Even Silas Deane, though he attempted to defraud, did not betray.</p>
            <p>But when we ſpeak of military character, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more is to be underſtood than conſtancy; and ſomething more <hi>ought</hi> to be underſtood than the Fabian ſyſtem of <hi>doing nothing.</hi> The <hi>nothing</hi> part can be done by any body. Old Mrs. Thompſon, the houſe-keeper of head-quarters (who threatened to make the ſun and the <hi>wind</hi> ſhine through Riving-ton of New-York) could have done it as well as Mr. Waſhington. Deborah would have been as good as Barak.</p>
            <p>Mr. Waſhington had the nominal rank of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in Chief; but he was not ſo fact. He had in reality only a ſeparate command. He had no controul over, or direction of, the army to the northward, under Gates, that captured Burgoyne; nor of that to the ſouth, under Green, that recovered the ſouthern States. The nominal rank, however, of Commander in chief, ſerved to throw upon him the luſtre of thoſe actions, and to make him appear as the ſoul and centre of all the military operations in America.</p>
            <p>He commenced his command June 1775, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time the Maſſachuſetts army lay before Boſton, and after the affair of Bunker-hill. The commencement of his command was the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0190703300:56"/>of inactivity. Nothing was afterwards done, or attempted to be done, during the nine months he remained before Boſton. If we may judge from the reſiſtance made at Concord and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards at Bunker-hill, there was a ſpirit of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe at that time, which the preſence of Mr. Waſhington chilled into cold defence. By the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of a good exterior, he attracts reſpect, which his habitual ſilence tends to preſerve; but he has not the talent of inſpiring ardour in an army. The enemy removed from Boſton in March 1776, to wait for reinforcements from Europe, and to take a more advantageous poſition at New York.</p>
            <p>The inactivity of the campaign of 1775 on the part of General Waſhington, when the enemy had a leſs force than in any future period of the war, and the injudicious choice of poſitions taken by him in the campaign of 1776, when the enemy had its greateſt force, neceſſarily produced the loſſes and misfortunes that marked that gloomy campaign. The poſitions taken were either iſlands or necks of land. In the former, the enemy, by the aid of their ſhips could bring their whole force againſt a part of Gen. Waſhington's, as in the affair of Long-Iſland, and in the latter he might be ſhut up as in the bottom of a bag. This had nearly been the caſe at New York, and it was ſo in part; it was actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the caſe at Fort Waſhington; and would have
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0190703300:57"/>been the caſe at Fort Lee if Gen. Greene had not moved precipitately off, leaving every thing behind, and by gaining Hackinſach bridge, got out of the bag of Bergen neck. How far Mr. Waſhington, as a General, is blameable for theſe matters, I am not undertaking to determine, but they are evidently defects in military geography. The ſucceſsful ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes at the cloſe of that campaign (matters that would ſcarcely be noticed in a better ſtate of things) make the brilliant exploits of Gen. Waſhington's ſeven campaigns.—No wonder we ſee ſo much pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſillanimity in the <hi>Preſident</hi> when we ſee ſo little en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe in the <hi>General.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The campaign of 1777 became famous, not by any thing on the part of Gen. Waſhington, but by the capture of Gen. Burgoyne and the army under his command, by the Northern army at Saratoga under Gen. Gates. So totally diſtinct and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected were the two armies of Waſhington and Gates, and ſo independent was the latter of the authority of the nominal Commander in Chief, that the two Generals did not ſo much as correſpond, and it was only by a letter of Gen. (ſince Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor) Clinton, that General Waſhington was inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of that event. The Britiſh took poſſeſſion of Philadelphia this year, which they evacuated the next, juſt time enough to ſave their heavy baggage and ſleet of tranſports from capture by the French
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0190703300:58"/>Admiral d'Eſtaing, who arrived at the mouth of the Delaware ſoon after.</p>
            <p>The capture of Burgoyne gave an eclat in Europe to the American arms, and facilitated the alliance with France. The eclat, however, was not kept up by any thing on the part of Gen. Waſhington. The ſame unfortunate langour that marked his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the field continued always. Diſcontents began to prevail ſtrongly againſt him, and a party was formed in Congreſs, whilſt ſitting at York-Town, in Pennſylvania, for removing him from the command of the army. The hope, however, of better times, the news of the alliance with France, and the unwillingneſs of ſhewing diſcontent, diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated the matter.</p>
            <p>Nothing was done in the campaigns of 1778, 1779, 1780, in the part where Gen. Waſhington commanded, except the taking Stony Point by Gen. Wayne. The Southern States in the mean time were over-run by the enemy. They were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards recovered by Gen. Greene, who had in a very great meaſure created the army that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed that recovery. In all this Gen. Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton had not ſhare. The Fabian ſyſtem of war, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by him, began now to unfold itſelf with all its evils, for what is Fabian war without Fabian means to ſupport it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0190703300:59"/>The finances of congreſs, depending wholly on emiſſions of paper money, were exhauſted. Its credit was gone. The continental treaſury was not able to pay the expence of a brigade of waggons to tranſport the neceſſary ſtores to the army, and yet the ſole object, the eſtabliſhment of the revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was a thing of remote diſtance. The time I am now ſpeaking of is the latter end of the year 1780.</p>
            <p>In this ſituation of things it was found not only expedient but abſolutely neceſſary for Congreſs to ſtate the whole caſe to its ally. I knew more of this matter (before it came into Congreſs or was known to General Waſhington) of its progreſs, and its iſſue, than I chuſe to ſtate in this letter. Col. John Laurens was ſent to France as Envoy Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary on this occaſion, and by a private agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between him and me I accompanied him. We ſailed from Boſton in the Alliance frigate, Feb. 11th, 1781. France had already done much in accepting and paying bills drawn by Congreſs. She was now called upon to do more. The event of Col. Laurens's miſſion, with the aid of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable miniſter, Franklin, was, that France gave in money, as a preſent, ſix millions of livres, and ten millions more as a loan, and agreed to ſend a fleet of not leſs than thirty ſail of the line, at her own expence, as an aid to America. Col. Laurens
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0190703300:60"/>and myſelf returned from Breſt the 1ſt of June following, taking with us two millions and an half of livres (upwards of one hundred thouſand pounds ſterling) of the money given, and convoying two ſhips with ſtores.</p>
            <p>We arrived at Boſton the 25th Auguſt following. De Graſſe arrived with the French fleet in the Cheſapeak at the ſame time, and was afterwards joined by that of Barras, making 31 ſail of the line. The money was tranſported in waggons from Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton to the Bank at Philadelphia, of which Mr. Thomas Willing, who has ſince put himſelf at the head of the liſt of petitioners in favour of the Britiſh treaty, was then Preſident, and it was by the aid of this money, and of this fleet, and of Rocham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beau's army, that Cornwallis was taken; the law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of which have been unjuſtly given to Mr. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington. His merit in that affair was no more than that of any other American officer.</p>
            <p>I have had, and ſtill have, as much pride in the American revolution as any man, or as Mr. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington has a right to have; but that pride has never made me forgetful from whence the great aid came that compleated the buſineſs. Foreign aid (that of France) was calculated upon at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the revolution. It is one of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects treated of in the pamphlet <hi>Common Senſe,</hi> but
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0190703300:61"/>as a matter that could not be hoped for, unleſs In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence was declared.</p>
            <p>It is as well the ingratitude as the puſillanimity of Mr. Waſhington and the Waſhington faction, that has brought upon America the loſs of character ſhe now ſuffers in the world, and the numerous evils her commerce has undergone, and to which it is yet expoſed. The Britiſh miniſtry ſoon found out what ſort of men they had to deal with, and they dealt with them accordingly; and if further explanation was wanting, it has been fully given ſince in the ſnivelling addreſs of the New-York Chamber of Commerce to the Preſident, and in that of ſundry merchants of Philadelphia, which was not much better.</p>
            <p>When the revolution of America was finally eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed by the termination of the war, the world gave her credit for great character; and ſhe had nothing to do but to ſtand firm upon that ground. The Britiſh miniſtry had their hands too full of trouble to have provoked unneceſſarily a rupture with her, had ſhe ſhewn a proper reſolution to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend her rights. But encouraged as they were by the ſubmiſſive character of her executive adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, they proceeded from inſult to inſult till none more were left to be offered. The propoſals made by Sweden and Denmark to the American
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0190703300:62"/>adminiſtration were diſregarded. I know not if ſo much as an anſwer has been returned to them. The miniſter <hi>penitentiary</hi> (as ſome of the Britiſh prints called him) Mr. Jay, was ſent on a pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to London, to make all up by penance and petition. In the mean time the lengthy and drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy writer of the pieces ſigned <hi>Camillus</hi> held himſelf in reſerve to vindicate every thing; and to ſound, in America, the tocſin of terror upon the inexhauſtible reſources of England. Her reſources, ſays he, are greater than thoſe of all the other powers. This man is ſo intoxicated with fear and finance that he knows not the difference between <hi>plus</hi> and <hi>minus</hi>—between an hundred pounds in hand, and an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds worſe than nothing.</p>
            <p>The commerce of America, ſo far as it had been eſtabliſhed by all the treaties that had been formed prior to that by Jay, was free, and the principles upon which it was eſtabliſhed were good. That ground ought never to have been departed from. It was the juſtifiable ground of right, and no tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary difficulties ought to have induced an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donment of it. The caſe now is otherwiſe. The ground, the ſcene, the pretenſions, the every thing, are changed. The commerce of America is, by Jay's treaty, put under foreign dominion. The ſea is not free for her. Her right to navigate it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0190703300:63"/>to the right of eſcaping; that is, until ſome ſhip of England or France, ſtops her veſſels and carries them into port. Every article of American produce, whether from the ſea or the land, fiſh, fleſh, vegetable, or manufacture, is, by Jay's trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, made either contraband or ſeizable. Nothing is exempt. In all other treaties of commerce the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle which enumerates the contraband articles, ſuch as fire arms, gun powder, &amp;c. is followed by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther article which enumerates the articles not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traband: but it is not ſo in Jay's treaty. There is no exempting article. Its place is ſupplied by the article for ſeizing and carrying into port; and the ſweeping phraſe of "proviſions and <hi>other articles,</hi>" includes every thing. There never was ſuch a baſe and ſervile treaty of ſurrender ſince treaties began to exiſt.</p>
            <p>This is the ground upon which America now ſtands. All her rights of commerce and navigation have to commence anew, and that with loſs of character to begin with. If there is ſenſe enough left in the heart to call a bluſh into the cheek, the Waſhington adminiſtration muſt be aſhamed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.—And as to you, ſir, treacherous in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate friendſhip (for ſo you have been to me, and that in the day of danger) and a hypocrite in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic life, the world will be puzzled to decide, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0190703300:64"/>you are an apoſtate or an impoſtor; whether you have abandoned good principles, or whether you ever had any?</p>

               <p>I Addreſs this Memorial to you in conſequence of a letter I received from a friend, 18 Fructidor, (Sept. 4th) in which he ſays: <q>Mr. Monroe has told me that he has no orders (meaning from the American government) reſpecting you, but I am ſure he will leave nothing undone to libcrate you; but, from what I learn from all the late Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans, you are not conſidered, either by the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment or by the individuals, as an American ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen. You have been made a French citizen, which you have accepted, and you have further made yourſelf a ſervant of the French Republic, and it would be out of character for an Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can miniſter to interfere in their internal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns.
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0190703300:66"/>You muſt, therefore, either be liberated out of compliment to America, or ſtand your trial, which you have a right to demand.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This information was ſo unexpected by me, that I am at a loſs how to anſwer it. I know not on what principle it originates; whether from an idea that I had voluntarily abandoned my citizenſhip of America for that of France, or from any article in the American conſtitution applied to me. The firſt is untrue with reſpect to any intention on my part; and the ſecond is without foundation, as I ſhall ſhew in the courſe of this memorial.</p>
               <p>The idea of conferring the honor of citizenſhip upon foreigners who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves in propagating the principles of liberty and humanity, in oppoſition to deſpotiſm, war and bloodſhed, was firſt propoſed by me to La Fayette, at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the French revolution, when his heart appeared to be warmed with thoſe principles. My motive in making this propoſal was to render the people of different nations more fraternal than they had been or then were. I obſerved that almoſt every branch of ſcience had poſſeſſed itſelf of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this right, ſo far as regarded its own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. Moſt of the academies and ſocieties in Europe conferred the rank of honorary member upon foreigners eminent in knowlege, and made them members of their literary or ſcientific republic,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0190703300:67"/>without affecting or any ways diminiſhing their rights of citizenſhip in their own country, or in other ſocieties; and why the ſcience of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould not have the ſame advantage, or why the people of one nation ſhould not, by their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, exerciſe the right of conferring the honor of citizenſhip upon individuals eminent in another nation, without affecting <hi>their</hi> rights of citizenſhip in their proper country, is a problem yet to be ſolved.</p>
               <p>I now proceed to remark on that part of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in which the writer ſays, that <q>from all be can learn from the late Americans, I am not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, in America, either by the government or by the individuals, as an American citizen.</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the firſt place I wiſh to aſk, what is here meant by the government of America? The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who compoſe the government are only indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals when in converſation, and who muſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly hold very different opinions upon the ſubject. Have Congreſs as a body made any declaration re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting me, that they no longer conſider me as a citizen? If they have not, any thing they may other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſay is no more than the opinion of individuals, and conſequently is not legal authority, nor any wiſe authority to deprive any man of his citizen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Beſides, whether a man has forfeited his rights of citizenſhip is a queſtion not determinable
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0190703300:68"/>by Congreſs, but by a Court of Judicature and a Jury, and muſt depend upon evidence and the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of ſome law or article of the conſtitution to the caſe. No ſuch proceeding has yet been had, and conſequently I remain a citizen until it be had, be that determination what it may; for there can be no ſuch thing as a ſuſpenſion of rights in he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terim.</p>
               <p>I am aware of the article of the conſtitution which ſays, as nearly as I can recollect, that any citizen of the United States who ſhall accept any title, place, or office, from any foreign king, prince or ſtate, ſhall forfeit and loſe his right of citizen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the United States.<note n="*" place="bottom">Even this article does act exiſt in the manner <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ere stated.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Had the article ſaid that <hi>any citizen of the United States, who ſhall be member of any foreign convention for the purpoſe of forming a free conſtitution, ſhall forfeit and loſe the right of citizenſhip of the United States,</hi> he article had been directly applicable to me; but the idea of ſuch an article never could have enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the mind of the American Convention, and the preſent article is altogether foreign to the caſe with reſpect to me; for it ſuppoſes a government in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual exiſtence, and not a government diſſolved; and it ſuppoſes a citizen of America accepting titles
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0190703300:69"/>and offices under that government, and not a citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of America who gives his aſſiſtance in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention choſen by the people for the purpose of forming a government <hi>de novo,</hi> founded on their authority.</p>
               <p>The late conſtitution and government of France was diſſolved the 10th of Auguſt, 1972. The National Legiſlative Aſſembly then in being, ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed itſelf without authority to continue its ſittings, and it propoſed to the departments to elect, not another Legiſlative Body, but a Convention for the expreſs purpoſe of forming a conſtitution. When the Aſſembly were diſcourſing on this matter, ſome of the members ſaid, that they wiſhed to gain all the information poſſible upon the ſubject of free conſtitutions, and expreſſed a wiſh to invite foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of any nation to the Convention, who had diſtinguiſhed themſelves in defending, explaining, and propagating the principles of Liberty. It was on this occaſion that my name was mentioned in the Aſſembly. I was then in England. After this a deputation from a body of the French people, in order to remove any objection that might be made againſt my aſſiſting at the propoſed Convention, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the Aſſembly, as their repreſentatives, to confer on me the title of French Citizen; after which I was elected in four different departments, as is already known.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0190703300:70"/>The caſe therefore is, that I accepted nothing from any king, prince, or ſtate, nor from any gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment; for France was then without any gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, except what aroſe from neceſſity and conſent. Neither did I <hi>made myſelf a ſervant of the French Republic,</hi> as the letter already alluded to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes; for France at that time was not a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, not even in name. She was altogether a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a ſtate of revolution.</p>
               <p>It was not until the Convention met, that France was declared a Republic and monarchy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed; ſoon after which a committee was elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of which I was choſen a member, to form a conſtitution, which was preſented to the Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and read by Condorcet (who was alſo a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber) the 15th and 16th of February following; but was not to be taken into conſideration till after the expiration of two months. The diſorders and the revolutionary government that took place after this put a ſtop to any further progreſs upon the caſe.</p>
               <p>In thus employing myſelf upon the formation of a conſtitution, I certainly did nothing inconſiſtent with the American conſtitution. I took no oath of allegiance to France, nor any other oath whatever. I conſidered the citizenſhip they had preſented me with, as an honorary mark of reſpect paid to me, not only as a friend of liberty, but as an American
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0190703300:71"/>citizen. My acceptance of that, or of the deputy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, not conferred on me by any king, prince, or ſtate, but by a people in a ſtate of revolution and contending for liberty, required no transfer of my allegiance or of my citizenſhip from America to France. In America I was a real citizen, paying taxes annually; in France I was a volunteer friend, employing myſelf on a temporary ſervice. Every American in Paris knew that it was my conſtant intention to return to America, as ſoon as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution ſhould be eſtabliſhed in France, and that I anxiouſly waited for that event.</p>
               <p>I ever muſt deny that any article of the American conſtitution can be applied either literally, intention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, or conſtructively againſt me. It undoubtedly was the intention of the convention that framed the conſtitution, to preſerve the purity of the American Republic from being debaſed by foreign and foppiſh cuſtoms; but it could never be its intentions to act againſt the principles of liberty, by forbidding its ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens to aſſiſt in promoting thoſe principles in foreign countries. Neither could it be its intention to act againſt the principles of gratitude: France had aided America in the eſtabliſhment of her revolution, when invaded and oppreſſed by England and her auxilaries. France, in her turn, was invaded and oppreſſed by a combination of foreign deſpots. In this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation I conceived it an act of gratitude in me, as
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0190703300:72"/>a citizen of America, to render her in return the beſt ſervices I could perform. I came to France (for I was in England when I was elected) not to enjoy eaſe, emoluments, or foppiſh honours, as the article ſuppoſes; but to encounter difficulties and dangers in defence of liberty; and I much queſtion whether thoſe who now malignantly ſeek to turn this to my injury (for ſome I believe do) would have had courage to have done the ſame thing. I am ſure Gouv. Morris would not. He told me the ſecond day after my arrival in Paris, that the Auſtrians and Pruſſians, who were then at Verdun, would be in Paris in a fortnight. I have no idea, ſaid he, that ſeventy thouſand diſciplined troops can be ſtopt in their march by any power in France.</p>
               <p>Beſides the reaſons I have already given for ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the invitation to the Convention, I had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother that has reference particularly to America, and which I mentioned to Mr. — the night before I left London to come to Paris; <hi>that it was to the intereſt of America, that the ſyſtem of European go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments ſhould be changed, and placed on the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple with her own.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is certain that governments upon ſimilar princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples agree better together, than thoſe that are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on principles diſcordant with each other; and the ſame rule holds good with reſpect to the people living under them. In the latter caſe they offend each
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0190703300:73"/>other by pity or by reproach, and the diſcordancy carries itſelf into matters of commerce. I am not an ambitious man, but perhaps I have been an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious American. <hi>I have wiſhed to ſee America the mother church of government.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now ſtated ſufficient matter to ſhew, that the article in the conſtitution is not applicable to me, and that any ſuch application of it to my inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as well in circumſtances as in rights, is illegal and unconſtitutional. Neither do I believe that any jury in America, when they are informed of the whole of the caſe, would give a verdict to deprive me of my right upon that article. The citizens of America, I believe, are not very fond of permitting forced and indirect explanations to be put upon matters of this kind. I know not what were the merits of the caſe with reſpect to the perſon who was proſecuted for acting as prize-maſter to a French prize, but I know that the jury gave a verdict a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the proſecution; the rights I have acquired are dear to me; they have been acquired by honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means, and by dangerous ſervice in the worſt of times, and I cannot permit them to be wreſted from me. I conceive it my duty to defend them, as the caſe involves a conſtitutional and public queſtion, which is, how far the power of the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deral government (it ſhould have been ſaid in this
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0190703300:74"/>place the executive) extends in depriving any citizen of his rights of citizenſhip, or of ſuſpending them.</p>
               <p>That the explanation of national treaties belongs to Congreſs, is ſtrictly conſtitutional; but not the explanation of the conſtitution itſelf, upon a legal caſe, any more than the explaination of law in the caſe of individual citizens. Theſe are altogether judiciary queſtions. It is, however, worth obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Congreſs in explaining the article of the treaty with reſpect to French prizes and French privateers, confined itſelf ſtrictly to the letter of the article. Let them explain the article of the conſtitution with reſpect to me in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and that deciſion, did it appertain to them, could not deprive me of my rights of citizenſhip or ſuſpend them, for I have accepted nothing from any king, prince, ſtate, or government.</p>
               <p>Painful as the want of liberty may be, it is a conſolation to believe, that my impriſonment proves to the world that I had no ſhare in the murderous ſyſtem that raged during the reign of terror. That I was an enemy to it both morally and politically, is known to all that had any knowledge of me; and could I have written French as well as I can Engliſh, I would have publicly expoſed its wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſhewn the ruin with which it was preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. Thoſe who have eſteemed me on former occaſions, whether in America or in Europe will, I
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0190703300:75"/>know, feel no cauſe to abate that eſteem, when they reflect, <hi>that impriſonment with preſervation of character is preferable to liberty with diſgrace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The letter quoted in the firſt page of this memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ſays, that <q>it would be out of character for an American miniſter to interfere in the internal affairs of France.</q> This goes on the idea that I am a citizen of France, and a member of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, which is not the fact. The Convention included me in the vote for diſmiſſing foreigners from the Convention, and the Committees impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned me as a foreigner. It alſo ſuppoſes decided<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that the article in the American conſtitution reſpecting grants made to American citizens by foreign kings, princes, or ſtates, is applicable to me; which is the very point in queſtion, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the application of which I contend. I ſtate evidence to the miniſter to ſhew, that I am not within the letter or meaning of that article; that it cannot operate againſt me; and I apply to him for the protection that I conceive I have a right to aſk and to receive. The internal affairs of France are out of the queſtion with reſpect to my applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or his interference. I aſk it not as a citizen of France, for I am not one; I aſk it not as a member of the Convention, for I am not one; I aſk it not as a man, againſt wham there is any as cuſation, for there is none; I aſk it not as an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
