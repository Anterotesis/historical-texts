            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CHILDREN'S FRIEND.</head>
            <div type="part">
               <head>ROBIN.</head>
               <p>ROBIN was about ſix years of age. He was not wicked, but his mother let him always have his way; and then his father was afraid that the poor child might cry his eyes out, if he wanted any thing, and ſhould not get it. Being thus indulged, his whims grew every day more frequent, and they could not always be gratified; for his parents were extremely poor, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as the expreſſion is, from hand to mouth. He grew at laſt quite obſtinate and quarrelſome, inſiſted upon hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every thing that he ſaw, and when he could not get it, would grow ſulky, tear his cloaths to ſhow his ſpite, do nothing that he was bid to do, and often quite the contrary.</p>
               <p>His parents were much grieved to ſee this behaviour in him, and judged it to proceed from a heart naturally perverſe. Alas! cried his mother, I once hoped that our little Robin would in time conſole us under all our griefs, be the joy of our old age, and work for our ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, when we were paſt our ſtrength, reflecting that we had done ſo much to feed and bring him up: but, on the contrary, he is our greateſt unhappineſs. His prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples are quite corrupt, ſaid the father; every one will hate him utterly, and not a ſoul aſſiſt him in his need. He will commit ſome wicked action, and be puniſhed for it by his country. He will live in ſhame and miſery. God grant I may be dead before this comes to paſs.</p>
               <p>Theſe mortifying thoughts would conſtantly be upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt within them. They were now no longer cheerful at their daily toil, and had no appetite for their meals. Their ſorrow had a viſible effect upon their health; their ſtrength ſoon failed them; and one morning, being more
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0360400703:8"/>depreſſed than uſual, they had not ſufficient ſpirits to get up. Not ſo the little Robin: he was up as uſual, and called for his breakfaſt. Robin, ſaid his mother, I am very ill, and cannot riſe to get it for you. On which he ſulked, ſhe wept, and Hutchinſon his father ſighed. The little urchin waited yet ſome time; but ſeeing neither of them ſtir, reſolved inſtantly what to do. He went to a neighbour's houſe for a light, as he deſigned to make a fire. A little girl came down to let him in; and ſeeing Robin, aſked him what he wanted, with a tone of voice that ſeemed to ſay he was not welcome; for ſhe did not like him in the leaſt. I want to light my candle, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Robin, Well, do ſo, returned the little girl, as I have let you in: but do not come here again. This way of talking Robin did not much like. He was very eaſily offended; ſo he went away and did not even light his candle.</p>
               <p>After this he viſited another neighbour, who came down; but ſeeing Robin through the caſement, he would not ſo much as aſk him what he wanted, but went up again. Refuſed admittance every where, he came home, put down the candle, and bethought himſelf of going to a good old woman's, who formerly uſed to treat him with ſweet things. He went and aſked her for ſome break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. Breakfaſt! anſwered Frances: why has not your mother let you have ſome? She is a-bed, ſaid Robin. Well, your father then? He likewiſe is a-bed. They ſay, they are ill. And would you leave them then, and come to me for victuals? Get you gone! I have nothing for you. Had I more than what I want myſelf, I would give it to poor children who are fonder of their parents than you are, and make them happy, whereas you every day torment yours.</p>
               <p>Robin came away in tears, and walked home very ſlowly. In the way, he recollected that he himſelf had frequently ſhammed illneſs; and ſuppoſed it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that his parents might now be doing the ſame. For certainty, he got upon a little chair, held back the curtain, and beheld how pale they were. He ſaw that they had been crying too. This ſight affected him. He put the curtains to again, ſat down beſide the bed, and held his hands up to his face. Unhappy that I am!
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0360400703:9"/>ſaid he, ſuppoſe my parents were to die, what would become of me? I am refuſed admittance every where, and cannot obtain a bit of bread. I muſt then have been very wicked! my poor mother! how you have at all times loved me! and how have I grieved you! And my father, my dear father—Who can tell, alas! but they will die?</p>
               <p>He ſat a little longer thinking; and returning after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the houſe where he had been refuſed entrance at firſt, begged for heaven's ſake that they would let him have a little bread and milk, to make a breakfaſt for his parents. His affliction and the humble tone of voice with which he now addreſſed them, eaſily gained him a hearing. Look ye, ſaid the good man of the cottage, ſince you aſk me thus, I will not refuſe you. Take the half of this brown loaf, with ſome of this milk, and warm it for your parents. It is but juſt that you ſhould prepare their breakfaſt, while they are both work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo hard for you. He durſt not mention that they were ill, becauſe he feared the ſame reproaches which Frances had beſtowed upon him, though he merited them now much leſs: on which account his charitable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor did not go himſelf to ſee them; as he would have done, had he but known their ſituation, for he eſteemed them greatly.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, Robin brought away the bread and milk, came home, made up a fire, and putting on a pipkin, boiled the milk. It was no ſooner ready, than he drew a little table towards the bed. His mother heard him move about the chamber. What can Robin be doing? ſaid his mother. Nothing good, I fear, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hutchinſon. She wiſhed to know, endeavoured to ſit up in bed; and looking through the curtains, which were very flimſy, ſaw the little table with two porringers, and Robin, who was cutting bread into them. Upon this, ſhe jogged her huſband. See, ſaid ſhe, I verily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he is doing this for us; elſe, why two porringers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the table? Would to God, ſaid Hutchinſon, he were! I am not hungry, but ſhould like to be convinced that he is better than we have thought him.</p>
               <p>Robin, with his pipkin came at laſt; and filling both the porringers approached his parents. Hold, ſaid he,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0360400703:10"/>dear father; hold dear mother.—Here's ſome breakfaſt for you both.—And is it you that prepared it? ſaid the father. Who could give you all this bread and milk? It was neighbour ſuch-a-one, anſwered he. The father and the mother bade him put down both the porringers again. Their eyes grew bright with joy. Dear child! come hither, cried they. You are not what we thought you to be; you bring both of us to life again. So ſaying, they held out their arms: he bent to their em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace; he wept, as they did likewiſe; he deſired for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs for the grief which he had occaſioned them; and promiſed that they ſhould henceforth be rejoiced by his behaviour.</p>
               <p>He was ſtill in their arms, when Frances entered with her breakfaſt in her hand; which ſhe brought, in order to ſhare it with her indiſpoſed good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. She was moved at ſuch a piteous ſight, ſhed tears of joy, and bleſſed the little Robin, who, on-his ſide, tenderly embraced her alſo. They all breakfaſted together, and had never in their lives before enjoyed ſo ſweet a meal.</p>
               <p>The happineſs of ſuch a day ſoon re-eſtabliſhed this good father, and this loving mother, in their former ſtate of health. The little boy alſo became very happy. He acquired the love of every one that knew him, was careſſed with juſtice by his parents and the charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Frances, who rejoiced to do them all the good in her power.</p>

            <div type="part">
               <head>AMELIA.</head>
               <p>AMELIA when ſcarcely ſix years old, was very fond of her mamma, and wiſhed continually to be with her. On a certain day, Amelia's mother wiſhed to go to market, and the little girl entreated to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her thither. You will only be troubleſome to me, child, ſaid ſhe. No, no; I hope, I ſhall not be troubleſome to you, ſaid Amelia; and preſſed ſo much that her mama at laſt conſented to give her leave.</p>

                  <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0360400703:11"/>They ſet out, therefore, both together. As it chanced, their houſe was in the country, and the paths proved very bad. Amelia frequently was forced to walk behind her mother, when the ruts would not permit them to have hold of one another. They were now come very near the town; and as it chanced, the road was crouded with a multitude of people paſſing every way. The little girl was often ſeparated from her mother; but this gave her no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, as after two or three ſuch accidents, ſhe had rejoined her with eaſe, but the nearer they approached the market, the more ſhe perceived the crowd to augment. This ſhould neceſſarily have made her watchful of the way that her mother went; and yet, a ſort of puppet-ſhow which was exhibiting, had charms ſufficient to detain her. She ſtopped ſhort to gaze at Punchinello. In the midſt, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, of her entertainment, ſhe turned round, but could not ſee her mother; ſhe ran on, called out, and ſcrambling up a bank, at once looked over all the people's heads: but it was in vain. She could not ſee her, could not hear her voice; and now the little maiden, being frightened, durſt not mix among ſo great a crowd, that joſtled one another. So ſhe got into a corner, called out mammy! mammy! and burſt into a flood of tears.</p>
               <p>The people that went by, looked at her. <hi>There is a little girl,</hi> ſaid one among them, <hi>in a piteous taking! What is the matter with you?</hi> aſked another. <hi>I have loſt my mammy! Oh, never mind it;</hi> anſwered he. <hi>You will find her cut again, I warrant you.</hi> A third ſaid, <hi>Do not cry, my little girl. She will not come to you the ſooner for that.</hi> Thus ſaid many, and they all went on about their buſineſs.</p>
               <p>By good luck, at laſt, however, an old woman who ſold eggs and butter, and was lame and therefore could not walk without a crutch, was going by, but ſeeing her in ſuch diſtreſs, ſtopped ſhort and pitied her. <hi>And which way was your mother going, little dear,</hi> ſaid the woman, <hi>when you loſt her? She was going to the market,</hi> ſaid Amelia. <hi>Well, be comforted,</hi> replied the firſt; <hi>and come along with me. I will take you to the market. You will find her there, no doubt.</hi> Amelia gave her hand, that moment, to the good old woman, and ſoon reached the market. As they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, ſhe perceived her mother, gave a cry of joy, and up her mother came immediately. She took the little girl into her arms, and ſaid, You frightened me exceedingly,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0360400703:12"/>my dear, by wandering from me: and the child, that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fell a hugging her, and cried.</p>
               <p>She told her of the puppet-ſhow, and that ſhe had ſtopped to look at it; how ſhe called out after her, and how the good old market-woman, and ſhe only, had taken pity of her and brought her through the crowd. Amelia's mother thanked her, bought what eggs and butter ſhe had left, and gave her more than ſhe aſked. Amelia kiſſed her ten times over; and while going home, would talk of nothing but the good old market-woman.</p>
               <p>When the firſt fine weather came, Amelia begged her mother to go ſee Dame Dunch, which was the market-woman's name: and ſhe conſented, took a loaf of bread, and half a pound of tea, with ſugar in proportion. Dame Dunch's dwelling was a wooden one: it was not large, but very clean and comfortable. In the front, there was a little graſs-plat, ſhaded on every ſide by fruit trees; upon which, Amelia danced till evening with a niece of the Dame's who was as kind and good natured as her aunt.</p>
               <p>Amelia's mother always bought Dame Dunch's eggs and butter, but complained that ſhe rated them at too low a price; while Dame Dunch would have it that ſhe was paid too much. Amelia and her mother gave the good old woman all the aſſiſtance in their power; and when in <hi>her</hi> turn the old woman could be ſerviceable to Amelia or her mother, ſhe would put on her cloth apron, take her crutch, and come quite out of breath, but very joyous.</p>
               <p>Thus they did each other mutual ſervice: but the good old woman had the greateſt reaſon to rejoice, that ſhe had taken pity on a little girl in trouble. In the act of helping her, ſhe did not think that her good heart would gain her ſuch a world of happy hours.</p>

                  <p>You will not be long before you have knit a pair of garters for papa; and I have been this fortnight at a pair of ruffles, which he does not know. What then hinders, pray, but we may finiſh theſe two articles a day or two on this ſide Chriſtmas Monday?</p>

                  <speaker>Letitia.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Letitia.</speaker>
                  <p>Nor is it neceſſary; for the money that we ſhall want, to make our purchaſe at the fair, we may borrow of ourſelves; and afterwards repay it upwards of two days before we make our preſents.

               <head>ABEL.</head>
               <p>LITTLE Abel was ſcarce turned of eight years old, when he had the misfortune to loſe his mother. It afflicted him ſo much, that nothing could reſtore him to the gaiety ſo natural to young children. Mrs. Donaldſon, his aunt, was forced to take him to her houſe, for fear his ſadneſs ſhould ſtill aggravate her brother's inconſolable diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>They went, however, frequently to ſee him; and at laſt, the time was come for going out of mourning. Abel therefore quitted his; and, though his heart was full of ſorrow, he endeavoured to aſſume a lively counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. His father was affected at this ſenſibility: but alas! it only occaſioned him more ſorrow, by cauſing him to reflect that he had for ever loſt the mother of this amiable child; and this reflexion, every one remarked, was bringing him with ſorrow to the grave.</p>
               <p>It was a fortnight now, ſince Abel had been to ſee him as uſual. His aunt always urged ſome pretext or other during that time, as often as he wiſhed to go. The truth
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0360400703:16"/>is, Mr. Donaldſon was dangerouſly ill. He durſt not aſk to ſee his child, from apprehenſion that the ſight of his condition might too much affect him. Theſe paternal ſtruggles, joined with the former depreſſion of his ſpirits, ſo exhauſted him, that very ſoon there was no hope re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining of his cure. He died, in fact, upon the day before his birth-day.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, Abel, having waked betimes, tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented Mrs. Donaldſon ſo much for leave to go and wiſh his father joy, that ſhe at laſt conſented; but he ſaw his mourning was now to go on again.</p>
               <p>And why this ugly black, ſaid he, to-day, when we are going to papa?—Who is dead now, aunt?</p>
               <p>His aunt was ſo afflicted, that ſhe could not ſpeak a word.</p>
               <p>Well then, ſaid Abel, if you will not tell me, I will enquire of my papa.</p>
               <p>At this ſhe could no longer refrain from weeping, but burſt out into a flood of tears, and ſaid, It is he, it is he himſelf that is dead.</p>
               <p>What, my papa dead! anſwered he. O heaven! take pity on me. My mama firſt dead! and now papa! Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy as I am, and parentleſs! what will become of me? O my papa! mama!</p>
               <p>Theſe words were ſcarcely uttered, when he fell into a ſwoon; nor could his aunt, without much difficulty, bring him to himſelf again.</p>
               <p>Poor child, ſaid ſhe, do not be thus afflicted. Your parents are ſtill living.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Abel.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; but where?</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Donaldſon.</speaker>
                  <p>In heaven, with God. They are both happy in that place; and will at all times have an eye upon their child. If you are prudent, diligent, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, they will pray that God may bleſs you; and God certainly <hi>will</hi> bleſs you. This was the laſt prayer that your father uttered yeſterday, when dying.</p>

                  <p>Yeſterday! when I was thinking of the pleaſure that I ſhould have in ſeeing him this morning.—Yeſterday! Then he is not buried yet? O aunt, pray let me ſee him! He would not ſend for me, fearing to afflict me; and perhaps I, on the contrary, ſhould have afflicted him. But now, as I cannot poſſibly give him any pain, I would
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0360400703:17"/>once more behold him, for the laſt, laſt time! Pray let me go and ſee him, my dear aunt!</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Donaldſon.</speaker>
                  <p>Well then, we will go together, if you promiſe to be calm. You ſee my tears, and how much I am grieved for having loſt my brother. He was always doing me ſome good or other: I was poor, and had no maintenance but what his bounty gave me. Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding which, I yield myſelf, you ſee, to Providence that watches over us. Be calm, then, my dear child!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Abel.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, yes; I muſt indeed be calm. But pray, aunt, carry me to my papa, that I may ſee at leaſt his coffin.</p>
               </sp>
               <p>Mrs. Donaldſon then took him by the hand and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly went out: the day was very dark and even foggy. Abel wept as he went on.</p>
               <p>When they were come before the houſe, the mutes were at the door, and Mr. Donaldſon's late friends and neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were ſtanding round his coffin. They wept bitterly, and praiſed the integrity of the deceaſed. Little Abel ruſhed into the houſe, and threw himſelf upon the coffin. For ſome time he could not ſpeak a word; but at laſt raiſed his head a little, crying out, See how your little Abel weeps for having loſt you! When mama died, you conſoled me, and yet wept yourſelf; but now, who will conſole me for your loſs! Oh! my papa! my good papa!</p>
               <p>He could utter no more: his ſorrow almoſt ſtrangled him. His mouth was open, and his tongue ſeemed mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs. His eyes at one time fixed; and at another, rolling in their ſockets, had no tears to ſhed. His aunt had need of all her ſtrength to pluck him from the coffin. She conducted him to a neighbour's houſe, begging her to keep him till his father's burial was over; for ſhe durſt not think of carrying him to ſee it.</p>
               <p>Very ſoon the bell was ſet a tolling. Abel heard it; and the woman to whoſe care he had been truſted having quitted the apartment for a moment, he availed himſelf of the opportunity, got out, and ran that inſtant to the church-yard, whither the funeral was gone. The mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter had finiſhed, and the grave was filling up;—when, all at once, a cry was heard of, <hi>Bury me with my papa!</hi> and Abel jumped into the grave.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0360400703:18"/>The mourners were affected at it: Abel was drawn out all pale and ſpeechleſs, and, in ſpite of his reſiſtance, carried home.</p>
               <p>He was for upwards of three days continually fainting; and his aunt could not bring him to be compoſed, even at intervals, except by ſpeaking to him of his dear papa. At length his firſt exceſs of anguiſh was allayed: he wept no longer, but was very ſorrowful.</p>
               <p>A worthy merchant heard of this deplorable affair. He had not been without ſome knowledge of the father; therefore he repaired to Mrs. Donaldſon, that he might ſee the little orphan. He was very much affected at his ſadneſs, took him home and was a father to him. Abel ſoon conſidered himſelf as really the merchant's ſon, and every day gained greater ground in his affection. At the age of twenty, he conducted all the buſineſs of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor with ſo much ſucceſs, that in reality the merchant thought it his duty to aſſign him half the profits of it for the future; to which recompenſe he added his beloved daughter.—Abel hitherto had maintained his aunt out of the little perquiſites belonging to him; and, by this event, he had the further happineſs of making her quite eaſy for the remnant of her days. But never did his father's birth-day come about, but he was ſeized in ſome ſort with a fever, on recalling to his memory what he once had ſuffered at that ſeaſon; and to thoſe ſenſations which then affected him did he impute the principles of honour and integrity that he ever afterwards cultivated during the whole of a long life.</p>

               <head>THE COMPLIMENT OF THE NEW YEAR.</head>
               <p>UPON a certain new-year's day, little Peregrine came into the parlour, juſt before breakfaſt was ready. He advanced, and with the greateſt gravity ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luting his papa, began as follows, in a ſolemn tone of voice:</p>
               <p>"As formerly the Romans were accuſtomed every new-year's day to wiſh their friends all happineſs; ſo <hi>I,</hi> thrice honoured father, come—So <hi>I,</hi> thrice honoured father, come—come—come—"</p>
               <p>The little orator at this ſtopped ſhort. It was in vain; he fretted, rubbed his forehead, and began to fumble in his pocket. The remainder of this excellent harangue was not forth coming. The poor little boy was vexed, and quite in agitation. Mr. Veſey ſaw and pitied his embarraſſment, embraced him tenderly, and ſaid as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: "Truly a moſt elegant oration! You yourſelf, no doubt, compoſed it?"</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>No. papa; you are very good to think ſo, but I am not half learned enough for ſuch a taſk. It was my brother that drew it up. You ſhould have heard the whole. He told me that it was in periods; and the periods, he ſaid, were rounded off into the bargain. Look ye, I will but run it over once, and you ſhall hear it then: or would you rather hear mama's? I have <hi>that</hi> perfectly, I am ſure. It is extracted from the Grecian Hiſtory.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no, Peregrine, it is not neceſſary; and your mother and myſelf, without it, are as much indebted both to your affection and your brother's.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, he was a fortnight, I aſſure you, at the work; and I employed a deal of time in learning them. What an unlucky thing that I ſhould now forget, when I
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0360400703:20"/>moſt wanted to remember it! No longer ago than laſt night, believe me, I delivered the whole ſpeech without the leaſt heſitation, in the ſervant's room, and ſpeaking to your wig-block, if it could but tell you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>I was then at ſtudy in my cloſet, and to comfort you, muſt ſay, I heard it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine,</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <stage>(brighteming up:)</stage> Did you?—I am glad of that! and do not you think, papa, that I ſpoke it very well?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>Surpriſingly, I muſt acknowledge.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, but it was very fine!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>To ſay the truth, your brother has quite crammed it full of eloquence. And yet, I ſhould have liked a ſingle word or two much better from yourſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>But ſure, papa, to ſay that I wiſh the perſon to whom I am ſpeaking a happy new year, and nothing elſe, is far too common to give pleaſure.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes: but why then nothing elſe? as if, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of offering ſuch a naked compliment, you could not previouſly have thought within yourſelf, what I wiſhed moſt of all to enjoy during the courſe of this new year.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh, that is not difficult. You wiſh, no doubt, to have your health, to ſee your family, your friends and fortune flouriſh, and to enjoy a deal of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>Well; do not you wiſh me all this?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Reregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, with all my heart.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>What hinders then, but you could have made me up yourſelf a charming compliment, without requiring the aſſiſtance of another?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Really, I did not think myſelf ſo learned; but it is always thus, when <hi>you</hi> inſtruct me; ſince I find out things which I did not think were in me. I can now make compliments to every one that I know. I need ſay nothing but what I have mentioned juſt this moment.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>It may ſuit, I muſt acknowledge, many people; but ſhould certainly be different with reſpect to others.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I underſtand you pretty well, papa; but I do not know what the difference ſhould be; ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain it to me, now we are alone.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>With all my heart. There are a multitude of what are called good things, that one may wiſh any
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0360400703:21"/>perſon whatſoever to enjoy; ſuch as what you mentioned juſt now: there are others, that refer to different indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals according to their ſituations, age and duties. For example; one may wiſh to a man who is happy already, the long continuation of his happineſs; to an unhappy man, the end of his affliction; to a man in office, that God's providence may bleſs his labours for the public welfare, give him neceſſary penetration, with the gift of perſeverance to continue in them, and eſtabliſh the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of felicity among his countrymen, by way of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence on his endeavours. To an old man one may wiſh a length of life exempt from every inconveniency; to children, on the other hand, the preſervation of their parents, progreſs in their ſtudies, with a love of arts; to parents, the completion of their hopes, in bringing up their children; every ſpecies of proſperity to ſuch as are our benefactors: and the long continuation of their kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. It is our duty even to bethink us of our enemies, and to pray that God may ſhow them the injuſtice of their conduct, and inſpire them with a wiſh of meriting our friendſhip.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>O papa, how much I thank you! I have now a budget full of compliments for every one. I ſhall know what ſort of wiſhes they will expect, and have no occaſion for my brother's rounded periods, as he calls them: but why, as we ſhould always have theſe wiſhes in our heart, pray tell me why the firſt day of the year, in preference to any other, ſhould be pitched upon to publiſh them?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe our life is, as it were, a ladder, every ſtep of which is repreſented by a year. It is natural that our friends ſhould flock together, and make merry with us, when our foot has got in ſafety on the ſtep next to <hi>that</hi> which we lately trod, and to expreſs their wiſh that we ſhould climb the reſt with equal ſafety. Do you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand me?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>O papa, quite clearly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>It is however in my power to make this clearer ſtill, by uſing what we call another figure.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah, let us have it, pray, papa.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you remember, then, our going to the top of that fine church in London, called St. Paul's?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0360400703:22"/>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh! what a charming proſpect from the golden gallery there! Why, you remember we could ſee all London and a great deal of the country from it!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>Greenwich hoſpital particularly ſtruck your eye; and as you could not then have any notion of the diſtance, you propoſed that we ſhould the following week go there on foot to dinner.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, papa; and did I not, pray, walk the whole long journey like a man?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, well enough. I had no reaſon to find fault with your performance; but remember, I took care, at every mile-ſtone on the road, to make you ſit and reſt a little.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>So you did indeed; and it was in my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, no bad idea at the firſt, to put up thoſe figured ſtones beſide the road. One knows at any time what diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance one has walked, how much is ſtill to come, and ſo regulates one's pace accordingly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>In this you have yourſelf explained the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages which ariſe from our dividing life into thoſe equal portions that we call years: for every year is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a mile-ſtone in the road of life.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine</speaker>
                  <p>I underſtand you. And the ſeaſons are, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, ſo many quarter-miles, which tell us that we ſhall very ſoon arrive at the next ſtone.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>Your obſervation is extremely juſt; and I am glad that this little journey is ſtill freſh in your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. If you take it in a proper point of view, it will exhibit a true picture of life. Remember, if you can, the different circumſtances that took place while you were poſting on to Greenwich; tell them in the order in which they fell out, as well as you are able, and I will make the application.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhould ſcarce remember the whole buſineſs better, had it happened yeſterday. At firſt, as I was full of ſpirits and deſired to let you ſee it, I ſet out upon a trot and made a number of trips; I do not well know how many. You adviſed me to go ſlowly, as the journey would be rather long. I followed your advice and had no reaſon to repent. Upon the way, I aſked for informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the ſight of every thing of which I did not know the meaning, and you were pleaſed to tell me. When we happened to go by a bit of graſs, we ſat down on it, and
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0360400703:23"/>you read a ſtory-book that you had brought out in your pocket to divert me. Then we got upon our feet again; and as we went along, you told me many other things not only uſeful but diverting likewiſe. In this manner, though the weather was not altogether fine, though we had ſometimes rain, and once a hail-ſtorm to encounter, we arrived at Greenwich, I remember, very freſh and hearty, and made afterwards a charming dinner.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>Very faithfully related, Peregrine! but for ſome few circumſtances, which, however, I am glad you have not introduced; as for example, your attention to a poor blind man whom you caught by the arm, if you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, to prevent him from falling upon a heap of ſtones that lay before him, and on which he might have broke his legs; the aſſiſtance that you afforded a poor waſher woman's boy, by picking up a handkerchief of linen which had fallen out of the cart; but particularly the alms that you gave to ſeveral people on the road.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you think, then, papa, that I forgot them? I know that we ſhould not boaſt of any good, that we may have had the opportunity of doing.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>And on that account, I am greatly pleaſed in dwelling on it, as a recompence for ſo much modeſty. It is juſt that I ſhould repay you ſome ſmall portion of the joy which you cauſed me.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh! I ſaw tears rolling in your eye, not once alone, nor twice, but often. I was ſo delighted! if you knew how much that ſight made me forget my weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! I walked much the better for it. But let me have the application that you juſt mentioned.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>It is as follows, Peregrine. Give me all the attention in your power.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Fear nothing. I will not loſe a ſyllable, ſir, of what you tell me, I aſſure you.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>The look, then, which you caſt round you from the golden gallery, all over London, and a great deal, as you mentioned, of the country, is expreſſive of the firſt reflexions of a child upon the multitude about him. The long walk that you choſe to Greenwich, is the journey which we propoſe to ourſelves through life. The eagerneſs with which you wiſhed to hurry on at ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out, without conſulting your ability for running, and which coſt you ſuch repeated trips, is the natural
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0360400703:24"/>impetuoſity of youth which would excite us to the worſt exceſſes, if a faithful and experienced friend were not to moderate it. The inſtruction that you derived, as we were walking on, from reading and converſing with me, and the actions of good-will and charity that you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, took off from the fatigue of ſuch a journey; and you finiſhed it thereby with ſatisfaction to yourſelf, though there had fallen a deal of rain, and even hail. Theſe circumſtances, too, convey inſtruction; for in life there are no other means than the performance of our duty, to keep off diſquietude and to cheriſh peace within us, notwithſtanding thoſe viciſſitudes of fortune which would otherwiſe, perhaps, go near to overwhelm us: and the comfortable meal that we made at the concluſion of our journey is no other than an emblem of the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence which God gives us when we die, to crown thoſe virtuous actions that we have laboured to perform while in this world.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, yes, papa; all this ſquares wonderfully well, and I ſhall have a deal of happineſs, I ſee before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, in the year that is now begun.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>It reſts with yourſelf alone to make the year quite happy; but once more, let us return to our excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Do you recollect when in going round, that we might ſee a little of the park, we came upon Blackheath? The heavens were then ſerene, and we could ſee behind us all the way that we had been walking.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, indeed, papa! and I was proud of having walked ſo far!</p>

                  <p>By <hi>proud,</hi> you mean rejoiced. Are you then equally rejoiced at preſent, while your reaſon which now dawns within you, pauſes and caſt back a look upon the way that you have already made in life? You entered it quite weak and naked, without any means of making, in the leaſt degree, proviſion for your wants. It was your mother who gave you your firſt food, and it is I that have the forethought to ſubſiſt you. How do we deſire you to repay us? We want nothing more, than that you ſhould yourſelf endeavour to be happy, by becoming juſt and honeſt; by acquiring a due notion of your ſeveral duties; and by ſeriouſly intending to diſcharge them. Have you then fulfilled theſe few conditions, no leſs advantageous to yourſelf than eaſy? Have you firſt of all been grateful
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0360400703:25"/>to God's goodneſs, who has willed that you ſhould be born of parents poſſeſſing wherewithal to bring you up in eaſe and honour? Have you always ſhewn thoſe parents the obedience and reſpect that you owe them? Have you paid attention to the precepts of your teachers? Have you never given occaſion for your brothers or your ſiſters to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of envy or injuſtice in you? Have you always treated thoſe who wait upon you, with a proper ſort of conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion, and at no time claimed from their inferior ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what it was their duty to refuſe you? In a word, do you poſſeſs that love of juſtice, that equality of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and that moderation which we, by our inſtruction and example, are at all times doing what we can to ſet before you?</p>

                  <p>Ah, papa, let us not look ſo much at what is paſt, but to the future. Every thing that I ſhould have done, I promiſe by God's bleſſing to do hereafter.</p>

                  <speaker>Mr. Veſey.</speaker>
                  <p>That is well ſaid: embrace me, therefore, Peregrine. I accept your promiſe, and confine to its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance all the wiſhes that I need make, on my ſide, for your happineſs, on this renewal of the year.</p>

                     <sp>

                        <p>What except the pleaſure, Archibald, of ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you? The truth however is, that I am come to know what Chriſtmas-boxes you have had.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>What Chriſtmas-boxes, do you aſk me? If my mother, ſiſter and myſelf have but the neceſſary things of life, we are content.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>But Mr. Damer, ſurely, lets you want for nothing.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>It is true, indeed, we are his debtors for whatever we poſſeſs, and he continues in our favour the reſpect, as I may call it, that he had for my poor father; and his ſon, too, has a friendſhip for us. Do you ſee, ſir, this new ſuit of clothes upon me? it is Edward's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. It was bought for him, but his papa permitted him to give it me, by way of Chriſtmas-box. He has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0360400703:27"/>too on Miſs Veronica to preſent my ſiſter with a few of her caſt clothes; and we were laſt night very happy in receiving them.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>I ſuppoſe ſo; but if you talk of Chriſtmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boxes, it is he that has received ſome fine ones no doubt!</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>Certainly, his father is ſo rich! and yet, I know not if his pleaſure was as great as ours. Fine things are no novelties to him. And what we may receive, whenever we think proper, never gives us ſo much joy as what <hi>they</hi> feel to whom their benefactors unexpectedly make preſents.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>I agree with you in this: but cannot you tell me what Edward has received? No doubt he has ſhown you all his preſents.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>Yes, yes, that he has indeed: but how ſhall I remember the whole catalogue? Let me reflect a little. In the firſt place, he has had ſome books, a caſe of mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical inſtruments, a microſcope, ſilk ſtockings, and a ſet of ſilver buttons for a ſuit of clothes, compleat.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>But thoſe are not the things that I mean. What I want to know about, friend Archibald, are the ſweetmeats and nice things, that generally are preſented, at this ſeaſon of the year, to children of our age.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>Oh! his papa has given him no ſuch things: he ſays that ſweetmeats do but rot the teeth; and as for play-things, certainly Edward is too big, to wiſh for ſuch matters. It is only from his aunt that he received trifles of this ſort. She, indeed, has given him ſome of what you mention.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>Ay, ay! and what for inſtance?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>How can I remember them? There is in the firſt place, a great cake; a quantity of candied orange peel; ſome capillaire; and ſweetmeats; half-a-dozen companies of French and Engliſh ſoldiers, caſt in lead, and in their uniforms; a draft-board; fiſh and counters; and about a dozen china figures made in Derbyſhire. But rather go and ſpeak to him yourſelf. He will ſhow you every thing that he has received. Why do you put theſe ſeveral queſtions to me?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>Oh! I know what I am doing. I had my reaſons for interrogating you, before I went up ſtairs into Edward's room.</p>

                        <p>O! be aſſured, I ſhall not wrong him perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally: but I ſpeak of an affair in which we both have come to an agreement.</p>

                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>

                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>

                        <p>I will explain the matter to you. We had previouſly agreed to go equal ſharers in our Chriſtmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boxes, whatſoever they might be, reſpecting every thing that in its nature was diviſible.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>Well, pray, and can he loſe by ſuch a bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain? His papa is not ſo rich as yours. Your Chriſtmas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boxes therefore muſt, at leaſt in point of value, equal his, and very probably exceed them.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>It is true, indeed, I have received a very handſome Chriſtmas-box. This watch, for inſtance; but a watch, you know, cannot be divided.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>On your honour, you have had no other preſent?</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>Nothing, I aſſure you, but a cake and two ſmall boxes of preſerves. My father ſays, as Mr. Damer does, that ſweetmeats hurt one. While mama was living it was quite another thing, for then I had ſuch delicacies in abundance; and Edward knows as much, who ſaw my laſt year's Chriſtmas-boxes. It was this that induced him to make ſuch a bargain with me; and laſt week too, we confirmed it on our word. You ſee, then—</p>
                     </sp>

                        <p>Yes, I ſee too clearly, that Edward is to be your dupe. He will have only half a cake and ſome pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves for what he is to give you up. It is true, his aunt has ſent him more than he can eat. But is it true then, Maſter Charles, that you had nothing elſe? I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, I find it very difficult to credit your aſſertion.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>Difficult to credit my aſſertion! Shall I ſwear, then, to the truth of what I ſay?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>Swear! Fye! Should a little gentleman, as you are, think of ſwearing in this matter? It is entirely your affair; and if you are deceiving my good friend Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, you will loſe much more than he, Charles.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>But, Archibald, do you know that I do not approve of ſuch remonſtrances? It is Edward's buſineſs to reflect on the affair. Suppoſe Edward had received no Chriſtmas-box?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>There was no fear of that. His friends are generous, and Edward's conduct pleaſes them. Your Chriſtmas-box is ſuch a trifle! It would be quite unhand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome in you, to expect that Edward ſhould have all the diſadvantage on his ſide; and therefore we muſt go and tell him.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <p>Oh! that is done already. Late laſt night I ſent him half the cake that I received, and part of my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves. I have likewiſe written him a little letter on the ſubject.</p>

                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>And pray what would you do, in my ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? You that talk ſo much!</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>I would have nothing from him, having nothing upon my ſide to beſtow; and therefore quit him of his promiſe.</p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>Oh! your humble ſervant! Keep your counſel to yourſelf. Our bargain is a wager; and when people think of laying wagers, it is that they may win. Next year it ſhall be as he pleaſes; but at preſent, if he does not give me half of every thing that he has received, his cake, his orange-peel, his ſweetmeats, ſoldiers, fiſh and counters, china ware, and any thing elſe that you may have forgot to mention, I will follow him through all the ſtreets, courts, lanes, and every thoroughfare in London, and proclaim him for a cheat. Yes, tell him that from
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0360400703:30"/>me, friend Archibald; and, that ſuch as we ſhould keep our promiſe, after we have ſworn to one another.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>After you have ſworn! Fie, fie upon your oaths! I am very poor; and yet, if you would give me all the Chriſtmas-boxes that ever you received, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting even your fine watch, I would not ſwear in ſuch a trifling matter. It ſhould be a very ſolemn buſineſs only that would make me take an oath.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>Why, Archibald, you are a downright ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleton. Without this ſwearing, how ſhould any one be bound to keep his promiſe?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>Do you aſk that ſeriouſly? His very promiſe ſhould compel him to obſerve it, and the word of honeſt people be as ſacred as an oath. If you judge otherwiſe, I do not know what I am to think of you.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>It is your idea, then, that Edward will be faithful to his promiſe?</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>My idea? Should he break it, inſignificant as I muſt own myſelf, I would never look upon him as long as I have breath. But no, he will not break it; and to keep his word, will have no manner of occaſion for an oath.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>That we ſhall ſee. However, tell him every thing that I have ſaid, that he may act accordingly.</p>

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>I need tell him nothing. He does not want a monitor to do his duty.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>And pray add, I wiſh him joy that he is ſo finely taken in.</p>

                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>No: but I divert myſelf at his expence, as he would do at mine. Let him alone! Another time, if he thinks proper, he may be revenged.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Archibald.</speaker>
                        <p>No, no; this is the only buſineſs of the kind that ever he will tranfact with you.</p>
                     </sp>
                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>

If, in truth, he has no more than what he tells me from his father, why then did he not break off the bargain, when he found it likely to preſs ſo hard upon his friend? What avarice! and what meanneſs likewiſe! It is Edward's fault, however, and will hardly ruin him. But here he comes.</p>

                        <p>Ah, ah! I underſtand the matter. You de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to dupe him then; therefore you are puniſhed with juſtice.</p>

                        <p>I think him honeſt, ſince he told me ſo him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and it is my practice to think well of every one, till he has once deceived me.</p>

                        <p>Have you not the other half ſtill left? Well then, imagine yourſelf to have received no more; but think particularly how much reputation ſuch an action will procure you in men's eyes, when they obſerve that you put no value upon what the generality of children ſo fondly prize, but can ſcorn them when your word is to be kept. As many as are told of your fidelity will love you. Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Charles deſigns to trick you, I am ſure, he will never have the courage afterwards to look you in the face; whereas, upon the other hand, you will walk before him with your head up, ſure of the eſteem of all good people. Yes, my dear Edward, let us always deal uprightly, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever price it coſts us. Ah! if I were rich, you ſhould not have to mourn your loſs a moment upon this occaſion. I would give you every thing in my poſſeſſion to make you amends.</p>

Yes, I confeſs it, I was mercenary and unjuſt, but will be ſo no longer. I will look with ſcorn upon the baubles that had charms enough, as I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined, to corrupt me: ſo let Charles directly have his ſhare, and you yourſelf ſhall halve them; give him what you pleaſe.

                     <sp>
                        <speaker>Edward.</speaker>
                        <p>In my diſtribution! It is Archibald that has all the merit of it. I cannot tell what happy art he has; but to deprive myſelf of what I had beforehand ſo much cheriſhed, was a pleaſure to me. Yet there is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in your ſhare that I added of myſelf.</p>

                        <speaker>Charles.</speaker>
                        <p>But you ſhall keep the whole: for I will have nothing of it, and am happy to get rid of ſuch a burthen. I ſhould never have preſumed to look you in the face. I could not think how much one ſuffers by becoming a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſt man.</p>

<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0360400703:44"/>All this is due to Archibald. So neceſſitous, and yet ſo upright! Sure he could not claim a recompence for telling you my Chriſtmas-boxes?</p>

Theſe Turkiſh dreſſes were part of her ſpoils, and we put them on for this frolic, the better to diſguiſe ourſelves. Oh! I forgot to mention too, that I have brought a band of muſic from Portſmouth.

                     <p>I wanted to ſpeak with you about this Revel. Mr. Aſcham has juſt now mentioned that it would be proper to have as it were a general rehearſal of it. Perhaps it is to divert my uneaſineſs, but he aſſures me that it cannot poſſibly be long before my huſband returns. This idea, which ſeems to haſten his return, ſtill more—</p>

                     <p>The matter is this—Lookye, you underſtand— When I come from market, I put the beſt leg foremoſt to get home; not that I have ſo fine a woman to my wife, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam, as you are, neither! nor ſo fine a daughter as Miſs Meliſſa here. <stage>(aſide.)</stage> Plague on it!

There came ſome of thoſe curſed Huſſars. In an hour's time there was not a ſingle hedge left ſtanding in all that part of the country. Then the ſtatues in our garden, your Apollos, your Jupiters, and your Mercuries, thoſe they ſoon turned topſy-turvy. I ſhould not have cared a ſtraw for them; but my poor me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons! my poor aſparagus! it grieved me to the heart to ſee them demoliſhed. And yet I was not the head gardener neither. Now that I am gardener in chief, only think if that was to happen. I ſhould throw myſelf head foremoſt into the draw-well. But come, a fig for thoſe madcaps. It is peace timenow; huzza! Come, Mr. Aſcham, we will go and ſettle this buſineſs.</p>

                     <p>My age is the cauſe why I have more obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to him than the young ones. I know the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, madam, longer than you do. Many a time have I ſet him a riding upon this very ſtick. He was not ſo big as maſter Conſtantine here, when he began to be my be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor. I was poor then, and he had no more than his pocket-money. Well, he found means to relieve me out of many difficulties even with that. It was in vain that I told him only half of my diſtreſs. He could gueſs more than I could hide from him. As ſoon as he came to his eſtate, he made me a preſent of the cottage that I inhabit, and let me ſome lands which are round about it, but on ſo favourable a leaſe that I ſoon got above the world. Thanks to his friendſhip, I have been able to bring up all my children, and to ſettle them eaſily in the world, which as I have done through his means, I count them as much his family as mine, and love them the better on that ſcore.</p>

                     <p>Is it poſſible! But I believe it, and it is no more than he ought. For why? he has done good to a great many of his tenants; he has rebuilt their cottages when thrown down by ſtorms, or burnt; he has helped them in bad ſeaſons; he has forgiven them their rent. Let them bleſs him, let them love him, let them revere him; but I ſhould be main vexed if I thought, that

               <p>The ſerenity then reigning round about, the pleaſure of reviſiting thoſe places which his own hands had culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated in times paſt, and of being once again reſtored in ſafety to his family, when ſuch an interval of ſeparation had elapſed, and even the recollection of the dangers to which he had often been expoſed, every thing inſpired him with unſpeakable affection; and his children, ſenſible of this, employed the opportunity to aſk him queſtion after queſtion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0360400703:71"/>He gave a relation of every thing worth knowing, that had happened to him in his many and perilous voyages, of the ſtorms that had attacked his ſhips, and the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zardous expeditions in which he was concerned. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to them the ſolitary uninhabited regions viſited by his people, and, on the other hand, the populous nations that he had ſeen, together with their cuſtoms, characters, and manners.</p>
               <p>During his recital, he was careful to remark what ſort of feelings it excited in their hearts, and what was the expreſſion of thoſe feelings on their countenances. At the ſlighteſt mention of the dangers that he had encountered, he felt the little girls, by inſtinct as it were, preſs tenderly to him: they ſighed, and now and then let fall a tear; while Conſtantine, his ſon, was animated, and ſeemed ready, or at leaſt his features ſpoke him ready, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter the ſame degree of danger. In particular, at the recital of any warlike action, you might ſee his breaſt heave, and his eyes ſparkle like fire.</p>
               <p>Papa, cried he at length, if I were but as big as you, how I ſhould like to go to war, that, in my turn, I might appear as brave a man as you.</p>

                  <p>Exactly ſuch is the pretext aſſigned in general by all conquerors. But what happened to the little boy? When he had finiſhed eating, he grew ſick. The aliments that we ſwallow, being meant to ſtrengthen us, it is very natural to fancy that the more we take the ſtronger we ſhall be: ſo alſo it is not unnatural for a child to fancy that a prince, whoſe territories are increaſed, ſhould find his power increaſed in proportion. But in reality, it is with a kingdom juſt as with our ſtomach. Being over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged, it muſt be out of order. If the little boy had been contented with the piece that he had received, (for you muſt know he was an ailing child, and therefore had not ſo much as his ſiſter who was very hearty,) it would have digeſted properly and ſtrengthened him; whereas, by eating more than he could bear, it had the effect upon him which I have juſt now mentioned. If his ſiſter, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the example that he had ſet her, had proceeded upon this to take away his bit of cake by force, as little as ſhe was, he would not have had ſufficient ſtrength to ſave it from her.</p>

                  <speaker>Conſtant.</speaker>
                  <p>But, perhaps, he would have thought of the injuſtice that he had done, and yielded it without a ſtruggle?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Com. Fr.</speaker>
                  <p>That is a generoſity of which the common ſort of conquerors are not capable to one another. If they were but ſo in favour of their ſubjects only, how could they reflect upon the multitude of victims which they muſt ſacrifice upon the altar of their vengeance or ambition, the firſt time they combat with the people whom they have made their enemies, and not be ſtruck with horror at the thought? I ſhould imagine it would be well, if kings, upon the point of undertaking any war, ſhould have a picture hung before them, ſetting forth the horrors of that war, ſo that their fancies might be inceſſantly affected with the idea of it; and at midnight, when all nature otherwiſe is ſtill about them, might hear the groans of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0360400703:76"/>wounded men reproaching them as the occaſion of thoſe pains which they ſuffer, the deſpairing cries of wives and mothers loading them with curſes, and the clamours of a people famiſhing for want of bread. Their ſouls are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times wrought on, by unjuſt ſolicitations, to grant crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals their life; and yet they ſign, without remorſe, what ſhall condemn to death even thouſands of their unoffend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſubjects. A good king employs whole years in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating on a project that may finally prove beneficial to ſome portion of his ſtate, to population, trade, or agriculture. Twenty years ſhall paſs away before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is perfected; while a warlike, that is, cruel king ſhall, by the reſolution of a moment, half exterminate his people, put a ſtop to agriculture, tie up the induſtrious hands of artizans, deprive the poor of their ſubſiſtence by depriving them of daily work, reduce whole families to diſſolution, and at laſt entirely overthrow his realm!</p>

                  <p>And this is an addition to the evils which it foments; for, not to ſpeak of thoſe antipathies which the inequality of wealth produces in the hearts of ſuch as are each other's neighbours, thoſe enormous fortunes cheriſh a degree of luxury that cannot but corrupt men's manners to the laſt exceſs. The pomp with which it is ſurrounded, the enjoyment which it procures, the ſhameful deference or reſpect which men dare not, if they would, refuſe it, ſtimulate the generality of thoſe who are upon an equal footing in regard to rank with the luxurious, but leſs wealthy, to affect it with the ſame indecency, that they may either ſatisfy their pride or keep up their reſpectabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. They waſte their real wealth in keeping up their luxury, that they may gain poſſeſſion of that ſhadowy wealth which they fancy they <hi>ſhall</hi> get. Intimidated by the dread of their approaching ruin, if they do not haſten to prevent it by unlawful methods, they embark in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous enterpriſes, and expoſe not only their own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, but whatever may be entruſted in their hands by others whom the hope of a fallacious profit will inveigle to be partners in their ſchemes. Their ruin is at laſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced; but the example will not terrify cupidity which always hopes to proſper more than others, by employing ſubtler artifices: and as ſoon as probity is given up, then
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:0360400703:77"/>mutual truſt is baniſhed, and a nation's commerce periſhes through the exceſs of that abundance which it created.</p>

                  <p>Not at all. It is only ſuddenly made fortunes that intoxicate the minds of their poſſeſſors, and excite them to abuſe their wealth. Fortunes gradually gained, or in the ordinary courſe of commerce, are in conſequence of many years conſumed in toil. Men hardly ever diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate the treaſure which they have laboured hard to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, but lay it by, to ſerve them in the weariſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of old age: beſides, their fortunes are, in that caſe, much more equable, and every one is rich, while no one overflows with wealth. The country, having far leſs wants in that ſerenity with which commerce bleſſes it, is not under the neceſſity of grinding the laborious huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandman; but, on the contrary, is able to encourage him in furniſhing the trading part of the community with thoſe ſupplies of corn and other fruits of the earth which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.—An empire ſtrengthened thus by trade and agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, may give laws to other empires, even on account of its tranquillity. Its neighbours fear it, and inſtead of making inroads on a people who muſt be too powerful for them, ſeek alliance with that people. This alliance draws mankind together, roots out national antipathies, and kindles ſentiments of unity and concord in their ſtead. The prince has only to prevent abuſes in the ſtate. A perfect legiſlation cauſes juſtice and ſtrict order to prevail among his people, and they paſs from individuals to whole ſtates. Trade, arts, and ſciences, may be compared to bridges that extend from one to the other, and on which not only Peace, but Plenty, conſtantly walk to and fro, that they may keep inviolate the happineſs of thoſe whom they have united.</p>

                  <p>Not ſo faſt, Conſtantine; for an undefended ſtate would be expoſed, by reaſon of its riches, to a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of enemies. It ſhould keep up a regulated force in peace, if it would have one in the time of war. But then, inſtead of looking on an unconcerned ſpectator,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0360400703:78"/>while the military quench their ſpirit in debauchery and ſloth, it ſhould aſſign them labours to keep up their ſtrength, and make them uſeful to the ſtate. They ſhould be ſtationed on the public roads, and ſuch as are employed at preſent on them never quit the plow and ſickle: an additional connexion would, in that caſe, forcibly unite them to their country, in that natural propenſity which men feel to value what their induſtry in ſome ſort has created, and the pride with which they are at all times ready to defend it. The ſuperior officer, who ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their labours, would not, we muſt own, obſerve his name recorded in the papers of the day, and no where elſe, for trifling enterpriſes, ſuch as hiſtory deſcends not to perpetuate; but would himſelf engrave it on a pillar, raiſed upon the ſpot where once aſcended a high hill that he ſhould have levelled, on the ſide of a canal or poſt that he ſhould have dug, or at the opening of a bridge that he ſhould have built. The traveller then would come from the remoteſt part of Europe to conſider the magnificence and boldneſs of his toil, his countrymen would bleſs the benefits accruing from it, and a generation not then born, would in future time riſe up, and wonder at its durability. The colour of his coat no longer would excite one thought of bloodſhed, but of gratitude, ſo juſtly due to benefits, and of reſpect invariably paid to the ingenious. His lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure moments would be ſpent in the extenſion of thoſe ſciences which he had formerly ſtudied, and in ſuggeſting plans of policy, reſulting from his obſervations made in different countries. Retiring in the end, to paſs away the reſidue of life on his eſtate with honour, in the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of thoſe benefits which he had communicated to his country, his activity would flouriſh ſtill in agriculture. I even dare propoſe myſelf as an example. I am inclined to think that I have been ſerviceable to my king in India; but ſhall much more boaſt of benefiting for the time to come my native land, by cultivating the inheritance which a father left me, and by giving you, my children, a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming education. I ſhall do my utmoſt to atone for any involuntary violence that I may have done humanity, by being henceforth a protector of the needy round about me; and I hope I ſhall not die without the conſcious ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which a good citizen enjoys, in having carefully diſcharged his duty.</p>

                  <p>Why, Conſtantine, but becauſe they have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately been brought up in prejudices, and not had ſufficient reſolution to correct them? Hitherto, philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers have ſpoken to none but thoſe whoſe underſtandings could not ſee the truth and beauty of thoſe principles which I have happily been taught. Nor is there any hope that men, now come to years of reaſon and reflexion, ſhould be taught to ſee them! ſo that thoſe philoſophers muſt get new pupils. In infancy the future man muſt be prepared. By giving him betimes a tincture of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, beneficence and generoſity, he will obtain, in his maturity, the habit of diſplaying them in every action of his life; and place his glory in contributing, as far as he is able, to that general revolution ſo much to be wiſhed for in behalf of virtue. A young prince poſſeſſed of theſe exalted notions, and perſuaded that the riſing gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration have them too, might rationally hope to govern a new ſort of people, who would certainly afford a model to all other lands. Congratulate yourſelves, dear children, on the circumſtance of being born in thoſe auſpicious times, when children are, not only here, but univerſally throughout all Europe, the peculiar objects whoſe feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city philoſophers are ſtudying to promote; and not they only, but even women—women, notwithſtanding narrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindedneſs delights at all times to diſparage, as it does, their underſtanding. Perhaps for you, and your contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries, is reſerved the happineſs of ſeeing the laſt traces of injuſtice and barbarity effaced among mankind. Thrice happy I, myſelf, if giving now theſe firſt ideas of a ſyſtem of morality, ſo ſimple but ſublime, I take but one ſtep forward in the buſineſs of eſtabliſhing this ſyſtem in your hearts. You will do all that you can to ſecond my endeavours, by communicating my inſtruction to your future children.</p>

               <p>The natural neceſſity of eating was become my puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: I ſwallowed up my meat in haſte, that I might be as little abſent from my gambling partners as I could.</p>

<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0360400703:85"/>my property, or give up my connection with a man whoſe conduct makes his friendſhip infamous, I chuſe to keep my property.</p>
               <p>Immediately on reading this inſulting anſwer, I was utterly beſide myſelf; and ſtill remember, as what hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened yeſterday, the dreadful images which all at once came crowding into my imagination: on the one hand, the diſtreſs and indignation of my father, the diſhonour that I was fixing on my family, as well as on every one that knew me, and the dread of being broke with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famy; on the other hand, the briliant proſpect of that promotion which I might have obtained, by an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able conduct in my poſt: nor did I afterwards recover the poſſeſſion of my underſtanding, but to think of perpetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a new crime, that I might be delivered from that ignominy which my firſt would bring upon me. I was ready to go through with ſuch a deſperate reſolution, when I ſaw the very officer come into my apartment, whoſe reply had hurried me, as I have ſaid juſt now, into this ſtate of madneſs.</p>
               <p>In the firſt emotion of my rage, I fell upon him like a fiend; but he diſarmed me very quickly; and while I but little thought of what was to enſue, embraced me, and began as follows. "I replied a little harſhly to your letter, as I meant, by ſuch an anſwer, that you ſhould ſee the horror of that ſituation into which your raſhneſs has pecipitated you; and I perceive what effect it has up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you. Now therefore that you repent, my property, my life, and every thing that I have, you may command, as you think proper."</p>
               <p>"Here," continued he, and threw his purſe upon the table, "here is what will ſerve to pay your new recruits: and the remainder may ſupply you at the gaming-table, if you mean to return thither."</p>
               <p>Return to the gaming-table! Never, never, anſwered I; and claſped him to my heart.</p>
               <p>Since which, I have preciſely kept my word. From that day forward I determined to have done with all expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive pleaſures, and apply my ſavings to the purpoſe of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paying what my generous friend had lent me. I employed my leiſure time in ſtudy. My attention to the ſervice recommended me to my ſuperiors; and to ſuch a happy
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0360400703:86"/>lution in the courſe of my affairs I am indebted for the honour of my preſent ſtation in the army.</p>
               <p>This recital made ſo powerful an impreſſion on his officers, that every game of hazard ceaſed among them, and a noble emulation to arrive at uſeful knowledge quenched that low ambition of winning money which was their ruling paſſion before. Such was the good conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence reſulting from their prudent colonel's leſſon.</p>

               <p>A Worthy private gentleman, obſerving with concern his only ſon upon the point of taking to a ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrift way of living, let him do as he thought proper; and it was not long before the ſon had run himſelf behind hand to a great amount. I will pay whatever debt you may contract, ſaid the father to him, as my honour is much dearer to me than my money; but take notice of what follows: You love joyous living, and I love the poor. I have given away in charity a great deal leſs than I was uſed to do before I thought of your eſtabliſhment. I will think no longer of it; a libertine ſhould never marry; ſo indulge yourſelf as much as you think proper, but on this condition: I declare, that when, at any time, you ſpend beyond the money which I allow you to keep yourſelf as a gentleman, ſome hoſpital, or other charitable inſtitution, ſhall receive from me as much as you require to ſatisfy your debts; and I will begin this very day. Accordingly the money was that moment ordered to a certain charity; and thus the youth, on being doubly puniſhed for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digality, was quickly cured of a diſeaſe which otherwiſe would have inſured his ruin.</p>

                     <p>WHAT have you to do at Auguſtine's, then?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>I want to have a little converſation with him, Albert; and you know him likewiſe.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Albert.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, by ſight. You have not always been ſo intimate, I fancy, as you are at preſent.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>Not before my father took a lodging here, adjoining his apartments. We ſee one another often now; and laſt night were together for an hour or two, at cards.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Albert.</speaker>
                     <p>I think, of late, you talk of nothing elſe but cards; and I have ſeen you frequently along with Rich and Vyſe, of whom I cannot ſay any good.</p>

                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>That is not, at preſent, in my power. Would you betray me, if I told you ſomething?</p>

                     <speaker>Albert.</speaker>
                     <p>We have long been friends; and would you fear to truſt me, Jonathan?</p>

                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>O my dear good Albert! they have made me miſerable, and engaged me to do things for which my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would renounce me if he knew them. I have not a moment's peace.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Albert.</speaker>
                     <p>Alas! what are they?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>Yeſterday they got me to go with them to a place where one <hi>Crib</hi> waited for them. We ſat down to play, and I loſt all I had.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Albert.</speaker>
                     <p>They cheated you, no doubt. But ſtill there is no great miſchief done; for never play again, and then your loſs will be a gain.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>But this is not the whole. As I had no more money, and ſtill wanted to win back my loſs, I ſtill played on, and in the end they got poſſeſſion of my watch, my coat and waiſtcoat buttons, buckles, and, in ſhort, of every thing that I had worth ſelling. I owe Crib a guinea likewiſe, and he will tell my father, if I cannot find means to pay him to-day.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Albert.</speaker>
                     <p>There is but one thing that you can do. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the whole directly to your father. I am ſure, he will pardon you on your repentance.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Albert.</speaker>
                     <p>What will you do, then?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>Heaven forbid! They only mean to ſerve him juſt as Crib ſerved me; and then we are to ſhare the winnings, ſo that I may pay my debt.</p>

                     <p>No; I mean to ſay, that if I am but ſo lucky as to pay this odious Crib, I will break off all connexion with him and his friends; and never touch a card again. If I ſhould break this promiſe, you ſhall be at liberty to tell my father every thing. <stage>(<hi>Albert ſhakes his head.</hi>)</stage> Yes, every thing. And then, it will not reſt with me to cheat: I cannot if I would, and Crib has taken that upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. I ſhall but play my cards: they have promiſed that I ſhall be no loſer, but divide the profit with them.</p>

                     <p>Mr. Auguſtine does not like to run about as you do, and can entertain himſelf in his apartment.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes; but I have been already walking in the garden, and even breakfaſted with Honoria and my father in the grove.</p>

                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>Not well pleaſed! when he has been three weeks away?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>I love my parents well enough; and yet, if they ſhould take it in their heads to travel, it would not vex me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>And, for my part, I could wiſh my father never out of fight, he is ſo extremely kind!</p>

                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>And mine ſo harſh, I muſt not think of plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure when he is near me.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Albert.</speaker>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>I thought you were in want of nothing on that head. Since we have lodged together, I have almoſt every day obſerved you at the door; and when I have met you in the garden, never could I ſee you under any thing appearing like reſtraint.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>No, no; I have always met you on days when my father dined abroad, and that is the only time that I have to uſe as I think proper; therefore I do turn it to account. But now your father is come home, I take it, we ſhall not ſee you quite ſo often in an evening?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>Why not, Jonathan? He refuſes me no pleaſure that I can aſk. However, I muſt ſay, I find no company like his; and he, too, has frequently ſaid that he thinks my company and Honoria's quite delightful.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>What a charming father! So then he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits you to go out both when and where you like?</p>

                     <speaker>Albert.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>What then do you do for entertainment, when you are both together?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>In the ſummer evenings, frequently we take a walk.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>In winter?</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>We ſit down before the fire, and talk of fifty curious matters; or I ſtudy geography, and take a leſſon in the mathematics. Sometimes too, with Honoria and a friend or two, we act a little drama of ſome kind or other. You cannot think how that amuſes us!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>But ſure ſuch different ſtudies are enough to crack your brain!</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>On the contrary, they come of courſe, as if they were an amuſement.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>A game at cards I ſhould ſuppoſe much more amuſing. Do you ever play?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, truly; and my father frequently makes one.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>And do you play for money?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>Doubtleſs; but a trifle, juſt enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt one in the game; and particularly, as by that, my father ſays, one learns to loſe with temper.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Albert.</speaker>
                     <p>That is quite right; one ought to huſband, as they ſay, one's purſe,</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh! do not imagine that I want money. I have more than I can uſe.</p>

                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>

                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>A crown a week.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>A good allowance, truly! And all that to purchaſe trifles?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, ſuch trifles as my father would not like to have me trouble him about; and that, I muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, makes me much more careful.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Albert.</speaker>
                     <p>I believe ſo. One can hardly chuſe but know the worth of things, when one muſt pay for them one's ſelf.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>True, Albert. And beſides, one naturally ſaves in that caſe, as I myſelf have found it; ſo that what
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0360400703:92"/>with preſents and ſome other matters, I have now five guineas in my pocket, without reckoning ſilver.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>Such a deal! And how can you employ it?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>Have I nothing then to buy? However, I can diſpoſe of it otherwiſe. I pay to have our footman's daughter put to ſchool; and every Monday morning ſend a trifle to a writing-maſter that I had once, and who is now grown blind: theſe, both together, make up ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; and I keep the reſt for ordinary uſes, and among them, for play.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>At which you are tolerably lucky. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, you won half a crown of me the other night, at <hi>One-and-thirty.</hi>
                     </p>

                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>I was ſorry, as I always am, to win of friends.</p>

                     <speaker>Jonathan.</speaker>
                     <p>Then you ſhall have an opportunity at night of loſing, if you think fit. Are you engaged?</p>

                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>No; I ſhall ſtay at home. My father is to draw out a petition for a widow woman, who would get into an alms-houſe.</p>

                     <p>That is well: and mine goes out at five. Come then to me, and I will endeavour to amuſe you. We ſhall have Rich, Vyſe, and Crib.</p>

                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>I will run and aſk my father's leave. Shall you be here when I return?</p>

                     <p>True; but my poor brother, I muſt ſay, is innocent, and ſomewhat credulous: he judges every one to be like himſelf. What would become of him, if thoſe whom he thinks his friends were what they ſhould not be? I have remarked, that you do not much approve of Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than's intimates.</p>

                     <p>To ſay the truth, my dear young lady, I ſhould rather wiſh that Jonathan would be ſatisfied with Auguſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine's friendſhip. There is one advantage, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that his father watches over him, as yours does over Auguſtine, and inſtructs him what to do.</p>

                     <p>I am ſure, you love your brother tenderly, and therefore hear me; but tell nobody that I mentioned what I am going now to ſay. Young Jonathan has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon him, juſt before you entered, to make one with him and his three intimates. They mean to play, no doubt; but do your utmoſt to divert your brother from partaking with them. I deſigned to wait here for his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, but do not think it proper that I ſhould carry it. I make no doubt but he will bring it preſently. Pray do not judge amiſs of me that I retire; and think of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice which my duty, as a friend to Auguſtine, bade me give you.</p>

                     <p>Honoria's remark is not amiſs. One may employ a leiſure evening better than at play, no doubt, if people would be always rational, or even inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently mirthful; but as ſcandal ſometimes will go round, or folly; in ſuch caſe, you know, I bid you play, and often take a part myſelf.</p>

                     <p>If I were any other than your friend, I ſhould not be compleatly qualified to bring you up. I might perhaps connive at your neglecting outward cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of reſpect; but not your failure in that confidence which I expect from your affection.

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Fletcher.</speaker>
                     <p>I have already told you what I think of playing: every thing depends upon the game that you play.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>Oh! it needs no great attention: it is the game of <hi>one and thirty.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Fletcher.</speaker>
                     <p>I confeſs, I do not approve it much.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>Why not? There can be nothing in the world ſo innocent. Whoever is one and thirty, or the neareſt to it, wins.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Fletcher.</speaker>
                     <p>And do you know that it is what we call a game of chance?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>Becauſe one has a chance to win or loſe? and muſt not this be ſaid of every game?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Fletcher.</speaker>
                     <p>With this material difference, that at <hi>one and thirty,</hi> chance alone decides; whereas, in many others, ſkill is to be ſhown. In ſhort, one wants but fingers, and no head for games of chance: and in my thought, ſuch games are utterly unworthy of a thinking man.</p>

                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>Do not ſay ſo, dear ſiſter. There is a deal of pleaſure in expecting ſuch or ſuch a card as one may want.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Fletcher.</speaker>
                     <p>Becauſe the love of money makes it ſo. And as this love of money operates very powerfully, it is a ſtrong temptation for ten thouſand rogues to follow gaming as a trade; and therefore unſuſpecting people ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally are their dupes.</p>

                     <speaker>Honoria.</speaker>
                     <p>I fancy, they muſt have ſome art or other, to arrange the pack in ſuch a way, as to obtain what cards they want.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Fletcher.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, that is in reality their ſecret. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell their method; but am certain, that they do em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy ſome method, and have ſeen deplorable examples of it in my travels.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Mr. Fletcher.</speaker>
                     <p>With a deal of pleaſure. When at Spa, I was acquainted with a young gentleman, who loſt one night above twelve thouſand pounds, which was his all.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Honoria.</speaker>
                     <p>His all! poor youth! and what did he do to live?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>He muſt have been beſide himſelf.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Fletcher.</speaker>
                     <p>Deſpair obtained poſſeſſion of his features, when he ſaw his fortune thus irretrievably loſt. He looked ſo frightful, that I was forced to turn away my ſight; he gnaſhed his teeth, plucked up his hair by handfuls, and beat violently on his breaſt: he gaſped and panted like a dying man, and left the room quite mad.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>And pray, ſir, among thoſe who won his money, was there no one who would give it back, as I ſhould certainly have done?</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Fletcher.</speaker>
                     <p>They kept their ſeats; and ſtill continued playing on: or if they turned off their attention from the cards, it was to look upon him with contempt.</p>
                  </sp>
                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Honoria.</speaker>

                     <speaker>Mr. Fletcher.</speaker>
                     <p>But the worſt part of the ſtory is as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows: That this poor young man deſtroyed himſelf before the morning.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Mr. Fletcher.</speaker>
                     <p>Softly, ſoftly: you are always much too haſty in your reſolutions. One ſhould never wholly give a pleaſure up, becauſe, when carried to exceſs, it may be hurtful. I have often told you, that a game at cards, when friends are met together, is amuſing, innocent, and even uſeful.</p>

                     <speaker>Mr. Fletcher.</speaker>
                     <p>Yes, uſeful; as it teaches us to bear our fortune; and not to triumph when we win, or be dejected at our little loſſes.</p>

                  <sp>
                     <speaker>Auguſtine.</speaker>
                     <p>Heaven be praiſed, I am not ſo fond of money as to hurt another by my inſults in good fortune; or to ſhew that I am hurt myſelf, by being vexed when I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lucky; but to ſhun what poſſibly might happen, it will be better for me not to viſit either Jonathan or his friends.</p>

                     <p>You would only prove your weakneſs, if this ſhould be your final reſolution: for at leaſt you have it in your power, when with them, to refrain from playing.</p>

                     <p>Well, play as much as they would have you, ſince by that means you will gain a better knowledge of them. But inſtead of going to this Jonathan, or his friends, invite them hither. You may alſo tell them that Honoria perhaps will make one.</p>

                     <p>Yes, ſir; for I have told you, Maſter Albert was not long ſince with me. From ſome words which he dropped, I have reaſon to believe that my brother's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany have laid a plot to cheat him of his money.</p>

                     <p>All the better, if he finds himſelf their victim. I will hide myſelf behind the ſummer-houſe there, juſt by that partition, and hear every word of their diſcourſe. They will enter here, and cannot poſſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover me: but in the interim take you care; and if you ſee their roguery, ſeem as if you did not.</p>

                     <p>I ſhall find it hard, ſir, to diſſemble. It will be painful to me, ſhould I ſee my brother prove the object of their ridicule, and fall a victim to his open nature.</p>

                     <p>By himſelf alone can he be fully unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and in that caſe I ſhall with leſs difficulty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade him to be attentive for the future in the choice of his connexions, and ſo cure him likewiſe of his love for gaming, which, I muſt acknowledge, he ſeems ready to adopt as a habit.</p>

                     <p>How, ſir, can he have a thought of going thus to cards? He ought to know himſelf. He is ſo cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous, that every ſharper muſt ſuppoſe him proper for his purpoſe! and ſo warm, that at the firſt ill luck he falls into a paſſion!</p>

I contrive to give you two of thoſe on the top; and afterward, the other from the bottom: ſo that at the moſt you have but five and twenty, and will therefore generally beg. Well then, you have it from the top, and muſt infallibly be out.</p>

               <head>THE MONKEY.</head>
               <p>FRANCIS, and his play-mate Lorenzo, were at the window. As it chanced, they heard a pipe and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor. Looking up the ſtreet, they ſaw a bear approaching ſternly, and a man conducting him by a chain to which the creature was faſtened at the other end. I ſhould be afraid, ſaid Lozenzo, to ſtand too near that animal; for do but liſten, Francis: Did you ever hear ſuch growling? I ſhould quake if I were by him. Oh, he could not hurt you, anſwered Francis; you may ſee, he has a muzzle to prevent his biting.</p>
               <p>They were talking thus, when Bruin was come exactly oppoſite their window, in his progreſs down the ſtreet. Two monkies now took up the little gentlemen's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One was light and nimble, but the other not ſo active. Both were jumping to and fro on Bruin's back, who ſuffered them to play their tricks as if he did not care about it. They had fruit in plenty thrown them by the mob, which they caught in their paws as ſoon as it was flung to them, and ſwallowed almoſt inſtantly. But what delighted them particularly, were the nuts which the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple threw them. Seated on their breech, and holding them between their two fore-paws, they broke the ſhells, and picked the kernels out with ſomething of an air.</p>
               <p>It chanced that a very large one came among the reſt. The heavy monkey raiſed himſelf upon his long hind-legs to get it; but the little one darting forward, ſeized it in the air before it could have time to reach him. Cheated of his prey in this manner by the little one, he gnaſhed his teeth with rage. His front grew wrinkled, and his eyes flaſhed fire: he thruſt his claws out, fell upon the little one, and ſeemed upon the point of tearing him to bits. The bear found it very difficult to ſave him.</p>
               <p>Do you ſee, ſaid Francis to his little friend, how fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that ſame monkey is become ſince firſt he fell into a rage, and how he ſhews his teeth? Oh no, I ſhould not like to be within his reach! How terrible! I ſhould be ſcared to death!</p>
               <p>Indeed? ſaid Lorenzo. Well then, can you imagine it; but yeſterday, when you were in a paſſion, you were like
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0360400703:113"/>him. Look ye, you had all his wrinkles; you even grinned as he does now; your eyes ſhewed what a paſſion you were in, and like the monkey, you ſeemed ready to devour poor little Harry, who had notwithſtanding done you no great harm. I only wiſhed that I could have got a looking-glaſs. Your face was in reality ſo ugly, it would have frightened you.</p>
               <p>Indeed! ſaid Francis. Is it poſſible that I reſembled ſuch an odious beaſt? I could not but have been extremely frightful if I did, and muſt endeavour for the future to be never in a paſſion. When I find myſelf growing angry, I will then bethink me of the monkey, recollect the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice in his countenance, and that will make me ſhudder at the thought of being like him. Do you too, my good friend Lorenzo, if I forget this reſolution, like a friend remind me of it.</p>
               <p>Lorenzo aſſured him that he would do ſo, and was faithful to his promiſe. Francis by degrees got rid en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely of his wrathful habit, or was very rarely in a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. He enjoyed the greater happineſs, and his indulgent parents were not leſs tranſported at his reformation.</p>

               <head>THE ALPS.</head>
               <p>THE ſun was riſing in the heavens. The dew drops which are ſeen on every leaf ſo early in the morning, glittered with the colours of the rainbow; and the ſhadows of the trees were ſhortening on the ground, when Damon, holding his ſon, a grown-up lad, by the hand, came out, and ſat down on his garden terrace, to enjoy the freſhneſs of the morning.</p>
               <p>Deareſt father, ſaid the ſon, pray wake me always at this hour; for I am charmed with contemplating ſuch a ſcene as I now ſee all round me! How delightful the whole proſpect! But perhaps it would be more ſo, were it not confined by younder mountains, which lift up their ſnowy tops ſo high that any one would ſuppoſe them to prop the clouds above them.</p>
               <p>I do not think as you do, ſaid the father. Thoſe ſame mountains leave us ſpace enough, and <hi>that</hi> made up of
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0360400703:114"/>fields and meadows, to contemplate; and by thus conſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as you ſay, the proſpect, help to vary it; and more particularly ſo at evening, when the ſun ſtill tips them with a thouſand ſtreaks of gold, even after the whole level plain is dark.</p>
               <p>When we ſhall once have viſited thoſe mountains, and conſidered its inhabitants, you will be pleaſed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating on them, I am certain, ſince they cannot but ſuggeſt agreeable ſenſations.</p>
               <p>How can men, ſaid the youth, be fond of living on ſuch mountains, covered as they are with ſnow?</p>
               <p>They do not live there, ſaid Damon; you will ſeek in vain to find inhabitants upon the heights: it is at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the mountains that they are ſituated. There are charming vallies ſtretched among them; but before the traveller can obtain them, he diſcerns no proſpect ſave that of barren rocks. This proſpect being paſſed, he comes to wide extended carpets of the greeneſt ſod; he breathes an air embalmed on all ſides by ten thouſand odoriferous flowers that grow there; and his ear is pleaſingly affected by the murmurs of as many ſtreams deſcending from the ſummit of the hills. The ſun, by ſhining on them with his noon day radiance, makes them put on the appearance of the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ighteſt ſilver. And amongſt them, ſome, preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitated from a rock, re-echo when they reach the bottom, and <hi>there</hi> riſe in clouds, as one may ſay, of duſt, that yield a trembling kind of light. Their paſſage is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by a multitude of charming flowers which bloſſom on the margin; and the flowers, whoſe ſtalks wave to and fro, obedient to the breeze that agitates them, and the waters that flow in among them, heighten the delightful proſpect.</p>
               <p>Spring is very late, and harveſt very early, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; whence it happens that the ground brings forth no other ſort of grain than what is ſowed ſome little while before the ſummer, and grows ripe betimes in autumn: hence, too, it comes that the fields are ſhaded by no other trees than thoſe producing cherries, plums, and other early fruit. Here and there the traveller meets with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>am<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ets; and the houſes being made of wood, are ſo much blackened by the ſun, as to afford a very ſtriking contraſt with the ſmiling verdure of the little orchards that ſurround them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0360400703:115"/>In thoſe hamlets live many innocent and happy families, which for the ſpace of five or ſix long months are almoſt buried under ſnow. As long as that ſad ſeaſon laſts, they take the greateſt care imaginable of their little flocks; at times they viſit one another, ſpin the flax which they have gathered before hand, and make different articles of furniture in wood, which they either uſe themſelves, or are ſure to fell for money to their neighbours.</p>
               <p>As ſoon towards ſummer as the ſun has melted that vaſt heap of ſnow which covered all their fields and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and the river that flows through their vallies has completely carried off the water with which their lands were overflowed, all the men begin to cultivate their fields or meadows, and the women labour in their gardens. During ſummer, the induſtrious father of his family re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs to other diſtricts with the produce of his labours, and brings back, in barter for them, thoſe conveniencies of life which are not to be had for money even in his hamlet.</p>
               <p>Many travel upon mules, and croſs their craggy hills along ſuch paths as have been cut through rocks, and thoſe, too, over frightful precipices. They tranſport to very diſtant parts the honey which they have ſtored in autumn, which is univerſally acknowledged to be excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent. They likewiſe traffic in the ſkins of goats, which they entrap while climbing up the rocks, or find among them dead. Another article of merchandize for which they are diſtinguiſhed, is the dormouſe. This animal, benumbed by the exceſſive cold, retains in holes and cavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which ſhe digs for herſelf to ſerve by way of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and in which ſhe lies rolled up almoſt like a ball and on a bed of hay, that heat and life which, with returning ſpring, the ſun expands; and a fourth great object of their commerce is the cryſtal, which they contrive to quarry in the gaps or chaſms of their higheſt rocks. And many, on the other hand, are guides to foreigners who have the curioſity to travel over, and inſpect their frozen moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains.</p>
               <p>I myſelf have been upon them, like many others, guided in my way by one of thoſe good men.—I call them good, in oppoſition to the multitudes that live in towns and civilized ſociety.—But yet they have loſt a great deal of their natural ſimplicity by frequent converſe with ſuch
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0360400703:116"/>foreigners as have employed them for guides. I admired the people, and their way of living; therefore, having ſatisfied my curioſity upon the mountains, I determined to remain among them ſome few days, that I might gain a better knowledge of their manners.</p>
               <p>I muſt let you know what converſation I heard paſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the wife and child of <hi>my</hi> conductor while I lived among them. I was ſitting on the graſs, beneath a pine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree: Julian, my conductor, had that day ſet out before the dawn, to guide two Engliſh gentlemen who came on the preceding evening to inſpect the mountains. It was ſtill broad day-light, but the ſun was rapidly deſcending towards the weſt. The mother aſcended upon a riſing ground; the ſon came after her. They fixed their eyes upon the icy maſſes which advanced their cloggy cliffs on the other ſide of the valley, and the wife began as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>

                  <p>Let us go to yonder rock before us, ſhaded by thoſe trees, and we ſhall ſee much better thence. There we ſhall be able to diſcern more plainly all that quarter of the mountain where my father, I ſuppoſe, muſt be.</p>

                  <p>And perhaps he may be four or five leagues diſtant. Who can tell exactly where he is? I wiſh he would give over wandering thus among the mountains. Never does he ſet out on his journies, but I tremble leſt unfortunately he ſhould not return alive: or elſe come back with broken limbs by falling down upon the ice, or while he ſcales the rocks.</p>

                  <p>I need not tell you that he has promiſed to drive this trade no longer, when the profits which he has made ſhall be enough to buy the little field between our cottage and the <hi>Arva.</hi>—We ſhall then live comfortably, with our flock, our honey, fruits, and field of barley.</p>

                  <speaker>The Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah! dear ſon, I ſhould much rather wiſh to live in leſs abundance, ſo that I might only have more peace of mind. The happy days which we are to have when he has obtained this field, will have been bought too dearly, at the price of that diſtreſs and trouble which theſe his journies coſt. But do not I ſee him? No, not yet. If he ſhould be obliged to ſtay all night upon the ice!— If it—but you have got, I ſee, that ſpying-glaſs which a traveller lately left behind him in our hut, and that brings objects fifty furlongs off as near as if they were but ten. Look therefore if there is nothing to be ſeen. You know the uſe of it extremely well; but I, for my part, not at all.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>The Son.</speaker>
                  <p>I will reſt the end of it on this old trunk. I think, I ſee—yes, mother—ſomething, and it moves.— It is he, I verily believe!—Yes, yes, it is he indeed!— He is walking on the broken flakes of ice that lie near yon big rock, and which laſt month, you know, were ſeparated from it.</p>

                  <speaker>The Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>Let me have the ſpying-glaſs. Quick! quick! perhaps, too, I may ſee him.—I muſt ſhut one eye, you ſay?—I have;—but I diſtinguiſh nothing. Every thing is black.—Stay, ſtay. O now I ſee the rock!—and likewiſe men! and Julian is among them! But I have loſt them now: they are out of ſight: I cannot recover them again. Hold you the glaſs; I ſhall perhaps diſcern them with my naked eye.—Yes, yes, I ſee them. They are coming on, and in the middle of the valley. Julian, I can ſee, comes firſt.</p>

                  <speaker>The Son.</speaker>
                  <p>They ſtop: my father ſticks his pole into the ice before him, and prepares to take a ſpring. There, there! he is up, and down again. No doubt but there was one of thoſe large gaps before him in the ice, of which he has ſo often told us. What can cauſe them?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>The Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not know exactly; but have heard that when the ice below is melted, <hi>that</hi> above it, having no ſupport, gives way, and opens with a noiſe which one may hear a great way off. You have obſerved the great round table in our curate's kitchen? Well, the leg which ſupported it in the middle was much higher than the others, and one day the ſides had many heavy things laid on them. Unexpectedly it ſplit exactly in the middle, and the crack grew wider, till the ſides could reſt upon
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0360400703:118"/>the ſhorter legs. And now I ſuppoſe theſe gaps are ſo occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned likewiſe. But look once again, and ſee what they are doing. They ſeem ſtanding ſtill. The gap ſure does not prevent them from advancing?</p>

                  <speaker>The Son.</speaker>
                  <p>I can ſee their countenances very plainly. They ſeem aſking one another what they ought to do. Ah! now my father takes a ſecond ſpring; and now he is got ſafe over one more gap.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>The Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, yes; I ſee him too. What raſhneſs! He might ſlip in ſpringing, or when over; or he might not poſſibly ſpring far enough, and drop into the gap. He does not take a ſingle ſtep but what he knows, as well as I do, makes my heart ſink within me. He ſhould think that it is not impoſſible but I may ſee him; he ſhould argue within himſelf, and ſay, My wife <hi>does</hi> ſee me, and my danger frights her.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>The Son.</speaker>
                  <p>He is very far, perhaps, from gueſſing what we are about now.</p>

                  <speaker>The Mother.</speaker>

                  <speaker>The Mother.</speaker>

                  <p>My poor child! embrace me. We are now left to ourſelves, and I have nothing in the world to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort me but you. Yes, they have diſappeared indeed; and in a moment too! I did but turn away my eyes to fix them upon you, and in that inſtant they are vaniſhed! An abyſs perhaps has opened under them as they were going on: perhaps they may be toſſing in it, not yet dead, but making unavailing efforts to get out, and calling for aſſiſtance with a voice which no one, to their coſt, is nigh enough to hear. I will haſten to the ſpot: come, follow me, my child! My knees knock one againſt another, and will hardly bear my body up; but I ſhall ſoon find ſtrength ſufficient to go forward. Come; but ſtay a little!
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0360400703:119"/>—Do not you, dear child, ſee ſomething there in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? There, juſt where I point to; at the bottom of you rock?</p>

                  <speaker>The Mother.</speaker>
                  <p>He will come, and I dare hope to ſee him very ſoon. The gentlemen muſt firſt have got out of the frozen valley, and they hide him from us. Doubtleſs it will not be long before we ſee him. Look again, my child.</p>

                  <p>Then ſo much the better. If your father were not following them, or could not, they would hardly do ſo: they would try whatever they were able to aſſiſt him in his danger.</p>

                  <p>Not all; and then, too, they are men, and muſt be ſenſible of people's miſery like others. Would not you ſtretch forth a hand to help your little dog, were he in danger? Would you leave him unaſſiſited?</p>

                  <p>No indeed: but why? becauſe I love him: and do rich men love the poor? I have had money given me by one rich man to fight my play-mate.—Ah! I think I ſee my father now; yes, there he is! yes, yes, indeed; and, as you ſaid, behind the gentlemen.</p>

                  <p>Yes, yes; I ſee him too. Thank God! But ſtill my heart beats grievouſly. I am in a tremble: So let us both ſit down; we will have our eyes fixed on them till they are ſafe on this ſide of the valley; and by that time, as I hope, my agitation will be calmed. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks they come on very quick. No doubt they wiſh to end their journey before day ſhuts in.

Yes, there they are, and they have cleared the precipice, quite cleared it. They are out of danger now: I ſee them: they turn back to view the rock under which they have paſſed, perhaps, without knowing at the time what peril they encountered. They lift their arms up; they are talking to each other; they are looking at ſome object that aſtounds them.</p>

                  <p>They are out of danger; that is enough for me. I ſee them: they have nothing now but level ground remaining. Kiſs me, my dear child! and let us both paſs on to meet your father. But at no time in my life ſhall I forget what I have felt this afternoon. Let us make all poſſible haſte, and beg that he would no more thus venture into danger. We ſhall have the little field, in that caſe, ſomewhat later; or it may be not at all; and it is no matter. We have lived till now without it: our enjoyments have not been on that account the leſs; we have in ſhort been happy, and what more can we deſire? I ſhall not for the future know that he is returning to thoſe frozen regions, without fearing every danger that I know, and ſuch as I can but gueſs. He may, perhaps, be ſafe feated at his eaſe beneath a tree; but I ſhall fancy that I behold him ſtruggling in a gap, and ſtriving to get out. Whatever money he receives from thoſe whom he may conduct,—if he but loves us, he ſhould think that he buys it at a price too dear.</p>

               <p>The mother and the ſon upon this went forward, and I followed them till they had gained the valley. They preſſed on to meet a huſband, and a father; and at laſt, when they obſerved him with the Engliſhmen draw near, they durſt not note him. They ſat down together, let
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0360400703:121"/>him paſs, and then got up and followed ſlowly after. It was not before they reached their cottage, that the wife and ſon ran both to Julian, and together ſunk into his arms. The ſon related every thing which they had both ſeen and feared. The mother did not ſpeak at firſt; but when ſhe ſaw her huſband touched by the affectionate behaviour of his ſon, ſhe once again embraced him and ſhed tears. He promiſed that he would never more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright her by returning to the ice, but cultivate his field in peace.</p>

               <p>COME, ſaid Mr. Glaſſington to Percival his ſon, one beauteous ſummer morning, here is a baſket with ſome cake and currants in it. Let us go and break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt by the river's ſide.</p>
               <p>With all my heart, papa, ſaid Percival, and jumped about for joy. He took the baſket in one hand, and with the other in his father's, haſtened towards the river. Having reached it, they walked on a little way to chuſe a proper place; when Mr. Glaſſington arriving at a very pleaſant ſpot, cried out, Let us ſtop here, Percival; for this methinks will yield us a delightful proſpect, while we ſit and eat.</p>

                  <p>Why, what is the graſs then, but a carpet for the fields? And what a charming one too! It is of a freſher colour, and much downier than any one that we have. Then how ſpacious! it covers every hill, and all the level plain. The lambs repoſe upon it at their eaſe. Think, Percival, what they would have to ſuffer, on a bare or ſtony piece of ground! Their limbs are ſo extremely delicate, they could not but be very quickly injured. They have mothers, but thoſe mothers cannot make them up ſoft feather-beds.

               <head>THE THREE CAKES.</head>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Glaſſington.</speaker>
                  <p>THERE was a little boy named Henry, about your age. His pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents had but lately fixed him at a boarding-ſchool. He was a ſpecial boy, for ever at his book, and happened once to get the higheſt place at exerciſes. His mama was told it. She could no how keep from dreaming of the pleaſure; and when morning came, ſhe got up early, ſent to ſpeak with the cook, and ſaid as follows: Cook, you are to make a cake for Henry, who yeſterday was very
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0360400703:123"/>good at ſchool. With all my heart, replied the cook, and ſet immediately about it. It was as big as—let me ſee,—as big as—as a hat when flapped. The cook had ſtuffed it with nice almonds, large Piſtachio nuts, and candied lemon-peel, and iced it over with a coat of ſugar, ſo that it was very ſmooth, and of a perfect white. The cake no ſooner was come home from baking, than the cook put on her things, and carried it to ſchool. When Henry firſt ſaw it, he jumped up and down like any Merry An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew. He was not ſo patient as to wait 'till they could let him have a knife, but fell upon it tooth and nail.— He ate and ate 'till ſchool began, and after ſchool was over he ate again: at night too it was the ſame thing 'till bed-time. Nay, a little fellow that Henry had for a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, told me that he put the cake upon his bolſter when he went to bed, and waked and waked a dozen times, that he might take a bit. I cannot ſo eaſily believe this laſt particular; but then it is very true, at leaſt, that on the morrow, when the day was hardly broke, he ſet about his favourite buſineſs once again, continuing at it all the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and by noon had ate it up. The dinner bell now rung, but Henry, as one may fancy, had no ſtomach, and was vexed to ſee how heartily the other children ate. It was, however, worſe than this at five o'clock, when ſchool was over. His companions aſked him if he would not play at cricket, taw, or kites. Alas! he could not; ſo they played without him. In the mean time Henry could hardly ſtand upon his legs; he went and ſat down in a corner very gloomy, while the children ſaid one to another, What is the matter with poor Henry, who uſed to ſkip about, and be ſo merry? See how pale and ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful he is! The maſter came himſelf, and ſeeing him, was quite alarmed. It was all loſt labour to interrogate him. Henry could not be brought to ſpeak a ſingle word. By great good luck, a boy at length came forward in the ſecret; and his information was, that Henry's mama had ſent him a great cake the day before, which he had ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed in an inſtant as it were, and that his preſent ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was occaſioned only by his gluttony. On this, the maſter ſent for an apothecary, who ſoon ordered him a quantity of phyſic, phial after phial. Henry, as one would fancy, found it very nauſeous, but was forced to take the whole for fear of dying; which, had he omitted
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0360400703:124"/>it, would certainly have been the caſe. When ſome few days of phyſic and ſtrict regimen had paſſed, his health was re-eſtabliſhed as before; but his mama proteſted that ſhe would never let him have another cake.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Percival.</speaker>
                  <p>He did not merit ſo much as the ſmell of ſuch a thing. But this is but one cake, papa; and you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that there were three, if you remember, in your ſtory.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Glaſſington.</speaker>
                  <p>Patience! patience! here is another cake in what I am now going to tell.</p>
                  <p>Henry's maſter had another ſcholar whoſe name was Francis. He had written his mama a very pretty letter, and it had not ſo much as a blotted ſtroke; in recompence for which ſhe ſent him likewiſe a great cake, and Francis thus addreſſed himſelf: I will not, like that glutton Henry, eat up my cake at once, and ſo be fick as he was: no, I will make my pleaſure laſt a great deal longer. So he took the cake, which he could hardly lift by reaſon of its weight, and watched the opportunity of ſlipping up into his chamber with it, where his box was, and in which he put it under lock and key. At play-time every day he ſlipped away from his companions, went up ſtairs a tip-toe, cut a tolerable ſlice off, ſwallowed it, put by the reſt, and then came down and mixed again with his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions. He continued this clandeſtine buſineſs all the week; and even then the cake was hardly half conſumed. But what enſued? At laſt the cake grew dry, and quickly after mouldy; nay, the very maggots got into it, and by that means had their ſhare; on which account it was not then worth eating, and our young curmudgeon was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to fling the reſt away with great reluctance. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, no one grieved for him.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Percival.</speaker>
                  <p>No indeed; nor I, papa. What, keep a cake locked up ſeven days together, and not give one's friend a bit! That is monſtrous! But let us have the other now.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Glaſſington.</speaker>
                  <p>There was another little gentleman who went to ſchool with Henry and Francis likewiſe, and his name was Gratian. His mama ſent <hi>him</hi> a cake one day, becauſe ſhe loved him, and indeed he loved her alſo very much. It was no ſooner come, than Gratian thus addreſſed his young companions: Come and look at what mama has ſent me; you muſt every one eat with me.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0360400703:125"/>They ſcarce needed ſuch a welcome piece of information twice, but all got round the cake, as you have doubtleſs ſeen the bees reſorting to a flower juſt blow. As Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian was provided with a knife, he cut a great piece off, and then divided it into as many ſhares as he had brought boys together by ſuch a courteous invitation. Upon this he ranged them in a circle, and beginning with the boy who then ſtood next him, he went round, diſtributing to each his portion, 'till the ſhares were all diſpoſed of in this manner. Gratian then took up the reſt, and told them that he would eat his piece next day; on which he put it up, and went to play with his companions who were all ſolicitous to have him chuſe whatever game he thought might entertain him moſt.</p>
                  <p>A quarter of an hour had ſcarcely paſt as they were playing, when a poor old man, who had a fiddle, came into the yard. He had a very long white beard, and being blind, was guided by a little dog who went before him with a collar round his neck. To this a cord was faſtened, which the poor blind man held in his hand. It was noticed with how much dexterity the little dog con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him, and how he ſhook a bell which, I forgot to ſay, hung underneath his collar, when he came near any one, as if he had deſigned to ſay by ſuch an action, Do not throw down or run againſt my maſter. Being come into the yard, he ſat him down upon a ſtone, and hearing ſeveral children talking round him, May dear little gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, ſaid he, I will play you all the pretty tunes that I know, if you will give me leave. The children wiſhed for nothing half ſo much. He put his violin in tune, and then thrummed over ſeveral jigs, and other ſcraps of muſic, which it was eaſy to conjecture had been new in former times. Little Gratian ſaw that while he played his merrieſt airs, a tear would now and then roll down his cheeks, on which he ſtooped to aſk him why he wept? Becauſe, ſaid the muſician, I am very hungry. I have no one in the world that will give my dog or me a bit of any thing to eat. I wiſh I could but work, and get for both of us a morſel of ſomething, but I have loſt my ſtrength and ſight. Alas! I laboured hard till I was old, and now I want bread. The generous Gratian hearing this, wept too. He did not ſay a word; but ran to fetch the cake which he had deſigned to eat himſelf. He
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0360400703:126"/>brought it out with joy, and as he ran along, began. Here, good old man, here is ſome cake for you. Where? replied the poor muſician, feeling with his hands; where is it! for I am blind, and cannot ſee you. Gratian put the cake into his hand, when laying down his fiddle on the ground, he wiped his eyes, and then began to eat. At every piece he put into his mouth, he gave his faithful little dog a bit, who came and ate out of his hand; and Gratian, ſtanding by him, ſmiled with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at the thought of having fed the poor old man when he was hungry.</p>

               <head>THE SUN AND MOON.</head>
               <p>WHAT a charming evening! Come, Alexis, ſaid Mr. Wilmot to his little boy; the ſun is juſt ready to go down. How glorious he appears! We may behold him now. He does not dazzle us ſo much at preſent as he did at noon, when he was up ſo very high. How beautiful, too, the clouds ſeem round about him! They are of a purple, gold and ſcarlet colour! But behold how ſwiftly he deſcends! Already only half his orb is viſible. And now he is wholly vaniſhed. Rarewell ſun; you have left us for the preſent till to-morrow morning.</p>
               <p>Look, Alexis, towards that quarter of the heavens juſt oppoſite to where the ſun deſcended. What may that be ſhining ſo behind the trees? a fire? No, nothing like it, but the moon. How large and red it is! One would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it full of blood! This evening it is quite round, on as they ſay, full moon. It will not be quite ſo round to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow evening; leſs ſo the next evening; leſs the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after; and ſo on, decreaſing ſomething every evening, till at laſt it will be in ſome ſort like a wire bent round into a ſemicircle, when a fortnight is gone.</p>
               <p>It will then be new moon, and from day to day you will obſerve it afterward grow bigger, and ſeem rounder, till in fourteen days more it will be again full moon, and riſe as it does now behind the trees.</p>
               <p>But pray, papa, inform me, how do both the ſun and moon preſerve their ſituations unſupported in the air? I always fear they cannot but fall down upon my head.</p>
               <p>Fear nothing, dear Alexis: there is no danger. I will explain the reaſon why, when you can underſtand the matter; ſo at preſent only liſten while I mention how the ſun and moon addreſs you.</p>
               <p>To begin then with the ſun: He ſays as follows: I am King of day. I riſe, or make my firſt appearance in the Eaſt; and what they call Aurora, or the dawn, precedes me, that mankind may know of my approach. I tap ſoon after at your window with a golden beam of light, to warn you of my preſence. Riſe, I ſay, riſe lazy-boots.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0360400703:130"/>I never ſhine, that men may lie a bed and ſnore. I ſhine that they may wake, get up, aad go to work.</p>
               <p>I am the mighty traveller; and I run rejoicing like a giant, quite acroſs the heavens, without ever ſtopping; for at no time am I weary.</p>
               <p>I have a crown of glorious radiance on my head. I ſhed this radiance round about me to a vaſt extent, and even over half the univerſe. Wherever I am preſent, all things are beautiful and bright.</p>
               <p>I give heat too, as well as light. It is I who ripen with my beams the fruit in gardens, and the corn that grows in fields. If I ſhould ceaſe a moment to aſſiſt the courſe of nature, nothing then could grow, and famiſhed men would die of deſpair, in all the horrors of that darkneſs which you yourſelf dread ſo much.</p>
               <p>I am higher than the hills and clouds. I ſhould but need to come down a little towards the earth, and my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring flame would burn it up as ſoon as you have ſeen the ſtraw conſumed which men toſs in bundles into a furnace.</p>
               <p>What a length of time has paſſed ſince firſt I gladdened the whole univerſe! Alexis, you were hardly in the world ſix years ago, but I was. I was in it when your dear papa was born, and many thouſand years before; and I am not grown old yet.</p>
               <p>At times I lay aſide my crown of radiance, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round my head with ſilver clouds. It is not ſo difficult to view me then; but when I diſſipate thoſe clouds about me, and burſt forth in all my noon-day ſplendor, you could never bear the blaze: ſhould you attempt to bear it, I ſhould blind you. There is but one living creature that can look at me, and that living creature is the eagle, whom the birds confeſs their monarch. He can contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate my glory with a ſteady eye wide open, while he views me.</p>
               <p>This ſame eagle, darting from the ſummit of ſome ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated mountain, ſhapes his progreſs towards me with a towering wing, and ſoon is loſt amid my beams, through which he darts to pay me homage every minute of the day. The lark, ſuſpended in the air a great deal lower, ſings, while I am riſing, his beſt ſong, and wakes the other bird, that ſlumber in ten thouſand trees. The cork,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0360400703:131"/>remaining on the ground, proclaims the time of my return to mortals with a piercing voice. But, on the other hand, the bat and owl avoid my preſence: they fly from me with a plaintive cry, and haſten to take refuge in the ruins of thoſe towers which I once ſaw proudly riſing, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mineering afterward for many ages over ſpacious countries, and then finking with the burthen of old age.</p>
               <p>My empire is not limited, like that of earthly monarchs, to a corner of the world. The univerſe at large is my dominion; and beſides, I am the moſt illuſtrious object that was ever gazed at.</p>
               <p>But the moon ſays, in the next place, with a voice not half ſo much exalted as the ſun's, I am the queen of night. I ſend my ſilver beams to give you light, as often as the ſun withdraws at evening from the world.</p>
               <p>You may keep looking at me without danger; for I am never ſo reſplendent as to dazzle the ſpectator, much leſs do I burn. I am ſo good natured that I let poor glow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worms blaze among the hedges, which the ſun, unpitying as he is, will not.</p>
               <p>The ſtars ſhine round about me; but I myſelf am far more luminous than any ſtar: nay, all the ſtars together give not ſo much light as I do: and I ſeem among their multitude as if I were a fair round pearl, ſurrounded by ten thouſand little diamonds.</p>
               <p>When you lie aſleep, I dart a beam of ſilver brightneſs through your curtains; and my words are, Sleep on, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle friend, in ſafety. You are tired. I will not diſturb your ſlumber.</p>
               <p>You have heard the nightingale. <hi>She</hi> ſings for me, who ſings much better than all other birds. She perches on a ſpray, and fills the foreſt with her muſic, no leſs ſweet and gentle than my brightneſs, while the dew de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends on every flower, and all is calm and ſilent in my empire.</p>

               <head>THE ROSE-BUSH.</head>
               <p>WHO will give me ſome nice tree or other for my garden? ſaid little Frederic one day to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Auguſtus and Jaſper, and his ſiſter Jemima.</p>
               <p>(Their papa had given them each a little bit of ground to ſew or plant, as they thought proper.)</p>
               <p>Oh not I, ſaid Auguſtus; not I, ſaid Jaſper.</p>
               <p>Well then, I will, anſwered Jemima. Let me know what fort of trees you would like?</p>
               <p>A roſe-buſh, cried Frederic. Do but look at mine: it is the only one now left me; and the leaves, as you may ſee, are turned quite yellow.</p>
               <p>Come then, ſaid the lively Jemima, come and chuſe one for yourſelf. On which ſhe led him to a little ſpot of ground that ſhe cultivated; and the moment they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, pointing with her finger to a charming roſe-buſh, told him he had nothing elſe to do, than take it up im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Frederic.</speaker>
                  <p>How, ſiſter! you have only two, and wiſh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides to give me up the fineſt! No, no; here is the leaſt, and juſt ſuch as I want.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jemima.</speaker>
                  <p>You do not know how much pleaſure I ſhall feel, if you will but take the other, Frederic. This may ſcarce produce you any flowers next ſummer; but the other will, I am certain: and you know, I ſhall be pleaſed as much with looking at it elſewhere, when full blown, as if it had continued in my garden.</p>
                  <p>Frederic overjoyed, approached the roſe-buſh, took it up; and Jemima, much more pleaſed, aſſiſted in the tranſplantation.</p>
                  <p>It appears that the gardener noticed this ſurpriſing piece of kindneſs in the little girl. Away he ran, ſelected from a number of young Windſor pear-trees, one which he thought the fineſt, and immediately conveyed it into Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mima's garden, planting it exactly in the ſpot which the roſe-buſh had poſſeſſed before.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who have a churliſh nature hardly ever are aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous: therefore when the ſummer months were come, Jaſper and his brother having never attended their roſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0360400703:133"/>plants, they promiſed no great quantity of flowers; and to increaſe their diſappointment, the chief part of thoſe which they thought were coming, periſhed in the bud; while on the contrary Frederic's roſe-buſh, in conſequence of great attention paid it by himſelf and Jemima, bore the fineſt centfoil roſes that the whole county could boaſt; and as long as it remained in flower, the happy Frederic always had a roſe to ſtick in Jemima's boſom, and another for himſelf to ſmell.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe did the Windſor pear-tree thrive ſurpriſingly: it ſcattered a delicious perfume over all the garden, and ſoon grew ſo thick and lofty as to yield a tolerable um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brage. Jemima uſed to come and take her ſeat beneath it, when the ſun was hotteſt; as her father alſo did, when he would tell her charming ſtories, ſome of which would make her all at once burſt out a laughing till her ſides even ached again; and others produced ſuch agreeable melancholy in her, that ſoon after ſhe would ſmile with pleaſure at the recollection of her ſorrow.</p>
                  <p>Here is one that he told her for her generoſity towards Frederic; by which ſtory ſhe was thoroughly convinced that ſuch as we oblige can recompence our generoſity; which circumſtance, he ſaid, without adverting to the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of our hearts, muſt be a ſtrong incentive to kind actions.</p>

               <head>THE NOSEGAYS.</head>
               <p>LITTLE Gerald went out one morning with his neighbour Eugene, to divert themſelves by gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing flowers. Their eagerneſs would not allow them to diſpatch their breakfaſt in the houſe: they took it with them in their hands.</p>
               <p>They met a beggar-woman in the way, who had a child apparently expiring, as it were, with hunger.</p>
               <p>My dear little maſter, ſaid the woman, looking upon Gerald, who happened to be firſt, for heaven's ſake give my child a morſel of your bread. He has not had a bit of any thing to eat ſince yeſterday.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0360400703:134"/>It may be ſo, ſaid Gerald; but I am very hungry like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and went forward, munching all the way.</p>
               <p>Now what was Eugene's conduct? He was no leſs hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, we muſt think, than his companion; but beholding how the poor child cried, he gave up his bread and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and received a hundred bleſſings which God heard in heaven.</p>
               <p>But this is not the whole. The little boy, revived by what the charitable Eugene had beſtowed upon him, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly began to run before his benefactor, brought him to a meadow, where he knew there was a multitude of flowers, and helped to make up ſo magnificent a bow-pot, that the pleaſant ſmell proceeding from it made him quite forget his trouble.</p>
               <p>Eugene, after this, went home and ſhewed it with a deal of pleaſure; for not only was the ſweetneſs of it very grateful, but its ſize was ſuch that he might eaſily have hid his face behind it.</p>
               <p>Next day likewiſe they went out, and then another little boy, whoſe name was Watty, met them.</p>
               <p>After having taken half a dozen turns with Gerald and Eugene in the meadow, Watty, looking down, perceived his buckle loſt, and begged them both to aſſiſt him in ſearching for it. Oh, ſays Gerald, I cannot ſpare time enough for that at preſent, and went on; but Eugene ſtopped immediately, that he might be of ſervice to his little friend.</p>
               <p>He walked a long while up and down, both ſtooping all the way, and patting with his hand, to try if he could feel it in the graſs: and had at laſt the happineſs to find it.</p>
               <p>Watty too was happy; and they ſet about the buſineſs which had brought them thither.</p>
               <p>Watty, out of gratitude, beſtowed the fineſt flowers of thoſe which he had gathered, upon Eugene; but paid no regard to Gerald, who had refuſed to help him; ſo that Eugene had that day alſo, a finer bow-pot than Gerald, and came back as ſatisfied as he was diſcontented.</p>
               <p>Gerald ſuppoſed the third day he might prove more lucky: He preceded Eugene, and defied him to collect a finer bow-pot than he ſhould. But hardly were they come into the meadow, when behold the little boy who had
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0360400703:135"/>been fed by Eugene, came to meet him with a baſket full of flowers which, it ſeems, he had gathered that morning.</p>
               <p>Gerald would have begun to gather for himſelf; but how was he to find the flowers? The little boy had got up earlier by a deal than he; and therefore he had ſtill leſs flowers that day than either of the two preceding.</p>
               <p>They were going home, but met little Watty.</p>
               <p>My dear friend, ſaid he to Eugene, I have not forgot the ſervice that you did me yeſterday, and have taken ſuch a liking to you, that I could wiſh to be at all times in your company. Papa too, though he never ſaw you, has the ſame ideas in your favour, and has bid me come and fetch you to his houſe this morning: He deſigns to tell us merry ſtories, and afterwards will play with us.</p>
               <p>I will take you to a garden here hard by us, where we are allowed to walk, and there you will find four or five companions of my age to welcome you; when we are all together we will play at whatever game you like.</p>
               <p>Eugene inſtantly laid hold of Watty's hand, and flew like lightning with him towards the garden. As for Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald, poor fellow! he went home quite melancholy. Watty had not once invited him.</p>
               <p>He learned by theſe three days adventures, but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly by the laſt, how much one gains by kindneſs and aſſiſtance granted to others. He reformed his churliſh temper; and would certainly, in time, have ſhown him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as courteous to the full as Eugene, if this laſt, by having exerciſed a friendly diſpoſition from his cradle, had not conferred his favours with a greater grace.</p>

                  <speaker>Viola.</speaker>
                  <p>I reſolved, you know, to bring them up before they well had broken the ſhell; ſo they are my children, and I cannot part with them.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Maddiſon.</speaker>
                  <p>True, my dear: but do you think that your brother will be pleaſed with ſuch a gift? for not to mention that he can never wear it long, I fancy you re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, when you had it firſt, you did not like it much yourſelf, and put it careleſsly into a drawer, as what you had no wiſh to ſee again; and this your brother knew, and cannot but remember when you bring it out.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Maddiſon.</speaker>
                  <p>No, my dear: that only can be called a pretty preſent, which we ſhould be glad to keep, and which they party ſo obliged would equally be glad to have.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Viola.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Maddiſon.</speaker>
                  <p>No: juſt as much, or juſt as little, as you pleaſe; provided what you give appears to be a token of your friendſhip.</p>

                  <speaker>Viola,</speaker>
                  <p>
                     <stage>(<hi>after a little reflexion.</hi>)</stage> Well, well, I will make up a noſegay of my fineſt orange bloſſoms, and preſent it to Henry, with my lamb.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Maddiſon.</speaker>
                  <p>Well fancied! ſuch a gift will ſhew him your affection, ſince he knows that you would be very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to keep the lamb yourſelf.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Viola.</speaker>
                  <p>Nor yet, mama, is this the whole; for every day I will take a walk out with my brother, that the lamb may uſe itſelf to follow him, as well as me. The little creature in this manner will be quite familiar with my brother, when I give him away; and my brother will love him the better.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mrs. Maddiſon.</speaker>
                  <p>Come my deareſt, and embrace me. Be aſſured, this delicate attention will encreaſe the value of your preſent. Thus the mereſt trifle may become a valuable object, when beſtowed with ſuch a grace. You could not give your brother, or even me, ſuch joy with any other preſent.</p>
                  <p>Nor myſelf, mama, replied Viola, with vivacity.</p>
                  <p>You will be happier ſtill, continued Mrs. Maddiſon, when once the birth-day comes; becauſe, as I muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute ſomething, I intend that you ſhall perform the honours, for me, of a little cold collation to be ſerved up in the garden, for your brother, and ſuch friends as he may wiſh to have invited.</p>
                  <p>Hearing this, the little lady kiſſed her mother's hand with ardour, and immediately ran off to make up half a dozen artificial roſes, with a crimſon ribbon which ſhe had by her. And with thoſe roſes ſhe intended to dreſs out the lamb on her brother's birth-day, when ſhe made him ſo affectionate a preſent.</p>

               <head>THE CHIMNEY-SWEEPER.</head>
               <p>A Silly ſervant maid had poſſeſſed the imagination of her maſter's children with a hundred fooliſh tales of ſpirits, and particularly of a black-faced goblin, as ſhe called it.</p>
               <p>Antonia, one of theſe poor children, for the firſt time in her life, beheld a chimney-ſweeper knocking at her father's door. She made a lamentable outcry, and betook herſelf for refuge to the firſt apartment that ſhe found open, which apartment was the kitchen.</p>
               <p>Hardly had ſhe hid herſelf behind a table, when the black-faced man came in, as if, in her imagination, he had meant to follow her.</p>
               <p>This frightened her a ſecond time; and up ſhe ran into a pantry, higher than the kitchen floor by half a dozen ſteps, and not a great way from the fire place: where ſhe thought ſhe ſhould be ſafe from danger, in a corner.</p>
               <p>She had hardly come, however, to herſelf, when ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſhe heard the frightful fellow ſinging in the chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and, with bruſh and ſcraper, making all the while a rattling noiſe againſt the bricks about him.</p>
               <p>Being ſeized with terror, ſhe jumped up, and leaping through a window, which was rather low, into the garden, ran quite breathleſs towards an arbour at the bottom of it, where ſhe fell half dead, and almoſt void of motion, cloſe beſide a tree.</p>
               <p>Though ſhe had changed her ſituation by ſo great a diſtance, yet hardly did ſhe venture to look about her; when by chance ſhe ſaw the black-faced man appear again, and wave his bruſh about him, at the chimney-top.</p>
               <p>On this, Antonia almoſt ſplit her throat with crying out, Help! help!</p>
               <p>Her father heard the cry, and running towards the arbour, aſked what ailed her, that ſhe cried out ſo! An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonia had not ſtrength ſufficient to articulate a ſingle word, and therefore, keeping ſilence, pointed to the place where Grim was then ſitting aſtride, and flouriſhing his bruſh.</p>
               <p>Her father ſmiled; and to convince her what ſmall cauſe ſhe had for terror, waited till the chimney-ſweeper
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0360400703:139"/>was come down. He then bade him be called, and cleaned a little in Antonia's preſence; after which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out explaining matters any further, he ſent up into the houſe to fetch his barber, who, it happened, was then waiting for him, and who conſequently had his face all over white with powder.</p>
               <p>She was heartily aſhamed of having feared ſo much, without occaſion; and her father took this opportunity of giving her to underſtand, that there were whole nations, in a certain quarter of the globe, all over black by nature, but not therefore to be dreaded by white children; ſince theſe laſt were, in another country, generally nurſed by women purchaſed of thoſe nations, without loſing any of their whiteneſs.</p>
               <p>Ever afterwards, Antonia was the firſt to laugh at ſilly ſtories, told by ſilly people, of hobgoblins and the like, to fright her.</p>

               <head>THE CHERRIES.</head>
               <p>JOHANNA and Felix one day got permiſſion, from their dear mama, to take a turn or two about the garden, by themſelves: they had deſerved this confidence placed in them, by their paſt diſcretion.</p>
               <p>They amuſed themſelves, by playing for a time toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, with that decent gaiety by which it is eaſy to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh young children who have been well brought up.</p>
               <p>Againſt the garden wall grew many fruit-trees, and among them a young cherry-tree, which had no earlier than the year before been grafted, and was now in fruit. Its fruit indeed was very little; but on that account, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps much the finer.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Dutton, their mother, did not want to gather them, though ripe. She kept them for her huſband's eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who that very day was to return from York where buſineſs had a long time kept him.</p>
               <p>As the children were accuſtomed to obedience, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden once for all to gather any kind of fruit, or pick up even ſuch as they might find upon the ground, to eat
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0360400703:140"/>it, without aſking leave, ſhe thought it uſeleſs to ſay any thing about this cherry-tree.</p>
               <p>When Johanna and Felix were fatigued with running up and down the terrace, Come, ſaid Felix, let us do ſomething elſe now; upon which they joined their hands, and walked ſedately towards the bottom of the garden, caſting every now and then a look of appetite upon the fruit with which the eſpaliers were loaded.</p>
               <p>They were ſoon come up to this late grafted tree. A little blaſt of wind had ſhook the fineſt cherries from it, and they lay upon the ground cloſe by. Young Felix was the firſt to ſee them. He advanced his foot, ſtooped down, and picked them up, ate ſome, and gave Johanna ſome, who are them likewiſe.</p>
               <p>They had not yet flung the ſtones away, when as it chanced, Johanna recollected her mama's command to eat no fruit but what ſhe might think fit to give her.</p>
               <p>Ah! ſaid ſhe to Felix, we have diſobeyed mama by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any of theſe cherries, and ſhall make her angry with us, when ſhe comes to know it. What had we beſt do?</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Felix.</speaker>
                  <p>Why need mama know any thing about it? We may hold our tongues.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Johanna.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no; ſhe needs muſt know it, brother. She frequently forgives us the greateſt faults that we can commit, when we confeſs them of ourſelves.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Felix.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, yes; but in this inſtance we have diſobeyed her, and ſhe never yet forgave us diſobedience.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Johanna.</speaker>
                  <p>When ſhe puniſhes our faults, I need not tell you, brother, it is becauſe ſhe loves us; and in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of being puniſhed, we are not ſo very likely to forget, as otherwiſe we ſhould, what we may do, and what we may not.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Felix.</speaker>
                  <p>True, but ſhe is always ſorry when ſhe puniſhes our faults, and being ſorry, ſhe is unhappy: ſo I ſhould not like to ſee mama unhappy, which would be the caſe did ſhe but know what we have done.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>Neither ſhould I wiſh to ſee my mama unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; but would ſhe not be much more ſo, upon diſcovering that we had wiſhed to bide our faults? Should we be bold enough to look her in the ſate while we were ſecretly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by our own hearts? or rather, ſhould we not be quite aſhamed to hear her call us her dear children, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as we muſt, how little we deſerve it?</p>

                  <p>Ah, my deareſt ſiſter! you have quite convinced me; and indeed we ſhould, in that caſe, be two little monſters: therefore let us go to her, and acknowledge what we have done.</p>
                  <p>They kiſſed each other, and went hand in hand to their mama's apartment.</p>
                  <p>Dear mama, began Johanna, we have diſobeyed you, and not remembered what you forbade us. Puniſh me and Felix as we merit, but pray do not be angry with us; we ſhould both be quite uneaſy were our fault to make you ſorry or unhappy.</p>
                  <p>She related, in the next place, what her brother and her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had done, without endeavouring to excuſe the action.</p>
                  <p>Mrs. Dutton was ſo affected with the openneſs of Felix and Johanna, that a tear of tenderneſs and love eſcaped her. She could not reſolve on puniſhing their fault, but generouſly overlooked it. She well knew that children of a happy diſpoſition are more powerfully wrought on by the recollection of a mother's kindneſs, than by that of her ſeverity.</p>

               <head>THE LITTLE PRATER.</head>
               <p>LEONORA was endued with ſpirit and vivacity. When ſcarcely ſix years old, ſhe was exceedingly well practiſed in the art of managing her needle, and could very cleverly employ her ſciſſars. All the garters that her papa and brothers wore were of her making. She could read with eaſe in any book that ſhe happened to take up; her writing was alſo extremely neat and fair. She did not huddle great and little letters in one word to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, neither did they lean ſome this and others that way; and her lines went ſtrait along, not dancing up and down from one ſide of her paper to the other, as I have too often ſeen in many children's writing-books, even older by a year or two than Leonora.</p>
               <p>Her papa too, and mama, were no leſs ſatisfied with her obedience, than her maſters with her diligence and ſtudy. She kept up a perfect union with her ſiſters, treated every ſervant with the greateſt affability, and her companions with regard and condeſcenſion. All her parents' friends,
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0360400703:142"/>and every ſtranger that came there a viſiting, were equally enchanted with her company and converſation.</p>
               <p>Who would think, that with ſo many recommendatory qualities, and ſo much underſtanding, any little girl could poſſibly be ſo unfortunate that none, when they grew ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted at the houſe, could bear her? Such was Leonora, notwithſtanding; for a ſingle fault which ſhe had unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily contracted, was ſo great as to deſtroy the effect of all her juvenile accompliſhments. The intemperance of her tongue made every one forget the graces of her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the goodneſs of her heart. In ſhort, our Leonora was the greateſt prater living.</p>
               <p>When, for inſtance, ſhe was ſitting down to work, one might have heard her ſay, Oho! I fancy, it is high time that I ſhould be doing ſomething! What would my mama ſay, ſhould ſhe find me ſitting with my arms acroſs, a lol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling on my elbows?—O my ſtars! how much I have got to hem here? all this apron! But at worſt, I never let the graſs grow under me when I ſet out, and I ſhall ſoon have done. Ah! there the clock ſtrikes: One, two, three, four, five, ſix, ſeven, eight, nine—Yes, poſitively nine o'clock! Well then, I have but two poor hours before I go to muſic; yet a deal of buſineſs may be done in ſuch a length of time. Mamma, when ſhe obſerves how diligent I have been, will be ſure to give me ſweetmeats.—Oh! what pleaſure I ſhall have in looking at them! Nothing do I love like nice criſped almonds. Not that I do not like egg plumbs preſerved: they are very good too, for papa popped one into my mouth laſt Thurſday, and then gave me a whole bagfull; but I think criſped almonds better.—I ſhould like to ſee Miſs Dolly this morning: I would ſhew her the fine petticoat that mama has bought me. Dolly is a funny little girl enough! I like her vaſtly. Oh! but ſhe loves talking, and I do not know how it happens, but one cannot thruſt a word in when her clap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is ſet a going. Where has my thimble hid itſelf? Siſter, have you ſeen my thimble? Patty muſt have ſurely loſt it for me, when ſhe came to ſweep the parlour.—It is ſo like her! ſhe is always ſuch a hairbrained creature! Who can work without a thimble? at leaſt I never take a ſtitch, if I miſlay it; for the needle pricks one's finger, and one's finger bleeds of courſe; and then, beſides the pain it gives one, how one's work looks when it is ſpotted
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0360400703:143"/>with red marks! Why, Patty! Patty! where can you be! Have you ſeen my thimble? Oh, no! here it is; and, juſt as if the matter were contrived on purpoſe, at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of my work-bag.</p>
               <p>Thus the little creature would be always dinning peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's ears who happened to be near her. When her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents were engaged in any intereſting converſation with each other, ſhe would come and mix in their diſcourſe, by prating upon twenty different ſubjects. And at din<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſhe had hardly ever ended with her meat, before the pie or pudding was on the table. She would really forget to eat and drink, while everlaſtingly employed in prating.</p>
               <p>Her papa would frequently reprove her twenty times a day for this defect; but all reproof was loſt upon her, neither would the greateſt puniſhment produce a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in her conduct. As it was not poſſible for any one to hear himſelf when ſhe was by, Miſs Chatterbox was often ſent to paſs the morning all alone in her apartment. Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring dinner, they would put her at a little table by her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as diſtant from the company as they could place her. Leonora ſeemed afflicted at this ſeparation, but was not a whit the more ſilent on that account. She had always ſome ſubject of diſcourſe, were it even addreſſed only to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and, nevertheleſs, ſhe talked ſo loud every word that ſhe ſaid was heard; for, it was the ſame to her if any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy was or was not by her: and I verily believe, that, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than be mute, ſhe would have entered into converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with her knife and fork.</p>
               <p>From ſuch a fooliſh habit, what advantage did ſhe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? The ſtory tells us, only puniſhment and hatred. If you ſhould not be convinced of this by what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready mentioned, you will certainly be ſo when you read what follows:</p>
               <p>Once upon a time, her parents were invited to go down into the country for a week or fortnight, by a friend. It was in autumn, the weather was extremely fine, and it is not eaſy to conceive what great abundance there was then of every kind of fruit, pears, apples, nectarines and peaches.</p>
               <p>Leonora thought it was deſigned to make her of the party, but ſtood very much ſurpriſed when her papa, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting both her ſiſters to get ready for the journey, told
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:0360400703:144"/>her that ſhe muſt ſtay at home. She fell a crying, ran to her mama, and ſaid, My dear mama, what fault have I committed, that papa ſhould be ſo angry with me?— Your papa, ſhe anſwered, is not angry with you; but believe me it is impoſſible for any one to bear your conſtant chatter. You would certainly interrupt our pleaſure, and the pleaſure of the family that we are now going to viſit; and therefore for the future, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we go abroad, we muſt always leave you behind us.</p>
               <p>Muſt I never ſpeak, then? anſwered Leonora.</p>
               <p>That, ſaid her mama, would be no leſs a fault than what we wiſh to ſee you cured of. You are not to be entirely mute; but then you ought to wait 'till you perceive that your turn for ſpeaking is come round, and not inceſſantly prevent your parents, and as many as have more experience than yourſelf, from talking. You ſhould alſo take care how you ſay whatever comes into your head. When you deſire to be informed of any thing which it is not improper you ſhould know, you ought to aſk in as few words as poſſible, and having any thing to tell, you ſhould, in that caſe, firſt of all reflect within yourſelf, if thoſe about you would or would not like to hear it.</p>
               <p>Leonora, thought ſhe could not reaſonably call in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this advice, would not have wanted words to juſtify her prating, if ſhe had not heard that moment her papa call out that every thing was ready; and, in fact, the coach was off that very inſtant.</p>
               <p>Leonora fell a ſighing, and with tears purſued the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage 'till her eye no longer could diſcern it. When it was wholly out of ſight, ſhe went into a corner, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to weep moſt bitterly. Ah, babbling goſſip! ſaid ſhe, <stage>(<hi>now ſpeaking to herſelf,</hi>)</stage> it is all owing to my long tongue that I have been thus puniſhed. I will take care, that for the future it ſhall never ſpeak a word more than it ought.</p>
               <p>Some few days afterwards they returned. Leonora's ſiſters brought home with them baſkets full of pears and apples. They were both exceedingly well tempered; therefore Leonora would on no account have gone without her ſhare, but then the tears that ſhe had been ſhedding
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0360400703:145"/>ſo completely took away her appetite, that it is not to be wondered if ſhe did not wiſh for any. She that moment ran to her papa, imploring his pardon for her fault in having forced him, (as ſhe knew,) much againſt his will, to puniſh her. We have been both unhappy, added ſhe; but for the future I ſhall take care, and never ſpeak too much.</p>
               <p>Her father tenderly embraced and kiſſed her.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, Leonora was permitted to ſit down and take her dinner with the reſt. She ſpoke very little, but whatever ſhe did ſay was full of grace and modeſty. It is true, it coſt her very much to check her tongue, which, through impatience and the itch of talking, rolled, if I may ſay ſo, this and that way in her mouth; but on the following day, this work of checking her propenſity towards talking was leſs painful, and the next day ſtill leſs ſo. At length the difficulty, by a gradual diminution, was completely done away. At preſent ſhe has totally got rid of her bad habit, and ſhe figures in ſociety with credit to herſelf, and pleaſure to her friends, who are no longer vexed with what they were accuſtomed to entitle, in deriſion, her <hi>inceſſant clack.</hi>

               <head>THE SELF-CORRECTED LIAR.</head>
               <p>LITTLE Griffith was now ſix years old, and had never yet told a falſity. He never had committed any fault, and therefore had no need to hide the truth. When any accident befel him, as to break a pane of glaſs, or ſpot his cloaths, he went immediately and told his father, who would be always ſo good as to forgive him, with a caution that in future he ſhould be more careful.</p>
               <p>Griffith had a couſin, but a very naughty boy, whoſe name was Robert. Robert came one day to ſee him; and Griffith, by way of ſhewing his attention to his viſitor, made pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals for a game at drafts. His couſin eagerly accepted the propoſal, on condition that they ſhould play for ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Griffith for a little time refuſed, but in the end was wrought upon by Robert, and in hardly more than thirty minutes, all the money which he had been laying up
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0360400703:149"/>many weeks from his allowance was compleatly gone. Affected with his loſs, poor Griffith got into a corner, and began to cry, while Robert fell a laughing, and went home in triumph with his ſpoil.</p>
               <p>It was not long before poor Griffith's father, who had been from home, returned. He loved the child, and therefore ſent to ſee him in the parlour. But what ails you? ſaid he. And what has happened? Sure you have been crying?</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Griffith.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, papa, becauſe my couſin has been here, and made me play with him at drafts.</p>

                  <speaker>The Father.</speaker>
                  <p>And what of that? I ſee no harm done yet; for drafts are a diverſion that I have given you leave to take. But poſſibly you played for money?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Griffith.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>The Father.</speaker>
                  <p>Then why do you cry?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Griffith.</speaker>
                  <p>Becauſe I wiſhed to ſhow my couſin how much money I had ſaved to buy myſelf a book. Now I had hid it all behind the great ſtone poſt without, and when I put my hand into the hole, it was gone. Some perſon, paſſing by the gate, has ſtolen it.</p>
                  <p>Griffith's father, ſome how or another, fancied this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital to be falſe: but did not mention his ſuſpicions then. He went that moment to his brother's, and as ſoon as he ſaw little Robert, he forced a ſmile, and began in this manner:</p>
                  <p>Well, my child, you have been lucky, have not you, to-day?</p>
                  <p>Oh! yes, ſaid Robert, very lucky, ſir!</p>
                  <p>And what did you win?</p>
                  <p>A ſhilling, ſaid the nephew.</p>
                  <p>What, ſo much? And did he pay you, Robert?</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs, uncle. I have it in my pocket.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding Griffith had deſerved a grievous pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, his father thought it not amiſs to pardon this, as being his firſt falſehood; and therefore only told him, with a ſcornful tone of voice, that ſince he knew that he had a liar in his houſe, he would tell all the ſervants never to believe him, whatſoever he ſhould ſay.</p>
                  <p>Some few days after, Griffith went in turn to viſit Robert, and pulled out a handſome pencil-caſe which his ſiſter had beſtowed him at Chriſtmas. Robert wiſhed to have it, and in exchange would have been glad to
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0360400703:150"/>give him every one of his playthings, his ball, his top, and rackets; but as Griffith, he obſerved, would not part with it, he began to play the bully, put his arms akimbo, and advanced towards him, ſaid, "The pencil caſe is mine: I loſt it at your houſe, or elſe you ſtole it." Griffith, to no purpoſe, earneſtly proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that it was his ſiſter's preſent. Robert quickly let him ſee that he meant to force it from him; and as Griffith graſped it with both hands, he cloſed upon him, threw him down, got over him, and with his double fiſt ſo pomelled Griffith in the face that he was forced to yield the caſe.</p>
                  <p>Poor Griffith, being treated in this manner, poſted home, his noſe all over blood, and half his hair pulled off — "Papa, papa, (ſaid he, as ſoon as he was come within his father's hearing,) look how I have been uſed! The naughty Robert has this moment robbed me of my pencil-caſe, and handled me as you ſee."</p>
                  <p>But far from pitying him, his father anſwered, "Go, you liar; you have loſt your pencil-caſe at drafts, and to deceive me, ſmeared your noſe with mulberry juice, and put your hair into diſorder." Griffith ſolemnly proteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to no purpoſe, that he ſpoke only the truth." I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not credit (ſaid the father) one who has already proved himſelf a liar."</p>
                  <p>Griffith, quite confounded, went away into his cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and bewailed moſt bitterly the conſequences of his firſt untruth. Next day he begged permiſſion to appear before his father, and implored forgiveneſs. "I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge (ſaid he) how wicked I have been in ſeeking to deceive you with a falſhood once; but, dear papa, let me entreat you to give up your reſolutions of believing me no longer when I even ſpeak the truth!</p>
                  <p>His father told me the other day that from that moment Griffith had not let the leaſt untruth eſcape him, and that therefore he had recompenced his ſon's veracity by truſting him implicitly. He never looked for proteſtations from him: it was ſufficient Griffith barely told him any thing, that he ſhould take it for as great a certainty as if himſelf had ſeen it.</p>
                  <p>What a ſatisfaction this to be experienced by a tender father, and a ſon ſo worthy of him!</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Delwin.</speaker>
                  <p>What, <hi>all</hi> day?</p>

                  <speaker>Laura.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Delwin.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhall be very glad to give you any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in my power, my little Laura; but I fear, you will very ſoon be tired.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Laura.</speaker>
                  <p>Of playing! Never. You ſhall ſee that, mama.</p>
                  <p>And ſaying ſo, the little Laura ran to fetch her play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things. She had got them all together, but was quite alone; for both her ſiſters were that day to be employed with different maſters, till the afternoon.</p>
                  <p>At firſt, ſhe played as ſhe thought proper, and was very happy for an hour or thereabout; but, by degrees, the pleaſure which ſhe enjoyed began to loſe a little of its power to pleaſe her.</p>
                  <p>She had now handled her play-things twenty times, or oftener, and could tell no longer what to do. Her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite doll was grown quite troubleſome and tedious to her.</p>
                  <p>She deſired her dear mama to ſhew her ſome new me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of diverſion, and to play with her; but unfortunately her mama had very preſſing buſineſs, and could not attend to her, however ſhe might wiſh to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>Laura, after this, ſat moping in a corner, till her ſiſters, had quite finiſhed with their maſters, and were now about to take a little recreation. She ran to them in a melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly mood, which was as much as mentioning how long their time of ſtudy had ſeemed to her, and with what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patience ſhe had wiſhed to ſee them.</p>
                  <p>They propoſed immediately ſuch games as they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed moſt entertaining, for they loved her greatly: but, alas! all their ſolicitude was uſeleſs. Laura could not but complain that every game which they mentioned had already tired her; nay, in her impatience, ſhe even ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to accuſe them of conſpiring with each other to afford her ſuch diverſion only as they knew would not amuſe her. Upon which Miſs Amelia, her eldeſt ſiſter,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0360400703:152"/>an extremely ſenſible young lady ten years old, took Laura by the hand, and with a ſmile began as follows:</p>
                  <p>Look at us, dear Laura, and I will tell you which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the room occaſions your diſſatisfaction.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Laura.</speaker>
                  <p>And who is it, ſiſter? For my part, I don't know.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>The reaſon is, you do not look at yourſelf. Yes, Laura, you yourſelf occaſion your diſſatisfaction; for you ſee theſe games amuſe <hi>us</hi> ſtill, though we have played them over, you may eaſily imagine, before you were born: but then we have been both at work, and therefore are they in a manner new to us. If you, by previous ſtudy and attention, had obtained an appetite for pleaſure, you would certainly have been pleaſed as caſily as we are.</p>
                  <p>Little Laura, who, however young ſhe was, by no means wanted underſtanding, was ſo ſtruck with theſe remarks, as to diſcern that every one who would be happy ſhould take care to mix improving exerciſe with pleaſing recreation. And indeed, I know not whether, after ſuch experience gained, the menace of a whole day's pleaſure would not have more terrified her than that of a whole day's labour.</p>

               <head>THE TULIPS.</head>
               <p>LUCETTA had ſeen for two ſummers ſucceſſively a bed of tulips in her father's garden, which were ſtreaked with the moſt beautiful colours.</p>
               <p>Like the fluttering butterfly, ſhe often roved from flower to flower, being ſtruck merely with their beauty, but never reflecting to what they owed their origin.</p>
               <p>Laſt Autumn, ſhe ſaw her father amuſe himſelf with digging up the bed and planting tulip roots. Ah! papa, cried ſhe in a whimpering tone, what are you doing? Will you ſpoil all our fine tulip bed ſo, and inſtead of thoſe fine flowers that grew there, put naſty onions in it for the kitchen?</p>
               <p>Her father anſwered her, that he knew what he was about, and he was going to tell her that from thoſe onions would come forth new tulips the following year; but
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0360400703:153"/>Lucetta interrupted him by her complaints, and would liſten to nothing.</p>
               <p>When her father ſaw that he could not make her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand reaſon, he left her to pacify herſelf, and continued his work while ſhe retired ſobbing.</p>
               <p>During the Winter, as often as the converſation turned upon flowers, Lucetta ſighed, and thought within herſelf how great a pity it was that her father had deſtroyed the fineſt ornament of the garden. Winter finiſhed its courſe, and Spring came next to ſweep the ſnow and ice off the ground.</p>
               <p>Lucetta had not entered the garden yet. Indeed it would have been difficult to prevail on her to go in, as it was deprived of her favourite flower. One day, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhe entered without thinking. But what were her tranſports of ſurprize and joy, when ſhe ſaw the tulip bed ſtill more beautiful than the preceding year! She ſtood ſtill at firſt, motionleſs and ſilent with admiration: at length ſhe threw herſelf into her father's arms, crying, Ah! dear papa, I thank you for plucking up thoſe naſty onions, and for putting in their place thoſe ſweet flowers that I am ſo fond of.</p>
               <p>Yo owe me no thanks, anſwered her father; for theſe ſweet flowers that you are ſo fond of ſprung from nothing elſe but my naſty onions.</p>
               <p>The obſtinate Lucetta would not believe a word of it; upon which her father pulled up carefully one of the fineſt tulips, together with the bulbous root (reſembling an onion) from which the ſtalk grew, and preſented it to her.</p>
               <p>Lucetta, quite confounded, aſked pardon for having been ſo unreaſonable. I pardon you, my dear child, with all my heart, replied her father, provided you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge how eaſy it is for children to deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they attempt to judge, after their ignorance, of the actions of people who have had experience.</p>
               <p>Oh! yes, papa, anſwered Lucetta, I am convinced of that, and therefore for the future ſhall diſtruſt my own eyes; and whenever I ſhall be tempted to ſuppoſe that I know more of the matter than other people, I will think of the Tulips and the Onions.</p>
               <p>I am very glad, my dear little friends, that I had it in my power to tell you this ſtory; for you will preſently ſee what happened to another child who had never heard it.</p>

               <head>THE STRAWBERRIES AND CURRANTS.</head>
               <p>ALLAN had frequently heard his father ſay, that children were without the leaſt degree of knowledge touching what was proper for them; and that all the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which they could poſſibly prove themſelves to poſſeſs, lay in following the advice of people older than themſelves. And yet he never had ſincerely wiſhed to underſtand this doctrine, or perhaps, to ſpeak as favourably as the matter will allow, had forgot it.</p>
               <p>His indulgent father had allotted him and Proſpero, his brother, a convenient piece of ground, that each might have a little garden, and diſplay his induſtry and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the cultivation of it. And not only this, but they had leave to ſow whatever ſeed they thought proper, or to take any tree-root already growing in their father's garden, and tranſplant it.</p>
               <p>Proſpero remembered the inſtruction of his father, went to have a little converſation on this ſubject with Ralph the gardener, and began thus: Pray tell me what I ought to ſow at preſent in my garden, and how ſet about my work?</p>
               <p>The gardener gave him ſeveral roots and ſeeds adapted to the ſeaſon. Proſpero that moment ran and put them in the ground, and Ralph was ſo kind as to aſſiſt him in the work, and to give him ſome inſtruction.</p>
               <p>But Allan, ſeeing Proſpero's docility, ſhrugged up his ſhoulders. Ralph, not obſerving this contemptuous action, aſked if he ſhould give him ſome aſſiſtance and inſtruction likewiſe?</p>
               <p>Yes, replied Allan, I have great occaſion, to be ſure, of your aſſiſtance and inſtruction, particularly the laſt!</p>
               <p>On this, he went into his father's garden; and ſelect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for his own, a quantity of flowers, tranſplanted them immediately. The gardener let him do as he thought fit.</p>
               <p>Next morning, when Allan viſited his garden, all the flowers which he had ſo lately planted hung their heads like mourners at a funeral, and, as he ſaw, were dying. He tranſplanted others from his father's garden, which the morning after he obſerved, with much vexation, were exactly in the ſame condition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="149" facs="tcp:0360400703:155"/>He was very ſoon diſguſted with this ſort of work. It was paying very dear, we muſt acknowledge, for the pleaſure of poſſeſſing a few flowers. Of courſe he gave it up, and it was not long before his piece of ground was overrun with weeds and thiſtles.</p>
               <p>Towards the middle of the Spring, as he was looking at his brother's garden, he ſaw ſomething red ſuſpended very near the ground, which, on examination, he diſcerned to be ſtrawberries, and found to have an exquiſite degree of flavour.</p>
               <p>Ah, ſaid he, if I had planted ſtrawberries in my garden!</p>
               <p>Some time after, likewiſe, he ſaw certain little berries of a milk white colour, that hung down in cluſters from the branches of a buſh; upon examination, they were currants, which to look at only was a banquet.</p>
               <p>Ah, ſaid he again, if I had planted currants in my garden!</p>
               <p>Eat as many as you like, ſaid Proſpero, as if they were your own.</p>
               <p>It reſted with yourſelf and no one elſe, remarked the gardener, to have had as good; ſo never for the future treat with ſcorn the aſſiſtance and inſtruction which any one may offer you, who is poſſeſſed of greater knowledge and experience than yourſelf.</p>

               <head>OBLIGINGNESS AND COMPLAISANCE.</head>
               <p>EMILIA, Victoria, Juliet, and Sophia, had a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verneſs who loved them with the fondneſs of a mother. This governeſs was called Mademoiſelle Beaufoy.</p>
               <p>Her greateſt wiſh was, that her pupils ſhould be virtuous in order to be happy; that a friendſhip for each other ſhould increaſe the pleaſures of their childhood; and that they ſhould taſte thoſe pleaſures without diminution or anxiety.</p>
               <p>A kind indulgence, and exact degree of juſtice towards them, were the conſtant motives of her conduct, whether ſhe had any thing to pardon, to reward, or puniſh in them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:0360400703:156"/>She enjoyed, with infinite delight, the pleaſing fruits of her inſtruction and example.</p>
               <p>The four little girls began to be the happieſt children upon earth. They told each other of their faults, forgave each other, ſhared together of each other's joys, and could not live without each other.</p>
               <p>Alas! by what fatality do children poiſon the ſource of their own enjoyments, at the very moment when they begin to taſte its charms; and how great is their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs when they are placed under the eye of a perſon endowed with equal prudence and tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>It happened, Mademoiſelle Beaufoy was forced to leave her pupils for a time, as certain family concerns obliged her to viſit France. She left them with reluctance, made a ſacrifice of ſome advantages to the deſire of quickly ſettling her affairs, and hardly had a month expired when ſhe returned in ſafety to her little flock.</p>
               <p>They all received her with the greateſt ſigns of joy: but, alas! what an unhappy alteration did ſhe very ſoon perceive in theſe poor little children!</p>
               <p>If, as frequently it happened, any one among them aſked the ſlighteſt favour of another, the latter ill-naturedly refuſed it, and hence followed diſcontent and quarrels:— the uncommon gaiety that hitherto had been remarkable in all their little ſports, and made their work itſelf delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, was now changed to peeviſhneſs and melancholy; and inſtead of thoſe expreſſions dictated by peace and friendſhip, which were before heard in all their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, nothing now prevailed among them but inceſſant bickerings. Did either wiſh to take an hour's diverſion in the garden? her ſiſters were ſure to aſſign ſome reaſon for remaining in their chamber. And, in ſhort, it was enough that any thing ſhould meet the wiſh of one among them to diſpleaſe the others.</p>
               <p>It particularly chanced one day, that not contented to deny each other every ſort of friendſhip and obligingneſs, they mutually diſtreſſed each other with reproaches. Mademoiſelle Beaufoy, who ſat as a witneſs of this ſcene<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> was ſo affected by it as even to ſhed tears.</p>
               <p>She could not ſpeak a word; and penſively withdrew into her chamber, that ſhe might the better think upon the means of rendering back to theſe unhappy little ones
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0360400703:157"/>the pleaſures which they had loſt of their former friendſhip and reciprocal attachment.</p>
               <p>She was ſtill employed in this afflicting taſk when all the four young ladies entered her apartment, with a peeviſh and uneaſy look, complaining that they could be no longer happy in each other's company. There was not one of them but charged the reſt with cauſing it; and all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther earneſtly deſired their governeſs to reſtore them, if poſſible, to their loſt happineſs.</p>
               <p>The governeſs received them in a very ſerious manner<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying, I obſerve, my children, you obſtruct each other in your pleaſures; therefore, that this circumſtance may never come to paſs again, let each take up her corner in this very room, if ſhe thinks proper, and divert herſelf in any way that ſhe likes, but ſo as not to interfere with either of her ſiſters. You may have recourſe to this new mode of recreation inſtantly, as you have leave to play till night; but each (remember) in her corner, as I ſaid juſt now.</p>
               <p>The little girls were charmed with this propoſal, took their places, and began to play.</p>
               <p>Sophia entered into converſation with her doll, or rather told her many little ſtories; but her doll could not reply, and had no ſtories in her turn to tell. It was in vain to look for any entertainment from her ſiſters; they were playing, each aſunder, in their corners.</p>
               <p>Juliet took her battledore and ſhuttlecock, yet none applauded her dexterity; beſides, ſhe would gladly have ſtruck it acroſs the room, but in that caſe there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body to ſend it back. It was in vain to hope ſuch ſervice from her ſiſters; they were playing, each aſunder, in their corners.</p>
               <p>Emilia could have wiſhed to paſs the time that now hung heavy on her at a game of which ſhe was very fond, <hi>hunt the ſlipper:</hi> but, alas! who was there to paſs the ſlipper from hand to hand? It was in vain to aſk her ſiſters; they were playing, each aſunder, in their corners.</p>
               <p>And Victoria, who was very ſkilful as a little houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife, thought how ſhe might give her friends an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and of courſe ſend out for many things to market. But who was to receive her orders? It was in vain to pitch upon her ſiſters; they were playing, each aſunder, in their corners.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="tcp:0360400703:158"/>It was juſt the ſame with every other play. All of them ſuppoſed that it would be compromiſing matters to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach each other, and therefore they diſdainfully conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in their ſolitude. At length the day concluded. They returned again to Mademoiſelle Beaufoy, and begged her to ſhew them a better ſort of amuſement than that which ſhe had already recommended.</p>
               <p>I can only think of one, my children, anſwered ſhe, which you yourſelves knew very well formerly, but which it ſeems you have now forgotten. Yet, if you wiſh to put it once more into practice, I can eaſily remind you of it.</p>
               <p>Oh! we wiſh to recollect it with all our hearts, replied they; and ſtood all attention to ſeize with ardour the firſt word that their governeſs ſhould utter.</p>
               <p>It is, anſwered ſhe, that reciprocal obligingneſs, that mutual friendſhip, which ſiſters owe to each other. O, my deareſt little friends! how miſerable have you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to make yourſelves and me too, ſince you loſt it!</p>
               <p>She ſtopped ſhort when ſhe had uttered theſe few words, which yet were interrupted frequently by ſighs, while tears of tenderneſs ran down her cheeks.</p>
               <p>The little girls appeared aſtoniſhed and ſtruck dumb with ſorrow and confuſion in her preſence. She held out her arms; they ruſhed at once affectionately towards her, and ſincerely promiſed that they would love each other for the future, and agree as they had done before ſhe left them.</p>
               <p>From that moment they betrayed no ſigns of peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to trouble their harmonious intercourſe. Inſtead of bickerings and diſcontent amongſt them, nothing now was known but mutual condeſcenſions which delighted all who had the opportunity of being with them.</p>
               <p>They preſerve this amiable character at preſent in the world among their friends, of whom they are acknowledged to be the delight and ornament.</p>

                  <p>Yes, yes; to take you up! The juſtice has your father in cuſtody already; and the conſtables who took him, told us that they would ſoon come back for you, with Kitty, Bell and Sally, and then carry you all four to priſon.</p>

All I wiſhed was to convince you how wicked it would be to ſhut up the poor little bird. As much as you appeared afflicted, when I told you that they would take you up, ſo much the little bird <hi>was</hi> certainly when you deprived him of his liberty. Conceive how much the cock would have lamented to be parted from the hen, the young ones from their mother, and the mother from her young ones. This I am ſure you did not think of, otherwiſe you never would have taken him. Tell me, would you?</p>

                  <p>Well, think of it for the future, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get not that birds, as well as every other creature, were created to enjoy their liberty, and that it would be cruel to fill up with ſorrow that ſhort period of exiſtence which God has granted them; and, to remember this the better, you ſhould get by heart a little piece of poetry that your friend has written.</p>

He proved at laſt ſo fortunate as to obtain a hearing, when he thanked him for the guinea; upon which the king, would you believe it, ordered him another guinea for his gratitude, as he particularly mentioned.</p>

You have dared before his face, to tell his father that he ſhall go upon his travels. We all know the meaning of that phraſe; and would you have him ſtand there like a poſt before you, without having the ſpirit to open his lips? Who could keep his temper if he ſaw his family on the point of being ruined by an ill-natured our of your ſtamp? We know what ſtewards are, and how they make fortunes. This young man ſpoke to you civilly at firſt, and you ſlighted him. He is in the right now to ſpeak the truth to you.</p>

                        <p>Do not be frightened, father. Had you wept even blood, he would not have relaxed. I never ſtruck a man before; but I was never called a ragamuffin in my life till now. Could I be a ſoldier had I borne it?</p>

                        <p>Pſhaw! he is not the firſt of his profeſſion that has undergone a ſoldier's vengeance. I, for my part, think it perfect ſympathy, that when a ſoldier ſees a rogue, he naturally knocks him down.</p>

               <p>DUNCAN, a bricklayer's labourer, living in a diſtant country town, had loſt his wife about a quarter of a year before the event we are to write of. The e<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>pences of a tedious illneſs, and the interruption of
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0360400703:187"/>his labour by a very rainy ſeaſon, had reduced him to the laſt diſtreſs. His children were half naked, and had really no bread to eat. This circumſtance was of itſelf ſufficiently tormenting; but to aggravate the ſcene, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna, his poor mother, laid upon a little ſtraw in the corner of the cottage, was almoſt in the agonies of death.</p>
               <p>Duncan, at ſuch a proſpect round about him, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed with ſorrow, took a broken matted chair, and at a little diſtance from Suſanna's bed ſat down upon it, having both his hands held up, that he might hide his tears.</p>
               <p>His mother turning towards him, with a feeble voice enquired if there was no where in the houſe a rag to put upon her. I cannot make myſelf warm, ſaid ſhe, do what I will.</p>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Duncan.</speaker>
                  <p>Stay, mother; I will pull off my coat, and lay it on you.</p>

                  <speaker>Suſanna.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no; I will not have it, my dear ſon. A little ſtraw, if you have nothing elſe, will do as well. But have you not a ſingle bit of wood ſtill left to make a ſire for theſe poor children? You will tell me, you cannot go into the fields, becauſe of the attention that I require. My life is very long, ſince I am grown burthenſome to you!</p>

                  <speaker>Duncan.</speaker>
                  <p>Pray do not ſay ſo, dear mother. Would to God I could procure you what you want, at the expence of my own life! I would freely give it up: but this is my grief, that you ſuffer cold and hunger, while I am utterly unable to relieve you.</p>

Go, my good Duncan, with Arthur; inform him how it grieves me that I am not able to make him reſtitution for the theft: but that I will pray to God for his proſperity, and beg a bleſſing on his family. Alas! he is no leſs poor than we; and were it not that his good woman works ſo hard, he could never bring up ſuch a family of children as he has. My dear good ſon, for my ſake, when I am dead and buried, give him a day's work to make him up his loſs: it matters not how little he has ſuffered. We ſhould think it criminal to take away a pin.

                  <p>Do not be frightened thus, my good mother: I am not a ſingle farthing in his debt; and for the rent that we owe the 'ſquire at Midſummer, I will give him all the labour that he requires in harveſt.</p>

                  <p>Duncan went out to know the ſteward's buſineſs. After he was gone, Suſanna fetched a grievous ſigh, and ſaid, diſcourſing with herſelf, Since he was ſo hard-hearted as to ſeize upon our goods for rent, I cannot ſee or hear him, but my heart revolts at the idea; and at preſent, in my dying moments, he muſt come and cough at our window. But perhaps the hand of God brings him hither as an admonition for me to diſcharge my heart of every thing that looks like malice or ill-will againſt him, and even pray for mercy on his ſoul. Well then, my God, I am content to do ſo. I no longer wiſh him any harm. Forgive his ſin, as I forgive it. <stage>(<hi>She hears the ſteward ſpeaking rather loud.</hi>)</stage>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I hear his voice! he is in a paſſion!—Heaven take pity on us!—O my poor Duncan, it is out of love for me that you have fallen again into his hands. <stage>(<hi>She faints, on which the little boy jumps off the bed, and runs to fetch his father.</hi>)</stage>

Heaven is merciful! may you, Duncan, at all times find it ſo: but tell me, are you not by this convinced of what I have ſo often told you, that the more misfortunes on one ſide attack us, ſo much more God's grace awaits us on the other?</p>

                  <p>Yes, I am, and ſhall be always. But methinks you ſeem much better. Let me quit you for about a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute. I will go fetch a little ſtraw to cover you.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Suſanna.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no; I feel myſelf much warmer. Rather go with Arthur to neighbour Leonard's. That is what diſturbs me moſt of all. Go, my ſon, I aſk it as a favour.</p>
                  <p>Hearing this, he did not ſtay a moment in the room, but took his ſon, and going out, gave Margaret a ſign to come and let him ſpeak with her.</p>
                  <p>Take care of your poor grandmother, ſaid he; and if a fainting fit ſhould ſeize her, come and fetch me from the carpenter's; I ſhall be there.</p>
                  <p>Leonard was at work, and Gertrude his wife was left all alone at home. She ſaw at once that the father and the child had both been crying.</p>
                  <p>What is the matter with you, my good friend, ſaid Gertrude, that you have been crying? What is the matter with you, my poor Arthur?</p>

                  <speaker>Duncan.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah, neighbour Gertrude! I am quite unhappy. This poor child of mine who wanted victuals yeſterday, came here and took ſome apples that were yours: he has confeſſed it. My poor mother ſaw him eat them.—Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude, ſhe is on her death bed, and deſires you to forgive him. I cannot pay you now the worth of what he took away; but when I go to work, which will be very ſhortly, I will be ſure to ſatisfy you.</p>

                  <p>O don't ſpeak about it, neighbour: it is a trifle not worth mentioning. And you, my little fellow, promiſe that you will never for the future take what is not your own. <stage>(<hi>She kiſſes him.</hi>)</stage> You are born of ſuch good people!</p>

                  <speaker>Duncan.</speaker>
                  <p>Thank ye, neighbour; but I hope, he will never want bread again. I have got a deal of work to do at 'Squire Wealthy's.</p>

                  <speaker>Gertrude.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, I heard ſo of the ſervants, and was very glad.</p>

                  <speaker>Duncan.</speaker>
                  <p>I was not near ſo happy when I got it on my own account, as for my mother's ſake. She has at leaſt this comfort on her death-bed. Tell my good friend Leonard that I ſhall work with all my heart to make him compenſation for his loſs.</p>

                  <speaker>Gertrude.</speaker>
                  <p>Do not ſpeak about it, I requeſt you once again. My huſband, I am certain, will not think of any compenſation. He was out of work himſelf, and is to have the wood work of the job for which you are engaged. But as poor Suſanna is ſo ill, I will go and give her my aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Gertrude got on her cloak, and then put up ſome pears and apples in a bag, and filled the little fellow's pockets likewiſe; took him by the hand, and bidding poor Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can go firſt, came after.</p>
                  <p>They had quickly reached Suſanna's chamber. Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trude held out her hand, but turned away her face, that ſhe might hide her tears. Suſanna, notwithſtanding, ſaw her, and began as follows:</p>
                  <p>You are crying then, my dear friend Gertrude?</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>Duncan no ſooner heard theſe words, than he was ſeized all over with a ſudden trembling: he took off his hat, fell down upon his knees beſide Suſanna's bed, laid hold with ardour of her hand, then lifted up his eyes to heaven, and would fain have ſpoke, but could not: tears and ſighs prevented him.</p>
                  <p>Take comfort, ſaid Suſanna; I am going to a happier life than this, and there will wait your coming. When we once meet there, we ſhall not part again.</p>
                  <p>Duncan in ſome degree recovering, bowed his head, and craved his mother's bleſſing. Bleſs me, ſaid he, my dear mother. I deſire to follow you, when once my chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have no further need of my aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>Suſanna opened once again her dying eyes; and with uncommon fervour looking up, pronounced theſe words:</p>
                  <p>Hear me, O heavenly father, and vouchſafe the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of thy grace and favour to my ſon, the only one that I ever had, and whoſe affection was the comfort of my life.

                  <p>Hear me now, my dear Duncan, and carefully obſerve what I ſhall tell you. Bring your children up in virtue, and accuſtom them betimes to a laborious life, that if they ſhould be poor, they may not, when grown up, loſe courage, and be tempted to do wrong. Inſtruct them to place all their truſt in God, and to live good friends with one another; ſo that they may find ſure conſolation in the
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0360400703:195"/>evils of this life. Forgive the ſteward his injuſtice. When I am buried, pray inform him that I departed without any malice or ill-will againſt him, and beſought of God that he would grant him of his grace to ſee the ſin that he had committed, and repent before he came upon a death-bed. <stage>(<hi>She ſtops a little to take breath, and then goes on.</hi>)</stage>

                  <p>They were weeping at a table, whence their father brought them to Suſanna, putting them upon their knees beſide her, while ſhe raiſed herſelf a little, ſo that ſhe might ſee them, and began:</p>
                  <p>My deareſt children, I am very ſorry that I muſt leave you motherleſs and poor. Think often of me, my ſweet babes. I have nothing that I can give you but this book: it has been frequently my conſolation, and as often will be yours. When you have learned ſufficiently, read in it every evening to your father. It will teach you to be good; and if you are but good, you cannot fail of being happy.</p>
                  <p>This, Duncan, <stage>(<hi>taking out a piece of paper from the leather bag,</hi>)</stage> is a certificate which I brought your father of my good behaviour at our marriage. Let it paſs by turns to each of your three daughters, till they marry. It is my laſt requeſt. And as for you, my ſon, I have nothing in the world to give you in remembrance of me; but the comfort is, you want none. You will not forget me, I am certain.</p>
                  <p>Gertrude, ſhall I requeſt one other favour of you, after having pardoned Arthur? When I am dead, ſee now and then to theſe poor children.—They have no one friend.— I recommend you in particular my poor dear Lucy.—She is the youngeſt of the three.—Where is ſhe?—I can hardly ſee.— <stage>(<hi>She ſtretches out her arm with difficulty.</hi>)</stage>

What was his diſtraction then, and that of his helpleſs family? How they wept and wrung their hands! How they beat upon their breaſts, and tore their hair up by the roots for anguiſh.</p>
                  <p>Gertrude, as well as ſhe was able, comforted their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and repeated to Duncan Suſanna's parting words, which, in his grief, he had not heard diſtinctly.</p>

The little orphans being brought up with her own dear children, had the ſame inſtruction; and improving by it, grew in time to be a pattern for the village; and particularly Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur, continually having in remembrance his firſt fault, became remarkable in time for his fidelity and honeſt dealing.</p>

               <head>PASCAL.</head>
               <p>MR. Dawkins was accuſtomed every Saturday to pay his only ſon, a little boy whoſe name was Paſcal, an allowance, ſuch as was ſufficient to procure him, the week through, thoſe little pleaſures and enjoyments which children of his age ſo naturally purſue. No leſs confident than generous, he never looked for an account from Paſcal of the way in which he laid out what he gave him. He ſuppoſed his principles to be ſuch, that he would not abuſe his bounty, but remember the inſtruction which he had ſo frequently given him upon the ſubject. But what lamentable conſequences did this too blind credulity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce?</p>
               <p>For hardly ever had he touched his weekly payment, but he ran that moment to a ſhop hard by, and ſtuffed himſelf with paſtry and nice things. His purſe, in this firſt onſet, underwent ſo great a diminution, that a very little the next day was ſufficient to exhauſt it totally: and during the laſt part of every week, he never had a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to regale himſelf withal; yet he did not, upon that account, the leſs hanker after the ſame delicacies. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0360400703:197"/>being reſolved to gratify his palate, he prevailed upon the paſtry-cook, at firſt, to give him credit; but when afterwards he found that the boy's allowance was never applied to pay off theſe arrears, while on the other hand the debt increaſed, he ſaw that it was prudent to give in his bill to Mr. Dawkins. Mr. Dawkins was extremely angry with the tradeſman, reprimanded his improper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, and forbade not only <hi>him,</hi> but every tradeſman round about, to let his ſon have any thing for which he could not pay on the ſpot. This might have been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed a good precaution; and accordingly he thought it could not but become a check on Paſcal's gluttony; whereas it only irritated matters, and the boy, as we ſhall ſee, at any riſque reſolved to gratify his palate.</p>
               <p>Paſcal's chamber was contiguous to his father's. After having noticed when his father generally ſlept the ſoundeſt, he once got up ſoftly, came into his room, and feeling for his breeches, took out half a crown. Emboldened by this fatal ſucceſs, he frequently repeated his offence, and for a time without detection: but there cannot be a crime, however ſecretly committed, which does not come to light at laſt.</p>
               <p>It chanced that Mr. Dawkins, ſome time after Paſcal's firſt offence, in this way, had a law-ſuit on the following day to be decided. Having thought upon it waking, it is not to be wondered at that it ſhould take up his attention after he was gone to reſt. In fact, he lay quite ſilent, ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating on the affair, when Paſcal, thinking him aſleep, got up as he was wont to do. Unhappily for him, the moon threw light enough into the chamber, that a perſon coming in might eaſily be ſeen. Accordingly let any one imagine if he can, what Mr. Dawkins muſt have felt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding his own ſon thus come and rob him! He for that time ſtifled his reſentment; but before the thief could quit his chamber in the morning, he got up, went to him, and found means to turn the converſation into ſuch a channel, as to aſk him how much he intended to lay out that day of his allowance. Nothing, anſwered Paſcal. I have given all my laſt week's money to a poor man in the neighbourhood, and muſt deny myſelf a little till next Saturday.</p>
               <p>His father could not poſſibly reſtrain his indignation any longer, hearing ſo deteſtable a lie come from him.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0360400703:198"/>He ſprung forward, ſeized him by the collar, for by this time he was dreſſed, and found five ſhillings in his pocket, which was what he had ſtolen from his father. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion as he had till now been tender and indulgent to his ſon, ſo much the greater was his ſeverity and rigour on this occaſion: for his reprimands were only the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amble to a harſher treatment, and the wretched Paſcal was obliged to keep his bed for many days, in conſequence of the correction that he received.</p>
               <p>How difficult it is to extirpate a vice which has once taken root within us! Paſcal was not cured by this cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. Mr. Dawkins left the key of his bureau one evening in the lock, and Paſcal took a model of the wards, and got another made at the ſmith's. This gave him a convenient opportunity to rob his father whenever he pleaſed: who, as he uſually kept a great deal of caſh by him, and as Paſcal was more cunning than to take too much at once, ſuſpected nothing of the affair. He was now fifteen years of age, and could diſſemble ſo well, that his parents thought him quite reformed, till his hypocriſy was accidentally diſcovered.</p>
               <p>His father had received a piece of foreign coin, among other monies, which he ſoon remarked, and put it up in the bureau. This piece fell into Paſcal's hands that very night, and Mr. Dawkins miſſing it the next morning, could not but bethink himſelf of Paſcal's former inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſuſpect him. He reſolved to ſatisfy himſelf that moment, and examining his pockets, found the piece of money that he had loſt, together with the key, by means of which he had obtained it.</p>
               <p>But Paſcal by this time was too big for ſuch correction as he had received before, and therefore Mr. Dawkins contented himſelf with ſeverely upbraiding him for the preſent, and threatening to withdraw the benefits of his affection from him. He conſulted a few faithful friends that he had, upon the treatment proper to be ſhewn him: their opinion was in general, that the harſheſt method of proceeding would moſt tend to his amendment, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed his being ſent to ſchool in Yorkſhire, where for years he might not ſee his family, but be ſubjected to the rigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous diſcipline and homely fare peculiar to ſuch inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of courſe have leiſure to repent of his enormity, and be accuſtomed to a frugal way of life. This was
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0360400703:199"/>their counſel; but the combats of paternal love in Mr. Dawkins's boſom, which was very far, as yet, from being quite extinct, would not permit him to purſue their ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary admonition; he inclined to ſomething of a gentler nature, and in grief of heart, and as the only moderate method which he could deviſe to preſerve him from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, ſent that very day to Briſtol for a friend of his, who kept a boarding ſchool, to whoſe attention he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, upon the day of his arrival, this unworthy ſon, with directions to let him have no other money than was abſolutely neceſſary for his wants. His friend ſet off on his return immediately, and Paſcal with him.</p>
               <p>This was a precaution; but it came, alas! too late: the youth's principles were utterly corrupted. His tutor's table was plain, though very plentiful; for which reaſon Paſcal would go out, and at a tavern gratify his palate with the choiceſt wines and viands, for which he eaſily got credit, as his hoſt took care to make enquiry, firſt of all, into his father's circumſtances, who, he found, was very rich: nor did he ſtop at this; for to ſupply that want of money which his tutor would not, he began to play, and practiſed every ſpecies of deception at a gaming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe hard by.</p>
               <p>God's providence, as if it interfered particularly to reform him, puniſhed all his vices on the ſpot. Three gamblers, his companions, who detected him endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deceive them with a pack of cards that he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forehand ſorted for the purpoſe, fell upon him unawares, and ſo rough were the effects of their vengeance, that Paſcal was almoſt drubbed to death upon the ſpot.</p>
               <p>He was carried home with ſcarce the leaſt remains of life, and put to bed. His tutor ran to ſee him, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded all the ſuccour and aſſiſtance in his power. He waited till he ſaw him almoſt reeſtabliſhed, to impart ſuch counſel as might poſſibly affect him; which he did with all the ſoftneſs poſſible, and pointed out the horrors into which he was plunging himſelf. Miſerable youth! ſaid the tutor, what can have induced you to exceſſes ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful! You diſhonour, by your crimes, a name which the probity of thoſe before you had exalted, and made really reſpectable. You rob your tender parents of thoſe hopes which they indulged when firſt they laid the ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work of your education. When the youth of your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0360400703:200"/>who now conſecrate that time to ſtudy which you conſume in ſcandalous exceſſes, ſhall be ſought out by their country and employed in elevated ſtations, you will be conſidered as an abject dangerous character. You will be baniſhed from all company that have the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard or value for their honour, and the meaneſt claſs of men will ſcorn you.</p>
               <p>Paſcal was at firſt affected with this leſſon. He broke off all commerce with his partners; he was ſatisfied with his preceptor's table-fare; and ſeemed as if beginning to imagine that ſtudy had ſome charms to pleaſe him. But this diſpoſition was ſoon done away, and by degrees he relapſed into his former way of life. He ſold his books; his watch and clothes went afterwards; and he contrived to ſtrip himſelf of his apparel ſo completely, that he could not ſtir abroad.</p>
               <p>On which his creditors came all at once upon him, and receiving a refuſal from the tutor to diſcharge the young man's debts and ſatiate their avidity, they wrote letters to the father, threatening to arreſt him if they were not paid. Let Paſcal's ſituation now be imagined. Overwhelmed with the repreaches of his creditors, the indignation of his tutor, the contempt of thoſe who waited on him, and his own remorſe, he had moreover to dread the maledic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his parents. He was ſenſible that he had ſo much neglected to improve his underſtanding, that he could not find the leaſt reſources againſt want in any calling or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion. He began to think his ſituation deſperate. A whole day he paſſed in his apartment violently agitated; every now and then he wrung his hands, tore his hair, and curſed his vices: but at night, ſtill borne away by his depravity, he went from home to ſpend the little money that he had left in a tavern.</p>
               <p>Accident that evening threw two men into his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany who were employed to raiſe recruits for India. They remarked upon his countenance the embarraſſment with which his ſoul was agitated, winked to one another, and began to talk of India. They deſcribed the beauty of the country, and what pay was given to the ſoldiery. They ſpoke of the advantages that a youth of family might meet with there, and what a probability there was, that ſuch a one might make his fortune: nay, they went ſo far as to aſſert that many, to their knowledge, had from
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0360400703:201"/>private ſoldiers been made officers, and married wealthy widows.</p>
               <p>Paſcal heard this converſation with avidity, joined in the diſcourſe, and enquired if it was difficult to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted with theſe ſoldiers. If you wiſh to enliſt, ſaid they, we can oblige you, though we have more recruits by many than we want; but you, by your appearance, ſeem to claim the preference; and thereupon they offered him five guineas if he would enter.</p>
               <p>After ſome ſlight ſtruggles, Paſcal took the guineas, and enliſted. The remainder of the night he ſpent in drinking; and when morning came, was ſent to learn his exerciſe. He found himſelf ſurrounded by a ſet of auk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ruſtics, runaway apprentices, notorious beggars, and convicted thieves, who had enliſted to eſcape the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows. He was under the tuition of a ſurly corporal, who loaded him from time to time with curſes, and ſeverely caned him, when he could not comprehend his meaning.</p>
               <p>Paſcal's miſery went on from day to day encreaſing. All the money that he had lately touched at parting with his freedom, was already gone in riot. He had nothing to ſubſiſt on but the coarſe proviſion granted by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany to keep their new recruits together. Lubberkin, who had been a ſwine-herd, and was then his comrade, was much better off. He had been always uſed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ive on o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ten bread, and therefore thought himſelf a prince, when he could get a bit of half-baked meat. But what were Paſcal's feelings, when, partaking of ſuch coarſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, he reflected on the delicacies of his former repaſts!</p>
               <p>Some days after came an order for the ſoldiers to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark. Paſcal heard this news with much more ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than the people round about him thought he would have teſtified. If once you get to India, ſaid he to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as you are young, and of a likely figure, you will make your fortune, as a multitude of Engliſhmen have done before you.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of all theſe brilliant proſpects, Paſcal went on board the veſſel deſtined to tranſport him and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades. He drank down a glaſs or two of brandy at the moment of embarking, and the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> head, and to make him utterly forget his parents. He went off with mad huzzas. But then the joy with which he ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered theſe huzzas continued hardly longer than the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0360400703:202"/>drunkenneſs that cauſed them. Thoſe on board who were now for the firſt time in their life at ſea, began to feel a death-like ſickneſs. Paſcal, whoſe intemperance had hurt his inſide much, endured a great deal more than any other. He was ſeveral days inſenſible, and nothing ſtaid upon his ſtomach. Even the ſight of food diſguſted him; and when at laſt he grew a little better, and was hungry, mouldy peaſe, ſalt beef, and biſcuits full of mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots, were the only victuals that he could procure. When he firſt ſet ſail, the ſoldiers had a pint of beer each allowed them; but by degrees they were deprived of this indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and compelled to put up with a bare ſufficiency of water, and even this they were obliged to ſtrain before they could drink it.</p>
               <p>After ſix long months inceſſant ſuffering, during all which time they were in fear of continual ſhipwreck, they arrived in India, wearied out with watchings for the moſt part, and a dreadful ſcurvy. Paſcal was marched up the country, with his comrades, to the army: but his heart, embittered by the horror of his ſituation, was inſenſible of any thing like goodneſs. His abandoned courſe of life, the crimes that he was inceſſantly committing, and his numberleſs deſertions, frequently ſubjected him to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment. He was determined, if he could, to quit theſe regions, watched his opportunity, and ſtealing on board a veſſel bound to England, hid himſelf below till it had ſailed; nor did he quit his hiding place, till the ſhip was a great way out to ſea: he then came ſorth, and being brought before the captain, promiſed to work his paſſage to England; which the captain in the end accepted, as the veſſel was in want of men.</p>
               <p>What, in the interim, was become of his unhappy pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents? They alas! ſtill lived, if people may be ſaid to live whoſe ſad days are ſpent in anguiſh and deſpair. The crimes which their ſon had committed, and with which the neighbourhood all around them rung, had forced them to renounce their place of habitation, and go down and live in Suſſex, in a ſolitary quarter near the ſea.</p>
               <p>A ſhort time after they were ſettled here, the ſhip, in which Paſcal was, arrived on that very part of the coaſt where they had fixed their retirement. For while they were a little way out to ſea, Paſcal, a thorough graduate in vice, had conſpired with ten or twelve deſperate fellows
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0360400703:203"/>of the crew, to murder every one on board who would not join in their conſpiracy, and ſo obtain poſſeſſion of the ſhip. They executed their infernal purpoſe; and ſoon after running the veſſel aſhore, they hoiſted out their boat at night, that they might come on ſhore, and pillage the inhabitants.</p>
               <p>That very night the unhappy Mr. Dawkins in his houſe was up, and watching by his wife's ſick bed. Her grief for Paſcal's wretched fortune had long preyed upon her conſtitution; and by this time, after having ſuffered grievouſly, ſhe felt the agonies of death upon her. In the intervals of her delirium, ſhe called out for Paſcal: Where, where are you, ſaid the dying mother? Come, that I may preſs you to my heart, and pardon you before I die. At this the door is ſuddenly burſt open, and ten villains ruſh into the dwelling. Paſcal, with a hatchet in his hand, was firſt, and led them on. The father comes to meet them with a candle; but before his ſon could recollect him—The remainder is too horrid to relate: ſuffice it, that Paſcal and his gang were apprehended on the ſpot, and ſuffered at the gallows.</p>
               <p>Children, if when you have read this ſtory, you dare think of giving way to any vice whatſoever, tremble at the poſſibility of your becoming criminal by degrees, and ending like Paſcal with the crime of parricide!</p>

                     <p>The Hon. Mr. Oddly's and his ſiſter's. I had got the ivory counters, when they aſked me if I meant to

                     <p>So I think; but children of their age may be a little giddy-headed. So go to them, Julia, and politely aſk if any one among them may not by miſtake have put them up into his pocket. Your commiſſion is a nice one, and requires a little management. Take care not to offend them, by inſinuating that you think any one of the company capable of taking them purpoſely.</p>

Thus, it is nothing but an abjectneſs that guides you, even in the work of your repentance; and it is not for his peace of mind that you would conceal it from him, for you are not afraid leſt your mama ſhould know it, becauſe ſhe would not beat you. It is not your idea to conſult her peace of mind.</p>

                     <p>No, my dear Eliza, he is not ſo guilty as you think him. He has told me every thing. It was to play a little with the counters out of doors that he took them; but when once the matter ſeemed conſidered as a theft, he was terrified at the idea of incurring my ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion.
