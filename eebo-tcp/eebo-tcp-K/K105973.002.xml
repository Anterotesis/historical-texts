            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THIS Journey is the continuation of my Tour in WALES. Another part will appear with all conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient ſpeed, and comprehend the remainder of <hi>Caernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire,</hi> the Iſle of <hi>Angleſea,</hi> the county of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> and conclude with ſome account of SHREWSBURY, the antient ſeat of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Princes; which will complete the ſecond volume, and probably all that I ſhall ſay of our Principality; for indolence, the forerunner of age, begins to check every new attempt.</p>
            <p>THIS book contains a journey from my own houſe to the ſummit of <hi>Snowdon,</hi> and takes in almoſt the whole of our <hi>Alpine</hi> tract.</p>
            <p>As far as the Title announces, it is complete. A more general Title-Page will be given with the ſecond part, and the journey continued regularly from p. 183.</p>

               <p>IN this, the ſequel of my former tour, I directed my courſe weſtward from <hi>Downing,</hi> paſſed by <hi>Whiteford,</hi> our pariſh-church, and aſcended the hill of <hi>Garreg,</hi> or the <hi>Rock,</hi> a high and moſt conſpicuous part of the country. The <hi>Romans</hi> took ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of it, and placed on its ſummit a <hi>Pharos,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">A PHAROS.</note> to conduct the navigators to and from <hi>Deva,</hi> along the difficult channel of the <hi>Seteia Portus.</hi> The building is ſtill remaining. I hope my friends will not deem me an antiquarian <hi>Quixote,</hi> and imagine me miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, in this my ſecond ſally, a building, hitherto ſuppoſed to have been a wind-mill, for a <hi>Roman</hi> light-houſe. It is tolerably entire; its form is circular; the height conſiderable; the inner diameter twelve feet and a half; the thickneſs of the walls four feet four inches. The doors, or entrances, are oppoſite to each other: over each is a ſquare funnel, like a chimney, which opens on the outſide, about half way up the building. On each ſide is
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0181900402:6"/>
a window. About four feet from the ground are three circular holes, lined with mortar, as is frequent in <hi>Roman</hi> buildings; and penetrate the whole wall, for purpoſes now unknown.</p>
               <p>WITHINSIDE are the veſtiges of a ſtair-caſe, which led to the floors, of which there appear to have been two. Along ſuch part of the upper, which was conſpicuous from the channel, are eight ſmall ſquare openings, caſed with free-ſtone (the reſt of the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing being of rude lime-ſtone, bedded in hard mortar) and each of theſe were ſeparated by wooden pannels, placed in deep grooves, the laſt ſtill in a perfect ſtate. In each of theſe partitions were placed the lights, which the <hi>Romans</hi> thought neceſſary to keep diſtinct, or to prevent from running into one, leſt they ſhould be miſtaken by ſeamen for a ſtar. <hi>Periculum in corrivatione ignium, ne ſidus exiſtimetur</hi>

               <p>To the building is very evidently a broad and raiſed road, pointing from the eaſt; and near its upper end are the marks of a trench, which ſurrounded and gave protection to this uſeful edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. Deſcend, and near the foot of the hill leave on the left <hi>Maen Achwynfan,</hi> the croſs deſcribed in my former tour. <hi>Glol,</hi> an incloſed mountain a little farther on, has among the buſhes various circular foundations of ſtone unmortared building. About a mile from hence, <note place="margin">NEWMARKET.</note> viſit the ſmall town of <hi>Newmarket,</hi> almoſt the entire creation of its then owner, <hi>John Wynne,</hi> 
                  <abbr>eſq</abbr> of <hi>Gop,</hi> who died in the preſent century. The antient name of the pariſh is <hi>Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawnyd,</hi> for which I can find no ſatisfactory reaſon. In the church-yard is a handſome old croſs. Here is fixed one of the charity-ſchcols, founded and opened in 1726, by doctor <hi>Daniel Williams,</hi> a diſſenting miniſter, with an endowment of eight pounds a year; a charity which he extended to every county in <hi>North Wales,</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing that at <hi>Wrexham,</hi> the place of his birth, by an annual
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0181900402:7"/>
ſalary of fifteen pounds. He alſo eſtabliſhed a fund, I believe, to each, from which the children are apprenticed, at five pounds apiece.</p>
               <p>FROM the town I aſcended the hill, <note place="margin">Cor.</note> called <hi>Copa'r'leni,</hi> on whoſe ſummit is a moſt enormous carnedd, or tumulus, formed of lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtones. It was probably the ſite of <hi>ſpecula,</hi> or exploratory tower, and memorial of ſome chieftain. If <hi>Roman,</hi> perhaps <hi>Paulinus</hi> gave name to it, <hi>Cop-Paulini.</hi> There is great uncertainty in theſe derivations: I may poſſibly as well abide by my former etymo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy of <hi>Cop yr Goleuni,</hi> or the Mount of Lights; for it might have been a place of ſignals by fire of the approach of an enemy by ſea <note n="*" place="bottom">Tour in Wales, i. 413.</note>, or a <hi>ſtation</hi> of the <hi>holy fires,</hi> the <hi>Coel Ceithie</hi> of the <hi>Druids,</hi> ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to the <hi>Karn Gollewa,</hi> the carn of lights, and <hi>Karn Leſkyz,</hi> or carn of burnings, of the <hi>Cornish,</hi> ſuppoſed by the learned BORLASE <note n="†" place="bottom">Antiq. Cornwall, 131.</note> to have been uſed for ſimilar purpoſes. The tract from hence to <hi>Caerwys</hi> was certainly a field of battle: no place in <hi>North Wales</hi> exhibits an equal quantity of <hi>tumuli;</hi> but all ſepulchral, as is proved by the urns diſcovered in them: they are of a far inferior ſize to the firſt, and covered with turf. It will not be too hazardous a conjecture to ſuppoſe, that in this place was the ſlaughter of the <hi>Ordovices</hi> by <hi>Agricola,</hi> when our gallant nation was nearly extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated. Part of the brow of the hill is called <hi>Bryn y Saethiau,</hi> or <hi>the Hill of Arrows,</hi> from being the ſtation of the archers in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement.</p>

               <p>DESCEND to the church and village of <hi>Llanaſa,</hi> the former dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>St. Aſaph,</hi> whoſe feſtival is kept on the firſt of <hi>May.</hi>

                  <hi>Laurence Child,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>St. Aſaph,</hi> in 1385, procured the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation of this church to ſupply his cathedral with lights <note n="*" place="bottom">Willi's St. Aſaph, 56, App. No. xxi.</note>, and repair the ruins occaſioned by the wars. In my approach from theſe high lands towards the ſhore, obſerve the ruins of a ſmall chapel at the little hamlet of <hi>Gweſpyr,</hi> near <hi>Trelacre,</hi> one of the ſeats of Sir <hi>Pyers Moſtyn,</hi> Baronet, a branch of the houſe of <hi>Moſtyn.</hi> His adjacent quarry is noted for the excellence of the free-ſtone; and his vaſt and profitable warren beneath, noted for the delicacy of the rabbets, by reaſon of their feeding on the maritime plants.</p>
               <p>PASS over <hi>Gronant-Moor.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">GRONANT.</note> There is a tradition, that its extent was ſo great, that the people on this ſide could hold converſation over the channel with thoſe of <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> This may be exagge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated; but from authentic records, it appears, that this flat was formerly very extenſive, and that it had been reduced to its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſcanty limits by the fury of the ſea, which ſtill poſſeſſes its antient place. Previous to that cataſtrophe, it was poſſeſſed by the ſee of <hi>St. Aſaph,</hi> by virtue of a grant made by <hi>Edward the Black Prince,</hi> ſon of <hi>Edward</hi> III. to <hi>Llewelyn ap Madoc,</hi> elected Biſhop of <hi>St. Aſaph</hi> in 1357. The inundation happened before the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> V. Previous to that time, the Biſhop paid annually into the exchequer at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> as an acknowlegement, the ſum of twenty marks: but <hi>Henry</hi> V. in 1414, and <hi>Henry</hi> VI. in 1445 and 1451, in conſideration of the misfortune, releaſed

the ſee from that rent<note n="*" place="bottom">Willis's St. Aſaph, 65. App. No. xxxi. xxxii.</note>. If this record did not remain an incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſlable proof of the ravages of the ocean on this part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, there exiſt other natural ones, that would have given rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable grounds for ſuſpicion. The <hi>Hyle ſands,</hi> which run for twelve or fourteen miles parallel to the narrow hundred of <hi>Wiral,</hi> in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and divided from <hi>Wales</hi> by a narrow channel, were once, in all probability, part of the firm land of <hi>England.</hi> A few miles to the weſt of <hi>Gronant-Moor,</hi> under the pariſh of <hi>Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geleu,</hi> in <hi>Denbighſhire,</hi> are to be ſeen at low water, very remote from the ſhore, bedded in the ſand, immenſe numbers of oak-trees, a foreſt before this event. Laſtly, in the church-yard wall of <hi>Abergelli</hi> is a dateleſs epitaph, in <hi>Welſh,</hi> ſignifying the perſon who was interred there lived three miles to the north of that ſpot, a tract now entirely poſſeſſed by the ſea.</p>
               <p>ON approaching <hi>Preſtatyn,</hi> about two miles from <hi>Trelacre,</hi> the flat becomes extremely fertile in corn, eſpecially wheat, which is of diſtinguiſhed excellence; and continues equally noted through all the flat tract, as far as <hi>Ruddlan,</hi> where it is interrupted for a ſpace by the marſh, and is again continued along the coaſt far beyond <hi>Abergeleu.</hi> A little below <hi>Preſtatyn</hi>-mill, in a meadow, is the ſite of its Caſtle: nothing more than an elevated ſpace, with foundations conſiſting of ſtone and mortar, and a foſs at ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from it, now remain. <note place="margin">PRESTATYN-CASTLE.</note> This little fortreſs was probably built by the <hi>Welſh,</hi> but wreſted from them by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who were poſſeſſed of it in 1167, the only time I find any mention of it, when it was deſtroyed by <hi>Owen Gwynedd, Cadwalader</hi> his brother,

               <p>THE hamlet and village of <hi>Preſtatyn</hi> lie in the pariſh of Meli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. This place was granted by <hi>Richard</hi> I. to <hi>Robert Banaſter,</hi> who enjoyed it for three years and a half, and built the town; which was deſtroyed by <hi>Owen Gwynedd. Robert de Crevecoeur,</hi> in the ſeventh year of <hi>Edward</hi> I. laid claim to it in right of his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor, <hi>Banaſter.</hi> An inquiſition was made, before a jury of twenty-four men <note n="*" place="bottom">Sebright's MSS.</note>: their determination was in favor of <hi>Robert;</hi> ſince I find, by another record, that he died poſſeſſed of lands in <hi>Maelwr Saeſneg</hi> and <hi>Preſtatyn,</hi> which he held by the ſervice of one knight's fee.</p>
               <p>THE road from hence to <hi>Diſerth</hi> is extremely pleaſant, at the foot of high hills, rich in lead ore, with a fine and fertile flat to the right. The white rock makes a conſpicuous figure on the left, and its ſides appeared deeply trenched by the miners in ſearch of ore. Near this place is the beginning of the vale of <hi>Clwyd,</hi> and the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the range of mountains, which bound it on the eaſt. At a ſmall diſtance from hence lies the church of <hi>Diſerth,</hi> in a pictureſque and romantic bottom, beneath ſome rude rocks: the church overſhaded with great yews, and the ſingular figure of ſome of the tombs, form a moſt ſtriking appearance. <note place="margin">DISERTH CHURCH.</note> A water-fall in the deep and rounded hollow of a rock, finely darkened with ivy, once gave additional beauty to this ſpot; but of late the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting of the waters to a mill, has robbed the place of this ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant variation. The ſtream, which is little inferior to that of <hi>Holywell,</hi> flows principally from a ſingle well, called <hi>Fynnon Aſa,</hi>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0181900402:11"/>
or <hi>St. Aſaph's Well,</hi> in a dingle in the pariſh of <hi>Cwm,</hi> about a mile diſtant. The fountain is incloſed with ſtone, in a polygonal form, and had formerly its votaries, like that of St. <hi>Winefrede.</hi>

               <p>THE caſtle occupied the ſummit of the rock, whoſe ſides are eſcarpée, or cut ſteep, to render the acceſs more difficult.

               <p>THE caſtle had been a handſome building, in a ſquare, with two extremes placed at oppoſite corners, with a double round tower at each; and a ſingle one at the two other corners. <note place="margin">CASTLE.</note> The court forms an irregular octagon. The ditch is large, faced on both ſides with ſtone. The ſteep ſlope to the river was defended by high walls, and ſquare towers: one is entire, and there are veſtiges of two others: the firſt is called <hi>Twr-y-Silod;</hi> another, in the caſtle, was named <hi>Twr-y-Brenhin,</hi> or the <hi>King's Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the ſouth of the caſtle, at about a furlong diſtance, is a large artificial mount, the ſite of another fortreſs, of very early date; the whole ſurrounded by a very deep foſs (including alſo the abby) which croſſes from the margin of the bank, near the aſcent of the preſent road to <hi>St. Aſaph,</hi> to another parallel road; near which it is continued, then turns and falls nearly into the ſouthern part of the

walled ditch of the caſtle: the whole forms a ſquare area, of very great extent. Theſe different works were formed at three ſeveral times.

               <p>I FIND it in poſſeſſion of <hi>Edward</hi> I. in 1277; who was ſo well convinced of its importance in the conqueſt of <hi>Wales,</hi> that he made it the rendezvous of all the forces deſtined for that purpoſe.

From their reſolutions were framed the famous STATUTE OF RHUDDLAN; in which, among many excellent inſtitutions, were introduced
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0181900402:19"/>
ſheriffs and coroners, their powers defined, and the principal crimes of the times pointed out: moſt of which were acts of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, rapine, and theft; ſuch as might be expected to exiſt among people: an evil which reſulted more from the turbulence of the times, than the want of wholeſome laws <note n="*" place="bottom">See the <hi>Statuta Walliae</hi> paſſim.</note>.</p>
               <p>A PIECE of antient building, called the Parlement Houſe, is ſtill to be ſeen in <hi>Rhuddlan;</hi> probably the place where the king ſat in council. From hence he actually practiſed the well-known deceit of giving them a prince born among them, who never ſpoke a word of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and whoſe life and converſation no man was able to ſtain <note n="†" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>THE bridge conſiſts of two arches.<note place="margin">BRIDGE.</note> It appears to have been rebuilt or repaired in 1595: that date, with the arms of <hi>St. Aſaph,</hi> and the initials of <hi>William Hughes,</hi> the biſhop of that time, being cut in the battlements. The tides flow very little higher than this place; and bring up to the bridge ſlats or veſſels of about ſeventy tons. The port of theſe parts is about three miles further, at the <hi>vorryd,</hi> or <hi>great ford,</hi> where the river diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charges itſelf into the ſea; and from whence much corn and tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber is exported.</p>
               <p>THE houſe called the <hi>Gwindy,</hi> or Wine Houſe, <note place="margin">GWINDY.</note> muſt not be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten. There are few towns in <hi>Wales</hi> which have not one of that name: but the uſe has long been loſt. In old times,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0181900402:20"/>
moſt gentlemen's houſes had one in their neighborhood, where they met their friends and retainers, to <hi>ymgampio,</hi> or to exert feats of activity. Here the gentleman kept a wine cellar, which he retailed for his own profit. Here they paſſed the day in archery, wreſtling, throwing the ſledge, and other manly exerciſes. At firſt, the drinking was moderate: but at length the purpoſe was abuſed; and theſe places were made the ſanctuary for all ſorts of crimes, committed by the dependents or friends of the owner of the <hi>Gwindy,</hi> who were recommended to his care: and there <hi>Llawruddion,</hi> i.e. perſons who came <hi>red-handed</hi> from a murder, were protected till compoſition could be made for their crimes.</p>

               <p>NEAR this place were certain lands, called <hi>Nunneland</hi> and <hi>St. Marieland</hi>

               <p>THE hoſpital, which exiſted in 1281, ſtood between the town and <hi>Bodyryddan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As ſoon as <hi>Edward</hi> I. had finiſhed the fortifications of <hi>Rhuddlan,</hi> and filled his new town with inhabitants, he and biſhop <hi>Anian</hi> II. made different petitions to the pope, to remove the ſee of <hi>St. Aſaph</hi> to this place <note n="‡" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Rymer,</hi> ii. 245, <hi>Willis's St. Aſaph,</hi> 45.149.155.</note> They urged the ſolitude and inſecurity of the former; its hazard from <hi>banditti;</hi> and the danger to which the body of the moſt glorious confeſſor <hi>St. Aſaph</hi> was continually expoſed: and the king in particular adds, the great ſafety of this place, by reaſon of the vaſt works he had completed. But theſe petitions never took effect: fruſtrated either by the death of the pope, or the exhortion of the archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to rebuild the cathedral on its antient ſite.</p>
               <p>A LITTLE beyond the priory I deſcended the bank, <note place="margin">ST. ASAPH.</note> and fording the <hi>Clwyd,</hi> ſoon came in ſight of <hi>St. Aſaph.</hi> The handſome exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive bridge, the little town, and the cathedral mixed with trees, form a moſt agreeable view. The place is ſeated on the ſlope of a pleaſant eminence: the cathedral on its ſummit. The <hi>Clwyd</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0181900402:22"/>
runs on the eaſtern ſide: the <hi>Elwy,</hi> a moſt turbulent ſtream; on the weſtern: and from the laſt is taken the <hi>Britiſh</hi> name of <hi>Llan-Elwy.</hi> The townſhip in which it ſtands, is alſo called <hi>Bryn-Paulin;</hi> and one part of it, <hi>Bron y Wylfa,</hi> or the <hi>brow of the watch:</hi> from which circumſtances, as well as the great fitneſs of the ſituation, between two rivers, I cannot but think that it was a place of encampment of <hi>Paulinus,</hi> in his way; to or from <hi>Mona.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ITS eccleſiaſtical hiſtory may be ſpoken of with more certainty. When <hi>Kentigern,</hi> biſhop of <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> was driven from his ſee in 543, he retired into <hi>Wales,</hi> and eſtabliſhed here a monaſtery for nine hundred and ſixty-five monks, inſtituted on the ſame plan with that of <hi>Bangor;</hi> part for labor, part for prayer. <note place="margin">SII.</note> Here he built a church; and having won over the <hi>British</hi> prince <hi>Maglo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunus,</hi> once his violent opponent, eſtabliſhed here a ſee, and was himſelf the firſt biſhop. Being recalled to <hi>Scotland,</hi> he nominated for ſucceſſor, <hi>Aſaph,</hi> or <hi>Haſſaph,</hi> a Briton of great piety and good family (being grandſon of <hi>Pabo pou Prydain).</hi> He died in 596, was buried in his cathedral, and gave name to the place.</p>
               <p>THE church was firſt built of wood; but ſoon after, of ſtone. In 1247, during the wars of <hi>Henry</hi> III. the dioceſe was deſtroyed by fire and ſword <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Matthew Paris,</hi> 642.</note>, and the biſhop, who ſided with the Engliſh, obliged to live on alms. In 1282, <note place="margin">CATHEDRAL.</note> the cathedral was burnt down; but ample amends was made to the ſee, by the grant of <hi>Edward</hi> I. of lands in <hi>Newmarket, Nannerch, Dincolyn, Cwed y Mynedd,</hi> and a rich mineral tract in <hi>Diſerth:</hi> four hundred and nine acres were given, each of which appears at that time to be valued at only
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0181900402:23"/>
ſix-pence <note n="*" place="bottom">Sebright MSS.</note>. In 1402, the church underwent new misfortunes: being burnt by <hi>Owen Glyndwr,</hi> together with the palace, and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons houſes; who, ſtrange to ſay! ſoon after brought over to his party, <hi>John Trevor,</hi> the injured biſhop of the ſee, who was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived on account of his revolt. After this, the church remained in ruins for eighty years, when it was re-built by that worthy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, <hi>Richard Redman.</hi> The ſame building ſtill remains, hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome, plain, and neat. The preſent dean and chapter are now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>building (out of a fund veſted in them for that purpoſe) the choir, after the inevitable dilapidations of time in the ſpace of near four hundred years. The good imitation of the gothic, and the happy copy in the eaſt window, of the noble remains in <hi>Tintern</hi> abby, will add no ſmall beauty to the church, and credit to the idea.</p>
               <p>THE tombs are very few.<note place="margin">TOMBS.</note> Here is one in an epiſcopal habit, ſuppoſed to commemorate that munificent biſhop, <hi>David ap Owen,</hi> who died in 1512; and in the church-yard, near the weſt door, is a plain altar monument of biſhop <hi>Iſaac Barrow,</hi> who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted in 1680: and whoſe pious addreſs I can read without any offence, howſoever papiſtical zealots may think it.

The bricks are admirable, and appear to have been made in <hi>Holland;</hi> and the model of the houſe was probably brought from <hi>Flanders,</hi> where this ſpecies of building was not unfrequent.

               <p>HER portrait is an excellent three-quarters, on wood. The plate repreſents the dreſs.

               <p>SEVERAL of the ſons were men of diſtinguiſhed characters. The third, <hi>William,</hi> was a ſea captain, and an eminent poet. His early education was at <hi>Oxford:</hi> but his military turn led him abroad, where he ſignalized himſelf as ſoldier and ſailor. He tranſlated the pſalms into <hi>Welſh</hi> metre, and finiſhed them on <hi>Jan.</hi> 4th, 1595, <hi>apud</hi> Scutum <hi>inſulam occidentalium Indorum;</hi> which, as well as his <hi>Barddoniaeth,</hi> or art of <hi>Welſh</hi> poetry, were publiſhed in <hi>London:</hi> the firſt in 1603, the other in 1593<note n="*" place="bottom">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thomas,</hi> the fourth ſon, became lord mayor of <hi>London,</hi> and was the founder of the family of <hi>Chirkcaſtle.</hi> It is recorded, that having married a young wife in his old age, the famous ſong of <hi>Room for cuckolds, here comes my lord mayor!</hi> was invented on the occaſion<note n="*" place="bottom">Myddelton Pedigree, MS.</note>.</p>

               <p>I NOW ſpeak of the ſixth ſon, <hi>Hugh;</hi> a perſon whoſe uſeful life would give luſtre to the greateſt family. This gentleman (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Sir <hi>Hugh</hi>) diſplayed very early his great talents; and began, as we are told by himſelf, by ſearching for coal within a mile of his native place. His attempt did not meet with ſucceſs: his genius was deſtined to act on a greater ſtage. The Capital af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him ample ſpace for his vaſt attempts: few readers need be told, that he planned and brought to perfection, the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of ſupplying the city with water. This plan was meditated in the reign of <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> but no one was found bold enough to attempt it. In 1608, the dauntleſs WELSHMAN ſtept forth, and SMOTE THE ROCK: and on <hi>Michaelmas</hi> 1613, the waters flowed into the thirſting metropolis. He brought it, in defiance of hills and vallies, reckoning every winding, near thirty-nine miles; conveyed it by aqueducts in ſome places; in others pierced the
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0181900402:34"/>
high grounds, and gave it a ſubterraneous courſe. He was a true prototype of the later genius of ſimilar works; but he ſacrificed private fortune to the public good. Two thouſand pounds a month, which he gained from the <hi>Cardiganſhire</hi> mines, were ſwallowed up in this river<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Fodina Regales.</hi> 32.</note>. He received the empty honor of ſeeing himſelf attended by the king, his court, and all the corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>London,</hi> among whom was his brother (deſigned mayor for the enſuing year). The waters guſhed out in their preſence, and the great architect received their applauſe, and knighthood; and, in 1622, the title of baronet. His own fair fortune being expended on an undertaking, which now brings in to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors an amazing revenue, he was reduced to become a hireling ſurveyor, and was eminently uſeful in every place where draining or mining was requiſite. I ſhall have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to ſpeak of ſome other of his labors in the courſe of this book. He died in 1631<note n="†" place="bottom">Myddelton Pedegree MS.</note>. Sir — <hi>Myddelton,</hi> the laſt baronet of this branch of the family, died a few years ago. The preſent repreſentative is a widow in diſtreſsful circumſtances: Sir <hi>Hugh</hi> left a certain number of ſhares to the <hi>Goldſmith</hi>'s company, to be divided among the poor members; but, as the huſband of this poor woman happened not to be of the company, the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of the greateſt benefactor <hi>London</hi> ever had, is, I truſt through ignorance of her caſe, permitted to linger away her days in cruel penury.</p>

ſmall arches; above, a multitude of quarterings proclame his long deſcent. He derived himſelf from the <hi>Roſendales</hi> of the north, who ſettled at <hi>Foxhall,</hi> in this neighborhood, in 1297, by marriage with the heireſs of the place. He himſelf was of a branch, which fixed at <hi>Denbigh.</hi> He was educated at <hi>Oxford,</hi> a commoner of <hi>Brazen-noſe</hi> college, and maſter of arts. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to his native place, an accompliſhed gentleman. He ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died at the univerſity the healing art; but is celebrated as a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of great eloquence, an excellent rhetorician, and ſound philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher. After the panegyric paſſed on him by <hi>Cambden,</hi> it would be preſumptious to add any thing relative to his great ſkill in the antiquities of our country. He practiſed, for his amuſement, phyſic and muſic. The motto on his portrait, in poſſeſſion of his repreſentative <hi>John Lloyd,</hi> of <hi>Aſton,</hi> 
                  <abbr>eſq</abbr> expreſſes his liberal turn of mind: <hi>Hwy pery klod Nagolyd;</hi> FAME IS BETTER THAN WEALTH. In medicine, and the ſtudy of antiquities, he has left ſeveral proofs of his knowlege, which ſeems to have been quite unconfined. He made the map of <hi>England,</hi> for his friend <hi>Ortelius.</hi> For his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-law, lord <hi>Lumley,</hi> (whoſe ſiſter he married) he formed a large collection of uſeful and curious books; which were after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards purchaſed by <hi>James</hi> I. and now make the moſt valuable part of the <hi>Britiſh Muſeum</hi>

This noble building was begun in 1579, as appears by the date on a foundation-ſtone. It was to this purpoſe; for at preſent it is much defaced:

<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0181900402:40"/>
but it is ſaid, that when the earl of Eſſex paſſed through <hi>Denbigh,</hi> on his <hi>Iriſh</hi> expedition, he borrowed the money deſtined for the purpoſe, which was never repayed; and by that means, the church was left unfiniſhed<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Foulk</hi>'s Papers.</note>.</p>
               <p>THE Caſtle crowns the ſummit of the hill,<note place="margin">CASTLE.</note> one ſide of which is quite precipitous. The entrance is very magnificent, beneath a gothic arch, over which is the ſtatue of <hi>Henry Lacy,</hi> ſitting in ſtately flowing robes. On each ſide of the gate-way ſtood a large octagonal tower. The breaches in it are vaſt and awful: they ſerve to diſcover the antient manner of building: a double wall appears to have been built, with a great vacancy between, into which was poured all forts of rubbiſh, ſtone, and hot mortar, which time conſolidated to a ſtony hardneſs. This part, as <hi>Leland</hi> ſays, was never completed, the work having been deſerted by the earl, on the loſs of his eldeſt ſon, who was accidentally drowned in the well, whoſe opening is ſtill to be ſeen in the caſtle-yard. <hi>Charles</hi> I. lay here on the 23d of <hi>September,</hi> 1645, after his retreat from <hi>Cheſter,</hi> in a tower ſtill called <hi>Siamber y Brenbin,</hi> or the <hi>King's Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE proſpect through the broken arches is extremely fine, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending in parts over the whole vale, and all its eaſtern hills, from <hi>Moel Venlli</hi> to <hi>Diſerth</hi> rock; a rich view, but deficient in water: the river <hi>Clwyd</hi> being too ſmall to be ſeen; and in great rains ſo furious, as to overflow a great ſpace of the meadowy tract.</p>

               <p>THE conſtitution of this borough, and its origin, will be fully explained by the following tranſcript, communicated to me by one of its burgeſſes.

                  <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> the 10th of <hi>December,</hi> in the ſecond year of his reign, confirmed the aforeſaid grants, and by his ſaid letters patent did grant unto the ſaid burgeſſes, their heirs and aſſigns, being <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> common of paſture for all manner of cattle, at all times in the year, in the common paſture of the town and foreſt of <hi>Lleweney;</hi> and that the burgeſſes aforeſaid, and their heirs and aſſigns, ſhould be free and acquitted, in all his dominions and territories in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> ſoc, ſac, toll, and them, laſtage, ſtallage, payage, pannage, pontage, murage, and other cuſtoms whatſoever.

killed him on the ſpot, and then carried away his miſtreſs, and married her the ſame day; ſo that ſhe was a maid, widow, and wife twice, in one day. From <hi>Roger,</hi> the eldeſt ſon of the match, deſcended the <hi>Myddeltons</hi> of this place.</p>
               <p>I MENTION <hi>Thomas Myddelton,</hi> another of his progeny, only to prove, that the cuſtom of the <hi>Iriſh</hi> howl, or <hi>Scotch Coranich,</hi> was in uſe among us; for we are told he was buried <hi>cum magno dolore et clamore cognatorum et propinquorum omnium.</hi>

               <p>HAVING made <hi>Gwaenynog</hi> my head quarters for this neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, I one day viſited from thence <hi>Henllan,</hi> the pariſh church of theſe parts; remarkable for the ſchiſm between church and ſteeple: the firſt having retreated into the bottom, the laſt maintains its ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on the top of the hill.

He died <hi>November</hi> the 4th, 1637. He had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of repreſenting the borough of <hi>Caernarvon;</hi> and once occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned much diverſion to the houſe, by aſſerting, in one of his ſpeeches, "that he remembered fourteen years <hi>before</hi> he was he was born, &amp;c. &amp;c."

               <p>FROM hence, after a ride of a few miles, I reached <hi>Dyffryn Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led,</hi> or the vale of the river <hi>Alled,</hi> a very narrow tract, bounded by high hills, and of late ornamented by the magnificent ſeat built by Mrs. <hi>Meyric.</hi> At the head of the valley ſtand the village and church of <hi>Llanſannan,</hi> dedicated to <hi>St. Sannan,</hi> confeſſor and hermit; deſcended (for our very ſaints boaſt of their pedegree) from antient parentage, near the territory of the father of <hi>St. We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefrede,</hi> with whom he maintained ſtrict friendſhip.

               </p>
               <p>AT about a mile diſtance from <hi>Llandrillo,</hi> I again croſſed the <hi>Dee,</hi> at <hi>Pont Gilan,</hi> a bridge of two arches, over a deep and black water. Beyond this ſpot, the valley acquires new beauties, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially on the right. The valley here contracts greatly: the road runs at the foot of a brow, of a ſtupendous height, covered with venerable oaks, which have kept their ſtubborn ſtation, amidſt the rudeſt of rocks, which every now and then ſhew their grey and broken fronts, amidſt the deep verdure of the foliage of trees, which ſo ſtrangely find nutriment amongſt them. The growth of the oak, in forcing its root downward, frequently rends thſe vaſt ſtrata, whoſe fragments often appear ſcattered at the baſe, of moſt amazing ſizes. The whole ſcenery requires the pencil of a <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vator Roſa:</hi> and here our young artiſts would find a fit place to ſtudy the manner of that great painter of wild nature.</p>
               <p>A LITTLE beyond the extremity of this romantic part, in an opening on the right,<note place="margin">ST.

               <p>REACH <hi>Bala,</hi> a ſmall town in the pariſh of <hi>Llanyekil,</hi> noted for its vaſt trade in woollen ſtockings, and its great markets every <hi>Saturday</hi> morning, when from two to five hundred pounds worth are ſold each day, according to the demand.

                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0181900402:73"/>
in this effeminate employ. During winter the females, through love of ſociety, often aſſemble at one another's houſes to knit; ſit round a fire, and liſten to ſome old tale, or to ſome an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient ſong, or the ſound of a harp; and this is called <hi>Cymmorth Gwau,</hi> or, the knitting aſſembly.</p>
               <p>MUCH of the wool is bought at the great fairs at <hi>Llanrwſt,</hi> in <hi>Denbighſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>CLOSE to the ſouth-eaſt end of the town, is a great artificial mount,<note place="margin">TOMMEN Y BALA.</note> called <hi>Tommen y Bala,</hi> in the ſummer time uſually covered in a pictureſque manner with knitters, of both ſexes, and all ages. From the ſummit is a fine view of <hi>Llyn-tegid,</hi> and the adjacent mountains. On the right appear the two <hi>Arennigs, Vawr</hi> and <hi>Vach;</hi> beyond the farther end, ſoar the lofty <hi>Arans,</hi> with their two heads, <hi>Aran Mowddwy</hi> and <hi>Penllyn;</hi> and beyond all, the great <hi>Cader Idris</hi> cloſes the view.</p>
               <p>THIS mount appears to have been <hi>Roman,</hi> and placed here, with a caſtelet on its ſummit, to ſecure the paſs towards the ſea, and keep our mountaneers in ſubjection. The Welſh, in after time, took advantage of this, as well as other works of the ſame nature.</p>
               <p>THE town is of a very regular form: the principal ſtreet very ſpacious, and the leſſer fall into it at right angles. I will not deny, but that its origin might have been <hi>Roman.</hi>

               <p>THE waters are diſcharged under <hi>Pont Mwnwgl y Llyn,</hi> a bridge of three arches.

public road, but is very apparent on both ſides. The mount, or keep, was on the lower, immediately above the river; and the veſtiges of a wall are ſtill evident. This was ſubſervient to the ſame purpoſes as the others; for there muſt have been, from the nature of the ground, a travellable road on both ſides of the lake. This I apprehend to have been the caſtle of <hi>Bala,</hi> which <hi>Llewelyn ap Jorwerth</hi> founded in 1202<note n="*" place="bottom">

They were very prevalent in the time of <hi>Gildas,</hi> in the ſixth century, when our anceſtors ſtrongly retained the idolatry of the <hi>Druids</hi> among their <hi>Chriſtian</hi> rites: and, notwithſtanding the fulmination of many a monarch<note n="†" place="bottom">Edgar and Canute.</note>, it kept its ground; and hydromancy ſtill remains practiſed among us; of which I ſhall have occaſion to ſpeak of more than one kind.</p>
               <p>I FOUND that I could here,<note place="margin">KERRIG Y DRU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>IDION</note> with greater eaſe than from any other place, digreſs to <hi>Kerrig y Druidion;</hi> a pariſh a few miles to the north, in the county of <hi>Denbigh,</hi> noted for certain <hi>Druidical</hi> remains, which gave name to the place. After a dreary ride, I found myſelf diſappointed; theſe ſacred reliques having been profanely carried away, and converted into a wall. It is therefore from the annotator on <hi>Cambden</hi>
                  <note n="‡" place="bottom">II. 813.</note>, and the drawings preſerved by him among the <hi>Sebright</hi> MSS. that I muſt form my deſcription.</p>
               <p>THE largeſt was a fine ſpecimen of the <hi>Britiſh Kiſt vaen,</hi> or ſtone cheſt. It conſiſted of one ſtone at top, placed inclining to the north, and was, when meaſured by Mr. <hi>Llwyd,</hi> ten feet long, ſupported by a ſtone on each ſide about ſeven feet long, and near
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0181900402:80"/>
two and a half broad. Under one end was a ſtone, three feet long; at the other, one of the length of two feet. The hollow beneath was only ſeven feet long, three and a half broad, and only two and a half high; which ſufficiently ſhews, that theſe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numents had not been the cells of <hi>Druids;</hi> their uſes, therefore, muſt: have been ſepulchral, according to the conjecture of Doctor <hi>Borlaſe.</hi> The antient natives of our iſle did not always burn their dead. Skeletons have been diſcovered in ſimilar <hi>Kiſt vaens,</hi> at full length: in ſuch as this, they might lie commodiouſly, with all the parade of arms, often buried with them. Around this, was a circle of ſtones, incloſing an area of about forty paces in diameter; and the precinct might be formed with the intent of keeping people at a reſpectable diſtance from the remains, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of ſome mighty chieftain. This monument went by the name of <hi>Karchar Kynric Rwth;</hi> not that it ever was uſed for that purpoſe originally; but there is a tradition, that in aftertimes, a little tyrant of that name, in the neighborhood, was wont to cram thoſe who offended him, into the hollow of theſe ſtones; which might ſerve for the purpoſes of torment as well as the <hi>little eaſe</hi> in the tower of <hi>London,</hi> or the iron cages of the <hi>Baſtille.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE other <hi>Kiſt vaen</hi> was nearly ſimilar to the firſt; but no mention is made of the circle of ſtones: probably they were taken away before Mr. <hi>Llwyd</hi> viſited the place.</p>

               <p>RETURN to <hi>Bala,</hi> and continue my journey on the ſouth ſide of the lake, a moſt beautiful ride.

               </p>
               <p>LEAVE on the right another antient ſeat, <hi>Caer Gai,</hi> placed on an eminence. <hi>Cambden</hi> ſays, it was a caſtle, built by one <hi>Caius,</hi> a <hi>Roman;</hi> the <hi>Britons</hi> aſcribe it to <hi>Gai,</hi> foſter-brother to king <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur.</hi> It probably was <hi>Roman,</hi> for multitudes of coins have been found in different parts of the neighborhood; and it is certain, that it had been a fortreſs to defend this paſs, for which it is well adapted, both by ſituation, and form of the hill.</p>
               <p>I PROCEEDED about two miles farther,<note place="margin">CASTELL CORN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DOCHON.</note> to viſit another, ſeated a mile from the <hi>Dolgelleu</hi> road, on the ſummit of a high rock, which bears the name of <hi>Caſtell Corndochon,</hi> the origin of which we are equally ignorant of. Two ſides of the rock are precipitous. In the front of the caſtle is cut a deep foſs: the caſtle conſiſted of an oblong tower, rounded at the extremity; and its meaſure within is forty-three feet by twenty-two. Behind that, and joined to it by a wall, are the ruins of a ſquare tower; this lies in the main
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0181900402:82"/>
body of the fortreſs, whoſe form, as <hi>Cambden</hi> obſerves, inclines to oval. This had been very conſiderable; was built with mortar, made of gravel and ſea ſhells; and was faced with free-ſtone, ſquared, and well cut.</p>
               <p>I RETURNED towards <hi>Caer Gai;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">LLAN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>UWCHLLYN.</note> and, not far from thence, to the village and <hi>church</hi> of <hi>Llan-uwchllyn.</hi> In the laſt is the figure of an armed man, with a conic helmet, and mail muffler round his chin and neck: on his breaſt is a wolf's head, and on his belly another; and in the intervening ſpace, three roſes. The firſt are the arms of <hi>Ririd Vlaidd;</hi> the others of <hi>Kynedda Wledig,</hi> or, <hi>The Warlike,</hi> a <hi>Cumbrian</hi> prince, whoſe ſons (after their father had been defeated by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> in the ſixth century) retired, and poſſeſſed themſelves of theſe parts of <hi>Wales:</hi> and from <hi>Mei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion,</hi> a grandſon of his, is ſaid to be given the name of <hi>Meirionith</hi> to this ſhire. <hi>Ririd</hi> was lord of <hi>Pen-Llyn,</hi> which ſignifies the head of the lake, and forms one of the hundreds of <hi>Meirionithſhire.</hi> It had alſo its caſtle, which probably was that of <hi>Corndochon.</hi> Around the margin of the tomb is a mutilated inſcription, which, as far as I could diſcover, run thus: <hi>Hic jacet Johannes ap * * * * ap Madoc ap J—eth, cujus animae pr—etur.

               <p>THIS honored ſtream is now known by the name of <hi>Avon Twrch;</hi> is a fierce mountain torrent, precipitating itſelf from the <hi>Aran;</hi> and croſſes a road from whence I firſt begin my journey among the <hi>Alps</hi> of our country, and aſcend from hence, then ſink into very deep bottoms, bounded on each ſide by fields of ſuch ſteepneſs, as to put the inhabitants to great difficulties in the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation. Woods, eſpecially of birch, vary the ſcene. On the right,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0181900402:84"/>
tower the vaſt hills of <hi>Aran;</hi> or rather, two heads, ariſing from one baſe.</p>
               <p>ARRIVE at the foot of <hi>Bwlch y Groes,</hi> or the paſs of <hi>The Croſs,</hi> one of the moſt terrible in <hi>North Wales.</hi> The height is gained by going up an exceeding ſteep and narrow zig-zag path: the paſs itſelf is a dreary heathy flat, on which I ſuppoſe the croſs ſtood, to excite the thankſgiving of travellers, for having ſo well accompliſhed their arduous journey. The deſcent on the other ſide, is much greater, and very tedious, into the long and narrow vale of <hi>Mowddwy.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">VALE OF MOWDDWY.</note> It is ſeven or eight miles long; and ſo contracted, as ſcarcely to admit a meadow at the bottom. Its boundaries are vaſt hills, generally very verdant, and fine ſheep walks; but one on the left exhibits a horrible front, being ſo ſteep, as to balance between precipice and ſlope: it is red and naked, and too ſteep to admit of vegetation; and a ſlide from its ſummit would be as fatal as a fall from a perpendicular rock. In one place on the right, the mountains open, and furniſh a gap to give ſight to another pictureſque and ſtrange view, the rugged and wild ſummit of <hi>Aran Mowddwy,</hi> which ſoars above with tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendous majeſty.</p>
               <p>THERE is a beauty in this vale, which is not frequent in others of theſe mountanous countries. The incloſures are all divided by excellent quickſet hedges, and run far up the ſides of the hills, in places ſo ſteep, that the common traveller would ſcarcely find footing. Numbers of little groves are interſperſed; and the hills above them ſhew a fine turf to the top, where the bog and heath commence, which give ſhelter to multitudes of red grous, and a few black. But their conſequences to theſe parts are infinitely
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0181900402:85"/>
greater, in being the beds of fuel to all the inhabitants. The turberies are placed very remote from their dwellings; and the turf, or peat, is gotten with great difficulty. The roads from the brows of the mountains, in general, are too ſteep even for a horſe;<note place="margin">TURF SLEDGES</note> the men therefore carry up on their backs, a light ſledge, fill it with a very conſiderable load, and drag it, by means of a rope placed over their breaſt, to the brink of the ſlope<note n="*" place="bottom">At this time the turberies lie at a great diſtance from the brow of the hill; the natives are therefore obliged to bring a horſe by a round-about way to them, which aſſiſts in dragging the turf to the brink of the ſlope, where men ſupply its place.</note>; then go before, and draw it down, ſtill preceding, and guiding its mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which at times have been ſo violent, as to overturn and draw along with it the maſter, to the hazard of his life, and not without conſiderable bodily hurt.</p>

                     </hi> the poem of <hi>St. Tydecho,</hi> who lived in the time of <hi>Malgwyn Gwynedd.</hi>
                  </note> is written in verſe, by <hi>Dafydd Llwyd ap Llewelyn ap Gryffydd,</hi> lord of <hi>Mathafarn;</hi> a perſon who had a great hand in bringing in <hi>Henry</hi> VII, by feeding his countrymen with prophecies, that one of them was to deliver <hi>Wales</hi> from the <hi>Engliſh</hi> yoke, by which means thouſands of them were induced to riſe, under Sir <hi>Rhys ap Thomas,</hi> and join <hi>Henry,</hi> then earl of <hi>Richmond,</hi> at <hi>Milford.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THIS illuſtrious bard informs us, that <hi>Tydecho</hi> had been an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot in <hi>Armorica,</hi> and came over here in the time of king <hi>Arthur;</hi>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:0181900402:86"/>
but after the death of that hero, when the <hi>Saxons</hi> over-ran moſt of the kingdom, the ſaint retired, and led here a moſt auſtere life, lying on the bare ſtones, and wearing a ſhirt of hair: yet he employed his time uſefully, was a tiller of the ground, and kept hoſpitality. <hi>Malgwyn Gwynedd,</hi> then a youth, took offence at the ſaint, and ſeized his oxen; but wild ſtags were ſeen the next day, performing their office, and a grey wolf harrowing after them. <hi>Malgwyn,</hi> enraged at this, brought his milk-white dogs to chace the deer, while he ſat on the blue ſtone, to enjoy the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion; but when he attempted to riſe, he found his breech im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably fixed to the rock, ſo that he was obliged to beg pardon of the ſaint, who, on proper reparation, was ſo kind as to free him from his aukward pain.</p>
               <p>So far legend. That <hi>St. Tydecho</hi> might have lived, and that <hi>Malgwyn Gwynedd</hi> did live a prince of our country, I make no doubt; and that the former did receive from the prince the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges it once enjoyed, of ſanctuary for man and beaſt, is equally probable: every offender, however criminal, met with protection here. Legend ſays, that it was to endure for a hundred ages; but, blind to futurity! the reformation was not foreſeen. This place was alſo exempted from all fighting, burning, and killing; nor was it permitted to affront any of the inhabitants, without making the moſt ample reparation.</p>
               <p>THE lands of <hi>Tydecho</hi> were alſo freed from mortuaries, clames, oppreſſion, and that great duty, which moſt places were ſubject to, the <hi>Gobr Merched,</hi> the penalty of incontinence; which the ſaint, in tenderneſs to the poſſible frailty of his flock, wiſely took care to get it exempted from.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:0181900402:87"/>ABOUT four or five miles farther, I reached <hi>Dinas y Mowydwy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">DINAS MOWD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DWY.</note> ſeated on the plain of an eminence, at the junction of three vales, beneath the rock <hi>Craig y Dinas;</hi> whoſe peat paths I now ſurvey with horror, reflecting on a frolick of my younger days, in climbing to its ſummit, to enjoy the pleaſure of darting down again in one of the peat ſledges.

               <p>THE powers of this capital over a diſtrict,<note place="margin">PRIVILEGES.</note> which comprehends this large pariſh, and ſeven out of the eight townſhips of that of <hi>Mallwyd,</hi> are conſiderable. The corporation conſiſts of a mayor,

aldermen, recorder, and ſeveral burgeſſes. The mayor tries crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals; but, as the late worthy magiſtrate, a very honeſt ſmith, told me, that, for ſome years paſt, they have not adventured to whip; the ſtocks, or confinement in the <hi>vag-vawr,</hi> is the utmoſt ſeverity they have exerted: but then they retain the excluſive power of licenſing ale-houſes in their diſtrict, and are likewiſe juſtices of the peace as far as the limits of their little reign.</p>
               <p>THE recorder (in abſence of the lord) tries all matters of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, not exceeding forty ſhillings; and the attornies, whoſe fees do not exceed half a crown, are choſen from the lettered part of the community, or thoſe who can read.</p>
               <p>I WAS accommodated with entertainment at the manor-houſe, from whence I took a delightful walk of about two miles, along the vale, on the banks of the <hi>Dyvi.</hi> The valley expands, and the hills ſink in height, towards the weſt.

               <p>ONE of the beautiful yew trees in the church-yard, is extremely well worth notice.

They watched their opportunity, when he was paſſing through theſe parts from <hi>Montgomeryſhire</hi> aſſizes, to way-lay him, in the thick woods of <hi>Mowddwy,</hi> at a place now called, from the deed, <hi>Llydiart y Barwn;</hi> where they had cut down ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral long trees, to croſs the road, and impede the paſſage. They then diſcharged on him a ſhower of arrows; one of which ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his face, he took out, and broke.

               <p>THIS paſs is noted for being one of the three places,<note place="margin">CONVENTION THERE.</note> in which were aſſembled, ſix years after the wars of <hi>Glyndwr,</hi> all the great men of certain diſtricts, in order to enforce the obſervation of juſtice by their own weight, without any other legal ſanction. This, perhaps, was occaſioned by the mercileſs laws enacted againſt the <hi>Welſh</hi> by <hi>Henry</hi> IV. At each of theſe places, they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into a compact to cauſe juſtice to be done for all wrongs
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0181900402:92"/>
inflicted, before and after the wars, but not during that turbulent period. Every one was to have his goods, or land, which had been forced from him, reſtored without law-ſuit; and any goods detained after this, were to be deemed as ſtolen: or if his lord ſold them, he was fined ten pounds, and the goods, or their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, to the owner. If the refractory perſon was hanged, or died a natural death, the demand lay good againſt the wife, heirs, or executors: but if they or ſhe denied the demand, the plaintiff muſt procure his compurgators, viz. ſix perſons with him, to ſwear to the right of his clame; but (like the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in caſes of jury) the defendant had a right to challenge one of the ſix; and another was to be provided in his ſtead.</p>
               <p>AFTER this, follow various regulations for reſtoring the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the country in general; and ſeveral laws relative to waifs and eſtrays, vagrants, bail, recovery of debts, manſlaughter, thefts, duty of officers, &amp;c. The code concludes with valuation of ſeveral goods and chattels, for which ſatisfaction was to be made. For example, a horſe and mare, on the oath of the owner and two neighbors, were valued at ten ſhillings; a foal at twenty pence; an ox at a mark; a cow at ten ſhillings; the hire of an ox, and the milk of a cow, were alſo valued; an ewe was eſteemed at ſixteen pence, her wool at four pence, her milk at two pence, and her lamb at eight pence.</p>
               <p>As a proof of the high value of arms, and that we had few manufactures of that kind, a two-handed ſword was valued at ten ſhillings, a one-handed at ſix ſhillings and eight pence, and a ſteel buckler at two ſhillings and eight pence: but, what is very
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0181900402:93"/>
ſingular; a bow, which themſelves could make, was valued at ſixteen pence, and an arrow at ſix pence.</p>
               <p>To all theſe laws, no penalty was annexed for the breach; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the forfeiture of the benefit of the compact, which, in thoſe unſettled times, was probably ſufficient, as it left the party unſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and friendleſs.</p>
               <p>DESCEND from hence,<note place="margin">DOLGELLEU.</note> along very bad ſtoney roads, to <hi>Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelleu;</hi> every entrance to which is barred by a turnpike, in imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of other places; and every approach mended for a ſhort ſpace, by help of the ſcanty tolls. The town is ſmall; the ſtreets diſpoſed in a moſt irregular manner; but the ſituation is in a beautiful vale, fertile, well wooded, and embelliſhed with num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of pretty ſeats, and watered by the river <hi>Onion;</hi> over which, on account of its floods, is a bridge of ſeveral arches. The town takes its name from its being placed in a dale abundant in hazels. It has nothing in it remarkable but the church, which, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding it is pew-leſs, is a good building. Within is the monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Meiric Vychan ap Ynyr Vychan,</hi> of the neighboring houſe of <hi>Nanney,</hi> fifth in deſcent from prince <hi>Cadwgan,</hi> ſon of <hi>Bleyddyn ap Cynvyn,</hi> who reſided there, and in whoſe poſterity it continues to this time; He is armed in a cloſe mail helmet and neck-guard, ſword in hand, and with a ſhort mantle over the reſt of his armour.</p>

I ſkirted the mountain for about two miles, left on the right the ſmall lake of <hi>Llyn Gwernan,</hi> and began the aſcent along a narrow ſteep horſe-way, perhaps the higheſt road in <hi>Britain,</hi> being a common paſſage even for loaden
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0181900402:94"/>
horſes, into <hi>Llan-vibangel-y-Pennent,</hi> a vale on the other ſide. On gaining the brow of the hill, I found it to be a very extenſive paſture of coarſe graſs, mixed with a little bog. The hill ſlopes from hence upwards: the ſteeper part to the higheſt peak, or the <hi>Pen yr Cader,</hi> grows more and more rocky: the approach to the ſummit extremely ſo, and covered with huge fragments of diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lored rocks, very rugged, and cemented by a ſemivitrified mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which gives them a very vulcanic look, added to their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, adventitious appearance. I met with, on my aſcent, quantities of pumice, of the ſame cellular kind with the <hi>toadſtone of Derbyſhire,</hi> but of a green color. The day proved ſo wet and miſty, that I loſt the enjoyment of the great view from the ſummit. I could only ſee that the ſpot I was on was a rude ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregate of ſtrangely diſordered maſſes. I could at intervals per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a ſtupendous precipice on one ſide, where the hill recedes inwards, forming a ſort of theatre, with a lake at the bottom; yet very high, in compariſon of the baſe of the mountain. On the other ſide, at a nearer diſtance, I ſaw <hi>Craig Cay,</hi> a great rock, with a lake beneath, lodged in a deep hollow; poſſibly the crater of an antient <hi>Vulcano.</hi> This is ſo excellently expreſſed by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable pencil of my kinſman, Mr. <hi>Wilſon,</hi> that I ſhall not at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt the deſcription.</p>
               <p>IN deſcending from the <hi>Cader;</hi> I kept on the edge of the greater precipice, till I came near the <hi>Cyfrwy,</hi> another peak. The whole ſpace, for a conſiderable way, was covered with looſe ſtones, in the form of a ſtream, ſloping from the precipitous ſide. Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes of them were columnar,<note place="margin">COLUMNS.</note> but not jointed, ſquare, or penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonal; none erect, but lying very diſorderly, in all directions.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0181900402:95"/>
Some appeared hanging down the face of the precipice; the ends of others were peeping out at a vaſt depth beneath me, which ſhewed the great thickneſs of the ſtream. I wiſh the day had been more favorable; but I hope another traveller will ſurround the whole, and make a more ſatisfactory relation of this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, than I have been able to do.</p>
               <p>IN reſpect to the heights of this mountain,<note place="margin">HEIGHT.</note> and thoſe of <hi>Aran Benllyn,</hi> and the <hi>Arrenig Vawr,</hi> I am enabled to give a very exact account, by the aſſiſtance of the ingenious Mr. <hi>Meredith Hughes,</hi> of <hi>Bala;</hi> who aſſures me, that the <hi>Pen y Gader</hi> is nine hundred and fifty yards higher than the green near <hi>Dolgelleu; Aran Benllyn,</hi> ſeven hundred and forty above <hi>Llyn-tegid;</hi> and the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renig,</hi> only twenty yards ſhort of the <hi>Aran;</hi> that the fall from the lake to <hi>Dolgelleu-Green,</hi> is one hundred and eighty yards; ſo that the real difference of height between the <hi>Cader</hi> and the <hi>Aran,</hi> is only thirty yards.</p>
               <p>AFTER recovering the fatigue of this journey, I began another, in order to encircle the vaſt baſe of the mountain. I took the ſame road as I did before; and continued my ride beneath <hi>Tyrrau Mawr,</hi> one of the points of <hi>Cader Idris,</hi> the higheſt rock I ever rode under. Beyond, on the right, are the two pools called <hi>Llynian Cregenan;</hi> and not far diſtant, are ſome remains of circles of upright ſtones, with many carns; a vaſt ſtone, raiſed erect on the top of a neighboring rock; and ſeveral <hi>maeni hirion,</hi> or rude upright columns.</p>
               <p>AT ſome diſtance beyond theſe,<note place="margin">LLYS BRADWEN.</note> near the river <hi>Kregennan,</hi> I ſaw the remains of <hi>Llys Bradwen,</hi> the court or palace of <hi>Ednowain,</hi> chief of one of the fifteen tribes of <hi>North Wales,</hi> either in the
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0181900402:96"/>
reign of <hi>Gryffydd ap Cynan,</hi> or ſoon after. The reliques are about thirty yards ſquare: the entrance about ſeven feet wide, with a large upright ſtone on each ſide, by way of door-caſe: the walls with large ſtones, uncemented by any mortar: in ſhort, the ſtructure of this palace ſhews the very low ſtate of architecture in thoſe times: it may be paralleled only by the artleſs fabrick of a cattle houſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ednyfed ap Aaren,</hi> a deſcendant of this great man, had the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of entertaining <hi>Owen Glyndwr,</hi> in one of his ſad reverſes of fortune; and is ſaid to have concealed him from the purſuit of his enemies, in the pariſh of <hi>Llan Gelynln,</hi> in a cave, to this day called <hi>Ogof Owain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I MUST not lead the reader into a belief, that every habitation, of theſe early times, were equal in magnificence to that of <hi>Ednowain ap Bradwen.</hi> Thoſe of inferior gentry were formed of wattles, like <hi>Indian</hi> wigwams, or <hi>Highland</hi> hovels; without gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens or orchard, and formed for removal from place to place, for the ſake of new paſture, or a greater plenty of game. The fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture was correſpondent; there were neither tables, nor cloths, nor napkins<note n="*" place="bottom">Girald. Cambr. Dejer. Walliae, <hi>888.</hi>

When a ſtranger entered, his arms were taken from him, and layed by; and, after the ſcriptural cuſtom, water was brought to
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0181900402:97"/>
waſh his feet. The fare was ſimple; the meal did not conſiſt of an elegant variety, but of numbers of things put together in a large diſh: the bread was thin oat-cakes, ſuch as are common in our mountanous parts at this time. The family waited on the gueſts, and never touched any thing till they had done, when it took up with what was left. Muſic, and the free converſation of the young women, formed the amuſements of the time; for jealouſy was unknown among us. Bands of young men, who knew no profeſſion but that of arms, often entered the houſes, and were welcome gueſts; for they were conſidered as the volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary defenders of the liberties of their country. They mixed with the female part of the family, joined their voices to the melody of the harp, and conſumed the day with the moſt animated feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. At length, ſunk into repoſe, not under rich teſters, or on downy beds, but along the ſides of the room, on a thin covering of dried reeds, placed round the great fire, which was placed in the centre, they lay down promiſcuouſly, covered only by a coarſe home-made cloth, called <hi>Brychan,</hi> or plaid, the ſame with the more antient <hi>Bracha;</hi> and kept one another warm, by lying cloſe together; or ſhould one ſide loſe its genial heat, they turn about, and give the chilly ſide to the fire<note n="*" place="bottom">Giraldus, <hi>888.</hi>

The young people uſually begin the night with dancing, and when they are tired, ſit down,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:0181900402:98"/>
and aſſume this ſpecies of relaxation. Oftentimes, like the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern <hi>Improviſitore</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> they will ſing extempore verſes. A perſon converſant in this art, will produce a <hi>pennyll</hi> appoſite to the laſt which was ſung: the ſubjects produce a great deal of mirth; for they are ſometimes jocular, at others ſatyrical, and many amorous. They will continue ſinging without intermiſſion, and never repeat the ſame ſtanza; for that would occaſion the loſs of the honor of being held firſt of the ſong. Like nightin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales, they ſupport the conteſt throughout the night: <hi>Certant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſe, palamque animoſa contentio—victa morte finit ſaepe vitam, ſpiritu prius deficiente quam cantu,</hi> may almoſt be added. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience uſually call for the tune: ſometimes only a few can ſing to it; and in many caſes the whole company: but when a party of capital ſingers aſſemble, they rarely call for a tune; for it is indifferent to them, what tune the harper plays. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes often contend againſt pariſhes; and every hill is vocal with the chorus.</p>
               <p>CONTINUE the ride, as before, between high mountains, in a narrow glen. Quit the narrow paſs, and go along a good road, formed on the ſides of the hills, with a fine ſlope from it to the ſea, at this time ſtrangely mottled with black and green, varied by the light through the broken clouds. The road now paſſes between verdant and ſmooth hills, the great ſheep walks of the country; they are round at their tops, and covered with flocks, which yield the materials for the neighboring manufactures. From a place called <hi>Allt-Lwyd,</hi> have a very full view of the flat called <hi>Towyn Meirionydd,</hi> a mixture of meadow land and black turbery, watered by the <hi>Dyſynni,</hi> which falls into the ſea a few

               <p>FROM the place where I made this digreſſion, I deſcended a ſleep path through fields; and, croſſing the river, dined on a great ſtone beneath the vaſt rock <hi>Craig y Deryn,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CRAIG Y DERYN.</note> or <hi>The Rock of Birds,</hi> ſo called from the numbers of corvorants, rock pigeons, and hawks, which breed on it.

               <p>ABOUT five or ſix miles from <hi>Dolgelleu,</hi> at <hi>Dôol y Melynllyn,</hi> I turned out of the road, meeting the furious courſe of the <hi>Gamlan,</hi> that falls, with ſhort interruptions, from rock to rock, for a very conſiderable ſpace, amidſt the woods and buſhes, till it reaches a lofty precipice, from whence it precipitates into a black pool, ſhaded by trees (which gives to the cataract the name of <hi>Rhaia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der-ddu,</hi>

               <p>BEGIN a conſiderable aſcent, and find on the top ſome groves of handſome oaks: before me, a naked country. Deſcend, through ſome ſteep fields, to another ſet of wooded dingles, that wind along the bottoms, and join with the former. In various parts, <hi>Cader Idris</hi> appears in full majeſty over theſe ſloping foreſts, and gives a magnificent finiſhing to the proſpect. Soon after my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival among the woods, another caſcade aſtoniſhes me with its grandeur. From the ſituation I was in, it formed a vaſt fall, bounded on one ſide by broken ledges of rocks, on the other by a lofty precipice, with trees here and there growing out of its mural front. On the ſummit of each part, oaks and birch form diſtinct little groves, and give it a ſort of character diſtinct from our other cataracts. After the water reaches the bottom of the deep concavity, it ruſhes in a narrow rocky chaſm, of a very great depth, over which is an admirable wooden <hi>Alpine</hi> bridge; and the whole, for a conſiderable way, awefully canopied by trees. This is called <hi>Piſtill y Kain,</hi> or the ſpout of the river <hi>Kain.</hi> At no great diſtance from it, is another (for nature is here profuſe in her beauties of this kind).<note place="margin">PISTILL Y MAW.</note> The <hi>Maw,</hi> for ſome ſpace, runs along a deep glen, finiſhed by a bare mountain, ſeen through viſtos, formed by the woods on each ſide. The water tumbles down a ſeries of ledges, of different heights, into a very black and ſullen pool, from which it re-aſſumes its violence, and is loſt among the far extending woods.</p>
               <p>IN the nakedneſs of winter, there is a ſpot, far above, from whence theſe two cataracts may be ſeen at once, exhibiting through

Around its ſummit had been the wall, whoſe remains are viſible in ſeveral places; and in one is the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a round tower: the facings are very regular, but the work deſtitute of mortar.

                     <hi>July</hi> 18th, 1770.</note> to this place, <note place="margin">FASTING WOMAN.</note> my curioſity was excited to examine into the truth of a ſurprizing relation of a woman in the pariſh of <hi>Cylynin,</hi> who had faſted a moſt ſupernatural length of time. I took boat, had a moſt pleaſant paſſage up the harbour, charmed with the beauty of the ſhores, intermixed with woods, verdant paſtures, and corn fields. I landed, and, after a ſhort walk, found, in a farm called <hi>Tydden Bach,</hi> the object of my excurſion, <hi>Mary Thomas,</hi> who was boarded here, and kept with great humanity and neatneſs. She was of the age of forty-ſeven, of a good countenance, very pale, thin, but not ſo much emaciated as might be expected, from the ſtrangeneſs of the circumſtances I am going to relate; her eyes weak, her voice low, deprived of the uſe of her lower extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and quite bed-ridden; her pulſe rather ſtrong, her intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects clear and ſenſible.</p>
               <p>ON examining her, ſhe informed me, that at the age of ſeven, ſhe had ſome eruptions like the meaſles, which grew confluent and univerſal; and ſhe became ſo fore, that ſhe could not bear the left touch: ſhe received ſome eaſe by the appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of a ſheep's ſkin, juſt taken from the animal. After this, ſhe was ſeized, at ſpring and fall, with ſwellings and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations, during which time ſhe was confined to her bed; but in the intervals could walk about; and once went to <hi>Holywell,</hi> in hopes of cure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0181900402:112"/>WHEN ſhe was about twenty-ſeven years of age, ſhe was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked with the ſame complaint, but in a more violent man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; and during two years and a half, remained inſenſible, and took no manner of nouriſhment, notwithſtanding her friends forced open her mouth with a ſpoon, to get ſomething down; but the moment the ſpoon was taken away, her teeth met, and cloſed with vaſt ſnapping and violence: during that time, ſhe flung up vaſt quantities of blood.</p>
               <p>SHE well remembers the return of her ſenſes, and her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of every body about her. She thought ſhe had ſlept but a night, and aſked her mother whether ſhe had given her any thing the day before, for ſhe found herſelf very hungry. Meat was brought to her; but ſo far from being able to take any thing ſolid, ſhe could ſcarcely ſwallow a ſpoonful of thin whey. From this, ſhe continued ſeven years and a half without any food or liquid, excepting ſufficient of the latter to moiſten her lips. At the end of this period, ſhe again fancied herſelf hungry, and deſired an egg; of which ſhe got down the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of a nut kernel. About this time, ſhe requeſted to receive the ſacrament; which ſhe did, by having a crum of bread ſteeped in the wine. After this, ſhe takes for her daily ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence a bit of bread, weighing about two penny-weights ſeven grains, and drinks a wine glaſs of water: ſometimes a ſpoonful of wine, but frequently abſtains whole days from food and liquids. She ſleeps very indifferently: the ordinary func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of nature are very ſmall, and very ſeldom performed. Her attendant told me, that her diſpoſition of mind was mild; her temper even; that ſhe was very religious, and very ſervent
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0181900402:113"/>
in prayer: the natural effect of the ſtate of her body, long un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embarraſſed with the groſſneſs of food, and a conſtant aliena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thought from all worldly affairs<note n="*" place="bottom">She was living in 1780, and in the ſame ſtate.</note>.</p>
               <p>THIS inſtance of the influence of diſeaſe (for ſuch only can it be called) ſtrange as it is, is not without parallel.</p>
               <p>THE firſt is the caſe of a lady, a patient of the late doctor <hi>Gower,</hi> of <hi>Chelmsford,</hi> who was confined to her bed for ten years, during which time ſhe had an extreme and conſtant averſion to all kinds of ſolid nouriſhment. She drank a pint of tea daily; and once in three or four days chewed, without ſwallowing, a few raiſins of the ſun and blanched almonds, about four or half a dozen of each: ſhe ſeldom eat oftener than once a month, and then only a bit of dry bread, of the ſize of a nutmeg; but frequently abſtained from food for many weeks together. This lady recovered, by means of conſtant medical regimen; ſo that ſhe could walk two miles, without taking ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reſt or refreſhment.</p>

He was a deep ſtudent in the <hi>black art;</hi> and <hi>Lilly</hi> aſſures us, that he had moſt <hi>piercing judgement naturally upon a figure of theft,</hi> and many other queſtions, he ever met withal; was well verſed in the <hi>nature of ſpirits;</hi> and had many times uſed the <hi>circular way of invocating.</hi> He then tells how his friend <hi>Evans,</hi> by means of the angel <hi>Salmon,</hi> brought to him a deed, which one of his cuſtomers had been wronged of, at the ſame time blowing down part of the houſe of the perſon in whoſe cuſtody it was: and again, how, to ſatisfy the curioſity of lord <hi>Bothwel</hi> and Sir <hi>Kenelm Digby,</hi> who wanted to ſee a ſpirit, he liked to have loſt his life, being carried over the <hi>Thames,</hi> and flung down near <hi>Batterſea,</hi> by the ſpirits, whom he had vexed at the time of invocation, for want of <hi>making</hi>

               <p>ON my return to <hi>Barmouth,</hi> I proceeded for ſome time along the coaſt, among ſhifting ſands. Paſs near <hi>Kail Wart,</hi> by a ſtone, now ſerving as a foot bridge, on which was this inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <hi>Hic jacet</hi> CALIXTUS <hi>Monedo Regi.</hi> There is no tradition of the place it was removed from.</p>

                  <note place="margin">CORS-Y-GEDOL.</note> the antient ſeat of the <hi>Vaughans,</hi> where I was entertained by <hi>William Vaughan,</hi> eſquire, for ſome days, in the ſtyle of an antient baron. The woods near his houſe are extenſive, but affected by the weſt winds in a very ſurprizing manner: the tops are ſhorn quite even, and the boughs ſo interwoven, as to form ſeemingly a cloſe and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt impenetrable ſurface.</p>
               <p>THERE are few places which abound more in <hi>Britiſh</hi> anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities, than the environs of <hi>Cors-y-Gedol.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CRAIG Y DINAS.</note> I firſt viſited <hi>Craig y Dinas,</hi> the ſummit of a hill, ſurrounded with a vaſt heap of ſtones, the ruins of a wall, which, in many parts, retain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and even facing: this, and ſome others ſimilar, are the firſt deviations from the rude ramparts of ſtone, and prior to the improvement of maſonry by the uſe of mortar. Into this
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0181900402:116"/>
is an oblique entrance, with ſtone facings on both ſides; and near it are two ramparts of ſtones. The whole is on the ſteep extremity of the hill, near to which is a paſs into the country.</p>
               <p>ABOUT a mile farther,<note place="margin">LLYN BODLYN.</note> is <hi>Llyn Bodlyn,</hi> a ſmall lake, beneath a lofty precipice, well ſtocked with char, which will take a bair, and afford good diverſion to the angler. <hi>Llyn Cwm Howel</hi> is another lake in this neighborhood, noted for a race of trouts (which I have ſeen) with moſt deformed heads, thick, flatted, and toad ſhaped; and which, probably, might give riſe to the fabled accounts of the monſtrous ſpecies recorded by <hi>Giraldus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER paſſing by <hi>Llyn-Irddin,</hi> a ſmall piece of water, on a plain, arrive amidſt a wondrous group of <hi>Druidical</hi> antiquities. On the flat appear two circles.<note place="margin">CIRCLES OF STONES.</note> The firſt is about fifty-ſix feet in diameter, formed of piles of looſe ſtones, with upright co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumns, placed at five yards diſtance from each other, in pairs, ſo as nearly to divide the circle into four parts. About thirty yards from this, is a leſſer, with ſeveral upright ſtones among the ſmaller, but placed with leſs regularity. Deſign, not chance, certainly directed the founders of theſe circles in the diſpoſition of the columnar ſtones; but I fear, when I come to ſpeak more fully of them, the cauſe muſt remain unaccounted for, by reaſon of the remoteneſs of the time, and the myſtery of the antient prieſthood.</p>
               <p>HALF a mile fouth of theſe, on the ſide of a hill, are two car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedds, of a moſt ſtupendous ſize, containing an uncommon aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblage of druidical cuſtoms,<note place="margin">CARNEDDEU HENGWM.</note> or religion, in form of <hi>Cromleh, Maen Hir,</hi> and <hi>Kiſt Vaen.</hi> Both are of an oblong form, and
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0181900402:117"/>
compoſed of looſe ſtones: the largeſt is fifty-five feet, long, and twelve high, in the middle. At the eaſt end is a great <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leh</hi> altar, compoſed of two ſloping ſtones, one placed over the edge of the other, upon five flat upright ſtones, ſeven feet high in one part, and four feet ten in the loweſt. About eight yards from this, is the upper ſtone of a <hi>Cromleh,</hi> lying flat on the carnedd, without the appearance of any other ſupport.</p>
               <p>ELEVEN yards farther, is another great heap of ſtones, and in it a large <hi>Cromleh,</hi> ſupported with upright ſtones. It is now converted into a retreat for a ſhepherd, who has placed ſtone ſeats within, and formed a chimney through the looſe ſtones above. In the ſame carnedd, a little farther on, is another magnificent <hi>Cromleh,</hi> whoſe incumbent ſtone is twelve feet by nine; four vaſt columns, or <hi>maen hirion,</hi> three now fallen, and a third erect. The columns are from the height of ten feet four, to that of twelve feet eight; and each between four and five feet broad.</p>
               <p>NORTH-WEST of theſe antiquities,<note place="margin">CASTELL DINAS CORTIN.</note> on the top of a hill, is a ſtrong poſt, called <hi>Caſtell Dinas Cortin,</hi> entrenched around, with an advanced work on one ſide. This, and <hi>Caſtell Craig y Dinas,</hi> were doubtleſsly formed as defences to the ſacred ground, the ſubject of the above deſcription. I may add like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wife another object of protection, of the ſame nature, which I met with on my return to <hi>Corſegedol,</hi> two great <hi>Carnedds,</hi> placed on ſmall eminences, near to each other; and within one, the five ſquare flags of a <hi>Kiſt vaen,</hi> the top being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.

               </p>
               <p>THIS neighborhood alſo abounds with <hi>Cromlechs</hi> of very great ſize.<note place="margin">CROMLECHS.</note> I meaſured one, in a tenement called <hi>Bryn-y-Voel,</hi> which was ſixteen feet four inches long, ſeven feet four broad, and twenty inches thick. It lay about two feet above the ground, ſupported by ſmall ſtones, and was ſurrounded with a circle of looſe ſtones. Moſt of the <hi>Cromlechs</hi> of theſe parts lie very near to the ground, and in that reſpect differ from thoſe of other places. They lie likewife horizontally, which ſhews that their object was different, whatſoever it was.</p>
               <p>THIS country is in the hundred of <hi>Ardudwy.</hi> The entrance into it from <hi>Trawsfynnydd</hi> is called <hi>Drws Ardudwy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">DEWS ARDUDWY.</note> or the door of <hi>Ardudwy,</hi> formed by nature through the ſterile mountains, which ſeparate the places. I was tempted to viſit this noted paſs, and found the horror of it far exceeding the moſt gloomy idea that could be conceived of it. The ſides ſeemed to have been rent by ſome mighty convulſion into a thouſand precipices, forming at their tops rows of ſhelves, which the peaſants, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to the ranges in a dove cot, ſtyle <hi>Carreg y Klommenod,</hi> or the rock of the pigeons. The bottom of this paſſage is covered
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0181900402:119"/>
with a deluge of ſtones, which have ſtreamed from the ſides; and along it is a narrow horſe-path, on the ſlippery rock, formed by the removal of a few of the fragments, which, in other places, are diſpoſed into form of moſt ſteep and hazardous flights of ſteps: and yet, as if the natural and artificial difficulties of theſe ways were not ſufficient to terrify invaders, there are, in one place, the veſtiges of a wall, which went acroſs the paſs, in which might have been the door which gave name to it.</p>
               <p>ON my return, I viſited an ordinary houſe, called <hi>Maes y Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedd,</hi> the birth place of the regicide colonel <hi>Jones;</hi> whoſe inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the neighboring gentry is ſtill ſpoken of, even to this day, with much warmth. Actuated by enthuſiaſm, he went every length that the congenial <hi>Cromwell</hi> dictated; and was a brave and ſucceſsful officer in a cauſe, which, after a certain pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, was the reſult of ambition, and the foundation of tyranny.</p>
               <p>FROM ſome of the adjacent heights of this ride, I had a full view beneath me (it being low water) of the long range of ſand and gravel, which runs from this coaſt twenty-two miles into the ſea. It is deſervedly called <hi>Sarn Badrig,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">SARN BADRIG.</note> or, more properly, <hi>Bad-rhwyg,</hi> or <hi>Ship breaking Cauſeway,</hi> from the number of ſhips loſt upon it. This ſhoal is dry at the ebb of ſpring-tides, and marked in ſtorms by horrible breakers. Tradition ſays, that all this part of the ſea had been a habitable hundred, called <hi>Cantréer Gwaelod,</hi> or <hi>The Lowland Hundred;</hi> and that it was overwhelmed by the ſea, about the year 500, in the time of <hi>Gwyddno Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronhir.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A SIMILAR accident happened, in ſome diſtant period, on the coaſt of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> The canons of <hi>St. Paul</hi> muſt be poſſeſſed of a

               <p>FROM <hi>Corſegedol,</hi> I purſued my journey towards <hi>Harlech;</hi> but, on the road, was tempted, by my conſtant fellow-traveller, the reverend Mr. <hi>John Lloyd,</hi> to make a ſmall deviation to the right, to viſit a near relation of his, who lived a few miles to our right, in his antient territories of <hi>Cwm Bychan.</hi> We approached it through <hi>Glyn Artro,</hi> a little valley, watered by a river of the ſame name, and prettily wooded. The view upwards was extremely pictu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſque, of a conic rock, ſkirted by a ſweet grove; and beyond ſoared the naked mountains, which bounded the object of our ride.</p>
               <p>AFTER paſſing through the wood, and aſcending <hi>Dinas Porch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellyn,</hi> had before us a wild horizon of rocks and rocky moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. Even theſe tracts, unfriendly as they ſeem to vegetation, had once been covered with venerable oaks; and there ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained a few, between eight and nine feet in circumference. We went under their ſhade, above a rapid torrent, with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful view before us of a true <hi>Alpine</hi> wooden bridge, and a ſmall mill; and, a little farther, an antient arch, flung from rock to rock, giving paſſage over a ſtill and black water, ſhaded by trees. Ford the river again near <hi>Llyn Sarph,</hi> or <hi>The Serpent's Hole.</hi> Wind up a rocky ſtair-caſe road, and arrive full in ſight of <hi>Cwm Bychan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CWM BYCHAN.</note> emboſomed with rocks of magnificent height. After a ſhort ride, high above a lake of the ſame name, deſcend, and reach the houſe of the venerable <hi>Evan Llwyd,</hi> who, with his anceſtors, boaſt. of being lords of theſe rocks, at left ſince the

He likewiſe ſhewed us the antient family cup, made of a bull's ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, in which large libations had been made in days of yore. The family lay in their whole ſtore of winter proviſions, being inacceſſible a great part of the ſeaſon, by reaſon of ſnow.

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0181900402:122"/>OF this houſe was the valiant <hi>Dai Llwyd,</hi> to whom is ſaid to have been addreſſed the noted <hi>Welſh</hi> tune, <hi>Ffarwel</hi> DAI Llwyd, on occaſion of his going with <hi>Jaſper Tudor</hi> and <hi>Owen Lawgoch,</hi> to fight <hi>Riſiart Frawdwr,</hi> or <hi>Richard the Traitor,</hi> by which name the <hi>Welſh</hi> ſtigmatized <hi>Richard</hi> the Third.</p>
               <p>THE manſion is a true ſpecimen of an antient ſeat of a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of <hi>Wales.</hi> The furniture rude: the moſt remarkable were the <hi>Ciſtie Styffylog,</hi> or the great oatmeal cheſts, which held the eſſential part of the proviſion.</p>
               <p>THE territories dependent on the manſion, extend about four miles each way, and conſiſt of a ſmall tract of meadow, a pretty lake ſwarming with trout, a little wood, and very much rock; but the whole forms a moſt auguſt ſcenery. The naked moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains envelope his vale and lake, like an immenſe theatre. The meadows are divided by a ſmall ſtream, and are bounded on one ſide by the lake; on the other, by his woods, which ſkirt the foot of the rocks, and through which the river runs, and beyond them tumbles from the heights, in a ſeries of cataracts. He keeps his whole territory in his own hands; but diſtributes his hinds among the <hi>Havadwys,</hi> or ſummer dairy-houſes, for the conveniency of attending his herds and flocks: he has fixed his heir on another part of his eſtates. His ambition once led him to attempt draining his lake, in order to extend his landed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; but, alas! he gained only a few acres of ruſhes and reeds; ſo wiſely bounded his deſires, and ſaved a beautiful piece of water. He found on one ſide a ſtratum of fine white earth, about half a yard thick, which I knew was what mineralogiſts dignify with the name of <hi>Lac Lunae,</hi> and <hi>Agaricus Mineralis.</hi>

               <p>STOOLS and roots of firs, of vaſt ſize, are frequently found near the lake. Mr. <hi>Llwyd</hi> found one, with the marks of fire on it, which he uſed to repair the <hi>Tyddyn y Traian,</hi> or jointure-houſe of his family; an ancient cuſtomary appendage to moſt of the <hi>Welſh</hi> houſes of any note.</p>
               <p>AMONG the mountains which guard the <hi>Cwm,</hi> is one named <hi>Carreg y Saeth,</hi> on whoſe verge is a great <hi>Maen Hîr,</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nedd. Saeth</hi> ſignifies an arrow; ſo probably the antient ſportſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men here took their ſtand, to watch the paſſing of the deer, which formerly abounded in theſe parts. Nor have they long been extinct; a perſon of the laſt generation informed my hoſt, that he had ſeen eighteen at once, grazing in the meadow.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Welſh</hi> had ſeveral animals,<note place="margin">ANTIENT HUNTING.</note> which were the objects of the chace; ſuch as, <hi>y Carw,</hi> or the ſtag; <hi>Kaid Wenyn,</hi> a ſwarm of bees; and <hi>y Gleiſiad,</hi> or the ſalmon. <hi>Yr Arth,</hi> the bear; <hi>y Dringhedydd,</hi> climbing animals, I ſuppoſe wild cats, martins, and ſquirrels; and <hi>Ceiliog Coed,</hi> or cock of the wood. And the laſt diviſion was, <hi>y Llwynog,</hi> the fox; <hi>Yſgyfarnog,</hi> the hare; and <hi>yr Ywrch,</hi> the roe. Some of the above come very improperly under our idea of hunting, yet were comprehended in the code of laws relative to the diverſion, formed, as is ſuppoſed, by <hi>Gryffyd ap Cynan</hi>

               <p>THE three firſt were <hi>Helfa Gyffredyn,</hi> or the common hunt. The ſtag, becauſe he was the nobleſt animal of chace; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe every body, who came by at his death, before he was ſkinned, might clame a ſhare in him. The next animals were, <hi>Helfa Gyfarthfa,</hi> or the animals which could be brought to bay, ſuch as the bear, &amp;c. which were hunted with hounds till they aſcended a tree. The bird mentioned here, is the cock of the wood, whoſe nature it is to ſit perched on a bough, where they will gaze till they are ſhot, as they were, in old times, by the bow, or croſs-bow.</p>
               <p>THE third diviſion was <hi>Helfa Ddolef,</hi> or the ſhouting chace, becauſe attended by the clamor of the ſportſmen; and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the fox, the hare, and the roe. The method of hunting was either with hounds, or grehounds, which they let ſlip at the animals, holding the dogs in leaſhes. No one was to ſlip his grehound when the hounds were in chace, unleſs he had a hound in the pack, on penalty of having the grehound ham-ſtrung: neither was it allowed to kill any animal of chace on its form, or at reſt, on pain of forfeiting his bow and arrow to the lord of the manor. When ſeveral grehounds, the property of different perſons, were ſlipt at any animal, the perſon whoſe dog was neareſt the beaſt, when laſt in ſight, clamed the ſkin. A bitch was excepted, unleſs it was proved ſhe was pregnant by a dog which had before won a ſkin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="119" facs="tcp:0181900402:125"/>EVERY perſon who carries a horn, muſt give a ſcientifical ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the nine objects of chace, or elſe he will be looked on as a pretender, and forfeit his horn. The ſame penalty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the <hi>Cynllafan,</hi> or leaſh; he is never again to wear it round his middle, on pain of forfeiture; but then he is ſuffered to wear it round his arm.</p>
               <p>THE antient <hi>Welſh</hi> held the fleſh of the ſtag, hare, wild boar, and the bear, to be the greateſt delicacies among the beaſts of chace.</p>
               <p>THE prince had his <hi>Pencynwydd,</hi> or chief huntſman. He was the tenth officer of the court. He had for his own ſupper one diſh of meat; and after it, three horns of mead, one from the king, another from the queen, the third from the ſteward of the houſhold. He was never to ſwear, but by his horn and his leaſh.

At a certain time of the year, he was to hunt for the king only: at other ſeaſons, he was permitted to hunt for himſelf. His horn was that of an ox, of a pound value.

We preferred another way out of this ſingular place, and wound up a narrow path at the fartheſt end, on part of <hi>Molwyn y Hydd,</hi> in order to deſcend through <hi>Cwm Croeſor;</hi> being then deſirous of getting by the neareſt road to <hi>Pont Aber Glâs Llyn.</hi> But in our deſcent we met with ſuch narrowneſs of path, ſuch ſhort turnings, and horrible precipices, that our poor beaſts, with much reaſon, trembled in every limb; and, in fact, had a wonderful eſcape in getting ſafe to the bottom. The traveller who chuſes to follow our ſteps, will find a narrow graſſy bottom in <hi>Cwm Croeſor,</hi> with a few tenements: he will paſs through a
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0181900402:137"/>
pretty wood, and ſoon after find himſelf on the high road from <hi>Tan y Bwlch</hi> to <hi>Caernarvon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>IN this journey, I went from <hi>Feſtiniog</hi> on a leſs hazardous way. Not two miles from thence, on the road from <hi>Trawsfyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nydd</hi> to <hi>Yſpytty,</hi> I fell again into <hi>Fford Helen,</hi> which is here quite bare, and exhibits the rude ſtones with which it was made.</p>
               <p>NEAR it,<note place="margin">BEDDAU GWYR ARDUDWY.</note> at <hi>Rhyd yr Halen,</hi> on the right, are the remains of <hi>Beddau Gwyr Ardudwy,</hi> or the graves of the men of <hi>Ardudwy.</hi> Theſe graves were about ſix feet long, marked at each end by two upright ſtones; but moſt of the ſtones are now removed. There are yet to be ſeen ſeveral circles of ſtones, the largeſt about fifty-two feet in diameter; a vaſt carnedd, with two up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right ſtones placed on one part, as if to mark the entrance to the cell, which it probably incloſes; and near it a leſſer heap, and a ſmall circle; all of which had been ſurrounded with a larger circle, now incomplete by the application of the materials to the making of walls. The tradition relating to theſe monuments, is claſſical; nearly parallel with the rape of the <hi>Sabines.</hi> The men of <hi>Ardudwy,</hi> to populate their country, made an inroad into the vale of <hi>Clwyd,</hi> and layed violent hands on the fair ladies of the land: they carried them in ſafety to this place, where they were overtaken by the warriors of the vale: a fierce battle enſued, and the men of <hi>Ardudwy</hi> all ſlain; but the raviſhers had ſome how or other ſo gained the hearts of their fair prey, that, on their defeat, the ladies, rather than return home, ruſhed into an adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent water, called, from the event, <hi>Llyn y Morwynion,</hi> or <hi>The Maiden's Lake,</hi> and there periſhed. That this had been the
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0181900402:138"/>
ſcene of a bloody conflict, there is a probability: the graves and carnedds prove it; and the circles evince, that it was in the time when the ceremonies of druidiſm exiſted.</p>
               <p>FROM hence I deſcended the long and tedious ſteep of <hi>Bwlch Carreg y Frân,</hi> into the narrow vale of <hi>Penmachno;</hi> and, after aſcending another hill, turn to the right into the black and moory mountains, to viſit <hi>Llyn Conwy,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">LLYN CONWY.</note> the ſource of the noted river of that name. It is a very large piece of water, moſt diſmally ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated among rock and bog, and the ſides very irregularly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented. It is placed the higheſt of any large piece of water I have met with in theſe parts. In it are three iſlands, one of which is the haunt of the black-back Gulls, during the breeding ſeaſon. They are ſo exceedingly fierce in the defence of their young, that I knew of a man who was nearly drowned, in an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ſwim to their neſts, being ſo violently beaten by the old birds, that he thought he eſcaped well, with the dreadful bruiſes he received on all the upper part of his body. The water iſſues out of the end of the lake, in form of a little rill; but in the courſe of a few miles, before it reaches <hi>Llanrwſt,</hi> becomes a moſt: conſiderable river, by the addition of the various mountain ſtreams.</p>
               <p>DESCEND for two or three miles, and reach the village of <hi>Yſpytty Jevan,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">YSPYTTY.</note> or the hoſpital of <hi>St. John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> ſo ſtyled from its having formed, in the then inhoſpitable country, an aſylum and guard for travellers, under the protection of the knights who held the manor, and made its precincts a ſanctuary. After the abolition of the order, this privelege became the bane of the neighborhood; for the place, thus exempted from
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:0181900402:139"/>
all juriſdiction, was converted into a den of thieves and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, who ravaged the country far and wide with impunity, till the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VII. when they were extirpated by the bravery and prudence of <hi>Meredydd ap Evan.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>AFTER a very long interval, another charity ſucceeded, in the alms-houſes for ſix poor men, founded in 1600, by captain <hi>Richard Vaughan,</hi> a poor knight of <hi>Windſor,</hi> and deſcended from the neighboring houſe of <hi>Pant Glâs.</hi>

The rocks which bound it are of a vaſt height, and approach very near to each other, and want the pleaſing <hi>accompaniment</hi> of trees, attendant on moſt of our caſcades. One fall is of very great height; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath that, full in view, is a ſucceſſion of four leſſer.

               <p>THIS bridge was built on the following occaſion: One <hi>Howel,</hi> a maſon from <hi>Penllyn,</hi> having occaſion, about the year 1468, to attend the <hi>Merionethſhire</hi> aſſizes, then held at <hi>Conway,</hi> had his paſſage over the <hi>Lleder</hi> obſtructed by floods. This determined him to remove to the ſpot, where he built a bridge, at his own expence, and received no other gratuity than what reſulted from the ſpontaneous generoſity of paſſengers. He afterwards moved to the <hi>Llugwy,</hi> and began that of <hi>Pont y Pair,</hi> but died before he completed his work<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>I SOON left the bridge, and, after a ſteep aſcent, arrive at <hi>Dolwyddelan</hi> caſtle,<note place="margin">DOLWYDDELAN CASTLE,</note> ſeated in a rocky valley, ſprinkled over with ſtunted trees, and watered by the <hi>Lleder.</hi> The boundaries are rude and barren mountains; and, among others, the great bending mountain <hi>Scabod,</hi> often conſpicuous from moſt diſtant places.</p>
               <p>The caſtle is placed on a high rock, precipitous on one ſide, and inſulated: it conſiſts of two ſquare towers; one forty feet by twenty-five; the other thirty-one by twenty. Each had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly

three floors. The materials of this fortreſs are the ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery ſtone of the country; yet well ſquared, the maſonry good, and the mortar hard. The caſtle-yard lay between the towers.</p>
               <p>THIS had been founded by ſome of our princes; but we are ignorant of its origin. There were very few caſtles in <hi>North Wales,</hi> before its conqueſt by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> They were needleſs; for Nature created in our rocks and mountains, fortifications (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till our fatal diviſions) quite impregnable.

               <p>SIR <hi>John</hi> was ſent to <hi>London</hi> in 1574, to ſtudy the law; was a man of abilities, and particularly attentive to the antiquities of his country and family.

               <p>THIS place continued in the family till the year 1678, when it paſſed into that of the late duke of <hi>Ancaſter,</hi> by marriage of <hi>Mary,</hi> daughter and heireſs of Sir <hi>Richard Wynne,</hi> with <hi>Robert</hi> marqueſs of <hi>Lindſey;</hi> and is now poſſeſſed by <hi>Peter Burrell,</hi>

The bottom is meadowy; at this time enlivened with the buſy work of hay harveſt, and filled with drags, horſes, and even men and women, loaden with hay. The middle is varied with two ſmall lakes, along whoſe ſides we rode; and at ſome diſtance beyond them, near <hi>Pont y Gwryd,</hi> quitted our horſes, to viſit the ſummit of the <hi>Glyder,</hi> noted for the report the editor of <hi>Cambden</hi> had made, of the ſingular diſpoſition of the rocks. We directed our ſervants to go on to <hi>Llanberis,</hi> with our ſteeds. The aſcent was extremely long, ſteep, and laborious, wet and ſlippery; and almoſt the whole way covered with looſe fragments of rocks, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath which was a continual roar of waters, ſeeking their way to the bottom.</p>
               <p>OUR pains were fully repaid, on attaining the ſummit.<note place="margin">GLYDER BACH.</note> The area was covered with groupes of columnar ſtones, of vaſt ſize, from ten to thirty feet long, lying in all directions: moſt of them were of a columnar form, often piled on one another: in other places, half erect, ſloping down, and ſupported by others, which lie without any order at their baſes. The tops are frequently crowned in the ſtrangeſt manner with other ſtones, lying on them horizontally. One was about twenty-five feet long, and ſix broad: I climbed up, and, on ſtamping it with my foot, felt a ſtrong tremulous motion from end to end. Another, eleven feet long, and ſix in circumference in the thinneſt part, was poiſed ſo nicely on the point of a rock, that, to appearance, the touch of
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0181900402:164"/>
a child would overſet it. A third enormous maſs had the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of a rocking ſtone.</p>
               <p>MANY of the ſtones had, bedded in them, ſhells; and in their neighborhood I found ſeveral pieces of lava. I would therefore rather conſider this mountain to have been a ſort of wreck of nature, formed and flung up by ſome mighty internal convulſion, which has given theſe vaſt groupes of ſtones fortuitouſly ſuch a ſtrange diſpoſition; for had they been the ſettled ſtrata, bared of their earth by a long ſeries of rains, they would have retained the regular appearance, as we obſerve in all other beds of ſimilar matter.</p>
               <p>ONE ſide of this mountain is formed into a gap, <hi>beriſſce,</hi> I may call it, with ſharp rocks, pointing upwards, one above the other, to a great height. In the midſt of a vale far below, riſes the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular mountain <hi>Trevaen,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">TREVAEN.</note> aſſuming on this ſide a pyramidal form, naked, and very rugged. A precipice, from whoſe ſummit I ſurveyed the ſtrange ſcene, forbad my approach to examine the nature of its compoſition; and whether it might not have been ſuſpected of being formed at the ſame time with the phoenomena on the top of its neighbor <hi>Glyder:</hi> for I have heard that inſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated mountains of this form often appear at the baſe of greater, which have been ſuppoſed to owe their origin to volcanic force.</p>
               <p>FROM <hi>Glyder Bach</hi> I paſſed over a plain, above half a mile broad, called <hi>Y Waun Oer, The Chilly Mountainous Flat.</hi> Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve from the edge, in a tremendous hollow, <hi>Llyn y Boch Llwyd,</hi> or <hi>The Lake of the Grey Goat;</hi> and in the bottom of the valley,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0181900402:165"/>
near the foot of the <hi>Trevaen, Llyn Ogwen,</hi> noted for its fine trout.</p>
               <p>FROM <hi>Waen Oer</hi> we made a moſt hazardous deſcent to <hi>Cwm Bochllwyd,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Llyn Ogwen.</hi> The way from that place into the valley, or rather chaſm, of <hi>Nant Frankon,</hi> is called <hi>The Ben-glog,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">BEN-GLOG.</note> the most dreadful horſe path in <hi>Wales,</hi> worked in the rudeſt manner into ſteps, for a great length. On one ſide, in a deep hollow, formed under fallen rocks, was once the hiding place of <hi>Rys Goch o'r Eryri,</hi> or <hi>Rhys the Red,</hi> of <hi>Snowdon;</hi> a mountain bard, patroniſed by <hi>Robert Meredydd,</hi> a partizan of <hi>Glyndwr,</hi> an outlawed chieftain, of whoſe fortunes he partook.I do aſſure the traveller, who delights in wild na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that a viſit to it up <hi>Nant Frankon,</hi> from <hi>Bangor,</hi> will not be repented. The waters of five lakes dart down the precipice of the middle of the <hi>Benglog,</hi> and form the torrent of the <hi>Ogwen,</hi> which falls into the ſea a few miles lower. This bottom is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with mountains of a ſtupendous height, moſtly preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitous; the tops of many edged with pointed rocks, I have, from the depth beneath, ſeen the ſhepherds ſkipping from peak to peak; but the point of contact was ſo ſmall, that from this diſtance they ſeemed to my uplifted eyes like beings of another order, floating in the air.</p>
               <p>THE <hi>Trevaen,</hi> from this bottom, makes alſo a very ſingular ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, reſembling a human face, reclined backward. Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, noſe, lips, and chin, are very apparent; and you may add, without any great ſtrain of fancy, the beard of an antient inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitant, an arch-druid.</p>

are weather-beaten, time-eaten, and honey-combed, and of a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable grey color. The elements ſeemed to have warred againſt this mountain: rains have waſhed, lightnings torn, the very earth deſerted it, and the winds made it the conſtant object of their fury.

                  <hi>Snowdon, Cefn Cwm Gafr,</hi> the two <hi>Glyders,</hi> and two <hi>Lliders,</hi> each of them firſt-rate mountains. It is ſtrait, and of nearly an equal breadth, filled by ſome meadows, and two magnificent lakes, which communicate to each other by means of a river. The venerable oaks, ſpoken of by <hi>Leland,</hi> are no more. Ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice, or diſſipation, and its conſtant follower, poverty, have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoiled much of our principality of its leafy beauties. Among the numberleſs errors of this performance, I fear the word is cloathed with trees, muſt be ſupplied by the traveller with WAS. But this ſhadeleſs tract is ſtill worthy his attention. A road, once a ſucceſſion of rude and ſtony ſtairs, made with much la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, ran on one ſide, high above the lake, and was often cut out of the rock, to form the way. This is, I am now informed, changed into a road, which too much facilitates the approach, and leſſens its propriety, and its agreement with the wild en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons.</p>
               <p>ON the loftieſt part,<note place="margin">CASTELL DOLBA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DERN.</note> over one of the lakes, ſtand the remains of <hi>Caſtell Dolbadern,</hi> conſiſting of a round tower, and a few frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of walls. It was conſtructed with the thin laminated ſtones of the country, cemented with very ſtrong mortar, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſhells. The inner diameter of the tower is only twenty-ſix feet. This ſeems to have been built to defend the paſs into the interior parts of <hi>Snowdonia;</hi> and it was likewiſe uſed as a ſtate priſon. The founder is unknown to me; but it was evidently a <hi>Welſh</hi> prince.</p>
               <p>IN this valley are two groupes of wretched houſes. The fartheſt is near the end of the upper lake, with its church, dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>St. Peris,</hi> who was, as we are told, a cardinal. Here
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0181900402:171"/>
is to be ſeen the well of the ſaint, incloſed with a wall. The ſybil of the place attends, and divines your fortune by the appearance or non-appearance of a little fiſh, which lurks in ſome of its holes.</p>
               <p>FROM hence I took a ride above the lakes, to their lower ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. The upper is the leſſer, but much the moſt beautiful piece of water. It is ſaid to be in places a hundred and forty yards deep; to have abounded with char, before they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the ſtreams flowing from the copper mines, which had been worked on the ſides of the hills. The lower lake is about a mile and a half long, narrows gradually into the form of a river, called the <hi>Rythell,</hi> and flows in a diffuſed channel to <hi>Caer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narvon,</hi> where it aſſumes the name of <hi>Seiont.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>NEAR this end of the lake lived a celebrated perſonage,<note place="margin">MARGARET UCH EVAN.</note> whom I was diſappointed in not finding at home. This was <hi>Margaret uch Evan,</hi> of <hi>Penllyn,</hi> the laſt ſpecimen of the ſtrength and ſpirit of the antient <hi>Britiſh</hi> fair. This extraordinary female was the greateſt hunter, ſhooter, and fiſher of her time. She kept a dozen at leſt of dogs, terriers, grehounds, and ſpaniels, all excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in their kinds. She killed more foxes in one year, than all the confederate hunts do in ten: rowed ſtoutly, and was queen of the lake: fiddled excellently, and knew all our old muſic: did not neglect the mechanic arts, for ſhe was a very good joiner: and notwithſtanding ſhe was ſeventy years of age, was the beſt wreſtler in the country, and few young men dared to try a fall with her. Some years ago, ſhe had a maid of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial qualities; but death, that mighty hunter, at laſt earthed this faithful companion of her's. I muſt not forget, that all the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0181900402:172"/>
neighboring bards payed their addreſſes to <hi>Margaret,</hi> and cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated her exploits in pure <hi>Britiſh</hi> verſe.</p>
               <p>ABOUT half a mile farther, I viſited the remains of <hi>Llŷs Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norwig,</hi> a houſe ſaid to have been one of the palaces of prince <hi>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd:</hi> the walls high and ſtrong; the hall twenty-four yards long; and before the houſe is a deep ditch, over which had probably been a draw-bridge. Not very far from hence is a ſpot, called <hi>Rhiw'r Cyrn,</hi> or <hi>The Brow of the Horns;</hi> where, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to old uſage, an officer ſtood and blew his horn, to give notice to the houſhold of the approach of their maſter, or to ſummon the vaſſals to aſſemble on all emergent occaſions.</p>

               <p>RETURN by the ſame road, and, after refreſhing myſelf with a night's reſt at Mr. <hi>Cloſe</hi>'s, agent to the mines in <hi>Llanberris,</hi> early in the morning begin our aſcent to the higheſt peak, of <hi>Snowdon,</hi> under the guidance of <hi>Hugh Shone,</hi> whom I beg leave to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend as a moſt able conductor. Keep upon the ſide of the lake for a conſiderable way; then turn to the left, and ſee, not far from the road, <hi>Caunant Mawr,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CAUNANT MAWR.</note> a noble cataract, precipitating over two vaſt rocks into two moſt horrible chaſms. Near this place were found ſeveral beads; ſome of glaſs, and one of jet.</p>
               <p>ASCEND, above <hi>Cwm Brwynog,</hi> a very deep bottom, fertile in <hi>Gwair y Rhoſydd,</hi> which is compoſed chiefly of different kinds of ruſhes, particularly <hi>Juncus Squarroſus,</hi> the moſs-ruſh, <hi>Scirpus Caſpitoſus,</hi> the heath club ruſh, <hi>Schaenus Nigricans,</hi> the black bog ruſh, and <hi>Carexes,</hi> intermixed with few kinds of graſs. The hay which the lower meadows produce, is very different in qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,<note place="margin">GRASSES.</note> being remarkably fine and ſoft; and conſiſts in great part of the fine bent graſs, <hi>Agroſtis Capillaris.</hi> As we are on the ſubject of graſſes, it may be pleaſing to obſerve, how ſome of them wonderfully change their appearance, as they aſcend the higher hills: the turfy hair graſs, <hi>Aira Caeſpitoſa,</hi> ſheep's feſcue graſs, <hi>Peſtuca Ovina,</hi> Alpine meadow graſs, <hi>Poa Alpina,</hi> and ſome others, which, in the low countries, where they enjoy the due influence of the ſun, and length of ſummer, to ripen their ſeeds, are propagated in the common manner that graſſes are;
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0181900402:174"/>
as they reach a more exalted ſituation, where they want conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of ſummer, and the neceſſary power of that enlivening body, to perfect their ſeeds, become viviparous; that is, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment of the <hi>Germen</hi> vegetates, and ſhoots into blade in the cup, from whence falling, it readily takes root, and grows; a kind and providential diſpenſation, for the advantage of thoſe colder climates, which are leſs favorable to vegetation!</p>
               <p>THIS mountanous tract ſcarcely yields any corn. Its produce is cattle and ſheep, which, during ſummer, keep very high in the mountains, followed by their owners, with their families, who reſide in that ſeaſon in <hi>Havodtys,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">SUMMER DWELLINGS.</note> or ſummer dairy-houſes, as the farmers in the <hi>Swiſs Alps</hi> do in their <hi>Sennes.</hi> Theſe houſes conſiſt of a long low room, with a hole at one end, to let out the ſmoke from the fire, which is made beneath. Their furniture is very ſimple: ſtones are the ſubſtitutes of ſtools; and the beds are of hay, ranged along the ſides. They manufacture their own cloaths; and dye their cloths with <hi>Cenn du y Cerrig,</hi> or <hi>Lichen Omphaloides;</hi> and another <hi>Cenn,</hi> the <hi>Lichen Parietinus;</hi> native dyes, collected from the rocks. During ſummer, the men paſs their time either in harveſt work, or in tending their herds: the women in milking, or making butter and cheeſe. For their own uſe, they milk both ewes and goats, and make cheeſe of the milk, for their own conſumption. The diet of theſe mounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers is very plain, conſiſting of butter, cheeſe, and oat-bread, or <hi>Bara Cyrch:</hi> their drink whey: not but they have a reſerve of a few bottles of very ſtrong beer, by way of cordial, in illneſs. They are people of good underſtanding, wary and circumſpect; uſually tall, thin, and of ſtrong conſtitutions, from their way of
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0181900402:175"/>
living. Towards winter, they deſcend to their <hi>Hên Dref,</hi> or <hi>old dwelling,</hi> where they lead, during winter, a vacant life.</p>
               <p>IN the courſe of our aſcent, ſaw on the left, above the <hi>Cwm, Moel y Cynhorion,</hi> or <hi>The Hill of Council.</hi> Paſs through <hi>Bwlch y Maes-cwm,</hi> and ſkirt the ſide of <hi>Snowdon,</hi> till we reach <hi>Bwlch y Cwm Brwynog,</hi> where the aſcent becomes very difficult, by reaſon of its vaſt ſteepneſs. People here uſually quit their horſes. We began a toilſome march, clambering among the rocks. On the left were the precipices over <hi>Cwm Brwynog,</hi> with <hi>Llyn du yr Ard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dwy</hi> at their foot. On our right were thoſe over the ſmall lakes <hi>Llyn Glâs, Llyn y-Nadroedd,</hi> and <hi>Llyn Coch.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">THE HIGH LAKES.</note> The laſt is the higheſt on this ſide of the mountain; and on whoſe margins, we were told, that, in fairy days, thoſe diminutive gentry kept their revels. This ſpace between precipice and precipice, forms a ſhort, and no very agreeable iſthmus, till we reached a verdant expanſe, which gave us ſome reſpite, before we labored up ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſeries of broken crags: after theſe, is a ſecond ſmooth tract, which reaches almost to the ſummit,<note place="margin">TOP OF SNOWDON.</note> which, by way of pre-emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, is ſtyled Y WYDDFA, or <hi>The Conſpicuous.</hi> It riſes almoſt to a point, or, at beſt, there is but room for a circular wall of looſe ſtones, within which travellers uſually take their repaſt.</p>
               <p>THE mountain from hence ſeems propped by four vaſt buttreſſes; between which are four deep <hi>Cwms,</hi> or hollows: each, excepting one, had one or more lakes, lodged in its diſtant bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom The neareſt was <hi>Fſynnon Lás,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">FYNNON LAS.</note> or <hi>The Green Well,</hi> lying im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately below us. One of the company had the curioſity to deſcend a very bad way to a jutting rock, that impended over the monſtrous precipice; and he ſeemed like <hi>Mercury</hi> ready to
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0181900402:176"/>
take his flight from the ſummit of <hi>Atlas.</hi> The waters of <hi>Ffynnon Lâs,</hi> from this height, appeared black and unfathomable, and the edges quite green. From thence is a ſucceſſion of bottoms, ſurrounded by the moſt lofty and rugged hills, the greateſt part of whoſe ſides are quite mural, and form the moſt magnificent amphitheatre in nature. The <hi>Wyddfa</hi> is on one ſide; <hi>Crib y Diſtill,</hi> with its ſerrated tops, on another; <hi>Crib Coch,</hi> a ridge of fiery redneſs, appears beneath the preceding; and oppoſite to it is the boundary called the <hi>Lliwedd.</hi> Another very ſingular ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to this mountain is <hi>Y Clawdd Coch,</hi> riſing into a ſharp ridge, ſo narrow, as not to afford breadth even for a path.</p>
               <p>THE view from this exalted ſituation is unbounded. In a former tour<note n="*" place="bottom">Auguſt 25th Old Stile.</note>, I ſaw from it the county of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> the high hills of <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> part of the north of <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland:</hi> a plain view of the <hi>Iſle of Man;</hi> and that of <hi>Angleſea</hi> lay extended like a map beneath us, with every rill viſible. I took much pains to ſee this proſpect to advantage; ſat up at a farm on the weſt till about twelve, and walked up the whole way. The night was remarkably fine and ſtarry: towards morn, the ſtars faded away, and left a ſhort interval of darkneſs, which was ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed by the dawn of day. The body of the ſun appeared moſt diſtinct, with the rotundity of the moon, before it roſe high enough to render its beams too brilliant for our ſight. The ſea which bounded the weſtern part was gilt by its beams, firſt in ſlender ſtreaks, at length glowed with redneſs. The proſpect was diſcloſed to us like the gradual drawing up of a curtain in a
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0181900402:177"/>
theatre. We ſaw more and more, till the heat became ſo power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, as to attract the miſts from the various lakes, which in a ſlight degree obſcured the proſpect. The ſhadow of the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain was flung many miles, and ſhewed its bicapitated form; the <hi>Wyddfa</hi> making one, <hi>Crib y Diſtill</hi> the other head. I counted this time between twenty and thirty lakes, either in this county, or <hi>Meirionyddſhire.</hi> The day proved ſo exceſſively hot, that my journey coſt me the ſkin of the lower part of my face, before I reached the reſting-place, after the fatigue of the morning.</p>
               <p>ON this day<note n="*" place="bottom">Auguſt 15th, New Stile.</note>, the ſky was obſcured very ſoon after I got up. A vaſt miſt enveloped the whole circuit of the mountain. The proſpect down was horrible. It gave an idea of numbers of abyſſes, concealed by a thick ſmoke, furiouſly circulating around us. Very often a guſt of wind formed an opening in the clouds, which gave a fine and diſtinct viſto of lake and valley. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they opened only in one place; at others, in many at once, exhibiting a moſt ſtrange and perplexing ſight of water, fields, rocks, or chaſms, in fifty different places. They then cloſed at once, and left us involved in darkneſs: in a ſmall ſpace, they would ſeparate again, and fly in wild eddies round the middle of the mountains, and expoſe, in parts, both tops and baſes clear to our view. We deſcended from this various ſcene with great reluctance; but before we reached our horſes, a thunder ſtorm overtook us. Its rolling among the mountains was inexpreſſibly awful: the rain uncommonly heavy. We re-mounted our horſes, and gained the bottom with great hazard. The little
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:0181900402:178"/>
rills, which on our aſcent trickled along the gullies on the ſides of the mountain, were now ſwelled into torrents; and we and our ſteeds paſſed with the utmoſt riſque of being ſwept away by theſe ſudden waters. At length we arrived ſafe, yet ſufficiently wet and weary, to our former quarters.</p>
               <p>IT is very rare that the traveller gets a proper day to aſcend the hill;<note place="margin">ATTRACTION OF CLOUDS.</note> for it often appears clear, but by the evident attraction of the clouds by this lofty mountain, it becomes ſuddenly and unexpectedly enveloped in miſt, when the clouds have juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore appeared very remote, and at great heights. At times, I have obſerved them lower to half their height, and notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they had been diſperſed to the right and to the left, yet they have met from both ſides, and united to involve the ſummit in one great obſſcurity.</p>
               <p>THE quantity of water which flows from the lakes of <hi>Snow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donia,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">RIVERS.</note> is very conſiderable; ſo much, that I doubt not but col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectively they would exceed the waters of the <hi>Thames,</hi> before it meets the flux of the ocean.</p>
               <p>THE reports of the height of this noted hill have been very differently given.<note place="margin">HEIGHT.</note> A Mr. <hi>Caſwell,</hi> who was employed by Mr. <hi>Adams,</hi> in 1682, in a ſurvey of <hi>Wales,</hi> meaſured it by inſtruments made by the directions of Mr. <hi>Flamſtead:</hi>

                  </note>; and aſſerts its height to have been twelve hundred and forty yards: but for the honor of our mountain I am ſorry to ſay, that I muſt give greater credit to the experiments made of late years, which have ſunk it to

               <p>THE ſtone that compoſes this,<note place="margin">STRATA.</note> and indeed the greateſt part of <hi>Snowdonia,</hi> is exceſſively hard. Large coarſe cryſtals are often found in the fiſſures, and very frequently cubic <hi>pyritae,</hi> the uſual attendants on <hi>Alpine</hi> tracts. Theſe are alſo frequented by the rock ouzel, a mountain bird; and ſome of the lakes are ſtocked with <hi>char</hi> and <hi>gwyniads, Alpine</hi> fiſh. The antient inhabitant, the goat, decreaſes daily in value, ſince the decline of orthodoxal wigs, to which its ſnowy hair univerſally contributed. Still large flocks are kept for the dairy, and milked with great regularity.</p>
               <p>BOTANY is not within my province.<note place="margin">BOTANY.</note> I ſhall therefore ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more of the plants, than that thoſe ſpecies which LIN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NAEUS ſo very expreſſively ſtyles. <hi>Aethereae,</hi> are entirely confined to the higher parts of the mountains; and notwithſtanding the ſeeds muſt be blown downwards, they never vegetate in the lower parts, which are deſerted by certain plants, which are natives of a higher tract of the ſame hill.</p>
               <p>THE animals of theſe regions are chiefly foxes. Stags were found here in the days of <hi>Leland,</hi> in ſuch numbers, as to deſtroy the little corn which the farmers attempted to ſow: but they were extirpated before the year 1626<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <p>THE aſcent from hence is either over looſe ſtones, or ſolid ſtair-caſe; and is exceedingly ſteep.

               <p>DESCEND a very ſteep road,<note place="margin">CWM DYLI.</note> into that part called <hi>Cwm Dyli;</hi> where we quitted our horſes, and began a moſt toilſome journey to viſit the hidden vales lodged in the boſom of the mountains. We began with clambering up the rugged face of a rock, broken into a multitude of ſhort precipices, and divided in the middle by a cataract, the diſcharge of the waters from the <hi>Alpine</hi> lakes. After about a quarter of a mile's labor,<note place="margin">CWM DYLI UCHA.</note> we reached <hi>Cwm y Cwm Dyli,</hi> a flat tract of hay ground, watered by a river, and filled with hay-makers; the farmer and his family being reſident here in his <hi>Havodtu,</hi> for the ſummer ſeaſon. After dining with them on curds and whey, we kept along the river's ſide, and found oppoſed to us another front, rugged as the former, and attended with a cataract. This was ſurmounted with equal difficulty. We found, on arriving at the top, a bottom a mile in length, filled with <hi>Llyn Llydaw,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">LLYN LLYDAW.</note> a fine lake, winding beneath the rocks, and vaſtly indented by rocky projections, here and there jutting into it. In it was one little iſland, the haunt of black-backed Gulls, which breed here, and, alarmed by ſuch unexpected viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, broke the ſilence of this ſequeſtered place by their deep ſcreams. We continued our walk, aſcending along a narrow path above the lake, as far as the extremity; then deſcending, reached the oppoſite ſide, in order to encounter a third deſcent, as arduous as the preceding. This brought us into the horrible <hi>crater,</hi> immediately beneath the great precipice of the <hi>Wyddfa,</hi> in which is lodged <hi>Ffynnen Lâs.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">FFYNNON LAS.</note> Its ſituation is the moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,

               <p>THE margins of <hi>Ffynnon Lâs</hi> here appeared to be ſhallow and gravelly. The waters had a greeniſh caſt; but what is very ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, the rocks reflected into them ſeemed varied with ſtripes of the richeſt colors, like the moſt beautiful luteſtrings; and changed almoſt to infinity.</p>
               <p>HERE we obſerved the <hi>Wheat-ear,</hi>

               <p>WE deſcended from this dreary ſcene, on the other ſide of the hill,<note place="margin">CRIB COCH.</note> above <hi>Llyn Llydaw,</hi> having the tremendous red preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pices of <hi>Crib Coch</hi> high above us, riſing into a mere ridge, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, or rather <hi>heriſſee,</hi> its whole length. The face of many of the rocks were marked with large veins of coarſe white cryſtal; and others, eſpecially <hi>Crib Coch,</hi> were varied with the deep green of the dwarf <hi>Alpine</hi> juniper. On attaining the top of the hills, above the lower end of the lake, we deſcend to the <hi>Gorphwysfa,</hi> where we found our horſes, and returned once more into <hi>Nant-Gwinan.</hi>

A little farther is the pretty lake <hi>Llyn Gwynan,</hi> about three quarters of a mile long, and near it are the ruins of a chapel of the ſame name.

               <p>NEAR the end of the lake, the valley grows ſo contracted, as to form only a narrow ſtreight; but almoſt inſtantly opens again into a fine expanſe, chiefly filled with the beautiful <hi>Llyn Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas.</hi> Beyond that, is a tract of meads, chequered with woods, and watered by the river created by the various lakes; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the name of <hi>Avon Glás-Lyn,</hi> from the lofty <hi>Ffynnon-Lâs,</hi> from which it originates.</p>

From hence is a noble view of the <hi>Wyddfa,</hi> which terminates the view through the viſto of <hi>Drws y Coed.</hi> It is from this ſpot Mr. WILSON has favored us with a view, as magnificent as it is faithful. Few are ſenſible of this; for few viſit the ſpot.</p>
               <p>NEAR theſe lakes <hi>Edward</hi> I. in the ſummer of 1284, reſided for ſome days; and from hence iſſued out more than one of his edicts. I find ſome dated <hi>July</hi> the 17th and the 20th. Others are dated in the ſame year, from <hi>Bangor, Caernarvon, Mold,</hi> and <hi>Hope.</hi> One from <hi>Caernarvon</hi>

               <p>I RETURNED by the ſame road; and again reach <hi>Bedd Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lert,</hi> where I made a coarſe lodging.

the mountains approach ſo cloſe, as to leave only room for the furious river to roll over its ſtony bed; above which is a narrow road, formed with incredible labor, impending over the water. The way ſeems to have been firſt cut out of the rock, and then covered with great ſtones, as uſual in ſeveral of our narrow paſſes. The ſcenery is the moſt magnificent that can be ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined. The mountains riſe to very uncommon height, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to us nothing but a broken ſeries of precipices, one above the other, as high as the eye can reach. Here is very little ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of vegetation; yet in ſpots there is here and there enough to tempt the poor goat to its deſtruction; for it will ſometimes leap down to an alluring tuft of verdure, where, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out poſſiblity of return, it muſt remain to periſh, after it has fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed the dear-bought repaſt.</p>
               <p>THE bridge terminates the paſs; and conſiſts of a ſingle arch, flung over a deep chaſm, from rock to rock. Above is a conſiderable cataract, where the traveller at times may have much amuſement, in obſerving the ſalmon, in great numbers, make their efforts to ſurpaſs the heights. Near the place is a ſalmon fishery. Here had been a royal wear in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. which was then rented by <hi>Robert ap Meredydd.</hi> It probably be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed in old times to our natural princes; for it ſeems to have been a moſt valuable privelege. We have ſeen before, that young <hi>Elphin</hi> was endowed with one by his royal father; and the effect of his diſappointment in miſſing his uſual revenues, by finding (which, I dare ſay, was in thoſe days a very rare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance) an empty wear.

knighted him, and, in perpetual memorial of his good ſervices, ordered that from thenceforth a meſs of meat ſhould be ſerved up before the pole-ax with which he performed ſuch great feats; for what reaſon he bore it in his coat of arms, and was ſlyled Sir <hi>Howel y Fwyall,</hi> or of the <hi>Ax:</hi> after the meſs had appeared before the knight, it was carried down and beſtowed on the poor.

is by a high rock called <hi>The Gimlet,</hi> a mile from land, to which it is joined by a range of ſand-hills. This place was made a free borough by the <hi>Black Prince,</hi> by charter, dated in the 12th year of his principality, at <hi>Caernarvon,</hi> in compliment, to <hi>Nigel de Loryng</hi> or <hi>Lohareyn,</hi> one of the gentlemen of his bedchamber, on whom he had beſtowed <hi>Pwllheli</hi> and <hi>Nevyn,</hi> in conſideration of his great ſervice in <hi>Gaſcony,</hi> and particularly at the battle of <hi>Poitiers.</hi> He entitles him to <hi>Servitiis quorum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cunque tenentium tam liberorum quam nativorum;</hi> by which it may be preſumed that he did not include the <hi>Welſh</hi> in the privileges. What thoſe were I do not learn; but they were the ſame which the burgeſſes of <hi>Rosfair</hi> in <hi>Angleſey</hi> enjoyed: and for them <hi>Pwll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heli</hi> was to pay to <hi>Nigel</hi> fourteen pounds a year, and <hi>Nevyn</hi> thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>two. This borough and <hi>Nevyn</hi> he freely beſtowed on him, with all its appurtenances, together with four librates of land, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the repair of his manors; and for all theſe he was only to pay an acknowlegement of a roſe, in lieu of all ſervices.

               <p>IN the church are two ailes, ſupported by four very handſome pillars. This being the place where devotees uſually took boat for <hi>Bardſeye</hi> iſland, was greatly reſorted to.

After doubling the farther end, we put into a little ſandy creek, bounded by low rocks, as is the whole level part.

               <p>THE houſe underwent the common fate of others at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.

Among theſe are, <hi>Porth Towyn, Porth Colman, Porth Gwylan,</hi> and <hi>Porth Yſgadan.</hi> Near the laſt, about thirty years ago, a rock, which towered a great height out of the ſea, was ſuddenly miſſed, after a horrible night of thunder and lightning, ſuppoſed to have been ſtruck down by the reſiſtleſs bolt.

Notwithſtanding the laudable example of the gentry, the country is in an unimproved ſtate, neglected for the ſake of the herring-fiſhery. The chief produce is oats, and black cattle. I was informed that above three thouſand are

               <p>THE herrings, about the year 1771, <note place="margin">HERRINGS.</note> were taken here in vaſt abundance, from <hi>Porth Yſgadan,</hi> or the <hi>Port of Herrings,</hi> to <hi>Bard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeye</hi> iſland.

The fiſhermen were wont to fling them away, on account of their ugly appearance: nor was this luxury known to the gentry, till one of their ſervants, who was acquainted with the fiſh, informed them of its being an inhabitant of thefe ſeas.

               <p>THE churches in this country are of very antient foundation. Some cauſe or other prevented me from ſeeing ſeveral old inſcriptions; a few of which I have ſince picked up. In the church of <hi>Llangynodol</hi> is ſaid to be this; <hi>Hic jacet</hi> GWEN HOEDL,

His life had been profligate; the monks therefore were determined that he ſhould not die the common death of all men, and accordingly made him periſh with ſignal marks of the vengeance of Heaven. Fancy cannot frame a place more fit for a retreat from the knowlege of mankind, or more apt to inſpire one with full hopes of ſecurity from any purſuit. Emboſomed in a lofty mountain, on two ſides bounded by
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0181900402:222"/>
ſtony ſteeps, on which no vegetables appear but the blaſted heath and ſtunted gorſe; the third ſide exhibits a moſt tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous front of black precipice, with the loftieſt peak of the mountain <hi>Eifl</hi> ſoaring above; and the only opening to this ſecluded ſpot is towards the ſea, a northern aſpect! where that chilling wind exerts all its fury, and half freezes, during winter, the few inhabitants. The glen is tenanted by three families, who raiſe oats, and keep a few cattle, ſheep, and goats; but ſeem to have great difficulty in getting their little produce to market.</p>
               <p>JUST above the ſea is a high and verdant mount, natural; but the top and ſides worked on by art. The firſt flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: the ſides marked with eight prominent ribs from top to bottom. On this might have been the reſidence of the unfortunate prince; of which, time has deſtroyed every other veſtige. Till the beginning of the laſt century, a tumulus, of ſtone within, and externally covered with turf, was to be ſeen here; it was known by the name of <hi>Bedd Gwrtheyrn:</hi> tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion having regularly delivered down the report of this having been the place of his interment. The inhabitants of the pariſh, perhaps inſtigated by their then miniſter, Mr. <hi>Hugh Roberts,</hi> a perſon of curioſity, dug into the carn, and found in it a ſtone coffin, containing the bones of a tall man<note n="*" place="bottom">Kenne's Paroch.

                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0181900402:224"/>AFTER emerging out of this chearleſs bottom, I found fresh and amazing matter of ſpeculation. I got into a <hi>bwlch,</hi> or hollow, between two ſummits of the <hi>Eifl</hi> mountains;<note place="margin">THE EIFL HILLS.</note> a range that makes a moſt diſtinguiſhed figure, with the ſugar-loaf points, from various and diſtant parts of the country: they range obliquely, and ſeparate <hi>Lleyn</hi> from the hundred of <hi>Arfon,</hi> and jut into the ſea near <hi>Vortigern's valley.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>ACROSS this hollow, from one ſummit of the <hi>Eifl</hi> to the other, extends an immenſe rampart of ſtones, or perhaps the ruins of a wall, which effectually blocked up the paſs. On the <hi>Eifl</hi> is the moſt perfect and magnificent, as well as the moſt artful, of any <hi>British</hi> poſt I ever beheld. It is called <hi>Tre'r Caeri,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">TRE'R CAERI.</note> or, the <hi>Town of the Fortreſſes.</hi> This, which was the acceſſible ſide, is defended by three walls; the loweſt is very imperfect, the next tolerably entire, and has in it the grand entrance. This wall in one part points upwards towards the third wall, which runs round the edges of the top of the hill: the ſecond wall unites with the firſt, which runs into a point, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts, and joins the higheſt, in a place where the hill becomes inacceſſible. The facings on the two upper walls are very entire, eſpecially that of the uppermoſt. They are lofty, and exhibit from below a grand and extenſive front. The ſpace on the top is an irregular area; part is ſteep, part flat: in moſt parts covered with heath, giving ſhelter to a few red grouſe. The whole is almoſt filled with cells. To be ſeen with advantage, the ſtation ſhould be taken from the ſummit, about which the cells are very diſtinct, and diſpoſed with much art. About the middle is a ſquare place fenced with ſtones; a ſort of <hi>praetorium,</hi> ſurrounded with two rows of cells: numbers
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0181900402:225"/>
are alſo ſcattered about the plain, and others again are conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guous to the wall all along the inſide.</p>
               <p>THE cells are moſtly perfect: of various forms; round, oval, oblong, ſquare. Some of the round were fifteen feet in dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter; of the oblong, thirty feet in length, with long entrances regularly faced with ſtone. All of them, when inhabited, were well protected from the weather by roofs of thatch or ſod.</p>
               <p>THE upper wall was in many places fifteen feet high on the outſide, and often ſixteen feet broad. It conſiſted of two pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel and contiguous parts, one higher than the other, ſerving as a parapet to the lower, which ſeemed to have had its walk, like that on the walls of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> There was in one place a cell in the thickneſs of the wall, or perhaps a ſally-port, in part ſtopped by the falling-in of the ſtones.</p>
               <p>I was determined to trace every ſpecies of fortreſs of this nature which lay in the neighborhood. On deſcending from <hi>Tre'r Caeri</hi> to the ſouth,<note place="margin">GARY GUWCH.</note> I very soon ascended <hi>Moel Garn Guwh,</hi> a hill of conic form, on the ſummit of which is a prodigious heap of ſtones, ſeemingly a ſhapeleſs ruin; if it was not for the appearance of certain facings of a central cell ſtill remaining, to prove that it had been a large tower, and an out-poſt to the preceeding place.

               <p>WHEN I made my viſit to <hi>Dinas Dinlle,</hi> I was under the guidance of a worthy friend, and learned antiquary, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend <hi>Richard Farrington</hi> (now deceaſed). He conducted me to his reſidence at <hi>Dines Dincethwy,</hi> about four miles diſtant. In the way he ſhewed to me <hi>Dinas y Prif,</hi> or, The Poſt of the Chieftain; a ſmall camp, about forty-four yards ſquare. Each corner is elevated above the ramparts; and withinſide are foundations of ſome ſtone buildings. By the name, it might: be the ſummer ſtation of the <hi>Roman</hi> commander in chief, reſident in winter at <hi>Segontium.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>FROM <hi>Dinas</hi> I viſited <hi>Glynllivon,</hi> a houſe built by the late Sir <hi>John Wynn,</hi> ſeated near the little river <hi>Llifon,</hi> iſſuing from the <hi>Kilgwyn</hi> mountain. <hi>Cilmin Troed-ddu,</hi> or, <hi>Cilmin</hi> with a <hi>black foot,</hi> one of the fifteen tribes of <hi>North Wales,</hi> and nephew to <hi>Merfyn Fryeh,</hi> prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> ſlain in 841, had his reſidence on this ſpot. From him are deſcended the family of the <hi>Glynns,</hi> who took their name from the place. They bear, in alluſion to the name of their anceſtor, a man's leg, <hi>coupè a la cuiſſe,</hi> ſable. A ridiculous legend tells you, that <hi>Cilmin</hi>'s leg became ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colored by eſcaping from a daemon, whoſe books he had aſſiſted a magician to ſteal. In leaping over a brook, which was to be the limit of the purſuit, <hi>Cilmin</hi>'s left leg plunged into the water, and aſſumed its ſable dye.

               <p>THIS town is juſtly the boaſt of <hi>North Wales,</hi> for the beauty of ſituation, goodneſs of the buildings, regularity of the plan, and, above all, the grandeur of the caſtle, the moſt magnificent badge of our ſubjecton. The place ſprung from the ruin of the antient <hi>Segontium;</hi> but it does not owe its name to <hi>Edward</hi> I. as is generally ſuppoſed. <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis</hi> mentions it in his journey of the year 1188<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  </note>. I greatly ſuſpect the <hi>Caernarvon</hi> of thoſe times to have been no other than the antient <hi>Segontium,</hi> whoſe name the <hi>Welſh</hi> had changed to the apt one of <hi>Caer ar Fôn,</hi> or, The ſtrong hold oppoſite to <hi>Angleſey.</hi> But the preſent town was in all probability a creation of our conqueror. A judicious warrior, ſuch as <hi>Edward,</hi> could not fail profiting of ſo fit a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation for a curb on the new-conquered country. It had natural requiſites for ſtrength; being bounded on one ſide by the arm of the ſea called the <hi>Menai;</hi> by the eſtuary of the <hi>Seiont</hi> on another, exactly where it receives the tide from the former; on a third ſide, and part of the fourth, by a creek of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai;</hi> and the remainder has the appearance of having the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulation completed by art. <hi>Edward</hi> undertook this great work immediately after his conqueſt of the country in 1282, and completed the fortifications and caſtle before 1284; for his queen, on <hi>April</hi> 25th in that year, brought forth within its

It is probable that many of the materials were brought from <hi>Segontium,</hi> or the old <hi>Caernarvon;</hi> and tradition ſays, that much ot the lime-ſtone, with which it is built, was brought from <hi>Twr-kelyn</hi> in <hi>Angleſey;;</hi> and of the grit-ſtone, from <hi>Vaenol</hi> in this county. The <hi>Menai</hi> greatly facilitated the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage from both places.</p>
               <p>THE external ſtate of the walls and caſtle are at preſent exactly as they were in the time of <hi>Edward.</hi> The walls are defended by numbers of round towers, and have two principal gates: the eaſt, facing the mountains: the weſt, upon the <hi>Menai.</hi> The entrance into the caſtle is very auguſt, beneath a great tower, on the front of which appears the ſtatue of the founder, with a dagger in his hand, as if menacing his new-acquired unwilling ſubjects. The gate had four portculliſes, and every requiſite of ſtrength. The court is oblong. The towers are very beautiful; none of them round, but pentago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, hexagonal, or octagonal: two are more lofty than the reſt.

               <p>PLAS NEWYDD,<note place="margin">PLAS NEWYDD.</note> the ſeat of Sir <hi>Nicholas Bayley,</hi> lies cloſe upon the water, protected on three ſides by venerable oaks and aſhes.

ſtone of one is twelve feet ſeven inches long, twelve broad, and four thick, ſupported by five tall ſtones. The other is but barely ſeparated from the firſt: is almoſt a ſquare, of five feet and a half, and ſupported by four ſtones. The number of ſupporters to <hi>Cromlechs</hi> are merely accidental, and depend on the ſize or form of the incumbent ſtone.

               <p>DR. BORLASE has ſhewn the improbability of theſe ſtones ever being deſigned or uſed as altars.

It is reaſonable to ſuppoſe them to have been ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchral monuments, and that the body might be lodged in the ſpace beneath; and near the monument divine honors might be payed, or ſacrifices performed to the manes of the dead<note n="*" place="bottom">See what the learned author offers in ſupport of his opinion, <hi>Antiq, Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wal,</hi> p. 210. and the following.</note>.</p>

                  <hi>Bangor</hi> opens on the <hi>Caernarvonſhire</hi> ſide; and in front is a magnificent bay, bounded by the great promontory <hi>Pen Maen Mawr,</hi> and the vaſt <hi>Llandidno,</hi> apparently inſulated; and the eſtuary of the river <hi>Conwwy</hi> flows at its bottom between thoſe noble headlands. This proſpect is ſeen to beſt advantage from that beautiful ſpot the Green, near the caſtle of <hi>Beaumaris:</hi> from whence may be ſeen, in addition, <hi>Prieſtholm</hi> iſland, and the ſemilunar bay from thence to the town; the fortreſs itſelf; <hi>Baron Hill,</hi> and its elegant improvements; nor muſt <hi>Red Hill,</hi> the houſe of Mr. <hi>Sparrow,</hi> ſeated at the head of a wooded dingle, directing the eye to great part of this delicious view, be left out of the deſcription.</p>

               <p>THE caſtle was extremely burthenſome to the country: quarrels were frequent between the garriſon and the country people. In the time of <hi>Henry</hi> VI. a bloody fray happened, in which <hi>David ap Evan ap Howel</hi> of <hi>Llwydiarth,</hi> and many others were ſlain.</p>

Their firſt employ is the forming of burrows; which falls to the ſhare of the males, who are ſo intent on the buſineſs as to ſuffer themſelves at that time to be taken by the hand. Some few ſave themſelves the trouble of forming holes, and will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſs the rabbits; who, during the Puffin ſeaſon, retire to the other ſide of the iſland.</p>
               <p>THEY lay one white egg. Males, as well as females, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the office of ſitting, relieving each other when they go to feed. The young are hatched in the beginning of <hi>July.</hi> The parents have the ſtrongeſt affection for them; and if layed hold of by the wings, will give themſelves moſt cruel bites on any part of the body they can reach, as if actuated by deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair: and when releaſed, inſtead of flying away, will often hurry again into the burrow to their young. The noiſe they make when caught is horrible, and not unlike the efforts of a dumb perſon to ſpeak. This affection ceaſes at the time of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>migration, which is moſt exactly about the eleventh, of <hi>Auguſt.</hi> They then go off, to a ſingle bird, and leave behind the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fledged young of the later hatches a prey to the Peregrine Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con, which watches the mouth, of the holes for their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, compelled as they muſt ſoon be by hunger to come out.</p>

The external aſpect of the hill is extremely rude, and riſes into enormous rocks of coarſe white quartz. The ore is lodged in a baſon, or hollow, and has on one ſide a ſmall lake, on whoſe waters, diſtaſteful as thoſe of <hi>Avernus,</hi> no bird is known to alight. The whole aſpect of this tract has, by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral operations, aſſumed a moſt ſavage appearance. Suffocating fumes of the burning heaps of copper ariſe in all parts, and extend their baneful influence for miles around. In the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent parts vegetation is nearly deſtroyed; even the moſſes and lichens of the rocks have periſhed: and nothing ſeems capable of reſiſting the fumes but the purple <hi>Melic</hi> graſs<note n="†" place="bottom">Melica Caerulea, Lightfoot, Fl.

               <p>I HAVE little doubt but that the ore had been worked in a very diſtant period.

               <p>IN the year 1762, one <hi>Alexander Frazier</hi> came into <hi>Angleſey</hi> in ſearch of mines. He viſited <hi>Parys mountain;</hi> called on Sir <hi>Nicholas Bayley,</hi> and gave him ſo flattering an account of the proſpect, as induced him to make a trial, and ſink ſhafts. Ore was diſcovered; but before any quantity could be gotten, the mines were overpowered with water. In about two years after, Meſſrs. <hi>Roe</hi> and Co. of <hi>Macclesfield</hi> applied to Sir <hi>Nicholas</hi> for a leaſe of <hi>Penrhyn ddu</hi> mine in <hi>Caernarvonſhire;</hi> with which they were, much againſt their wills, compelled to take a leaſe of part of this mountain, and to carry on a level, and make a fair trial. The trial was accordingly made: ore was diſcovered; but the expences overbalanced the profits. They continued working to great loſs: and at length determined to give the affair up. They gave their agent orders for that purpoſe; but he, as a final attempt, divided his men into ten ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies, of three or four in a partnerſhip, and let them ſink ſhafts in various places, about eight hundred yeards eaſtward of a place called the <hi>Golden Venture,</hi> on a preſumption that a ſpring, which iſſued from near the place, muſt come from a body of mineral. His conjecture was right; for in leſs than two days they met with, at the depth of ſeven feet from the ſurface, the ſolid mineral, which proved to be that vaſt body which has ſince been worked to ſuch advantage. The day that this diſcovery was made was <hi>March</hi> 2d 1768; which has
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0181900402:291"/>
ever ſince been obſerved as a feſtival by the miners. Soon after this diſcovery, another adventure was begun by the reverend Mr. <hi>Edward Hughes,</hi> owner of part of the mountain, in right of his wife <hi>Mary Lewis</hi> of <hi>Llys Dulas;</hi> ſo that the whole of the treaſure is the property of Sir <hi>Nicholas Bayley</hi> and himſelf.</p>
               <p>THE body of copper ore is of unknown extent.<note place="margin">THE ORE.</note> The thick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has been aſcertained, in ſome places, by the driving of a level under it, ſeveral years ago, and it was found to be in ſome places twenty-four yards. The ore is moſtly of the kind called by <hi>Cronſted, Pyrites cupri flavo virideſcens;</hi> and contains vaſt quantities of ſulphur. It varies in degrees of goodneſs; ſome of it is rich, but the greater part poor in quality.</p>
               <p>THERE are other ſpecies of copper ore found here. Of late a vein of the <hi>Pyrites cupri griſeus</hi> of <hi>Cronſted,</hi> about ſeven yards wide, has been diſcovered near the weſt end of the mountain: ſome is of an iron grey, ſome quite black; the firſt contains ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen lb. of copper per clb. the laſt, forty. An ore has been lately found, in form of looſe earth, of dark purpliſh color; and the beſt of it has produced better thatn eight in twenty. Some years ago, above thirty pounds of native copper was found in driving a level through a turbery; ſome was in form of moſs, ſome in very thin leaves.</p>
               <p>IT is quarried out of the bed in vaſt maſſes; is broken into ſmall pieces; and the moſt pure part is ſold raw, at the rate of about 3<hi>l.</hi> to 6<hi>l.</hi> per ton, or ſent to the ſmelting-houſes of the reſpective companies to be melted into metal. Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi> has great furnaces of his own at <hi>Ravenhead,</hi> near <hi>Leverpool,</hi> and at <hi>Swanſey,</hi> in <hi>South Wales.</hi> An idea of the wealth of theſe mines may be formed, by conſidering that the <hi>Macclesfield</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:0181900402:292"/>
have had at once fourteen thouſand tons of ore upon bank, and Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi>'s, thirty thouſand.</p>
               <p>THE more impure ore is alſo broken to the ſize of about hen's eggs; but in order to clear it from the quantity of ſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur with which it abounds, as well as other advantitious mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, it muſt undergo the operation of burning. For that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it is placed between two parallel walls of vaſt length: ſome kilns are twenty, others forty, and fifty yards in length; ſome ten, others twenty feet wide, and above four feet in height. The ſpace between is not only filled, but the ore is piled many feet higher, in a convex form, from end to end: the whole is then covered with flat ſtones, cloſely luted with clay; and above is placed a general integument of clay, and ſmall rubbiſh of the work, in order to prevent any of the fumes from evaporating. Of late ſome kilns have been conſtructed with brick arches over the ore, which is found to be the beſt method of burning. Within theſe few years, attempts are made to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the ſulphur from flying away; and that is done by flues, made of brick, whoſe tops are in form of a Gothic arch, many ſcores of feet in length: one end of theſe opens into the beds of copper which are to be burnt. Thoſe beds are ſet on fire by a very ſmall quantity of coal, for all the reſt is effected by its own <hi>phlogiſton.</hi> The volatile part is confined, and diredted to the flues; in its courſe the ſulphurous particles ſtrike againſt their roofs, and fall to the bottom in form of the fineſt brimſtone;<note place="margin">BRIMSTONE.</note> which is collected, and carried to adjacent houſes, where it is melted into what is called in the ſhops ſtone brimſtone.</p>
               <p>THE beds of copper, thus piled for burning, are of vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent. Some contain four hundred tons of ore, others two
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0181900402:293"/>
thouſand. The firſt require four months to be completely burnt; the laſt, near ten. Thus burnt, it is carried to proper places to be dreſſed, or waſhed, and made merchantable. By this proceſs the ore is reduced to a fourth part in quantity, but conſiderably improved in quality: and by this means the water is ſtrongly or richly impregnated with copper, which is diſſolved by the acid quality of the ſulphur; and is collected or precipitated again by iron in the above-deſcribed pits. The iron is all diſſolved.</p>
               <p>BUT a far richer produce of copper is diſcovered from the water lodged in the bottom of the bed of ore,<note place="margin">PRECIPITATED COPPER.</note>which is highly ſaturated with the precious metal. This is drawn up, either by means of whimſies or windmills, to the ſurface, and then diſtributed into numbers of rectangular pits thirty-ſix feet long, ſome pits more ſome leſs, twelve to fifteen feet broad, and twenty inches deep. To ſpeak in the language of the adept, <hi>Venus</hi> muſt make an aſſignation with <hi>Mars,</hi> or this ſolution will have no effect. In plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> a quantity of iron muſt be immerſed in the water. The kind of iron is of no moment; old pots, hoops, anchors, or any refuſe will ſuffice; but of late, for the convenience of management, the adventurers procure new plates, four feet long, one and a half broad, and three quarters of an inch thick. Theſe they immerſe into the pits; the particles of copper inſtantly are precipitated by the iron, and the iron is gradually diſſolved into a yellow ocher; great part of it floats off by the water, and ſinks to the bottom. The plates, or the old iron (as it happens) are frequently taken out, and the copper ſcraped off; and this is repeated till the whole of the iron is conſumed. The copper thus procured differs
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0181900402:294"/>
little from native copper, and is prized accordingly, and ſold for prices of 25<hi>l.</hi> to 45<hi>l.</hi> a ton.</p>
               <p>THIS diſcovery is far from new; it has been practiſed long in the <hi>Wicklow</hi> mines in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and above a century in thoſe of <hi>Hern-grundt</hi> in <hi>Hungary,</hi> where it is called <hi>Ziment Copper</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Brown's travels, <hi>68.</hi> Keyſler's travels, <hi>iv. 70.</hi>
                  </note> The waters of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> mines are much more ſtrongly impregnated with copper than thoſe of <hi>Parys mountain.</hi> The firſt effects its operation in twelve or about twenty days; the laſt requires two months. Horſe-ſhoes, iron made in ſhape of hearts, and other forms, are put into the foreign waters, and when per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly tranſmuted, are given as preſents to curious ſtrangers.</p>
               <p>THE ore is not got in the common manner of mining, but is cut out of the bed in the ſame manner as ſtone is out of a quarry. A hollow is now formed in the ſolid ore open to the day, and extends about and hundred yards in length, about forty yards in breadth, and twenty-four yards in depth. The ends are at preſent undermined, but ſupported by vaſt pillars and mignificent arches, all metallic; and theſe caverns meander far under ground. Theſe will ſoon diſappear, and thouſands of tons of ore be gotten from both the columns and roofs. The ſides of this vaſt hollow are moſtly perpendicular, and acceſs to the bottom is only to be had by ſmall ſteps cut in the ore; and the curious viſitor muſt truſt to them and a rope, till he reaches ſome ladders, which will conduct him the reſt of the deſcent. On the edges of the chaſms are wooden platforms, which project far; on them are windlaſſes, by which the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are lowered to tranſact their buſineſs on the face of the precipice. There ſuſpended, they work in mid air, pick a
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0181900402:295"/>
ſmall ſpace for a footing, cut out the ore in vaſt maſſes, and tumble it to the bottom with great noiſe. In ſuch ſituations they form caverns, and there appear ſafely lodged, till the rope is lowered to convey them up again. Much of the ore is blaſted with gunpowder, eight tons of which, I am informed, is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually uſed for the purpoſe.</p>
               <p>NATURE hath been profuſe in beſtowing her mineral favors on this ſpot; for above the copper ore, and not more than three quarters of a yard beneath the common ſoil, is a bed of yellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh greaſy clay, from one to four yards thick, containing lead ore, and yielding from ſix hundred to a thouſand pounds weight of lead from one ton; and one ton of the metal yields not leſs than fifty-ſeven ounces of ſilver. Mixed with the earth, are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently certain parts of the color of cinnabar: whether theſe are ſymptomatic of the ſulphurous arſenical ſilver ores, or of quickſilver, I will not pretend to decide. Something inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feres with the ſucceſsful ſmelting of this earth in the great: inſomuch that it has not yet been of that profit to the adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers, which might reaſonably be expected from the crucible aſſays of it; and they have at this time about eight thouſand tons on bank undiſpoſed of. This place has been worked for lead ore in very diſtant times. In the bottom of the pool was found an antient ſmelting hearth of grit-ſtone, and ſeveral bits of ſmelted lead, of about four inches in length, two breadth, and half an inch thick.</p>
               <p>THESE works have added greatly to the population of the iſland; for about fifteen hundred perſons are employed, who, with their families, are ſuppoſed to make near eight thouſand perſons, getting their bread from theſe mines. The little vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage

At the ſeaſon of the greateſt work, Mr. <hi>Hughes</hi>'s men alone receive, for many weeks, two hundred pounds in one week, and a hundred and fifty in another, merely for ſubſiſtence. The port is no more than a great chaſm between two rocks, running far into land, and dry at low-water; into which ſloops run, and lie ſecure to receive their lading.</p>
               <p>FROM <hi>Parys mountain</hi> I viſited the north-weſt parts of the iſland, and paſſed over a ſandy plain country, fertile in grain.

The ſite was wholly unknown, till it was pointed out to me by the reverend Mr. <hi>E. R. Owen,</hi> a gentleman to whom this part of the work is under frequent obligations. It lies nearly a quarter of a mile eaſtward of the town, on the ridge of hills which bound the ſouth-eaſt ſide of the vale, and nearly the ſame diſtance from the port. The caſtle ſtood on a rocky, and, in many parts, a precipitous hill. Three ſides of the walls are eaſily to be traced: on the ſouth-eaſt ſide they extended a hundred and twenty yards; on the ſouth-weſt, ſixty-ſix, ending at a precipice; the north-eaſt may be traced forty yards, and ends in the ſame manner. On the fourth ſide, the natural ſtrength of the place rendered a farther defence uſeleſs. Mounds of earth tending to a ſemicircular form, with rocks and precipices, connect the north-eaſt and ſouth-weſt walls.

We know not the time of its demolition: probably as ſoon as the earl had effected his deſign, it was ſuffered to fall to ruin.</p>

                  <note place="margin">PENRHYN.</note> an antient houſe, once beautifully emboſomed with vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable oaks. The houſe is ſaid to have been built on the ſite of a palace of <hi>Roderic Mwlwynog,</hi> prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> who began his reign in 720. It continued long in our princes.

               <p>THE preſent buildings ſtand round a court, and conſiſt of a gateway, chapel, a tower, vaſt hall, and a few other apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.

It gives me great ſatisfaction to find, that the place will ſoon be reſtored to its former luſtre, under the auſpices of the preſent worthy owners, and on the plan of that able architect Mr. <hi>S.

               </p>
               <p>THE only furniture left to this houſe, which ſavored of anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, was the drinking-horn of its hero <hi>Piers Gryffydd;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">DRINKING-HORN.</note> out of which I have made libations, in the hoſpitable reign of the agent Mr. <hi>Richard Hughes.</hi> It was a large bugle, or horn of an ox, enriched with ſculptured ſilver, and with a chain of the ſame metal. At one end are the initials of his own name, P. G. and thoſe of his father and mother, R. G. K. or <hi>Rhys</hi> and <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therine Gryffydd.</hi> Such horns were in uſe with <hi>Danes, Saxons, Scots,</hi> and <hi>Welſh.</hi> We had in old times three ſpecies in our royal court, which, by uſage, were to be made of thoſe of the
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0181900402:311"/>
ox. The firſt was <hi>Y Corn ydd Yfo y</hi> BRENIN, or that allotted for the ſole uſe of the king; the ſecond was <hi>Corn Cyweithas,</hi> or the horn with which the domeſtics of the palace was to be called; and the third was <hi>y Corny y Pencynydd,</hi> or the horn of the chief huntſman. Each of them was to be worth a pound<note n="*" place="bottom">Leges Walliea, <hi>311.</hi>
                  </note>. To drink out of the royal cup, at great entertainments, was a privilege of the officers of the palace. Thus the governor was to receive a cup of metheglin by the hand of the high ſteward. The ſame officer was alſo diſpenſer of horns of drink to ſeveral others; among them, to the royal porter; who at certain ſeaſons had, beſides his horn from the king and queen, another from the maſter of the horſe, which was ſtyled <hi>Gwi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rawd i'r Ebyſdyl,</hi> or the <hi>Waiſſail</hi> cup of the <hi>apoſtle</hi>

                  </note>. And the <hi>Saxon Ulphus,</hi> when he conveyed certain lands to the church of <hi>York,</hi> quaffed off the horn, DEO <hi>et St. Petro</hi>

                  </note>. On leſs ſerious occaſions, on feſtive days, the horn was emptied at one tip, and then blown to ſhew that there was no deceit. The jovial horn was a ſubject of poetry.

It is a ſmall but neat ſtructure, in form of a croſs; with the tower in the center, ſupported within by four arches. Here is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved an alabaſter monument of an armed man, and his lady, recumbent. They probably belonged to the neighboring houſe; but on the diſſolution were removed from the friery of <hi>Llanvaes,</hi> where the perſons repreſented had been interred. A mural monument, with the figure of archbiſshop <hi>John Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> in his epiſcopal dreſs,<note place="margin">ARCHBISHOP WILLIAMS.</note> kneeling at an altar, is placed above the remains of that great prelate. He was born at <hi>Conwy.</hi>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:0181900402:320"/>
His father <hi>Edmund</hi> was ſixth ſon of the neighboring family of <hi>Cwchwillan,</hi> a branch of that of <hi>Penrhyn.</hi> His mother <hi>Mary,</hi> daughter of <hi>Owen ap John Owen</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Pedigree of the family, MS.</note>. The archbiſhop was fifth ſon. In his childiſh years, with other play-fellows, he was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verting himſelf with leaping from part of the walls of <hi>Conwy</hi> down to the ſhore. The fall was on ſo critical a part, as ever to ſecure him from all reproaches of unchaſtity. I mention this merely to reſcue him from the reflections flung on him by that ſatyrical hiſtorian Sir <hi>Anthony Weldon</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Memoirs.</note>. At ſchool, which was that of <hi>Ruthin,</hi> he was a compound of alternate truantry and induſtry. His great abilities were ſoon taken notice of. He entered on public life as chaplain to lord chancellor <hi>Eger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> and preaching before the king, ſo pleaſed the royal ear, that in 1610 <hi>James</hi> made him dean of <hi>Saliſbury;</hi> and on far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther diſcovery of his great abilities, in 1620, dean of <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter;</hi> and in 1621, lord keeper, in the room of the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord <hi>Bacon;</hi> and in leſs than a month, nominated him to the ſee of <hi>Lincoln.</hi> Now placed above reſtraint, his character be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to unfold. His ſpirit grew beyond the controul of mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; for, with undaunted courage, he perſiſted in all that was right: and, being ſubject to the failings of his country, (great paſſion, pride, and vanity) ſometimes in what was wrong. He diſcharged his office, foreign as it was to his profeſſion, with diſtinguiſhed credit near five years. Soon after the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of <hi>Charles</hi> I. by the influence of the favorite <hi>Buckingham,</hi> he was ſuddenly diſmiſſed: for he always had reſiſted the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable demands of that minion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="296" facs="tcp:0181900402:321"/>IN two parts of his conduct I muſt conſider him as a wife but not as a good man:—His advice to his diſtreſſed maſter, in the caſe of the earl of <hi>Strafford,</hi> had too great a ſhare of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity to be vindicated; perhaps of reſentment, for he hated the devoted miniſter. The ſpirit of <hi>Machiavel</hi> aroſe ſtrong in him, when he ſpoke of a public and private conſcience; and ſtill more ſtrongly when he adviſed <hi>Charles,</hi> in caſe the king could not gain <hi>Cromwel</hi> by promiſes of fair treatment, to catch him by ſome ſtratagem, and cut him ſhort. He may appear in theſe inſtances a great miniſter, but a bad divine. The infirmity, the inequalities, which may be met in men even of firſt-rate abilities, may be exemplified in his attempt to defend himſelf from a frivolous accuſation; for he fell into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful crime of ſubornation of perjury, was cenſured in the ſtar-chamber, and ſuffered impriſonment from 1637 to 1640. On his releaſe, irritated againſt the court, he for a time joined the popular leaders. Let me attribute this (and candor may admit the cauſe) to the natural violence of his temper; for on all trying occaſions he ſhewed his zeal for the liberty of the ſubject, and his ſincerity to his order. Soon after this, he was, according to an old promiſe, promoted to the ſee of <hi>York.</hi> He was a firm friend to the <hi>petition of right</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Drake's Parliam. Hiſt. <hi>viii. 146.</hi>
                  </note>, foreſeeing that he ſerved both king and people in the ſupport of it. As a friend to the church, he was ſo ſucceſsful an advocate, and ſhewed ſuch eloquence and ſtrength of reaſoning, in the debate in <hi>May</hi> 1641, on taking away the votes of biſhops in the houſe of lords<note n="†" place="bottom">The ſame, ix, 334.</note>, as to cauſe the affair to be dropped for that ſeſſions.
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0181900402:322"/>
In the latter end of the year, when popular fury ran high, he was attacked in <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> abbey; and with great courage re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled the violence of the mob. This gave riſe to the firſt ſatyrical political print I know. The prelate is repreſented in his epiſcopal dreſs, a muſket on his ſhoulder, reſt in his hand, helmet on his head, and mitre on the ground. The rage of the common people increaſed, even ſo far as to ſeize him in his way to the houſe of lords, and to tear his robes from his back. Incenſed at this, he returned to <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> abbey (the deanery of which he had been allowed to hold three years in <hi>commendam</hi>) and, in a fit of paſſion, induced eleven biſhops to join him in a phrenetic proteſt againſt all acts that ſhould be done in the houſe of lords during their forced abſence<note n="*" place="bottom">Clarendon, <hi>ii. 350.</hi>
                  </note>. This brought an impeachment of high-treaſon againſt them, impriſonment of eighteen months, and in the end a releaſe upon bail, in which the archbiſhop in particular was bound not to go into his dioceſe during the diſturbances in the county of <hi>York</hi>

               <p>I CONTINUED my journey from <hi>Aber</hi> along the rich receſs, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying a fine view of the entrance into the <hi>Menai,</hi> with its wooded ſhores of <hi>Angleſey</hi> and <hi>Prieſtholm</hi> iſle, and the great expanſe of water between them and <hi>Llandudno,</hi> or <hi>Ormſhead:</hi> the vaſt cape riſing, like the rock of <hi>Gibraltar,</hi> high out of the waves. Before me ſoared the great promontory of PENMAEN MAWR, protruding itſelf into the ſea, and exhibiting a fine contraſt to the fertility which it interrupts, by a rude view of grey weather-beaten ſtone and precipice. I paſſed by <hi>Bryn y Neuodd,</hi> a houſe late the property of <hi>Humphrey Roberts,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> now of his daughter and ſole heireſs, relict of <hi>Robert Wynne,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0181900402:329"/>
                  <hi>Plâſnewydd,</hi> near <hi>Denbigh.</hi> A little farther is the ſmall vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage and church of <hi>Llanvair Vechan;</hi> from whence is a very ſhort ride to the once tremendous road over this celebrated rock.</p>
               <p>IN paſt times it was juſtly the terror of the traveller;<note place="margin">PENMAEN MAWR.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely narrow, bad, and ſtoney; and what added to his fears, for a conſiderable way the danger encreaſed with his progreſs, by reaſon of the precipice gaining additional height. Generally it was without the protection of a wall to ſecure him in caſe of a falſe ſtep; which might in the loftieſt place precipitate him ſome ſcores of yards, either on ſharp rocks or into the ſea according to the ſtate of the tide. A vein of a crumbling ſtratum, in one part ſo contracted the road as to excite new hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors. The <hi>Britiſh</hi> parlement eaſed the fears of the travellers by a generous aid; which, by means of the judicious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of JOHN SYLVESTER, about the year 1772, effected what was before thought beyond the reach of art to remedy. The road is now widened to a proper breadth, and near the verge of the precipice ſecured by a ſtrong wall. The deſcent towards <hi>Penmaen Bach,</hi> or the <hi>Little Penmaen,</hi> which before was hardly practicable, is now deſtroyed; and the road is brought on a level for two or three miles, at a vaſt height above a return of rich ſlopes, and the deep bottom of <hi>Dwygyfylchig,</hi> till we arrive at the rude back of that leſſer promontory; when we labor up the ſteep aſcent of <hi>Sychnant,</hi> with a horrible and almoſt precipitous mountain on one ſide, and hills, with tops broken into moſt ſingular crags, on the other. From the top of <hi>Sych<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant,</hi> the road is continued about two miles on a perpetual deſcent to the town of <hi>Conway.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0181900402:330"/>THE breach occaſioned by the crumbling ſtratum, is now effectually repaired by a ſeries of arches; a work the juſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration of travellers, and a high credit to the ingenious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triver. One danger yet remains, which muſt for ever baffle the art of man: the ſide of this great rock, above the road, breaks into millions of vaſt maſſes, depending often on preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious tenures; which, looſened by the frequent torrents, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times (though rarely) deſcend in ſtoney ſtreams.</p>
               <p>Two or three accidents,<note place="margin">ACCIDENTS THERE.</note> which have happened on this road, will remain as miracles. An exciſeman fell from the higheſt part, and eſcaped unhurt. The reverend Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> who, in 1762, was rector of <hi>Llanelian,</hi> in the iſle of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> fell with his horſe, and a midwife behind him, down the ſteepeſt part. The <hi>ſage femme</hi> periſhed, as did the nag. The divine, with great philoſophy, unſaddled the ſteed, and marched off with the trappings, exulting at his preſervation.</p>
               <p>I HAVE often heard of another accident, attended with ſuch romantic circumſtances that I would not venture to mention it, had I not the ſtrongeſt traditional authority, to this day in the mouth of every one in the pariſh of <hi>Llanvair Vechan,</hi> in which this promontory ſtands. Above a century ago, <hi>Siôn Humphries</hi> of this pariſh had made his addreſſes to <hi>Anne Thomas</hi> of <hi>Creyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dyn,</hi> on the other ſide of <hi>Conway</hi> river. They had made an appointment to meet at a fair in the town of <hi>Conway.</hi> He in his way fell over <hi>Penmaen Mawr:</hi> ſhe was overſet in the ferry-boat, and was the only perſon ſaved out of more than fourſcore. They were married, and lived very long together in the pariſh of <hi>Llanvair.</hi> She was buried <hi>April</hi> 11th 1744, aged 116. He ſurvived her five years, and was buried <hi>December</hi> 10th 1749;
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0181900402:331"/>
was buried cloſe by her in the pariſh church-yard, where their graves are familiarly ſhewn to this day.</p>
               <p>I HAVE more than once viſited the ſummit of this noted rock, to view the fortifications deſcribed by the editor of <hi>Cambden,</hi> from ſome notes of that ſenſible old baronet Sir <hi>John Wynn</hi> of <hi>Gwedir,</hi> and have found his account very juſt<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Cambden,</hi> ii. 804, &amp; ſeq. Before Sir <hi>John Wynn,</hi> a Sir <hi>Thomas ap Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam,</hi> medicus, M.

                  </note>. The aſcent is laborious. Soon after leaving the inn, I met with the ruins of St. <hi>Seiriol</hi>'s chapel, or, as it is here called, his <hi>Gweli,</hi> or bed; and after paſſing a conſiderable way amidſt ſmall trees and bruſh-wood, attain the bare and ſtoney part, or the <hi>Braich y Ddinas,</hi> (i. e. the arm of the city) which riſes in form of another hill out of this promontory.

               <p>AFTER climbing for ſome ſpace among the looſe ſtones, the front of three, if not four,<note place="margin">AN ANTIENT FORTRESS.</note> walls preſented themſelves very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly one above the other. In most places the facings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared very perfect; but all of dry work. I meaſured the height of one wall, which was at the time nine feet; the thickneſs ſeven feet and a half. Between theſe walls, in all parts, were innumerable ſmall buildings, moſtly circular, and regularly faced within and without; but not diſpoſed in any certain order. Theſe had been much higher, as is evident from the fall of ſtones, which lie ſcattered at their bottoms; and
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0181900402:332"/>
probably had once the form of towers, as Sir <hi>John</hi> aſſerts. Their diameter in general is from twelve to eighteen feet; but ſome were far leſs, not exceeding five feet. The walls were in certain places interſected with others equally ſtrong. On the north-weſt and ſouth-eaſt ſides are the plain marks of two roads, of a zig-zag form, with the remains of walls on both ſides, which lead to the ſummit. On the ſmall area of the top had been a group of towers, or cells, like the former; one in the center, and five others ſurrounding it. Three are ſtill diſtinct; of the two others are only faint veſtiges. Near this had been, I believe, a ſimilar group; but at preſent reduced to a ſhape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs heap of ſtones. Near one of theſe groups is a well cut in the live rock, and always filled with water, ſupplied by the rains, and kept full by the frequent impending vapours.</p>
               <p>THIS ſtrong hold of the <hi>Britons</hi> is exactly of the ſame kind with thoſe on <hi>Carn Madryn, Carn Boduan,</hi> and <hi>Tre'r Caeri,</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed pp. 194. 206. 207.

               <p>THE white beam, or <hi>Aria Theophraſti,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ARIA THEO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHRASTI.</note> is frequent on the ſides of this rock, and in many ſimilar places in <hi>Wales.</hi> No uſe is made of it in our country. The <hi>Swiſs</hi> procure from the berries a good ſpirit. The wood is very hard, and excellent for
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0181900402:333"/>
flutes: and the wood, from its great ſolidity, was eſteemed to make the beſt charcoal.</p>
               <p>I DESCENDED from the ſummit into a hollow between the <hi>Penmaen</hi> and an adjacent mountain. Got upon my horſe, and directed my courſe on a good ſheep-walk towards <hi>Conway.</hi> In my way obſerved, above <hi>Gwdhw Glâs,</hi> in the pariſh of <hi>Dwygy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vylcheu,</hi> a long ſeries of antiquities, ſome of which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in the account of <hi>Penmaen Mawr</hi> preſerved in <hi>Cambden.</hi> For a very conſiderable length of way I ſaw circles of ſtones of various diameters, and great <hi>Carneddau.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CIRCLES AND CARNEDDAU.</note> The principal circle conſiſts at preſent of ten upright ſtones, at unequal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances from each other; the largeſt of which is eight feet three inches high: on the ground is another, eleven feet two. The circle is completed by a low bank of looſe ſtones placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the greater. The diameter of this circle is eighty feet. Near this are four other circles, far inferior in ſize. In the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of one is a flat ſtone, the remains of a Cromlech; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably the reſt might have had thoſe memorials before they were removed for the purpoſe of walling, or the like. About a quarter of a mile from theſe is a large <hi>Carnedd,</hi> compoſed of ſmall ſtones, and near it another of large ſtones; and not far from theſe, a circle compoſed of ſmall ones<note n="*" place="bottom">An aſſemblage of antiquities of this nature may be ſeen in plate ii. book iii. of Mr. THOMAS WRIGHT'S <hi>Louthirna.</hi> That book is a ſmall ſpecimen of his great abilities.

or <hi>Stone of the Games;</hi> and almoſt contiguous is a Carnedd, and a ſmall circle of twelve ſtones. This tract had certainly been much inhabited; for all around are the foundations of ſmall buildings, made of rounded ſtones, ſuitable to the rudeneſs and ſimplicity of diſtant ages. Small upright ſtones, and numbers of ſmall <hi>Carnedds,</hi> are ſcattered in various places; and the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige of a formed road is to be ſeen pointing from hence towards the <hi>Conway.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHATSOEVER purpoſe the leſſer circles might be deſigned for, there is great reaſon to ſuppoſe that the greater, eſpecially that near to the <hi>Maen y Campiau,</hi> were the <hi>Britiſh</hi> circus for the exhibition of antient games; probably the <hi>Eiſteddfods,</hi> or ſeſſions for deciding the merits of rivals in our <hi>Britiſh Olympics,</hi> might have been originally held here, or in ſimilar places. Of <hi>Britiſh</hi> games,<note place="margin">THE ANTIENT GAMES.</note> we had twenty-four, <hi>Pedair</hi> CAMP <hi>ar hugain,</hi> whoſe names, as preſerved by Dr. <hi>Davies</hi> in his Dictionary, I ſhall give, with their explanation, as far as in my power. Of theſe, ten were called GWROLGAMPAU, or manly games; of theſe, ſix depended on bodily ſtrength alone, and were ſtyled <hi>Tadogion,</hi> i. e. <hi>Father games,</hi> becauſe no inſtrument whatſoever was neceſſary to perform them: for they depended on the man, naked as he was born. The <hi>Greeks</hi> had their <hi>Pentathlum.</hi> We had one more. I. Strength to raiſe weights; II. Running; III. Leaping; IV. Swimming; V. Wreſtling; VI. Riding. I imagine that the word <hi>Marchogaeth</hi> extends farther than the common acceptation, and that the game intended was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt between charioteers; for no people were more ſkilled in the uſe of chariots in war than the <hi>Britons:</hi> it is therefore impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that they would not, in time of peace, exert their art in
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0181900402:335"/>
mimic combat, or in competitions of ſpeed in the feſtive field. And theſe ſix were undoubtedly original games of this iſland, and from the earlieſt of times: of others, ſome doubt may be made.</p>
               <p>THE remaining four manly games were, <hi>O Rym-arfau,</hi> or what depended on ſkill in arms. I. Archery; II. Playing with the ſword and buckler; III. Playing with the <hi>Cleddyf Deuddwrn,</hi> or the two-handed ſword, the antient weapon of the <hi>Britons,</hi> as exemplified in a ſtatue of a ſoldier, found in digging among the ruins of <hi>London,</hi> after the great fire in 1666<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Monfaucon's Antiq.</hi> iv. 16. tab. ix.</note>; IV. <hi>Chwarau Ffon Ddwybig,</hi> or playing with the two-end ſtaff; which ſeems to correſpond with the more modern quarter-ſtaff.</p>
               <p>AFTER theſe were the ten <hi>Mabolgampau,</hi> or JUVENILE games. Among them, three ſpecies of the chare: I. Courſing with the gre-hound; II. Fiſhing; III. Fowling. The remaining ſeven were of the domeſtic kind: I. <hi>Bairddoniath,</hi> or poetical competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, of which I have before ſpoken<note n="†" place="bottom">In my account of the <hi>Eiſteddfoddau Caerwy, Tour in Wales,</hi> i. 427 to 446, ſome light is thrown on this and certain of the following articles.</note>; II. Playing upon the harp; III. Reading <hi>Welſh;</hi> IV. Singing a <hi>Cywydd</hi> with muſic; V. Singing a <hi>Cywydd</hi> between four with accents; VI. Drawing of coats of arms; VII. Heraldry. Theſe two ſeem ſo conge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, as to be unneceſſarily ſeparated.</p>
               <p>AFTER theſe were four <hi>Go-gampiau,</hi> or <hi>Sub-games.</hi> I. <hi>Chwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rau Gwydd-bwyll,</hi> a game like that of Draughts, played with <hi>men,</hi> and probably the game of <hi>Fox and Gooſe, Gwydd</hi> ſignify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a gooſe, and <hi>Gwerin y Wyddbwyll</hi> the men of that game.</p>

               <p>AFTER leaving the antiquities of <hi>Goddw Glâs,</hi> I joined the turnpike road above <hi>Sychnant.</hi> On the left, was pointed to me a lofty hill, impending over <hi>Conway March.</hi> On its ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit is <hi>Caſtell Caer Lleion,</hi> a <hi>Britiſh</hi> poſt, ſurrounded with ditches, and ſtrong ramparts of ſtones; an additional defence to the country, beſides that of <hi>Penmaen Mawr.</hi> The view of part of <hi>Conway,</hi> and a large bend of the river, with its rich and wooded banks, are ſeen from the deſcent to them to great advantage.</p>
               <p>I ENTERED CONWAY at the upper gate.<note place="margin">CONWAY.</note> A more ragged town is ſcarcely to be ſeen, within; or a more beautiful one, without. The ſituation is on a ſteep ſlope to the verge of the river, here a mile broad at high-water. The form is nearly triangular, ſurrounded with lofty walls, guarded by twenty-four round towers. The lower face of the triangle borders on the river. A caſtle of matchleſs magnificence riſes on a lofty rock, at one corner; and from near each end of the town-walls, fronting the <hi>Conwy,</hi> a curtain terminated with a round tower ran ſome way into the river, the more effectually to prevent the approach of an enemy from the water.

               <p>THE caſtle was built by <hi>Edward</hi> I. in the year 1284; who, I believe, employed the architect who built <hi>Caernarvon.</hi> All his ſkill ſeems to have been exerted here. A more beautiful fortreſs never aroſe. Its form is oblong, placed on all parts on the verge of the precipitous rock. One ſide is bounded by the river; another by a creek full of water at every tide, and moſt beautifully ſhaded by hanging woods. The other two ſides face the town. Within are two courts; and on the outſide project eight vaſt towers, each with a ſlender one of amazing elegance iſſuing from its top, within which had been a wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtair-caſe. In one of the great towers is a fine window, in form of an arched receſs, or bow, ornamented with pillars. This, in antient times, was an elegant part of architecture, called the <hi>oriel,</hi> uſual in the houſes of people of rank; and appears, from a poem of the very age in which this was built, to have been the toilet of the ladies, and probably might have been that of Queen <hi>Elinor.</hi>

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Philip's <hi>Life of Archbiſhop</hi> Williams, 287.</note>. He began with fortifying his houſe at <hi>Penrhyn;</hi> and was at conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable expence in ſtrengthening this fortreſs. In the peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtate of thoſe times, multitudes of the country gentlemen requeſted the archbiſhop to receive into the caſtle their writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, plate, and moſt valuable moveables. He undertook the charge, and gave to every owner a receipt, by which he made himſelf liable to the loſs; and put his nephew, <hi>William Hookes,</hi> in poſſeſſion of the place, in <hi>January</hi> 1603-4<note n="†" place="bottom">Philips, <hi>289.</hi>

                  <pb n="319" facs="tcp:0181900402:348"/>AFFAIRS were in this ſtate till <hi>June</hi> 1646; when <hi>Williams,</hi> foreſeeing ruin to himſelf, irritated by injuries from thoſe who had embarked in the ſame cauſe with himſelf, and in the criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal time (when the king's affairs were deſperate) invited by General <hi>Mytton</hi> to put himſelf on the favor of parlement, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted his offer, and aſſiſted him in the reduction of the place<note n="*" place="bottom">General Mytton's <hi>Letter, in</hi> Drake's Parl.

               <p>THE beauty and grandeur of this fortreſs ſeemed to have induced the governing powers to forbear offering any violence to its walls: that impiety was reſerved for loyal hands.

               <p>SEVERAL years ago, the folly of ſome of the inhabitants, by getting ſtones from the rock beneath one of the great towers, brought down a vaſt ſegment. The ruins are the moſt awful I ever beheld; lying in ſtupendous fragments on the ſhore, ſome ſo unbroken as to preſerve both the grand external rotundity and inward concavity: a hardened cement of ſtone and mortar eleven feet thick. The proſpect of the upper part of the tower remains entire, ſuſpended at a vaſt height above our heads, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting in the breach ſuch a ſtrength of walling as might have given to the architect the moſt reaſonable hope that his work would have endured to the end of time.

It is a place of great antiquity, being mentioned in the record of <hi>Caernarvon;</hi> but was inhabited in far earlier times, as appears by the ruins of a ſmall caſtlet, now hid in woods, on the top of a ſmall hill near the preſent houſe. <hi>Bodſcallan</hi> ſignifies the dwelling-place of <hi>Scallan;</hi> in all probability a word corrupted from <hi>Caſwallon,</hi> the owner in ſome diſtant period.

cloaths, the princeſs with linen. He brought his cup with him into the hall; but was not allowed to drink more than would quench his thirſt, leaſt he ſhould get fuddled, and neglect his Hawks. He was allowed the hearts and lungs of all the animals in the royal kitchen, and ſometimes a barren ewe to feed his birds. Whenever his Hawks killed any of the three moſt noble ſpecies of game, the Heron, the Bittern, or the Crane, he received from the prince three ſervices; that of holding his ſtirrup when he deſcended from his horſe, of holding his horſe while he was taking the Hawks from the game, and of holding his ſtirrup again when he mounted his horſe: and at night the prince honored him with ſerving him thrice at table with his own hands. In caſe the falconer took any of the royal birds in the prince's abſence, he was to bring it into the hall, and ſhew it to him: on that the prince was to ariſe, or if he did not, he was to beſtow on him the robe which he then wore. During the time that the Hawks were in their mew, the falconer was not bound to anſwer any ſuit. If he killed his horfe in the exerciſe of his office, the prince was to find him another.

               <p>ON the ſame ſide are the remains of ſeveral rude walls without mortar, called <hi>Llety Vadog,</hi> or the houſe of <hi>Madoc,</hi> a ſuppoſed anceſtor of <hi>Gloddaeth:</hi> and not far from it is a ſtrait narrow path, with ſtones on each ſide, probably the remains of two walls; a watch-place for Deer, as the name <hi>Wylfa yr Ceirw</hi> ſignifies.</p>
               <p>ON a great eminence, called <hi>Dinas,</hi> is a large encloſure. The edge of the hill is ſurrounded with a rude wall; and within are multitudes of ſmall circular hollows, about twelve feet in diameter, environed with walls; ſuch as are found on <hi>Tre'r Caeri,</hi> and ſimilar places, the rough habitations of our diſtant anceſtors.

It is the conjecture of the learned, that the <hi>Druids</hi> made theſe ſtones an inſtrument of impoſition on their votaries; and in caſe of any judicial determinations, pretended that none but their holy hands could move them: and probably they were ſurrounded with a foſs, and had their preſcribed road to keep off the vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, and give greater ſolemnity to the miraculous deciſion.

               <p>I DESCENDED from <hi>Gloddaeth</hi> to the ſea ſide, about two miles diſtant.

                  <note place="margin">PENMAEN RHOS.</note> a great lime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone rock juts into the ſea at the end of the bay. In my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory the traveller went along a narrow path cut on its front, like the road on <hi>Penmaen Mawr,</hi> but infinitely more terrible and dangerous: a fine coach-road has of late years been formed far behind this precipice. From thence I deſcended to <hi>Llan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ddulas,</hi> a ſmall village and church. In one of the deep bottoms of this neighborhood was betrayed the unfortunate prince <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard</hi> II. who had been deceived by the earl of <hi>Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to go along with him from <hi>Conwy</hi> to meet <hi>Bolingbroke,</hi> to ſettle amicably the quarrel between them. Hereabouts he ſuddenly found himſelf ſurrounded by a large band of armed men, placed there by the treacherous earl, who ſeizing on <hi>Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chard,</hi> delivered him captive to the uſurper in <hi>Flint</hi> caſtle<note n="*" place="bottom">See the whole ſtory, agreeably expreſſed by ſuitable prints from old illumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated MSS. in Mr. <hi>Strutt's Regal Antiquities.</hi>

               <p>A LITTLE farther on the right hand, high above the road, is <hi>Cefn Ogo,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">CEFN OGO.</note> a lofty precipice; white, unleſs where darkened by the ivy which ſpreads along the front. In the middle is the
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0181900402:364"/>
moſt magnificent entrance into a cave which <hi>Britain</hi> can boaſt. It ſeems like the portal of a noble cathedral, arched, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided within by what has the appearance of a great column.</p>
               <p>FROM near this place begins the rich arable flat, which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends over <hi>Rudland Marſh,</hi> and beyond <hi>Preſtatyn</hi> in <hi>Flintſhire.</hi> The ſmall town of <hi>Abergeleu</hi> lies near the ſea,<note place="margin">ABERGELEU</note> about a mile from <hi>Cefn Ogo.</hi> It lies near the clayey cliffs which impend over the ſea. Tradition ſays, that in old times that element had over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed a vaſt tract of inhabited country once extending northward; a dateleſs, nameleſs, epitaph on the church-yard wall is called in as evidence. <hi>Yma mae'n gorwedd yn monwent mihangel, gwr oeddai annedd dair miltor yn y gogledd.</hi> 
                  <q>In this church-yard lies a man who lived three miles to the north of it.</q> But, as better proof, I have obſerved, at low-water, far from the clayey banks, a long tract of hard loam, filled with the bodies of oak trees, tolerably entire; but ſo ſoft as to be cut with a knife as eaſily as wax.</p>

               <p>IN church, at the name of the Devil, an univerſal ſpitting ſeized the congregation, as if in contempt of that evil ſpirit; and whenever <hi>Judas</hi> was mentioned, they expreſſed their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence of him by ſmiting their breaſts.</p>
               <p>IF there be a <hi>Fynnon Vair,</hi> the well of our Lady, or any other ſaint, the water for baptiſm was always brought from thence; and after the ceremony was over, old women were very fond of waſhing their eyes in the water of the font.</p>

                  <pb n="338" facs="tcp:0181900402:367"/>PREVIOUS to a funeral, it was cuſtomary, when the corpſe was brought out of the houſe and laid upon the bier, for the next of kin, be it widow, mother, ſiſter, or daughter (for it muſt be a female) to give, over the coffin, a quantity of white loaves, in a great diſh, and ſometimes a cheeſe, with a piece of money ſtuck in it, to certain poor perſons. After that they preſent, in the ſame manner, a cup of drink, and require the perſon to drink a little of it immediately. When that is done, all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent kneel down; and the miniſter, if preſent, ſays the Lord's Prayer: after which, they proceed with the corpſe; and at every croſs-way, between the houſe and the church, they lay down the bier, kneel, and again repeat the Lord's Prayer; and do the ſame when they firſt enter the church-yard. It is alſo cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary, in many places, to ſing pſalms on the way; by which the ſtillneſs of rural life is often broken into, in a manner finely productive of religious reflections.</p>
               <p>To this hour, the bier is carried by the next of kin; a cuſtom conſidered as the higheſt reſpect that filial piety can pay to the deceaſed.

and divides the counties: the latter is called by the <hi>Welſh, Sir Tre Faldwyn,</hi> or the ſhire of the town of <hi>Baldwin,</hi> lieutenant of the marches in the time of the Conqueror, who built the town; the name of which was afterwards changed to that of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> derived from <hi>Roger de Montgomery,</hi> the founder of the caſtle: which name it gave to the county when it was formed into one by <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.

               <p>The deſcent from this paſs is very ſteep; but a fine road was then forming, with the great view of giving the <hi>Iriſh</hi> a ſhorter way into their country, through <hi>Oſweſtry,</hi> and over the <hi>Bwlch,</hi> through the county of <hi>Meirionydd.</hi> This is one of the vaſt deſigns of the preſent age, which will effect communications with places before almoſt inacceſſible.</p>
               <p>ON arriving at the bottom, I again found myſelf in narrow vales, loftily bounded. After about three miles riding reached <hi>Llangynog,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">LLANGYNOG.</note> a ſmall village, in the pariſh of the ſame name, in the dioceſe of <hi>St. Aſaph.</hi> This place was the ſource of ſhort-lived wealth to the maternal relation of the preſent earl of <hi>Powys.</hi>

<pb n="347" facs="tcp:0181900402:375"/>
and was worked to the depth of a hundred yards, when the water became too powerful. It continued in a flouriſhing ſtate during a period of near forty years; yielded about four thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand tons annually: was ſold at 7<hi>l.</hi> a ton, and ſmelted on the ſpot; and brought in a clear revenue to the family of twenty thouſand pounds a year.</p>
               <p>A SLATE quarry has been diſcovered of late years in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.

               <p>AT about two miles diſtance from <hi>Llangynog</hi> I turned up a ſmall valley to the right, to pay my devotions to the ſhrine of St. <hi>Monacella,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">ST.

The princeſs had vowed celibacy. She fled from her father's dominions, and took refuge in this place, where ſhe lived fifteen years without ſeeing the face of man. <hi>Brochwel Yſcythrog,</hi> prince of <hi>Powys,</hi> being one day a hare-hunting, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued his game till he came to a great thicket; when he was amazed to find a virgin of ſurpriſing beauty, engaged in deep devotion, with the hare he had been purſuing under her robe, boldly facing the dogs who retired to a diſtance, howling, notwithſtanding all the efforts of the ſportſmen to make them ſeize their prey. Even when the huntſman blew his horn, it ſtuck to his lips. <hi>Brochwel</hi> heard her ſtory; and gave to God and her a parcel of lands, to be a ſanctuary to all that fled there. He deſired her to found an abbey on the ſpot. She did ſo, and died

abbeſs, in a good old age. She was buried in the neighboring church, called <hi>Pennant,</hi>

Her tomb was in a little chapel, or oratory, adjoining to the church, and now uſed as a veſtry-room. This room ſtill is called <hi>Cell-y-bedd,</hi> or the <hi>Cell of the Grave;</hi> but her reliques, as well as her image, have been long ſince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved: but I think the laſt is ſtill to be ſeen in the church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard. The legend is perpetuated by ſome rude wooden carv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of the ſaint, with numbers of hares ſcuttling to her for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. She properly became their patroneſs. They were called <hi>Mwyn Melangell</hi>—<hi>St. Monacella</hi>'s Lambs. Till the laſt century, ſo ſtrong a ſuperſtition prevaled, that no perſon would kill a hare in the pariſh; and even later, when a hare was purſued by dogs, it was firmly believed, that if any one cried <q>God <hi>and St. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacella be with thee,</hi>

               <p>THIS valley is exceedingly pictureſque: incloſed by hills on all ſides, except its entrance; watered by the <hi>Tanat,</hi> which

               <p>THE valley about <hi>Bodfach</hi> expands, is admirably cultivated, is watered by the <hi>Cain,</hi> and prettily bordered by low hills finely wooded. The town and church of <hi>Llanvyllin</hi> happily fill one angle, and vary the view.</p>
               <p>FROM <hi>Bodfach</hi> I made an excurſion to <hi>Llwydiarth,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">LLWYDIARTH.</note> a large old houſe in the pariſh of <hi>Llanwddyn,</hi> ſeated in a hilly naked country. It was formerly the property of the great family of

the <hi>Vaughans,</hi> deſcended from <hi>Aleth Hên,</hi> king of <hi>Dived,</hi> or <hi>Pembrokeſhire.</hi> The eſtate was conveyed to the late Sir <hi>Watkin Williams Wynn,</hi> by his firſt wife, daughter and heireſs to the laſt owner.

               <p>I CANNOT omit in this place mention of an excurſion formerly made to <hi>Llanrhaiadr yn Mochnant,</hi> a neighboring pariſh, partly in this county, partly in <hi>Denbighſhire.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">LLANRHAIADR YN MOCHNANT.</note> The church is ſeated in the laſt, dedicated to St. <hi>Dogvan,</hi> ſon of <hi>Brychan.</hi> Dr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Morgan,</hi> who firſt tranſlated the Bible into <hi>Welſh,</hi> was vicar of this.

               <p>THE facetious but learned preacher Dr. <hi>South,</hi> was the laſt rector of the pariſh. On his deceaſe, the rectorial tithes were appropriated by act of parlement to the maintenance of the choir and repair of the cathedral church of St. <hi>Aſaph.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I MUST ſpeak with due reſpect of the memory of the late worthy vicar,<note place="margin">PISTILL RHAIADR.</note> Dr. <hi>Worthington;</hi> to whoſe hoſpitable houſe I was indebted for a ſeaſonable reception, the wet evening which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately preceded my viſit to the celebrated cataract <hi>Piſtill Rha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iadr.</hi> It terminates the precipitous end of a very narrow valley, and, as it were, divides a bold front of the <hi>Berwyn</hi> mountains. After ſliding for ſome time along a ſmall declivity, it darts down at once two-thirds of the precipice; and, falling on a ledge, has, in proceſs of time, worn itſelf a paſſage through the rock, and makes a ſecond cataract beneath a noble arch which
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:0181900402:379"/>
it has formed; on the ſlippery ſummit of which, a daring ſhepherd will ſometimes terrify you with ſtanding. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond fall reaches the bottom, and aſſumes the name of the <hi>Rhaiadr,</hi> or the caſcade. The deſect of this noble fall, is the want of wood. When I viſited it, the approach was very bad; but that is not only effectually remedied by the late benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent vicar, but, as I am informed, he has beſides erected a cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, as a retreat to the traveller from the fury of a ſtorm.</p>
               <p>THE abundance of ſheep, which enliven theſe hills, brought, at the time I viſited the country, great wealth into it. The flannel manufacture, and that of a coarſe cloth for the army, and for the covering the poor negroes in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> is manufactured in moſt parts of the county. It is ſent and ſold in the rough to <hi>Shrewſbury;</hi> a practice very contrary to the intereſt of the country.</p>
               <p>LEAVE <hi>Bodfach;</hi> and, for the ſake of a beautiful view, am led by Mr. <hi>Lloyd,</hi> a little out of my way, to the top of a hill, from whence is a proſpect of a rich expanded vale, with the church of <hi>Llanvechan</hi> in the midſt. Part is bounded by low and fertile hills. The great rock of <hi>Llan y Mynach,</hi> the magazine of limeſtone for a vaſt tract of country, cloſes one ſide; beyond them extends the great flat of <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> with the <hi>Wrekin</hi> hill riſing inſulated in the diſtant ground. I returned through <hi>Llanfyllin,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">LLANFYLLIN.</note> a ſmall town, which had a charter beſtowed on it by <hi>Llewelyn ap Gryffydd ap Gwynwynwyn,</hi> in the reign of <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> II. and confirmed by <hi>Edward de Charlton,</hi> lord of <hi>Powys.</hi> This gave the burgeſſes exemption from tolls, <hi>Theam</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his territories, <hi>Gileam,</hi> and <hi>Hampſum.</hi> They could take, impriſon, and try, any thieves or malefactors; and, ſhould ſuch

eſcape, they had liberty of purſuing them for a league round the town. Any ſtranger reſiding in it, and paying ſcot and lot for a year, became free. It is governed by two bailiffs, choſen annually; who, among other privileges granted it by <hi>Charles</hi> II, were made juſtices of the peace within the corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, during the time of their office<note n="*" place="bottom">Cambden, <hi>ii. 783.</hi>

               <p>RIDE for ſome time on the <hi>Oſweſtry</hi> road. Aſcend to the right; go near <hi>Bryn Gwyn,</hi> a ſeat of <hi>William Moſtyn,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> above which is a circular <hi>Britiſh</hi> poſt. Numbers of them front the low country, on the hills which jut into it, as if guards to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect the internal parts from invaſion. Acroſs the road, in one place, I met the veſtiges of a very ſtrong rampart, to defend a paſs into the vale of <hi>Meivod,</hi> which ſoon after appeared in view. The church and village are ſituated in the middle of the valley,<note place="margin">VALE OF MEIVOD.</note> which is quite flat; extends in length more than five miles, and about half a mile broad. Three parts are bounded by low hills, prettily wooded; one end opens into the plain, and is finely terminated by the <hi>Freiddin</hi> hills, a vaſt maſs, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous feature in this county, and part of <hi>Shropſhire.</hi> The <hi>Vyrnyw,</hi> called by Dr. <hi>Powel, Marnovia,</hi> a beautiful river, winds along the middle of the vale. Its borders rich in wheat, rye, and graſs.</p>
               <p>THE church is dedicated to St. <hi>Tyſſilio,</hi> a prince of <hi>Powys,</hi> the ſupporter of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> churches againſt <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk. In old times it belonged to the abbey of <hi>Strata Marcella, Yſtrat Marchell,</hi> in this county.

The vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carage of <hi>Meivod</hi> is now appropriated to <hi>Chriſt-church, Oxford.</hi> It is a place of great eccleſiaſtical antiquity. There is reaſon to ſuppoſe, that it took its name from its having been, in the very early ages of Chriſtianity, the reſidence of a hermit or recluſe; for <hi>Meudwyfod</hi> implies a hermit's habitation, and <hi>Lan</hi> is frequently added to many <hi>Welſh</hi> words, to imply them to have been incloſed places; ſuch as <hi>Gwinllan,</hi> a vineyard; <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> a ſheepfold; <hi>Ydlan,</hi> a ſtackyard: ſo that <hi>Meudwylan</hi> would ſignify the precinct of the hermit, and, by the aſſiſtance of a <hi>Roman</hi> termination, become <hi>Meudwylanium;</hi> and that, readily, more latinized into <hi>Mediolanum,</hi> the name we find it bears in the Itinerary<note n="†" place="bottom">Iter Britanniarum.</note>, where it is placed between <hi>Bovium Bangor</hi> and <hi>Rutunium Rowton.</hi> We find it again in the Chorography of the <hi>Ravenna</hi>'s, and in <hi>Ptolemy</hi>

               <p>To revert to the Chriſtian antiquities: <hi>Meivod</hi> is ſaid to have been the archdeaconry of all <hi>Powyſtand,</hi> and that it had two churches beſides the preſent. Whether the chapel, whoſe ruins were ſtanding in no very remote period, and was called <hi>Eglwys Gwyddfarch,</hi> from a <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſaint of this country, might not have been one, I cannot ſay; the other was named <hi>Eglwys Vair,</hi> or the church of the Virgin, which was built in 1155<note n="†" place="bottom">Powel, <hi>205.</hi>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>IN the chief church were interred the princes and great men of <hi>Powys;</hi> among whom may be enumerated <hi>Madoc ap Meredydd ap Blyddyn ap Cynvyn,</hi> prince of <hi>Powys,</hi> who died in 1160, at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> and was conveyed here; and the noble <hi>Gryffydd Maelor,</hi> lord of <hi>Bromefield,</hi> who died in 1188<note n="‡" place="bottom">Powel, <hi>210. 242.</hi>

               <p>THE church-yard of the preſent is not leſs than nine acres,<note place="margin">CHURCH-YARD.</note> and yields to the miniſter as many pounds, as a paſture.</p>
               <p>NOT far above <hi>Meivod</hi> is an union of two rivers, both of the name of <hi>Vyrnyw:</hi> both of them diverge conſiderably from each other, and take their riſe remote from one another.

Both are large ſtreams, in many places black and deep. Soon beyond their junction the ground riſes. On a ſteep bank, above one of the rivers, ſtood <hi>Mathraval,</hi> once the ſeat of the princes of <hi>Powis;</hi> the name at preſent preſerved only by a farm-houſe.
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0181900402:383"/>
I could eaſily trace the ſite of the antient caſtle: it occupied the ſpace of about two acres. One ſide was guarded by the ſteep over the river; the other three ſides by a vaſt rampart of ſtone and earth, and a very deep foſs: a high exploratory mount, on which perhaps had been a caſtelet, fills one corner; from which is a clear view of all that paſſes up and down the vale.</p>
               <p>AFTER, this place was deſerted by its princes, the caſtle was poſſeſſed, or, as Dr. <hi>Powel</hi> ſays, built by <hi>Robert de Vepont,</hi> a potent baron, high in favor with King <hi>John.</hi> It is moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that he only reſtored, and ſtrengthened it with new works. In 1112, <hi>Llewelyn ap Jorwerth</hi> laid ſiege to it; but the king coming with a potent army, obliged <hi>Llewelyn</hi> to retire, and after that cauſed the caſtle to be demoliſhed<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſt.

               <p>IN <hi>Gwern Ddu,</hi> a wood oppoſite to <hi>Mathraval,</hi> beyond the river, is a circular entrenchment; and in a field, beyond the other branch, is a round mount; both which certainly had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, in early times, to the fortreſs at <hi>Mathraval.</hi> I muſt therefore agree with the learned <hi>Burton</hi>'s conjecture, that this might have been the <hi>Mediolanum</hi> of the <hi>Romans;</hi> it having been cuſtomary with <hi>Britiſh</hi> as well as <hi>Saxon</hi> princes, to have their palaces where formerly <hi>Roman</hi> ſtations had their ſituation and being<note n="†" place="bottom">Burton's Com. <hi>132.</hi>

               <p>THE country beyond <hi>Mathraval</hi> grows hilly, clayey, and barren. Paſs by the church of <hi>Llangyniw;</hi> to the left is <hi>Dolar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ddyn,</hi> where <hi>Henry</hi> VII. is ſaid to have lodged a night.</p>

The river is ſeen winding round the iſle; and the iſle itſelf, a tract of rich land mixed with trees, ſlopes gracefully to the margin of the water. A long and nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row wooded iſland diverſifies the view, by dividing the river into two channels; which re-unite, and run under <hi>Leighton</hi> ſhelf, a high cliff, which forms a noble finiſhing on that part.

                  <note place="margin">SHREWSBURY.</note> My entrance into the town was through the <hi>North Gate;</hi> which,

for greater ſecurity, in reality conſiſts of two gates, at a ſmall diſtance from one another, with a round tower on each ſide.</p>

               <p>THE town of <hi>Shrewſbury</hi> is ſeated within a peninſula, with the ground finely ſloping, in moſt parts, to the river. The caſtle was judiciouſly placed on a narrow <hi>iſthmus,</hi> two hundred yards wide, which connects it to the main land. <hi>Roger de Montgome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi>

In order to extend his fortifications, he demoliſhed forty-one houſes; for this part of the town, at that period, was very populous. Theſe houſes paid taxes; yet no remittance was made to the owners, notwithſtanding the greatneſs of their loſs. The firſt conſtable was <hi>Warine the Bald,</hi> a man of ſmall ſtature, but great courage.

Thus <hi>Robert,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Adam de Leyton,</hi> was obliged by his tenure to continue in this caſtle fifteen days, <hi>cum una baliſta,</hi> with one croſs-bow; and <hi>William de Wichard</hi> held the manor of <hi>Cold Hatton,</hi> to keep ward in this caſtle, at his own expence, twenty days, in time of war, <hi>cum uno equo, lorica, capello ferreo, et lancea.</hi> The conſtables were uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally men of the firſt note; and very often it was committed to the care of the ſheriff of the county.

               <p>THE firſt attempt towards the walls of this town, <note place="margin">WALLS.</note> was made by <hi>Robert de Beleſme;</hi> who, to defend it againſt the king's forces, then marching againſt him, drew a wall from each ſide of the caſtle acroſs the iſthmus to the water-ſide. One is ſtill remaining, and, as I have been informed, terminated with a ſquare tower: both theſe walls are preſerved in <hi>Speed</hi>'s plan of the place. The town was not defended by walls till the year 1219; when <hi>Henry</hi> III. ſtrongly urged the inhabitants to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider of ſome means of defence againſt an enemy. At firſt he made them a grant of various ſmall tolls; but at length, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe inſufficient, was obliged to aſſiſt them: but the work went on ſo ſlowly, that they were not completed in leſs than thirty-two years. The town was paved in the next reign, by the aſſiſtance of certain cuſtoms granted for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="395" facs="tcp:0181900402:423"/>IN almoſt every part, the original walls were at a diſtance from the river. Thoſe on the ſouth-eaſt ſide of the town are kept in good repair, and form pleaſant but interrupted walks, by reaſon of flights of ſteps. Thoſe on the north-weſt ſide are entirely covered with houſes. Beneath them is a narrow field, extending from the School to the <hi>Welſh Bridge;</hi> along the verge of which, cloſe to the river, in 1645, <note place="margin">ROWSHILL WALL.</note> was built another wall, called <hi>Rowſhill</hi> wall: the materials of which are ſaid to have been brought from <hi>Shrawardine</hi> caſtle.</p>
               <p>THERE are many hiſtorical evidences of the antiquity of the town.<note place="margin">TOWN.</note> It had been, for many ages, the capital of <hi>Powis-land,</hi> and the ſeat of the princes. <hi>Brochmail Yſcithroc,</hi> who lived about the year 607, is ſaid to have had his palace on the ſpot where St. <hi>Chad</hi>'s church now ſtands<note n="*" place="bottom">Powel, <hi>22.</hi>
                  </note> The <hi>Welſh</hi> called it <hi>Pen-Gwern,</hi> or the Head of the Alder-groves; and <hi>Ymwithig,</hi> or the <hi>Delight,</hi> I ſuppoſe, of our princes. The period in which the town aroſe, is not certainly known; but it is ſuppoſed to have been on the ruin of the <hi>Roman Uriconium,</hi> the <hi>Vreken Ceaſter</hi> of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and the modern <hi>Wroxeter,</hi> a ſmall village, about four miles from hence, upon the <hi>Severn;</hi> where may be ſtill ſeen a large fragment of the antient wall.</p>
               <p>IN the time of <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, <note place="margin">IN SAXON TIMES.</note> 
                  <hi>Scrobbes Byrig,</hi> as the <hi>Saxons</hi> called it, was a conſiderable place. At that period there were two hundred and fifty-two houſes, and the burgeſſes paid yearly 7<hi>l.</hi> 16<hi>s.</hi> 8<hi>d.</hi> in exciſe. Whenever the king lay in the town, twelve of the chief inhabitants kept watch about his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and if he came there to hunt, the better ſort of burgeſſes,
<pb n="396" facs="tcp:0181900402:424"/>
who kept horſes, rode armed as his guard, and the ſheriff ſent thirty-ſix footmen for their ſupport, while the king was reſident among them. When the king left the town, the ſheriff ſent twenty-four horſes to <hi>Lenteurde,</hi> to conduct him to the firſt ſtage in <hi>Staffordſhire.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>WHEN the ſheriff went againſt the <hi>Welſh,</hi> which he had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent occaſion of doing, it was cuſtomary to ſummon thirty-ſix men at <hi>Marſeteley</hi> park, to give their ſervice for eight days. Thoſe who neglected to go, forfeited forty ſhillings.</p>
               <p>THE king had here three maſters of the mint, who, like the other coiners of the county, were obliged to pay him twenty ſhillings at the end of fifteen days, while the money was out of the mint, and while it was current. The town paid in all twenty pounds yearly: the king had two-thirds, the ſheriff one. As ſoon as the <hi>Norman</hi> reign commenced, it paid to its new earl forty pounds.</p>
               <p>THE firſt charter extant (for that of <hi>Henry</hi> I. is loſt) was one in 1189, <note place="margin">CHARTERS.</note> from <hi>Richard</hi> I. It confirms all its antient cuſtoms and privileges; for which the town was to pay forty marks in ſilver, including ten for the purpoſe of providing a brace of hunters for the royal perſonage. It likewiſe grants to the burgeſſes the town and all its appurtenances, which had been ſeized by <hi>Henry</hi> I. on the forfeiture of Earl <hi>Robert.</hi> King <hi>John,</hi> in 1199, enlarged their charter, permitting the citizens to elect two ſubſtantial diſcreet perſons of their body as bailiffs for the government of the town; and that the common-council might chuſe four others, to determine all pleas of the crown in the corporation, and to be a check on the bailiffs themſelves. Various other charters, with additional privileges, were granted by ſucceeding princes,
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:0181900402:425"/>
till Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> made it a body corporate; and <hi>Charles</hi> I. confirmed and enlarged her royal charter. It now conſiſts of a mayor, twenty-four aldermen, and forty-eight aſſiſtants, who are called the common-council. They have alſo a recorder; two chamberlains, annually choſen by the mayor, aldermen, and aſſiſtants; a ſteward, a ſword-bearer, and three ſerjeants at mace.</p>
               <p>THIS town ſent members from the beginning. The right of voting reſts in burgeſſes living in the town, and paying to church and poor, according to a reſolution of the houſe in 1709; but in 1714, it was reſolved that foreign burgeſſes had a right to vote.</p>
               <p>THERE is in this town no manufacture conſiderable enough to merit mention; but it draws very great profit from thoſe of <hi>Montgomeryſhire.</hi> This place is the chief mart for them. About 700,000 yards of <hi>Welſh</hi> webs, a coarſe kind of woollen cloth, are brought here annually, to the <hi>Thurſday</hi> market; and bought up and dreſſed, that is, the wool is raiſed on one ſide, by a ſet of people called <hi>Shearmen.</hi> At this time only forty are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; but in the time of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> the trade was ſo great, that not fewer than ſix hundred<note n="*" place="bottom">Anderſon's Dict. <hi>i. 405.</hi>
                  </note> maintained themſelves by this occupation. The cloth is ſent chiefly to <hi>America,</hi> to clothe the Negroes; or to <hi>Flanders,</hi> where it is uſed by the pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants.</p>
               <p>FLANNELS, both coarſe and fine, are brought every other <hi>Monday</hi> (except when fairs intervene) to <hi>Welſh Pool;</hi> and are chiefly conſumed in <hi>England,</hi> to the amount of about 7 or
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:0181900402:426"/>
800,000 yards. The <hi>Shrewſbury</hi> drapers go every market to <hi>Welſh Pool,</hi> for the ſake of this commerce.</p>
               <p>THE diſpoſition of the ſtreets in <hi>Shrewſbury</hi> is extremely irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, <note place="margin">STREETS.</note> as is the caſe with all antient towns not of <hi>Roman</hi> origin.

               <p>AMONG the more remarkable civil tranſactions may be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned the parlements held in this town.

                  </note> In this office he died, and was carried to be interred in his cathedral at <hi>Wells.</hi> He was of a very antient family, dignified with barons, or knights, from the time of the Conqueſt; but he had acquired great wealth, which he laid out with true munificence. By certain monuments with the arms of the family, in the church of <hi>Burnel</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> it is ſuppoſed that they came originally from that country. The caſtle was honored by a ſeſſion of parlement in 1284: the lords ſate in the fortreſs, the commons in a great barn, the gable ends of which are ſtill to be ſeen. The <hi>Statutum de Mercatoribus,</hi> enacted here, is, from the place, known by the name of the ſtatute of <hi>Acton Burnel.</hi> It is probable that it was by the influence of the prelate, that his habitation was ſo diſtinguiſhed.</p>
               <p>HIS ſucceſſor in the caſtle was Sir <hi>Edward Burnel,</hi> who ſerved in many actions in <hi>Scotland,</hi> under <hi>Edward</hi> I. and appeared with great ſplendor.

on account of the arms which <hi>Nicholas</hi> bore, in right of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain lands of the barony of <hi>Burnel,</hi> beſtowed on him by his mother. Theſe arms <hi>de Morley</hi> had aſſumed without any juſt pretence; but becauſe, as he declared, <q>it was his will and pleaſure ſo to do, and that he would defend his ſo doing.</q> Probably he had no arms of his own, having been the firſt of his family who had appeared in a military capacity. He had ſerved as eſquire to Sir <hi>Edward Burnel,</hi> without any other domeſtic than one boy; and ever ſince the death of his maſter aſſumed the arms in diſpute. It happened that they both were at the fiege of <hi>Calais,</hi> under <hi>Edward</hi> III. in 1346, arrayed in the ſame arms. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Lord <hi>Burnel,</hi> challenged the arms as belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Burnels</hi> only, he having at that time under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand a hundred men, on whoſe banners were his proper arms. Sir <hi>Peter Corbet,</hi> then in his retinue, offered to combat with <hi>Robert de Morley</hi> in ſupport of the right which his maſter had to the arms; but the duel never took place, probably becauſe the king denied his aſſent. The ſuit was then referred to the court of chivalry, held on the ſands before <hi>Calais,</hi> before <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Bohun,</hi> earl of <hi>Northampton,</hi> high conſtable of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Thomas Beauchamp,</hi> earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> earl marſhal. The trial laſted ſeveral days; when <hi>Robert,</hi> apprehending that the cauſe would go againſt him, took an opportunity, in preſence of the king, to ſwear by God's fleſh, that if the arms in queſtion were adjudged from him, he never more would arm himſelf in the king's ſervice. On this the king, out of perſonal regard for the ſignal ſervices he had performed in thoſe arms, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the right of <hi>Nicholas</hi> Lord <hi>Burnel,</hi> was deſirous to put an end to the conteſt with as little offence as poſſible. He
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:0181900402:451"/>
therefore ſent the earl of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> and other lords, to <hi>Nicholas,</hi> to requeſt that he would permit <hi>Robert de Morley</hi> to bear the arms in diſpute for the term of his life only; which <hi>Nicholas,</hi> out of reſpect to the king, aſſented to. The king then directed the high conſtable, and earl marſhal, to give judgment accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly. This they performed in the church of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> near <hi>Calais;</hi> and their ſentence was immediately proclamed by a herald, in the preſence of the whole army there aſſembled.</p>
               <p>ROBERT <hi>de Morley</hi> was ſeized with his laſt illneſs in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> in the year 1360, when the <hi>Engliſh</hi> army was on its return from the blockade of <hi>Paris.</hi> Feeling the approach of death, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected that his banner, with the arms of <hi>Burnel,</hi> ſhould, upon his deceaſe, be delivered to <hi>Nicholas</hi> Lord <hi>Burnel,</hi> in purſuance of the judgment before paſſed in the court of chivalry; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly his banner-bearer, having in his hands the banner rolled up, delivered it to Lord <hi>Burnel,</hi> in preſence of numbers of the nobility, convened as witneſſes of the ceremony. Lord <hi>Burnel</hi> died in the year 1382, and was interred in <hi>Acton Burnel</hi> church, under an altar tomb, with a braſs inlaid in it of the figure of an armed man, and a braſs label, inſcribed, <hi>Hic jacet Dominus Nich Burnel, miles, dominus de Holgot, qui ob.</hi> 12<hi rend="sup">0</hi>

               <p>WALES was the refuge to the antient <hi>Britons,</hi> when they were driven by the <hi>Saxons</hi> out of <hi>England;</hi> and there they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved the antient blood royal of their kings, their laws, and antient language, from the fury of the <hi>Saxons.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There continued an implacable hatred and wars between the two nations. And though the heptarchy was reduced to a monarchy by <hi>Egbert</hi> king of the <hi>Weſt-Saxons</hi> (who firſt called that part England) yet he and his ſucceſſors received no obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience or ſubjection from the kings or princes of <hi>Wales;</hi> but they held <hi>Wales</hi> as abſolute monarchs, and acknowledged no ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior under God.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Cadwallader</hi> (the laſt king of <hi>Britain</hi> of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> line) and his deſendants, did govern the people, as their lawful kings and princes, all the time of the <hi>Saxon</hi> government.</p>
               <p>When <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror ſubdued <hi>England,</hi> he diſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed the <hi>Saxon</hi> iſſue of the crown; he rooted out moſt of their nobility, and brought in his own people, the <hi>Normans:</hi> and when he was in quiet poſſeſſion of the kingdom, the <hi>Welſh</hi> took no notice of his conqueſt over the <hi>Saxons;</hi> but accounted of it only as a war between two ſtrange nations.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:0181900402:460"/>Long before the Conqueſt, all <hi>Wales</hi> fell to <hi>Roderick</hi> the Great; who divided it between his three ſons: to <hi>Cadell</hi> he gave <hi>South Wales,</hi> containing 25 cantreds; to <hi>Anarawd, North Wales,</hi> of 15 cantreds; and to <hi>Mervyn, Powys,</hi> of 14 cantreds.</p>
               <p>The iſſue of theſe three ſons poſſeſſed <hi>Wales,</hi> according to the ſaid diviſion, in the Conqueror's time; viz. <hi>Rice,</hi> ſon of <hi>Theodore,</hi> ruled <hi>South Wales; Griffith ap Conan, North Wales;</hi> and <hi>Blethyn ap Confyn, Powys.</hi> Theſe three princes would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver acknowledge that the Conqueror had any ſuperiority over <hi>Wales:</hi> and for this reaſon there aroſe cruel wars between them, and they made daily incurſions on each other.</p>
               <p>The kings of <hi>England</hi> often invaded the borders of <hi>Wales,</hi> and forced the inhabitants to fly to the mountains; and the <hi>Welſh,</hi> at other times, made divers inroads over <hi>Severn,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried great ſpoils out of <hi>England.</hi> This ſo provoked them, that they reſolved to make a conqueſt of <hi>Wales;</hi> but the roughneſs of the country, the hills, woods, and bogs, was ſuch a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection, that a great army could hardly be brought to annoy them; but were often forced to return home with lofſs. As <hi>William Rufus,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> II. who entered <hi>Wales</hi> three times with royal armies; King <hi>John</hi> made war upon <hi>Llewelin ap for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>werth,</hi> prince of <hi>North Wales,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> III. upon <hi>Llewellin ap Griffith,</hi> which brought great loſs to themſelves, as well as da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage to the <hi>Welſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The kings of <hi>England,</hi> ſeeing it difficult to make a conqueſt of <hi>Wales</hi> by a great army, gave to the lords, and other great men of <hi>England,</hi> ſuch countries in <hi>Wales</hi> as they could win from the <hi>Welſhmen.</hi> Theſe are the words of divers of their grants.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:0181900402:461"/>By theſe means many were drawn to bring great armies of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> and <hi>Normans</hi> into <hi>Wales;</hi> who conquered many great lordſhips; which they held to them and their heirs for ever, of the kings of <hi>England,</hi> as lands purchaſed by conqueſt.</p>
               <p>The kings of <hi>England</hi> having built divers ſtrong towns of garriſon on the frontiers of <hi>Wales,</hi> after the Conqueſt; ſuch as <hi>Briſtow, Glouceſter, Worceſter, Salop,</hi> and <hi>Cheſter;</hi> as places ready to chaſtiſe the <hi>Welſhmen</hi> upon all attempts, the great men began to invade the countries next to thoſe towns; as namely, <hi>Peter Corbet</hi> for <hi>Cauſe; Mortimer</hi> for <hi>Wigmore; Fitz-alan</hi> for <hi>Clun</hi> and <hi>Oſweſtry; Walter Lacy</hi> for <hi>Ewyas-Lacy; Dru de Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladan</hi> for <hi>Abergaveny; Monthault</hi> for <hi>Hawarden; Gilbert</hi> lord of <hi>Monmouth</hi> for <hi>Monmouth; Fulk Fitz-warren</hi> for <hi>Whittington; Roger le Strange</hi> for <hi>Eleſmere:</hi> and ſhortly after came <hi>Robert Fitz-hamon,</hi> with his twelve knights, into <hi>Glamorgan; Bernard Newmarch</hi> into <hi>Brecknock; Strongbow</hi> to <hi>Dyfed</hi> or <hi>Pembrokeſhire; Martin</hi> to <hi>Kemes; Morris de Londres</hi> to <hi>Cydwelŷ</hi> and <hi>Cornwallon; Lacy</hi> earl of <hi>Lincoln</hi> to <hi>Rhôs</hi> and <hi>Rhyvoniog,</hi> now the lordſhip of <hi>Denbigh; Brewis</hi> to <hi>Gower, Buelt, Radnor, Melenith,</hi> and <hi>El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel;</hi> and to <hi>Roger Mortimer</hi> the country now called <hi>Chirk,</hi> then called <hi>Mochnant,</hi> and to <hi>Cynlleth</hi> and <hi>Nantheudwŷ</hi> and others to other lordſhips.</p>
               <p>That the lords might the better govern the people when ſubdued, they were ſuffered to take upon them ſuch preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and authority, as were fit for the quiet government of the country.</p>
               <p>The antient hiſtoriographer, <hi>Lampridius,</hi> ſaith, that the kings of <hi>England</hi> did then uſe the ſame policy with lands on the borders of <hi>Scotland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="433" facs="tcp:0181900402:462"/>No record to be found in the Tower of <hi>London,</hi> or elſewhere, of any grant to be a lordſhip marcher in <hi>Wales.</hi> The king's writs, out of the courts at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> did not run into <hi>Wales,</hi> except <hi>Pembrokeſhire;</hi> which was counted part of <hi>England,</hi> and called <hi>Little England</hi> beyond <hi>Wales.</hi> Nor were there any ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riffs to execute ſuch writs: but the lords did execute laws themſelves over the people which they ſubdued; which the kings permitted for a time.</p>
               <p>No charters of theſe liberties could conveniently be granted, for three reaſons.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. The kings of <hi>England</hi> did not know beforehand what lands a lord ſhould conquer, or whether he ſhould conquer any; and therefore could not grant any liberties within a certain precinct or territory.</item>
                  <item>2. The lords, after their conqueſt of any country, were not over-haſty to purchaſe any charter; becauſe they were not ſure but that thoſe lands might be reſtored, by compoſition between the kings of <hi>England</hi> and the princes, of <hi>Wales,</hi> as they ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times were: or they might be recovered by force, and the lords expelled. But,</item>
                  <item>3. The learned ſay, that the lords marchers had no charters of ſuch liberties, becauſe the liberties were of ſo high a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſo royal, and ſo united to the crown, that, by the law, it was not in the king's power to grant them from the crown.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The government by lords marchers continued in <hi>Wales</hi> till the time of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII; who, perceiving the <hi>Welſh</hi> to live in quietneſs and ſubjection, thought they might be governed by civil laws, as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were. And therefore, anno 27, c. 24, he reſumed moſt of thoſe juriſdictions into his own hands, and
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:0181900402:463"/>
appointed juſtices of peace, ſheriffs, and other officers; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided the country into ſhires. He governed them by the laws of <hi>England;</hi> and left little or no authority to the lords marchers.</p>
               <p>The lords, at their, conqueſt of the country, built caſtles for themſelves, and towns for their followers, in the moſt fertile part: and by this means the towns and caſtles in <hi>Wales</hi> were built, as may be ſeen in the antient charters of thoſe towns.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Some of theſe were towns before the Conqueſt; but, being deſtroyed in the winning of them, they were rebuilt by the lords.</p>
               <p>The lords held their lordſhips of the kings of <hi>England</hi> in chief, as of the crown immediate, by ſerving the king in his wars with certain numbers of men; and they were bound to keep their caſtles with ſufficient men and munition, for the keeping of the king's enemies in ſubjection.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="435" facs="tcp:0181900402:464"/>They executed the <hi>Engliſh</hi> laws, for the moſt part, within their lordſhips; and brought them to be of <hi>Engliſh</hi> tenure; and to paſs the ſame according to the laws of <hi>England,</hi> by fine, recovery, feoffment, and livery of ſeiſin. But ſuch parts as they left to the antient inhabitants to poſſeſs, were by ſome lords ſuffered to be held after the old <hi>Welſh</hi> cuſtom, the laws of <hi>Howel Dda;</hi> which was, to paſs the ſame by ſurrender in court (which they called <hi>Côf Lŷs,</hi> and <hi>Yſtŷn Wialen,</hi> whereof the word <hi>Yſtynnol</hi> was derived): and where that cuſtom was permitted, there is no deed to be found of any lands before the 27th <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. when <hi>Wales</hi> was made ſhire-ground; but, for ſuch lands as were turned to <hi>Engliſh</hi> tenures, you may find deeds of two, three, or four hundred years paſt, written in <hi>Latin,</hi> or <hi>French,</hi> as was uſed in <hi>England</hi> in thoſe days.</p>
               <p>The laws of <hi>England</hi> were brought in by the lords marchers, becauſe the laws of the land were unknown to the <hi>Engliſh:</hi> but they ſuffered the antient tenants to retain ſome part of the old <hi>Welſh</hi> laws; ſuch as the uſe of gavelkind, for parting lands between the brothers, and the paſſing of lands by ſurrender in court. And for this, in many lordſhips, there is a <hi>Welſh</hi> court for the <hi>Welſhmen,</hi> called <hi>Welchrie;</hi> and another for the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> called <hi>Engliſhrie.</hi> In ſome lordſhips the lands were divided by gavelkind, but paſſed by feoffments; from whence comes <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> tenure, and <hi>Welſh</hi> dole: in <hi>Welſh, Cyfraith Saeſnig, a Rhan-Cymraig.</hi> And the lords had the wardſhip of all the brethren, as if they had been ſiſters.</p>
               <p>The lords marchers increaſed in number, till <hi>Llewellin ap Griffith,</hi> the laſt prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> was ſlain, anno 11 <hi>Ed.</hi> I; who then took the principality of <hi>Wales</hi> into his hands, and
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:0181900402:465"/>
gave it to <hi>Edward</hi> II. his ſon, and made him prince of <hi>Wales.</hi> Since which time no more lordſhips marchers could be erected; for the <hi>Welſh</hi> in general ſubmitted themſelves to the kings of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since the principality came to the kings of <hi>England,</hi> no lord marcher could claim any liberty or prerogative, more than they had before, without a grant.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Edward</hi> I. immediately held a parliament at <hi>Ruthlan</hi> caſtle; and there ordained laws and officers, to govern <hi>Wales</hi> after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> manner.</p>
               <p>The lordſhip of <hi>Powŷs</hi> had not its original from conqueſt:, as the lordſhips marchers had; but in this manner:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Griffith,</hi> ſon of <hi>Meredith ap Blethyn,</hi> lord of <hi>Powŷs,</hi> ſeeing the king of <hi>England,</hi> and <hi>Engliſh</hi> lords, preparing themſelves to conquer <hi>Wales,</hi> did, in diſcretion and policy, ſubmit himſelf to <hi>Henry</hi> I. and yielded to hold his lordſhip of the king of <hi>England</hi> in chief, as the lords marchers did, and to do the king the like ſervice; and thereupon was ſuffered to hold the ſame to him and his heirs; and was created lord <hi>Powŷs</hi> by the ſaid <hi>Henry</hi> I. and made baron of the parliament of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His deſcendant, <hi>Hawŷs Gadarn,</hi> fell to be the king of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>'s ward, by reaſon of the alteration of the tenure in capite; who gave her in marriage to a valiant gentleman of his, named <hi>John Charlton.</hi> And ſo the lordſhip of <hi>Powŷs</hi> came to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> lords. (<hi>Mowthwy,</hi> and others, did the ſame). Theſe (with the lords marchers) held their lordſhips of the kings in chief, and not of the princes of <hi>Wales.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The lord of <hi>Powŷs</hi> thus ſubmitting himſelf to the king of <hi>England,</hi> the comots in that lordſhip continue whole and entire
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:0181900402:466"/>
to this day; and there is a court baron in every one of them, But the lords marchers, to reward thoſe that aſſiſted them in their conqueſts, gave them divers manors; and ſo divided the comots into ſeveral parts, and erected a court-baron in each. The comots were ſix; <hi>Carcinion, Mechan uwch-Coed, Mechan is-Coed, Mochnant, Llannerch-hûdol,</hi> and <hi>Yſtrad-marchell.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The like may be found in the counties of <hi>Angleſey, Caernar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>von, Merioneth, Flint, Carmarthen,</hi> and <hi>Cardigan;</hi> where the antient comots remain entire, without alteration; and retain their antient names and bounds, and keep the ſame courts. The reaſon is, becauſe they were not conquered by the lords marchers, but continued in the hands of the princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> till <hi>Llewellin,</hi> the laſt prince, was ſlain by <hi>Edward</hi> I.</p>
               <p>It appears by antient record, that the lordſhip of <hi>Bromefield</hi> and <hi>Yale,</hi> antiently called <hi>Dinas Brân,</hi> being the chief caſtle of the lordſhip, came to the poſſeſſion of <hi>Engliſh</hi> lords, as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Emma,</hi> daughter to Lord <hi>Audley,</hi> and widow to <hi>Griffith ap Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dog,</hi> lord of <hi>Bromefield</hi> and <hi>Yale, Chirk, Nantheudwŷ, Maelor,</hi> and other lands, parcel of antient <hi>Powŷs</hi> having four ſons, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween whom their father's inheritance was divided; ſtrife grew between her and her huſband's kindred about the cuſtody of her ſons: they fearing, that if the ſons ſhould be brought up by the mother in <hi>England,</hi> they would become <hi>Engliſh;</hi> and rather incline to the king of <hi>England,</hi> than to the princes of <hi>Wales.</hi> But the mother getting into her poſſeſſion the two eldeſt, <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dog</hi> and <hi>Llewellin;</hi> the firſt having to his part <hi>Bromefield</hi> and <hi>Yale,</hi> and the other, <hi>Chirk</hi> and <hi>Nantheubwŷ;</hi> and not being
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:0181900402:467"/>
able to keep them to herſelf, nor to remain in quiet upon her jointure, ſhe delivered her ſons to <hi>Edward</hi> I. ſhewing that by right they were his wards, becauſe their anceſtors had formerly made their ſubmiſſion to the kings of <hi>England.</hi> The king took them to his ward; and committed <hi>Madog,</hi> the eldeſt, to the care of <hi>John</hi> earl <hi>Warren;</hi> and <hi>Llewellin</hi> to <hi>Roger Mortimer,</hi> third ſon to <hi>Ralph</hi> Lord <hi>Mortimer,</hi> of <hi>Wigmore.</hi> The two guardians having the ſons and their lands in their cuſtody, Earl <hi>Warren</hi> built the caſtle of <hi>Holt</hi> in <hi>Bromefield,</hi> and <hi>Roger Morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> the caſtle of <hi>Chirk,</hi> and placed garriſons of <hi>Engliſh</hi> in each, to defend the country from the <hi>Welſh.</hi> And the wards dying ſhortly after, without iſſue, the ſaid guardians ſtill kept the lands, and obtained grants of the king to hold the ſame, 10th of <hi>Edward</hi> I; only the caſtle of <hi>Hope,</hi> and lands thereto belonging, were reſerved to the king in Earl <hi>Warren</hi>'s grant. The antient rent of <hi>Bromefield</hi> and <hi>Yale,</hi> was 730<hi>l.</hi> a year.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Emma</hi> being moleſted in her jointure, becauſe ſhe had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered her ſons to the king, and ſo procured the coming of thoſe lords to build the caſtles of <hi>Bromefield</hi> and <hi>Chirk,</hi> ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the king to take <hi>Maelor,</hi> her jointure, and to give her lands in <hi>England</hi> for it; which the king did, and ſo got into, poſſeſſion of <hi>Maelor Saeſnaeg,</hi> and held the ſame ever after; not ſuffering any of the heirs to have it, pretending that they were rebels againſt him.</p>
               <p>No lord marcher without a caſtle, and a ſufficient garriſon to ſuppreſs ſuch of the <hi>Welſh</hi> as ſhould annoy the king's ſubjects; and therefore all caſtles had towns cloſe to them, inhabited by the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> And, by 4 <hi>Henry</hi> IV. c. 32, it is enacted, that
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:0181900402:468"/>
caſtles and walled towns in <hi>Wales</hi> ſhould be poſſeſſed by valiant <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> ſtrangers to the ſeigniories.</p>
               <p>The charters of thoſe towns give great liberty to the <hi>Engliſh;</hi> but no <hi>Welſhman</hi> might be a burgeſs, or purchaſe any land therein; ſee 2 <hi>Henry</hi> IV. c. 12. and 20. It was alſo enacted, that no <hi>Welſhman</hi> ſhould have any caſtle or fortreſs, ſaving ſuch as was in the time of <hi>Edward</hi> I. except biſhops and temporal lords.</p>
               <p>The more to encourage the <hi>Engliſh</hi> to conquer <hi>Wales</hi> the kings of <hi>England</hi> created them peers of the realm, by the name of lords baron of the places they conquered. Their number once was twenty-one; but now are reduced to one, <hi>viz. Aber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaveny,</hi> who is the firſt lord baron of <hi>England.</hi> The reſt loſt their name and place, by coming either to the crown, or to lords who had other places and titles in parliament. The caſtles in <hi>Wales</hi> were about 143.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Welſh</hi> ſubmitted to <hi>Henry</hi> VII. becauſe he was paternally deſcended from their princes: and his ſon, <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. made ſeveral ſtatutes for the future government of them, anno 27.</p>
               <p>Lords marchers ſeized on the goods of their tenants, who died inteſtate.</p>
               <p>All the lordſhips marchers have loſt their antient juriſdictions and authorities, which were the common ſigns whereby they were known; ſo that it is now a doubt which were ſuch lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips. But they may ſtill be known by ſeveral tokens.</p>
               <list>

3. It muſt have been in antient time the inheritance of ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> lord.</item>
                  <item>4. If any ſuit aroſe about the title, it was to be pleaded at common law, in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall;</hi> and there were fines levied of thoſe lordſhips, and none other in <hi>Wales.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. The eſcheator of the marches of <hi>Wales</hi> did in antient time inquire of the tenure, and find <hi>office poſt mortem</hi> of the lord; and that by writ out of the chancery of <hi>England.</hi> And as thoſe lordſhips were not in any ſhire in <hi>England,</hi> and the king had no eſcheators to enquire of the tenure of them, the ſame was laid on the eſcheator of the next <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſhire. And ſuch eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheators had the charge, care, and ſurvey of all lordſhips marches that were holden of the king. And ſuch eſcheator was to go into any lordſhip marcher in <hi>Wales,</hi> and ſwear an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and find an office after the death of the lord, and inquire of the tenure and value of the lordſhip.—N. B. All offices of other manors, that were holden of the king, as of his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality, were found, by virtue of writs out of the king's ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer, of <hi>Caernarvon,</hi> or <hi>Cheſter,</hi> for <hi>North Wales;</hi> and <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marthen,</hi> or <hi>Cardigan,</hi> for <hi>South Wales;</hi> and out of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> for lands in that earldom.</item>

                  <pb n="441" facs="tcp:0181900402:470"/>From the river <hi>Tifi,</hi> in <hi>South Wales,</hi> to the river <hi>Conwy,</hi> in <hi>North Wales,</hi> there was no lordſhip marcher; but all that coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try remained wholly to the princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> until the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pality came to the crown by Prince <hi>Llewellin</hi>'s death.</p>
               <p>As the river <hi>Severn</hi> was the antient limit between <hi>Wales</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> a doubt hath ariſen, why all the land that is over that river, <hi>viz.</hi> all <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> and ſo much as is part of <hi>Glouceſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Worceſterſhire,</hi> and <hi>Shropſhire,</hi> had not been lordſhips marchers, as the reſt of <hi>Wales</hi> was, that was won ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt.</p>
               <p>The reaſon is this: All <hi>Herefordſhire,</hi> and thoſe parts of the other counties, were won from the <hi>Welſh</hi> in, or ſhortly after, the time of <hi>Offa</hi> king of <hi>Mercia.</hi> The <hi>Welſh</hi> were expelled thence, the country was new planted with <hi>Engliſhmen;</hi> and this was long before the dividing of <hi>England</hi> into ſhires. The ſame was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the kingdom of <hi>Mercia;</hi> and ſo, as part of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it came to the hands of king <hi>Alfred,</hi> who firſt divided <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> into ſhires. He finding thoſe countries ſubdued, and the <hi>Welſh</hi> expelled, divided them with the reſt on the other ſide <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern.</hi> He added part to <hi>Glouceſterſhire,</hi> part to <hi>Worceſterſhire,</hi> and part to <hi>Shropſhire;</hi> and made <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> a ſhire of itſelf.</p>
               <p>Here lies the difference between conquering of <hi>Wales</hi> by the <hi>Saxons</hi> and the <hi>Normans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So much of <hi>Wales</hi> as the <hi>Saxon</hi> kings won, they did it at their own charge, and for their own uſe; and did not ſuffer their ſubjects to deal therein. But the <hi>Norman</hi> conqueror, content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf with the realm of <hi>England,</hi> did not bend his forces againſt <hi>Wales</hi> more than he was forced to do, by their invading of his people and country; and he, and his ſucceſſors, thought
<pb n="442" facs="tcp:0181900402:471"/>
it better policy to give to the nobility ſuch parts of <hi>Wales</hi> as they could conquer.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Herefordſhire</hi> was not won ſince the Conqueſt, appears from the lordſhip of <hi>Urchinfield;</hi> which is antient demeſne-lands; ſuch as is not to be found in <hi>England,</hi> but what was in the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of its kings before the Conqueſt. See <hi>Silas Taylor,</hi> of <hi>Urchinfield,</hi> in his Hiſtory of Gavelkind, p. 106: and <hi>Humphrey Lhwyd,</hi> in his Fragment of the Deſcription of <hi>Wales;</hi> his <hi>Latin</hi> book, p. 52, firſt edition; <hi>Engliſh</hi> tranſlation, p. 63: whoſe words, as <hi>Bryan Twyne</hi> tranſlates, are, <hi>Gwŷr Reunwe</hi> makes one of the ſix ſtates, that met at the mouth of the river <hi>Dyvi,</hi> to chuſe <hi>Maelgwyn Gwynedd</hi> king, about the year 560.

               <p>The ſame king, in the ſame year, writes to thoſe lords, to abate a certain number of their men; becauſe he did not want them.</p>

                  <p>This ſtate of <hi>France</hi> is in diviſion with ytſelfe; for certain of the princes are diſcontentedly retyred to their governments; where they fortify themſelves in the ſtrongeſt cytties. Thoſe
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:0181900402:488"/>
of them who want place of importance in their own countrey, joyn with the reſt to make good the hould they fynd fitt to make reſiſtance: and ſo many are joyned togeather in <hi>Champaigne,</hi> being the government of the duke of <hi>Nevers,</hi> who alſo is one of the number. But the cheife of all is the prince of <hi>Conde,</hi> with whom alſo is the duke of <hi>Vendoſme,</hi> baſtard ſon to the late king of <hi>France;</hi> who not longe ſince was comitted to pryſon; but finding that opportunite to ſhift him ſelf into the habit of a ſcullion, he eſcaped, and put himſelfe into the companie of, the malecontents, being in number about ſix or 7 dukes, beſides others, aſſembled togeather, upon there garde, in the cytty of <hi>Miſiers</hi> and <hi>Cedan,</hi> upon the borders of the Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, being frontyre towns of <hi>Champaign.</hi> Whence the prince of <hi>Conde</hi> writt to the king and queen, ſhewing the cauſe of his retyrednes, ſo far as touched himſelfe, being, as he ſayed, out of the care he had of the king and kingdome, to reform the one, and give contentment to the other; which could not be don without the aſſembly of the ſtates, which he earneſtly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, principally to abridge the extream taxations of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; to purge the kingdome of the unneceſſarie offices, who ſerved to no other uſe than to impoveriſh the people; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all to forbear to proceed in the marriadge between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spayn,</hi> untyll the aſſembly of the eſtates wear diſſolved, leaſt any thinge ſhould be concluded to the pjudice of thoſe of the reformed religion. The lre was well written, and carried with yt a ſhewe of great good to the comon wealth; but the people are ſo fearfull of the name of civil warre, that very fewe ſtirr of the parte of the princes. It is very true that the prince of <hi>Conde</hi> was drawn into the number by ſome other of the dukes,
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:0181900402:489"/>
and not out of any juſt cauſe that he hath of diſcontent, more then for the love of ſome of them who he wo<hi rend="sup">d</hi> protect.</p>
                  <p>Thèr ys watch and ward in all towns, and good order for proviſion of arms, whereof ther ys no want in theſe partes.</p>
                  <p>The queen maketh great preparation to go to meete the king of <hi>Spayn,</hi> to conclude the marriage, notwithſtandinge the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſte the princes have of that proceedinge.</p>
                  <p>The report hear ys, that the princes will ſubmit themſelves to the kings mercie, and will offer themſelves to attende the kinge to his marriage; but how that will prove, ys uncertain: for they fortifie themſelves daylie; and, while they ſpeake of peace, they prepare for warre. But that w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> will turn to there miſchife ys the want of money, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> all knowe; otherwiſe they are well ſeated to do the kinge a ſhrewd turne. Theſe ſturrs in <hi>France</hi> cauſeth the kingdome to be more difficult for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaile, and maketh many ſtrangers remove to other countreys; myſelf amonge the reſt am reſolved of my remove, with as much ſpeed as I may, to <hi>Savoy,</hi> and ſo to <hi>Pie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mont,</hi> and to ſee ſome part of <hi>Lombardie,</hi> before the extreamitie of the heate.

The next morninge I ſawe the caſtle Of <hi>Bourbon,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ys extroardinarie well ſeated for ſtrength, and adorned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in with a very fayr chappell, beinge on of the rareſt pieces Of worke Of <hi>France;</hi> within w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> there ys a piece of the very true croſſe of our Saviour (if wee may give credit to them that have the keepinge thereof) w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> was brought from <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> By St. <hi>Clovis,</hi> king Of <hi>France,</hi> with on of the thorns of the crown Of our Saviour, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> marvilouſlie doth flowr upon the Paſſion day, between nine and ten of the clock; and after 10 doth vaniſh away. I wo<hi rend="sup">d</hi> upon that day have gone to ſee yt, but I found

all men at there devotion; ſo that non wo<hi rend="sup">d</hi> travaile that day. I doubt nothinge of the omnipotencie of the Almightie, who hath made all things of nothinge; but I make queſtion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuperſtitious obſervations of theſe Papiſts, who have often belyed God, attributinge to reliks more then to God. This thorn is incloſed in chriſtall within the ſame that the croſſe ys, beinge all ſet in gould, with works of imagerie, contayninge the paſſion of our Saviour; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the houldinge in your hand, the bud appeareth at that tyme of the day, upon Good Fryday, remayneth on flowr, and ſo vaniſheth.</p>
                  <p>From thence to <hi>Lyons,</hi> where I contynued a week; and ſo by water I voyaged to <hi>Avignon,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ys belonging to the Pope: where entring into the town, I was demanded by the gard at the gate, whence I was, and of what religion? Where havinge related all things, according to there demand, I was lett paſſe towarde my lodginge, beinge ſomewhat melancholick, becauſe I ſuppoſed that I ſho<hi rend="sup">d</hi> not have that libertie to ſee all places in that towne, as I deſired; but havinge encountred with a <hi>French</hi> lord of that country, of whom I inquired whether I might freely ſee all places in town; who uſed me with that extroar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarie kindneſs, that being invited to ſupper that night, he ſpeake of me to the cardinal, being vice-legat; and the next morninge brought me to the cardinal, who was returned from maſſe;, having a hundred gentlemen well appointed, who in ranke went before him, by three and by three, until the pallaiſie; my ſelfe coming by with that lord, I was ſaluted by the legat, and honorably entertayned with many good words, tellinge me that yt was not lawfull for thoſe of our religion to remayne above, three dayes; but for me, I might ſtay as longe as I wo<hi rend="sup">d</hi>—
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:0181900402:492"/>
with many other circumſtances of love and curteſie; enjoyninge that I<hi rend="sup">d</hi> to ſhewe me all places in town, and principally to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct me to ſee a companie at a gentlemans houſe, who wear ready to maſke and dance, in honour of a babtiſme, whereunto the cardinals brother was intreated as godfather. In ende, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge after dinner at the church, to ſee the manner of yt, though I had before ſeen the like, behould a great number of violens and muſitiens came marching before the godfather, who brought the child upon his arme (accordinge to the <hi>French</hi> manner) to the church; and then the ladies and gentlewomen accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inge the godmother entred, and ſo they went to the ceremonie; my ſelfe went amonge the reſt, and ſtood by to hear and ſee what they did: which ſome gentlemen perceivinge, who had taken notice of me in the morninge, demanded of me how I liked of the ceremonie? I ſayd well. And whether there wear great difference between the <hi>Engliſh</hi> manner and that of <hi>France</hi> for the babtiſme? I anſwered, for that I had ſeen that they differed from us. I was further preſſed by thoſe gent, whether yt pleaſed me to ſee the manner of yt or not? I ſayd yea; but that I co<hi rend="sup">d</hi> not enter for the preſſe. Then the gent made me place, and brought me cloſe to the place; where, in interpretinge unto me the manner of all circumſtances, he was louder than the curit who babtized the child. When all was done, the godfather kiſſed the godmother openlie in the church. The companie, being many that came about me, ſeeing I was a ſtranger, to hear what the other gent and I diſcourſed of. I was aſked by the parent of the child, in what ſort we differed in <hi>England</hi> from the manner of <hi>France</hi> in babtiſme? I anſwered, that our children wear not ſo well fed, before they received babtiſme,
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:0181900402:493"/>
as this child was. The gent fell all to a laughter; for indeed the child was ſo ould that he was almoſt ready to goe, and had ſuch a broad face, that all the companie were made merry with the mouths the child made at the preiſt, duringe the time he was uſing his office. The gent tould me that yt was the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in theſe countreys alſo to chriſten them when they wear 4 or 5 dayes ould; but for this, the godfather beinge in <hi>Italy,</hi> they wear conſtrained to ſtay till his return. After the babtiſme I was offered all the curteſie that I could deſire. And ſo I went to <hi>Aix,</hi> being the parliment of <hi>Provence,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Marſelles,</hi> where I now am. From hence to <hi>Nezi,</hi> beinge the duke of <hi>Savoys</hi> countrey; and from thence to <hi>Genua;</hi> and thence to <hi>Lucca;</hi> and ſo to <hi>Florence,</hi> w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ys 500 miles hence: where I ſhall not have ſo much money as will conduct me fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but only what will maintayn me untill I receive money from <hi>England,</hi> which I humbly entreat you to uſe means to ſend me my <hi>Michaelmas</hi> rent. Have patience with me, if I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinewe a little longer then you wo<hi rend="sup">d</hi>; I do yt for my experience, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> I wo<hi rend="sup">d</hi> gayne, if I may, as well as others; but without tyme, a man can do but what he can. I hope you would not that I ſhould be leſs ſufficient then other gent, who ſeeke out ther experience by the ſame means that I doe. I hope that yt ſhall not repent you anythinge of the courſe I have taken, no more then yt doth me. God ſend you your health, and my mother hers; and make both of you partakers of my prayers!</p>

               <p>SIR <hi>Rich<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Bulkeley</hi> ſerved in parl<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for the county of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> the 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> and 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> ſeſſions of Q. <hi>Mary,</hi> the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and 1<hi rend="sup">st</hi> of <hi>James.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was of goodly perſon, fair of complexion, and tall of ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He was temperate in his dyet, not drinking of healths. In his habit, he never changed his faſhion; but always wore round breeches, and thick bumbaſt doublets, though very gallant and
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:0181900402:496"/>
rich. In the laſt year of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> being then ſomewhat ſtricken in years, he attended the counſil of marches at <hi>Ludlow,</hi> in winter-time. When the lord preſident <hi>Zouch</hi> went in his coach to church, or elſewhere, Sir <hi>Richard</hi> uſed to ride on a great ſtone horſe; and ſome time he wo<hi rend="sup">d</hi> go from his lodging to church, in froſt and ſnow, on foot, with a ſhort cloak, ſilk ſtockings, a great rapier and dagger, tarry all prayers and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in very cold weather; inſomuch y<hi rend="sup">r</hi> L<hi rend="sup">d</hi> 
                  <hi>Zouch</hi> was wont to ſay, he was cold to ſee him.</p>
               <p>He was a great reader of hiſtory, and diſcourſes of all eſtates and countries; of very good memory; and underſtanding in matters belonging to houſekeeping, huſbandry, maritime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fayres, building of ſhips, and maintaining them at ſea. He drew his own letters, and anſwered all letters with his own hand: and being complayned of at the counſil of the marches for breach of an order of that court, he drew his own anſwer— that he co<hi rend="sup">d</hi> not be evicted out of his poſſeſſion but by courſe of common law—pleaded <hi>Magna Charta</hi>—and demanded judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: which anſwer being put into court, the chief juſtice, Sir <hi>Richard Shuttleworth,</hi> called for a ſight thereof; and after pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſal, ſaid to the counſellors at the bar, <q>Look, my maſters, what a bone S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                     <hi>Rich<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Bulkeley</hi> hath caſt into the court, for you to tire upon:</q> and the matter being argued, it was, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the com<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>on law.</p>
               <p>He was a great houſekeeper, and entertainer of ſtrangers, eſpecially ſuch as paſſed to or from <hi>Ireland.</hi> He nobly enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> in his way there, to be lord lieuten<hi rend="sup">t</hi>. He made proviſion of all neceſſaries for his table beforehand. He ſent yearly two ſhips to <hi>Greenland</hi> for cod, ling, and other
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:0181900402:497"/>
fiſh; which he did uſe to barter in <hi>Spain</hi> for <hi>Malaga</hi> and ſherrie wines; and always kept a good ſtocke of old ſack in his cellar, which he called <hi>Amabile,</hi> beſides other wines. He kept two parks well ſtored with Red and Fallow Deer; w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> did afford ſuch plenty of veniſon, as furniſhed his table 3 or 4 times every week in the ſeaſon, beſides pleaſuring of friends. He kept ſeveral farms, beſides his demeſne, in his hands, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed his houſe with fat beef, mutton, lamb, &amp;c. &amp;c. He was an excellent horſeman, and an expert tilter; keeping two great ſtables of horſes, one in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and another in <hi>Beaumaris,</hi> and a great ſtudd of mares. His eſtate in <hi>Angleſey</hi> was £. 2500, in <hi>Carnarvonſhire</hi> £. 800, and in <hi>Cheſhire</hi> £. 1000, a year: having always a great ſtock of ready money lying in his cheſt. He kept many ſervants and attendants, tall and proper men: two lacqueys in livery always ran by his horſe: he never went from home without 20 or 24 to attend him. He was a great favo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> He had powerful freinds at court, and had the gentry and commonalty of the county of <hi>Angleſey</hi> at his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, except the <hi>Woods</hi> of <hi>Rhoſmore,</hi> who were always his ennemies.</p>
               <p>He had great conteſts with <hi>Dudley</hi> earl of <hi>Leiceſter;</hi> who ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tayned the queens letters patents under the great ſeal, to be chief ranger of the forreſt of <hi>Snowdon:</hi> in which office he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved very injuriouſly to the counties of <hi>Merioneth, Carnarvon,</hi> and <hi>Angleſey;</hi> attempting to bring within the bounds and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of that forreſt moſt of the freeholders lands in thoſe 3 counties; and for that purpoſe the earl procured ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions from the queen to inquire of encroachments and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealments of lands. The return of the jury, in <hi>Angleſey,</hi> not
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:0181900402:498"/>
being agreeable to the earls commiſſioners, they went in a rage to <hi>Carnarvon,</hi> forcibly entered the exchequer there, ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacked the records, and carried away what they pleaſed; but the earl, after making many attempts, to the great grievance of the country, was obliged to deſiſt, being defeated in all ſchemes upon <hi>Snowdon,</hi> by the power and intereſt and ſpirit of Sir <hi>Rich<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Bulkeley.</hi> But, <hi>manet alta mente repoſtum,</hi> the earl bore a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonous hatred to Sir <hi>Rich<hi rend="sup">d</hi>;</hi> yet he continued ſtill in favor with the queen and counſel, though often moleſted by the earl, his agents and creatures.</p>
               <p>S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Richard</hi> being one of the deputy lewtenants of <hi>Angleſey,</hi> (upon intelligence of the <hi>Spaniſh Armadas</hi> threatening <hi>England</hi>) was to ceſſe the country in arms; and ceſſing Mr. <hi>Woods</hi> of <hi>Rhoſmore,</hi> he was highly offended, and thought himſelf too heavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loaden: therefore went up to court to the earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> carrying a falſe tale with him, that Sir <hi>Richard Bulkeley</hi> (a little before the attainder and execution of <hi>Tho<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Saluſbury,</hi> one of the accomplices of <hi>Anth<hi rend="sup">y</hi> Babington,</hi> the traytor, 1585) had been in the mountains of <hi>Snowdon</hi> conferring with him, and that at a farm of Sir <hi>Richards,</hi> called <hi>Cwmligie,</hi> they had layne together two or 3 nights. The earl, glad of this information, preſently acquaints the queen and council therewith. Sir <hi>Richard</hi> being called before the council, and examined, abſolutely denied the whole matter. And when the earl, at y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> time preſident of the queens counſil, did ſeverely inforce it ag<hi rend="sup">t</hi> him, he told the earl to his face, "Your father, and the very ſame men as now informe againſt me, were like to undoe my father; for, upon the death of K. <hi>Edw.</hi> 6, by letters from your father, he was commanded to proclayme Queen <hi>Jane,</hi> and to muſter the
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:0181900402:499"/>
country; which he did accordingly: and had not my mother been one of Queen <hi>Maries</hi> maids of honor, he had come to great trouble and danger." Hearing theſe words, the counſil huſhed, and roſe; and Sir <hi>Richard</hi> departed. The earl haſtened to the queen, and told her the counſil had been examining Sir <hi>Richard Bulkeley</hi> about matters of treaſon; that they found him a dangerous perſon, and ſaw cauſe to comit him to the Tower; and that he dwellt in a ſuſpicious corner of the world. "What! Sir <hi>Richard Bulkeley!"</hi> ſaid the queen; "he never intended us any harm. We have brought him up from a boy, and have had ſpecial tryal of his fidelity: you ſhall not comit him." "We," ſaid the earl, "have the care of your majeſtys perſon, ſee more and hear more of the man than you doe: he is of an aſpiring mind, and lives in a remote place." "Before God (replyed the queen) we will be ſworn upon the holy Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, he never intended us any harm;" and ſo ran to the Bible and kiſſed it, ſaying, "You ſhall not comitt him: we have brought him up from a boy." Then the lords of the counſill wrote a letter to D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Hugh Bellot,</hi> lord biſhop of <hi>Bangor,</hi> to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the truth of the accuſation layd to Sir <hi>Richards</hi> charge: which the biſhop found falſe and forged; and ſo certifyed to the counſil. Whereupon he was cleared, to the queens majeſtys great content, to the abundant joy of his country, and to his own great credit and reputation: and afterwards diverſe of the lords of the councell wrote letters to the juſtices of aſſize of <hi>North Wales,</hi> to publiſh Sir <hi>Richards</hi> wrongs, and to notify to the queens ſubjects his clear innocence.</p>
               <p>But that Sir <hi>Richard</hi> might not reſt in peace, one <hi>Green,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the earl of <hi>Leiceſter,</hi> in the name of one <hi>Bromfeild,</hi>
                  <pb n="471" facs="tcp:0181900402:500"/>
a penſioner, came to him, to challenge him to meet <hi>Bromfeild</hi> in the feild. "Have you no other errand (quoth Sir <hi>Richard?</hi>)" "No," ſays <hi>Green.</hi> Then S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Richard</hi> drew his dagger, and broke <hi>Greens</hi> pate, telling him to carry that as his anſwer; he ſcorning to meet ſuch a knave as <hi>Bromfeild.</hi> This treatment of <hi>Green</hi> highly encreaſed the anger of the Earl. <hi>Bromfeild, Green,</hi> and others of his retayners, plotted miſchief to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Sir <hi>Richard;</hi> but he ſtood upon his guard, keeping al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways 24 ſtout men, with ſwords, bucklers, and daggers, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend him from their attempts. They hired boats and wherries upon the <hi>Thames,</hi> with a deſign to drown Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> as he ſho<hi rend="sup">d</hi> go from <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> to <hi>London;</hi> but he, being privately informed thereof, borrowed the lord mayor of <hi>Londons</hi> barge, furniſhed it with men, muſquetts, billets, drums, and trumpets, and rowed along the <hi>Thames,</hi> ſhot the bridge, and went down to <hi>Greenwich,</hi> where the queen kept her court at that time; and at the landing place, over againſt the pallace, he cauſed his companie to diſcharge their muſquets, to beat their drums, and ſound their trumpets. The earl of <hi>Leyceſter</hi> hearing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, repaired to the queen, and informed her that Sir <hi>Richard Bulkeley,</hi> more like a rebel than a ſubject, had come with barges, men, muſquetts, drums, and trumpets; and had ſhot ſeveral pieces over againſt her majeſtys palace, to the great terror of her court; a matter not be ſuffered. The queen ſent for Sir <hi>Richard,</hi> and, after hearing his apology for himſelf, made the earl freinds with him. Within a while after, the earl ſent for S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Richard</hi> to his chamber; who coming thither, the earl began to expoſtulate with him on ſeveral wrongs and abuſes he pretended to have received at his hands; and that
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:0181900402:501"/>
he had loſt £. 10,000 by his oppoſition. But the diſcourſe end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in milder terms, and Sir <hi>Richard</hi> was bidden to dinner; but did eat or drink nothing, ſave of what he ſaw the earl taſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring Sir <hi>Nic<hi rend="sup">s</hi> Throgmorton,</hi> who was ſaid to have received a fig at his table.</p>
               <p>But the earl of <hi>Lyceſter</hi> dying in <hi>Oct<hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                  </hi> 1588, Sir <hi>Richard Bulkeley,</hi> and his country, enjoyed peace and quietneſs from his tyrannical oppreſſions, his devices and wicked practiſes: and Sir <hi>Richard</hi> ſurvived to the 28 <hi>June</hi> 1621, when he dyed, aged 88. He had attended the coronation of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> queens <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and of <hi>James</hi> the 1ſt. His cloak, at this laſt coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, coſt him £ .500.</p>

               <p>His ſcholarſhip being gone, upon his return from <hi>London</hi> I was bold to put him unto fellows commons, until, either in this or ſome other coll. I ſhall enquire out ſome fellowſhip for him; of the w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> preferment he ſhall not be capable until he be full bachelor of arts; and that will be <hi>Eaſter</hi> at ſooneſt. This re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of him to our commons, will be ſome ten pounds a year more chargeable unto you; but I do hold his choice of company (w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> now can be none but fellows and gentlemen) and his occaſion of hearing their diſcourſes, will, in your own judgment, countervail the charges: only this, for his entrance you are to beſtow a ſilver piece of plate upon the college, of what price you pleaſe, above 5 marks; and to engrave your arms thereupon: and that is all the charge of admiſſion.</p>
               <p>He ſhall not want an honourable place in commencing, ſince you are content to undergo the charges.</p>
               <p>I thank you, Sir, for your charges always with me. Your former ſo many courteſies, devoided of all requital of my ſide, might very well free your wor. from any future coſt that way. I have indeed with my proctorſhip light upon a moſt loving and reſpectful lord, my lord chancellor; who hath rather an indulgent fatherly care of my eſtate, than a lordly reſpect, as I have, by many immediate favors, lately taſted.</p>
               <p>It was likewiſe my good fortune, for I do not, I proteſt, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute it to any merit, to give his majeſty, and the prince, ſome extraordinary contentment at <hi>Newmarket</hi> upon <hi>Tueſday</hi>

laſt; what time, by appointment, I preach'd before them. I had a great deal of court holy water, if I can make myſelf any good thereby.</p>
               <p>I pray you, Sir, by <hi>Lent</hi> next, when your ſon is capable of a place, let there be ſome order taken, that the money you are willing to diſburſe for his place, be at <hi>London</hi> in ſome readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for me to call for; for <hi>magiſtri noſtri oculatas habent manus, credunt quod vident.</hi>

               </opener>
               <p>WITH the remembrance of my love and beſt affections unto you—Being very ſenſible of that great good will you have ever borne me, I thought it not unneceſſarie to take this courſe with you, which I have done with noe one other freynd in the worlde, as to deſire you to be noe more troubled with this late accident befallen unto me, than you ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand I am myſelfe. There is nothinge happened which I did not foreſee, and (ſithence the death of my dear maiſter) aſſuredlye expect; nor laye it in my power to prevent, otherwiſe than by the ſacrifiſinge of my poor eſtate, and that which I eſteeme farre above the ſame, my reputation. I knowe you love me to well, to wiſhe that I ſhold have been laviſhe of either of theſe, to continue longer (yeat noe longer then one man pleas'd) in this glorious miſerye and ſplendid ſlaverye, wherein I have lived (if a man maye call ſuch a toilinge a livinge) for theſe five years almoſt. By looſinge the ſeale, I have loſt nothinge, nor my ſervants, by any fault of myne; there beinge nothinge either layde, or ſoe much as whiſpered to my charge. If we have not the opportunitye we hadd before to ſerve the kinge, we have much more conveniencye to ſerve God; which I doe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:0181900402:505"/>
as the onelye end of Gods love and providence towards me, in this ſudden alteraltion.</p>
               <p>For your ſonne <hi>Owen Wynne</hi> (who, togeither with my debte, is all the object of my wordlye thoughts and cares) I will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme towards him all that he can have expected from me, if I live; and if I dye, I have performed it allreadye.</p>
               <p>You neede not feare any miſſe of me, beinge ſoe juſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in all your deſires and requeſts; havinge alſoe your eldeſt ſonne near the kinge, and of good reputation in the court, who can give you a good accompt of any thinge you ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend unto him.</p>
               <p>Hopinge therefore that I ſhall ever hold the ſame place I did in your love; which was firſt fixed on my perſon, not my late place, and which I will deſerve by all the freindlye and lovinge offices which ſhall lie in my power; I end with my prayer unto God for the continuance of your health; and doe reſt your very aſſured loveinge freynd, and cozen,</p>
