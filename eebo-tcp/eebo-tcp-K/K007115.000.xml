            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING lately met with as remarkable a Caſe in Medical Electricity, as perhaps has yet appeared in the World, I give myſelf the Pleaſure of ſending you an Account of it.</p>
               <p>In the Month of <hi>June,</hi> 1779, a young Perſon had the Misfortune to break her right Arm; which, as it was only a ſimple Fracture was eaſily reduced. But unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily the Bandage being made too tight, the Arm was ſoon invaded with a very ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Pain, which in about twenty-four Hours became intolerable. A Surgeon happening to paſs by the Houſe in which the Patient then was, was called in, who immediately cut open the Bandage; when
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1231401100:7"/>great Part of the Arm appeared to be in a gangrenous State, and a Mortification had actually begun at the Elbow. Theſe Symptoms however were without much Difficulty overcome by proper Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and the Cure of the Fracture went on very well; but from that Time the Uſe of the Arm was loſt. About three Months after this, the whole Arm and Hand began to waſte, and gradually became an Object too full of Diſtreſs, to be beheld without exciting the Emotions of Surpriſe and Compaſſion. A large and hard Knob was formed on the <hi>Fore-part</hi> of the Arm, a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle above the Bend of the Elbow; and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother on the <hi>Hinder-ſide,</hi> near the upper Head of the Shoulder-Bone. The Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture itſelf was near the Middle of the Bone. The whole Arm was ſo weak, that when it hung by her Side, ſhe was not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to raiſe it without the Aſſiſtance of the other: and when ſupported in an horizon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Poſture, the Wriſt fell as in a Palſy. The Fingers were drawn backwards to ſuch a Degree, that the Heads of the Finger-bones were forced out of the Sockets, where they join to the Palm of the Hand. At the ſame Time the other Joints of all the Fingers were contracted forwards, ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1231401100:8"/>that the Hand could not be opened or ſhut; and according to her own Expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>looked more like a Bird's Claw than a Hand.</hi> Both the Hand and Arm were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt void of Senſation, except of an obtuſe Pain at Times with a pricking Numbneſs, and ſo emaciated as to become a meer Ske<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leton. Every Application of Baths, Lini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Fomentations, Cataplaſms, &amp;c. &amp;c. was tried without the leaſt Appearance of Succeſs; but it was obſerved that thoſe of the aſtringent Kind, ſeemed to be moſt injurious: and the Calamity was much heightened by the melancholy Proſpect of it's growing continually worſe; to which was added, the Mortification of the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent's being aſſured, that if ſhe did not find Relief in a very little Time, ſhe would have a compleatly withered Arm. In this deplorable Situation ſhe remained at the Beginning of <hi>March,</hi> 1780; when the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon under whoſe Care ſhe was, adviſed her to try the Effect of ELECTRICITY: adding, that he was thoroughly perſwaded, that nothing within the Practice of Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry could poſſibly be of any Service to her. On this ſhe went to <hi>London,</hi> and after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting ſeveral Surgeons (ſome of whom very earneſtly recommended it, and others
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1231401100:9"/>as earneſtly diſſuaded her from it,) at length determined to put herſelf under the Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mr. LONG, of <hi>Little Compton Street, Soho;</hi> an experienced Practitioner, who has made Medical Electricity great Part of his Study and Employment for many Years. This Gentleman candidly told her, that her Caſe appeared ſo bad, that he could not give her any great Hopes of Succeſs; that ſhe might try if ſhe pleaſed, <hi>but if ſhe ſhould receive Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit, it would be next to a Miracle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Willing to try, though in a Manner without Hope, about the latter End of the ſame Month, ſhe began to enter on a Courſe. At firſt the Operation was carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on very gently, as by drawing the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectric Stream, ſmall Sparks, and ſlight Shocks, which were attended with no viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Alteration. The Operator then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to electrify more ſharply, after which ſhe ſoon began to find ſome ſmall Signs of Relief. Thus ſhe went on for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix Months, continuing to be electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied every Day, Sundays excepted. The Method in general was, to draw Sparks with a large and powerful Machine on one Day, and to give ſtrong Shocks another Day; both which were continued as long
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1231401100:10"/>as the Patient could well endure it. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine how ſtrong the Shocks were, but by the Patient's own Deſcription, ſome of them might be from a three-pint or two-quart Jar full charged. Sometimes the Number of Shocks amounted to one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty, and even to two hundred, ſo inſenſible was the Arm at that Time. They were however ſufficient in Number and Strength, to make the whole Limb ſwell exceedingly. The Effect was, a ſlow Improvement of the Senſation, Uſe, and Strength of the Limb; inſomuch; that by <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> 1780, her Condition was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come quite happy, in Compariſon of what it had been. She could now lift the Arm without Aſſiſtance, move the Elbow and Wriſt, and had ſome Power of moving the Fingers. The Heads of the Finger-bones were reduced into their Sockets; but the Hand remained about half open; without the Ability of extending or clenching the Fingers. The fleſhy Parts of the Arm were viſibly increaſed in Bulk, as were thoſe of the Hand, though in a leſs Degree. At this Time her Affairs calling her into the Country, the Electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication was diſcontinued until about the Middle of <hi>January,</hi> 1781; when the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1231401100:11"/>came into my Neighbourhood on a Viſit to a Relation, and being within a convenient Diſtance of my Houſe, an Opportunity preſented itſelf for carrying on the Operation; which I have endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to perform, in the ſame Manner as it was practiſed in <hi>London,</hi> as near as I can collect from the Patient's Account. It is now about ſix Weeks ſince I began, and I have the Satisfaction of perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Arm, and eſpecially the Hand, improved in a Degree that has exceeded my warmeſt Expectation. The Power of clenching and extending the Fingers is wonderfully increaſed, and the whole Limb better covered with Fleſh. About a Week ago, the Muſcles on the Back of the Arm were (upon moving the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers) obſerved, for the firſt Time, to work under the Skin; and ſhe now began to make a feeble Uſe of her Needle, to lace her Stays, and dreſs her Head: and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in a pleaſing Expectation of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving further Benefit, from the Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the ſame Means that have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been ſo ſucceſsfully applied.</p>
               <p>From the aforementioned Appearances (particularly the Waſting of the Limb) may we not conclude, that not only the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1231401100:12"/>Muſcles and Tendons of the <hi>Os Humeri,</hi> but alſo the great Nerve itſelf was injur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; eſpecially if it be conſidered that the Patient is a Perſon of a very ſlender Make; her Arms being ſo exceeding ſmall, that it would require no violent Preſſure to injure every Muſcle, Tendon, and Nerve between the Skin and the Bone? There was undoubtedly a violent Tenſion of the Muſcles and Tendons, if not of the great Nerve itſelf, to which Electricity ſeems to be a Remedy peculiarly adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For my own Part, I never could perceive any great Benefit ariſing from it, unleſs there was Reaſon to ſuſpect ſomething of this Kind: and in Caſes of this Nature, I do not recollect a ſingle Inſtance in all my Practice, where it ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in affording more or leſs Relief. In a ſlight Burn or Scald, it is well known there is a Tenſion on the Skin; and I will venture to ſay, that Electricity pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applied will afford more immediate Eaſe to the Pain occaſioned thereby, than any thing contained in the whole Materia Medica.</p>

               <p>FROM the Date of the foregoing Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, till paſt the Middle of April follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the Patient, whoſe Caſe is related therein, continued the Electrification, with little or no Alteration to the afflicted Limb; the Weather being all that Time very dry, and the Wind North, or North-eaſt. But about the <hi>21ſt,</hi> or <hi>22nd,</hi> the Weather becoming of a Sudden re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably mild and ſoft, as remarkable and ſudden a Change was experienced by her, which exceedingly flattered our Hopes: the Numbneſs and pricking Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, which had never ceaſed from the Time the Misfortune happened, was now entirely gone off: but as the fine mild Weather did not laſt long, and the Wind returned into the North-eaſt, the diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Numbneſs returned with it; and has ever ſince continued in a greater or leſs Degree, in proportion as the Air has been more or leſs cold, ſharp, or dry.</p>
               <p>It is further obſervable, that the Limb during that Seaſon, and at Times ever ſince, has been more painful than when the Calamity was at the Worſt: for from <hi>Chriſtmas,</hi> 1779, till <hi>March,</hi> 1781, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the great Improvements made in the Summer of 1780, ſo great was its
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1231401100:14"/>Inſenſibility, that all Kinds of Weather were alike to it: at the ſame Time the Patient began to be more ſhy of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectric Stroke, which obliged us to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the Strength and Number of the Shocks. At the latter End of <hi>June,</hi> 1781, a free Perſpiration firſt appeared on the Hand and Fingers; and the Skin, which had hitherto wore a very ſhining Poliſh, began to look more like that of the other Hand. On the <hi>7th</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> we were agreeably ſurpriſed on diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Fingers to have a much greater Power of Extenſion than uſual; ſince which Time, nothing has happened that requires particular Deſcription. It is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſay in general, that the Limb continues improving in all Reſpects; that theſe Improvements are ſeldom obſerved to be regularly gradual, but appear moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on a ſudden; and after ſuch long In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, that we more than once began to deſpair of farther Succeſs: and that the Progreſs of the Cure is always very much advanced or retarded by good or bad Weather.</p>
               <p>That the Powers of Nature alone were not ſufficient to work ſuch wonderful Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, as I have deſcribed, appears
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1231401100:15"/>very plain from the State of the Arm be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> 1780, and the Middle of <hi>January,</hi> 1781; in which Space of Time, the Patient declares ſhe did not perceive the Arm grow better or worſe, during the Omiſſion of Electricity. That Omiſſion therefore ſeems to be a very fortunate Circumſtance, as it enables us to determine, with a great Degree of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, the vaſt Importance of Electricity in Medicine.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">O</seg>UR laſt Converſation, which turned chiefly on the different, and oppoſite Succeſs of Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity on contracted Limbs, has to me been a Subject of much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: and I am not without Hope that ſuch ſeemingly various Effects may be accounted for, without imputing any uncertainty to the Operation itſelf.</p>
               <p>We are to obſerve, that a Limb or Joint may become contracted from op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite Cauſes: either from a <hi>real Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> or <hi>morbid Contraction</hi> of a Muſcle, or from the <hi>mere Relaxation</hi> of its An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſt. The Conſideration of this Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence you well know to be of the utmoſt Importance in Practice; and it often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires great Skill and Attention to make the Diſtinction. If a Muſcle or Tendon be relaxed in any great Degree, its Anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt may, by its own natural contrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Power, ſhrink in ſuch a Manner, as to give the Limb a ſrightful Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance: and if this ſhould be miſtaken for
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1231401100:17"/>a Tenſion or unnatural Contraction, the Treatment will conſequently be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe one: and inſtead of Relief, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient will moſt probably find his Malady increaſed. Hence we may ſee why the ſame Method of Treatment ſhall ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſucceed, and ſometimes fail, in Caſes apparently the ſame: and alſo why Complaints ſeemingly different, ſhall of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten yield to the very ſame Medicines: and hence may ariſe that Uncertainty of Succeſs ſo frequently attributed to Electricity by thoſe who are no Friends to it. Electricity as well as other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, may be uſed contrary to the true Intention of Cure. There is how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever one happy Circumſtance attending it, viz. That if it ſhould happen to be uſed improperly (unleſs in a very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent Manner,) there is not ſo much Danger in it as may be imagined. A fair Proof of this, is that noted Caſe, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by divers Writers, of a Girl who had a Palſy in her right Arm, which was twice increaſed by electric Shocks, and as often reſtored to the State in which it was before Electrification. Now if we conſider Electricity as a Relaxer of the Solids; we may, I preſume, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1231401100:18"/>enough conclude the true State of that Caſe to be this. The firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was a Relaxation, conſequently the Electricity was ill applied. Yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, as the Accounts declare, the Shocks were pretty fevere, it did but a temporary Damage; for the Fibres, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though much injured before, had Elaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city ſufficient to recover their former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitated State. Whence we may infer, that in Caſes of Uncertainty, a moderate Degree of Electricity may, nay ſometimes ought to be applied, were it only to find out, whether the Diſtortion aroſe from an <hi>unnatural Tenſion</hi> of one Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, or <hi>an unnatural Diſtenſion of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> Hence alſo appears a Reaſon why, even in Caſes wherein Electricity is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applied, it can afford but a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary Relief: as in Perſons whoſe Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres are become habitually rigid, from the ſeveral Cauſes of Time, Heats, Colds, Labour, Strains, hard Drinking, &amp;c. &amp;c. In ſuch Subjects, nothing more than a temporary Relief can reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected; becauſe the dry, impervious Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres will inevitably return to their rigid State, for Want of that vital Warmth, and lubricating Moiſture which are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1231401100:19"/>to preſerve their Flexibility. But in young and healthy Perſons, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted ſhall be reſtored to their due Tone (provided the Injury be not too great,) of which there are many authen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Proofs. And it has often happened, that when the Injury has been too great to admit of a perfect Cure, a partial one has been obtained, which never relapſed; and this after the moſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved Remedies had been tried in vain. From all which I infer, that where there is already too great a Relaxation of the Solids, Electricity is at beſt but uſeleſs.</p>
               <p>Experience proves Electricity to be a great Promoter of the purulent Diſcharge in Iſſues, Bliſters, &amp;c. which Diſcharge ariſes from the Relaxation of the Mouths of the cuticular Veſſels, after the Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is deſtroyed: for otherwiſe, they diſcharge only a thin watery Humour, or rather no Moiſture at all. From whence it is plain, that Electricity ought not to be adminiſtred in Fluxes proceeding from Weakneſs, except (as ſometimes happens) there be a Tenſion on the injured Veſſels. Mr. CAVALLO obſerves, that before Flux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es diſcover any Signs of Amendment from Electricity, they appear to be increaſed.</p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1231401100:20"/>
               <p>BUT perhaps you will ſay, "If Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity be ſo efficacious in deſtroying Tenſions as is pretended, it ſhould ſeem to be a probable Means of Cure for ardent Fevers, Pleuriſies, inflammatory Rheumatiſms, and ſuch Kind of Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, in which there is a manifeſt Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the Veſſels."—But it ought to be conſidered, that in ſuch Caſes as theſe, there is ſomething more than <hi>bare Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> there is a <hi>latent Cauſe</hi> which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces and continues the Tenſion, and counteracts the Operation of the Electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city. Electricity will ſoon remove the Tenſion and Pain attending a ſlight Burn or Scald: here the Cauſe of the Tenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Pain, i. e. the Fire or ſcalding Liquor, has already ceaſed to act upon the affected Part; and the Cauſe being taken away, the Effect is ſoon made to ceaſe. On the other Hand, it can give little or no Relief in Bites or Stings of venemous Animals, ſo long as the Cauſe of the Tenſion and Pain, i. e. the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected Poiſon, remains. Indeed I cannot ſay, what a long continued Uſe of Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity might bring about, by relaxing the Capillaries and promoting Perſpiration, or the impeded Circulation: or how far
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1231401100:21"/>it may contribute to diſſolve the Viſcid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities of the Blood and Humours: but as ſuch tedious Operations are, in theſe Caſes, hardly practicable, on account of the Pain, Weakneſs, and Impatience of the Sick, it ſeems to be ſcarce worth our While to conſider much about it. My humble Opinion is, that ſuch Attempts would ſerve only to bring a very valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Acquiſition in Medicine into Diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute.</p>
               <p>In old callous Ulcers, Electricity is ſaid to have proved efficacious: in ſuch, I preſume, as were owing to too tight and continued Bandages, or other Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management, rather than a bad Habit of Body. But for the Reaſons given be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, I would not wiſh a Practitioner to riſk the Credit of his Art, by applying it to ſuch as ariſe from a Malignity of the Humours.</p>
               <p>It is alſo ſaid to be a good Remedy for ſore Throats; and I verily believe it may: but it muſt be for ſuch as ſpring from ſome recent Cauſe, (ſuch as ſudden Gold, &amp;c.) which may bring on a Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that may be removed before the Humours become vitiated.</p>
               <p>In like Manner, perhaps, it may be
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1231401100:22"/>of wonderful Service in preventing the excruciating Pains of the Rheumatiſm; I mean of the true, acute, inflammatory, rheumatic Fever; a Diſtemper which ſeems to have it's Beginning in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids; viz. a Tenſion cauſed by ſudden Cold, eſpecially after the Body has been much heated.—It has been obſerved by Men of great Skill, that this is a Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that ſeldom or never attacks any but thoſe who are otherwiſe ſound and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. And for my own Part, I doubt not, but that whoever is afflicted with it, might (if he paid due Attention) tell when, and how he contracted it. Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing this to be true, it is highly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable that, could the Tenſion of the Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres be removed before the Blood and Humours become inflamed, the Diſeaſe would be eradicated while in Embryo: for a little Experience might be ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to convince any one, of the great Power Electricity has to take off that Rigidity, ſo commonly felt after violent Exerciſe in a cold Air.</p>
               <p>So great a Streſs has of late been laid on drawing or throwing the electric Stream with Points, that Shocks, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:1231401100:23"/>Sparks, have been almoſt laid aſide as uſeleſs or dangerous. There are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly many Caſes in which gentle Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods are highly proper, and the rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Kinds of Treatment both painful and dangerous: as when the affected Part is very tender, ſuch as an Eye, Ear, &amp;c. alſo, if the Tenſion be ſlight, or eaſily removable, it is unneceſſary to torment the Patient with ſtrong Shocks, or even Sparks. But when the Tenſion is obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, and not ſituated in a tender Part, the Degree of Electricity ought to be proportioned thereto, as far as the Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent can bear it. There are certainly many Caſes, in which the very gentle Kinds of Electricity would ſignify little or nothing. I have often relieved very ſlight Burns or Scalds, by only drawing the Stream; but I had lately an Opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving that Method fail in a Scald that was ſomewhat ſevere: I drew the Stream a long Time to no Purpoſe; at length I proceeded to draw Sparks which ſoon had the deſired Effect. This Scald was ſo great, that a Bliſter aroſe before the Perſon who received it, could come to the Machine, although the Accident happened in the Houſe. Electricity in this Caſe, effected
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:1231401100:24"/>no other Cure than relieving the Pain: the Bliſter was healed as other Bliſters uſually are.</p>
               <p>A Perſon who lives in a neighbouring Pariſh, about a Year ago, broke his Leg, and was confined to his Bed eleven Weeks. The Fracture being a bad one, he was obliged to lie all that Time, in one Poſture; the Conſequence of which was, an <hi>Anchyloſis</hi> at the Knee of the ſame Leg; which continued for many Weeks after he left his Bed, without the leaſt perceiveable Alteration. As ſoon as he was able to ride, he was brought to me, and electrified twice every Day for a Fortnight. The Method I uſed was to draw Sparks, and give four or five moderate Shocks: i. e. from a pint Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al about one-third charged. The Succeſs anſwered our Expectation; every Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being attended with a viſible Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement, except one, wherein I pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely omitted the Shocks for the Sake of Experiment. At the End of the Fortnight, the Knee, which was at firſt nearly ſtraight, was become ſo flexible, that he could bring the Sole of his Foot to the Ground, while ſitting in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Chair. He has been with me three
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:1231401100:25"/>Times ſince, and not without more of leſs Improvement according to the State of the Weather, which I always found to be of great Importance towards a Cure. But the <hi>Grand Proof</hi> of the great Expediency, and even Neceſſity, of ſtrong Shocks in obſtinate Tenſions of the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Nerves and Tendons, was exhibited in the Caſe of the contracted Arm, of which I have already given you an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
               <p>IT has been ſaid by an eminent Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician, a Friend to Medical Electricity, That he never knew the Cure advance, after the Patient had undergone ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Times of Trial. With Submiſſion, I think, that either the Patients were not proper Subjects for Electrification; or that the Electrification was not ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued.</p>
               <p>If the Rigidity, Tenſion, &amp;c. be too ſtubborn to admit of a perfect Cure on the forementioned Number of Trials, the Practitioner may almoſt depend upon it, that he will not obſerve any farther Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement for a conſiderable Time; nay in ſome Caſes for many Weeks. Of this I have already produced a remarkable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1231401100:26"/>in the Patient, who is the Subject of my firſt Letter, and of whom I then took Notice, that the Improvements did by no Means proceed in a regular Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but by ſudden Fits or Starts. And indeed I muſt acknowledge, that had it not been for the Patient's amazing Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, which I ſometimes took for Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, the Affair had been long ago giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up. Something like this I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in another Caſe, but that already related is ſufficient. And here I deſire Leave to recommend one Thing to your ſerious Attention; viz. To conſider whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, under ſuch Circumſtances, it be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to continue, the Electrification con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly as a Preparative towards a farther Improvement: or, when it is found that the Part will ſuffer no greater Degree of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion for the Preſent, to let it reſt a While, that Nature may have Time to ſupply the new-ſtretched Fibres with Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, and ſit them for Diſtenſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. This is an Object of great Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; for if (as I am moſt inclined to believe) the Omiſſion be no Hindrance to the Progreſs of the Cure, it will be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py for thoſe Patients whoſe Occupations and Circumſtances, will not allow of a
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1231401100:27"/>long and conſtant Attendance, as well as for thoſe of all Degrees, who will in a great Meaſure be freed from ſuffering perpetually, a diſagreeable Senſation.</p>
               <p>From the foregoing Conſiderations we may diſcover the Reaſon why, even in Caſes to which Electricity is well adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it is more difficult to perfect a Cure, than to begin it; for at the firſt Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, when the Fibres are in the moſt ſtiff and rigid State, the inflating or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Power of the Electricity will have the greateſt Influence upon them; the Effects of which will naturally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, in proportion as the Fibres grow pliable: becauſe through their new-ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired Elaſticity, they will become capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of eluding the Force. A Smith, with a Stroke of his great Hammer or Sledge, can, without much Difficulty, bend or break a ſtiff iron Bar of conſiderable Size; but if the Bar be firſt made elaſtic, it will, in Proportion to the Degree of it's Elaſticity, require a greater Degree of Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence to produce the ſame Effect. Thus we may eaſily account for an Obſervation made by the Generality of Electricians; viz. <hi>That Electricity, if not unreaſonbly applied, never injures an healthy Fibre:</hi>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:1231401100:28"/>and alſo why it is injurious to ſuch, as through Weakneſs or Laxity, have loſt the Power of recovering their Tone. And hence we may conclude, that the farther the Cure of a Contraction, Tenſion, &amp;c. is advanced, the more ſlow will be it's fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Progreſs; and conſequently that the electric Force ought under ſuch Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, (provided the Patient's Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will bear it) to be rather increaſed than diminiſhed. But as the Patient's Senſibility always increaſes as the Fibres be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more elaſtic, it will, in many Caſes, require a large Share of Reſolution and Perſeverance to perfect the Cure, or even to make any conſiderable Advances to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards rendering it compleat.</p>
               <p>'THE Reaſon why ſome Sprains receive much Benefit from Electrization, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers none at all, but rather Injury, is, becauſe ſome are attended with Tenſions, others with Relaxation. Hence a Reaſon why the Cold Bath, and other Bracers, will Sometimes do much Good, and at other Times great Miſchief.—One Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, about a Year and a Half ago, the Servant Boy, who then lived with me, happened to ſprain his Wriſt: the Cure
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1231401100:29"/>was attempted by Pumping, which was continued till the Wriſt was greatly ſwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, with much Inflammation and Pain. As ſoon as I was informed of the Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I cauſed the Pumping to ceaſe, and directed the Hand and Wriſt to be bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in warm Water. After the Pain and Inflammation were, by theſe Means, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what abated, I electrified with Sparks and Shocks, which ſoon reduced the Swelling much more, and the Pain was now become very tolerable. The next Morning the Warm Bath and Electrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were repeated, and the Cure perfected. Here indeed I loſt a fine Opportunity of trying the Efficacy of Electricity alone; but I was, at that Time, hardly got in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Train of Thinking. It however ſerves to ſhew; that Electricity and the Warm Bath belong to the ſame Claſs; and that they may be ſucceſsfully uſed together. —I have alſo known Electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city fail of curing a Sprain. —A Perſon, wringing ſome Cloaths out of the Water, ſprained her Hand in ſuch a Manner, that on the Back of it there aroſe a ſmall Swelling, the ſame as is uſually called, the Springing or Starting of a Tendon. It was ſoft, and without Pain or Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1231401100:30"/>this was ſeveral Times electrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without Succeſs; but was ſoon after cured by the Cold Bath and a Bandage.</p>
               <p>Hence we may venture to conclude, that to Nervous Caſes in general, Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity does not ſeem to be well adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. So far indeed as weak Fibres are ſometimes liable to Tenſion, as well as ſtrong ones, it will (if judiciouſly admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered) be attended with great Probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Succeſs. But whoever expects E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectricity to ſtrengthen a weak Habit, will moſt certainly be deceived.</p>
               <p>The Degree of Electricity, proper to be adminiſtered at a Time, ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the Degree of Obſtinacy in the Tenſion, Contraction, &amp;c. — the Strength, Weakneſs or Tenderneſs of the Part affected—the Age, Strength, Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, &amp;c. of the Patient, conſidered to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; as in the Adminiſtration of other Medicines.</p>
               <p>From what has been advanced, the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Quaere will naturally ariſe,—"If Electricity be indeed injurious to Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or Laxity, how comes it to be of Service in a Palſy, the very Definition of which is, <hi>A lax Immobility of a Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle?"</hi> ANSW. Though a Palſy be a lax
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:1231401100:31"/>Immobility of a <hi>Muſcle,</hi> it frequently a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from Cauſes which aſtringe the <hi>Nerves;</hi> as Colds, aſtringent Aliments or Medicines, Ligatures, &amp;c. whence the Muſcles become lax and collapſed, and loſe the Power of Motion, from the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Influx of the vital Spirit into them; ſo that it is not the <hi>relaxed Muſcle,</hi> but the <hi>aſtringed Nerve</hi> that is the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate Object of Cure or Relief in a Palſy; becauſe from the Nerves, the Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles derive their Power of Motion. If the Palſy proceed from Laxity or Debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Nervous Syſtem, doubtleſs E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectricity will be ſo far from Reſtoring the Patient's Strength, that it will rather increaſe his Calamity.</p>
               <p>CONCERNING the Uſe of Electrome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and the nice Diſtinction between me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and wooden Points, which at Preſent are conſidered as of great Importance, my Opinion is, that they are more cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious than uſeful. I am very ſenſible, that Electricity imprudently applied may do much Harm; but the very ſevere Manner in which many Patients have been treated, without any fatal Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, ſufficiently proves, that it is not
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:1231401100:32"/>neceſſary to diſpenſe it like a ſtrong chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical Preparation, of which Half a Grain too much may endanger Life. The Caſe being once hit on, he muſt be but an indifferent Practitioner; who cannot charge his Jar within the Bounds of Diſcretion, according to Circumſtances, be the Jar of whatever Size it may. He may take Care to begin with Moderation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe till he has found the Degree that will anſwer his Intention; and when he has once diſcovered it, he may (if he has any tolerable Degree of Judgment) keep near enough to it to anſwer any good Purpoſe. Moreover, the Apparatus of an Electrometer, Wires, &amp;c. added to the Conductor, will cauſe ſo great a Waſte of the Electricity, as to render the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration extremely tedious; eſpecially, if the Globe or Cylinder be ſmall, and a large Number of Shocks are required at a Time; which often happens in obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Tenſions of the larger Nerves or Tendons. Add to this the diſagreeable Situation of the Patient, waiting with Terror for the Stroke, which happens ſooner or later, according as the Jar may acquire it's Charge; and that will be in proportion to the Number of Wires and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1231401100:33"/>other Incumbrances; and as thoſe Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brances are more or leſs loaded with Duſt, Damps, &amp;c. My preſent Method of giving the Shock is this:—I take the Jar (a pint Vial in general) in my right Hand, and a metal Rod in my left, and having a Wire (not a Chain) of any convenient Length, form the Circuit by graſping one End of the Wire with the Rod, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther End with the Jar. Being thus pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, I charge the Jar to what Height I judge proper; which may be done with certainty ſufficient: then preſſing the Rod againſt that Part of the Body which Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may require, and advancing the Ball of the Jar to any other proper Part, I direct the Shock at Pleaſure. But if I ſuſpect Danger of a Shock to my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, from any Cauſe, that may turn the Force of the Electricity by Way of the Ground or Floor, as thick Cloaths, a paralytick Limb, the bare Earth, a brick or damp Floor; I inſulate the Patient, or mount the Stool myſelf, which gives perfect Security. Sometimes I faſten one End of a Chain to one Part of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and connecting the other End with the charged Vial, in one Hand only, give the Shock without Fear. By this Means,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1231401100:34"/>at leaſt Two-thirds of the Labour and Wear, attending the Uſe of Electrome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters and Wires, are ſaved; which is of no ſmall Importance to thoſe who prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice much. With reſpect to Points, I could never diſcover but that metal Points would anſwer every Purpoſe, for which Points may be required: becauſe they may be made to operate in any Degree, that can poſſibly be procured by thoſe made of Wood; and to exceed them ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Mildneſs or Sharpneſs. They are alſo more certain in their Operation, not being liable to grow moiſt or dry. The Operator may be furniſhed with as many as he pleaſes; but in this, as in Shocks or Sparks, he muſt be directed by the Feelings of his Patient, on whom he may rely, that he will not willingly bear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to do himſelf any great Harm.</p>

FERGUSON, in his Introduction to Electricity, ſays, <q>"I have often drawn Sparks from Chilblains, and have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways found they were cured thereby."</q> I have often done the ſame, but never found it ſucceed. Were it certain, that Chilblains were curable by Electricity <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone,</hi> it might furniſh an Argument that would be fatal to my chief Poſition, viz. <hi>That Electricity is peculiarly adapted to the Removal of Rigidity, Tenſion, &amp;c. but pernicious in Caſes of Laxity.</hi> Now I preſume, Chilblains are allowed to be the Effect of <hi>Blood ſtagnated in relaxed Veſſels;</hi> few being ſubject to them except Children, and Perſons of lax Habits. But perhaps it may be poſſible to give ſome Account for the Miſtake;—It was that Gentleman's Method, (and a very proper One it is in all Caſes, where an electri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Operation is performed,) to order the electrified Part to be kept very warm: and this alone was ſufficient for the Cure of the Chilblains, and that in a little Time too. Now an Objection ſtarts of it's Accord,—"If Electricity be indeed a good Remedy for Tenſions, it ſhould, according to the Rule laid down by my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, be a likely Means of Cure for the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:1231401100:36"/>Complaint of which we are ſpeaking, wherein there is a manifeſt Tenſion, as appears by the Inflammation and Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Part affected."—That there is ſuch Tenſion I readily admit; yet ſtill in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on it, that Electricity alone is not ſufficient for the Cure. For unleſs it could ſtrengthen the Part, alter the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit, or remove the aſtringing Cold along with the Tenſion, there is nothing to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it's immediate Return: whereas a good warm Flannel, a double Pair of worſted Stockings, or whatever elſe may preſerve the Part in ſufficient Warmth, will ſeldom or never fail of anſwering e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>ELECTRICITY has been known to cure Blindneſs and Deafneſs; but it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, that it has much more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappointed the Expectation. This affords no Argument for the Uncertainty of it's Effects, but rather the Contrary; for let it be but conſidered, that though the Diſeaſes of the Eyes and Ears are ſometimes attended with a Tenſion, yet much the greateſt Part of them ariſe from Laxity.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:1231401100:37"/>
               <p>CONCERNING the Cure of Agues, I muſt acknowledge my Opinion to be, at preſent, unſettled for want of Experience. That ſuch Cures have been effected by Electricity is affirmed by Writers of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and therefore is not to be queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But being thoroughly perſuaded, that Electricity operates directly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to ſuch Medicines as are in general Eſteem for the Cure of Agues, as the Peruvian Bark, and divers other Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents; I find it difficult to ſuppoſe how it ſhould be attended with Succeſs, unleſs Agues may be allowed to proceed from two very different Cauſes: and indeed the Body appears to be both aſtringed and relaxed, at different Periods in the ſame Intermittent. Perhaps then, the good Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Electricity might be owing to a fortunate Application of it in Point of Time; what that Point of Time may be, I cannot ſay, but if there be any Ground for the Conjecture, I ſhould think it might be eaſily determined by one who has the Advantage of frequent Practice. Mr. CAVALLO, in his Medical Electrici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thinks it ſhould be, <hi>a little before the Fit is expected,</hi> which may perhaps an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Expectation, by Removing the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1231401100:38"/>Tenſion before it begins to ſhew itſelf. Perhaps alſo it may Sometimes ſucceed at the End of the Fit, when, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the apparent Relaxation of the Solids, there may be ſome ſmall Remains of a Tenſion, that may give Birth to another Fit.—Early in the Spring of 1781. ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perſons in my Neighbourhood, were attacked with a Fever reſembling a Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian; which was very obſtinate, baffling, for a long Time, all the Endeavours of the Faculty. One of my Family being ſeized with it, I embraced the Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of trying Electricity; and at a Time when I thought the Fits were become pretty regular, paſſed two or three very ſlight Shocks, through the Sides and Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, thoſe being the Parts in which the Patient complained of a troubleſome Pain. After this the Fit went off ſo very light, that I was much pleaſed, and began to look on Electricity as a Specific for an Ague, conſequently did not fail to repeat it at the next Return; but how great was my Diſappointment, when I obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that Fit to be attended with Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms more than ordinary ſevere; I then deſiſted for Fear of Miſchief: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of believing Electricity to be a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cific
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1231401100:39"/>for an Ague, I now began to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it in the Light of certain boaſted Medicines for the Gout, ſerving only to avert the Paroxyſm for a While, which will be ſure to come at laſt, and make the greater Havock.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledged however, that this was not a perfect Ague, for upon a more exact Obſervation, I could plainly diſcern, that, between the Paroxyſms, the Fever did not entirely ſubſide. But the Caſe may be offered in Support of the Opinion before laid down, viz. That Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity does not ſeem to be a good Remedy for Continual Fevers, and Diſorders where a morbid Cauſe is ſuppoſed to lie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed: for unleſs it has a Power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelling the morbific Matter from the Blood, the Complaint muſt remain; and I do not know, that Experience has ſhewn it to have any ſuch Power. It has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed been found to cauſe a very ſudden Tranſlation of Pain, from a Limb or Joint, to the Stomach or Bowels, and back again: but ſurely ſuch ſudden Tranſlations are not always to be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without Danger, eſpecially where there is a great Malignity of the Humours: and one fatal Accident might do infinite
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1231401100:40"/>Prejudice, both to the Profeſſor and his Art.</p>
               <p>There have been many Inſtances of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues cured by ſuch Accidents as have cauſed great Surpriſe; thus Electricity may ſtand a good Chance to ſucceed; for it is certainly ſurpriſing enough, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially to thoſe who are unacquainted with it; but curing by Accident does not prove it fitted for any particular Purpoſe. Were it once eſtabliſhed in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Practice, it would be a Benefit to Mankind; but while it is uſed at Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, it cannot be deemed better than a <hi>Quack Medicine,</hi> the Effects of which, whether good or bad depend on Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
               <p>If any Electrification were proper in Inflammatory Fevers, and others proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from a morbific Cauſe, it ſeems to be the Simple, which is equally diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted throughout the whole Habit, and creates the leaſt Diſturbance. But as the moſt gentle Electrification will quicken the Circulation, and increaſe Perſpiration, whether Increaſe of Circulation can be of any Service at a Time when the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of the Blood is already too great; or Promotion of Perſpiration produce any
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1231401100:41"/>great Good, while the Blood and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are too clammy and viſcid, and robbed of their fluid Parts, muſt with me remain a Queſtion till it be proved, that it is alſo a good Divider and Diſſolver of the Viſcidities, and ſuited to bring the Diſeaſe to a happy Criſis; or to effect a Cure by expelling the latent Cauſe at once. Till this be proved, I muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it, I cannot place any Confidence in Electricity for the Cure of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Fevers; much leſs in putrid Fevers, where the Solids have already loſt too much of their Coheſion.</p>
               <p>In Fevers of the Nervous Kind there ſeems to be as little Reaſon to expect Relief: nevertheleſs it often happens that in Fevers merely nervous, the Nerves and Tendons are terribly affected with Tenſions, Spaſms, Contractions, &amp;c. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (as I before hinted concerning ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Caſes in general) in that reſpect it may prove of wonderful Service; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided it be uſed no farther than to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the Intention of Removing ſuch Spaſms, &amp;c. and nothing more ought to be expected from it. In ſuch Caſes it frequently happens that the Patient ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to receive ſurpriſing Relief at firſt,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1231401100:42"/>but on frequent Repetitions finds it diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with him. But for ſuch Rigidities, Contractions, &amp;c. as frequently remain after ſevere Fevers, Inflammations, Rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſms, and ſuch like, it is moſt certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an admirable Remedy; and very little Experience is ſufficient to prove it.</p>
               <p>ELECTRICITY has been ſaid to cure a Dropſy. — Without repeating what has been ſaid, concerning Palſies, Agues, &amp;c. it may be ſufficient to obſerve—That large Draughts of cold Liquors taken by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons much heated with Exerciſe, are, by Phyſicians, enumerated among the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Cauſes of a Dropſy: if then Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity be, as is here affirmed, an effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Remedy in Tenſions, &amp;c. it will follow, that where ſuch a Cauſe has pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, while the Diſeaſe is recent, and before the Waters become viſcid, it may prove one of the beſt Remedies that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was introduced into Practice: becauſe as CAVALLO ſays in Med. Elect. Page 7, <q>"It ſeems to act even within thoſe Parts of the Body which, eſpecially when diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed, are moſtly out of the Reach of other Remedies."</q> As on the Contrary, when the Diſeaſe ariſes in a languid and
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1231401100:43"/>worn-out Conſtitution, it will bid fair to haſten the Patient's Departure.</p>
               <p>FROM what has been advanced it is eaſy to infer,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>1ſt.</hi> That the moſt immediate Effect, to be expected from Electricity, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtered in the medical Way, is, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of Tenſion, Rigidity, Spaſm, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>2ndly.</hi> That the beſt Chance for Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs is, when the primary Cauſe is remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If a burning Coal be laid on the Hand, no Benefit is to be expected from Electricity untill the Coal be taken away, and then it will remove the ſecondary Cauſe of the Pain, i. e. the Tenſion. Nevertheleſs, in Caſes where the primary Cauſe acts with leſs Rigour, it may, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, be of Service in Relieving or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigating the Pain, at leaſt from Time to Time, untill the primary Cauſe ſhall ceaſe. Thus in ſome Fevers, the Convulſions and Pain may probably be rendered tolerable while the Fever is running it's Courſe; but this being Conjecture only, I ſhall not dwell on it, but leave it to your Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration and Experience: only this I have to ſay, that in the imperfect Ague
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1231401100:44"/> abovementioned, and a few other fever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Caſes that have fallen within my Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, it did not ſeem to be attended with great Succeſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>3dly.</hi> That in Caſes of Laxity it is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally pernicious, but under ſome Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances may (if managed with Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence) be applied with great Advantage.</p>
               <p>From whence it will follow, that Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it ought to be accompanied with ſuch Aſſiſtants, as ſeem beſt adapted to promote the Intention, whether Aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, Corroborants, Diſcutients, Laxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, Emollients, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>AFTER the ſtricteſt Enquiries I have been able to make, as well as from my own Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, it appears to me, that ſimple Electrification, drawing or throwing the Stream, Sparks and Shocks of all Degrees, differ only in the Power and Strength of their Operation: they all <hi>relax and render pliable.</hi> And yet the milder Kinds may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a Malady, which the more powerful would increaſe. We know that mild A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtringents, mild Purgatives, &amp;c. are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently of the greateſt Service, at Times when ſtrong Ones would do great Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief: not becauſe they differ in Quality,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:1231401100:45"/>but becauſe the Patient's Conſtitution can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear them all alike. The Peruvian Bark, given in ſmall Doſes, often proves a ſalutary Bracer to the Bowels; but if diſpenſed in too large Quantities, has a contrary Effect. Thus, I preſume, it is with Electricity: ſtrong Shocks may, by over-acting their Part, increaſe a Palſy they were intended to relieve. Suppoſe, for Inſtance, a large Nerve leading to a Limb, from ſome injurious Cauſe, to be aſtringed, the Conſequence will be, that the Muſcles of that Limb will become paralytic: if now that Nerve can by any Means be ſo far relaxed, as to recover it's exact due Tone, the whole Limb will be reſtored to Health. But if the Nerve by a too powerful Application of the very ſame Means, be <hi>over relaxed,</hi> the Muſcles will be ſtill paralytic in proportion to the Degree of that <hi>over Relaxation.</hi> Hence the Limb may be cured, or made worſe, by a ſkilful or unſkilful Application of the ſame Means: and thus an electric Stroke may either relieve a Palſy, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it.</p>
               <p>But although the mildeſt Operations in Electricity may, many Times, be of the greateſt Service; yet I could wiſh every
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1231401100:46"/>Practitioner, in this infant State of the Science, to be very cautious, that he does not impute to the Mildneſs of his Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, the Credit of Cures towards which Electricity never afforded the ſmalleſt Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. This is of immenſe Importance to the Practice in general; for ſo long as Men remain under Miſtakes, or Uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, concerning the real Effects of Medicines, it will be impoſſible for them ever to arrive at any regular Method of proceeding. Let us ſuppoſe a Limb to be weakened from a Luxation, and to be free from Tenſion, (this, I truſt you will grant, is no wild Suppoſition,) and that ſtrong Shocks are repeated to no Purpoſe, or rather to the Patient's Prejudice. Suppoſe alſo, that the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perator, perceiving this ſevere Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be more injurious than uſeful, ſhould omit the Shocks and have recourſe to Sparking, or drawing the Stream; this, though a perverſe Treatment likewiſe, may not be powerful enough to prevent the relaxed Fibres recovering their Tone, by their own elaſtic Power. Here kind Nature performs the Cure of a Malady that was begun by Misfortune, increaſed by Miſmanagement, and at laſt is, by Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1231401100:47"/>imputed to one particular Species of Electricity, which, in Truth, did not in the leaſt contribute towards it: and the Uſe of Shocks is condemned, as general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly if not univerſally prejudicial, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were injudiciouſly applied.</p>
               <p>Although I inſiſt ſo much on Shocks, and the frequent Expediency of ſtrong Ones, I do not at preſent make uſe of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing more powerful than an Apothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cary's Pint Vial, and that very ſeldom full charged; by which you may judge that I am far enough from recommending de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate, or dangerous Experiments: Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience has however demonſtrated that, on proper Occaſions, double, treble, and even four Times that Force may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed with great Safety and advantage.</p>
               <p>What Alteration Electricity may make in the Blood and Humours, I do not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to determine; that I never perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any, I can with Truth declare. From the ſurpriſing Power it has of haſtening the Fluids through the Orifices of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, and conſequently of very much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing Perſpiration, it muſt, I conjecture, leave the Blood ſomewhat more dry than it was before the Operation; but I could never obſerve, or indeed hear of any
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:1231401100:48"/>Proof of it's attenuating Qualities. On the Solids it's Influence is unqueſtio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably very great: It is moſt certainly a Relaxer and Remover of Rigidity, &amp;c. and frequently in a moſt aſtoniſhing Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. I am therefore thoroughly perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that if medical Philoſophers had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to this ſingle Circumſtance; it had, long before this Time, been brought into regular Practice: and many miſerable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects might have received the Benefit of a Relief, which the whole Faculty, arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt powerful Medicines, were not able to afford.</p>
               <p>How, or by what Means, the Removal of Tenſions, &amp;c. is performed, I will not undertake to account. There is no Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to ſearch into, analyze, or explain the Nature of Electricity: perhaps it is more than the moſt ingenious Man will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to do. It is ſufficient for our Purpoſe, if Electricity be found to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>certain regular Effects;</hi> and he who knows what thoſe Effects are, may apply it with as much Certainty and Succeſs, as if he underſtood the whole Theory of Effluvia and ſubtle Mediums; and could deſcant, in the moſt learned Manner, on the Arcana of Nature: however from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1231401100:49"/>very common Experiments in Elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricity, it appears to act by a wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Kind of <hi>Inflation,</hi> which forces the Particles of Bodies, both ſolid and fluid, either ſuddenly or gradually, into, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards a Separation. Hence you may ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily gueſs the Reaſon why the Particles of all Fluids, and particularly the Globules of the Blood, are carried through Tubes and Veſſels with an increaſed Velocity. And perhaps Mr. CAVALLO, in his inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Eſſay on Medical Electricity,<note n="*" place="bottom">Page 17.</note> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry near the Point, where he ſays, <q>"Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Dr. FRANKLIN's Hypotheſis of Electricity; we ſee that it is not the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the electric Fluid that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termines the Fluids of the Body one Way or the other; but that the Effects uſually obſerved upon the Body when electrized, muſt be owing to the Irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or DILATATION occaſioned by the Action of that Fluid."</q>
