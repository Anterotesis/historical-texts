            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is no Time now to make Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes, and lay down Aphoriſms to debate upon: Matters of Fact muſt ſpeak themſelves; and that they may do ſo, let us bringthem together.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Toleration</hi> was granted to the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> at the Beginning of the Revolution; he that told us, <hi>It was not a Courteſy, but a Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Performance of an Agreement,</hi> not <hi>an Act of meer Tenderneſs and Charity,</hi> ſaid True, or he ſaid Falſe; for my Part, I never heard him Confuted, or much ſaid to contradict it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0655802200:3"/>
If the <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> was a Grant of meer Charity and Mercy, yet it was no other Charity and Mercy than the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> as Chriſtians, were obliged to ſhew: Perſecution for Conſcience being contrary to the Principles of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion;</hi> and if they were oblig'd to grant it, they are equally oblig'd to continue it, unleſs they can alledge, the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> have done any Thing to forfeit it, which we challenge all the <hi>Tories</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> to prove.</p>
            <p>If the <hi>Toleration</hi> of <hi>Diſſenters</hi> was a Capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, all Capitulations ought to be perform'd; all Agreements ought to be executed; and it is as much their Right to demand the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of it, as it was to demand the Enacting it.</p>
            <p>But the Queen, beſides all this, has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to continue it, and to preſerve it <hi>Inviol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably;</hi> we doubt not Her Majeſty meant to do ſo when She ſaid it, and means ſo ſtill: But what mean they who would oblige Her, or perſwade Her to break Her Word?</p>
            <p>We do not ſay the Parliament offer this; and we doubt not but ſome People flatter them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that all theſe Things are not only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with, but will be Effectual for the <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olable</hi> Preſervation of the <hi>Toleration;</hi> we ſhall ſee preſently how it will be prov'd.</p>
            <p>The Managers of Perſecuting Principles have very pretty Ways with them to cover and guild over the moſt effectual Meaſures of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying us, with fair Pretences of Preſerving us. Perhaps this Taking away the Schools and Academies of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> is done the better to preſerve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Inviolably.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0655802200:4"/>
We find in the firſt Section of the laſt <hi>Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Bill,</hi> the Enacting Clauſes thus Introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Now for the better Securing the ſaid Church, <hi>ſo far is Good,</hi> and Quieting the Minds of Her Majeſty's <hi>Proteſtant</hi> and <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting</hi> Subjects, and Rendering them Secure in the Exerciſe of their Religious Worſhip, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Be it Enacted</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I do not ſay, That the Bill following thoſe Words, did abridge the ſaid <hi>Diſſenters</hi> of any of their Liberties, in the Exerciſe of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Worſhip: But this I will ſay, That if the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> were ſo abridg'd by that Act, then joining the Words together, it will follow, <hi>That their ſaid Liberties were ſo abridg'd, the better to Quiet their Minds, and for the Securing them in the Exerciſe of their Religious Worſhip;</hi> perhaps other Laws may be Bleſs'd with the like Congruity.</p>
            <p>Before we go on to Examine what may, or not be deem'd an Attempt upon, and Inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the <hi>Religious Liberties</hi> of the <hi>Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> it may be very uſeful for us to enquire what thoſe <hi>Liberties</hi> really are; to which Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and that the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> may know how far thoſe <hi>Liberties</hi> do or do not extend, and when they are or are not Invaded, I believe it very much to the preſent Purpoſe to publiſh the ſaid <hi>Toleration Act</hi> at large, which, altho' it be put at the End of this Tract, the Reader is deſir'd to turn to it, and Peruſe it before he goes on any farther.</p>
            <p>HAVING now Suppos'd, that the Readers of this Tract have Perus'd the Act of <hi>Toleration</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0655802200:5"/>
deliberately, and have thereby a clear Account of what the <hi>Diſsenters</hi> Liberties really are, it will be alſo Neceſſary to let them ſee what it is that the preſent Depending Bill is to Enact againſt them, and ſo we ſhall preſently judge about the Word <hi>INVIOLABLY,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>It is true, and this is the great Pretence of thoſe who promote this Matter, That the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Schools and Academies for the Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and Educating our Children, is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly a Part of the <hi>Toleration Bill;</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſay they, The <hi>Toleration</hi> may be Inviol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably <hi>preſerv'd, notwithſtanding the Paſſing the preſent Bill</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> will refute this by alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That the Liberty of Teaching and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing our Children, is ſuch an Eſſential, in the <hi>Meaning</hi> of a <hi>Toleration,</hi> that it needs no more to be expreſs'd therein, than a Liberty of going out of our own Houſes, or riſing out of our Beds, and putting on our Clothes, in Order to a religious Aſſembly, need to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in that Part of the Act which allows Places to be appointed for that Worſhip.</p>
            <p>If any eſſential Part of the <hi>Toleration</hi> be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away, altho' not expreſs'd, how is the <hi>Toleration</hi> then preſerv'd <hi>Inviolably?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther, the educating of Children is a Part of the religious Duties of a Chriſtian, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe of the <hi>Proteſtant Religion,</hi> more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially regarded as ſuch: If the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are abridg'd of what is their indiſpenſible Duty, they are perſecuted in the moſt extreme Senſe of Perſecution; For the Conſequence is, they muſt offend againſt this Law, becauſe they are
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0655802200:6"/>
bound <hi>to obey GOD rather than Man.</hi> In of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending this Law they muſt incur a Penalty; not being able to pay the Penalty, they muſt go to Priſon, and in Priſon they muſt periſh: So that in Conſequence of this Law, the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> will ſuffer <hi>Death</hi> for their Religion, and and yet the <hi>Toleration</hi> be preſerved INVIO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LABLE.</p>
            <p>I think the Plainneſs of this Caſe is not to be found Fault with, Religion is nothing more or leſs than a Serving or Worſhipping GOD, our Maker and Lawgiver. The Method is preſcrib'd by His <hi>Word; Conſcience</hi> is to every Man the Judge of his own Duty, and the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Performing is this, Conſcience is a So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign Dictator in the Mind of Men, and it muſt be obey'd; So it is not meet to make Laws to reſtrain it, human Power having no judicial Right over it.</p>
            <p>As then Conſcience muſt be obey'd, in which the Scripture is clear, <hi>Whether it be lawful to obey GOD rather than Man, judge ye?</hi> When Laws are made reſtraining us to ſuch Things as Conſcience forbids to do, or commands not to omit, what muſt we do?</p>
            <p>The Anſwer is plain, <hi>We muſt ſuffer.</hi> True, but then we muſt ſay, <hi>That this is</hi> PERSECU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION: If then <hi>Perſecution</hi> is contrary to the <hi>Principles</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> as we have the Authority of Parliament, in the Preamble to the <hi>first occaſional Bill,</hi> to prove; what fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows? But that every <hi>perſecuting Act</hi> is an <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Act.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Whether the preſent depending Bill be a Perſecuting, and conſequently an unchriſtian ſtill, let others judge; this Deponent faith not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0655802200:7"/>
It may however be of ſome Uſe to enquire into ſome of the Conſequences which the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> may expect from this Law, that thoſe who are to ſuffer by it, may prepare their Minds for <hi>Martyrdom;</hi> and they who are to paſs it, may conſider what <hi>Ruin</hi> of <hi>Families,</hi> what <hi>Blood</hi> of <hi>Conſcientious Sufferers,</hi> what <hi>Encreaſe</hi> of <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,</hi> and conſequently of <hi>Error,</hi> they are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be the Cauſe of; and what terrible Havock they are going to make in the <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which has Enemies enough, and Wounds enough already. Perhaps when theſe Things come to be ſeriouſly reflected upon, they may conſider.</p>
            <p>Since then the <hi>Perſecution</hi> is thus reviv'd, what muſt the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> do? <hi>Negatively,</hi> I'll tell you what they <hi>cannot do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They cannot ſay their <hi>Toleration</hi> is IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIOLABLY preſerv'd: They that think this Bill does not interfere with the <hi>Toleration,</hi> may here compare them together; The one ſays, <hi>Eaſe is to be given to tender Conſciences;</hi> The o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſays, <hi>The tenderest Conſciences ſhall be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt;</hi> one ſays, <hi>The</hi> Diſſenters <hi>ſhall have Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to aſſemble, and their Children may worſhip GOD with them:</hi> The other ſays, <hi>They ſhall not have School-maſters to inſtruct them how to Worſhip;</hi> one gives them a Liberty of <hi>profeſſing their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent;</hi> The other denies them the Liberty of <hi>being Taught to know why they diſſent:</hi> This is the ready Way indeed to make <hi>Diſſenting</hi> be a <hi>Faction</hi> in the next Age, as they pretend it is now <hi>not a religious Principle.</hi> Thus the <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> is <hi>preſerv'd,</hi> and not <hi>preſerv'd</hi> at the ſame Time. The <hi>Letter</hi> of the <hi>Toleration</hi> is preſerv'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0655802200:8"/>
in Deed, but the <hi>Subſtance</hi> and <hi>eſſential Parts</hi> are deſtroy'd.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They cannot ſay, they are kindly treated by the Church; and when they look back upon their own Conduct to the Church, they tell them plainly, <hi>they have not deſerv'd this Uſage at their Hands;</hi> When they reſcued the Church from an evident Ruin in King <hi>James</hi>'s Time, mighty Promiſes of Temper and Tenderneſs were made them; let us ſuppoſe now the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> parting with them at that Time in this Manner, <q rend="inline margSglQuotes">"<hi>Yes, yes,</hi> Gentlemen, you promiſe us fair now, while you are under Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the <hi>Popiſh Party.</hi> Now you call us <hi>Brethren,</hi> and talk well of the <hi>ſmall</hi> Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences between us; and how Charity ought to bury what is paſt, and to bind us cloſſer for the Time to come, that you find now you have been miſtaken, and that we are as <hi>faithful</hi> to the <hi>Proteſtant Intereſt</hi> as your ſelves; and you will for ever eſteem us the <hi>ſame Chriſtians</hi> as your Selves, allowing us a <hi>Legal</hi> eſtabliſh'd Liberty, and living in <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity</hi> with us; will never more ſuffer the <hi>indifferent Things</hi> which are in Diſpute among us to divide us. But when, by our Aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, you are eſtabliſh'd again, you will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all theſe Things. When a Generation riſes up, <hi>That knows not</hi> Joſeph, they will call us all <hi>Schiſmaticks,</hi> and <hi>Recuſants</hi> again; Couple us with <hi>Papists,</hi> ſay we are <hi>Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> to the <hi>Church,</hi> and <hi>Enemies</hi> to <hi>Monarchy,</hi> and make new Laws againſt us, deſtroy the <hi>Toleration</hi> you now offer us, and <hi>perſecute</hi> us as bad as ever.</q>

               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0655802200:9"/>
When the <hi>Diſſenter</hi> ſays thus to them, Suppoſe a certain Grave Divine ſtands up and Quotes the Words of <hi>Haſael</hi> the King of <hi>Aſſyria, Is thy Servant a Dog, that be ſhould do this thing?</hi> What now would that Grave Divine ſay, <hi>for the Paſſage is not a Fable,</hi> if he were to ſee this Bill paſſing the Houſe? would he Plead, that <hi>this is not Perſecution?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queſtion is not only upon the word <hi>Perſecution,</hi> tho' that is anſwer'd plain e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough too: But is it <hi>Just?</hi> Is it <hi>Kind?</hi> Is it <hi>Grateful?</hi> Is it <hi>Agreeable</hi> to former Pretences?

            <p>Beſides this, the <hi>Inhumanity</hi> of this Law, which admits of a large Deſcription, and which has many Branches Tending to <hi>Cruelty,</hi> cannot but fill the Minds of our Poſterity with Abhorrence of the Church it ſelf, and ſo make the Breach wider than ever it was before: As all the Sangninary Laws againſt the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,

and againſt the <hi>Primitive Church,</hi> could never ſtop the Progreſs either of the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion at firſt, or of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Religion afterwards, ſo neither will this, but will Confirm, Eſtabliſh, and Encreaſe the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> in this Nation. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all,</p>
            <p>The Methods which will alſo be ſtill leſs to the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to evade this Act, will of Courſe have one of theſe two Effects; either, which we earneſtly wiſh, it will cauſe the Church to ſee the Miſtake, and Repeal the Rigorous Law; or, as thoſe who run into many Evils, to Support, and rather than Recant the firſt, it will oblige them to ſuch other and farther Steps of this Kind, as muſt revive the ſevereſt Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, even to Death and Torture; the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences we may reaſonably expect will end in Judgment from Heaven, and the Confuſion of the Nation.</p>
            <p>We cannot but hope that theſe Things may prevail with our Legiſlators to conſider what is before them, and to examine as well the <hi>Political</hi> as the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Arguments which may be offer'd to them againſt this <hi>Bill.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Particularly, how it ſtrikes at the Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Religion, as Chriſtian, and tends to the Deſtroying the Light and Knowledge of Divine Things in the World, which is the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the Reformation: Whereas, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Children in the Knowledge of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is reſtrain'd, loaded with Difficulties, or limited, it is thereby diſcouraged, leſſen'd and put backward, which is contrary to the Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all the <hi>Proteſtant Nations</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0655802200:13"/>
Neither is it enough to ſay, That the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenters</hi> are the Cauſe of ſuch Diſcouragement, for that they may ſend their Children to Learn the <hi>Church Catechiſm,</hi> and to <hi>Church Tutors</hi> and <hi>School-maſters.</hi> For if the Diſſenters can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not in Conſcience Conform, neither can they in Conſcience teach their Children to Conform; and if that Principle, <hi>Conſcience,</hi> obliges them to keep their Children without any Degree of Learning and Inſtruction, which they would otherwiſe have had; the Law that limits their Education to Terms which their Parents can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not comply with, is the unrighteous Cauſe of that Defect, and thus Ignorance flows in of Courſe. It is to be hop'd, the <hi>Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> will not be thought to plant it ſelf beſt in the Ignorance of the People. Chriſtian Knowledge is the Fountain of the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Chriſtian Religion. <hi>Popery,</hi> indeed, may be ſaid to be <hi>Founded</hi> in <hi>Ignorance,</hi> and <hi>propagated</hi> in <hi>Superſtition,</hi> which is the Child of Stupidity and Blindneſs. But <hi>Knowledge,</hi> and the Light of the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> were the Nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and Founders of the Reformation; and Woe be to that Nation, or People, or Body of Men, who pretend to propagate the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Religion by Reſtraining the Knowledge of Religion in the Minds of the Younger Part of the Nation, who it is their Duty by all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Means to Inſtruct.</p>
            <p>We find in the Heads of the <hi>Bill</hi> now De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending, ſome Things alſo more particularly Tending to Perſecution than is yet mention'd <hi>(viz.)</hi> The Engaging every one who ſhall have a Licenſe to Teach School, never to be

            <p>What the Fines and Penalties are; how Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous the Proſecution; how the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are debarr'd from their Liberty of Appeal to Her Majeſty's Superiour Courts of Juſtice, and left to the Mercy of the <hi>Juſtices</hi> of the <hi>Peace,</hi> without Appeal; and how to be proſecuted in <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts,</hi> where the Church-Men, who in this Cauſe are Parties, are made Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es. As theſe Things are apparent in the <hi>Bill,</hi> ſo are they the Height of <hi>Perſecution,</hi> unprece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dented; and in their Nature, an Oppreſſion of our Civil Rights as <hi>Engliſhmen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To cloſe all. How theſe Things agree with the <hi>Toleration,</hi> is a Myſtery I can by no Means reconcile. Perhaps thoſe who read the <hi>Bills</hi> both together, and ſee how and where the Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes join, and where they part, may ſee leſs of Perſecution than I can; and that all Men may do ſo, and judge for themſelves, therefore are the Copies Publiſhed in this Manner.</p>

            <p n="7">VII. WHETHER the Biſhops that have been advanc'd to that Honour ſince the <hi>Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution,</hi> who have generally been Perſons of the greateſt Eminence for their Worth and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, have not met with more Reſpect from the Diſſenters, than from many who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be zealous Members of their own Church? And whether it is a ſuitable Return for Perſons of their Lordſhips Candour, to deal more hardly by us as to our Children, than their Predeceſſors ever attempted to do by our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, as to their Deſcendants?</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. WHETHER any Thing more tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affected the Proteſtants in <hi>France,</hi> than the denying them Liberty to Educate their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in their own Principles? And whether that Method which has all along been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as ſo ſevere in a <hi>Popiſh Prince,</hi> can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be fit to be countenanced by <hi>Proteſtant Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,</hi> in a <hi>Proteſtant Country?</hi>

            <p n="9">IX. WHETHER if <hi>Popery</hi> ſhould once more prevail among us, which ſome who are Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to the Bench of Biſhops have owned to be no very remote Suppoſition, it would be a moſt grating Reflection when the Legiſlators ſhould demand the Education of the Children of all <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> to hear them inſinuate, That their Lordſhips had ſet them the Pattern, by demanding the Education of the Children of <hi>Diſſenters?</hi>

X. WHETHER it can reaſonably be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that they ſhould ever have the Courage to endure the Fiery Trial, (which is what, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the foregoing Suppoſition they may be called to) who, by any Political Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſhould be kept from ſheltring the Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent? And whether upon Suppoſition any Members of their own Church ſhould threaten them, if they acted according to the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples by which they obtained their Preferments, it would not be more becoming to inform them better, and yield more Comfort to ſet them an Example of Steadineſs, than to harden and embolden them, by yielding to them in a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of treating Brethren, that is neither Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural nor Rational?</p>
            <p n="11">XI. WHETHER it be ſeemly for Guides of the Church, to paſs ſuch a Cenſure upon the <hi>Aſſemblie</hi>'s <hi>Catechiſm,</hi> as if it were not fit to be Taught, when there is nothing to be found in it, but what agrees with the Doctrine, and nothing that is oppoſite to the Government of their own Church? And how it can be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil'd with the Honour and Veracity of their Lordſhips to allow no other Catechiſm than that, which cannot be anſwer'd to with Truth by the Children of Diſſenters, who had no Godfathers or Godmothers to give them their Names, or promiſe for them?</p>
            <p n="12">XII. WHETHER the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Courts</hi> have not from the firſt Reformation been own'd a great Grievance by the beſt Prelates and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the <hi>Church of England?</hi> Whether they have not upon Occaſion been freely inveigh'd againſt, by many who are at preſent on the

Biſhops bench? And, Whether there be any ſuch Evidence of their Amendment, as can juſtify their now concurring to ſupport and in courage them?</p>
            <p>AND, Laſtly, WHETHER the paſſing ſuch a Bill into a Law, be not more likely to ſpread Animoſity, increaſe Uncharitableneſs, and perpetuate Diviſion, than prevent the Growth of what is call'd <hi>Schiſm?</hi> And, Whether this be not as evident, as that publickly branding a Body of Men, will inflame the Populace againſt them; and that Severity on the other Hand tends to exaſperate the Sufferers?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My Lords the Biſhops are earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted to take theſe Things into their ſerious Conſideration, by ſeveral of the Deſcendants of thoſe very</hi> Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians, <hi>who earneſtly ( tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vain) implor'd the Compaſſion of their Predeceſſors in</hi> 1661; <hi>and by many that have join'd with them in waiting for the fulfilling their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes in</hi> 1687 <hi>and</hi> 1688: <hi>And who moſt heartily beg of Almighty GOD, they may never fall into the ſame Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities, or worſe, by having our Common Hopes, which depend upon the Proteſtant Succeſſion in the Illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Houſe of</hi> HANOVER, <hi>defea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, according to ſome Mens Deſires and Wiſhes, which we pray may never take Effect.</hi>
