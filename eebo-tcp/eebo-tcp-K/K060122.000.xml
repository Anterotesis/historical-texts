            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE World being ſo full of Polititians, and ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Authors having of late turn'd Stateſmen, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves me to lay every Thing down exceeding plain, as I go on; The Subject is nice, the Age abuſive, the Town full of <hi>Obſervers</hi> and <hi>Reviewers,</hi> who Write to pleaſe and content the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men, who, directed by their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt and Parties, differ even with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; Reaſon, it is true, is DICTATOR in the Society of Mankind; from her there ought to lye no Appeal; But here we want a Pope in our Philoſophy, to be the infallible Judge of what <hi>is</hi> or<hi>is not</hi> Reaſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0019500400:4"/>
I am to ſpeak of what all People are buſie about, but not one in Forty under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands: Every Man has a Concern in it, few know what it is, nor is it eaſy to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine or deſcribe it. If a Man goes about to explain it by Words, he rather ſtruggles to loſe himſelf <hi>in the Wood,</hi> than bring o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers out of it. It is beſt deſcrib'd by it ſelf; 'tis like the Wind that blows <hi>where it liſts,</hi> we hear the <hi>ſound</hi> thereof, but hardly know <hi>whence it comes,</hi> or <hi>whither it goes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Like the Soul</hi> in the Body, it acts all Subſtance, yet is it ſelf Immaterial; it gives Motion, yet it ſelf cannot be ſaid to Exiſt; it creates <hi>Forms,</hi> yet has it ſelf <hi>no Form;</hi> it is neither Quantity or Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; it has no <hi>Whereneſs,</hi> or <hi>Whenneſs, Scite,</hi> or <hi>Habit.</hi> If I ſhould ſay it is the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Shadow of ſomething that is Not; ſhould I not Puzzle the thing rather than Explain it, and leave you and my ſelf more the Dark than we were before?</p>
            <p>To come a at direct and clear Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the Thing, the beſt Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod will be to deſcribe its <hi>Operations,</hi> rather than define its <hi>Nature;</hi> to ſhow <hi>how it Acts</hi> rather than <hi>how it Exiſts,</hi> and <hi>what it does,</hi> rather than <hi>what it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TRADE, as the Author of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view</hi> has told us, and who I can better ſubmit to learn of on that ſubject, than

ſome other he talks more about <q rend="inline margQuotes">"was derived by Convenience from the profitable exchanging of Goods from Nation to Nation, and from Place to Place, as People encreaſing, found their Neighbours poſſeſt of what they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and themſelves having to ſpare of what their Neighbouring Countries did not produce."</q> 
               <hi>This we now call Barter,</hi> and is not ſo much in Uſe as it was in the Infancy of Commerce in the World.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Brittains</hi> Inhabiting this Iſland were found to Exchange their <hi>Block Tin</hi> with the <hi>Phenecian</hi> Merchants for <hi>Spices, Wines</hi> and <hi>Oyls,</hi> even long before <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> ſet his Foot upon this Iſland.</p>
            <p>But as Trade increaſed, two Accidents <hi>fell in,</hi> as Effects; being the great <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ums</hi> of Univerſal Commerce, <hi>the Vehicle</hi> in which Trade is Preſerv'd or Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred thro' the World; theſe were <hi>Money</hi> and <hi>Credit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This thing call'd Commerce flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and extending every way into all the Corners of the World, the Nations fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally into Dealing with one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; yet Trade found it ſelf unſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſtreightned and perplext for want of a General <hi>Species</hi> of a compleat intrinſick Worth, <hi>as the Medium</hi> to ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Exchanging, and to make good <hi>the Balance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> where a Nation, or a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0019500400:6"/>
or a Merchant, demanded of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a greater quantity of Goods than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Buyer had Goods <hi>to Anſwer,</hi> or the Seller had occaſion to <hi>take back.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This nothing could be found in the World of univerſal and intrinſick Worth enough to Anſwer, but <hi>Metals;</hi> as being neither conſuming in <hi>Quality,</hi> bulky in <hi>Carriage,</hi> or uſeleſs in <hi>Nature:</hi> Of theſe Metals ſeveral Nations adhered a long time, to ſuch as their own Country pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced; but <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> by their meer intrinſick Worth, prevailed; and they alone retain the univerſal Character, as it may be called, in all Payments of whatever kind in the World.</p>
            <p>The Courſe of Trade being thus turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from exchanging of Goods for Goods, or <hi>Delivering</hi> and <hi>Taking,</hi> to <hi>Selling</hi> and <hi>Paying,</hi> all the Bargains in the World are now ſtated upon the Foot of <hi>a Price</hi> in Money; and tho' it be at any Time an Exchange of <hi>Goods</hi> for <hi>Goods,</hi> yet even thoſe Goods are on either ſide rated at a <hi>Price</hi> in Money.</p>
            <p>Tho' this was a great Aſſiſtant to Trade, and gave a liberty to the increaſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce more than ever it had before, <hi>yet</hi> ſuch was the great increaſe of Trade, that it even over-run the Money it ſelf, and all the Specie in the World could not anſwer the Demand, or be ready juſt at
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0019500400:7"/>
Time, Trade called for it. <hi>This occaſioned,</hi> That when <hi>A</hi> Bought more Goods of <hi>B</hi> than <hi>A</hi> had Money to pay for; and <hi>B</hi> having no Need of any Goods that <hi>A</hi> had to Sell; it behoved, that <hi>A</hi> ſhould leave his Goods with <hi>B</hi> for a certain Time, in which <hi>A</hi> was to provide the Money for the ſaid Goods: And this was done, both from the Occaſion <hi>B</hi> had to ſell his Goods, the Occaſion <hi>A</hi> had to buy them, and the Opinion <hi>B</hi> had of <hi>A</hi>'s Integrity and Ability for Payment.</p>
            <p>And this is the Great Thing call'd CREDIT.</p>
            <p>CREDIT is a Conſequence, not a Cauſe; the Effect of a Subſtance, not a Subſtance; 'tis the <hi>Sun-ſhine,</hi> not the Sun; the quickning SOMETHING, <hi>Call it what you will,</hi> that gives Life to <hi>Trade,</hi> gives Being to the Branches, and Moiſture to the Root; 'tis the <hi>Oil</hi> of the Wheel, the <hi>Marrow</hi> in the Bones, the <hi>Blood</hi> in the Veins, and the <hi>Spirits</hi> in the Heart of all the Negoce, Trade, Caſh, and Commerce in the World.</p>
            <p>It is produc'd, and grows inſenſibly, from fair and upright Dealing, punctual Compliance, honourable Performance of Contracts and Covenants, in ſhort, 'tis the Off-ſpring of univerſal Probity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0019500400:8"/>
'Tis apparent, even by its Nature, 'tis no way dependent upon Perſons, Parliaments, or any particular Men, or Sett of Men, <hi>as ſuch,</hi> in the World; but upon <hi>their Conduct</hi> and <hi>Juſt</hi> Behaviour. <hi>Credit</hi> never was chain'd to Mens <hi>Names,</hi> but to their <hi>Actions;</hi> not to Families, Clans, or Collections of Men; no, not to Nations; 'Tis the Honour, the Juſtice, the Fair-Dealing, and the equal Conduct of <hi>Men,</hi> Bodies of Men, Nations, and People, that raiſe the thing call'd <hi>Credit</hi> among them; whereſoever this is found, CREDIT will live and thrive, grow and encreaſe; <hi>where this is wanting,</hi> let all the Power and Wit of Man join toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they can neither give her Being, or preſerve her Life.</p>
            <p>Arts have been try'd, on various Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in the World, to raiſe CREDIT; <hi>Art</hi> has been found able, with more Eaſe, to deſtroy <hi>Credit,</hi> than to raiſe it: The Force of <hi>Art,</hi> aſſiſted by the punctual, fair, and juſt Dealing <hi>aboveſaid;</hi> may have done much to form a <hi>Credit</hi> upon the Face of Things; but we find ſtill the <hi>Honour</hi> would have done it without the <hi>Art,</hi> but never the <hi>Art</hi> without the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> Nor will Money it ſelf, which <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſays, <hi>anſwers all things,</hi> purchaſe this thing call'd <hi>Credit,</hi> or reſtore it when loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0019500400:9"/>
It is in vain to talk of <hi>Credit</hi> without this <hi>Probity:</hi> Honeſty will raiſe <hi>Credit</hi> without Money; but all the Money in the World will not raiſe <hi>Credit</hi> without the Principle. <hi>D.</hi> was a Prince of high Birth, a great Character for Wit, Gallan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and all the Perfections of a Duke and Peer of one of the Politeſt Nations in <hi>Europe;</hi> he had, <hi>beſides,</hi> a noble Fortune, built great Edifices, purchaſed great Houſes, maintain'd a vaſt Equipage, and did every thing with the Air of an exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite and moſt accompliſh'd Gentleman; he had a vaſt Fortune, great Offices at Court, nor did he ever want Money; his Stewards were never without 20000 Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtols in Caſh; if <hi>any Summ,</hi> however great, was wanting to ſupport any Point of Honour, for his Play, or to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe what he had his Eye upon, he knew how to produce it; yet the Barber would not truſt him for a Perriwig; the Coach-maker would not let his Chariot go home with a new Sett of Wheels; <hi>What was the matter?</hi> He would pay no Body generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or honourably; he would be ſurroun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Duns as he came out of his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace, and would go <hi>Incognito</hi> to Court to prevent being inſulted: The <hi>Sbirri,</hi> or <hi>Provoſt's Men</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> would ſtop his Coach in the Street, he has been forc'd to
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0019500400:10"/>
call a Chair, and leave his Coach and Horſes in their Poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>The thing was plain, he had no <hi>Credit;</hi> his great Eſtate, his high Birth and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, his Equipage, his vaſt Quantity of Gold Plate, his large Caſh, they would not add one Inch to the Stature of his <hi>Credit;</hi> but he liv'd as if he was Poor, and was leſs eſteem'd in the Shops of the Marchands than a private Gentleman; nay, than one of the <hi>Burgois;</hi> I had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſaid, than a Shoe-maker in the City.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, <hi>S—</hi> is a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a moderate Fortune, compar'd to the other, but is alſo a Man of Quality; he lives Nobly, tho' Frugally; keeps a good Equipage, a handſom Family, does not lay up much, his generous Nature will not permit it; but he pays punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, no Man comes twice for his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; if a Tradeſman leaves his Bill, he buys no more of him till he comes for his Money; he never Dines till his Wine is paid for; he wears no Cloaths that the Taylor or Mercer can reproach him for, and call THEIRS as he goes along the Street; inſtead of having his Door crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Duns, and his Steward brib'd to pay, he is rather crowded with Shop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keepers to petition for his Cuſtom; his Servants are teiz'd to procure their Lord
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0019500400:11"/>
to buy here or there, and every one ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies to leave his Goods for Approbation. The Tradeſmen are ready to fight, who ſhall get in his Goods, and Sell often to Loſs, to under-rate one another. What's the Matter? <hi>Credit</hi> ſtands at his Door; Honour lives there, and <hi>Credit</hi> is her Handmaid. The Count deals juſtly, pays punctually, every Man's Demands are anſwer'd, <hi>Credit</hi> courts him, he ſhall have her Favour, whether he will uſe her or no.</p>
            <p>It is needleſs to enlarge; Experience tells us the ſame thing in all Caſes, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther private or publick, Perſonal or Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Credit</hi> is the Conſequence of juſt and honourable Dealing; fair Propoſals pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually perform'd will bring Credit, let the Perſon or People be who they will. How do we Trade among the <hi>Turks,</hi> and Truſt the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> one of whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, in the <hi>Alchor an,</hi> is, not to keep Faith with Chriſtians? They have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd it by a juſt, punctual, and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Practice <hi>in Trade,</hi> and you <hi>Credit them without Scruple;</hi> nay, rather than a Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>Upon this Foundation I build what I am in hand with, and bring it down to the preſent Caſe: I know no Perſons or Parties in my Argument: This Lord

Treaſurer or another Lord Treaſurer, or no Lord Treaſurer, it is the ſame thing to me; a Bank or no Bank, 'tis all one, I'll ſell none of my Tallies or Annuities, I'll diſcount no Exchequer Bills: Diſſolve the Parliament or not Diſſolve the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 'tis all one to me; I neither fear, deſire, or am anxious about either; nor can I ſee ſo much Cauſe for an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm among our People that have Money, as if Credit was pinn'd to the Girdle of a Man, or waited at the Door of the Houſe of Commons; the thing is a Miſtake, Credit attends the honourable Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of your <hi>Treaſurers,</hi> your <hi>Exchequers,</hi> your <hi>Parliaments,</hi> whether paſt, preſent, or to come.</p>
            <p>I do not examine what Politic Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may induce her Majeſty, to change or remove her Great Men in the Miniſtry; I enquire not whether her Majeſty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to diſſolve the Parliament, or to let them Sir, theſe things are not concern'd in our Caſe: The late Lord Treaſurer, I allow, has done Honourably, has manag'd the Finances with great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Dexterity, and has acquir'd thereby the Fame of the Beſt Officer, that has for many Years acted in that Poſt; I could be content to ſpend a whole Page in his Praiſe; the Nation is infinitely obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to him; and his Royal Miſtreſs, no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0019500400:13"/>
doubt, has receiv'd infinite Satisfaction in his Conduct, as appears by rejecting all Attempts againſt him, and keeping him ſo long in a Poſt of ſo Great Truſt.</p>
            <p>But after this is ſaid, <hi>Credit,</hi> which has for ſome Years been the Nations happy Gueſt, by whoſe Aid ſuch mighty Things have been done, cannot be ſaid to be the ſole Property of my Lord T—r Perſonally; it is not ſingly intail'd upon his Family, or his Name; this would be to go a length his Lordſhip himſelf has more Modeſty than to claim; no would his Lordſhip be well pleaſed with any that could think ſuch courſe kind of Flattery would oblige him.</p>
            <p>Our Credit in this Caſe is a Public Thing; it is rightly call'd by ſome of our Writers, NATIONAL CREDIT; the Word denominates its Original; 'tis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd by <hi>the Nations</hi> Probity, the Honour and exact performing <hi>National Engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> In this the Great Officers of the Treaſury and Exchequer are, as we may ſay, perfectly Paſſive; their Buſineſs is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Active; ſo the Wheels of a Clock, their Buſineſs is to go round; but they are ſubject to the Influence of <hi>their Poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the Operations of the Springs and Wheels that guide <hi>their Motion,</hi> by which they act paſſively, if that may be ſaid, <hi>that is,</hi> of meer Neceſſity; and the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0019500400:14"/>
pointing of the Hand to the Lines ſhewing the Hour, the Minutes and the Seconds, <hi>are Conſequences</hi> of theſe Motions: Theſe indeed tell us that the Wheels are good, perfectly made, exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly plac'd, and move to a Truth; but the Honour redounds to the <hi>Workman,</hi> who plac'd them in that exact Order, adapted them to their ſeveral Uſes, and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſuch Springs and Wheels about them, which by their like exactneſs, but all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd from the ſame Original, oblige eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part punctually to perform the End of the whole Movement.</p>
            <p>CREDIT is not the Effect of this or that Wheel in the Government, moving regular and juſt to its proper Work; but of the whole Movement, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting by the Force of its true original Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, according to the exquiſite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Director of the whole Frame.</p>
            <p>Thus the <hi>Honour,</hi> the <hi>Probity,</hi> the <hi>exact,</hi> punctual <hi>Management,</hi> which has raiſed our <hi>Credit</hi> to the pitch it is now arriv'd at, has not been merely the Great Wheel in <hi>the Nations Clockwork,</hi> that turn'd about the Treaſure, but the Great Spring that turn'd about that Wheel, and this is the QUEEN and PARLIAMENT. <hi>The one,</hi> the Spring <hi>(ſtill keeping to the Allegory)</hi> that gives Motion or Life to the whole; <hi>the other,</hi> the Balance or Pendulum,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0019500400:15"/>
that regulates that Motion, keeps it true to, and exact in the performance of the General Work, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the equal and punctual dividing the ſmalleſt meaſures of Time.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Nice Caſe</hi> requires me a little to deſcend to Particulars, and touch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact nearer than was intended; What is it has reſtored and recovered the Nations <hi>Credit</hi> from the Breaches made in it? The anſwering this neceſſarily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires that I ſhould alſo ask what made the former Breaches in <hi>our Credit?</hi> I ſhall do this as Modeſtly as I can; for it is not the preſent Work to open Sores, but to heal them, to prevent more from breaking out.</p>
            <p>Some of the Reaſons which ſunk <hi>our Credit,</hi> and made the Breaches in it in the late Reign, were the ſettling Funds that were in themſelves deficient; and making no Provinſion to ſupply thoſe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies. Some would perhaps go far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ſay, It was ſettling Funds that <hi>were not probable,</hi> and whoſe Deficiencies Were viſible. I ſhall not go that length; the Error was in the Original; it would be unjuſt to charge the Deficiency of theſe Funds upon the Commiſſioners of the Treaſury <hi>for the Time being,</hi> it would be ſtill harder to blame them for the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0019500400:16"/>
not ſupplying thoſe Deficiencies. Some may have ſaid they were to blame in the Firſt Act, becauſe it was their Work to provide Funds, and the Parliament on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gave what they ask'd; that they took them and went away ſatisfied, as ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for the ſupply of the Occaſion, and that they were Judges of the probability: <hi>I am not of that mind,</hi> tho' it is not to my purpoſe here to debate it. But this is Certain, the not ſupplying the Deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies upon the repeated Application of the Perſons whoſe Eſtates lay in thoſe Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies, ſeem'd wholly to lye at the Door of the Parliament, and this brought the Tallies on thoſe Funds to intollerable, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of Diſcounts, to the ruin of all that we <hi>called Credit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then has raiſed <hi>this Credit?</hi> I hope I do not detract from the juſt Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of him, whom one calls the great Guide of the Nation's Treaſure, if I ſay, It was ſomething elſe than his Lordſhip's Management; ſomething Prior to it, <hi>in which</hi> that National Honour and Juſtice, Reſolution of punctual Payment and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for the Means of it, <hi>appeared,</hi> which put Life into the Nation, and made thoſe People that had Money think it <hi>as ſafe,</hi> as well depoſited, and the Principal in as <hi>good Hands</hi> as in their own; ſo that they
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0019500400:17"/>
were perfectly Eaſie in adventuring their Money, and the longer this went on, the forwarder were the People to bring in their Money: Nay, ſo forward, that the faſter the Government lower'd their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, the more eager were the People to bring in their Money.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Let us ſee</hi> where this began, and this will tell us <hi>whoſe doing</hi> it was. After the firſt Seſſion of Parliament of Her preſent Majeſty, the Queen acquainted the Houſe, That the Funds had more than anſwered the Sums <hi>they were given for;</hi> there was the capital Wound of Deficiency healed at once. That the Overplus ſhould be apply'd, &amp;c. There was an Aſſurance, that all Defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciencies, if any happen'd, ſhould be made good. This gave <hi>the Parliament Part</hi> a Brightneſs that reviv'd the Spirits of the People, help'd open their Purſes which had been ſo long cloſed, and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Taxes to be raiſed without murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Queen</hi> acted the next part; Her Majeſty gave conſtant Aſſurances, that every thing given ſhould be <hi>rightly apply'd;</hi> and to Encourage her People, and ſhew ſhe was willing <hi>to bear a part</hi> of their Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, the Queen generouſly threw in <hi>an Hundred thouſand Pownd</hi> of her own Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>appropriated for the Civil Liſt,</hi> to eaſe
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0019500400:18"/>
the Nation of ſo much in that Years Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then. <hi>Theſe were Steps</hi> no Prince ever was known to take before. <hi>After this</hi> you never heard of a Complaint of the heavy Burthen of the Taxes, tho' greater far than any raiſed in the former Reign; on the contrary, <hi>the more</hi> you rais'd, <hi>the eaſier</hi> they were paid; <hi>the more</hi> the Nation ran in Debt, <hi>the higher</hi> their Credit roſe every day. <hi>After this</hi> you never had any Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of Accounts ask'd for, or any Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion about Miſapplication. <hi>No Man</hi> need go far for a Reaſon for this; <hi>the Credit</hi> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred all in the Queen, whoſe Concern was ſo viſible for her Peoples good, that ſhe would ſuffer no Miſapplications; that ſhe would Employ none but in whom ſhe could place entire Confidence; whoſe Probity and Exactneſs her Majeſty could anſwer for <hi>to her ſelf,</hi> and was well aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured ſhe might be <hi>ſafe in.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis no way leſſening the Honour of the Servants her Majeſty Choſe, to ſay that the Nations Credit depends not on the Reputation of their Conduct; but on her Majeſty's Care, in Choſing ſuch Men, whoſe Conduct would perform all the Nation could expect; and that if they ſhould fail, her Majeſty would not fail to remove them, and put in others. This is putting the thing right; the Sum and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0019500400:19"/>
Subſtance of the Argument is this, in ſhort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Publick Credit</hi> is the Conſequence of honourable, juſt, and punctual Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Matter of <hi>Funds</hi> and <hi>Taxes,</hi> or Loans upon them. Where this goes before, Credit always follows.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>This Management</hi> depends not upon the Well-Executing their Offices, by the great Officers of the Treaſury, and the Exchequer, but on the <hi>Care, Conduct</hi> and <hi>Vigilance</hi> of her Majeſty and the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; <hi>the latter</hi> in Eſtabliſhing ſufficient Funds; and <hi>the former</hi> in Placing able Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and obliging them to an honourable Management.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Publick Credit</hi> therefore depends upon the Queen and Parliament entirely, and not at all upon the well or ill Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of the Officers, of what kind ſoever.</p>
            <p>Another thing confirms this, <hi>(viz.)</hi> That while the Parliament Concerns it ſelf to prevent the Deficiency of Funds, and the Queen to Place Men of Probity and Honour in the Government of her Treaſury; <hi>there is no Queſtion to be made,</hi> but both would concern themſelves <hi>upon any Complaints of the Subject,</hi> to enquire into any Miſmanagement or Abuſe of the People, in the greateſt Officers; and not only puniſh the Offender, but <hi>prevent the</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0019500400:20"/>
               <hi>Offence,</hi> by removing ſuch Officer, and ſupplying his Place with others, who ſhould better diſcharge ſo weighty a Truſt. This reſolves the Point, That Credit centers where the Government centers; for if the Sovereign diſplaces thoſe that miſ-apply, the Wound to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit heals of it ſelf; and while the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign carefully prefers Men of Honour and Probity in the Nations Truſt, Credit riſes by a natural Conſequence.</p>
            <p>But ſtill it is the NATIONS CRE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DIT; <hi>that is,</hi> it is built on the Honour of the Queen and Parliament, as above; and this has been the Caſe of the late Lord Treaſurer; the Credit of whoſe Management muſt return to the Queen, as to the Center; otherwiſe this muſt be call'd <hi>My Lord T . . . .'s Credit,</hi> not the <hi>Nations;</hi> and, to our great loſs, muſt dye with his Lordſhip; which would be very unhappy <hi>for us;</hi> and would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, that we ought to be more concern'd for his Lordſhip's long Life than the Queen's; a thing would very ill pleaſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Lordſhip to ſuggeſt.</p>
            <p>Having laid down this as a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, I build this ſhort Fabrick upon it, <hi>(viz.) That as</hi> the Publick Credit is <hi>National,</hi> not <hi>Perſonal,</hi> ſo it depends upon No <hi>thing</hi> or <hi>Perſon,</hi> No <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Body of</hi>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:0019500400:21"/>
               <hi>Men,</hi> but upon the Government, <hi>that is,</hi> The Queen and Parliament; diſplacing or removing any Miniſter of State, or great Officer, whoſe Management under the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign affects our Treaſure, can no way influence our <hi>National Credit;</hi> while the Juſt, Honourable and Punctual Conduct of the Sovereign and Parliament remains the ſame. Neither does our Credit de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the Perſon of the Queen, <hi>as Queen,</hi> or the individual Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, <hi>Identically;</hi> as if <hi>no Queen</hi> but her preſent Majeſty, and <hi>no Parliament</hi> but the preſent Parliament, could ſupport and uphold the Credit of the Nation: <hi>But</hi> it will remain a Truth, that <hi>every Queen,</hi> or <hi>every King,</hi> and <hi>every Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> ſucceeding the Preſent, that ſhall diſcover the <hi>ſame Juſtice</hi> in Government, the <hi>ſame Care</hi> in giving ſufficient Funds, the <hi>ſame Honeſty</hi> in ſupplying the Defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies if they happen, <hi>the ſame</hi> Concern for the Burthen of the Subject, and <hi>the ſame</hi> Care to put the Treaſure into the Hands of Faithful and Experienc'd Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; ſhall keep up <hi>the ſame</hi> Character, have <hi>the ſame</hi> Credit, and reſtore all theſe Declinings to <hi>the ſame</hi> Vigour and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude, as ever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0019500400:22"/>
               <hi>From hence it appears,</hi> That our preſent Loſs of <hi>Credit</hi> does not ariſe from any Doubt, whether the like Conduct can produce this Effect or no; but from a ſtrange Suggeſtion, That a new Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a new Miniſtry, ſhall either <hi>not Deſign</hi> or not <hi>Purſue</hi> the ſame vigorous and wiſe Reſolutions, or mannage with <hi>the ſame</hi> Integrity, as the laſt have done. If her Majeſty ſaw room ſor this Suggeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I make no doubt, (her Concern for the Publick Good <hi>is ſuch</hi>) that no ſuch Change had been made, or would lodge an Hour longer among her Thoughts; but if her Majeſty is of the Opinion, that ſuch a Change will not leſſen the Concern <hi>for,</hi> or juſt Meaſures <hi>in</hi> the Publick Service, then the Difficulty ends. Her Majeſty has now put new Officers into her Treaſury: No doubt her Majeſty <hi>is ſatisfied</hi> it ſhall be in their Power to preſerve the <hi>Publick Credit,</hi> and reſtore it to as great a height as ever it was before, And I will preſume to add, That if her Majeſty ſhould find it other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it wouldbe an effectual Motive to <hi>far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Changes</hi> till ſuch Hands ſhould be found, in whoſe Conduct the <hi>National Credit</hi> could not Miſcarry.</p>
            <p>It ſeems that the preſent Diſcontents are grounded upon <hi>a Suppoſition,</hi> That a New Miniſtry ſhall be leſs zealous for
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0019500400:23"/>
the Publick Intereſt, than the preſent; or, at leaſt, the Objectors argue, that her Majeſty has ſufficient Experience of the Zeal of the preſent Miniſtry, <hi>for her Service,</hi> and for the Public Good; and therefore it cannot ſeem rational to run that Riſque, and the like, of a New Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament.</p>
            <p>To this may be anſwer'd; Why ſhould it be ſuggeſted, that a New Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament ſhall not be equally zealous for the Liberties of <hi>Britain</hi> with the preſent? They are to be choſen by the Freeholders, they are to be Engliſhmen; they are to be Proteſtants; they are to abjure the Pretender; they are to be join'd with <hi>the ſame</hi> Houſe of Lords, to be bleſſed with <hi>the ſame</hi> Queen; and the Queen, I doubt not, fill'd with <hi>the ſame</hi> Principles as before; <hi>the ſame</hi> by which her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, for I muſt place it there, <hi>reſtor'd the Nations Credit before,</hi> and raiſed it to what we have now ſeen it.</p>
            <p>Shall we ſay, The Parliament will not raiſe Money to carry on the War? This would be to ſay, We ſhall chooſe ſuch a Parliament as will <hi>declare the Pretender, forſake</hi> the Confederacy, <hi>join</hi> with the Common Enemy, and <hi>Depoſe</hi> the Queen. Theſe are Fears no thinking Man can ſuppoſe to be rational; and are ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0019500400:24"/>
by none <hi>but thoſe</hi> that deſire it ſhould be ſo; and who, crying out loudeſt of the Fall of <hi>Public Credit,</hi> procure the thing they complain of; and indeed we have no Breach of <hi>our Credit,</hi> but what riſes from theſe Men.</p>
            <p>To back their Fears, and make others think them reaſonable, they give long Accounts of the Progreſs of Dr. <hi>Sacheve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell,</hi> as if the Folly and Impolitick Vanity of that Gentleman could influence the People of <hi>England,</hi> to ſend up Men as <hi>mad</hi> and <hi>fooliſh</hi> as himſelf: I muſt profeſs to think, if Dr. <hi>Sacheverell</hi> thinks he ſerves the Intereſt he pretends to appear for, by his mobbing and riotous Progreſs, he is as much miſtaken <hi>as they were,</hi> who made him Popular by a haſty Proſecution, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of committing his Sermon to the Hang-Man, and kicking him from the Bar for a Lunatic; which if they had done, the Nation had been more in Debt to <hi>their Prudence,</hi> than I think they are now for <hi>their Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am againſt Furies on both ſides; nor do I ſee any ſuch coming in: If her Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty does let in any ſuch, <hi>I dare preſume to ſay,</hi> it muſt be for want of having their due Character; and the Term of their Services may probably end when they diſcover themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0019500400:25"/>
But if Men of Moderation, and Men of Integrity come in, I ſee no room to fear, but <hi>our Credit</hi> ſhall revive as well under a New Miniſtry as an Old.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I know,</hi> that ſome talk of a Stagnation of the Fountain; that there is a Famine of Funds; that the Nation is exhauſted, and we are at a full Stop: This I take to be <hi>an Amuſement,</hi> that comes over from <hi>France,</hi> and is calculated very much for the Service of the Enemy. But there are ways to get over the Difficulty, and the beſt way is Demonſtration and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; I believe the <hi>French</hi> King does not raiſe half ſo much Hopes from our not being able to find any Funds at all, as from our being at a loſs for Credit to borrow upon thoſe Funds when they are raiſed; and he may live to be deceived in both.</p>
            <p>But to obviate theſe things, <hi>I take the liberty to ſay,</hi> and that not without-book, When the Parliament meets, be it the preſent Parliament, or a new Parliament; be it the preſent Miniſtry, or a new Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; as I hope there will not want Zeal in the Members, to ſupply her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Occaſions for the War; ſo were this War to hold Seven Years longer, it is eaſy to propoſe ſufficient Funds for the carrying it on, without that horrid Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of mortgaging our <hi>Land-Tax,</hi> or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0019500400:26"/>
any <hi>ſuch Taxes,</hi> as ſhall either be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſom to the Poor, or ſcandalous to the Nation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>As to Credit,</hi> while the Parliament and the Queen continue to preſerve thoſe Funds from Deficiencies, to make good ſuch as happen, and to ſupport the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour and Honour of the Publick Manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I ſee no room to doubt, but <hi>Credit</hi> ſhall revive, and as we have not yet found any Fund the Parliament has rais'd, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupply'd with Loans and Advances upon it, even faſter than could be deſired; ſo I can ſee no room to fear the contrary: Yet if ſuch a Thing ſhould happen, a mean Head may find out ſome Expedient that may not be ineffectual; for a Supply of which, if there ſhould be Occaſion, a Propoſal ſhall not be wanting.</p>
