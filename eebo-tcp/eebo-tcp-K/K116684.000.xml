            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>WE are not to do evil that good may come of it, elſe I might plead in favour of the following little poem, that, whatever its faults may be, it was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken and purſued with a laudable deſign. The ridiculouſneſs, not to ſay barbarity, of turning SHAKESPEAR's plays into operas, and larding them with ſongs from quite different authors, as hath been lately prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed upon our moſt juſtly approved the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre, is, I apprehend, of ſo glaring a nature, that every one, who is endued with the ſmalleſt ſpark of taſte, muſt immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately be ſtruck with it. It is indeed the ſame thing, as if any perſon ſhould take it into
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0618702400:4"/>
his head to reduce one of our antient Goth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ick cathedrals to a modern ſummer-houſe, and ornament it with deſigns from Half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penny's Chineſe architecture. Such is the devaſtation and overturning! ſuch are the breaks and patches!</p>
            <p>There is no man in England, I believe, who has greater reſpect for a piece of beef<note n="*" place="bottom">A thing to which Shakeſpear has been more than once compared.</note> than I have; but ſhould I therefore like it cut into mince meat, and mixed with my cuſtard and apple-pie? Certainly, no: the impropriety of the olio would then diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt me. So do the vigorous lines of SHAKESPEAR, when I meet them haſhed up, with Waller and Cowley, in the luſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous compoſitions of a muſical entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>If we muſt have Engliſh operas, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what of leſs value, and at the ſame time better calculated for the end propoſed, might, I thought, be made uſe of. But
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0618702400:5"/>
many people will aſk, what occaſion is there that we ſhould have Engliſh operas at all? Let any common lover of muſick go but once to the King's theatre in the Hay-market, and he will eaſily perceive, that the Italian compoſition does, and muſt, with all its inconſiſtencies, for ever excel any thing we can produce of the like nature; and this, not for want of abilities in our compoſers, but thro' the inſuperable diſadvantages of our language. Had I ſeen any of their muſical dramas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I undertook this, LEUCOTHÖE ſhould never have been written: but ſince it is done, and cannot be recalled, I hope I ſhall be pardoned, if I am willing to try, whether it may not be borne as a juvenile attempt at poetry; tho' I have not been ſollicitous to have it accompanied with the graces of that harmony for which it was originally intended.</p>
            <p>A French poetaſter would have ſent ſuch a <hi>petit piece</hi> into the world with the
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0618702400:6"/>
title of <hi>Tragedie</hi>; but the Author of this hath not been long enough of the trade to acquire ſo much confidence. Opera he muſt not call it, becauſe it ſhould then end happily, which the diſpoſition of his fable would not admit of: he therefore lets it go under the denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a DRAMATIC POEM. But becauſe it is, ſave in that one inſtance of its ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe, an opera, he begs leave to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join what one of the firſt Engliſh poets hath written of that ſpecies of the drama; which will be ſufficient to ſhew, that, if he has failed in it, it is what a greater genius might have done; and, if he has ſucceeded, it is what the greateſt genius has not been aſhamed to think worthy of his accompliſhing.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"An opera, [ſays Mr. DRYDEN, in his preface to ALBION and ALBANUS] is a poetical tale or fiction, repreſented by vocal and inſtrumental muſick, adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſcenes, machines, and dancing.
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0618702400:7"/>
The ſuppoſed perſons of this muſical drama are generally ſupernatural, as gods and goddeſſes, and heroes, which at leaſt are deſcended from them, and are in due time to be adopted of their number. The ſubject, therefore, being extended beyond the limits of human nature, admits of that ſort of marvel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous which is rejected in other plays. Human impoſſibilities are to be received as they are in faith, becauſe, where the Gods are introduced, a Supreme Power is underſtood, and ſecond cauſes are out of doors.—If the perſons repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented were to ſpeak upon the ſtage, it would follow of neceſſity, that the expreſſions ſhould be lofty, figurative, and majeſtical. But the nature of an opera denies the frequent uſe of thoſe poetical ornaments; for vocal muſick, tho' it often admits a loftineſs of ſound, yet always exacts an harmonious ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or, to diſtinguiſh yet more juſtly,
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0618702400:8"/>
the recitative part of the opera requires a more maſculine beauty of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ſound: the other, which, for want of a properer word, I muſt call the ſongiſh part, muſt abound in ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and variety of numbers; its prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal intention being to pleaſe the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, rather than gratify the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</q>
He ends all, after having given the preference to the Italian opera, thus:
<q rend="inline margQuotes">"If I thought it convenient, I could here diſcover ſome rules which I have given to myſelf in writing an opera in general, and in this opera in particular: but I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, that the effect would only be, to have my own performance meaſured by the laws I gave, and conſequently ſet up little judges, who, not underſtanding thoroughly, would be ſure to fall upon the faults, and not to acknowledge any of the beauties. Here, therefore, if they will criticiſe, they ſhall do it out of their own fund; but let them be aſſured,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0618702400:9"/>
that their ears are nice, for there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther writing nor judging on this ſubject without that good quality. It is no eaſy matter, in our language, to make words ſo ſmooth, and numbers ſo harmonious, that they ſhall almoſt ſet themſelves; and yet there are rules for this in nature, and as great a certainty and quantity in our ſyllables, as either in the Greek or Latin. But let poets and judges under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this firſt, and then let them begin to ſtudy Engliſh. When they have chewed a while upon theſe preliminaries, it may be they will ſcarce adventure to tax me with want of thought and elevation of fancy in this work; for they will ſoon be ſatisfied that thoſe are not the nature of this ſort of writing. The neceſſity of double rhimes, and ordering of the words and numbers for the ſweetneſs of the voice, are the main hinges on which an opera muſt move; and both of theſe are without the compaſs of any art to
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0618702400:10"/>
teach another to perform, unleſs Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the firſt place has done her part, by enduing the poet with nicety of hearing, that the diſcord of ſounds in words ſhall as much offend him as a ſeventh in muſic would a good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer. I have therefore no need to make excuſes for meanneſs of thought in many places. The Italians, with all the advantages of their language, are continually forced on it, or rather they affect it. The chief ſecret is in the choice of words; and by this choice I do not mean elegancy of expreſſion, but propriety of ſound, to be varied according to the nature of the ſubject.—The ſame reaſons which depreſs thought in an opera, have a ſtronger effect upon the words, eſpecially in our language; for there is no maintaining the purity of Engliſh in ſhort meaſures, where the rhime returns ſo quick, and is ſo often female or double rhime;
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0618702400:11"/>
which is not natural to our tongue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it conſiſts too much of monoſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lables, and thoſe too moſt commonly clogged with conſonants; for which reaſon I am often forced to coin new words, revive ſome that are antiquated, and botch others.</q>

            <p>LEUCOTHÖE, daughter of ORCHAMUS King of Perſia, is beloved, and ſecretly enjoyed by the SUN; when CLYTIE, a former miſtreſs of his, becomes acquainted with their amour, and, in the rage of jealouſy, makes a full diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of it to the Lady's father. ORCHAMUS, as a puniſhment for his daughter's crime, orders her to be buried alive; which is accordingly executed in her lover's abſence; who, coming too late to give her any aſſiſtance, firſt changes her body into a tree of frankincenſe, and then CLYTIE, the cauſe of her misfortune, into a ſtatue.</p>
            <p>This is the chief ſubject-matter of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing rhimes. In OVID we are told that CLYTIE was metamorphoſed into a ſun-flower: but the Author hopes he need not make any apology for deviating from his original in that particular, any more than for ſome other trifling circumſtances which he has taken the liberty to vary, and others which he has entirely omitted as foreign to his purpoſe.</p>
