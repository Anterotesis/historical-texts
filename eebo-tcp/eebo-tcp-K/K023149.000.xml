            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IT has been judg'd, that to clear an
Affair which ſeem'd at firſt ſight a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle

as a <hi>Curioſity,</hi> but uſeful as a
<hi>Warning,</hi> and perhaps flagrant enough as
an <hi>Example,</hi> to induce the LEGISLATURE
to prevent for the future, an Enormity ſo
prejudicial to every private Subject, and ſo
deſtructive of Society it ſelf.</p>
            <p>This will be made ſo plain by the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing
Papers, that 'twill ſcarce be needful to
attend them with any Reflections, more
than what every Reader may make.</p>

In the Year 1727, <hi>Edmund Curl,</hi> Book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller,

            <p>Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi> was acquainted with one

                  <p>AFTER ſo long a Silence, as the
many and great Oppreſſions I have
ſigh'd under has occaſion'd, one is at a
Loſs how to begin a Letter to ſo kind a
Friend as your ſelf. But as it was always
my Reſolution, if I muſt ſink to do it as
decently (that is as ſilently) as I could: So
when I found my ſelf plung'd into unfore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen,
and unavoidable Ruin, I retreated
from the World, and in a manner buried
my ſelf in a diſmal Place, where I knew
none, nor none knew me. In this dull
unthinking Way, I have protracted a lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0646000300:6"/>
Death (for Life it cannot be called)
ever ſince you ſaw me, ſequeſtered from
Company, deprived of my Books, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
left to converſe with but the Letters
of my dead, or abſent Friends, amongſt
which latter I always placed yours, and
Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s in the firſt Rank. I lent ſome
of them indeed to an ingenious Perſon,
who was ſo delighted with the Specimen,
that he importun'd me for a Sight of the
reſt, which having obtain'd, he conveyed
them to the Preſs, I muſt not ſay altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
with my Conſent, nor wholly without
it. I thought them too good to be loſt in
Oblivion, and no Cauſe to apprehend the
diſobliging of any. The Publick, <hi>viz.</hi>
All Perſons of Taſte and Judgment,
would be pleaſed with ſo agreeable an
Amuſement; Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi> could not be
angry, ſince it was but Juſtice to his Merit,
to publiſh the ſolemn and private Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of Love, Gratitude and Veneration,
made to him by ſo celebrated an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;
and ſurely Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> ought not to
reſent the Publication, ſince the early Preg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nancy
of his Genius was no diſhonour to
his Character. And yet had either of you
been ask'd, common Modeſty would have
oblig'd you to refuſe what you would not
have been diſpleas'd with if done without
your Knowledge; and beſides, to end all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0646000300:7"/>
Diſpute, you had been pleaſed to make me
a free Gift of them to do what I pleaſed
with them: And every one knows that a
Perſon to whom a Letter is addreſs'd, has
the ſame Right to diſpoſe of it, as he has
of Goods purchaſed with his Money. I
doubt not but your Generoſity and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
will do me the Right of owning by a
Line that I came honeſtly by them. I flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

                  <p>WHEN theſe Letters were firſt
printed, I wonder'd how <hi>Curl</hi> could
come by them, and could not but laugh
at the pompous Title; ſince whatever you
wrote to me was Humour and familiar
Raillery. As ſoon as I came from <hi>Epſom,</hi>
I heard you had been to ſee me, and I
writ you a ſhort Letter from <hi>Will</hi>'s, that
I long'd to ſee you. Mr. <hi>D—s</hi> about
that time charg'd me with giving them to
a Miſtreſs, which I poſitively denied; not
in the leaſt, at that time, thinking of it:
But ſome time after finding in the News-Papers,
Letters from Lady <hi>Packington,</hi>
Lady <hi>Chudleigh,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Norris,</hi> to the
ſame <hi>Sapho,</hi> or <hi>E. T.</hi> I began to fear that
I was guilty. I have never ſeen theſe Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
of <hi>Curl</hi>'s, nor would go to his Shop
about them; I have not ſeen this <hi>Sapho,</hi>
alias <hi>E. T.</hi> theſe ſeven Years;—her
writing, <hi>That I gave her them to do what ſhe
would with them,</hi> was ſtraining the Point
too far: I thought not of it; nor do I
think ſhe did then: But ſevere Neceſſity,
which catches hold of a Twig, has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0646000300:9"/>
all this; which has lain hid, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>got
by me, ſo many Years. <hi>Curl</hi> ſent me
a Letter laſt Week, deſiring a poſitive An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer
about this Matter, but finding I would
give him none, he went to <hi>E. T.</hi> and writ
a Poſtſcript, in her long romantick Letter,
to direct my Anſwer to his Houſe, but
they not expecting an Anſwer, ſent a young
Man to me, whoſe Name it ſeems is <hi>Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſſon;</hi>
I told him I ſhould not write any
thing, but I believed it might be ſo as ſhe
writ in her Letter. I am extreamly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd

ſatisfied; left any Doubt ſhould reſt upon
your Mind. I could not make Proteſtations
of my Innocence of a grievous Crime; but
I was impatient till I came to Town, that
I might ſend you thoſe Letters, as a clear
Evidence, that I was a perfect Stranger to
all their Proceedings. Should I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted
againſt it, after the Printing, it
might have been taken for an Attempt to
decry his Purchaſe; and as the little Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
you have taken, has ſerv'd him to
play his Game upon us for theſe two Years;
a new Incident from me might enable him
to play it on for two more:—The great
Value ſhe expreſſes for all you write, and
her Paſſion for having them, I believe was
what prevailed upon me to let her keep
them. By the Interval of twelve Years at
leaſt, from her Poſſeſſion to the Time of
printing them, 'tis manifeſt that I had not
the leaſt Ground to apprehend ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign:
But as People in great Straits, bring

valuable Jewels, ſo <hi>Sapho</hi> had recourſe to
her hid Treaſure of Letters, and plaid off,
not only yours to me, but all thoſe to
her ſelf (as the Ladies laſt Stake) into the
Preſs.—As for me, I hope, when you
ſhall cooly conſider the many thouſand
Inſtances of our being deluded by Females,

            <p>This Treatment being extreamly diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
to Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> he was adviſed to recal
any Letters which might happen to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
by any of his Friends, particularly
thoſe written to Perſons deceas'd, which
would be moſt ſubject to ſuch an Accident.
Many of theſe were return'd him.</p>
            <p>Some of his Friends adviſed him to print
a Collection himſelf, to prevent a worſe;
but this he would by no means agree to.
However, as ſome of the Letters ſerved to
revive ſeveral paſt Scenes of Friendſhip, and
others to clear the Truth of <hi>Facts</hi> in which
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0646000300:12"/>
he had been miſrepreſented by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Scribblers, he was induced to preſerve
a few of his own Letters, as well as of his
Friends. Theſe, as I have been told, he
inſerted in TWO BOOKS, ſome Originals,
others Copies, with a few Notes and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
here and there added. In the ſame
Books he cauſed to be copied ſome ſmall
Pieces in Verſe and Proſe, either of his own,
or his Correſpondents; which, tho' not fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
enough for the Publick, were ſuch
as the Partiality of any Friend would be
ſorry to be depriv'd of.</p>
            <p>To this Purpoſe, an Amanuenſis or two
were employ'd by Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi> when the
Books were in the Country, and by the
Earl of <hi>Oxford,</hi> when they were in Town.</p>
            <p>It happen'd ſoon after, that the <hi>Poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humous
Works</hi> of Mr. <hi>Wycherly</hi> were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd,
in ſuch a Manner, as could no way
increaſe the Reputation of that Gentleman,
who had been Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s firſt Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
and Friend; And ſeveral of theſe
Letters ſo fully ſhew'd the State of that
Caſe, that it was thought but a Juſtice to
Mr. <hi>Wycherly</hi>'s Memory to print a few, to
diſcredit that Impoſition. Theſe were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly
tranſcrib'd for the Preſs from the
<hi>Manuſcript Books</hi> above-mention'd.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0646000300:13"/>
They were no ſooner printed, but <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund
Curl</hi> look'd on theſe too as his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty;
for a Copy is extant, which he
corrected in order to another Impreſſion,
interlin'd, and added marginal Notes to,
in his own Hand.</p>
            <p>He then advertis'd anew the Letters to Mr.
<hi>Cromwell,</hi> with <hi>Additions,</hi> and promis'd In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement
to all Perſons who ſhould ſend
him more.</p>
            <p>This is a Practice frequent with Bookſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers,
to ſwell an Author's Works, in which
they have ſome Property, with any Traſh
that can be got from any Hand; or where
they have no ſuch Works, to procure ſome.
<hi>Curl</hi> has in the ſame manner ſince adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiz'd
the <hi>Letters</hi> of Mr. <hi>Prior,</hi> and Mr.
<hi>Addiſon.</hi> A Practice highly deſerving ſome
Check from the Legiſlature; ſince every
ſuch Advertiſement, is really a <hi>Watch-word</hi>
to every <hi>Scoundrel</hi> in the Nation, and to
every <hi>Domeſtick</hi> of a Family, to get a Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,
by producing any Scrap of a Man's Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,
(of what Nature ſoever) or by picking
his Maſter's Pocket of Letters and Papers.</p>
            <p>A moſt flagrant Inſtance of this kind
was the Advertiſement of an intended Book,
call'd <hi>Gulliveriana Secunda;</hi> where it was
promis'd <q rend="inline margQuotes">"that <hi>any Thing,</hi> which <hi>any Body</hi>
ſhould ſend as Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s or Dr. <hi>Swift</hi>'s,
ſhould be printed and inſerted <hi>as Theirs.</hi>"</q>

            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:0646000300:14"/>
By theſe honeſt means, Mr. <hi>Curl</hi> went on
encreaſing his Collection; and finding (as
will be ſeen hereafter by No. 5.) a further
Proſpect of doing ſo, he retarded his Edition
of Mr. <hi>Cromwell</hi>'s Letters till the Twenty-Second
of March 1734-5. and then ſent
Mr. <hi>Pope</hi> the following Letter, the firſt he
ever receiv'd from him.</p>

Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Friends imagin'd that the

to look on the Edition of <hi>Cromwel</hi>'s Letters,
and ſo to print it as <hi>revis'd</hi> by Mr. <hi>Pope,</hi>

Book</hi> to a <hi>Reverend Biſhop,</hi> and then Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertis'd
it as <hi>corrected</hi> and <hi>revis'd</hi> by him.
Or if there was any ſuch Propoſal from <hi>P. T.
Curl</hi> would not fail to embrace it, perhaps
pay for the Copy with the very Mony he
might draw from Mr. <hi>P—</hi> to ſuppreſs it,

inform you, I can ſend you diverſe Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs
which may be ſerviceable, if your
Deſign be really to do him neither Injuſtice,
nor ſhew him Favour. I was well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with his Father, and with the firſt
part of his own Life, tho' ſince he has
treated me as a Stranger. It is certain
ſome late Pamphlets are not fair in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect
to his Father, who was of the youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger
Branch of a Family in good Repute in
<hi>Ireland,</hi> and related to the Lords <hi>Downe,</hi>
formerly of the ſame Name. He was (as
he hath told me himſelf, and he was [very
different from his Son] a modeſt and plain
honeſt Man) a Poſthumous Son, and left
little provided for, his elder Brother having
what ſmall Eſtate there was, who afterwards
Study'd and dy'd at <hi>Oxford.</hi> He was put
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0646000300:20"/>
to a Merchant in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and acquir'd a
moderate Fortune by Merchandize, which
he quitted at the Revolution in very good
Circumſtances, and retir'd to <hi>Windſor</hi> For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt,
where he purchas'd a ſmall Eſtate, and
took great Delight in Husbandry and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens.
His Mother was one of ſeventeen
Children of <hi>W. Turnor</hi> 
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> formerly of
<hi>Burfit Hall</hi> in the—Riding of <hi>Yorkſhire.</hi>
Two of her Brothers were kill'd in the
Civil Wars. This is a true Account of
Mr. <hi>Pope</hi>'s Family and Parentage. Of
his Manners I cannot give ſo good an one,
yet as I would not wrong any Man, both
ought to be True; and if ſuch be your

                  <p>The Second of your Letters of <hi>Nov.

the Originals ſhould be forthwith ſent me,

hope Mr. <hi>Curl</hi> will print it; if not, it can
only be for this Reaſon, That as it preceded
their Quarrel but one Day, it proves the

                  <p>I Am juſt again going to the Lords to finiſh
<hi>Pope.</hi> I deſire you to ſend me the Sheets
to perfect the firſt fifty Books, and likewiſe
the remaining three hundred Books, and
pray be at the <hi>Standard</hi> Tavern this Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and I will pay you twenty pounds more.
My Defence is right, I only told the Lords,
I did not know from whence the Books
came, and that my Wife receiv'd them.
This was ſtrict Truth, and prevented all
further Enquiry. The <hi>Lords declar'd</hi> they
had been made <hi>Pope</hi>'s <hi>Tool.</hi> I put my
ſelf upon this ſingle Point, and inſiſted, as
there was not any Peer's Letter in the Book,
I had not been guilty of any Breach of Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege.
<hi>—Lord</hi> DELAWAR <hi>will be in the
Chair by Ten this Morning,</hi> and the Houſe
will be up before Three.—I depend that
the Books and the Imperfections will be
ſent, and believe of <hi>P. T.</hi> what I hope he
believes of me.</p>

The Book was this Day produc'd, and it
appearing that, contrary to the Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
there were no Letters of Lords con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
in it, and conſequently not falling un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the Order of the Houſe, the Books were
re-deliver'd.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time <hi>Curl</hi> produc'd, and

Letter</hi> of <hi>P. T.</hi> which ſeems extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary,
unleſs they had begun to quarrel about
<hi>Profits</hi> before that Day. But after it, it is

them, and ſo get the whole Impreſſion to

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>1. I Am falſly accus'd, 2. I value not any
Man's Change of Temper; I will
never change MY VERACITY for Falſhood,
in owning a Fact of which I am Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent.
3. I did not own the Books came
from <hi>acroſs the Water,</hi> nor ever <hi>nam'd
you,</hi> all I ſaid was, that the Books came
<hi>by Water.</hi> 4. When the Books were
ſeiz'd I ſent my Son to convey a Letter
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0646000300:36"/>
to you, and as you told me every body
knew you in <hi>Southwark,</hi> I bid him make
a <hi>ſtrict Enquiry,</hi> as I am ſure you wou'd
have done in ſuch an Exigency. 5. Sir I
HAVE ACTED JUSTLY in this Affair, and that
is what I ſhall always think wiſely. 6. I
will be kept no longer in the Dark: <hi>P. T.</hi>
is <hi>Will o' the Wiſp;</hi> all the Books I have
had are Imperfect; the Firſt 50 had no
Titles nor Prefaces, the laſt 5 Bundles
ſeiz'd by the Lords contain'd but 38 in
each Bundle, which amounts to 190, and
50, is in all but 240 Books. 7. As to the
Loſs of a Future Copy, I deſpiſe it, nor
will I be concern'd with any more ſuch
dark ſuſpicious Dealers. But now Sir I'll
tell you what I will do; when I have
the Books perfected which I have already
receiv'd, and the reſt of the Impreſſion
I will pay you for them. But what do
you call this Uſage? Firſt take a Note
for a Month and then want it to be chang'd
for one of Sir <hi>Richard Hoare</hi>'s—My
Note is as good, for any Sum I give it, as
the BANK, and ſhall be as punctually paid.
I always ſay, <hi>Gold is better than Paper,</hi>
and 20 <hi>l.</hi> I will pay, if the Books are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to morrow Morning, and the reſt
ſent, or to Night is the ſame thing to me.
But if this dark converſe goes on, I will
Inſtantly <hi>reprint the whole Book,</hi> and as
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0646000300:37"/>
a Supplement to it, <hi>all the Letters</hi> P. T.
<hi>ever ſent me,</hi> of which I have <hi>exact copies;</hi>
together with <hi>all your Originals,</hi> and give
them in upon Oath to my Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor.
You talk of <hi>Truſt; P. T.</hi> has not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd
any in me, for he has my Mony and
Notes for imperfect Books. Let me ſee,
Sir, either <hi>P. T.</hi> or your ſelf, or you'll
