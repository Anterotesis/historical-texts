            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A LETTER TO THE PEOPLE OF SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p>IT hath for a conſiderable time been the reproach of Scotland, that her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants have been deſtitute of public ſpirit, and have felt themſelves merely as a number of individuals, to whom no meaſure of ſtate was of any conſequence, unleſs ſo far as it affected their private intereſts. The reign of his preſent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty has been troubled with a ſeries of faction, hurtful to government at home, and ruinous to the Britiſh power abroad: But all the while Scotland has remained in cold indifference; and each adminiſtration, of whatever principles, has been ſure of our acquieſcence at
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0533402100:4"/>
leaſt, if not of our ſupport, as a matter of courſe.</p>
            <p>The flagrant injuſtice of the Houſe of Commons, in the caſe of the Middle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſex election, by which a precedent was eſtabliſhed for violating the valuable pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege of all the electors of Great Britain, was no more regarded in Scotland than any ordinary vote in that Houſe. It has ſince been reſcinded, not indeed by the ſame Parliament, but by almoſt the ſame members: So that it may be ſaid with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out offence, that the Houſe of Commons is at no time infallible.</p>
            <p>The claim of the Britiſh Parliament to tax the American colonies, or, in other words, that his Majeſty's ſubjects in Great Britain ſhould command the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of his Majeſty's ſubjects in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, was almoſt univerſally approved of in Scotland, where due conſideration was had of the advantage of raiſing regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I was one of the few who, as far as my voice could go, ventured to oppoſe it, both as unjuſt and inexpedient:—Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0533402100:5"/>
becauſe I thought the people of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, as participant of the Britiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, ſhould no more be taxed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the conſent of their repreſentatives, than the people of Ireland, or the people of Great Britain:—Inexpedient, becauſe I did not think it poſſible for this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to prevail, unleſs one of two propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, utterly improbable, but induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly circulated, were true: The <hi>firſt,</hi> that a whole people were cowards; the <hi>ſecond,</hi> that a whole people were willing that their all ſhould be at the unconditional mercy of another people. My intimacy with the excellent and much honoured General Oglethorpe, who himſelf ſettled one of the American colonies, and ſtill lives with all his faculties and all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence in full vigour<note n="*" place="bottom">General Oglethorpe, now the Father of the Britiſh army, being the oldeſt General, but without emolument, ſettled the Colony of Georgia. Pope thus celebrates him.
<q>
                     <l>"Or driven by ſtrong benevolence of ſoul,</l>
                     <l>"Will fly like Oglethorpe from pole to pole."</l>
                  </q>
               </note>, confirmed me
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0533402100:6"/>
in my opinion; and when pleading at the bar of the Houſe of Commons, in a queſtion concerning taxation, I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed that opinion, declaring that the man in the world for whom I have the higheſt reſpect<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr Johnſon.</note>, had not been able to convince me that <hi>Taxation</hi> was <hi>no Tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</hi> My principles being of a Tory caſt, that is to ſay, thoſe of a ſteady Royaliſt, it grieved me to the heart, that our moſt gracious Sovereign ſhould be adviſed by evil counſellors to aſſent to ſevere mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures againſt an immenſe body of his ſubjects, who were willing faithfully to ſubmit themſelves to the King as ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme,—to the father of all his people;—but not to his ſubjects, their brethren, with whom they were entitled to equal privileges.</p>
            <p>It appeared to me, that <hi>Miniſtry</hi> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on the war againſt our colonies, chiefly in the hope that if they ſhould be ſubdued, a multitude of offices might
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0533402100:7"/>
be created, the diſpoſal of which would abſolutely ſecure a majority in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon every occaſion; and for that reaſon, had there been no other, every friend to rational freedom muſt have abhorred the deſign. The ſlavery ſpread over the continent of America, would have reverberated upon Britain. The right of the people to ſupply or to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold money, is the great check upon the executive power; and in <hi>that</hi> conſiſts the chief excellence of our free government.</p>
            <p>A ſtrong party in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, oppoſed that baleful adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which perſevered in the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can war, and oppoſed it with ſuch vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, as at length to obtain a vote in the Houſe of Commons, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Crown has increaſed, is increaſing, and ought to be diminiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;"</q> the truth of which vote, in this democratical reign, I leave to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of every candid man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0533402100:8"/>
I would wiſh, in all queſtions of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional concern, not to regard men, but meaſures; and therefore, I ſhall make no remarks upon that extraordinary fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of Miniſters whom we have ſince ſeen, like the viſions of Macbeth:
<q>
                  <l>"Come like ſhadows, ſo depart."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But I earneſtly entreat the attention of my countrymen, to the alarming attempt which has been recently made, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the ſecurity of private property, and annihilate the conſtitutional mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy of theſe kingdoms, under the pretext of <q rend="inline margQuotes">"better regulating the affairs of the Eaſt-India Company."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Harſh and abuſive expreſſions can do no good, and are very foreign from the intention of this Letter, which is not to kindle a wild rage, but to rouſe a ſteady ſpirit. I ſhall therefore abſtain from uſing thoſe epithets which have, with juſtice, been applied to the bill for veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the affairs of the Eaſt-India Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany in certain Commiſſioners. But I
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0533402100:9"/>
will ſay, that I look upon this bill as the moſt dangerous meaſure to the country that ever yet was hazarded in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conſider it in both the views which I have mentioned, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> As affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing property; and, 2<hi>dly,</hi> As affecting the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>And, 1<hi>ſt,</hi> As to <hi>Property,</hi> the bill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the ſaid Commiſſioners ſhall immediately enter into, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs themſelves of all lands, tenements, houſes, ware-houſes, and other build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings whatever, belonging to the ſaid Company, and all books, records, char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, &amp;c. and all ſhips and veſſels, goods, wares, merchandiſes, money, ſecurities for money, and all other ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects whatſoever; and the Directors of the ſaid Company, and all officers and ſervants thereof, are hereby injoined, immediately upon the requiſition of the ſaid Commiſſioners, to deliver to them, or to ſuch perſons as they ſhall
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0533402100:10"/>
appoint, the ſeveral matters aforemen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Can a more tremenduous exerciſe of arbitrary power be figured than this?—That a great Company which has ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for above two centuries, under the ſanction of charters from the Crown, ſhould all at once not only be deprived of the territorial power, which it has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, and which has no doubt been flagitiouſly abuſed by ſome of its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants; but have all its effects, in all parts of the world, abſtracted from its own care and management, and delivered up to a ſet of men not of its own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There is ſomething in this ſo ſhocking to the firſt notions of property and juſtice, as muſt make us ſhudder with conſternation. Were ſuch a bill to paſs into a law, the expreſſion <q rend="inline margQuotes">"What is a charter but a ſheet of parchment with a bit of wax dangling to it,"</q> might be uttered without being ſtigma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized as groſsly indecent; for there
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0533402100:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
would then be no force in a charter, the eſſence of which is not <hi>matter</hi> but <hi>ſpirit.</hi> If an Attorney General were hanged, it might be ſaid with vulgar triumph, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"What is an Attorney General, but a carcaſe dangling the end of a rope?"</q> But can ſuch expreſſions be uſed with propriety, while a charter contains the faith of Majeſty, and the perſon of an Attorney General, is dignified with an important truſt from the King?</p>
            <p>It is well known, that many indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals of different nations have their whole property veſted in the funds of the Eaſt-India Company, becauſe it hath hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been believed, that in this great and free country, there is no danger of ſuch confiſcations or ſeizures by an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected ſtretch of power, as have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times happened in other countries in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; but had this rapacious graſp been ſucceſsful, Where would have been our boaſted pre-eminence of ſecurity? And how wofully muſt our national credit
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0533402100:12"/>
have ſunk? What muſt the moneyed men of Holland have thought of ſuch <hi>better</hi> regulating of commercial concerns? They muſt have thought of their own <hi>verbeetering buys,</hi> where criminals are ſore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſhed to make them <hi>better.</hi> The Houſe of Commons muſt have appeared a Houſe of Correction with a vengeance.</p>
            <p>The injuſtice of the meaſure would have been the ſame to the proprietors of whatever nation, but muſt have been pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly diſtreſſing to thoſe of our own country, who for a long period of time have been habituated to the perſuaſion, that a Royal Charter is ſo ſacred, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the ſtrongeſt reaſons, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almoſt to the plea of neceſſity, can be permitted to annual or alter it.</p>
            <p>We, in this part of the united king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, experienced in the late reign an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of a number of chartered rights, by the act aboliſhing heritable juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A clamour was raiſed at the time, and there are ſtill ſome who perſiſt in
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0533402100:13"/>
maintaining that this was an infringe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Articles of the Union, by which it was ſtipulated that the juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and courts of Scotland ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as before. But upon looking at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentively at the Articles, it will be found that the heritable juriſdictions were to be reſerved only <hi>as rights of property:</hi> Conſequently, they, like other rights of property, might at any time be taken from the owners by the Legiſlature for the greater good of the publick. The hereditary juriſdictions were grants from the Sovereign, delegating parcels of his power; and when they were aboliſhed in the perſons of private territorial pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, they were abſorbed in his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, the great fountain from which they originally flowed, and from whence they now iſſue in a different manner. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the act aboliſhing heritable juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions was a beneficial meaſure or not, may be fairly queſtioned; for my own part, I ſhould be better pleaſed to live
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0533402100:14"/>
under the immediate juriſdiction of an hereditary Lord, of ancient and generous blood, than under that of a lower man, who by occaſional intereſt has been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a Sheriff. The former was as much under the controul of higher au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority as the latter. But I am not go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſcuſs the queſtion. I mention the meaſure as an act of State coming nearer <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the buſineſs and boſoms"</q> of my countrymen; and that I might recal to their remembrance the deliberation and delicacy with which it was conducted, and the compenſation which was made to thoſe who were deprived of their rights. Yet what is the gratification of pride by additional power, when compared with the eſſential value of property?</p>
            <p>How different was the conduct of the Eaſt-India bill? Was any kind of compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to the Proprietors of that Company ever propoſed? Was there any tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhewn to thoſe who had their whole property at ſtake? No. The tyranny of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0533402100:15"/>
that audacious bill, (I <hi>muſt</hi> be allowed this expreſſion) was unfeeling and inflex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible; thouſands were to behold all that they had upon earth wreſted from them, and committed to ſtrangers, while no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing was left to them but amazement and grief. Was this bill ſedately and deliberately conſidered by the Houſe of Commons? Was full time given not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the Proprietors, but to the nation at large, with humble confidence to ſtate their objections to it? No. It was hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on in a manner which will not ſoon be forgotten. The rapidity of its courſe, and its ill-looking appearance, indicated its character; and when it came into the Houſe of Lords, the alarm was,—<hi>Stop thief.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſolemn attention paid to a ſubject of ſuch magnitude, by that moſt Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Houſe where the ſtate of the Eaſt-India Company was proved to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire no deſperate remedy; and the vote by which the bill was rejected, will ever

be remembered with admiration and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, not only by the great Company which was immediately concerned, but by every Corporation in the kingdom; and indeed by every man who holds any thing valuable by charter. While that portentous bill was ſuſpended over our heads, every man was aſking his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"What will be done next?"</q> Cities, towns, banks, hoſpitals, were in danger, and inſignificance was the only ſecurity. The comfort and joy at being relieved from ſuch apprehenſions, could not but be great and univerſal.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, as to the <hi>Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> the bill provides, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That a certain number of perſons to be named by this bill, ſhall be Commiſſioners for governing and managing the ſaid ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorial poſſeſſions and commerce."</q>
            </p>
            <p> And, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the ſaid Commiſſioners, or the majority thereof, ſhall have full power to remove, ſuſpend, appoint or reſtore

            </p>
            <p>Here, then, we were to have had the eſtabliſhment of a dominion civil and military, of vaſt and various extent, veſted in perſons independent of his moſt ſacred Majeſty, the lawful Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of the realm. The patronage an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to this dominion would have been immenſe, and infinitely beyond what is annexed to the crown of Great Britain. The very ſame Right Honourable Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who inſiſted that the influence of the Crown ought to be diminiſhed, and actually prevailed in having it rigid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly curtailed, drove on this bill, by which ſeven men propoſed by himſelf were to have an influence far beyond what the Crown ever had. If both theſe meaſures were parts of one preconceived plan; if,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0533402100:18"/>
while he was diminiſhing the power of the Crown, he entertained the project of aggrandizing his own power, his abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, great as we muſt acknowledge them to be, are yet of mightier extent than we have ever imagined. Had the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment taken place, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the Crown would have been a bawble which no man of ſpirit would have choſen to wear,"</q> as was nobly ſaid by a great and intrepid Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of our conſtitution, and moſt power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Orator. There would have been in Britain one conſtitutional King,—and an unconſtitutional heptarchy, not of Kings, but of Emperors, and that heptar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy nominated by the Right Honourable Gentleman. He might then have bid defiance to any other power in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. He might have had his commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion prolonged during all the days of his life, and ſat ſupreme in his circle of the Houſe of Commons poſſeſſed of ſuch a ſevenfold ſhield

                     <hi>—vulgi ſtante corona,</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0533402100:19"/>
But this aſtoniſhing project has been happily defeated by the Houſe of Lords, the hereditary Counſellors of the King. The ſpeech of the Earl of <hi>Abingdon,</hi> u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon that memorable occaſion, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main as a diſtinguiſhed example of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional knowledge and legiſlative ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. Had there been nothing againſt the bill, but its violation of chartered pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, I ſhould have thought it deſerved its fate, and many of the Lords put their negative upon that ground. But when it was equally hoſtile to the King, and to the people; and while on one hand, it <hi>directly</hi> daſhed in pieces the ſecurity of chartered property; it, on the other hand, <hi>indirectly,</hi> overwhelmed the Royal prerogative, there were two forcible reaſons for throwing it out. The laſt was the ground taken by the <hi>Biſhop of Saliſbury,</hi> who with the dignified candour which is to be found in every one of the noble family of <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rington,</hi> offered to give his aſſent to the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0533402100:20"/>
bill, if the Miniſtry would aſſure him that the King ſhould have the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Commiſſioners. But that would have been fruſtrating the enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous ſcheme of miniſterial influence, the principal object of the bill.</p>
            <p>The ferment which hath ſince agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Houſe of Commons, need nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſurpriſe nor alarm us; becauſe there is no wonder that the great majority, who voted for the bill, ſhould be angry at their diſappointment. That there ſhould have been ſuch a majority, for ſuch a meaſure, is ſeriouſly diſtreſſing. I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear to conjecture the cauſe; ſorry I am that to ſome of the number may be ſaid <hi>et tu Brute!</hi> But it is ſurely not a ſtrange thing, that the Nobles of the land ſhould ſet themſelves againſt a bill which would have been ſo fatal to the power of the Crown. For as <hi>Blackſtone</hi> well obſerves, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the Nobility are the pillars which are reared from among the people, more immediately to ſupport the Throne,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0533402100:21"/>
and if that falls, they muſt alſo be buried under its ruins<note n="*" place="bottom">Book I. Chap. 2.</note>."</q> The nobility therefore, in this caſe, had a common cauſe with the King, Why then ſhould it be ſuppoſed? why ſhould it be <hi>ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured,</hi> that the influence of his Majeſty determined them againſt a bill which the ſecurity of their own Order called upon them to reject?</p>
            <p>But were it true, that the Sovereign's diſapprobation of the bill was conveyed by a reſpectable Peer to others of his or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; that Noble Lord who repreſented his Majeſty in Ireland with ſo generous a ſplendour, and ſo much to the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that kingdom, might juſtly ſay, (I love his phraſe,) <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I will meet the charge with a high head."</q>
            </p>
            <p>He has ſince proved to us, that he did not mean the artificial high head of miniſterial influence, but the lofty port of conſcious rectitude. What Mr Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley ſaid of Sir John Lowther, in the parliament 1693, may be applied to
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0533402100:22"/>
him, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"I think <hi>Lowther</hi> has told you the true ſtate of the caſe; the greatneſs of his eſtate and mind, makes him too great to be ſuſpected in this matter<note n="*" place="bottom">Grey's Debates, Vol. 10. p. 377.</note>."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Can it be ſeriouſly maintained as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional doctrine, that when the King hath recommended to Parliament, in a ſpeech from the Throne, any particular buſineſs, and a bill is brought in concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that buſineſs, containing clauſes to which the King cannot poſſibly conſent, his Majeſty ſhall be reſtrained from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting with any of his hereditary Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, or any perſon whatever, and from ſignifying his mind either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately or publicly.</p>
            <p>It hath been ſaid, that Miniſters a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone are reſponſible for public meaſures, and therefore, none but actual Miniſters can be allowed to adviſe the Sovereign: But there is here a falacy which it is not difficult to detect. Public meaſures in the <hi>executive</hi> part of adminiſtration, are thoſe for which Miniſters are reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0533402100:23"/>
and therefore, they dare not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry into execution what they know to he wrong, or rather what they fear may ſubject them to puniſhment; but pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blic meaſures in the <hi>deliberative</hi> part of adminiſtration, are not within the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of Miniſters, but belong to Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, until they have paſt both houſes, and come to receive the aſſent or negative of the King; and then, and not till then, does the Miniſters reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility in that branch commence.</p>
            <p>While a bill, then, is pending in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the Miniſter is perfectly ſecure in whatever way the influence of the Crown may be alledged to be uſed; for, Parliament is, or may be, altogether <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent</hi> of that influence; and if being <hi>independent,</hi> they are <hi>ſwayed</hi> by it, it muſt be the influence of <hi>reaſon,</hi> and therefore an influence of which it would be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to complain.</p>
            <p>And what is the precedent which has been mentioned for all this jealouſy of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0533402100:24"/>
regal influence? It is a precedent taken from that gloomy period of our hiſtory, the reign of Charles I. when faction grew more and more virulent, till it became rank rebellion; and by murdering the King, changed our government into anarchy and uſurpation. The caſe which has been quoted was in 1641, when the ſuppreſſion of the rebellion in Ireland required ſpeedy and effectual meaſures to be taken, as the affairs of India do at preſent; and when attention to the former had been recommended from the Throne, as attention to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter has now been.</p>

            <p>Charles I. inſtead of talking to his Parliament in the high and imperious tone of Queen Elizabeth, had, with the beſt intentions, mildly endeavoured to

co-operate with them, in bringing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a matter of great importance, in a manner conſiſtent with the royal preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, which it was his Majeſty's bounden duty to maintain. And as diſpatch was required, his Majeſty fairly notified to his Parliament, that they ſhould not waſte time in carrying through all the forms, a bill to which he could not aſſent, and told them with what limitation he could paſs it.

however, in the proceedings of the Houſe of Commons, exceptions to this rule, neceſſarily ariſing out of their own forms and orders, as in thoſe caſes where <hi>the King is intereſted</hi> as a party in any bill depending before the Houſe, either as Patron of a living, Lord of the manor or ſoil, <hi>or in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner.</hi> Here, as <hi>it is the duty of his ſervants</hi> to <hi>acquaint</hi> him with the <hi>purport</hi> of ſuch bills, and to <hi>take care</hi> that his property or <hi>intereſt may be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured,</hi> or that he may have an adequate compenſation for them, it is uſual for the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, to acquaint the Houſe, either on preſenting the petition, or in the courſe of the bill, that his Majeſty ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been informed of the purport of the ſaid bill, gives his conſent, as far as his Majeſty's intereſt is concerned, that the Houſe may do therein as they ſhall think fit.

            </p>
            <p>I deſire to know, if the King was not deeply intereſted in the Eaſt-India bill, both as it is transferred to certain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, great and important chartered rights, which, if forfeited, ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Crown, and been at his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's diſpoſal; and as it created a new and formidable power, civil and military, independent of his Majeſty? And ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his Majeſty to have, at the time, ſuch ſervants as were more attached to miniſterial influence, than to royal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, and did not acquaint his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty with the purport and tendency of the bill,—were none of the real friends of the conſtitution, none of the King's faithful counſellors, to warn him of the danger; and if warned and convinced,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0533402100:34"/>
was a dead ſilence to be kept, and no diſapprobation to be diſcovered?</p>
            <p>If it be urged, that it would have been more conſtitutional to have left the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the royal negative, I, in the firſt place, deny the propoſition; and, in the next place, I maintain, that acting in that manner might have occaſioned a more violent roar of faction, if we can ſuppoſe the bill to have paſſed both Houſes.</p>
            <p>A notion has been pretty generally en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, that the royal aſſent has been refuſed to no bill ſince the Revolution. But this is ſo far from being true, that part of the very Addreſs to his Majeſty, which was carried in the Houſe of Commons the other day, is copied from a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of that Houſe to William III. in 1693, bearing, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That the uſage of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament in all times hath been, that what bills have been agreed to by both Houſes, for the redreſs of grievances, or other public good, have, when tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>"I am very ſenſible of the good af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections you have expreſſed to me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on many occaſions, and of the zeal you have ſhewn for our common intereſt. I ſhall make uſe of this opportunity to tell you, that no Prince ever had a higher eſteem for the conſtitution of the Engliſh government than myſelf, and that I ſhall ever have a great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the advice of Parliaments. I am perſuaded, that nothing can ſo much conduce to the happineſs and welfare of this kingdom, as an entire confidence between the King and peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; which I ſhall by all means en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to preſerve: And I aſſure you, I ſhall look upon ſuch perſons to be my enemies, who ſhall adviſe any thing that may leſſen it<note n="*" place="bottom">Journals of the Houſe of Commons, January 31. 1693.</note>."</p>

            <p>That our Monarchy received a ſhock at the Revolution, cannot be denied. But it was a ſhock of <hi>political neceſſity,</hi> the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons

of which <hi>Blackſtone,</hi> that our minds may be quiet, wiſely puts upon <q rend="inline margQuotes">"the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid footing of authority."</q>—<q rend="inline margQuotes">"For our anceſtors having moſt indiſputably a competent juriſdiction to decide this great and important queſtion, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in fact decided it, it is now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come our duty, at this diſtance of time, to acquieſce in their determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion<note n="*" place="bottom">Book I. chap. 3.</note>.</q> But we ſee that, after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, though the line of ſucceſſion was changed, the Crown retained its <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative</hi> as to <hi>Acts of Parliament,</hi> and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed it with a bold reſolution.</p>
            <p>A keen debate on King William's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer took place in the Houſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, which had, in effect, queſtioned his Majeſty's <hi>undoubted prerogative</hi> in refuſing his aſſent. It was moved, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"That an humble addreſs be made to the King for a farther anſwer."</q> But there was prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple and decency enough amongſt them

to reject it. In truth, to diſpute the King's free right of a negative upon any bill, is tantamount to inſiſting that he is a cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher in the conſtitution. And I admire the ſtrong blunt ſpeech of <hi>Mr Brewer,</hi> 
               <q rend="inline margQuotes">"All agree, that the King hath a nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voice to bills: No body hath a greater reverence to Parliaments than myſelf; but the bill rejected was liable to exceptions.

            <p>The purpoſe of this Letter is to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to the people of Scotland, in their ſeveral counties, boroughs, corporations, and public bodies of every kind, to AD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DRESS his Majeſty upon this momentous criſis, to expreſs their ſincere ſatisfaction, that a bill for veſting the affairs of the
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0533402100:40"/>
Eaſt-India Company in certain Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners,—a bill dangerous at once to the rights of the King and people, has been rejected by his Majeſty's hereditary coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, the Houſe of Lords; aſſuring his Majeſty of their firm attachment to his Royal Perſon and Government, and of their ſupport of ſuch Miniſters as his Majeſty may be graciouſly pleaſed to chuſe for the ſtable adminiſtration of public affairs, at a time when ſtability is of moſt eſſential conſequence; hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly truſting, that his Majeſty's paternal care for the intereſts of his ſubjects, and due regard to the conſtitutional preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his Crown, will prevent any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringement upon either.</p>
            <p>Addreſſes, I know, have but too often been proſtituted. That is no reaſon why they ſhould never be preſented. I do not mean that either <hi>influence</hi> or <hi>ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation</hi> ſhould be uſed: But if my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen in general are perſuaded of the
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0533402100:41"/>
dangerous tendency of the late Eaſt-India bill, an honeſt expreſſion of their ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon its defeat, is a tribute due to thoſe who withſtood it; and may have weight in preventing a renewal of the attempt. It was urged by its principal abettor, that there had been no petitions againſt it, except from the city of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, and the borough of Chipping Wy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>combe. Let numerous Addreſſes prove, that time, and not will, was wanting. And as, in conſequence of the ſcheme for eſtabliſhing a new and formidable power having proved abortive, there is a conflict of parties with reſpect to an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, let our moſt gracious Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, whoſe exalted worth and benig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity are far above my panegyric, have the comfort of knowing from his people themſelves, how they think and feel: And let Scotland, at the moſt intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing period ſince the Reſtoration, aſſume the importance to which ſhe is entitled.</p>
            <p>Let us, as much as we poſſibly can, diveſt ourſelves of private conſiderations,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0533402100:42"/>
more eſpecially how particular perſons of eminence may be affected one way or other. Whatever may be the abilities, whatever the good intentions of any of them, whatever our expectations from their influence, let us, upon this awful occaſion, think only of <hi>property</hi> and the <hi>conſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For my own part, I ſhould claim no credit, did I not flatter myſelf, that I practiſe what I now preſume to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend. I have mentioned former cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, perhaps, of too much ego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, to ſhow, that I am no time-ſerver; and, at this moment, friends to whom I am attached by affection, gratitude and intereſt, are zealous for the meaſure which I deem ſo alarming. Let me add, that a diſmiſſion of the Portland Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, will probably diſappoint an object which I have moſt ardent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at heart. But, holding an eſtate, tranſmitted to me through my anceſtors,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0533402100:43"/>
by charters from a ſeries of Kings, the importance of a Charter, and the prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative of a King, impreſs my mind with ſeriouſneſs and with duty; and while a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimated, I hope, as much as any man, with genuine feelings of liberty, I ſhall ever adhere to our excellent monarchy, that venerable inſtitution under which liberty is beſt enjoyed.</p>
