            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <l>When ſmiling Love with Honour ſhar'd thy mind:</l>
                     <l>The ſweet remembrance ſhall thy youth reſtore,</l>
                     <l>Fancy again ſhall run paſt pleaſures o'er,</l>
                     <l>And while in Stowe's enchanting walks you ſtray,</l>

<note n="d" place="bottom">Edward being engaged in a war with France, for the obtaining that crown, in order to draw into England great multitudes of foreigners, with whom he might negotiate either for their perſonal ſervice, or aids of troops to aſſiſt him in that undertaking, ordered, during the truce that then ſubſiſted between the two crowns, publication to be made of a great tournament, to be held at Windſor; an expedient, ſays Rapin, which could not fail of ſucceſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was entirely agreeable to the taſte of that age. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly many perſons of diſtinction came over, to all of whom he gave an honourable reception, careſſing them in ſuch a manner that they could never ſufficiently admire his polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, magnificence, and liberality. To render theſe entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments the more ſolemn, and to free himſelf alſo from the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, to which the difference of rank and condition would have ſubjected him, he cauſed a circular hall of boards to be run up at Windſor, <hi>200</hi> feet in diameter. There it was that he feaſted all the knights at one table, which was called the Round Table, in memory of the great Arthur, who, as it is pretended, inſtituted an order of knighthood by that name. Next year he cauſed a more ſolid building to be erected, that he might continue yearly the ſame diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. During that time he treated with theſe ſeveral lords about the aids, wherewith each could furniſh him, in proportion to his forces. His rival king Philip could not ſee without jealouſy, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, Fle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings, and Frenchmen themſelves flock to England to aſſiſt at theſe tournaments. He ſuſpected ſome hidden deſign in theſe ntertainments, and to break Edward's meaſures, cauſed the like to be publiſhed in his dominions; which meeting with ſucceſs, proved a countermine to Edward's main deſign, ſo that he did not long continue to keep up his round table. From thence, however, it is generally agreed, he took the firſt hint of inſtituting the order of the Garter. But as his purpoſe in erecting this order was very different from that which had induced him to revive Arthur's round table, as he had in this no private views, no ambitious ſcheme of engaging ſuch as ſhould be admitted into this fraternity to aſſiſt him in his wars, he thought proper, in order to obviate the like jealouſies and ſuſpicion as had alarmed king Philip, to ſignify by his motto the purity of his intentions, and to retort ſhame upon all thoſe who ſhould put any malignant conſtruction upon his deſign in inſtituting this order. This therefore I take to be the true meaning and import of the famous motto, <hi>HONI SOIT QUI MAL Y PENSE.</hi> The not underſtanding the purport of which, gave riſe, in all probability, to that vulgar ſtory of the counteſs of Saliſbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's garter, rejected by all the beſt writers.</note>

                  <l>CRITICKS avaunt; TOBACCO is my theme;</l>
                  <l>Tremble like hornets at the blaſting ſteam.</l>
                  <l>And you, court-inſects, flutter not too near</l>
                  <l>Its light, nor buzz within the ſcorching ſphere.</l>
                  <l>POLLIO, with flame like thine, my verſe inſpire,</l>
                  <l>So ſhall the Muſe from ſmoke elicit fire.</l>
                  <l>Coxcombs prefer the tickling ſting of ſnuff;</l>
                  <l>Yet all their claim to wiſdom is — a puff:</l>
                  <l>Lord FOPLIN ſmokes not—for his teeth afraid:</l>
                  <l>Sir TAWDRY ſmokes not—for he wears brocade.</l>
                  <l>Ladies, when pipes are brought, affect to ſwoon;</l>
                  <l>They love no ſmoke, except the ſmoke of town;</l>
                  <l>But courtiers hate the puffing tribe, — no matter,</l>
                  <l>Strange if they love the breath that cannot flatter!</l>
                  <l>Its foes but ſhew their ignorance; can he</l>
                  <l>Who ſcorns the leaf of knowledge, love the tree?</l>
                  <l>The tainted templar (more prodigious yet)</l>
                  <l>Rails at TOBACCO, tho' it makes him—ſpit.</l>
                  <l>CRITONIA vows it has an odious ſtink;</l>
                  <l>She will not ſmoke (ye gods!)—but ſhe will drink:</l>
                  <l>And chaſte PRUDELIA (blame her if you can)</l>
                  <l>Says, pipes are us'd by that vile creature Man:</l>
                  <l>Yet crowds remain, who ſtill its worth proclaim,</l>
                  <l>While ſome for pleaſure ſmoke, and ſome for fame:</l>
                  <l>Fame, of our actions univerſal ſpring,</l>
                  <l>For which we drink, eat, ſleep, ſmoke—ev'ry thing.</l>
