            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE immortal Author of Hudibras af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms, the hardeſt taſk in the world is to write a play; it is, therefore, no wonder that writers of plays are prone to regard their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours with fondneſs, even to partiality; or that they ſhould perceive with regret the light eſteem in which a part of the literary world have lately affected to hold them. Works of rudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of diſquiſition, nay, even, of mere compilation, are often treated by criticiſm with a reſpect which a comedy, or tragedy, where wit, invention, genius, and all the higheſt faculties of the mind have, or ought to have, been employed, ſeldom meets. The theatre, however it may be debaſed by the nightly intruſion of unhappy and improper perſons, has a moſt powerful and good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on morals, which increaſes with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry, and as the means of gaining admiſſion among the lower claſs increaſe. Much time is there ſpent to the beſt, the nobleſt, of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; the body's fatigues are forgotten, the mind is beguiled of its cares, the ſad heart is made merry, fictitious ſorrow obliterates real, and the ſoul, imbibing virtuous and heroic principles, is rouſed and impelled to actions that honour not only individuals but nations, and give a dignity to human nature. Thoſe who can doubt this are to be pitied. And it is piteous, moſt piteous, that, not only the learned, but, the political world ſhould treat the ſtage with neglect; nay, with contempt:
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0870701300:5"/>
that they do not combine, and employ the high powers they poſſeſs to the encouragement and perfection of an art which, being, in its own nature, ſo delightful, ſo faſcinating, is capable of contributing, ſo infinitely, to the happineſs, as well as to the pleaſure, of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>Theſe ideas have long, and often, occurred to my mind, where they have acted with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing force. If I have written a comedy which, perfectly moral in its tendency, and counteracting a faſhionable vice that is in danger of becoming a vulgar one, has charms ſufficient to attract ſpectators, I am of opinion I have done my country an eſſential ſervice. That ſome who read this may call me vain or preſumptuous is, to me, totally indifferent. The theatre is a ſubject of ſuch conſequence to virtue, happineſs, and man, that I cannot forbear ſpeaking of it with a ſenſe of feeling which, I fear, I cannot impart.</p>
            <p>I muſt now undertake a taſk of a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent and painful nature; the cauſe of my undertaking it ſhall be given, when I have told my ſtory.</p>
            <p>In the ſummer of 1785, I wrote the Opera of the Choleric Fathers, and the Comedy of Seduction. They were both put into the hands of Mr. Harris, on certain conditions; the ſubſtance of which was that, if, after read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he ſhould approve the pieces, they were both to be played, during the enſuing ſeaſon, the firſt in November, and the latter in January,
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0870701300:6"/>
or the beginning of February, 1786. They were read by Mr. Harris, and both accepted, on theſe conditions; and ſo preciſe, ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly explained, were they that they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to writing. However, certain objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ariſing, on the part of Mr. Harris, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning benefit nights (not the time of perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pieces, for that remained determined) I, myſelf, tore the written agreement; ſaying, I thought it improbable men, who meant ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and honourably, ſhould differ in trifles; and that each other's word was ſufficient.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Harris had read Seduction, though he objected to parts, he was, yet, ſo well pleaſed with the whole, that he ſaid, with evident, and peculiar, ſatisfaction, I had given the theatre a comedy which, he thought, would do it no harm.</p>
            <p>Having made his objections, alterations were agreed on, and the comedy taken back. Further to prove how fully the word of Mr. Harris was engaged, how perfectly he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood himſelf pledged to abide by his agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, while the Opera of the Choleric Fathers was preparing for repreſentation, Mr. Harris ſent to me, to make a new propoſal, which, according to him, would highly benefit the theatre. This was that, inſtead of January, I ſhould ſuffer the comedy to be brought out before Chriſtmas, becauſe he had a new panto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mime (Omai) that would, in all probability, be greatly beneficial to the theatre, after Chriſtmas, and that his ſeaſon would then
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0870701300:7"/>
be filled up, and, probably, exceedingly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive. That my intereſt might not ſuffer by this arrangement, he promiſed, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation, to ſuffer the new pantomime to be played for my third benefit, and, if the comedy ran a certain number of nights, for my fourth. When he made this propoſition I deſired time to conſider, and conſult my friends; and, at laſt, from a ſincere wiſh to oblige Mr. Harris, and ſerve the theatre, acquieſced. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, however, was deranged; not by me, or Mr. Harris; but by an event highly vexatious to both, and which I ſhall not relate now; perhaps never.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the play had received ſome alterations, and the inſertion of a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter ſo atrocious, yet ſo frequent, in this town, as to make, in the opinion of Mr. Harris, the repreſentation of it dangerous. Accordingly, this was to be expunged, ſtill further alterations were undertaken, and the comedy, a third time, delivered, as it is at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent played, about the beginning of December, 1785. It will be neceſſary to remark that, before this, the Choleric Fathers had been performed, and did not take that run which Mr. Harris expected, and I had hoped; and that, knowing the changeable diſpoſition of Mr. Harris, I cautioned him againſt ſuffering this mediocrity of ſucceſs to influence, and prejudice, his mind againſt the comedy. He aſſured me it ſhould not.</p>
            <p>I muſt likewiſe ſtate that, ſo ſelf-denying
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0870701300:8"/>
was I, and deſirous of promoting the welfare of the theatre, when Mr. Harris informed me, by Mr. Lewis, he had no further hopes from the Opera, which had then been played ſeven nights, and that he would allow me the eighth inſtead of the ninth night, but adding he doubted whether I ſhould clear expences; I, though there was no probability of loſs, and, certainly, ſome of gain, gave up my third night to the theatre; telling Mr. Lewis I would not deprive Mr. Harris of a night, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſuch circumſtances.</p>
            <p>The Comedy remained with Mr. Harris, who, I was told, was gone out of town, till the beginning of January, without my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving any information of its being preparing for rehearſal. I began to be alarmed; and, unable to obtain an interview, or even diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover where Mr. Harris was, I wrote a letter to him, expreſſive of theſe alarms. I need not deſcribe what my feelings were, a few days after, on receiving the comedy back, with a letter from Mr. Harris, in which theſe feelings were indeed little reſpected, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing me it could not ſucceed. The manner of ſending it back was, almoſt, as extraordinary as the act. It was brought, looſely tied up with packthread, in a bit of dirty brown pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, unſealed, by the ſervant of Mr. O'Keefe. I mean not to inſinuate any poſſible diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to the character of Mr. O'Keefe: far to the contrary. I have often heard him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably mentioned. Neither can I ſay how
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0870701300:9"/>
it came into his hands, or that he knew what it was; but this is no palliation of Mr. Harris's conduct. I returned no anſwer; it would have been exceedingly wrong to have truſted the irritated mind at ſuch a moment.</p>
            <p>I will now give my reaſons for relating this tranſaction to the world. To pretend I did not feel all the indignation which conduct like this muſt kindle, would be to aſſume an apathy contrary to nature; and, even, to virtue. This, however, has worn off: I act coolly, at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and from a ſenſe of duty, not revenge. As far as relates to myſelf, I would wiſh the affair might never more be remembered; but, if men in ſimilar ſituations might act thus <hi>always</hi> with impunity, as they <hi>too often</hi> do, what means could the weak and unprotected find of obtaining redreſs; what ſecurity in their dealings with a man, who, regardleſs of probity, and yielding to the caprice of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, the dictates of pride, or the narrow motives of ſelf-intereſt, does not ſcruple to break his word, ſo pledged, and engagements thus formal?</p>
            <p>This narrative will ſcarcely be more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to Mr. Harris to read than it has been to me to write: it is not my own cauſe I plead, for that was gained in the ſucceſs of my Comedy; but the cauſe of the weak againſt the ſtrong; the cauſe of hereafter genius againſt hereafter injuſtice; the cauſe of the man, who, endowed with gifts of which Nature herſelf is proud, but deprived of every
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0870701300:10"/>
benefit of Fortune, ſhall devote his days and nights to ſtudy, and ſuffer every abſtinence with reſignation, and, even with delight, cheered by the ſweet hope of being ſome time known for what he is. There is a momentary intoxication, a delirium of ſoul, in this hope, which not the daily privation of pleaſures, the diſappointments of years, the labours of a life, nor injuſtice itſelf can counterbalance. It is this godlike ſenſation which has given the mind an impetus, and made it produce works ſo various, and ſo vaſt, that, glancing at their amplitude and ſublimity, it ſtands confounded at its own powers!</p>
            <p>That I may avoid all appearance of min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gling flattery with an appeal to juſtice, I ſhall forbear deſcribing the conduct of the Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of Drury-Lane; except ſaying, they have behaved to me like Gentlemen, and men of honour.</p>
            <p>My heart will not, however, ſuffer me to be equally reſerved, and ſilent, concerning Mr. King. The moment he was convinced the producing of this Comedy would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſerve, not injure, the Theatre, his zeal and activity, in my cauſe, were indefatigable: how very eſſentially his powers, as an actor, have contributed to its ſucceſs is too public for me (had I a wiſh ſo ſelfiſh) to conceal. But this is not the firſt debt of gratitude from me to Mr. King; his friendſhip, or his philanthropy, while I was ſtruggling into notice, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating with adverſe fortune, did me a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0870701300:11"/>
kindneſs which never can, nor ever ought to be forgotten.</p>
            <p>The Town have beheld, with delight and ſurpriſe, the increaſing excellence of Miſs Farren; and, thinking ſhe had attained per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, have been aſtoniſhed, when they ſaw her next, at their own miſtake. In the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtance, her exertions, and even the very manner of them, have been as pleaſing to me, as they were beneficial to the Comedy. I can only add, ſhe has excelled herſelf; and, though that thought be old, it never was more properly applied.</p>
            <p>Having mentioned theſe, it were injuſtice to the reſt of the performers not to thank them; both for the diſplay of talents, the merits of which are well known, and the ardour, I may ſay the anxiety, they teſtified for my ſucceſs. Yes, I moſt ſincerely thank them all; and only forbear to name them, individually, becauſe I cannot find expreſſions, various and warm enough, to convey my thoughts, without making true and well deſerved praiſe aſſume the form of laboured panegyric.</p>
