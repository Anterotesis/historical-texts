            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT is impoſſible but the whole Attention of the Reader muſt be awaken'd in this Book: The Heroes of the two Armies are now to encounter, all the foregoing Battels have been but ſo many Preludes and Under-actions, in order to this great Event: Wherein the whole Fate of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Troy</hi> is to be decided by the Sword of <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Hector.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the Book, which of the whole Iliad appears to me the moſt charming. It aſſembles in it all that can be imagined of great and important on the one hand, and of tender and melancholy on the other. <hi>Terror</hi> and <hi>Pity</hi> are here wrought up in Perfection, and if the Reader is not ſenſible of both in a high degree, either he is utterly void of all Taſte, or the Tranſlator of all Skill, in Poetry.</p>

The Reproach of <hi>Polydamas</hi> affects him; the Scandals of the meaneſt People have an Influence on his Thoughts.</p>
                  <p>'Tis remarkable that he does not ſay, he fears the Inſults of the braver <hi>Trojans,</hi> but of the moſt worthleſs only. Men of Merit are always the moſt candid; but others are ever for bringing all Men to a Level with themſelves. They cannot

bear that any one ſhould be ſo bold as to excel, and are ready to pull him down to them, upon the leaſt Miſcarriage. This Sentiment is perfectly fine, and agreeable to the way of thinking natural to a great and ſenſible Mind.</p>
                  <p>There is a very beautiful Break in the middle of this Speech. <hi>Hector</hi>'s Mind fluctuates every way, he is calling a Council in his own Breaſt, and conſulting what Method to purſue: He doubts if he ſhould not propoſe Terms of Peace to <hi>Achilles,</hi> and grants him very large Conceſſions; but of a ſudden he checks himſelf, and leaves the Sentence unfiniſh'd. The Paragraph runs thus, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"If, ſays <hi>Hector,</hi> I ſhould offer him the largeſt Conditions, give all that <hi>Troy</hi> contains—</q> There he ſtops, and immediately ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins, <q rend="inline margQuotes">"But why do I delude myſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Homer</hi> (to keep this in our Minds) had juſt now made <hi>Priam</hi> tell him (as a thing known, for certainly <hi>Priam</hi> would not inſult him at that time) that there was no Compariſon between his own Strength, and that of his Antagoniſt.<q>

                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> we may obſerve with <hi>Dacier,</hi> the Degrees by which <hi>Homer</hi> prepares this Incident. In the 18th Book the mere Sight and Voice of <hi>Achilles,</hi> unarm'd, has terrify'd and put the whole <hi>Trojan</hi> Army into Diſorder. In the 19th, the very Sound of the coeleſtial Arms given him by <hi>Vulcan,</hi> has affrighted his own <hi>Myrmidons</hi> as they ſtand about him. In the 20th, he has been upon the point of killing <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and <hi>Hector</hi> himſelf was not ſav'd from him but by <hi>Apollo</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſing. In that and the following Book, he makes an incredible Slaughter of all that oppoſe him; he overtakes
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0356200106:44"/>
moſt of thoſe that fly from him, and <hi>Priam</hi> himſelf opens the Gates of <hi>Troy</hi> to receive the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, Hector</hi> ſtays, not that he hopes to overcome <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles,</hi> but becauſe Shame and the dread of Reproach forbid him to re-enter the City; a Shame (ſays <hi>Eustathius</hi>) which was a Fault, that betray'd him out of his Life, and ruin'd his Countrey. Nay, <hi>Homer</hi> adds farther, that he only ſtay'd by the immediate <hi>Will of Heaven,</hi> intoxicated and irreſiſtibly bound down by <hi>Fate.</hi>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> He had juſt been reflecting on the Injuſtice of the War he maintain'd; his Spirits are depreſt by Heaven, he expects certain Death, he perceives himſelf abandon'd by the Gods; (as he directly ſays in ℣. 300, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the <hi>Greek,</hi> and 385 of the tranſlation) ſo that he might ſay to <hi>Achilles</hi> what <hi>Turnus</hi> does to <hi>Aeneas,</hi>

                     </q> This indeed is the ſtrongeſt Reaſon that can be offer'd for the Flight of <hi>Hector.</hi> He flies not from <hi>Achilles</hi> as a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Hero, but from one whom he ſees clad in impenetrable Armour, ſeconded by <hi>Minerva,</hi> and one who had put to flight the inferior Gods themſelves. This is not Cowardice according to the conſtant Principles of <hi>Homer,</hi> who thought it no part of a Hero's Character to be impious, or to fancy himſelf independent on the ſupreme Being.</p>
                  <p>Indeed it had been a grievous Fault, had our Author ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd the Courage of <hi>Hector</hi> entirely to forſake him even in this Extremity: A brave Man's Soul is ſtill capable of rouzing itſelf, and acting honourably in the laſt Struggles.

                  <p>If the Reader, after all, cannot bring himſelf to like this Paſſage, for his own particular; yet to induce him to ſuſpend

his abſolute Cenſure, he may conſider that <hi>Virgil</hi> had an uncommon Eſteem for it, as he has teſtify'd in transferring it almoſt entirely to the Death of <hi>Turnus;</hi> where there was no neceſſity of making uſe of the like Incidents: But doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he was touch'd with this Epiſode, as with one of thoſe which intereſt us moſt of the whole Iliad, by a Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctacle at once ſo terrible, and ſo deplorable. I muſt alſo add the Suffrage of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> who was ſo far from looking upon this Paſſage as ridiculous or blameable, that he eſteem'd it mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellous and admirable. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The <hi>wonderful,</hi> ſays he, ought to have place in Tragedy, but ſtill more in Epic Poetry, which proceeds in this Point even to the Unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable: For as in Epic Poems one ſees not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons acting, ſo whatever paſſes the Bounds of Reaſon is proper to produce the admirable and the marvellous. For example, what <hi>Homer</hi> ſays of <hi>Hector</hi> purſued by <hi>Achilles,</hi> would appear ridiculous on the Stage; for the Spectators could not forbear laughing to ſee on one ſide the <hi>Greeks</hi> ſtanding without any motion, and on the other; <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles</hi> purſuing <hi>Hector,</hi> and making Signs to the Troops not to dart at him.

                  <hi>ACHILLES</hi> and the <hi>Myrmidons</hi> do Honours to the Body of <hi>Patroclus.</hi> After the funeral Feast he retires to the Sea-Shore, where falling aſleep, the Ghost of his Friend appears to him, and demands the Rites of Burial; the next Morning the Soldiers are ſent with Mules and Wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons to fetch Wood for the Pyre. The funeral Proceſſion, and the offering of their Hair to the Dead. <hi>Achilles</hi> ſacrifices ſeveral Animals, and lastly, twelve <hi>Trojan</hi> Captives at the Pile, then ſets fire to it. He pays Libations to the Winds, which (at the instance of <hi>Iris</hi>) riſe, and raiſe the Flames. When the Pile has burn'd all Night, they gather the Bones, place 'em in an Urn of Gold, and raiſe the Tomb. <hi>Achilles</hi> institutes the funeral Games: The Chariot Race, the Fight of the <hi>Caeſtus,</hi> the Wrestling, the Foot-Race, the ſingle Combate, the <hi>Diſcus,</hi> the ſhooting with Arrows, the darting the Javelin: The various Deſcriptions of which, and the various Succeſs of the ſeveral Antagonists, make the greatest part of the Book.</p>
               <p>In this Book ends the thirtieth Day: The Night following, the Ghost of <hi>Patroclus</hi> appears to <hi>Achilles:</hi> The one and thirtieth Day is employ'd in felling the Timber for the Pile; the two and thirtieth in burning it; and the three and thirtieth in the Games. The Scene is generally on the Sea-Shore.</p>

                  <p>THIS, and the following Book, which contain the Deſcription of the Funeral of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> and other Matters relating to <hi>Hector,</hi> are undoubtedly ſuperadded to the grand Cataſtrophe of the Poem; for the Story is compleatly finiſh'd with the Death of that Hero in the 22<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Book. Many judicious Criticks have been of opinion that <hi>Homer</hi> is blameable for protract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. <hi>Virgil</hi> cloſes the whole Scene of Action with the Death of <hi>Turnus,</hi> and leaves the reſt to be imagin'd by the Mind of the Reader: He does not draw the Picture at full Length, but delineates it ſo far, that we cannot fail of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining the whole Draught. There is however one thing to be ſaid in favour of <hi>Homer</hi> which may perhaps juſtify him in his Method, that what he undertook was to paint the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of</hi> Achilles: And as that Anger does not die with <hi>Hector,</hi> but perſecutes his very remains, ſo the Poet ſtill keeps up to his Subject; nay it ſeems to require that he ſhould carry down the Relation of that Reſentment, which is the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of his Poem, till it is fully ſatisfy'd: And as this ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vives <hi>Hector,</hi> and gives the Poet an Opportunity of ſtill ſhewing many ſad Effects of <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Anger, the two fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Books may be thought not to be Excreſcencies, but eſſential to the Poem.</p>

But he Poet paſſes all thoſe Games over in Silence, and reſerves them for this Seaſon; not only in honour of <hi>Patroclus,</hi> but alſo of his Hero <hi>Achilles;</hi> who exhibits Games to a whole Army; great Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerals are Candidates for the Prizes, and he himſelf ſits the Judge and Arbitrator: Thus in Peace as well as War the Poet maintains the Superiority of the Character of <hi>Achilles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But there is another Reaſon why the Poet deferr'd to relate any Games that were exhibited at any preceding Funerals: The Death of <hi>Patroclus</hi> was the moſt eminent Period; and conſequently the moſt proper Time for ſuch Games.</p>
                  <p>'Tis farther obſervable, that he chuſes this peculiar Time with great Judgment. When the Fury of the War rag'd, the Army could not well have found Leiſure for the Games, and they might have met with Interruption from the Enemy: But <hi>Hector</hi> being dead, all <hi>Troy</hi> is in Confuſion: They are in too great a Conſternation to make any Attempts, and therefore the Poet could not poſſibly have choſen a more happy Opportunity. <hi>Eustathius.</hi>

                  <p>It may be added as a farther Juſtification of <hi>Homer,</hi> that this laſt Circumſtance is very natural: <hi>Achilles</hi> while he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends his Horſes remembers how careful <hi>Patroclus</hi> had been of them: His Love for his Friend is ſo great, that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuteſt Circumſtance recalls him to his Mind; and ſuch little Digreſſions, ſuch Avocations of Thought as theſe, very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally proceed from the Overflows of Love and Sorrow.</p>

His Age had diſabled him from bearing any ſhare in the Games; and yet he artfully introduces him not as a mere Spectator, but as an Actor in the Sports.

                  <p>Nothing can be better adapted to the Character than this Speech; he expatiates upon the Advantages of Wiſdom over Strength, which is a tacit Complement to himſelf: And had there been a Prize for Wiſdom, undoubtedly the old Man would have claim'd it as his Right. <hi>Eustathius.</hi>

The Reader may obſerve that the old Man takes abundance of pains to give Reaſons how his Rivals came to be Victors in the Chariot-Race: He is very ſolicitous to make it appear that it was not thro' any want of Skill or Power in himſelf: And in my Opinion <hi>Neſtor</hi> is never more vainglorious than in this recital of his own Diſappointment.</p>
                  <p>It is for the ſame reaſon he repeats the Words I have cited above: He obtrudes (by that Repetition) the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantages under which he labour'd, upon the Obſervation of the Reader, for fear he ſhould impute the Loſs of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory to his want of Skill.</p>

                     <hi>Neſtor</hi> ſays that theſe <hi>Moliones</hi> overpower'd him by their Number. The Criticks, as <hi>Euſtathius</hi> remarks, have labour'd hard to explain this Difficulty; they tell us a formal Story, that when <hi>Neſtor</hi> was ready to enter the Liſts againſt theſe Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, he objected againſt them as unfair Adverſaries, (for it muſt be remember'd that they were Monſters that grew together, and conſequently had four Hands to <hi>Nestor</hi>'s two)
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0356200106:133"/>
but the Judges would not allow his plea, but determin'd, that as they grew together ſo they ought to be conſider'd as one Man.</p>
                  <p>Others tell us, that they brought ſeveral Chariots into the Liſts, whoſe Charioteers combin'd together in favour of <hi>Eurytus</hi> and <hi>Cteatus,</hi> theſe brother-Monſters.</p>

He could not forbear at the very Beginning to draw a part of that Deſcription into a Simile. Do not we ſee he has <hi>Homer</hi>'s Chariots in his Head, by theſe Lines

Upon the whole, the Deſcription of the Sea-Race I think has the more Poetry and Majeſty, that of the Chariots more Nature, and lively Incidents. There is nothing in <hi>Virgil</hi> ſo pictureſque, ſo animated, or which ſo much marks the Characters, as the Epiſodes of <hi>Antilochus</hi> and <hi>Menelaus, Ajax</hi> and <hi>Idomeneus,</hi> with that beautiful Interpoſition of old <hi>Neſtor,</hi> (ſo naturally introduc'd into an Affair where one ſo little expects him.) On the other ſide, in <hi>Virgil</hi> the Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption itſelf is much nobler; it has ſomething more oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatiouſly grand, and ſeems a Spectacle more worthy the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Princes and great Perſons.</p>
                  <p>In three other Games we find the <hi>Roman</hi> Poet contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing openly with the <hi>Grecian.</hi> That of the <hi>Caeſtus</hi> is in great part a verbal Tranſlation: But it muſt be own'd in favour of <hi>Virgil,</hi> that he has vary'd from <hi>Homer</hi> in the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent of the Combate with admirable Judgment and with an Improvement of the Moral. <hi>Epaeus</hi> and <hi>Dares</hi> are deſcrib'd by both Poets as vain Boaſters; but <hi>Virgil</hi> with more poetical Juſtice puniſhes <hi>Dares</hi> for his Arrogance, whereas the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption and Pride of <hi>Epaeus</hi> is rewarded by <hi>Homer.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>On the contrary, in the Foot-Race, I am of opinion that <hi>Homer</hi> has ſhewn more Judgment and Morality than <hi>Virgil. Niſus</hi> in the latter is unjuſt to his Adverſary in favour of his Friend <hi>Euryalus;</hi> ſo that <hi>Euryalus</hi> wins the Race by pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable Fraud, and yet the Poet gives him the firſt Prize; whereas <hi>Homer</hi> makes <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> victorious, purely thro' the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chance of <hi>Ajax,</hi> and his own Piety in invoking <hi>Minerva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſhooting is alſo a direct Copy, but with the Addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two Circumſtances which make a beautiful Gradation. In <hi>Homer</hi> the firſt Archer cuts the String that held the Bird, and the other ſhoots him as he is mounting. In <hi>Virgil</hi> the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0356200106:141"/>
firſt only hits the Maſt which the Bird was fix'd upon, the ſecond cuts the String, the third ſhoots him, and the fourth to vaunt the Strength of his Arm directs his Arrow up to Heaven, where it kindles into a Flame, and makes a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy. This laſt is certainly ſuperior to <hi>Homer</hi> in what they call the <hi>Wonderful:</hi> but what is the Intent or Effect of this Prodigy, or whether a Reader is not at leaſt as much ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at it, as at the moſt unreaſonable Parts in <hi>Homer,</hi> I leave to thoſe Criticks who are more inclin'd to find Faults than I am: Nor ſhall I obſerve upon the many literal Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in the <hi>Roman</hi> Poet, to object againſt which were to derogate from the Merit of thoſe fine Paſſages, which <hi>Virgil</hi> was ſo very ſenſible of, that he was reſolv'd to take them, at any rate, to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>There remain in <hi>Homer</hi> three Games untouch'd by <hi>Virgil;</hi> the Wreſtling, the ſingle Combate, and the <hi>Diſcus.</hi> In <hi>Virgil</hi> there is only the <hi>Luſus Trojae</hi> added, which is purely his own, and muſt be confeſt to be inimitable: I don't know whether I may be allow'd to ſay, it is worth all thoſe three of <hi>Homer?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I could not forgive my ſelf if I omitted to mention in this place the Funeral Games in the ſixth <hi>Thebaïd</hi> of <hi>Statius;</hi> it is by much the moſt beautiful Book of that Poem. It's very remarkable, that he has follow'd <hi>Homer</hi> thro' the whole Courſe of his Games: There is the Chariot-Race, the Foot-Race, the <hi>Diſcus,</hi> the <hi>Caeſtus,</hi> the Wreſtling, the ſingle Combate (which is put off in the ſame manner as in <hi>Homer</hi>) and the Shooting; which laſt ends (as in <hi>Virgil</hi>) with a Prodigy: Yet in the particular Deſcriptions of each of theſe Games this Poet has not borrow'd from either of his Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and his Poem is ſo much the worſe for it.</p>

The old King, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Remonſtrances of his Queen, makes ready for the Journey, to which he is encourag'd by an Omen from <hi>Jupiter.</hi> He ſets forth in his Chariot, with a Waggon loaded with Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents under the Charge of <hi>Idaeus</hi> the Herald. <hi>Mercury</hi> deſcends in the Shape of a young Man, and conducts him to the Pavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion of <hi>Achilles.</hi> Their Converſation on the way. <hi>Priam</hi> finds <hi>Achilles</hi> at his Table, caſts himſelf at his Feet, and begs for the Body of his Son; <hi>Achilles,</hi> mov'd with Compaſſion, grants his Requeſt, detains him one Night in his Tent, and the next Morning ſends him home with the Body: The <hi>Trojans</hi> run out to meet him.

The Poem is now almoſt at the Concluſion, and <hi>Achilles</hi> is to paſs from a State of an almoſt inexorable Reſentment to a State of perfect Tranquillity; ſuch a Change could not be brought about by human Means; <hi>Achilles</hi> is too ſtubborn to obey any thing leſs than a God: This is evident from his reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Perſuaſion of the whole <hi>Grecian</hi> Army to return to the Battle: So that it appears that this Machinery was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, and conſequently a Beauty to the Poem.</p>
                  <p>It may be farther added, that theſe ſeveral Incidents pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from <hi>Jupiter:</hi> It is by his Appointment that ſo many Gods are employ'd to attend <hi>Achilles.</hi> By theſe means <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piter</hi> fulfills the Promiſe mention'd in the firſt Book, of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring the Son of <hi>Thetis,</hi> and the Poet excellently ſuſtains his Character by repreſenting the inexorable <hi>Achilles</hi> as not parting with the Body of his mortal Enemy, but by the immediate Command of <hi>Jupiter.</hi>

                  <p>This Obſervation excellently juſtifies <hi>Achilles,</hi> in not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging himſelf with the Company of his Miſtreſs: The Hero prevails ſo much over the Lover, that <hi>Thetis</hi> thinks her ſelf oblig'd to recall <hi>Briſeïs</hi> to his Memory.

                  <p>Madam <hi>Dacier</hi> diſapproves of both the former Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: She has recourſe to the Lawfulneſs of ſuch a Practice between <hi>Achilles</hi> and <hi>Briſeïs;</hi> and becauſe ſuch Commerces in thoſe times were reputed honeſt, therefore ſhe thinks the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was decent: The married Ladies are oblig'd to her for this Obſervation, and I hope all tender Mothers, when their Sons are afflicted, will adviſe them to comfort themſelves in this manner.</p>

But perhaps this whole Paſſage may be better explain'd by having recourſe to the Pagan Theology: It was an Opinion that obtain'd in thoſe early Days, that <hi>Jupiter</hi> frequently ſent ſome friendly Meſſengers to protect the Innocent, ſo that <hi>Homer</hi> might intend to give his Readers a Lecture of Mora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, by telling us that this unhappy King was under the Protection of the Gods.</p>
                  <p>Madam <hi>Dacier</hi> carries it farther. <hi>Homer</hi> (ſays ſhe) inſtructed by Tradition, knew that God ſends his Angels to the Succour of the afflicted. The Scripture is full of Examples of this Truth. The Story of <hi>Tobit</hi> has a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Relation with this of <hi>Homer: Tobit</hi> ſent his Son to <hi>Rages,</hi> a City of <hi>Media,</hi> to receive a conſiderable Sum; <hi>Tobias</hi> did not know the Way; he found at his Door a young Man cloath'd with a majeſtick Glory, which attracted Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration: It was an Angel under the Form of a Man. This Angel being ask'd who he was, anſwer'd (as <hi>Mercury</hi> does here) by a Fiction: He ſaid that he was of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that his Name was <hi>Azarias,</hi> and that he was Son of <hi>Ananias.</hi> This Angel conducted <hi>Tobias</hi> in Safety; he gave him Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions; and when he was to receive the Recompence which the Father and Son offer'd him, he declar'd that he was the Angel of the Lord, took his Flight towards heaven, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear'd. Here is a great Conformity in the Ideas and in the Style; and the Example of our Author ſo long before <hi>Tobit,</hi> proves, that this Opinion of God's ſending his Angels to the Aid of Man was very common, and much ſpread a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Pagans in thoſe former Times. <hi>Dacier.</hi>

                  <p>I am of Opinion that ſuch fixed Tents were not uſed by the <hi>Grecians</hi> in their common Marches, but only during the time of Sieges, when their long ſtay in one Place made it neceſſary to build ſuch Tents as are here deſcrib'd; at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times they lay like <hi>Diomed</hi> in the tenth Book, in the open Air, their Spears ſtanding upright, to be ready upon any Alarm; and with the Hides of Beaſts ſpread on the Ground inſtead of a Bed.</p>
                  <p>It is worthy Obſervation that <hi>Homer</hi> even upon ſo trivial an Occaſion as the deſcribing the Tent of <hi>Achilles,</hi> takes an Opportunity to ſhew the ſuperior Strength of his Hero; and tells us that three Men could ſcarce open the Door of his Pavilion, but <hi>Achilles</hi> could open it alone.</p>
