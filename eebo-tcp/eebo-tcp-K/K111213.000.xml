            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>This was the Motive on which Mr <hi>Barnard,</hi> Serjeant Surgeon of perpetual Memory, adopted you in Marriage to his Daughter his only Child.

Care is painful; the Charge of Men, and Women's Lives, and Limbs revolves
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0703400700:9"/>the Surgeon's Breaſt. To retain his Tranquility he is to proceed in his Buſineſs, according to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Maxims, and approved Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of the beſt Practitioners. Learning gives Tranquility of Mind; it points the Road to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Riches.</p>
            <p>IT is a Maxim among Infidels to ſpeak well of all Men as far as Vertue will permit; Slander is baſe, and does recriminate. It is far from me to derogate from the Maſters of your Hoſpital,<note n="*" place="bottom">St. Tho— s.</note> but who among ſuch Folks imparts his Knowledge, and if they do, ought not young Men to proceed in their Reſearch: Reputation loſt, is hardly retrieva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; we are not to riſk this raſhly: On the other Hand, the World is apt to form a great Idea of a Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of an enterprizing Genius; they preſume that his Knowledge

            <p>THE Reduction of Fractures, and Diſlocations is a great and neceſſary Article in a Surgeon's Buſineſs; to decline this, is inconſiſtent with his Character, ſee himſelf poſtponed to a country Fellow, in all other reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects inferior to him. Granting that many of thoſe People ſet Bones at random, you will not eaſily be believed in ſaying ſo, even when they miſcarry. There is Reaſon to retort, that good Surgeons fail in this Caſe, tho' Men are required to ſpeak Truth, it would be a Hardſhip on Surgeons to tell all which they know, or believe: they would confeſs that ſometimes the Swelling confounds them in diſtinguiſhing the Species of Frac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,

            <p>EXCELLENT Directions Will be given to keep the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound-Fracture free from Pain, and without the exfoliating the Bone, cure the Wound with Facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Promptitude. In depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from theſe Rules the menacing Accidents riſing high, the Life of the Diſeaſed is caſt away, or hangs in doubt.</p>
            <p>YOU will be apprized of an Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in a reputed great Author:<note n="*" place="bottom">Wiſeman.</note> this for many Years has been a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling Block to his Practiſing-Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, and ſometimes fatal to the Subject, if he eſcaped with his Life, he underwent a long Weakneſs, and not ſeldom a Deformity in his Limb. I am acquainted with a Gentleman, a ſhameful Example of this Error in two great Surgeons in Concert, one of them a Grandee of the firſt
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0703400700:14"/>Claſs; the Afflicted deplores the Remembrance of his Sorrow, and the Loſs of the Uſe of his Elbow; theſe in a great Meaſure might have been prevented, with no danger of his Life, or Lameneſs, little Pain, loſs of Time, or Expence compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
            <p>BY the Indication of the Pulſe, and of the Urine, you may betimes animate your Digeſtive, then by change of Dreſſing turn gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the redundant Diſcharge to In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carn the Wound, and generate, and confirm the Callous: This Practice muſt needs be juſt, ſeeing that by certain Tokens in the Matter or Diſcharge, this is known to be the Chyle, and indeed the native Balm of the Blood which cures all Wounds. In this Caſe, Old People ſeldom recover their Strength; the Spirit and Balſam of the Blood is
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0703400700:15"/>evaporated: This is become Cadave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous.</p>
            <p>IF I do not take upon me to determine the controverted Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſes in Theory, it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble but in this I ſhall make a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Advance.</p>
            <p>IN this Sentiment you will find yourſelf in Condition to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Books; was I to ſpeak my Opinion of them, I muſt own that there are not many worth reading. It is not hard to comprize in a Sheet or two of Paper, what is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial in ſome of the beſt of them, particularly thoſe of the Practice of Surgery.</p>
            <p>WITH a copious, and beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Variety of Topics, you ſhall have the Occaſional Method of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Preſcription, to digeſt
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0703400700:16"/>Wounds of the Brain, and Wounds of the <hi>Viſcera.</hi> Of all other, Gunſhot Wounds in the Joints are formidable to Nature. Application of actua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, fortifying, and reſolutive Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decines of various Kinds not ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known are to be made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Exigency of the Wound: the Surgeon is to ſteer his Courſe, as it were, between <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rybdis</hi> and <hi>Scylla,</hi> a Rock, and a Sand, as they term it. Without adding Fewel to the burning Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he is to cheriſh the <hi>Genus Ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſam;</hi> from thence the intereſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Soul ſends continually Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours of Animal Spirits in Aid of Nature in the unequal War with her united cruel Enemies Pain, Fever, Thirſt, Burning, Watching, Delirium. In Failure of theſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to rarify, and animate the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſing Blood, to digeſt the Wound, alleviate the Pain, and ſupport or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0703400700:17"/>ſtrengthen the Heart, labouring under the redoubling Pulſe, the mortal Symptoms prevailing; the noble Organs ceaſing to perform their Vital and Animal Functions, the Soul deprived of her Power, is forced to depart.</p>
            <p>YOU ſhould learn to deſpamate, ſecern, and transfer the dangerous Rellux of purulent Matter oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the Blood, and Animal Spirits with Reſtleſsneſs, Fever, <hi>Delirium,</hi> the Hickok, Lethargy, Apoplexy, Convulſions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> the Harbinger of Death.</p>
            <p>UPON a ſudden Suppreſſion of Sweat ſometimes this becomes a Hetorene Humour, and with pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Pain vellicats the <hi>Inteſtines,</hi> the <hi>Miſſentory,</hi> the <hi>Pleura,</hi> the <hi>Mediaſtinum,</hi> the <hi>Pericranium,</hi> and other Parts greatly ſubject to
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0703400700:18"/>Reſentment. Of all Caſes this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baraſſes the Surgeon; Secretion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Work of Nature he cannot appoint the Time, nor till this is accompliſhed hardly obtain a Reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite, or Ceſſation of the Violence: This ſeems to have been the late Caſe of a great King which for what we could perceive his Phyſicians and Surgeons knew, yet like a <hi>Starroſt</hi> with his Hand on his Sabre in Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, they were for defending their Argument in the Antichamber.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laudanum</hi> is our great Anodyne, this we are forbid; it reſtrains the Transfuſion of the Animal Spirits on which depends the Function and Formality of the Parts, alſo the Energy of the ſecerning Blood. A continued Uſe of this Medicine may render the Diſeaſe incurable, or of a long Duration. Purging and Bleeding interrupt Nature: She has choſe to deliver herſelf by
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0703400700:19"/>the denographical, or culicular Glands, and will not be controuled. Perſpirating, Alexipharmic, and Volatile Medicines are of a little Effect till towards the <hi>Criſis;</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture alone maintains the Conflict; Hence it happens that ſometimes ſhe does not overcome till from a Vernal Solſtice chiefly, the Blood has received an Acceſſion of Warmth to ferment, and diſcharge in the Surface.</p>
            <p>SOME Years ago I tended a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman who upon drinking cold Water when hot, and Sweating was ſeized with a violent Pain in the nervous Tunicle of his Bowels. After a tedious Indiſpoſition a large Abſceſs was formed in his Groin. Tho' I opened the Swelling as ſoon as it fluctuated: The Blood and Spirits were ſo tainted, and charged with this foreign Humour,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0703400700:20"/>that he had an accelerated, a low, and an irregular Pulſe; was delirious, had cold clam Sweatings, an Hic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kok, a Diarrhea and a Gangarene round the Border of the Wound; alſo an advanced Mortification on the Inſide of That Knee. In five or ſix Days the Wound diſcharged ſo many Quarts of a lixive, ganger Lymph: When the Mortification was ſtopt and a Separation made one might turn his Hand in the Wound quite to the <hi>Peritoneum</hi> in ſight. Now the mortal Symptoms began to remit: In leſs than five Weeks the Wound was ſicatrized. You will agree that the Cure depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on proper Internals; had there been a Defect in the Dreſſings he muſt have periſhed, ſo he would had I fatigued him with Pain.</p>
            <p>BETWEEN two and three Years ago, one Mrs <hi>Gyles,</hi> had for
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0703400700:21"/>Year before, a continual Diarrhea, or <hi>Lienterria;</hi> the Chyle, or Nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment, ran off, the greateſt Part of it before it entered the Lacteals. In the Spring of the Year a large, cold, white, fluctuating Swelling grew on her right <hi>Hypondria</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Ribs. From the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhe had an aching Pain ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deep into the Liver; the Seat or Source of her Indiſpoſition; a ſuppreſſed Sweat transferred. A conſiderable Surgeon in Town told her to be well adviſed in whom ſhe truſted, and that he did not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the Swelling too ſoon. In a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Week I ſtopt the Looſneſs: In eight, or nine Days more the Swelling became warm, and red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſh, but frightfully increaſed in Bigneſs: I told her now was the Time; ſhe yielding, I opened the Swelling with a Lancet; there was a Baſon of a Quart and half a Pint of
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0703400700:22"/>formed Matter catcht; here and there ſtreaked with Blood, toward the End. She, and others who ſaw the ſhifted Cloths and Bedding did believe that in 48 Hours the Wound did run a Gallon, and in four Nights two Quarts more; in all Six Quarts. The Return of the Diarrhea was what I apprehended moſt: This happened the firſt Night attended with cold, clam Sweating, a trembling Pulſe, and Fainting; ſo again the ſecond Night; and were as often taken off. In few Days more ſhe mended daily, and in three Weeks was quite well: Then ſhe grew Fat, Healthful, and Strong. She is lately married to <hi>James Taylor,</hi> a White-ſmith in <hi>Hatfield-ſtreet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN five Weeks I cured a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman of a large Mortification in her Loins extending on the <hi>Os
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0703400700:23"/>Sacrum,</hi> and the <hi>Coxis,</hi> to affect the Sphinctures of the <hi>Anus,</hi> and the Bladder, cut off the Courſe of the Spirits, that ſhe rendered her Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crements involuntary. In the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning ſhe had a Fever of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, a Delirium, cold Sweatings, and a Syncopa.</p>
            <p>THESE Cures well underſtood, and the Medicines given will, with Variations, be a Precedent in many Grand Caſes; nor are the Internal Things mentioned in any Book on ſuch Occaſions; yet which no Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſian, or Surgeon, ſpeaking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Prejudice, can diſavow: They will, and muſt needs own that if any one ever was, theſe People, all of them by Medicine, were brought back from the Gates of the Grave.</p>
            <p>WHAT deſerves Remark; there was no Ruburb, or Aſtringent, no
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0703400700:24"/>Opiate, or Theriaca given in the Diarrhea, the Cortex ſuſpends, or reſtrains Secretion; ſo does <hi>Lau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danum:</hi> This ſhuts the Avenues of the Nerves, binding, or cente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Animal Spirits, it leavens the Blood, and oppoſes Digeſtion and Re-union. I ſhall occaſionally ſpeak farther of theſe Medicines, and how they may be given ſafely; here they would have been mortal by Reaſon of the Nervous Fever.</p>
            <p>IN caſe of a Collection in the <hi>Mediaſtinum, De Verney</hi> ſays we may trepan the <hi>Sternum.</hi> He was Profeſſor of Anatomy in the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Garden at <hi>Paris,</hi> and probably the greateſt that ever lived, taken throughout.

His Courſe of Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my laſted from the Beginning of <hi>September</hi> till the end of <hi>March,</hi> all the Week (Sundays, and Holidays excepted) from Morning till Night, an Hour at Noon allowed. He was Forty Years Royal-Profeſſor; had read all valuable Books; was thought to be one of the greateſt Orators in <hi>France.</hi> Being of eaſy Acceſs his Scholars had a fair Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of Improvement.

<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0703400700:38"/>Conſiſtent with this Demonſtrative Propoſition it is found that the Excoriation, or Ulcer of the <hi>Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates</hi>-Glands is always antecedent to the <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> whereas that of the <hi>Lucanae</hi> does not happen of ſome time after, ſooner, or later, according to the Heat, and Sharp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Urine, and of the Run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from the <hi>Proſtates,</hi> ſo the Excoriation or Ulcer of the <hi>Lacunae</hi> can be only an Effect, or Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of thoſe Symptoms: I mean that the Heat, and Sharpneſs of the Urine, and of the vitiated Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Ulcer in the <hi>Proſtates</hi> paſſing often through the <hi>Urethra</hi> does chafe, and fret the thin and tender Membrane of the <hi>Lacunae,</hi> ſo occaſions an Ulcer, or Excoriati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this Part.</p>
            <p>IN a long and great Diſcharge the <hi>Proſtates</hi> are found to waſte,
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0703400700:39"/>and in the End to ſhrink, and ſhrivel to almoſt nothing, while the Excoriation of the <hi>Lacunae</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains without Alteration. Theſe Reaſons riſe to a Demonſtration of my Aſſertion. The Experiment may ſoon be made in the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
            <p>THE Succus or Juice of the <hi>Proſtates,</hi> is the Vehicle which conveys the Volatile Semen into the <hi>Uterus.</hi> When this is ſpent, and the <hi>Proſtates</hi> withered, Men become incapable of Procreation, but fertile Nature recovers ſome, as by a Miracle.</p>
            <p>AS in the <hi>Proſtates,</hi> a long, and great Diſcharge of Matter or Nutritious Juice from the <hi>Lacunae</hi> would run ſinous the cavernous Body of the <hi>Penis,</hi> and give as little Trouble to cure it.</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0703400700:40"/>
            <p>WE ſhould find it impractible to reſtore the Maſculine Proportion of the <hi>Penis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT theſe Accidents do not happen; therefore the Seat of the <hi>Gonorrhaea,</hi> is not in the <hi>Lacunae.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I was bred in St <hi>Thomas</hi>'s, <hi>Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital,</hi> under Mr <hi>William Coates<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth:</hi> After this I was two Years under the celebrated <hi>De Verney</hi> at <hi>Paris,</hi> and in the Hoſpitals there.</p>
            <p>A great Man in Town was my Pupil: Now he is a Phyſician, he does not ſcruple to own that he formed himſelf chiefly on the Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which I taught him. His Father was a Surgeon of good Account; he choſe me to educate his Son preferable to any Man in Town; ſo he uſed to ſay. I have bred ſeveral other Surgeons: Some
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0703400700:41"/>of them are much ſought to in ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Bones.</p>
            <p>DR <hi>James Keill</hi> was a Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man no leſs valued for his Integri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than his Knowledge in Anato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; I have inſerted a Certificate from him.</p>
            <p>TAKE down in Writing three or four remarkable caſes in Cure in your Hoſpital according to the Number and order of your Queries, I will Account for the Appearances from the Fabric, the Function, and Situation of the Parts.</p>
            <p>HAVE you a mind to hear ſomething previous: Inquire out a Profeſſor of Anatomy. I will meet him at his appointed Time, and Place, to anſwer and queſtion him on this Subject. If he thinks fit the controverted Points ſhall be

                  <p>THE Swelling in your Lady's Throat is what Surgeons call the <hi>Bronchocele,</hi> or <hi>Hernia Gutterii;</hi> but to ſpeak in particular; I ſay it is a Diſtention of the Glands <hi>Thyroides.</hi> They are two in Number ſituated on the oppoſite Sides of the <hi>Larynx,</hi> and the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Part of the <hi>Aſpira Arteria</hi> ſinking to the flexible Part of the <hi>Anular Cartilages.</hi> The uſe of theſe Glands is to ſtrain from the Blood, a vicous glairous Liquor, to lubrify the <hi>Cartilages</hi> of the <hi>Larynx</hi> to facilitate their Motion. They as well as other Glands are greatly ſubject to cold Defluxions. They are the principal Fountains,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0703400700:43"/>and Recervatories of the <hi>Lympha.</hi> Thus we may believe that this cold Humour is alſo ſent thither from the ſalivary Sources, and other Glands adjacent. It is eaſy to think that as the <hi>Thyroides</hi> Glands ſwell, and take up a greater ſpace, they preſs the flexible part of the <hi>Anular Cartilages</hi> aforeſaid, oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to yield; they ſtraiten the <hi>Trachia Arteria:</hi> This occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the great Difficulty of Breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and threatning of Suffoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>ON this principle we render Reaſon for the loſs of her Voice: The Recrurent Nerves ſuffers a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion: Animal Spirits are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Muſcles to play the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilages of the <hi>Larynx</hi> to form the Voice. She is worſe when with Child, on Account that the Blood and Humours are more determined
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0703400700:44"/>to the ſuperior Parts, eſpecially in that as the <hi>Abdomen</hi> grows big it preſſes the <hi>Diaphragma</hi> againſt the Lungs, ſo leſſens the Capacity of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and hinders Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. Parallel to this is the Caſe of Dropſical People alway oppreſt with ſhortneſs of Breath: I mean in the true Aſcites when the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Belly is filled with Water.</p>
                  <p>THE great Swelling gives Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe that the whole Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of theſe Glands is ſapped, and diſtended with this cold Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour like a ſpunge in Water; the ſojourn of which has rendered their Texture ſo extremely lax, that they will not recover their Reſort; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently not admit of cure.

            <p>THE Reverend Mr <hi>John Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardſon,</hi> Preceptor to <hi>Baptiſt Noel</hi> Earl of <hi>Gainsborough,</hi> was for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years almoſt inceſſantly tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented with a Suppreſſion of Urine, and Strangury from a Stone in the Bladder. Sometimes he has ſtaggered about the Room with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſive Pain.</p>
            <p>THE firſt time that I introducted my <hi>Curve-Catheter</hi> he urined through this Inſtrument, and the Pain did remit. Next Day I turned a ſecond Time the ragged Stone on the Smooth Part, and his Pain and Provocation went off. Excepting ſome ſhort Fits of Pain, and Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gury he urined regularly for three Months. In uſing may <hi>Cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> in this Manner <hi>three</hi> or <hi>four</hi> Times a Year, he enjoyed a Life of Tranquility for Six Years till
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0703400700:61"/>he died, 1706. He was Fellow of <hi>Emanuel</hi> College in <hi>Cambridge,</hi> and his Vindication of the <hi>Canon</hi> of the New <hi>Teſtament,</hi> will perpetuate his Venerable Character in the learned World.</p>
            <p>HOW many are tormented with a Suppreſſion of Urine, and Strangury from drinking Stale Beer, or prickt Wine, ſometimes an Obſtruction happens from an Excreſcence in the Neck of the Bladder, or in the <hi>Urethra.</hi> In all which Caſes the afflicted may expect. Relief from my <hi>Catheter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I glide this Inſtrument under the <hi>Pubis</hi> into the Bladder, with either Hand from above-below, or below-above, without Pain, or Blood even in fencing with the Stone, if the Paſſage be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready excoriated. With this Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0703400700:62"/>we puſh the Stone twice with the <hi>Curve,</hi> the <hi>Conoex</hi> and the <hi>Concave</hi> Part having as it were a greater hold, this gives a better Chance to turn the Stone than when they ſtrike with the Point of the <hi>Strait-Catheter.</hi> Now the Stone returns on the ragged Side to keep up the Pain, and Provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
