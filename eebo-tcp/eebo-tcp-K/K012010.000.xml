            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PRELIMINARY INTRODUCTION TO SEA-BATHING.</head>
            <p>IT may be proper to inform the READER, that, in compliance with the requeſt of ſome highly diſtinguiſhed gentlemen of the faculty, I have undertaken to write on the nature, power, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and effect of Sea-water and Sea-bathing, cold and hot, and ſubmitted the manuſcripts to be read before a learned MEDICAL SOCIETY, in <hi>London;</hi> and alſo to be reviewed by ſundry learned medical friends; and the reports on them are highly flattering, but which it may be prudent to conceal till the public opinion is known.</p>
            <p>The ſubject matter, thus aſſigned me to ſift and handle, is ſufficiently intereſting; and ſtands in
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0648600600:3"/>much need of farther inveſtigation. Sea-bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is certainly more practiſed, at the preſent day, than a knowledge of it is yet poſſeſſed. There is in it great room to advance, explain, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force, and reſtrain. What I deliver ſhall, though connected, be in diſtinct tracts, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to relieve the reader, and make them come eaſy to the purchaſer: the whole will be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of long practical experience, and the facts ſupported by reſpectable living evidence, of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the faculty on the coaſt, and long-ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſagacious ſea-bathing guides, male and female, at MARGATE. Where any thing is left doubtful or equivocal, it is for profeſſional men, reſident at the ſea-watering places, to advance a ſtep farther, and add to, and refine on, my arguments, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the deſign; and by their being thus faithful interpreters of the hidden treaſures of nature, will manifeſt themſelves to be what they profeſs, the <hi>guardians</hi> of health, and the truly adopted ſons and heirs of <hi>Apollo,</hi> the Inventor of Medicine. <hi>Diviſum ſic breve fiet opus.</hi> None elſe are, or can be competent to the taſk; as ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathing involves in it a knowledge of the animal oeconomy, and of general medical practice, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on juſt phyſical reaſoning; call it theory if you will. Experience without nice conception of the truths neceſſary, demonſtrable by reaſon, to enable us to draw juſt deductions from the pheno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mena,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0648600600:4"/>for application to particular objects, is no experience at all: it is worſe than none; for it involves in obſcurity, and fixes an idea in the mind, narrow in its compaſs, hazardous in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize, and often falſe in the concluſion; ſo that it brings nothing to the temple of truth and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and, neither promotes, completes, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuates to new inventions or any uſeful diſcovery of the ſeveral dependencies, cauſes, and connexion of things, ſo far as comes within the ken of human intelligence. All theory beyond this, is as vain and fruitleſs as that of ſimple curs barking and leaping after the wild birds of the ſky, or at the light of, and ſpecks in the moon. There is not the ſame <hi>Libertas philoſophica</hi> in <hi>Ars Medica</hi> as in <hi>Licentia poetica</hi> for the flights of fancy. As ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culative literature is baſeleſs, our faith is left free; nothing leſs than ſolid truth can be reſted on; it is the great barrier againſt the floods of error, ignorance, and ſceptical hypotheſis, or fictious ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry. In truth, there is certitude, of what is good or bad: in ignorance, diffidence, doubt, and danger.</p>
            <q>
               <l>"So want of knowing truth doth fools delude,</l>
               <l>And error from the right way doth exclude,</l>
               <l>All thoſe that doubt;"—</l>
               <bibl>HORACE.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>The <hi>Stoics</hi> eſteem him mad who is blindly led by ignorance inſtead of truth. Diffidence and obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacy,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0648600600:5"/>though oppoſite in themſelves, are both in the line of defection. Diffidence is no juſt excuſe for the concealment of an important fact; others may theorize thereon. Theory helps us out in the knowledge of reaſons and cauſes, for ſettling our judgments upon the beſt and moſt rational prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>Theory and practice, like two heavenly bodies, attract light on each other: the one without the other is like the ſtatue of <hi>Polyphemus</hi> without an eye, or a lamp without oil. Every man hath ſome theory or other—good or bad:—his cannot be wrong whoſe practice is uniformly ſucceſsful: it is in full proof, if actions are allowed to be ſtronger than words. In ſtrict logic, it is not allowed to paſs from the hypotheſis to the theſis: the hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetical principle muſt be proved, before the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences can be admitted: opinion muſt be implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or reſolution determined, before reaſons for that opinion can be known: illuſtration and juſt repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, by example, is required to enlighten and inſtruct the underſtanding, or the truth of a doctrine cannot be confirmed, or its principles eſtabliſhed. Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> ſays, "As in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics, ſo in natural philoſophy, the inveſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of difficult things, by way of analyſis, ought ever to precede the method of compoſition. This analyſis conſiſts in making experiments and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0648600600:6"/>and in drawing general concluſions from them by induction, and admitting of no objections againſt the concluſions, but ſuch as are taken from experiments and obſervations, or other certain truths: and although the arguing from experiments and obſervations by induction, be no demonſtration of general concluſions, yet it is the beſt way of reaſoning, which the nature of things admit of, and may be looked upon as ſo much the ſtronger, by how much the induction is more general: and if no exception occur from phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena, the concluſion may be pronounced ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally. But if at any time afterwards, any exceptions do occur from experiments, it may be pronounced, with ſuch exceptions as ſhall occur. By this way of analyſis, we may proceed from compounds to ingredients, and from motions to the forces producing them; and in general from effects to their cauſes, and from particular cauſes to more general ones, till the argument ends in the moſt general." <hi>Op.</hi> p. 380. l. 31.</p>
            <p>The theory required, founded on the light of nature, concerning man, his diſeaſes, affections, (bodily and mental) dependencies, mutations, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſiſications, reſiſtances, ſympathies and antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, indicating and contra-indicating ſymptoms, concordant and diſcordant opinions and principles, together with the force and influence of the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netary
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0648600600:7"/>ſyſtem on our orb, is infinite, obſcure, and marvellous to human wiſdom, yet does honour to the eternal immutable <hi>Being,</hi> who hath not only created, but preſerveth the variety. There is nothing without its counteracting opponent: there is no diſeaſe without its antidote: vice, hath virtue: hatred, love: malevolence, charity:—the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oriſts oppoſe; and, by their oppoſing opinions, truth comes out, and the arts and ſciences are refined and improved. This ſyſtem of oppoſition is maintained throughout the whole animal and vegetable creation:
<q>
                  <l>"All nature is but art unknown to thee;</l>
                  <l>All chance, direction, which thou canſt not ſee;</l>
                  <l>All diſcord, harmony not underſtood;</l>
                  <l>All partial Evil, univerſal Good:</l>
                  <l>And, ſpite of Pride, in erring Reaſon's ſpite,</l>
                  <l>One truth is clear, <hi>Whatever is, is Right."</hi>
                  </l>
                  <bibl>POPE.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>All theories may be referred to the general laws of motion. Sea-bathing comprehends in it the powers and qualities of fluidity, gravity, preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, attraction, repulſion, ſtimulation, friction, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, and velocity; cold, heat, humidity, dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, effluvia, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>If what I offer to the public ſhall meet with a reception equal to the intention, to awaken and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade my fellow creatures, upon rational grounds, to keep out of the road that leads to pain, ſorrow,
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0648600600:8"/>and premature death, and embrace health, that ineſtimable bleſſing which gives reliſh to all our enjoyments, my ambition will be amply gratified in being permitted to add my mite to the public fund of preſervatory knowledge.</p>
            <p>Although I write from the locality of my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, yet the obſervations I have made, the important facts I have induſtriouſly collected, and the dubious points I have more fully aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained, are ſo general as to ſerve equally well for every other eligible ſea-bathing place at home or abroad.</p>
            <p>Neither the advantages of Sea-bathing, at <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate,</hi> nor the ſalubrious property of the air of <hi>Thanet,</hi> have hitherto commanded medical atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion equal to what their importance deſerve, conſequently are not ſufficiently known to the public. <hi>Res ipſa loquitur.</hi> Sea-bathing has cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly worked its own way more than by any induſtry of the <hi>ſaculty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>During twelve years and upwards that I reſided at KINGSTON, <hi>Surry,</hi> before I came to <hi>Margate,</hi> though I was allowed to be fortunate, under heaven, in relieving pain and diſtreſs, yet I wiſh to throw a veil over my ignorance of the power and effects of <hi>Sea-bathing,</hi> as of thoſe I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0648600600:9"/>to it, ſome returned no better, ſome worſe; and ſome I ſent to the cold ſea-bath whom I ought to have ſent to the warm, <hi>et vice verſa,</hi> which I candidly acknowledged in my <hi>Medical Remarks</hi> the moment I knew better, wherefore there is but too much room to conclude, that all thoſe who returned benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, were more indebted to chance than to any preciſe judgment or theory of mine. I have to plead for it, I was an inland practiſer, when all my knowledge of it was derived from the very few practical treatiſes I had ſeen, or could obtain on the ſubject; and neither of thoſe I ſaw were ſo perfect as to give me adequate ideas of it for practice: ſome, in ſome things, egre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly miſled me: ſome others were miſled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and it making no part of academical education, my mind was not prompted to conſider the efficacy of Sea-water as any thing beyond that of a mere waſh for a foul ſkin, whereas there is no part, I will ſay, of the whole <hi>materia medica,</hi> yet known ſo extenſively efficacious, under judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious direction, or detrimental, under indiſcreet, ill-timed management. If it was not capable of doing harm, it would be incapable of doing good.</p>
            <p>In thoſe ſimples which dwell the moſt viru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent poiſons, dwell alſo, the moſt potent, ſalutary virtues:
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0648600600:10"/>
               <q>
                  <l>"There is ſome ſoul goodneſs in things evil,</l>
                  <l>Would men obſervingly diſtil it out."</l>
                  <bibl>SHAKESPEARE.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The moſt capital things of nature lie generally out of the common track; and, therefore the man who aims at great and uſeful diſcovery, muſt take much upon himſelf, for few will follow until the point is fully aſcertained; and it is well if he does not meet with diſcouragement for his diligent inquiry.</p>
            <p>In proportion to our confidence, proficiency, and enlarged views of nature, ſo are the miſeries of mankind abridged, and the means are multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for yielding a comfortable exiſtence. It is for me, and for every one of us, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the important charge of lives, to open and expand our ideas, for receiving more ample and more enlarged views of the diſcoverable things of nature, her ſilent ways, the diſpenſations of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and the exigencies of man; which, if every one did, we ſhould ſee fewer improper objects arrive at the ſea-watering places, with very inadequate directions and large packages of compounded drugs, which no rational practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner, phyſician, or apothecary, can act with and under, by which ſome have ſeverely ſuffered, others received no benefit, and the water forſooth,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0648600600:11"/>blamed for what it had no hand in. <hi>Lamentabili dictu!</hi>—None have fuffered at MARGATE, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the indiſcreet and unthinking, or who have been ſo unfortunate as to be badly adviſed and injudiciouſly directed, no matter whether by thoſe on the coaſt or inland, who have not yet acquired a competent knowledge of the ſtate, qualities, powers, order, affinity, and appropriation of the objects of nature to the ſeminal and radical cauſes of diſtemper, or the patients ability of body to ſuſtain the propoſed means for receiving relief.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved ſome to have come, and, under judicious direction, receive much benefit; come a ſecond time, reſting on their own judgment and experience, and ſuffer.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who are dead and inſenſible to all the warm emotions and pleaſing ſenſations that reſult from the act of ſelf-preſervation—the <hi>amor ſui</hi>—we cannot expect to reſuſcitate. I ſay with <hi>Horace:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>"Let none but learned doctors phyſic give,</l>
                  <l>Let each mechanic by his calling live."</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And with <hi>Pliny:</hi>
               <q>"The arts would be happy if only artiſts might judge of them and practiſe them."</q>
            </p>
            <p>By an improper application of ſea-bathing, through ignorance, the intention of the bath is
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0648600600:12"/>fruſtrated, the ſymptoms of a complaint aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, new fatal ones brought on, and the voice of nature is ſilenced. That eloquent, and much enlightened genius, the late Dr. <hi>JOHN MORGAN,</hi> Profeſſor of Medicine in the College of <hi>Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,</hi> in his Anniverſary Diſcourſe, publiſhed in 1765, has the following ſpirited paſſage, which does honour to his humanity.</p>
            <p>"Should we," ſays he, "for a moment turn our eyes upon the man, who dares to enter upon the practice of phyſic, without being properly initiated into the ſcience, or inſtructed in the important duties of the profeſſion, he would ſoon preſent us with a melancholy proſpect. If not paſt all feelings of humanity, what compunctions of conſcience, what remorſe would not fill his breaſt from practiſing at random and in the dark; not knowing whether his preſcriptions might prove a wholeſome remedy or a deſtructive poiſon. To diſcover the nature of an uncommon diſeaſe, or to account for an unuſual ſymptom, puzzles his invention.—Ignorant of every true principle, from which, by juſt reaſoning, he might be able to deduce practical inferences, he knows not what prognoſtic to make, or what plan of treatment to obſerve—Unſteady and irreſolute, he attempts a variety of means; ſuch as either avail not, or ſuch as heighten the danger of the diſeaſe, already too
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0648600600:13"/>violent, he may thus interrupt the ſalutary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of nature, or, not knowing how to ſecond them, tamper with the life of the patient, and idly waiting to ſee what nature herſelf is capable of doing, neglect to ſuccour her, till it is too late, and the fatal hand of death is juſt cloſing the gloomy ſcene.—Wretched is the caſe of thoſe whom chance, or miſinformed judgment, ſhall throw into his hands, to fall victims of his te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merity—Great is the havock which his ignorance ſpreads on every ſide, robbing the affectionate huſband of his darling ſpouſe, or rendering the tender wife a helpleſs widow;—increaſing the number of orphans;—mercileſſly depriving them of their parents ſupport;—bereaving the afflicted parents of their only comfort and hope, by the untimely death of their beloved infants, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whole families deſolate. Remorſeleſs ſoe to human kind! Actuated by more than ſavage cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty! Hold, hold, thy exterminating hand!—</p>
            <p>"Glad ſhould I be to moderate this too exact deſcription of the effects of ignorant and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous practice; but what judgment can we paſs on thoſe, who have been ſcarcely inſtructed in the firſt elements of medical ſcience, and yet force themſelves into practice, as if they meant to ſport themſelves with human life and human ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities?"</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0648600600:14"/>
            <p>If medicine be allowed to be a great bleſſing in the hands of the ſagacious and wiſe, and as a ſword in the hands of the fooliſh and furious, ſo is ſea-bathing. Too much being aſſumed and taken for granted, is the reaſon ſo little progreſs has hitherto been made in its theory for guiding the hand of practice. The greateſt enemy to wiſdom and prudence is precipitation.</p>
            <p>Nine years ago I happened to come to MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CATE in queſt of ſtrength, after a long and ſevere fever; and receiving a very ſenſible benefit the firſt ſeaſon by ſea-bathing, and the ſalubrious air of <hi>Thanet,</hi> I was thereon led to make inquiry into their ſpecial effects on other viſitors, and what I actually ſaw, and was credibly informed of by ſome of the bathing guides, I thought important, and it not being generally known, I immediately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed it in my <hi>Medical Remarks on Evacuations.</hi> Since that time, I have had frequent opportunity of obſerving more minutely their effects on others under various ſtates, circumſtances, and conditions of body: in ſimple and complicated, acute and chronic, caſual and inherent complaints; and every year's experience gives manifold proofs of their very great utility to health: they reſtore and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve. There are but few diſtempers incident to human nature in which either the cold, the warm, or vapour ſea-water bath, and the air of a ſalu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brious ſpot on the margin of the main, ſuch as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0648600600:15"/>
               <hi>Thanet,</hi> are not equal to meet and prove more or leſs beneficial in. I have ſeen, on a well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected courſe, diſeaſes not only palliated, but many cured by them, after having baffled the power of medicine in rational artiſts hands. Theſe baths are certainly moſt excellent auxiliaries to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, diet, exerciſe, and amuſement, as theſe are to them, which accounts for the great flux and re-flux of company, from the king to the beggar, to, and from the ſea-watering places, during the temperate ſeaſons;
<q>"Where Baths give vigour and the Waters health."</q>
            </p>
            <p>Or, as a late ingenious MARGATE viſitant to mount <hi>Parnaſsus</hi> deſcribes it;
<q>
                  <l>"The briny wave doth thouſands ſave,</l>
                  <l>Alike from Grave and Crutches;</l>
                  <l>Makes Aged young, the feeble ſtrong,</l>
                  <l>Or Beggar, Duke, or Ducheſs."</l>
                  <bibl>COLEMAN.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Sea-water is not a mere ſimple homogeneous elemental fluid <hi>ſimplex ſimplicitur,</hi> but nature's richly ſaturated compound. It contains, ſay che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical philoſophers, a muriatic bitter purging ſalt, calcarious earth, and ſulphureous bitumen: and <hi>Boyle,</hi> and other naturaliſts agree in there being a ſubtle aetherial ſpirit in water, which ſome call fixed air, ſome phlogiſton or inflammable air, beſides a pure air, which airs become elaſtic, as ſeen by the ſparkling air bubbles.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0648600600:16"/>
            <p>The proportion of the principles of ſea-water vary in ſome diſtant ſeas, and in deep and in ſhallow water: ſome ſay the ſea is more ſalt in ſummer than in winter, warmer in a tempeſt than in a calm. There is in ſea-water, beſides its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal native principles, the impregnation of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marine plants, ſuch as the <hi>Quercus Marinus,</hi> or ſea-wreck, and other plants; the ſlime, ſperm, and excrementitious parts of fiſhes; their, and other dead bodies, rain, dew, hail, ſnow, ſprings, and the diſemboguing of rivers and ponds; together with foſſils, minerals, and the refuſe of ſhips, &amp;c. the combination of all which heterogeneous par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles render ſea-water, on ſtagnation and being cloſe kept, quickly corruptible. After a long calm at ſea the ſtench is very offenſive, and that which iſſues forth on opening a caſk of ſea-water, that has been kept for ſome time in the hold of a ſhip, is intolerable, nay deadly. If it were not for the tides there would be no living near the ſea in a calm. As the aerial ſpirit in waters is extremely fugitive, they are all better drank on the ſpot than at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and the more they are crowded with their principles they ſpoil the ſooner.</p>
            <p>The ſea-beach on the coaſt of <hi>Thanet</hi> is made up of fine ſand, intermixed with chalk that breaks off from the cliffs after intenſe long continued froſt, and is melted by the flowing tides: thoſe
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0648600600:17"/>cliffs that gave to <hi>Britain</hi> the ancient name of <hi>Albion:</hi>
               <q>
                  <l>"That pale, that white-faced ſhore,</l>
                  <l>Whoſe foot ſpurns back th' ocean's roaring tides."</l>
                  <bibl>SHAKESPEARE.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus, there is a bottom that is remarkably clean, ſoft, ſmooth, yet invariably firm and gently ſloping from the fending banks, which render <hi>Thanet</hi>'s coaſt very inviting to bathe.</p>
            <p>The ſea-water at MARGATE is not only pure, but ſtrong of its native principles, by reaſon no rivers run into the ocean to make it muddy and brackiſh nearer than the <hi>Thames</hi> and <hi>Medway,</hi> both thirty miles to the weſtward, and theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled back again by the flood tide.</p>
            <p>The firſt three or four years I ſtood a mere ſpectator and inquirer into the power, influence, and effects of ſea-bathing before ever I thought myſelf competent to direct a courſe of it: it was to me a new ſtudy, though an ancient practice; for <hi>Homer</hi> tells us, that <hi>Ulyſses</hi> and his comrades bathed in warm water and in the ſea to refreſh themſelves after fatigue, before they dined. He mentions purifyng the <hi>Atrides</hi> in the ſea.</p>
            <p>Although we have the teſtimony and ſuffrage of ſome of the greateſt philoſophers and ſage phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0648600600:18"/>in the different ages of the world, for the cold ſpring and ſoft tepid baths being the moſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal remedies in the whole compaſs of nature; yet in a medicinal light they are far, very far inferior in efficacy to the warm and cold ſea-water baths, only they are not ſo convenient or ſo eaſy for all, at all times, to come at. If few ſpeak for, few ſpeak againſt them, becauſe they are not compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of their power and effects; and, if they are not of their ill as well as good, we cannot take their ſilence to be ſuffrage.</p>
            <p>At firſt I met with much difficulty in obtaining intelligence; for the faculty, and the ſea-bathing guides at MARGATE, all told me they never had been put on the line of obſerving; for, if they had, they ſaid they could have furniſhed me with many important facts of the power and effect, both good and ill, of ſea-bathing:
<q>
                  <l>"They build on ſands, which unmov'd they find,</l>
                  <l>'Tis becauſe there was no wind."</l>
                  <bibl>COWLEY.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>And my not meeting with a ſcrip on the ſubject in any of the libraries that afforded me the leaſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, I had to perſevere in wading through thick ſhades of darkneſs till I came into fair light, when I clearly ſaw the impropriety of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving all that came without exeeption, as if ſea-bathing
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0648600600:19"/>was an univerſal ſovereign ſpecific remedy for all complaints, whatever were their nature or cauſe; was proper at all times, and ſuited to all conſtitutions, temperaments, ſtates, and conditions of body, modes of living; and that by one mode of bathing only, and of puſhing the bath indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately beyond what nature can bear. Can there be any error, theoretical or practical, more abſurd or unphiloſophical? Art is ſubſervient to nature; to relieve, poliſh, and improve nature. If nature and art do not go hand in hand, and mutually accord, nothing will be perfected or eſtabliſhed in any art or ſcience. Nature will be led, but not driven.</p>
            <p>Although many diſcoveries are made in natural hiſtory, yet many are ſtill to make, and the point of view neceſſary to place many things in for a juſt application is ſtill much wanting, defective, and but imperfectly underſtood. This we may apply to ſea-bathing as much as to any part of medical practice. When we talk of ſea-bathing being efficacious in this, or in that complaint, we muſt mean to comprehend with it the ſtate and condition of body at the time it has to operate upon. The cold ſpring and ſoft tepid baths may almoſt wholly be referred to <hi>ſtrictum</hi> and <hi>laxum,</hi> even the <hi>Sainted Wells,</hi> in which they are very powerful.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0648600600:20"/>
            <p>Having ſeven years ago cautioned the MAR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>GATE bathing guides againſt receiving any ailing perſons, except with, and by the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frage of the faculty; and the guides them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſeeing the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>priety of this, from ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate accidents that happened that ſeaſon and before, to improper and unprepared perſons; to ſome of whom I had been called, but too late in ſome inſtances for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t to reſtore; I have not ſeen or heard of any ſince ſuffering violence by ſea-bathing. I had no other way to prevent embarraſſment that might in future acrue to ignorant and miſled perſons. The guides were not to blame; they were not competent, and their bread depends wholly on the multiplicity that bathe. We muſt rather impute to viſitors themſelves neglecting to apply for proper advice on the ſpot, which the pooreſt perſon that comes recommended may have. The French have a true ſaying of the Engliſh in reſpect to their health, which is, "that they do not think themſelves ſick ſoon enough, and they think themſelves well too ſoon."</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding of the many drawbacks on ſea-bathing, whilſt the bountiful ocean anſwers the peremptory demands of thouſands and tens of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of proper claiments every year, it muſt ever be ſolicited aad embraced by the ſons and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of affliction. Still it is no univerſal <hi>panacea;</hi>
               <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0648600600:21"/>its gifts are by no means appropriated for, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed to all; nor are all applicants equally ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving them. There neither is, or can be any univerſal remedy to ſuperſede all the other parts of GOD'S creation:—do away all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of compariſon—invert the order of nature, and leave nothing for the inquiry, intelligence, or employment of man:
<q>
                  <l>"Take but degree away, unhinge that ſtring,</l>
                  <l>And hark what diſcord follows: each thing meets</l>
                  <l>In mere appugnancy."</l>
                  <bibl>SHAKESPEARE.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>A generous cordial to a perſon fainting and ſatigued, is a comfortable reviving thing, but fiery ardent ſpirit to one with a hot ſtomach and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed blood, is adding fuel to the fire, or like giving a man a ſoporiferous draught in a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy. How often, alas! have I ſeen the miſery of a diſorder thus confirmed by injudicious, ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timed adminiſtration, that a judicious phyſician would, by quite an oppoſite treatment, have eaſily ſubdued. How often, on the other hand, have I rejoicingly beheld many a valuable life, that had been diſpaired of by one ſet of men, reſtored ſpeedily by others, who attended more minutely to the nice diſcriminating circumſtances of nature, for facilitating the means ſhe uſes in her conflict with death. Though fifteen or twenty years ſince, ſome of theſe live uſeful members of ſociety; yet
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0648600600:22"/>how few are theſe, comparatively ſpeaking, to the number of drowned perſons reſtored annually to life by the Humane Society, after vital action in the heart, arteries and reſpiratory organs, had, for almoſt an incredible length of time, been ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended? And alſo to the number of great cures performed in our hoſpitals, after the complaints had baffled the art of ſagacious private practiſers? which ſhews the advantage of art where rational men of the faculty have ſtrict juſtice done to their practice:</p>
            <q>Hoc eſt Vivere bis poſse priore frui.</q>
            <p>Every inſtance of reſuſcitation corroborates to ſerve as a ſpur to us not to abandon nature too ſoon in her difficulties, when we every day ſee what ſhe is capable of doing for giving relief in diſtreſs, with a little judicious well-timed help: but though the benignant hand of providence continues to anticipate on many occaſions, the interpoſition of art by effecting her own work; yet men of judgment, underſtanding, experience, and obſervation, know that ſhe is frequently inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted and retarded therein by the officious hands of ignorance, temerity, and profeſſional <hi>juglers.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>"An honeſt man's the nobleſt work of God."</q>
            <p>Perſeverence in doing good to our diſtreſſed fellow creatures is the crown and perfection of all
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0648600600:23"/>virtues: every other principle of virtue attends it. If there are any ulcered ſouls that think this a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, or a drawback on trade, let not their judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment counteract or ſilence the voice of nature— the will of their <hi>creator</hi> and <hi>preſerver.</hi> Let them conſider, if the world was made for <hi>Caeſar,</hi> it was for <hi>Titus</hi> too.</p>
            <p>Thoſe only who are in familiar habits with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, can know any thing of her ways and the methods ſhe takes in cauſing, and carrying off diſeaſe, and purifying the blood of noxious par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, that aſſociate with the maſs and bear down the fabric. The art is not to render the blood by the remedy in a worſe ſtate than it found it; which every medicine will do if injudiciouſly uſed, and the moſt potent one too the ſooneſt.</p>
            <p>To treat a diſeaſe rationally, it is not only ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to know the remedy, but the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution and acquired diatheſis of the blood it has to act upon. The ſagacious phyſician has many ſigns and tokens given him for his guide in the local and univerſal complaint; even the aſpect of the countenance on the bed of ſickneſs ſerves to enable him to make a genuine preſage of the iſſue. This is called the <hi>ſemiotic</hi> or art of preſaging by exterior ſigns. The diſeaſe, conſtitution, ſtate, and nature's indications (ſalutary and erroneous)
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0648600600:24"/>being known, ſhe inſtantly preſents to his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened mind what is calculated for oppoſing the morbid ſymptoms, and bringing relief out of the abundant ſtock from his extenſive reſearches, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the protection of an all-attentive providence, without being toſſed on the fluctuating wave of conjectural opinion or uncertainty: thus experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence founded on analogy and comparative fact, imparts her obſervations to reaſon, and enables it to ſupport, by fair evidence, ſolid concluſions againſt the common enemy <hi>ignorance,</hi> which ſaps the foundation, and undermines all genuine learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Example hath the force of command.</p>
            <p>Scientific principles certainly reſt on <hi>praecognita,</hi> fixed, leading, or ſtanding ſelf-evident axioms, which are the objects of our ſenſes—come within the ſphere or cognizance of our intellectual facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and are conſiſtent with reaſon and truth: on theſe ſcience is enlarged and improved. Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal ſcience being the moſt extenſive of any, it taking in the whole compaſs and domain of nature, many things are yet beyond the amplitude of our intellectual view; and therefore its ſupporting pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars cannot all be reckoned, and our philoſophy has not taught us to reduce infinite variety to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite limitation without loſs. How narrow and unſtable all the ſyſtems of medical theory yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant! every one having been ſo ſullied by the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0648600600:25"/>improvements of the ſucceeding generation, that there is not one that has yet ſtood the teſt of half a century. HIPPOCRATES' <hi>(pater noſter artes me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicoe)</hi> excepted, which will ſtand as long as nature is true to herſelf: upon it we may make new ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts every day, it having endleſs ſtore to improve on, but upon none elſe that I know. How ſhort and fluctuating the College Catalogue of remedies to natures plan of the <hi>materia medica,</hi> as if all the reſt beyond it were an uſeleſs maſs of rubbiſh, only fit for being caſt away, while <hi>Deus et natura nihil fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eiunt fruſtra.</hi> CICERO, in his Academicks, ſpeaks almoſt in theſe words: "I do not direct my thoughts to the little bear but the great bear, called <hi>Helice</hi> or <hi>Charles' wain,</hi> thoſe famous <hi>ſeven north ſtars;</hi> that is, my ideas are to be enlarged, not narrowed, and therefore I muſt wander and expatiate a great deal farther. Abſolute reſtriction is giving at once an effectual check to the ſpirit of inquiry, and locking up the human underſtanding in the dark vale of ignorance. The moſt enlightened genius, with every advantage, knows but in part; and all that phyſicians do, or can know of nature, may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved into principles of obſervation and phyſical fact. Their reſearches and diſquiſitions into oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult and inſcrutable paths; ſuch as primordial ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient cauſes and inbred virtues, or to unravel that combination of cauſes which we call chance, more eſpecially ſuper-natural cauſes and their influences,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0648600600:26"/>would be fruitleſs, vain, arrogant, and bewildering, if not irreverent, that being nature itſelf; and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the art of the GODHEAD.</p>
            <q>
               <l>The dark profundity of heav'ns high plan,</l>

            </q>
            <p>It is well if we can obtain a ſide glance, or a paſſing ſmile.</p>
            <p>Though much remains to be diſcovered before we arrive at the <hi>ne plus ultra,</hi> yet enough is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered of things and their virtues, to enable the human mind to form juſt ideas of the infinite wiſdom, power, juſtice, and goodneſs of the great GOD of univerſal nature, whoſe benificence pours forth and diſcloſes his bleſſings to every living thing, conducted by fixed and immutable laws, and the rule and order of his diſpenſation is the felicity of the <hi>univerſe.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>After what is ſaid in this preliminary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, it will appear evident to the rational
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0648600600:27"/>READER, that inaſmuch as it is for phyſicians, and their brethren of the faculty, at the ſea-watering places to explore and induſtriouſly acquire a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent knowledge of the nature, power, influence, and effect of ſea-bathing, and its eſſential ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting auxilliaries for the relief of pain, agony, and diſtreſs; it is for <hi>viſitors</hi> themſelves not to be too indolent or refractory, to taking, and being guided by reaſon and judicious counſel on the ſpot, not only previous to, but from time to time, during a courſe of bathing, to prevent embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment, and to allow the bath to have fair play for anſwering the end and intention of it; for no writer can lay down rules to anſwer all and every one's caſe invariably; therefore to act laudably and gain ſucceſs is the triumph of wiſdom; it is the way to be acquainted with nature:
