         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>THE vaſt Number of Books which the Pen and Preſs have
produced, has made all Lovers of Literature deſirous of knowing, by ſome
compendious Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods, what has been written in the ſeveral Sciences to which
they have appropriated their Studies: And this Deſire grows more importunate,
as the Difficulty encreaſes of ſatisfying it; the Works of the Learned
multiplying ſo much beyond the Accounts which are given of them, and our
Attention being engroſſed to the Regard only of <hi>ſome</hi> few
Writers, by thoſe very means, which might be uſed to give us a tolerable
notice of <hi>all,</hi> who any ways deſerve it.</p>
            <p>For ſeveral Attempts have indeed been made, in many Countries,
to gratify in ſome meaſure, this univerſal Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity; but in
<hi>England,</hi> eſpecially, by ſuch narrow and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribed Schemes,
as have left many Impediments to the Advancement of human Knowledge unremov'd.
For thro' the Defect of ſuch Intelligence, in its proper Extent; how many
AUTHORS have we, who are conſuming their Time, their Quiet and their Wits, in
ſearching after that which is either paſt finding, or already found? In
admiring at the Penetrations themſelves have made, tho' to the Rind only, in
thoſe very Branches of Science which their Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers have pierced to the
Pith? And how many, who <hi>would be</hi> Authors, as excellent as ever
appear'd, had they but ſuch Plans or Models laid before them, as might induce
them to marſhal their Thoughts into a regular Order; or did they but know
where to meet with Concurrence of Opinion, with Arguments, Authorities or
Examples, to corroborate and ripen their teeming Conceptions?</p>
            <p>Again, had ſuch Intelligence been diſperſed in its due Scope
and Latitude, how many BOOKSELLERS, who would neither <hi>be impos'd</hi> upon
themſelves, with mere Tranſcripts <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0570200100:13"/> of obſolete and
obſcure Works, for modern Compoſitions, nor <hi>impoſe upon others,</hi>
ſo much to the Diſcredit of their Trade, and, in the main, to their own
Diſadvantage, either ſuch injudicious Valuations of ſome old Books, or
ſo many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature Publications of new ones; when the ſame Subjects are
already more ſignificantly handled at their very Elbows, but mourning in a
kind of Sackloth and Aſhes, for that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vival, they might at a much eaſier
Expence, be preferr'd to; knew the Poſſeſſors but where, even in their
own Shops to find them? Nor yet would they <hi>impoſe upon themſelves</hi>
the Loſſes they often ſo voluntarily do, of turning thoſe very Pieces
to Waſte-paper, which to ſome Reader or other would be moſt acceptable,
knew the one how to <hi>communicate,</hi> and the other, how to
<hi>compaſs</hi> the <hi>Contents</hi> thereof.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, how many READERS, who would not be glad of attaining to
Knowledge the ſhorteſt way, ſeeing the Orb thereof is ſwoln to ſuch a
Magnitude, and Life but ſuch a Span to graſp it? How many, who have not
ſome Curioſity to know the Foundations of thoſe Tenets upon which they
ſo ſecurely truſt their Underſtandings? Or where the Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of
thoſe Precepts and Precedents may be found, which have given Direction to
ſo many modern Performances? Who would not embrace the moſt likely means to
detect the vile Grievance of Plagiariſm, and deter ſo many
diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Repetitions of the ſame thing? What Reader would not think
it convenient to be apprized of the Worth of Authors, before he gave them place
in his Study or Eſteem, by ſome previous Characters or little Analyſis of
what is comprized in them? And who would not find it commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious to have the
opportunity of reviſing the Library of which he is, he has been, or may be
poſſeſs'd, in faithful Portraits thereof, at ſuch Times and Places in
which he cannot come at the Originals? In a word, if he be ignorant, who would
not covet to enlarge his Knowledge? If he be knowing, who would not willingly
refreſh his Memory? And yet all the Expedients we have to accommodate the
Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious with ſo many <hi>Deſiderata,</hi> are only ſome ſuperficial
<hi>Catalogues,</hi> either of Authors, rather than their Works, or of the
Works of Authors only, in ſome one peculiar place of Education, or in ſome
ſingle Science; or elſe, thoſe which have been moſt curſorily taken
of ſome particular Libraries; and alſo a few <hi>Extracts,</hi> limited to
the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation only of ſome modern Writers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0570200100:14"/>As for our CATALOGUES of Books, they are
generally, and indeed neceſſarily, thro' the great Charge and Hurry which
attend the making and printing them at proper Junc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſo ſhort and
defective, that we cannot often under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, by the two or three Words they
beſtow upon a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume, the very Title, nor ſometimes the Size, nor
frequently the Time when it was printed, much leſs the Matter treated of
therein: So that many Gentlemen, who live remote from the Places where our
Sales and Auctions are made, are, by the blind and doubtful Informations which
theſe Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues afford them, both led to over-look ſome Books which they
have moſt occaſion for, and to give Commiſſions for the Purchaſe of
others, by which they are utterly diſappointed, as anſwering in no wiſe
their Expectation. Nay, many who have Opportunities even of being preſent
where ſuch Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are diſpoſed of, do ſtill, after Examination,
commonly meet with no leſs Diſappointment. For the bare and naked
<hi>Titles</hi> of Books, eſpecially ſo contracted, are inſufficient to
explain them at beſt, or when their Contents are ingenuouſly deſign'd to
be ſignified by the Titles; but, on the contrary, the Titles of many are
often mere Paradoxes, Enigmas, and even Contrarieties to the Subjects or
Arguments maintained in them; and are ſo diſguiſed, many times, thro'
Artifice, by the Authors, Editors, and Bookſellers themſelves, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the Purchaſer, and catch him by the Purſe. This Deceit will laſt as long
as Books, if the other Expedient of <hi>Extracts</hi> is not more effectually
put in execution, than it has hitherto been done.</p>
            <p>For EXTRACTS indeed would have prevented all theſe
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies, had they been employ'd in a Scheme, only as comprehenſive,
as it is obvious to be ſuggeſted. But tho' it is above fifty Years ſince
ſuch Extracts of Books were firſt publiſh'd in <hi>England,</hi> yet do
all, or the greateſt part which have been here made, reſpect only the Works
of a few con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary Writers; as if it were a ſhame not to be ungrateful,
and trample thoſe Predeceſſors into Oblivion, by the help of whoſe
Learning and Abilities, the Moderns have improved their own. But this is a very
partial and pernicious kind of Flattery, ſo to celebrate and compliment the
Learning and Genius of the preſent Times, that Poſterity may not believe
any before them worthy of their notice: For thoſe who ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not their
Knowledge beyond their own Age, muſt not only loſe the nobleſt
Inheritance of their Anceſtors, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct their Succeſſors to
imitate their Example, and deal <pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0570200100:15"/> the ſame meaſure to
the <hi>preſent,</hi> which theſe have dealt to the <hi>paſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For theſe Reaſons, and many others, in which an intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent
Reader might foreſtall us, we think it high time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin with an
Undertaking which may include both thoſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients to their full Advantage,
in a <hi>Catalogue</hi> more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete, as to the <hi>Titles</hi> of Books,
which alone would be no inconſiderable Improvement upon what has been done,
and an <hi>Extract</hi> more unlimited, as to the Times in which they were
written, than have hitherto appear'd among us; ſo as to facilitate the moſt
uſeful Reſearches of the Living, by a general Regiſter of, or Directory
to the moſt notable Particulars in the Labours of the Dead.</p>
            <p>And the more directly to proſecute this Attempt, it is
comprehended under the Title of the BRITISH LIBRARIAN: For not only becauſe
Matters of our own Obſervation are generally moſt applicable to us, or
becauſe the running into Books of all Countries, would make it a Work of
which we could never hope to ſee any End, or tolerable Progreſs; but
chiefly becauſe our Pains and Reſpect are principally due to our own
Country; becauſe alſo ſuch Service thereunto has been moſt neglected;
and becauſe the Language thereof is moſt extenſively uſeful to our own
People, we ſhall confine our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to our own Authors; and ſome indeed
of thoſe Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners likewiſe, who are either become as it were
natura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz'd among us, by Tranſlations, or have deſerved to be ſo, by
treating of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Affairs.</p>
            <p>By calling this Work of our LIBRARIAN a <hi>compendious
Review</hi> or <hi>Abſtract,</hi> we propoſe not always a minute and entire
Epitome of every Book, which would make a Scheme of this Compaſs ſo tedious
and voluminous, that we know not whether our Readers or ourſelves would be
firſt wearied in going thro' it. Beſides, excellent Authors, ſo ſerv'd,
would never ſatisfy curious Readers; and thoſe Authors who cannot claim
that Character, would either not deſerve ſuch diſtinction, or not be
ſuffer'd, by the Attention which others, equally deſerving, would alſo
demand, to exact ſuch par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Cognizance, in a Work of ſuch a general
Nature. Our Buſineſs therefore cannot be ſo much to delight Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers with
the Flowers of Books, or ſatisfy them with a ſmooth Contexture of all the
Reaſons and Arguments in them, as to point out thoſe Heads or Topicks,
which, like ſo many Streams and Rivulets that ſeverally ariſe in the
Provinces of Literature, may beſt direct them to the Fountains them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves,
<pb n="v" facs="tcp:0570200100:16"/> where every Reader will extract thoſe Parts, and thoſe
Proportions, which no Epitomiſt can do for him. So that by this Compendium of
Hints and Advertiſements concerning the moſt obſervable Perſons and
Places, Times and Things, which have been ſpoken of in the Writings of Men,
is intended a <hi>Promptuary</hi> only, to the Search of thoſe Writings, as
the moſt ready means to expedite the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of what every one is
ſeeking. For as the excellent Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> complains, 
<q rend="inline">"<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>
                        <hi>De Augment.
Scientiarum, Lib.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 5.</bibl>
                  </note>learned Men want ſuch
<hi>Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories</hi> of every thing in Art and Nature, as rich Men have of
their Eſtates."</q> Here then, we hope to ſupply that Want, by giving not
only ſuch Inventories of all thoſe things, but, at the ſame time, a
Reference to the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their Authors which have been further made
on them; and not only that, but oftentimes what has been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved even of
the Authors alſo. And this more expreſly, after preſenting firſt of all
their Titles, commonly at length, in a manner as agreeably diverſified as the
Authors will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniently permit; ſometimes with Reaſons for the Choice of
them; a tranſient View of the Drift or Deſign, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of thoſe we
revive; ſome Notice of their Vouchers and Authorities; ſome Sketches of
their chief Arguments or Examples; ſome Indication of their Method, and
Inſtances of their Stile, occaſionally, as they yield Matter moſt likely
to be ſerviceable; with Characters alſo ſometimes ſubjoin'd, which
others have given of them. And in this treatment of good old Authors, we hope
for the ſame effect, as in the pruning of good old Trees, in which the
Gardener does not pride himſelf with the Twigs which he cuts off, or throws
together, but expects that the Operation will be a means of making the Stocks
themſelves, from whence they grew, ſhoot forth with freſh Vigour, and
reward, with better Fruits, the Hands that ſhall gather them.</p>
            <p>By our moſt <hi>Scarce, Uſeful, and Valuable</hi> Books in all
Sciences, we intend the moſt conſiderable of all Times, from the moſt
Ancient we can procure, to the moſt Modern, in all Sizes, even Pamphlets as
well as bound Volumes. And here our Scheme is ſo copious as to admit not only
of many which have been long buried in Darkneſs by their great Age, but
ſome, in a manner ſo young, as never yet to have ſeen the Light of
Publication, being only in the Preſs, or but going to it; and that, in a
Method, as may be hence gather'd, more ſatisfactory than they are uſually
notified to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. <pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0570200100:17"/> And becauſe we have received
hopes from ſome emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and judicious Perſons, who approve of this
Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that we ſhall be favour'd from time to time with ſeveral
uſeful <hi>Manuſcripts</hi> which have long lain diſregarded, we
propoſe to enrich our Collections with a ſhort Account alſo of one or
more in every Number.</p>
            <p>For as to the <hi>Method of Publication,</hi> we find it moſt
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modious, that we may better admit the Communications of ſuch as pleaſe
to oblige us with their Correſpondence, that it ſhould be <hi>Monthly,</hi>
and in ſuch a <hi>miſcellaneous</hi> manner as may yield the greateſt
Variety; ſo that every Number may be a little <hi>Pocket-Library,</hi>
deſcribing Folio's, Quarto's, Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tavo's, Pamphlets and Manuſcripts: By
which different Sizes, Readers, of different Circumſtances, may be the
eaſier ſuited in the Purchaſes they are inclin'd to. Then alſo, as
much, generally, as Opportunity will allow, of the various Sciences in every
Number, for the like Reaſon, that Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of different Studies may the
ſooner be inform'd of what they are enquiring after. For a Publication
<hi>Topically</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, or <hi>Chronologically,</hi> would be
impracticable, unleſs a Man had all the Books in the Kingdom together at
once, to methodize, before he ſet out: And then it would be very
inconvenient, by attracting only one Set of Readers to that one Branch, and
making all the reſt wait till the Courſe of their reſpective Studies
aroſe; by which they would yet loſe many pertinent Digreſſions upon
their own Subjects, which would occur in the different Sciences; for they
inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, and ſome Subjects are often to be found in Books of all
Sciences, while other Books would be denied admiſſion under any one of
them, becauſe they do not diſtinctly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs any, or directly treat of
all. Moreover, the Sale of ſome Sciences would, in that caſe, be ſo
unproportionable to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that it would be a great Diſcouragement to the
Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, and render the Edition of the whole, in many parts, incomplete.
Beſides, this abſtracted Revival of Books, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent of each other, as
to the Subjects, was never ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to any other Schemes of Abridgment, which
have been, or are carried on, in <hi>Latin, French,</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi>;
the Readers well knowing, how eaſily they may be directed to what they want,
by <hi>Tables</hi> and <hi>Indexes</hi> annexed to every Volume.</p>
            <p>Thus we are not under any Anxiety about what Authors we ſhall
commence with, or with whom we ſhall conclude, ſince that which is look'd
for in this Number, may ariſe in <pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0570200100:18"/> the next: Nor are we
under any Apprehenſion of being miſconſtrued to pledge our own Judgment
for the Merits of all the <hi>Authors</hi> we ſhall revive, ſince whatever
they are <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially,</hi> 'tis the Application of them, the Uſe to
which they are converted, that makes them <hi>effectually</hi> good or bad;
wherefore, it is in the <hi>Readers</hi> Power to make few <hi>Authors</hi>
unworthy of ſuch Revival. However, we ſhall uſe our beſt Endeavours to
pleaſe them, and always be ſubmiſſive to better Judgments: So that if
any Improvement of our Undertaking ſhall come to hand, we ſhall gratefully
acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and cheerfully purſue it; if not, and the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the
Publick ſhall be proportionable to the Induſtry we beſtow upon this
Scheme, we hope that any Imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in our execution thereof, will bear no
proportion to the Benefits which may univerſally flow from it.</p>

ſhall not here trouble our Reader with diſtinguiſhing two other Perſons

<hi>Badonicus,</hi> becauſe ſaid to be born at <hi>Bath,</hi> for his
ſingular Prudence and the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of his Morals, was ſurnamed the WISE;
that he was Monk of <hi>Bangor</hi>; flouriſh'd in the middle of the ſixth

<hi>Gildas,</hi> upon ſuch ſlender Grounds as he there mentions. As to his
Character, <hi>Milton</hi> tells us, That <hi>Gildas</hi> is every way
preferable, in ſpeaking of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Wars, to the <hi>Saxon</hi>
Writers, and a good Reaſon he gives for it: becauſe <hi>Gildas</hi> was
nothing conceited of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Valour, whereas the <hi>Saxons</hi>
ever magnified their own Deeds. Vide <hi>Mils. Hiſt. of Brit.</hi> Lib.

                  <hi>Epiſtle to
the Britains,</hi> and his Method of handling it, may be beſt gathered from
the Arguments he briefly touches upon, under diſtinct Heads in the following
Order.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Of the Iſland, its Situation and Extent; the number of
its Cities, the Magnificence of its Buildings, and Fertility of its Soil. 2.
The Diſobedience of the People, both in Religion and Government; their
monſtrous Idols before the Introduction of Chriſtianity, and their
Character by <hi>Porphiry,</hi> for their deteſtable Tyrants. Then he
propoſes to recount their Sufferings under the <hi>Roman</hi> Emperors, not
from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Authors, they being deſtroyed by their Foes, or
tranſported by their Exiles; but from foreign Accounts. So paſſes to, 3.
The Subjection of the Iſland, and how tamely ſhe received the foreign Yoke.
4. Of her Rebellion under Queen <hi>Boadicia</hi>; her neglect to ſecure her
Conqueſts by Sea and Land; and final Overthrow; which intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, 5. Her
ſecond Subjection and dreadful Slavery, till, 6. Her ſecond Relief by
<hi>Chriſtianity</hi>; which produced 7. Her Perſecution under
<hi>Diocleſian</hi>; and, 8. Many holy Martyrs; as, <hi>Alban</hi> of
<hi>Verolam,</hi> with <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>Julius</hi> of <hi>Carlile,</hi>
beſides many others not here named: alſo of their triumphant State till, 9.
The <hi>Arian</hi> Hereſy; and 10. The Uſurpation and Tyranny of
<hi>Maximus,</hi> followed by, 11. The Invaſion of the <hi>Scots</hi> and
<hi>Picts.</hi> 12. Their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion by the <hi>Romans</hi>; 13. The
Re-invaſion by thoſe Neighbours; 14. And ſecond Deliverance by the
<hi>Romans,</hi> who having taught the <hi>Britains</hi> to arm themſelves,
and fortify their Country, take their laſt Farewell. 15. Of the third 
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0570200100:26"/> waſtful Spoil by the aforeſaid Enemy. 16. And by a
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Famine. 17. Of their pitiful but fruitleſs Addreſs to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Conſul <hi>Agitius.</hi> 18. Of the brave Reſiſtance to
which ſome of them were driven by Neceſſity; and the Victory they
obtained againſt their Enemies, by whom they were forſaken, tho' not by
their Iniquities. Therefore, 19. Of their Vices, and the Licentiouſneſs
which followed their Peace and Plenty: Their Choice of wicked Princes, and the
Corruption of their Paſtors. 20. The ſudden A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larm of their inveterate
Enemies. 21. And new Calamities by Peſtilence. 22. Of their Councils to
redreſs themſelves. 23. And Invitation of their far moſt cruel Enemy the
<hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> to aid them againſt the Northern Powers. 24. Who totally
waſte and ſpoil the Country. 25. The miſerable State of the fugitive
<hi>Britains</hi>; their gathering head under <hi>Aurelius Ambroſius</hi>;
Battle with and Victory over the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> 26. Of the laſt Victory
obtained by the <hi>Britains</hi> againſt them at the Siege of the Mountain
of <hi>Bath</hi> (or <hi>Badon-Hill</hi>) forty four Years and one Month after
the landing of the <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> and alſo <hi>the Time of my
Nativity,</hi> ſays <hi>Gildas.</hi> In this Article, the moſt obſervable
of all the reſt, as being now enter'd into the times of his own Knowledge,
our Author firſt bewails, and ſharply reproves the Depravity of the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Rulers in general; next, gives particular Characters of five
of them; beginning with the Tyrant <hi>Conſtantine</hi> then living, his
Perfidiouſneſs, the Murders he committed under the Habit of the Saintly
<hi>Amphabale,</hi> his Adulteries and other Impieties. Then proceeds to
<hi>Aurelius Conanus,</hi> whom he reproaches in like manner: With equal
Severity he ſcourges <hi>Vortiper,</hi> a wicked Son of a good King. Nor does
he leſs chaſtiſe <hi>Cuneglaſſe,</hi> that <hi>golden Butcher,</hi>
as his Name inports; and concludes with the like Execrations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt that
<hi>Dragon</hi> of the <hi>Iſland, Maglocune,</hi> who ſurpaſſed many
Tyrants, as in Power, ſo in Miſchief. Here he ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joins the Menaces
denounced againſt theſe and ſuch like wicked Princes, by the ſacred
Oracles of Holy Scripture. After which follows a Tranſition from the
<hi>Civil</hi> to the <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical</hi> Corruptions; and here he
inveighs againſt the Vices of the Clergy no leſs freely than he had done
againſt thoſe in the State; which, with ſeveral Examples from the New
Teſtament and ſome Fathers of the Church, concludes this his <hi>Epiſtle
to the Britains.</hi>

re-publiſhed now again in 1652, on account of the ſharp and Chriſtian
Reproofs therein of Kings and Prieſts. The Editor ſays, That in rendering

printed at the Beginning of our <hi>Reformation</hi>; and tho' the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
Name was not yet publiſh'd to it, it is well known to have been written by
that famous Clerk and Schoolman WILLIAM of OCCHAM, ſo called from being born
in a Village of that Name in <hi>Surrey,</hi> as <hi>Camden</hi> and others
have obſerv'd. It was written by our Author ſo early as the Year 1305, if
the MS. Note on the Copy before me is right. There was another E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of it
afterwards in 1540, wherein it is ſaid to be written by <hi>William</hi> of
<hi>Occham,</hi> the great Philoſopher, in <hi>Engliſh</hi> and
<hi>Latin.</hi> [<hi>Extat. Lat. in Goldaſt. Monarch. T. Ed.</hi>] The Author
was Scholar to <hi>John Duns Scotus,</hi> and afterwards, his Antagoniſt. In
their grand Scholaſtic Controverſy, <hi>Scotus</hi> was diſtinguiſhed
Father of the <hi>Reals,</hi> and <hi>Occham</hi> of the <hi>Nominals.
Occham,</hi> fluſhed with his Succeſs, undertook Pope <hi>John</hi> the
23d, and gave a mortal Wound to his <hi>Temporal Power over Princes.</hi> He
got a good Guardian, <hi>Lewis</hi> of <hi>Bavaria</hi> the Emperor, whoſe
Court was his Sanctuary, but he was excommunicated by the Pope; and the
Maſters of <hi>Paris</hi> condemned him for an Heretic, and burnt his Books;
which <hi>Fuller</hi> conceives to be the Cauſe why <hi>Luther</hi> was ſo
vers'd in his Works, which he had at his Fingers ends; being the ſole
Schoolman in his Library whom he eſteem'd. The Pope being afterwards, it
ſeems, reconciled to him, he was reſtored to his State with the Repute of
an <hi>Acute Schoolman. Fox,</hi> in his <hi>Book of Martyrs,</hi> Ed. 1576.

               </head>
               <p>THis notable little Tract was written to ſilence the Clergy, and
anſwer their unreaſonable Expectations, that the Pope might exerciſe a
Juriſdiction over the Temporalities of <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0570200100:29"/> Princes, and the
Church be exempted from contributing of its Riches in time of need, either for
the Relief of the Poor or the Security of the Nation where they abide; as may
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear by the following Abſtract thereof.</p>
               <p>CLERICUS begins with complaining how much the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical
Rights are invaded, and what wrongs the Clergy endure againſt all Law. MILES
asks him, what Law is? And he anſwers; the Ordinances of the Popes, and
Decrees of the Fathers. MILES allows that what they have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ordain'd
in Matters of Temporality, may be Law to the Clergy, but not to the Laity; none
having power to ordain Statutes of Things, over which they have no Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip;
therefore, that he, lately, laugh'd heartily, when he heard that Pope
<hi>Boniface</hi> VIII. had made a new Statute, that he himſelf ſhould be
above all ſecular Princes and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and that he needed but to put it
into Writing, and all things were his: If he would have my Caſtle, my Town,
my Field, my Money, or the like, he need but to will, to write, and decree it,
and he's entitled to thoſe Things. Then CLERICUS would derive this Authority
from <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf: To whom it is ſaid in the <hi>Pſalms, Ask
of me and I will give Nations to thine Heritage, and all the World about to thy
Poſſeſſion:</hi> And of whom it is written, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. <hi>That
he is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> Then he argues from the
<hi>Faith</hi> of <hi>Holy Church,</hi> that <hi>Peter</hi> was ordain'd
<hi>Chriſt</hi>'s full Vicar for himſelf and Succeſſors, ſo has the
ſame Power over Temporalities as <hi>Chriſt</hi> had. But here MILES
diſtinguiſhes two States of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; one of his Humility, the
other of his Power and Majeſty: The former, from the Time that he took
Fleſh and Blood to his Paſſion; the latter, after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection;
when he ſaid, <hi>All Power is given to me in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth:</hi> That
<hi>Peter</hi> was ordain'd <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Vicar for the State of his
Humility, and to follow him in thoſe Things which he did in that State, or to
exerciſe that Power which <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0570200100:30"/> he, as mortal Man, did; and not
that which after his Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification he receiv'd. Here it is proved from
Scripture that <hi>Chriſt</hi> neither had, nor pretended to a temporal
Kingdom; and that <hi>Peter</hi> had not by his Commiſſion the Keys of the
Kingdom of Earth given him, but of Heaven; that he was <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s
Vicar in the Godly Kingdom of Souls, and not in <hi>Temporal Lordſhip</hi> of
Caſtles and Lands: And this again is proved out of St. <hi>Paul.</hi> Then
CLERICUS flies to another Argument; for ſeeing it allow'd that Holy Church
may correct Sins, he infers, that he who has to do in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Sin,
muſt know and deem in Right and Wrong; and ſince there is Right and Wrong
in Temporal Matters, the Pope ought conſequently to rule and deem in Temporal
Cauſes. But MILES having ſhew'd the Abſurdity of this Sophiſm, and that
Right and Wrong in Temporal Matters, are to be judg'd by Temporal Laws, proves
this alſo out of Scripture; where even in caſe of the People's
Diſobedience to thoſe Laws, it appears the Clergy are only to admoniſh
and warn them that they be <hi>ſubject to Princes,</hi> and in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Place
that <hi>every Soul</hi> ſhall be <hi>ſubject</hi> to the <hi>higher
Powers;</hi> which excepts not the Clergy themſelves. 
<q rend="inline">"And if you will needs be knowing in ſuch
Cauſes, ſays he, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Wrong and Sin are link'd together; it belongs
to you to know and deem in Cauſes of Wedlock; I pray will you therefore ſay
it follows, that you ſhall know and deem of all that belongeth thereto, for
the <hi>knitting of the Deed?</hi>"</q> So adviſes him not to intermeddle in
the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Things which concern Temporality; 
<q rend="inline">"For ſo much as ye uſurp and take upon you
that which belongs to others, it is right mete that ye ſuffer as ye do."</q>
Then CLERICUS asks if he can deny that the Temporal Power ſhould be
ſerviceable to the Spiritual? MILES allows the Temporality ſhould be ſo
far ſerviceable to them, as to find thoſe who worſhip and ſerve God all
that is neceſſary for them; that in the old Law they were handſomely
provided for, but not thereby ordain'd any Temporal Kingdom or Lordſhip; for
what kind of Lordſhip was appointed the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, may appear from four or
five Places of Scripture here quoted: from whence it is demanded, 
<q rend="inline">"Lo to whom doth <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his
Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> liken you? To Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to hired Men, and Oxen; and not
to Kings. I pray you, be Workmen, and hired Men, Lords of Things? Then it
ſeemeth that <hi>Temporalities</hi> are granted you to help your Living, and
for Charge of Spiritual Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0570200100:31"/> and not for
<hi>Lordſhip:</hi> And of the <hi>Spiritual,</hi> it is written in the Law of
<hi>Moſes</hi>; there ye be likened to an Ox that threſhes; for which it is
enough to take his Meat, though he fill all the Barn with his Travail."</q> A
little far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther CLERICUS is for allowing Princes to enjoy their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poralities,

<q rend="inline">"And let them ſuffer us, ſays he, in Peace
with ours."</q> But MILES cannot allow this to be any ways rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. For,
ſays he, we are to ſee the Wills of our Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers fulfill'd, who gave
you theſe Temporalities ſo plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully, that you ſhould diſpoſe both
of them and yourſelves to charitable Purpoſes, to the Health of our Souls
and the Honour of God, to praying for the Dead and relieving the Wants of the
Living; 
<q rend="inline">"But ye do nothing ſo; ye ſpend away your
Temporality in ſinful Deeds and Vanity; ye recke not for Honeſty, no nor
for your own Law, nor for Dedes of Mercy and Charity, but in folly, and
<hi>bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance,</hi> and in liking of this World, ye diſpend all that was given
you for an holy Intent. Shall not his Wages be ſtopped who will not do Deeds
of <hi>Knighthood?</hi> He that holdeth of another, and doth not his due Office
and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, he ſhall loſe and forgo his <hi>Fee.</hi>"</q> Here he brings
in the Example of K. <hi>Joas,</hi> who would not let <hi>Joidas</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
any more of the Eccleſiaſtical Revenue, but apply it to the Reparation of
God's Houſe; and concludes this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument with obſerving, 
<q rend="inline">"That ye have received all ſuch Lordſhips and
Riches as the Wages of holy Chivalry, and to the Intent to have Cloth and Food;
with which two, the Apoſtle ſaith, he held him paid; and all the
o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-plus, beſides Cloth and Food, ye ought to ſpend in Deeds of Mercy and
Piety, as on poor People, that have need, and on ſuch as be ſick and
diſeaſed, and oppreſſed with Miſery: And if ye do not ſo, then
muſt <hi>we have to do therewith</hi>; for then it falleth to us to take heed
of your Temporality, that ye beguile not and deceive the Quick and the
Dead."</q> CLERICUS obſerves, that King <hi>Joas</hi> did not apply the Money
to his own Uſe, but to that of Holy Church. 
<q rend="inline">"But now-a-days ye take our Goods, which ye
ſpend not to the Uſe of Holy Church, but on your buſy and unruly
Soldiers, and on Ships and Engines of War."</q> MILES anſwers, 
<q rend="inline">"That neither does the King apply it to his own
Uſe, but for your Safeguard, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of Holy Church, and of your Goods
and Chattels. That if the King's Power ſhould fail, the Gentry, ſuch as are
needy and had prodigally conſumed their Subſtance, <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0570200100:32"/>
would turn to yours, and deſtroy all you have; therefore that the King's
Strength is to you as a ſtrong Wall, and his Peace is your Peace: That by
giving a little Portion to him, you buy your own Safeguard: But as ye have
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been unkind for the Goodneſs he hath done, ſo now ye complain
againſt what is your own Profit: That if Kings at their own Coſts and Peril
are to defend you, and you to reſt, in Idleneſs and Luxury, eating,
drinking, and ſolacing yourſelves, then you only are Kings, and they your
Slaves."</q> Then he proves from Scripture again, that the Church, or Riches of
it, ſhould not be ſpared when Chriſtian People are in Danger; 
<q rend="inline">"The Ghoſtly Temple, which is Mankind, being of
more worth than the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple that is made of Lime and Stone."</q> CLERICUS
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that if thoſe things which are once given to God may be taken away
again, then all Vows may be made void. But MILES diſtinguiſhes, that what
he has ſaid is not to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw ſuch Gifts, but to apply them to thoſe
Uſes for which they were firſt given. Then CLERICUS would allude from the
Words of our Saviour, how free the Clergy were from paying Tribute to Princes.
But MILES argues, that the Example he produces, and the anſwer therein given,
was for Chriſt, and not for you; however grants, that Clerks in their own
Perſons ſhould be free, but not ſuch as lead their Lives as lewd Men.
Yet, tho' ſome may be thus freed in their Perſon by the Privilege of
Princes, ſhall your Fields have now the ſame Freedom? And he who had before
a yearly Tribute from them, loſe it afterwards in you? The Commonwealth
muſt be defended at the Coſt of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monalty; and whatever Part thereof
enjoys this Defence, 'tis moſt agreeing with right, that he ſet his
Shoulder and help to bear the Burden: Then if Poſſeſſions are as
rightly ſubject to the common Charge as to the yearly Rent, he ſhall be
under Charge whoever owns them. If ye talk of Preſcription; we anſwer, in
as much longer as this Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or Exemption has been allow'd by the Benignity
of Princes, ſo much the ſooner ye ſhould be ready to pay your Part where
need requires it; but both holy Writ and civil Powers aboliſh this
Preſcription, as appears by Examples here cited. CLERICUS thinks it hard that
Kings ſhould reſume the Privileges granted by their Predeceſſors. But
MILES urges that any particular Privilege, however long or firmly granted,
muſt ſubmit to general Occaſions; and, if it be found hurtful to the
Commonwealth, may be repeal'd <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0570200100:33"/> in time of need, as
<hi>Solomon,</hi> in ſome Matters of Theft, changed ſomewhat even of God's
Law CLERICUS would inſinuate, that it was Emperors who eſtabliſh'd
theſe Things, and that they might guide the Reins of the Law, but not Kings.
MILES looks upon this as a kind of Blaſphemy, proceeding either from
Ignorance or Envy; ſo draws an Inſtance from <hi>France</hi> and the
Empire, ſhewing how di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and independently the one exerciſes its
Power from the other. That as the Emperor may make Laws over all his Empire,
and add or diminiſh as he thinks good; ſo may the King of <hi>France</hi>
either utterly repel the Emperor's Laws, or change, or clearly baniſh them,
and at his Pleaſure or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain new ones. This he concludes with ſeveral
Examples from Scripture, proving the Subjection of the Clergy to their Princes;
as how by anointing, they acknowledg'd them to be their Princes and Rulers, how
they guarded, attended on, and pray'd for them as ſuch, inſomuch that
CLERICUS cannot forbear breaking off the Conference, with obſerving that it
was drawing towards Night, but he'd anſwer it all in the Morning.</p>
               <p>AFTER this manner ends this ancient and remarkable Treatiſe,
thus publiſh'd in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> with expreſs Priviledge, by K.
<hi>Henry</hi>'s Printer, no doubt to forward and ſtrengthen the
<hi>Reformation</hi> then in its Infancy. But if the Reader would ſee this
Argument, on the King's <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Supremacy,</hi> as it more
particularly regards the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, deduced from a vaſt
Variety of our moſt authentic Inſtruments and Records, we muſt refer him

               <p>Then follows (p. 1204.) a ſupplemental Appendix to the Reign of
King <hi>Edward</hi> I. in which is recited ſuch Writs of Prohibition,
Epiſtles, Bulls, and other Records, as the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor diſcover'd too late to
be inſerted in their proper Places of this <hi>Hiſtorical Vindication</hi>;
which are here ranged in an Hiſtorical Order, and each referr'd to its proper
Place in the ſaid laſt Reign, according as their Dates, or other
Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances directed him, together with the Pages and Lines where they
moſt properly may be inſerted in the next E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. With this Supplement
the whole Work finiſhes at Page 1307. Then comes an Advertiſement to the
Readers, informing us of fourteen ſeveral Tables he had made to this third
Tome, in an Alphabetical and Chronological Method, after the Manner of the
preceeding Volume: And we are referr'd to ſuch Tables in this laſt Volume
alſo, at the End of its Table of Contents. But ſuch Tables or Indexes were
omitted, at leaſt in a very fair Set of theſe ſcarce and elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
Books, whence this ſhort View of them is extracted<note n="*" place="bottom">This laſt Volume of Mr. <hi>Prynne</hi>'s ſaid
<hi>Records</hi> was deſign'd, by him, to have borne the ſame Title with
the two former, as may appear in the Book itſelf; but the Author dying juſt
before it was publiſh'd, thoſe who were concern'd in the Edition call'd it
<hi>The Hiſtory of King John,</hi> &amp;c. in hopes that appearing (under
that more general Title,) in the Shape and Diſguiſe of an entire Work, it
would go off the more readily, as Biſhop <hi>Nicholſon</hi> has
ſuggeſted; but with what Propriety, or Regard to the Subject, is left for
others to conſider. 'Tis certain that neither of the three Volumes have been
ſo ſufficiently uſed by, or even known to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Writers of, or
upon our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory, as ſuch copious Materials, ſo
carefully collected, do deſerve. One Reaſon, no doubt, is, the Scarcity of
the two former Volumes; which are advanced to ſuch an extraordinary Price,
that it is well known, the <hi>Complete Set</hi> has been ſold for <hi>Thirty
Pounds.</hi> Another reaſon for their having lain ſo much in Obſcurity,
might be, ſome pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Puniſhment the Author once underwent, for writing
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0570200100:44"/> Book, but in the former Reign, and long before he
was <hi>Keeper</hi> of the <hi>Records</hi>; for which he yet had a handſome
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence aſſign'd him by the Parliament, however it might leave ſome
Diſtaſte to his Name upon the Minds of many; as we may elſewhere
obſerve. The laſt cauſe of their Neglect may be, that artful Diſregard
which has been inſinuated of theſe <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections,</hi> to abate the
Curioſity of the Laity, and diſſuade their looking into them. The Right
Reverend Author laſt quoted, ſpeaking of thoſe two Tomes which periſh'd
in the Fire of <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> adds, 
<q rend="inline">"And no Man has hitherto thought it worth his
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence and While to give us a new Edition from any of the few that eſcaped:
His Third has enough, in all Conſcience, to ſatisfy any reaſonable
Reader, and <hi>ſuperſede</hi> his <hi>Enquiry</hi> into the State of the
Caſe, in either former, or following Ages."

want the firſt Leaf, which might contain a more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Title, and

thoſe Copies is A 2, the Book not being numerically paged at top, nor has it
any Printer's Name, or Date when printed. The late Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi> in his

<hi>Norwich,</hi> the 18th of <hi>July,</hi> 1559.</p>
               <p>The whole Work is divided into five Books, in the firſt whereof,
after ſome general Heads, leading to that Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in Arithmetic and
Geometry, which is requiſite for this Art, he defines Coſmography and
Geometry: Then gives you three Figures or Pictures; the firſt repreſenting
<hi>Coſmography,</hi> by a Globe of the Heavens, containing the Earth; the
ſecond, <hi>Geography,</hi> repreſenting the Earth and Waters only; and the
laſt, <hi>Chorography,</hi> or the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome one Town or
City, which he illuſtrates by an <hi>accurate Map</hi> of the excellent City
of NORWYCHE, as the Forme of it is, ſays he, at this preſent 1558; with
many Alphabetical References to an Explanation, at the bottom, of the principal
Places ſet forth in the ſame, (which Map has been look'd upon as a very
great Curioſity:) Hence he proceeds to define what the <hi>World</hi> is, and
to ſhew that it is made of <hi>two Parts.</hi> The Number alſo of the
<hi>Heavens</hi>; with the Errors of ſome Ancients. That only eight Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens
were found out by the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> that <hi>Ptolemy</hi> found out the
ninth, and <hi>Alphonſus</hi> the tenth: So gives us a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the
<hi>Coeleſtial Sphere.</hi> Next he deſcribes what a <hi>Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre</hi> is,
what the <hi>Axis,</hi> and what a <hi>Diameter</hi>; what the <hi>Poles</hi>
are, what an <hi>oblique Sphere,</hi> how a Sphere differs from a
<hi>Circle.</hi> The <hi>Number</hi> of Circles in a Sphere, what the
<hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rizon</hi> is, the Diviſion of it, with Figures of the ſeveral
ſorts; what the <hi>Meridian</hi> is, the <hi>Zenith, Antipodes,</hi> the
<hi>Equinoctial</hi>; with the Uſe of the <hi>Horizon, Meridian,</hi> and
<hi>Equinoctial Circles:</hi> What the <hi>Zodiac</hi> is, and the
<hi>Ecliptic,</hi> what a <hi>Sign</hi> is, what a <hi>Degree,</hi> and what a
<hi>Minute</hi>; with the <hi>Septentrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> Signes, <hi>Meridional</hi>
Signes, and the Uſe of the <hi>Zodiac.</hi> A <hi>Table</hi> of many notable
fixed <hi>Stars,</hi> with their ſeveral Names, their true Longitude,
Latitude, and Declination, faithfully rectified unto the Year 1559, profitable
for finding out the Latitude of any Country or Place. Then we have the two
Declinations of every <hi>Planet</hi> diſtinguiſh'd, with the Diverſity
of the Sun's Declination from <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Time to ours, and the Manner
how to find out, by a Quadrant, the Sun's Declination. After which we have a
<hi>Table,</hi> in two <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0570200100:52"/> Parts, of <hi>Declination</hi> of
the <hi>Ecliptic,</hi> in <hi>Degrees, Minutes,</hi> and <hi>Seconds,</hi> from
the Equinoctial; anſwering to the <hi>Sun</hi>'s greateſt Declination, 23
Degrees, 28 Minutes; being the true Declination of the Sun in this (our
Author's) Age, which Table is more copiouſly uſeful than <hi>Orontius,</hi>
or Doctor <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord</hi>'s Table, and yet not ſo prolix as <hi>Eraſmus
Reignholt</hi>'s. Next we have the <hi>Poles</hi> of the <hi>Zodiac</hi>
explain'd, what the <hi>Summer Tropic,</hi> and what the <hi>Winter</hi> is.
Whence the four <hi>Seaſons</hi> of the Year are derived, what the two
<hi>Colures</hi> are, the <hi>Artick</hi> Circle, and the <hi>Antartick</hi>
defin'd, from <hi>Proclus,</hi> as moſt of the other Diſtinctions are. Thus
PHILONICUS having learn'd his Scholar what the <hi>ſix</hi> greater Circles
of the Sphere are, and what the <hi>four</hi> leſſer, gives him the
reaſon why they are ſo diſtinguiſh'd from <hi>John de
Sacro-Boſco.</hi> Then repreſenting theſe ſeveral Parts together in one
Figure or Picture, he concludes his Account of the <hi>Celeſtial</hi> Sphere,
and ſo proceeds to that which comprehends the <hi>Elementary</hi> Region,
obſerving why it can conſiſt but of four Elements; their Order and
Situation, the Diviſion of the Air, where Comets, Hail and Snow are
engendred, what the Earth is, Diverſity of Opinions touching its Form,
Objections againſt its Rotundity anſwer'd from <hi>Cleomedes,</hi> alſo
from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of two Eclipſes of the Moon, and Obſervation of ſome
Stars, with Reference for further Proof to <hi>Ptolemy, Philo, Ariſtotle,
Reignholt, Orontius, John de Sacro-Boſco,</hi> and Maſter <hi>Recorde</hi>;
who does almoſt repeat all their Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in his <hi>Caſtle of
Knowledge.</hi> Here, joining together all the Parts which have been
ſeverally before treated of, in one Type or Figure of a compleat Sphere,
repreſenting both the Heavens and the Earth, he concludes with making his
Scholar give him a Recapitulation of what he had learnt in this firſt Book;
ſo proceeds to</p>
               <p>The ſecond Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in which is plainly
expreſſed the Order and Number of Zones, Parallels and Climates; alſo
ſundry ways for the exact finding out of the Meridian Line, the Longitude and
Latitude of Places, with many other Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts belonging to the making of a
Carte or Mappe. After an ingenious Introduction of this Book, and Repetition of
what is taught in it, the Author, ſeeing the Matter thereof chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends
upon Dimenſion and Menſuration, firſt ſhews what <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſion</hi>
is; what a Point, what a Line, what a Platform, and what a Body is. Then gives
us a Table of <hi>Meaſure</hi>; the quantity of <hi>Helvetian</hi> and of
<hi>Engliſh Miles</hi>; the different Signification of <hi>Longitude,</hi>
both in Aſtronomy and Coſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy; <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0570200100:53"/> what
<hi>Latitude</hi> is; how to find out the <hi>Circuit</hi> of the Earth and the
Vertical Point, with the Diverſity of O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions about the Circuit of the
Earth: Then, of what Parts are habitable, and what not. Of the Zones, and the
Error of <hi>Polybius</hi>; the Objection of ſome being uninhabitable
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered; of the Inhabitants, who are diſtinguiſhed by the Diverſity
of their Shadows, as, the <hi>Amphiſcii,</hi> or double-ſhadowed; the
<hi>Aſcii,</hi> or People without Shadows; the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teroſcii,</hi> or
thoſe who have their Shadows on one Side, as we who have our Shadow directly
North, and the <hi>Antipodes,</hi> who have theirs to the South; laſtly, the
<hi>Periſcii,</hi> who have their Shadow going about the Horizon. Here
follows a <hi>Table of Shadows,</hi> ſhewing their Proportion to the
<hi>Gnomon</hi> (it being divided into 60 parts) for every Degree of the Sun's
Altitude; and alſo the quantity of the Shadow in every Country, Region and
City, thro' the univerſal Earth, when the Sun is in the Equinoxial and
Solſticial Points. Then returning to the <hi>Zones,</hi> he ſhews how they
differ from <hi>Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,</hi> with <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s Diviſion of Climates;
next, what <hi>Parallels</hi> are, exemplified in a Figure. The number of
Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, alſo in a Figure; and Quantity both of them and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallels; with a
<hi>Table containing the number of Parallels and Climates,</hi> with the
Elevation of the <hi>Pole-Artic,</hi> and <hi>Quantity</hi> of the longeſt
Day and Night anſwering hereto. Of South Parallels, and the Reaſon why
<hi>Avicenne</hi> thought the Air moſt temperate under the Equinoxial; which
introduces a Conjecture where <hi>Paradiſe</hi> was ſeated, and
<hi>Lyra</hi>'s Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation that the <hi>Fiery Sword</hi> was the
<hi>burning Zone,</hi> with a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture where <hi>Hell</hi> is ſeated.
After which, we have <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi>'s Manner of finding out the Noon-Stead
or Meridian Line, and four other Methods alſo of finding the ſame. The
Order of finding the Height of any Planet or fix'd Star in the Noonſtead Line
by Night. Then follows <hi>a Table of the Sun's Meridian Altitude above the
Horizon,</hi> calculated for every Degree in the Zodiac, reſpecting the
Elevation of the Pole-Artic, at <hi>Norwich</hi> 52 Degrees 10 Min. and the
Sun's Declination 23 Deg. 28 Min. The manner to find out the Elevation of the
Pole above the Horizon, and the <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude</hi> of any Region, City or Town,
ſeveral ways; eſpecially by the <hi>Aſtronomy-Ring.</hi> Of finding the
<hi>Longitude</hi> of any Place, according to the Ancients, by
<hi>Eclipſes</hi> of the Moon. That <hi>Atreus</hi> found out the time of
<hi>Eclipſes.</hi> The Cauſe of the Moon's Eclipſe. A Calculation of
ſuch Eclipſes of the Moon as ſhall happen from the Year 1560 till 1605;

Hours and Minutes, unto the Meridian of <hi>Norwich</hi> exactly, which is 22
Degrees and 30 Minutes, from the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands: with the Figures of
all the ſaid Eclipſes. How to find the Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Regions by an
Eclipſe. How to turn the Hours of the Day into Degrees and Minutes of the
Equinoxial, with a Table for that purpoſe. <hi>Apian</hi>'s Way of finding
out the <hi>Longitude</hi> of Places by the <hi>Jacob</hi>'s Staff,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Method to be taken when the Moon is Weſt, or Eaſt of
the Star; further illuſtrated by an Example of finding the Longitude of
<hi>Norwich.</hi> Another Method of finding the Longitude of any Region in
every Place as well by Day as Night, and at every Hour, by means of a little
<hi>Clock,</hi> ſuch as they uſed to wear in the faſhion of a Tablet;
whereof were then made as excellent without <hi>Temple-Bar</hi> as any which
were brought from <hi>Flanders</hi>: with the Particulars of this Experiment
ends this ſecond Book.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>third Book</hi> is expreſs'd the making and
Portraiture of the Face of the Earth, both in <hi>Cartes</hi> particular, and
alſo u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſal: with divers Things incident thereto. Here having ſhewn
what a chief Requiſite the Art of Drawing or Delineat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is in the Study of
Coſmography, and what noble Rewards the Ancients had in ſtore for the
Inventors of Science; when they not only gave them abundance of Treaſure, but
alſo deified them for the ſame: The Author deſcends to explain what an
<hi>Iſland</hi> is; what a <hi>Peninſula</hi>; an <hi>Iſthmus</hi>; a
<hi>Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>; then exhibits them all in a Map together; with an Anſwer
to an Objection againſt the Form of the Terreſtrial Globe; ſo begins with
teaching the Manner of making a particular Carte for any Region, and here draws
up a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the <hi>Quantity</hi> and <hi>Proportion</hi> of the
<hi>Equinoxial,</hi> or any great Circle, to every Parallel, North and South
therefrom. Hence we are led to a particular Example, containing the whole
Proceſs in making a <hi>Map of England,</hi> and ſhewing how the Work
chiefly depends on the Meridian Line, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing thereby the Longitudes; and
by Parallels of Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, whoſe uſe in a Carte is to limit the Latitude
from the Equinoxial: This is illuſtrated by a Draught or Figure. From hence
we are taught how to deſcribe three or four Regions in one Map, or as many as
are contained in one eighth Part of the Earth; and after the particular
Inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for this Operation, we have the Form alſo thereof de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineated
to the Eye. So we proceed to the Compoſition of a Map for one half of the
Earth, whereof alſo we have a <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0570200100:55"/> Draught. And this is
followed by the Method of making a Map for the whole Earth, which we are again
further ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with by lineal Repreſentations: And here we have a
<hi>Table</hi> of the <hi>Segments</hi> and Parts of the Equinoxial, drawn in a
plain Platform, anſwering to the Circumference of Parallels. A little further
is another <hi>Table of Regions</hi> and <hi>Cities</hi> ſubject to the
<hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Planets.</hi> Then we have the Figure of an
<hi>Inſtrument,</hi> ſerving to make a Map, without knowing Longitude or
Latitude, which is here called a <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphical Plain Sphere,</hi> by which
not only the Diſtance of one Place from another may be found in the Map, but
of the Places themſelves, in Miles alſo from one another; as by a
Demonſtration here figured out appears: And with this Experiment ends the
third Book.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fourth Book</hi> lays down ſuch neceſſary Principles
and Rules as are to be obſerved in <hi>Hydrography,</hi> and
<hi>Navigation.</hi> Herein it is propoſed not to ſhew the minute
Difference of one Veſſel from another, nor their Names, nor their Burden,
but how to correct the Errors in guiding and directing them. And firſt, we
have a Diviſion of the Waters, from the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Name of the Ocean, down to
Lakes and Ponds. The Cauſe of Spring and Ebb <hi>Tides.</hi> Cauſe of
<hi>Ebbing</hi> and <hi>Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> How to find the <hi>Age</hi> of the
<hi>Moon</hi> at all times. The <hi>Epact,</hi> with a <hi>Table</hi> to find
it. A <hi>Table</hi> of the <hi>Sun's riſing</hi> and <hi>going down</hi>
throughout the Year; whereby to find how long the Moon ſhines every Night. A
<hi>Table</hi> ſhewing how long the <hi>Moon ſhines</hi> in our
<hi>Horizon. Another</hi> ſhewing in what Places, chiefly on the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Shore, the Moon makes full Seas. How to know the exact
<hi>Time</hi> of <hi>Ebbing</hi> and <hi>Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> with a <hi>Table</hi>
for finding out <hi>Ebbs</hi> and <hi>Floods</hi> in the Coaſts of
<hi>England, Scotland, Ireland, Dutchland,</hi> and <hi>France.</hi> A
Deſcription of the <hi>Wind.</hi> The Number, Diviſion, and Nature of the
Winds. The new Diviſion of the Horizon into 32 Parts, by the learned
Hydrographers, ſeemingly in our Author's Time; who here diſpoſes them
into a <hi>Type</hi> or <hi>Figure.</hi> Of the Mariners <hi>Compaſs,</hi>
unknown to the Ancients, found out by <hi>Gemma,</hi> and a Draught of it. The
Praiſe of the <hi>Needle</hi>; the Obſervations of <hi>Jofrancus</hi> in
what Places it has erred. How to correct the Needle in Day-time, by help of the
Sun; in the Night, by ſome fixed Star. Of the Errors in deſcribing the
Shipman's Chart, and the way how to ſail by Longitudes and Latitudes. How to
direct a Ship to any Port. How to know the Form of the Lode-Star; and to know
in what Place they are who are driven <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0570200100:56"/> from their Courſe.
With theſe Diſcoveries and Directions in Coſmography, Geography, and
Navigation, our Author ends this fourth Book.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fifth Book</hi> deſcribes the Parts of the Earth,
particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly according to late Obſervations; with the <hi>Longitudes</hi>
and <hi>Latitudes</hi> of Regions, Provinces, Iſlands, Cities, Towns,
Villages, and Hills: Alſo the Commodities, Natures, Laws, Rights, and
Cuſtoms of many Countries, and their Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. This begins with a
particular Deſcription of <hi>Europe,</hi> containing <hi>Chriſtendom</hi>
and part of <hi>Turky</hi>; beginning with <hi>Ireland,</hi> as
<hi>Ptolemy</hi> does: In which, after a ſhort Account of the Products and
Character of the People, and Dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the Iſland, he notes the chief
Places, with their Longitude and Latitude: So proceeds to <hi>England,</hi>
which is treated of in the ſame manner. Then <hi>Scotland, Iceland,
Corſica, Sicily, Sardinia, Majorca</hi> and <hi>Minorca, Gades, Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boea,
Crete,</hi> the <hi>Cyclades</hi> and <hi>Sporades.</hi> In ſuch like

ſpace of ſeven Years, all ſuch Books as he has printed, or ſhall print.
But we have not yet met with any more of this Author's Writing, printed by him,
how many ſoever he had ready for the Preſs; which perhaps may be accounted
for, from the Emblem in the laſt Page of this Book, which ſhews us the
Figure of Death on a Monument, and <hi>Virtue</hi> in the Shape of a Tree,
flouriſhing out of it.</p>

               <p>THIS Tract was the Product chiefly of that ten Years Obſervation
and Experience which our Author had in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> as he
informs us in his Dedication to the Gentry thereof, among whom he was firſt
introduced by his honoured Friend, Sir <hi>William Tate,</hi> as therein alſo
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears. Not but the ſaid Frauds and Corruptions in Phyſick were
epidemical enough to have mov'd him to the like Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madverſions, had he
reſided in any other part of the Nation. For as he ſays, in his

<q rend="inline">"So infinitely do the numbers of barbarous and

to keep the Current of the Text clear from all Quotation of ancient

has obſerved through every Page. His Method further, is to illuſtrate his
general Cautions and Rules with particular Caſes and Reports, drawn chiefly
from thoſe Parts where he now practiſed and reſided, as an Inducement to

                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0570200100:58"/>The Work itſelf is open'd with an
<hi>Introduction,</hi> ſhewing, how deſirable, but how difficult it is, to
meet with an able Phyſician, thro' the variety of Cauſes and
Circumſtances to be conſider'd in Diſeaſes, and the Application of
Remedies; with the ill Conſequences of the common Neglect and Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
herein, and the monopolizing of Cures to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative of this or that
Secret, to the Contempt of the due Permutation of Medicines and the Increaſe
of Diſeaſes, both beyond their own Nature, and the Conſtitutions of the
Sick. Here, among thoſe Things, the indiſcriminate uſe of which he
diſcommends, are mention'd Tobacco, and Quickſilver, and even Caſſia,
and Rhubarb, which being indiſcreetly, out of time and place diſpenced,
bring Miſchief inſtead of Good; with other Inſtances here produced, both
of internal and external Remedies, moſt ſovereign and renowned in
themſelves, which yet do bring forth effects unworthy of themſelves, and
all becauſe ſuch a promiſcuous and unskilful Rabble of the meaneſt
Mechanicks, Women, Prieſts, Witches, Conjurers, Jugglers, and
Fortune-Tellers, are ſuffer'd to become Medicine-Mongers, and make a gainful
Traffic of Homicide it ſelf. That not only the Simple but thoſe alſo of
better Sort are deluded to encourage ſuch Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, on account of ſome
caſual Succeſs; but, ſays our Author, 
<q rend="inline">"As in Military Deſigns, oft-times a bold and
fool-hardy Enterprize, above and beſide Reaſon, and beyond Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation,
produceth an excellent and admir'd Good in the happy Iſſue; yet it is not
commended, or in any caſe permitted, as being very dangerous in ordinary
Practice, or Cuſtom of Warfare: ſo likewiſe, divers Events of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines
prove good, whoſe bold Uſe and raſh Preſcription is dangerous and
unskilful"</q> He concludes this Chapter with obſerving, That as improper
Remedies are, for the moſt part, worſe than Diſeaſes, and unlearned
Phyſicians, of all bad Cauſes of Diſeaſes, are themſelves the
worſt; it is not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a needleſs Learning, more ſtudiouſly to
know the Good from Ill and Ill from Good; beginning with the laſt firſt,
in</p>
               <p>Chap. 2. <hi>Of the Emperick.</hi> Herein is deſcribed, what an
Emperick is; in what his Defects conſiſt. The Aſſiſtance of
Invention; of Experience, and what a circumſcribed Guide of it ſelf. 
<q rend="inline">"For as it is with the Soldier in the Field, let
his own ſpecial Experience in Arms be never ſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, ſo true, ſo
ſound, yet without a more general Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding or Theory, and a more
enlarged Knowledge than his particular and limited Experience can bring forth, 
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0570200100:59"/> he muſt be lamely fitted to many ſudden and oft before
unforeſeen Occurrents, which the perpetual Mutability and Change of
Circumſtances in Warfare muſt needs produce. The Field, the Enemy, the Time
(not always the ſame) require a divers and oft a contrary Conſultation,
Deſign, and Manner, wherein one particular Experience by it ſelf, cannot
but be much wanting, becauſe the ſame Thing or Action ſeldom or never
happens again the ſame in all Circumſtances; and one Circumſtance alone
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly altering the whole Condition. As it is in Military Affairs, ſo is
it in the Aſſaults of Diſeaſes, where the Fight and Wreſtling of
Nature is not always in the ſame Part, nor in the ſame Form or Manner, nor
with the ſame Diſeaſe, nor of the ſame Period: All which
Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in the ſame Subject cannot happen always to any Sight or
Senſe the ſame, which makes Experience; yet are ever preſent in the
general Notions of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, whereby the prudent and wiſe Man
doth make ſupply, tho' Experience fail."</q> Beſides, many Diſeaſes
a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in the Body of Man which are ſcarce ſeen in a Man's Life, and in
which, Experience can give no Preſcription. Here are mentioned, the
<hi>French</hi> Diſeaſe and the <hi>Scurvy,</hi> ſtrange to us once, and
the <hi>Engliſh Sweating-Sickneſs,</hi> ſo now. To theſe are added,
ſome more ſingular and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common Accidents, as <hi>Rulandus</hi> his Report
of the Golden Tooth which grew naturally in the Mouth of a Child. Alſo
another Child, in <hi>Hollerus,</hi> who thruſt its hand out of its Mother's
Navel for 15 Days, and was afterwards born alive, and the Mother ſafe.
Alſo, <hi>Braſavola</hi>'s Cure of the Soldier who had almoſt half his
Head cut away with part of his Brains. Hence he deſcends to ſeveral
Examples and Caſes of his own Obſervation in <hi>Northamptonſhire</hi>;
and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes, from them, that every Day almoſt, may poſe bare and naked
Experience, eſpecially when Empericks apply it to ſimilar Appearances: 
<q rend="inline">"For, with the Wiſe, the <hi>like,</hi> is much
unlike the <hi>ſame</hi>; and it is a chief Point in all Learning, truly to
diſcern between differing Similitudes and like Differences. Many Accidents
fall out ſeeming alike, yet have no Affinity; and again, in Shew the ſame,
yet indeed, contrary. Contraries have oft, in many things, Likeneſs; and
Likeneſs, Contraries, eaſily deceiving the Unwotting and Unlearned."</q>
This again is proved by many Inſtances, tending to demonſtrate the
Imperfections of their Practice, who uſe no light of Judgment or Reaſon, 
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0570200100:60"/> but the only Senſe of their own Experience. With regard
alſo to whom, our Author ſays a little further, 
<q rend="inline">"I wou'd it were a Slander, in theſe days, that
Good-Will and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Medicines, put to death more Lives than open Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der;"
and thinks "it would be happy, if at length, the common Inconvenience and
publick Scandal might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get a Law, and Law bring forth Reſtraint."</q> Here
alſo we have many Inſtances how helpleſs or hurtful good Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are,
when apply'd without Diſtinction of proper Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, Concomitancies,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> intended to caution us againſt putting any confidence in the
Excellency of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, without Advice for the right Diſpenſation of
them, and conſequently, againſt relying upon the many Books of
<hi>Phyſical Receipts</hi> and Apothecaries Shops in print, which were then
divulged in all Places; wiſe and diſcreet Men knowing, that Things without
Reaſon in themſelves, are by Reaſon and Wiſdom to be guided.</p>
               <p>Chap. 3. is <hi>Of the Practice of</hi> Women <hi>about the Sick;
common-viſiting Counſellors, and Commenders of Medicines.</hi> Wherein, as
vulgar Pretenders were before exclaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, for want of proper
Education and Knowledge, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients are, for the ſame Reaſon, warned
againſt conſulting with <hi>Petticoat Practitioners</hi>; who are rather
adviſed to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe Rules of <hi>Conduct</hi> to themſelves, than
<hi>Phyſick</hi> to their Friends; as what would free them from the
Unhappineſs of having their Hands ſo commonly in others Miſhaps, to the
Diſhonour of their own Sex; by intimidating the Sick with Doubts, and
diſſuading them, if not from Phyſick ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely, yet from the regular
Compoſition and Uſe of it; from all that is not of their own making, or of
which they have not had Tryal; as their own Ointments, Plaiſters,
Cear-Cloths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> often beguiling them with the dangerous Flattery
of harmleſs and palatable Medicines, proving, that old <hi>Eve</hi> will
never be worn out of <hi>Adam</hi>'s Children; and not ſeldom rendring it
incredible that ſuch mean ſort of People can get acquaintance with ſuch
dangerous Medicines as are here alſo ſpecified; but that Quackſalvers,
Bankrupt Apothecaries, and fugitive Surgeons, who every where over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread the
Kingdom, are compelled for gain, to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſuch Secrets, whereby
deſperate Ingredients and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments grow vulgar Medicaments.
Therefore,</p>
               <p>Chap. 4. Treats of <hi>Fugitives, Workers of Juggling Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders,
and Quackſalvers.</hi> Under this Head, we have a running Deſcription of
the Impoſtors here named. 
<q rend="inline">"Among theſe <pb n="38" facs="tcp:0570200100:61"/> Men, ſays
he, "credulous Minds may ſee Things inviſible, Beggars are enabled to

                     <note n="*" place="bottom">Our Author, Dr. <hi>Cotta,</hi> (who was

Workmanſhip of their Hands; in whoſe hands are nothing but Idleneſs,
Theft, and Beggary."</q> He concludes this Head with intimating, that
Pretenders to ſuch uncommon Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, are to be ſuſpected of wanting
even common Suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency. That God has not ordain'd Wonders and Miracles to
give ſupply to our common Needs, or to anſwer the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Occaſions of
Life; nor do Truth and Sufficiency re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their juſt Trial by rare Works,
or caſual Events, but by an habitual and continual Proof and Exerciſe in
their daily, ordinary, and proper Subjects and Occurrents.</p>
               <p>Chap. 5. is, <hi>Of Surgeons</hi>; and ſuch as eſteeming well
of themſelves for the Exerciſe of their Hands in Wounds, Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> arrogate a Privilege in the Practice of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick; and even
undertake to educate and inſtitute Phyſicians, as an Undergrowth to
themſelves; and that thus alſo the World is furniſhed with Factors for
the Grave. Hereof he produces Examples, manifeſting, by the Practice of
theſe Barber-Surgeons, how confident Ignorance will be, and how powerfully it
will infatuate the Diſtreſſed. And here again is arraign'd, the Cuſtom
of giving the ſame Medicine to different Conſtitutions. Whence, ſays our
Author, 
<q rend="inline">"How can he who conſiders the Diſeaſe and
not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in curing the one, but in danger the other?"</q> A little
farther he lays down the plain and uncontrolled Difference between the Learned
and the Unlearned in the Faculty; and ſhews how the Learned has a Prerogative
in three Parts to himſelf, and an equal Part with the Unlearned, in the
fourth; yet allows, that in many deſperate Caſes, the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant by their
Blindneſs, their Boldneſs, and their Luck, may be the only fit
Inſtruments. Here we have alſo Examples how wonderous Good oft iſſues
out of deviliſh and dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Acts; yet if the Unskilful fail, the hopeful
Uſe of any <pb n="39" facs="tcp:0570200100:62"/> other Means is commonly thereby over-run, and
the Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of After-health by better Council, fruſtrated. Hence we are
led to</p>
               <p>Chap. 6. Of <hi>Apothecaries:</hi> To whom thus much is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd;
That if any may have Prerogative to be Phyſicians by the Excellence and rare
Choice of Medicines, it is moſt proper unto them. Nay, 'tis further allow'd,
that for the excellent Preparation and Knowledge of Medicines, they ſometimes
may excel ſome Phyſicians themſelves. 
<q rend="inline">"But above and beyond the Preparation; the right
and judicious Diſpenſation is truly worthy, commanding and directing
therein ſafe and prudent Uſe. This Skill requires an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding able
to raiſe itſelf above both the Medicine and the Maker, unto the Great Maker
of them both, and from his general Decree and Council in the Adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration
of all things in Nature, to levy and limit Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, Proportion, Time,
Place, Quantity, and Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, according to the manifold Purpoſes and
infinite Uſes for the Preſervation, Conſervation, and Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of
Health and Life to Mankind."</q> So far as the Apothecaries keep within their
own proper Bounds, they cannot be denied a worthy Eſteem; but if the Pride
and Maſterſhip of the Medicine ſtir once in them the Ambition of
Medication, they will be juſtly condemned. A little further the Queſtion is
propoſed, whether a Phyſician ſhould be both Surgeon and Apothecary
himſelf. And it is allow'd that in Judgment, Skill, Knowledge, and Ability of
Direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it may be requiſite; but the particular Execution ſhould be
divided to others, whoſe continual Exerciſe therein makes them fitter for
it; and this Chapter is concluded with ſome further Remarks to the ſame
Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Chap. 7. <hi>Of Practiſers by Spells.</hi> Among the Arguments
here uſed againſt theſe Deluders, is this, 
<q rend="inline">"If the faithful and devout Prayer of Holy Men, to
which the Promiſe of God and Bleſſings of Men are annexed, has no ſuch
Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurance or Succeſs of neceſſary Conſequent, without la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
Induſtry and the uſe of good Means, how can Religion or Reaſon ſuffer
Men who are not void of both to give ſuch impious Credit unto an
inſignificant and ſenſeleſs Mumbling of idle Words, contrary to
Reaſon, without Precedent of any truly wiſe or learned, and juſtly
ſuſpected of all ſenſibe Men?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Chap. 8. <hi>Of Witchcraft in the Sick,</hi> &amp;c. Herein are
va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Arguments advanced, to prove there are many things <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0570200100:63"/> whereof few Men, many whereof no Man can attain the Reaſon, yet
every Man knoweth to have a Reaſon in Nature. That Caſualty oft apts
Conſequences to Dreams, yet it is no Proof of Truth to truſt in them. That
Women in their Sleep have foreſeen or foretold many Things which have come to
paſs, but this makes their Dreams no Oracles; and many vain Men have
confidently predicted ſuch Things as have happen'd, yet are not taken for
Prophets. In like man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſome who have poſſeſs'd themſelves with
Witchcraft and the Opinion thereof, have ſeemed to know Things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove their
Knowledge, and That Knowledge above and beyond all Reaſon hath been true. Yet
neither is this any Diſpoſſeſſion of themſelves of this Spirit of
Folly, nor juſt Proof or Accuſation of any one to be a Witch. Our Author
does not deny or defend deviliſh Practices of Men and Women, but deſires
only 
<q rend="inline">"to moderate the general Madneſs of this Age,
which aſcribes to Witchcraft what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever falls out unknown or ſtrange to
a vulgar Senſe."</q> Therefore, concerning Diſeaſes, there are here ſet
forth ſome ſtrange and particular Caſes, which had undergone unjuſt
Imputations of this kind; and one eſpecially, of a Gentlewoman, whom certain
Witches, lately executed for Sorcery, confeſs'd to have bewitch'd; tho' her
Malady was only a natural Complication of divers Diſorders, chiefly
convulſive, which produced a Concourſe of Accidents, ſeeming of
monſtrous and wondered Shapes. Upon this, ſays our Author, I grant the
voluntary and uncompelled, or duly and truly evicted Confeſſion of a
<hi>Witch,</hi> to be ſufficient Condemnation of herſelf, and therefore,
juſtly hath the Law laid their Blood upon their own Heads; but their
Confeſſion, I cannot conceive ſufficient Eviction of the
<hi>Witchcraft</hi> itſelf; and this Topic is conluded with Arguments and
Cautions further to the ſame Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Chap. 9. <hi>Of Wiſards.</hi> Theſe are deſcribed to be a
ſort of Practitioners, whom our Cuſtom and Country call Wiſe Men, and
Wiſe Women, reputed a kind of honeſt harmleſs Witches or Wiſards, who,
by good Words, hallowed Herbs, Salves, and other ſuperſtitious Ceremonies,
promiſe to allay and calm De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, Practices of other Witches, and the Force
of many Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes. But theſe being much of the ſame Nature with thoſe
before mentioned to uſe Spells, are referred unto them, and diſmiſs'd
with a ſhort Hiſtory of our Author's Obſervation.</p>
               <p>Chap. 10. <hi>Of Servants to Phyſicians and miniſtring
Help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> Our Author concludes his Number and Diſtinction 
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0570200100:64"/> of <hi>Empericks</hi> with this Tribe; who are ſuch as
either by oft ſerving Phyſicians, or converſing with them and viewing
their Practice, or by Employment from their Directions, or by Attendance about
the Sick, engroſs to themſelves ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed ſpecial Obſervations and
choice Remedies; and with ſuch ſmall Ware, taken upon credit, ſet up for
themſelves. Here the Inſufficiency of ſuch apiſh Imitation is
deſcanted upon, and this kind of ſecond-hand Uſe of other People's
Practice; ſhewing, in ſeveral Aphoriſtical Obſervations how unſafe
ſuch Experience in Phyſick is; as 
<q rend="inline">"how neceſſary it is, That Man ſhould be in
himſelf a Maſter of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſincere Judgment, who ſhall be able
truely to make right Uſe of another's Experience."</q> And even 
<q rend="inline">"That which Experience has once, or oft times
known and found to do good, muſt not therefore, in neceſſity, ſtill do
the ſame good, except the ſame Reaſon of the good, do, in each
Circumſtance, again commend and command it; which only they can judge and
examine who are wiſe and learned."</q> With other like Reflections therefore
on this prepoſterous Practice; and a Detail of ſuch Abilities and
Application as are requiſite for attaining a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency in this

               <p n="1">I. <hi>Of the Invention of Dials, Clocks, Watches, and other
Time-Tellers.</hi> Here, ſpeaking of the Diviſion of Time, he tells you,
whence the Name of <hi>Horae</hi> or Hours, was derived according to

according to the <hi>Egyptians</hi>; of the <hi>Clyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidrae</hi> or

               <p n="7">VII. <hi>Of the Art of Spinning and Weaving, with the
ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Materials of Garments.</hi> After a Word or two on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of
this Art aſcribed to <hi>Minerva,</hi> we are inform'd of a rare
ſelf-moving Engine at <hi>Dantzick,</hi> which would weave four or five Webs
at a time, and without human help work night and day; which, yet in favour of
the poor Weavers, was ſuppreſſed, and the Inventor ſecretly
deſtroy'd, according to <hi>Lancelotti.</hi> He next ſpeaks of the
primitive Attire of Fig-leaves, and <hi>Paul</hi> the Hermit's Suit of
Palm-leaves; the Skins of Beaſts; <hi>Arachne's</hi> Excellence in Spin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning;
the ſeveral ſorts of Materials whereof Cloth is woven, as the
<hi>Nettle-Cloth,</hi> that of the <hi>Palm-leaves,</hi> of the Bark of the

here deſcrib'd from <hi>Du Bartas</hi>; and of the <hi>Pumpion</hi> brought
from <hi>Mecha,</hi> whereof <hi>Peireskius</hi> had a kind of Silk woven, as
<hi>Gaſſendus</hi> relates in his Life, beſides which there is no
<hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricum Vegetabile,</hi> according to our Author; for that Silk properly
is made by and from the Silk-Worm, as <hi>Julius Scaliger</hi> againſt
<hi>Cardan</hi> ſhews; of which <hi>Pliny</hi> inſerts many a moral
Leſſon among his Obſervations. It is next ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that
<hi>Pamphilia</hi> firſt wove Silks; that the Emperor <hi>M. Aurel.
Antoninus</hi> firſt wore them in <hi>Europe</hi>; and that 
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0570200100:74"/> the Worm was firſt brought into this Quarter by certain
Monks in <hi>Juſtinian</hi>'s Time. That in the <hi>Summer-Iſlands</hi>
there are large beautiful-colour'd Spiders, which ſpin perfect raw Silk, as
<hi>Oviedo</hi> and Captain <hi>Smith</hi> relate. Of other Garments, made with
Hair, ſuch as the Prophets wore: Grograms of Goat's Hair; whereof
<hi>Busbequius</hi> gives a more particular Account; and Chamlets of Camel's
Hair, as we may further read in <hi>Aelian.</hi> Of Flax and Hemp; that they
were firſt dreſs'd in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that the <hi>Egyptian</hi> and
<hi>Jewiſh</hi> Prieſts wore their Veſtments thereof; alſo of Cotton
which grows in Balls on certain Shrubs. Next of the fine Linnen made in
<hi>Holland</hi> and <hi>Cambray,</hi> whence called Hollands and Cambricks,
which <hi>Adrian Junius</hi> deſcribes to be as white as ſnow, as fine as
Lawn, and as dear as Silk. Of the Sea-Wool, ſpoken of by <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
as fine as Silk according to <hi>La Cerda,</hi> which is made of the downy
Subſtance growing out of the large Shell-fiſh call'd <hi>Pinna.</hi> Alſo
a kind of Stone-Cloth made from certain Stones here named, which are beaten
into ſmall Fibres or Hairs, and ſo woven; it is call'd by <hi>Langius,</hi>
Salamander's Wool, having the property of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting Fire. <hi>Ferdinand
Imperatus</hi> had of it in his <hi>Muſeum,</hi> and <hi>Callimachus</hi>
hung up a Taper of it in the Temple of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> according to
<hi>Salmaſius.</hi> But there is a Vegetable of the ſame property call'd by
the <hi>Greeks Asbaſtos,</hi> which <hi>Pliny</hi> calls <hi>Linum vivum</hi>
or incombuſtible Flax, and ſays the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſes of Kings were wrapt in
it, when they were to be burn'd, to preſerve their Aſhes for the Urns.
<hi>Podocatter,</hi> who wrote <hi>de Rebus Cypriis</hi> in 1566, had of this
Cloth, which was ſeen by <hi>Tho. Porcacchius</hi> as he relates in his
<hi>Funeral Rites. Ludovicus Vives</hi> ſaw the like at <hi>Lovain,</hi> as
he alſo relates, and <hi>Baptiſta Porta,</hi> at <hi>Venice,</hi> as may be
read in his <hi>Nat. Magia.</hi> Mettals were alſo wrought into Cloth: ſuch
were the <hi>Attalic</hi> Garments, call'd by the <hi>Italians, Veſte di
Brocato di Oro</hi>; and when the marble Coffin of <hi>Mary,</hi> the Wife of
the Emperor <hi>Honorius,</hi> was dug up at <hi>Rome</hi> in 1544, tho' her
Body was conſumed and turned to duſt, all but her Teeth and Bones, her
golden Apparel was freſh; out of which, was extracted 36 Pound weight of pure
Gold, as <hi>Aldrovand</hi> records in his <hi>Muſaeum Metallicum.</hi> The
<hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> had alſo ſuch Veſtments, as may be ſeen in
<hi>Virgil,</hi> Aen. xi. But the ſtrangeſt of all, was that kind of Wool
mention'd by St. <hi>Hierom</hi> and <hi>Paulus Diaconus</hi> to have rained
down from the Clouds about <hi>Artois</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> whereof Cloth
was ſpun to the great Enrichment of the Country: <pb n="50" facs="tcp:0570200100:75"/> So that
as there was once <hi>Coelum eſcatile,</hi> as <hi>Salvian</hi> ſpeaks of
the wonderful <hi>Manna,</hi> in like manner there was now <hi>Coelum
textile,</hi> as we may term it; the Sky affording both Food and Rayment. To
this Chapter is join'd an <hi>Appendix</hi> of <hi>The Plumary Art.</hi> Here
it is obſerv'd to what Perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this Art was arrived in <hi>Florida,</hi>
and other Parts of the <hi>Weſt-Indies</hi>; where ſuch Birds of
<hi>Orient</hi> Plumage abound, as the <hi>Phenicopter, Parrot,</hi> and
<hi>Tomincio</hi>: With the manner how they ſtrip the Quills, and paſte on
the Feathers in all Shapes and Shades. What delicate Works of this kind
<hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand Cortez,</hi> ſaw in the Emperor <hi>Motizuma</hi>'s Palace at
<hi>Mexico.</hi> That Cardinal <hi>Paleotti</hi> had the Picture of St.
<hi>Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rom</hi> of this Workmanſhip; and that certain Fryers had learnt the
Art. That it was not unknown even to the Ancients. That St. <hi>Hierom</hi>
mentions it; alſo <hi>Julius Fermicus, Pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi> and <hi>Seneca.</hi>
That theſe Plumes ſurpaſs all the Beauties of the Pencil, not only in
Luſtre but Duration, and foil the Art of Painting.</p>
               <p n="8">VIII. <hi>Of the Art of Muſick, with the
Inſtruments,</hi> &amp;c. From the <hi>Pythagorean</hi> Notion of Muſick in
the Spheres, the Delight of Man's Soul in Harmony is here accounted for,
according to <hi>Macrobius</hi>; alſo from the Body of Man, which is a living
Organ, and Life itſelf, the Leſſon which his Soul plays thereon. That
vocal Muſick is moſt delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. That <hi>Pan</hi> deviſed the Imitation
of this muſical Pipe in the Throat of Man, with a <hi>Syringe</hi> or Reed,
tho' <hi>Lucretius</hi> aſcribes it to the whiſtling of the
<hi>Zephyrs</hi> in the Reeds. That in Imitation of them the Shank-bones of
Cranes were uſed, whence came the <hi>Flute:</hi> Not but muſical
Inſtruments were in the World before <hi>Pan</hi>'s Time; <hi>Jubal</hi>
being the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventor of the <hi>Harp</hi> and <hi>Organ.</hi> That the
<hi>Egyptian Mercury</hi> invented the Lyre or Lute, by a Tortoiſe-ſhell he
found on the <hi>Nile</hi>-ſide, to which ſome Nerves hung, reaching from
end to end, whereof <hi>Du Bartas</hi> has taken notice. That
<hi>Terpander</hi> encreaſed the Lyre from three Strings to ſeven,
<hi>Simonides</hi> added an eighth, and <hi>David</hi> mentions a
ten-ſtring'd Inſtrument, who invented many ſorts; but all are divided
into ſuch as are founded either by the <hi>Breath</hi> or <hi>Hand.</hi>
Since his Time many have been the Improvements. <hi>Leander Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berti</hi> in
his Deſcription of <hi>Italy</hi> relates that he ſaw a pair of Organs, in
which, Men would think they heard Boys and Men diſtinctly ſing their Parts
in Concert; and another Pair in the Duke of <hi>Mantua</hi>'s Court, made all
of <hi>Alabaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which gave a loud and full Sound; alſo another very
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0570200100:76"/> muſical Pair at <hi>Venice,</hi> made all of Glaſs,
which are men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd by <hi>Moryſon</hi> in his Travels. Pope
<hi>Sylveſter</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond made a Pair that would play without any other
Organiſt than warm Water: Such <hi>Hydraulics,</hi> frequent in
<hi>Italy,</hi> are ſounded alſo with cold Water. <hi>Gaudentius Merula, de
Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rab. Mundi,</hi> mentions an Organ at <hi>Milan;</hi> the Pipes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
were made of various Materials, as Wood, Braſs, White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead, and imitated
various muſical Inſtruments. Speaking next of vocal Muſick, natural and
artificial, the Scarcity of good natural Singers is obſerv'd, occaſioning
the Supply of muſical Inſtruments for Delight, and to appeaſe the Cares
of Life. Hence we are led to an <hi>Appendix, Of the Power and Efficacy of
Muſick.</hi> The Commendations of <hi>Orpheus</hi> by <hi>Horace</hi> and
<hi>Claudian,</hi> and of <hi>Silenus</hi> by <hi>Virgil;</hi> with <hi>Tho.
Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolph</hi>'s Exhortation to Muſick, finely illuſtrating the Force
thereof upon Rocks and Trees. Thus leaving things <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate,</hi> he
proceeds to Inſtances of the Regency of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick over Creatures,
<hi>rational</hi> and <hi>irrational</hi>; among other Authorities he produces
that of <hi>Henry Stephens,</hi> who ſays (in <hi>Pref. ad Herod.</hi>) that
he ſaw a Lion at <hi>London,</hi> which would forſake his Food to hear
Muſick. The Delight which Deer and Elephants take therein; and that the Aſs
only is not pleaſed with it. That Birds likewiſe are affected with
Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, and Hawks tamed therewith. That it rules alſo in the Water, as in
the famous Story of <hi>Arion</hi> and the Dolphin; and was expected to prevail
over Hell itſelf, as in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt made for the Recovery of
<hi>Eurydice,</hi> with a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to <hi>Spenſer</hi> out of <hi>W.
Brown</hi>'s Paſtorals, atteſting that if <hi>Orpheus</hi> had been but
half his equal, he had not left her in thoſe infernal Regions. Then for
rational Creatures, here are many Examples produced to ſhew, how Muſick has
all our Paſſions at Command; how Courage and Fear have been raiſed by it;
how Anger has been ſtirr'd up, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd by it; how it exhilarates and
enlivens the Spirits, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires Devotion, Chaſtity, and Civility; with an
Inſtance of the effect of <hi>Dactyls</hi> and <hi>Spondaics.</hi> That
Muſick has alſo power over the Body, to keep it from drooping and
wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rineſs, and cure it of Maladies; of this latter we have many particulars,
as the Cure of the Plague in <hi>Homer</hi> by Muſick; of the Frenſy, by
<hi>Zenocrates;</hi> of the <hi>Sciatica,</hi> from the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of
<hi>Theophraſtus;</hi> and ſome Aches, as reported in <hi>France:</hi> The
poiſonous Bite of the <hi>Tarantula</hi> in <hi>Italy;</hi> that kind of
Frenſy, call'd <hi>St. Vitus</hi> his Dance, in <hi>Germany,</hi> in which,
upon hearing of a Fiddle, the Patient dances till he is tired 
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0570200100:77"/> and cured; as <hi>Skenkius</hi> obſerves. Hence we
proceed to the Muſick of Speech and Eloquence: Of the <hi>Grecian</hi>
Orators, who had the power of Fire and Water, to inflame and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh; to
make Peace and War. Then of ſome Moderns, as <hi>Savanorola,</hi> who managed
the Commonwealth with his Tongue, and <hi>Ugolin</hi> the Friar, who, by a
Sermon, moved his Audience to beat their Enemies. And if plain Speech has
ſuch power, how much more muſt Words join'd with Harmony and Numbers? Here
we have a Summary of all the foremention'd Effects of Muſick in ſome
Verſes of <hi>Du Bartas;</hi> which is follow'd by <hi>Baptiſta
Porta</hi>'s nice Attempt to aſcribe the wonderful Effects of Muſick to the
Vertues of the ſeveral ſorts of Trees, whereof the Inſtruments are made,
which, ſays he, have a ſecret Property to cure Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes more than the
Sounds that are made of them. But our Author thinks him miſtaken, becauſe
bare Words have power over Men's Minds and Spirits; ſo ſhews us, more
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctly, from <hi>Scaliger,</hi> how the Vibration or trembling of the
Air, by Muſick, affects the Spirits of Man. This is further ſtrengthen'd by
the affinity between the Soul and Muſick, obſerv'd by <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>
and <hi>Macrobius,</hi> and the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of its being no wonder that every
Creature, which has a living Soul, ſhould be taken with Muſick, ſince the
Soul of the Univerſe, whereof every particular Soul is a Part, is made of
<hi>Harmony.</hi> This Head is concluded with an Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Force of
Eloquence in <hi>Pericles</hi> from <hi>Val. Maxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> and in the
Philoſopher <hi>Hegeſias,</hi> who ſo pathetically ſet forth the Evils
of Life, that his Auditors reſolv'd to kill themſelves, according to
<hi>Cicero.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">IX. <hi>Of the Invention of Glaſs, and Glaſs-Works.</hi>
We are here inform'd of the Ingredients whereof Glaſs is made; by what
Accident it was invented, from <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Joſephus;</hi> the
Properties of it, how fluid and ductile while hot, how hard, clean, and clear
when cold; how broken by Poiſons, exceſſive Cold, or Heat. How Art in
forming of it imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the Creation, it being made with the Breath of the
Mouth. How preciouſly it is eſteem'd of in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where it is
exchanged for Gold, according to <hi>Pigafetta.</hi> Where the beſt are made,
near <hi>Venice,</hi> and how. Tho' ours is ſo brittle, that an Artiſt at
<hi>Rome,</hi> in <hi>Tiberius</hi> his Time, could make it malleable and
flexible, and that he was ſecretly made away, leſt the Knowledge of his Art
ſhould make Gold contemptible. Then we come to the Uſes of Glaſs in Cups
and Veſſels, Looking-Glaſſes, Teleſcopes, <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0570200100:78"/>
Microſcopes, Thermometers, Spheres, Spectacles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by old Eyes become
young, ſmall Objects are magnified, things inviſible ſeen, and things
behind us brought before, and thoſe done in our Neighbour's Houſes, or
Enemy's Tents, brought to our Knowledge without the help of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic; for which
we are referr'd to <hi>Baptiſta Porta.</hi> Then we advance more to
Particulars, as that <hi>Cornelius Van Drebble,</hi> that rare Engineer of
<hi>Alcmar,</hi> who liv'd here in K. <hi>James</hi>'s Court, invented the
Microſcopes, whereby we diſcover the ſubtileſt Objects, and the
ſmalleſt: And that <hi>Sanctorius,</hi> a famous Phyſician of
<hi>Padua,</hi> invented the Thermometers, which, in a Man's Chamber,
diſcover the Temper of the Air, whether hot or cold, moiſt or dry, or
inclining to ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. That Teleſcopes, for diſcovering things a-far off,
were invented by <hi>Jacobus Metius</hi> of <hi>Alcmar,</hi> as <hi>Des
Cartes</hi> tells us, and perfected by <hi>Gallileo Gallilei</hi> the
<hi>Florentine;</hi> which will repreſent Objects thirty times bigger than
the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent Quantity, and a hundred times nearer than the appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent
Diſtance. By theſe, new Stars have been diſcover'd, and new Worlds in
them; the Moon brought down to Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination, and found to be another
<hi>America.</hi> By theſe <hi>Teleſius</hi> has given us his
<hi>Selenographia,</hi> or Deſcription of the Countries and Provinces there;
and <hi>Van Drebble</hi> ſaw not only the Hills and Plains, but the
Foreſts, Cities and Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in this Lunary World; as <hi>Gaſſendi</hi>
has written in his Life of <hi>Peiresk.</hi> And as for Burning-Glaſſes, we
have here the Account of the <hi>Roman</hi> Ships fired by <hi>Archimedes</hi>
at <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racuſe,</hi> from <hi>Plutarch</hi>'s Life of <hi>Marcellus</hi>;
and thoſe of <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talianus</hi> fired by <hi>Proclus</hi> with ſuch

than all the Galleys of <hi>Italy,</hi> or an Army of a Hundred Thouſand Men
could do, as <hi>Gaffarel</hi> from others relates. <hi>Kircher</hi> indeed
could never hit upon the Experiment, or hear of Glaſſes that would burn
above fifteen Paces diſtance; but <hi>Baptiſta Porta</hi> declares there is
a way to make Glaſſes that would burn things at any diſtance, and Dr.
<hi>John Dee,</hi> in the Preface to his <hi>Monas Hieroglyphica,</hi> that it
may be made to calcine Stones and reduce them to powder. After this we come to
a Remark or two on the Spheres of <hi>Archimedes,</hi> which repreſented the
Motion of the <pb n="54" facs="tcp:0570200100:79"/> heavenly Bodies, and is deſcribed by
<hi>Claudian</hi>; with the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of <hi>Kircher,</hi> that the
outſide only was of Glaſs; yet <hi>Peter Ramus</hi> ſpeaks of two Glaſs
Spheres at <hi>Paris,</hi> like thoſe of <hi>Archimedes.</hi> Next we have an
Obſervation on the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phitheatre of Glaſs in <hi>Pliny,</hi> which was a
kind of Foſſile, or <hi>Obſidian</hi> Glaſs found in
<hi>Aethiopia,</hi> black, tranſparent, and eaſily wrought; of which was
built the ſtately Tomb in <hi>Alexandria,</hi> by <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> for
<hi>Alexander,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> relates. <hi>Herodotus</hi> alſo tells
us this kind of Glaſs was wrought hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, to caſe or enſhrine dead
Bodies, that they might be ſeen. The ſpecular Stone was of this kind but
brighter, and like Cryſtal: It was alſo uſed to ſhelter Fruits from
blighting Colds. But this kind of Stone is return'd by <hi>Pan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cirollus, inter
non inventa. Leander</hi> mentions a compleat Galley of Glaſs at
<hi>Venice,</hi> and Glaſs Organs: <hi>James Howel</hi> ſaw ſuch a Galley
at the <hi>Murano,</hi> as he writes in his <hi>Hiſtory of</hi> Venice. As
Glaſs is diaphanous and paſſive to Objects, ſo it is alſo reflective,
and beats back the Objects which fall upon it, when the backſide is lin'd
with Tinſoil, or Leaf of Tin-ſilver, or other Metal; and thus
Looking-Glaſſes are made, wherewith many ſtrange Feats may be perform'd,
even to the Suſpicion of Magic and unlawful Arts.</p>
               <p n="10">X. <hi>The Invention of Shipping, Sailing, and the
Mariner's Compaſs.</hi> This Invention of riding on the blue Roads with
wooden Horſes, as the old comic Poet phraſes it, was highly bold as
<hi>Horace</hi> expreſſes it, and no leſs uſeful as all the World have
found it. The Motives to ſuch Hazard are ſhewn from the Book of
<hi>Wiſdom,</hi> to be Deſire of Gain in Man, and a Willingneſs in God,
that the Works of his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ſhould not lie idle. But we ſhall admire
ſuch Boldneſs the more, in conſidering the Simplicity of Sailing in the
firſt Ages, when the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> made their Boats of Reeds and
Ruſhes, according to <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Lucan;</hi> ſuch was that in
which <hi>Moſes</hi> was preſerv'd, ſuch is ſpoken of in
<hi>Iſaiah;</hi> alſo among the <hi>Indians,</hi> according to
<hi>Herodotus.</hi> The old <hi>Britains</hi> had their <hi>Naves Vitiles,</hi>
ſays <hi>Pliny</hi>; the <hi>Iriſh</hi> their <hi>Corraghes,</hi> being
made of Wicker cover'd with Leather, not much bigger than a Basket; ſuch
<hi>Strabo</hi> ſays he ſail'd to <hi>Egypt</hi> in; ſuch were thoſe
which <hi>Caeſar</hi> learnt to make of the <hi>Britains;</hi> and ſuch
were uſed by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> as teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies <hi>Herodotus:</hi>
And they were ſo light that the Maſter could carry them on Shore, as they
carried him at Sea, like the <hi>Arabian</hi> Fiſherman, whoſe
Tortoiſe-Shell was his Shal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lop by Water, and his Houſe by Land, as
<hi>Dubartas</hi> has it <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0570200100:80"/> from a <hi>Latin</hi> Epigram.
Such like alſo, for lightneſs, the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> uſe on the
<hi>Nile,</hi> and <hi>Boterus</hi> mentions ſuch again in the
<hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where they have alſo their <hi>Balſa's,</hi> or
Bulruſhes rafted together, and row to fiſh in the main Sea upon them, as
may be read in <hi>Acoſta.</hi> The <hi>Indians</hi> have likewiſe their
Canoes made out of one Tree hollowed, and in <hi>Greenland,</hi> Boats ſhaped
like a Shuttle, covered with Seal-Skins, and rib'd with Bones of Fiſhes, as
<hi>Purchas</hi> deſcribes. <hi>Pet. Gellius</hi> in his Deſcription of the
<hi>Thracian Boſphorus,</hi> ſpeaks of a Ship he ſaw, laden with
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabian</hi> Merchandize, which had no Iron in it, but was ſewed
together with Cords, covered with Roſin of the Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>incence-Tree, and her
Tackling made of the Tree which bears the <hi>Indian</hi> Nut, which Mr.
<hi>Geo. Herbert</hi> deſcribes. But the <hi>Tyrians</hi> are reputed the
firſt who improved Shipping with Maſts, Sails, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and
<hi>Ovid</hi> tells us that <hi>Jaſon</hi> was the firſt Contriver of
Ships, and that his famous <hi>Argo</hi> was ſtelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by Aſtronomers.
The Shell-Fiſh called <hi>Nautilus,</hi> gave the firſt Hint of framing a
Ship, according to <hi>Pliny,</hi> as the flying of the Kite did of the Stern;
afterwards they were magnificently made, as that Cedar Galley built by
<hi>Caligula,</hi> which had Halls, Rooms, and Gardens in it: and that of
<hi>Ptolemaeus Philopater,</hi> who built one two hundred eighty Cubits long,
fifty two Cubits from the Bottom to the upper Decks; had four hundred Banks for
four thouſand Rowers, with Gardens and Orchards at top of it, as
<hi>Plutarch</hi> relates in his Life of <hi>Demetrius.</hi> But the
Improvement of Navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation without Sails or Oars, ſo as never to be
wind-bound, was more commendable. We have the Account in <hi>Vitruvius</hi>
that for this end the Ancients had in their Ships three Wheels on each ſide,
with eight <hi>radii,</hi> a Span long, projecting from each Wheel, and ſix
Oxen within turning the ſame, which caſting the Water backward, moved the
Ship on with great Speed. They had alſo an Inſtrument in thoſe Ships,
called <hi>Carrum,</hi> dividing the Hours of the Day. Lord <hi>Bacon,</hi> in
his <hi>Novum Organum,</hi> ſpeaks of Boats in <hi>England</hi> to ſail
under Water; and <hi>Julius Scaliger,</hi> of a Ship he could make that would
ſteer herſelf. This Chapter ends with the famous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of a
Naval Fight in <hi>Claudius Caeſar</hi>'s time, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by
<hi>Suetonius,</hi> and <hi>Juvenal</hi>'s Account of the Earthen Boats uſed
in <hi>Aegypt.</hi> So we proceed to the <hi>Appendix, of the Mariners
Compaſs,</hi> wherein we are inform'd that <hi>John Goia,</hi> or <hi>Flavius
Goia</hi> of <hi>Amalphi</hi> in <hi>Campania</hi> in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of
<hi>Naples,</hi> firſt invented the Compaſs, who is therefore 
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0570200100:81"/> celebrated by <hi>Du Bartas.</hi> By what Stars Pilots
were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected before the ſaid Invention, and Travellers in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts of
<hi>Arabia,</hi> and how they were oblig'd to ſtop when the Sky was clouded,
therefore our Author ſays of the Loadſtone, as <hi>Rablais</hi> of the
Milſtone, that 'tis the moſt precious of all others. Then follows
<hi>Claudian</hi>'s Deſcription of the <hi>Magnet,</hi> its two Properties of
<hi>Attraction</hi> and <hi>Direction,</hi> which gave Invention to the
Mariners Compaſs, whoſe Needle, touched therewith, points its Lilly-Hand to
the North, in any part of the World. The Inhabitants of <hi>Taprobana</hi>
having not the <hi>Pole-Star</hi> to ſail by, carried certain Birds on board,
which being ſet at liberty, flew by natural Inſtinct to the Shore; ſo
gave direction to the Sailors, according to <hi>Pliny.</hi> The
<hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> and the <hi>Bactrians,</hi> according to <hi>Curtius,</hi>
travelled by the Guidance of Stars; but the <hi>Arabians,</hi> ſays <hi>Lud.
Bartema,</hi> in certain Wooden Boxes on their Camels, have the Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone
like the Compaſs, to ſteer their Courſe by over the Deſarts. Some
aſcribe this Invention to the <hi>Chineſe</hi>; and Dr. <hi>Gilbert, de
Magnete, lib.</hi> 1. affirms that <hi>Paulus Venetus</hi> brought it firſt
into <hi>Italy, An.</hi> 1260, having learnt it from them. <hi>Ludovicus
Vertomanus</hi> reports, that he ſaw about the Year 1500, the <hi>Indian</hi>
Pilot of his Ship, ſailing in <hi>Java,</hi> ſteer by a Compaſs, made as
in <hi>Europe.</hi> This Head is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded with a Remark, that our Compaſs
is not yet brought to due Perfection, for that the <hi>Magnetic</hi> Needle
does not yet point exactly to the North in all Meridians, to the cauſe of
much Error in Navigation. <hi>Van Helmont</hi> profeſſes a way to rectify
this Inconvenience, which, tho' ſomewhat fanciful, as appears by our Author's
Account of it, 'tis yet to be wiſh'd ſome Devices might be found to amend
that Imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</p>
               <p n="11">XI. <hi>The Art of Cicuration and taming of wild
Beaſts.</hi> It appears by the Introduction of this Chapter, that we have not
the ſame Title to this Book which our Author intended, and that he had call'd
it <hi>Hiſtoria Naturae Subactae</hi>; therefore thinks this Chapter no
Digreſſion. He begins with a Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from the New Teſtament,
ſhewing, that <hi>every kind of Beaſt is tamed by Mankind;</hi> gives
ſeveval Examples of the Elephant, and refers to many Stories of their
Officiouſneſs and Docility in one of <hi>Lipſius</hi> his Epiſtles; and
of the Lion out of <hi>Pliny</hi>; that Tygers drew the Coach of
<hi>Bacchus,</hi> from <hi>Silius Italicus</hi>; and that of
<hi>Heliogabalus,</hi> as <hi>Lampridius</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates. <hi>Martial</hi>
mentions the ſame in <hi>Domitian</hi>'s time; that the fierce
<hi>Byſon,</hi> and Stag were taught to do the ſame; and 
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0570200100:82"/> at <hi>Walton</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> our Author ſaw
four Stags draw a ſmall Coach. <hi>Lipſius</hi> in his Notes upon
<hi>Tacitus,</hi> ſpeaks of Dogs drawing a Chariot at <hi>Rome</hi>; and
<hi>Textor,</hi> of Oſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triches that drew the Coach of the Emperor
<hi>Firmus.</hi> The Emperor <hi>Maximilian</hi> the ſecond, had a Deer which
would receive a Bridle and a Rider, and run againſt the fleeteſt Horſe,
as <hi>Mich. Neander</hi> relates. <hi>Martial</hi> mentions alſo a Deer
uſed to a Bridle, and <hi>Camden</hi> in his Annals of Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi>
that Sir <hi>Hierom Bowes</hi> brought from <hi>Muſcovia</hi> certain
<hi>Does</hi> of admirable Swiftneſs, which being yoked and coupled in a
Coach, would carry a Man with great Speed. Next we have an Account of tame
Panthers, Leopards, and Lions to hunt with, as the King of <hi>Cambala</hi>'s,
which <hi>Aelian</hi> mentions, and <hi>Scaliger</hi>; and Mr.
<hi>Moryſon</hi> ſpeaks of Leopards ſo tame, that they would leap up
behind the Huntſman on his Horſe, and ſit like a Dog, and ſoon
diſpatch a Hart, which ſhews the Excellence of Man's Abilities to ſubdue
other Creatures; but as <hi>Xenophon</hi> obſerves, it is far eaſier taming
any Creature than Man; and <hi>Seneca</hi> has a Reflection to the ſame
purpoſe, that no Creature is ſo wayward, fierce, and untractable as Man. We
have next an Account from <hi>Strabo,</hi> of a Crocodile that had been tamed,
and Dragons mentioned by <hi>Seneca</hi> to have crept tamely upon Men's
Tables, among their Cups; and of a four-legged Serpent in <hi>Cairo,</hi> grown
familiar and harmleſs. Many Inſtances of Birds; as, Oſtriches drawing a
Coach; Eagles enured to fly at Fowl like Hawks; a Crow taught to fly at
Partridges, and Wild-Ducks made Decoys. Of Sea-Animals; the <hi>Mannti,</hi> or
Sea-Cow is inſtanced, from <hi>Peter Martyr</hi>; the Sea-Horſe, from
<hi>Leo Afer</hi>; and the Fiſh called <hi>Reverſus,</hi> by which the
<hi>Indians</hi> caught others, as is related by <hi>Bodin,</hi> in his
<hi>Theatrum Naturae,</hi> alſo by <hi>Purchas</hi> and <hi>P. Martyr.
Pliny</hi>'s Dolphins, which would ſuffer Correction like Setting-Dogs, as
<hi>Oppian</hi> alſo teſtifies, and of Otters taught to drive Fiſh into
the Net, according to <hi>Cardan.</hi> Alſo ſeveral Examples of Wild
Beaſts tamed for Sport and Pleaſure, as well as Service; ſuch were the
Dancing Camels which <hi>Leo</hi> ſaw, and the Elephants which danced on the
Ropes, in <hi>Seneca,</hi> with the manner of teaching them upon a hot Floor,
from <hi>Sandys</hi> in his Travels. The Elephant <hi>Busbequius</hi> ſaw at
<hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which danced and play'd at Ball. The Bear which
danced to the Muſick of his own Tabor, and then begg'd for Reward, ſeen by
<hi>Neander.</hi> The Dance of Horſes at the Marriage of the Duke of
<hi>Florence,</hi> atteſted by Sir <hi>K. Digby</hi>; and the Aſs ſeen by
<hi>Leo</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> which would <pb n="58" facs="tcp:0570200100:83"/> vie Feats
with <hi>Banks</hi> his Horſe, that rare Maſter of the
<hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balliſtic</hi> Art. Here we have a Story of the dangerous Effects of
ſuch Dancing Horſes among the <hi>Sabarites,</hi> when their Enemies the
<hi>Crotonians</hi> brought Muſick into the Field of Battle, from
<hi>Diodorus Siculus, Aelian,</hi> and <hi>Pliny.</hi> To ſhew that a Baboon
has play'd upon the Guittar, and a Monky at Cheſs, we are referr'd to
<hi>Balt. Caſtilione.</hi> Of Birds, are mentioned the Talking Starlings,
Pyes and Crows at <hi>Rome</hi>; Cardinal <hi>Aſcanio</hi>'s Parrot would
ſay the <hi>Creed,</hi> and another in <hi>Spain</hi> which would ſing the
<hi>Gamut,</hi> as <hi>John Barnes</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Frier relates, in
his learned Book <hi>de Aequivocatione.</hi> Many of theſe Examples are
ſum'd up by <hi>Martial</hi> in his Book of <hi>Shows, Epig.</hi> 105 which
is here recited, with a Tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Laſtly, it is obſerved how Animals
will learn the Language of their Country, ſo far as is neceſſary for
their Direction, as Elephants, Horſes, and Mules, which <hi>Claudian</hi> has
taken notice of; and that Dogs have been trained for the Wars by the old
<hi>Britons</hi> and <hi>Gauls,</hi> as <hi>Strabo</hi> and <hi>Camden</hi>
relate; ſo have Bulls, Bears, and Lions, according to <hi>Lucre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius,</hi>

and <hi>Origen,</hi> ſhewing that the Wit and Reaſon of Man reduces all
other Creatures to his Service and Subjection, concludes this Chapter.</p>
               <p n="12">XII. <hi>Of certain Sports and Extravagancies of Art.</hi>
In this laſt Chapter of the Book, it is ſet forth, that as Nature has her
<hi>Ludicra,</hi> ſo has Art; and that Art as well as Nature is never more
wonderful than in ſmaller Works: That St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> admired as
much at the Tooth of a Moth as that of an Elephant. So we deſcend to
Particulars, as the Ivory Ants of <hi>Callicrates</hi>; the little Ivory
Chariot, Horſes and Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Myrmecides,</hi> to be cover'd with the
Wings of a Fly; and the Ship with all her Tackling, which a Bee could hide,
according to <hi>Pliny</hi> and <hi>Aelian.</hi> Next are <hi>Vulcan</hi>'s
Nets, mentioned out of <hi>Ovid.</hi> The Waggon and Oxen of Glaſs, which
might be concealed by a Fly, in <hi>Cardan</hi>; and the neat little Wooden
Lock, mentioned by <hi>Leander Alberti</hi>; which introduces the rare
Workmanſhip of <hi>Mark Scaliot</hi> a Blackſmith of <hi>London,</hi> in
his Iron Lock and Key and Gold Chain of forty three Links, all drawn by a Flea,
and all, with the Flea, weighing but one Grain and a half; as witneſſes
<hi>John Stow</hi> in his <hi>Annals,</hi> who ſaw it. <hi>Scaliger</hi>
alſo men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions a Flea with a Gold Chain, and <hi>Leo Afer</hi> ſuch a
Chain, for which the Artiſt had a Suit of Cloth of Gold beſtowed upon him
by the <hi>Sultan. Hadr. Junius</hi> ſaw at <hi>Mechlin,</hi> a 
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0570200100:84"/> Basket made of a Cherry-Stone, which held fourteen pair of
Dice, whoſe Spots were viſible. Then we have notice taken of the precious
Stone in a Ring, repreſenting <hi>Phaeton,</hi> his Chariot and Steeds,
tumbling into the River, as men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in <hi>Galen</hi>; and <hi>Geo.
Whitehead</hi>'s Ship, with all her Tackling, moving of itſelf on a Table,
with Rowers, a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man playing on the Lute, a Whelp howling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as
affirmed by <hi>Schottus,</hi> in <hi>Itin. Italiae</hi>; alſo,
<hi>Gafferell</hi>'s Account, in his <hi>Unheard of Curioſities,</hi> of the
Clock at <hi>Leghorn,</hi> which had on it a Company of Shepherds playing on
the Bagpipes, with others dancing by Couples thereto, in Time and Meaſure.
Here is alſo mentioned the Chain, in <hi>Cardan,</hi> ſo little and ſo
light, that when it fell to the Ground, it would not break, tho' made of
Glaſs; and the Iron Spider in <hi>Walchius</hi>'s ninth Fable; to which our
Author applies the Verſes in <hi>Dubartas,</hi> celebrating the Iron Fly of
<hi>Regiomontanus</hi>; alſo the Bear and Lion of Gold (preſented to the
<hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe</hi>) each a Middle-Finger's Length, and
both weighing but a <hi>French</hi> Crown, for which the Artiſt was rewarded
with three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Crowns. This is followed with <hi>Claudian</hi>'s
Epigram <hi>de Quadriga Marmorea,</hi> and the Tranſlation; and the whole
Book concludes with a Reference to many more Inſtances of the like nature, in
<hi>John Tradeſcant</hi>'s Ark at <hi>Lambeth,</hi> and the Archives of
ſeveral Princes and private Perſons, who have their <hi>Pinacotheca</hi>'s
and <hi>Technematophylacia</hi> to preſerve all Rarities; more particularly
that of <hi>Bernard Paludanus</hi> a Phyſician in <hi>Holland,</hi> upon
which here is an Epigram quoted, and Information of another among
<hi>Grotius</hi>'s Poems to the ſame purpoſe.</p>

               <p>THis <hi>Engliſh Theological Library</hi> may well recommend
itſelf to the Notice of the <hi>Britiſh Librarian,</hi> ſeeing the
Author, who was Hiſtoriographer to the Elector of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denburg,</hi> 
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0570200100:85"/> has ſo ſincerely intended therein the Honour of the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation, and has common-placed, ſo ſuccinctly and, for
the generality, ſo methodically, above <hi>ſixteen Hundred Writers of
Divinity</hi> in <hi>England, Scotland,</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
ſome of the moſt conſiderable Heads. But being writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>Latin</hi>
and printed abroad, at <hi>Koningsberg</hi> in <hi>Pruſſia,</hi> it ſeems
not to have yet made ſufficiently its way among ſome of our Readers, to
whom it might have been uſeful in ſeveral reſpects; and poſſibly
that, among the reſt, of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiring an Ambition to give us a more enlarged
and perfect Plan upon this Subject: For, ſtrictly ſpeaking, tho' ſuch a
ſpiritual Army, of all ranks; is here muſter'd up, many who were eminent
among us are omitted, and ſeveral enliſted who little deſerve ſuch
Diſtinction; ſome alſo, who were Writers in different Sciences, are not
very properly perhaps introduced here; and, of moſt, we have only the bare
Names, with the ſhorteſt Reference to thoſe Parts of their Works, which
concern the reſpective Topics, under which they are aſſembled. But the
Author's Aim was Variety and Diſpatch; and rather to bring a great number of
Writers into a little Compaſs, than either to appear ſeverely ſcrupu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
in his Choice, and always diſtinctly acquainted with their Characters, or to
make his Readers conſtantly ſo with the Editions of their Works. The Book
will however be very ſerviceable to any Reader or Writer upon the Subjects
herein treated of. It will yield Matter of Recollection to thoſe who are even
moſt converſant in our Theological Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, and to thoſe who are moſt
inquiſitive after them, continual Directions for further Satisfaction. The
Author neglected no Advantages to render it thus far uſeful; he ſeems to
have conſulted our Catalogues very diligently, which ſpecify thoſe
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Authors who have written upon the ſeveral Parts of
Scripture, and other Points of Divinity; and further, for his purpoſe, to
have made good Uſe of his Time while he was in the Library at
<hi>Oxford,</hi> among ſeveral of the Books themſelves which they refer to,
as alſo of the Converſation he had with Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> and other
learned Men in <hi>England,</hi> particularly Dr. <hi>Thomas Barlow,</hi>
afterwards Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> who was himſelf an
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical Library.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the Method and Contents more particularly of this Work;
after the Author's Dedication to the <hi>Elector</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and a
learned Epiſtle to the Reader, he opens it with a copious Preface, concerning
the different Verſions and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of the Bible in <hi>England,</hi> with
notice of thoſe among <pb n="61" facs="tcp:0570200100:86"/> us who have written any
Diſcourſes thereon, or Books to explain it, as Annotations, Lexicons,
Criticiſms, Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies, Chorographies, and the like. Then he begins his
<hi>firſt</hi> Book with the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commentators on the <hi>Old
Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> goes diſtinctly through all the Parts or <hi>Books</hi>
thereof, and through all the <hi>Chapters</hi> of every Book; and therein tells
us, what <hi>Engliſh</hi> Author has written upon any of the ſaid Books,
Chapters, or Verſes in them. The like he does in his <hi>ſecond</hi> Book
by all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Commentaries, Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, and Sermons on the
<hi>New Teſtament;</hi> compriſing a Book in every Chapter, and the Writers
on each Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in a Paragraph. Thus having got over near half the Volume we
come to the laſt Book, which is divided into <hi>Twenty-one</hi> Chapters;
the firſt <hi>Six</hi> of which, comprehend chiefly his <hi>Syſtema
Theologiae Poſitivae,</hi> and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors treating of
the ſeveral Branches therein; which, for brevity, we ſhall refer to. Then
we come, in the <hi>Seventh,</hi> to thoſe <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> who have
written of the <hi>Church</hi> and its Government, Ordination,
Repreſentatives, Revenues, Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, Schiſms, Ceremonies, Feſtivals,
Sabbath, Muſick, and oeconomic State; particularly, Matrimony, Polygamy, and
Education. The 8th is of the Writers on the four laſt Things. 9. Thoſe who
have wrote of Polemical Divinity. 10. Againſt Atheiſts, Jews, Turks, and
Infidels. 11. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Popery. 12. Againſt the Socinians, Anabaptiſts,
&amp;c. 13. Againſt Enthuſiaſts, Libertines, Antinomians, and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minians.
14. Againſt the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Sectaries, Puritans, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts,
Browniſts, Independents, Fanaticks, Presbyterians, &amp;c. 15. Againſt the
Quakers. 16. On School-Divinity. 17. On Practical Divinity. 18. On
Caſuiſtical Divinity. 19. Of the improved Editions of the Fathers in
<hi>England.</hi> 20. Of our Politico-Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtorians. And
laſtly, 21, of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Councils.</p>
               <p>Then follows the <hi>Appendix,</hi> containing an epiſtolary
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe upon the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> written in his native Tongue;
no Author having publiſh'd, in <hi>Germany,</hi> any thing upon the
Inſtitution, Progreſs, and Purpoſe of that laudable Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: With a Liſt

               <p>WHen this Pamphlet was publiſh'd, there was a Controverſy on
foot about the Stage; and while others wrote to ſhew what it then

<q rend="inline">"If the <hi>major</hi> Part of them (as he

               <p>The <hi>Dialogue</hi> is held between <hi>Lovewit</hi> and
<hi>Truman</hi> an old <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier,</hi> who knew the Stage in the Reign of
K. <hi>Charles</hi> I. From theſe we learn, how much the Actors before the
Civil Wars ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed their Succeſſors: Why they did not now revive
<hi>Ben John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Plays. Where, before the Wars, the Town ſupported
<hi>five</hi> Play-houſes at once; and in which of them they always acted by
Day-light: That now the Plays in <hi>two</hi> Houſes only, would hardly draw
an Audience, without a Signior <hi>Fideli</hi> or a Monſieur <hi>L'Abbe.</hi>
That <hi>Edward Allen</hi> built a Play-houſe, alſo <hi>Dulwich</hi>
College in 1619. Then we have a little Hiſtory of the Actors during the
Rebellion; ſhewing how honourably they ſerved in the King's Army. Next, how
they return'd to acting, but pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vately; and, in <hi>Oliver</hi>'s Time, at

                     <hi>at</hi> Weſtmeſtre. Folio, 1477. 75 Leaves<note n="*" place="bottom">This
is a Title gather'd from what the <hi>Tranſlator</hi> mentions in his
Preface, and the <hi>Printer,</hi> in his Concluſion of the Book; for the Art
of Printing had not yet arrived at the Diſtinction of <hi>Title-pages</hi> in
Form. Further, we may remark of this antique <hi>Specimen</hi> of that, then,
new Art in <hi>England,</hi> that if it is not our firſt Book printed here,
it may be the ſecond, tho' printed ſo late in the Year above-mention'd as
<hi>November</hi>; and tho' ſome other ſmaller Work might be printed by
<hi>Caxton</hi> the ſame Year. For tho' the Knowledge of two, printed before
it, by him, is deſcended to us; yet one is expreſsly ſaid to be printed
abroad, and the other has no place mention'd where it was printed. Dr.
<hi>Conyers Middleton</hi> obſerves, 
<q rend="inline">"It has been generally aſſerted and
believ'd, that all <hi>Caxton</hi>'s Books were printed in the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey of
<hi>Westminſter</hi>; yet we have no Aſſurance of it from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor
any mention of the place before 1477."</q> Which Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation is plainly
drawn from the Date of this Book, and it appears thereby to be the firſt, at
leaſt now in being, which was printed at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>;

there is in being a fair MS of this Tranſlation, and, what ſome may think
yet a greater Curioſity, an Illumination in it, repreſenting King
<hi>Edward</hi> IV. his Queen, and the Prince, with the Picture alſo of this
<hi>Antony Wydeville</hi> Earl <hi>Rivers,</hi> preſenting <hi>Caxton</hi> to
the King. But more particularly of the printed Book, we obſerve, it is
perform'd on a good thick Paper, in which may be diſcern'd its Maker's Mark
to be ſomewhat like a Pair of Horns, with a Flower over them. The Pages have
no Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers at top, nor Signatures, or Catch-words at bottom; theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
more modern Improvements in Printing, at leaſt in <hi>England.</hi> The
Diviſion of the Chapters is ſeldom by any larger Space than the other
lines; only the three firſt lines of every Chapter being ſhorter than the
reſt, leave room, towards the Margin, for the <hi>initial</hi> Letter, which
is always a ſmall one; and the ſecond Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Word which begins
every Chapter, is always a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. As to <hi>Orthography,</hi> the ſame
Words are not always ſpell'd alike, and ſeveral of the Proper Names are
much obſcur'd by the old Manner of ſpelling them, eſpecially after the
<hi>French</hi> Copy: and as to <hi>Pointing,</hi> there are but two ſorts of
Stops uſed; the one, a little Daſh, the other, a little Croſs; and
ſeldom either uſed as a Period at the End of a complete Sentence, it being
thought ſufficient Diſtinction to allow a little longer Space there than
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween other Words, and to begin the next Sentence with a Capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal. More
Obſervations might hence be made on the Rudiments of Printing in
<hi>England</hi>; but to thoſe who are not curious after ſuch Inquiries,
poſſibly the greater Number, theſe may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Of the noble Earl
<hi>Rivers,</hi> who tranſlated this Book, much might be written: therefore
we ſhall only obſerve here, that he publiſh'd one or more Books after
this, and refer thoſe who would know more of him to the Chronicles, and
eſpecially to <hi>Dugdale's Baronage</hi>; where it may appear what a Man of

               <p>THE firſt Page of this Book begins with the Earl's Preface or
Introduction. Herein he obſerves, that every hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Creature is ſubject to
the Storms of Fortune, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex'd <pb n="64" facs="tcp:0570200100:89"/> with worldly
Adverſity, of which he had largely had his Part; but having been reliev'd by
the Goodneſs of God, he was exhorted to diſpoſe his recover'd Life to his
Service. And underſtanding there was to be a Jubilee and Pardon at <hi>St.
James's</hi> in <hi>Spain, an.</hi> 1473. he determin'd upon a Voyage thither:
ſo in <hi>July</hi> the ſame Year, ſet ſail from <hi>Southampton</hi>;
when, a worſhipful Gentleman in his Company, named <hi>Lowys de
Bretaylles,</hi> lent him to paſs over the Time, this Book of the <hi>Sayings
of the Philoſophers,</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> which had been tranſlated
from the <hi>Latin</hi> by Meſſire <hi>Johan de Teonville,</hi> Provoſt
of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Earl was very much af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the wholeſome and
ſweet Sayings therein of the <hi>Paynems</hi>; and finding how 
<q rend="inline">"it ſpeaketh univerſally to the Example, Weel,
and Doctryne of alle Kynges, Prynces, and to People of every Eſtate; lawdes
Vertu and Science, blames Vices and Ignorance;"</q> tho' he could not then, nor
in all that Pilgrimage, overſee it well at his Pleaſure, thro' 
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0570200100:90"/> the Diſpoſitions that belong to the Taker of a Jubilee
and Pardon, and the great Acquaintance he found there of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipful Folks,
he intended at a more convenient Time to be better acquainted with it.
Remaining in this Opinion after the King commanded him to attend upon the
Prince, and having then leiſure, he tranſlated it into <hi>Engliſh,</hi>
which had not been before done: But as there were divers Copies of this Book,
differing from each other, he concludes with intimating his hopes, that he
ſhall not be cenſured for that which he has follow'd; or his Tranſlation
judg'd of by thoſe which vary from it.</p>
               <p>The Work itſelf opens with the Sayings of <hi>Sedechias;</hi>
ſo goes on with thoſe of many eminent Ancients, as <hi>Homer, Solon,
Hyppocrates, Pythagoras, Diogenes, Socrates, Plato, Ariſtotle, Alexander,
Ptolemy, Seneca,</hi> St. <hi>Gregory, Galen,</hi> and ſome few others; all
whom have a Chapter a-piece be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon their Sayings. But the concluding
Chapter comprehends the Sayings of ſeveral Perſons; firſt, of thoſe
whoſe Names are remember'd, and laſtly, ſuch as are <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous;</hi>
from which, as the <hi>Apopthegms</hi> of moſt of thoſe Ancients are now
more directly tranſlated from the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Languages, in which they were
deliver'd, we ſhall only give this one Example.. 
<q rend="inline">"Ther cam byfore a Kyng thre Wyſemen; the one
was a <hi>Greke,</hi> the other a <hi>Jewe,</hi> and the therde a
<hi>Saraſyn;</hi> of whom the ſayd Kyng deſirid, that ych of them wold
utter ſom good and notable Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Then the <hi>Greke</hi> ſayd, I may
wele correcte and amende my <hi>Thoughtis,</hi> but not my <hi>Wordes:</hi>
Then the <hi>Jewe</hi> ſayd, I have mervayll of them that <hi>ſaye</hi>
thinges <hi>prejudicial,</hi> where <hi>Silence</hi> were more
<hi>prouffitable:</hi> And the <hi>Saraſyn</hi> ſayd, I am
<hi>Mayſter</hi> over my Wordes, or it be pronounced; but when it is
ſpoken, I am <hi>Servaunt</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. And it was asked one of them; Who
might be called a <hi>Kyng?</hi> And he anſwerd, He that is not
<hi>ſubgett</hi> to his owne Will.</q>
               </p>
               <p>At the end of the Tranſlation of this Work, there is a
remarkable Chapter added of three Leaves (which concludes the whole Volume) by
<hi>William Caxton,</hi> or in his Name: For, as it contains a Tranſlation
from the <hi>French,</hi> of thoſe Sarcaſms of <hi>Socrates,</hi> againſt
the female Sex, which our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Tranſlator of the reſt, had purpoſely
paſs'd over, in the proper Place, under the Chapter of that Philoſopher;
the Reader is left to judge, if the ſaid Earl ſeriouſly intended to 
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0570200100:91"/> favour the Fair, by ſuch an Omiſſion, in the middle
of his Book, whether his Printer would probably make ſo free as to publiſh
it, of his own accord, tho' in his own Name, more conſpicuouſly at the end
of it. If it is a piece of <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> it is artfully enough
conducted, to expoſe them more notoriouſly, under the Notion of forbearing
to do it at all. We never read that the Caſe has been ſo interpreted, nor
can ſay, in what Vein or Air Maiſter <hi>Caxton</hi>'s Apology for the
ſaid Addition was written, or is to be read; but there are in it the
following Expreſſions. 
<q rend="inline">"I <hi>fynde</hi> that my ſaide Lord hath left

hath unto <hi>alle Ladyes</hi> and Gentylwomen, he thought that
<hi>Socrates</hi> ſpared the Sothe, and wrote of Women more than Trouthe. For
if he had made fawte in wryting of Women, he ought not, ne ſhold not be

knoweth veryly, that ſuche Defautes ben not had ne founden in the Women born

having ſpoken much in Commendation of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and having a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
the reſt diligently read the four Volumes of Sir <hi>John Froiſſart,</hi>
he judg'd them neceſſary and proper to be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd into
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> ſince they treat of <hi>the famous Acts done in our
Parts,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ſpecially redound to the Honour of</hi>
Engliſhmen; which Chronicle begins at the Reign of K. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> III.
and continues to the beginning of K. <hi>Henry</hi> IV. containing the Space of
threeſcore and fourteen Years, that is from 1326 to 1400. He then beſpeaks
the favourable Reception of his Labour as to his not following his Author word
for word, ſince he truſts that he has kept to the true Sentence (or
Senſe) of the Matter, and for naming all Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Countries, Cities,
Towns, Rivers, or Fields, as he found them in <hi>French.</hi> And tho' he has
not given every Lord, Knight, or 'Squire his true Addition, yet truſts he 
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0570200100:94"/> has not ſwerved from the true Sentence of the Matter.
And where he has named the Diſtance between Places, by Miles and Leagues,
they muſt be underſtood according to the Cuſtom of the Countries where
they are named, being in ſome Places longer than in others. This is the
Senſe of his ſaid Preface; after which follows</p>
               <p>The <hi>Prologue</hi> of Sir <hi>John Froiſſart</hi>; which is
the firſt Chapter. Herein we are inform'd, That he propoſes to take his
Foundation out of the true Chronicles, compiled by that Right Reverend,
diſcreet and ſage Maſter <hi>John le Bel,</hi> ſometime Canon in St.
<hi>Lambert</hi>'s of <hi>Liege,</hi> who with great Diligence, Charge and
Coſt, through the Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Intelligence he received from Sir
<hi>John</hi> of <hi>Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nault,</hi> continued it all his Days. Further, That
our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>Froiſſart</hi> always inclining to theſe Studies,
frequented the Company of divers Noble and Great Lords, as well in <hi>France,
England,</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> as other Countries, and had Knowledge from
them of the Adventures that befel, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſince the great Battle of
<hi>Poitiers,</hi> where King <hi>John</hi> of <hi>France</hi> was taken
Priſoner, before which time he was but young: Yet took upon him as ſoon as
he came from School, to write and recite the ſaid Book, and bare the ſame
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled into <hi>England,</hi> and preſented the Volume to
<hi>Philippa</hi> of <hi>Haynault,</hi> the Queen of <hi>England,</hi> who
received it to his great Profit and Advancement. But becauſe the ſame Book
might not be ſufficiently correct, he enterpriſed this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory on the
aforeſaid Ordynance and true Foundation, at the Inſtance and Requeſt of a
dear Lord of his, Sir <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Namure,</hi> Knight, Lord of
<hi>Beaufort.</hi> And this is the Subſtance at his <hi>Prologue</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <p>Further of this Author, Sir JOHN FROISSART, and his CHRONICLE,
we have taken the pains to give our Reader the following more perfect Account,
chiefly from his own Words, than has hitherto been drawn together by any other
Writer.</p> 
                     <p>He was born at <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> as himſelf tells us,
Vol. II. (of this Edition) fol. 29. and in the Year 1337, as we gather alſo
from his own Words. For he came firſt over into <hi>England</hi> when
<hi>Edward</hi> Prince of <hi>Wales</hi> and his Princeſs were going to their
Government of <hi>Aquitain,</hi> Vol. II. fol. 319. b. Which by his own Account
(in the <hi>French</hi> Copies) was in 1361 (but accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Tranſlation, Vol. II. fol. 305. the Year fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing) being
then aged 24 Years. The Intereſt thro' which he came recommended to the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Court, and his laudable Undertaking to enlarge and continue
<hi>John le Bel</hi>'s Hiſtory, chiefly, of the <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Conqueſts in <hi>France,</hi> ſoon brought him into familiar Converſation
with Perſons of the greateſt Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He was made one of the Clerks
of the Chamber to Queen <hi>Philippa,</hi> Wife of King <hi>Edward</hi> III. as
he tells us himſelf; was afterwards knighted; and, being an Eccleſiaſtic,
well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficed in the Church. After he had been here about five Years, in
which Time he had travell'd almoſt all over <hi>Scotland,</hi> and was well
known in King <hi>David</hi>'s Court, Vol. II. fol. 158, 161. b. we meet with
him at <hi>Burdeaux,</hi> when the Prince of <hi>Wales</hi>'s Son, afterwards
King <hi>Richard</hi> II. was born there, <hi>Anno</hi> 1366. He intended to
have waited on the Prince in his Expedition to <hi>Spain,</hi> but was ſent
back by him to continue his Attendance on the Queen his Mother, Vol. II. Cap.
200. He ſeems to have ſtaid not above two Years in <hi>England,</hi> before
he left this Kingdom for a long Time, being abſent about <hi>Twenty Eight
Years.</hi> In which ſpace he probably obtained his Eccleſiaſtical
Preferments abroad, being Canon and Treaſurer of <hi>Chimay</hi> in
<hi>Heynault,</hi> and of <hi>Liſle</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> alſo
Chaplain to <hi>Guy</hi> of <hi>Caſtellon,</hi> Earl of <hi>Blois,</hi> as he
mentions, Vol. II. fol 242. And Rector of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcines</hi> on the Mount,
near <hi>Mons</hi> in <hi>Heynault,</hi> according to <hi>Le Laboureur's
Introd. a L'Hiſt. de Cha.</hi> VI. p. 69. In all this Time he continu'd his
<hi>Chronicle,</hi> from the Reports of the moſt credible and intelligent
Perſons, he met with in every Prince's Court to which he remov'd, and he
ſeems to have given Copies of the ſeveral Parts as he finiſh'd them, to
his Patrons; for many Quires thereof finely illuminated, were in the Cuſtody
of <hi>Louis</hi> Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> in 1381, intended by the Author to be
ſent to the King of <hi>England. Le Laboureur Hiſt. de Cha.</hi> VI. <hi>en
la Vie de Louis Duc d' Anjou.</hi> But our Author admires none of thoſe
Courts, ſo much as that of <hi>Gaſton</hi> Earl of <hi>Foix,</hi> at
<hi>Ortaiſe</hi> in <hi>Bearn,</hi> which was the grandeſt Market in
<hi>Europe</hi> for Tydings or News, eſpecially of all Martial Adventures.
Here he was courteouſly entertain'd in 1388, for twelve Weeks, and to that
Earl he preſented his Collection of <hi>Wenceſlaus</hi> of
<hi>Bohemia,</hi> Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi>'s Book, called <hi>Meliader</hi>
or Songs, Ballads, Ron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux and Virelays, which that Duke had compoſed, Vol.
II. fol. 30. He returned not into <hi>England,</hi> till King <hi>Richard</hi>
was arrived from his Expedition in <hi>Ireland,</hi> ib. fol. 252, and the
Peace was concluded for four Years between <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>France,</hi> ib. fol. 251. b. which was in 1396; when he deliver'd Letters
of Recommendation to the ſaid King, from the Earl of <hi>Heynault</hi> and
other Foreign Nobles; and was welcom'd by his Majeſty, <hi>As one who had
been, and is of the Engliſh Court,</hi> ib. fol. 252. b. Then he preſented
the King with a Book, fairly illuminated, which he had engroſſed, and bound
in Crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon Velvet, with Silver Buttons and Claſps gilt, and golden
Roſes, containing all the Matters of <hi>Amours</hi> and <hi>Moralities,</hi>
which in Four and Twenty Years before, he had compiled, ib. fol. 255. b. &amp;
251. b. One Copy of this Book, finiſh'd two Years before, <hi>Paſquier</hi>
ſaw in the Royal Library at <hi>Fontainbleau,</hi> as Monſieur
<hi>Bayle</hi> has remark'd. He continued moving about with the Court,
ſometimes to <hi>Eltham, Kingſton,
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>hene, Windſor,</hi> &amp;c. ib.
fol. 258. And was in this Court more than a Quarter of a Year together; and the
King received him kindly, becauſe he was Clerk and Servant in his Youth to
King <hi>Edward</hi> and his Queen. And when he departed out of
<hi>England,</hi> which ſeems to be the ſame Year, King <hi>Richard</hi>
ſent him a Goblet of Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gilt, and in it a Hundred Nobles, ib. fol. 319.
We may preſume he ended his Life when he left off his Chronicle, from his
expreſſing himſelf, upon the Delight he conceived in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templating the
Merits of his Subject, in theſe Words. 
<q rend="inline">"The which excellent Matter, as long as I
live, by the help of God, I ſhall continue; for the more I follow and labour
it, the more it pleaſeth me."</q> Thus much of the <hi>Hiſtorian</hi>; as
to his <hi>Tranſlator,</hi> with his other Writings and Actions, we refer to
them in <hi>Bale, Dugdale</hi>'s Baronage, and <hi>Wood</hi>'s <hi>Athen.
Oxon.</hi> Now a Word or two of the <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and we have done.</p> 
                     <p>And firſt we obſerve, That though the whole
<hi>Chronicle</hi> from the beginning of King <hi>Edward</hi> III. to King
<hi>Henry</hi> IV. paſſes currently under the Name of Sir <hi>John
Froiſſart;</hi> yet that there is a fine old MSS of it in <hi>England,</hi>
beautifully illuminated with Hiſtorical Figures, particularly of Sir <hi>John
Froiſſart,</hi> preſenting his Book to the Kings of <hi>England,
France,</hi> &amp;c. which, in the very Title, diſtinguiſhes the Work to
have been begun by <hi>John le Bel,</hi> and continued to the Battle of
<hi>Poictou,</hi> and that then after his Death, it was compiled and finiſhed
by the Venerable Sir <hi>John Froiſſart,</hi> which is agreeable to what he
ſays in his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face. So that though <hi>Froiſſart</hi> might here and
there correct or augment that firſt Part, as he alſo intimates; yet what he
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed begins but at the Year 1356. This Obſervation, with that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove
from his own Words, of his not coming ſo early into <hi>England,</hi> as
ſome have ſuggeſted, who wou'd from his Authority advance the Order of
the Garter up to the Year 1344, may clear him from diſagreeing with our
Authentic Records, and antedating the Inſtitution five Years, as Mr.
<hi>Aſhmole</hi> has objected; the Error, if any there is in the ſaid
Account, being more probably <hi>John le Bel</hi>'s, and, perhaps, the
Printer's rather than his. But here that we are ſpeaking of MSS, we muſt
not forget one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong thoſe of <hi>Iſaac Voſſius,</hi> Canon of
<hi>Windſor,</hi> entitled, <hi>L'Hiſ toire de Froiſſart, plus ample,
&amp; plus correcte que les Imprimez,</hi> 2 Vol. Folio. From theſe, or
others ſtill preſerved both in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> it has
been long and much deſir'd, that we might have a more accurate Edition in
<hi>French,</hi> or Tranſlation in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> than we have yet had.
'Tis true, the Author him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf might not be always exact in the naming of
ſo many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Places as he has introduced; ſeeing he received his
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence from ſuch Variety of Informers, in ſuch diſtant Parts, and
ſo much from the <hi>Speech</hi> rather than the <hi>Writings</hi> of Men:
Yet ſurely his Copies owe little Correction to the Preſs, having undergone
the ſame Corruptions, which Books ſo much treating of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Affairs, have uſually ſuffer'd by being printed in <hi>France,</hi>
eſpecially in the <hi>Names</hi> of Families, Towns and Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips: And Mr.
<hi>Selden</hi> has obſerved in his <hi>Tit.</hi> of <hi>Hon.</hi> p. 635.
That the <hi>Numerals</hi> in <hi>Froiſſart</hi> are alſo lamentably
corrupted and miſprinted. Yet whoever will have the Patience to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his
Work, ſays Mr. <hi>Anſtis, Ord.</hi> of the <hi>Gart.</hi> Vol. II. p. 98.
with the Coaevous Records publiſh'd by Mr. <hi>Rymer,</hi> will from that
Eſſay only, be ſo far ſatisfied of his Integrity, as may induce him
paſſionately to wiſh for a New Correct Edition: And if this Author has
not hitherto received the Honour of being printed at the <hi>Louvre</hi> with
ſome other Hiſtorians, according to the Propoſal of the learned
Monſieur <hi>du Freſne,</hi> in <hi>Le Long, Bibl. Hiſt.</hi> p. 235.
upon the National Motive of praiſing his own Country too little, and ours too
much, ſee <hi>La Popeliniere, Hiſt. des Hiſt.</hi> lib. 8. and <hi>Bodin
Meth. Hiſt.</hi> c. 4. Theſe Reaſons, with the extraordinary Dearneſs
of the printed Copies, ſhould excite ſome learned Perſon of this Kingdom,
for the Reputation of our own Country, to collate the MS Copies, compare the
Facts with Records, and contemporary Writers, and correct the miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Miſ-ſpellings, in the ſeveral Impreſſions, of their Surnames, who
abundantly ſignaliz'd their Valour, in Juſtice to the Merits of theſe
celebrated Perſons, and in Honour to their Poſterity. The moſt Ancient of
theſe <hi>Impreſſions</hi> in <hi>French,</hi> ſeems to be that printed
by <hi>Ant. Verard</hi> a Bookſeller of <hi>Paris, Folio,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Date.
The next was that printed alſo at <hi>Paris</hi> by three ſeveral
Perſons, that is, The firſt Volume by <hi>Fra. Regnauld,</hi> the ſecond
and third by <hi>Michael le Noir,</hi> 1505. The fourth by <hi>John Petit,</hi>
1518. The Copy of which Edition, now before us, bound in Two Tomes, Folio, has
the Arms of many of the Nobility, mentioned therein, drawn with a Pen in the
Margin. There was another Impreſſion at <hi>Paris,</hi> by <hi>Ant.
Couteau,</hi> alſo bound in Two Volumes Fol. 1530. This was that chiefly
uſed by <hi>Denis Sauvage,</hi> Hiſtoriographer to King <hi>Henry</hi> II.
of <hi>France,</hi> in the Edition he reviſed and corrected from many Copies
and Abridgments; which was printed at <hi>Lyons,</hi> by <hi>John de
Tournes,</hi> Fol. 1559. and again, at <hi>Paris,</hi> in <hi>Folio</hi> 1574.
with Marginal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, and Annotations at the End of every Book. He finds
fault with the preceding Editors, ſeveral Parts of whom he may have rightly
corrected, but is himſelf liable in many Places to Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection;
notwithſtanding he has been ſo preferr'd, that a Copy of his Edition, has
been ſometimes ſold in <hi>England</hi> for <hi>Ten Guineas.</hi> We cou'd
wiſh that moſt of the Errors in theſe <hi>French</hi> Editions, were as
truly corrected in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> one, as Biſhop <hi>Nicholſon</hi>
imagin'd they were. In three of the Editions we have ſeen, neither the Books
nor the Chapters are divided alike; ſo that it is very tedious and
confuſing to find, in one of them, the References of the other. Though
<hi>Froiſſart</hi>'s Method is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what diffuſe and interrupted, yet
the Epitome we have of him in Print, is ſcarce worth mentioning, however
drawn up by <hi>Slei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan,</hi> ſuch a Skeleton he has made of it, 12<hi rend="sup">o</hi>
                        <hi>Franc.</hi> 1584, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and with ſuch Partiality, to the
prejudice of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> has he ſo diminiſh'd it; according to
the Cenſure of our Learned <hi>Humphrey Lhuid in Comment. Brit.
Deſcrip.</hi> fol. 27. And yet it has been tranſlated into
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> by <hi>P. Golding,</hi> and printed in a Quarto Pamphlet
1608. But, we ſhall now leave it, with our Wiſhes of better Treatment, in
the Character and Recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of <hi>Montaigne</hi>; who, in his
<hi>Eſſay upon Books,</hi> deſcribing the <hi>Sincere Hiſtorian,</hi>
who has nothing of his own intermix'd, but only diligently collects and
impartially records all Things without Choice or Prejudice, leaving intirely to
his Reader's Judgment the diſtinguiſhment of Truth, ſays, 
<q rend="inline">"Such, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, was honeſt
<hi>Froiſſart</hi>; who has proceeded, in his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking, with ſo frank
a Plainneſs, that having committed an Error, he is not aſhamed to confeſs
and correct it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever it has been pointed out; and who repreſents to

Votaries,</hi> was <hi>Collected</hi> by our Author <hi>John Bale,</hi> in the
Year 1546, and the Second Part, in 1550, as appears in his Concluſions of

fair and perfect one: becauſe, in the Edition printed on a larger Black
Letter, by <hi>John Tyſdale, Anno</hi> 1560, which was after that King's
Death; we find ſuch a Dedication of <hi>Bale</hi>'s to his ſaid Majeſty,
and alſo becauſe we ſee, at the End of the Epiſtle to the Second Part,
even of the firſt Edition, there is a Wooden Print of our Author,
preſenting his Book to the ſaid King <hi>Edward.</hi> In this Dedication we
obſerve, that <hi>Bale</hi> deſign'd to publiſh Two Parts more of theſe

deduced the ſaid Collections down to his own Time: For his Words to the King
diſplaying the Scheme of the whole, by ſhewing what theſe two Parts
already publiſh'd do, and what thoſe to be publiſh'd were to treat of,
are as follows. 
<q rend="inline">"How the great Adverſary of God,
Antichriſt, hath ſens Chriſtes Aſcention, wrought in his wicked
Courſe, to deprave theſe two Miniſtrations (the Explanation of God's
Word, and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the People) and to cauſe them to ſerve his moſte
blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous and filthy Affectes; the <hi>Firſt Two Partes</hi> of my

hope is, that the <hi>Two Lattre Partes</hi> which will, God wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, moſt
ſpedily follow, ſhal declare it yet much more at large. I have therein
decreed, for difference of the Bookes; and apt Arguments of the Matters
contained in them, to give them Four ſeveral Titles; of <hi>Riſing,
Building, Holding</hi> and <hi>Falling.</hi> For the <hi>Firſt</hi> Part

The <hi>Third</hi> Part will declare the crafty upholding of their proud
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and Poſſeſſions, by the wily and ſubtil ſlaightes of the
Four Orders of Friers: And the <hi>Fourth</hi> Part ſhall manifeſt their
horrible Fall in this latter Age, by the grounded Doctrines of the true

<hi>by</hi> John Charlewood. Quarto, 1586.</bibl>
               </head>
               <p>THE Author of this very ſcarce Pamphlet, conſiſting of five
Sheets and a half, <hi>dedicates</hi> it to <hi>Edward Suliard</hi>
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> whoſe Sons were under his Tuition, and who had been
preſented by him with ſome other Work before, which was a Tranſlation of
ſome Poetry belike, from, or into <hi>Latin.</hi> In his <hi>Preface,</hi> To
the <hi>Noble Poets of England,</hi> he obſerves, that tho' <hi>Books</hi>
of, or tending to Poetry were, then, more numerous than any other
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Books, yet that 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>Poetry</hi> has found feweſt Friends to
amend it; thoſe who can, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving their Skill to themſelves; thoſe
who cannot, run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning headlong upon it; thinking to garniſh it with their
Deviſes, but more corrupting it with fantaſtical Errors."</q> Therefore the
chief end of his Writing this <hi>Diſcourſe</hi> is, to propoſe a
<hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poetry, 
<q rend="inline">"by having ſome perfect Platform, or
<hi>Proſodia</hi> of <hi>verſifying</hi> ratified; either in Imitation of
the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> or, where it would not well abide the
touch of their Rules, thro' the like Obſervations, ſelected and
eſtabliſh'd by the natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectation of the Speech<note n="*" place="bottom">But this Project, tho' we find it was propoſed and attempted by

our Author has given in it, of the antient, and more eſpecially the
<hi>Engliſh Poets,</hi> from <hi>Chaucer</hi> and <hi>Gower,</hi> down to the
moſt conſiderable of thoſe who flouriſh'd at the Time of this

                  <pb n="87" facs="tcp:0570200100:114"/>In the <hi>Diſcourſe,</hi> having
ſpoken in general of Poetry, what it is, whence it had its beginning, and in
what eſteem it has always been, according to <hi>Plato, Ariſtotle,</hi> and
<hi>Spen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer</hi> in his <hi>Shepherd's Calendar,</hi> which our Author
thinks in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior neither to <hi>Theocritus</hi> nor <hi>Virgil,</hi> and
therefore zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly wiſhes for his other Works abroad, eſpecially his
<hi>Engliſh Poet,</hi> which his Friend <hi>E. K.</hi> did once promiſe to
publiſh; he then ſhews the Opinion that was held of the Power of Poetry;
how <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Scipio</hi> were delighted with it. So proceeds
to enumerate the moſt memorable Poets among the Ancients, as <hi>Orpheus,
Amphion, Tyrtaeus, Homer, Ennius,</hi> and <hi>Empedocles</hi>; with the
<hi>Comic, Tragic,</hi> and <hi>Paſtoral</hi> Poets among the
<hi>Grecians</hi>; and in like manner the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets; more
particularly of <hi>Virgil</hi>; then of the <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grammatic, Elegiac,</hi>
and <hi>Hiſtorical</hi> Poets. Of <hi>Ovid, Horace,</hi> beſides many
others, and alſo, as not inferior to ſome of them, <hi>Palengenius,
Mantuan,</hi> and, for a ſingular Gift in a ſweet Heroical Verſe, matches
with them, <hi>Chriſtopher Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> the Author of our <hi>Anglorum
Praelia.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence he deſcends to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets: And here
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that he knows of no memorable Work written by any Poet in
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> till twenty Years paſt; tho' Learning was not generally
decay'd at any time, eſpecially ſince <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam the Conqueror</hi>; as
may appear by many famous Works written by Biſhops and others; yet that
Poetry was then in little Account, the Light of the old <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latin</hi> Poets which they had, being contemn'd by them, as appears by
their rude verſifying, wherein they thought nothing to be learnedly written
in Verſe, which fell not out in Rhyme, either by the middle Words of each
Verſe ſounding alike with the laſt, or every two Verſes ending with the
like Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The Original of which tinkling Verſe is aſcrib'd by Mr.
<hi>Aſcham</hi> to the <hi>Hunns</hi> and <hi>Goths.</hi> King <hi>Henry</hi>
I. ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd <hi>Beauclerk,</hi> is here next ſpoken of, his Name being a
Proof that Learning in this Country was not little eſteem'd of at that rude
Time; and that among other Studies it is probable ſuch a Prince would not
neglect the Faculty of Poetry. But the firſt of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poets
here mention'd is <hi>John Gower</hi> in the Time of King <hi>Richard</hi> II.
a ſingular well learned Man, whoſe Works our Author wiſhes were all 
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0570200100:115" rendition="simple:additions"/> whole and perfect among us, as containing much
deep Knowledge and Delight. <hi>Chaucer</hi> the God of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
Poets, next after, if not equal in Time, hath left many Works both for Delight
and profitable Knowledge, far exceeding any other that as yet, ever ſince his
Time, directed their Studies that way. Tho' his Stile may now ſeem blunt and
coarſe, yet in him may be ſeen the perfect Shape of a right Poet. By his
delightſome Vein he ſo gull'd the Ears of Men with his Devices, that tho'
Corruption bore ſuch a ſway that Learning and Truth could ſcarce ſhew
themſelves, yet without Controll might he gird at the Vices and Abuſes of
all States, and gall them with very ſharp and eager Inventions; which he did
ſo learnedly and pleaſantly, that none therefore would call him in
queſtion, <hi>&amp;c. Lydgate,</hi> for good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of his Verſe and
meetly current Stile, as the Time afforded, is by our Author thought ſurely
comparable with <hi>Chaucer,</hi> yet more occupied in ſuperſtitious and
odd Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters than was requiſite in ſo good a Wit; which though he handled
them commendably, yet the Matters themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not ſo commendable, his
Eſteem has been the leſs. The next of our antient Poets he ſuppoſes to
be <hi>Pierce Ploughman,</hi> who is ſomewhat harſh and obſcure, but
indeed a very pithy Writer, and the firſt our Author had ſeen who
obſerv'd the Quantity of our Verſe without the Curioſity of Rhyme. Then
he comes to <hi>Skelton</hi> in the Time of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. who as he
obtain'd the Laurel-Garland is, with good right, granted the Title of a Poet,
being a pleaſant conceited Fellow, and of a very ſharp Wit, exceeding bold,
and would nip to the very quick where he once ſet hold. After him is
mention'd Maſter <hi>George Gaskoyne,</hi> as painful a Soldier in the
Affairs of his Prince and Country as he was a witty Poet in his Writing; in
whoſe farther Commendation, he cites the Words of <hi>E. K.</hi> upon the
ninth <hi>Eclogue</hi> of the <hi>new Poet.</hi> Here he paſſes over
divers, as the old Earl of <hi>Surrey,</hi> the Lord <hi>Vaux, Norton,
Briſtow, Edwards, Tuſſer, Churchyard, W. Hunnis, Haiwood, Sand, Hyll, S.
Y. M. D.</hi> becauſe they would make his Diſcourſe too tedious. But
obſerves, that the Earl of <hi>Oxford</hi> may challenge to himſelf the
Title of the moſt excellent, among the reſt of the Lords and Gentlemen in
her Majeſty's Court. Hence he proceeds to the Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators; among whom he
ſhall ever account Dr. <hi>Phaer</hi> the beſt, for his <hi>Virgil,</hi> as
far as half the tenth Book of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neids,</hi> the reſt being no leſs
commendably finiſh'd by that worthy Scholar and famous Phyſician <hi>T.
Twyne:</hi> Equal with <pb n="89" facs="tcp:0570200100:116" rendition="simple:additions"/> him he joins <hi>Arthur
Golding,</hi> for his Labour in <hi>Ovid's Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſes,</hi> who, for his
further profiting this Nation and Speech in all good Learning, is here greatly
extoll'd. The next Place is given to <hi>Barnaby Googe,</hi> beſides his own
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, for his Tranſlation of <hi>Palengenius his Zodiac</hi>; and
he is follow'd by <hi>Abraham Flemming,</hi> with whom he would join another of
his Name, who had excell'd as well in all kinds of Learning as in Poetry
eſpecially, were his Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made publick. Here he apologizes for not
being par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular on the Tranſlators of <hi>Seneca, Ovid, Horace,
Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuan,</hi> and many others; alſo the Students of the Univerſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and
Inns of Court, becauſe he has not ſeen all he has heard of, nor dwells in a
Place where he can eaſily get knowledge of their Works. One however he may
not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ſlip, and that is Maſter <hi>George Whetſtone,</hi> a Man
ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly well skill'd in this Faculty of Poetry. To him is join'd
<hi>Anthony Munday,</hi> an earneſt Traveller in this Art, in whoſe Name
our Author had ſeen very excellent Works, eſpecially upon Nymphs and
Shepherds, well worthy to be view'd, and to be eſteem'd as very rare Poetry.
With theſe he places <hi>John Graunge, Knyght, Wylmot, Darrel, F. C. F.
K.</hi> and <hi>G. B.</hi> But here, has reſerv'd a Place purpoſely for
one, who if not only, yet principally deſerves the Title of the righteſt
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Poet that ever our Author read, that is, the Author of the
<hi>Shepherd's Kalendar.</hi> And finds none fit to couple with him, unleſs
<hi>Gabriel Harvey,</hi> for his much admir'd <hi>Latin</hi> Poetry, his
Reformation of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſe, and beautifying the ſame with
brave Devices, tho' chiefly hidden in hateful Obſcurity, and the Author long
ſince occupied in graver Studies. And if he were to join <hi>Harvey</hi>'s
two Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the one a Divine, the other a Phyſician, is aſſur'd, they
would much adorn the Art, if they would ſet their hands to it.</p>
               <p>After his Judgment of the <hi>Poets,</hi> he ſpeaks of the
<hi>Engliſh Poetry</hi> in its Matter and Form; what <hi>Verſe</hi> is, the
Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of primitive Poetry, the Comic, Tragic, and Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric; the Uſe
and End of Poetry from the Teſtimony of <hi>Horace.</hi> With his Advice, of
letting things, feign'd for Pleaſure, nearly reſemble Truth, how duely
obſerv'd by <hi>Chaucer.</hi> Others of <hi>Horace</hi> his Rules, with the
Tranſlation of Sir <hi>Thomas Elyot</hi> of Reading laſcivious Poems, and
what good Leſſons ſome Readers will pick out of the worſt of them.
Examples to this purpoſe, from <hi>Plautus, Terence, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> and
<hi>Martial,</hi> by Sir <hi>T. Elyot.</hi> Of Heroic Poetry, and 
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0570200100:117" rendition="simple:additions"/> that we have nothing anſwerable to
<hi>Homer</hi> and <hi>Virgil,</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to our not having had a timely
regard to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Speech, and curious handling of our Verſe,
tho' now it has had great Advantages of Eloquence from ſome rare and
ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Wits; among whom, that Maſter <hi>John Lilly</hi> has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
moſt high Commendations, as one who has ſtep'd further therein than any
before, or ſince he firſt began the witty Diſcourſe of his
<hi>Euphues.</hi> Whoſe Works ſurely in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his ſingular
Eloquence, and brave Compoſition of apt Words and Sentences, let the learned
examine and make Trial thereof thro' all the Parts of Rhetoric in fit
Phraſes, in pithy Sentences, in gallant Tropes, in flowing Speech, in plain
Senſe; and ſurely, in my Judgment, I think he will yield him that Verdict
which <hi>Quintilian</hi> gives of both the beſt Orators,
<hi>Demoſthenes</hi> and <hi>Tully:</hi> That from the one nothing may be
taken away; to the other, nothing may be added: But for a cloſer Example, to
prove a former Aſſertion, of the Fitneſs of our Language to receive the
beſt Form of Poetry, we are referr'd to the Examination of Dr.
<hi>Phaer</hi>'s Tranſlation of <hi>Virgil</hi> with the Original, from both
which, here are ſeveral Examples laid before us, and our Critick thinks, that
the like Inference might be drawn from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon of <hi>Ovid</hi>'s
<hi>Metamorphoſis,</hi> with <hi>Golding</hi>'s Tranſlation.</p>
               <p>Next our Author treats more particularly of the Paſtoral Poetry
or Eclogue: Here having ſpoken of <hi>Theocritus, Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gil,</hi> and others,
he comes to one of our own Country, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable with the beſt in any
Reſpect, even Maſter <hi>Spenſer,</hi> Author of the <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s
<hi>Calendar,</hi> who wou'd, he thinks, have ſurpaſſed them, if the
Coarſeneſs of our Speech (that is, the Courſe of Cuſtom which he wou'd
not infringe) had been no greater Impediment to him, than their pure Native
Tongues were to them. Here we have a little Compariſon between
<hi>Virgil</hi>'s Eclogues and <hi>Spenſer</hi>'s, and the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of
<hi>E. K.</hi> upon the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poet. The ſubject Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and
uſe of his ſaid Calendar, and our Author's Apology for what had been
objected againſt ſomething in his ſixth Eclogue, ſhewing it is the
fooliſh Conſtruction, and not his Writing that is blameable. To theſe
Writers of Paſtorals, are join'd thoſe who wrote Precepts of Husbandry in
Verſe, after the manner of <hi>Virgil</hi>'s <hi>Georgics</hi>; ſuch as
that Book <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f <hi>Tuſſer,</hi> a
Piece ſurely, ſays he, of great Wit and Experience, and withal very
prettily handled. And he thinks that this Argument has been ſo little treated
of in Poetry, becauſe ſo many have written of it in Proſe. As for a
Tranſlation of <pb n="91" facs="tcp:0570200100:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> the <hi>Georgics,</hi> it appears
that <hi>Abr. Flemming</hi> in his Verſion of the Eclogues, did make ſome
Promiſe thereof, and that our Author <hi>Webbe</hi> did perform the like; but
it ſeems not that either of their Works were printed. Thence, from the
Subject of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writers, he paſſes to the Form and Manner
of our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſe; cenſures our barbarous prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of
Rhyming; what is underſtood by Rhyme, and how improperly that Word is
apply'd. The firſt beginning of Rhyme. Rules to be obſerved in framing our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Rhyme. Next we come to the ſeveral kinds of
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſe, differing in Number of Syllables, where 'tis
obſerv'd the longeſt Verſe in length, our Author has ſeen uſed in
<hi>Engliſh,</hi> conſiſts of ſixteen Syllables, not much uſed, and
commonly divided, each Verſe equally into two, rhiming alternately. The next
in length is of fourteen Syllables, the moſt uſual of all others, among
Tranſlators of the <hi>Latin</hi> Poets, which alſo often is divided into
two Lines; the firſt of eight Syllables, the ſecond of ſix, whereof the
ſixes always rhime, and ſometimes the others. But to avoid Tediouſneſs
and Confuſion, repeats only the different ſorts of Verſes in the
<hi>Shepherd</hi>'s <hi>Calendar,</hi> which contains twelve or thirteen
ſeveral ſorts, differing in Length, or Rhime, or Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the
Staves. After theſe Examples we have ſome Remarks, on the natural Order of
Words, or <hi>Poſition</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Poetry, and that the
quantity of our old Verſe of fourteen Syllables, runs much upon the
<hi>Iambic:</hi> With further Obſervations upon Rhime. <hi>Gaskoyne</hi>'s
Inſtructions for verſifying. Of ſome rare Devices and pretty Inventions
in Compoſition, as in the Song of <hi>Colin,</hi> ſung by <hi>Cuddy</hi> in
the <hi>Shepherd</hi>'s <hi>Calendar,</hi> framed upon ſix Words, prettily
turn'd and wound up together. Not unlike <hi>John Graunge</hi>'s Device of
making the laſt Words of a certain Number of Verſes fall into Senſe: And
that there were ſeveral delicate Performances in this Nature of
<hi>Echoes,</hi> privately paſſing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the fineſt Poets of our
Author's Time. We have ſomething alſo after the manner of the Acroſtic,
from the Compoſitions of <hi>W. Hunnis.</hi> Then he proceeds to the
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed kind of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſe, in Imitation of the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins,</hi> which many had attempted to put in
Practice, and this Part takes up three Leaves, in which among other Things, he
obſerves the Hexameter to be the moſt famous Verſe; and that the firſt
who attempted to practiſe it in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was the Earl of
<hi>Surrey,</hi> who tranſlated ſome part of <hi>Virgil</hi> into Verſe;
but without regard of true quantity of <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0570200100:119" rendition="simple:additions"/> Syllables.
Here he repeats the famous Diſtich in <hi>Hexame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> common in the
mouths of all Men, which was made by Maſter <hi>Watſon,</hi> Fellow of St.
<hi>John</hi>'s College in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> about forty Years paſt; and
two more in the Gloſs of <hi>E. K.</hi> upon the fifth Eclogue of the new
Poet: That the great Number of the like kind made by Mr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> were
not unknown to any, and his own Tranſlation of the two firſt Eclogues of
<hi>Virgil</hi> in the like ſort of Verſe, is by our Author here exhibited.
After which Examples in <hi>Hexameter,</hi> he comes to the <hi>Elegiac</hi>
Verſe with Examples, and laſtly, in like manner of the <hi>Sapphic,</hi>
with an Example thereof in his Verſion, from the fourth <hi>Eclogue</hi> in
the <hi>Shep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd</hi>'s <hi>Calendar,</hi> of <hi>Colin</hi>'s Song, ſung by
<hi>Hobbinol</hi> in praiſe of the Queen. To the whole is annexed, The
<hi>Canons</hi> or <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Cautions of Poetry,</hi> preſcribed by
<hi>Horace,</hi> firſt gather'd by <hi>Geo. Fabricius Cremnicenſis</hi>;
and at the End, a ſhort <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue,</hi> in which for the rendering our
Poetry equal with the beſt in other Tongues, he gives us hopes of framing
ſome apt <hi>Engliſh Proſodia</hi>; but hopes firſt to enjoy the
Benefit of ſome others Judgment, whoſe Authority may bear greater Credit,
and whoſe Learning can better perform it.</p>

               <p>THIS little Work was written in Anſwer to a Treatiſe newly
publiſhed, entitled <hi>Free Trade, or the Means to make Trade
flouriſh;</hi> wherein, its Author had omitted to han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle the predominant
part, namely, the Myſtery of <hi>Exchange</hi> between us and other Nations;
his only Scope being to have the Moneys of the Kingdom enhanced in Price, and
the Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Coins, inconveniently, made current in the Realm at high Rates:
And becauſe the ſaid Treatiſe was publiſh'd at the Time when King
<hi>James</hi> had referr'd the conſideration of this important Buſineſs
to <hi>Henry</hi> Viſcount <hi>Mandeville,</hi> Lord Preſident of the Privy
Council, with others of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Experience, among whom, our preſent
Author Mr. <hi>Malynes</hi> was call'd, and did certify his Opinion; he,
therefore, dedicates this <hi>Anſwer</hi> to his Majeſty.</p>
               <p>In his ſaid Dedication, he lays down, <hi>Traffic</hi> to be the
<hi>Preheminent Study of Princes,</hi> becauſe the Sacred Wiſdom has
approved this <hi>Axiom:</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"That a <hi>King</hi> is miſerable, how
<hi>rich</hi> ſoever he be, if he reigns over a <hi>poor</hi> People; and
that a <hi>Kingdom</hi> is not able to ſubſiſt, how rich ſoever the
<hi>People</hi> be, if the <hi>King</hi> be not able to maintain his
Eſtate."</q> He concludes with obſerving that, <hi>Worthy</hi> of
Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are thoſe, who can, by Providence, <hi>preſerve</hi> the
Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Kings and Commonwealths; <hi>worthier</hi> are thoſe, who
both, by honeſt and lawful Means, can <hi>preſerve</hi> and
<hi>augment</hi> them; but <hi>worthieſt</hi> of all Immortal Praiſe are
thoſe, who can, and do, by eaſy, juſt and politic Means, <hi>inrich</hi>
Kingdoms and Commonwealths, and thereby fill the Prince's Coffers with
ſtanding Treaſure, to ſerve in Time of War, when Arms are neceſſary,
and the Time of Peace, more fitting wholeſome Laws. 
<q rend="inline">"In the <hi>Theorick</hi> Part of which Study, I
have, ſays he, theſe forty Years ſpent much Time and Charges, at the
Pleaſure of Great Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages: <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0570200100:124"/> And albeit nothing did
encounter me but In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, yet my Conſtancy to ſpend the Remainder of
my Days therein, in hope of <hi>Practice,</hi> is as immoveable, as the
Continuance of my daily Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to multiply your Majeſty's

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The knowing and
ingenious Author of this ſcarce and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Tract, who thus ſpent Forty
Years in the Study of Means to enrich his Country by Traffic, was a Perſon of
ſuch conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Note for his Abilities, that he was often called to the
Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil Table, both in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, and King
<hi>James</hi>'s, for his Opinion in <hi>Mercantile</hi> Affairs. He was
appointed one of the <hi>Commiſſioners of Trade</hi> in the <hi>Low
Countries,</hi> for ſettling the Value of Monies about the Year 1586. He was
afterwards a Commiſſioner alſo at Home in the Year 1600, for
eſtabliſhing the true <hi>Par of Exchange</hi>; and upon the Laws, enacted
in the fourth Year of King <hi>James,</hi> for the making of good and true
Cloth, he exhibited a <hi>Demonſtration</hi> to the Lords of the Privy
Council, ſhewing the <hi>Weight, Length</hi> and <hi>Bredth</hi> of all
ſorts of <hi>Cloths</hi>; and that <hi>Weight</hi> and <hi>Meaſure</hi> do
controul each other; whereby the Merchant, who buys the Cloth, may be enabled
to find out the Fraud and Deceit of the Clothier: We find alſo that he
publiſh'd ſeveral other Books, beſides this above abſtracted; as, near
Thirty Years before it, <hi>The Canker of England's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi>; alſo
<hi>England's View</hi>; and that he now had under the Preſs, a Volume
entitled <hi>Lex Mercatoria,</hi> or <hi>The Ancient Law Merchant,</hi> wherein
the dangerous Rocks to be avoided in the Courſe of Traffic, and the Means
thereunto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing, are manifeſted, for the Preſervation and Augmentation
of the Wealth of theſe Kingdoms, according to <hi>Jus Gentium</hi>; the
Knowledge whereof is of ſuch Moment, that all other Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Laws, without
it are not complete. He writ alſo, <hi>The Royal Merchant of Great
Britain,</hi> which he had now in MS. and, perhaps, others, which we have not
leiſure at preſent to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire after.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In his preliminiary Diſcourſe, he diſtinguiſhes the
<hi>Three.</hi> Eſſential Parts of Traffic, namely, <hi>Commodities,
Money</hi> and <hi>Exchange,</hi> to be, the <hi>Firſt,</hi> as the
<hi>Body,</hi> which upheld the World by Commutation and Bartering, till Money
was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed; the <hi>Second,</hi> as the <hi>Soul</hi> in the Body,
infuſing Life to Traffic, by the Means of Equality and Equity; the
<hi>Third,</hi> as the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Faculty</hi> of the
<hi>Soul,</hi> being ſeated every where, corroborating the vital Spirit of
Traffic, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting or controlling, by juſt Proportions, the Prices and
Values of Commodites and Moneys. A little further, he <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0570200100:125"/>
tells an Ingenious Tale, which he applies to the Force of Exchange by
inferring, That the Author of the <hi>Treatiſe of Free Trade,</hi> is like
the Novices mention'd in that Tale, who perceiving two great Whales to have
aſſaulted the <hi>Engliſh Ship of Traffic</hi>; the one being the
<hi>Wars</hi> in <hi>Chriſtendome,</hi> and the Pirates, and the other, more
gentle, being the <hi>Policy</hi> of Princes and States, hath publiſh'd the
<hi>Cauſes</hi> of the <hi>Decay of Trade</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> and the
Means to make the ſame flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, without obſerving the operative Power
of <hi>Exchange,</hi> which is the <hi>Rudder</hi> of the <hi>Ship of
Traffic,</hi> faſtned to the <hi>Rule</hi> of the <hi>Equality</hi> of
<hi>Moneys,</hi> according to their Weight and Fineneſs.</p>
               <p>The Treatiſe itſelf containing many obſervable Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars
is divided into five Chapters; the <hi>Firſt</hi> whereof, is on, <hi>The
Cauſes of the want of Moneys in England.</hi> This Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter begins with
ſome Remarks on the Undervaluation of Money in Exchange, with an Inſtance
of the Value of <hi>Realls,</hi> and the <hi>Par of Exchange</hi>; when
<hi>Dudley</hi> Earl of <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter</hi> went Governour of the Low
Countries in 1586. Whence it is concluded, That, if the Low Exchange were not,
the Gain wou'd prove to be imaginary; that when the Exchange anſwers the true
Value of our Moneys, they are never exported, becauſe the <hi>Gain</hi> is
anſwered by Exchange, which is the Cauſe of Tranſportation; ſo that
Exchange is ſtill predominant, and ſtrikes the ſtroke; and tho' the Price
riſes and falls according to the plenty or ſcarcity of Money, yet Moneys
are over-ruled thereby: for if you enhance the Coin, the Exchange controlls it,
and riſes accordingly; if you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalue it, the Exchange in like manner
falls, to the end that the Value thereof ſhou'd be anſwer'd by the public
Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and to prevent all Abuſes in the Price of Commodities, and
Valuation of Moneys either Real or Imaginary, according to the Cuſtom of the
Place, by device of the Bankers. That this was ſeriouſly obſerved in
1576, by the Lord Keeper <hi>Bacon,</hi> Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burghley,</hi>
Secretary <hi>Walſingham,</hi> with other Counſellors of State, beſides
many Perſons of Experience, as Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham, Richard Martin,</hi>
Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of the Mint, and many more here named; who found that the Bankers or
Exchangers for their private Gain, had brought in Twenty Inconveniencies, which
are here parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culariz'd: By which it may be ſeen, ſays our Author, of what
Importance the Operation of Exchange is, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Endeavours of Sir
<hi>Thomas Greſham,</hi> thinking to rule the Exchange of <hi>England,</hi>
by plenty of Money, prov'd fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0570200100:126"/> which might have
been performed with more facility by Direction. Here we have Foreign Examples
from <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>din,</hi> of Bankers having their Goods confiſcated, and being
indicted as Cozeners, ſeeing that in a ſhort time with 24000 Pounds, they
had gotten 2400000. This is apply'd to the Kingdom of <hi>England,</hi> and in
what Caſe it wou'd have been more ſenſible of the like Loſs; ſince,
tho' Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Coffers were ſtored with ſeven hundred
thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Pounds Sterling, before the Wars with the Earl of <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rone</hi>
in <hi>Ireland,</hi> more than double that Sum had been ſpent therein.
<hi>The Second Cauſe of our Want of Money,</hi> is next imputed to the
ſuperfluity of <hi>Plate</hi> in private Hands. Under this Head, is
obſerved the great Quantity of Silver con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in Silver Thread, Spangles,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> upon late Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion found, to amount to above fourſcore
thouſands Pounds yearly; whereas the Plate made in <hi>London,</hi> is only
fifty or ſixty thouſand Pounds worth. Here we have the ſeveral Opinions
given to <hi>Charles</hi> IX. of <hi>France,</hi> upon his want of Money, after
the <hi>Pariſian</hi> Maſſacre; ſome, under colour of ſuppreſſing
Pride, adviſing him to preſcribe every Man what ſtore he ſhou'd keep,
and melt down the reſt. Others, that he wou'd imbaſe his Money under the
Standard of Plate, ſo bring Plate to be turn'd into Money. This is follow'd
by another Example, in our <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. who priviledg'd his Nobles to
make baſe Money of their own Plate, which fell
<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ut to the prejudice of the
Commonwealth, and was but a ſhift for the Time to himſelf. Then we have a
more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Account of Gold and Silver Thread, both as to what the Author
had recommended in his <hi>England</hi>'s <hi>View,</hi> about making it at
home, and the Reaſons why, by late Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, the Foreign Manufacture
thereof was encouraged. <hi>The Third Cauſe of our want of Money,</hi> is
aſcrib'd to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption of Foreign Commodities, or the buying them,
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably, dearer than we ſell our own, which he has proved (in his
<hi>Canker</hi> of <hi>England</hi>) to proceed from the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe of Exchange.
Here we have the Cauſes of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ballancing of Commodities, and the
Effects by which the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants are bereaved of two
eſſential Parts of Trade in three. And here we ſee the Advantages which
Foreign Trade has over ours, and how our Commodities are fallen in Price; that
<hi>French</hi> Wines are dearer to us, by the Money of the Realm's being
undervalued in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; and that the leſs Sterling Money we reckon in
Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change with them, the more is the gain of our Commodities. 
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0570200100:127"/> 
                  <hi>The Fourth Cauſe is the Want of Money,</hi>
(according to the <hi>Treatiſe</hi> our Author anſwers, for theſe
Cauſes he takes from thence) is the great Want of our <hi>Eaſt-India</hi>
Stock at home; but our Author expected the ready Money ſent in <hi>Reals</hi>
of Plate to be imploy'd in the ſaid Trade, wou'd rather have been mention'd,
not but he thinks this <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Trade, which began with us in
<hi>England,</hi> immediately after the great Jubilee Year 1600, might be very
profitable hereafter. He gives us an Inſtance in <hi>Pepper</hi>; which, if
it coſt but Two-pence half-penny the Pound in the <hi>Indies,</hi> and Ten
Shillings employ'd therein, will require but 35 Shillings for all Charges to
deliver it in <hi>London,</hi> where it is uſually ſold for above
Twenty-pence; it follows there muſt be great Gain, which will encreaſe when
the Parties ſhall be united in true Love: Whereas the Loſs we ſuffer by
the undervaluing of our Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in Exchange, yearly, is greater than all the
Moneys em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd yearly for the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi>; wherefore he is for
encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging this Trade, and the rather for that the <hi>Hollanders</hi> found
Reaſons, which are here produced, for continuing the ſame. Here we have
alſo ſome Obſervations upon our Riches, ſince the Diſcovery of the
<hi>Weſt-Indies. The Fifth Cauſe of our Want of Money,</hi> imputed to the
Wars of <hi>Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendom</hi> cauſing Exportation, and the <hi>Pirates</hi>
hindring Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Money, is next examin'd. Here our Author argues, that
if the <hi>Pirates</hi> did not take ſome of our Money, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not that
the ſame wou'd come to us in <hi>Specie</hi>; and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to the Exportation by Wars, he anſwers to the
Argument, that the <hi>Rix-Dollar</hi> being raiſed in many Places of
<hi>Germany,</hi> ſhou'd draw abundance of Money into the Mints of thoſe
Countries, that Money inhanced is never carried to the Mint, but runs away like
Poſt-horſes, every Man fearing to loſe by the Fall. We have here
ſeveral other Remarks upon theſe <hi>Dollar,</hi> and the Alterations of
their Value from the Year 1575; and the Chapter is concluded, with Advice to
note the Valuation of <hi>Hamborough,</hi> where it has been at fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-four
<hi>Stivers</hi> the Dollar, which makes the Exchange above forty Shillings of
their Money for Twenty of ours. 
<q rend="inline">"And tho' we have raiſed the Price of Exchange
from Twenty-four Shillings, Nine-pence, to about Thirty-five Shillings, ſhall
we reſt here and go no further? And ſhall we be like Men that halting in
Jeſt, become Lame in Earneſt?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Chap. II. <hi>Shews the Cauſes of the Decay of Trade in the
Merchandize of England,</hi> by an Examination alſo of ſeveral Heads in the
manner aforeſaid, as Firſt, <hi>The Want of Money.</hi> 
                  <pb n="101" facs="tcp:0570200100:128"/> Secondly, <hi>Extortionate Uſury.</hi> Thirdly,
<hi>Litigious Law-Suits.</hi> Fourthly, <hi>Free Fiſhery of Foreigners in his
Majeſty's Seas</hi>; with the Reaſons of our own Merchants in favour of
that Liberty, as if <hi>England</hi> cou'd not maintain a <hi>Sea</hi> and
<hi>Land Trade</hi> together; alſo ſeveral <hi>Examples,</hi> how other
Princes neglect not the Advantage to be made of their Seas, but both encourage
their own Subjects to fiſh in them, and make other Nations pay Duty for the
like: Which have long determin'd the queſtion of <hi>Mare Liberum,</hi>
allowing the <hi>Freedom of the Seas</hi> for <hi>Navigation,</hi> where it
does not prejudice the diſtinct <hi>Dominion</hi> of Princes concerning their
<hi>Fiſhery.</hi> Fifthly, <hi>The Abuſes of our Drapery.</hi> Here we have
a particular, that the dreſſing and dying of them, were inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted on to
be done in <hi>England</hi> in 1616, and that then 64 Thouſand Cloths were
exported; with a Digreſſion of our Author's upon the envious Interpretation
of his Studies for the welfare of the Kingdom, particularly in his Invention of
<hi>Farthing</hi> Tokens, which are yet found moſt commodious to prevent the
waſte of Silver, and relieve the Poor. Sixth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>The Policies of
Merchants in monopolizing the Exportation of Cloths.</hi> Seventhly, <hi>The
falſe making of our Cloth.</hi> And here we have the Inconveniences of
engroſſing in Trade further laid open. Eighthly, <hi>The Exportation of the
Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of Wool,</hi> and the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> or <hi>Impoſitions</hi>
laid upon Cloths at Home and Abroad. Ninthly, <hi>The Wars in Chriſtendom,
and Pirates,</hi> occaſioning the fall of Wool from 33 to 18 Shillings the
Tod, and the inconſiderate <hi>Barter</hi> of it Abroad. Tenthly, <hi>The
immoderate Uſe of Foreign Commodities,</hi> which concludes this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Chap. III. <hi>Of Governed Trade and therein of Monopoly.</hi>
Here we have ſome further curious Obſervations upon the <hi>Exchange</hi>
of Money, and among others the Proverbial Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter in <hi>Bodin</hi> of a Man
of Experience and diſtinguiſhing Head, when they ſay, <hi>Il entend le
Par;</hi> alſo a <hi>Syllogiſm,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Undervaluation of our Money,
and a Compariſon of <hi>Exchange</hi> to the <hi>Aſſay</hi> of Money.
Commendations of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter <hi>Huſſey,</hi> Governor of the
Merchant-Adventurers, in the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, for
the great Pains he took in ſettling the <hi>Parity</hi> of Exchanges, however
the true Remedy to rule the Courſe of them, was but lately found out. The
Opinions of mercantile Men upon the <hi>beſt Methods</hi> of Traffic, with
our Author's Diſcuſſions thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as, <hi>Whether Foreign Nations
ſhou'd come and fetch our Wares? And whether there ſhou'd be no Societies
or Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> 
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:0570200100:129"/> 
                  <hi>of Merchants?</hi> Which tho'
our Author is for allowing, under Government, in appointed Places, becauſe
they may, by ſuch Order, be remov'd, or recall'd; and for that no Nation
trafficks ſo much in the bulk of ſtaple Commodities; inſomuch, that two
Years before the taking of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> all the Wares in
<hi>Chriſtendom</hi> vented there, in one Year, being valued, the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> amounted to four Parts in ſix: Yet we muſt not flatter
Companies or Societies, ſays he, in their unadviſed or irregular
Proceedings; for a Society may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a Monopoly, when ſome few Merchants
have the whole managing of a Trade to the hurt of a Commonwealth, and when many
others might alſo negotiate for the common good. Here we have a Definition of
a <hi>Monopoly,</hi> and an Approbation of the Cuſtom in the City of
<hi>Noremberg</hi>; where they receive all the Manufactures of the People, and
paying theſe weekly, ſell thoſe for a reaſonable Profit. This is
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with ſome Obſervations on the Royal Commodity of <hi>Tin,</hi>
which above 100 Years paſt, was ſold for 40 Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings the Hundred, when
the beſt <hi>Velvets</hi> were ſold for 10 Shillings the Yard. Alſo of
the Abolition and Re-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Prae-emption,</hi> whereby the
Wealth of the Kingdom has been ſince encreaſed 600 Thouſand Pounds
<hi>Sterling,</hi> and his Majeſty received for his Benefit 150 Thouſand
Pounds. Alſo how the Importation of <hi>Spaniſh Tobacco,</hi> gains the
Kingdom many Thouſand Pounds yearly. Next we have his Opinion upon <hi>Joint
Stocks</hi> in Companies; and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the general Intention of all Grants,
by <hi>Letters Patent,</hi> for New Inventions; with Reflections upon thoſe,
eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly relating to <hi>Alloms,</hi> rendering the Commodity dearer to
the Subject, and cheaper to the Tranſporter or Stranger; which he reſembles
to the Silver Mines of the Duke of <hi>Brunſwick,</hi> maintained at his own
Charge, called the <hi>Wild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi>; which cauſe him to coin Dollars, having
his Arms on one ſide, and a Savage Man on the other, holding a burning Candle
in his Hand, with this Inſcripton, <hi>Aliis inſerviendo,

               </p>
               <p>Chap. IV. <hi>Of want of Government in Trade.</hi> And herein he
ſets down the Errors in Trade, committed by Merchants, relating to Cloths,
and the making over their Moneys beyond Seas. Then he proceeds, Firſt, To
enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate the <hi>Defective Means and Remedies,</hi> no leſs than
Thirty-five, which have been tried theſe 350 Years, and next, to ſhew,
wherein they have been found fruitleſs, and that the decreaſe of Wealth in
a Kingdom, may be compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended <pb n="103" facs="tcp:0570200100:130"/> under theſe Heads: The
ſelling our Native Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities too cheap, buying Foreign Wares too dear, and
exporting our Money in Specie, or exchanging it for Money by Bills; and how the
Undervaluation thereof cauſes it to be exported or hinders the Importation.
This leads us, in the laſt Place, to</p>
               <p>Chap. V. <hi>Of the Remedies for all former Cauſes of the Decay
of Trade.</hi> Here he begins with his Remedies, Firſt, For the
<hi>undervaluing</hi> our Money, by <hi>overvaluing</hi> Foreign Coin; and
theſe are, by the Reformations of <hi>Exchange</hi> here propoſed, in
cauſing the Value of our Money to be given in Exchange; which wou'd out off
the Gain had by the Exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, and make Foreign Coin not to be
received above Value. More particularly, how, this recovery of
<hi>England</hi>'s Wealth is to be effected by Proclamation, and by publick
Tables, fixed up at the <hi>Royal Exchange;</hi> like thoſe kept at
<hi>Dover</hi> in the Time of King <hi>Edward</hi> III. to receive the
Paſſenger's Money, and by Exchange in Specie for it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Seas; which
made them leave their Moneys in the Realm. Further alſo, by taking warning
from the Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of inhancing Moneys; in ſeveral Examples of King
<hi>Henry</hi> VI. who raiſed the Ounce of Sterling Silver from 20 to 30
Pence, and King <hi>Edward</hi> IV. from 30 to 40 Pence. And King
<hi>Henry</hi> VIII. his raiſing the <hi>Angel No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble</hi> from 6 Shillings
and 8 Pence, to 7 Shillings and 4 Pence, and afterwards to 7 Shillings and 6
Pence, whereby every Ounce of <hi>Sterling</hi> Silver was worth 45 Pence; yet
there was nothing effected thereby, the Money ſtill altering beyond Sea.
Wherefore <hi>Wolſey</hi> had power given to alter the Valuation from time to
time as he ſaw cauſe. Soon after, it is ſhewn how the <hi>Turks,
Perſians</hi> and <hi>Ruſſians</hi> are, by keeping the Price of their
Exchanges above the Valuation of their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys, more politick than we. Hence
the Queſtion is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd, whether it is more expedient to raiſe the
Price of Exchange or the Valuation of Money. Next he ſhews how the want of
Money has ſunk the Price of <hi>Plate,</hi> from 5 Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and 8 Pence to
5 and 2 Pence, and what wou'd be the Conſeqence of its riſing. Here he
recommends all wrought Plate to be try'd and mark'd, alſo all Silver Thread
from abroad; and that they ſhou'd receive our Wool in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for it. The
Conſumption of Foreign Commodities or over-ballancing of them, is referr'd to
the Conſiderations upon the Abuſe of Exchange before: And the exceſſive
Uſe of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> to the Limitation of <hi>Spaniſh Tobacco</hi>
lately eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, <pb n="104" facs="tcp:0570200100:131"/> that the Plantations of
<hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Bermudas</hi> may be advanced thereby. The want of
Money thro' the <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Piracies,</hi> is compris'd in the
Reformation of <hi>Exchange</hi> and the Policy of <hi>Rewards.</hi> Thus
having, to the Cauſes of the want of Money, join'd ſome Means for
ſupplying it; he comes to the Remedys alſo for the Decay of Trade: And
here, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Under the Head of <hi>Uſury,</hi> to be remedied by
Money procur'd as afore directed, he recommends the Cuſtom of ſetting over
<hi>Bills</hi> of <hi>Debt</hi> from one Man to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and a Stock to erect
<hi>Pawn-Houſes</hi>; and for principal Towns to take in Money upon the
Adventure of their own or other Men's Lives; as at <hi>Venice,</hi> where a
Man, for three or four Hundred Pounds, ſhall be ſure of one Hundred Pounds
a Year for Life. The <hi>Third</hi> Cauſe of Decay in Trade, aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed to
litigious Law-Suits, our Author thinks there can be no ſhorter Courſe to
remedy than is us'd upon Proof and Specialities, if the Pleadings and
Iſſues be join'd according to the firſt Inſtitution; whereby the
<hi>Matter of Fact</hi> may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before a Jury: For touching the <hi>Matter
of Law,</hi> it, being ſeparated, makes a <hi>Demurrer</hi> to be determin'd
by the Judge. Here he commends the Courſe in <hi>Germany,</hi> to take down
litigious Humours, where a Fine of Twelve-pence in the Pound, or more is paid,
to the Emperor or Magiſtrates, for ſo much as is claim'd of the Defendant
more than can be proved to be due, beſides further Charge, if he be found to
proceed upon Revenge. As for the Differences between Merchants, he refers to
his <hi>Lex Mercatoria</hi>; as alſo the <hi>Fourth</hi> Remedy, in behalf of
the Fiſhing Trade. The <hi>Fifth</hi> upon making Cloth abroad, is partly
redreſs'd by the late Proclamation, to prohibit Exportations of that kind.
And the Rules of our Author for the true making of Cloth, may be a Remedy for
the <hi>Seventh</hi> Cauſe of Decay, as alſo to the <hi>Eighth</hi>; but
the <hi>Sixth,</hi> concerning the <hi>Policy of Merchants,</hi> is
recommended, for the general and not particular Good, to the Inſpection of a
Committee; ſo that other Merchants may upon reaſonable Conſiderations be
admitted of the ſaid Companies. The <hi>Ninth</hi> Cauſe is partly handled
in the <hi>Firſt,</hi> and as to <hi>Bankrupts,</hi> ſome Remedy is
aſſign'd alſo before, in ſetting over Bills of Debt; and the Defects in
the Statute againſt them, is to be remedied by the Authority of
<hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> to the Commiſſioners appointed to examine the ſame.
The Remedy to the <hi>Tenth</hi> and laſt Cauſe of our ſaid De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay, the
Immoderate Uſe of Foreign Commodities, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts, as was obſerved
before, partly in reforming the Abuſe <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0570200100:132"/> of Exchange,
whereby ſuch Abundance is imported, and partly in reſtraining the
Affectation of the Vulgar, to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their Superiors, by their being deprived
of their Ill Examples. Our Author concludes, That all theſe Cauſes of the
Decay of Trade in <hi>England,</hi> are moſtly compriſed in that One, the
<hi>Want of Money,</hi> whereof the <hi>Abuſe of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change</hi> is the
<hi>Efficient</hi> Cauſe; which made him project ſo eaſy <hi>a
Remedy;</hi> whereby the Kingdom ſhall enjoy the <hi>Three Eſſential
Parts</hi> of Traffic, under Good and Politic Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which will
effectually produce a <hi>Free Trade.</hi>

Twenty of our Kings <hi>before</hi> the <hi>Conqueſt,</hi> painted in their

loſt the Kingdom to <hi>William</hi> the <hi>Norman.</hi> 
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0570200100:133"/> And the <hi>Preface,</hi> is <hi>A Diſcourſe
concerning the Nobility of England, according to the Laws of England.</hi> The
begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whereof, for a Taſte of the Author, we ſhall here give in his
own Words. 
<q rend="inline">"As in the Body natural, for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of the whole, the different Temperature of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and Offices in ſeveral
Members, are requiſite: So likewiſe in the Body Civil, or Politic,
different Eſtates and Degrees among Men have been judged as neceſſary.
And as the Elements cannot be intermingled one with another, except it be by an
unequal Proportion and Temperature: So Civil Societies cannot poſſibly be
preſerved, but by a certain Inequality; which is apparent by the different
Forms of Government, obſerved and eſtabliſh'd in all Countries: And the
ancient Policy of this Realm of <hi>England,</hi> being govern'd by
<hi>Royalty,</hi> ever ſince it was known to be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited Piece of Earth,
hath admitted of a Threefold Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Perſons, <hi>viz. King,
Nobles,</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi>; which hath been a Government very Ancient,
and fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, both by Magiſtrates and People; and rooted in Mens
Affections both by long habituated Excerciſe, and the well approved Benefits
received thereby."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After this, he proceeds to diſtinguiſh the ſeveral Degrees,
or Titles of Honour; and firſt of the <hi>King,</hi> and his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign
Power. That many of his Rights are termed <hi>Flowers of the Crown</hi>; in
which reſpect <hi>Bracton,</hi> ſpeaking of them, ſays, The King's
<hi>material</hi> Crown is adorned with <hi>Flowers.</hi> Alſo, that ſome
of his Rights are by poſitive, or written <hi>Laws</hi>; others by right of
<hi>Cuſtom.</hi> And that the <hi>Regalia,</hi> or Enſigns of Royalty,
eſpecially the <hi>Crown, Scepter, Purple Robe,</hi> and <hi>Golden
Ball,</hi> are as old among us, as King <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur,</hi> according to the
Teſtimony of <hi>Leland.</hi> Next he ſhews, That the <hi>Nobility,</hi>
comprehend the <hi>Prince, Dukes, Marqueſſes, Earls, Viſcounts,</hi> and
<hi>Barons</hi>; as the <hi>Commons,</hi> conſiſt of <hi>Knights,
Eſquires, Gentlemen, Yeomen, Artificers,</hi> and <hi>Labourers.</hi> Which
laſt are not here further ſpoken of, <pb n="107" facs="tcp:0570200100:134"/> this Work
confining itſelf to the ſuperior <hi>Nobility.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, having
given us the Derivation of <hi>Nobilitas,</hi> from the Word <hi>Noſco,</hi>
as one known, or <hi>notable</hi> for his Vertue, or the reward of it, he
diſtinguiſhes, why they are called Peers, and the whole Body of them the
Baronage; what difference there is in their Parliament Robes; how they are
tryed by the whole Body, and in what Caſes they retain both their
<hi>Chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Surnames</hi>; then deſcends more particularly
to their ſeveral Degrees. Here we ſee, That the Title of <hi>Prince,</hi>
was called by the <hi>Saxons, Aetheling:</hi> That the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> only
call'd him the <hi>King's Son,</hi> and the <hi>firſt begotten</hi> of the
King of <hi>England,</hi> till King <hi>Edward</hi> I. ſummoned his Son
<hi>Edward</hi> to Parliament, by the Title of <hi>Prince</hi> of
<hi>Wales</hi> and Earl of <hi>Cheſter</hi>; and <hi>Edward</hi> III. created
his Son Duke of <hi>Cornwall,</hi> ſince which this Title has been
appropriated to the King's firſt Son. That as for the Title of <hi>Duke,</hi>
it was firſt of <hi>Charge</hi> and <hi>Office,</hi> not of <hi>Dignity,</hi>
after the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolition of the <hi>Roman</hi> Government here; and that this
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in the Days of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was inferior to that of
<hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mites</hi>; moreover, upon what Conditions this Title of Duke was
conferr'd, as alſo that of Earl, or what Qualifications were requir'd in
them; namely, Faithfulneſs and Valour ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, with the Protection of
Widows and Orphans; that People, under their Regiment, might with Joy continue
in Peace. That the Title began under <hi>Otho</hi>; but in <hi>England,</hi>
not before King <hi>Edward</hi> III. created his Son <hi>Edward</hi>
aforeſaid, and alſo his two other Sons; from which time we have had
Hereditary Dukes. That the <hi>Marqueſs</hi> was not known to us, till King
<hi>Richard</hi> II. made his Minion <hi>Robert Vere</hi> Earl of
<hi>Oxford,</hi> Marqueſs of <hi>Dublin;</hi> and became not till then a
Title of Honour, for before, thoſe who govern'd the <hi>Marches,</hi> were
commonly called Lord <hi>Marcheres.</hi> The Title of <hi>Earl,</hi> ſome
think to be derived from the <hi>Germans,</hi> who had their <hi>Comites</hi>
according to <hi>Tacitus</hi>; but others think it came from the
<hi>Romans,</hi> and that before <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> the
Name of <hi>Comes</hi> was not uſed as a Title of Honour. That after the
diſſolution of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, this Title of Earls was retained
by our <hi>Engliſh Saxons;</hi> and the <hi>Danes</hi> termed them by a Word,
ſignifying Honourable, which, ſomewhat mollified, agrees with what we at
preſent call them. That they became not, before the <hi>Normans</hi> got
footing here, Feudal, Hereditary and Patrimonial, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by
<hi>Domeſday-Book.</hi> After that, they were created with the Additional
Name of a <hi>Place,</hi> and Aſſignment of the <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0570200100:135"/>
                  <hi>Third Penny</hi> of the Shire, as appears by the Empreſs <hi>Maud's</hi>
Creation (the moſt ancient Form which has been ſeen) of <hi>Geoffrey
Mandevill, Earl</hi> of <hi>Eſſex.</hi> And King <hi>John</hi> was the
firſt we meet with, who uſed the Cincture of a Sword in their Creation, and
they waited at his Table there with it by their Side. It was the next Age
before the Impoſition of a Chaplet, Cap of Honour with a Circlet of Gold came
up, which after that, as at this Day, was turn'd into a Coro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net with Rays or
Points. The <hi>Earls Palatine</hi> were rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kon'd moſt Honourable, and
<hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> held the Earldom of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> as freely by the
Sword, as the King held <hi>England</hi> by the Crown. To which was added, the
diſtinction of bearing the Sword at Coronations; called <hi>Curtana,</hi>
which being blunt betokened Mercy. This Earl ordained Barons and Abbots to
ſerve in his Parliament, who with him made Laws for the Government of his
County. Earldoms of Title without Place, as the <hi>Earl Marſhal</hi> of
<hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan under King <hi>Richard</hi> II. who gave that Title to
<hi>Thomas Mowbray</hi> Earl of <hi>Nottingham.</hi> As for
<hi>Viſcounts,</hi> it is alſo an old Name of Office, but a new one of
Dignity; not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing known among us for a Title of Honour before King
<hi>Henry</hi> VI. who created <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Beaumont, Viſcount
Beaumont.</hi> Here 'tis remarked, That after a Man is cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated an Earl or
Viſcount, or any other Title of Honour a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them, his Title becomes parcel
of his Name, and not an Addition only, and in all Legal Proceedings he muſt
be ſtiled by that Dignity. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> We come to the <hi>Barons.</hi>
And here 'tis obſerved that our ancient <hi>Britons</hi> did not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
the Name, and that in the <hi>Engliſh Saxon</hi> Laws it is not ſeen: That
in the <hi>Saxon</hi> Gloſſary of <hi>Alfricus,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Vocables or
Terms of Honour; <hi>Dominus</hi> is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>Laford,</hi> which we
have contracted into <hi>Lord,</hi> and the <hi>Danes</hi> called their Free
Lords, who equall'd the Barons of our Time, <hi>Thani.</hi> And that in a
Fragment of the Laws of <hi>Canute,</hi> was the firſt mention of a
<hi>Baron</hi> with us; yet there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, according to the Varieties of Copies, is
indifferently read, <hi>Virones, Barones,</hi> and <hi>Thani.</hi> The Service
of theſe Barons appears from the Laws of <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror, into
which thoſe Ordinances of <hi>Canute</hi> are tranſlated in the
<hi>Norman</hi> Tongue, where it being ordain'd, That the <hi>Heriot</hi> or
<hi>Relevies</hi> ſhould be moderate, and thoſe of an <hi>Earl,</hi>
men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd, it appears that ſome of thoſe Accoutrements (for the Wars) to
be raiſed by the <hi>Barons,</hi> were but half in propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as, four
Horſes, two Swords, four Spears, and four <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0570200100:136"/> Targets; but
for the reſt, only one Helmet, one Coat of Mail, and in Money only 50
<hi>Mances</hi> or <hi>Marks</hi> of Gold, which are but a fourth Part. Alſo
after the coming of the <hi>Normans, Valvaſors</hi> and <hi>Thanes</hi> were
ranged in Degree next after <hi>Barons</hi>; and our learned Interpreters have
thought the Dignity of <hi>Barons</hi> was comprehended un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the
<hi>Valvaſores Majores,</hi> afterward called <hi>Capitanii,</hi> and that
the like Dignity was, by the <hi>Engliſh Saxons</hi> before the Conqueſt
called <hi>Thanes,</hi> according to <hi>Lambert</hi> in his
<hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ambulation</hi> of <hi>Kent.</hi> Neither was the Name of
<hi>Baron</hi> then granted to be of great Honour, ſome <hi>Earls</hi> having
in thoſe Days their <hi>Barons</hi> under them, of which here are Examples
produced. A few Years after they were accounted <hi>Barons,</hi> who held an
entire <hi>Barony,</hi> conſiſting of 13 <hi>Knights Fees</hi> and one
Third, which amounted to 400 Marks yearly: A <hi>Knight's Fee</hi>
conſiſting of 12 <hi>Carves</hi> of Land, a <hi>Carve</hi> of 8
<hi>Oxgangs,</hi> an <hi>Oxgang</hi> of 15 Acres. Theſe <hi>Baronies</hi>
were held, ſome of the King, and thoſe who had them of this Value, were
taken for <hi>Barons</hi> by Fee, to which was annexed a Dignity with
Juriſdiction; which the <hi>Court Barons</hi> in ſome ſort prove. In King
<hi>Henry</hi> IIId's days, there were reckon'd in <hi>England</hi> 150
<hi>Baronies.</hi> But this Dignity attained to its higheſt Honour after that
King in the 49th Year of his Reign, ſummon'd a ſelect Number to the
Parliament, and they of the moſt ancient Families and excellent
Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and decreed that none other ſhou'd come; which his Son
<hi>Edward</hi> I. alſo conſtantly obſerv'd. Hence they were only
accounted <hi>Barons,</hi> whom the King by ſuch Writs of Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons did call
to Parliament. And 'tis obſerv'd, to the great Glory of this King
<hi>Edward,</hi> that he did always direct his ſaid Writs to thoſe of the
beſt Families, and whoſe Wiſdom and Virtues were anſwerable: But
paſs'd over their Sons af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their Death, if they were not equal to their
Parents in Underſtanding and all other commendable Qualities. Here we have
ſome curious Queſtions debated upon this Head, as, <hi>Whether a Barony by
Writ, may deſcend from the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtor to the Heir? Whether it may deſcend
to the Heir Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male, who is nearer a-kin than the Males? And whether, if it may
deſcend to ſuch Females, their Husbands may aſſume the Style and
Dignity of ſuch a Barony.</hi> Herein are Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments produced on both ſides
of theſe Queſtions, after which follow others, to compound the
Controverſy, by our Author. So from the Nature, Quality and State of 
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0570200100:137"/> 
                  <hi>Barons</hi> by <hi>Writ,</hi> he paſſes to
<hi>Barons</hi> by <hi>Creation,</hi> begun by King <hi>Richard</hi> II. And
for the Explanation of this Dignity, here alſo are ſome Queſtions
reſolved. Then he proceeds to diſcourſe of <hi>Barons</hi> by
<hi>Tenure</hi>; or ſuch as held any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Caſtle, or Manor, as the Head
of their Barony, by Barony, or Grand Serjeanty: That they were
<hi>Spiritual</hi> and <hi>Temporal,</hi> the former of whom having loſt
their Seat in Parliament, 17 <hi>Car.</hi> he ſays nothing more of them; but
of the Temporal <hi>Barons</hi> by <hi>Tenure,</hi> having ſhewn that ſuch
there were, he lays down ſome Arguments and Examples to determine the
Queſtion, <hi>Whether after alienating the Lands by which they hold, they can
retain their Title and Dignity?</hi> Thus having touch'd upon the Original,
Nature and diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Degrees of our <hi>Peerage,</hi> he concludes, with
ſome Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations upon their <hi>Privileges,</hi> this his Preface,
conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Twenty-ſix Pages.</p>
               <p>The Work begins with a Diſplay in one Leaf, of the <hi>Arms</hi>
of our Kingdom under its different Governments, in five ſeveral
<hi>Scutcheons,</hi> repreſenting in their proper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, thoſe of the
<hi>Saxons, Romans, Britons, Danes,</hi> and the <hi>Normans</hi> in the
middle. So we turn over, and begin with the Nobility under <hi>William</hi> the
<hi>Conqueror</hi>; and firſt with <hi>Edgar Etheling,</hi> who was
<hi>Earl</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi> before, and at the coming of the ſaid
<hi>William</hi> into <hi>England.</hi> A ſhort Account being given of this
Earl, and his Arms painted on the ſide of it, we have two other contemporary
Nobles treated of after the like Manner, in the ſame Page; and this regular
Method of Hiſtorizing three Noblemen in every Page, with the
<hi>Blazonry</hi> of their Arms in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, except where the Pages and
Scutcheons are not fill'd up, which is very rare, is purſued through every
Reign. That of the Conqueror, taking up 28 Pages, conſequently gives account
of 84 Noblemen. After this, the <hi>Noblemen</hi> of every Reign, are led up by
the Arms of every <hi>King</hi> then reigning, in the middle of a Blank Leaf,
and nothing more written under them than the Name of the King. We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve no
<hi>Quarterings</hi> in the King's Arms, from the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, till we come to
<hi>Edward</hi> III. nor any <hi>Supporters</hi> of, or <hi>Badges</hi> over
them, till then: But from hence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly appear, changing with the
ſeveral Lines or Races of the ſaid Kings. In the Reigns of <hi>William</hi>
aforeſaid, King <hi>James,</hi> and King <hi>Charles,</hi> are the greateſt
Number of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blemen; in which laſt, Baron <hi>Sutton</hi> is the laſt
mention'd; <pb n="111" facs="tcp:0570200100:138"/> and in the Reigns of <hi>Henry</hi> IV.
<hi>Richard</hi> III. <hi>Henry</hi> VII. <hi>Edward</hi> VI. <hi>Mary</hi> and
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> eſpecially as this laſt reigned ſo long, there are
the feweſt Noblemen mention'd. Other Obſervations upon this MS. and
Deductions from them, might be made; but at this Time, theſe may ſuffice in
this Place.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE Author <hi>Dedicates</hi> this Tract to Major General
<hi>Lambert,</hi> having had experimental Knowledge and Trial of his Abilities,
for the reforming of <hi>Academies,</hi> and of his ſincere Affection and
unparallel'd Love to <hi>Learning.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In his <hi>Epiſtle, To all who truly love the Advancement of
Learning in the</hi> Univerſities of <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi>
or elſewhere; he anticipates ſeveral Objections, which might be raiſed
againſt ſo private a Perſon as himſelf, for undertaking thus freely, to
handle an Argument of this publick Nature and Conſequence. And one of them,
where he ſuggeſts he ſhou'd be look'd upon as a <hi>Leveller</hi>; he
anſwers, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 
<q rend="inline">"He muſt needs ſo far own <hi>Levelling,</hi>
that he holds <hi>plain</hi> Dealing to be a Jewel, and that <hi>plain</hi>
Ways ſeem to him moſt ſecure and comfortable: That the <hi>Prelacy,</hi>
tho' it ſought to bow him, cou'd not break him: That tho' the
<hi>Presbyterian</hi> Pride did ſeem to threaten him, it cou'd not hurt him;
and the <hi>Independent</hi> Forms cou'd never inform him beyond the Baſis of
a better Building than Man can erect. That the ſpoil of Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies cou'd
never pleaſe his Mind, nor ſhou'd they <pb n="112" facs="tcp:0570200100:139"/> fill his
Purſe. That he was no Dean, nor Maſter, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident, nor Provoſt;
Fellow, nor Penſioner; nor had Tythes appropriate, or impropriate;
Augmentation, or State Pay. That all the <hi>Levelling</hi> in theſe Times,
had not mounted him, nor cou'd they make him fall lower: And he that wou'd
raiſe himſelf by the Ruins of others, or <hi>warm</hi> himſelf by the
<hi>burning</hi> of <hi>Schools,</hi> he wiſhes no greater Plague than his
own <hi>Ignorance,</hi> or that he may ever gain more <hi>Knowledge</hi> than
to live to repent."</q> There are certainly many good Obſervations in the
Book; and if a few Animadverſions might by Critical Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, be made upon
his Style in ſome Places, and, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, his Choice of exceptionable Matter,
or the Efficacy of his Expedients, for the Reformation propos'd; yet the Work
will ſtill demand regard for the eminency of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, and a Subject of
ſuch great Importance, may ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt imperfect Hints in it ſo, to
Heads which can raiſe out of them more effectual Improvements. But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
this Matter is not feebly recommended by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor himſelf, as in other
Parts of the Work, ſo in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> wherein
having inform'd us, That he intends not to aſperſe the Perſon of any, nor
to traduce or calumniate the <hi>Academies</hi> themſelves; but only the
Corruptions which Time and Negligence have introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced there, and ſimply to
attempt ſome <hi>Reformation,</hi> not <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radication</hi> of their
Cuſtoms and Learning: 
<q rend="inline">"He adds, which, tho' I have, peradventure, but
weakly managed, yet I hope my poor Mite, with the Candid and Ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, will
be accepted; for the reſt, I value them not; and I intreat the more able to
ſupply, what my want of Strength hath left incomplete. I have rather intended
this as an <hi>Eſſay,</hi> to break the Ice to ſome more able Judgment,
than as ſufficient of itſelf to perform what is aimed at; becauſe I have
neither performed what I ſhou'd have done, nor what I cou'd, but only traced
out ſome few clear Things, as a guide to higher and more noble
Undertakings."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After ſome Verſes, by his Friends, in praiſe of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
and his Work, he enters upon it, divided under <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Chapters,</hi> in
the following Manner. I. <hi>Of the general Ends of erecting Public
Schools;</hi> under which, he tells us; 
<q rend="inline">"If the <hi>Academies</hi> had kept within their
own Sphere, and on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught <hi>Human Science,</hi> and had not, in Pride and
Vain-Glory, mounted into the Chariot of the Sun like <hi>Phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>; 
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0570200100:140"/> they had then, neither diſorder'd, nor injur'd
<hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> that is above them, nor the Things of Nature, which they
account below them."</q> II. <hi>Of the Diviſion of Academic Learning, and
firſt of School Theology.</hi> Hence, having ſpoken of Perplexities wherein
the preſumptuous Imaginations of Mankind have enſnared and intangled
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he proceeds to, III. <hi>The Diviſion of Human Learning; and
firſt of Tongues, or Languages.</hi> Herein the greateſt Objection is, the
making ſome Sciences meerly ſpeculative; as <hi>Philoſophy,</hi>
according to that of <hi>Seneca; Noſtraque erat</hi> Philoſophia,
<hi>facta</hi> Philologia <hi>eſt, ex qua, diſputare dicemus, non
vivere;</hi> and the like of <hi>Mathematicks.</hi> Then he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to divide
the Sciences in a manner moſt commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for his Purpoſe; beginning with
thoſe ſubſervient or conducive to others, as <hi>Grammar;</hi> under
which he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Dr. <hi>Webb</hi>'s Enterprize of teaching the
<hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, by an eaſy <hi>Clauſulary</hi> Method; and the
elaborate Pains of Mr. <hi>Brinſley.</hi> So deſcends to the recommendation
of <hi>Hieroglyphical, Emblematical, Symbolical</hi> and
<hi>Cryptographi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> Learning, all relative to <hi>Grammar</hi>;
inferrable from the Labours of <hi>Oughtred, Harrington, Spanheim, Porta,
Trithe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mius, Agrippa, Claramuel, Silenus,</hi> and Frier <hi>Bacon,</hi> with
the like Praiſes of a <hi>Univerſal Character, Dactylogy,</hi> the <hi>Real
Character</hi> of the <hi>Chineſe,</hi> and <hi>Jacob Behmen</hi>'s
<hi>Language of Nature.</hi> After his Obſervations upon theſe Relatives to
Grammar, he goes on to diſcourſe in the IV. Chapter, <hi>Of Logic.</hi> And
here ſhews what a <hi>Civil War</hi> of <hi>Words</hi> it is made; the
Imperfections of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s Syſtem, and of <hi>Logic</hi>
itſelf; with the Conſequence of <hi>Tully's Alphabetical</hi> way of
<hi>Syllogizing,</hi> and concludes with Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of
<hi>Logic,</hi> as it is abuſed. So we come to V. <hi>The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematical
Sciences.</hi> And here he complains how ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully the Foundation-Stone to
this great Building, <hi>Arithme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,</hi> has been neglected or thrown aſide
by our <hi>Academic</hi> Maſters, and but for ſome private Spirits, ſuch
as <hi>Napier, Briggs, Oughtred</hi> and a few others, it had lain as a Garden
unweeded. The like is obſerved of <hi>Geometry</hi>; alſo, how lately, by
how few, and thoſe Foreigners, any <hi>Optical</hi> Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements appear'd.
That <hi>Muſic</hi> has indeed had ſome Pains and Honour ſhew'd to that
Part of it, which is the concomitant of, or Spur to Voluptuouſneſs; which
is the Companion of Melancholics, Fantaſtics, Courtiers, Ladies, Taverns, and
Taphouſes. But any higher Advancements of it, for diſcovering natural
Knowledge, and the Harmony of the <pb n="114" facs="tcp:0570200100:141"/> Univerſe remains
unattempted. The Abſurdities of our Scholaſtic Syſtems of
<hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> are next largely laid open; as that the Earth is the
Centre of the Univerſe, and the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Orbs immutable; that they are
ſolid Bodies, the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity of the Tenth Sphere, and of the Eighth, or Starry
Sphere. In <hi>Coſmography</hi> the Deficiences are next mention'd,
eſpecially in the mutual Correſpondence and Application of the Heavens and
Earth; nor are the Theorems of <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drography</hi> brought into Practice,
whereby Men might be made able for Navigation. <hi>Aſtrology,</hi>
notwithſtanding all the Derogation of the Schools, and Diſcredit brought
upon it, by the Ignorance and Knavery of pretended Scioliſts, our Author
recommends as a laudable and profitable Study; and arraigns the negligence of
Univerſities for having ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle regarded the Improvement of <hi>Statics,
Architecture, Pneumatithmy, Stratarithmetry,</hi> and the reſt enumerated by
the learned Dr. <hi>Dee</hi> in his Preface to <hi>Euclid.</hi> Hence we paſs
VI. <hi>To Scholaſtic Philoſophy.</hi> Herein <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> is
pull'd to pieces, from the beginning to the end, and Reaſons drawn for
denying the Palm to the <hi>Peripatetic</hi> Philoſophy, from the uncertainty
we are in, both as to his Books and Doctrine, as alſo the defectiveneſs of
thoſe which we leaſt doubt to be his; whence we are led to obſerve, in
what Parts of Phyſical Knowledge the Schools are moſt deficient, and
theſe are <hi>Natural Magic, Chymiſtry, Medicine, Anatomy, Surgery,</hi>
and <hi>Phyſiognomy,</hi> Coeleſtial and Subcoeleſtial,
<hi>Onei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rocratics</hi>; beſides the <hi>Magnetical</hi> Philoſophy, for
which Dr. <hi>Gilbert, Ridley, Carpenter, Barlow</hi> and <hi>Cabaeus,</hi> are
ſo much commended; and the <hi>Atomical</hi> Learning, reviv'd by
<hi>Deſcartes,</hi> and improv'd by <hi>Magnenus, Regius, White, Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by,
Phocyllides, Holwarda,</hi> and others. Then we proceed, VII. <hi>To
Metaphyſics, Ethics, Politics, Oeconomics, Poeſy</hi> and <hi>Oratory.</hi>
Where having ſhewn what airy, inſufficient, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſive, and meer
Ornamental Aſſiſtances they are made, and thus run over ſome defects of
<hi>Academic</hi> Learning, tho' not all, intimating that a great Part
deſerves to be eradicated, ſome reform'd, and all meliorated in our ſaid
Schools, he moves on to VIII. <hi>Their Cuſtoms and Method,</hi> leaving
their Manners and Maintenance to others. Here the firſt Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is, that
tho' there are divers Houſes in one Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity; yet all Students muſt
follow one another like Carriers Horſes in one accuſtom'd Path. The
ſecond, is the ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Performance of their Scholaſtic Exerciſes,
their Public Acts being kept but four Times in a Year. 3. The Injury of 
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0570200100:142"/> tying all Men to one ſet Courſe of Years, before
they can re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their Degrees. 4. The ridiculous Levity of their hiſtorical
Perſonations in the performance of their Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes. 5. Their empty and
windy Diſputations therein, without any Foundation from Induſtry, or
practical Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. 6. Their Confinement in all Exerciſes to the
<hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> Tongue. 7. Too much admiring Antiquity. 8. Being bound in with
multiplicity of Voices. 9. Adhering to Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, eſpecially of
<hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> 10. The Immethodical Courſe of inſtructing Youth in
<hi>Logic</hi> and <hi>Natural Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> before they have taſted
the Rudiments of <hi>Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Knowledge</hi>: But as before an old
Building is demoliſh'd, a Platform is uſually deviſed for a better. So
our Author in Cap. IX. Offers ſome <hi>Expedients or Remedies in Theology,
Grammar, Logic and Mathematics</hi>; wherein, though he thinks what he has
before produced for demonſtrating the ill Compoſure of the
<hi>Scholaſtic</hi> Fabric of Learning, not far from the Truth, and tho' he
here acknowledges his own Inſufficiency to make a more ſerviceable
Subſtitution: yet, <hi>In magnis, voluiſſe, ſat eſt.</hi> He will do
his Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and hopes that abler Hands will ſupply his Defects. Having
offer'd his ſaid Means for regulating the Study of theſe Sciences, he
continues after the like manner, to treat in Cap. X. <hi>Of ſome Helps in
Natural Philoſophy</hi>; in which he highly celebrates the Writings of Dr.
<hi>Flud.</hi> So gives us laſtly, in Cap. XI. <hi>Some Expedients concerning
their Cuſtom and Method:</hi> And hopes they will be acceptable till better
be found out.</p>

<hi>In an Account of ſome of the moſt remarkable late</hi> Improvements
<hi>of practical, uſeful</hi> Learning, <hi>to encourage</hi> Philoſophical
En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours: <hi>Occaſioned by a Conference with one of the</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional

               <p>THE Intention of this Treatiſe is, by aſſembling ſuch a
Variety as it contains, of new Improvements in all Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, to raiſe able
and pregnant Heads from a drouſy Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence in the Diſcoveries of
former Times, and tempt them from thoſe Modern Advancements, with
Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to proceed. And tho' the Author intends not a full Hiſtory of
the ſaid Improvements, and their Authors; yet the moſt remarkable of them
are inſtanced, at leaſt ſo far as may ſerve his aim of confuting his
Antagoniſt, and exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Philoſophical Endeavours: In which he has has a
prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal regard to the <hi>Royal Society,</hi> by giving a ſuccinct
Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Purpoſes and Productions of that Illuſtrious Aſſembly,
for the Information of ſuch as have not met with their excellent
Hiſtory.</p>
               <p>After his <hi>Dedication</hi> to <hi>William</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Bath</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> and his <hi>Preface</hi> to the Clergy of
that Dioceſe, we come to the <hi>Work</hi> itſelf; which, in the running
<hi>Title,</hi> is called, <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Improvements of uſeful Knowledge</hi>;
and is divided into <hi>Eighteen</hi> Chapters, tho' the whole is written by
way of Letter to a Friend. The firſt Chapter containing his Intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction,
ſhews the Occaſion of writing this Treatiſe, to have proceeded from a
Diſpute the Author had with an old Clergyman in his Neighbourhood<note n="*" place="bottom">His Name was as we find elſewhere, Dr. <hi>Robert Croſs,</hi>
Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of <hi>Chue</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> in which Country, our
Author <hi>Glan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill</hi> was Rector of <hi>Bath,</hi> afterwards Chaplain in
Ordinary to King <hi>Charles</hi> II. and Prebendary of <hi>Worceſter. A.
Wood</hi> ſays of him, 
<q rend="inline">"That he was a Perſon of more than ordinary
Parts, of a quick, warm, ſpruce and gay Fancy, and was more lucky, at leaſt
in his own Judgment, in his firſt Hints and Thoughts of Things, than in his
after Notions. He had a very tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Memory, and was a great Maſter of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Language, expreſſing himſelf therein with eaſy
Fluency, and in a manly, yet withal a ſmooth Style."</q> Tho' the ſaid Dr.
<hi>Croſs</hi> wrote a Book againſt this <hi>Plus Ultra,</hi> he cou'd not
get it printed; and tho' Dr. <hi>Stubbes</hi> alſo wrote another againſt
it, the ſame was not much regarded. See a further Account of this <hi>Plus

ſo wedded <pb n="117" facs="tcp:0570200100:144"/> to the <hi>Peripatetic</hi> Philoſophy,
and extoll'd <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> ſo far above all Compariſon, as to
contend, 
<q rend="inline">"That he had more Advantages for Knowledge, than
either the Royal Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or all the preſent Age."</q> But, ſays our
Author, in the Concluſion of this Chapter, 
<q rend="inline">"As my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> obſerves well,
<hi>Philoſophy as well as Faith muſt be ſhewn by its Works:</hi> And if
the <hi>Moderns</hi> cannot ſhew more of the Works of their Philoſophy in
ſix Years, than the <hi>Ariſtote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians</hi> can produce of theirs in more
than <hi>thrice</hi> ſo many <hi>hundred,</hi> let them be loaded with all
that Contempt, which is uſually the reward of vain and unprofitable
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectors."</q> Chap. 2. <hi>Is upon the Ways of improving uſeful
Knowledge,</hi> Firſt, by enlarging the Hiſtory of Things, and next by
improving Intercourſe and Communications: Alſo upon the Advantages of this
Age, from the great Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Chymiſtry and Anatomy. Here we have a
brief recital of the many Diſcoveries made in the Body of Man, and the Names
of the Phyſicians who made them; more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, of the
<hi>Circulation</hi> and <hi>Transfuſion</hi> of the <hi>Blood.</hi> Chap. 3.
<hi>On the Advantage of late Times from the Improvements of Mathematics,</hi>
particularly in <hi>Arithmetic,</hi> by <hi>Logarithms, Napier</hi>'s
<hi>Bones,</hi> and <hi>Decimals</hi>; alſo in <hi>Algebra</hi> and
<hi>Geometry,</hi> and by whom they have been improved. Chap. 4. Is upon
<hi>the Improvements,</hi> more particularly in <hi>Geometry,</hi> by <hi>Des
Cartes, Vieta,</hi> Dr. <hi>Wallis, Harriot</hi> and <hi>Oughtred.</hi> Chap.
5. <hi>The late Improvements of Aſtronomy</hi>; in the Performances of
<hi>John de Sacro Boſco, Regiomontanus,</hi> who publiſh'd the firſt
<hi>Ephemerides, Clavius, Tycho Brahe, Copernicus, Galilaeo, Jacobus
Metius,</hi> Inventor of the Teleſcope, <hi>Scheiner, Kepler, Bullialdus,
Hevelius,</hi> and ſeveral others, ending with Dr. <hi>Seth Ward,</hi>
Biſhop of <hi>Sarum,</hi> who had demonſtratively proved the Elliptical
Hypotheſis. Chap. 16. Recites <hi>the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements of Optics and
Geography.</hi> Here we learn that <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> ſo much commended, by
<hi>Picus Mirandula</hi> and <pb n="118" facs="tcp:0570200100:145"/> 
                  <hi>Voſſius,</hi> wrote

improved, and that in <hi>Geography</hi> likewiſe, Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have been
great, as may be found, by comparing the Works of ſome Moderns here named,
with the beſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains of the Ancients. Chap. 7. Is upon <hi>the Aids of
uſeful Knowledge by Inſtruments, as the</hi> Teleſcope, Microſcope
<hi>and</hi> Thermometer. Chap. 8. <hi>Of the</hi> Barometer <hi>and</hi> Air
Pump; <hi>and what Advantages we have and may further expect from them.</hi>

in <hi>Animals,</hi> and chiefly Man: That all the Heads of <hi>Natural

the way to <hi>ſubſtantial</hi> Wiſdom, and has given moſt excellent
<hi>Directions,</hi> for the Method of ſuch an <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of

Mr.</hi> Boyle, <hi>for the Promotion of uſeful Knowledge;</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an
Account of the Books he had publiſh'd, and what Knowledge he had advanced in
them. Chap. 14. <hi>Gives a further Account of the Works, Mr.</hi> Boyle
<hi>had by him unpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed,</hi> for the Advantage and Improvement of real
Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and what Reaſons there were to hope for great Things from the
<hi>Royal Society.</hi> Chap. 15. The <hi>Abſurdity</hi> of making
<hi>Compariſons,</hi> between the Advantages <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> had for
Knowledge, and thoſe of <hi>later Ages.</hi> Chap. 16. The <hi>Reaſon</hi>
of ſome Men's ſuperſtitious <hi>Adherence</hi> to the <hi>notional</hi>
way, and of the <hi>Diſputer</hi> who gave occaſion to this
<hi>Diſcourſe.</hi> Chap. 17. Treats more particularly of the
<hi>Peripatetic</hi> Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy, and <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> as he concerns
the <hi>Univerſities.</hi> Laſtly, in Chap. 18. We have ſome
<hi>Arguments</hi> of our Author with his Antagoniſt about the
<hi>Prophets</hi> and <hi>Scriptures;</hi> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, that God was
pleaſed in his <hi>Inſpirations,</hi> to apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much to the

own Words, both in Print and Manuſcript<note n="*" place="bottom"> 
                     <p>His Words in Print are theſe. 
<q rend="inline">"We once intended a full and entire Hiſtory
of the <hi>Lives</hi> of theſe Noble <hi>Founders,</hi> and to that purpoſe
made a large and chargeable Collection out of the Records in the Tower of
<hi>London,</hi> and elſewhere, of all that we could find worthy to be
remember'd in them; in which we ſpent moſt part of the Years 1657, 1658,

                     <p>But from a MS. of his own Writing, we find Mr.
<hi>Aſhmole</hi> firſt took this <hi>Work</hi> of the <hi>Garter</hi> into
Conſideration about the Year 1655: That the Charges of his
<hi>Collections</hi> for it, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to 500<hi>l.</hi> before the
Reſtoration, and to no inconſiderable Sum after it: Yet obſerving how
meagre the Memorials were, which had been preſerved of the <hi>Ancient</hi>
Companions; he peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd the King in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1660, that his
Majeſty wou'd add to the other Officers of the Order, a particular
<hi>Hiſtoriographer</hi> and a <hi>Remembrancer,</hi> with the Salary of only
100 <hi>l. per Ann.</hi> as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to tranſmit their Noble Companions
for the future more ſuitably to Poſterity; and modeſtly hoped to have the
ſame be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd upon himſelf, as what might bring ſome Authority to his
Performance, lighten his Charges, and raiſe him above the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triment of
Cenſure. King <hi>Charles,</hi> having been inform'd of his <hi>Reaſons,
Labour, Expences</hi> and <hi>Qualifications,</hi> ſigned a Warrant for the

<hi>Order,</hi> authorizing the Patent to be paſs'd under the Seal thereof.
But the ſaid Chancellor refuſed to paſs it, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Mr.
<hi>Aſhmole</hi>'s Irregularity in procuring it, and not only alledg'd he
ought to have obtained his firſt Grant by the Hand of the ſaid
<hi>Chancellor,</hi> and the <hi>Chapter,</hi> that is, (as Mr.
<hi>Aſhmole</hi> himſelf words it) have ſought it of thoſe who wou'd
obſtruct it; but in <hi>Feb.</hi> 1661, laid an <hi>Information</hi> thereof
before the <hi>Chapter</hi> then held, and Mr. <hi>Aſhmole</hi> was not
admitted either to make a <hi>Defence</hi> of himſelf, or ſhew the
<hi>Advantages</hi> of the <hi>Office</hi> propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ſo it was laid
aſide; and he preſented a Draught in Writing of the <hi>Objections</hi>
there made againſt ſuch an Inſtitution, and his <hi>Anſwers</hi>
thereto, which he dedicated in <hi>Dec.</hi> 1662, to the Lord
<hi>Chancellor</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> From which MS. <hi>Of his Arguments
for an Hiſtoriographer and Remembrancer to the Order of the Garter,</hi> we
have extracted thus much of this Paragraph; and ſhall only obſerve, that
ſuch a diſcouragement of an Attempt <hi>to write Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtories and Lives of
ſuch Great Men, in the complete Circuite of their Stories,</hi> ſeems no
ways wonderful. For this is <hi>Biography</hi> in its ſtrict Senſe; which
is of a ſearching Nature; and, however uſeful or acceptable to the
generality, as irkſome to ſome Thoughts, as Light to ſome Eyes; yea, may
be as terrible to ſome among the Living, as to others, the Expectation of
being <hi>anatomiz'd</hi> when they are dead. However King <hi>Charles</hi>
re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded this Author, who thus <hi>ennobled</hi> even the moſt
<hi>Noble</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like a Prince, who deſerved to be, as he was, the
<hi>Sovereign</hi> thereof, with Places of above a <hi>Thouſand Pounds</hi> a
Year; and not long after the Book was publiſh'd, and inſcrib'd to his
Majeſty, Mr. <hi>Aſhmole</hi> further received, a Privy Seal out of the
Cuſtom of Paper, for <hi>Four Hundred Pounds,</hi> as we find in the
<hi>Diary,</hi> he left behind him, of his own <hi>Life.</hi>

ſlender Bulk of the Book; nor is it here tranſlated into Verſe, as they
might alſo expect, in imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Original, and as nothing appears to
the contrary in the Title above, printed at the End: but it is rather a
Reduction of that <hi>Epic Poem</hi> to an <hi>hiſtorical</hi> Narrative in
<hi>Proſe;</hi> which, tho' a commendable Undertaking at that time, to
familiarize the Contents; yet, as it is but a Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of a

alſo many better Tranſlations, even in Verſe, directly from it; the very
Table of Heads, no leſs than ſixty-five, cannot be in this Place
deſirable Therefore, we ſhall only refer to a Note at Bottom<note n="*" place="bottom">And firſt, of the <hi>French Author</hi>; who as he begins his
Work ſo high as the Building of <hi>Troy</hi> by <hi>Priamus,</hi> ſo he
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues it beyond the Slaughter of <hi>Turnus</hi> by <hi>Aeneas,</hi> to
the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of his Son <hi>Aſcanius,</hi> and two or three
Suceſſions beyond. Moreover, towards the beginning of his Work, that is, in
<hi>Chapter</hi> 6, he has a Digreſſion upon <hi>Bocace,</hi> for relating
the Story of <hi>Dido</hi> in his <hi>Fall of Princes,</hi> differently from
<hi>Virgil,</hi> and recites his Account as well as that of his Author. And in

<hi>becauſe 'tis feign'd, and not to be believed</hi>; as if ſeveral other

to paſs to the Tranſlator and <hi>Printer,</hi> we obſerve his Style to
be more <hi>ornate</hi> (as he calls it) or dreſs'd up in ſuperfine Words,
eſpecially of the <hi>French</hi> Extract, than we believe it would have
been, had he not ſubmitted it to the Correction. It is more regularly printed
than that former of his, deſcribed in our laſt Number; as not running out,

contains ſuch obſervable Proofs of the fleeting Faſhions in our

upon a Style, or Manner of Expreſſion, more than the Matter expreſſed,
that will not, like moſt other things, become obſolete, but maintain its

               <p>This <hi>Preface,</hi> containing near two Leaves, is as follows: 
<q rend="inline">"After dyverſe Werkes made, tranſlated and

many dyverſe Paunflettis and Bookys, happened that to my Hande cam a lytyl
Booke in <hi>Frenſhe,</hi> which late was tranſlated out of <hi>Latyn</hi>
by ſome Noble Clerke of <hi>Fraunce</hi>; whiche Booke is named
<hi>Eneydos,</hi> made in <hi>Latyn</hi> by that noble Poete and grete Clerke
<hi>Vyrgyle.</hi> Which Booke I ſawe over and redde therein; how after the

olde Fader <hi>Anchiſes</hi> upon his Sholdres, his lityl Son <hi>Yolus</hi>
on his Honde; his Wyfe wyth moche other People followynge; and how he ſhypped
and departed, wyth alle th Hyſtorye of his Adventures, that he had 'er he cam
to the Achievement of his Conqueſt of <hi>Ytalye,</hi> as all a longe ſhall
be ſhewed in this preſent Boke. In which Booke I had grete Playſyr, by
cauſe of the fayr and honeſt Terms and Wordes in <hi>Frenſhe;</hi> which
I never ſawe to fore lyke, ne none ſo playſaunt, ne ſo wel ordred.
Which Booke, as me ſemed, ſholde be moche requyſite to Noble Men to

Places. Whiche Hiſtorye the ſayd <hi>Vyrgyle</hi> made in Metre. And whan I
had adviſed me in this ſayd Booke, I delybered and concluded to tranſlate
it into <hi>Englyſhe,</hi> and forthwyth toke a Pen and Ynke and wrote a Leef
or tweyne, which I overſawe agayn to corecte it: and whan I ſawe the fayr
and ſtraunge Termes therein, I doubted that it ſholde not pleaſe ſome
Gentylmen, whiche <pb n="129" facs="tcp:0570200100:156"/> late blamed me, ſaying, that in my

comyn Peple, and deſired me to uſe olde and homely Termes in my
Tranſlacyons, and fayn wolde I ſatysfye every Man. And ſo to doo toke an
olde Boke and redde therein, and certaynly the <hi>Englysſhe</hi> was ſo
rude and brood, that I coude not well underſtande it. And alſo my Lord
Abbot of <hi>Weſtmynſter</hi> ded do ſhewe to me of late certayn
Evydences wryton in old <hi>Englisſhe,</hi> for to reduce it into our
<hi>Englysſhe</hi> now uſid; and certaynly it was wreton in ſuch wyſe,
that it was more lyke to <hi>Dutche</hi> than <hi>Englysſhe</hi>; I coude not
reduce ne brynge it to be underſtonden. And certaynly our Langage now uſed
varyeth ferre from that which was uſed and ſpoken whan I was born; for we
<hi>Englysſh</hi> Men ben borne un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Domynacyon of the <hi>Mone,</hi>
which is never ſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſte, but ever waverynge, wexyng one Seaſon, and
waneth and dyſcreaſeth another Seaſon; and that comyne
<hi>Englysſhe</hi> that is ſpoken in one Shyre varyeth from another. In
ſo muche, that in my dayes happened that certayn Merchauntes were in a Shipp
in <hi>Tamyſe,</hi> for to have ſayled over the See into <hi>Zelande</hi>;
and for lacke of Wynde they taryed atte <hi>Forlond,</hi> and went to lande for
to refreſhe them; and one of them named <hi>Sheffelde,</hi> a Mercer, came
into an Hows, and axed for Mete, and ſpecyally <hi>he axed for Eggs,</hi> and
the goode Wyf anſwerde, that <hi>ſhe coude ſpeke no Frenſhe</hi>; and
the Marchaunt was angry, for he alſo coude ſpeke no <hi>Frenſhe,</hi> but
wolde have hadde Egges, and ſhe underſtode hym not. And thenne at laſte
another ſayd, That <hi>he wolde have Eyren</hi>; then the good Wyf ſayd,
that ſhe underſtod him wel. Loo what ſholde a Man in thyſe Days wryte,
<hi>Egges</hi> or <hi>Eyren?</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taynly it is harde to playſe every Man,
by cauſe of Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſite and Chaunge of Langage. For in theſe Days every
Man, that is in ony Reputacyon in his Countre, will utter his Communicacyon and
Matters in ſuch Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and Termes, that fewe Men ſhall underſtonde
them; and ſom honeſt and grete Clerkes have ben wyth me, and deſired me
to wryte the moſte curyous Termes that I coude fynde. And thus bytween playn,
rude, and cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, I ſtand abasſhed. But in my Judgemente, the comyn
Termes that be dayli uſed ben lyghter to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtonde than the old
auncyent <hi>Englysſhe.</hi> And for as moche as this preſent Booke is not
for a rude uplondysſh <pb n="130" facs="tcp:0570200100:157"/> Man to laboure therin, ne rede
it, but only a Clerk and a noble Gentleman, that feleth and underſtondeth in
Fayles of Armes, in Love, and in noble Chyvalry; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>for in meane bytwene
bothe, I have reduced and tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this ſayd Booke into our
<hi>Englisſhe,</hi> not over rude, ne curyous; but in ſuch Termes as
ſhall be underſtanden by Goddys Grace accordyng to my Copye. And yf ony Man
wyll entermete in redyng of hit, and fyndeth ſuche Termes that he cannot
underſtande, late hym goo rede and lerne <hi>Vyrgyll,</hi> or the Pyſtles
of <hi>Ovyde,</hi> and ther he ſhall ſee and underſtande lightly all, yf
he have a good Redar and Enformer; for this Booke is not for every rude and
unconnynge Man to ſee, but Clerkys and very Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tylmen that underſtands
Gentylnes and Scyence. Then I praye alle theym that ſhall rede in this lytyl
Treatys to holde me for excuſed for the tranſlatynge of hit: For I
knowleche myſelfe ignorant of connynge to enpryſe on me ſo hie and noble
a Werke. But I praye Mayſter <hi>John Skelton,</hi> late created <hi>Poete
Laureate</hi> in the Unyverſite of <hi>Oxenforde,</hi> to overſee and
correcte this ſayd Booke; and taddreſſe and expowne where as ſhall be
founde faulte to theym that ſhall requyre it: For hym I knowe for
ſuffy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyent to expowne and <hi>Englysſhe</hi> every Dyfficulte that is
therein: For he hath late tranſlated the <hi>Epyſtles</hi> of
<hi>Tulle,</hi> and the Booke of <hi>Dyodorus Syculus,</hi> and diverſe other
Werkes oute of <hi>Latyn</hi> into <hi>Englisſhe,</hi> not in rude and olde
Langage, but in polysſhed and ornate Termes craftely; as he that hath redde
<hi>Vyrgyle, Ovyde, Tullye,</hi> and all the other noble Poetes and Oratours,
to me unknowen: And alſo he hath redde the IX Muſes, and underſtands
their muſicalle Scyences, and to whom of them eche Scyence is appropred: I
ſuppoſe he hath dronken of <hi>Elycon</hi>'s Well. Then I praye hym, and
ſuch other, to correcte, adde, or mynysſhe, whereas he, or they, ſhall
fynde faulte; for I have but folowed my Copye in <hi>Frensſhe,</hi> as nygh
as me is poſſible. And yf ony Worde be ſayd therin well, I am glad; and
yf otherwyſe, I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mytte my ſaid Boke to theyr Correctyon: which Boke I

               <p>THO' there is no Date in the <hi>Title Page</hi> of this
Hiſtory, we have ventured to add the ſame that appears at the End of the
<hi>Dedication,</hi> which is made thereof to <hi>the Right Worſhipful Sir
Philip Sidney,</hi> by the ſaid Dr. <hi>Powel.</hi> Herein, this Editor,
inſtead of extolling the noble Gifts and Vertues in his ſaid Patron, which
were conſpicuous to all Men, exhorts him to the diligent Exerciſe of them;
and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, from thoſe domeſtick Examples, his noble
<hi>Father,</hi> conſtantly inclined more to benefit even <hi>Wales</hi> and
<hi>Ireland,</hi> beſides his own Country, than himſelf; and his honourable
Father-in-Law, Sir <hi>Francis Walſingham,</hi> the Queen's Chief Secretary;
whoſe Zeal for God's Glory, and Love of thoſe who feared him unfeignedly,
was well known to the World. 
<q rend="inline">"Follow, ſays he, their Footſteps, with the
Remembrance of that noble Houſe out of which you are deſcended by your
honourable Mother; and then you cannot do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs. Labour, by the Example of

great Love and Commendation he govern'd) committed unto me <hi>this of
Wales,</hi> to be ſet forth in Print, with Direction to proceed therein, and
neceſſary Books for the doing thereof. And altho' I was unſufficient for
doing of it, yet I have done mine Endeavour; and now do preſent the ſame

               <p>From the Editor's <hi>Epiſtle to the Reader,</hi> his
<hi>Notes</hi> on the <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> and the Beginning thereof itſelf,
we learn, That this <hi>Succeſſion of the Britiſh Princes</hi> was the
Work of <hi>Carodoc</hi> of <hi>Lancarvan,</hi> from the Reign of
<hi>Cadwalader,</hi> the laſt <hi>Britiſh</hi> Monarch, over the <hi>whole
Iſland,</hi> (who fled into <hi>Armorica,</hi> or <hi>Bretagne,</hi> Anno
680, and died at <hi>Rome</hi> eight Years after, with whoſe Departure to
that Part of <hi>France,</hi> and a Liſt of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings
ruling there, this <hi>Hiſtory</hi> begins) down to ſome Years of <hi>Owen
Gwyneth</hi>'s Reign over that <hi>Part of the Iſland,</hi> now called
<hi>Wales</hi>; that is to the Year 1157, or the 3d of <hi>Henry</hi> II. King
of <hi>England,</hi> as may be ſeen, <hi>p.</hi> 206. The
<hi>Continuation</hi> which follows for 113 Years, from that time, was yearly
regiſter'd in the Abbeys of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way</hi> and <hi>Stratflur,</hi> down to
the Year 1270; or the 54th of our <hi>Henry</hi> III. which was a little before
the Death of the laſt <hi>Lhewelyn</hi>; and here ends this <hi>Britiſh
Chronicle;</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears <hi>p.</hi> 327. Many Copies remained of it, at
this time, in <hi>Wales;</hi> moſt of them 200 Years old; and one of them
coming to the hands of Mr. <hi>Humphrey Lhoyd,</hi> a learned and skillful
Antiquary, he tranſlated it into clear ſmooth <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and
continued it chiefly out of <hi>Matt. Paris,</hi> and <hi>Nicholas Trivet,</hi>
to the Slaughter of the ſaid Prince <hi>Lhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elyn,</hi> the laſt of
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Blood who had the Dominion of <hi>Wales,</hi> in 1282; or
the tenth of our <hi>Edward</hi> I. that is, to <hi>page</hi> 375 of this
Volume. But before this Tranſlation and Continuation were thoroughly
poliſhed by the ſaid <hi>H. Lhoyd,</hi> he was taken away by Death, in the
Flower of his Time. Yet the Copy of his Labour being procured, and preſerved
by Sir <hi>Henry Sidney,</hi> Lord Preſident of <hi>Wales,</hi> he prefer'd
our Editor, Dr. <hi>Powel,</hi> to the Care of its Publication; who, procuring
all the printed Hiſtories which treated of <hi>Wales,</hi> 
                  <pb n="133" facs="tcp:0570200100:160"/> and the Uſe of all <hi>John Stow</hi>'s MS.
Hiſtories, and many Books of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Pedegrees from the Lord
<hi>Burghley,</hi> with his Authority for ſearching all the <hi>Records</hi>;
did not only correct the ſaid Tranſlation, but put marginal References in
it to thoſe Hiſtorians who treated of the particular Facts, and additional
Notes, likewiſe throughout of Matters relating to <hi>Wales</hi> in thoſe
Hiſtorians, unmentioned in his Copy; alſo interſperſed the ſame with
many authentic In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, Records and Pedigrees; and laſtly made a
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Continuation <hi>Of the Princes of Wales of the Blood Royal of
England,</hi> and the <hi>Lords Preſident,</hi> down to his own Time; the
whole ending with the aforeſaid Sir <hi>Henry Sidney</hi> at <hi>page</hi>
401. So that Authors have been too indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, when they have quoted every
Part of this Book un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Name. Thus much for the general View; now to be a
little more particular.</p>
               <p>After the Editor's Epiſtle before mentioned, follows a
<hi>Deſcription of Cambria, now called Wales: Drawn firſt by</hi> Sir
<hi>John Priſe,</hi> and <hi>afterwards augmented by H. Lhoyd;</hi> and here
prefixed for the better underſtanding of this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory. Herein, upon the
Name of <hi>Wallia,</hi> there is Occaſion taken by the ſaid
<hi>Lhoyd,</hi> it ſeems, to make a liberal Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of <hi>Polydore
Virgil,</hi> being a Stranger, as well to many of our Hiſtories, as the
Tongues they are written in, and a Reference made to the <hi>Apology</hi> of
Sir <hi>John Priſe,</hi> and the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Hiſtory he purpoſely
writ againſt the envious Reports and ſlaunderous Taunts of the ſaid
<hi>Polydore</hi>; whoſe Errors in great number are there confuted. And it is
fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhewn, that <hi>Wales</hi> is a new and ſtrange Name, which the
<hi>Britains</hi> do not underſtand; that they know no other than
<hi>Cambry,</hi> nor of their Language than <hi>Cambraec,</hi> or the
<hi>Cambers</hi> Tongue; That they know not what <hi>England</hi> or
<hi>Engliſh</hi> means, but call the Country <hi>Lhoyger</hi> (from
<hi>Locrine</hi>) the <hi>Engliſhmen, Sayſon</hi>; and their Tongue
<hi>Sayſonaec</hi>; which is a Token this is the old <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Language: For the Works of <hi>Merdhyn</hi> and of <hi>Talieſſin,</hi> who
wrote above 1000 Years paſt, are almoſt the ſame Words as they uſe at
this Day, or at leaſt underſtood by all who know the <hi>Welſh
Tongue.</hi> Then he diſcourſes of the Three Remnants of the
<hi>Britains,</hi> in <hi>Wales, Cornwal,</hi> and little <hi>Britain,</hi> or
<hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne</hi> in <hi>France.</hi> The Bounds of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the
Diviſion thereof, into <hi>Three</hi> Territories, that is, <hi>North-Wales,
South-Wales,</hi> and <hi>Powys-Land</hi>; ſubdivided into their ſeveral 
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0570200100:161"/> 
                  <hi>Candreds,</hi> and <hi>Comots</hi>; and all
expreſs'd in their old <hi>Britiſh</hi> Names.</p>
               <p>Thus we come to the Hiſtory, which has a little wooden
<hi>Print</hi> at the Head of every Chapter or Prince's Reign, more for
Ornament, we preſume, than real Reſemblance; becauſe they are
diſcontinued at the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Princes of <hi>Wales,</hi> of whom
ſome true Repreſentation was more likely to be recovered. The Hiſtory is
too ſhort to be made ſhorter, by any thing that looks like an Epitomy;
beſides, it cannot prudently be deſired, we ſhould be ſo long confined
from the Deſcription of other Books, as to give an Abſtract of every
Prince's Reign in this. It may be therefore ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, that we here draw
out a <hi>Table</hi> of their <hi>Names,</hi> with a Chronology of their
<hi>Deaths,</hi> and the Names of thoſe Princes, who were their
<hi>Contemporaries</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> which will be of general Uſe in
Reading any other Piece of <hi>Welſh</hi> Hiſtory.</p>

im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic, thus to diſplay the moſt hazardous and the moſt generous

Scarcity or Obſcurity of a Work, ſo long ſince out of Print, may have
prevented its falling into thoſe able and happy Hands, as might, by ſuch an

that in the ſaid laſt printed Title Page, there is no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made of the
<hi>Cadiz</hi> Voyage; to omit which, might be one Reaſon of reprinting that
Page: For it being one of the moſt proſperous and honourable Enterprizes
that ever the Earl of <hi>Eſſex</hi> was ingaged in, and he falling into
the Queen's unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Diſpleaſure at this time, our Author, Mr.
<hi>Hakluyt,</hi> might probably receive Command or Direction, even from one of
the Patrons to whom theſe Voyages are dedicated, who was of the contrary
Faction, not only to ſuppreſs all Memorial of that Action in the Front of
this Book, but even cancel the whole <hi>Narrative</hi> thereof at the
<hi>End</hi> of it, in all the Copies (far the greateſt Part of the
Impreſſion) which remained unpub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed. And in that caſtrated Manner
the Volume has deſcended to Poſterity; not but if the Caſtration was
intended to have been concealed from us, the laſt Leaf of the Preface would
have been reprinted alſo, with the like Omiſſion of what is there
mentioned concerning the Inſertion of this Voyage. But at laſt, about the
middle of the late King's Reign, an uncaſtrated Copy did ariſe, and the
ſaid Voyage was reprinted from it; whereby many imperfect Books have been
made complete.</note>.</p>

               <p>THIS learned Treatiſe, being publiſhed after the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's
Death, is <hi>dedicated</hi> to the Archbiſhop of <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi> by
<hi>Robert Brerewood,</hi> who, as it is thought, did alſo compoſe the
<hi>Preface</hi> to the Reader, ſhewing the <hi>Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions</hi> the Author
had to write the enſuing <hi>Diſcourſe;</hi> and briefly deſcribing the
general State of <hi>Proteſtants</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> for a Supply to the
ſaid Work.</p>
               <p>It is divided into <hi>Twenty-ſeven Chapters</hi>; and treats,
<hi>firſt, Of the antient Largeneſs</hi> or Extent <hi>of the</hi> Greek
<hi>Tongue,</hi> and the Cauſes thereof, with its Declenſion, upon the
Inundation of the <hi>Saracens,</hi> about 640 Years after our Saviour, in the
Time of <hi>Heraclius</hi> the Emperor. 2. More particularly <hi>of the Decay
of the antient pure Greek,</hi> and of the preſent vulgar <hi>Greek</hi>;
nevertheleſs that the preſent Language does not ſo much decline from the
ancient <hi>Greek,</hi> as the <hi>Italian</hi> departs from the
<hi>Latin,</hi> according to <hi>Bello<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius:</hi> for that there were
Corruptions, even in the ancient <hi>Greek</hi>; however, it is concluded, that
the Skilful in the learned <hi>Greek</hi> cannot underſtand the
<hi>vulgar.</hi> 3. <hi>Of the Extent of the Roman Tongue in the time of the
Roman Empire,</hi> with the Cauſes of its ſpreading, and in what Parts of
the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire it was moſt ſpoken: That it was little reſpected in the
<hi>Eaſtern</hi> Parts thereof, and why. 4. <hi>That the Roman Tongue
aboliſhed not the vulgar Languages in the foreign Provinces of the Roman
Empire,</hi> but that near fourteen Tongues here mention'd (in which Number the
<hi>Engliſh, Italian, Spaniſh,</hi> 
                  <pb n="160" facs="tcp:0570200100:187"/> and
<hi>French,</hi> are not reckoned, our Author inſtancing only Original or
Mother Languages) were in <hi>Europe</hi> in the Time of the <hi>Roman</hi>
Empire, and ſix or ſeven of them within the Limits of it. From hence it is
obſerved, how hard it is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plant vulgar Languages in populous
Countries: That neither the <hi>Punic,</hi> nor the <hi>Gallic,</hi> the
<hi>Spaniſh,</hi> or <hi>Pannonian</hi> Tongue was aboliſhed by the
<hi>Romans</hi>; and that the <hi>Latin</hi> was nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther generally nor
perfectly ſpoken in the <hi>Provinces.</hi> 5. <hi>Of the beginning of the
Italian, French, and Spaniſh Languages</hi>; with the Ruin of the
<hi>Roman</hi> Empire, when, and by whom; and that Barbarous Nations were not
the firſt Authors of thoſe degenerate Languages, but rather Promoters of
their Corruptions. 6. <hi>Objections touching the Extent of the Latin Tongue
anſwered;</hi> That it was never purely ſpoken in the foreign Provinces;
that there were great Changes in it; whereof, he concludes with a pregnant
Example from the Inſcription upon that naval Column (they call it
<hi>Columnam Roſtratam,</hi> being deck'd with the Beaks of Ships) in the
Capitol at <hi>Rome</hi>; which Inſcription, tho' compoſed not above 150
Years before the Tongue ſhone in its full Luſtre under <hi>Cicero,</hi> has
not one Word in it ſpell'd like the later <hi>Latin</hi> that is ſubjoined:
An Example which may give the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue ſome Countenance,
tho' our Author does men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an Inſtance or two alſo of its Mutability,
ſince it is in a far larger Compaſs of Years. 7. <hi>Of the Ancient
Languages of Italy, Spain, France, and Africa:</hi> That the <hi>Punics</hi> of
<hi>Afri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> were originally <hi>Canaanites</hi> or <hi>Phoenicians,</hi>
and that the <hi>Punic</hi> Language was the old <hi>Hebrew</hi> Tongue; and
tho' that <hi>Punic</hi> Speech in <hi>Plautus,</hi> which is the only Specimen
of it extant, hath no great Affinity with the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> yet 'tis
im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Corruptions of Tranſcription. 8. <hi>Of the great Extent of
the Slavonic, Turkiſh, and Arabic Tongues.</hi> 9. <hi>Of the Syriac and
Hebrew Tongues</hi>; the Beginning and Change of the <hi>Syriac</hi>; the
Difference of <hi>Hebrew</hi> from <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee</hi> and <hi>Syriac</hi>; the
<hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Chaldee</hi> Tranſlations read in the Synagogues. 10.
<hi>Of the ſundry Parts of the World in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited by Chriſtians</hi>; that
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> were mingled with <hi>Mahometans</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi>;
the weak State of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi>; the Dimenſions
of the Kingdom of <hi>Abeſſia</hi>; the State of Chriſtianity in
<hi>Aſia,</hi> its Regions and Iſlands; and its Declenſion in the
<hi>Eaſt Parts</hi> thereof; with the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtianity in
<hi>America.</hi> 11. <hi>Of the Parts of the World poſſeſſed by
Mahumetans;</hi> the large Extent of <hi>Mahumetiſm</hi> in <hi>Africa</hi>
and in <hi>Aſia</hi>; and why ſo mightily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. 
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0570200100:188"/> 12. <hi>Of the ſundry Regions in the World inhabited
by Idolaters</hi>; what Part of <hi>Africa</hi> poſſeſſed by them, and
what Parts of <hi>Aſia</hi>; their vaſt Extent in <hi>America.</hi> 13.
<hi>Of the Jews diſperſed in ſeveral Parts of the World;</hi> the State
of them in <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa. Tartars</hi> ſuſpected
to be of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> Race: That <hi>Americans</hi> are the
Progeny of the <hi>Tartars</hi>: That many Nations are circumciſed beſides
the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and therefore that Circumciſion is no ſure Token
of Deſcent from them: That the <hi>Tartarians</hi> are not the Offspring of
the <hi>Iſraelites:</hi> That the ſecond Book of <hi>Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras</hi>
contradicts the Scripture: That the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> departed not out of
the Dominion of <hi>Aſſyria</hi>: that <hi>Arſareth</hi> was a feigned
Manſion of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi>; and that their Voyage and remote
Retirement favours of the ſame <hi>Talmudisal</hi> Spirit with that other
Tale of the reaſon why God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the Sea for the <hi>Whale,</hi> and the
Land for the <hi>Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant,</hi> becauſe they were too big to be Inhabitants
together in either of thoſe Elements; whereupon we have a Digreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
upon the Dimenſions of thoſe two Animals; the Deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Sea, and
Height of Mountains; that the Sea is not higher than the Land, and the Depth of
the Sea more than the Height of the Mountains; the great Declivity of the Face
of the Land, and great Deepneſs of the Sea. 14. <hi>Of the Quantity and
Proportion of the Parts of the Earth poſſeſſed by the ſeveral Sorts
of the above-mentioned Religions</hi>; as, the Proportion of
<hi>Chriſtians</hi> to <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Idolaters</hi>; the vaſt
greatneſs of the <hi>South</hi> Continent, and of the <hi>Antartic</hi>
Continent. 15. <hi>Of the divers Sorts or Sects of Chriſtians in the World,
and of their ſeveral Regions: And firſt of the Grecians:</hi> The large
Juriſdiction of the Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and by what Means
encreaſed; the Properties of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Religion. 16. Of the
<hi>Aſſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> or <hi>Melchites</hi>; their Religion differs not from
the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians</hi>; the Patriarch of <hi>Antioch</hi>'s Juriſdiction
diſtracted. 17. <hi>Of the Georgians, Circaſſians and Mengrellians,</hi>
with their Religion. 18. <hi>Of the Muſcovites,</hi> and the Properties or
Principles of their Religion. 19. <hi>Of the Neſtorians,</hi> and how far
ſpread in the Orient; their Patriarch ſeated in <hi>Muſal;</hi> the
Properties or Principles of their Religion. 20. <hi>Of the Indians or
Chriſtians of St. Thomas,</hi> and their Habitation; that they were
<hi>Neſtorians,</hi> and became of the <hi>Roman</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; Properties
of the ancient <hi>Indian</hi> Religion; and that the New Teſtament in
<hi>Syriac</hi> is no ancient Tranſlation. 21. <hi>Of the Jacobites;</hi> the
Antiquity and Seat of their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch; <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0570200100:189"/> Properties of

               <p>THIS curious Book, containing the Author's
<hi>Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> on the Treatment and Conteſts of <hi>foreign
Ambaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſadors</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> from the Year 1612, to the Year

               <p>The Editor, in his Dedication to <hi>Philip</hi> Lord Viſcount

acquitted himſelf with great Honour and Fidelity: whereupon King

Grant of the Office of <hi>Maſter of the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies</hi>; which came to his
Poſſeſſion by the Death of Sir <hi>Lewis,</hi> 10th of <hi>March</hi>
1626. During his whole Service, he applied himſelf with great Aſſiduity;
retiring only when Occaſion would ſerve, to his Country-houſe at
<hi>Twittenham.</hi> It was his conſtant Maxim to give the leaſt Occaſion
to, and avoid as much as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, the too nice Punctillios of
<hi>Procedence</hi> between Ambaſſadors; which ſeldom fail to breed
Animoſities in their Sovereigns: And, by this means, he was not only much
eſteemed by the Ambaſſadors, which turned greatly to his Advantage, with
regard to their uſual Preſents; but he likewiſe prevented the Trouble
that wou'd have enſued to his Majeſty, of hearing their frivolous
Complaints. As to this Work, it was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Method, as appears by the
Editor's <hi>Dedication,</hi> to couch in Writing, what things paſſed in
his Province, not only for his own, but for the Information of others; and his
Notes were more than once, as appears by his own Words, produced to the Lord
<hi>Chamberlain</hi> to regulate by Precedents the Differences which happened
between Ambaſſadors: And in one of his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, <hi>page</hi> 129.

<hi>that theſe Obſervations</hi> ſhou'd be made publick; and to every one
in that Province, they may, no doubt, be of great Uſe and Inſtruction. And
they may be of further and ſtill greater Uſe, as well in illuſtrating
ſome Parts of Monſ. <hi>Wiquefort,</hi> as the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Hiſtory
in that Period, well known to have ſo much abounded in Embaſſies, and in
the Particulars whereof our Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians of thoſe Times are very deficient,
not having had the Light of theſe Obſervations. <hi>Anthony Wood,</hi> who
informs us, that he lived to the Age of 70 Years, and died in 1641, yet gives
us no Account how long he remained in his Office, nor why he ſo abruptly
diſcontinued his Obſervations. But we have heard there now is an original
or authentick MS. of them in being, which might give further Intelligence in
this Particular.</note>."</q>

               <p>THIS Work, by the Title, ſeemingly confined to the remarkable
Productions of <hi>Nature,</hi> only in <hi>one</hi> Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; therefore, under
that Conſideration alone, particularly engaging to all ingenious
<hi>Natives</hi> thereof, is nevertheleſs ſuch an extenſive Field of
curious and inſtructive Matter, ſo various in its kinds, yet connected by
ſuch eaſy Tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and ſupported by ſuch pertinent Parallels, as
have rendered it of a more general or comprehenſive Nature; ſo as to become
a Pattern, tho' ſcarcely equal'd, to ſeveral <hi>Writers,</hi> who have
attempted the Illuſtration of other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in the like manner, and may
indeed be coveted by all <hi>Readers,</hi> who delight in <hi>natural</hi>
Knowledge.</p>
               <p>It is dedicated by the Author to King <hi>James,</hi> becauſe of
the Approbation his Majeſty had ſhewn to his <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of
<hi>Oxford</hi>; and after his ſhort <hi>Preface,</hi> we have the

It is graved on a large Sheet, folding in, by <hi>Joſeph Brown,</hi> having

<hi>Explanation</hi> prefixed, and an <hi>alphabetical</hi> Liſt of all the

               <p>As to his Method; that which he formerly preſcribed himſelf in
his <hi>Natural Hiſtory of Oxfordſhire,</hi> being approv'd of, he follows
the ſame here; whereby the whole Work is divided into <hi>Ten Chapters</hi>;
which are interſperſed with <hi>thirty-ſeven</hi> Copper <hi>Prints</hi>
of the chief <hi>Seats</hi> and <hi>Views, Curioſities</hi> of
<hi>Nature,</hi> and <hi>Antiquities</hi> found in the County; each Print
inſcribed to the Owners of thoſe Seats, or other eminent Natives of the
ſaid Shire. <hi>Chapter</hi> I. treats of what has been obſervable among
them <hi>in the Heavens and Air</hi>; as, particularly, the Remark of the
<hi>Moorland</hi> Inhabitants upon the <hi>Sun-ſet,</hi> in the Summer
Solſtice; alſo the <hi>Mock-Suns</hi> frequent in this County. Remarkable
<hi>Rainbows,</hi> as, of the Moon, and <hi>Halo's</hi> of the Sun. Strange
Effects of <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightning</hi>; with an elaborate
Digreſſion upon <hi>Fairy Circles</hi>; which tho' he indulges ſo far the
Accounts of <hi>Remigius</hi> and others, who impute the <hi>ſame</hi> to
Wizards and Witches, as to recite them; yet, at laſt, more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably imputes
them to Lightning. Then we come to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on Animals, eſpecially on the
mortal Effects of <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> upon Crevices and Lobſters. Several
ſtrange <hi>Meteors. Noiſes</hi> in <hi>the Air.</hi> Extraordinary
<hi>Hail</hi> Storms, and prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>Showers,</hi> particularly of Frogs,
Maggots, <hi>&amp;c. Prog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noſticks</hi> of <hi>Showers</hi> and
<hi>Winds</hi>; of the <hi>Tornado</hi> Wind; and uncommon <hi>Echoes</hi>;
which, with an Experiment upon <hi>Sounds,</hi> and ſome ſhort
Obſervations on the <hi>Comet</hi> in 1681, ends this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Chap. II. <hi>Of the Waters.</hi> This is introduced with a
<hi>Diſcourſe</hi> of nine Pages upon the <hi>Effects</hi> of <hi>Air</hi>
on human Bodies. And, among many other Obſervations, ſome on Unction and
Painting of the Body, to prevent the Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations thereof, from <hi>Roger
Bacon.</hi> The Choice of healthy Situations, with many Examples; which brings
him to the Conſideration of <hi>Waters,</hi> by which the Air is ſo much
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. Several Remarks on the pure Streams and <hi>Waters</hi> of
<hi>common Uſe</hi> in this County, and particularly the refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pool
of <hi>Madely,</hi> mentioned by <hi>Gervaſe</hi> of <hi>Tilbury.</hi>
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Health in the <hi>Moorlands,</hi> from the Age of twelve
Tenants who made up 1000 Years, and four, who made 360 Years. Then ſpeaks of
the more <hi>unuſual Waters</hi>; their Diſcolourations, Prognoſtications
of Rain and Dearth, <pb n="177" facs="tcp:0570200100:204"/> Noiſineſs, Inconſtancy of
Flowing, and Intermiſſions; in Examples from <hi>Hobbes</hi> and
<hi>Cotton, Alex. Neckham, Will.</hi> of <hi>Newberry, Sylveſter</hi> the
Poet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here we have a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion upon the Queſtion,
<hi>Whether Springs are ſupply'd from the Rains, &amp;c. or from the
Sea.</hi> Obſervations on the Quantity of Water thrown out by perennial
Springs. Sir <hi>Chr. Wren</hi>'s Invention of the Rain-Bucket, to meaſure
the Quantity that falls. Computations of what the greateſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers throw
forth in an Hour, Day, Year. The many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples favouring the Origin or Supply
of Springs from ſubtertaneous Communications. Then proceeds to the
<hi>Rivers</hi> and <hi>Fountains</hi> of this <hi>County,</hi> which have
yielded any unuſual Remarks; ſome running under ground, and riſing again;
ſome throwing up little Bones; ſome never freez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſome warmeſt in
the coldeſt Weather; ſome ſalt, as the <hi>Brine-Pits,</hi> with the
manner of <hi>Salt-work;</hi> ſome again are <hi>Vitrioline</hi>; ſome
<hi>Petrifying,</hi> and ſome <hi>Sulphureous.</hi> Here we are led to the
<hi>Medicinal</hi> Waters; among theſe, ſuch as are of a <hi>milky
Nature,</hi> and others <hi>aluminous.</hi> Some of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute for curing the
King's-Evil; ſome good for the Eyes; and ſome of noxious Quality, as the
Coal-pit Waters which kill the Fiſh of thoſe Rivers into which they
fall.</p>
               <p>Chap. III. <hi>Of the Earths.</hi> This begins with the Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the County, Nature, and Fertility of the Soil. K. <hi>James</hi> his
ſaying of it for the Firmneſs of the Highways. A Remark upon ſome
Paſtures, which tinged the Teeth of Cattle, of a Golden Colour; and upon
others, which changed the Colour of their Hides. A Pit that never held any
Water when it filled all others. Deductions from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks upon ſome
Buildings, tending to prove the Earth will be quite <hi>level.</hi> Of
<hi>Earths</hi> that <hi>vegetate</hi> or grow up, and <hi>Floating
Iſlands.</hi> Of turfing their mooriſh Grounds, and the rotten
<hi>Shining</hi> Earth. Here we have many curious Inſtances of luciferous
Bodies, animate, and inanimate. Their different <hi>Kinds</hi> of
<hi>Earths</hi> and <hi>Clays</hi>; and how the <hi>Potters</hi> work the
ſame. Of their <hi>Earths</hi> uſed by Painters in <hi>Colours, Sulphurs,
Bitumen,</hi> and <hi>Pit-Coal,</hi> with the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of its <hi>Mines.</hi>
Remarks on their <hi>Damps,</hi> and firing of Mines: Of Earthquakes there,
thought to be cauſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. Signs for finding of Coal: Of working it, and
keeping it dry.</p>
               <p>Chap. IV. <hi>Of Stones.</hi> The Cauſes of their Production;
Obſervations on Salt in Stones, and ſuch as beſt endure the Fire. Of
<hi>Limeſtone,</hi> and the <hi>Pyrites</hi>; and the <hi>Biſhops
Stones</hi> 
                  <pb n="178" facs="tcp:0570200100:205"/> near <hi>Weeford,</hi> why ſo called. Then
we come to the <hi>Iron</hi> Ore, with the melting and working it; alſo the
<hi>Copper</hi> Ores, and their Works; then to the <hi>Lead</hi> Ores, where we
have an Account of a Leaden Coffin that ſwam in nine In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches Water, with the
<hi>hydroſtatical</hi> Reaſon for it. Hence we come to the
<hi>Quarries</hi> and their Stones for Building, Grinding, and the Mills; with
an Experiment giving rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to believe the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> is to be
found at <hi>Rowley Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis.</hi> Next of the Rocks, Cliffs, and Caves, which
have any thing remarkable; their Alabaſter, and the kind of Marble, whereof
their <hi>Chimney-pieces, Tombſtones, Emery,</hi> &amp;c. are made. Alſo of
their <hi>Crowſtones,</hi> and tranſparent <hi>Pebbles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Chap. V. <hi>Of Formed Stones.</hi> And firſt of thoſe
reſembling heavenly Bodies, as the <hi>Selenites</hi> or
<hi>Moon-ſtones,</hi> more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally called <hi>Lapis Specularis,</hi>
found in this County; and the <hi>Aſteriae,</hi> or <hi>Star-Stones,</hi> of
different kind from any yet deſcribed, whoſe unaccountable Quality of
moving towards one another in Vinegar is here obſerved to have been known 400
Years ſince, by the learned <hi>Roger Bacon.</hi> He ſpeaks next of the
<hi>Thunder Stones,</hi> as they are commonly called, found in thoſe Parts,
and others repreſenting the Parts of Birds; <hi>Cryſtalline</hi> Stones; a
kind of <hi>Honeycomb</hi> Stones, full of ſweetiſh Liquor; many Stones
reſembling <hi>Sea Fiſhes,</hi> eſpecially of the <hi>teſtaceous</hi>
Kind. Of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like Trees, and other
<hi>Ores</hi> alſo, into odd Figures. Stones alſo form'd like particular
Vegetables, as the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gites,</hi> likewiſe <hi>Mineral Corals,</hi> like
Stumps of Trees, and the <hi>Vertebrae</hi> of Fiſhes; like Fruits and the
Stones of them; Animals and their ſeveral Parts; Buttons, Barrels, Saddles,
and ſome Plants found with <hi>Rings</hi> of Stone, Iron, and Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
naturally growing about them.</p>
               <p>Chap. VI. <hi>Of Plants.</hi> Among which, none ſo remarkable
for reſembling certain Parts of the human Body, as the <hi>Fungus
Phalloides,</hi> or <hi>Phallus Hollandicus</hi> of <hi>Hadr. Junius.</hi>
After ſeveral uncommon Obſervations among the <hi>herba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ccous</hi> Kind, he
advances to ſome undeſcribed <hi>Shrubs</hi>; as the <hi>White-Berried
Elder,</hi> Standard <hi>Honey-Suckles,</hi> and <hi>Ivy.</hi> A <hi>Vine</hi>
changing its Fruit from Red to White, St. <hi>Bertram's Aſh,</hi> with a
narrower Leaf than uſual, a yellow-leav'd <hi>Yew Tree,</hi> a
blood-ſpotted <hi>Birch,</hi> yellow-leav'd <hi>Thorn</hi>; and among the
Trees unnoted to be of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Growth, the <hi>Sorbus
Pyriformis,</hi> and one kind of <hi>Firr:</hi> And among the Accidents of
Trees, ſome of extraordinary ſpeedy Growth. <pb n="179" facs="tcp:0570200100:206"/>
                  <hi>Oaks</hi> of vaſt Bulk and extenſive Shade; more particularly Sir
<hi>Harvey Bagot</hi>'s <hi>Witch-Elm,</hi> growing at <hi>Field,</hi> within
Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory; which was 120 Foot long, 17 Yards round at the Bottom, had 14 Load of
Fire-Wood broke off in the Fall, 47 Load more of Fire-Wood cut from the Top,
8000 Foot of <hi>Plank,</hi> 80 Pair of <hi>Naves, &amp;c.</hi> in ſhort
computed to contain 96 Tons of Timber, after their Country way of reckoning;
but, according to our Author, at leaſt 100 Ton of neat Timber. With this is
mentioned, as what might equal it in Height, the Oak which yielded a Plank
above 25 Yards long, and near one Yard broad, of which was made the Table at
<hi>Dudley</hi> Caſtle. From this we are led to the tall <hi>Firrs</hi> at
<hi>Norbury</hi>; one of which was 47 Yards high; and thence, to what is
obſervable in the <hi>Roots</hi> of Trees, as their embracing and lifting up
great Stones; Trees of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Species uniting at the Roots, or in the
Trunks, and ſome Trees growing out of the Bodies and Heads of others; but
above all, thoſe found buried under Ground in all Countries, are reckoned
moſt unaccountable. Here we have an elaborate Diſſertation upon thoſe
<hi>ſubterraneous Trees,</hi> by ſome call'd <hi>Moſs-wood,</hi> with the
Cauſe of Moſſes, ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Hills, and raiſing of Valleys. Hence we
paſs to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Notice of what was moſt uncommon in Trees; as the
<hi>Cylindraceous</hi> Cavities in an old Crab Tree here deſcribed, with the
Cauſe; leading us to the ſtrange Diſcovery of Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals in the Bodies of
Trees, as <hi>Field Mice,</hi> which are ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly pegg'd up by
the Country People here, to make <hi>Nurſrow</hi> Trees, as they call them,
to cure Swellings in their Cattle; and other Inſtances of their
Superſtition, in the Wood of the <hi>Quicken</hi> Tree, for walking Staves.
Here end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Remarks on <hi>Whole Trees,</hi> and their <hi>Trunks,</hi>
with an Obſervation, that the Timber of this County is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally large and
good, particularly the Woods in the Park of <hi>John Offley,</hi>
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> whereof 1000 Trees might be choſen worth 8000 Pounds, and
of theſe 100 worth 1500 Pounds; he proceeds to unuſual Accidents in the
<hi>Branches, Fruits,</hi> and <hi>Leaves</hi> of Trees; upon which laſt he
accounts for the <hi>Excreſcences</hi> by Inſects, and the
<hi>Variegations</hi> or Stripings in <hi>Hollys, Maples, Aſhes,</hi> and
<hi>Oaks</hi> he met with. From thence paſſes to <hi>Fruit Trees,</hi> as
the large <hi>ſpreading Apple Tree</hi> at <hi>Leigh,</hi> having borne 50
Strike of Apples in a Year; <hi>Pear Trees</hi> bloſſoming at
<hi>Chriſtmas</hi>; another that bloſſom'd and bore twice a Year. The
<hi>Orange</hi> and <hi>Lemon</hi> growing on one Tree, and in one Fruit; the
Quantity of <hi>Cyder</hi> 
                  <pb n="180" facs="tcp:0570200100:207"/> that might be made in one
Pariſh; large Cherry Gardens, and great <hi>Variety</hi> of Fruits in the
Gardens of <hi>Rowland Oke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> as 60 Sorts of Apples,
35 Sorts of Apricots, and other Plums, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with which Enumeration
this Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ends.</p>
               <p>Chap. VII. <hi>Of Brutes.</hi> Under which is comprehended
<hi>Birds, Inſects, Fiſhes, Reptiles</hi> and <hi>Quadrupeds,</hi> and of
theſe only ſuch as are undeſcribed by others, unnoted by
<hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lughby</hi> and <hi>Ray</hi> to be <hi>indaginae</hi> of this County,
or have had extraordinary Accidents attending them. And firſt he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with
<hi>Birds</hi>; among theſe he reckons a kind of Gooſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legg'd
<hi>Swans,</hi> and the black-bill'd <hi>Gooſe,</hi> with a Voice like a
Bittern; an undeſcribed <hi>Loon</hi> or <hi>Ducker,</hi> creſted, horned,
and bearded; the <hi>Eagle,</hi> the <hi>Shriek, Heathcock,</hi> or Black Game,
<hi>Gorcock,</hi> or Red Game, the <hi>Martlet,</hi> Ground <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,
Brambling, Groſs-beak, Heron,</hi> and great <hi>Loon:</hi> but moſt
remarkable is his Hiſtory of the <hi>Pewits,</hi> and their breeding only
upon the Eſtate of Sir <hi>Charles Skrymſher,</hi> at the old
<hi>Pewit-Pool</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>Norbury,</hi> and
<hi>Shebben-Pool</hi> in the Pariſh of <hi>High-Offley</hi>; where they
encreaſed in ſuch abundance, that 50 Dozen has been taken at a Dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving;
which, at five Shillings a Dozen, the ancient Price, comes to twelve Pounds ten
Shillings; but ſome Years the Profit of them has amounted to fifty or
threeſcore Pounds: and we have here a Repreſentation, in Sculpture, of
<hi>Shebben-Pool,</hi> with the manner of driving and taking theſe Birds.
Next he obſerves what has been extraordinary in the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, Limbs, Eggs,
and Time of Production among Birds; as <hi>Popinjays, Crows,</hi> and
<hi>Sparrows</hi> that were white; Croſs-bill'd <hi>Ravens</hi>; a
four-legg'd <hi>Pewit,</hi> and three-legg'd <hi>Gooſe</hi>; with the
Opinions of <hi>Fabricius</hi> and Dr. <hi>Harvey,</hi> that ſuch Deformities
ariſe from <hi>double yolked Eggs,</hi> &amp;c. Next we have Obſervations
upon white yolked <hi>Eggs,</hi> and Eggs all Yolk. Of <hi>Hens</hi> and
<hi>Ducks,</hi> that laid at the rate of three Eggs a Day, and of Birds
hatching in the Winter. Then we come to flying Inſects, as the winged
<hi>Glow-worm,</hi> or <hi>Lanthorn-Fly</hi>; the white <hi>Ear-wigg.</hi> Of
<hi>viviparous</hi> Inſects, <hi>Spiders,</hi> and their Webs, with ſome
<hi>aquatic</hi> Inſects, unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed; which leads to <hi>Fiſhes,</hi>
and his Account of the <hi>Burbot</hi> or <hi>Bird-bolt,</hi> not before, or
not well deſcribed. Of Fiſhes found in unuſual Places. Of the uncommon
Nature of <hi>Eels,</hi> that they are <hi>viviparous,</hi> travel from one
Water to another, and the Account of their <hi>equivocal Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration.</hi> How
various the Food or <hi>Prey</hi> of Fiſhes; how <pb n="181" facs="tcp:0570200100:208"/>
                  <hi>voracious</hi> ſome of them, and others reſtor'd to their Element after
they had been ſwallowed up. The unuſual <hi>Magnitude</hi> of Fiſhes,
particularly a <hi>Carp</hi> weighing 15 Pounds, with <hi>Scales</hi> as broad
as a Half-Crown: <hi>Jacks</hi> a Yard and half long. Thus paſſing from the
Water to the Land Animals, he begins with the <hi>Toad,</hi> and how
ſtrangely ſome have been found excluded from both Elements in the midſt
of ſolid Blocks of Stone, and in the Bodies of ſound Trees. Then we have an
Account of an undeſcribed Land <hi>Lizard,</hi> a ſtrange toothed
<hi>Rabbit,</hi> uncommon Accidents in a <hi>Hare,</hi> and other Animals
breeding their Young; and an odd Mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Breed of <hi>Dogs.</hi> Of

prevents <hi>Horns</hi> in ſome Animals, and enlarges them in others. Of
uncommon Accidents in Sheep, Deer, Cows, Oxen, Horſes, as to Heading,
Breeding, Superfoetation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of <hi>Hair Balls</hi> found in the
Stomachs of ſuch Animals; and <hi>Shining Tallow:</hi> Concluding with a
Deſcription of the true <hi>Hippomanes,</hi> or Forehead Fleſh of a new

<hi>Love-Potions</hi>; and an Account of the Jaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone of an <hi>Elephant,</hi>
found in this County.</p>
               <p>Chap. VIII. <hi>Of Men and Women.</hi> Beginning with an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
of one who was neither. Of Men getting Children at 104 Years of Age. Of
<hi>Longing</hi> in Women, and diſmem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the <hi>Foetus</hi> like the
Object which gave the Fright. Some who had all the <hi>Signs</hi> of
<hi>Pregnancy,</hi> without being with Child; others having a Child without the
Signs. Of Children born with Teeth. Monſtrous and imperfect Births. Of the
Perſons born in this County, who were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent <hi>Churchmen, Lawyers,</hi>
and <hi>Authors,</hi> or for their <hi>Valour</hi> by <hi>Land</hi> and
<hi>Sea,</hi> and for <hi>numerous Offsprings.</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Cuſtoms
relating to <hi>Births,</hi> as <hi>Borow-Engliſh,</hi> or Deſcent of Lands
to the <hi>Youngeſt</hi> before the <hi>Eldeſt</hi> born, with the Reaſon
preſumed to be, that where this Cuſtom remains, the Places were anciently
liable to the Privilege granted alſo in <hi>Scotland,</hi> by King
<hi>Evenus</hi> or <hi>Eugenius,</hi> to the <hi>Lords</hi> of
<hi>Mannors,</hi> that they ſhould have the firſt Night's Lodging with
their <hi>Tenants</hi> Brides; ſo that <hi>eldeſt</hi> Sons being
ſuppoſed all <hi>Baſtards,</hi> and of the Lord's beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, they
ſettled their Lands on the <hi>Youngeſt,</hi> as more likely to be their
own: But how common this Cuſtom was all over <hi>England,</hi> may be ſeen
by the Tax afterwards gathered inſtead thereof, called <hi>Marcheta
Mulierum,</hi> in <hi>Bracton.</hi> Nor was the Privilege of
<hi>Lotherwits</hi> or <hi>Lierwit,</hi> expounded <pb n="182" facs="tcp:0570200100:209"/> in
<hi>Fleta,</hi> to import the ſame as <hi>Mulcta Adulteriorum,</hi> and
remaining here to this day, much leſs lewd or immoral, being a Liberty of
taking a Compenſation for Baſtards, got or born in the Lordſhip, nay
alſo out of the Lordſhip for 1 <hi>l.</hi> 19. <hi>s.</hi> 11 <hi>d.</hi>
paid to the <hi>Lords</hi>; and further, here was an <hi>Oak</hi> in
<hi>Knoll-Wood,</hi> which had ſuch a ſuperior Privilege of
<hi>Fornication,</hi> that if a Baſtard was ſworn to be begot under its
Shade, neither the <hi>Biſhop</hi> nor <hi>Lords</hi> of the <hi>Mannor</hi>
them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves could take any Cognizance of it. After theſe Births, we have
ſome Remarks upon <hi>Chriſtnings,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian Names,</hi> how
they ran much upon <hi>Ralph</hi> and <hi>Walter,</hi> from two famous Earls
who lived in the County; and how ſome Families chriſtned their eldeſt
Sons of the ſame Name for many Generations. Having done with the Births of
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants, he proceeds to remarkable Paſſages in <hi>Childhood</hi> and
<hi>Youth,</hi> as the Impoſtures of <hi>William Perry,</hi> the Boy of
<hi>Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> who counterfeited himſelf bewitched or poſſeſſed;
whereof there is a Pamphlet printed in 1622. And this Story brings in other
Inſtances of <hi>imitating Sounds</hi> and <hi>Motions,</hi> whereof the
<hi>involuntary Imitations</hi> of <hi>Donald Monro,</hi> are moſt ſtrange.
Next we advance to uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Accidents and Qualities in adult Perſons, and
firſt of Women. Some who yielded great Quantities of <hi>Milk,</hi> and the
medicinal Virtues of Women's Milk. One who <hi>ſlept</hi> 14 Days and Nights;
and another 7 Days. A Man who <hi>faſted</hi> 14 Days; and another in
<hi>Scotland</hi> 30 or 40 Days to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. And here is a Copy from a
<hi>Record</hi> in the <hi>Tower,</hi> of a <hi>Pardon</hi> granted 31
<hi>Edward</hi> III. to <hi>Cicely de Rygeway</hi> (who was condemned at
<hi>Nottingham,</hi> for killing her Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band) becauſe ſhe had faſted
forty Days without Meat or Drink, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Of <hi>deaf</hi> Perſons
underſtanding People by the Motion of their Lips. Of a Lady who had a Pin
ſqueezed out of her Arm, which ſhe never could account for, yet parallel'd
with like Inſtances. Of ſtrange Deliverances from <hi>Murder</hi> and
<hi>Hanging</hi>; particularly of <hi>Judith de Balſham,</hi> who having been
hang'd from nine a-Clock on <hi>Monday</hi> Morning, till Sun-riſing on
<hi>Tueſday,</hi> according to the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence paſſed, yet lived after it,
and had a Pardon thereupon granted, 48th <hi>Hen.</hi> III. which is here
recited. And of a <hi>Swiſs,</hi> who was hanged 13 times, yet could not by
that kind of Execution be put to death. Next we come to Men eminent for their
extraordinary <hi>Strength,</hi> exceſſive <hi>Stature,</hi> and <hi>Pious
Works;</hi> others who had their want of <hi>Sight</hi> wonderfully ſupply'd
by the Perfection of their other <pb n="183" facs="tcp:0570200100:210"/> Senſes; ſtrange
Inſtances of <hi>Longing</hi> in Men, as well as Women; and other uncommon
Diſtempers. Of Men that never <hi>ſpit.</hi> The ſtrange Force of
<hi>Cuſtom</hi> in ſome <hi>Fools,</hi> eſpecially one, who being removed
from a Place where he had heard a Clock conſtantly ſtrike, would repeat the
Strokes punctually every Hour when he heard it not; and of the
<hi>Artificial,</hi> learn'd to become a <hi>Natural</hi> Clock, as Dr.
<hi>Willis</hi> has related. Here is another Inſtance of a <hi>Fool,</hi>
whoſe ſtrange Sagacity exceeded the other telling not only the Changes of
the Moon, Times of Eclipſes, and when <hi>Eaſter</hi> and
<hi>Whitſuntide</hi> fell, or any other <hi>moveable</hi> Feaſt, but at
what time they had, or ſhould fall, at any diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of Years, which could
receive no Help from the <hi>Force</hi> of <hi>Cuſtom:</hi> From the
Imperfections of Men, we have a Tranſition to their <hi>Vices,</hi> which
brings in the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Judgment upon <hi>John Duncalf,</hi> who having ſtole
a Bible, had his Hands rotted off, according to his Wiſh, if that Theft were
true; from the <hi>Narrative</hi> of this Judgment pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Mr. <hi>Ja.
Illingworth</hi> and Mr. <hi>Newey.</hi> This is followed with ſome wonderful
Eſcapes from <hi>Death</hi> in this County, particularly that of King
<hi>Charles</hi> II. after the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> who found an
<hi>Aſylum</hi> at <hi>Bentley,</hi> and afterwards conferred ſeveral
Honours on Col. <hi>John Lane,</hi> as the <hi>Letters Patent</hi> here
exemplified, concerning the ſame, do teſtify. Here is likewiſe an Account
of the Preſervation of his Followers; and by whoſe means his Majeſty's
<hi>George</hi> came ſafe again to his Hands. From Men ſolitarily
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, we proceed to ſome Remarks upon them jointly, in Examples of
Men extremely alike, or <hi>reſembling</hi> each other, particularly Dr.
<hi>Hen. Fairfax</hi> and his Brother. Of Biſhops twice married. Remarks on
many Families of one Name, and marrying among themſelves. Of ſome odd
Cuſtoms; as at <hi>Guoſall</hi>; where the Civil Law Judge deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines
according to a Jury; <hi>Moſeley</hi>'s <hi>Dole-penny</hi> at
<hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhall.</hi> The Society of <hi>Free-Maſons</hi> in the
<hi>Moorlands</hi> of this County; with ſome curious Remarks thereon;
par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly on a fabulous MS. <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the ſaid
<hi>Craft</hi>; their Lodges and Rules, with the Notice of an Act 3
<hi>Henry</hi> VI. aboliſhing this Society, and adjudging the holding of
their Congregations to be Felony. The Cuſtom at <hi>Brewood,</hi> &amp;c. of
adorning their Walls with Boughs and Flowers. Many Examples of extream <hi>old
Age;</hi> many aged Perſons living together, five and ſix Generations at a
time. Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of ſeveral unaccountable <hi>Warnings</hi> of Death in ſome
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0570200100:211"/> Families, by divers kinds of Noiſe. Remarks on the
frontal <hi>Sutures</hi> in ſome <hi>Skulls,</hi> and of ſome large human
Bones: which, with an Omiſſion or two in the Articles of <hi>valiant</hi>
Men, and thoſe famous in the <hi>Law,</hi> finiſhes this Chapter.</p>
               <p>Chap. IX. <hi>Of Arts.</hi> Theſe are treated of after his
former Method; firſt, of ſuch as relate to the <hi>Heavens</hi> and
<hi>Air</hi>; next, of <hi>Fire</hi> and <hi>Water-works</hi>; thirdly, tending
to the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of <hi>Earths, Stones,</hi> or <hi>Plants,</hi> and
laſtly, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting <hi>Men</hi> or <hi>Women.</hi> To this purpoſe he
begins with an Account of a new Sort of <hi>Dyals,</hi> and a <hi>Dyal
Quadrant;</hi> with an Experiment proving the Force of the Rarefaction of
<hi>Air.</hi> The <hi>Arts</hi> relating to <hi>Fire</hi> are, thoſe of
burning <hi>Turf, Earth,</hi> &amp;c. for the fertilizing of Lands, and for
cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Iron-works,</hi> at the Anvil and Forge; particularly of the
Difficulty and Ingenuity of making Frying-pans and that there were but two
Maſters of this Craft in the Kingdom. An improved Way of burning
<hi>Tiles.</hi> Prince <hi>Rupert</hi>'s Dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity in ſhooting with
<hi>Fire-Arms,</hi> exemplified in the two famous Shots he made
ſucceſſively, thro' the Weather-cock of St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s
Church-Steeple, at <hi>Stafford,</hi> with a ſcrew'd Horſeman's Piſtol,
at threeſcore Yards diſtance, before King <hi>Charles</hi> I. Among the
<hi>Water-works,</hi> we have ſome Account of remarkable <hi>Mills,</hi> and
<hi>Mill-dams</hi>; of Brewing and Fining of <hi>Ale</hi>; and in the
Pleaſure-Gardens, of <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Canals,</hi> &amp;c. Of Arts relating to
the <hi>Earth,</hi> we have here thoſe of the <hi>Agriculture</hi> uſed in
this County: and of thoſe concerning <hi>Stones,</hi> what is moſt
obſervable in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chitecture, both publick and private; with ſome copious
Remarks upon the Building of <hi>Churches,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Eaſt</hi>
and <hi>Weſt.</hi> Next of the <hi>Bridge</hi> at <hi>Burton</hi> upon
<hi>Trent</hi>; and after that, of the Hardening and Softning of <hi>Iron,</hi>
for the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſeveral kinds of the ſaid Hard Ware, with many
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of curious Improvements therein, and the ways uſed to keep them
from Ruſt. Then follow ſome Arts relating to <hi>Plants,</hi> as the
improving of <hi>Ropes,</hi> made with <hi>Hemp</hi> and <hi>Ruſhes</hi>;
preſerving of <hi>Beer</hi> with <hi>Heath</hi> inſtead of <hi>Hops</hi>;
and making Malt of <hi>Oats.</hi> After theſe, the Arts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to
<hi>Shrubs</hi> and <hi>Trees</hi>; as to the ſowing of <hi>Acorns,</hi>
making <hi>Furze</hi> Hedges, planting of <hi>Vines,</hi> forming of
<hi>Topiary</hi> Works, Arbors, and other like Curioſities in Gardens, Parks
and Groves; with the managing of their <hi>Woods,</hi> as to Bruſhing,
Fencing, Barking, Felling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Excellency of ſome
<hi>Joyners</hi> and <hi>Turners</hi> Work thereon: alſo their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of
<hi>Fruit-Trees.</hi> Thus we come to their Arts <pb n="185" facs="tcp:0570200100:212"/>
concerning Animals; beginning with Bees and Bee-hives An Inſtrument to match
<hi>Game Cocks:</hi> Device to prevent <hi>Hogs</hi> from <hi>rooting</hi>; and
to cure ſome Diſtempers in Cattle; a new invented <hi>Bridle,</hi> or
<hi>Gag</hi> for <hi>ſcolding Women</hi>; and a <hi>Sledge</hi> for Smiths.
Improved <hi>Barrels</hi> for Drink; in <hi>Cookery</hi> potted <hi>Otters</hi>
taſting like <hi>Veniſon</hi>; and to puniſh <hi>Miſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanors,</hi> a
Pair of <hi>Finger-Stocks.</hi> Laſtly, ſome odd kind of Pictures upon an
indented Board, which beheld directly, appear confuſed, but obliquely, the
Pictures of a King and Queen: alſo ſome curious Cut-work, in Paper, with
Sciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſars, of Col. <hi>J. Lane</hi>'s Tomb, Trophies, Inſcription,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> And Part of a <hi>Greek</hi> Chapter which, laid on a black
Ground, was as legible as the ſame in a printed Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Chap. X. <hi>Of Antiquities.</hi> And theſe, not ſo much of
Perſons or Actions, as of <hi>Things</hi>; ſuch as are remote from the
preſent Age, whether found under Ground, or whereof there yet remain any
Footſteps above it; as ancient <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals, Ways, Lows, Pavements, Urns,
Monuments</hi> of Stone, <hi>Fortifications,</hi> &amp;c. whether of the
ancient <hi>Britains, Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, Saxons, Danes,</hi> or <hi>Normans.</hi>
Beginning with the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Reaſons, why the original Inhabitants of this
County might be <hi>Iceni,</hi> and the notable <hi>Remains</hi> of ſome
ancient <hi>Britiſh</hi> City near <hi>Wrotteſley,</hi> of great Extant,
being about three or four Miles round; with ſome Ruins of
<hi>Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> preſumed alſo to be theirs. Of their <hi>Arrow
Heads</hi> made of <hi>Flints,</hi> found here. Other Antiquities alſo of
<hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Origin; and particularly the Place where
<hi>Litchfield</hi> now is, ſo called from the <hi>dead Bodies</hi> of St.
<hi>Amphabale</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who were martyr'd there. Of <hi>Roman</hi>
Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the moſt conſiderable in theſe Parts are, their <hi>publick
Ways;</hi> which here, with ſome other of their Antiquities alſo, are
copiouſly treated of. The <hi>Saxon</hi> and <hi>Daniſh</hi> Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
are ſtill more largely diſcuſs'd, in relation to the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or
deſtroying of ſeveral Towns, Fortifications, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in the
County. Here ſpeaking of the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> and <hi>Utenſils</hi> of
the <hi>Danes,</hi> which obtained among theſe People, we have a large
Account and Sculpture of the <hi>Staffordſhire Cloggs,</hi> or little
ſquare Logs of Wood, which by the Notches and Inciſions upon them,
ſupplied the Uſe of <hi>Almanacks</hi>; with many Remarks upon the Symbols
thereon, and the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations relating thereto; ending, as to this
<hi>Daniſh</hi> Part, with the Account of the famous Lady <hi>Godiva,</hi>
who rode through <hi>Coventry</hi> naked, to obtain many Privileges, for the
Inhabitants, of her Husband <hi>Leofric,</hi> Earl of <hi>Mercia</hi>; ſhe
dying at his Village of <hi>Bromleyg</hi> in this County, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0570200100:213"/> to <hi>Knyghton,</hi> tho' buried at <hi>Coventry.</hi>
To theſe are added, ſome old Cuſtoms, whoſe Originals being obſcure,
might commence as high as thoſe Times: ſuch as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Lord of
<hi>Eſſington</hi> to the Lord of <hi>Hilton,</hi> round whoſe Hall-Fire,
he was to drive a Gooſe every New-Year's-Day three times, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
while <hi>Jack of Hilton,</hi> a whim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical kind of <hi>Aeolipile,</hi> being
a little brazen Image, in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Poſture, filled with Water, is blowing
the Coals. Their merry Cuſtom of the <hi>Hobbey-Horſe Dance,</hi> &amp;c.
at <hi>Abbots Bromley</hi> had a good uſeful End in it; but the Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom at
<hi>Tutbury</hi> for the King of the <hi>Minſtrells</hi> to arreſt all the
Muſicians in the ſaid Franchiſe, who refuſed to do the yearly Services,
according to the Charter of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Gaunt,</hi> for which they had
a Bull, given by the Prior of <hi>Tutbury,</hi> amidſt all the Harmony
thereof, ſeems to have been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with much Diſcord, which produced an
Alteration according to the modern Ceremonies uſed in theſe their muſical
Meetings, which yet are not void of Tumult and Miſchief. That other Cuſtom
at <hi>Tutbury,</hi> of finding a <hi>Flitch of Bacon</hi> for every married
Man, who took the Oath a Year and a Day after his Marriage, That he had never
wiſhed to change his Wife, but would have taken her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all other Women
had ſhe been ſingle; whereby Sir <hi>Philip de Somervile</hi> held
<hi>Whichnovre,</hi> and other Manors; had a good Encouragement in it to the
making of mature Elections, and being contented with thoſe they made; and was
parallel'd by that Cuſtom alſo inſtituted at the Priory of
<hi>Dunmow</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> by the Lord <hi>Robert Fitzwalter, temp.
Hen</hi> III. which Ceremony is alſo here recited, from the Hiſtory of that
Baron, printed 1616 Then follows an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome other Antiquities, as
the Donation of <hi>Heyley</hi> Caſtle to <hi>Hen. de Aldithleg,</hi> and the
Advowſon of <hi>Penck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridge</hi> Church to the Archbiſhops of

               <p>THIS Collection, made about the Beginning of the Reign of our late
Queen <hi>Anne,</hi> by a Gentleman lately dead, as we have ſome Reaſon to
believe, who was well acquainted with the Records of this Kingdom, and the
Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digrees of the moſt eminent Families in it, begins with
<hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts</hi> from the <hi>Patent Rolls</hi> of <hi>Grants,</hi> which
were made by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. from the <hi>firſt</hi> to the

demiſed, as far as Page 68; concluding with the ſaid King's <hi>Grants</hi>
to the Lord Chancellor <hi>Audley,</hi> of <hi>Duke's Place,</hi> &amp;c.
copied from the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> to Page 76. So we come to the

&amp;c. made by King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. in the firſt Year of his Reign, to
his Uncle, <hi>Edward,</hi> Duke of <hi>Somerſet</hi>; whereof we have here

               <p>THE <hi>Publiſher</hi> of theſe <hi>Diſcourſes</hi>
ſhews us in his <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face,</hi> that Experience and Practice are better
helps in the Study of <hi>Antiquities</hi> than General Rules; yet that theſe
are to be regarded, and better Accounts of our Antiquities to be given. Next he
commends the <hi>Baroccian</hi> Collection of <hi>Greek</hi> MSS. and Dr.
<hi>Langbain</hi>'s noble Deſign of publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divers Volumes of
Fragments, which requir'd Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and that the Clergy ought to have

               <p>THIS thin Volume, of about one hundred Pages, is perhaps one of
the ſcarceſt Books now remaining of that our firſt Printer; ſeeing it
has ſo little occurred to thoſe who have attempted to give us any
Catalogues of his Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications. Tho' no Date when it was printed is
expreſs'd, yet may it be gueſſed at within a Year over or under, by
ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it in 1484; from the ſhort Reign of that Prince to whom it is
inſcribed at the End, as will preſently appear. It is printed with large
<hi>initial</hi> Letters at the Beginning of the Chapters; with only one Sort
of <hi>Points,</hi> which are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique or leaning Daſhes; ſome double or
<hi>united Types,</hi> as in his other Books, which we have hitherto
obſerved; alſo with <hi>Signatures,</hi> but no <hi>Catch-words</hi> at the
Bottom of the Leaves, nor any <hi>Numbers</hi> on them at Top. And is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
into <hi>eight Chapters.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt,</hi> ſhews how a Knight, who was a Hermit,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed this Rule or Order of Chivalry upon a Squire. The
<hi>ſecond,</hi> treats of the Beginning of Chivalry or Knighthood. The
<hi>third,</hi> of the Office of Chivalry. <hi>Fourth,</hi> Of the Examination
that ought to be made to the <hi>Eſquyer,</hi> when he will enter into the
Order of Chivalry. <hi>Fifth,</hi> In what manner the Squire ought to receive
Chivalry. <hi>Sixth,</hi> Of the <hi>Sygnefyaunce</hi> of the Arms belonging to
a Knight. <hi>Seventh,</hi> Of the Cuſtoms that appertain to a Knight. And
<hi>eight,</hi> Of the Honours that ought to be done to a Knight. By all which
it will appear how different the Honour, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, the
Qualifications, required in Knights anciently, were from thoſe for which they
have been created in lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Times.</p>
               <p>At the End we have the Printer's Rehearſal in theſe Words:

               <p>THO' Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi> ſuffer'd Death for maintaining the
Supremacy of the Pope over that of his Sovereign, as may be read in theſe
<hi>Works,</hi> and in the many Accounts of his <hi>Life,</hi> ſet forth by
the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholics, who have much magnified him for his ſaid
Writings and Sufferings; yet are there many things in this Collection of his
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Works obſervable to all Readers, who are even not attach'd
to his own Perſuaſion, as it is one of the moſt copious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplars we
have in Print of the beſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> Stile in thoſe Days, and
contains ſome curious Pieces or Parcels of <hi>Civil,</hi> and many of
<hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Hiſtory, relating to the Times of our
<hi>Reformation:</hi> and, overlooking the ſuperſtitious Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to his
Cauſe, with ſome ſophiſtical Arguments ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſupport it,
is fraught with many Teſtimonies of virtuous Learning, fine Genius, and good
Morals for the univerſal Conduct of Life.</p>
               <p>The Book was collected together and publiſhed from the Author's
printed Copies and Manuſcripts, by his Nephew <hi>William Raſtell,</hi>
Serjeant at Law, and dedicated to Queen <hi>Mary</hi>; that it might forward
her Majeſty's <hi>moſt</hi> Godly <hi>Puſpoſe, in purging this her
Realm of all wicked Hereſies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After the Table of Contents, and a tolerable good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dex, the
Collection commences with ſome Pieces of our Author's Poetry, which he wrote
for his Diverſion, in his younger Days. As, the Merry <hi>Jeſt,</hi> how a
<hi>Serjeant</hi> would learn to play the <hi>Frier</hi>; containing ſome
good Reproofs of thoſe who act out of their Sphere. Then follow his
<hi>Verſes</hi> to explain the <hi>Images</hi> in ſome <hi>Pageants,</hi>
which he deviſed in his Father's Houſe; deſcribing the ſeveral Stages
and Conſequents of Life. After this, we have his rueful <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of
the Death of Queen Elizabeth,</hi> Wife of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. in
<hi>Feb.</hi> 1503. Next come his Prefatory Verſes before the <hi>Book of
Fortune:</hi> Theſe Verſes make about four <pb n="195" facs="tcp:0570200100:222"/> Sheets.
Hence we paſs to his Works in Proſe; beginning with <hi>the Life of John
Picus, Earl of Mirandula, an Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian Nobleman,</hi> of great Virtue and
Learning, who died in 1494, aged 32; with ſeveral of his Letters, and his
Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, tranſlated from the <hi>Latin,</hi> and dedicated to his beloved
Siſter <hi>Joyeuce Leigh.</hi> After this, we have <hi>the Hiſtory of King
Richard</hi> III. written by our Author when he was one of the Under Sheriffs
of <hi>London,</hi> about the Year 1513, but unfiniſhed, and publiſhed
before, in the <hi>Chronicles</hi> of <hi>Harding</hi> and <hi>Hall</hi>; tho'
very corruptly, and much varying from his own Copy whence this is printed. The
next is a long Treatiſe <hi>on the four laſt Things,</hi> Death, Dome,
Pain, and Joy; with ſeveral Chapters on Pride, Envy, Wrath, Covetouſneſs,
Gluttony, and Slouth; compoſed after he was knighted, of the Privy Council to
King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and Under-Treaſurer of <hi>England,</hi> about the
Year 1522, but unfiniſh'd, and we preſume never before printed; but that
which ſucceeds, it was as we are informed, the Year after it was written;
entitled, A <hi>Dialogue</hi> of Sir <hi>T. More,</hi> then Chancellor of the
Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> wherein is treated <hi>of the Veneration and
Worſhip of Images</hi> and <hi>Reliques</hi>; praying to <hi>Saints,</hi> and
going on <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> with many things touching the Sects of
<hi>Luther</hi> and <hi>Tyndale,</hi> begun by the one in <hi>Saxony,</hi> and
labour'd to be brought by the other into <hi>England</hi>; made in the Year
1528. This is a large Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, in four Books, divided into many Chapters,
and illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated with many pleaſant Examples, Tales, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with
which he had a Memory plentifully furniſhed, and a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent happily
conſtituted to apply them. To ſome, who made Objection thereat, we find his
Anſwer was, 
<q rend="inline">"That for a Layman to tell his Mind merrily, might
ſometimes better become him, than ſeriouſly and ſolemnly to
preach."</q> His next Treatiſe is, <hi>The Supplication of Souls,</hi>
written 1529, againſt a famous little Tract, call'd, <hi>The Supplication of
Beggars;</hi> (written by <hi>Simon Fiſh</hi> of <hi>Gray's-Inn,</hi> which
was very Inſtrumental to the Reformation, and is reprinted in <hi>Fox.</hi>)
To that follows, <hi>The Confutation of Tyndale's An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> (to the
<hi>Dialogue</hi> aforeſaid) made 1532, by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. In the Preface
hereof, we have a large Account of many late Books, and their Authors, whom Sir
<hi>Thomas</hi> calls <hi>Heretics.</hi> Then we come to <hi>Tyndale</hi>'s
Preface, divided, with our Author's Anſwers to the ſeveral Particulars
alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately; which ends the <hi>firſt</hi> Book: but the <hi>firſt
Part</hi> of the Work contains 3 Books. The <hi>ſecond Part,</hi> written
1533, <pb n="196" facs="tcp:0570200100:223"/> after he had given over his Chancellor's Office,
begins at the fourth Book: It contains <hi>Tyndale</hi>'s <hi>Defence</hi> for
his <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> of the <hi>Teſtament</hi>; with our Author's
<hi>Anſwers</hi> to the ſeveral Parts interfering, as before; and herein,
having conſider'd <hi>Tyndale</hi>'s Church, to the End of the
<hi>ſeventh</hi> Book, we come in the <hi>eight,</hi> to our Author's
Confutation of <hi>Barnes</hi> his Church in the ſame manner: The
<hi>ninth</hi> Book is a Summary of the reſt, was not printed before, and
appears at the End to have been left unfiniſhed. This Work is ſucceeded by
<hi>a Letter</hi> of our Author, written at <hi>Chelchith</hi> (or
<hi>Chelſea</hi>) in 1533, <hi>againſt the little Book of John Frith upon
the Sacrament</hi>; and both concluded with a long <hi>Apology,</hi> written
and publiſhed alſo the ſame Year, in Anſwer to the Objections which
were made, more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially to theſe his laſt Writings, againſt his
ſaid three An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagoniſts. Theſe Pieces of his, producing a large

Puddle of Dirt, but rubbed and laid in Litter under the Manger, at their
Eaſe, they whine, and they bite, and they kick, and they ſpurn at him that
would help them up."</q> His next Performance is entitled, <hi>A Dialogue of
Comfort againſt Tribulation,</hi> made by an <hi>Hungarian</hi> in
<hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin,</hi> and tranſlated out of <hi>Latin</hi> into <hi>French,</hi>
and out of <hi>French</hi> into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> in 1534, when he was
Priſoner in the <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>London.</hi> And this is followed with
<hi>a Treatiſe to receive the Bleſſed Body of our Lord ſacramentally
and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually both,</hi> written in the ſame Year and Place. The next is, a
<hi>Treatiſe Hiſtorical, containing the bitter Paſſion of our Saviour
Chriſt, after the Courſe and Order of the four Evangeliſts</hi>; with an
Expoſition upon their Words, taken moſtly out of the Sayings of ſundry
good old holy Doctors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This copious Treatiſe was alſo
written in the ſame Year and Place aforeſaid; 'tis moſtly taken from
<hi>John Gerſon's Monateſſeron</hi>; but is unfiniſhed, the Author now
being denied the Uſe of Books, Pens, Ink, and Paper. <pb n="197" facs="tcp:0570200100:224"/>
Yet here follows, <hi>His Godly Inſtructions, Meditations, and Prayers,</hi>
in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> written with a Coal, both before and
after his Condemnation, which was on <hi>Thurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> the firſt of
<hi>July,</hi> 1535, <hi>Anno</hi> 27 <hi>Hen.</hi> VIII. and he was
<hi>beheaded</hi> on <hi>Tower-Hill</hi> the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following. The
reſt of the Volume conſiſts of his <hi>Letters,</hi> &amp;c. written at
ſundry times on divers Occaſions, beginning with his Letter from the Court
at <hi>Woodſtock,</hi> to his Wife the Lady <hi>Alice</hi> at
<hi>Chelſea,</hi> in 1528, the Year before he was Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor,
containing Conſolations to her for the Loſs ſhe had there by Fire. Next
we have his Epitaph, written by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in <hi>Latin,</hi> in 1532, ſoon
after he had laid down his Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor's Office; which he cauſed to be
inſcribed upon his Tomb, which he had erected in <hi>Chelſea</hi> Church,
while he was Lord Chancellor; with a Tranſlation of it. Then follow four
Letters which he wrote after he had given over the Office of Chancellor, and
before he was impriſon'd, <hi>viz.</hi> Three to Mr <hi>Tho. Cromwell</hi> of
the King's Privy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, and one to King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. all in the Year
1533. Next we have his Letters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> wrote while he was Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner
in the <hi>Tower,</hi> beginning with his Letter to his eldeſt Daughter Mrs.
<hi>Margaret Roper,</hi> upon his refuſing the Oath. Another to his ſaid
Daughter, written with a Coal. His <hi>Anſwer</hi> to a Letter of hers, which
ſeemingly perſuaded him to take the Oath, that ſhe might get the Liberty
ſhe did obtain of Acceſs to him. Her Anſwer thereunto. His Letter to all
his Friends, written with a Coal; with two Stanza's upon Fortune. Lady
<hi>Alice Alington</hi>'s Letter to Mrs. <hi>Margaret Roper.</hi> A long
Anſwer by her or her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the ſame. His two Letters to Doctor
<hi>Nicholas Wilſon,</hi> alſo Priſoner in the <hi>Tower,</hi> 1534. His
Daughter <hi>Roper</hi>'s Anſwer to a Letter of his, when he was ſhut up
cloſe Priſoner, 1534; with his Anſwers both to the ſame and another

<hi>Luca,</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> his old Friend, written with a Coal the
ſame Year: with the Tranſlation. His laſt Letter was to his Daughter
<hi>Roper,</hi> the Day before his Death, containing his Bleſſing to, and

               <p>THIS much-commended Book is dedicated to <hi>Edward de Vere,</hi>
Earl of <hi>Oxenford,</hi> Lord Great Chamberlayne of <hi>England,</hi> by the
<hi>Tranſlator,</hi> who tells his Lordſhip, at this time but in the Flower
of his Age, 
<q rend="inline">"that hereon when your Honour ſhall be at

Books of <hi>Geography, Hiſtories,</hi> and other good Learning, wherein I am
privy your Honour taketh ſingular Delight, I doubt not, but you ſhall have
cauſe to judge your Time very well applied. And ſo much the rather, for
that in the Study of Geography, it is expedient, firſt to know exactly the
Situation of our own home where we abide, before that we ſhall be able to
judge how other Countries do lie unto us, which are far diſtant from us;
beſides, that it were a foul Shame to be inquiſitive of the State of
<hi>Foreign</hi> Lands, and to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of our <hi>own.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Then follows the Tranſlator's <hi>Preface</hi>; in which he
ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowleges the Aſſiſtance of Dr. <hi>Yale,</hi> for the Tranſlation
of ſome Names, eſpecially in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Tongue; and the
Faultineſs of the <hi>Latin</hi> Copy which was printed at <hi>Cologne.</hi>
He alſo apologizes for his Tranſlation of the Title, as above, it being
called by the Author, <hi>Commentarioli Britannicae Deſcriptionis
Fragmentum,</hi> that is literally, <hi>A Fragment of a little Treatiſe of
the Deſcription of Britain,</hi> which he thinks not much beſide the
Meaning of the Title he hath given it. Next we have other Commendations in
Verſe, namely by <hi>T. Brown,</hi> Prebend of <hi>Weſtminſter, Ed.

to ſubjoin<note n="*" place="bottom">In the Copy of this Book now before us,
which had been the late Mr. <hi>Hearne</hi>'s of <hi>Oxford,</hi> he has

obſerve, he was now ſuffering under a dangerous Fever. Yet that he had here
ſent him his Deſcription of <hi>Wales</hi> and of <hi>England,</hi> with
the ancient Names, and another <hi>England</hi>; beſides cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Fragments

               </p>
               <p>After a Table of near ſeventy Authors uſed in this little
Work, our learned Antiquary begins it, with his Notice of the Promiſe he had
made to his Correſpondent aforeſaid, of ſending him the Geographical
Deſcription of <hi>Britain,</hi> with the moſt ancient Names, as well
<hi>Latin</hi> as <hi>Britiſh</hi>; wherein, becauſe he finds he muſt
diſagree from the Opinions of others, he has thought it expedient, firſt,
in a few Words, to diſcloſe the Effect of his Purpoſe, and by what
Arguments and Authorities he is moved to change or aſcribe to others, the
Names of ſome Countries, Towns, Rivers, and other Places. But before he takes
this in hand, enters upon ſome Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Britiſh Tongue,</hi>
touching the ſignification of the Letters, and manner of pronouncing the
ſame: The Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of which Tongue having driven many notable Men to ſuch
ſhifts, that endeavouring to wind themſelves out of one, they have fallen
into many. After this he begins with the <hi>Etymologies</hi> of
<hi>Britain</hi>; ſhews their Errors who have darken'd all the Names of
Places and Men with thoſe of <hi>Latin</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rivation; whereof <hi>Robert
Coenalis</hi> is particularly arraign'd; ſo proceeds to confirm Sir
<hi>Thomas Eliot</hi>'s Obſervation out of an old Manuſcript that
<hi>Britain</hi> was anciently written <hi>Prytannia,</hi> as if it were
derived from <hi>Pryd</hi> ſignifying Come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs or <hi>Beauty,</hi> and
<hi>Cain,</hi> or <hi>White,</hi> with the firſt Letter ſunk for
ſmoothneſs in Conjunction. After this he takes <pb n="200" facs="tcp:0570200100:227"/>
occaſion to chaſtiſe <hi>Polydore Virgil</hi> the <hi>Italian,</hi> and
<hi>Hector Boethius</hi> the <hi>Scot</hi>; whereof the firſt, in his
<hi>Hiſtory of Britain,</hi> mainly ſought not only to obſcure the Glory
of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Name, but alſo to defame the <hi>Britains</hi>
themſelves with ſcandalous Lyes; and the other, in attempting to raiſe
the <hi>Scots</hi> out of Darkneſs, attributes whatever he finds the
<hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> or <hi>Britains</hi> have done worthy of Commendation in this
Iſland, all to his Countrymen. Yet does he alſo believe that
<hi>Brutus</hi> came into <hi>Britain</hi> with his <hi>Trojans,</hi> and took
upon him the Government thereof; whence they might alſo be called
<hi>Britains.</hi> Then he proceeds to the <hi>Diviſion</hi>of
<hi>Britain</hi> into <hi>Lhoegria, Albania,</hi> and <hi>Cambria</hi>; ſo to
the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> and by whom the Country was called
<hi>England,</hi> and the People <hi>Saiſon.</hi> But now returning to treat
more particularly of <hi>Lhoegr</hi> or <hi>England,</hi> he begins firſt
with <hi>Kent,</hi> and having given an Account of the ancient Names of Places
in this and other Counties, to <hi>fol.</hi> 35, where, having alſo reproved
<hi>Sleydan</hi>'s partial Abridgment of <hi>Froiſſart,</hi> and ended with
the Deſcent of the <hi>Stuarts,</hi> he begins, as in a <hi>Second Part,</hi>
with theſe Words: 
<q rend="inline">"Now that we have wander'd over all
<hi>England</hi> called <hi>Lhoegr,</hi> let us next in Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proceed to the
ſecond Region of <hi>Britain,</hi> which, of our Countrymen, is called
<hi>Albania,</hi> of the Inhabitants, <hi>Scotland.</hi>"</q> Here he
obſerves, That there was never any Writer of Name, that made mention either
of <hi>Scots</hi> or <hi>Redſhanks</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Veſpaſian</hi>'s
Time, about the Year of our Lord's Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation 72, when <hi>Merrigus</hi> or
<hi>Arviragus</hi> reigned in <hi>Britain.</hi> And that they cou'd not be
called by the <hi>Romans, Phichtiani,</hi> for painting their Bodies, ſince
they were called by that Name before they were ever known to the
<hi>Latins,</hi> and were the <hi>Britains</hi> whom <hi>Caeſar</hi> and
others report to have painted themſelves <hi>blue</hi> with the Herb
<hi>Woad,</hi> that they might appear more terrible to their Enemies. Then
having given us the Original of the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Redſhanks,</hi>
and ſharply corrected <hi>Boethius</hi> for his many Falſities, he
proceeds, in the like Manner as he had done of <hi>England,</hi> briefly to
deſcribe or explain the Names of ſeveral principal Places in
<hi>Albania</hi> or <hi>Scotland,</hi> and the circumjacent Iſlands; ſo
paſſes to the third Part con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Wales,</hi> upon which our Author
is moſt copious, as well in deſcribing the Manners of the People, and the
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of ſome of their moſt ancient Worthies, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Names
of the Places: Interſperſed with many learned Authorities, curious
Obſervations, and critical Remarks. Of which, we ſhall mention only his
Reproof of the <hi>Golden</hi> 
                  <pb n="201" facs="tcp:0570200100:228"/> 
                  <hi>Number,</hi> his
Deſcription of <hi>Wenefride</hi>'s Well; with other Cenſures again of
<hi>P. Virgil</hi> and <hi>William Petit</hi> the Monk, and laſtly of
<hi>Gildas,</hi> for his hard Character of the <hi>Britains</hi>; as if he was
to be regarded merely as a Preacher 
<q rend="inline">"whoſe Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom is, very ſharply to inveigh
againſt the Faults of their Hearers: Wherefore, if we ſeek Authorities out
of Sermons as <hi>Polydore</hi> hath done; what Pariſh, what Town, what
Nation, or Kingdom may eſcape Infamy? What hath <hi>Bernard</hi> written of
the <hi>Romans?</hi> Thus ſurely, terming them impious, unfaithful,
ſeditious, diſhoneſt, traiterous, great Speakers, but little Doers.
Theſe Things are by <hi>Divines</hi> ſpoken in the Pulpit, according unto
their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the like Faults may be amended, and the Life reformed; not
that the <hi>Romans</hi> or <hi>Britains</hi> were ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Neither is
there any Man, unleſs he be a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Sycophant, that lyeth in wait
for all Occaſions to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſe and accuſe, which will go about, by
wreſting of Sentences forth of the Sermons of Preachers, ſlanderouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to
tax, and infamouſly to note any whole Covent, Shire, City, or People.
Wherefore, let ſuch idle and ill-diſpoſed Slanderers leave off, and
ſuffer the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown of <hi>Britain</hi> to appear to the World. Neither
judge me good Reader, of too ſharp a Tongue; ſeeing (ſo God help me)
neither Envy of any Foreign Name, neither Thirſt of Vain-glory, neither
Hatred of any Nation, but alone the Love of my Country, which is evil ſpoken
of undeſervedly, and deſire to ſet forth the Truth, have provoked me to
write thus much."</q> Then follows a ſhort and modeſt Concluſion, after
which, the whole is ended with certain <hi>Welch,</hi> or rather true
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Words converted into <hi>Latin</hi> by the Author, and now
tranſlated into <hi>Engliſh.</hi>

               <p>THE Learned Author of this Work, in his Dedication to <hi>George
Abbot,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> tells him, 
<q rend="inline">"he has written this Book in <hi>Engliſh</hi>
for the Benefit of his poor ſeduced Countrymen, who are perſuaded by the
Prieſts and Jeſuits that there is no ſuch Matter, and that their Books
are freeſt from Corruption, and Minds from Falſhood; that Proteſtants are
guilty of this Crime, and ſundry others. But as St. <hi>Auſten</hi>
obſerved of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> that they were ſhameleſs and impudent,
without Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, not caring what they ſaid: So it is with the
<hi>Papiſts</hi>; they do not only impudently deny, but wickedly tranſlate
the Crime from themſelves unto others. For if forging falſe
<hi>Treatiſes,</hi> or Corruption of the True; changing of
<hi>Scriptures,</hi> or altering of Men's Words, contrary to their Meaning, be
certain Notes of Hereſy, how heretical then muſt the <hi>Church</hi> of

long ſince in his Book againſt <hi>Hill,</hi> begun to diſcover this
deviliſh Policy of the common Adverſary, and his Grace's Example has

we have an ample <hi>Advertiſement to the Chriſtian Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> wherein
he tells him, that 
<q rend="inline">"having fully travelled this vaſt Wilderneſs
of Sin, I have thought it my Duty to leave certain <hi>Land-Marks</hi> behind

reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into <hi>five Parts</hi>: The <hi>Firſt</hi> ſhews, <hi>The
Baſtardy of the Falſe Fathers,</hi> and in this Part theſe few Things are
to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, That there are 187 ſeveral Treatiſes, here diſtinctly
produced, which are ſhrewdly ſuſpected, if not plainly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of
Forgery by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves. That our Author follows herein
the Judgment of their moſt eſteemed Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, ſuch as <hi>Bellarmine</hi>
and <hi>Baronius, Poſſevin</hi> and <hi>Gretſer, Sextus Senenſis,
Angelus Roccha, Pamelius,</hi> and ſundry others; ſometimes, tho' ſeldom,
citing <hi>Eraſmus,</hi> or following his Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, becauſe the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay he was an <hi>Apoſtate</hi>; tho' he defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the
Religion, then openly maintain'd, againſt <hi>Oecolampadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Melancthon,
Martin Luther</hi> and others; was accounted in the boſom of the Church, and
ſaluted by the Name of Son, by <hi>Adrian</hi> VI. and <hi>Leo</hi> X. And
however he was accuſed for a <hi>Lutheran,</hi> ſeeing his Apology
ſatisfied the Pope in his Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time, why ſhould the <hi>Papiſts</hi>
traduce him being dead? Tho' he were in Heart and Profeſſion a
<hi>Papiſt,</hi> God made him write againſt the Abuſes of Popery, rather
than againſt the Religion itſelf, as himſelf ſays. But leaving him, let
them conſider the reſt who were inflexible <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and ſee
here how the beſt of them are driven to cenſure theſe Treatiſes, yet
enforced to make uſe of them, abuſing the ſimple Reader, by the frequent
Citation of <hi>Clement, Cyprian, Ambroſe, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine, Hierome,</hi> and
the reſt, when no one Scrip of their Writings is alledg'd; yet
<hi>Cocceius</hi> their Maſter has been bold to ſet down the Age when every
one of theſe Fathers lived, to thoſe baſtard Treatiſes, which
themſelves never ſaw. Our Author begins his ſaid <hi>Catalogue,</hi> in
this firſt Part with <hi>Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dias,</hi> who lived in the Time of St.
<hi>Paul,</hi> and ends it with <hi>Iſodore,</hi> who flouriſh'd not long
after St. <hi>Gregory</hi>; yet, in this Part, he compriſes not all the
Treatiſes of the Fathers who lived within the Six Hundred Years, condemned by
<hi>Papiſts,</hi> nor many more detected by the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> but
only thoſe he finds cited by the <hi>Papiſts</hi> in their Books of
Controverſy; eſpecially when they are alledg'd to gain Credit with the
ſimple People; which they well might do, ſince ſome Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Men here
named have been deceived, to cite thefe For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geries, <pb n="204" facs="tcp:0570200100:231"/> as
the Works of the Fathers, who lived before <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>'s Time, ſo they
cou'd not be forged by <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who according to the Opinion of
the <hi>Papiſts</hi> derive their Origin from him. And as to their being
cited ſometimes by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Proteſtants</hi> alſo, 'tis but
reaſonable, as one ſide has uſed them for their Convenience, that they
ſhou'd be as free for the other. After this <hi>Catalogue,</hi> which
comprehends 71 Pages, we have a Liſt of the <hi>Names</hi> of the
<hi>Author</hi>'s whoſe <hi>Books</hi> are cited; and a brief <hi>Table</hi>

               <p>Part II. <hi>Of the Corruption of the True Fathers,</hi> wherein
is the greater Danger, becauſe it may ſpread farther before eſpied. And
here our Author takes the Word <hi>Fathers</hi> in a large Senſe, extending
it as far as <hi>Gregory de Valentia</hi> does, unto the beſt learned of all
Ages. His Obſervations are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from the moſt learned
<hi>Proteſtants,</hi> and particularly his chief Encourager the learned Dr.
<hi>Bilſon,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter.</hi> Further, this Part
contains, 50 Proofs of corrupted Places in theſe Eccleſiaſtical Writers.
In the 26th Proof, there is a Story rehearſed by our Author of Biſhop
<hi>Jewel,</hi> who citing St. <hi>Gregory</hi>'s <hi>Epiſtles</hi> in a
Viſitation Sermon, at <hi>Abingdon</hi> in <hi>Berkſhire,</hi> was defamed
for corrupting his Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Senſe; which cauſed all the MS. of that Father
to be ſearch'd, whereby it was found, that the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Editions
on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly were corrupted, that the Biſhop had quoted the genuine Senſe, and
that thoſe who charged ſuch Corruptions upon him were themſelves moſt
guilty of them. Our Author concludes this Part, with his Wiſhes for a
<hi>Proteſtant</hi> Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Councils; and obſerves, that Dr.
<hi>Ward,</hi> Maſter of <hi>Sidney-Suſſex</hi> College, in
<hi>Cambridge,</hi> had beſtowed many Years Pains in this way, and that his
Endeavours wou'd tend to excellent Purpoſes, if he might be prevail'd on to
publiſh them; but if any Thing keep him back, it is an humble Conceit he has
ever had, to think himſelf ſo much the leſs able, the more ſufficient
others eſteem him. This Part is compriſed in 103 Pages, and has in another
Page, The <hi>Names</hi> added, of the <hi>Authors</hi> and <hi>Pages</hi>
corrupted.</p>
               <p>Part III. <hi>The Variety and Contrariety of the</hi> Popiſh
<hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, commonly called the</hi> Vulgar <hi>Bibles in</hi> Latin. Our
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Motives for publiſhing this Part were, firſt, becauſe it is a
Matter of Faith to appoint what is Scripture, and what not, to ſhew that the
Pope may err in Matters of Faith. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> 
                  <pb n="205" facs="tcp:0570200100:232"/>
Becauſe <hi>Papiſts</hi> object to us our different Tranſlations of the
Bible, to ſhew their own groſs Errors and Abſurdities, in ſetting forth
their two <hi>Hierome</hi> Bibles, authoriz'd by two Popes within two Years.
<hi>Thirdly,</hi> To vindicate his <hi>Bellum Papale,</hi> wrote againſt
thoſe two diſcording Editions, from ſome Objections to the ſame, lately
publiſh'd by <hi>James Gretſer.</hi> In this Part it further appears,
Theſe Bibles were ſet forth by Pope <hi>Sixtus</hi> in 1590, and Pope
<hi>Clement</hi> 1592. And what Sentences or Words were <hi>added</hi> by Pope
<hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> which were not in the Edition of <hi>Sixtus:</hi> Alſo the
Sentences or Words <hi>left out</hi> by <hi>Clement,</hi> which were in the
Bibles of <hi>Sixtus</hi>; with the <hi>Contradictions</hi> of one againſt
the other: Errors in <hi>Numerical</hi> Computations; Tranſpoſition of
<hi>Names,</hi> and other Alterations of the Senſe: To which follows, An
<hi>Apology</hi> or Defence of the <hi>Bellum Papale,</hi> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd by our
Author againſt thoſe Bibles, 4to, 1600. In which he tells us, how he came
to engage himſelf againſt thoſe Editions; recites the pompous
Inſcription ſet up in the <hi>Vatican</hi> in Honour of <hi>Sixtus,</hi>
upon his ſaid Publication, with the Apologies of ſome Jeſuits for the
Errors therein; as <hi>Baldwin,</hi> Dr. <hi>Norrice,</hi> and Dr.
<hi>Biſhop</hi>; alſo ſome Anſwers to <hi>Gretſer</hi>'s Allegations
againſt our Author: With an Account of <hi>Arias Montanus</hi>'s
<hi>Apology,</hi> for his Integrity in ſetting forth the King's Bibles,
containing the whole Hiſtory of his Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles in the Progreſs of that
coſtly Work; the Copy of which was found at the Sack of <hi>Cadiz,</hi> and
by Dr. <hi>Rives</hi> repoſited in the Library at <hi>Oxford</hi>; this with
a rehearſal of ſome Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences that are yet found uncorrected, or rather
added un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantably to the Vulgar Bible; alſo ſome further Anſwers to
his Antagoniſt, and a Character of him, concludes this Part in 59 Pages.</p>
               <p>Part IV. <hi>Of their condemning the Fathers.</hi> For tho' the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> do much boaſt of their Fathers, and vulgarly ſeem to
value their Writings, yet it is found that none are more injurious to their
Works or their Worth, 
<q rend="inline">"uſing them as Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants do their caſting
Counters; ſometimes they ſtand for Pounds, ſometimes for Shillings,
ſometimes for Pence, ſometimes for nothing, according as they be next and
readieſt at Hand to make up their Accounts."</q> In this Part, our Author
acknowledges himſelf much indebted to the Second Part of the Dean of
<hi>Wincheſter</hi>'s Apology, and to <hi>Sam. Huberus</hi> in his
<hi>Anti-Bellarminus.</hi> And having proved theſe Aſſertions, he
proceeds, to lay open the Myſtery and Abuſes of the <hi>Indices
Expurgatorii;</hi> ſhews you the Original, <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0570200100:233"/> Nature,
Uſe and Corruption of this <hi>Inquiſition</hi>; the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
Inquiſitors, Commiſſaries, and Public Notaries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in theſe
<hi>Indices of Books to be forbidden, or purged from whatever impugned the
Church of</hi> Rome. And here he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends the Treatiſe, written by
<hi>Gabriel Putherbeus, De tollendis Libris malis,</hi> 1549, as what has
diſcovered the Wickedneſs of their Biſhops, Prieſts and Monks, better
than any Work our Author knows. In the latter end of this Part, we have a
<hi>Table of the Divinity</hi> Books, firſt ſet forth and approved, then
cenſured by <hi>Papiſts.</hi> This Catalogue contains 323 of their ſaid
<hi>forbidden Books,</hi> which are often noted in what Parts they have been
purged: Among them there are ſome of our own Authors; as <hi>Alcuinus,</hi>
whoſe Book <hi>de Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate, ad Carolum Regem,</hi> printed in <hi>Bibl.
Patrum,</hi> is falſely by <hi>Sextus Senenſis</hi> and others, attributed
to <hi>Calvin</hi>; tho' in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed their Names are one, by a
<hi>Metatheſis</hi> and Change of the Letters. Whereas Copies of it, written
above 500 Years ago, were to be ſeen in the <hi>Prince's Library</hi> at St.
<hi>James's</hi> and elſewhere. St. <hi>Adhelm</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Sherburne</hi> has alſo incurred the <hi>Roman</hi> Cenſure; and the
<hi>Summes</hi> of <hi>Richard Fitz-Rauf,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Armagh,</hi>
againſt the <hi>Armenians,</hi> with his other Treatiſes, are caution'd
againſt, as printed Anno 1511, by <hi>Poſſevine</hi>; and in Biſhop
<hi>Fiſher</hi>'s Book <hi>de Fiducia Dei,</hi> the <hi>Papiſts,</hi>
finding ſome Points againſt them, have pretended it was printed by ſome
<hi>Heretic</hi> in his Name, and even by <hi>Calvin</hi> according to
<hi>Gregory Capuchine.</hi> A ſilly ſhift; for the Book was printed at
<hi>Cologn</hi> in 8<hi>vo</hi> 1556, ſhortly after his Death; and ſince
then no ſuch Matter was ever heard, till of late Years. 
<q rend="inline">"A very likely Matter (ſays our Author) that the
<hi>Papiſts</hi> wou'd ſuffer ſuch a piece of Knavery to lie buried ſo
long. Again, what reaſon have <hi>Proteſtants</hi> to counterfeit ſuch a
Book in a <hi>Papiſt</hi>'s Name? Seeing their <hi>Indices of Books
forbidden, and to be purged,</hi> do furniſh us with a ſufficient Number in
this kind; without any Labour of ours. So much the more are we kindly beholden
unto them, firſt for ſending us unto the beſt <hi>Books,</hi> by their

retracted his Opinion. Much leſs cou'd <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Occham</hi>'s

Oppoſition; the Inquiſitors being ſtill at odds with us and themſelves;
what <hi>Popiſh</hi> Authors, through all Ages, have maintained the Truth of
our Religion; what Books and Editions are to be read by Proteſtants:
laſtly, what is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly denied by the Papiſts, That the Text of the
Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Works is commanded to be purged in their ſeveral <hi>Indices
Expurgatorii,</hi> and plainly proved in this <hi>Table,</hi> by the Mark of a
Hand in the Margin. In this Table, our Author doubts not but many Writers have
ſlipped his Pen, Wherein he deſired not Exactneſs, but to give you a
Taſte only of that ſour Fruit, which they have grafted upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens
Stocks. He has cited nothing without a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Author or Authority. And
as for the Books of Law, Phyſick, and the Arts, which the Papiſts have thus
mangled and disfigured, they are reſerved for ſome other time, this Part
ending at p. 102.</p>
               <p>Part V. <hi>A Remedy againſt all Popiſh Corruptions.</hi>
Herein the Author ſhews how vain it is to find out the Diſeaſes in Books,
without we endeavour to find out the Remedies alſo. This laſt Part,
containing 27 Pages, begins with an Account of the ſundry Ways how Books are
depraved and corrupted, and three Ways propoſed for reforming the ſame.
That the Diſcovery of falſe Treatiſes, in the Name of the Fathers, has in
part been made by the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> Dr. <hi>Reynolds,
Abraham Scultetus,</hi> and eſpecially Maſter <hi>Robert Cooke</hi> of
<hi>Leedes.</hi> How the Corruption of the true Fathers is to be known; and
that thoſe Places purged by the Inquiſitors are to be reſtored as faſt
by the Proteſtants. Of a Catechiſm to be framed for us out of their
Writings: and how Papiſts are to be anſwered by Papiſts. The Collations
of this kind by Mr. <hi>W. Craſhaw,</hi> of the <hi>Temple,</hi> commended.
How the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Falſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions might be ſhortly diſcovered, by
dividing the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation among many Divines. The Profit of Collating prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Books, with the <hi>Indices Expurgatorii.</hi> Their late cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected Editions
to be conſidered and ſuſpected. Of their pretended Diſcovery of loſt
Writers in Caves, Mountains, <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0570200100:235"/>

                  <pb n="208" facs="tcp:0570200100:237"/>
                  <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Popiſh Editions of the Fathers to be compared with
ancient MSS. How the Fathers Works were cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted before, and ſince
Printing; the Ways of correcting them. Our Univerſities and private Libraries
well ſtor'd with MSS. notwithſtanding the great Conſumption of them in
<hi>England.</hi> An Exhortation to private Men not to monopolize, but
communicate their MSS. ſeeing that how commendably ſoever they preſerve
them, little Uſe can be made of them, nor their Authorities ſafely vouch'd,
ſince they are not always to be ſeen, while ſuch Owners are liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and,
when they die, may eaſily miſcarry, by falling into the Hands of ſuch as
regard them not; by whom, as one merrily ſaid, <hi>Monyſcripts</hi> are
more pored upon than <hi>Manuſcripts.</hi> That the Neglect of the Fathers
has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the falſe Editions of them; and that there would be an
End of Controverſy, if their Works were truly printed. An Objection from the
divers Readings of ancient MSS. Another againſt the Antiquity and Integrity
of Copies; with Anſwers. The Satisfaction of ſmall Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences in Copies.
Our <hi>Engliſh</hi> MSS. highly eſteemed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond Seas. Our Founders of
Colleges careful to furniſh their Libraries with rare MSS. maintaining divers
Scholars abroad, to compare, tranſcribe, or procure Originals. That
<hi>Richard Dunelmenſis,</hi> Founder of <hi>Dureſme</hi> College, now
called <hi>Trinity</hi> College, beſtowed many thouſand Pounds <hi>per
Annum</hi> in Books, and moſt of his Books upon the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary he erected in
that College, who, for his exceeding great Love of Learning, did well deſerve
the Name of <hi>Philo-biblos:</hi> See his Book, <hi>De Amore Librorum,</hi>
printed at <hi>Oxford</hi> 1598. <hi>De eo dictumerat, quod haberet plures
Libros quam omnes Pontifices in Anglia.</hi> Which Title and Character, ſince
his Time, is moſt juſtly to be given to Sir <hi>T. Bodley,</hi> whoſe
great Munificence has far ſurpaſſed the Biſhop, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtored his
Magazine, as our Author obſerves, with <hi>eleven</hi> or <hi>twelve
thouſand Volumes</hi>; whereof the greateſt part are in <hi>Folio,</hi> in
all Sciences and Languages, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented by Scholars of all Nations. Here
follows the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his Adverſaries, <hi>Poſſivine</hi> and
<hi>Coſterus,</hi> of the Goodneſs and Plenty of our Books; the Way of
diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing corrected Copies, and to know if they be ancient or not. That
thoſe which are written in a ſet Hand, with great Letters, or in the
<hi>Lombard</hi> or <hi>Saxon</hi> Characters, are of great Antiquity; how far
later MSS. to be eſteemed of. The Objection, that it is a tedious and
needleſs Work to <pb n="209" facs="tcp:0570200100:238"/> collate the Fathers Works, with MSS.
anſwered. The Benefit likely to ariſe of a general Collation.
Commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Eraſmus, and wherein defective, in his Animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions
upon the Fathers Works. That he gave the firſt Alarm of their barbarous
corrupting the Fathers, for which his very Name is in <hi>Maledictione.</hi>
Exhortation to our wealthy Stationers to print the Fathers Works; ſuch as Mr.
<hi>Geo. Biſhop,</hi> Mr. <hi>Bonham Norton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>John
Norton,</hi> who have been choſen Aldermen of <hi>London.</hi> That the
Charge of Printers and Stationers ought to be well recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed. They are
compared to our Merchants-Adventurers. Why, the Hazard being alike in moſt
Books, they ſhould ſeek rather to deſerve well of the ancient Fathers.
The Bible compared, reviſed, and printed this Year, 1611. St.
<hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Works, with ſeveral other of the <hi>Greek</hi>
Fathers, likely to be printed at the unſpeakable Charge of the learned and
judicious Provoſt of <hi>Eton</hi> College, and Warden of <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi>
College in <hi>Oxford,</hi> Sir <hi>Henry Savile,</hi> well ſeen in the
beſt Languages, and moſt of the Liberal Arts. The <hi>Latin</hi> Fathers,
more urged in all Controverſies, ſhould be the ſooner correctly printed.
The Collation and Reviſion of the Fathers Works, a good Inducement to the
printing of them. The Uſe that is made of the MSS. indifferently, both by
Proteſtants and Papiſts; whereof, tho' much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be ſpoken, our
Author, like a weary Traveller, here takes up his reſt; which indeed he might
well need, having gone through ſuch a Variety of Books, as this Work does
manifeſt; and really held it, as <hi>Baronius</hi> pretended to do, a
Religion, to ſay nothing which he could not prove, and to prove nothing but
out of certain, known, and ſufficient Authors. At the End of his
<hi>Advertiſement</hi> mentioned at the beginning, there is an
<hi>Appendix,</hi> ſhewing firſt, how there are Scribes diligently employ'd
in the <hi>Vatican</hi> Libra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, to tranſcribe Acts of the Councils, or
Works of the Fathers; that they can imitate their Copies exactly; that it is
feared they alter and change at the Pope's pleaſure; and that theſe
Tranſcripts in time may be vouched for ancient MSS. And this is more to be
feared, if there is an <hi>Index Expurgatorius</hi> for purging of MSS. as well
as printed Books. <hi>Secondly,</hi> That the unknown Author of <hi>the Grounds
of the Old Religion, and the New,</hi> ſo often mention'd in this Work, is
now known to be one <hi>May,</hi> a Prieſt, a Man neither immodeſt nor
unlearned, yet foully miſtaken in ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry Points of his Anſwer to Mr.
<hi>Craſhaw</hi>'s firſt <hi>Tome</hi> of, <pb n="210" facs="tcp:0570200100:239"/>
                  <hi>Romiſh Forgeries and Falſifications.</hi> What we have laſtly to
obſerve, is, That at the End of the whole Book, there is a <hi>Table</hi> of
the <hi>Authors</hi> mentioned in this <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> with the particular
<hi>Editions</hi> made uſe of throughout the ſame.</p>

<hi>Fathers,</hi> and <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>worthy Families,</hi> whom Virtue,
Birth, and Learning, have juſtly ſtiled <hi>Gentlemen.</hi> And in the
ſaid Addreſs has theſe Aſſeverations;

be) nor to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the natural Reverence due by <hi>younger Brothers</hi>
to their Elder, nor to enkindle Emulation in Families, nor to innovate any
thing to the Prejudice of public or pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Quiet (which none I hope will be
ſo ill-affected as to ſuppoſe) neither mine inoffenſive Zeal for
younger Brothers, among who I am ranked one; nor the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Conſent of
Imperial and Eccleſiaſtical Laws, which I, having a little ſtudied, not a
little reſpect; nor the particular Honour I bear to the Uſages in this
Point of our ancient <hi>Britains,</hi> from whom I am deſcended; nor
deſire to maintain and juſtify an Act in this kind, done by a Friend, whom
I muſt ever reverence; nor yet the hope of bettering my private Fortunes,
which moves Men much in theſe our Times, hath drawn me to this Undertaking:
But principally the ſingular Reſpect, which, as a Patriot, I bear to the
Glory and Good of <hi>Gentlemens Houſes,</hi> whoſe beſt Original,
ſureſt Means of Maintainance, and principal Ornament, is Virtue, or Force
of Mind; the want whereof is a common Cauſe of Ruin. The <hi>free Power</hi>

that are <hi>Children,</hi> be ſo diſcourſed and diſcuſſed, as that
we <hi>younger Brothers</hi> may have Cauſe and Courage to endeavour, by
virtuous Means, to make ourſelves, without the leaſt wrong to any, capable,
if need ſhall be, of the chiefeſt Uſes. And both and all, are ſo
handled, as that no Offence can reaſonably ariſe in any reſpect, much
leſs for that the whole is conceived and written in Nature only of an
Eſſay or Probleme; to which I bind no Man to afford more Belief than
himſelf hath liking of, being free to refute the whole, or any part, at his
pleaſure, as he feels himſelf able or diſpoſed."</q> In the
Concluſion of this <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> the Author obſerves, that nothing in
this <hi>Apology</hi> is defended but by Authority, Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and Example, nor
any Perſon taxed, or particular perſonal Vices; nevertheleſs, if he has
not performed as well as he deſires, or the Cauſe deſerves, he hopes,
that for his good Intention he ſhall be conceived well of: and
ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the two Letters of his Name, <hi>J. A.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Work is divided into <hi>ten Chapters,</hi> whereof the
firſt ſhews the Occaſion of writing this <hi>Apology,</hi> to prove that
a Father may, in ſome Caſes, make any of his Children his Heir, or freely
diſpoſe his worldly Eſtate to which of his Sons he pleaſes, leaving to
the reſt a Competency; and do an Act which may be juſt, according to the
Law of God, of Nature, and of Nations. The 2d Chapter maintains, That the
Grounds of all good Conſtitutions being in Nature, yet ſhe neither before
nor after the Law of Propriety eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd, did command that <hi>all</hi>
ſhould be left to any <hi>one</hi> more than <hi>another:</hi> herein is
alſo ſhewn the happy <hi>Community</hi> of all things in the primitive
Ages; and that <hi>hereditary Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> or Title to Parents Lands or
Goods, was not in uſe till Nature came to be depraved. 3. That the Breach of
ſome written Laws of God, upon Warrant of the primary. Law of Nature, is
without Sin; and that therefore there can be no ſuch Right in
<hi>Primogeniture,</hi> which is not in the Father's Power to avoid, tho' there
were a Precept to the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, as there is not. 4. That Nations beginning to
deviſe ſundry Forms of ſettling <hi>Inheritances,</hi> the
<hi>Romans</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally therein reſpected the free Power of Fathers;
the Right of Children to their Fathers Eſtates, beginning only at 
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0570200100:241"/> their Father's Death. 5. That the preſent Cuſtom of
our Country, of giving <hi>all,</hi> or <hi>almoſt all,</hi> to the
<hi>Eldeſt,</hi> was never ſo begun that it meant to exclude just Remedies
for ſuch Evils, as ſhould grow out of the Abuſe of that Cuſtom, when it
may make Fathers guilty of their Sons Faults, and of their Families Ruin. 6.
That it is no Offence before God, for a Father, being Tenant in
<hi>Fee-ſimple,</hi> to diſinherit the Eldeſt, or to parcel his Eſtate
upon Cauſe; and that extream Vices of <hi>Heirs apparent,</hi> together with
the fewer Means, which younger Brothers have now to live on than heretofore,
crieth out againſt the contrary Opinion. 7. That Fathers, being Tenants in
<hi>Fee-tail,</hi> may likewiſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Scruple of Conſcience,
diſcontinue the <hi>State-tail</hi> upon Cauſe, and deviſe the ſame at
their reaſonable Pleaſure. 8. That <hi>Unthriftineſs</hi> is one known
Name of many hidden Sins, and is alone a ſufficient Cauſe of
<hi>Diſinheriſon,</hi> proved by the Law of God and Man, 9. The main Points
of the Premiſes exemplified in divers particular Facts, as well of Princes as
of private Perſons. 10. That the Law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Equity and Reaſon, confirm
juſt <hi>Diſinheriſon</hi>; and that the riotous Lives of eldeſt
Brothers deſerve that vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Increpation, with <hi>which</hi> the Author
cloſes up this Treatiſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Before we part with this
Subject, we ſhall here take the Opportunity we have, of referring to a couple

Families <hi>and</hi> Houſholds: <hi>Wherein is remember'd that kindly and
provident Regard which</hi> Fathers <hi>ought to have towards their</hi> Sons;

                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Serjeant at Law, by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
<hi>John Newnam:</hi> Is divided into <hi>Two Parts,</hi> and each into five
Chapters, The firſt Part is concerning <hi>Fathers;</hi> ſhewing chiefly
how the Virtues or Vices of their <hi>Children</hi> proceed moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from
their Examples. And the ſecond Part, upon <hi>Step-mothers,</hi> ends with
two Chapters under theſe Titles, <hi>That diſinheriting of the</hi>
eldeſt Son, <hi>without very great</hi> lawful Cauſe, <hi>is an Act very
wrongful and ungodly. That Procurers and Counſellors of Diſinhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon,
and all wrong doing, ought to make or procure Reſtitution.</hi> But as
ſtrong Arguments as there are herein, againſt the diſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heriting of
Heirs, tho' ſeveral Crimes are produced, which they being convicted of, it is
allowed; yet they ſeem match'd in that other Pamphlet we mention'd, which is
a Dialogue, entitled, <hi>A Work worth the Reading: containing five Queſtions
very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, as well for</hi> Parents <hi>to perceive how to beſtow
their</hi> Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren <hi>in</hi> Marriage, <hi>and to diſpoſe their</hi>
Goods <hi>at their</hi> Death, <hi>as for all other Perſons to receive great
Profit by the reſt of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters herein expreſſed:</hi> Newly
publiſhed by <hi>Charles Gibbon,</hi> and <hi>dedicated</hi> to the Right
Worſhipful Sir <hi>Nicholas Bacon.</hi> Q<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 1591. Pages 60. The ſecond
Chapter of this Tract is upon the Queſtion, <hi>Whether the Father may
lawfully diſinherit his Firſt-born</hi>; where, tho' there are Arguments
produced on both ſides of the Queſtion, yet we are induced to diſcard a
leud laviſh Repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate of an <hi>eldeſt Son,</hi> a riotous Spend-thrift,
which is a Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter leſs criminal than thoſe produced by the former
Author, for a <hi>younger</hi> that is dutiful, virtuous, and prudent. For that

<q rend="inline">"a wiſe Man will alter Cuſtom after
Diſcretion, and diſpoſe his Wealth according to Wiſdom."</q> And a
little further, 
<q rend="inline">"Goods are the Gift of God; and he hath
appointed us not to do as we liſt with them, like <hi>Lords,</hi> but to
diſpoſe them well as his <hi>Stewards:</hi> Therefore we ought to beſtow
them on ſuch, where he that gave them may be glorified;"</q> according to the
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's Command, which is here cited. Thus much may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in this
Place, if not to ſatisfy the Reader, yet to inform him where he may meet with
further Satisfaction upon a Subject of this important and univerſal
Concern.</note>.</p>

               <p>THIS curious Book ſo elaborately written upon theſe uncommon
Subjects, and firſt publiſhed by <hi>Reginald Scot,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
in 1584, as appears alſo in the Title-Page of this Edition, had for a while a
very good EfFect upon the <pb n="214" facs="tcp:0570200100:243"/> Kingdom, in purging thoſe
Dregs of Superſtition, to which it ſeems naturally ſubject, by the
<hi>Paroxyſms</hi> into which it has ſo frequently relapſed. <hi>James
Ady,</hi> M. A. in his <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Diſcovery of Witches,</hi> publiſhed in
4to. ten Years after this Edition of Mr. <hi>Scot</hi>'s Book now before us,
tells us, 
<q rend="inline">"It did for ſome time take great Impreſſion
in the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracy, and alſo in the Clergy; but ſince that time,
<hi>England</hi> hath ſhamefully fall'n from the Truth, which they begun to
receive."</q> Further, it appears in the third Book of this Mr. <hi>Ady's
Diſcovery,</hi> which detects the <hi>Vanity</hi> of ſome <hi>Engliſh
Writers</hi> concerning <hi>Witches,</hi> and principally that
<hi>Dialogue</hi> of King <hi>James</hi>'s, called <hi>Demonologie,</hi>
firſt printed at <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> 4to. 1597. that the ſaid King has, in
the <hi>Preface</hi> thereof, chiefly objected to this Work of <hi>Scot</hi>'s;
wherefore, the Reader might expect in the Body of his Majeſty's Pamphlet, to
find our Author notably confuted; but in reading that <hi>Dialogue,</hi> he
ſhall not find one thing or other anſwered, but only a bare Affirmation of
ſuch Tenets, without Ground, or Warrant of Scripture, which were confuted by
<hi>Scot</hi>; as the Tenets of <hi>Bodin, Hyperius, Hemin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> and other
Popiſh Writers; which might yet bring a Diſcredit upon <hi>Scot</hi>'s
Book, in thoſe Underſtandings which are to be dazled by Names that glare
with great Titles or Dignities; but with diſcerning and unbiaſs'd Judges,
an Antagoniſt of ſuch Character and ſuch Conduct, will but raiſe the
Credit of the Works he oppoſes. All we have further to premiſe of our
Author, is from <hi>A. Wood,</hi> who informs us, That he was the younger Son
of Sir <hi>John Scot</hi> of <hi>Scots-Hall,</hi> near <hi>Smeeth</hi> in
<hi>Kent</hi>; that he was bred at <hi>Oxford,</hi> and 
<q rend="inline">"gave himſelf up ſolely to ſolid Reading; to
the Peruſal of obſcure Authors, that had, by the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Scholars,
been neglected."</q> And at Times of leiſure, to Husbandry and Gardening, as
may appear from his <hi>Perfect Platform of a Hop-Garden,</hi> which was the
firſt Treatiſe that had been written upon this Subject, and from this
<hi>Diſcovery of Witchcraft,</hi> which alſo he ſeems to have 
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0570200100:244"/> firſt detected, publickly at leaſt, in our Nation.
In both 
<q rend="inline">"our Author plainly appears to have been well
verſed in many choice Books, and that his ſearch into them was ſo
profound, that nothing ſlipt his Pen which might make for his
Purpoſe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>As to this Work, now under our Inſpection, there are Three
ingenious Epiſtles, publiſh'd by our Author before it. Two of them, to Sir
<hi>Roger Manwood,</hi> Lord Chief Baron of the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> and to Sir
<hi>Thomas Scot</hi>; and the third, to Dr. <hi>Coldwell,</hi> Dean of
<hi>Rocheſter,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Readman,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deacon of
<hi>Canterbury.</hi> Then follows his <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the
<hi>Reader</hi>; in which he ſolemnly profeſſes, his Drift in this
Undertak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was, That the Power and Glory of God ſhou'd not be abridg'd or
abaſed; that Religion might ſtand without the Trumpery of ſuch
Impoſtures; and that Compaſſion might be uſed towards thoſe poor
ignorant Souls, who are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly accuſed, and ſometimes credulouſly
confeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves guilty of Witchcraft. At the End of this Epiſtle,
there is a <hi>Table</hi> of between two and three Hundred Authors uſed in
the enſuing Work, which is divided into <hi>Sixteen Books,</hi> and they into
many Chapters; beginning with an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment of the Power of Witches in
Meteors, and Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary bodies, tending to the Rebuke of ſuch as attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
too much unto them. So proceeds in the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to the Inconvenience
growing by Men's Credulity here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and a Reproof of ſome Churchmen inclined
to the common Opinion of Witches Omnipotency, with a familiar Example thereof,
in the Story of <hi>Margaret Simons</hi> of <hi>Brenchley</hi> in
<hi>Kent,</hi> who being accuſed of Witchcraft, by <hi>John Ferral</hi> Vicar
of that Pariſh, was arraign'd in 1581 at <hi>Rocheſter</hi>; but one of the
Jury being wiſer than the reſt, ſhe was acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. Next we have a
Deſcription of thoſe who are called Witches, the Motives to their being
thought and thinking themſelves Witches. What miraculous Acts are imputed to
them, by Witchmongers, Papiſts and Poets. Confutations of the Opinion of
Witchcraft, and the Sin of repairing to <hi>Witches</hi> for help; how their
Name became ſo famous, and how variouſly People think of them. Cauſes why
<hi>Witches</hi> themſelves, as well as others, believe they can work
Impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities, with Anſwers to certain Objections, where alſo their
Puniſhment by Law is touch'd, and ſome late credulous Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications
reflected on. This Book concludes with an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignment of the Cruelties

Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers and Inquiſitors.</p>
               <p>The Second Book ſhews what infamous Witneſſes are allowed to
give Evidence againſt reputed Witches, and upon what hard Conditions to be
challeng'd; as <hi>James Sprenger,</hi> and <hi>Henry Inſtitor,</hi> from
whom <hi>Bodin,</hi> and other Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of Witchmongers receive their Light,
allow. Next follows, the Order of their Examination, with an Account of the
<hi>Scottiſh</hi> Cuſtoms of accuſing Witches, and King
<hi>Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debert</hi>'s cruel Device. Matters of Evidence againſt them. Their
Confeſſions. Preſumptions whereby they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned. Interrogatories by

Witchcraft. That it is no wonder Witches condemn themſelves, thro' the
Barbarities uſed in extorting their Confeſſions.</p>
               <p>The Third Book lays open the Bargains charged upon theſe reputed
Witches with the Devil, by ſeveral Popiſh Witchmongers here mention'd; with
the Order of their Homage to the Devil: Their Songs, Dances, Excourſes,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Their Summons to appear before the Devil; riding in the Air,
Conferences, Supplies, Sacrifices, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That there can be no real
League made with the Devil, with the weak Proofs of the Adverſaries for the
ſame. Of the private League with the Devil. <hi>Bodin</hi>'s fabulous Miracle
of the <hi>French</hi> Lady, tranſported from <hi>Lions</hi> to
<hi>Lorrain</hi> by an Oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. A Diſproof of their Aſſemblies and
their Bargains. A Confutation of the Objection concerning Witches
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions. What folly it were for Witches to undergo ſuch de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate

they meet with; and how it comes to paſs they are overthrown by their
Confeſſions. How Melancholy abuſes old Women, and the Effects thereof in
ſundry Examples. That voluntary Confeſſions may be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truly made, tho' to
the undoing of the Confeſſors, and of the ſtrange Operation of
Melancholy, proved by a late In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the ſtory, of <hi>Ade Davie</hi>
of <hi>Sellenge</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrange Effects of Melancholy;

Anſwers to the four Capital Crimes ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt Witches. The Author's
Requeſt that his chaſte Readers wou'd overlook Eight Chapters in the
fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Book, reciting ſome lewd Feats aſcribed to Witches by Doctors of
Popiſh Divinity; with his Apology for the ſame, as neceſſary to be
detected.</p>
               <p>The Fourth Book expoſes the preſumptuous Opinions of
Witchmongers, in aſcribing the ſuperior Power to evil Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, of framing
themſelves in more excellent ſort than God has made us; with their abſurd
Aſſertions of the incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conjunctions of Witches with
<hi>Incubus</hi>; that ſince the Year 1400, they have conſented willingly
to the Carnal Embraces of this Diabolical Phantom, and that many Witches burn'd
at <hi>Ravenſpurge,</hi> confeſſed ſuch Carnal Knowledge for many Years
together; with many other Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets of the ſaid unaccountable Intercourſe,
moſt groſſly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philoſophical, and improbable to have met with the
Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they have done among the moſt Ignorant; ſuch as the Devil's
viſible Dealings with Women in this kind, the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of Witches to obſtruct
Generation, and their ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally depriving Men of the <hi>Paris</hi>
thereof. The Legend of St. <hi>Sylvanus</hi> perſonated by <hi>Incubus,</hi>
and of St. <hi>Chriſtina,</hi> who charitably ſupplying the Place of a
Female oppreſs'd with one, was ſhrewdly accloy'd: Alſo another ridiculous
Legend of St. <hi>Bernard,</hi> with the Tradition of yellow-hair'd Maids being
moſt encumber'd with <hi>Incubus</hi>; and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witchery of married Men, to
uſe other Mens Wives in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of their own: how to procure the
diſſolving of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>witched Love, and enforce Men to love old Hags; with the
relation of a lewd Trick of a Prieſt in <hi>Gelderland.</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances 
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0570200100:247"/> of divers Saints, very letcherouſly diſpoſed and
mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly render'd chaſte. A recital of certain Popiſh and Magical
Cures for thoſe who are bewitch'd in their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, among which we have
the wiſe diſtinction of <hi>Hoſtienſis,</hi> between Frigidity and
Witchcraft; alſo Sir <hi>Thomas More</hi>'s Receipt to procure Generation
mention'd, but not recited even in <hi>Latin,</hi> as the former is; being too
groſs in our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's mind for Repetition. This Chapter concludes with the
pious Offering made by <hi>Katharine Loe,</hi> of a waxen Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance of the
Parts affected in her impotent Husband, at the Altar of St. <hi>Anthony</hi>
for his Recovery. After theſe, and the Narrative of another Cure performed on
a Hag-rid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Maſs-Prieſt, from the Account of <hi>Jaſon
Pratenſis;</hi> This Book concludes with a Confutation of theſe Follies
touching <hi>Incubus</hi> and <hi>Succubus,</hi> ſhewing them to be nothing
but Popiſh Impoſture and Knavery, to cover the ſhameful Debaucheries of
the <hi>Eccleſiaſticks</hi> and their <hi>Concubines:</hi> That <hi>Robin
Goodfellow</hi> was nothing but a luſty coſening Frier; and that there can
be no Carnal Copulation with Spirits, much leſs any Offspring therefrom,
whatever <hi>Hyperius,</hi> and other ſuch Deceivers write of our
<hi>Merlin:</hi> That <hi>Incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus</hi> is a natural Diſeaſe, and of the
Remedies preſcribed for the ſame; with the Deriſion which
<hi>Chaucer,</hi> who had ſeen through theſe <hi>Popiſh</hi>
Abominations, long ſince made of the Prieſts, under that Name, quoted from
his own Verſes in the <hi>Wife of Bath</hi>'s Tale.</p>
               <p>The Fifth Book lays open and confutes with many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and
Authorities, the abſurd Accounts of <hi>Transfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations</hi> by Sorcery,
into Wolves, Aſſes, Cats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers the Witchmongers
Objections concerning <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar,</hi> with their Error relating to
<hi>Lycanthropia</hi>; and anſwers alſo their Arguments for
<hi>Tranſportation,</hi> and from the Calamities of <hi>Job</hi>; concluding
with the ſeveral ſorts of Witches mention'd in the Scriptures, and how the
word Witch is there apply'd.</p>
               <p>The Sixth Book begins with an Expoſition of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi>
Word <hi>Chaſaph,</hi> wherein is anſwer'd that Objection in <hi>Exodus,
Thou ſhalt not ſuffer a Witch to live</hi>; alſo of <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Magus</hi>
in <hi>Acts</hi> 8. An Explanation alſo of that Place in
<hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> wherein are recited all kind of Witches, with a
Confutation of their Opinions, who hold they can work ſuch Miracles, as are
imputed to them. Obſervations upon the Uſe of Poiſon, by Women in all
Ages more than Men. Of divers Practitioners with Poiſon in many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, 
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0570200100:248"/> called <hi>Veneficia.</hi> A great Objection anſwer'd
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this kind of Witchcraft called <hi>Veneficium.</hi> What
Confections uſed therein. Of Philtres, or Love-Potions, and the ſame
confuted by Poets. Proofs that ſuch Potions rather promote Death tbro' their
Venom, than Love by Art; with a recital of many ſimple Ingredients, on which
this Power is impoſed. And this Chapter concludes, with <hi>Bodin</hi>'s
Charge of falſe <hi>Greek,</hi> and falſe Interpretation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
againſt <hi>John Wier,</hi> retorted upon himſelf.</p>
               <p>The Seventh Book begins with explaining the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word
<hi>Ob</hi> in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> tranſlated <hi>Pytho</hi> or
<hi>Phyoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus Spiritus</hi>; which <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word ſignifying moſt
properly a Bottle, is there uſed becauſe the <hi>Pythoniſts</hi> ſpake
<hi>hollow,</hi> as in the bottom of their Bellies, whereby they are aptly in
<hi>Latin</hi> call'd <hi>Ventriloqui</hi>; of which ſort was <hi>Elizabeth
Barton</hi> the <hi>Holy Maid of Kent,</hi> &amp;c. by which Faculty they many
times overthrow the good Fame of honeſt Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. But our Author
paſſing over a hundred Coſenages he cou'd recite of this kind; does here
give us a large and true Story of a Wench named <hi>Mildred Norrington,</hi>
practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing her diabolical Witchcraft by this <hi>Ventriloquy, Anno</hi>
1574, at <hi>Weſtwell</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> ſix Miles from his own
Houſe; with the Account of her detection before two diſcreet Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices,
named <hi>Thomas Wotton</hi> of <hi>Bocton Malherb,</hi> and <hi>George
Darrel,</hi> Eſqs; Here, ſays our Author, compare this Wench with the Witch
of <hi>Endor,</hi> and you ſhall ſee that both the Coſenages may be done
by one Art. The Diſcovery alſo of other ſuch Deceivers, as <hi>Agnes
Brigs,</hi> and <hi>Rachel Pinder</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> who diſgorged
Pins, Clouts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> at
<hi>Maidſtone,</hi> named <hi>John Stiklebow,</hi> who was
diſpoſſeſs'd of Ten Devils in 1572, according to the Pamphlet then
printed. The Abuſes of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Oracle; the Apoſtle's miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of Spirits, with Arguments that they can aſſume no Shapes. Further of
<hi>Apollo</hi>'s Witches call'd <hi>Pythoniſts,</hi> and of
<hi>Gregory</hi>'s Letter to the Devil, with a Compariſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Idol
of <hi>Apollo,</hi> and our Rood of Grace, thro' the help of little St.
<hi>Rumbal</hi> at <hi>Boxly</hi> in <hi>Kent.</hi> How many learned Men have
been deluded in their Writings upon this Subject of Spirits. More of the Witch
of <hi>Endor,</hi> and that <hi>Samuel</hi> was not raiſed indeed; the Dotage
of <hi>Bodin</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Papiſts</hi> herein, and that Souls cannot
be raiſed by Witchcraft. That neither the Devil nor <hi>Samuel</hi> were
raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but that it was a mere Trick according to the Guiſe of our
<hi>Pythoniſts.</hi> Anſwers to the Objections of our Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers 
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0570200100:249"/> in this Caſe. Expoſitions of the Places in
Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhewing how <hi>Saul</hi> was abuſed, and how it might all be
wrought by <hi>Ventriloquy.</hi> With other Opinions produced and anſwer'd,
tending to prove that our Miracles are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Knaveries, and eſpecially of
the Prieſts; that ſince <hi>Luther</hi>'s Time theſe Spirits, Hags,
Fairies, Imps, Incubi, Robin Goodfellows, Men in the Oak, Puckles, Fire-drakes,
Hobgoblins, Tom-thumbs, and all the reſt of this Black Brood of Bull-beggars,
have much vaniſh'd and very little appear'd; and laſtly, that thoſe who
will credit the Stories of Witches, muſt allow as much to their Power of
working Miracles, as to that of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Eighth Book ſhews us how Miracles, the Gift of Prophecy, and
Oracles are ceaſed; with a recital of <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi>'s Tale, believed by
many learned Men, of the <hi>Devil</hi>'s <hi>Death</hi>; and another out of
the <hi>Golden Legend</hi> of a <hi>godly Devil.</hi> The Judgment of the
Fathers upon Oracles, and their Aboliſhment, with their Tranſplantation
from <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phos</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi>; alſo where, when, and how the
prieſtly Sorcerers wrought their Feats of old; and when they ceaſed in
<hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Ninth Book expounds the word <hi>Kaſam</hi> or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
proves from Scripture the Lawfulneſs of making Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the

Virtues falſely aſcribed to ſuch Charms and Amulets, by ancient
Writers.</p>
               <p>The Thirteenth Book opens with explaining the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Word
<hi>Hartumim</hi> or Natural Magic, and ſhews how the Antients travell'd for
the Knowledge thereof. Of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Knowledge therein, the
diſtinction thereof, and why it is condemn'd for Witchcraft. That this Study
teacheth only the Works of Nature: What wonderful Effects are diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver'd by
it in Waters, Precious Stones, with the Uſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of by Magicians; the
Sympathy and Antipathy of Natural and Elementary Bodies, particularly of two
notorious Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders not marvell'd at. The one a Piece of Earth which would fly
the hot Steel with great ſwiftneſs, and purſue Gold as faſt, with other
Properties more incredible; the other a ſtrange Stone which wou'd ſhine
bright in the Dark, always labour'd to aſcend, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But the
former of theſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found to ſignify a Man, the latter a Fire; our
Author applies the manner of Expreſſion to that often uſed in Magic,
which ſometimes conſiſts as well in the deceit of Words as ſlight of
Hand; and this introduces the Illuſions and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deracies here diſplay'd
in the Art of <hi>Legerdemain.</hi> Here he obſerves the Admiration there was
at <hi>Brandon</hi> the Juggler, who by the Wounds and Words he uſed upon the
Picture of a <hi>Dove</hi> painted on the Wall, promiſed the King before 
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0570200100:252"/> whom he performed, perhaps <hi>Edward</hi> VI. it being
ſtill in remembrance, that a live Dove then on the Houſe-Top ſhould fall
down dead; which it did accordingly: The Juggler was forbidden the Practice of
this Feat, as if he could murder any body ſo in Effigie, tho' the Myſtery
being here revealed, he appeared not to have more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Power than any
other body. We have here alſo many other of the Juggler's Tricks recited and
revealed. Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Magicians, a Compariſon
between them and our Witches. Many ſtrange Experiments by Glaſſes, and
the perſpective Art. Remarks on the Feats of <hi>Jannes</hi> and
<hi>Jambres</hi>; alſo on <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Aſs. But the Trick which was
called the <hi>Decollation</hi> of <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> perform'd by one
<hi>Kingsfield,</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> in 1582, was long practiſed with
great Surprize to the Spectators; as the League of <hi>Stephen Taylor</hi> and
one <hi>Pope,</hi> the one to ſteal Horſes, and the other to diſcover
them, ſeems to have been with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Confederates. But the moſt
dexterous Fellow for <hi>Legerdemain,</hi> in our Author's Time, was <hi>John
Cauta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res</hi> of St. <hi>Martin's</hi>; not that himſelf was a mean
Artiſt: for ſays he, 
<q rend="inline">"If Time, Place, and Occaſion ſerve, I can
ſhew ſo much herein, that, I am ſure, <hi>Bodin, Spinaeus,</hi> and
<hi>Vairus</hi> would ſwear I were a Witch, and had a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar Devil at
Commandment: But truly my Study and Travel herein, hath only been employed to
the end I might prove them Fools, and find out the Fraud of them that make them
Fools, as whereby they may become wiſer, and God may have that which to him
belongeth."</q> With this, and the Patters or Prints, of ſome juggling
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments before-mentioned, our Author ends this Chapter.</p>
               <p>The Fourteenth Book treats of the Craft of Alchemy, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
<hi>Chaucer</hi>'s Character and Opinion of Alchemiſts, and their Terms of
Art. Their Pretenſions by the Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers Stone and Waters, with other
Characters, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tections of them, by <hi>Chaucer</hi> in his
<hi>Chanon</hi>'s Yeoman's Tale. Several Stories of Perſons couſened by
Alchemiſts, among the reſt, that of <hi>Eraſmus</hi> in his
<hi>Colloquies.</hi> The Opinion of ſome learned Men touching the Folly of
Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemy, as <hi>Avicenna, Petrarch, &amp;c.</hi> That vain and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Hope
is the Cauſe of Deluſion hereby, ending with the Story of the Courtier, who
gave King <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. a fine Horſe, becauſe his Majeſty had given
a Peaſant (who had of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten entertained him in his Hunting Diverſions) a
thouſand <pb n="224" facs="tcp:0570200100:253"/> Crowns for a Turnip; in hopes of a
proportionable Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but received the Countryman's Preſent for his
own.</p>
               <p>The fifteenth Book having ſhewn the Significations of the Word
<hi>Jidoni,</hi> a ſort of Conjurers, whom our Author calls No ſmall Fools,
as not going to work with a Toad or a Cat, as Witches do, but with a kind of
Majeſty call up by Name, and have at Command, no leſs than ſeventy-nine
principal and princely Devils, who have under them, as their Miniſters, many
Legions of petty Devils: and we have here a Liſt of all their Names, with an
Account of their Shapes, Powers, Government, their ſeveral Segnio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and
Degrees: The Work of one <hi>T. R.</hi> in 1570. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto is joined, the
Hours wherein it is pretended, that the principal Devils may be bound or
raiſed, and reſtrained from doing hurt. After which follows a Confutation
of the manifold Vanities in theſe Accounts, and of the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions derived
from the planetary Aſpects and Motions; whereof we have here ſeveral
Tables, with their Characters. The Forms used in the pretended Conjurations of
the Spirits of dead Perſons, and for finding hidden Treaſures. The
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juration of the three Fairy Siſters for the Ring of Inviſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and
for the encloſing of Spirits in a Cryſtal Stone; with Types or Figures
explaining the ſame. The Receipt for making of Holy-water; Compacts with
departing Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to appear, and be bound, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then follows a
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of this kind of Conjuration of raiſing, binding, and
diſmiſſing of the Devil, going inviſible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> into which
the Aſſaſſine was deluded, who murdered the Prince of <hi>Orange,</hi>
1582. Alſo an Obſervation, that the chief Authors among us of thoſe
Conjurations were <hi>T. R.</hi> before-menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, and <hi>John Cokers.</hi> A
Compariſon between Popiſh Exorciſts and Conjurers. The Detection of a
late couſening Conjuration practiſed at <hi>Orleans</hi> by the
<hi>Franciſcans.</hi> Who may be Conjurers in the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church,
beſides Prieſts; a ridiculous Definition of Superſtition. Why there were
no Conjurers in the Primitive Church; and that it is more difficult to conjure
the Devil out of one bewitched, than one poſſeſſed; with many other
abſurd Diſtinctions. Some Conjurations taken out of the Pontifical and out
of the Miſſal. The Rules of Popiſh Exorciſts, and other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers, all
one; and how St. <hi>Martin</hi> conjured the Devil. That it is a ſhame for
Papiſts to believe other Conjurers Doings, their own being of ſo little
force; with <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>'s Opinion of the Art. How Conjurers have
beguiled <pb n="225" facs="tcp:0570200100:254"/> Witches. What Books they carry about to procure
Credit-Wicked Aſſertions by the Ancients againſt <hi>Moſes</hi> and
<hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph.</hi> All magical Arts confuted, by an Argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<hi>Nero.</hi> What <hi>Cornelius Agrippa</hi> and <hi>Carolus Gallus</hi> have
left written thereof, and proved by Experience. Of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s
Conjurations from <hi>Joſephus, P. Lombard, Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, Durandus,</hi> and the
Leſſons of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church upon St. <hi>Margaret</hi>'s Day.
Thoſe Leſſons tranſlated, and a ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Story of that St.
<hi>Margaret</hi> cited. Some other Popiſh Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles. Of Viſions, Noiſes,
Apparitions and imagin'd Sounds; wandering Souls, and other Illuſions, with a
Confutation thereof. <hi>Cardan</hi>'s Opinion of ſtrange Noiſes; how
coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeit Viſions grow into Credit. Of <hi>Boniface</hi> his Knavery in
counterfeiting a Voice from Heaven, by which he got the Popedom of his ſilly
Predeceſſor <hi>Coeleſtinus.</hi> Of Echos, and <hi>Cardan</hi>'s odd
Story or a Man who was near being drowned by one; and of the ſtrange Noiſe
at <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> which was ſo much wondered at about 1569, tho'
indeed a meer natural Noiſe engendered by the Wind and other concurring
Cauſes. Of <hi>Theurgy,</hi> or working by good An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, with the appendent
Arts, and the Rejection thereof, as altogether papiſtical and
ſuperſtitious; more particularly expoſed in a Letter here recited, which
was ſent to our Author by <hi>T. E.</hi> Maſter of Arts, Practiſer both
of Phyſick, and alſo, in times paſt, of certain vain Sciences, for which
he was now, 1582, in Priſon, and condemned to die. In this Letter, it is
confeſſed by the Writer of it, that in twenty-ſix Years practice of
theſe ſecret Arts, and converſe with thoſe moſt familiar in them, he
could meet with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing true as pretended, or ſupernatural Performance, but
that it was all Impoſture and Deluſion; and recommends a Book written in
the old <hi>Saxon</hi> Tongue, by one Sir <hi>John Malborne,</hi> a Divine of
<hi>Oxenford,</hi> three hundred Years paſt, detecting the Devices of
Conjuration, or opening all the Illuſions and Inventions of theſe Arts and
Sciences; which Book this Letter-writer had left with the Parſon of
<hi>Slang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> in <hi>Suſſex</hi>; where, he tells our Author, if he
would ſend for it in his Name, he might have it: But tho' he did ſend, and
uſed the Intereſt of Men of Worſhip and Credit, particularly of the
Knight of the Shire, who would have paſſed his word for the Reſtitution,
yet ſuch was the Folly and Superſtition of this Parſon, that he would not
lend it for our Author's Peruſal. But, in truth, he had ſo
induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly ſtored himſelf with other <hi>Authorities</hi> and
<hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gences,</hi> 
                  <pb n="226" facs="tcp:0570200100:255"/> that he appears to have little
needed thoſe which this Book might have afforded; inſomuch, that whatever
lay clouded or ſhadowed in the Face of Truth, by this frightful Grey-Beard of
Superſtition, ſeems here diſcovered by the Light of thoſe Authorities,
and that of Reaſon, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this ryming old Verſe; 
<q> 
                     <l>Quicquid Nix celat, Solis calor omne revelat.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſixteenth Book contains a Concluſion, in manner of an
Epilogue, repeating many of the former Abſurdities of Witchmongers, with
Confutations thereof, and the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities of <hi>James Sprenger</hi> and
<hi>Henry Inſtitor,</hi> Inquiſitors and Compilers of <hi>Malleus
Maleficarum;</hi> more particularly by what means the Vulgar have been brought
to believe in Witches; with a Definition and Deſcription of Witchcraft.
Reaſons to prove that their Charms, Characters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are all
Fables, and that thoſe who uſe, them are all Cheats; and from the
Confeſſions of the moſt notorious among them, more eſpecially Mother
<hi>Bungie,</hi> who, in divers Books, ſet out with Authority, is
regiſtered and chronicled, by the Name of the Great Witch of
<hi>Rocheſter</hi>; who, on her Death-bed, confeſſed, That her Cunning
conſiſted only in deluding and deceiving the People with ſome little
Skill in Phyſick, and the Aſſiſtance of a Friend, named <hi>Heron,</hi>
which was all the Spirit or Devil ſhe had, whatever the World had been
impoſed on to believe. Further Detec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of theſe Knaveries in one ſo
bewitched, that he could read no Scripture but canonical, and a Devil that
could ſpeak no <hi>Latin.</hi> Of the Divination by the Sieve and Sheers, and
by the Book and Key: <hi>Hemingius</hi> his Opinion thereof confuted, and many
other juggling Deluſions. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of believing in the Devil's
Transformation, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming of different Shapes, exemplified in the
Instances of Chriſt's Argument to <hi>Thomas</hi>; the Inhabitant of
<hi>Tigurie,</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to be in wicked Dealings with a Mare, as
<hi>Lavater</hi> records; and the Story of Queen <hi>Cunegunda</hi> from
<hi>Crantzius,</hi> with her Purgation by the Fiery Ordeal, or <hi>Candentis
Ferri.</hi> After another idle Story expos'd, of the Devil preaching holy
Doctrine, in the ſhape of a Prieſt, and Arguments to ſhew what a ſhame
it is, after Confutation of the greater Witchcratfs, for any Man to give credit
to the leſſer Points thereof, we have a general Concluſion againſt
thoſe whom this Book concerns; which, with two or three Chapters upon natural
Witchcraft, or Faſcination, bewitching Eyes for Hatred and for Love,
concludes the whole ſixteen Book.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="tcp:0570200100:256"/>Then follows a Diſcourſe upon Devils or
Spirits; and firſt of Philoſophers Opinions; alſo the Manner of their
reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereupon, and the ſame confuted. Herein the Author proceeds to
ſhew how unſatisfactorily all Authors have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon this Subject;
particularly <hi>Pſellus,</hi> whoſe abſurd Aſſertions are here
expoſed; as alſo <hi>Cardan</hi>'s about his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Familiar Devil.
<hi>Plato</hi>'s Opinion of Spirits, and of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates</hi>'s familiar
Devil. The nine Orders of Spirits and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, according to <hi>Plato</hi> and
<hi>Dionyſius.</hi> The meaning of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel, according to Mr.
<hi>Deering,</hi> our Author's Kinſman, in his Lecture upon the
<hi>Hebrews.</hi> The Commencement of Devils fondly gathered out of the 14th of
<hi>Iſaiah.</hi> Of <hi>Lucifer</hi> and his Fall; the Opinion of the
<hi>Cabaliſts, Talmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts</hi> and Schoolmen, of the Creation of Angels.
The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention between the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Church about the
Fall; and among the Papiſts. Enquiries where the Battle was fought between
<hi>Michael</hi> and <hi>Lucifer,</hi> how long it continued, and what their
Forces. Other fond Opinions about the fallen Angels, particularly among the
<hi>Rabbins,</hi> Reaſons a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Devil's Uglineſs. That the Devil's
Aſſaults are ſpiritual, and how groſſly ſome underſtand the
Scriptures herein. The Equivocation of the word Spirit, and how diverſely
taken in the Scriptures. Of Chriſt's healing the Blind, and of thoſe
poſſeſſed with Devils in the Goſpel, or Lunacy, and other
Diſeaſes. How the word Devil is to be underſtood, both in the ſingular
and plural Number. The Variation of Authors about Spirits and Souls. Popiſh
Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of Spirits; of Day-devils, and Night-devils. That the Devils
mentioned in Scripture, have their Nature and Qualities in their Names, here
mentioned and interpreted. The Idols or Gods of the Gentiles diſtinguiſhed.
Their <hi>Lares, Larvae, Manes, Daemones,</hi> and <hi>Virunculi Terrei,
&amp;c.</hi> ſuch as was <hi>Robin Godfellow</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> who
would ſupply the Office of Servants, ſpecially of Maids; and
<hi>Hudgin,</hi> a very familiar and ſociable Hobgoblin in <hi>Germany,</hi>
ſo called becauſe he always wore a Cap or Hood; therefore our Author thinks
him a kind of <hi>Robin Hood;</hi> and that our Fryar <hi>Ruſh</hi> was
altogether ſuch another Fellow, brought up in the ſame School, the Kitchen,
inſomuch as the ſelf-ſame Tale is written of one as the other, about the
Scullion ſaid to have been ſlain, <hi>&amp;c</hi> for the reading whereof,
we are referred to Friar <hi>Ruſh</hi>'s Story, or elſe to <hi>John Wierus,
De praeſtigiis Daemonum.</hi> Further of the <hi>Romans</hi> chief Gods,

<pb n="228" facs="tcp:0570200100:257"/> Popiſh provincial Gods, as St. <hi>George,</hi> St.
<hi>Andrew,</hi> &amp;c. A Compariſon between them and Heathen Gods, where it
appears we have had as great Traitors, as great Whores, as great Quacks and
Impoſtors, among our ſanctified and ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonized Tribe, as the beſt of
them. And whereas our ancient Saints were Patrons only over ſome one Province
of Health, or had Power to cure only one Diſeaſe, nothing comes amiſs to
our Moderns thro' the Omnipotency of Witchcraft, yea greater Matters aſcribed
to their Powers, than to all other Saints; witneſs S. Mother <hi>Bongie,</hi>

divers more, who deſerve to be regiſtered in the Pope's Kalendar, or the
Devil's Rubric. Then follows a Compariſon between the Heathens and the
Papiſts, touching their Excuſes for Idolatry. The Idolatry of the Council
of <hi>Trent.</hi> A notable Story of a Hangman arraign'd, after he was dead
and buried, taken from our Lady's <hi>Roſary</hi>; with a Confutation

its Hundreds, Seats, Rivers, Towns, Caſtles,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Adorned with
Maps and Proſpects, with the Coats of Arms belonging to every Family.
Performed by</hi> W. SMITH <hi>and</hi> W. WEBB, <hi>Gentlemen: Publiſhed by
Mr.</hi> DANIEL KING. <hi>To which is annexed,</hi> a Chronology <hi>of all its
Rulers and Governors, in Church and State. Alſo an excellent Diyſcourſe
of the Iſle of</hi> MAN. Fol. 1656<note n="*" place="bottom">Thus the common
printed Title; but there is alſo a Title-Page printed from a Copper Plate
bound before it, which entitles the Book more briefly, <hi>A Deſcription
Hiſtorical and Geographical of the County Palatine of</hi> Cheſter,
<hi>illuſtrated with divers Figures cut in Copper, and publiſh'd by</hi>
Daniel King <hi>of</hi> Cheſter, 1656. 'Tis inviron'd with Branches forming
an Oval, containing the Arms of all the Earls of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> from
<hi>Hugh Lupus</hi> to <hi>Henry,</hi> eldeſt Son of King <hi>James</hi> I.
and on the Sides thereof, are two Standards ſupported by Wolves, and bearing
the Arms of the County; which are in one of them, 3 Wheat-Sheaves; and in the
other, a Wolf's Head eraz'd. As for this Publiſher, <hi>Daniel King,</hi>
tho' <hi>Ant. Wood</hi> might receive a private Character of him from a noted
Author, in a Letter, intimating he was an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and knaviſh Fellow, we
ſee not, with what Juſtice the ſame is publiſhed, in relation to this
Book. It is plain, that he commendably procured theſe Accounts of
<hi>Cheſter,</hi> which might never have ſeen the Light but for him; and
has faithfully pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed them, juſtly aſcribing every Part to its due
Owner; that he hath induſtriouſly adorned them with many Sculptures; has
aſſumed no part to himſelf but what was viſibly his own, and was in
ſo much Credit with the Gentry of the County, that many of them were
evidently his Patrons, and Encouragers: wherefore we cannot but think rather
with Dr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> That ſeeing this <hi>Daniel King</hi> had, in his
Travels, got the Myſtery both of <hi>Surveying</hi> and <hi>Engraving,</hi>
and uſed the ſame to enliven the <hi>Deſcriptions</hi> above, which he
ſet forth, with ſo many Cuts of <hi>Heraldry</hi> and <hi>Topography,</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">"That <hi>Cheſhire</hi> is chiefly behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
to his Pains."</q> Nay, he further acknowledges himſelf ſo much beholden to
the particular Courteſy of the Man, through his many Communications, as to
have verefied his <hi>Anagram,</hi> and been even a <hi>kind Angel</hi> to
him.</note>.</bibl>

               <p>THIS Collection is dedicated by the ſaid <hi>Daniel King</hi> to
the Worſhipful Sir <hi>Orlando Bridgman.</hi> Then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a Letter to the

hand thro' the Merits of his <pb n="230" facs="tcp:0570200100:259"/> Labours therein. After
which, we have Verſes in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh,</hi> upon the
ſame, and another Letter to him, by his Friend <hi>Thomas Brown.</hi> In his
Preface to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, we learn, that the firſt Part of this Volume was the
Work of <hi>William Smith,</hi> long ſince <hi>Rouge-dragon,</hi>
Purſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant at Arms, and communicated to him by Mr. <hi>Ranulph Crew,</hi>
Grandſon to the Lord Chief Juſtice <hi>Crew,</hi> in whoſe hands the Copy
was left. The ſecond, was the Work of Mr. <hi>William Webb,</hi> heretofore a
Clerk in the Mayor's Court at <hi>Chester</hi>; and this was imparted by that
great Lover of Antiquities, Sir <hi>Simon Archer</hi> of <hi>Tanworth</hi> in
<hi>Warwick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</hi> Both theſe Pieces relate purely to the County
Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> The third, touching the <hi>Iſle of
Man,</hi> was written by Mr. <hi>James Chaloner,</hi> whoſe Abilities in
hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Matters, the Work itſelf will ſpeak. To all which are added
by this Publiſher, ſeveral Proſpects and other Pieces of Sculpture, for
the better Ornament of the whole; as alſo, thro' the help of ſome that were
Well-wiſhers thereto, A Tranſlation of divers Foundation-Charters, with
other things of good Note. Then follows this Remark, 
<q rend="inline">"That there is no County in <hi>England</hi> more
famous for a long-continued Succeſſion <hi>of ancient Gentry</hi> than this
of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> will not be denied, nor any that can afford Materials
with ſo little Trouble and Charge, for the ſetting forth their
<hi>Deſcents</hi> and memorable <hi>Imployments,</hi> inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as the
Subſtance of all public Records meerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thereto, for almoſt 400
Years, are carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in the Caſtle at <hi>Cheſter</hi>; and
that the private Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences concerning the particular Families of that County,
are, by reaſon of their long Duration, leſs diſperſed than thoſe of
many others be thro' the great and frequent Changes that have befallen them in
moſt Places."</q> But our Publiſher, apprehenſive, belike, that his
Authors, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they may have preſerved many worthy Memorials, had not made
all the Advantage they might have done of thoſe Records, 
<q rend="inline">"hopes therefore, that theſe Eſſays of the
Perſons <pb n="231" facs="tcp:0570200100:260"/> above-mentioned, now coming to the View of the
World, will for the Reaſons before expreſs'd, conſidering the
Worthineſs of the Subject, ſtir up ſuch whoſe greater Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities may,
by a more exact Survey and Search into the Antiquities of this Shire,
contribute further to its Honour, by reſtoring to Light its ancient Glory,
for the more am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Content of all Perſons concerned therein, and their own
laſting Memory."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After this Preface, we have the Publiſher's Map of the County
Palatine of Cheſter, which Mr. <hi>Randolph Crew</hi> had drawn with a Pen.
Then begins the Work under the Title of, <hi>The Vale Royal of England,</hi>
with <hi>a Catalogue of the Kings of Mercia,</hi> or <hi>March</hi>; which
Kingdom in the <hi>Saxon Heptarchy</hi> reached from <hi>London</hi> to the
River of <hi>Marſey,</hi> which parts <hi>Cheſhire</hi> from
<hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> containing ſeventeen Counties, and Part of two more.
This Catalogue contains 22 Kings, beginning <hi>Anno</hi> 5<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>5 with <hi>Crida,</hi> deſcended from
<hi>Woden,</hi> and ending in 886, with Ceolwolph. Next we have an Account,
gather'd, as the former ſeems to have been, from <hi>Fox, Holinſhed,
Llhuyd, Camden,</hi> &amp;c. of <hi>the Dukes and Earls of March,</hi> before
the Conqueſt, who were alſo Palatines of <hi>Cheſter</hi>; for that it
was a County Palatine before the Conqueſt, appears in the
<hi>Supplication</hi> here exhibited to King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. by the
Inhabitants there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; and alſo that they were, among other Privileges,
ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the granting of Subſidies, appears by that King's
<hi>Anſwer</hi> thereunto. Then we have a Confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the
<hi>Liberties</hi> of the County Palatine by Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> 1568,
with the Opinions of the Judges, <hi>Dier, Weſton, Harper,</hi> and
<hi>Carns,</hi> concerning the Juriſdiction and Liberties of the ſaid
County. Here we enter upon a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Deſcription</hi> of the County;
its Length about 44 Miles; Breadth about 25, and Compaſs 112 Miles; Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
of Market-Towns 11; Pariſh Churches 87; Longi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 17 Deg. 30 Min. and
Latitude 53 Deg. 30 Min. with the reaſon, from its low Situation, of its
being named the Vale-Royal, by King <hi>Edward</hi> I. when he founded an Abbey
in the midſt of the Shire. So we proceed to the Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Air, the
Fertility and Products of the Soil, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which the <hi>Salt-Wells</hi> are
not forgot; laſtly of their Buildings, the Diſpoſition of their People,
and their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Houſe-keeping. Hence we paſs to the Waters and their
Courſes, beginning with the River <hi>Dee</hi>; ſo of the
<hi>Marſey,</hi> the <hi>Weaver,</hi> the <hi>Dane, Bollin, Peever,
Wheelock,</hi> 
                  <pb n="232" facs="tcp:0570200100:261"/> 
                  <hi>Taume,</hi> and the <hi>Goit</hi>;
with others mentioned by <hi>John Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and <hi>W. Harriſon.</hi>
Thus we come to the Particulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> that is, the
Diviſions or <hi>Hundreds,</hi> into which the County is diſtinguiſhed,
and they are ſeven. Of <hi>Weral,</hi> the firſt here mentioned, we have a
Deſcription from <hi>Leland,</hi> and of <hi>Helbrie</hi> Iſland: Then
follow the Names of all the <hi>Villages</hi> and <hi>Townſhips</hi> in this
Hundred. So we go on to <hi>Broxton,</hi> with a Liſt of all the Townſhips
therein; the like of <hi>Nantwich, Edsbury, Northwich, Bulk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley,</hi> and
<hi>Maxfield.</hi> Here we have a brief Account of the Antiquity of the City of
<hi>Cheſter,</hi> from <hi>Henry Bradſhaw</hi> and <hi>Ranulph Higden,</hi>
two Monks of that City, and from <hi>Holinſhed</hi> and <hi>Harriſon</hi>;
and then a Map giving a Proſpect of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> the Ground Plot, and
Arms of the Earls ſince the Conqueſt. Then we advance more particularly to
the Longitude and Latitude of the City, Deſcriptions of the Walls, the Gates,
the Bridge, the Caſtle, Cuſtom-Houſe, Shire-Hall, Exchequer, and the
Pariſh Churches in <hi>Cheſter.</hi> Next of the Mayor, Aldermen, Sheriffs,
Common-Hall, the <hi>Pendice,</hi> the <hi>Rows,</hi> the Mercer's <hi>Row</hi>
and Conduits. Then of the Biſhoprick of <hi>Cheſter.</hi> The Diviſion of
<hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cia</hi> into five Biſhopricks. The Names of the Biſhops of
<hi>Cheſter,</hi> ſince the Beginning of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.
Market-Towns in <hi>Cheſhire.</hi> The Manner of making Salt at
<hi>Nant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich,</hi> and at <hi>Northwich.</hi> After that ſhort Account of
the Market-Towns, and ſome others of principal Note, and a Reference to the
Map for the reſt, not named here, we have the Genealogy of the Earls of
<hi>Cheſter,</hi> ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; wherein is briefly ſhewed ſome
Part of their Deeds, beginning with <hi>Hugh Lupu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> and ending with <hi>Edward</hi> the <hi>Black
Prince,</hi> who was the eleventh Earl. After theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows a Note of the
chief Places of Gentlemen in <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> from <hi>John Leland</hi>;
and next, the Names of all the <hi>Knights, Eſquires, Gentlemen,</hi> and
<hi>Freeholders</hi> in the County <hi>Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine</hi> of <hi>Cheſter,</hi>
and in what Hundred they dwell, taking up about three Leaves and a half. Then
comes a Liſt of all the <hi>Mayors</hi> and <hi>Sheriffs</hi> of
<hi>Cheſter,</hi> beginning 1320, ending 1586, about fourteen Leaves. After
this, we have another Liſt of the <hi>Benefices,</hi> or Rectories, and
Vicaridges in the County, with their <hi>Valuations,</hi> from a MS. in the
Library of St. <hi>John</hi>'s College, <hi>Cambridge.</hi> Then comes the
De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of the Barons of <hi>Haulton,</hi> Conſtables of
<hi>Cheſter,</hi> and a Sculpture repreſenting <hi>Beeſton</hi> Caſtle,
with the Caſtle and Town of <hi>Haulton</hi>; alſo ſome <hi>Latin</hi>
Verſes upon <hi>Beeſton</hi> 
                  <pb n="233" facs="tcp:0570200100:262"/> Caſtle, built by
<hi>Ranulph,</hi> third Earl of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> from <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> with
Tranſlations of the laſt <hi>Diſtich,</hi> from <hi>Speed</hi> and
<hi>Camden</hi>; and a Note of the Battle on <hi>Blore</hi> Heath,
<hi>Anno</hi> 1459; which, with another Note touching the <hi>Arms</hi> of the
Gentry in this County, introducing eleven Pages of them, repreſented in
<hi>Sculpture, alphabetically,</hi> and a <hi>Table</hi> of the remarkable
Paſſages, in the foregoing Diſcourſe, finiſhes this Part of the
<hi>Vale-Royal,</hi> aſcribed to <hi>William Smith,</hi> by our Editor as
aforeſaid; which, beſides the Sculptures, takes up 99 Pages.</p>
               <p>The other Part, or Deſcription of this <hi>Vale-Royal,</hi> by
<hi>William Webb,</hi> M. A. and ſometimes Under-Sheriff to Sir <hi>Richard
Lee,</hi> begins with his Wiſhes, that the Labours of Mr. <hi>John
Norden</hi> had been continued to the finiſhing of that Hiſtorical and
Chronographical Deſcription of the reſt of the Shires of this famous
Iſle, which he had begun in that of <hi>Middleſex:</hi> alſo his
Commendations of our Worthy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, Mr. <hi>John Speed</hi>'s Labours of
the ſame nature. At the End of this Introduction, he gives us a ſummary
Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, for his more methodical Proceeding, of what Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he has choſen
to treat, and in what manner; ſo enters upon a Deſcription of the City and
County Palatine of <hi>Cheſter</hi>; and becauſe <hi>Broxton,</hi> in
ſome ſort, contains or borders upon, and almoſt encompaſſes the
ſaid City, he firſt makes a ſhort Survey of that <hi>Hundred,</hi> then
more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly deſcribes the City itſelf, recites its Names, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks
upon the ancient Foundations and Buildings thereof, more as a Topographer than
Antiquary, tho' not wholly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding hiſtorical Obſervation, where it will
illuſtrate his Account, as himſelf profeſſes. The Authors uſed in
this Deſcription, are <hi>Giraldus Cambrenſis, Peter Langtoft, Ranulph
Higden, Harding, Caxton, Fabian, Holinſhed, Stow, Camden,</hi> and a
manuſcript Life of St. <hi>Werburg,</hi> in <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſe, by
<hi>Henry Bradſhaw,</hi> Monk of <hi>Cheſter</hi>; out of whom he makes
ſeveral Quotations, and calls him their beſt Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quary. Then follows a
Diſcourſe of the Foundation and Endowment of the Abbey of St.
<hi>Werburg</hi> in <hi>Cheſter,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by <hi>N. N.</hi> with two
Sculptures repreſenting the Ground-Plot of her Church, and the Southern
Proſpect of it. This holy Virgin appears to have been the Daughter of
<hi>Wulpher,</hi> King of <hi>Mercia,</hi> who died <hi>A. Dom.</hi> 675. She
had the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over the Monaſteries of <hi>Weedon, Trentham, Repton,</hi>
and <hi>Hambury.</hi> In her tender Years was profeſſed under her Aunt
<hi>Andry</hi> at <hi>Ely,</hi> lived much at <hi>Weedon,</hi> deceas'd at 
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:0570200100:263"/> 
                  <hi>Trentham,</hi> and was buried at <hi>Hambury,</hi>
but twice tranſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, firſt from <hi>Trentham</hi> to <hi>Hambury</hi>
about the Year 708, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> about 875, as the 2 B.
and 2 Chap. of her <hi>Life</hi> aforeſaid teſtify. After which follow
ſeveral mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numental Inſcriptions in the Quire of the ſaid Abbey, and in
St. <hi>Nicholas</hi> Chapel, for <hi>William Downham,</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Cheſter,</hi> who died 1577; Dr. <hi>Geo. Lloyd,</hi> Biſhop of
<hi>Sodor,</hi> 1615; Dr. <hi>John Lloyd,</hi> a famous Civilian, 1607; Sir
<hi>Geo. Beverley</hi>; the famous Abbot <hi>Simon Ripley,</hi> who died about
1492; Sir <hi>W. Gerrard,</hi> 1581; and in St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s Chapel, Sir
<hi>Henry Troutbeck,</hi> round the Effigies of whoſe Body, in compleat
Armour, is neatly wrought a Wreath of Trouts. Here alſo was buried the late
famous Citizen <hi>Robert Brere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood,</hi> Alderman, and thrice Mayor of
<hi>Cheſter,</hi> who was, ſays our Author, 
<q rend="inline">"The happy Father of the learned <hi>Edw.
Brerewood,</hi> of <hi>Oxford</hi>; whoſe ſurpaſſing Progreſs in the
Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of all manner of Learning, the Univerſity does yet, and for ever
will ring loud of; and <hi>Greſham</hi> College in <hi>London,</hi> where he
was <hi>Mathematical</hi> Reader, will, to the World's end, bewail the want of;
being deprived of him by an untimely Death, before he had finiſhed, or taken
Order for Preſervation of ſuch learned Labours, as, if they were
publiſhed, wou'd make the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to <hi>Cheſter,</hi> the Nurſe
of ſuch a Father, which begat ſuch a Son."</q> Here are alſo recited
ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of ſeveral other Mayors, Aldermen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
of the ſaid City. Then, after ſome Obſervations upon the River
<hi>Dee,</hi> and the renewing of the Haven, our Author gives us the Remainder
of his Remarks upon <hi>Broxton</hi> Hundred, taking notice all the way he
travels along, by the Towns and Lordſhips, of the principal Seats, or
Mannor-Houſes, and by whom poſſeſſed or inhabited. This is alſo his
Courſe thro' the Hundred of <hi>Nantwich,</hi> where we have a Recital of the
Foundation-Charter of <hi>Cumbermere</hi> Abbey in <hi>Cheſter,</hi> founded
<hi>Anno</hi> 1133, by <hi>Hugh Malbanc,</hi> from the Annals of
<hi>Crockſdon,</hi> in the <hi>Cotton</hi> Library. In this Hundred, we have
ſome Remarks upon the Excellency of their Cheeſe, on their Salt-Pits or
<hi>Wiches,</hi> and a Sculpture of <hi>Crew</hi>-Hall. In the Hundred of
<hi>Northwich,</hi> our Author thinks the Ale of <hi>Sandach</hi> as worthy of
Praiſe, as Mr. <hi>Camden</hi> does that of <hi>Derby</hi>; and if that Ale
got its Name from the old <hi>Daniſh</hi> word <hi>Oel,</hi> as he ſays,
our Author knows not why this may not, almoſt with as little Variation, come
from <hi>Oil,</hi> being almoſt as ſubſtantial in handling. He alſo
remarks upon <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0570200100:264"/> the common Report of the Trees, which are
ſeen floating in <hi>Bagmere</hi> Pool above Water, juſt before any Heir of
the Houſe of <hi>Brereton</hi> the Owner thereof dies; but looks upon it as
meerly accidental. In <hi>Eadsbury</hi> Hundred, we have the Foundation-Charter
of the Abbey of <hi>Dernhall,</hi> in the County of <hi>Cheſter,</hi>
tranſlated afterwards to the <hi>Vale-Royal,</hi> given by <hi>Edward,</hi>
eldeſt Son of King <hi>Henry</hi> III. in the 54th Year of his Reign; alſo
the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi>'s Letters of Recommendation to all Abbots,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> for Books to be beſtowed on the ſaid
Abbey; alſo the Charter for Tranſlation of the ſaid Abbey to the
<hi>Vale-Royal.</hi> This Hundred he concludes with an Apology for paſſing
over ſome old Prophecies, ſome conceited Names of Trees, Moſs-Pits,
Pools, long Shoots of old Archers, a Horſe Race or two, and the latter
Newfound-Well, becauſe he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes his long Journey in this little
Hundred, has well nigh tired his Reader already. In <hi>Werall</hi> Hundred,
when he comes to <hi>Birket</hi> Wood, we have a Proſpect, in Sculpture, of
the Ruins of <hi>Berkenhead</hi> Abbey. A Reference to the
<hi>Monaſticon,</hi> fol. 404; with the Charter of <hi>Hamon
Maſſie</hi>'s Donation of the Church of <hi>Bowdon,</hi> and another
Charter of Power to the Monks of <hi>Berkenhead.</hi> Thus he paſſes on, as
through the reſt of the <hi>Hundreds,</hi> giving Deſcriptions of the chief
<hi>Seats</hi> all the way, and Characters of the <hi>Gentry</hi> who
poſſeſſed them, till he arrives again at the famous City of
<hi>Cheſter</hi>; and here takes the Government with its Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours under
Conſideration, ſo begins with a Narrative of the <hi>Earls</hi> of
<hi>Cheſter</hi>; and firſt of thoſe four or five be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Conqueſt,
who were named <hi>Edolf,</hi> from the Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of <hi>Ranulph
Ceſtrenſis</hi> and <hi>Fabian.</hi> 2. <hi>Curſon,</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to
<hi>John Harding.</hi> 3. The famous <hi>Leofric,</hi> whoſe Power, Grandeur,
and charitable Works are celebrated by many Hiſtorians; but the Story of his
Wife <hi>Godwina,</hi> or <hi>Godiva,</hi> riding through the City of
<hi>Coventry</hi> naked, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Franchiſement of the City, is
ſuſpected by our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. 4. His Son <hi>Algarus.</hi> But theſe two (and
much leſs <hi>Jonas,</hi> mentioned in the Chronicle of <hi>St. Albans,</hi>
or <hi>Otho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel</hi>) are, tho' allowed to have been Earls of <hi>March,</hi>
by Sir <hi>John Fern,</hi> in his <hi>Second Part of Lacie's Nobility,</hi> not
rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned to have been Earls of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> but he thinks they are ſo
miſtaken to have been, by their Reſidence or Abode in that City, or
thereabouts. Here we enter upon the Hiſtory of the Earls of
<hi>Cheſter</hi> from the Conqueſt, of whom there is more certain Record;
beginning with <hi>Hugh Lupus,</hi> who was <pb n="236" facs="tcp:0570200100:265"/> the Son of
<hi>William</hi> the Conqueror's Siſter, and we have a Sculpture
repreſenting the ſaid Earl in Parliament with the Barons and Abbots of the
County Palatine; which <hi>Hugh</hi> having governed the Earldom 40 Years, died
about 1107. In the like manner, we have a Chapter a-piece upon the ſix
enſuing Earls, ending with <hi>John Scot,</hi> who died in 1237, without
Iſſue. King <hi>Henry</hi> III. took the Earldom of Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into his
hands, and it was thenceforward held by Princes of the Blood Royal; of whom,
after a little Account of the Barons under the ancient Earls, we have alſo a
Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue down to Prince <hi>Charles.</hi> This is followed with a
Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> State and Government in this
County; the Succeſſions of the <hi>Biſhops,</hi> and, with more
certainty, from the 33d of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. ending with Dr. <hi>John
Bridgman.</hi> The next Chapter treats of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the County and
City, by the Officers, or Princes, who ruled here after the Earls, down to King
<hi>James</hi> I. Then we have a Table of the Mayors and Sheriffs of
<hi>Cheſter,</hi> from 1242 to 1655, interſperſed with little
hiſtorical Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs of ſome noted Occurrences, happening under ſeveral
Years within that Time and Place. After this, we have the Names of the
Juſtices of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> with another Liſt of the Sheriffs of the
County: and the whole cloſes with a Copy from <hi>Domeſday</hi> Book,
<hi>ſub Titulo, Ceſterſheire</hi>; ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in whoſe
Poſſeſſion the Lands of this County were at the Conqueſt. So ends
this ſecond and more copious Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative of the ſaid County Palatine,
containing 239 Pages; and has an <hi>Index,</hi> like the former, at the End of
it.</p>
               <p>But here follows another Tract, not before ſpoken of in either
of the Title-Pages before the Book, or in the Editor's Preface, not being
communicated perhaps till they were printed; and it is called <hi>Chronicon
Ceſtrenſe,</hi> written by <hi>Samuel Lee,</hi> as appears at the End of
his Epiſtle to the ſaid Editor his ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>D. King,</hi>
dated <hi>May</hi> 8, 1656. In this Epiſtle, perceiving the exact Times of
the former Rulers of that Province, not ſo much attended as might
illuſtrate that <hi>Vale-Royal,</hi> he deſired to communicate to Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
what he has obſerved in his Reading, which might conduce to the fixing of the
Times and Seaſons, wherein the noble Atchivements of its Rulers and
Inhabitants have been performed. And indeed he has ſhew'd himſelf more
critically acquainted with all our ancient Hiſtorians, as to Time and Place,
the two Eyes of Hiſtory, than both the foregoing Authors put together. His
Work begins with a <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0570200100:266"/> Chapter upon the Romans in
<hi>Cheſhire,</hi> in which we have the various Opinions of ſeveral Authors
concerning its Longitude and Latitude; but he prefers <hi>Shakerley</hi> in his
<hi>Britiſh Tables,</hi> before all the reſt. Then we have, in Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter 2,
the Kings, Dukes, and Earls of <hi>Mercia,</hi> with the particular Earls of
<hi>Cheſter</hi> from the Conqueſt, and thoſe of the Royal Blood,
diſpoſed in their exact Times, in five ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Sections. The third
Chapter treats of the Biſhops of <hi>Mercia,</hi> who had their Seats
ſometimes at <hi>Coventry,</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times at <hi>Cheſter,</hi> moſt
commonly at <hi>Litchfield,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are uſually ſo ſtiled;
but had <hi>Cheſhire</hi> under their Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copal Government. Alſo of the
Biſhops of <hi>Cheſter</hi> ſince the Conqueſt; and of the peculiar
Biſhops of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> from the Time of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. in
four Sections. The fourth and laſt Chapter diſcourſes of the
Parliamentary Barons of the Earls of <hi>Cheſter:</hi> And firſt of the
Barons Temporal, in which we have the Stem of the Barons of <hi>Haulton</hi>;
laſtly, of the Barons Spiritual, being an Account of the Earls, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,
and Abbots. But before we leave this Work where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Author has proved
himſelf ſo expert in calculating and fixing of ancient Times, as to make us
wiſh that <hi>Saxon</hi> Hiſtory he promiſes in two or three Places, had
ſeen the light; we ſhall only remark out of his ſecond Chapter, upon the
<hi>Mercian</hi> Monarchy, how he accounts for many Defects in our old
hiſtorical Computations; where he ſays, 
<q rend="inline">"Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering that all our Monkiſh Writers
more skillful in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bering of Beads than Years, did <hi>uno tramite</hi>
follow the <hi>Dionyſian</hi> Account, a thing diligently to be attended in
the reading of our <hi>monaſtical</hi> Writers, I hope to extricate myſelf
out of theſe Difficulties, by treating a little of it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I begin with
the Reigns of the Kings of <hi>Mercia.</hi>"</q> Then having given an Example
to ſhew wherein that Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is deficient, and Direction to ſeveral
Authorities for Confirmation thereof, he further 
<q rend="inline">"refers this to be proved more at large in its
proper Place, when he treats about the <hi>Saxons</hi> Arrival into our Land,
demonſtrating their Entrance to have been in the Vulgar Year of Chriſt 428,
and not in 449 or 450, as our old Authors uſually fix'd it; whereby great and
knotty Difficulties have tied up the Hiſtory of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Dominion
in this Iſland."</q> Thus much of this Chronological Treatiſe, containing
55 Pages. We come now, laſtly, to</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>A ſhort Treatiſe of the Iſle of Man,</hi> &amp;c.
illuſtrated with ſeveral Proſpects of the Iſland by <hi>D. King,</hi>
1556. 'Tis <pb n="238" facs="tcp:0570200100:267"/> dedicated to <hi>Thomas</hi> Lord
<hi>Fairfax,</hi> Lord of <hi>Man,</hi> and of the Iſles, by the Author
<hi>James Chaloner,</hi> one of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners for ſettling Affairs
in that Iſland, who dates his ſaid Epiſtle from <hi>Middle-Park,
Dec.</hi> 1, 1653; wherein it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, he was the rather induced to preſent
the ſame to his Lordſhip, becauſe of his Reſpect to Antiquities, ſo
ſignally manifeſted in patronizing our notable <hi>Engliſh</hi> Antiquary
Mr. <hi>Roger Dodſworth,</hi> in his Collections, compoſing and
pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of that ſingular Piece his <hi>Monaſticon,</hi> &amp;c. The
Work is divided into ſix Chapters, which, after a Map of the Iſland
environ'd with little Proſpects of ſome notable Parts or Places in it,
begins, 1. with the Situation of the <hi>Iſle of Man.</hi> 2. Concerning the
Inhabitants, whence derived, their Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage the <hi>Manks</hi> Tongue, and of
the Tranſlation of the Bible therein, and of the Conditions of the People. 3.
Of the State Eccleſiaſtical; of the Biſhops, Monaſteries, and
Free-Schools, with three Proſpects in Sculpture, of <hi>Baliſaly</hi>
Abbey, the Nunnery; and the Biſhop's Court. 4. Of the Civil Government, and
the ſupreme Governors, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly King <hi>Edward</hi> II. his Grant of
the Iſland to <hi>Henry</hi> Lord <hi>Beaumont</hi>; and here we have a
Sculpture of the Arms of the <hi>Beaumonts.</hi> Then the Author deſcends to
the inferior Officers, and the Judicatories of the ſaid Iſle. The fifth
Chapter is concerning the Trade of the Iſle. And the laſt Chapter is of the
Strength of the Iſland, where we have three Proſpects in Sculpture, of the
Caſtle <hi>Ruſhen, Peel</hi> Caſtle, and <hi>Douglas</hi> Fort; upon
which Fortifications and others, that might be wanting, our Author concludes,
That the <hi>Poverty</hi> of the Iſland is its greateſt <hi>Security.</hi>
The whole is no more than 32 Pages, followed with a Leaf of <hi>Addenda,
Errata,</hi> and a Table of the true Longitude and Latitude of certain Cities
in <hi>England,</hi> which ends the whole Book.</p>

<hi>Engliſh</hi>) and a <hi>Collection</hi> of LETTERS to Dr. JAMES, &amp;c.

               <p>THESE <hi>Remains</hi> of that famous <hi>Founder</hi> of the
<hi>Public Library</hi> at <hi>Oxford,</hi> are pretty well known to have been
publiſhed, tho' their Editors Name appears not to them, by the late Mr.
<hi>Hearne.</hi> In his <hi>Preface,</hi> after having touch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the
Antiquity of <hi>Letters</hi> and <hi>Libraries,</hi> and ſhewn how ancient
they were in <hi>Egypt</hi>; what a magnificent Collection was made there by
<hi>Ptolemy,</hi> and what Ambition the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi> had
of this kind; he deſcends to obſerve how early Learning flouriſh'd in
<hi>Britain</hi>; and that in King <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred</hi>'s Time, there were divers
Libraries for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Learning; but is more particular of
<hi>Richard de Bury,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Durham,</hi> his noble Gift of Books
to this Univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity in 1295, as may be further gather'd from his own Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count
in his <hi>Philobiblos, ſive de Amore Librorum,</hi> firſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted at
<hi>Paris,</hi> afterwards at <hi>Oxford,</hi> 4to, 1599, and ſince in 8vo.
Alſo of <hi>Thomas Cobham,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter</hi>'s Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
for a Library in the ſaid Univerſity in 1320. That after this, another
Library was built there by Duke <hi>Humphrey,</hi> and famous in 1439, which
falling to Ruin towards the end of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Reign, Sir
<hi>Thomas Bodley,</hi> a ſecond <hi>Ptolemy,</hi> began to reſtore it in
1597, finiſh'd it in two Years, and in a few more ſo nobly endow'd it with
Books, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues, and other Buildings, that it is accounted one of the
<hi>moſt famous Libraries in the World</hi>; excelling, according to the
Accounts of Travellers, the <hi>Vatican</hi> at <hi>Rome</hi>; that being ſo
full of Corruptions and Forgeries. The <hi>Hiſtory</hi> of the <hi>Bodleian
Library</hi> is given us by the <hi>Oxford</hi> Antiquary (<hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony
Wood</hi>) at large: But the <hi>Catalogue</hi> of the Printed Books, by Dr.
<hi>Hyde</hi>: We have had one ſince alſo of the MSS; but both being
imperfect, we are here told, an <hi>Appendix</hi> 
                  <pb n="240" facs="tcp:0570200100:269"/> to the
former, as big as the Doctors Catalogue, was now ready for the Preſs; and
that an <hi>Appendix</hi> alſo to the latter, was in ſome time to be
publiſh'd; yet are we ſtill in expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of them. The Editor likewiſe
ſays, 'Twas for the ſake of this noble Library, that lately, in his
ſearches there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, finding the <hi>Life</hi> of Sir <hi>Thomas Bodley</hi>;
the firſt Draught of its <hi>Statutes,</hi> and a Collection of his Letters
to Dr. <hi>James,</hi> the firſt <hi>Keeper</hi> of it, all written by Sir
<hi>Thomas</hi> his own Hand, he took a Tranſcript of them, and ſent them
to the Preſs; that others, imitating Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his Zeal and
In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry for the good of Learning, might become Benefactors themſelves to
ſuch a noble Repoſitory; which they cou'd not do at a better time, ſince
the <hi>Act</hi> of <hi>Parliament</hi> for ſending certain Copies thither,
of Books printed at <hi>London,</hi> was expired. The <hi>Life,</hi> he ſays,
has been printed ſome Years before, and two Letters to Sir <hi>Francis
Bacon,</hi> lately, at the end of Archbiſhop <hi>Uſher</hi>'s Letters; but
the Copies of the former, being diſperſed, and the latter, containing
Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Moment, it was thought fit to reprint them.</p>
               <p>In the LIFE <hi>of Sir</hi> THO. BODLEY <hi>written by
himſelf,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of 15 Pages, he tells us he was born at
<hi>Exeter</hi> in <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vonſhire,</hi> the 2d of March 1544, of
Worſhipful Parents. That his Father, a known Enemy to Popery, fled in Queen
<hi>Mary</hi>'s Reign into <hi>Germany,</hi> ſent for his Family and
ſettling at <hi>Geneva,</hi> when our Author was twelve Years of Age, had him
inſtructed in <hi>Hebrew</hi> and <hi>Greek,</hi> by <hi>Chevalerius</hi> and
<hi>Beroaldus</hi>; and in Divinity by <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Beza,</hi>
beſides Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic Teachers. In the beginning of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s
Reign, they return'd to <hi>London,</hi> and he was ſent to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete his
Studies at <hi>Oxford,</hi> where he took his Batchelor of Arts Degree, and was
choſe Probationer of <hi>Merton</hi> College in 1563, and the Year after
admitted Fellow. In 1565 read the <hi>Greek Lecture.</hi> Proceeded Maſter of
Arts 1566, and read for that Year, <hi>Natural Philoſophy</hi>; was elected
one of the Proctors in 1569. Supply'd for a long time, the Place of
<hi>Univerſity Orator.</hi> Travell'd into <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and
<hi>Germany,</hi> to acquire the Modern Tongues in 1576. In 1585, was ſent by
the Queen to ſeveral <hi>German</hi> Princes, to procure their Aid for the
King of <hi>Navarre.</hi> Alſo to <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> III. of <hi>France,</hi>
both for this King's Advantage and that of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Cauſe.
In 1588 was ſent to the <hi>Hague,</hi> and there admitted one of their
Council of State, and acquitted himſelf in his Charge, ſo much to the
Queen's Satisfaction, that thenceforward he rarely received any
<hi>Inſtructions</hi> in <pb n="241" facs="tcp:0570200100:270"/> theſe Proceedings of State.
After his return from near five Years Foreign Employment, he was ſent to the
<hi>Hague</hi> again but return'd in leſs than a Year: Yet was no ſooner
come home, but the Queen pleas'd with his Diſcoveries, ſent him again to
the <hi>States,</hi> with Charge to purſue, what he had ſecretly propos'd;
whereby all was brought to the Iſſue deſir'd. In all which Employments,
he had no one more to his Friend among the Lords of the Council, than the
Treaſurer <hi>Burghly,</hi> who was of Opinion there was no Man ſo ſit
for the Office of Secretary of State, and whoſe Intention was, when he
advanced his own Son thereto, to make Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> his Collegue. But
before he return'd from the <hi>United Provinces</hi> in 1597, the Earl of
<hi>Eſſex</hi> in Oppoſition to the <hi>Cecils,</hi> had ſo prodigally
recommended his Sufficiency to the Queen for the Poſt aforeſaid, that ſhe
(who hated the Earl's Ambition) was not the readier to prefer him, tho' they
were to be jealous of him. Thus finding his Preferment on this Quarter
obſtructed, and conſidering what a ſlender hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt the Earl had with
the Queen; withal his declining Years, and the eaſy Circumſtances of his
own Fortune, he reſolv'd to retire; and tho' he had afterwards, both in the
Queen's Reign, and King <hi>James</hi>'s, many honourable Invitations, as well
to Foreign as Domeſtic Employments, he concluded at laſt <hi>to ſet up
his Staff at the Library Door in Oxon,</hi> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate that ruin'd Place
for the Public Uſe of Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents; finding himſelf competently furniſh'd
with the fourfold Aid neceſſary thereto, which was a Knowledge in the
Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and Modern <hi>Tongues,</hi> as well as ſundry kinds of
Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtic Literature; a <hi>Purſe-Ability</hi>; Store of Honourable
<hi>Friends,</hi> and <hi>Leiſure</hi> to follow the Work: But how well he
has ſped; he thinks that which is already perform'd in ſight, that which
beſides he has given for the Maintenance of it, and which he afterwards
purpoſes to add, will ſo abundantly teſtify, that he needs not be the
Publiſher of the Worth of his own Inſtitution. Written, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
1609. Signed <hi>T. B.</hi> Then follows:</p>
               <p>Sir THOMAS BODLEY's <hi>firſt Draught of the</hi> STATUTES
<hi>of the</hi> PUBLICK LIBRARY <hi>at</hi> OXON, <hi>tranſcribed</hi> from
the <hi>Original</hi> Copy, written by his own <hi>Hand</hi> and repoſited in
the <hi>Archives</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Library.</hi> Herein, upon the
Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration that no Inſtitution can have the good Effects in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended,
unleſs there be Statutes to encounter and reſtrain the Diſorders of
ill-affected Perſons, it is ordain'd, by the Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, Vice-Chancellor,
Doctors, Proctors, Maſters, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, <pb n="242" facs="tcp:0570200100:271"/> 
                  <hi>&amp;c</hi>
of the great Convocation of the Univerſity upon their frequent Conſultation
with Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> That ſome one be deputed to the keeping of this
Library, who is a diligent Student, Truſty, Active and Diſcreet; a
Graduate, a Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſt, unmarried and unbeneficed. That the manner of
e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting ſuch a <hi>Keeper,</hi> ſhou'd be like that yearly practis'd in
the choice of their Proctors; and firſt the Electors to be tender'd one Oath,
then the Elected another, which are here ſpecified. That the ſaid Keeper is
not to be diſplaced but by his own Aſſent, unleſs for ſome heinous
Offence or apparent Inſufficiency. That his Buſineſs ſhall be to keep
and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue the great Regiſter-Book, chain'd to the Desk at the upper
Window of the Library, in which are to be inroll'd the Names of Benefactors
thereto, whether mean Perſons or great: Which Book to be fairly written, and
laid to open ſight, as a Token of thankful Acceptation and Inducement of
Imitation to Poſterity. He is further alſo to range all his Books according
to their Faculties, to aſſign to every Family its Catalogues and Tables,
diſpoſe of the Authors therein named Alphabetically, and beſides their
Names and Title of their Works, expreſs in what ſized Volume printed, the
Place where, and the Year when. Upon Gifts of Books to the Library, what Order
to be taken, that they be put up in good plight, and the Charge to be
ſupply'd by the Vice-Chancellor, (Receiver of the Library Rents) and upon
Gifts in Money; how it is to be diſpoſed of to the Donors ſatisfaction.
That for the Accommodation of Students, the Keeper is not to be exempted one
whole Day in the Year upon Penalty of 20 Shillings, except <hi>Sunday,
Chriſtmas-day,</hi> and ſome others here named: But to come conſtantly to
the opening of the Library Doors, and give acceſs to others from Eight to
Eleven in the Morning, and Two till Five in Afternoon, from <hi>Eaſter</hi>
to <hi>Michaelmas</hi>; but the reſt of the Year, from One to Four in the
Afternoon; a Warning-Bell to be rung at his Ingreſs and Egreſs. None to
enter by Night, with Candle, Lamp, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Next, of the care to be
taken by Students in reading the Books, faſtning the Claſps and Strings,
untangling the Chains, and leaving the Volumes in the Places they found them.
And for the ſmaller Volumes within the Grates, and under the Cuſtody of the
Keeper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, he is to deliver them out by Hand and Tale, and with Condition,
that they be peruſed in ſight, and preſently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtor'd to him or his
Aſſiſtant, who is to look out and deliver Books ſo ask'd for, and but
ſix at a time of one ſort or <pb n="243" facs="tcp:0570200100:272"/> other, unleſs he be
won to gratify ſome Perſons to exceed that Number. No Books to be lent out
of the Library upon any Security whatever; and in Caſe of Books to be ſold
as unprofitable, or chang'd for better Editions, or carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out to be new
bound, the Keeper to conſult the Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers to be appointed. The Keeper's
Abſence to be diſpenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with in caſe of Buſineſs, ſeven Days
every Quarter; but his Office to be ſupply'd by ſome able Graduate, who is
of known Fidelity, or ſhall take the Oath. And if the Caſe is ſuch, that
longer Abſence is allow'd by common Suffrage in Convocation, to be accorded
with. For this continual At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendance and Engagement, the Keeper tho' he has
greater Advantages to advance his Knowledge and Credit than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Students, is
to have, beſides the Annual Stipend of 20 <hi>Nobles,</hi> which was the
Donation of King <hi>Henry</hi> IV. iſſuable from the Univerſity
Treaſure, 33 Pounds, 6 Shillings and 8 Pence, and to be paid half-yearly out
of the Library Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and his Aſſiſtant Ten Pounds; and Four Pounds
more to a poor Scholar or Servant, for ſweeping, wiping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The
choice of theſe to be at the Keeper's Diſcretion, their Payment at the
Vice-Chancellor's care, and diſplacing of them in the power of the
Overſeers. That for the ſafer Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtody of the Revenue aforeſaid, it
ſhou'd be lock'd up where the Univerſity Rents are kept, in an Iron
Cheſt, under three different Locks, with double Keys, to remain with the
Vice-Chancellor and two Proctors; which laſt two are to be Witneſſes of
the Sums brought in or taken out and regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd by the third. The Perſons
to be admitted as <hi>Students</hi> are next diſtinguiſh'd; beſides all
Graduates, Benefactors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Strangers, or ſuch as have no
Univerſity Education, or been Contributors, may for the furtherance of their
Study obtain the Freedom of Recourſe; the ſame being craved as a Grace in
the Convocation Houſe, and the Oath of Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Library, here
exhibited, firſt by them, as by all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons, before the conſtant
Liberty of Entrance, ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and a Penalty impos'd upon thoſe who intrude
with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Permiſſion before they are ſworn; unleſs accompanied with one
who is ſworn; as alſo upon any who ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed of diſmembering,
purloining, or corrupting the Senſe of any Books. Leſt the Keeper ſhou'd
be tardy in his Duty, eight principal Graduates are appointed perpetual
Overſeers and Viſitors of the Library, every 8th Day of <hi>November,</hi>
(the Day of firſt opening or free Acceſs,) who are not only to examine how
well the Keeper has perfom'd his Charge, but <pb n="244" facs="tcp:0570200100:273"/> direct him
in doubtful Matters, and reform him in erroneous ones; alſo to appoint the
Exchange, or diſpoſal of ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and Purchaſe of new Books; and
to have forty Shillings for a Dinner or Supper that Day, alſo Gloves of Ten
Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings a Pair, to the five Profeſſors of the King's Lectures, and the
two Proctors, which two are alſo to have forty Shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings each, for the
Cuſtody of the Keys; one Pair of Gloves at five Shillings to the Beadle then
attending; one Pair of 20 Shillings to the Vice-Chancellor, with 20 Nobles in
regard of his Trouble, he only being to deal with the Employment of the Annual
Rents of the Library: Yet at the end of the Year to let the Viſitors and
Keeper ſee the Money remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Iron Cheſt, with the Account of
Receipts and Disburſements, which they are to audit, ſo deliver up his Keys
and Accounts to the New Vice-Chancellor, relating the State thereof, at the
next Convocation; who are to take notice of the laſt Vice-Chancellor's
Diſcharge of his Truſt, according to his Merit; and in all former Acts and
Decrees, expound, alter, abrogate, or innovate, and provide in all Events for
the Indemnity of the Library, as for a Treaſure, to Students, of incomparable
Worth. So we come to</p>
               <p>The LETTERS; which are 234 in Number; and moſtly written by Sir
<hi>Thomas Bodley</hi> himſelf, from <hi>London, Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> and
<hi>Burnham,</hi> to Dr. <hi>Thomas James,</hi> the firſt Keeper of his
Library. Few of them have the Date of the Year when written, but the earlieſt
Date we meet with, is in 1602; to Dr.<hi>Rives,</hi> Vice-Chancellor of
<hi>Oxon,</hi> about open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Library and conſtituting the Statutes
thereof, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, perhaps, ſhou'd have ſtood the firſt in this
Collection; and the lateſt is dated in 1611. Though one, towards the end,
without any Date, was written much ſooner than the former, being to his
Couſin <hi>Francis Bacon</hi> when he was a Youth in <hi>France,</hi>
containing Advice to him in his <hi>Travels</hi>; and the laſt Letter in the
Book is written to Dr. <hi>James,</hi> by <hi>Laurence Bodley</hi> after the
Death of his Brother Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> (which was in 1612.) Except another
Letter from Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Bodley</hi> to the ſaid Sir <hi>Francis
Bacon,</hi> which is alſo ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what Foreign to theſe Collections, as
containing both a Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and Commendation of ſome Maxims of Modern
Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy in his <hi>Novum Organum</hi>; that which the Reader is to look
for in theſe Letters, might be ſorted and compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended under theſe five
Topics. The <hi>Founder</hi>; the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factors</hi>; the <hi>Books</hi>;
the <hi>Library,</hi> and the <hi>Librarian:</hi> But we, for the Reader's
Facility of finding the Particulars here <pb n="245" facs="tcp:0570200100:274"/> extracted,
ſhall give a tranſient View of the moſt obſervable among them, in the
ſame Order as they occur; which, tho' in the Collection itſelf, ſhort,
diſſever'd, often repeated, and unconcluded in many Points, as the Nature
is of Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional Letters, in ſuch familiar Intercourſe; yet may yield
many Hiſtorical Hints, relating to the Encouragers of this Foundation, or the
manner of collecting and preſerving the Writings of Learned and Ingenious
Men.</p>
               <p>Such therefore are the <hi>Founder's</hi> Expoſtulations with
his <hi>Librarian,</hi> upon his ſudden thoughts of a married Life; the
ſame being utterly deny'd; alſo concerning the Advantages he had of

ſhewn the Office of <pb n="251" facs="tcp:0570200100:280"/> a <hi>Judge</hi> over the People

               </p>
               <p>He then opens his <hi>Preface,</hi> to Sir <hi>John Holland,</hi>
Bart. with the Grand Diviſion of <hi>Law,</hi> into <hi>Divine</hi> and
<hi>Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi>; and ſhews that the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi> comes
neareſt to the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the <hi>Divine</hi>
Pattern. Next he treats of its <hi>Certainty</hi>; proving that <hi>legal
Beings</hi> in general, are capable of the beſt <hi>Certainty,</hi> even
Demonſtration, and Mr. <hi>Lock</hi>'s Notions of <hi>Morality</hi>
applicable to them; and after ſhews the ſpecial Care of the Law of
<hi>England,</hi> in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Terms, raiſing Axioms, drawing Deductions
there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, ſearching the Truth of Facts by Juries of 12 Men, and giving
Judgment upon mature Conſideration: Then of its Antiquity; and here he cites
our Author <hi>de Laud. Leg. Angl.</hi> that neither the <hi>Roman</hi> nor
<hi>Venetian</hi> Laws can claim ſo great Antiquity; and lays down, that all
Laws have their <hi>Origin</hi> from <hi>Nature,</hi> and thoſe that are
founded on her are equally ancient; that the Law of <hi>England</hi>
conſiſts of the Laws of <hi>Nature,</hi> poſitive
<hi>Inſtitutions,</hi> and <hi>Cuſtoms.</hi> That <hi>Ethelbert</hi> the
firſt <hi>Chriſtian King,</hi> in 561, with the Advice of his
<hi>Wiſe-Men,</hi> made the firſt <hi>Saxon</hi> Laws, after the coming of
<hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk; and many <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings after him in like
manner, made and confirmed Laws; that <hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fred,</hi> firſt ſole Monarch
after the <hi>Heptarchy,</hi> with the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of his <hi>Wiſe-Men,</hi>
collected the Laws of former <hi>Saxon</hi> Kings into one entire
<hi>Codex</hi> (ſuppos'd to be the ſame with the <hi>Dome-Book</hi>) <hi>ut
in Jus Commune totius Gentis tranſiret</hi>; that his Succeſſors
<hi>Edward</hi> the Elder, <hi>Aethelſtan, Edgar, Ethelred,</hi> and
<hi>Canutus</hi> confirmed theſe Laws, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded their Judges to give
right Judgment according to the <hi>Dome-Book,</hi> and that the
<hi>Folc-Right</hi> ſhould be preſerv'd to all their Subjects: And from
hence the Editor concludes, that the <hi>Common Law</hi> of <hi>England</hi>
under the Name of <hi>Folc-Right,</hi> exiſted under <hi>Alfred</hi>; and
that <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor only collected, as <hi>Alfred</hi> had
done, the Laws then extant, which had not been obſerved during the
Uſurpations of <pb n="252" facs="tcp:0570200100:281"/> 
                  <hi>Harold</hi> I. and
<hi>Hardicanute,</hi> and may well be called the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorer of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Laws; and this he backs with the Oath of <hi>William</hi> I.
to keep inviolable the Laws of the pious Kings of <hi>England,</hi> and
eſpecially King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> which, ſays he, were not only thoſe
enacted in his time, but of all his Anceſtors, and the with Confirmation of
King <hi>Edward</hi>'s Laws by <hi>Henry</hi> I. <hi>Stephen, Henry</hi> II.
<hi>Richard</hi> I. <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Henry</hi> III. and <hi>Magna
Charta,</hi> which as Lord <hi>Coke</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, is only a Confirmation of
the <hi>Common Law</hi> of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> He then ſpeaks of the
<hi>Salic</hi> Laws among the <hi>German Franks,</hi> and briefly of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſtitution. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards he paſſes to the Author's
Life and Character, his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digree and Works. Then follows, the Reaſon of his
Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the Author's Language; and here he obſerves, that 
<q rend="inline">"tho' an <hi>Etymology,</hi> ſtrictly

<hi>Etymologies</hi> from a <hi>Saxon</hi> Original, will often preſent you

               <p>THUS, the better to underſtand the Contents of this Work, is its
Title here enlarged; which otherwiſe is no more than barely
<hi>Exchequer</hi>; as if it were a Part of ſome larger Performance, which
had a more comprehenſive and explanatory Title at the beginning. And this we
are the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther inclin'd to believe was the Caſe, in that we have been
inform'd, the late Lord Chief Baron <hi>Gilbert</hi> wrote Two Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes
upon the Courts of the <hi>King's-Bench</hi> and the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> and
a Third upon the <hi>Exchequer</hi>; of which laſt, this, before us, is
preſumed to be a Copy. It was certainly wrote by an Author who was familiarly
acquainted with the Laws of this Court, or Courſe of Practice therein, both
Ancient and Modern; and that it was written ſince Mr. <hi>Maddox</hi>
pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh'd the <hi>Hiſtory of the Exchequer,</hi> appears by our Author's
frequent Quotations from it; beſides, there is the Form of a Writ of
<hi>Scire Facias</hi> iſſued under the <hi>Teſte</hi> of the ſaid Chief
Baron <hi>Gilbert,</hi> in the fourth Year of his late Majeſty's Reign,
recited in the 56th Page of the ſaid MS; which was imparted to us out of the
Collections mention'd in our Account of the MS, we deſcribed in our last
Number.</p>
               <p>It is divided into Ten Chapters, which for want of room we ſhall
only repeat, as follows: 1. Shewing that the <hi>Exchequer</hi> was the ancient
and ſovereign Court in <hi>Normandy.</hi> 2. How to underſtand the Revenue
and Buſineſs of the ancient <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chequer.</hi> 3. How, when
<hi>Baronies,</hi> towards the latter end of the Norman Period eſcheated,
they were wont to be broken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſmall Tenures. 4. That, in the
<hi>Saxon</hi> Times, the Lords Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual held by <hi>Frank Almoigne.</hi> 5.
How the King's Tenants, who held <hi>per Baroniam,</hi> did Suit and Service at
his own Court. 6. How all Debts to the King bind from the Time they are
contracted. 7. What Acts and Inſtruments paſs by the King's Chancellor
under the Broad-Seal. 8. The uſual Revenue which aroſe from Fines and
Amerciaments. 9. The Receipt of the <hi>Exchequer.</hi> 10. The Sheriffs

Prefaces and Concluſions of its ſeveral Parts, that the Reader cannot have
a better Account thereof than by a Recital of them: We ſhall therefore begin

                  <p>"Here begynneth the Prohemye upon the reducynge, both out of

of the Polytyque Book, named <hi>Tullius de Senectute</hi>; which that
<hi>Tullius</hi> wrote upon the Diſputations and Commynyca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions made to the
puiſſant Duc <hi>Cato,</hi> Senatour of <hi>Rome,</hi> by <hi>Scipion</hi>

olde Age; and how <hi>Caton</hi> exhorteth and counſeileth olde Men to be
joyful and bere pacyently olde Age, whan it cometh to them: And how
<hi>Tullius,</hi> at reverence of <hi>Caton,</hi> declareth, by ways of

Mates, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily requyſite unto Men stepte in Age, and to yong Men,
for to lerne how they ought to come to the ſame, to whiche every Man

and <hi>Scipio</hi> and <hi>Lelius,</hi> two yonge Knyghtes, on that other
part, is moch behoefful to be knowen to every Man, vertuous, and wel
diſpoſed, of what ſome ever Eage reſonable that he be. Thenne by
cauſe I have not ſeen ony of the ſame here to fore, I have endevoured me
to gete it with grete diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culte, and ſo gotten, have put it in Enprynte,
and dilygent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, after my lytil Underſtandyng, corrected it, to thentente
that noble vertuous and wel diſpoſed Men myght have it to loke on, and to

Eage; wherin they may ſee how to ſuffre, and bere the ſame pacyently; and

and glad, that they have eſcaped and paſſed, the manyfolde Peryllys and
doubte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Adventures, that ben in Juvente and Yongthe, as in this ſaid Booke
here followyng, ye may more plainly ſee. Whiche Booke endyted and wrote in

is to ſay, of Frendſhip. In which he reherceth of two yong Knyghtes of
<hi>Rome,</hi> that one named <hi>Sevola,</hi> and that other <hi>Faunyus,</hi>
both Sones-in-law unto <hi>Lelius,</hi> a noble Senatour of <hi>Rome,</hi> and

playnly it appiereth in the ſame; which Book was tranſlated by the vertuous

Tongue. And by cauſe it is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordyng and requyſite to have Frendſhip
joyned to olde Eage, I have enprynted the ſaid Book of Frendſhip, and
annexed to it the Book of Eage; which Book of Frendſhip is full

his Lif, his Science, and his Vertue; me thynketh God not diſplesyd ouer

               <p>THIS Sir <hi>Thomas Elyot,</hi> for his Learning, and vertuous
Accompliſhments, was an Honour to the Gentry and Nobility of
<hi>England,</hi> in his Time; and tho' his younger Years were much employed in
Court and State Affairs, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially certain Embaſſies into <hi>Italy,
&amp;c.</hi> yet did he apply the Knowledge thereby acquired rather to the
Improvement and Communication of his Studies, than to the more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable
Attainments of worldly Riches, Offices and Dignities. He is ſaid, by
<hi>Bale,</hi> to have been the Son of Sir <hi>Richard Elyot,</hi> and born in
<hi>Suffolk</hi>; but his chief Houſe and Eſtate was at <hi>Carleton</hi>
in <hi>Cambridgeſhire</hi>; of which County, we find him in the Liſt of
High Sheriffs, in the 24 and 36th of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and at which Town he
was buried in 1546, having a handſome Monument over his Grave. His Works,
partly original Compoſitions, partly Tranſlations, from <hi>Greek</hi> and
<hi>Latin,</hi> are all upon grave and important Subjects. They need not, upon
this occaſion, be here enumerated, being at leaſt a Dozen in number; 
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:0570200100:291"/> which, perhaps, in little more than ſo many Years, he
ſet forth in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Tongue; whereof his <hi>Dictionary</hi>
is not the leaſt conſiderable. But we may here obſerve, that the Accounts
which have hitherto been given of them, are very imperfect, eſpecially that
of <hi>Anthony Wood.</hi> As to this Book, named the <hi>Governour,</hi> we
find it to be the firſt he publiſhed; and it has been ſo well received,
as to have had as many, if not more Editions than any other of his Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
This Edition we make uſe of, is not mentioned in the Author laſt quoted;
and its having the Date of 1534, in the ornamental Border, from a wooden Print,
in the Title-Page, gives room to conjecture the Book was firſt printed that
Year.</p>
               <p>It is dedicated by the Author to King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and in
his ſaid Proheme, or Dedication, he has theſe Words, which verify in part
what we have above obſerved, and at the ſame time ſhew you the ſubject
Matter of his Work. 
<q rend="inline">"I have now enterpryſed to diſcribe, in our
Vulgare Tonge, the Forme of a juſt publike Weale; which Mattier I have
gathered, as well of the Saiyings of moſt noble Autors, (<hi>Greekes</hi> and
<hi>Latines</hi>) as by myne owne Experience; I being continually trained in
ſome daielye Affaires of the publicke Weale of this your moſt noble Realme,
almoſt from my Childhood; which Attemptate is not of Preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion to teache
any Perſon, I myſelf having moſt nede of teachyng; but only to the entent
that Men, which will be ſtudious about the Weale publyque, may find the
thynge thereto expedient, compendiouſly written. And for as muche as this
preſente Boke treateth of the Education of them, that hereafter maie be
deemed woorthy to be <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours</hi> of the publike Weal under your
Highneſſe, which <hi>Plato</hi> affirmeth to be the firſt and chief Parte
of a Publike Weal; <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaiynge alſo, where Governours be not,
the People ſhall falle into ruine; I therefore have named it the
<hi>Governour,</hi> and do now dedicate unto youre Hyghe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, as the
fyrſt Fruits of my Study, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>After the Table of Contents, our Author enters upon his Work,
which is divided into Three Books, with explaining the Signification of a
Publick Weal, and why it is called in <hi>Latin Reſpublica</hi>; giving the
Reaſon of Government, and ſhewing why Man, for his Underſtanding, and the
Honour which is due to it, is beſt fitted for the ſame. Further, that one
Sovereign Governor ought to be in a Publick Weal; and what Damage hath
happened, when a Multitude has had <pb n="263" facs="tcp:0570200100:292"/> equal Authority,
without any Sovereign? This is il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrated by many Examples, eſpecially
from our own Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the <hi>Saxon</hi> Invaſion and Diviſions of
this Kingdom, till it was reduced to its primitive Eſtate, by the noble King
<hi>Edgar:</hi> But here not propoſing to deſcribe the Office or Duty of a
<hi>Sovereign</hi> Governor, he diſtinguiſhes his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to treat of
the two Parts of a Publick Weal, named due <hi>Adminiſtration</hi> and
neceſſary <hi>Occupation,</hi> which ſhall be divided into two Volumes. 
<q rend="inline">"In the firſt, ſaith he, ſhall be
comprehended the beſt Form of Education or bryng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of noble Children
from their Nativitie, in ſuch manner, as thei may be found worthy, and alſo
able to be Governours of a Publyke Weale. The ſecond Volume, which God
grantyng me Quietneſe and Libertee of Minde, I will ſhortly after ſende
forth: It ſhall conteyn all the Remenant which I can, either by Learnyng or
Experience, find apt to the Perfection of a juſt Publike Weale; in which, I
ſhall ſo endeavour myſelf, that all Men, of what Aſtate or Condicion
ſoo ever thei bee, ſhall fynde therin Occaſion to be alwaie vertuouſly
occupied, and not without pleaſure, yf they be not of the Schools of
<hi>Ariſtippus,</hi> or <hi>Apitius</hi>; of whom, the one ſuppoſed
Feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citee to bee onely in Lecherye; the other, in delicate Feedynge and
Gluttonye; from whoſe ſharpe Talones, and cruelle Teethe, I beſeeche all
gentyll Readers to defende theſe Warkes, which for theyr Commoditee is only
compiled."</q> Then he proceeds to obſerve in the third Chapter, That in a
Publick Weal there ought to be inferior Governors, called
<hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> which ſhould be appointed, or choſen by the
Sovereign Governor. In the next Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, he treats of the <hi>Education</hi>
or Form of bringing up the Children of Gentlemen, which are to have Authority
in the Publick Weal: ſo proceeds to the Order of <hi>Learning,</hi> that
Noblemen, in their Minority, ſhould be trained to, and at what Age
<hi>Tutors</hi> ſhould be provided, and what belongs to their Office. In what
wiſe <hi>Muſick</hi> may be neceſſary to a Nobleman. The Commendation
of <hi>Painting</hi> and Carv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Gentleman. The exact Care required in
chuſing of <hi>Maſters.</hi> The Order to be uſed in Learning, and which
Authors to be firſt read. The Reaſons why Gentlemen at this time be not
equal in Doctrine to the ancient Noblemen, which are Pride, Avarice, and
Negligence of Parents, with the want or ſcarcity of ſufficient Maſters or
Tutors. Here we have a Character of <hi>Henry Beauclerk,</hi> King of
<hi>England,</hi> 
                  <pb n="264" facs="tcp:0570200100:293"/> and his Brothers: Alſo a
Commendation of <hi>Eloquence</hi> and of <hi>Poetry,</hi> with Tranſlations
of ſome Verſes from the ancient Poets, ſhewing what good Advice, even the
wanton Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters often contain; and that it were no Reaſon, for ſome little
matter that is in their Verſes, to abandon therefore all their Works. 
<q rend="inline">"No wiſe Man entreth into a Gardein, (ſais our
Author) but he ſoon eſpieth good Herbes from Net<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tils, and treadeth the
Nettils under his fete, whiles he gadreth good Herbes, whereby he taketh no
damage; or if he be ſtungen, he maketh light of it, and ſhortly forgetteth
it: Semblably if he do rede wanton Metter myxte with Wiſedome, he putteth the
worſt under fote, and ſorteth out the beſt; or if his Courage be ſtered
or provoked, he remembreth the litteil Pleaſure and great Detriment that
ſhulde enſue of it, and withdrawyng his Mynde to ſome other Study or
Exerciſe, ſhortly forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth it."</q> From hence, we paſs to the
<hi>Law,</hi> and ſome Obſervations upon the Improvements to be made in the
Study thereof. The Cauſe why, at this day, there be in this Realm ſo few
perfect <hi>School-Maſters.</hi> Sundry Forms of <hi>Exerciſe</hi>
mentioned, as neceſſary for every Gentleman; ſome of which are referred
to in <hi>Galen's</hi> Book, <hi>De Sanitate tuenda</hi>; 
<q rend="inline">"which is tranſlated into <hi>Latine</hi>
wonderfull elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, by Dr. <hi>Linacre,</hi> late moſt woorthy
Phiſicion to our Moſt Noble Soveraigne Lord Kyng <hi>Henry</hi> VIII."</q>
And thoſe mentioned are <hi>Wreſtling, Running, Swimming,</hi> Art of
<hi>Defence, Riding</hi> and <hi>Vaulting</hi>; and here ſpeaking of
<hi>Horſes</hi> he ſais, 
<q rend="inline">"It is ſuppoſed, that the Caſtle of
<hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> was made by one <hi>Beauvize,</hi>
Erl of <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ampton,</hi> for a Monument of his Horſe, named
<hi>Arundell,</hi> which in far Countries hadde ſaved his Maiſter from
ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Perils."</q> Then we come to the ancient <hi>Hunting</hi> of the
<hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans</hi>; alſo of <hi>Hawking</hi>; and next of
<hi>Dancing</hi>; ſhewing, that it is not all in general to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. The
Antiquity of Dancing, and wherefore in the good Order of Dancing, a Man and
Woman dance toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. How Dancing may be an Introduction to the firſt moral
Virtue, called Prudence. Of the Motions in Danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and what they are called;
as the <hi>Honour,</hi> the <hi>Braul</hi>; with an Explanation of the word
<hi>Maturity</hi>; the <hi>Singles</hi> and <hi>Reprinſe,</hi> or Indication
of Circumſpection, which gives our Author an Opportunity, under that
Conſideration, to deliver a laudatory Character of King <hi>Henry</hi> VII.
Other Branches of Prudence are alſo further deſcrib'd, from other 
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0570200100:294"/> Motions or Steps in Dancing. This ends with a
Criticiſm on the words <hi>Modeſty</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> not
hitherto known in the Engliſh Tongue, and of the word <hi>Manſuetude,</hi>
till this time, alſo unknown in our Tongue; with Reaſons for na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalizing
Words from the <hi>Romans,</hi> as they did from the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians.</hi> Hence
we paſs to other Paſtimes, expedient, if mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately uſed. Here
<hi>Dicing</hi> is ſhrewdly cenſured, its ill Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences expos'd, and
the vicious Motives to it; with Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples how contemptible it was held by the
Ancients. <hi>Cards</hi> and <hi>Tables</hi> are more favourably cenſured, as
depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more on Wit, and truſting leſs in Fortune; eſpecially were
ſuch Improvements made in theſe kinds of Gaming, that Knowledge or Science
in higher things might thereby be advanced delightfully, and ſo as to tender
Study moſt commodious, whether in military Contentions, or thoſe between
Virtue and Vice, or any other laudable Invention. To this end, is the Game of
<hi>Cheſſe</hi> commended, and as moſt pleaſant to thoſe Players at
it, who have read the <hi>Moralization</hi> of it, and think thereof in their
Play; which Book is in <hi>Engliſh</hi> but very ſcarce, becauſe few, in
their Play, ſeek for Virtue or Wiſdom. Thus we come to <hi>Shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
in the Long-Bow, which he commends as the principal of all other Exerciſes,
not only for being more moderate, but more ſerviceable; having been our
beſt Defence, and made us moſt victorious, fam'd, and fear'd, as may be
ſeen in the Hiſtories of King <hi>Richard</hi> I. and King <hi>Edward</hi>
I. Hence our Author takes occaſion to exclaim againſt the Decay of Archery
in his Time, and the Neglect of putting in Execution thoſe Laws and
Proviſions which were made for reſtoring the ſame: And here he concludes
the firſt Book, containing 27 Chapters, and 84 Leaves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> Book begins with laying down ſuch virtuous
<hi>Admonitions,</hi> as ſhould be premeditated by whomſoever is appointed
a Governor of a Publick Weal; with ſome Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples produced to prove, that as
the Governor is, ſuch is the People; and more refer'd to in
<hi>Hiſtory</hi>; the Readers of which, our Author moſt deſires ſhould
be, of all others, Princes and Governors. Thoſe Admonitions our Author would
have delectably written, and ſet in a Table within the Governor's Bedchamber,
with thoſe Verſes of <hi>Claudian</hi> to the Emperor <hi>Honorius</hi>
added, which he has here trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, and of which we ſhall give our Reader
only this Taſte: 
<q>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:0570200100:295"/> 
                     <l>What thou <hi>mayſt</hi> do, delight not for to know;</l> 
                     <l>But rather what thing will <hi>become</hi> thee beſt:</l> 
                     <l>Embrace thou Vertue, keep thy Courage low,</l> 
                     <l>And think that always Meaſure is a Feaſt.</l>
                  </q> And
juſt before: 
<q> 
                     <l>If Luſt or Anger do thy Mind aſſail:</l> 
                     <l>Subdue Occaſion, thou ſhalt ſoon prevail.</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Then proceeds he to the Expoſition of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> which
he calls 
<q rend="inline">"The Fountain of all excellent Manners, the whole
Proportion and Figure of noble State; and is properly a Beauty or Comelineſs
in Countenance, Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and Geſture, apt to his Dignity, and accommodate to
Time, Place and Company; which like as the Sun doth his Beams, ſo doth it
caſt on the Beholders and Hearers a pleaſant and terrible Reverence,"
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q> Next, we have his Judgment and Advice about the
<hi>Apparel</hi> fit for a Nobleman, who is a Governor or great Counſellor;
alſo concerning the <hi>Furniture</hi> of his Houſe; the Definition or
Deſcription of true <hi>Nobility,</hi> and whence it took its Deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination;
in which Chapter he has this Alluſion: 
<q rend="inline">"We have in this Realm Coynes, which be called
<hi>Nobles</hi>; as long as thei be ſene to be Golde, thei be ſo called;
but if thei be counterfeited and made in Braſs, Coper or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vile Mettall;
who, for the Print onely, calleth theim <hi>Nobles?</hi> wherby it appereth,
that the Eſtimation is in the Mettall, and not in the Print or Figure."</q>
Hence he proceeds to the Praiſe of <hi>Affability,</hi> and the Uſe thereof
in every State, more particularly in the Facility of Addreſs or being
ſpoken to; with Examples of the diſmal Condition of a Prince and his Realm,
where Liberty of <hi>Speech</hi> is reſtrain'd. The notable Virtue of
<hi>Placability</hi> is alſo here illuſtrated; and here he gives us at
large, a domeſtick Example of this Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, comparable with the beſt that
ever was recorded of any other Princes or People, in the notable Story of King
<hi>Henry</hi> the IV. his Thankſgiving to God, upon hearing that the
<hi>Prince of Wales,</hi> afterwards our renowned King <hi>Henry</hi> V. was
committed to Priſon, and the Reaſon thereof; in that he was bleſs'd with
ſuch a <hi>Judge,</hi> as feared not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter, and ſuch a
<hi>Son,</hi> as ſcorned not to obey <hi>Juſtice</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Sir <hi>Thomas Elyot</hi> quotes no Authority for this curious
Story; and I recollect not any more ancient than his own, in this Book.
<hi>John Speed,</hi> in his <hi>Chronicle,</hi> quotes it from this Place. And
Dr. <hi>Fuller,</hi> tho' he miſquotes our Author, as if it were from Sir
<hi>T. Elyot</hi>'s Chronicle (for no ſuch Book did he ever publiſh) yet
ſeems rightly to add, 
<q rend="inline">"from whom our modern Hiſtorians have
tranſcribed it."</q> 
                     <hi>Shakeſpear,</hi> in the ſecond Part of his
<hi>Henry</hi> IV. has made a lively Scene of it for the Stage, and enlarged it
with Circumſtances, as a Dramatiſt has a Licenſe to do. But
<hi>Stow</hi>'s Computation of the time which the <hi>Chief Juſtice</hi>
con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in this Story ſat on the Bench, is obſerved to have been too
much contracted; and <hi>John Truſſel</hi>'s Account of King
<hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the V. his Acknowledgment of the ſaid Judge's Juſtice, as
if he were alive, after the Coronation of that King, is obſerved not to agree
with the time of the ſaid Chief Juſtice's Death. For Sir <hi>William
Gaſcoigne</hi> was this Judge, who committed Prince <hi>Henry</hi> to
Priſon, and he was made Chief Juſtice of the King's-Bench, in the firſt
of <hi>Henry</hi> IV. according to <hi>Fuller,</hi> as he aſſures us from
our authentic Records, or 15 of <hi>November</hi> 1401, which was 3 of that
King, according to <hi>Dugdale</hi>; and died on the 17th of <hi>December,</hi>
in the 14th or laſt Year of that King, which was in 1412, according to the
Date on his Monument in <hi>Harwood</hi> Church in <hi>Yorkſhire,</hi> and
the Pedigree of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, ſtill in being. What confirms the Truth of this
Story here above-mention'd is, That there is a Medal ſtruck in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration
thereof, an Impreſſion of which I have ſeen. It is not ſo broad as a
Guinea, has his Name written round it in the old <hi>Engliſh</hi> Characters,
with the Image of himſelf, I ſuppoſe, ſitting on a Bench by another
Perſon, and reading to three Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors before him. Mr. <hi>J.
Hopkinſon,</hi> in his MS. Volume of the <hi>Pedigrees of the Yorkſhire
Gentry,</hi> has given us a Specimen of this Name's being ſpell'd more
variouſly than any other I ever met with. It is upon the ſaid Medal Sir
<hi>Wylliam de Gaſquone,</hi> as I remember, but has ſince been moſt
generally written <hi>Gaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coigne</hi>; tho' <hi>Fuller,</hi> who was
acquainted with an accompliſhed Antiquary in <hi>Record-heraldry,</hi> of the
ſame Family, and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>name, writes him <hi>Gaſcoinge.</hi>
                  </note>. From
hence we paſs to Arguments and Examples, ſhewing <pb n="267" facs="tcp:0570200100:296"/>
that a Governor ought to be merciful, with the difference between
<hi>Mercy</hi> and vain <hi>Pity.</hi> Here we have the choice Example of Mercy
ſhewed by the Emperor <hi>Auguſtus</hi> to his Enemy <hi>Lucius Cinna,</hi>
from <hi>Seneca.</hi> Then he deſcants upon the other principal Parts of
Humanity; the Excellency of <hi>Benevolence, Patience, Charity,</hi> adorn'd
with many anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Examples. Of <hi>Beneficence, Liberality,</hi> and
<hi>Prodigality.</hi> The true Deſcription of <hi>Friendſhip.</hi> The
wonderful Hiſtory of <hi>Titus</hi> and <hi>Giſippus,</hi> whereby is fully
declared the Figure of perfect Amity, with ſome Cautions to know a
<hi>Friend</hi> from a <hi>Flatterer.</hi> The Diviſion of
<hi>Ingratitude,</hi> and the Diſpraiſe <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0570200100:297"/> thereof,
with Inſtances of Kindneſs in Beaſts. Of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of Friends, and
the Diverſity of <hi>Flatterers,</hi> illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted alſo with ancient
Examples and Obſervations. That many <hi>Friends</hi> are neceſſary for a
Governor: and herewith ends the <hi>Second Book,</hi> at the 141 Leaf,
containing 14 Chapters.</p>
               <p>The <hi>third</hi> and laſt <hi>Book,</hi> begins with a
Diſcourſe on the noble and moſt excellent Virtue named
<hi>Juſtice</hi>; whereupon it is obſerved from whence the Name of King
firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; the Diſtinctions between commutative and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rective
Juſtice; ſo proceeds to the firſt Part of Juſtice diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butive. And
here is firſt recommended the Love and Honour of <hi>God,</hi> and the
Example of the Gentiles inſtanc'd, who in ſuch Honour placed the chief Part
of Juſtice. This leads us to obſerve the Tranquillity that is cauſed by
<hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and to conſider the Places conſecrated for the ſame.
Here we have the Juſtice of raiſing <hi>Temples</hi> for that purpoſe,
and offering our Worſhip therein with convenient <hi>Ceremonies.</hi> Next he
treats of the three Counſellors of Juſtice, <hi>Reaſon, Society</hi> and
<hi>Knowledge,</hi> and of its two Enemies, <hi>Violence</hi> and
<hi>Fraud</hi>; with Examples ſhewing, that Juſtice ought to be between
Enemies. Diſtinctions of the Word <hi>Fides,</hi> which is the Foundation of
Juſtice; as when it may be called <hi>Faith</hi>; when <hi>Credance</hi>;
when <hi>Truſt</hi>; alſo when named <hi>Loyalty,</hi> according to the
<hi>French,</hi> or <hi>Fidelity,</hi> from the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi>; with ſeveral
hiſtorical Illuſtrations of the ſame. Then we come to that Part of
<hi>Fidelity,</hi> which concerns the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Promiſes</hi> or
<hi>Covenants:</hi> and here ends his Diſcourſe upon Juſtice. So we enter
upon the noble Virtue of <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi> and the two extreme Vices,
<hi>Audacity</hi> and <hi>Time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſity</hi>: more particularly in what Acts
Fortitude conſiſts; and that <hi>Painfulneſs</hi> is the firſt
Companion of Fortitude, with ancient Examples verifying the ſame, according
to the Method hitherto purſued. Thus we come to his Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendations of
<hi>Patience:</hi> Advice how it may be obtained, and a Remedy againſt
<hi>Impatience.</hi> Of Patience in ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Wrongs</hi> and
<hi>Rebukes</hi>; alſo in Repulſes, or Hinderance of <hi>Promotion,</hi>
with the Commodities which happen from the Advancement of good Men. Hence we
proceed to the Praiſe of <hi>Magnanimity:</hi> And in this Chapter, among
other Examples, we have that of King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Treatment to the King of
<hi>Scots,</hi> who wondered, that himſelf, and other tall able-bodied
Princes and Commanders, ſhould ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſubdued by
ſuch a little Body as <hi>Edgar</hi> was: Proving, that by this Virtue, and
not by Chance, he was <pb n="269" facs="tcp:0570200100:298"/> preferred to the Sovereignty over
ſo brave a People. Here follow the Vices attending this Virtue, ſuch as
<hi>Obſtinacy</hi> and <hi>Ambition. Abſtinence</hi> and
<hi>Continence</hi> are next treated of, as the Companions of Fortitude; the
former eſpecially with relation to Rewards; with Examples ſhewing, how
backward good Men have been againſt being led into the Bondage thereof; and
of the latter, we have alſo Examples in ſeveral eminent Perſons. Next of
Conſtancy, Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Moderation. Of <hi>Sapience,</hi> and the
Definition thereof. The Signification of the <hi>Muſes</hi>; of
<hi>Science</hi>; the <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</hi> Of paſt <hi>Experience,</hi>
and a Defence of <hi>Hiſtory,</hi> wherefore it is commendable, what it
ſignifies; with an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the Objections of thoſe who would ſlight
the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages thereof, becauſe it has been ſometimes corrupted with
fabulous Inventions. Next we are taught the other Part of Experience or
Practice, neceſſary in the proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a Governor; and then, as a
Vice neceſſary to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged in Men in Authority, we have a
Eſſay upon <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction,</hi> with a Deſcription of the Picture which
<hi>Apelles</hi> painted thereof. Laſtly, the three concluding Chapters are
upon <hi>Counſel</hi> and <hi>Conſultation,</hi> in what form they ought to
uſed in a Publick Weale, and what therein ought to be chiefly conſidered.
As the Choice of good Counſellors, and Regard to be paid them; with the
Method of <hi>Belinger Baldaſine,</hi> to diſcover what would be the
Reſult of Opinions in Council; and the Matter to be conſulted of; in which
Generals are to be conſidered before Particulars: And with this Head
concludes the third and laſt Book of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Work; which Book
contains 30 Chapters, and the Volume ends with the Number of Leaves obſerved
at the Beginning.</p>

               <p>IT was a Cuſtom, in the Reign when this Collection was made, and
indeed one or two Reigns after, not fuller of Induſtry than Modeſty, and
publick Spirit, for Gentlemen, of good Intelligence, thus to copy over and
tranſmit in Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes to Poſterity, ſo many little, obſervable and
authentic Memoirs, as otherwiſe, for their Incongruity, could never have been
preſerved; but for their Uſe have been much prefer'd to our beſt
Libraries. In a Collection of this kind, there is all the Toil of writing,
which in a continued Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory is employed, but none of the Partiality; all
the Uſe of Hiſtories compiled for the Preſs, but none of the Profit: as
if only the Information of After ages were intended thereby; and all Praiſe,
Reward, or Memory of thoſe, who were Inſtrumental to it, ſtudiouſly
declined: For from the Generality of theſe Collections, which we have ſeen,
it ſeldom does appear, otherwiſe than from what may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, as in
the preſent Caſe, who was the Collector, or the Scribe; or by whom, and for
what end they were ſet to work; yet the end may be commonly underſtood in
moſt of theſe Collections; ſeeing many Particulars may be too well
<hi>known,</hi> or contain too much <hi>Truth,</hi> or be Matter of too
<hi>private</hi> a Concern, or need the further Illuſtration of
correſponding <hi>Authorities,</hi> to be put in print in their Collectors
own Time; but tranſmitted thus, in a <hi>Miſcella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> or Cluſter of
indifferent Matters, they are preſerved, like Fruits that find a Safeguard in
their own Leaves, till they arrive at that Maturity, in which it is fit they
ſhould be, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſionally, gathered for publick Uſe.</p>
               <p>The preſent Collection, may, perhaps, as to ſome Parts of it,
be looked upon in this light. Tho' the Tranſcriber's <pb n="271" facs="tcp:0570200100:300"/>
Name does not directly appear, ſeveral Parts of the <hi>Collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> may
ſufficiently authoriſe the <hi>Title</hi> we have drawn out for it, as
above. The Period of Time it relates to, may be comprehended between the Years
1584 and 1589; they being the earlieſt and lateſt Dates we find therein;
and hence have we ſettled the Date in the ſaid Title we have given it; as
believing nothing in the Book to be written below that Year. It begins with a
Letter from the Privy Council to the Earl of <hi>Pembroke,</hi> informing him
of her Majeſty's Pleaſure, that the ſix hundred Foot, and thirty-two
Demilances to be levied for the Service in the North out of the County of
<hi>Salop,</hi> ſhould be taken out of the trained Numbers only, in reſpect
of the preſent Neceſſity, and the Importance of the Service wherein they
are to be employ'd; alſo cenſuring ſome Negligence in his Lordſhip's
Care for her Majeſty's Service, touching the Certificates of his Deputy
Lieutenants of <hi>Salop</hi> and <hi>Wigorne</hi>; for that the Proviſions
and Weapons they had ſupply'd were nothing an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to Expectation. And
further, deſiring his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's Opinion, if the contagious Sickneſs now
at <hi>Ludlow</hi> ſhould continue, whether her Majeſty's Houſhold
ſhould be removed to ſome other Place, and his Lordſhip not repair into
<hi>Wilts</hi> till it was over, &amp;c. This is the Subſtance of the ſaid
Letter, which is ſubſcribed with the Names of ſome Privy Counſellors;
but the Leaf is ſo much damaged, and the Writing blinded by ſome Wet which
has befaln it, that all we can further read, and this with great Difficulty, is
the Name of <hi>Comptroller, Chamberlain</hi> and <hi>Walſingham</hi>; but
may gueſs, from the hazardous Times ſpoken of in it, that it was written at
the firſt arming of the Nation againſt the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Invaſion,
about the Year 1586. The next Piece, is a remarkable Letter from the Earl of
<hi>Leyceſter,</hi> then Governour of the Low Countries, to Sir <hi>Thomas
Hennage,</hi> dated the 23d of September 1586, beginning thus: 
<q rend="inline">"Sithens my other Letters of the 20th, yt fell
oute that yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day Morninge ſome Intelligence was broughte, that the
Enemie was bringing a Convoye of Victuall, garded with 300 Horſe. There was
ſente out to ympeache yt, 200 Horſe and 300 Footemen, and a Nomber more
both Horſe and Foote to ſecond them: Among other young Men my Nephew Sir
<hi>Philip Sydney</hi> was, and the rather for that the Coronell
<hi>Norrice</hi> himſelfe went with the Stande of Footemen, to ſecond the
reſt; but the Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Prince was marched and came with this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voye,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0570200100:301"/> and being a myſtie Morninge, our Men fell into the
Ambuſcade of Footemen, who were 3000, the moſte Musketts, the reſte
Pykes. Our Horſemen being for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſte by their haſte indeede, woulde not
turne, but paſte throughe and charged the Horſemen that flede at the backe
of their Footmen ſo valientlie, as albeyt they were 1100 Horſe, and of the
verie Chieffe of all his Troupes, they brake them, being not 200. Many of our
Horſes hurt and killed, among which was my Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phewes owne. He wente and
changed to another, and woulde needes to the Charge again, and onſte paſte
thoſe Musketters; where he receyved a ſore Wounde upon his Thighe, three
Fingers above his Knee, the Bone broken quite in Peeces; but for whiche Chance,
God did ſend ſuch a Daye as I thinke was never many Yeres ſeene, ſo
fewe againſte ſo many."</q> Here the Earl proceeds to enumerate the
Commanders and other Perſons of Diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this Rencounter, whoſe
Names were Colonel <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice,</hi> who had the Charge of the Foot, my Lord
of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Perrot,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"and my unfortunate <hi>Phillip,</hi> ſais he,
with Sir <hi>William Ruſſell,</hi> and divers Gentlemen, and not one hurte
but only my Nephew. They killed four of their Enemies chief Leaders, and
carried the valient Count <hi>Hannibal Gonzaga</hi> away with them upon a
Horſe; alſo took Captain <hi>George Creſier,</hi> the principal Soldier
of the Camp and Captain of all the <hi>Albanez.</hi> My Lord
<hi>Willoughbie</hi> overthrew him at the firſt Encounter, Horſe and Man.
The Gentleman did acknowledge it himſelf. There is not a properer Gentleman
in the Worlde to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards than this Lord <hi>Willoughbie</hi> is; but I can hardly
prayſe one more than another, they did all ſo well; yet every one had his
Horſe killed or hurt."</q> And it was thought very ſtrange, 
<q rend="inline">"that Sir <hi>William Stanley,</hi> with 300 of
his Men ſhould paſs in ſpight of ſo many Muskets, ſuch Troops of
Horſe, three ſeveral Times, making them remove their Ground, and to return
with no more Loſs than he did. Albeyt, I muſt ſay (continues the Earl) yt
was too much Loſs for me, for this young Manne was my greateſte Comforte
next her Majeſtie of all the Worlde, and if I could buy his Lieffe with all I
have, to my Sherte, I woulde geve yt. How God will diſpoſe of him I know
not, but feare I muſt needes, greately, the worſte; the Blow is in ſo
dangerous a place, and ſo great; yet did I never heare of any Manne that did 
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:0570200100:302"/> abide the dreſſinge and ſettinge his Bones better
than he did: And he was carried afterwards in my Barge to <hi>Arnheim,</hi> and
I heare this Daye he ys ſtill of good hearte, and comforteth all aboute him
as much as maye be. God of his Mercie graunte me his Lieffe, which I cannot but
doubt of greately. I was abrode that tyme in the Fielde, givinge ſome Order
to ſupplie that Buſineſs, which did indure almoſte twoe Owres in
continuall Fighte; and metinge <hi>Phillip</hi> commynge upon his Horſebacke,
not a lytle to my Greafe. But I woulde you had ſtode by to heare his moſt
loyall Speeches to her Majeſtie; his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Minde to the Cauſe, his
lovinge Care over me, and his moſte reſolute Determmation for Deathe, not
one Jott appalled for his Blow; which ys the moſte greevous that ever I
ſawe with ſuch a Bullet; ryding ſo, a longe myle and a halfe, uppon his
Horſe, ere he came to the Campe; not ceaſing to ſpeak ſtill of her
Majeſtie; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glad, yf his Hurte and Deathe mighte any waye ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour her
Majeſtie; for her's he was whileſte he lyved, and God's he was ſure to be
yf hee dyed: Prayed all Men to thinke that the Cauſe was as well her
Majeſtie's as the Countrie's; and not to be diſcoraged, for you have
ſeene ſuche Succeſſe as maye encorage us all; and this my Hurte is the
Ordinance of God, by the happe of the Warre. Well I praye God, yf yt be his
Will, ſave me his Lieffe; even as well for her Majeſtie's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice ſake,
as for myne own Comforte."</q> Theſe are the Earl's Words, concerning his
ſaid worthy Nephew; and we thought it wou'd be excuſable to tranſcribe
thus parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly all he has there ſaid of Sir <hi>Philip Sidney,</hi> being
a Man of ſuch particular Merit; even tho' it ſhould oblige us to be the
more general and conciſe in ſucceeding Topicks. The reſt of the Letter,
above a Page of ſmall Writing more in folio, relates to the Account of their
Enemies Retreat, the Priſoners taken, and the chief <hi>Spaniards</hi> who
were at the Charge, with the Number of their Forces; the hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Enterprizes
of the Lord <hi>North,</hi> who tho' bruiſed on the Knee with a Musket-Shot,
yet leaving his Bed, haſtned to this Skirmiſh, one Boot on and t'other off,
and went to the Matter very luſtily: Alſo of two hopeful young Gentlemen in
the Camp, Mr. <hi>Hatton</hi> and Mr. <hi>Umpton,</hi> who were as ready in the
Service as the meaneſt Soldiers, and got with their Pikes into their
Fore-ranks, under <hi>Row<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Yorke,</hi> to ſecond Sir <hi>William
Stanley</hi>'s Company; <pb n="274" facs="tcp:0570200100:303"/> 
                  <q rend="inline">"and till we ſee what the Prince will do,
theſe notable young Fellows, ſais the Earl, will not away:"</q> And to this
Effect ends the Letter: Signed <hi>Robte: Leyceſter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Piece may be entitled, <hi>Arguments for the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
Execution of</hi> Mary <hi>Queen of</hi> Scots. We have not Leiſure now to
examine whether it has ever been printed, nor can we certainly ſay that the
Earl aforeſaid was the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of it; therefore ſhall only obſerve, that
it here makes four Pages, and begins with theſe Words: 
<q rend="inline">"It may ſeeme a vayne Labor to goe about to
heape upp Reaſons for the perſuadinge of that which is of ſuch
Neceſſitie, as yt were againſte all Reaſon any waye to thinke it mighte
be deſuaded."</q> It is written in the ſame Hand with the former, and
followed by another Letter of the ſaid Earl's writing, giving a further
Account to ſome Nobleman here in <hi>England,</hi> of their Succeſs in
winning a Town by Battery, and the Enemies yielding before Aſſault; in
breaking their Horſemen in a moſt valiant Skirmiſh; get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting from their
Footmen two moſt ſtrong Forts by Aſſault, and making them forſake the
third by Night, the Prince himſelf being at hand with his whole Army; and
never at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting after the firſt Skirmiſh to empeach them: Which he only
ſpeaks in general of here, expecting the Earl of <hi>Eſſex,</hi> or
ſome other that come over, will be more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. And now that the Prince
is retired, intends to diſmiſs his Army into Garriſon, and make a Skip
over to ſee his Friends, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Dated at the Camp, 14
<hi>Octo.</hi> 1586. After this, we have a Letter, ſigned <hi>Richard
Hollande,</hi> to a noble Lord, intreating that his Lordſhip would be
preſent at the hearing of a Cauſe in the Star-Chamber, wherein his
Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-in-Law, Mr. <hi>Dokenfield</hi> was concerned: Tis dated from
<hi>Heaton,</hi> 3 <hi>May,</hi> 1586. And then follows, <hi>Queen</hi>
Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth's <hi>Speech in Parliament,</hi> alſo the ſame Year,
<hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Form of proceeding againſt the Queen of</hi> Scots; and
the Delay of her immediate Anſwer to their Petition for the Execution of the
ſaid Queen, till ſhe had firſt, 
<q rend="inline">"with earneſt Prayer, beſeeched his divine
Majeſty, ſo to illuminate her Underſtanding, and inſpire her with his
Grace, as ſhe may do and determine that, which ſhall prove to the
Eſtabliſhment of his Church, preſervation of their Eſtates, and
Proſperity of this Commonwealth under her Charge."</q> This Speech
conſiſts of four Pages and a half, and begins with theſe Words: 
<q rend="inline">"The bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Graces and immeaſurable
Benefits beſtowed upon me <pb n="275" facs="tcp:0570200100:304"/> by Almighty God, are and
have been ſuch, as I muſt not only acknowledge them, but alſo admire
them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>"</q> The next is Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s Speech, in
<hi>anſwer to the French Ambaſſador, Monſieur</hi> Believre, <hi>and
the reſt of his Company,</hi> juſtifying her Proceedings againſt the
Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi> It begins thus: 
<q rend="inline">"My Lords Ambaſſadors, I truſt ſo much
upon the Goodneſs of the King my good Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>"</q> And
therein her Majeſty ſais; 
<q rend="inline">"I aſſure you, that all the Sorrows and
Afflictions which ever I did receive, as concerning the Deaths of the King my
Father, the King my Brother, and the Queen my Siſter, have not been ſuch a
Grief unto my Heart as the Matter we ſpeak of. I call God to witneſs if
ever I would uſe her as ſhe hath done me: All this I take upon my Salvation
or Damnation. I have ſeen many Hiſtories, and read I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve as many, I
believe, as any Chriſtian Prince or Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, but I never found one Matter
like unto this. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member well your Diſcourſe, and all that you have
al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged unto me, but it cannot intice me to change my Will,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>"</q> Then follows the moſt ſorrowful and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate
Letter of <hi>Margaret,</hi> Queen of <hi>Navarre,</hi> to Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur de
<hi>Sarlant,</hi> complaining of the Queen her Mother's abandoning her to
ſhameful Ruin; and proteſting, 
<q rend="inline">"That as her Heart wou'd not let her fall into the
Hands of her Enemies alive, ſhe would never eat more; and that the first News
her Mother ſhoud hear of her ſhoud be her Death."</q> After this we have,
<hi>The Booke of the whole Navie,</hi> containing the Names of all the Queen's
Majeſtie's Shippes, with their Tonnage, and nomber of Mariners, Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and
Souldiers the 27 of <hi>December,</hi> 1585. From hence we learn the <hi>Royal
Navy</hi> then conſiſted of 36 Ships; that the biggeſt, named the
<hi>Triumph,</hi> was of 1000 Tun Burden, carried 350 Mariners, 50 Gunners, and
200 Soldiers. Of the reſt, two were of 900 Ton, one of 800, one of 650, and
ſeven of 500, ſo leſſening down to 20 Ton ſome of them. This Liſt
is followed with a Diſcourſe, entitled, <hi>An Analogie or Reſemblance
between</hi> Joan <hi>Queene of</hi> Naples, <hi>and</hi> Mary <hi>Queen
of</hi> Scotland. It conſiſts of three Leaves; and the Facts or
Circumſtances are drawn for Queen <hi>Joan,</hi> chiefly from <hi>Ran.
Collenutius,</hi> Lib. 5. <hi>de Regno Neapolitano; Pet. Mexia in vita
Vencelai; Platina</hi>; and <hi>Leonardus Areti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus, in Hiſtoria
Florentina;</hi> and thoſe for Queen <hi>Mary</hi> are gather'd from
<hi>Buchanan, de Nuptiis Mariae,</hi> alſo his Hiſtory of
<hi>Scotland,</hi> and her own Letters. This is followed with 
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0570200100:305"/> an <hi>Addition</hi> to the ſaid <hi>Analogy,</hi> of
17 Pages; containing hiſtorical Examples or Precedents of Sovereign Princes
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condemned and put to death, in a formal and adviſed Manner; in the
Stories of Queen <hi>Joan</hi> aforeſaid, who was deliberately executed by
<hi>Charles,</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> thro' the Advice of <hi>Lewis</hi>
King of <hi>Hungary</hi>; and <hi>Conradine</hi> King of <hi>Naples,</hi> who
was in like manner condemned and publickly executed; and the moſt Chriſtian
<hi>Conſtantine,</hi> who put to death the Emperor <hi>Licinius,</hi> with a
Compariſon between this Caſe and that of the Queen of <hi>Scots</hi>; and
here we have a Book of this Queen's referr'd to, called <hi>Expetit.
Cauſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> &amp;c. Then follows a ſecond Precedent of an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror,
<hi>Tiberius,</hi> who put the King of <hi>Thrace</hi> to death, as we have it
in <hi>Livy, Tacitus</hi> and <hi>Suetonius</hi>: Alſo a third Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent in
the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> VII. who deprived <hi>Robert</hi> King of
<hi>Naples,</hi> and gave Sentence of Death againſt him. Nay, we have
ſeveral Examples alſo produced of Popes, who cannot err, as themſelves
affirm, giving their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the putting of Kings to death; as of Pope
<hi>Clement</hi> IV. againſt <hi>Conradine,</hi> King of <hi>Sicily</hi>;
alſo Pope <hi>Boniface,</hi> who put Pope <hi>Caeleſtine</hi> to death,
leſt he ſhou'd, for his ſingular Virtue, be called again to the See; and
Pope <hi>Urban</hi> VIII. who not only put to death eight Cardinals, who are
accounted part of his Body, called his Brethren, and in Offence to whoſe
Perſons, the Crime of Treaſon lies, according to <hi>Gigas</hi> and
<hi>Julius Clarus,</hi> but carried three of their Carkaſſes, dried in an
Oven, about with him in Portmanteaus, and had their purple Hats born up before
him, in terror to others; which Examples, and others, are taken from
<hi>Collenutius, Guildefingenſe, Corn. Agrippa, Platina, Pedro Mexia,
Auguſtine,</hi> beſides ſome from the ancient <hi>Romans;</hi> and
confirming Authorities from <hi>Hugoline, Johan. Delignano,</hi> and others;
and all to encourage the execution of the unquiet Queen of <hi>Scots.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The next Piece is a Letter of a private Nature, from Sir
<hi>Edward Standley</hi> to my Lord his Brother, intreating him to move the
Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> to make his Friend <hi>John Kine</hi> a
Proctor of the Arches; and contains ſome Acknowledgments for the receipt of
ſome Monies from his <hi>Lordſhip</hi> for his Charges in a Law-Suit: It is
dated from <hi>Winwycke,</hi> 29 <hi>December,</hi> 1586. And then fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows
<hi>Liber Pacis</hi> 1584; or <hi>the Names of all the Juſtices of
Aſſize</hi> in the ſeveral Counties of <hi>England</hi> and
<hi>Wales.</hi> This Liſt, in double Columns, takes up 29 Leaves. After this,
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0570200100:306"/> we have another Liſt, which is called alſo, <hi>a
Book of the Number, Names, and Burden of all the Ships, Barques, and
Veſſels, with the Names of all Maſters and able Mariners belonging
thereto, within or appertaining to the River of</hi> Cheſter. It was written
by <hi>William Wale,</hi> the Mayor, at the Command of the Earl of
<hi>Derby</hi>; to whom it is addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in an Epiſtle, by the ſaid
Mayor; bearing Date 18 <hi>February,</hi> 1586; and it appears in theſe
Liſts, that the Number of Ships, Barques, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> from the Burden of
twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to ſixty Tons, were fifteen in Number; and that the Owners,
Maſters, and Mariners, with the Places of their abode are named, and number'd
at 152. To this is joined, the like Account of all the Barques,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> belonging to the River of <hi>Preſton,</hi> (in
<hi>Lancaſhire</hi>) called the Water of <hi>Rible</hi>; and this is
perform'd by <hi>Laurence Walle,</hi> Mayor of <hi>Preſton,</hi> at the
Command of the ſaid Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> he being Lord Lieutenant alſo
of this County, as appears by this Mayor's Letter to his Lordſhip. This
Liſt of Veſſels is contained in one Page; and they are eight in Number,
from the Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of four to ten Ton. The like Book or Liſt of all the
Veſſels belonging to the River <hi>Wyer</hi> in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> as
well abroad as at home, with their Burden, Maſters, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to the ſaid Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> according to his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
the ſame Year, by <hi>Henry Butler,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and <hi>William
Skillicorne,</hi> Gent. The Number of theſe Veſſels are 28, and the
Burden between four and eighteen Ton. This is followed with ſuch another
Account of the Veſſels, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the Peele of <hi>Foodre</hi> and the
Creeks thereof, in <hi>Fournes</hi> and <hi>Cartmeale,</hi> within the ſaid
County of <hi>Lanca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>; directed to the ſaid Earl of
<hi>Derby,</hi> the ſame Year, according to his Command, by <hi>John
Bradley,</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and <hi>John Richardſon,</hi> Gent. They are
but five Veſſels in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, from the Burden of two to twenty Ton. And to
this is joined one more ſuch Liſt of all the Veſſels in the Port of
<hi>Liverpoole,</hi> in the ſaid County, taken the ſame Year; with the
Names of the Places they were bound to; the Owners, Mariners, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
They appear to be twenty-eight in Number, and from eight to forty Ton Burden.
Then follows a Note concerning the intire <hi>Subſidy,</hi> and the two
<hi>Fifteenths</hi> and <hi>Tenths</hi> granted in Parliament; the firſt
Pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof was to be in <hi>November</hi> next (<hi>viz.</hi> 1587) and
the ſecond in <hi>November</hi> 1588: With the Manner of appointing the
Collectors thereof. After this we have a <hi>Letter from Captain</hi> A.
Cosbye, dated at <hi>Utrecht</hi> the 16 <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0570200100:307"/>
                  <hi>February,</hi> 1586, to Sir <hi>William Stanley</hi>; adviſing him to
retain the Town of <hi>Deventer</hi> for her Majeſty's Uſe,
not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Contentions between him, and <hi>Taxis</hi> for the
Government, or the Expectation of great Forces from the Prince to remove him;
as what will no doubt recover his Credit, Pardon, and her Majeſty's Favour:
And offers himſelf to be employ'd into <hi>England</hi> to further this
Service. The next Paper is <hi>a Liſt of all the Soldiers and Munition in the
Caſtle of</hi> Rusſhen <hi>and</hi> Caſtle Peele <hi>in the Iſle
of</hi> Man, directed to the Earle of <hi>Derby,</hi> with a Note at the Bottom
of all the Proviſions wanting there, which it is hoped his Lordſhip will
ſpeedily ſupply: And to this is joyned <hi>the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of all ſort of
ſerviceable Men within the ſaid Iſland.</hi> Here it appears, the Number
of Horſemen were 41, Calli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-men 18, Bow-men 286, and Bill-men 357; but all
much unprovided with Weapons and other Furniture, as appears by a Note of their
Wants, at bottom; ſigned by <hi>R. Sherburne, H. Scarisbricke, W. Lucas, T.
Burſcoghe,</hi> and <hi>H. Radclyff.</hi> The next, is, <hi>A particular
Valuation of</hi> Gud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſden Demain; where it appears that the Sum total of
Acres is 352, and the total Value <hi>per Annum</hi> 113 <hi>l.</hi>
14<hi>s.</hi> 5 <hi>d.</hi> To this is joined, a Particular alſo of <hi>St.
Leonard's Rents</hi>; being 33 Shillings. Then follows a ſtrange Account of
Madam <hi>St. Marcian</hi>'s Viſion, on <hi>April</hi> 18, 1587, being
<hi>Shrove-Tueſday,</hi> of three Ladies, with Hawks on their Hands, hawking
as it were at Sheep in the Meadow before her; but being ſent to, the
Meſſenger cou'd ſee nothing. The Lady with other of her Company ſtill
ſeeing them from her Chamber, ſent again, but no body appeared: She,
ſtill ſeeing them, and fearing ſome Violence, ſent a number of Men with
Arms, charging them to fire at whatever they ſaw; they found at laſt a Cow,
but that vaniſhed from them; at which inſtant Madam <hi>St. Marcian</hi>
and her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany ſaw the three Ladies with their Hawks, Sheep, Cow,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> all throw themſelves headlong, with great noiſe into the
River, out of which a Flock of Swallows mounted into the Air: At the ſame
inſtant alſo, the Mayor of <hi>Saints in Xanctoign</hi> coming through a
Meadow near the Town, ſaw three fair Ladies kneeling and eating of Graſs;
of whom taking pity, he invited them to better Fare, but they made him
reproachful Anſwers; yet he invited them again afterwards by his Servant,
whom they alſo anſwered dtſdainfully, wiſhing him to be gone, ſaying,
<hi>we are Three whoſe Names are Death, Famine, and Peſtilence.</hi>

<hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and Juſtice of the Peace, to the Keeper of
<hi>Cheſter</hi> Goal, to receive and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain therein the Body of
<hi>Randulph Northburie,</hi> Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, for very heinous and ſlanderous
Words ſpoken againſt <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>; dated at
<hi>Lyme</hi> in <hi>Handley,</hi> 26 <hi>April,</hi> 1587. And next we have
<hi>the Charge that is given to the Queſte of Howſehoulde, as well at the
Caſtle, as at the Peele,</hi> (in the Iſle of <hi>Man</hi>) with particular
Inſtructions to the Officers there; in one Sheet. After this we have <hi>an
Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs from Cambridge</hi> to the Lord Treaſurer <hi>Burghley,</hi>
Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor of that Univerſity, to rectify ſome Grievances there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
mentioned; ſigned by nineteen Perſons, among whom are <hi>John Bentley,
John Weſton, Rob. Ruſſel, Will. Gager, Jo. Holland, Leonard Hutton, John
King, Tho. Crane, Rich. Thorneton,</hi> &amp;c. Then follows a Tranſcript of
ſome <hi>Letters</hi>: The firſt of which is from the Earl of
<hi>Leyceſter</hi> to a Friend, concerning ſome Perſons who had, as he
in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timates, wrongfully treated or repreſented him in his Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, of whom
he ſais: 
<q rend="inline">"Touching my Lord <hi>Buckhurſt, Norris,</hi>
and <hi>Wilkes,</hi> I doubt not but her Majeſty and my Lords do
ſufficiently underſtand of their Doings by this: For dealing with
<hi>Wilkes,</hi> to have his Reſolution I deſire it not, nor like not to
deal with ſo ungrateful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful Wretches; let him and they do their
worſte; they ſhall be found as they are, and I as I am, I truſt. The
Bruits touching <hi>Sluce,</hi> if they be ill, and believed againſt me I
have the more Wrong; I will never write three Lines to ſatisfie ſuch
Perſons; I know I have done as much as any lyving in my Place, and it
ſufficeth me that I know it to be ſo: I am ſorry my Friends ſhould be
troubled to excuſe me, when in Conſcience I have done all that became me. I
have deſerved better of my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen's Hands than lightly to believe of me:
But they ſhall ſeke another hereafter to deal as I have dealt for them, if
they reward me ſo, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Dated from <hi>Dorte,</hi> 22
<hi>Auguſt,</hi> 1587."</q> The next is a Letter to the Earl of
<hi>Derby,</hi> ſigned by the Vicar of <hi>Great Marlow</hi> in
<hi>Buckingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> whoſe Name was <hi>Thomas Browne,</hi> and the
Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> teſtifying, That, <hi>Jane Boulde,</hi>
(Wife of <hi>Richard Boulde</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr>) who was reported to have
abſented herſelf from the Church, and not to uſe the ſame accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to
the Injunctions thought meet, did frequent his Church, tho' it was two Miles

                  <hi>Harleford</hi>; and
ſhe had been out of order: Dated 12 <hi>April</hi> 1587. The next is a Letter
from <hi>Arthur Aty,</hi> to the Right Honourable Mr. <hi>John Wooley,</hi> of
her Majeſty's Privy Council; ſhewing what indifferent Opinion was held of
the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Aids in <hi>Holland,</hi> as if 
<q rend="inline">"her Majeſty had already agreed upon the
Conditions of Peace with the Duke of <hi>Parma,</hi> and that ſhe would
endeavour to enforce the <hi>States General</hi> thereunto, as he had heard
from Monſieur <hi>Averſons,</hi> Secretary to the ſaid States. And though
his Lord (<hi>Leiceſter</hi> we ſuppoſe) had travell'd much about to the
Towns, with great Diligence, inſtill'd the moſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Thoughts of her
Majeſty, and brought the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in good Terms, as well for Satisfaction of
thoſe who are miſled, as to encourage their treating with her Majeſty in

Peace, or <hi>England,</hi> or him, ſeek no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than to abaſe his
Credit, upon the ſurmiſed Grounds before written, and the earneſt
Preſſing of the ſaid Peace from <hi>England</hi>; which yet, he hopes,

his Lordſhip firſt took, to her Majeſty's good liking, tho' not in

<hi>Octob.</hi> 1587.</p>
               <p>After theſe Letters, we have the Anſwer of <hi>Chriſtopher
Sothworthe,</hi> Prieſt, (born in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> Son of Sir <hi>John
Sothworthe,</hi> and aged 31 Years) to ſeveral Articles againſt, and
Examinations of him; which Anſwer he made before Dr. <hi>White,</hi> Dr.
<hi>Beacon, Rich. Topclyff,</hi> and <hi>Rich. Yonge</hi>; whereby it appears,
that he being earneſtly required to conform himſelf in Religion according
to the Laws of her Majeſty, now eſtabliſhed, refuſed utterly, ſaying,

<q rend="inline">"He is taught that Doctrine and Religion at
<hi>Rome,</hi> wherein he will ſtand and hopeth to die."</q> Theſe
Anſwers contain three Pages. Then follows two Letters by the Earl of
<hi>Leiceſter</hi> to Mr. <hi>Woolley</hi> aforeſaid; both written from the
Low Countries. From the firſt, conſiſting of ſix Pages, we learn, That
Mr. <hi>Woolley</hi> had conveyed to her Majeſty his Lordſhip's
Replications to the Lord <hi>Buckhurſt,</hi> Sir <hi>John Norris,</hi> and
<hi>Wylkes</hi>; and that he had adviſed his Lordſhip not to be ſevere in
following Revenge, for her Majeſty hath them ſtill in her Diſpleaſure;
and they give it out that it is only for his Lordſhip's Cauſe. In this
Letter he fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declares, they have Friends to help them to execute their
foul Facts; and he, few to help to deliver him in his <pb n="281" facs="tcp:0570200100:310"/>
juſt Defence: And asks what he ſhould have been thought of if he had left
their Declaration unanſwered. That in what her Majeſty has ſpared them
for herſelf, they ought the more to acknowledge it, and what ſhe laid upon
them for his Sake, he is upon his Knees, with all Humbleneſs, to yield moſt
dutyful Thanks. As to his Succeſſor that is talked of, and whether he was
to be Governor General as his Lordſhip is, or only have the Government over
her Majeſty's People there, he thinks it will ſoon be reſolved; for that
the States have found ſuch a ſweet Taſte in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding as well Men as
Money, that they will hardly yield to any more Governors till they muſt by
force; therefore that it ſhou'd be ſeen his Lordſhip would be the laſt.
We are here informed alſo, of the Diſpute his Lordſhip had with the
States, about the Payment of the 5000 Men he carried over with him. Alſo
concerning <hi>Sluce</hi> Haven, what he has written about it, and Mr.
<hi>Beal</hi> is to deliver. And that nothing can be done but by Count
<hi>Maurice,</hi> of whoſe bad Dealing her Majeſty doth know. That the Talk
of Peace holds all Things in ſuſpence: That it is greatly preſs'd by
ſome, to make it conceived, that it will be better for themſelves to deal
by themſelves, than to join with her Majeſty; and herein doth
<hi>Maurice</hi> and <hi>Hollock</hi> join and practice for life againſt her,
as they have done ever ſince his Lordſhip came over; and that he ſhall
hazard ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what to impeach their Doings, as he intends. And a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
further: 
<q rend="inline">"What a Tyme of Faction I have ſuffered! and now
more than ever; for that the Aſſurance of Peace dothe drawe many from me
and my Authoritie, and ſo falleth it out every Day more manifeſte than
other. I am here withoute eyther Nobleman, Officer, or Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor.
<hi>Killigrewe</hi> I am fayne to leave at <hi>Hage,</hi> where the Councel
are; my ſelf, for her Majeſties Service, to wander upp and downe, bothe in
daylie Danger of my Lyffe, and yet withoute ſo doing ſhoulde not be able to
ſtaye Men's Mindes as they ought to bee. And if her Majeſties Letter had
bene delivered to the <hi>States</hi> that <hi>Atye</hi> broughte, never Man
had receyved ſo undeſerved a Shame as I had, and utterlie diſhonoured her
own Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing withall. Such Comfort I am ſubject unto! And all this while not
one Perſon ſent over to confirm my Doings, which were meet ſo to bee; nor
to expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to theſe Men as it had bene convenience, in ſo dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous
a Tyme as this ys, for yt ys not the haſte of Peace, <pb n="282" facs="tcp:0570200100:311"/>
nor the Shewes of yt that will bring ſuch a Peace as ſhould bee,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi>"</q> This Letter is ſigned with the Earl's Name, and dated 3
of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1587. The next Letter by the ſaid Earl to the ſame
Perſon, informs us, That this Peace in hand begins to make great War in
thoſe Parts, for that none wou'd hear of it but ſuch as wholly depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on
her Majeſty. And here he further expreſſes his Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs under his
Charge, thus, 
<q rend="inline">"I aſſure you my Lyffe was never weariſome
to me till nowe: I woulde my Eſtate here were eyther felte, hearde, or
underſtood; I knowe, of ſo many profeſſed Friendes as I have, I ſhall
finde ſome woulde ſeeke to releyve yt."</q> And further, that he was near
<hi>Horne</hi> in <hi>North Holland,</hi> and means to ſtay a few Days
thereabouts; deſires to be excuſed to the Lords, for that all his
Secretaries are employ'd abroad; hopes to hear from him ſpeedily the
bleſſed Sound of Retreat; that he is diſpatching the Soldiers as faſt
home as he can; that he truſts the Lords will conſider how little Cauſe
he has to ſtay there any longer, except, now he has worne out all his
Company, they intend he ſhall weare out himſelf. So ends, in haſte, the 9
of <hi>Octob.</hi> 1587.</p>
               <p>Then follow ſome more private Accounts, relating chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the
Eſtates, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> as we gather by
Circumſtances; beginning with <hi>a Note of the Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of my Lord's
Stand at</hi> Pilkington: This is an Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Goods or Furniture in
the Apartments there. The next Paper is <hi>an Account of Wood ſold</hi>; in
this Method. The firſt Column contains the Names of the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;
the next, the Names of the Woods; the next, the Year when ſold, and the
Valuation; next, the Earneſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and laſtly, Earneſt Money received.
Theſe Woods were named <hi>Stretlie, Gorynge, Burciter, Middleton</hi> and
<hi>Arn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot; Whichford, Ardington, Brackley, Gadeſden</hi> and
<hi>Wyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nington:</hi> And the Sales were made between the 25 and 28th Years of
the Queen's Reign. To this is added, a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate Paper of the <hi>Earneſt
of my Lord's Woods</hi> for thoſe Years, the Sum total whereof is 108
<hi>l.</hi> 9 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> To this is alſo join'd, <hi>an
Account of the riding Charges allowed by the Auditors to the Commiſſioners,
for ſale of the ſad Woods</hi> in thoſe three Years. And this is followed
with <hi>Orders ſet down by my Lord, for Earneſt Money due unto his
Lordſhip for the Sale of Woods.</hi> Theſe Orders are agreed to by the
Commiſſioners aforeſaid, whoſe Names are <hi>Tho. Harte, Edw. Clarke,
Jam. Kenwicke</hi> and <hi>Edw. Gunne:</hi> And the <pb n="283" facs="tcp:0570200100:312"/>
Agreement is witneſſed, amongſt others, by <hi>Edward Rigby,</hi> Gent.
who is expreſſed in the next Page to be a Receiver for the Earl of
<hi>Derby</hi> in the ſouthern Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and whoſe
Receipts we have here audited in the 28th of the ſaid Queen's Reign; at the
End of which Account is mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Sale of the aboveſaid Woods in this
laſt mention'd Year, for upwards of 1200 <hi>l.</hi> Then follows a ſhort
Bill of ſome yearly Payments. The next Paper is called <hi>a Note what
Lybertie Mr.</hi> Butler <hi>of</hi> Bewſey <hi>
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr> had by
Vertue of the Conveyance paſſed between the Earl of</hi> Leyceſter
<hi>and him, to lymmit and appointe to his Wieffe or Wyves.</hi> The next is
entitled, <hi>Rygate in Com.</hi> Surrey; and contains the Particulars of three
Woods, that is, <hi>Erle</hi>'s Wood, deſcribed to be well ſet with great
Oaks and Beeches, containing 240 Acres, valued at 3000 <hi>l. Petrydge</hi>
Wood, containing 30 Acres, valued at 207 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4
<hi>d.</hi> and <hi>Raye</hi> Wood, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining 16 Acres, valued at 50
<hi>l.</hi> The next Memorial ſeems to be a very curious and particular
Account of <hi>the whole yearly Revenue of the Kingdom of</hi> Spain: Firſt,
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning with the Revenues of all the <hi>States</hi> belonging to that
Crown: The Mines; Cuſtoms of them, and of the <hi>Slaves</hi>; amounting to
above ten Millions, four Hundred Thouſand Duckets. Next, of the King's yearly
Penſion from the five Orders of <hi>Knighthood,</hi> and his Profits upon
beſtowing the <hi>Encomendas</hi> belonging to three of them; with the
particular Names, Number, and Value thereof; where it appears, the whole Order
of St. <hi>James</hi> amounts to 385915 Duckets: The whole Order of
<hi>Calatrava</hi> to 254450 Duckets, including that of <hi>Monteza</hi>: The
whole Order of <hi>Alcantara</hi> to 171300 Duckets: Beſides the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of
St. <hi>John,</hi> at this time divided between Don <hi>Antonio de Toledo,</hi>
and the baſe Son of the Duke of <hi>Alva.</hi> Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that out of the
Rents of the three Orders of <hi>Encomen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> that King receives, as Great
Maſter, for his Part year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, two Hundred and ſeventy Thouſand Duckets.
Then follows an Account of the yearly Charges which that King is at, amounting
to above ſeven Millions of Duckets; which compared with his Receipts leaves
him above two Millions eight hundred Thouſand clear.</p>
               <p>Next, we come to a few Papers of more private or par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
Concern again, as a <hi>Remonſrance to the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celler</hi> Hatton,
<hi>and Lord Treaſurer</hi> Burghley, with the reſt of the Council
aſſembled in the Court of Star-Chamber, againſt <hi>John Crapnell,</hi>
who was to have a Cauſe heard in this <pb n="284" facs="tcp:0570200100:313"/> Court; being a
violent Invective againſt him; perſuading, that he is, and has been, a
Rogue in all manner of Lights or Practices: But we here want the Concluſion
of it. After this we have an <hi>Eſtimate of the Livings of</hi> John
Salusburie of Lleweny, <hi>
                     <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
                  </hi> in Poſſeſſion and
Reverſion. And the next is a very odd Story; entitled, <hi>The Confeſſion
of</hi> Edw. Burnell: 'Tis compriſed in ſix Pages, and the Subſtance of
it is this; This Mr. <hi>Burnell,</hi> as appears by his own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, had
met with hard Uſage in the <hi>Court of Wards and Liveries</hi>; was turn'd
out of ſome Poſſeſſions; and had brought his Adverſaries into the
<hi>Star-Chamber</hi> for Perjury and Forgery: But here, the Equity of his
Cauſe not being heard; he thought he had a right to ſay, her Majeſty
want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>faithful Hearts,</hi> to ſee, according to her Diſpoſition,
Juſtice executed. Hereupon he prepares a <hi>New-Year's Gift</hi> for her
Majeſty, which was a <hi>Latin</hi> Oration; but he was taken up and examined
before Sir <hi>George Carey</hi> and <hi>Ralph Lane</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> the
very Day, yet ſo early as two o'clock in the Morning, that he was to have
made his ſaid Speech, which was <hi>January</hi> 1, 1586. This Examination we
have here, with that alſo of Mr. <hi>Burnell</hi>'s Servant, <hi>John
Cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright;</hi> and therein it appears, when they demanded what his
<hi>New-Yea's Gift</hi> was to be, he anſwer'd, he had it about him; ſo
opening his Doublet, he ſhewed his naked Breaſt, and ſaid, that after
declaring to her Majeſty his good Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards her by the Oration he had
made in <hi>Latin,</hi> he would have ripped his Body as far as he cou'd, and
his Breaſt, ſo far as he might, without Danger of Death, to have ſhewn
her Majeſty his Heart. They demanded, whom he acquainted with this Device? He
anſwered; he had adviſed with <hi>Paul Warren</hi> and one <hi>Gyles,</hi>
two Surgeons; had asked them, whether a Man being ripped down the Body might
not yet live? They anſwer'd, hardly; but upon his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuning
<hi>Warren,</hi> who was his Relation, he promiſed, if he continued
reſolute, that he wou'd meet him at <hi>Greenwich</hi> (where the Court lay)
this Morning. Being required to ſet down the Oration he meant to have
pronounced; alſo to give them an Account of what Places and Company he had
been in for eight Days before: He anſwered, by writing the ſaid Oration
down, which we have here, in half a Page; with the Cauſes that moved him to
give this Gift; alſo the Particulars where, and with whom he had been,
ſince <hi>Chriſtmas</hi> Day laſt. And thus much for Mr.
<hi>Burnell</hi>'s <hi>New-Year's Gift.</hi>

               <p>
                  <pb n="285" facs="tcp:0570200100:314"/>This is followed with a Note of the
<hi>Mannor of Wyming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton in Com. Bedford,</hi> the Rents and Parcels thereof,
as they have been letten before the Leaſe made to Mr. <hi>Edw. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley</hi> by
the Earl of <hi>Derby.</hi> A like Note we have here alſo of <hi>Preſcot
Rectory,</hi> both as to the old Rents, and an Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the thirteen
ſeveral Tithes demiſed thereunto: Where it appears that the Sum total of
the Value was then, in <hi>January</hi> 1586, near 500 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi>
The next Piece is entitled, <hi>The Manner of the Execution of the Queen
of</hi> Scotts, <hi>the</hi> 8 <hi>of</hi> Feb. <hi>in the Preſence of ſuch
whoſe Names are underwritten.</hi> This takes up two Sides, and leads us in
the next Leaf to the <hi>Accounts of Sir</hi> Richard Shirburne, of Moneys
receiv'd and paid by Warrant from the Earl of <hi>Derby,</hi> to <hi>Henry
Stanley</hi> of <hi>Crosſhall</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Muſter-Maſter, for
buying Arms for the train'd Soldiers in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and repairing of
Beacons there. The next is entitled, <hi>Fees al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed yearly to the Earl
of</hi> Derby, as Forreſter of <hi>Bleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall,</hi> &amp;c. Another of
<hi>Moneys received by Sir</hi> John Byron, and paid to <hi>Henry Stanley</hi>
and others, as before, by the Earl of <hi>Derby's</hi> Warrant. A Note of
<hi>the Number of Loads of Hay</hi> gotten to <hi>Lathome</hi> this Year, 1589;
which were 228 Loads. The next is <hi>a Letter from the</hi> Engliſh
<hi>Ambaſſador at</hi> Paris <hi>to a Privy Counſellor,</hi> commending
the good Offices and Qualities of his Nephew there; and informing him that the
King will receive the <hi>Order</hi> on <hi>Thurſday</hi> next, with as great
Honour and ſhow of Good-will as is poſſible. The next Leaf contains
<hi>an approved Medicine for the Stone</hi>; which is, in a Gallon of new Milk,
to steep, Pellitory of the Wall, wild Thyme, Saxifrage, Parſly, each a
handful, with two or three Radiſh Roots ſliced, one Night; then diſtill
it all over a moderate Fire: So drink, ſix Spoonfuls of the Water, with as
many of Rheniſh Wine, adding a little Sugar and Nutmeg, lukewarm, faſting;
and eat no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing three Hours after: It ſhould be drank, the firſt Week,
three times together, and every Week after, but twice; for it forceth very much
Urine. If no great Pain is felt in the Kidneys, 'tis better to drink it but
once every eight Days three Mornings together. Next, after a Note of the
<hi>Bedding in the Lodge at</hi> Pilkinton (a Seat of the Lord
<hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by</hi>'s aforeſaid) we have Copies of two Letters in
<hi>French</hi>; the one called, <hi>Reſponce de la Royne a la Harangue de

the Tranſlations of both into <hi>Engliſh</hi> being tranſcrib'd at the
beginning of this Volumne, as we have before obſerved. The next is a
<hi>Latin</hi> Letter, dated from <hi>Rome</hi> 10 <hi>May,</hi> 1586.
beginning with an Exclamation againſt Sir <hi>Francis Drake</hi> as a Pirate:
And next to this, is inſerted a <hi>Latin Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſy now apply'd to Sir</hi>

4th, To have the <hi>Charge</hi> of twelve hundred Men. 5th, and laſtly, is

Ralegh</hi>'s being the Author of it, we are referr'd to good Authority, by a
marginal Note, in the Leaf where it is written. There are three or four little
Memorials more in the Volume, of which we need only mention, firſt, a

               <p>THE <hi>Title</hi> of this approved Work, is in a graved
Frontiſpiece, which contains Emblematical Repreſentations (as was uſual
in theſe Times) of <hi>Fame</hi> crowning the Pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trait of
<hi>Leiceſterſhire,</hi> and <hi>Truth</hi> crowning that of Antiquity;
with the <hi>Sun,</hi> in a Compartment between them, in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe, and this
Motto, <hi>Relucera</hi>; over a Cave, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of which is cover'd with a
Curtain, upon which the ſaid <hi>Title</hi> is inſcribed; and at the Bottom
a Proſpect of our Author's Seat, named <hi>Lindley.</hi> In another Leaf,
facing that Frontiſpiece, we have the Author's Effigies in his Lawyer's Gown;
<hi>Aetat.</hi> 47. 1622. his Arms at the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; and for an Emblem at
bottom, the <hi>Sun,</hi> with this Motto, <hi>Relumbre:</hi> Both graved by
<hi>Franciſco Delaram.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He dedicates the Book to <hi>George Villers,</hi> Marqueſſe
and Earl of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> Lord High Admiral, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He being a
Native of that County, and none having the like Power to defend his Work
againſt the Adverſaries of Truth. In the Preface he apologizes for applying
himſelf to Studies beſide his Profeſſion, by intimating that if the Law
ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted <pb n="288" facs="tcp:0570200100:317"/> any Partner, the moſt neceſſary would be
this Study of Antiquities: And that his Conſtitution being weak, it
diſabled him from following the Practice which his Calling required; which
obliging him to the Retirement of a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try Life, and depriving him of thoſe
Helps the City wou'd have afforded, muſt render his Diſcourſe leſs
equal to the Worthineſs of the Subject; yet rather than his Country ſhould
longer lie obſcur'd in Darkneſs, he adventures to reſtore her to her
Worth and Dignity, animated by the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the never enough admir'd
Antiquary <hi>W. Camden,</hi> and that induſtrious and well deſerving
Maſter <hi>John Speede,</hi> who in his elaborate Hiſtory of
<hi>England</hi> has well ſpoken of all the Shires, and by his great Travail
and Expences ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Maps of each Shire, with the Plot of every City and
great Town therein inſerted, never before performed by any: Alſo by the
grave and ſage Lawyer <hi>W. Lambert,</hi> who from the Depth of Antiquity
has reſtored the County of <hi>Kent.</hi> Alſo the eloquent and noble
Gentleman <hi>Richard Carew</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> who very worthily has
ſurveyed all <hi>Cornwall</hi>; and that excellent Surveyor <hi>John
Norden</hi> Gentleman, who has briefly deſcribed the Counties of
<hi>Middleſex</hi> and <hi>Hertford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi>; and ſince has made
certain chorographical Tables of ſome Weſtern Shires, and a fine
Proſpective of the City of <hi>London.</hi> He alſo acknowledges the
Encouragments he had from ſome of his Friends, as <hi>John Beaumont</hi> of
<hi>Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dieu</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr> and that expert Genealogiſt, his
Kinſman, Mr. <hi>Auguſtine Vincent, Rouge-Croix,</hi> who imparted many
worthy Notes to him from the Tower; and whoſe Labours in this kind for the
County of <hi>Northampton,</hi> wou'd ere long come to light. Further, that in
this Deſcription he has run through, in every Town, thoſe four Sections
above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd in the Title-Page. As for the <hi>Topography</hi> of the
County, he rectified ſome Years paſt <hi>Chriſt. Saxton's</hi> Map
thereof, with an addition of 80 Towns; which was graved at
<hi>Amſterdam,</hi> by <hi>Jodocus Hondius,</hi> 1602, (and ſince imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated
by <hi>Speede,</hi> with an Augmentation of the Plot of <hi>Leiceſter</hi>)
and reduced into a leſſer Form, is here inſerted. Of the more eminent
<hi>Places</hi> he has ſpoken ſomething throughout; and where any
<hi>natural</hi> Paſſage offer'd, he has not thought it impertinent to
ſatisfy the Reader a little in this kind; alſo adorn'd it with ſome
hiſtorical Digreſſions, which have dependance upon the Work; has
obſerv'd, as near as he cou'd, when Monaſteries, Churches, noble Seats, and
other <hi>memorable Buildings</hi> were founded; alſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed 
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0570200100:318"/> the <hi>Deſcent</hi> of <hi>Titles</hi> to
<hi>Lands,</hi> whether by Heirs or Grants; that the Antiquity of Continuance
in a Name might be diſcover'd, and the antient Owner known; not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to
derogate from any Man's Right, or move Doubts or Queſtions thereunto. But in
ſetting down of <hi>Tenures</hi> he has been very ſparing: The
<hi>Soccage</hi> Tenure he has expreſs'd; but no Certainty of any other,
unwilling to give any Cauſe of Offence, as knowing there are more Differences
and ſtrange Proceedings in theſe Buſineſſes than in any one Thing of
ſo common a Nature; tho' they might be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified if the trueſt and moſt
probable Records and Evidences were accepted. As for the <hi>Law Caſes</hi>
which have latterly happen'd in the Shire, he has briefly remember'd them.
Touching the <hi>Genealogies</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> of the Gentry he only
ſpeaks of the Ancient, whoſe Families are extinct, leſt not contenting
the Living, he ſhould be queſtion'd without Cauſe; yet has in this
reſpect remember'd ſome few of his Friends. In Church-Matters he has
follow'd an old Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, compil'd <hi>Anno.</hi> 1220,<note n="*" place="bottom">There is a Tranſcript of it above 300 Years old in the
<hi>Cotton Library.</hi>
                  </note> wherein is diſcover'd what Churches were
Rectories, what, Appropriate: If Rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, who was Patron, who Incumbent;
what Chapels belong'd to them, and how to be ſerved: If Appropriate, to what
Monaſtery, or religious Houſe belonging, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Has further added
from the Records in the Office of the Auditors of the Impreſt, their Value in
the King's Books; and ſhewn, who are the preſent Patrons of every Church.
The <hi>Roman</hi> Antiquities and others he has briefly touch'd as far as came
to his Knowledge. And laſtly, has added all the <hi>Arms</hi> in all the
<hi>Church-Windows</hi> in the Shire; and the <hi>Inſcriptions</hi> of the
<hi>Tombs</hi>; which he took by his own View and Travel; for that they may
correct many Errors in Armory or Genealogy, and end many Differences in Law;
the Evidence of a Church-Window having been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted by a Jury at an
Aſſizes. Has alſo added the Names to moſt of the Coats; not following
herein the conceited Blazonry of <hi>Gerard Leigh,</hi> or others of later
Times; but uſed ſuch Terms as himſelf was beſt acquainted with, and
might beſt ſerve for any one's underſtanding. Thus we have the whole
Scope of his Intention, or a general View of the Topicks, not only treated of
in this Book, but to be treated of in Books of the like nature.</p>

                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:0570200100:319"/>After the Preface, whereof we have here
given the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, we have <hi>Saxton</hi>'s Map, therein ſpoken of,
graved by <hi>William Kip.</hi> Then we enter upon a general Deſcription of
the County, wherein 'tis obſerved, from <hi>Mercator,</hi> to be in the
Latitude of 54 Degrees, and in the Longitude of 20. It borders, on the Eaſt,
upon <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> and <hi>Rutlandſire</hi>; on the Weſt, upon

<hi>Watling-Street</hi>; on the North upon <hi>Nottinghamſhire</hi> and

Names of ancient Buildings, as Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, Abbeys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
Market-Towns, Rivers, Parks, Forreſts, Civil and Eccleſiaſtical
Government; and hence we are led to a particular Diſcription of the County,

<hi>Leland</hi>'s Book, <hi>de Scriptoribus illuſtribus Angliae.</hi> Alſo
ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, that thro' the Liberty granted to <hi>Leland</hi> of uſing what
Manuſcripts he pleaſed in any of the religious Houſes, he collected many
Things together in divers Books,

In <hi>Sapcot,</hi> we are informed what the Qualification or Income of the

Our Author having touched upon the Cauſe of this Diſtemper refers to a

founded at <hi>Oxford</hi>; but in the ſpace of an Age it was pillaged of
thoſe excellent Manuſcripts, till Duke <hi>Humphrey</hi> repair'd it again:
But in the hot zealous Times of the Reformation this Treaſure was alſo
embezled, till of late, thro' the Bounty of Sir <hi>T. Bodley</hi> and his

               <p>Thus we end our brief Recapitulation of this Book; not without
ſome wonder to obſerve, that after near ſixſcore Years ſince this
Author thus broke through thoſe Clouds of Darkneſs and Oblivion, wherewith
the Luſtre of this County had been overſhadowed, ſo few others ſhould
ſee the way to imitate his Example, by their further Illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
thereof: Inſomuch that we know not of any one County in <hi>England,</hi>
which in that compaſs of Years has had fewer Publications beſtowed upon it
relating either to its <hi>Antiquities,</hi> or <hi>natural Hiſtory.</hi> Nay
even our Author's own improved Copy of this Work, very much enriched with
<hi>Roman, Saxon,</hi> and other Antiquities, has, to this day, been deny'd the
Light. Wherefore we thought it a Debt due to his Merit, as well as to the
Subject he has celebrated, to take the Notice we have here done of them, in
order to excite thoſe whom it may concern, to oblige the Publick either with
that enlarged Work of this Author, with further Continuations thereof, or any
other ſuch Memorials of the Place and its Products, as may render them, with
what Juſtice they deſerve, no leſs conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable than other Counties,

               <p>THIS approved Book is well known to be the Work of <hi>Richard
Verſtegan,</hi> a ſecular Prieſt, who has printed his Name at the End of
his Dedication thereof to King <hi>James</hi>; for this is at leaſt the third
Edition, publiſhed here at <hi>London</hi> ſoon after the Author's Death;
the firſt, which he printed himſelf at <hi>Antwerp,</hi> being in the Year
1605. The Author was skilful in Drawing and Limning; and has em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belliſh'd his
Work with ſeveral Draughts, which are neatly graved, and have not a little
advantaged the Sale of the <pb n="300" facs="tcp:0570200100:329"/> Work; inſomuch that there
have ſince been two Editions more of it in <hi>Octavo,</hi> but the
Impreſſion of the Cuts are therein worn faint, and not ſo valuable as
thoſe in the firſt Quarto Editions.</p>
               <p>The Author, in his Epiſtle to the noble and renowned
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation, among other Motives for his Undertaking, intimates,
his finding our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Writers to ſtand ſo much upon the
Deſcent of the <hi>Britains</hi> to be one; as if it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the Original
and Honour of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Nation; whereby and through the want of
due Diſtinction between the two Nations (an Overſight which the
<hi>Britains</hi> in their Account of us will never commit) our true Original
and honourable Antiquity lie involv'd and obſcur'd, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus
<hi>John Boden</hi> wou'd make us believe, it is in <hi>Caeſar</hi>'s
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries to be found, That the <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> of his Time had but
one Woman to ſerve for ten or twelve Men: Whereas <hi>Caeſar</hi> never
heard the Name of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> who came not into <hi>Britain</hi>
near 500 Years after his Death. And thus, not to let ſlip the Opportunity of
a Laſh at Mr. <hi>Fox,</hi> he is cenſur'd for beginning his <hi>Acts</hi>
and <hi>Monuments,</hi> with ſaying that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> was the Son
of <hi>Helen</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Woman: Thus another entitles his
Dictionary, which is in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh, Theſaurus Linguae
Romanae et Britannicae</hi>; which wou'd have been proper enough had it been
written in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Welſh.</hi> Having reflected on the
Confuſion which ſuch Indiſtinctions create, he ſhews that
<hi>Engliſhmen</hi> cannot but from the <hi>Saxons</hi> derive their
Deſcent and Off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring, and can lack no Honour in deſcending from ſuch
an honourable Race, as this Work will ſpecify; which our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor was induced
to publiſh for his love to this noble Nation, moſt dear to him, becauſe
it was his Birth-place, tho' his Grandfather (who was driven into
<hi>England</hi> by Wars and loſs of Friends) was born in <hi>Geldres.</hi>
Towards the Concluſion of this Epiſtle he informs us that if in his
Etymologies he dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers from ſome <hi>Germans,</hi> 'tis where he has found
them miſtaken by having look'd little further than the Language uſed among
themſelves, even like thoſe who have alſo written in the
<hi>Netherlands;</hi> whereas the underſtanding of the <hi>Teutonic</hi>
uſed by our <hi>Saxon</hi> Anceſtors, as alſo that of the ancient
<hi>Franks,</hi> is moſt requiſite; and thereunto the <hi>High, Low,</hi>
and <hi>Eaſterland Teutonic,</hi> with reſpect alſo to the dependant
<hi>Daniſh</hi> and <hi>Swediſh,</hi> beſides our modern vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar
<hi>Engliſh</hi>: 
<q rend="inline">"In all which, ſays he, I have beſtowed ſome

               <p>After ſeveral Copies of <hi>Latin</hi> Verſes by <hi>Richard

ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſes by <hi>Tho. Shelton, Fr. Tregian, A.
Greneway, Ralph Badclyfe,</hi> and the Author himſelf, we enter upon the
Work, which is divided into <hi>Ten</hi> Chapters. The Firſt is, <hi>Of the
Original of Nations, and conſequently that from which</hi> Engliſhmen
<hi>are deſcended.</hi> In this Chapter the Author diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, (after
ſhewing that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> are of <hi>German</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent,
heretofore called <hi>Saxons,</hi> and ſtill in the <hi>Britiſh,</hi> as
alſo the ancient <hi>Iriſh</hi> Tongue, ſo called) of the Original of
Nations from the Diviſion, after the Deluge, at the Tower of <hi>Babel</hi>;
and upon the numerous Increaſe of Poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, illuſtrated in the Example
of the Iſſue of one Perſon near our Author's Time, and that was a Woman
named <hi>Yoland Baillie,</hi> who died at <hi>Paris</hi> 1514, aged 88 Years,
and in the eighth Year of her Widowhood; by whoſe Epitaph in the Church-yard
of St. <hi>Innocents,</hi> it appears there were 295 Children iſſued from
herſelf while ſhe lived. Then we have an Account how the People after the
Flood inhabited the Mountains; how <hi>Nimrod</hi> took upon him the firſt
Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Particulars of the Tower of <hi>Babel,</hi> as to its width and
height, from <hi>Joſephus</hi> and <hi>Iſidore.</hi> Of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of
Tongues; whence the Original of Nations; whence the <hi>Hebrews</hi> were ſo
called. The Poſterity of <hi>Sem, Cham</hi> and <hi>Japhet.</hi> That the
People were not mixed by the Confuſion of Tongues. Concerning the Inhabitants
of the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> we are referr'd to <hi>Auguſtine Carate</hi>'s
Hiſtory of thoſe Parts. How the <hi>Dutch</hi> are deſcended from
<hi>Tuiſco.</hi> Whence ſome Days of the Week are derived. That the
<hi>Germans</hi> were the firſt and only Poſſeſſors of their Country.
Touching their Name of <hi>Germans</hi> and <hi>Almans</hi>; with their divers
other Names. A Remark upon <hi>Leland</hi>'s aſſerting that the
<hi>Cimbri</hi> and <hi>Sicambri</hi> received their Names of <hi>Cambria</hi>
the Daughter of <hi>Belinus</hi> King of <hi>Britain.</hi> Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of the
Names of the <hi>Freiſlanders, Swevians, Goths, Danes, Normans, Vandals,
Longobards,</hi> and <hi>Saxons,</hi> who were ſo called from the crooked
Weapons they wore like a Scithe, ſtill called in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> a
<hi>Saiſen.</hi> The watch Word <hi>Nem eowr Seaxes.</hi> Examples of other
People re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving their Denomination from their Weapons, as the
<hi>Scythians</hi> from Shooting, the <hi>Galliglaſſes</hi> from their
<hi>Pole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>axes,</hi> 
                  <pb n="302" facs="tcp:0570200100:331"/> as others anciently from the Clothes
and Gowns they wore. And theſe are the chief Contents of this Chapter.</p>
               <p>The ſecond Chapter ſhews <hi>how the ancient noble</hi>
Saxons, <hi>the true Anceſtors of</hi> Engliſhmen, <hi>were originally a
People of</hi> Germany. And here he aſſerts, That all our Writers agree the
<hi>Engliſhmen</hi> came from <hi>Germany.</hi> That all had their Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning
in <hi>Aſia.</hi> That the Affinity between the <hi>German</hi> and
<hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Language, affirmed by ſome, extended not to half a
ſcore Words, as our Author was inform'd from the beſt Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the
Train of Sir <hi>Ant. Sherley</hi> and <hi>Cuchin Ollibeag,</hi>
Ambaſſadors from <hi>Perſia,</hi> in <hi>Italy, Anno</hi> 1601. That the
<hi>Gauls</hi> and <hi>Germans</hi> were by the <hi>Grecians</hi> called
<hi>Celtae,</hi> from their frequent Riding. A Specimen of the
<hi>Perſian</hi> Tongue, into which the Beginning of the firſt Chapter of
<hi>Geneſis</hi> is here tranſlated. A fabulous Narration of <hi>Occa
Scarlenſis,</hi> concerning <hi>Friſo, Saxo,</hi> and <hi>Bruno,</hi> with
a Confutation thereof. That <hi>Brunſwick</hi> took its Name of
<hi>Bruno</hi> Son of <hi>Ludolph</hi> Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> who firſt
began to build it in the Year 861. This is followed with Arguments to prove
that our <hi>Saxon</hi> Anceſtors were originally of <hi>Germany,</hi> and
did not come from other Parts thither; with the Concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of
<hi>Lipſius.</hi> Obſervations that no Nations call one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as each
calls himſelf; and that the <hi>Germans</hi> who were the continu'd
Poſſeſſors of <hi>Germany,</hi> were never ſubdued; alſo unmixed
both in People and Language. That the <hi>French</hi> iſſued from the
<hi>Franks</hi> in <hi>Germany</hi>; to whom the ancient <hi>Gauls</hi> gave
place, much about the Time that the <hi>Saxons</hi> came thence into
<hi>Britain.</hi> That the <hi>Longobards</hi> or People of <hi>Lombardy,</hi>
and alſo the <hi>Normans</hi> iſſued from the <hi>Germans</hi>; as the
Nobility of <hi>Spain</hi> from the <hi>Goths.</hi> Then we have many ancient
Teſtimonies of the Worthineſs of the <hi>Germans;</hi> with a Deſcription
of the Country, as it was antiently; alſo the Vertues and Manners of the
Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: Arguments and Examples to prove, That it is not the Climate or
Temperature of the <hi>Air</hi> makes the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of any Country more or leſs
learned or ingenious. A Recital of ſundry rare <hi>Inventions,</hi> in Arts
and Sciences, which had their Original in <hi>Germany.</hi> Reflections upon
their national Vice of Drunkenneſs.</p>
               <p>The third Chapter deſcribes <hi>the antient Manner of living
among our</hi> Saxon <hi>Anceſtors: The Idols they adored while they were
Pagans; and how they grew to be of greateſt Name and Habitation of any other
People in</hi> Germany. Here our <pb n="303" facs="tcp:0570200100:332"/> ſaid Anceſtors are
very particularly deſcribed, as to their perſonal Appearance in Attire,
Arms, Exerciſe, the Orders or Degrees of People among them, their Cuſtom of
<hi>Gavel-kind, Give all kind,</hi> or give each Child his Share; the
nur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Children by their own Mothers; their counting of Time by the
Nights, as Se'nnights and Fortnights, and the Ages of their own Lives by
Winters. Their Computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Time they notched upon ſquare Sticks, called
<hi>Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-aght,</hi> or <hi>All moon heed,</hi> whence our <hi>Almanac.</hi>
Here we have the old <hi>Saxon</hi> Names of the twelve <hi>Months</hi> in the
Year, with their Explanations; which we now call by Names of <hi>French</hi>
and <hi>Latin</hi> Derivation. Next of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Government of
<hi>Saxony</hi>; the four ſorts of <hi>Ordeal,</hi> or Trial of Right, by
Combat, hot Iron, hot Water, and cold Water: But, not thought fit to be
continued among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, they were aboliſh'd by Pope <hi>Stephen.</hi>
Here we enter upon the Idolatry of the Pagan <hi>Saxons,</hi> and their
ſuperſtitious Cuſtoms for preſaging of Events. More particularly of
their Idols for the ſeven <hi>Days</hi> in the <hi>Week,</hi> which we have
here neatly repreſented in Sculpture; as firſt, the Idol of the
<hi>Sun,</hi> whence comes the Name of <hi>Sunday</hi>; next that of the
<hi>Moon,</hi> whence <hi>Monday</hi>; next the Idol of <hi>Thyſco,</hi>
whence <hi>Tueſday</hi>; next is their Idol <hi>Woden</hi> or God of Battle,
whence <hi>Wedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi>; the next is their Majeſtic <hi>Thor,</hi>
ſitting under a Throne with a Circle of Stars behind his Head, whence
<hi>Thurſday</hi>; the next is <hi>Friga,</hi> an Idol that repreſented
both <hi>Sexes,</hi> with a Sword in one Hand and Bow in the other; was reputed
the Giver of Peace and Plenty, the Cauſer of Love and Friendſhip, and from
the Day of her Adoration we yet retain the Name of <hi>Friday.</hi> The laſt
is the Idol of <hi>Seater,</hi> repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented ſtanding on the ſharp-finn'd
back of a Pearch, to ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify, the <hi>Saxons,</hi> for ſerying him,
ſhould paſs without Harm in dangerous Places; alſo holding a Wheel in his
left Hand, to betoken their Unity and Concurrence in one Courſe; and a Pail
full of Water, Flowers and Fruits in the right Hand, to denote that with kindly
Rain he wou'd nouriſh and diſpoſe the Earth to ſuch Productions. After
theſe, we have an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of two other <hi>Saxon</hi> Idols, as that named
<hi>Ermenſewl,</hi> or the Pillar of the Poor, which the <hi>Franks,</hi>
with other <hi>Germans,</hi> as well as the <hi>Saxons</hi> ador'd: And that
alſo named <hi>Flynt,</hi> from the Stone it ſtood on; beſides three or
four more, which are only named. And here we have our Author's Reaſons why
the <hi>Romans</hi> miſtook the <hi>German</hi> Idols to be derived from
their own, as <hi>Thor</hi> from <hi>Jupiter, Friga</hi> from <hi>Venus,</hi>
and <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0570200100:333"/> 
                  <hi>Seater</hi> from <hi>Saturn:</hi> Alſo his
Remarks on the horrible Exceſs of Idolatry their Votaries were arrived to, in
that <hi>Harold</hi> I. King of <hi>Norway</hi> ſacrificed two of his Sons to
his Idols, that they might grant ſuch a Tempeſt as would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſe and
confound the Fleet which <hi>Harold</hi> VI. King of <hi>Denmark</hi> was
preparing to ſend againſt him. Further, that in <hi>Britain</hi> none of
their Idols were in greater Requeſt than <hi>Woden,</hi> as by ſeveral
Places in <hi>Kent, Staffordſhire,</hi> and <hi>Wilt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire</hi> may appear,
which retain their Appellations from him. But theſe Idols were all
demoliſh'd by <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> the firſt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian <hi>Engliſh
Saxon</hi> King, and others of thoſe Kings in their ſeveral Territories.
Next we are inform'd how the <hi>Saxons</hi> extended their Bounds in
<hi>Germany</hi> beyond any other People there; and how they were tranſported
by <hi>Charles</hi> the Great into <hi>Tranſilvania</hi> and other Regions;
which introduces an incredible Story of a <hi>Tranſportation</hi> which
happen'd in <hi>Saxony</hi> not many Ages paſt. For there came into the Town
of <hi>Hamel</hi> in <hi>Brunſwick</hi> a Man, whom, partly from his patch'd
or motly-colour'd Coat, they called the <hi>Pied-piper,</hi> who having agreed
with them to rid their Town of Rats, wherewith it was much annoyed; he with his
Pipe drew all the ſaid Vermin after him into the River <hi>Weaſer,</hi>
where they were drown'd. But the Townſmen then ſwerving from their
Agreement, the diſcontented <hi>Piper</hi> gave them another Tune thro' the
Town again, but it was a revengeful one, drawing all the Children therein, to
the Number of 130, after him, till they came to a Hill, which opening on the
ſide, let them in, <hi>Piper</hi> and all, ſo cloſed up again, and they
were never more ſeen or heard of, to the great Lamentation of the Parents in
that Town. In memory whereof, it was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd, that no muſical Inſtrument
ſhould be ſounded in the Street which led to the Gate, through which they
paſs'd; that no Oſtery ſhould be there held; and that in the dating of
all publick Writings, the Year from the going forth of their Children, ſhould
be added to that of our Lord: Which they have accordingly ever ſince
continued, ſays our Author. And this great Wonder happen'd the 22d of
<hi>July,</hi> 1376.</p>
               <p>Chapter the fourth, <hi>Of the Iſle of</hi> Albion,
<hi>afterwards called</hi> Britain, <hi>and now</hi> England, Scotland,
<hi>and</hi> Wales: <hi>And how it ſhewed to be Continent or firm Land
with</hi> Gallia <hi>or</hi> France, <hi>ſince</hi> Noah'<hi>s Flood.</hi>
Here having ſhewn the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Opinions of the Derivation of the Word
<hi>Albion</hi> from the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin,</hi> and from the Name
of ſome chief Governor, he proceeds to diſplay the like variety of
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0570200100:334"/> touching the Name of <hi>Britain,</hi> from
Sir <hi>T. Eliot, Humphrey Lhuyd,</hi> and <hi>Becanus,</hi> not withholding
his own Opinion that the Iſland had the Name of <hi>Britain</hi> from
<hi>Brute</hi>; however many fabulous Circumſtances may have been by a few
obſcure Authors heretofore added to this Hiſtory, and ſo have made the
whole to be doubted of. Next he ſets forth the imagin'd Deſcents from the
<hi>Trojans</hi>; the Cauſe of which fond Conceits poſſeſſing ſo
many, he attributes to the want of Learning in former Ages, their
<hi>Druids</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves not having any Knowledge of Letters. Our Author
queſtions not only theſe Deſcents from the <hi>Trojans,</hi> but the
Hiſtory of <hi>Troy</hi> itſelf; ſhewing that Queen <hi>Dido</hi> never
knew <hi>Aeneas,</hi> who was dead a number of Years before ſhe was born; and
that <hi>Brute</hi> was more probably a <hi>Gauliſh</hi> Prince than a
<hi>Trojan.</hi> So proceeds to ſhew how this Iſland was anciently firm
Land with <hi>Gallia</hi>; naming ſeveral Authors of the ſame Opinion,
among whom are Sir <hi>Tho. More, John Twine,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Richard
White;</hi> alſo producing many Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments and Examples to maintain ſuch a
Conjunction, and that there was an <hi>Iſthmus</hi> which join'd our Iſland
at <hi>Dover</hi> to <hi>Calais,</hi> about ſix Miles wide, whereby the
Iſland was ſome time Peninſular. Here we have ſeveral Inſtances of
the Intruſions and Demolitions which have been made by the Waters; how divers
Steeples in the <hi>Netherlands</hi> do yet appear at Low Water of the Towns
and Villages that have been drowned. And that it is reaſonable to think
theſe flat and level Countries have been Sea; the great Evenneſs thereof
being ſo made by the Waters wherewith they have been cover'd. This is proved
by the Obſervations here made of the Shells and Bones of Sea-Fiſhes found
two Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms deep in theſe Plains diſtant from the Sea; and we have here a
Sculpture of ſome which our Author had ſeen. As for the <hi>Fir-Trees</hi>
found alſo buried in theſe <hi>Netherlands,</hi> with the Roots commonly
lying South-Weſt; as the Soil is not by nature apt to produce them, our
Author thinks they might be driven hither in the time of the Deluge. Anchors
are alſo obſerved to have been found deep in the Earth, and the Skeleton of
a Sea-Elephant in theſe Parts; whence it is concluded, that as theſe Parts
of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Brabant</hi> are of Sea become Land, and cannot by
any In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation become Sea again, it muſt be owing to the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the
<hi>German</hi> Ocean thro' that <hi>Iſthmus</hi> which joined
<hi>Albion</hi> to <hi>Gallia.</hi> An Argument that this Separation from the
Continent was ſince the Flood, is urged from the great <pb n="306" facs="tcp:0570200100:335"/>
Plenty of Wolves wherewith this Iſland was anciently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, which no
Man wou'd tranſport for the Goodneſs of the Breed out of the Continent into
any Iſland, no more than they will carry Foxes out of our Continent into the
Iſle of <hi>Wight.</hi> They are therefore preſumed to have paſſed over
of themſelves, and grew moſt numerous till by King <hi>Edgar</hi>'s Orders
they were deſtroy'd throughout the Realm, before whoſe time two
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings, <hi>Madan</hi> and <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pricius</hi> had been
killed by them.</p>
               <p>Chapter the Fifth. <hi>Of the Arrival of the</hi> SAXONS <hi>out
of</hi> Germany <hi>into</hi> BRITAIN, <hi>and how they received the
Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith; poſſeſſed the beſt Part of the Country, called
it</hi> England, <hi>and leaving the Name of</hi> Saxons, <hi>came generally to
be called</hi> Engliſhmen. Here, after a little Note upon <hi>Brute</hi>'s
Entrance into <hi>Albion,</hi> about 3000 Years after the Creation, and
dividing <hi>Britain</hi> between his three Sons, <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crine,</hi> who had
<hi>England; Albanact,</hi> who had <hi>Scotland</hi>; and <hi>Camber,</hi> who
had <hi>Wales;</hi> we have a ſhort Remark upon the Original of the
<hi>Scots,</hi> and another on the <hi>Picts,</hi> ſhewing they were not ſo
called from painting of their Bodies, but from their being ſuch notable
Fighters. Next we learn that the <hi>Britains</hi> were ſubject to the
<hi>Roman</hi> Government from <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> to <hi>Valentinian</hi>
the Third, that is, almoſt 500 Years; till relinquiſh'd by them, they
ſought Protection in the ſecond Year of King <hi>Vortiger</hi> againſt
the <hi>Scots</hi> and <hi>Picts</hi> of the <hi>Saxons,</hi> who then
<hi>Anno</hi> 447 arrived under <hi>Hingiſtus</hi> and <hi>Horſus</hi> in
three great Ships to the number of 9000, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to <hi>Pomarius</hi>: And
here we have a Sculpture repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting their landing on the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Coaſt, with thoſe who were the firſt
<hi>Engliſhmen</hi> in this Iſland; and particular Accounts we here have of
thoſe two Leaders, as to their Birth, Arms, Names, Building and Settlement in
<hi>Kent.</hi> Alſo an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Old England</hi> or <hi>Anglia,</hi>
whence they came, which was ſituate near <hi>Sleſwick,</hi> with the
Signification of <hi>Angle, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel,</hi> or <hi>England</hi>; and that it was
firſt cauſed to be ſo called by King <hi>Egbert:</hi> Alſo of the other
<hi>Saxons</hi> called <hi>Vites</hi> and <hi>Juites.</hi> The Signification of
<hi>Waſſail.</hi> The Creation of <hi>Hingiſt</hi> King of <hi>Kent.</hi>
The Arrival of a ſecond Supply of <hi>Saxon</hi> Forces. The Breach between
the <hi>Britains</hi> and <hi>Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</hi> The depoſing of
<hi>Vortiger,</hi> enthroning of his Son <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timer.</hi> The Slaughter of
<hi>Horſus</hi>; and Return of <hi>Hingiſt</hi> into <hi>Saxony</hi> for
more Forces. <hi>Vortiger</hi>'s Re-aſcenſion of the Throne, and Alienation
from the <hi>Saxons.</hi> The bloody Banquet on <hi>May</hi>-Day at
<hi>Salisbury</hi> Plain, in which 300 of <pb n="307" facs="tcp:0570200100:336"/> the
<hi>Britiſh</hi> Nobility, or more, were treacherouſly maſſacred by the
<hi>Saxons</hi> under <hi>Hingiſt,</hi> at the watch Word <hi>Nem eowr
Seaxes,</hi> or take your Seaxes, which was their Swords or crooked Daggers,
whence they derived their Name. The Donation of <hi>Kent,</hi> &amp;c. to
<hi>Hingiſt</hi> confirm'd; and he reigned thirty four Years. After the
miſerable Death of King <hi>Vor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiger,</hi> we have a Series or ſhort
Liſt of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Kings, and the Years of their Reign to the
Death of <hi>Cadwalladar,</hi> whoſe Reign ended 685, when began ſix
Kingdoms more of the <hi>Saxons</hi> in <hi>Britain</hi>: So that in all, with
that of <hi>Kent</hi> they made an <hi>Heptarchy</hi>; and they are here
diſtinguiſhed. Here alſo we have the Names of ſeveral Places in
<hi>Britain</hi> mention'd, which were changed by the <hi>Saxons,</hi>
particularly of <hi>London,</hi> that it was not ſo called by the
<hi>Britains</hi> from <hi>Luds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town</hi>; Town being no <hi>Britiſh,</hi>
but a <hi>Saxon</hi> Word: Beſides then <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> wou'd have
called it after that Name, but it was ſo called from the famous metropolitan
City of <hi>Lunden</hi> in <hi>Sconia,</hi> ſome time of greateſt Traffic
in all the Eaſt Parts of <hi>Germany</hi>: Nor that <hi>Ludgate</hi> was ſo
call'd from King <hi>Lud,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Gate alſo is no <hi>Britiſh</hi>
Word, but was call'd <hi>Leod-geat,</hi> the Gate of the People or popular
Paſſage, in reſpect of the greater Concourſe thro' the ſame than any
other in thoſe Days. <hi>York</hi> the <hi>Saxons</hi> call'd
<hi>Euerwyc</hi> and <hi>Eberwyc,</hi> which by vulgar Abbreviation came to be
<hi>boric, uoric,</hi> and ſo <hi>York: Euer</hi> or <hi>Eber</hi>
ſignifying a wild Boar, and <hi>Wye,</hi> a Refuge, or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat; thoſe
Beaſts heretofore much infeſting the Foreſt of <hi>Gautries</hi> within a
Mile of the Town, inſomuch that there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a Toll call'd
<hi>Guid-Law,</hi> which is paid for Cattle at one of the Gates of the City,
which was granted for ſafe Conduct thro' the ſaid Foreſt. Here follow
ſome Examples ſhewing how Auxiliaries or Aſſiſtants to
diſtreſſed Inhabitants make themſelves Sharers in their Country; ſo
returning to <hi>Hingiſt,</hi> and his Succeſſors; we have a more
particular Account of <hi>Ethelbert,</hi> who was the fourth in Deſcent from
him, and the firſt of our <hi>Saxon</hi> Monarchs who embraced the
Chriſtian Faith; and of certain <hi>Engliſh</hi> Pagan Children, who being
a few Years before ſold at <hi>Rome,</hi> were ſo admired by
<hi>Gregory</hi> for their Beauty upon his hearing they were called
<hi>Angles,</hi> that he thought them not without reaſon ſo called, for
that, as he ſaid in alluſion thereto, they had Faces like Angels. This St.
<hi>Gregory</hi> who was himſelf coming to <hi>England,</hi> being
af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards made Pope, ſent St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> hither, who landed in
the Iſle of <hi>Tanet,</hi> where King <hi>Ethelbert</hi> reſorted to him.
And here we have a Repreſentation in Sculpture of the <pb n="308" facs="tcp:0570200100:337"/>

that of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the <hi>Netherlands</hi> were all one. How our
Country came in general to be called <hi>England</hi> by King <hi>Egbert,</hi>

               <p>The ſixth Chapter. <hi>Of the</hi> Danes <hi>and the</hi>

<hi>Danes</hi> are here obſerved to have renewed their ancient Wars againſt
the <hi>Saxons,</hi> now after they had been <hi>Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain</hi> about 350 Years,
and about 156 Years after they were become the ſole Poſſeſſors of
that Part now called <hi>England.</hi> Here we have an Account of the Antiquity
of theſe People, and the Cauſe of their invading this Country. The

greateſt King for extent of Dominion that <hi>England</hi> ever had. Of his
Succeſſors <hi>Harold</hi> and <hi>Hardicanute</hi>; which three
<hi>Daniſh</hi> Kings reigning about 27 Years, the Race of the <hi>Danes</hi>
were expell'd, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Line recovered again under <hi>Edward
the Confeſſor,</hi> who declared <hi>Edgar</hi> Heir of the Crown; but
<hi>Harold</hi> ſupplanting him, wore it till he loſt both it and his Life
in Battle againſt <hi>William</hi> Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> near
<hi>Haſtings</hi> in <hi>Suſſex,</hi> in <hi>October</hi> 1066. Thus we
enter upon the Hiſtory of the <hi>Normans:</hi> From whence they iſſued:
That they were Robbers by Sea: Of their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Invaſions, and their Cruelty
therein. Of <hi>Rollo</hi>'s firſt coming into <hi>England,</hi> and of the
ſeven <hi>Norman</hi> Dukes from him down to that <hi>William.</hi> His
Reſolution upon the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprize of <hi>England,</hi> with the three Cauſes
thereof, tho' the Crown was never intended him, by <hi>Edward the
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor,</hi> as by Reaſons alſo appears. The Particulars of this
Expedition from <hi>Megiſſier, Oudegerſt, Crantzius,</hi> &amp;c. His
great Number of Ships. The Place and Time of his land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0570200100:338"/> and his Victory. The Miſeries of the
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Nobility and Gentry thro' the Inſolence of the
<hi>Normans</hi>; not unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved by ſuch as rejected Prince <hi>Edgar</hi>
the lawful Heir to the Crown. The Honour of <hi>Kent.</hi> The
<hi>Engliſh</hi> flying into <hi>Scotland,</hi> and their Tongue firſt
ſpoken there. The Union between the Crowns of <hi>Scotland</hi> and
<hi>England.</hi> The Revival of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Credit; and the Death
of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror after about 20 Years Reign; with an Account of his Burial,
and Epitaph in <hi>Latin</hi> and <hi>Engliſh.</hi> A Computation, that of
the 3 or 400 Gentlemen he brought into <hi>England</hi> with him, whoſe Names
are in the Roll of <hi>Battail-Abbey,</hi> ſcarce one quarter of thoſe
Names are now remaining; whence it is concluded that <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> are
not ſuch a mixed Nation as ſome ſuppoſe.</p>
               <p>The ſeventh Chapter. <hi>Of the great</hi> Antiquity <hi>of our
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> Engliſh Tongue; <hi>and of the Propriety, Worthineſs and
Amplitude thereof; with an</hi> Explanation <hi>of ſundry our moſt
ancient</hi> Engliſh Words. Here it is aſſerted that the Ground of our
<hi>Engliſh</hi> is the <hi>Teutonic Tongue</hi>; and that this Language was
undoubtedly that, which, at the Confuſion of <hi>Babel</hi> the
<hi>Teutonic</hi> People, or thoſe conducted by <hi>Tuiſco</hi> did
ſpeak: One Inſtance given, is our uſing the Word <hi>babble,</hi> or
<hi>babbling,</hi> from <hi>Babel,</hi> when one ſpeaks confuſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or
vain: Other Inferences from our Language, being at firſt moſtly
Monoſyllables. Here we have an Account of <hi>Becanus</hi> his Opinion, That
the <hi>Teutonic</hi> was the Language <hi>Adam</hi> ſpake in
<hi>Paradiſe,</hi> with his Reaſons from the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of the Words
<hi>Adam, Eve, Cain, Abel, Seth, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noch,</hi> &amp;c. Alſo of <hi>God, Devil,
Heaven, Hell, Man, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> &amp;c. Here we have the Authorities of
<hi>Toletanus</hi> and <hi>Lipſius</hi> for the vaſt Extent of this ancient
Language, and a Cenſure upon the Wantonneſs of borrowing Words from the
<hi>French</hi> or <hi>Latin</hi> in writing or ſpeaking it. Inſtances of
this Age being given more to Variety than others. An Example of the Nearneſs
of our Language to the <hi>Dutch.</hi> How <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain</hi>
came to ſpeak broken <hi>Latin.</hi> Whence the Word <hi>Romance</hi> or
<hi>Romant</hi> is derived. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples, ſhewing the <hi>Old French</hi> and
<hi>Old Engliſh</hi> were much alike; from <hi>Du Haillan; Otfridus</hi> his
Preface to the Goſpels, tranſlated about 800 Years paſt; and
<hi>Willeramus</hi> the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot, his Tranſlation, into <hi>Old French,</hi> of
<hi>Canticum Cantico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum.</hi> Of the <hi>Norman</hi> Mixture with our Tongue;
and that afterwards <hi>Chaucer</hi> was a great Mingler of <hi>Engliſh</hi>
with <hi>French</hi>; wherefore, tho' our Author reverences him as 
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0570200100:339"/> an excellent Poet for his Time, he is not of their
Opinion who call him the firſt Illuminator of the <hi>Engliſh Tongue</hi>;
and thinks he might have the greater Affection to the <hi>French</hi> Language,
becauſe he was deſcended of a <hi>French</hi> or rather <hi>Walloon</hi>
Race. That ſince his Time, more <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin</hi> and <hi>French</hi> have been
admitted, than left out of our Tongue. From whence it is inferr'd that our
Language is diſcredited, by borrowing ſo much, even to the making our
ſelves unintelligible in our own Country, as that ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine Orator did who
declared, That 
<q rend="inline">"as he itinerated, he obviated a rural Perſon,
and interrogating him concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Tranſition of the Time, and the
Demonſtration of the Paſſage, found him a meer Simplician:"</q> Never
dreaming 'twas himſelf who made him ſo; and that if he had ask'd him in
plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> What it was o'clock? And which was his way to the
Place he wanted? he might have had a ſatisfactory Anſwer. As ſuch
Examples are apt to raiſe Deriſion even among our ſelves, much more may
Strangers be inclined to be merry with us at them; ſince they have nought
elſe for the Loan of their Words; diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining to borrow of our Store, which
we have rendered ſo obſolete and uncouth, by deſpiſing the Uſe of it
our ſelves. As an Example of this Neglect, our Author here gives an Alphabet
of our moſt ancient <hi>Engliſh</hi> Words with their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planations in
above thirty Pages, and herewith concludes this Part.</p>
               <p>The eighth Chapter conſiſts of <hi>the Etymologies of the
an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient</hi> Saxon Proper Names <hi>of Men and Women.</hi> This be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins with
ſome general Rules to diſcern the <hi>Saxon Proper Names</hi>; which leads
us to the <hi>Alphabet</hi> of them, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above thirty Pages; and
concludes with ſome Remarks upon the Wiſdom of our ſaid Anceſtors in
the Choice and Significancy of them, according to the Cuſtom of the
<hi>Hebrews,</hi> who ſo adapted, or had the like Propriety in their
<hi>Proper Names.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ninth Chapter ſhews <hi>how by the</hi> Surnames <hi>of the
Families of</hi> England <hi>it may be diſcerned from whence they take their
Originals, whether from the ancient</hi> Engliſh-Saxons, <hi>or from the</hi>
Danes <hi>or</hi> Normans. Here, after ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving how the <hi>Saxons</hi>
having given Names to Places in <hi>England,</hi> which Places afterwards gave
Names to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, the Method is preferr'd, becauſe our
<hi>Surnames</hi> are infinite, and it wou'd be tedious to ſpecify a
Multitude of them at length, of chuſing out the moſt uſual Terminations, 
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0570200100:340"/> each to ſerve for a kind of general Rule, how to
appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate all ſuch Names as do ſo end, or more clearly diſtinguiſh
thereby our ancient <hi>Engliſh</hi> Families; beginning with thoſe ending
in <hi>all,</hi> proceeding to thoſe ending in <hi>beke, berie,</hi> and ſo
thro' the whole Alphabet. After this we have another Alphabet of our ancient
Surnames which are of one Sylla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſometimes ſerving for Terminations
of other Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>names: Some alſo of two Syllables, and not uſed to ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
other Surnames. At the end of this we have a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rule for the knowing of
<hi>Engliſh</hi> Families, which is if there be a <hi>k</hi> or a <hi>w</hi>
in the Name, neither the <hi>Latin,</hi> nor any of the three Languages
depending thereon, uſing thoſe Letters; which ſometimes cauſes
Confuſion in their writing of our Names: A notorious Example whereof we have
in our renowned Sir <hi>John Hawkwood,</hi> who in the <hi>Latin</hi> Epitaph
upon his Monument at <hi>Florence,</hi> is written <hi>Joannes Acutus</hi>; the
<hi>h</hi> being left out as uſeleſs, the <hi>k</hi> and <hi>w</hi> as
unuſual; and ſo, returned into <hi>Engliſh,</hi> they have made <hi>John
Sharp</hi> of him. Here follows an Obſervation upon ſuch Surnames as have
been ſuppoſed to take their Original from the <hi>Danes:</hi> And laſtly,
the Surnames coming from the <hi>Normans</hi>; the whole Chapter ending with a
Remark upon the <hi>Britiſh</hi> or <hi>Welch</hi> Names which are thought to
have been mixed with thoſe of the <hi>Romans,</hi> the <hi>Britains</hi>
being under Subjection to theſe People about 500 Years. And hence concludes,
the honourable Family of <hi>Cecils,</hi> being iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued from
<hi>Wales,</hi> is originally deſcended from the <hi>Romans.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The tenth and laſt Chapter treats <hi>Of our ancient</hi>
Engliſh Titles <hi>of</hi> Honour, Dignities, <hi>and</hi> Offices; <hi>and
what they ſignify: Alſo the Signification of our</hi> Engliſh Names
<hi>of</hi> Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grace <hi>or</hi> Contempt; beginning, in the firſt Part,
with the Name of King, and ending with <hi>Yeoman</hi> and <hi>Groom:</hi> And
in the ſecond Part, beginning with <hi>Baud,</hi> and ending with
<hi>Thief.</hi> And this, with Notice of the <hi>Table</hi> or <hi>Index</hi>
at the end, of the ſpecial Points in the Book, may give a ſufficient View
or Intimation of what is comprehended in the whole Work.</p>
               <p>We ſhall here take our leave of it, with recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whenever
it arrives at another Impreſſion, thoſe A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimadverſions to be added or
ſubjoined in their proper Places, which have been ſince occaſionally made
on ſome Miſtakes in it, by ſome learned Searchers into our Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities:
As thoſe made by Mr. <hi>Sheringham</hi> on his Fancy of the <hi>Vitae,</hi>

               <p>THE accurate Author of this compendious Tract, having recited the
various Opinions which have been advanced about the time of the Foundation of
this Univerſity, which is juſtly reputed one of the moſt famous in the
World, ſays, it is chiefly concluded and agreed, that <hi>Alfred</hi> King of
the Weſt <hi>Saxons,</hi> about the Year 872, was the principal Founder
thereof. And tho' by Wars, both before and ſince the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, its ancient
Glory was much eclipſed, yet ſo has it been reſtored by ſucceeding
Princes, and other Benefactors, as to become conſpicuous among the moſt
famous Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in <hi>Europe:</hi> And however, the <hi>Hoſtels, Halls,
Inns, Schools,</hi> and Religious <hi>Houſes,</hi> whereof, ſince the
Conqueſt it did conſiſt, but now defaced or converted into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
Foundations there, were for their Number and that of the Students in them
beyond thoſe now extant; yet true and ſolid Learning has latterly prevailed
there more than ever, and at this preſent there are eighteen goodly
<hi>Colleges</hi> and <hi>Houſes</hi> maintained with the Lands and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues
of their Founders, and ſeven <hi>Halls,</hi> where Students live at their own
Charge: Beſides there are publick <hi>Schools,</hi> and a <hi>Library,</hi>
whoſe Fabric by the Bounty of many royal, noble, and religious Perſons was
of late Years finiſhed, which no Univerſity in the World can in all Points
parallel. Here follows their Names, the Times when, and Perſons

               <p>THIS Tract, written by the ſame Hand with the former, as appears
by the Manner and Method of it, begins al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo with reciting the various
Opinions about the Foundation of this Univerſity; but ſays, the chiefeſt
agree, That <hi>Sige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> King of the <hi>Eaſt Angles</hi> was the
principal Founder thereof, about the Years 630 and 636; who aſſigned divers
Hoſtels and Houſes for the Students, giving them large Privileges and
Charters, whereof ſome are yet extant; and procuring alſo great Immunities
from Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> I. which <hi>Sergius</hi> I. confirm'd. Since which
time, tho' by Wars, both before and ſince the Conqueſt, it was much
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faced; yet recovering itſelf, it is reputed one of the moſt famous
Univerſities in the World. Much Honour it has received by the many Sons and
Nephews of Kings who have been <hi>Earls</hi> thereof. And tho' the ancient
Hoſtels and Houſes were more numerous, yet at preſent it conſiſts of
ſixteen goodly Colleges and Halls, erected and maintain'd with the Lands of
their ſeveral Founders; ſome whereof no Univerſity can in all Points
parallel: And they are as follows.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>St. Peter's College</hi> or <hi>Houſe:</hi> Founded
1280, by <hi>Hugo de Baſham,</hi> afterwards Biſhop of <hi>Ely.</hi> He
ſettled the Endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments two Years after for one Maſter and fourteen
Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, and died before all Things were finiſh'd. Other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops 
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0570200100:348"/> of <hi>Ely</hi> afterwards added to their Means; and in
pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of time aroſe many Benefactors, who are ſeveral of them here
named. This College being the firſt, now ſtanding in this Univerſity,
hath in it a Maſter, nineteen Fellows, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine Bible Clerks, eight poor

<hi>Clare,</hi> ſometime Wife of <hi>John de Burgo</hi> Earl of

               <p>THIS ancient and valuable Collection begins with a Copy of the
<hi>Interpretation</hi> of, and <hi>Additions</hi> to <hi>the Statutes of the
Order of the Garter,</hi> made by King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. with the Advice and
Aſſent of the Companions of the ſaid Order on the 29th Day of
<hi>May,</hi> in the eleventh Year of his Reign. There are Additions and
Interlineations in ſeveral Places, of ſome Corrections or Amendments in the
hand-writing of Sir <hi>Thomas Wriotheſley;</hi> and is intitled at the top
of one of the Pages, <hi>The now Statutes.</hi> This conſiſts of nine
Pages, and is followed with <hi>The Ordon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naunces for the Officers of the
Order;</hi> in the beginning of which, the ſaid King <hi>Henry</hi> is called
<hi>Renovator</hi> of the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Order of St. <hi>George,</hi> in the 13th year
of his Reign or 1521. This Part treats of the five Officers of the ſaid
Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; who are the <hi>Prelate, Chancellor, Regiſter, King of Arms</hi>
called <hi>Garter,</hi> and the <hi>Huiſſier of Arms</hi> named the

their Privileges, Habits, Wages, and Liveries; alſo the Liberties and

Introduction thereof. Moreover, here are the Pourtraits or Limnings of theſe
five Officers, in their proper Robes and Enſigns of the Order, and all in
their proper Colours. This Part fills eight Pages, but there ſeems to be a
Leaf wanting at the end, becauſe it breaks off abruptly in the Account of the
Uſher of the Black Rod and his Salary; and there is wholly wanting the
Privileges of the Poor Knights as before promiſed. Next follows, which

written, but in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Hand, (which has been ſuppoſed to be <hi>John
Stow's</hi>) <hi>Neceſſaryes of a ſtrange Prince choſen a Brother and a

               </p>
               <p>After a Copy of an old Deed, in another hand, upon the next Leaf,
executed in the Reign of King <hi>Edward</hi> III. we enter upon a View of the
Arms and Creſts of the Knights of the Garter, blazon'd all in their proper
Colours. There may be near two hundred, moſt of them finiſh'd, in the
compaſs of about ſeventy Pages; and what is a very great Curioſity in a
Work of this nature, we have the Badges to about fourſcore of them, painted
or drawn with a Pen, againſt, or at the ſides of ſo many of the ſaid
Coats. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what ſtill inhances its value to the hiſtorical
Inſpector, is, that not only the Names of moſt of the Knights Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions 
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0570200100:354"/> are appropriated to the greater part of thoſe Arms,
but Characters alſo given of upwards of threeſcore of them, containing a
ſhort Account of their Actions, Marriages, Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſues, Benefactions, Death
and Burial. Which Particulars of ſuch ancient Record, as this Writing, and
theſe Draughts ſeem to be, muſt be eſteemed moſt authentic, as being
ſo near the original Fountains of Intelligence. In the ſeventh Page of
theſe Draughts we find, againſt one of the Coats, this Writing; 
<q rend="inline">"<hi>John</hi> King of <hi>Portugal</hi> 20 <hi rend="sup">li</hi>

<hi>Scutes</hi> for Dobelet. TH. WR."</q> The former part of this Work ſeems
plainly as old as King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. becauſe in the third Page of
theſe Draughts, where his Arms and Badges are diſplay'd, it is thus written
of him, 
<q rend="inline">"and <hi>nowe gloriouſly reigneth owre Soveryne

Wriotheſley</hi> Garter King of Arms was Author of ſome of theſe
Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, and Sir <hi>Thomas,</hi> who was Garter afterwards, and died 26
<hi>Henry</hi> VIII.<note n="*" place="bottom">Vide <hi>Weever</hi>'s <hi>Fun.

               <p>The principal Perſonages whoſe Arms, Badges, and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
are thus drawn forth, are firſt, King <hi>Edward</hi> III. who, in his
beginning did many great Acts, here briefly mention'd. After him, King
<hi>Richard</hi> II. who kept a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant Houſhold, built

buried at <hi>Chartſey,</hi> and now is removed to the Colege of
<hi>Wyndeſore,</hi> where he was born. Next, King <hi>Edward</hi> IV. Flower

was King, and did that foule dede, was preyſed for a coragious Knyght,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> The next is King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. of whoſe Character we

<hi>Derby,</hi> Duke of <hi>Lancaſter, Hugh</hi> Earl of <hi>Stafford,</hi>
and <hi>Edward</hi> Lord <hi>Spencer.</hi> Then we have no Characters to four

in his tender Age; a Fader in nourture, and a Patron; died in the Caſtell of
<hi>Rouen</hi>; no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly enterred in the College of <hi>Warwick.</hi> Afterwards
we have ſuch another ſhort Character of <hi>Waultier</hi> firſt Lord 
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:0570200100:357"/> 
                  <hi>Hungerford,</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> Earl of
<hi>Rivers.</hi> Alſo of Sir <hi>James Audeley,</hi> a noble Warrior, who
accompanied Prince <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> in all his Warres: One of the ſpecial
Cauſers, thro' his Courage, of the wynnyng of the Bataille of
<hi>Poitiers:</hi> And of <hi>John</hi> Lord <hi>Talbot</hi> Earl of

Counſeil, and with him in all his noble Deeds; whiche ofte was ſente in
Ambaſſade to Ducs, Princes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus we end our Survey of
this Part, containing the Arms and Characters of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Knights of the
Garter down to, about the middle of King <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. his
Reign.</p>
               <p>On the ſecond Page of the ſame Leaf where the former Work
ends, begins another of a different kind, being nothing but Pourtraiture
without any Introduction or verbal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, and continues for twenty four
Pages ſucceſſively. It contains a diſtinct Repreſentation in ſo
many painted Draughts of the ancient Ceremonies uſed in creating the
<hi>Knights of the Bath.</hi> The Figures in theſe Limnings, tho' they are
not every where in exact Proportion, or finely finiſh'd off to the Eye, are
yet ſo very obſervable for the punctual Regard that ſeems to have been
paid to the due Repreſentation of all Parts of the Solemnity, all proper
Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that ſhould appear, all Officers and Attendants, with all the
Diſtinction of Habits, Ornaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that above fourſcore
Years ſince theſe Draughts were thought worthy of being graved and brought
into Print<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <bibl>In <hi>Nich. Upton</hi> de Studio
Milit. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fol. <hi>Lond.</hi> 1654.</bibl>
                  </note>; wherefore we
ſhall only obſerve further of them here, that in the ſaid Sculpture they
are nothing ſo intelligent as in theſe the original Paintings, becauſe
the whole Ceremony being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted all into one Sheet Print, and the Colours
all reduced to black and white, we are deprived of ſeveral remarkable 
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:0570200100:358"/> Diſtinctions in the ſaid Copy, which in theſe
Illuminations might give great Light to ſome Parts of our Hiſtory and
Antiquities.</p>
               <p>After theſe Views of this Ceremony we have, two or three Tables
or Genealogies of <hi>Hungary</hi>; of the Kings of <hi>Caſtille,</hi> and
the <hi>Fitzhardings,</hi> &amp;c. Then we come to ſome Pourtraits of certain
noble Perſonages two in a Leaf, at full length, painted in their proper
Habits and Robes for twelve Pages together. Among theſe are King
<hi>Edward</hi> I. and his Queen; <hi>Richardus de Monthermer</hi> Earl of
<hi>Glouceſter</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> with <hi>Joanna</hi> Lady
<hi>Acres</hi> his Wife, Daughter of that King; <hi>Tho. de Monthermer</hi> his
Son, and <hi>Edward</hi> his Son: Alſo <hi>John</hi> the Son of <hi>William
de Montacute,</hi> and <hi>Margaret</hi> Daughter of <hi>Thomas de Monthermer;
John</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> his Son, with their
Counteſſes; <hi>Richard Nevyle</hi> Earl of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> and his
Lady <hi>Alice; Richard Nevil</hi> Earl of <hi>Warwick,</hi> and <hi>Anne</hi>
his Lady; King <hi>Richard</hi> III. and his Queen <hi>Anne; William</hi> Lord
<hi>Ferres</hi> of <hi>Groby,</hi> and Lady <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garet</hi> his Wife; alſo
the Duke of <hi>Exeter</hi> and his Dutcheſs. Of which Pictures the Men,
being moſt of them in Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; have their Helmets cloſed over their Faces,
all but the two King <hi>Richards,</hi> and <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Edward</hi>
Sons of <hi>Richard de Monthermer.</hi> After theſe we have in four Pages
more, ſome unfiniſhed Draughts of the Standard Bearers; between two of
which are ſome of the Knights Companions of the firſt and ſecond Stall
mention'd.</p>
               <p>Then follow a few Leaves of ſome Coats of Arms with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Creſts
or Badges, and a <hi>Pedigree</hi> of <hi>Dampetre, Earl</hi> of
<hi>Flanders</hi>; with a Draught of two or three monumental Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures: And then
we come to an Account of the <hi>Fees that</hi> William Brugys <hi>alias</hi>
Garter <hi>had of the Prelate and Knights of the Order, beſides the
Sovereign:</hi> Which <hi>Brugys</hi> was in the time of King <hi>Henry</hi> V.
and King <hi>Henry</hi> VI. in his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. Alſo a Memorandum of about
ſixteen <hi>Knights who were created Peers in the Reign of King</hi> Henry
<hi>VI.</hi> and the Days when. The next is a Liſt of the <hi>Knights of the
Garter the Third of King</hi> Edward <hi>VI.</hi> in <hi>French</hi>; but
either the Account is not finiſhed, or the number of them were then but
Eighteen including the Sovereign. The next Piece is the <hi>Pedigree of the
Lord</hi> Perſe <hi>of</hi> Luxemburgh <hi>Earl of Saint Poule.</hi> Towards
the Concluſion of this Pedigree, we learn that it was made for the Lady
<hi>Margaret Vaux,</hi> and that the Brother of this Lady was named
<hi>William</hi> Lord of the <hi>Vaux,</hi> who was then alive: And further we
have theſe <pb n="330" facs="tcp:0570200100:359"/> Words, 
<q rend="inline">"Lo now have ye the Pedigree of the Fader, of the
Moder of my Lady <hi>Margaret</hi> of the <hi>Vaux</hi> now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yng alyve, Moder

<hi>Britayn,</hi> now all beyng on lyve."</q> And here ends, as we conjecture,
the ancient Collections in this Book which were made, for the moſt part, by
the <hi>Wriotheſleys,</hi> that is, all but a few of the odd Pedigrees, and
perhaps alſo one or two of the laſt Articles which are here mention'd. For
we obſerve all the Paper (except one Leaf, containing only an Illumination of
ſome monumental Ornament, and might be inſerted at the laſt binding up of
the Volume) from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Knights of the Garter's Arms to this
Place, has one Maker's Mark upon it, <hi>viz.</hi> Three <hi>Flower de
Luces</hi> in a <hi>Scutcheon</hi> with a <hi>Coronet</hi> over it.</p>
               <p>What follows in this Volume (bound into it by a later Owner) are,
firſt, two Sheets printed in Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi>'s time, the one from a
Copper-Plate, and is called, <hi>The Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Roſes of the Families
of</hi> Lancaſter <hi>and</hi> York: With the <hi>Arms</hi> of thoſe who
have been choſen of the moſt Honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Order</hi> of the
<hi>Garter,</hi> from that Time to this Day, 1589. It was compoſed, that is
the Arms and Dates were ſettled by <hi>Thomas Talbot</hi> a noted Antiquary
of thoſe Times, and graved by <hi>Jodocus Hondius</hi> of <hi>Flanders</hi>
in <hi>London</hi> the Year above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd. The other Sheet is ſtuck upon
Canvas, and is ſo ſoil'd 'tis ſcarce legible; but it contains a ſhort
Account in <hi>Latin</hi> of all the Orders of Knighthood Eccleſiaſtical or
Civil that are famous thro' the Chriſtian World. I think it is dedicated to
Dr. <hi>Tho. Hesketh</hi> by <hi>John Clapham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There are further two <hi>Latin</hi> Tracts in this Volume, which
alſo never belonged originally to the aforeſaid Collections, but are both
bound in with them, (Parchment Covers and all) the one called <hi>Libertates
Collegii.</hi> The other contains the Accounts of <hi>Owen Oglethorp</hi>
Treaſurer of St. <hi>George</hi>'s Chapel, from the laſt Day of
<hi>October</hi> in the 38th of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. to the laſt of
<hi>September</hi> in the firſt of King <hi>Edward</hi> VI. The reſt of the
Book conſiſts only of ſeveral Sheets of the printed Titles and painted
Arms of ſome Knights of the Garter in King <hi>Charles</hi> the Second's
time; ſuch as are uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally diſperſed at their Inſtallations, and only
bound in here, at the End, to make it a Volume as portly and magni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficent 
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0570200100:360"/> to outward Appearance, as it is intrinſically
valuable. The Care of thus gathering and binding together theſe Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lections
is owing to that eminent Antiquary and Herald Mr. <hi>Elias Aſhmole,</hi>
whoſe Book it appears to have been by the Impreſſion of his Arms which we
ſee on the Cover: But the Liberty of thus obliging the Publick with the
Contents of it, we owe to the gracious Favour of a noble Peer, who is moſt
worthily poſſeſſed thereof; having beſides the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neroſity of this
Communication, alſo been at no ſmall Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence in honouring the Memories of
thoſe illuſtrious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages whoſe Pourtraitures are before
mention'd.</p>

Chance? And a little further, we obſerve, that from the ſixteenth Year of
his Age till this Day, his Cuſtom had been, in the Courſe of his Reading to
ſtore up all ſuch Reaſons and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples as occurr'd in Philoſophy, the
Civil Laws, Divinity, or Hiſtories, to the Ruin of pretended Prophets and
their Propheſies. The Readers, of whoſe Cenſure he is moſt
ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive, are of three Sorts: The firſt, looking not into the Subject
but the Writer, with ſuch Partiality, that <hi>Battus</hi> ſhall ſooner
be crowned with Laurel, if he bear their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, than <hi>Homer</hi> with an
Ivy Garland, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond Sort, are the cloſe ſullen
Cenſors, who injure no leſs by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Scorn and malicious Innuendos,
than by open Exclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And the laſt kind, are the falſe Prophets and
their Favourites, who neither upon Spleen againſt the Writer, nor overweening
of themſelves, but only with a mortal Fear leſt their <hi>Diana</hi>
ſhould be robb'd of her ſilver Shrine, are like to bend their whole
Endeavour againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of their inveterate Abuſes. This is
followed with ſome curious Reflections upon the Vanity of Propheſies and
Oracles; by the utmoſt Pretenſions whereof, we cannot alter the determinate
Courſe which is prefixed in the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of God, nor prognoſticate of
any future Accident. We may change our Veſſel, like Sea-ſick
Paſſengers, but not our Pain; our Bed, but not our Fit; our Climate, but
not our Quality: For he that ſtinted and confined us to Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment upon the
Ground, forbade us, as it were by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, <hi>ambulare in
Mirabilibus;</hi> and he that made us ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of many preſent Matters for
our own Behoof, would not entangle us with Gueſſes and Conjectures <hi>de
futuris,</hi> for a greater Inconveniency. The Trees which are moſt backward
in putting forth their Bloſſoms, proſper long; whereas Almonds are moſt
commonly decay'd and ſtarv'd by the Froſt, for putting out before their
Fellows. Of Time paſt, there is no Comfort; of Joy preſent, no Stay; of
Chance future, no Certainty. Why then ſhould not all Sorts of feigned
Prophets look into the Devil's Craft? Who deals like the Eagle with a
Shell-fiſh, or a cunning Wreſtler with his Mate, in hoiſting us up to the
niceſt, and moſt fickle Points, that afterwards the Fall may be more
dangerous, and his Prey eaſy; which would never come to paſs, if Men would
look into the Works of God with the Eyes of Hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs, 
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:0570200100:362"/> not pry into the Secrets of his Purpoſe, with the
Spectacles of Vain-Glory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Then, after ſubmitting to the
Judgment of his ſaid Patron, whether this Work ſhould be deſtroy'd or
committed to the Preſs, and praying that he might be bleſſed with his
heavenly Favour in as ample Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure as himſelf had taſted of his
honourable Friendſhip, he concludes this <hi>Dedication</hi>; which is
followed with a ſhort <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle</hi> to the <hi>Reader.</hi> Wherein we
perceive he has reformed to advantage his firſt propoſed Method of
diſpatching all his Anſwers to the ſeveral Branches of Propheſy
together in one Maſs or Lump, before the winding up of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, by
anſwering every Part diſtinctly under its proper Head, for good Reaſons
here given. After which he had ſome Thoughts of detecting the falſe Virtues
and Properties impoſed upon Herbs and Stones; but conſidering how
de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicable theſe Abuſes were held in the Days of <hi>Sozomen,</hi> and
that ſuch Fantaſies come never further out of Seaſon, than when grave
Matters are debated with Authority, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued no further this Purpoſe: So
cloſes his Epiſtle with his good Wiſhes to his Reader.</p>
               <p>The Work it ſelf is introduced with the Story of
<hi>Ulyſſes</hi> loitering with <hi>Circe</hi> the Sorcereſs, in his
return from <hi>Troy</hi>; and the Confeſſion of <hi>Echinis</hi> a reputed
Prophet, how vain all Pretenſions are this Way. Here we have a Diviſion of
<hi>Propheſies,</hi> into divers Kinds, with a Rejection of them, and a
compendious Way offer'd to be ſatisfied in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of ſuch Treatment
thereof. Firſt, by pointing out the Cauſes which induce Men to embark their
Hope on ſo faithleſs a Bottom as that of Propheſies. Secondly, by
diſproving all theſe Kinds thereof, to make it appear what Pains have been
taken to ſeduce the illiterate and unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Part of Mankind. Thirdly, by
ſhewing how our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering to ſuch Vanities is inconſiſtent with the
Duty of a true Subject or a good Chriſtian; from which <hi>Data</hi> or
Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples is to be known what kind of Prophets may be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated in a State.
Fourthly and laſtly, by giving a full An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to ſuch Arguments as have
been uſed in Defence of ſuch Practices. The firſt Cauſe then, is a
Deſire in Man to ſoar above the State he was put in by God. Secondly, a
Diſtruſt of God; while we think he is not as willing by his Mercy, as able
by his Might to help us. Thirdly, a Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in being apt to believe things
we wiſh may come to paſs: Alſo ſhewing that many Times there needs no
more to the making a Prophet than a natural and eaſy Deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion 
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:0570200100:363"/> of an Effect from a Cauſe; with ſeveral Inſtances
here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Fourth and laſtly, an Impatience to know beforehand, the Revolutions
of Government, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here we have ſome Reflections on the Burden
of Honour, the Depravity of Ambition, and Vanity of Divination; that it is
unwarranted both by Divinity and Philoſophy: That if Reaſon cannot
compaſs it, neither will any other Principle in Man; and in what Caſes he
may be provident, but not prophetic: That Melancholy is inſufficient to
qualify Men with this Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty: And that Paſſion is the Parent thereof, as
<hi>Porphiry</hi> maintain'd, is proved erroneous. Hence we paſs to</p>
               <p>Chap. II. Of <hi>Dreams. Plato</hi> the chief Patron of them. No
Certainty to be gathered from any Thing he has writ on this Head.
<hi>Ariſtotle</hi> nearer the Truth; who maintains, That the Limits of our
Knowledge are adequate only to the Strength or Abilities of the Soul, which in
its preſent State, being always immerſed in Matter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
ſeems unable, upon the Reception of Images in ſleep, to judge whether they
are anſwer'd by any Thing external or no. If Sleep were a Means to diſcover
Things to come, then the ſounder and deeper the Sleep, the greater would be
the Diſcovery; but we find contrariwiſe, that Things of Moment are revealed
in ſlumbers. This Kind of Divination moreover is contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to the Vulgar,
and not to the beſt and wiſeſt ſort of Men; and Dreams are the
Amuſement alſo of Infants, and even Brutes as well as human Creatures: The
moſt affecting, often broken, confuſed and effaced out of the Memory.
Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome Reaſons of the Ancients for raiſing our Regard to Dreams, we
have our Author's for not heeding them. As 1. That ſince they are ſo ſoon
forgot, the Print they make muſt needs be ſhallow. 2. That no judicious Man
will chuſe Fancy for his Guide; but Dreams are Fancies. 3. If Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legories
pleaſe us, <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Robe was of Purple with a Gloſs, not
ſhadowy. 4. The Gods are wont to reveal their Myſteries to Men ſober and
diſcreet; but we find none dream more than the Fickle and Ungodly. 5. God,
who is Purity itſelf, will not make Dreams the Shadows of his ordinary Grace.
6. We may not expect him to give ſo fair a Colour for Man to depend more upon
the Pride of his Nature which is frail, than upon the Rule of Providence which
is certain. 7. To be exploded, as what would be Cauſes of Strife and Debate.
8. And withdraw our Mind from our Duty. 9. As they could not be
diſtinguiſhed, the Certain from the Frivolous. 10. As they could not be 
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:0570200100:364"/> valued for Grounds of Truth without detracting from the
ſacred Majeſty. 11, and laſtly, As we are not to meaſure Truth by the
Line of Imagination. Moreover, if any Aim were to be taken or Guide deſign'd
from Dreams, ſome Interpreters would be found ſo expert that we could not
err; but they appear not: And tho' the Events ſhould anſwer ſome
Expoſitions, who can ſay this is not Chance? As for admitting ſome Dreams
to have been ſuggeſted by An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, they cannot be admitted for ordinary
Dreams, therefore make not for the Diviner's Trade. And ſince neither any
Dreams bring one Effect to divers Perſons, nor to the ſelf-ſame at all
Times, it may be taken for a ſenſeleſs Practice to juſtify the Follies
of a number by the Events of ſome. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God's not revealing
himſelf by this Means, as well now, as he may have anciently done, here are
Reaſons given to ſhew that his Will in this Point is not correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
with his Power. Hence we proceed to</p>
               <p>Chap. III. Of <hi>Oracles.</hi> And here we have the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous
Accounts which the Heathens gave of Divinations thereby, expoſed. With
<hi>Cicero</hi>'s Notion, That the Mind being inſpired or blown up by certain
Vapours or Exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, deliver'd thoſe Oracles. And <hi>Cotta</hi>'s
Queſtion to the Collectors of <hi>Apollo's</hi> Offering, <hi>viz.</hi> If he
were a God, why did he ſhrowd himſelf in the Bowels of the Earth? That the
Iſland <hi>Delphos,</hi> where ſtood the Idol of <hi>Apollo,</hi> was
inſpired by Exhalations from the Ground, as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by <hi>Plutarch,</hi>
but diſproved by our Author; who aſcribes the Propheſies from ſuch
Effect, more to the Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men than the Prieſts. His Compariſon of the
Fable, which ſuppoſes the firſt Prophet to have been found by Chance in
an old Vault in <hi>Hetruria,</hi> to the Tale in <hi>Nubrigenſis,</hi>
concerning two young Children brought to <hi>Wolpet</hi> in <hi>Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folk</hi>
with an Eaſtern Wind. The Anſwer of <hi>Apollo</hi>'s Proc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors to the
Queſtion of ſome Philoſophers, why <hi>Delphos</hi> remaining the ſame
in Subſtance, Situation, and Quality as uſual, was notwithſtanding
deprived of the Virtue of afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Oracles, if Exhalations were intereſted
in the Cauſe: With the Shift of <hi>Demetrius</hi> upon this Objection.
Alſo, the Argument of a wild Man for the Silence of this Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle; who ſaid,
<hi>Apollo</hi> was doing Penance for certain Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities with
<hi>Daphne,</hi> &amp;c. So could not attend as uſual, to the giving out
Oracles. <hi>Cicero</hi> confeſſes this Silence; but evades the Debate of
the Cauſe. And the Opinions of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <pb n="336" facs="tcp:0570200100:365"/> are produced;
but the coming of <hi>Chriſt</hi> is concluded to be the real Occaſion of
ſuch Silence.</p>
               <p>Chap. IV. Of <hi>Aſtrology.</hi> Its Definition. That the
Houſes, Faces, Images, Aſpects, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which it aſcribes to
Planets, are neither apparent to Senſe, nor revealed in Philoſophy: That it
is impoſſible for one or all the Planets to ſuppreſs the Properties of
Nature; as that a Child which is born under a frowning Planet ſhould never
laugh. A cold Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in Planets vainly aſſerted. The
<hi>Peripatetic</hi> Principle, that no Planet, the Moon excepted, changes
Property, but by regard of Place. The Opinion of others, that all Planets are
favourable in their Kind, but forced to degenerate by Malice in the Bodies on
which they work. That they work according to the Matter which they find,
without giving a ſecond Nature, or correcting the firſt. The Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why
St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> renounced this Study of the Stars, with the ridiculous
Subdiviſion of the <hi>Zodiac</hi> by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to this Art. The
Conceits about the <hi>Aſpects</hi> of the Planets, ſufficiently ſhaken
by this Rule in Philoſophy: That the Diſpoſition of divers Cauſes
tending to one certain End, cannot forego their Virtue by meer Diſtance, and
nothing elſe. Things ſublunary only ſubject to Paſſions and
Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and, therefore, not the ſupream Bodies or their Beams, as
Aſtrologers imagine. Upon what the Conſideration of <hi>Aſpects</hi>
depends. The Notion of Aſpects taken up, in the Author's Opinion, from the
ſundry Shapes and Figures of the Moon. Next is the Divination from certain
Parts of a Planet confuted, by the Authority of its Inventors. That the
<hi>Chaldees</hi> admitted but eleven Signs: the Forms of which accounted for
by our Author. The abſurd Reaſonings of Aſtrologers from theſe Signs;
as alſo their Inability to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for ſuppoſed Images in the Front or
Face of every Sign; with their want of Reaſon or Authority for culling out
only a certain number of fixed Stars as influential. <hi>Ptolemy</hi>'s
allowing to the Planets ordinary Luck, but to the fixed Stars Happineſs,
inconceivable. <hi>Bonatus</hi> his Shift a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Objection drawn from
the Uſe of only a certain number of Stars, followed by the Reaſon why
Philoſophers defined Chance and Fortune to be Cauſes not in themſelves,
but by Accident. The Argument, That Events, which draw their Virtue rather from
the Means which happen by the way, than from the firſt Intent; from Fortune
than from Foreſight; ſeem to be brought to paſs by Chance al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together, in
reſpect of us; objected to, by a Compariſon <pb n="337" facs="tcp:0570200100:366"/> which in
no wiſe holds, <hi>viz.</hi> That we may gueſs at the Courſe of Things by
poring on the Stars, as well as a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter at the Goodneſs of a Frame by
knowing the Timber. Wherefore all Knowledge from remoteſt Cauſes, as from
the Planets, is obſcure. <hi>Plato,</hi> tho' neareſt the Truth, when he
ſays, That all Planets are benevolent, is yet oppoſed by the Planetarians
to keep up their Scheme. No preſcribing with certainty, where, upon one
Change, ſo many others follow; as in this Art. The Diviſions of
Aſtrologers in their Fundamentals. Alſo a Queſtion put to them, Whether,
touching Things which are perfected in Time, we ſhould gueſs according to
the Minute wherein the Work is firſt conceived in our Thought, or when it is
begun, or when it is perfected; or when only part and not the whole is
finiſhed. Some Opinions herein; with the Application of the Queſtion: As
that, ſince the time of Conception is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain, we muſt take our Aim by
that of the Birth, as the only Mark we have to guide us. <hi>Haly</hi>'s
Attempt to prove the time of Conception and Birth to be the ſame; with the
divers Accidents concurring before we can take the certain Minute of any Birth.
The abſurd Reply of ſome hereto. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealths alſo, as preſumed to
have their Fates, the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of theſe Pretenders. They are queſtion'd
again, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they believe that Influence they talk of, univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal; from
all the Heavens, or from the Planets only? Shew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it pinches them which
way ſoever they take it. And after obſerving, that the Angels know nothing
but as God has revealed it to them, concludes, we muſt be Fools in thinking
that any Thing can be diſcerned in an <hi>Ephemeris,</hi> which is but the
Device of Man. Here we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon the Arguments to be drawn from Experience
upon this Subject; and after its Definition we have the Reaſons why it will
make nothing in favour for aſtrological Divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. That from the Flights
of <hi>Birds</hi> and Bowels of <hi>Beaſts</hi> Gueſſes and Inferences
were ſometimes anſwered by Events, but not from the Influence of thoſe
Things which were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the Cauſes. Thus tho' a War ſhould
follow an <hi>Eclipſe,</hi> we may find a more real and rational Cauſe.
Next we have an Examination of the dreaded Events of <hi>Comets.</hi> How
divided the Opinions of the Ancients about them. The Objection drawn from
Experience, of <hi>Comets</hi> that have brought forth one Effect, anſwered.
That nothing can be predicted from them, becauſe of their Inconſtancy in
time and place of Appearance, Motion, Figure, Continuance, 
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0570200100:367"/> Qualities, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Arguments for their
denoting the Deaths of Princes diſproved in every Branch. That they have died
oftner after the glaring of a Rainbow. That many great Princes here named, had
not their Deaths foretold by any Comets. Obſervations on the Plenty and
Proſperity that rather follow'd them; and Health, exemplify'd in Queen
<hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who never was in better State of Body than during the
twenty five Years of her Reign, in which many Comets appear'd. And here our
Author affirms, as an Eye-Witneſs, 
<q rend="inline">"That when divers ſcrupulouſly diſſuaded
her Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty at <hi>Richmond</hi> from looking at the Comet which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
laſt (in 1572) with a Courage anſwerable to the greatneſs of her State,
ſhe cauſed the Window to be ſet open, and caſt out theſe Words,
<hi>Jacta eſt alea; The Dice are thrown:</hi> Affirming that <hi>her
ſtedfaſt Hope and Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was too firmly planted in the Providence of
God, to be blaſted or affrighted with thoſe Beams, which either had a
Ground in Nature whereon to riſe, or at leaſt no Warrant in Scripture to
portend the Miſhaps of Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</hi> Behold a Woman, and a Queen, which
ſeem to be the Kinds and Callings, upon which the Comets, if A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologers
ſpeak Truth, are wont to prey; and yet ſhe not only relenteth not to common
Fear, but inſulteth rather upon common Folly! Then we have a fine Compliment
paid to her Majeſty for her numerous Virtues, which might make her an
Exception to the common Rule; becauſe <hi>Wiſdom governs the
Stars.</hi>"</q> Next we have the Fancies of thoſe who aſcribe the Cauſe
of Earthquakes to Planets, condemned; with an Anſwer to the Demand why we may
not as lawfully ſeek out the Properties of Stars as of Stones, Metals,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> Shewing, that to ſearch for that in the Sky which may be
found nearer hand, is repugnant to Philoſophy. And becauſe ſome
countenance their Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions by <hi>Aſtronomy,</hi> 'tis here
diſtinguiſh'd what Parts of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture this Science conſiders, and in what
Manner the Rules or Propoſitions of any Art ſhould be lawful, true and
agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to Nature, which cannot be found in Aſtrology. Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments taken
from Phyſick, Phyſiognomy, and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to prove it an Art of no avail.
Againſt the Aſſertion that it is impoſſible to gather any certain
Knowledge of Things which are brought forth by the Concourſe of divers
diſunited Accidents; 'tis affirm'd by the other ſide, Poverty, Sickneſs,
Death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſhould rather bear the Name of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents than of
Accidents, foraſmuch as they claeve to <pb n="339" facs="tcp:0570200100:368"/> the Subject,
having a certain Foundation or Ground at the Bottom of our Natures; and the
falſity of this Affirmation expoſed. Did Planets convey ſuch Qualities
and Influences as are pretended? then muſt they work the like Effects on
Beaſts. No Credit to the Art, that <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> affirms, theſe
lower Parts or Earth do confine upon the higher; nor that Perſons inhabiting
under the Meridian are exceeding timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, effeminate, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Nor
laſtly, what <hi>Melanchton</hi> affirms, That Children which are born in the
eighth Month never live. The Doctrine of Inundations, Plagues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the Contagion of the Air; the Air receiving this Contagion
from the Planets, and the Planets being the Cauſes of our Miſery,
conſider'd and anſwer'd, by a parallel Caſe of the Heart in Man.
<hi>Haly</hi>'s Inſtance alſo of Floods, and parching Heats from Planets,

               <p>Chap. V. <hi>Of Conference with Familiars or damned Spirits.</hi>
Herein is ſet down, the belief of ſome, That there neither is certain Hell,
nor ſhall be Spirits till the latter Day: How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, the Exiſtence of
Spirits argu'd for. To diſpute about the Manner or Mean, where the
Meſſenger is wicked, or the Meſſage falſe, wou'd be needleſs. The
Means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by Spirits may be thought to gueſs at Things future, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
in ſeveral Inſtances. That the Illuſions of <hi>Sedechias</hi> the
deceitful <hi>Jew,</hi> preſented before <hi>Lewis</hi> the Emperor; and of
others, ought not to ſeem ſtrange, ſince the Works of God are far more
deep: And ſince <hi>Scotto</hi> the <hi>Italian</hi> Jug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger could play
ſuch Slights before Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> that thoſe who undertook to
diſcry them were no leſs beguiled than the reſt, who preſumed leſs
upon their own Penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, 'tis thought we may deem Familiars to be more fine
and nimble. Further, of theſe incorporeal Meſſengers, as the
<hi>Demon</hi> of <hi>Socrates,</hi> the Spirit that daily called upon
<hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laricus,</hi> and that named <hi>Orthon,</hi> which brought Intelligence
from all Corners of the World to <hi>Gaſton</hi> Earl of <hi>Foix,</hi> as
<hi>Froiſſart</hi> has at large (and perhaps too largely) related. Some
Arguments in defence of Familiars, and wicked Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, conſider'd, and
refuted: But the Abettors of this Art being at a Nonplus for want of Reaſons
to defend the ſame, appeal to the pretended Apparition of <hi>Samuel</hi>;
and tell us that as the Sorcereſs called him up, ſo ſurely may the
Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurers of theſe Times invoke the Souls of godly Men. But 
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0570200100:369"/> our Author denies that it was the real <hi>Samuel.</hi>
If it be urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Why are Conjurers ſometimes ſo deſirous of a dead Hand,
as <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was accuſed to have cut off that of
<hi>Arſenius</hi> to abuſe with magical Practices; or that a Hair, a Pin,
<hi>&amp;c.</hi> is deſired by wicked Spirits and Witches, of the Parties
they would have Power over? 'Tis anſwer'd, the Gift is naked and impotent,
unleſs veſted with Conſent: The Hand no more able to ſway the Soul,
than the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle of a Ship to guide the Stern; that the Belief is rather
craved than the Benevolence; the Heart than the Hand; the Truſt than the
Token. That the Souls of Men indeed ſleep not after death, but Bodies do; and
ſhall not be awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before the Knell which rings all in to Condemnation or
Paradiſe: Wherefore he concludes, That neither Souls nor Bodies can appear to
Conjurers but by a Figure or Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Illuſion, ſo far as it may take a
ſeeming Colour by the Practice of our Enemy; and ſhews how unlikely it is
in the Caſe of <hi>Samuel,</hi> That either God ſhould ſuffer a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet
of his own chuſing to turn Deceiver, as <hi>Samuel</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly had been,
had he deliver'd himſelf to <hi>Saul</hi> in ſuch Terms as the Spirit did,
or that the Devil by his niceſt Art could reſtore a Body to its former
Shape, which was long before this diſſolved to Duſt and Aſhes.</p>
               <p>Chap. VI. <hi>Of the Cabaliſtick Art.</hi> Its Antiquity,
Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and why ſo called. The two Species thereof defined. From theſe
Definitions hardly conceivable, how this Art can afford either Help or Credit
to the Prophet. Here we have an Account of the Conference held by our noble
Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, ſix Years before, with one <hi>Brocado</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> then in
the Court, who was a Pretender to this whimſical Art of expounding the
Scriptures; and from thence took upon him to divine what Fortune ſhould
betide the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> as he ſaid he had foretold what ſhould
befall <hi>Paris,</hi> at leaſt five Years before the Maſſacre fell out.
But our Author, among other Arguments, told him, 
<q rend="inline">"That Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples which fell out by Chance, were
never current where the Cauſe was to be juſtified by Reaſon: And
therefore, till he could as readily product a certain Ground to make his
Gueſſes good, as ſcore up a Regiſter of blind Events, I muſt (ſays
he) rather praiſe his Luck than his Learning; for as well might he
prognoſticate that the <hi>Cock-pit</hi> in <hi>Shoe-lane</hi> ſhould
ſink on the third of <hi>June,</hi> becauſe a Theatre fell down about that
time at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Reign of <hi>Claudius</hi>; as that either
<hi>Antwerp</hi> or <hi>Paris</hi> 
                     <pb n="341" facs="tcp:0570200100:370"/> ſhould be plagued
by the Pattern of <hi>Edom</hi> or <hi>Samaria.</hi> We may be generally taught
by the Precedents of God's righteous Judgments upon former States, that
whoſoever ſins or tranſgreſſes againſt either Table of the Moral
Law, ſhould either be corrected by his Juſtice, or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne by his Mercy;
but by whether of theſe Means God purpoſeth to cure the Carbuncle of Man's
Iniquity is concealed from our Knowledge, and therefore were it vain to gueſs
what his Pleaſure is to execute. The ſafeſt Courſe is to ſuſpect
the worſt, becauſe Extremities are due; but yet we cannot determine and

               <p>Chap. VII. <hi>Of the Scripture Authorities for
Prognoſtication.</hi> Shewing how, in ſeveral Inſtances, it is there
prohibited. The falſity of the Aſſertion made by the Pretenders to
theſe Arts, That they never make Enquiries into any thing unlawful. The
<hi>High German</hi>'s Proof of the Certainty of Star-Divinity, in the Warning
given to Frier <hi>Savanorola,</hi> by <hi>Bellantius</hi> the Aſtrologer,
expoſed; evidencing how vain and ineffectual ſuch Warnings are; ſince
what is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by Deſtiny, cannot be prevented by Intelligence. Then the
Enquiry is made, Whether the Warning that this Frier ſhould be put out of the
way for Hereſy were true or not? If he affirm it to be true, then muſt he
grant that Doctrine to be Hereſy which himſelf and his Country main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
againſt <hi>Rome: That the Pope's Pardons are of no Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. That he abuſes
his Authority,</hi> &amp;c. For theſe were the Matters in defence whereof
<hi>Savanorola</hi> died: If he deny theſe Articles to deſerve the Name or
Note of Hereſy, which either he muſt do or confeſs himſelf a Heretick;
then it is evident that <hi>Bellantius</hi> was very much beguiled in
be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving or advertiſing that <hi>Savanorola</hi> ſhould be ſwept away
for ungodly Doctrine. The Caſe is paſſing hard, which drives a Man either
to renounce his Faith, or to forſake his Fancy. Were there a Regiſter among
the Stars, we need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to ſeek the Scripture for our Order, but the
Planets for our Fortune. In the Moderns, to ſay, they regard the Stars, as
Means only, by which God brings his Decrees to paſs, and ſo ought not to be
ſet upon a Level with the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, who look'd upon them as Gods; will not
ſerve, and wherefore. Obſervations on the two next Centuries after
<hi>Chriſt</hi> being rifeſt with Miracles, as the Air is warmeſt at the
ſetting of the Sun, and the People apter to believe the Gifts and Doctrine of
Miracles, the freſher their Sufferings <pb n="342" facs="tcp:0570200100:371"/> were who
propagated them. The Antiquity of <hi>Aſtrology</hi> examined, with its
Derivation. The Singularity of <hi>Porphiry;</hi> who alone of all the
Philoſophers gave into it. And the vain Aſſertion of <hi>Melanchton,</hi>
That <hi>Moſes, Eſſay, &amp;c.</hi> impugn not all kind of Divination,
but rather the Pride of Man, in preſuming to underſtand thoſe Secrets
which are reſerved to God alone, as the <hi>Laſt-Day,</hi> &amp;c. The
Objections drawn from Scripture, as <hi>Moſes</hi> being learned in the
Myſteries of <hi>Egypt;</hi> and from theſe Words, <hi>Mine Hour is not yet
come,</hi> &amp;c. and from the Star which conducted the wiſe Men at the
Birth of <hi>Chriſt</hi>; conſider'd, and anſwer'd. <hi>Cardan</hi>'s
Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in aſſigning the Hour of that Birth; with the fooliſh reaſoning
of him, and others, from the Face of the Heavens at that time. The Knowledge of
<hi>Seth, Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> urged in vain, ſince their Remarks of the
heavenly Orbs tended to the Knowledge of their Courſes, Eclipſes, &amp;c.
for the Diſtinction of Times and Seaſons, ſo needful in the Obſervance
of their religious Feaſts and Ceremonies: Wherefore ſome have gather'd from
certain Expreſſions in Scripture, That the Tribe of <hi>Iſſachar</hi>
was bound by Order, to the Study of the Stars; as divers Colleges in
<hi>Cambridge</hi> are enjoin'd by the Statutes of the Founders, to give
Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to certain Perſons for this End.</p>
               <p>The Remainder of the Volume is a Collection of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
Authorities, and Hiſtories further detecting the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſions of theſe
pretended Prophets, and their Ambition in all times, of ſupplanting what is
certain in God's Providence by what is probable in Man's Conjecture. Their
Subtilty herein further laid open. Their little Arts, Shifts, and
E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocations to gain themſelves Profit and Honour, where they happen to be
lucky in their Predictions; and ſhelter or ſubterfuge, where they anſwer
not what they had raiſed the Apprehenſions of Mankind to expect; with
abundance of Examples to prove how juſtly ſuch preſumptuous Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
deſerve the Deteſtation of all ſober and ingenuous Men; as conducing to
the Miſcarriage of ſo many Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takings, which have depended on their
Authority. Alſo pointing out the various Means of diſcerning ſuch
Counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feits; which by how much more ſucceſsfully they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded the
Generality in all Ages paſt, ſhould ſo much more effectually arm the
Future with Precaution. Among theſe Examples in this concluding Part, we
cannot be here fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther particular than to mention thoſe of
<hi>Manfredus</hi> the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrologer, who promiſed an <hi>Italian</hi> Prince
many Years Life, <pb n="343" facs="tcp:0570200100:372"/> and that he himſelf ſhould live to
diſcover many Wonders by his Art, but died in the approaching Spring before
he could declare them. The Experiment of the Earl of <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> who
would note in his Almanacks, the Changes of the Weather, every where contrary
to what had been aſſerted by the Writers of them; and found his own
Predictions oftner true than theirs. The Perſages of Dearth in 1558 confuted,
by its proving a plentiful Year. The Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Abbot</hi>
who built him a Houſe on <hi>Harrow-Hill,</hi> to ſecure him from the
threatned Deluge, when it proved a Year of great Drought. The Deluſions, by
Figures and Images, in the old painted Manuſcripts, and in the Herald's
Books, and thoſe pretended to be preſerved in religious Houſes; as
<hi>Merlin</hi>'s Prophecies, which were chain'd to the Desks in many
Libraries. The Uſe made of Women in theſe prophetick Cozenages: Thus
<hi>Montanus</hi> wrought by <hi>Maximilla,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> by their
<hi>Pucelle de Dieu,</hi> and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Anabaptiſts by their
<hi>Holy Maid of</hi> Kent. The vain Preſumption of <hi>Verdungus</hi> a
Prophet in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. Inſtances of the Ruin of
ſeveral Princes by adhering to the Advice of Magicians, Aſtrologers, and
Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. Other late Inſtances of ſome learned <hi>Engliſh</hi> Men
deluded thereby: How <hi>Bellantius,</hi> who predicted <hi>Savano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rola</hi>'s
Execution, could not foreſee his own. When Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Wolſey</hi>
ſuperſtitiouſly avoided <hi>Kingſton</hi> upon <hi>Thames,</hi> tho'
his ready Way from <hi>Aſher</hi> to the Court, for a quibbling Prophecy,
that <hi>Kingſton ſhould be his End:</hi> Was it not a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Prophecy? For
even Sir <hi>Anthony Kingſton,</hi> to whoſe Cuſtody the Cardinal was
committed, proved not his End, nor brought him to the Tower, as he was charged;
for he died of his Illneſs at <hi>Leiceſter.</hi> And the Rood of
<hi>Darvill Gathren,</hi> how did it burn a <hi>Forreſt,</hi> according to
the <hi>Welſh</hi> Prophecy that it ſhould? When in ſcorn to
ſuperſtition, the Lord <hi>Cromwell</hi> burnt a Fryer with that Image. But
we might quote half the Book to mention the Examples of this kind, wherewith it
is all over ſo elaborately embelliſh'd; which would have been much eaſier
commanded, had it been furniſhed with a <hi>Table</hi> or <hi>Index,</hi>
whereof the ſecond Edition in Fol. 1620. is alſo deficient; but we hope it
will be ſupply'd therewith, if ever this Work arrives at a Third.</p>

               <p>THIS Collection of Antiquities is adorn'd with a neat
Frontiſpiece, repreſenting the Figures of Death and the Reſurrection:
Alſo with another Sculpture of the Author, in a laced Cap, with his Hand on a
Skull; round the ſame there is an Inſcription in <hi>Latin,</hi> ſhewing
that he was fifty five Years of Age at this time that the ſaid Work was
publiſh'd; and at the bottom, four <hi>Engliſh</hi> Verſes, informing us
he was born in <hi>Lancaſhire,</hi> and educated in the Univerſity of
<hi>Cambridge:</hi> Both which Prints were engraved by <hi>Thomas
Cecil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Work is inſcribed by the Author to King <hi>Charles</hi>;
and in his Preface or Epiſtle to the Reader we find he had not only
obſerved what Honour Foreign Nations had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by thus putting into print
their monumental Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, but that he had with painful Expences travell'd
over moſt Parts of <hi>England,</hi> and ſome Part of <hi>Scotland</hi> to
collect the Funeral Inſcriptions of all the Cathedral and Parochial Churches:
But being much diſcouraged to proceed by the many malignant and avaricious
Defacements he beheld of thoſe venerable Remains, and the many Obſtructions
and Troubles he met with from petulent Officers and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardens for want of
a Commiſſion, he had Thoughts of burying all in ſilence, till he was
animated afreſh, to pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh <pb n="345" facs="tcp:0570200100:374"/> what he had thus

                  <hi>Windſor</hi>
Herald and Keeper of the Records in the Tower; Sir <hi>Robert Cotton,</hi>

<hi>H. Spelman,</hi> Sir <hi>Simon D'Ewes, John Selden</hi> 
                  <abbr>Eſq</abbr>
beſides Sir <hi>Richard</hi> and Sir <hi>Henry St. George, John Philpot</hi>
and <hi>W. Le Neve</hi> Eſqrs. From all whom he had Aſſiſtance, which
encouraged him thus to finiſh this firſt Part; and to compleat the reſt
of the Work, now in good forwardneſs, he intreats the Communications of the
Publick<note n="*" place="bottom">But the Reaſon why we had not the Author's
ſaid Continua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Work, was, that he died the next Year after this
firſt Part was printed, as <hi>Anthony Wood</hi> informs us.</note>. The
remainder of this Epiſtle contains Advice to the Tomb-makers; that they would
be careful to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Inſcriptions which they engrave; with ſome
Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies for extolling the ardent Piety of our Forefathers in theſe their
Eccleſiaſtical Liberalities; and for the Method he has purſued; his
Punctuality in following the ancient Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphy; and the Poſſibility of
ſome Errors which may have eſcaped, thro' his having had the Helps and
Collections of many; and others, thro' the common Fate of the Preſs; whereof
the greateſt he had met with he has amended<note n="†" place="bottom">But there are yet left ſeveral, which are very material;

Book; as another Reaſon is, to oblige <hi>hiſtorical</hi> Readers with the
Notice of many eminent Perſons characteriſed therein, from ancient and

<hi>Chytraeus,</hi> warning us, from the Funerals of ſo many others in one
Book, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Certainty of our own.</p>
               <p>Then follows <hi>The Diſcourſe of Funeral Monuments,</hi>

Dioceſſe, which is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Narrative of the Archbiſhops of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> who were canonized Saints; beginning with St.
<hi>Auſtin,</hi> and the fabulous Legend of the Judgment upon the Natives of
a Town in <hi>Dorſetſhire,</hi> who diſregarding his Doctrine were born
with Fiſhes Tails, as written by <hi>Alex. Eſſeby</hi>; and thoſe of
<hi>Strode</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> for a Contempt of <hi>Tho. Becket</hi> and
his Horſe, in cutting off his Tail, born with Tails of Horſes or other
Beaſts, according to the fooliſh Aſſertion of <hi>Pol. Virgil.</hi>
Theſe Archbiſhops thus canonized, of whom we have here a ſhort Hiſtory
or Character, are thirteen in number, ending with St. <hi>Edmund,</hi> who died
1242. And this Part concludes at Page 307, with ſome Obſervations upon the
Enlargement of the Archbiſhoprick, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions between
<hi>Canterbury</hi> and <hi>York</hi> for the Primacy. Hence we paſs to</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ancient Funeral Monuments within the Dioceſſe of</hi>
RO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHESTER. 
<q rend="inline">"This Biſhoprick, ſays our Author, is ſo
over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed by the nearneſs and greatneſs of the See of
<hi>Canterbury,</hi> that it looks but like a good Benefice for one of his
Grace's Chaplains; yet for Antiquity and Dignity of a long Succeſſion of
Reverend Lord Biſhops, it may equally compare with its Neighbour of
<hi>Canterbury.</hi>"</q> For they had both one Founder, <hi>Ethelbert</hi>
King of <hi>Kent</hi>; who built this Church to the Honour of St.
<hi>Andrew,</hi> and endowed it; whereof <hi>Juſtus</hi> a <hi>Roman</hi> was
conſecrated Biſhop by St. <hi>Auguſtine.</hi> Here follows a ſhort
Deſcription <pb n="351" facs="tcp:0570200100:380"/> of the City; the Limits of the
Dioceſſe, and the four Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries it conſiſts of: The Valuation in the
Exchequer; Firſt-fruits, and <hi>Peter</hi>-Pence: That eighty one Biſhops
(more by nine than in <hi>Canterbury</hi>) have ſate in the Chair of
<hi>Rocheſter;</hi> and the preſent Biſhop is Dr. <hi>John Bowles</hi>;
but more particularly of the three firſt Succeſſors of <hi>Juſtus,</hi>
named <hi>Paulinus, Gundulphus,</hi> and <hi>Gilbertus,</hi> who were bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
here, tho' no Monuments remain of them. Then we come to <hi>Walter de
Merton</hi> Biſhop of this See, who founded <hi>Merton</hi> College in
<hi>Oxford</hi>; whoſe Monument here was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed by Sir <hi>Henry
Savile</hi> Warden of that College; and by the Inſcription thereon, it
appears the ſaid Biſhop died 1277. After three Biſhops more, here
mention'd, our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor obſerves, That he finds no more of this Dioceſſe
to have been buried in this Cathedral Church; becauſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly they were
removed to another See, before they were tranſlated to another Life, this
Preferment being only a Step to a higher: Therefore after a Word or two of St.
<hi>William</hi> the Baker and Martyr, here inſhrined from
<hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grave;</hi> and the like of the Priory, our Author proceeds to other
Churches, the reſt of the Funeral Monuments in this, being of later Times;
which he reſerves for another Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume. At <hi>Ailesford,</hi> we have an

here; as the ſpringing a Well out of dry Ground; enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no Nightingale to

as true doubtleſs as that other pious Prohibition of any Smith to thrive in

the Victories of the <hi>Kentiſh</hi> Men over the <hi>Danes</hi> in

brings us, at Page 349, to an End of the Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon this little See

               <p>AT the Beginning of this Edition (for the Book was firſt
publiſhed in Twelves, 1650, without any Figures or Prints, but one in the
Front, of divers diſtorted or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed <pb n="365" facs="tcp:0570200100:394"/> Heads and
Faces) there is prefix'd a comely Sculp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Author Dr. <hi>John
Bulwer,</hi> engraved by <hi>W. Faithorne</hi>; and likewiſe another Title of
the Book, not much differing from the true Title above, but ſeemingly added
by the Printer to advance the univerſal reading of the Author, being
entitled, <hi>A View of the People of the whole World,</hi> &amp;c. Next we
have a Device in <hi>Sculpture,</hi> repreſenting the awful <hi>Tribunal</hi>
of <hi>Nature,</hi> by Commiſſion from <hi>Heaven,</hi> trying the
<hi>artificial Changeling,</hi> or Miſcreants of all <hi>Nations,</hi> for
the abuſe of their Bodies; with a ſhort Explanation. Then follows a
Specimen of the Author's Poetry, in an <hi>Anacephalaeoſis</hi> or
Recapitulation of his Work, intimated by the Frontiſpiece; wherein he briefly
recounts the many Scoffs and Rapes made on the natural Form of the Human Body.
After this we have the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Dedication to his Friend <hi>Thomas
Diconſon;</hi> and likewiſe ſeveral epiſtolary Poems, ſome in
<hi>Latin,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> to the Author in honour of
his Perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; one of theſe is written by <hi>Francis Goldſmith,</hi>
ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Adolet Hogereſa</hi> of <hi>High Croſs.</hi> There is alſo a
Letter to the Author from <hi>R. Maſon</hi> of the <hi>Middle Temple,</hi>
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the Ground of all Man's Prevarications. Next follows a ſhort
Hint of the Uſe of this Treatiſe; alſo an anonymous Piece of
<hi>Latin</hi> Poetry, called <hi>Diploma Apollinis,</hi> being a <hi>Bull</hi>
or <hi>Writ</hi> of <hi>Apollo</hi> for tranſlating the Author to the
<hi>Celeſtial</hi> Orb. After, a Liſt of near 300 Authors, Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,
Phyſicians, Anatomiſts, Travellers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> referr'd to in this
Work, we come to the <hi>Introduction</hi>; which highly extols the native
Beauty and Excellency of the human Fabrick; ſhews the Impiety of varying from
Nature; and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved Figures introduced thereby; 
<q rend="inline">"inſomuch," ſays the Author, "that it may
ſeem the firſt Men only were made by God, but the reſt were of Mens
Invention: And," continues he, "while we diſpute in Schools, whether if it
were poſſible, it were lawful for Man to deſtroy any one Species of God's
Creatures, tho' but of <hi>Toads</hi> and <hi>Spiders</hi>; Becauſe this were
a taking away one Link of God's Chain, one Note of his Harmony; we have taken
away the Jewel at that Chain."</q> He then recommends my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s
Opinion of the Helps towards Beauty, and good Features, and reducing the
Blemiſhes of Perſons to their natural State: And ſo introduces his
Work.</p>
               <p>The Work itſelf is repreſented in 24 Scenes, and is all along
illuſtrated with wooden Prints, of the Forms and <pb n="366" facs="tcp:0570200100:395"/>

               <p>We have now gone thro' the 24 Chapters of this Treatiſe, upon
which it will be needleſs here to add any Panegyrick, ſince whoever has
read it, can't but be acquainted with the Author's Skill and Accuracy in the
Philoſophy of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Fabrick, as well as his Wit and Humour in
cenſuring the depray'd and pragmatical Inventions of Men. We will therefore
take a View of his APPENDIX, <hi>exhibiting the</hi> PEDIGREE <hi>of the</hi>
ENGLISH GALLANT, which he thought proper to annex, (having firſt proſecuted
his principal Deſign) to anſwer the Expectation of the Publick, who thought
him neceſſarily engag'd to touch upon the Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of Apparel, of which
almoſt every Scene afforded emergent Occaſion; herein explaining the
Proverb, <hi>God makes, but the Taylor ſhapes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and the more civiliz'd Nations, had
hitherto in a great meaſure eſcaped his Sentences of <hi>Treaſon</hi>
againſt <hi>Nature,</hi> whereof many others were convicted; yet here they
muſt bear to have their affected Vanities laid before them; 
<q rend="inline">"It were not impoſſible," ſays he, "to
prove, that there was never any Conceit ſo extravagant, that ever forced the
Rules of Nature; or Faſhion ſo mad, which fell into the Imaginations of any
of theſe indicted Nations, that may not meet with ſome publick Faſhion of
Apparel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, and ſeem to be grounded upon the ſame pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
Reaſon."</q> Our Sugar-Loaf Hats, he attributes to the ſame Conceit as the
Sugar-Loaf Heads of Foreign Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; our ſquare Caps are owing to their
ſquare Heads; our flat Caps to their flat Heads; our <hi>French</hi> Hoods
imitate the <hi>Unicorn-like Dreſs</hi> of Hair among the barbarous
<hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians:</hi> He then ſhews the foreign Extraction of our Masks,
Painting, and Black-Patches, our Pendents and auricular Bravery; our
Peaſe-cod-bellied Doublets emulare the <hi>Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> and
<hi>Muſcovite</hi> Faſhion, and other <hi>Gorbellied</hi> Nations. The
ſlaſhing and pincking our Doublets, our Cod-Piece Faſhion, and
Trunk-Hoſe have all their Semblances in <hi>Barbarian</hi> Nations; as
likewiſe our indecent Faſhion of naked Breaſts and Shoulders, our vain
and fooliſh Verdin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gales <pb n="372" facs="tcp:0570200100:401"/> (or Hoops:) Our affected long
Shoes, our broad Shoes (which in Queen <hi>Mary</hi>'s Time occaſion'd a
Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that no Man ſhould wear his Shoes above ſix Inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches
ſquare at the Toes) and our high Shoes have all their Original from abroad.
The Vanity of diſguiſing our Shapes is alſo farther expoſed by ſome
poetical Quotations from <hi>Alex. Barclay</hi>'s Tranſlation of the <hi>Ship
of Fools</hi>; and from an ingenious old Comedy in the Character of
<hi>Lupa.</hi> He then concludes the Appendix with this apt Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, 
<q rend="inline">"That whoever will reduce Cloaths and Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to
their true End, muſt fit them to the Service and Commodity of the Body,
whence dependeth their Original Grace, and Comelineſs, which can no way
better be done than by cutting them according to the natural Shape and
Proportion of the Body; as we may probably imagine the Skin-Garments were,
wherewith the Lord <hi>God,</hi> who beſt knew their Shape, firſt cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Nakedneſs of our <hi>firſt Parents.</hi>"</q> And he ſhews that we
ought not to allow Faſhions for their Rareneſs and Novelty, when Goodneſs
and Profit are not joined to them<note n="*" place="bottom">We think it not
improper to take Notice of a <hi>Catalogue</hi> of the Author's Works
ſubjoin'd to this Treatiſe; which are as follow: Works already publiſhed;
1. <hi>The natural Language of the Hand.</hi> 2. <hi>The Art of manual
Rhetorick.</hi> 3. <hi>The deaf and dumb Man's Friend.</hi> 4. <hi>A

            <p>THUS has the <hi>Britiſh Librarian</hi> given a Specimen of his
Undertaking, to the Extent of one Volume, in a diligent Abſtract of above
fifty of our Scarce, Uſeful, and Valuable Books. In the choice of them, tho'
here are ſome of conſiderable Valuation extracted; yet the high Price to
which many are advanced in the Shops, has been no Temptation for his making
that the Rule to prefer them. He has rather thought thoſe which are moſt
<hi>uſeful,</hi> the moſt <hi>valuable</hi>; and ſuch of them, as are
grown moſt <hi>ſcarce,</hi> moſt needful and deſerving of this
Recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Accordingly, 'tis not doubted but they will appear worthy of
it, by what is here advanced to the Reader's No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice from them; being all
fraught with much <hi>obſervable Matter,</hi> as may be eaſily perceived by
this Scheme, for compaſſing the readieſt Knowledge and Command thereof,
which may have eſcaped the Notice or Memory of ſeveral, who are even
poſſeſſed of the Books themſelves which contain it; and alſo give
Intelligence to others, of many remarkable <hi>Things, Places,</hi> and
<hi>Perſons</hi> which they would never otherwiſe have known; no Work, of
the like ſize a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, having pointed out ſuch a variety of thoſe
Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, or drawn into ſo cloſe a compaſs, the Subſtance of ſo
much Reading. He might perhaps have been more amuſing to ſome Readers, in
being more ample upon ſome parts of his Authors; by extracting Pages of
Controverſies, or Paragraphs of the pretty Stories, ſurprizing
Paſſages, or eloquent Speeches in them; but as many <hi>Topicks</hi> in an
Author muſt be ſacrificed to gratify a few Indulgences in this kind, and to
divert ſome, the Enquiries of abundance remain unſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd; the Plan has
been follow'd which was at firſt laid down, to make it a Work rather of
general <hi>Information,</hi> than particular <hi>Entertainment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Among the Books conducive to this Purpoſe, thoſe for which
Gratitude here demands chiefly the Publication of our Thanks, are the
<hi>Manuſcripts.</hi> Such in the firſt place, is that here call'd, Sir
<hi>Thomas Wriotheſly's Collections</hi>; contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <pb n="374" facs="tcp:0570200100:403"/>
the <hi>Arms</hi> and <hi>Characters</hi> of the <hi>Knights of the
Garter,</hi> and <hi>Views</hi> of the ancient <hi>Ceremonies</hi> uſed in
<hi>Creating</hi> the <hi>Knights of the Bath,</hi> &amp;c. For that Sketch
which the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarian</hi> has here given the <hi>Publick</hi> of it, they
are both be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holden to the Permiſſion of his Grace the Duke of
<hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagu,</hi> the noble Owner of that valuable Volume;and to ſome
Explanations thereof, which were alſo courteouſly imparted by <hi>John
Anſtis</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> 
               <hi>Garter,</hi> Principal <hi>King of
Arms,</hi> whoſe extenſive Knowlege in theſe Subjects, his own elaborate
Publications, in honour of both thoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, have ſufficiently confirm'd.
Nor will it be thought a Repitition unneceſſary, by grateful Minds, that
the <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brarian</hi> here renews his Acknowledgments to <hi>Nathaniel
Booth</hi> 
               <abbr>Eſq</abbr> of <hi>Gray's-Inn,</hi> for his repeated
Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; having been favour'd not only with that curious
<hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellany,</hi> containing many of the old Earl of <hi>Derby</hi>'s
Papers, which, in one of the foregoing Numbers is abridg'd; but others out of
his choice Collections, which may enrich ſome future Numbers, when
Opportunity ſhall permit the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents thereof to appear. Other Manuſcripts
herein deſcribed, were partly the Collection of Mr. <hi>Charles Grimes,</hi>
late, alſo of <hi>Gray's-Inn,</hi> and in the Bookſeller's
Poſſeſſion for whom this Work is printed; except one ancient Relique of
the famous <hi>Wicklife,</hi> for the uſe of which, many Thanks are here
return'd to Mr. <hi>Joſeph Ames,</hi> Member of the <hi>Society of
Antiquaries.</hi> The Author of this Work is moreover obliged to the Library of
this laſt worthy Preſerver of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquities, as alſo to that of his
ingenious Friend Mr. <hi>Peter Thompſon,</hi> for the uſe of ſeveral
<hi>printed Books</hi> which are more ſcarce than many Manuſcripts;
particularly ſome, ſet forth by our firſt Printer in <hi>England</hi>;
and others, which will riſe, among the Curious, in Value, as, by the
Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of Accident, or Ignorance, they decreaſe in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. We muſt
take ſome further Opportunity to expreſs our Obligations to other Gentlemen
who have favour'd us with ſuch like Litterary Curioſities; and to ſome
hundreds unknown, who have ſhewn a reliſh for the Uſefulneſs of this
Performance, by encouraging the Sale of it.</p>
            <p>There can be added nothing more for the Reader's fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
Convenience, to this general Table or <hi>Contents,</hi> but an Alphabetical
<hi>Index</hi> to it; as a Maſter-Key that will give immediate recourſe to
thoſe Topicks, in ſo many Volumes thus abſtracted, which had been lock'd
up, or ſecreted from their Knowledge to whom they would have been uſeful. 
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:0570200100:404"/> And as from thoſe <hi>ancient Springs</hi> it is
hereby obvious to all Readers, what a <hi>new River</hi> of Intelligence is
conducted for their Benefit; ſo the Author (from the Example of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in
ſuch-like Attempts) may be ſure of that Satisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which ariſes from
the Contemplation of having been inſtrumental to ſo much publick Good.
Thoſe who know the nature of ſuch Works, may think one Volume,
com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending the principal Matters in ſuch a Library of Books, and near one
half of them Folios, expeditiouſly publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed within the Space of one Year:
But as, in <hi>Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this kind,</hi> the moſt induſtrious Part,
is that which is moſt inviſible, and the Fatigue is accounted of, from the
ſmall Quantity of Writing which appears, not the vaſt and unſeen Maſs
of Reading required therein; the Operation is apt to be thought dilatory, by
thoſe who are unacquainted with the Labour of it. And for the ſame
Reaſon, that they convey the Mind to ſuch multifarious Advantages of
Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, their own Merits alſo are uſually diſregarded by the
Generality, who are unexperienc'd in the Execution, but enjoy the Advantages of
the Work. Like thoſe who look down with Admiration, at the Coſt and Pains
which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon the curious Compartments into which a Piece of
Ground is divided, and the flow'ry Groups, the verdant Mazes, or the fragrant
Bowers wherewith it is adorn'd; yet overlook thoſe artificial Mounts and
Terras Walks, which they are at that inſtant upon, which give them all that
Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over this Variety of Proſpects, and are indeed, the moſt
expenſive and laborious Ornaments in the Garden.</p>
            <p>All we ſhall ſay more of our <hi>Librarian,</hi> is, If he is
pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd on to proceed, in cultivating this Undertaking with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Intermiſſion, he will continue his utmoſt Pains to make it anſwer all
the Accommodations propoſed from it: Or if thro' other Engagements it
ſhould be ſuffer'd to lie fallow for a Seaſon, 'tis in hopes of
increaſing its Vigour, and making the Returns equivalent to the Toils
thereof.</p>
