            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0202101000:8"/>and the Manner, by which it acts.</p>
            <p>CONTAGION is propagated by three Cauſes, the <hi>Air; Diſeaſed Perſons;</hi> and <hi>Goods tranſported from infected Places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE ſhall therefore firſt enquire what alteration of the <hi>Air</hi> it is, that makes it <hi>inſections;</hi> and then, by what Means it communicates its noxious Quality to other Bodies.</p>
            <p>THE ancienteſt and beſt Authors of Phyſick, who lived in a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try more expoſed to theſe Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than ours, obſerved the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Air,</hi> which preceded <hi>Peſtilential Fevers,</hi> to be great <hi>Heats</hi> attended with much <hi>Rain</hi> and <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly Winds</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Hippocrat. Epidem. lib. 3.</note>: And one of Them takes particular Notice, that no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0202101000:9"/>than a <hi>moiſt</hi> and <hi>hot</hi> Tempera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>Air</hi> brings the <hi>Plague;</hi> and that the Duration of this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution is the Meaſure of the Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the Diſtemper
<note n="*" place="bottom">Galen. de Temperament. lib. 1. cap. 4. &amp; Comment. in Epid. l. 3.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE Natural Hiſtory of ſeveral Countries confirms this Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; in <hi>Africa</hi> particularly, if Show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers fall during the ſultry Heats of <hi>July</hi> and <hi>Auguſt,</hi> the <hi>Plague</hi> enſues thereupon, with which whoſoever is infected hardly eſcapes
<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. J. Leon. Hiſtor. Afric. lib. 1.</note>.</p>
            <p>IT has beſides been remarked in all Times, that the Stinks of <hi>ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating Waters</hi> in hot Weather, <hi>pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid Exhalations</hi> from the Earth; and above all, the Corruption of dead <hi>Carcaſſes</hi> lying unburied, have occaſioned <hi>infectious Diſeaſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:0202101000:10"/>
            <p>FROM hence it appears to be a <hi>Concurrence</hi> of Cauſes, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Diſeaſes of this Kind; which muſt not only meet, but exert their Force together for a conſiderable time. And when this happens, their firſt Effect is a Degree of <hi>Stag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi> in the Air, which is after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards followed by <hi>Corruption</hi> and <hi>Putrefaction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND upon this account it is, that thoſe Countries are chiefly liable to theſe Calamities, where not only the <hi>Heats</hi> are very great, and the <hi>Weather</hi> continues long in the ſame State; but the <hi>Winds</hi> (the Uſe of which is by Motion to purify the Air) do not ſhift and change ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as they do in Northern Climates.</p>
            <p>INDEED <hi>Plagues</hi> ſeem to be of the Growth of the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0202101000:11"/>Parts of the World, and to be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from them into colder Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates by the Way of <hi>Commerce.</hi> Nor do I think, that in this <hi>Iſland</hi> particularly there is any one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of a <hi>Peſtilential</hi> Diſeaſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us of great Conſequence; which we did not receive from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>infected</hi> Places.</p>
            <p>THIS I the rather mention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a common Opinion, and propagated by Authors of great Name, that we are uſually <hi>viſited</hi> with the <hi>Plague</hi> once in 30 or 40 Years; which is a mere Fancy with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Foundation either in Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Experience: and therefore People ought to be delivered from the Subjection to ſuch vain Fears.</p>
            <p>ON the contrary, though we have had ſeveral Strokes of this kind, yet there are Inſtances of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0202101000:12"/>bad <hi>Contagions</hi> from abroad being brought over to us, which have proved leſs malignant here by our Air not being diſpoſed to receive ſuch Impreſſions.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Sweating Sickneſs,</hi> called the <hi>Sudor Anglicus</hi> and <hi>Febris Ephemera Britannica,</hi> becauſe it was common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thought to have taken its Riſe here, was moſt probably of a foreign Original, and no other than a <hi>Plague</hi> abated in its Violence by the mild Temperament of our Climate.</p>
            <p>FOR, we learn from Hiſtories, that the firſt time this was felt here, which was in the Year 1485, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in the Army, with which King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. came from <hi>France,</hi> and landed in <hi>Wales</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Caium de Febre Ephemers Britannica.</note>; and it was then thought to have been brought
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0202101000:13"/>into <hi>France</hi> from the famous Siege of <hi>Rhodes</hi> by the <hi>Turks</hi> 3 or 4 Years before. And of the four Returns, which this has made ſince that Time; two, viz. <hi>thoſe</hi> in the Years 1527, and 1528, may very juſtly be ſuſpected to have been owing to the <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> which at thoſe Times raged in <hi>Italy,</hi> particularly at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> and <hi>Naples</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Rondinelli Contagio in Firenze, &amp; Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monte Hiſtor. di Napoli.</note>. And the others were very probably from a <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Infection.</p>
            <p>I call this Diſtemper a <hi>Plague</hi> with leſſened Force, becauſe the Symptoms of it were of that kind, though in a leſs Degree; as great <hi>Faintneſs</hi> and <hi>Inquietudes,</hi> inward <hi>Burning, Pain</hi> in the <hi>Head,</hi> a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lirium</hi> &amp;c. All which were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with profuſe <hi>Sweats,</hi> and the Diſeaſe laſted but 24 hours. And
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0202101000:14"/>though for want of Care and due Management many died of it; yet, as a learned and wiſe <hi>Hiſtorian</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Lord</hi> Verulam's <hi>Hiſtory of</hi> Henry VII.</note> obſerves, <hi>It appeared rather to be a ſurprize of Nature than obſtinate to Remedies, for if the Patient was kept warm with temperate Cordials, he commonly recovered.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND I cannot but take Notice, as a Confirmation of what I have been advancing, that we had here the ſame kind of Fever in the Year 1713, about the Month of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember,</hi> which was called the <hi>Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kirk Fever,</hi> as being brought by our Soldiers from that Place; where it was indeed a Malignant Diſeaſe attended with a <hi>Diarrhaea, Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> &amp;c. and probably had its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from the Peſtilential Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, which ſome time before broke
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0202101000:15"/>out at <hi>Dantzick</hi> and <hi>Hamburgh:</hi> But with us was much more mild, beginning only with a Pain in the Head, and by very eaſy Means went off in large <hi>Sweats,</hi> after a Day's Confinement.</p>
            <p>THERE being in every Air a greater Diſpoſition to <hi>Contagion</hi> at one Time than another, we have indeed ſometimes felt this Calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty with greater Fury; as particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the laſt time in the Year 1665; when it continued in this <hi>City</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ten Months, and ſwept away by computation 97306 Perſons: But it was generally allowed, that the <hi>Contagion</hi> came by <hi>Cotton</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported from <hi>Turkey</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vide Hodges de Peſte.</note>; and the long Duration of it, I believe, may juſtly be charged up the unhappy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of infected Houſes, which
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0202101000:16"/>was then directed by Publick Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority; as I ſhall ſhew anon.</p>
            <p>AND the Hiſtory of the moſt ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible of all the Plagues, that ever were in theſe Parts of the World, which was that in the Year 1349, gives a manifeſt Proof from whence all <hi>Europe</hi> may trace the Origine of theſe Evils, viz. from <hi>Aſia:</hi> for
<note n="†" place="bottom">Vid. Hiſtor. Fiorent. di Matteo Villani.</note> This taking its Riſe in <hi>China</hi> in the Year 1346, advanced through the Eaſt <hi>Indies</hi> to <hi>Syria, Turkey, Aegypt, Greece, Africa,</hi> &amp;c. In 1347 ſome Ships from the <hi>Levant</hi> carried it to <hi>Sicily, Piſa, Genoa,</hi> &amp;c. In 1348 it got into <hi>Savoy, Provence, Dauphiny, Catalonia, Caſtile,</hi> &amp;c. In 1349 it ſeized <hi>England, Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Ireland,</hi> and <hi>Flanders;</hi> and in the next place <hi>Germany, Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gary,</hi> and <hi>Denmark;</hi> and in all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0202101000:17"/>theſe Countries made moſt incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Havock.</p>
            <p>BUT to return to the Conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Air, which we left in a putrid State: It is to be obſerved, that Putrefaction is a kind of Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation, and that all Bodies in a Ferment emit a volatile active Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, of Power to agitate, and put into inteſtine Motions, that is, to change the Nature of other Flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ids into which it inſinuates it ſelf.</p>
            <p>IT were eaſy to ſhew from the beſt <hi>Theory</hi> of Fevers
<note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. Bellini de Febrib.</note>, how the Alterations made in the <hi>Blood</hi> this Way will favour <hi>Peſtilential</hi> Diſeaſes, by rendring the Body obnoxious to them: But the Digreſſion would be too great.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:0202101000:18"/>
            <p>THIS is one ſtep towards <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> The next, as it ſeems to me, proceeds after this Manner. The Blood in all <hi>Malignant Fevers,</hi> eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially <hi>Peſtilential</hi> ones, at the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter End of the Diſeaſe, does like Fermenting Liquors throw off a great Quantity of active Particles upon the ſeveral <hi>Glands</hi> of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, particularly upon thoſe of the Mouth and Skin, from which the Secretions are naturally the moſt conſtant and large. Theſe, in <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilential</hi> Caſes, although the Air be in a right State, will generally infect thoſe, who are very near to the ſick Perſon; otherwiſe are ſoon diſperſed and loſt: But when in an evil Diſpoſition of <hi>This</hi> they meet with the ſubtle Parts, its Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has generated, by uniting with them they become much more active and powerful, and likewiſe
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0202101000:19"/>more durable and laſting, ſo as to form an <hi>Infectious Matter</hi> capable of conveying the Miſchief to a great Diſtance from the diſeaſed Body, out of which it was produced.</p>
            <p>THEY who know what ſtrange Attractions and Combinations are made by volatile Spirits will under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this Reaſoning; eſpecially if they conſider, how eaſily all kinds of <hi>Effluvia</hi> are diffuſed in a warm Air, ſuch as we have deſcribed an Infectious one to be; and further, of how penetrating a Force the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Parts of Animal Juices are; of which the ſtrange Stench of a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified Limb, upon a Body yet liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, will convince any one.</p>
            <p>A corrupted State of Air is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt neceſſary to give theſe <hi>Contagious Atoms</hi> their full Force; for otherwiſe it were not eaſy to
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0202101000:20"/>conceive how the <hi>Plague,</hi> when once it had ſeized any Place, ſhould ever ceaſe, but with the Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all the Inhabitants: Which is readily accounted for by ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing an Emendation of the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the Air, and the reſtoring of it to a healthy State capable of diſſipating and ſuppreſſing the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand it is evident, that <hi>Infection</hi> is not received from the Air it ſelf, however prediſpoſed, without the Concurrence of ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing emitted from <hi>Infected</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; becauſe, by ſtrictly prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all Intercourſe of Infected Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces with the Neighbourhood, it may be effectually kept from ſpreading: Whereas the leaſt Wind muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily convey whatever noxious Quality reſides in the Air alone, even to a great Diſtance. Of this
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0202101000:21"/>we have had a freſh Proof in the preſent unhappy <hi>Plague</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> which, by keeping careful Guard, was confined for a conſiderable Time within the Walls of <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeilles;</hi> ſo that none of the adja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Villages ſuffered any thing by it; till at length ſome Perſons finding Means to eſcape carried the Infection along with them. And we find, they have been able, by the like Care, ſtill to reſtrain it within moderate Bounds.</p>
            <p>THIS is the Manner by which Infectious <hi>Effluvia</hi> are generated: The Way, by which a ſound Perſon receives the Injury, I ſuppoſe moſt commonly to be this. Theſe <hi>Conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious</hi> Particles being drawn in with the Air we breath, they taint in their Paſſage the <hi>Salival</hi> Juices, which being ſwallowed down into the Stomach preſently fix their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0202101000:22"/>there; as appears from the <hi>Nauſea</hi> and <hi>Vomiting,</hi> with which the Diſtemper often begins its firſt Attacks. Though I make no Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion but the <hi>Blood</hi> is alſo more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately affected by hurtful Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles being mixed through Inſpiration with it in the Lungs.</p>
            <p>THE third Way, by which we mentioned <hi>Contagion</hi> to be ſpread, is by <hi>Goods tranſported from infected Places.</hi> It has been thought ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to explain the Manner of <hi>this,</hi> that ſome Authors have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined <hi>Infection</hi> to be performed by the Means of <hi>Inſects,</hi> the <hi>Eggs</hi> of which may be conveyed from Place to Place, and make the Diſeaſe when they come to be <hi>hatched.</hi> As this is a ſuppoſition grounded upon no manner of Obſervation, ſo I think there is no need to have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to it. If, as we have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0202101000:23"/>the <hi>Matter of Contagion</hi> be an active Subſtance, perhaps in the Nature of a <hi>Salt,</hi> generated chiefly from the Corruption of a <hi>Humane Body,</hi> it is not hard to conceive how this may be lodged and preſerved in ſoft, porous Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, which are kept preſſed cloſe together.</p>
            <p>WE all know how long a time <hi>Perfumes</hi> hold their <hi>Scent,</hi> if wrapt up in proper Coverings: And it is very remarkable, that the ſtrongeſt of theſe, like the <hi>Matter</hi> we are treating of, are moſtly <hi>Animal</hi> Juices, as <hi>Moſch, Civet,</hi> &amp;c. and that the Subſtances found moſt fit to keep them in, are the very ſame with thoſe which are moſt apt to receive and communicate <hi>Infection,</hi> as, <hi>Furrs, Feathers, Silk, Hair, Wool, Cotton, Flax,</hi> &amp;c. the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Part of which are likewiſe of
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0202101000:24"/>the Animal Kind; which Remark alone may ſerve to lead Us a little into the true Nature of <hi>Contagion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>FROM all that has been ſaid, it appears, I think, very plainly, that the <hi>Plague</hi> is a real Poiſon, which being bred in the Eaſtern or South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Parts of the World, maintains it ſelf there by circulating from <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected</hi> Perſons to Goods; which is chiefly owing to the Negligence of the People in thoſe Countries, who are ſtupidly Careleſs in this Affair: That when the Conſtitution of the Air happens to favour Infection, it rages there with great Violence; That at that Time more eſpecially diſeaſed Perſons give it to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and <hi>Contagious Matter</hi> is lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Goods of a looſe and ſoft Texture, which being packt up, and carried into other Countries, let out, when opened, the impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0202101000:25"/>Seeds of Contagion: And laſtly, That the Air cannot diffuſe and ſpread theſe to any great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, if Intercourſe and Commerce with the Place infected be ſtrictly prevented.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>S it is a ſatisfaction to know, that the <hi>Plague</hi> is not a Native of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ſo this is likewiſe an Encouragement to the utmoſt Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in finding out Means to keep our ſelves clear from It.</p>
            <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0202101000:27"/>
            <p>THIS Caution conſiſts of two Parts: <hi>The preventing its being brought into our Iſland;</hi> And, if ſuch a Calamity ſhould happen, <hi>The putting a ſtop to its ſpreading among us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE firſt of theſe is provided for by the eſtabliſhed Method of obliging Ships, that come from <hi>Infected</hi> Places, to <hi>perform Quaren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine:</hi> As to which I think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, that the following Rules be obſerved.</p>
            <p>NEAR to our ſeveral Ports, there ſhould be <hi>Lazarettos</hi> built in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Places, on little Iſlands if it can ſo be, for the Reception both of Men and Goods, which arrive from Places ſuſpected of <hi>Infection:</hi> The keeping Men in <hi>Quarentine</hi> on board the Ship being not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient;
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0202101000:28"/>the only Uſe of which is to obſerve whether any dye among them. For <hi>Infection</hi> may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſo long in Cloaths, in which it is once lodged, that as much, nay more of it, if Sickneſs conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues in the Ship, may be brought on Shoar at the End than at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the 40 Days: Unleſs a new <hi>Quarentine</hi> be begun every time any Perſon dies; which might not end, but with the Deſtruction of the whole Ship's Crew.</p>
            <p>IF there has been any <hi>Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Diſtemper in the Ship; The <hi>Sound</hi> Men ſhould leave their Cloaths; which ſhould be burnt; the Men waſhed and ſhaved; and having freſh Cloaths, ſhould ſtay in the <hi>Lazaretto</hi> 30 or 40 Days. The reaſon of this is, becauſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be recovered from a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe themſelves, and yet retain
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0202101000:29"/>
               <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Infection</hi> about them a conſiderable Time; as we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſee the <hi>Small-Pox</hi> taken from thoſe, who have ſeveral Days before paſſed through the Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>Sick,</hi> if there be any, ſhould be kept in Houſes remote from the <hi>Sound;</hi> and ſome time after they are well, ſhould alſo be waſhed and ſhaved, and have freſh Cloaths; whatever they wore while Sick be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnt: And then being remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Houſes of the <hi>Sound,</hi> ſhould continue there 30 or 40 days.</p>
            <p>I am particularly careful to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Cloaths</hi> of the Sick, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they Harbour the very <hi>Quint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſſence</hi> of <hi>Contagion.</hi> A very inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious Author
<note n="*" place="bottom">Boccaccio Decameron. Giornat. prim.</note> in his admirable
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0202101000:30"/>Deſcription of the <hi>Plague</hi> at <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence</hi> in the Year 1348, relates what himſelf ſaw: That two <hi>Hogs</hi> finding in the Streets the <hi>Rags,</hi> which had been thrown out from off a poor Man dead of the Diſeaſe, after ſnuffling upon them, and tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them with their Teeth, fell into Convulſions, and dyed in leſs than an Hour.</p>
            <p>IF there has been no Sickneſs in the Ship, I ſee no reaſon why the Men ſhould perform <hi>Quarentine.</hi> Inſtead of this, they may be waſhed, and their Cloaths aired in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zaretto,</hi> as Goods, for one Week.</p>
            <p>But the greateſt Danger is from ſuch <hi>Goods,</hi> as are apt to retain In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, ſuch as <hi>Cotton, Hemp</hi> and <hi>Flax, Paper</hi> or <hi>Books, Silk</hi> of all ſorts, <hi>Linen, Wool, Feathers, Hair,</hi> and all kinds of <hi>Skins.</hi> The <hi>Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:0202101000:31"/>for theſe ſhould be at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from that for the Men, and they muſt in convenient Ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes be unpackt, and expoſed, as much as may be, to the freſh Air for 40 Days.</p>
            <p>THIS may perhaps ſeem too long; but as we don't know how much Time preciſely is neceſſary to purge the Interſtices of Spongy Subſtances from <hi>infectious Matter</hi> by freſh Air, the Caution cannot be too great in this Point: Unleſs there could be a Way found out, without hazard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men's Lives, of trying when Bodies have done emitting the Noxious Fumes; which poſſibly might be done by putting tender <hi>Animals</hi> near to them, particularly by ſetting little <hi>Birds</hi> upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed Goods; becauſe it has been obſerved in Times of the <hi>Plague,</hi> that the Country has been forſaken
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0202101000:32"/>by the <hi>Birds;</hi> and thoſe kept in Houſes have many of them dyed
<note n="*" place="bottom">Diemerbroeck de Peſte, L. 1. C. 4.</note>. But the Uſe of this Fancy Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience only muſt ſhew; for I am well aware, that all <hi>Plagues</hi> do not indifferently affect all Kinds of liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Creatures; on the contrary, moſt are confined to a particular <hi>Species</hi> of them; like the Diſeaſe of the <hi>Black Cattle</hi> a few Years ſince, which neither proved Infectious to other Brutes, nor to Men.</p>
            <p>I take it for granted, that the <hi>Goods</hi> ſhould be <hi>opened,</hi> when they are put into the <hi>Lazaretto,</hi> other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their being there will avail nothing. The Misfortune, which happened in the Iſland of <hi>Bermudas</hi> about 25 Years ſince, gives a Proof of this; where, as the Account
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0202101000:33"/>has been given me by the learned Dr. <hi>Halley,</hi> a Sack of <hi>Cotton,</hi> put on Shoar by Stealth, lay above a Month without any Prejudice to the People of the Houſe, where it was hid; but when it came to be diſtributed among the Inhabitants, it carried ſuch a <hi>Contagion</hi> along with it, that the living ſcarce ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to bury the Dead.</p>
            <p>INDEED as it has been frequently experienced, that of all the Goods, which harbour <hi>Infection, Cotton</hi> in particular is the moſt dangerous, and <hi>Turkey</hi> is almoſt a perpetual <hi>Seminary</hi> of the <hi>Plague;</hi> I cannot but think it highly reaſonable, that whatever <hi>Cotton</hi> is imported from that Part of the World, ſhould at all Times be kept in <hi>Quarentine;</hi> becauſe it may have imbibed <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> at the Time of its packing up, notwithſtanding no Miſchief
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0202101000:34"/>has been felt from it by the Ship's Company.</p>
            <p>As all reaſonable Proviſions ſhould be made both for the <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Sick,</hi> who perform <hi>Quarentine;</hi> ſo the ſtrict keeping of it ought to be inforced by the ſevereſt <hi>Penalties.</hi> And if a Ship come from any Place, where the <hi>Plague</hi> raged, at the Time of the Ship's Departure from it, with more than uſual Violence, it will be the ſecureſt Method to <hi>Burn</hi> all the <hi>Goods,</hi> and even the <hi>Ship.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NOR ought this further Caution to be omitted, That when the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion</hi> has ceaſed in any Place by the approach of Winter, it will not be ſafe to open a free Trade with It too ſoon: Becauſe there are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the <hi>Diſtemper's</hi> being ſtopt by the Winter Cold, and yet the Seeds of it not deſtroyed, but
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0202101000:35"/>only kept unactive, till the Warmth of the following Spring has given them new Life and Force. Thus in the great Plague at <hi>Genoa</hi> near 60 Years ago, which continued part of two Years; the firſt Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer about 10000 dyed; the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter following hardly any; but the Summer after no leſs than 60000. So likewiſe the laſt <hi>Plague</hi> at <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don</hi> began the Autumn before the Year 1665, and was ſtopt during the Winter by a hard Froſt of near three Month's Continuance; ſo that there remained no further Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of it till the enſuing Spring
<note n="*" place="bottom">Hodges de Peſte.</note>. Now if Goods brought from ſuch a Place ſhould retain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the latent Contagion, there will be Danger of their producing the ſame Miſchief in the Place, to which they are brought, as they
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0202101000:36"/>would have cauſed in that, from whence they came.</p>
            <p>BUT above all it is neceſſary, that the <hi>Clandeſtine Importing</hi> of Goods be puniſhed with the utmoſt Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour; from which wicked Practice I ſhould at this Time apprehend more Danger of bringing the <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe</hi> from <hi>France,</hi> than by any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Way whatſoever.</p>
            <p>THESE are, I think, the moſt material Points, to which Regard is to be had in defending ourſelves againſt <hi>Contagion</hi> from other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. The particular Manner of putting theſe Directions in Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as the <hi>Viſiting</hi> of <hi>Ships, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation</hi> of <hi>Lazaretto's,</hi> &amp;c. I leave to proper Officers, who ought ſometimes to be aſſiſted herein by able Phyſicians.</p>
            <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0202101000:37"/>
            <p>THE next Conſideration is, What to do in Caſe, through a Miſcarriage in the publick Care, by the Neglect of Officers, or otherwiſe, ſuch a Calamity ſhould be ſuffered to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall us.</p>
            <p>THERE is no <hi>Evil</hi> in the World, in which the great Rule of <hi>Reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Beginning,</hi> more properly takes Place, than in the preſent Caſe; and yet it has unfortunately happened, that the common Steps formerly taken have had a direct Tendency to hinder the putting <hi>this Maxim</hi> in Practice.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Plague</hi> always breaks out in ſome particular Place, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the Directions of the <hi>Civil Magiſtrate</hi> ought to be ſuch, as to make it as much for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of Families to diſcover their
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0202101000:38"/>Misfortune, as it is, when a Houſe is on <hi>Fire,</hi> to call in the Aſſiſtance of the Neighbourhood: Whereas on the contrary, the Methods taken by the Publick, on ſuch Occaſions, have always had the Appearance of a ſevere <hi>Diſcipline,</hi> and even <hi>Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> rather than of a <hi>Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate Care:</hi> Which muſt naturally make the <hi>Infected</hi> conceal the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe as long as was poſſible.</p>
            <p>THE main Import of the <hi>Orders</hi> iſſued out at theſe Times was, As ſoon as it was found, that any Houſe was infected, to keep it ſhut up, with a <hi>large red Croſs,</hi> and <hi>Lord have Mercy upon us</hi> on the Door; and Watchmen attending Day and Night to prevent any one's going in or out, except <hi>Phyſicians, Surge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Apothecaries, Nurſes, Search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> &amp;c. allowed by Authority: And this to continue at leaſt a
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0202101000:39"/>Month after all the Family was <hi>dead</hi> or <hi>recovered</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Vid. <hi>Directions for the Cure of the</hi> Plague, <hi>by the</hi> College <hi>of</hi> Phyſicians; <hi>and Orders by the</hi> Lord Mayor <hi>and</hi> Aldermen <hi>of</hi> London, <hi>publiſhed</hi> 1665.</note>.</p>
            <p>IT is not eaſy to conceive a more diſmal Scene of Miſery, than this; Families ſeized with a Diſtemper, which the moſt of any in the World requires Help and Comfort, lockt up from all their Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; left it may be to the Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an inhumane Nurſe (for ſuch are often found at theſe Times about the Sick;) and Strangers to every thing but the Melancholy ſight of the Progreſs, Death makes among themſelves; with ſmall Hopes of Life, and thoſe mixed with Anxiety and Doubt, whether it be not better to Dye, than to ſurvive the Loſs of their beſt Friends, and neareſt Relations.</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0202101000:40"/>
            <p>IF <hi>Fear, Deſpair,</hi> and all <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of Spirits</hi> diſpoſe the Body to receive <hi>Contagion,</hi> and give it a great Power, where it is received, as all Phyſicians agree they do, I don't ſee how a Diſeaſe can be more enforced, than by ſuch a Treatment.</p>
            <p>NOTHING can juſtify ſuch <hi>Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> but the Plea, that it is for the Good of the whole <hi>Community,</hi> and prevents the ſpreading of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.</hi> But this upon due Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration will be found quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe: For while <hi>Contagion</hi> is kept nurſed up in a Houſe, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually encreaſed by the daily Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts it makes, it is impoſſible but the <hi>Air</hi> ſhould by Degrees become <hi>tainted,</hi> which by opening Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, &amp;c. will carry the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity firſt from Houſe to Houſe;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0202101000:41"/>and then from one Street to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The ſhutting up Houſes in this Manner is only keeping ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>Seminaries</hi> of <hi>Contagion,</hi> ſooner or later to be diſperſed abroad: For the waiting a Month, or longer, from the Death of the laſt Patient will avail no more, than keeping a <hi>Bale</hi> of infected <hi>Goods</hi> unpack'd; the Poyſon will fly out, whenever the <hi>Pandora's Box</hi> is opened.</p>
            <p>As theſe Meaſures were owing to the Ignorance of the true Nature of <hi>Contagion,</hi> ſo they did, I firmly believe, contribute very much to the long Continuance of the <hi>Plague,</hi> every time they have been practiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this City: And no doubt they have had as ill Effects in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Countries.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore no wonder, that great Complaints were ſometimes
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0202101000:42"/>made here againſt this unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Uſage; which, when they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed ſo far, as to procure ſome Releaſe for the <hi>Sick,</hi> were remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably followed with an Abatement of the Diſeaſe. The <hi>Plague</hi> in the Year 1636 began with great Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence, but Leave being given by the King's Authority for People to quit their Houſes; it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, That <hi>not one in twenty of the well Perſons removed fell Sick, nor one in ten of the Sick dyed</hi>

               </note>.

It was indeed ſo late in the Year, before this was done, that the near Approach of Winter was doubtleſs one Reaſon for the Diminution of the Diſeaſe, which followed: Yet this was ſo very great, that it is at leaſt paſt diſpute, that the Liberty then per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted was no Impediment to it: For this <hi>opening</hi> of the Houſes was allowed of in the beginning of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember;</hi> and whereas the laſt Week in <hi>Auguſt,</hi> there dyed no leſs than 4218, the very next Week the <hi>Burials</hi> were diminuiſhed to 3344, and in no longer time than to the fourth Week after, to 852

            <p>SINCE therefore the Management in former Times neither anſwers the Purpoſe of <hi>diſcovering the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning</hi> of the <hi>Infection,</hi> nor of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0202101000:45"/>They ſhould without Delay order all the Families, in which the Sickneſs is, to be <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved;</hi> The <hi>Sick</hi> to different Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces from the <hi>Sound;</hi> but the Houſes for both ſhould be three or four Miles out of Town; and the <hi>Sound</hi> People ſhould be <hi>ſtript of all their Cloaths,</hi> and <hi>waſhed</hi> and <hi>ſhaved,</hi> before they go into their new Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.</p>
            <p>NO Manner of <hi>Compaſſion</hi> and <hi>Care</hi> ſhould be wanting to the <hi>Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſed;</hi> to whom, being now in <hi>clean</hi> and <hi>airy</hi> Habitations, there would, with due Cautions, be no great Danger in giving Attendance. All Expences ſhould be paid by the Publick, and no Charges ought to be thought great, which are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbalanced with the ſaving a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the greateſt of Calamities. Nor does it ſeem to me at all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0202101000:46"/>that a <hi>Reward</hi> ſhould be given to the Perſon, that makes the firſt Diſcovery of <hi>Infection</hi> in any Place; ſince it is undeniable, that the making known the <hi>Evil</hi> to thoſe, who are provided with proper Methods againſt it, is the firſt and main Step towards the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercoming it.</p>
            <p>WHEN the <hi>Sick Families</hi> are gone, all the Goods of the Houſes, in which they were, ſhould be <hi>burnt;</hi> nay the Houſes themſelves; if that can conveniently be done. And after this all poſſible Care ought ſtill to be taken to remove whatever Cauſes are found to breed and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote <hi>Contagion.</hi> In order to this, the <hi>Overſeers</hi> of the Poor (who might be aſſiſted herein by other Officers) ſhould viſit the Dwellings of all the meaner ſort of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and where they find
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0202101000:47"/>them <hi>ſtifled up too cloſe</hi> and <hi>naſty,</hi> ſhould leſſen their Number by ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome into better Lodgings, and ſhould take Care, by all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Proviſion and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to make them more <hi>cleanly</hi> and <hi>ſweet.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NO good Work carries its own Reward with it ſo much as this kind of <hi>Charity;</hi> and therefore be the Expence what it will, it muſt never be thought unreaſonable.

            </p>
            <p>ORDERS indeed of this kind are neceſſary to be obſerved at all times,
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0202101000:50"/>eſpecially in populous Cities; and therefore I am ſorry to take No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that in <hi>theſe</hi> of <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> there is no good <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice</hi> eſtabliſhed in theſe Reſpects; for want of which the Citizens and Gentry are every Day annoyed more ways than one.</p>
            <p>IF theſe early <hi>Precautions,</hi> we have mentioned, take Effect, there will be no need of any Methods for <hi>Correcting the Air, Purifying Houſes,</hi> or of <hi>Rules for preſerving particular Perſons from Infection:</hi> To all which, if the <hi>Plague</hi> get head, ſo that the <hi>Sick</hi> are too many to be removed, Regard muſt be had.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>firſt; Fire</hi> has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt univerſally recommended for this Purpoſe, both by the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents and Moderns; who have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to make frequent and nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0202101000:51"/>
               <hi>Fires</hi> in the Towns infected: By which Means, it is ſaid, <hi>Hip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrates</hi> preſerved <hi>Greece</hi> from a <hi>Plague,</hi> which was entring into it from <hi>Aethiopia</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Galen. de Theriac. cap. 16.</note>. And it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that ſome evil Diſpoſitions of the Air, particularly ſuch as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from <hi>Damps, Exhalations,</hi> &amp;c. may be corrected by <hi>Fire,</hi> and the Prediſpoſition of it to receive <hi>Infection</hi> from theſe Cauſes ſometimes removed. But when the Diſtemper is actually <hi>begun,</hi> and rages, ſince it is known to be <hi>ſpread</hi> and <hi>increaſed</hi> by the <hi>Heat</hi> of the <hi>Summer,</hi> and on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary checked by the <hi>cold</hi> in <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;</hi> undoubtedly, whatever increaſes that <hi>Heat</hi> will ſo far add Force to the Diſeaſe. Whether the Service <hi>Fires</hi> may do by correcting any other ill Qualities of the Air will
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0202101000:52"/>counterbalance the Inconvenience upon this Account, Experience on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly can determine; and the Fatal ſucceſs of the Tryals made here in the laſt <hi>Plague,</hi> is more than ſufficient to diſcourage any further Attempts of this Nature; for <hi>Fires</hi> being ordered in all the <hi>Streets</hi> for three Days together, there dyed in one Night following no leſs than 4000; whereas in any ſingle Week before or after, not much above three times that Number were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed off

            <p>WHAT has been ſaid of <hi>Fires,</hi> is likewiſe to be underſtood of <hi>firing of Guns,</hi> which ſome have too raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly adviſed. The proper Correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Air would be to make it <hi>freſh</hi> and <hi>cool.</hi> Accordingly the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0202101000:53"/>
               <hi>Arabians</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rhazes de re Medica, lib. 10. c. 16.</note>, who were beſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Nature of <hi>Peſtilences,</hi> adviſe People to keep themſelves as <hi>airy</hi> as poſſible, and to chuſe Dwellings expoſed to the Wind.</p>
            <p>FOR keeping <hi>Houſes</hi> cool, they took to be the beſt Method of <hi>purifying</hi> them; and therefore to anſwer this End more fully, they directed to ſtrew them with <hi>cooling</hi> Herbs, as <hi>Roſes, Violets, Water-Lillies,</hi> &amp;c. and to be waſhed with <hi>Water</hi> and <hi>Vinegar;</hi> than all which, eſpecially the laſt, nothing more proper can be propoſed: Though it be directly contrary to what Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern Authors moſtly adviſe, which is to make Fumes with hot Things, as <hi>Benzoin, Frankincenſe, Aſa Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida, Storax,</hi> &amp;c. from which I ſee no reaſon to expect any Virtue
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0202101000:54"/>to deſtroy the Matter of <hi>Infection,</hi> or to keep particular Places from a Diſpoſition to receive it; which are the only things here to be aimed at. It is of more Conſequence to be obſerved, that as <hi>Naſtineſs</hi> is a great Source of <hi>Infection,</hi> ſo <hi>Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs</hi> is the greateſt Preſervative: Which is the true Reaſon, why the Poor are moſt obnoxious to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſters of this Kind.</p>
            <p>THE next thing after the <hi>purifying of Houſes,</hi> is to conſider by what Means particular <hi>Perſons</hi> may beſt defend themſelves againſt <hi>Contagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> for the effectual doing of which it would be neceſſary to put the <hi>Humours</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> into ſuch a State, as not to be alterable by the <hi>Matter of Infection.</hi> But ſince this is no more to be hoped for, than a <hi>Specific Preſervative</hi> from the <hi>Small-Pox;</hi> the moſt that can be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0202101000:55"/>done, will be to keep the <hi>Body</hi> in ſuch Order, that it may ſuffer as little as poſſible. The <hi>firſt Step</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards which, is to maintain a good State of Health, in which we are always leaſt liable to ſuffer by any external Injuries; and not to weaken the Body by Evacuations. The <hi>next</hi> is, to guard againſt all <hi>Dejecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirits,</hi> and <hi>immoderate Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions;</hi> for theſe we daily obſerve do expoſe Perſons to the more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Contagion</hi> of the <hi>Small-Pox.</hi> Theſe Ends will be beſt anſwered by living with Temperance upon a good generous Diet, and avoiding <hi>Faſtings, Watchings, extreme Weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Another</hi> Defence is, to uſe whatever Means are proper to keep the <hi>Blood</hi> from <hi>Inflaming.</hi> This, if it does not ſecure from <hi>contracting Infection,</hi> will at leaſt make the <hi>Effects</hi> of it leſs violent.
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0202101000:56"/>The moſt proper Means for this, according to the Advice of the <hi>Arabian</hi> Phyſicians, is the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Uſe of <hi>acid Fruits,</hi> as <hi>Pomegra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates, Sevil Oranges, Lemons, tart Apples,</hi> &amp;c. But above all of <hi>Wine-Vinegar</hi> in ſmall Quantities, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered grateful to the Stomach by the Infuſion of ſome ſuch Ingre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dients as <hi>Gentian Root, Galangal, Zedoary, Juniper Berries,</hi> &amp;c. Which Medicines by correcting the <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> and taking off ſome ill Effects it might otherwiſe have upon the Stomach, will be of good Uſe: But theſe, and all other hot <hi>Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic</hi> Drugs, though much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Authors, if uſed alone, are moſt likely to do hurt by <hi>over heating</hi> the Blood.</p>
            <p>BUT ſince none of theſe Methods promiſe any certain Protection; as
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0202101000:57"/>
               <hi>leaving</hi> the Place infected is the ſureſt <hi>Preſervative,</hi> ſo the next to it, is to avoid, as much as may be, the <hi>near Approach</hi> to the <hi>Sick,</hi> or to ſuch as have but <hi>lately Recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> For the greater Security here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, it will be adviſable to avoid all <hi>Crouds of People.</hi> Nay it ſhould be the Care of the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> to prohibit all unneceſſary <hi>Aſſemblies;</hi> and likewiſe to oblige all, who get over the Diſeaſe, to <hi>Confine</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ſome time, before they appear abroad.</p>
            <p>THE Advice to keep at a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from the <hi>Sick,</hi> is alſo to be underſtood of the <hi>Dead Bodies:</hi> which ſhould be <hi>buried</hi> at as great a Diſtance from Dwelling Houſes, as may be; put <hi>deep</hi> in the Earth; and <hi>covered</hi> with the exacteſt Care. They ſhould likewiſe be <hi>carried out</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0202101000:58"/>in the <hi>Night,</hi> while they are yet freſh and free from Putrefaction: Becauſe a Carcaſs not yet begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to Corrupt, if kept from the Heat of the Day, hardly emits any kind of Steam or Vapour.</p>
            <p>As for thoſe, who muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity attend the <hi>Sick;</hi> ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Directions ſhould be added for their Uſe. Theſe may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in two ſhort Precepts. <hi>One</hi> is, not to <hi>ſwallow their Spittle</hi> while they are about the <hi>Sick,</hi> but rather to <hi>ſpit</hi> it out: <hi>The other,</hi> not ſo much as to <hi>draw in their Breath,</hi> when they are very near them. The reaſon for both theſe appears from what has been ſaid above con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Manner, in which a ſound Perſon receives the Infecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <pb n="53" facs="tcp:0202101000:59"/>
            <p>THIS is the Sum of what I think moſt likely to ſtop the Progreſs of the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi> in any Place, where it ſhall have got Admittance. If ſome few of theſe <hi>Rules</hi> refer more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the City of <hi>London,</hi> with ſmall Alteration they may be applied to any other <hi>Place.</hi> It now remains therefore only to lay down ſome Directions to hinder the <hi>Diſtemper's</hi> ſpreading from <hi>Town</hi> to <hi>Town.</hi> The beſt Method for which, where it can be done, is to caſt up a <hi>Line</hi> about the <hi>Town inſected,</hi> at a convenient Diſtance; and by placing a <hi>Guard,</hi> to hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der People's paſſing from it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out due Regulation, to other Towns: But not abſolutely to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid any to withdraw themſelves, as they have now done in <hi>France,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the uſual Practice abroad;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0202101000:60"/>which is an unneceſſary Severity, not to call it a Cruelty. I think it will be enough, if all, who deſire to paſs the <hi>Line,</hi> be permitted to do it, upon Condition they firſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form <hi>Quarentine</hi> for about 20 Days in <hi>Tents,</hi> or other more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Habitations.</hi> But the greateſt Care muſt be taken, that none paſs without conforming themſelves to this Order, both by keeping di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent <hi>Watch,</hi> and by <hi>puniſhing</hi> with the utmoſt Severity, any that ſhall either have done ſo, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it. And the better to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>ſuch,</hi> it will be requiſite to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige all, who travel in any Part of the Country, under the ſame Penalties, to carry with them <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates</hi> either of their coming from Places not <hi>Infected,</hi> or of their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Line</hi> by permiſſion.</p>
            <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0202101000:61"/>
            <p>THIS I take to be a more effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Method to keep the <hi>Infection</hi> from ſpreading, than the abſolute refuſing a Paſſage to People upon any Terms. For when Men are in ſuch imminent Danger of their Lives, where they are; many, no doubt, if not otherwiſe allowed to eſcape, will uſe Endeavours to do it ſecretly, let the Hazard be ever ſo great. And it can hardly be, but ſome will ſucceed in their At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts; as we ſee fell out in <hi>France</hi> notwithſtanding all their Care. But one that gets off thus clandeſtine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, will be more like to carry the Diſtemper with him, than twenty, nay a hundred, that go away un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the preceding Reſtrictions: E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially becauſe the <hi>Infection</hi> of the Place, he flies from, will by this Management be rendered much
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0202101000:62"/>more intenſe. For confining Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and ſhutting them up together in great Numbers, will make the Diſtemper rage with augmented Force, even to the increaſing it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what can be eaſily imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; As appears from the <hi>Account,</hi> which the learned <hi>Gaſſendus</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Notitia Ecclefiae Dinienfis.</note> has given us of a memorable <hi>Plague,</hi> which happened at <hi>Digne</hi> in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence,</hi> where he lived, in the Year 1619. This was ſo terrible, that in one <hi>Summer</hi> out of <hi>ten thouſand</hi> Inhabitants, it left but <hi>fifteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred,</hi> and of them all but <hi>five</hi> or <hi>ſix</hi> had gone through the <hi>Diſeaſe.</hi> And he aſſigns <hi>this,</hi> as the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Cauſe of the great Deſtruction, That the Citizens were too cloſely confined, and not ſuffered ſo much as to go to their Country Houſes.
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0202101000:63"/>Whereas in another <hi>Peſtilence,</hi> which broke out in the ſame Place a year and half after, more Liberty being allowed, there did not dye above <hi>one hundred</hi> Perſons.</p>
            <p>FOR theſe Reaſons, I think, to allow People with proper <hi>Cautions</hi> to remove from an infected Place, is the beſt Means to ſuppreſs the <hi>Contagion,</hi> as well as the moſt humane Treatment of the preſent Sufferers: But though Liberty ought to be given to the <hi>People,</hi> yet no ſort of <hi>Goods</hi> muſt by any means be ſuffered to be carried over the <hi>Line,</hi> which are made of <hi>Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials</hi> retentive of <hi>Infection.</hi> For in the preſent Caſe, when <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> has ſeized any Part of a Country, much greater Care ought to be taken, that no <hi>Seeds</hi> of the <hi>Contagion</hi> be conveyed about, than
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0202101000:64"/>when the Diſtemper is at a great Diſtance; becauſe a <hi>Bale of Goods,</hi> which ſhall have imbibed the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Aura</hi> when packt up in <hi>Turkey,</hi> or any remote Parts; yet, when unpackt here, may chance to meet with ſo healthful a Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rament of our Air, that it ſhall not do much hurt. But when the Air of any one of our Towns ſhall be ſo corrupted, as to ſpread and maintain the <hi>Peſtilence</hi> in it, there will be little reaſon to believe, that the Air of the reſt of the Country is in a much better State.</p>
            <p>FOR the ſame Reaſon <hi>Quaren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tines</hi> ſhould more ſtrictly be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined, when the <hi>Plague</hi> is in a bordering Kingdom, than when it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s more remote.</p>
            <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0202101000:65"/>
            <p>I have gone through the chief Branches of <hi>Preſervation</hi> againſt the <hi>Plague.</hi> And ſhall only add, that if the <hi>Burning of Goods,</hi> which has been propoſed, be thought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Way <hi>offenſive</hi> or <hi>inconvenient,</hi> The <hi>Burying</hi> of them ſix Feet, or more, under Ground may anſwer the Purpoſe as well.</p>
            <p>WHAT has been ſaid of the <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Contagion,</hi> upon which the foregoing Directions are grounded, may alſo be of Uſe towards e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhing a better Method of <hi>Cure,</hi> than <hi>Authors</hi> have common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught: But to engage in this is beyond the preſent Deſign.</p>
