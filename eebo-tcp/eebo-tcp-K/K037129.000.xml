            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHEN I conſider the high rank you have long held as an enlightened Stateſman, an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed Orator, and a wiſe Legiſlator, I fear I ſhall incur the cenſure of preſumption, for daring to treſpaſs upon that attention, ſo much more nobly employed in meditating your country's good. But great minds can deſcend with eaſe, from the dignity of their ſpheres, to the contemplation of the moſt minute objects; and what would confuſe, or impede, the operation of feebler faculties, acts only as a relief to ſuperior ſpirits, lend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them additional vigour in purſuits, which call forth all their energies. Your Lordſhip's partiality to the Dramatic Muſe is well known; and the ME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CAENAS of a GARRICK may naturally expect, that Writers for the Stage will lay their offerings at the feet of a Nobleman, univerſally allowed the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Judge in their own art.—Not content with the private ſatisfaction I enjoy from my veneration for ſplendid abilities, and diſtinguiſhed virtue, I am am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious the world ſhould know I am capable of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring them.—There is a protecting influence in the name of CAMDEN, that recommends to the wife, and to the good; it is auſpicious to every Muſe, and every honorable undertaking—and as ſuch, I have prefixed it to my work; in imitation of the firſt CAESAR, who concealed his baldneſs under a laurel.</p>

                  <p>You ſhall hear.—As my father lived in the interior part of the province of South-Carolina, he ſent my brother, attended by two ſervants, to eſcort me in ſafety to Charles Town, where I was to embark
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1193100500:10"/>for England. Through the ignorance of guides we loſt our way, and fell in with a party of the French; but were ſcarce made priſoners, when an alarm was given of an enemy being in ſight. Oh, Heavens! how my heart beat!—It was a detachment of horſe from the King's troops. Motionleſs and dumb, I heard the ſhout of war—ſaw both battles charge— when a trance relieved me from the agony of my fears. The firſt object my eyes afterwards encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered was an officer in the Britiſh uniform, who looked tenderly in my face, as if he had been anxiouſly waiting my recovery. Oh, Charlotte! how ſhall I deſcribe him to you?—Imagine a perſon, the moſt captivating, manners the moſt winningly poliſhed, and a countenance in which ſweetneſs had ſo tempered the manly daring of the ſoldier, that, like Mars, when diſarming by the Graces, he appear'd reſigning the Laurel for the Myrtle of Love. I hear the muſic of his voice this moment.—"Madam," ſaid he, taking me reſpectfully by the hand, <q>you are no longer a priſoner.—It gives me inexpreſſible concern, that the nature of my orders will not allow me to ſee you ſafe to the end of your journey; but if we ever meet again!</q>—At theſe ſad words, the drums beat, and the trumpet blew its ſilver ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; —my brother in the ſame inſtant urged the dangers of delay, and preſſed me to renew our jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; —with reluctance and regret I yielded to his remonſtrances; when turning round to take a parting look of my gallant ſoldier, I found he was gone—the whole party had rode off at full ſpeed; in a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes I could ſee nothing but a cloud of duſt, and for ever loſt ſight of my deliverer.</p>

                  <p>There is an inſtance in which nature herſelf did not obſerve method; your father from his child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood had a leaning to extravagance, and when the young ſpendthrift had ſquander'd away all his pocket money at ſchool, I uſed to advance him a freſh ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, at two-pence in the half-crown premium; why to this moment I have a particular hour in the day for doing every thing, and as the clock ſtrikes, my performance chimes echo to the ſound of it: but here is a curious calculation which I have made, that tells me, at a glance of the eye, how every hour of my life is diſpoſed of for twenty years to come <stage>[pulls out a pocket-book]</stage>: now mark, here's the third of Auguſt, ten in the morning, 1796, reading the General Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Poſt, with my remarks upon the ſiege of Gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raltar.</p>

                  <p>Commanded laſt year on a ſecret expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion through the interior part of South-Carolina, I met a woman, who at firſt ſight made an impreſſion on me I feel to this hour. She was taken priſoner by the French, when I had the good fortune to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument of her deliverance; but as my orders were to proceed by the moſt rapid marches, I was obliged to quit her nearly in the inſtant I had reſcued her; and, what is worſe, before I had an opportunity of knowing who ſhe was.</p>

                  <p>No, but I feared to aſk it; for you muſt know, there was a gentleman with her, who, from his attention, I took to be her huſband; then, whatever ſervants ſhe had were diſperſed by the engagement, or I might have learned her name, and place of abode; but Fortune was my foe, and determined we never ſhould meet: So now, at my father's earneſt requeſt, I have quitted the army, in order to take a wife he has choſen for me, and forget this fair enchantreſs I have been ſo long dreaming of.</p>

                  <p>So then my whole plan is come to the ground; henceforward I may pay as little regard to method as my daughter has done in her proceedings—my calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations too—my cares for a riſing generation are all become uſeleſs: no later than yeſterday, I made a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion in the army for a youth, who, tho' he's not yet born, I ſat down as a general. I had likewiſe married two of my grand-daughters to great advantage in the next century; but the rebellion of this undutiful girl, has clouded all my proſpects, ſo that it's probable I ſhall leave the world, without having fixt in life a ſingle branch of my poſterity.</p>

                  <p>Your daughter, Sir; and as a proof that I have ſeen her, her beauty is of that matchleſs nature, that to ſee her once, is to adore her eternally. 'Tis impoſſible I could have been miſtaken; for you know we are old acquaintance.</p>

                  <p>This is truly extraordinary!—Why, Sir, 'tis now above eight months ſince I firſt ſaw her; I never had her out of my thoughts ſince.—Nay, Sir, as a farther proof of what beauty like hers can do, Lieutenant Middleton, belonging to my own troop, was as much enamour'd at his firſt and only interview. —Poor fellow! he was trepann'd, ſome time ago, for a deſperate wound he received a little above the temple, and has never ſince been rightly in his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>

                  <p>But, Sir, I am perfectly ſatisfied with your daughter's reception of me—and now, as there is no bar in the way of my happineſs, I'll act with the ſame freedom, as if I was already one of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily —I have an old and moſt particular friend at Bath, whom my advice has brought into a very diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable,

'Tis very unlucky that he's not here to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company me—he'd be an excellent match for Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, who is as hot-brain'd as himſelf.—But hold, is it ſafe to venture, without ſome one I can depend upon? I'm not like Old England, able to fight the whole world without an ally.—Admiral Dreadnought is to ſup with me; ſo I'll wait till my friend comes, and then ſally forth as bold as a lion.</p>

                  <p>Upon my word, you have a vaſt deal of good company in your cup this evening!—But who is this Admiral Dreadnought, and his two lame foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, as you deſcribe them, on horſeback?</p>

                  <p>Ah! poor gentleman, he's too old—beſides, he's going to be married.—He has made voyages enough in his time—they ſay, he'd make nothing of ſailing to the world's end, and back again.</p>

                  <p>But this is a kind of converſation in detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. —When, cruel creature, may I expect that the cartel of Love will bring about an exchange of hearts between us?</p>

                  <p>Really, Sir, I think it rather too ſoon to propoſe that queſtion.—Beſides, I'd have you to know, that I like to be courted, as well as my betters; and expect to hear a man talk to me of his ſtames, and his darts, and write love-ſongs on me.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Wil.</speaker>
                  <p>You miſapprehend me; I do not cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure the practice in others; I only ſay, that under the circumſtances I found myſelf left a widow, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible I can ever think of a ſecond huſband.</p>

                  <p>Then you have no family incumbrance, like other women; for my brother, the Admiral, out of regard to Captain Wilmot, has taken your ſon under his protection, and means to provide for him.</p>

                  <speaker>Mrs. Wil.</speaker>
                  <p>That is one reaſon out of many, why it appears to me I ſhould not change my condition: Is it not to the merit of my deceaſed huſband I owe the favour ſhewn to my ſon? Is it not to that huſband's merit alſo, I am indebted for the aſylum I enjoy under your brother's hoſpitable roof? if I could for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get all the love I ever bore the dear partner of my heart, gratitude ſays I ſhou'd not inſult the memory of a man, whoſe ſpirit ſeems ſtill to attend me like a guardian angel, with a fondneſs that ſurvives the grave.</p>

               <p>This woman is in a continual ſtate of mutiny; ſhe's harder to govern than a three-decker; ſhe kept me in a ſtorm for a long time about my ſervants; but old Cable Dreadnought was moor'd too faſt to his opinion; I'll have none of your lazy lolloping land-lubbers about me, when I can get real ſeamen to do their buſineſs; honeſt fellows too that bear the marks of having ſerved their country. She didn't like Locker, the butler, becauſe he's dark of the larboard eye; we fought four glaſſes yard arm and vard arm, the day his upper works were damaged: he was then my boatſwain, and I gave him charge of the cellar, that ſo brave a fellow may be always able to wet his whiſtle. My ſteward is a diſabled purſer, whoſe left hand was ſhot off in battle; and after that, I think the honor of his right may be relied on. I keep a groom, and two footmen, who are all reduc'd to their odd joints; then what better coachman could I fix upon than an old pilot? He has ſteer'd me ſafely thro'
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:1193100500:42"/>many a rough ſea, and hard gale; and whilſt he has an eye in his head to ſee the compaſs, damn me! if I take the helm out of his hands.</p>

<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1193100500:52"/>to drop a-ſtern, I wiſh to know, before I ſheer off, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther I ſhall ever hoiſt my flag on board of the America.</p>

                  <p>Between ourſelves, Admiral, as my daughter went off with him, and this Colonel won't have her, I ſhould have no objection to giving my conſent, only I am afraid I ſhall loſe my character for ever by it, as a man of method.</p>

                  <p>Well, Summers, as Charlotte appears deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd to have nobody but you, I'll let the Colonel ſee he ſhan't overturn all my calculations.—You ſhall have my daughter; but you muſt get into Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament as faſt as you can.—I expected to ſee a branch

                  <p>Colonel, give me your hand—we are friends once more. Take notice, Summers, that I have ſet down in the future arrangements of my family, a Biſhop, and a General Officer. Good folks, I have a band of muſic, and an excellent ſupper provided—if it is not ſpoil'd by being over-done.
