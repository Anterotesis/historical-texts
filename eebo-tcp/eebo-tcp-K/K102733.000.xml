            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE firſt Sketch of the following Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſays was wrote for the Service of a Friend, without any Intention of mine to have been an Author. When they were pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, I was glad of the Opportunity which the ſecond Edition of the Anatomy of the Bones gave me to correct them, and I thought Mr. <hi>Winſlow</hi>'s Anatomy made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further Labour of mine on theſe Subjects unneceſſary. But whenever it was foreſeen that this third Edition of the Oſteology was to be printed, I was teazed with the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of Friends and Scholars, to make the Anatomy of the Nerves more complete, and to tack the other two Eſſays to it. It was in vain for me to plead the Difficulty, if not Impoſſibility of bringing the Phyſiolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of the Nerves to any Certainty, tho' it might engage me in an endleſs Diſpute; and that any other Deſcription of the Diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Nerves, than what Mr. <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlow</hi> had given, was altogether ſuperſtuous: They inſiſted, would not be refuſed, and forced me to undertake it.</p>
            <p>In the Account of the Nerves in general, I have avoided what I could to give Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and therefore have not only treated all the Opinions I mention with that Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty which the Uncertainty of the Subject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired,
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:1074401200:3"/>but have not named one Author, flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering myſelf, that thoſe, whom I was under the Neceſſity to redargue, might be better con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed by my not declaring whom I approved.</p>
            <p>I attempted an accurate Deſcription of the particular Nerves; but upon compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Notes I wrote of what I ſaw in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecting the Nerves with Mr. <hi>Winſlow</hi>'s <hi>Expoſition des Nerſs,</hi> I found I had done little more than uſed other Words for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the ſame Things; and upon giving my Papers to be peruſed by ſome of thoſe for whoſe. Uſe any Thing I write is chiefly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, I mean the Students in Phyſick, I diſcovered another Misfortune ſufficient to make me alter my Deſign. The young A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natomiſts were ſo confounded with the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Branches and their Sub-diviſions, that they could not ſee even the groſs Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lines of the Picture I had attempted to draw. That I might be underſtood, and my Scholars might thereby be aſſiſted to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the more minute Diſſections I ſhou'd ſhew them, I changed my Notes into a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Deſcription of the larger Branches of the Nerves.</p>
            <p>The Account of the <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> of the Heart is the immortal <hi>Boerhaave</hi>'s Doctrine illuſtrated, and the Deſcription of the <hi>Receptaculum Chyli,</hi> and of the <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctus Thoracicus</hi> is nearly the ſame as it was in the former Edition.</p>

            <head>THE ANATOMY OF THE <hi>Human Nerves.</hi>
            </head>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Of the Nerves in general.</head>
               <p n="1">1.<seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Y the Aſſiſtance of Injections and Microſcopes wonderful Plexuſes of Blood-veſſels are diſcovered to go from the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> into the <hi>Cortex,</hi> cincri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, or aſhy-coloured Part of the <hi>Cerebrum, Cerebellum</hi> and <hi>ſpinal Marrow,</hi> whereas we can only ſee longitudinal Veſſels, without nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous Ramifications or reticular Plexuſes, in the white medullary Subſtance of theſe Parts.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Continuity of the <hi>Cortex</hi> with the <hi>Medulla</hi> of the <hi>Encephalon</hi> and <hi>ſpinal Marrow</hi> is obſervable with the naked Eye, and is more diſtinctly ſeen with the Aſſiſtance of a Micro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcope.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:1074401200:5"/>
               <p n="3">3. In diſſecting the <hi>Brain</hi> and <hi>Cerebellum,</hi> we ſee the ſmall Beginnings of the <hi>Medulla</hi> proceeding from the <hi>Cortex,</hi> and can trace its gradual Increaſe by the Addition of more <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla</hi> coming from the <hi>Cortex.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Both <hi>Cortex</hi> and <hi>Medulla</hi> are very ſuccu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent; for being expoſed to the Air to dry, they loſe more of their Weight than moſt other Parts of the Body do.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In ſeveral Places we can obſerve the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla</hi> to be compoſed of Fibres laid at each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Sides.</p>
               <p n="6">6. The medullary Subſtance is all employed in forming the white fibrous Cords, which have now the Name of <hi>Nerves</hi> appropriated to them. Within the Skull we ſee the Nerves to be the medullary ſubſtance continued, and the <hi>medulla ſpinalis</hi> is all employed in forming Nerves.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The common Opinion concerning the Riſe of the Nerves, founded on a ſuperficial Inſpection of thoſe Parts, is, that the Nerves are propagated from the ſame Side of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalon</hi> at which they go out. But it having been remarked, after a more ſtrict Enquiry, and preparing the Parts by Maceration in Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that the medullary Fibres decuſſate or croſs each other in ſome Parts of the <hi>Medulla;</hi> as for Example, at the <hi>Corpus annulare,</hi> and Beginning of the <hi>Medulla ſpinalis:</hi> And practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Obſervators having related ſeveral Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of People, whoſe Brain was hurt on one Side, while the morbid Symptom, Palſy, appeared on the other Side of the Body, of which I have ſeen two Inſtances; and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made on Brutes having confirmed theſe
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:1074401200:6"/>Obſervations, it has been thought, that the Nerves had their Riſe from the Side of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cephalon,</hi> oppoſite to their Egreſs from the Skull. It may however ſtill be ſaid, that this laſt Opinion is not fully demonſtrated, becauſe a Decuſſation in ſome few Parts is not a Proof that it obtains univerſally; and if there are Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of Palſy of the Side oppoſite to where the Leſion of the Brain was, there are alſo o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, where the Injury done to the Brain and the Palſy were both on the ſame Side.</p>
               <p n="8">8. The Nerves are compoſed of a great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Threads lying parallel, where they come out from the <hi>Medulla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This fibrous Texture is evident at the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin of moſt of the Nerves within the Skull, and in the <hi>Cauda equine</hi> of the <hi>Medulla ſpinalis,</hi> we can divide them into ſuch ſmall Threads, that a very quick-ſighted Eye can ſcarce per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive them; but theſe Threads, when looked at with a Microſcope, appear each to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of a great Number of ſmaller Threads.</p>
               <p n="9">9. How ſmall one of theſe Fibrils of the Nerves is we know not, but when we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that every, even the moſt minute Part of the Body is ſenſible, and that this muſt depend on the Nerves (which all conjoined would not make a Cord of an Inch Diameter) being divided into Branches or Filaments to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed through all theſe minute Parts, we muſt be convinced that the nervous Fibrils are very ſmall. From the Examination of the <hi>mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mum viſibile</hi> it is demonſtrated, that each Fibre in the <hi>Retina</hi> of the Eye, or expanded optick Nerve, cannot exceed the Size of the 32400 Part of a Hair.</p>
               <pb n="4" facs="tcp:1074401200:7"/>
               <p n="10">10. The medullary Subſtance, of which the nervous Fibrils are compoſed, is very ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and would not be able to reſiſt the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Force of the circulating Fluids, and other ſuch Forces to which the Nerves are expoſed within the Bones, were not the <hi>Pia Mater</hi> and <hi>Tunica Arachnoides</hi> continued upon them. The former giving them Firmneſs and Strength, and the latter furniſhing a cellular Coat to connect the Threads of the Nerves, to let them ly ſoft and mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſt, and to ſupport the Veſſels which go with them.</p>
               <p>It is this cellular Subſtance that is diſtended with Air when it is blown through a Blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pipe thruſt into a Nerve, and that makes a Nerve appear all ſpungy, after being diſtended with Air till it dries, the proper nervous Fibrils ſhriveling ſo in drying as they ſcarce can be obſerved.</p>
               <p n="11">11. Theſe Coats, § 10. would not make the Nerves ſtrong enough to bear the ſtretching and Preſſure they are expoſed to in their Courſe to the different Parts of the Body; and therefore as the Nerves are going out at the Holes in the <hi>Cranium</hi> and <hi>Spine,</hi> the <hi>Dura Mater</hi> is cloſely wrapt round them, to collect their diſgregated Fibres into tenſe firm Cords, and that the ſtretching they may be expoſed to may have no Effect to hurt them where they are not ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned thus by the <hi>Dura Mater;</hi> this ſtrong Membrane is firmly fixed to the Sides of the Holes in the Bones through which they paſs.</p>
               <p n="12">12. The nervous Cords thus compoſed of nervous Fibrils, cellular Coat, <hi>Pia</hi> and <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> have ſuch numerous Blood-veſſels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on them, that after their Arteries only
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1074401200:8"/>are injected, the whole Cord can be tinged of the Colour of the injected Liquor; and if the Injection is puſhed too violently, the cellular Subſtance of the Nerves comes to be diſtended with it.</p>
               <p n="13">13. A nervous Cord, ſuch as has been juſt now deſcribed, § 12. has very little Elaſticity, compared with other Parts of the Body. When cut out of the Body, it does not become obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vably ſhorter, while the Blood-veſſels contract three Eighths of their Length.</p>
               <p n="14">14. In the Courſe which the Nerves have to the ſeveral Parts of the Body, they are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lodged in a cellular or fatty ſubſtance, and run in the Interſtices of the Muſcles and other active Organs, that ſo they might be little expoſed to the Preſſure which theſe Parts would make upon them, and might be defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from any bad Effects which ſuch Preſſure might otherwiſe produce.</p>
               <p n="15">15. The larger Cords of the Nerves divide into Branches in their Diſtribut on to the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Parts; the Branches being ſmaller than the Trunk from which they come, and making generally an acute angle where they ſeparate.</p>
               <p n="16">16. In ſeveral Places different Nerves unite into one Cord, which is commonly larger than any of the Nerves which form <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t.</p>
               <p n="17">17. Several Nerves, particularly thoſe which are diſtributed to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ls, ſudden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly form a hard Knot. conſiderably larger than all the Nerves of which it is made. Theſe Knots were called <hi>Corpora olivaria,</hi> and are now generally named <hi>Ganglions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18. The <hi>Ganglions</hi> have much thicker Coats and larger, more numerous Blood-veſſels than
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1074401200:9"/>the Nerves, ſo that they appear redder and more muſcular. On diſſecting the <hi>Ganglions,</hi> Fibres are ſeen running longitudinally in their Axes, and other Fibres are derived from their Sides in an oblique direction to the longitudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ones.</p>
               <p n="19">19. The Nerves which go out from the <hi>Ganglions</hi> are no way remarkably different from other Nerves.</p>
               <p n="20">20. The Nerves that are ſent to our Organs of the Senſes loſe there their firm Coats, and terminate in a pulpy Subſtance. The <hi>optick Nerves</hi> are expanded into the ſoft tender Webs the <hi>Retinae;</hi> the <hi>auditory Nerve</hi> has ſcarce the Conſiſtence of <hi>Mucus</hi> in the <hi>Veſtibulum, Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chlea</hi> and <hi>ſemicircular Canals</hi> of each Ear; the <hi>Papillae</hi> of the Noſe, Tongue and Skin are ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſoft.</p>
               <p n="21">21. The Nerves of Muſcles can likewiſe be traced till they loſe their Coats and become very ſoft, from which, and what we obſerved of the ſenſatory Nerves, § 20. there is Reaſon to conclude, that the muſcular Nerves are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo pulpy at their Terminations, which we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indeed proſecute by Diſſection.</p>
               <p n="22">22. It would ſeem neceſſary that the Extremities of the Nerves ſhould continue in this ſoft flexible State, (§ 20, 21.) in order to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their Functions right: For in proportion as Parts become rigid and firm by Age, or any other Cauſe, they loſe of their Senſibility, and the Motions are more difficultly performed.</p>
               <p n="23">23. Tho' the Fibres in a nervous Cord are firmly connected, and frequently different Nerves join into one Trunk, or into the ſame <hi>Ganglion,</hi> yet the Senſation of each Part of the
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1074401200:10"/>Body is ſo very diſtinct; and we have ſo much the Power of moving the Muſcles ſeparate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that, if the Nerves are principal Agents in theſe two Functions, which I ſhall endeavour to prove they are, we have Reaſon to believe that there is no Union, Confuſion or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Communication of the proper nervous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brils, but that each Fibre remains diſtinct from its Origin to its Termination.</p>
               <p n="24">24. Changes produced any way upon the Coats of the Nerves cannot however miſs to affect the nervous Fibrils. The cellular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance may be too full of Liquor or may not ſupply enough; the Liquor may not be of a due Conſiſtence, or it may be preternaturally obſtructed and collected. The <hi>Pia Mater</hi> may be too tenſe or too lax, as may alſo the <hi>Dura Mater;</hi> their Veſſels may be obſtructed; their proper Nerves may be violently irritated or loſe their Power of acting; and a great many other ſuch Changes may happen which will not only occaſion Diſorders in particular Nerves, but may cauſe the <hi>Sympathy</hi> ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently Obſerved among the Nerves, which is ſo neceſſary to be attentively regarded in a great many Diſeaſes in order to diſcover their true State and Nature, without the Knowledge of which we muſt commit very dangerous Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes in the Practice of Phyſick and Surgery.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Many Experiments and Obſervations concur in proving, that when Nerves are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, cut, or any other way deſtroyed, the Parts ſerved by ſuch Nerves farther from the Head or Spine than where the injuring Cauſe has been applied have their Senſations, Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and Nouriſhment weakned or loſt, while
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1074401200:11"/>no ſuch Effects are ſeen in the Parts nearer to the Origins of thoſe Nerves; and in ſuch Experiments where the Cauſe impeding the Nerves to exert themſelves could be removed, and the Structure of the Nerves not injured; as for Example, when a Ligature made upon a Nerve and ſtopping its Influence has been taken away, the Motion and Senſation of the Parts ſoon were reſtored. From which it would appear that the Nerves are principal Inſtruments in our Senſations, Motions and Nouriſhment; and that this Influence of the Nerves is not inherent in them without the Communication between theſe Cords, and their Origin is preſerved.</p>
               <p>It will be no Objection to this Concluſion, that ſometimes, upon cutting a Nerve, the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects above-mentioned have been felt for a ſhort Time, but afterwards the Perſon was ſenſible of no Numneſs or Immobility; for wherever this is ſaid to have happened, the cut Nerve was only one of ſeveral which were ſent to the Member, the want of whoſe Influence would be felt no longer than till the Habit was acquired of performing the Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons caſily by the other Nerves.</p>
               <p>It is of no greater Weight as an Objection, that when a Ligature is drawn very hard upon a Nerve, the Nerve never again recovers its Influence upon the Parts it is diſtributed to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the Ligature, but is of as little Effect as if it had, been cut thro'; which is to ſay, that its Texture has been alter'd beyond Recovery. The ſame Thing is to be ſeen by tying a Thread tight round a tender Twig of any ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getable, it decays.</p>

               <p n="26">26. Experiments and Obſervations ſhew too, that when Parts of the <hi>Encephalon</hi> or <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulla ſpinalis</hi> have been irritated, compreſſed or deſtroyed, the Parts of the Body, whoſe Nerves had their Origin from ſuch affected Parts of the <hi>Encephalon</hi> or <hi>Medulla ſpinalis,</hi> became convulſed, paralytick, inſenſible or waſted; and in ſuch Caſes where the injuring Cauſe could be removed from the Origin of the Nerves, the morbid Symptoms obſerved in the Parts to which theſe Nerves were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed, went off upon the Removal of that Cauſe. From which it is thought reaſonable to conclude, that the Nerves muſt not only have a Communication with their Origin, but that the Influence they have upon the Parts they are diſtributed to, depends on the Influence which they derive from the <hi>Medulla Encephali</hi> and <hi>ſpinalis.</hi>
               </p>

Hence an Injury done to any Part of the <hi>Medulla ſpinalis</hi> immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affects all the Parts whoſe Nerves have their Origin below where the injuring Cauſe is applied to the Spinal Marrow.

If ſuch Cauſes produce conſtantly ſuch Effects (§ 25, 26, 27,) in us and other Creatures living in nearly the ſame Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances as we do, the Concluſions already made will be good, notwithſtanding Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Children and other Creatures being born without <hi>Brains</hi> or <hi>Medulla ſpinalis;</hi> or notwithſtanding the Brains of adult Creatures being much changed in their Texture by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and notwithſtanding the Experiments of cutting off the Heads of <hi>Tortoiſes,</hi> and ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Animals which continued to move about a conſiderable Time after their Heads were off. We may be ignorant of the particular Circumſtances requiſite or neceſſary to the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Wellbeing of this or that particular Creature, and we may be unable to account for a great many Phaenomena; but we muſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve our Eyes in the Examination of Facts, and if we ſee conſtantly ſuch Conſequences from ſuch Actions, we cannot but conclude the one to be the Cauſe, and the other the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.

It is therefore almoſt univerſally agreed that the Nerves are principal Inſtruments in our Senſations, Motion and Nouriſhment, and
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1074401200:14"/>that the Influence which they have is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated from their Origin, the <hi>Encephalon</hi> and <hi>Medulla ſpinallis;</hi> but Authors are far from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeing about the Manner in which this In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is communicated, or in what Way Nerves act to produce theſe Effects.</p>

               <p n="30">30. The Gentlemen, who think the nervous Fibres ſolid, raiſe ſeveral Objections to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Doctrine, which I ſhall conſider after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and endeavour to ſhew the Fitneſs of their own Doctrine to account for the Effects commonly obſerved to be produced by the Nerves.</p>
               <p>The Objects of the Senſes plainly, ſay they, make Impulſes on the Nerves of the proper Organs, which muſt ſhake the nervous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brils, and this Vibration muſt be propagated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long the whole Cord to its other Extremity or Origin, as happens in other tenſe Strings; and theſe Vibrations being differently modified ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Difference of the Object, and its different Application, produce the different Ideas we have of Objects.</p>
               <p n="31">31. To this Account of the Senſations it is objected, 1ſt, That Nerves are unfit for Vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, becauſe their Extremities, where Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects are applied to them, are quite ſoft and pappy, (§ 20.) and not ſuſceptible of the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brations ſuppoſed; and if there could be any little Tremor made here by the Impulſe of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, it could not be continued along the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1074401200:15"/>Cord, becauſe the cellular Subſtance by which each particular Fibre is connected to the neighbouring ones, (§ 10.) and the fatty Subſtance in which the nervous Cord is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed (§ 14) would ſoon ſtifle any ſuch vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bratory Motion.</p>
               <p>The 2<hi>d</hi> Objection to this Doctrine is, that, ſuppoſing the Nerves capable of Vibrations by the Impreſſions of Objects, theſe Vibrations would not anſwer the Deſign. For if what we know of other vibrating Strings, to wit, that their Tone remains the ſame, unleſs their Texture, Length or Tenſion is altered, and that different Subſtances ſtriking them do no more than make the Sound higher or lower: If theſe Properties are to be applied to Nerves, then it will follow that the ſame Nerve would conſtantly convey the ſame Idea, with no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Variety than of its being weaker or ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whatever different Objects were applied to it, unleſs we ſuppoſe the Nerve changed in its Texture, Length or Tenſion each Time a different Object is applied, which, it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed, no Body will undertake to prove does happen. But further, if ever ſuch a Variety of Vibrations could be made, our Senſations would notwithſtanding be confuſed and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, becauſe the tremulous nervous Fibre being firmly connected, and contiguous to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other Fibres of the ſame Cord, would neceſſarily ſhake them too, by which we ſhould have the Notion of the Object as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied at all the different Parts where the Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities of theſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Fibres terminate.</p>
               <p n="32">32. In whatever way the Favourers of the Doctrine of ſolid Nerves pleaſe to apply the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1074401200:16"/>Elaſticity of Nerves to the Contraction of Muſcles; their Adverſaries inſiſt that Nerves are too weak to reſiſt ſuch Weights as the Muſcles ſuſtain, they would ſurely break, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially that they are greatly, if not wholly, deprived of their ſtrong Coats before they come to the Part of the Muſcle, they are immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to act upon (§ 21.) and the Nerves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found to have little or no Elaſticity to ſhorten themſelves (§ 12.) ſhews them alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether unfit for ſuch an Office as this of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting Muſcles in the way propoſed of their acting by Elaſticity.</p>
               <p n="33">33. As a further Objection againſt either Motion or Senſation being owing to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſticity of the Nerves, it is ſaid, that if this Doctrine was true, the Senſations would be more acute, and the Contractions of Muſcles would be greater and ſtronger, when the Parts become firmer and more rigid by Age; for then their Elaſticity is increaſed: Whereas on the contrary it appears, (§ 22.) that then the Senſations are blunted, and muſcular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction becomes leſs and weaker.</p>
               <p n="34">34. If the Nerves were granted to be elaſtic, and to communicate a ſpringy Force to all the Parts they are diſtributed to, they might ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear neceſſary in this View to aſſiſt the Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the nutritious Particles of the Fluids to the Sides of the Veſſels theſe Particles were to repair; and ſo far might well enough ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the Share Nerves are thought to have in Nutrition; yet if we cannot make uſe of Elaſticity in the other two Functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Senſation and Motion, we muſt alſo endeavour to find out ſome other Way the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1074401200:17"/>Nerves act in Nutrition, which will be done afterwards.</p>
               <p n="35">35. Having thus ſtated the Reaſons for and againſt the Nerves acting as ſolid Strings, let us likewiſe relate the Arguments for Nerves being Pipes, and the Objections to this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine.</p>
               <p>A great Argument of thoſe who think the Nerves to be Tubes conveying Liquors, is the ſtrong Analogy of the Brain and Nerves to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Glands of the Body and their Excretories, where a manifeſt Secretion of Liquor is made in the Glands to be conveyed by the Excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, to the proper Places in which it ought to be depoſited: They think that the vaſcular Texture of the Cortex of the <hi>Encephalon</hi> and <hi>Medulla ſpinalis</hi> (§ 1.); the Continuation of the Cortex in forming the medullary Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance (§ 2.3.), the fibrous Texture (§ 5.) and ſucculent State of this <hi>Medulla</hi> (§ 4.), and its being wholly employed to form the Nerves (§6.), where the fibrous Texture is evident (§8.); all theſe Things, ſay they, conſpire to ſhew ſuch a ſtrong Analogy between theſe Parts and the other Glands of the Body, as carries a Conviction that there is a Liquor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted in the <hi>Encephalon</hi> and <hi>Medulla ſpinalis,</hi> to be ſent out by the Nerves to the different Parts of the Body.</p>
               <p n="36">36. The following Objections are raiſed to this Argument in favour of a Liquor convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Nerves, from the Analogy of the Glands. <hi>1ſt,</hi> Other Glands, it is ſaid, have their Excretories collected into a few large Pipes, and not continued in ſuch a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of ſeparate Pipes, as far as the Places
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1074401200:18"/>where the Liquors are depoſited, which laſt muſt be the Caſe, if the Nerves are the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretories of the glandular Brain. 2<hi>dly,</hi> We ſee the Cavities and can examine the Liquors in the Excretories of other Glands much ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler than the Brain, which cannot be done in the Nerves. 3<hi>dly,</hi> If the Nerves were Pipes, they would be ſo ſmall that the Attraction of their Sides to their Liquors would be ſo great, that the Liquors could not be moved with the Celerity required to influence our Senſations and Motions, in the quick Manner we ſee them performed. 4<hi>thly,</hi> If the Nerves were Pipes they would be cylindrical ones, and conſequently not ſubject to Diſeaſes, or at leaſt we could have no Comprehenſion of the Diſeaſes in them.</p>
               <p n="37">37. The Anſwer to the 1ſt of theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections is, That there are other Glands where there is a manifeſt Secretion, and in which the Diſpoſition of the Excretories is in much the ſame way as in the <hi>Encephalon;</hi> the Kidneys, for Example, have a reticulated Cortex of Veſſels, from which the <hi>Euſtachian</hi> or <hi>Bellinian Medulla,</hi> conſiſting of longitudinal Fibres and a few longitudinal Blood Veſſels, proceeds; and this <hi>Medulla</hi> is collected into ten or twelve <hi>Papillae,</hi> each of which is formed of numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſmall ſeparate Pipes, which ſingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Urine into the large membranous Tubes, which united compoſe the <hi>Pelvis.</hi> Upon comparing this Texture of the Kidney with what was ſaid of the <hi>Encephalon,</hi> (§ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8.) the Analogy will be found very ſtrong.</p>
               <p n="38">38. In Anſwer to the 2<hi>d</hi> Objection in § 36.
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:1074401200:19"/>it is granted, that Microſcopes, Injections, and all the other Arts hitherto employed have not ſhewn the Cavities of the nervous Fibrils, or the Liquors contained in them; and from what was ſaid (§ 9.) of the ſmallneſs of the nervous Fibrils, it is not to be expected that ever they ſhould be ſeen. But ſo long as ſuch a Number of little Animals can every Hour be brought to the Framers of this Objection, in which they can as little demonſtrate the Veſſels or contained Fluids, it will not be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be concluſive Reaſoning, that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ocular Demonſtration cannot be given of Pipes, therefore they do not exiſt. For if we have any Notion of an Animal, it is its being a Hydraulick Machine, which has Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors moving in it as long as it has Life; if therefore ſuch little Animals have Veſſels and Liquors which we cannot ſee, why may not ſome of the Veſſels and Liquors of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Body be alſo inviſible to us.</p>
               <p>To avoid this Anſwer to the Objection, it is further urged that tho' we might not ſee the Canals and Liquors of Nerves as they are flowing naturally, yet they ought to diſcover themſelves by the Canals being ſtretched, or a Nerve's ſwelling upon being firmly tied; and it might likewiſe be expected, that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſubtile the Liquor of the Nerves is, it might be collected in ſome Drops at leaſt, when the cut End of a Nerve of a living Animal is kept ſome Time in the exhauſted Receiver of an Air-Pump. It is affirmed, that neither did the tied Nerve ſwell between the Brain and Ligature, nor was there any Liquor collected in the Receiver of the Air-Pump, from which
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1074401200:20"/>it is concluded that there is no Liquor in the Nerves.</p>
               <p>There is ſome Difference among thoſe who ſay they have tried theſe Experiments, ſome affirming that in young Animals the Nerve does ſwell above the Ligature, and that a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor does drill out upon cutting a Nerve. But allowing the Experiments to ſucceed any way, the Reply to the Inference from them is, that in neither way are they any thing to the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; for the ſwelling of the Nerve after it is tied, or the Efflux of Liquors from its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, will never prove either to be the Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the Fluid in the proper nervous Fibrils, ſo long as they might be occaſioned by the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors in the larger Veſſels of the cellular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Nerves; and if theſe ſame Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of the Coats of the Nerves do not dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover their Liquors by theſe Experiments, it is far leſs to be expected that the much more ſubtile Nerves ſhould.</p>
               <p n="39">39. The 3<hi>d</hi> Objection to the Doctrine of the Brain being a Gland, and the Nerves its Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretories, ſuppoſes a more rapid Motion ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in the Fluid of the Nerves, than what moſt of the Defenders of the nervous Fluid will now allow, and is afterwards to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered particularly in a more proper Place.</p>
               <p n="40">40. The 4<hi>th</hi> Objection being, that if Nerves are Excretories of a Gland, they muſt be cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lindrical Pipes, in which no Obſtructions or Diſeaſes would happen; but ſince we daily ſee Diſeaſes in the Nerves, they muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not be ſuch Excretories. The Anſwer is, That Diſeaſes happen often in the Excretories of other Glands as of the Liver, Kidneys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:1074401200:21"/>notwithſtanding their cylindrical Form, and their much ſhorter and leſs expoſed Courſe. When we conſider the very tender Subſtance of the Brain; the vaſt Complication of Veſſels there; the prodigious Smalneſs of the Pipes going out from it; the many moving Powers which the Nerves are to undergo the ſhock of; and the many Chances which the Veſſels, Membranes and cellular Subſtance accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying the Nerves have of being diſordered, and then affecting the nervous Fibrils, we have very great Reaſon to be ſurprized, that theſe cylindrical Pipes are not much more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently put out of Order by too great or too ſmall a Quantity of Liquors; by too viſcid or too thin Fluids; by Liquors conſiſting of too mild and ſluggiſh Particles, or of too acrid pungent ones; by too great or too little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given to the Liquors; by the Diameters of the Pipes being too much ſtraitned, or too much enlarged; and by a great many other Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rieties of Circumſtances which might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed capable of diſturbing the Functions of the Nerves, ſuppoſing them to be cylindrical Excretories of the Gland the Brain.</p>
               <p n="41">41. The numerous Veſſels of the <hi>Encepha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> have brought ſome of the Gentlemen who defend the Opinion of the Nerves being ſolid, to acknowledge, that there is a Liquor ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creted in the Brain; but then they will not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low that this Liquor is ſent out by the proper nervous Fibrils, but that it is poured into the cellular Subſtance in which the Nerves ly, to keep them moiſt and ſupple, and therefore fit for exerting their Elaſticity, Vibration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:1074401200:22"/>by which, in their Opinion, the Effects com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly aſcribed to Nerves are produced.</p>
               <p n="42">42. Beſides the Objections already men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned (§ 31, 32,) againſt the Nerves acting as elaſtick Strings, this Opinion has ſome other Difficulties attending it, that may be urged as Objections to it; ſuch as, there is not one Example in the Body of Liquors ſecreted in a large Gland being poured into a cellular Su<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtance, as here ſuppoſed; the Liquors in the Cells of the <hi>tunica cellularis</hi> of other Parts are ſeparated from the little Arteries which are diſtributed to theſe Cells.</p>
               <p>Further, it can't be well determined, how a Liquor ſecreted in the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the Brain ſhould make its Way through the <hi>Medulla</hi> to come out into the cellular Membranes on the Surface of that <hi>Medulla.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> A very ſimple Experiment of inje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting Water by the Artery of any Member, and thereby filling the cellular ſubſtance of the Nerves of that Member, ſhews evidently that the Liquor of the <hi>tunica cellularis</hi> of the Nerves has the ſame Fountain as the Liquor in the <hi>tunica cellularis</hi> has any where elſe, that is, from the little Arteries diſperſed upon it.</p>
               <p n="43">43. The Doctrine of a Fluid in the Nerves is not only thus ſupported by the Analogy of the Brain and Nerves to the other Glands and their Excretories, but thoſe who maintain this Doctrine mention an Experiment which they think directly probative of a Fluid in the Nerves; it is this. After opening the Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax of a living Dog, catch hold of and preſs one or both the phrenic Nerves with the Fingers, the <hi>Diaphragm</hi> immediately ceaſes
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1074401200:23"/>to contract; then let go the hold of the Nerves, and the Muſcle acts again: Pinch a ſecond time the Nerve or Nerves ſome way above the <hi>Diaphragm,</hi> this Muſcle again ceaſes to act: Keep firm the Hold of the Nerve, and with the Fingers of the other Hand ſtrip it down from the gripping Fingers towards the <hi>Diaphragm,</hi> and the Muſcle is made to contract; and for three or four ſuch Stripings its Action follows or obeys the Motion of the Fingers which ſtrip it down; then it becomes diſobedient, and will contract no more, ſtrip as you will, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Fingers gripping or pinching the Nerve let go their Hold, or are removed higher up upon the Nerve, when the Muſcle may again be made to contract by ſtripping the Nerve down towards it. This Experiment I have done with the Succeſs here mentioned. Let any one try if he can imagine any other reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Account of theſe Appearances, than that the gripping Fingers ſtopt the Courſe of a Fluid in the Nerve; that what of this Fluid was thus made to ſtagnate in the Part of the Nerve between the gripping Fingers and <hi>Diaphragm,</hi> was forced down into that Muſcle by the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Fingers which ſtripped the Nerve down; and when ever this ſtagnating Fluid was preſſed all away by ſeveral Repetitions of ſtripping the Nerve, the Muſcle being ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with no more Fluid contracted no more, till upon removing the Fingers which had hold of the Nerve, a new Supply of Liquor was brought from the Brain, or from the Part of the Nerve that had not yet been grip'd or ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; and when ever this Liquor could make its Way down to the Muſcle, or was forced

The Objections mentioned (§ 31.) a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſenſatory Nerves acting by Vibra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions take place here: And further, there is nothing in the Texture either of the Brain or Nerves, which gives any Reaſon to think, that the Nerves are differently formed; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, the Structure is every where ſimilar, and often Branches of the ſame Nerve ſerve both for Senſation and Motion. What occaſioned juſtly a Prejudice againſt the Scheme of our Senſations depending on a Fluid in the Nerves, to wit, the rapid Refluxes ſuppoſed in the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Nerves, is an Opinion now deſerted ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally by the Defenders of the nervous Fluid, for Reaſons to be given in a little, tho' their Opponents are ſtill willing to palm it on them, whereby they may have a better Handle againſt the general Doctrine of the nervous Fluid.</p>

For tho' the momentary Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of an Object might cauſe an Accele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Fluid of venous Nerves, yet if the Object was kept applied to the Nerves, it would ſtop their Fluid, ſo that it could not go

               <p n="48">48. Let us now ſuppoſe it probable, that the <hi>Encephalon</hi> and <hi>Medulla ſpinalis</hi> ſecern a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor from the Blood which is ſent into all the Nerves, and that by the Means of this Liquor the Nerves perform the Offices commonly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to them, it is neceſſary to enquire what Kind of Liquor this is, and how it moves, in order to determine how well its Nature and Motion are fitted for performing what is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from it.</p>
               <p n="49">49. It has been ſuppoſed, that the Liquor of the Nerves was of a very ſtrong acid or alca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Nature; but ſince we can ſee none of our Juices of ſuch Natures, and ſince ſuch Liquors irritate and deſtroy the Parts of the Body they are applied to, we can never imagine that the Brain could ſeparate, or the Nerves could bear any Thing of ſuch an acrid Nature; and this ſame Tenderneſs and Senſibility of theſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans muſt hinder us to ſuppoſe the Liquor of the Nerves can be acrid or pungent of any Kind, as of the Nature of inflammable Spirits, Spirit of Harthorn, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Some have imagined the Liquor of the Nerves to be capable of vaſt Exploſion, like Gunpowder, or of violent ſudden Raretaction like Air, or of ſtrong Ebullition like boiling Water, or the Mixture of Acids with alkaline Liquors.

               <p n="51">51. We know not ſufficiently the Properties of an <hi>Aether</hi> pervading every Thing, to pretend to apply it to the animal Functions, eſpecially where we muſt ſuppoſe it ſent a great Way in a long Cord, in which we cannot conceive how it ſhould be confined; which are Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties not to be ſurmounted in accounting for the Functions of Nerves by Means of ſuch an <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="52">52. The ſureſt Way of judging what Kind of Liquor this of the Nerves muſt be, is to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the Liquors of ſimilar Parts of the Body. All the Glands ſeparate Liquors from the Blood much thinner than the compound Maſs itſelf; ſuch is the <hi>Liquor</hi> poured into the Cavity of the <hi>Abdomen, Thorax, Ventricles of the Brain,</hi> the <hi>Saliva, pancreatic Juice, Lymph,</hi> &amp;c. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there is Occaſion for ſecreted Liquors being thick and viſcid, in order to anſwer bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Uſes they are intended for, Nature has provided Reſervoirs for them to ſtagnate in, where their thinner Parts may be carried off by the numerous abſorbent Veins diſperſed on the Sides of thoſe Cavities, or by flying off where there is a Communication with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Air. The <hi>Snot of the Noſe</hi> is very thick commonly by ſtagnating; but when the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Membrane of the Noſe is in creaſed by blowing the Noſe, or by Sternuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, we ſee it very thin and watry; there
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1074401200:28"/>not then Time for the Air or Abſorbents to carry off the more watry Particles. The <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rumen</hi> of the Ears is of a watry Conſiſtence, when ſqueezed out before it has ſtagnated. The <hi>Mucus</hi> of the alimentary Canal is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cocted in <hi>Lacunae.</hi> The <hi>Bile</hi> in the hepatick Duct is lymphatick; that in the Gall-bladder is viſcid and ſtrong.

               </p>
               <p n="53">53. From § 52. we may ſafely conclude, that the Secretion of a thing Liquor is made in the <hi>Cortex</hi> of the <hi>Encephalon</hi> and <hi>Medulla ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalis;</hi> and ſeeing the Thinneſs of ſecreted Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors is generally as the Diviſions of the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels into ſmall ſubtile Branches, and the Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mifications within the Skull are carried on to a very great Subtilty, the Liquor ſecreted in the <hi>Encephalon</hi> may be determined to be among the fineſt or thinneſt Fluids.</p>
               <p n="54">54. Seeing we can obſerve no large Reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voire, where the Liquor ſecerned in the <hi>corti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Subſtance</hi> is depoſited, to have its finer Parts taken off, we have Reaſon to think, that it goes forward into the Nerves in the ſame Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in which it is ſecerned.</p>
               <p n="55">55. By fine or ſubtile animal Liquors is meant no more than thoſe which are very flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>id, conſiſting of a large Proportion of watry Particles, and a leſſer one of the oily, ſaline and terreſtrious Particles. Some of the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors which we can have in ſufficient Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to make Experiments with, are ſo fluid, and have ſo little Viſcidity or Coheſion of Parts,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:1074401200:29"/>that when laid on a Piece of clean Mirrour, they will evaporate without leaving a Stain on the Mirrour, ſuch is the Liquor drilling out on the Surface of the Pleura, the Lymph, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral others.</p>
               <p>If then theſe Liquors, which are ſubject to our Examination, the ſecerning Veſſels of which are ſo large that we can ſee them, have ſuch a ſmall Coheſion of Farts, it might not be unreaſonable to ſay, that the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor of the Nerves is as much more fine and fluid than Lymph, as the Veſſels ſeparating it are ſmaller; and therefore that the Fluid of the Nerves is a defecated Water with a very ſmall Proportion of <hi>animal Sapo</hi> diſſolved in it.</p>
               <p n="56">56. Two Experiments are ſaid to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict this Opinion of the Liquor of the Nerves being ſo fluid and ſubtile. One is, that upon cutting the <hi>Cauda equina</hi> of a living Anim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

The Nerves, as well as the other Excretories of the Glands are always full of Liquors, the Degree of Diſtenſion of the Canals by the Liquors being, even in a ſound natural State, ſometimes more and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leſs, the Sides of the Tubes being ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched to make way for a larger Quantity, and contracting to accommodate themſelves to a leſſer Quantity; as much Liquor as does Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the Sides of the Canals in ſtretching, or ſo little as the Sides cannot contract to, both occaſion Diſeaſes.</p>
               <p n="58">58. The Motion of the Fluid in the Nerves will not only then be conſtant, but it will alſo be equal, or nearly ſo: For tho' the Blood in the larger Arteries is moved unequally by the unequal Forces, the Contraction of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricle of the Heart, and the weaker Power, the Syſtole of the Arteries, yet the Difference between theſe two moving Powers comes to be leſs and leſs perceptible, as the Arteries divide into ſmaller Branches, becauſe of the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Reſiſtances the Liquors meet with, and becauſe the Canals they move in become larger, till in the very ſmall arterious Branches there is no Difference in the Velocity of the Liquors from the Effect of the Heart or Arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie. The Motion of the Fluids muſt ſtill be more equal in the Excretories of Glands,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1074401200:31"/>and particularly in thoſe where the Veſſels have divided into very minute Branches. So that the nervous Fluid will move conſtantly, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſlowly for ordinary; but this natural Courſe may be alter'd by the Influence of the Mind, or by the Preſſure of ſome neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing active Organ.</p>

               <p>In general we may well enough ſay, that Nerves can carry Fluids to the moſt minute Part of the Body, to ſupply what is waſted in any of the ſolids; that the Impreſſion made by the Objects of the Senſes on the very ſoft pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1074401200:43"/>then each being joined by a Franch of the fifth Pair of Nerves is ſpread on the Membrane of the Noſe.</p>
               <p>The tender Structure and ſudden Expanſion of theſe Nerves on ſuch a large Surface ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it impoſſible to trace them far; which has made ſome Authors deny them to be Nerves: But when we break the Circumference of the <hi>cribriform Lamella,</hi> and then gently raiſe it, we may ſee the Diſtribution of the Nerves ſome way on the Membrane of the Noſe.</p>
               <p>The Contrivance of defending theſe long ſoft Nerves from being too much preſſed by the anterior Lobes of the Brain under which they lye, is ſingular, becauſe they have not only the prominent orbitar Proceſſes of the frontal Bone, and the <hi>Criſta Galli</hi> of the <hi>Eth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moid</hi> Bone to ſupport the Brain on each Side, with the <hi>Falx</hi> by means of the Veins going in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the longitudinal Sinus, and other Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments bearing it up in the Middle, but have a Groove formed in each Lobe of the Brain itſelf for them to lodge in. Their ſplitting into ſo many ſmall Branches before they enter the Bones of the Skull is likewiſe peculiar to them; for generally the Nerves come from the Brain in diſgregated Filaments, and unite into Cords, as they are going out at the Holes of the Bones: But we ſhall find that this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance is the beſt for anſwering the Purpoſe they are deſigned for, of being the Organ of ſmelling; for had they been expanded upon the Membrane of the Noſe into a medullary Web, ſuch as the optic Nerve forms, it would have been too ſenſible to bear the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of ſuch Objects as are applied to it,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1074401200:44"/>and a Diſtribution in the more common way of a Cord ſending off Branches, would not have been equal enough for ſuch an Organ of Senſation.</p>
               <p>The 2<hi>d</hi> Pair of Nerves are the <hi>OPTIC,</hi> which riſe each from the <hi>thalami nervorum op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticorum,</hi> and then after making a large Curve outwards, run obliquely inwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards till they unite at the Fore-part of the <hi>Sella Turcica,</hi> and then dividing again, each runs obliquely forwards and outwards to go out at its proper Hole in the ſphenoid Bone, accompanied with the proper ocular Artery, to run afterwards to the Globe of the Eye, within which each is extended into a very fine Cup-like Web that lines all the In-ſide of the Eye as far forwards as the <hi>ciliary Circle,</hi> and is univerſally known by the Name of <hi>Retina.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' the Subſtance of theſe two Nerves ſeems to be blended at the Place where they are joined, yet Obſervations of People whoſe optic Nerves were not joined at all, and of others who have been blind of one Eye from a Fault in the optic Nerve, or in thoſe who have had one of their Eyes taken out, make it appear that there is no ſuch intimate Union of Subſtance, the optic Nerve of the affected Side only being w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

In many Fiſhes indeed the Doctrine of Decuſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is favoured, for their optic Nerves plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1074401200:45"/>croſs each other without any Union at the Part where they are joined in Men and moſt Quadrupeds.</p>
               <p>Thoſe People, whoſe optic Nerves were not joined, having neither ſeen Objects double, nor turned their Eyes different Ways, is alſo a plain Proof that the Conjunction of the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic Nerves will not ſerve to account for either the uniform Motions of our Eyes, or our ſeeing Objects ſingle with two Eyes.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Retina</hi> of a recent Eye, without any Preparation, appears a very fine Web, with ſome Blood-veſſels coming from its Center to be diſtributed on it; but after a good In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of the Arteries that run in the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of this Nerve as is common to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nerves, it is with Difficulty that we can obſerve its nervous medullary Subſtance.

The next conſiderable Branch of the ſuperior maxillary Nerve is ſent into the Noſe by the Hole common to the Palate and ſphenoidal Bone, and the remaining Part of this Nerve runs in the <hi>Palato-maxillaris</hi> Canal, giving off Branches to the Temples and Pterygoid Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and comes at laſt into the Palate to be loſt. Hence the Ach in the Teeth of the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Jaw occaſions a gnawing Pain deep ſeated in the Bones of the Face, with a Swelling in the Eye-lids, Cheek, Noſe and upper Lip; and on the other hand, an Inflammation in theſe Parts is often attended with ſharp Pain in the Teeth. Hence an Obſtruction in the Duct of the maxillary Sinus, which obliges the Liquor ſecreted there to find out a preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural Rout for itſelf, as I have ſeen more than once, may be occaſioned by the Pain of the Teeth.</p>

<pb n="48" facs="tcp:1074401200:51"/>to form the Beginning of the <hi>intercoſtal</hi> Nerve; or, according to other Authors, this Nerve comes up from the great <hi>Ganglion</hi> of the <hi>Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſtal</hi> to be joined to the ſixth here.</p>
               <p>The Arguments for this latter Opinion are, That according to the common Opinion, this Beginning of the <hi>intercoſtal</hi> Nerve, as 'tis cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, would riſe in a Manner not ſo ordinary in Nerves. In the next Place it is obſerved, that the ſixth Pair is larger nearer to the Orbit, than it is before it comes to the Place where this Nerve is ſaid to go off; and therefore it is more probable, that it receives an Addition there rather than gives off a Branch. <hi>Laſtly,</hi> It is found, that upon cutting the <hi>intercoſtal</hi> Nerves of living Animals, the Eyes plainly were affected, they loſt their bright Water, the Gum, or Gore, as we call it, was ſeparated in greater Quantity, the Pupil was more contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, the cartilaginous Membrane at the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Canthus came more over the Eye, and the Eye-ball itſelf was diminiſhed.</p>
               <p>To this it is anſwered in Defence of the more common Doctrine, that other Branches of Nerves go off in a reflected Way as well as this does, ſuppoſing it to be the Beginning of the Intercoſtal, and that the Reflection would rather be greater, if it is thought to come up from the Intercoſtal to the ſixth. <hi>2<hi>dly,</hi>

So that the Arguments are ſtill e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quivocal, and more Obſervations and Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments muſt be made before it can be determined with Certainty, whether the ſixth Pair gives or receives a Branch here.

               <p>At this ſame Place where the Intercoſtal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins, the fifth Pair is contiguous and adherent to the ſixth; and it is generally ſaid, that the ophthalmic Branch of the fifth gives a Branch or two to the Beginning of the Intercoſtal, or receives ſuch from it. Others deny any ſuch Communication between them, and thoſe who affirm the Communication confeſs, that in ſome Subjects they could not ſee it. After examining the Nerves here in a great many Subjects, I cannot determine whether or not there are nervous Filaments going from the one to the other. Sometimes I thought I traced them evidently; at other times I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved what I diſſected for nervous Filaments, to be no other than collapſed cellular Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; and in all the Subjects where I had puſhed an Injection ſucceſsfully into the very ſmall Arteries, I could only obſerve a <hi>Plexus</hi>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:1074401200:53"/>of Veſſels connecting the one to the other. In any of theſe Ways however there is as much Connection, as we are aſſured from many Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments and Obſervations on other Nerves, is ſufficient to make a very great Sympathy among the Nerves here.

<pb n="51" facs="tcp:1074401200:54"/>the fifth, or the ſudden violent Reflexion it would ſuffer, on the Suppoſition of its coming from the fifth to the ſeventh, whereas ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing its Courſe from the ſeventh to the fifth, its Courſe would be more in the ordinary Way, has made ſome ſay, that this <hi>Chorda tympani</hi> ſhould be eſteemed a Branch of the ſeventh Pair going to join the fifth. This ſame ſmaller Packet of the ſeventh gives Branches to the Muſcles of the <hi>Malleus</hi> and to the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> while it paſſes through the bony crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Canal, and at laſt comes out in a firm Cord named <hi>PORTIO DURA,</hi> at the Extremity of this Canal, between the <hi>ſtyloid</hi> and <hi>maſtoid</hi> Proceſſes of the temporal Bone, giving imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately Filaments to the little oblique Muſcles of the Head, and to thoſe that riſe from the ſtyloid Proceſs. It then pierces through the parotid Gland, and divides into a great many Branches, which are diſperſed in the Muſcles and Teguments that cover all the Side of the ſuperior Part of the Neck, the whole Face and <hi>Cranium,</hi> as far back as the Temples, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding a conſiderable Part of the external Ear. Its Branches having thus a conſiderable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with all the three Branches of the fifth Pair, and with the ſecond cervical, occaſions a conſiderable Sympathy of theſe Nerves with it. Hence in the Tooth-ach, the Pain is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times very little in the affected Tooth, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to what it is all along the Side of the Head and in the Ear. Hence probably the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Tooth-ach by Bliſters applied behind the Ear, or by a hot Iron touching the <hi>Antihe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix</hi> of the Ear. By this Communication or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion poſſibly too it is, that a vibrating String
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1074401200:55"/>held between one's Teeth, gives him a ſtrong Idea of its Sound which no other can hear. Perhaps too the Diſtribution of this Nerve oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions the Head to be ſo quickly turned upon the Impreſſion of Sound on our Ears.</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1074401200:56"/>Curve of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> both of them mounting up again at the Side of the <hi>O Eſophagus,</hi> to which they give Branches, are loſt at laſt in the <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rynx.</hi> Theſe are called the <hi>RECURRENT</hi> Nerves, which we are deſired to ſhun in the Operation of <hi>Bronchotomy,</hi> tho' their deep Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation protects them ſufficiently. The Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles of the <hi>Larynx</hi> being in a good meaſure ſupplied with Nerves from the Recurrents, it is to be expected, that the cutting of them will greatly weaken the Voice, tho' it will not be entirely loſt, ſo long as the ſuperior Branches of the eighth Pair are entire.</p>
               <p>At or near the Place where the recurrent Nerves go off from the eighth Pair, or frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the Recurrents themſelves, Nerves go off to the <hi>Pericardium,</hi> and to join with the Branches of the Intercoſtal that are diſtributed to the Heart.</p>
               <p>After theſe Branches are ſent off, the <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagum</hi> on each Side deſcends behind the great Branch of the <hi>Trachea</hi> and gives numerous Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laments to the Lungs in going to the <hi>O E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               <p>From the Diſtribution of this <hi>Par vagum,</hi> we may learn how tickling the <hi>Fauces</hi> with a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1074401200:57"/>Feather or any ſuch Subſtance, excites a Nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea and Inclination to vomit. Why cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occaſions vomiting, or vomiting raiſes a Cough. Hence we ſee how the nervous <hi>Aſthma</hi> and the <hi>Tuſſis convulſiva,</hi> Kinkcough, are attended with a ſtraitning of the <hi>Glottis.</hi> How Food ill to digeſt brings on the <hi>Aſthma</hi> on weakly People, and why <hi>Emetics</hi> have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently cured the <hi>Aſthma</hi> very ſpeedily. How the ſuperior Orifice of the Stomach is ſo ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as to be looked on as the Seat of the Soul by ſome. How People ſubject to Diſtenſions of the Stomach have ſo often the Senſations of Balls in their Breaſt or Throats. Why the <hi>Globus hyſtericus</hi> is ſo often attended with a violent Strangulation at the <hi>Glottis.</hi> The Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pathy among the Branches of theſe Nerves will lead us to underſtand theſe and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Phaenomena.</p>
               <p>The <hi>NINTH PAIR</hi> of Nerves comes from the inferior Part of the <hi>Corpora pyramidalia,</hi> to go out of the Skull at their proper Holes of the occipital Bones. After their Egreſs they adhere for ſome way firmly to the 8th and Intercoſtal, and then ſending a Branch that in many Subjects is joined with Branches of the firſt and ſecond cervical Nerves, to be diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the Thyroid Gland and Muſcles on the Fore-part of the <hi>Trachea Arteria,</hi> the 9th is loſt in the Muſcles and Subſtance of the Tongue. Some have thought this Nerve, and others have eſteemed the third Branch of the fifth Pair of Nerves to be the proper guſtatory Nerve. I know no Obſervations or Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to prove either Opinion, or to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that both the Nerves may not ſerve for
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1074401200:58"/>Taſting, and for the Motion of the Tongue.</p>
               <p>The <hi>TENTH PAIR</hi> riſes from the Sides of the <hi>Medulla ſpinalis,</hi> to go out between the <hi>Os Occipitis</hi> and <hi>firſt Vertebra</hi> of the Neck. After each of them gives a Branch to the great Ganglion of the Intercoſtal Nerve, they are diſtributed to the oblique Muſcles, and to ſome of the Extenſors of the Head. Whether the Name of the tenth of the Head, or of the firſt Vertebral, ought to be given to this Nerve, is of no ſuch Conſequence as to deſerve a Debate.</p>
               <p>In the Deſcription of the ſixth Pair, I ſaid that I would uſe the way of ſpeaking which moſt Anatomiſts have, to wit, I would ſay that the Beginning of the Intercoſtal Nerve comes out of the Skull, and therefore ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ng its much larger Part is compoſed of Nerves coming out from the <hi>Medulla ſpinalis.</hi> There is no greater Incongruity in Point of Method to ſay, that a Nerve one is deſcribing receives Additions from Nerves that have not been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, than it is to repeat in the Deſcription of a great many Nerves, that each of them gives Branches to form a Nerve which we are ignorant of, which is all the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween deſcribing the Intercoſtal before or after the ſpinal Nerves.</p>
               <p>The Branch reflected from the ſixth Pair, joined poſſibly by ſome Filaments of the <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phthalmic</hi> Branch of the fifth, runs along with the internal Carotid thro' the crooked Canal formed for this Artery in the <hi>temporal Bone,</hi> where the little Nerve is very ſoft and pappy,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1074401200:59"/>and in ſeveral Subjects divides and unites a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain before it comes out of the Skull. As soon as the Nerve eſcapes out of this bony Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal it is connected a little way with the eighth and ninth, then ſeparating from them, after ſeeming to receive additional Nerves from them, it forms a <hi>large Ganglion,</hi> into which Branches from the tenth of the Head, and from the firſt and ſecond cervical enter. From this Ganglion the Nerves come out again ſmall to run down the Neck along with the carotid Artery, communicating by Branches with the cervical Nerves, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Nerves to the Muſcles that bend the Head and Neck. As the <hi>Intercoſtal</hi> is about to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Thorax,</hi> it forms another Ganglion from which Nerves are ſent to the Trachea and to the Heart; theſe deſigned for the Heart joining with the Branches of the eighth, and paſſing between the two great Arteries and the Auricles to the Subſtance of that Muſcle. The Intercoſtal after this being compoſed of two Branches, one going behind, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther running over the anterior Part of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clavian Artery, forms a new Ganglion where the two Branches unite below that Artery, and then deſcending along the Sides of the <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae</hi> of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> receives Branches from each of the dorſal Nerves, which Branches appearing to come out between the Ribs, have given the Name of Intercoſtal to the whole Nerve. Where the Addition is made to it from the fifth dorſal Nerve, a Branch goes off ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely forwards, which being joined by other ſuch Branches from the ſixth, ſeventh, eighth and ninth darſal, an anterior Trunk is form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

               <p>The almoſt univerſal Connection and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication this Nerve has with the other Nerves of the Body, may lead us to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand a great many <hi>Phaenomena,</hi> where one otherwiſe would be greatly ſurprized at the Sympathy to be obſerved among the Parts of the Body. One who knows the Courſe of this Nerve will readily underſtand why a Stone in the Kidneys, or Ureters, or any other Cauſe irritating thoſe Organs, ſhould ſo much more frequently bring on Vomiting and other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders of the Stomach, than the Stone or any other ſtimulating Cauſe in the Bladder does. The Obſtructions of the <hi>Menſes</hi> will hence appear capable of occaſioning Strangulations, Belching, Colicks, Stomach-aches, and even Convulſions in the Extremities may be owing to ſuch Obſtructions, or to any violent Irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Stomach or Guts. With a View to theſe Communications, I have frequently applied Veſicatories from the Ears to the Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vicles of Children labouring under the <hi>Tuſſis convulſiva</hi> with obſervable good Succeſs.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſpinal</hi> Nerves riſe generally by a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of diſgregated Fibres from both the ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior and poſterior Part of the <hi>Medulla ſpinalis,</hi> and ſoon after form a little Knot or Ganglion where they get on their firm Coats, and are extended into firm Cords.

               <p>To the Irritation of the Branches of this Nerve, it probably is, that in an Inflammation of the parotid Gland, the Neck is pain'd as far down as the Clavicle, the Head is drawn towards the Shoulder of the affected Side, and the Chin is turned to the other Side. In open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the external Jugular-Vein, no Operator can promiſe not to touch ſome of the cutane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Branches of this Nerve with the Edge of the Lancet, which occaſions a ſharp pricking Pain in the mean Time, and a Numneſs of the Skin near the Orifice for ſome Time after.</p>
               <p>The <hi>THIRD PAIR</hi> of the Neck paſſes out between the third and fourth cervical <hi>Verte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brae,</hi> having immediately a Communication with the ſecond, and ſending down a Branch, which being joined by a Branch from the fourth cervical forms the <hi>PHRENIC</hi> Nerve.

<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1074401200:67"/>mentioned this Nerve to be ſent to, after a Wound in the internal inferior Part of the Arm.</p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>RADIALIS</hi> accompanies the humeral Artery to the bending of the Elbow, ſerving the Flexors of the Cubit in its Way; then, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter giving large Nerves to the Muſcles on the Fore-part of the Fore-arm, it continues its Courſe near to the <hi>Radius,</hi> beſtowing Branches on the circumjacent Muſcles. Near the Wriſt it gives off a Nerve which is diſtributed to the Back of the Hand, and the convex Part of the Thumb, and ſeveral of the Fingers. The larger Part of this Nerve paſſing behind the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nular Ligament of the Wriſt gives Nerves to the ſhort Muſcles of the Thumb, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſends a Branch along each Side of the Sheath of the Tendons of the Flexors of the Thumb, Fore-finger, Middle-finger, and one Branch to the Side of the Ring-finger next to the Middle, to be loſt on the concave Side of thoſe Fingers.</p>
               <p>The Manner of theſe Nerves of the Fingers, both from the <hi>Ulnar</hi> and <hi>Radial</hi> going off, is that a ſingle Branch is ſent from the Trunk to the Side of the Thumb and Little-finger far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt from the other Fingers; and all the reſt are ſupplied by a Trunk of a Nerve, which ſplits into two ſome way before it comes as far as the End of the <hi>Metacarpus,</hi> to run along the Sides of different Fingers that are neareſt to each other.</p>
               <p>It might have been obſerved, that in deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poſterior Branches of the <hi>ulnar</hi> and <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dial Nerve,</hi> I did not mention the particular Fingers, to the convex Part of which, they were
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1074401200:68"/>diſtributed. My Reaſon for this Omiſſion is the Uncertainty of their Distribution; for tho' ſometimes theſe poſterior Branches go to the ſame Fingers, to the concave Part of which their anterior Branches are ſent, yet frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they are diſtributed otherwiſe, and I ought to obſerve that the muſcular Nerve has not always that Termination in the Back of the Hand which I mentioned.</p>
               <p n="6">6. <hi>ARTICULARIS</hi> ſinks downwards at the <hi>Axilla,</hi> to get below the Neck of the ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Head of the <hi>Os humeri,</hi> and to mount a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the Back-part of it; ſo that it almoſt ſurrounds the Articulation, and is diſtributed to the Muſcles that draw the Arm back and raiſe it up.</p>
               <p n="7">7. <hi>SCAPULARIS</hi> runs ſtraight to the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitas ſemilunata</hi> of the upper <hi>Coſta</hi> of the <hi>Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pula,</hi> which is made a Hole in the recent Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, a Ligament being extended from one Angle of the Bone to the other, giving Nerves in its Way to the Muſcles of the <hi>Scapula.</hi> When it has paſſed this Hole it ſupplies the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praſpinatus</hi> Muſcle, and then deſcending at the anterior Root of the <hi>Spine</hi> of the <hi>Scapula,</hi> it is loſt in the other Muſcles that lye on the <hi>Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum</hi> of the <hi>Scapula.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Situation of theſe brachial Nerves in the <hi>Axilla,</hi> may let us ſee how a Weakneſs and Atrophy may be brought on the Arms by long continued Preſſure of Crutches, or ſuch other hard Subſtances on this Part; and the Courſe of them from the Neck to the Arm may teach us how much better Effects, Veſicatories or ſtimulating nervous Medicines would have, when applied to the Skin, covering the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1074401200:69"/>Proceſſes of the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> or at the <hi>Axilla,</hi> than when they are put between the Shoulders, or upon the ſpinal Proceſſes in Convulſions or Palſies of the ſuperior Extremities, where a Stimulus is required.</p>
               <p>The <hi>TWELVE DORSAL</hi> Nerves of each Side as ſoon as they eſcape from between the <hi>Vertebrae,</hi> ſend a Branch forward to join the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercoſtal, by which a Communication is made among them all, and they ſoon likewiſe give Branches backwards to the Muſcles that raiſe the Trunk of the Body, their principal Trunk being extended outwards to come at the Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in the lower Edge of each Rib, in which they run toward the anterior Part of the <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax,</hi> between the internal and external interco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal Muſcles, giving off Branches in their Courſe to the Muſcles and Teguments of the <hi>Thorax.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>FIRST</hi> Dorſal has already been ſaid to have this Particular in it, that it contributes to form the brachial Nerves, and that the two Branches of the Intercoſtal, which come down to the <hi>Thorax,</hi> form a conſiderable Ganglion with it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>SIX</hi> inferior dorſal Nerves give Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to the Diaphragm and abdominal Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>TWELFTH</hi> joins with the firſt Lum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, and beſtows Nerves on the <hi>Muſculus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dratus Lumborum</hi> and <hi>Iliacus internus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>May not the Communications of all theſe Nerves be one Reaſon of the Parts they ſerve acting ſo uniformly and conjunctly in Reſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and conſpiring together in the convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Motions of Coughing, Sneezing, <hi>&amp;c?</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="tcp:1074401200:70"/>The twitching Spaſms that happen ſometimes in different Parts of the Muſcles of the <hi>Abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> by any Irritation on the Branches of the lower dorſal Nerves are in Danger of occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioning a Miſtake in Practice, by their Reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to the Colick, <hi>Nephritis, &amp;c.</hi> The Communications of theſe lower ones with the Intercoſtals may ſerve to explain the violent Effort of the abdominal Muſcles in a <hi>Teneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus</hi> and in Child-bearing.</p>
               <p>As the Intercoſtal is ſo much larger in the <hi>Thorax</hi> than any where elſe, and ſeems to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh gradually as it aſcends and deſcends, there is ſome Suſpicion that the Trunk of it is here, from which the ſuperior and inferior Parts are ſent as Branches.</p>
               <p>The <hi>FIVE LUMBAR</hi> Nerves on each Side communicate with the Intercoſtal and with each other, and give poſterior Branches to the Loins.</p>
               <p>The <hi>FIRST</hi> commuicates with the laſt dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, ſends Branches to the abdominal Muſcles, to the <hi>Pſoas</hi> and <hi>Iliacus,</hi> and to the Teguments and Muſcles on the anterior Part of the Thigh; while its principal Branch joins with other Nerves to form the crural Nerve.</p>
               <p>The <hi>SECOND LUMBAR</hi> Nerve paſſes through the <hi>Pſoas Muſcle,</hi> and is diſtributed nearly in the ſame Way as the former, as is alſo the <hi>THIRD.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Branches of the <hi>firſt, ſecond</hi> and <hi>third</hi> make up one Trunk, which runs along the anterior Part of the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> and paſſing in the Notch at the anterior Part of the great Hole common to the <hi>Os Pubis</hi> and <hi>Iſchium,</hi> is ſpent on the <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductor</hi> Muſcles and the Teguments on the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1074401200:71"/>of the Thigh. This Nerve is called the <hi>OBTURATOR</hi> or <hi>POSTERIOR CRURAL NERVE.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>By united Branches from the <hi>firſt, ſecond, third</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> lumbar Nerves, a Nerve is formed that runs along the <hi>Pſoas</hi> Muſcle, to eſcape with the external Iliac Veſſels out of the <hi>Abdomen,</hi> below the tendinous Arcade of the external oblique Muſcle. This Nerve, which is named the <hi>ANTERIOR CRURAL,</hi> is diſtributed principally to the Muſcles and Teguments on the anterior Part of the Thigh. A Branch however of this Nerve runs down the Inſide of the Leg to the ſuperior Part of the Foot keeping near to the <hi>Vena, ſaphaena;</hi> in opening of which with a Lancet at the Ancle, the Nerve is ſometimes hurt, and occaſions ſharp Pain at the Time of the Operation, and Numneſs afterwards.</p>
               <p>The Remainder of the fourth Lumbar and the fifth joins in compoſing the largeſt Nerve of the Body, which is ſoon to be deſcribed.</p>
               <p>Whoever attends to the Courſe of theſe lumbar Nerves, and of the ſpermatic Veſſels and Nerves upon the <hi>Pſoas</hi> Muſcle with the oblique Paſſage of the <hi>Ureter</hi> over that Muſcle, will not be ſurprized, that when a Stone is paſſing in this Canal, or even when it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, the Trunk of the Body cannot be raiſed erect without great Pain; or that the Skin of the Thigh becomes more inſenſible, and the Thigh is drawn forward, and that the Teſticle often is drawn convulſively towards the Ring of the abdominal Muſcles.</p>
               <p>The <hi>SIX PAIR</hi> of the <hi>OS SACRUM</hi> conſiſt each of ſmall poſterior Branches ſent
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1074401200:72"/>to the Hips, and of large anterior Branches.</p>
               <p>The <hi>firſt, ſecond</hi> and <hi>third,</hi> after coming through the three ſuperior Holes of the <hi>Os ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crum,</hi> join together and with the fourth and fifth of the Loins, to form the largeſt Nerve by much of the Body, which is well known by the Name of <hi>SCIATIC</hi> or <hi>ISCHIATIC</hi> Nerve: This, after ſending large Nerves to the different Parts of the <hi>Pelvis,</hi> and to the external Parts of Generation and the <hi>Podex,</hi> as alſo to the Muſcles of the Hips, paſſes behind the great <hi>Tuber</hi> of the <hi>Os Iſchium,</hi> and then o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the <hi>Quadrigemini</hi> Muſcles to run down near to the Bone of the Thigh at its poſterior Part, giving off Nerves to the neighbouring Muſcles and Teguments. Some Way above the Ham, where it has the Name of the <hi>Popli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taeus</hi> Nerve, it ſends off a large Branch that paſſes over the <hi>Fibula,</hi> and ſinking in among the Muſcles on the anterior external Part of the Leg, runs down to the Foot, to be loſt in the ſuperior Part of the larger Toes, ſupplying the neighbouring Muſcles and Teguments e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where in its Paſſage. The larger Branch of the <hi>Sciatic,</hi> after giving Branches to the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcles and Teguments about the Ham and Knee, and ſending a large cutaneous Nerve down the Calf of the Leg, to be loſt at laſt in the exteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Side of the Foot and ſuperior Part of the leſſer Toes, ſinks below the <hi>Gemellus</hi> Muſcle, and diſtributes Nerves to the Muſcles on the Back of the Leg; among which it continues its Courſe, till paſſing behind the internal <hi>Mal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leolus</hi> and in the internal Hollow of the <hi>Os Calcis,</hi> it divides into the two plantar Nerves. The internal of which is diſtributed to the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1074401200:73"/>Toes, in the ſame Manner as the radial Nerve of the Hand ſerves the concave Side of the Thumb and Fingers, and the external Plantar is divided and diſtributed to the Sole of the Foot and Toes, nearly as the ulnar Nerve is in the Palm of the Hand and in the concave Part of the Fingers.</p>
               <p>By applying what was ſaid of the Nerves in general to the particular Diſtribution of the Nerves of the inferior Extremities, we may ſee how People with fractured Legs, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly where there are Splinters, ſhould be ſo ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to convulſive Startings of the fractured Member, and why upon tying the Blood-veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels in an Amputation of the Leg, the Patients ſhould ſometimes complain of violent Pain in their Toes; why ſuch Patients ſhould alſo be troubled with Startings, or why, for a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Time after the Amputation of the diſeaſed Limb, when the Suppuration is well advanced, they ſhould complain of Pain in the Sore which occaſioned the Amputation.</p>
               <p>The <hi>FOURTH</hi> Nerve of the <hi>Os ſacrum,</hi> which with the two following is much ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler than the three ſuperior, ſoon is loſt in the <hi>Veſica urinaria</hi> and <hi>Inteſtinum rectum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>FIFTH</hi> comes forward between the Extremity of the <hi>Os ſacrum</hi> and <hi>Coccygis,</hi> to be diſtributed principally to the <hi>Levatores Ani.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>SIXTH</hi> advances forward below the broad Shoulders of the firſt Bone of the <hi>Os Coc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cygis,</hi> and is loſt in the <hi>Sphincter Ani</hi> and Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments covering it.</p>
               <p>The Branches of the four laſt cervical Nerves, and of the firſt dorſal, which are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on the ſuperior Extremity, and the two
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1074401200:74"/>Crurals, with the Sciatic, which are diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the inferior Extremities, are much larger proportionally to the Parts they ſerve, than the Nerves of the Trunk of the Body, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of the <hi>Viſcera</hi> are; and for a very good Reaſon, that in the moſt common neceſſary Actions of Life a ſufficient Quantity of Fluid, on which the Influence of Nerves ſeems to depend, may be ſupplied to the Muſcles there, which are obliged to perform ſo frequent and violent Contractions. The Size of the Nerves of the inferior Extremities ſeems larger pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionally than in the ſuperior Extremities; the inferior Extremities having the Weight of the whole Body to ſuſtain, and that frequently at a great Diſadvantage. What the Effect is of the Nerves here being leſed, we ſee daily, when People happen by ſitting wrong to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs the ſciatic Nerve, they are incapable for ſome time after to ſupport themſelves on the affected Extremity; and this is ſtill more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makeable in the <hi>Sciatic</hi> or <hi>Hip-Gout,</hi> in which the Member is not only weakned, but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually ſhrivels and waſtes.</p>

            <head>THE <hi>Syſtole</hi> and <hi>Diaſtole</hi> OF THE HEART, And the Reciprocal Actions of its AURICLES and VENTRICLES ACCOUNTED FOR.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HAT the Account I am to give of the alternate Motions of the Heart may be rightly underſtood, it will be neceſſary to mention the few following Propoſitions on which it depends.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All Muſcles are furniſhed with Blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſſels and Nerves, and their Action depends on the Influx of Blood, and of the nervous Fluid into their muſcular Fibres; therefore whenever Muſcles are deprived of a ſufficient Quantity of either one or other of theſe Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:1074401200:76"/>or of both, their Action is weakned or ceaſes. The Truth of this has been fully proved by the Experiments of compreſſing, tying and cutting the Nerves or Arteries of Muſcles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All Muſcles are in a conſtant State of Action as long as Blood and nervous Fluid are freely ſupplied to them. This ſeems e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident from the continued Contraction of the Sphincters of the Bladder and <hi>Anus</hi> and of Muſcles, whoſe Antagoniſts are cut aſunder or become paralytic.</p>
            <p>Tho' in theſe two Propoſitions, I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed a Fluid of the Nerves, for the Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of which, ſee the Arguments in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Treatiſe, yet to avoid a Diſpute, it may be here remarked, that the following Account of the Heart's Motions, will equally hold good, by ſuppoſing the Nerves to be ſolid Cords acting by Elaſticity, Vibration, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> if it is only granted, that their Action is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Contraction of Muſcles, and that Compreſſion is capable to hinder that Action, which Experiments plainly ſhew it is.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Nerves of the Heart paſs to it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two Auricles or two Arteries, and between the Auricles and Arteries.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>Coronary</hi> Arteries, which are the only ones that ſupply the Heart, riſe from the <hi>Aorta</hi> immediately above the middle looſe Part of the ſemilunar Valves, in the ſame Height of the <hi>Aorta</hi> as where the Angles of theſe Valves are fixed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Edges of the ſemilunar Valves are duplicated with a muſcular Corpuſcle in the Middle, and muſcular Cords running oblique<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:1074401200:77"/>from that Corpuſcle to the Inſertion of the Valves into the <hi>Aorta.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe three laſt Propoſitions are evidently made appear to be true by Diſſections.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Before the Veſſels in which the Circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is performed can act, it is neceſſary to ſuppoſe them full of their Liquors, otherwiſe the whole Vaſcular Syſtem could not be all at once put into Action, and the Motion of the Fluids ſent out from the Heart, could not be propagated to that in the returning Veſſels; conſequently the Circulation would be ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped almoſt as ſoon as begun.</p>
            <p>If then both Auricles and Ventricles at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, upon the firſt Communication of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to contract; the Ventricles being ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er will force their own Contraction, and hinder the Contraction of the Auricles, which muſt be in the mean time much dilated by the Influx of Blood from the Veins (Prop. 6.) and at this Time, the Arteries are alſo diſtended by the Blood thrown out of the Ventricles; therefore the Cardiac Nerves lying between them, (Prop. 3.) will be compreſſed and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented from exerting their Office. While this happens to the Nerves, the Blood ruſhing out of the left Ventricle into the <hi>Aorta,</hi> and thruſting the ſemilunar Valves outwards and upwards, diſtends the great Artery conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, whereby the Valves are ſtretched, and their lunated Edges are brought to be ſtraight and as high as their Angles; conſequently theſe Edges, thus raiſed and preſſed to the Sides of the <hi>Aorta,</hi> are made to cover the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the <hi>Arteriae coronariae,</hi> which the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles will aſſiſt to do more adequately; and
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:1074401200:78"/>therefore, while they are in this Situation, no Blood can be ſent to the Subſtance of the Heart. If then the Nerves do not exert their Office, and Acceſs is denied to the Blood, This Muſcle, the Heart muſt (by Prop. 1.) become paralytic or unactive.</p>
            <p>The Auricles, which were attempting all this Time to contract themſelves, will now, when the Reſiſtance to them is removed, throw the Blood they contain into the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles; and the Arteries that were violently diſtended while the Ventricles puſhed the Blood into them, will at this ſame Time when the Ventricles ceaſe to act, conſtrict themſelves; and the <hi>Valvulae ſemilunares</hi> will, by their Elaſticity aſſiſted by the muſcular Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puſcles and Cords, be depreſſed inwards. Since then, by the Conſtriction of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricles and Arteries, the Nerves of the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricles are freed from the Compreſſion they ſuffered while the Auricles and Arteries were diſtended; and ſince the Blood in the <hi>Aorta</hi> preſſed ſtrongly by the contracting Sides of this Artery, and reſiſted, by the Liquors which are to be thrown through all its Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, is alſo puſhed with great Force on the Orifice of the left Ventricle, thruſts back the ſemilunar Valves which ſtop its Entry into that Cavity, and impetuouſly ruſhes into the coronary Arteries: Since then, I ſay, the Nerves of the Heart are again free from Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and the Blood is again ſent to the Heart by its Arteries, its muſcular Fibres muſt again contract (by Prop. 2.) And thus, as long as theſe Cauſes continue to act and ceaſe alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately, their Effects muſt be exerted in the ſame
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:1074401200:79"/>Manner; that is, as long as an Animal lives, the Heart muſt have an alternate State of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction called its <hi>Syſtole,</hi> and of Relaxation or <hi>Diaſtole;</hi> and the Auricles and Arteries muſt be dilated, while the Ventricles are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting, and the Ventricles muſt be dilated while the Auricles and Arteries are conſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, or their Actions muſt always be recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal.</p>

This Lymphatic appears, by blowing Air and injecting Liquors into it, to have no Valves; when the two Branches are again united, the Duct continues its Courſe towards the internal Jugular Vein, behind which it deſcends, and immediately at the left Side of the Inſertion of this Vein enters the ſuperior poſterior Part of the left ſubcla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian Vein, whoſe internal Membrane dupli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated forms a ſemilunar Valve that is convex externally, and covers two Thirds of the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of the Duct; immediately below this Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice

               </gap>es; from the In-ſide of which, in the Duct, ſmall ſemilunar Valves are produced, moſt commonly in Pairs; which are ſo ſituated, as to allow the Paſſage of Liquors upwards, but oppoſe their Return in an oppoſite Courſe. The Number of theſe is generally ten or twelve.</p>
            <p>This is the moſt ſimple and common Courſe, Situation and Structure of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptaculum chyli</hi> and <hi>thoracic Duct;</hi> but ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving had Occaſion to obſerve a Variety in theſe Parts of different Subjects, I ſhall ſet down the moſt remarkable of them.</p>
            <p>The Sac is ſometimes ſituated lower down than in the former Deſcription, is not always of the ſame Dimenſions, is not compoſed of the ſame Number of Ducts, and frequently appears divided into ſeveral ſmall Cells, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being one ſimple Cavity.</p>
            <p>The Diameter of the Duct is various in moſt Bodies, and is ſeldom uniform in the ſame Subject; but frequently ſudden Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or <hi>Sacculi</hi> of it are obſervable. The Diviſions which Authors mention of this Duct are very uncertain. I have ſeen it divided, and one Branch climb over the anterior Part of the <hi>Aorta</hi> at the eighth <hi>Vertebra</hi> of the <hi>Thorax,</hi> and at the fifth ſlip behind that Artery, to join the other Branch which continued in the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Courſe. The preciſe <hi>Vertebra,</hi> where it begins to turn to the left Side, is alſo uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. Frequently it does not ſplit at its ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Arch; in which Caſe a large Sac is found
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:1074401200:83"/>near its Aperture into the ſubclavian Vein. Generally it has but one Orifice; tho' I have ſeen two in one Body, and three in another: Nay ſometimes it divides into two, under the Curvature of the great Artery; one goes to the right, another to the left ſubclavian Vein; and I have found this Duct diſcharging it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf entirely into the right ſubclavian. The lymphatic Veſſel which enters its ſuperior Arch is often ſent from the <hi>thyroid</hi> Gland.</p>
            <p>Whether is not the Situation of the <hi>Recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taculum chyli</hi> ſo much nearer the muſcular <hi>Appendices</hi> of the Diaphragm in Men than Brutes, deſigned to ſupply the diſadvantageous Courſe the Chyle muſt otherwiſe have in our erect Poſture?</p>
            <p>Does not the Deſcent of the Extremity of the Duct to the ſubclavian Vein, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening of the lymphatic into the Top of the Arch, contribute to the ready Admiſſion of the Chyle into that V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="3 letters">
