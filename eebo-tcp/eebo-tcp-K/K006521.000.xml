            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>EVER ſince my firſt Pulication, the Curioſity, not to ſay Anxiety, of the World concerning my Name, has been ſo great, that it has frequently given me Pain to conceal what the World will now ſee it was not poſſibly in my Power to diſcover.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, I had no Name, till the Royal Favour lately reſtored my very antient and honourable Clan to its priſtine Title and Honours. I was therefore in the ſame deplorable Caſe with a certain nameleſs Lady, whom I have long had the Honour to call my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and who, I ſincerely hope, will ſoon, by the ſame Favour, be reſtored to that Title, which, upon my Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, I believe, ſhe has erroneouſly, and not inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally forfeited.</p>
            <p>I have only to add, that now, when the Public is in poſſeſſion of my real Name, it will not, I hope, ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer any national Prejudice to prevent it from receiving

this my firſt Lyrical Attempt with its former Candour. But I muſt needs ſay, that if this Ode does not ſell as well as Mr. CUMBERLAND'S, I ſhall be apt to impute it, not to any inferiority of Lyrical Ordonance, but merely to its having been written by a Scotchman.</p>

                     <p>This great Philoſopher has lately diſcovered a Method of fabricating a new Species of Air, of ſo infinitely ſuperior ſalubrity and duration to that vulgar atmoſpherical Air, which for want of better we have been obliged to breathe for upwards of five thouſand Years, that it is to be ſuppoſed that no Macaroni, Savoir Vivre, or in plain Engliſh, no body that knows what's what, will in future condeſcend to reſpire any Air, that is not ſealed with the Doctor's own Arms, and ſigned with his own Hand-writing. It is to be feared, however, that his Pneumatic Vials will be liable to be counterfeited, as our Philoſopher has not Intereſt enough at Court to procure a Patent. Indeed were ſuch a Patent granted, it might ſuperſede Mr. PINCHBECK's; becauſe that in this Air a Candle is found to burn with ſo bright and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued a Flame, that it could never want ſnuffing.</p>
