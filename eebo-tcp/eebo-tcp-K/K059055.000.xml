            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>"LET them ask him, whether he
can conceive Velocity without
Motion, or Motion without Extenſion,
or Extenſion without Magnitude? If
he anſwers that he can, let him teach
them to do the ſame. If he cannot,
let him be asked, how he reconciles
the Idea of a Fluxion which he gives
(P. 13.) with common Senſe? Again,
let him be asked, whether nothing be
not the Product of nothing multiply'd
by ſomething? And if ſo, when the
Difference between the Gnomon and
the Sum of the Rectangles vaniſheth,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0278300400:5"/>
whether the Rectangles themſelves do
not alſo vaniſh? that is, when <hi>ab</hi> is
nothing, whether A<hi>b</hi> + B<hi>a</hi> be not alſo
nothing? that is, whether the Momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum
of AB be not nothing? Let him
then be asked, what his Momentums
are good for, when they are thus brought
to nothing? Again, I wiſh he were
asked to explain the Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
a Magnitude infinitely ſmall and
a Magnitude infinitely diminiſh'd? If
he faith there is no Difference, then
let him be asked, how he DARES to
explain the Method of Fluxions by the
<hi>Ratio</hi> of Magnitudes infinitely dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
(P.9.) when Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>
hath expreſly excluded all Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of Quantities infinitely ſmall? If
this able Vindicator ſhould ſay that
Quantities infinitely diminiſh'd are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
at all, and conſequently that,
according to him, the firſt and laſt
<hi>Ratios</hi> are Proportions between no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things,
let him be deſired to make
Senſe of this or explain what he means
by '<hi>Proportion between nothings.</hi> If
he ſhould ſay the ultimate Proportions
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0278300400:6"/>
are the Ratios of mere Limits, then
let him be asked how the Limits of
Lines can be proportioned or divided?
After all, who knows but this Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who hath already complained of
me for an uncommon Way of treating
Mathematics and Mathematicians, may
(as well as the <hi>Cantabrigian</hi>) cry out
<hi>Spain</hi> and the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> when he
finds himſelf thus cloſely purſued and
beſet with Interrogatories? That we
may not therefore ſeem too hard on an
innocent Man, who probably meant
nothing, but was betray'd by following
another into Difficulties and Straits that
he was not aware of, I ſhall propoſe
one ſingle Expedient, by which his
Diſciples (whom it moſt concerns) may
ſoon ſatisfy themſelves, whether this
Vindicator really underſtands what he
takes upon him to vindicate. It is in
ſhort, that they would ask him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
the ſecond, third or fourth Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
upon his Principles. Be this the
Touchſtone of his Vindication. If he
can do it, I ſhall own my ſelf much
miſtaken: If he cannot, it will be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0278300400:7"/>
that he was much miſtaken in
himſelf, when he preſumed to defend
Fluxions without ſo much as knowing
what they are. So having put the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of the Cauſe on this Iſſue, I leave
him to be tried by his Scholars."</p>
               <p n="3">III. In this CATECHISM I am firſt
to be: asked, "Whether I can conceive
Velocity without Motion, or Motion
without Extenſion, or Extenſion with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Magnitude?" Theſe Queſtions are
more clearly expreſs'd in the 29th and
30th Queries of his <hi>Analyſt,</hi> where he asks,
"Whether we can form an Idea or Notion
of Velocity diſtinct from and excluſive
of its Meaſures? Whether Motion can
be conceived in a Point of Space? And
if Motion cannot, whether Velocity
can? And if not, whether a firſt or laſt
Velocity can be conceived in a mere Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit,
either initial or final, of the deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
Space?" I anſwer, I can conceive
Velocity and Motion in a <hi>Point of Space</hi>;
that is without any aſſignable Length or
Extenſion deſcribed by it, and ſo might
he too if he had underſtood and conſider'd
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0278300400:8"/>
the Nature of Motion. For Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
is an Effect of ſome Cauſe acting on
the Thing moved; which Effect ſetting
aſide all Reſiſtance, will ever be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
to the whole Action of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating
Cauſe: And therefore if a Cauſe
acts continually upon a given Thing with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
any Interruption, there muſt be a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual
Increaſe of its Velocity. The Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
cannot be the ſame in any two
different Points of the Space deſcribed,
however near thoſe Points may be to
each other. For if it was, there muſt: be
a Ceſſation of the Action of the moving
Cauſe during the Paſſage of the Thing
thro' the Space comprehended between
the two Points; which is contrary to
the Suppoſition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:0278300400:9"/>
If the Thing moved be a Point, and
the Space deſcribed by this Point ſetting
out from a State of Reſt at A, be AD;
<figure/>
and if the Point be acted upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
by a moving Cauſe during
the Time of its going from A to D,
and the Cauſe act continually with
the ſame Degree of Strength during
that Time; the Velocity will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
increaſe with the Time of
the Motion, or with the Square
Root of the Space deſcribed; that
is, the Velocities in the Points C
and D, will be in the ſame Proportion
as the Times of deſcribing AC and AD,
or as the Square Roots of AC and AD.
Theſe are the Laws of Motion obſerved
by Bodies falling from ſmall Heights to
the Surface of the Earth, ſetting aſide
the Reſiſtance of the Air, and ſuppoſing
the Bodies to have exactly the ſame
Weights during the Times of their Fall.</p>
               <p>If the Cauſe acts continually upon the
moving Point, but with different Degrees
of Strength during the Time of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
the Velocity will not increaſe with
the Time, nor with the Square Root of the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0278300400:10"/>
Space deſcribed; but will ſtill increaſe
from the Beginning to the End of the
Motion, and not be the ſame in any two
different Points of the Space deſcribed,
however near to each other. Let the
Velocity increaſe with the <hi>n</hi> Power of
the Time, that is, let V be as T<hi rend="sup">
                     <hi>n</hi>
                  </hi>; and
then V will be as <gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or as
<gap reason="math">
                     <desc>〈 math 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, putting S for the Space deſcrib'd:
Whence it appears that the Velocity will
not be the ſame in any two different
Points of the Space deſcribed: For it muſt
vary upon the leaſt Change of the Space
S, and conſequently be different in every
different Point of AD; which ſhews that
this Author has been greatly miſtaken in
imagining that there can be no Motion,
no Velocity, in a Point of Space.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The next Queſtions in the CA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TECHISM,
depending upon each other,
run thus. "Let him be asked, whether
nothing be not the Product of nothing
multiply'd by ſomething? And if ſo,
when the Difference between the Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0278300400:11"/>
and Sum of the two Rectangles
vaniſheth, whether the Rectangles
themſelves do not alſo vaniſh? that is
when <hi>a b</hi> is nothing, whether A<hi>b</hi> + B<hi>a</hi>
be not alſo nothing? that is, whether
the Momentum of AB be not nothing?
And let him be asked what his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentums
are good for when thus they
are reduced to nothing?" As to the
firſt of theſe Queſtions I agree with him
that nothing is the Product of nothing
multiply'd by ſomething; but muſt know
what he means by the vaniſhing of
the Gnomon and Sum of the two
Rectangles in the ſecond, before I give
him a direct Anſwer. If by vaniſhing he
means that they vaniſh and become no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
as Areas, I grant they do; but ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
deny, upon ſuch an Evaneſcence
of the Gnomon and Sum of the two Rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angles
by the moving back of the Sides
of the Gnomon till they come to coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide
with thoſe of the Rectangle, that
nothing remains. For there ſtill remain
the moving Sides, which are now become
the Sides of the Rectangle; into which
Sides both the Gnomon and the Sum of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0278300400:12"/>
the two Rectangles are now turned by
this retroverted Motion. And as the Gno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
and Sum of the two Rectangles, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
the Evaneſcence of their Areas by
this retroverted Motion, are both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted
into the two Sides of the Rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
AB, ſo in the Inſtant of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion,
their Motions are exactly the
ſame; or the Motion of the Gnomon is
the ſame with the Sum of the Motions of
the two Rectangles, when they evaneſce,
and are converted into the two Sides of
the Rectangle AB.</p>
               <p>If a Point moves forward to generate
a Line, and afterwards the ſame Point
moves back again to deſtroy the Line
with the very ſame Degrees of Velocity,
in all Parts of the Line which it had in
thoſe Parts when moving forward to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate
it; in the Inſtant the Line vaniſhes
as a Length, nothing of a Line will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
but ſtill the generating Point will
remain, together with the Velocity it had
at the very Beginning of its Motion. And
the Caſe is the very ſame with reſpect to
a Rectangle increaſing by the Motion of
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0278300400:13"/>
its Sides: For upon the Evaneſcence of
a generated Gnomon, there ſtill remain
the Sides of the Rectangle into which the
Gnomon by its Evaneſcence is converted,
together with the Velocities of thoſe
Sides that is, when the Gnomon eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſces
there ſtill remains A<hi>b</hi> + B<hi>a.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To make this more evident to Senſe;
let the Point which generated the Line
AD, <figure/> move back again from D to C with the very ſame Degrees of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
in every Part of the Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
CD which it had in that part
in moving forward from C to D;
and when the Increment CD eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſces
and becomes nothing as a Line
by being converted into the moving
Point in C; there will remain that
that Point together with its Motion in C;
for neither the Point nor its Motion in
C is deſtroy'd by the Evaneſcence of the
Line CD.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0278300400:14"/>
If the Rectangle CDK be generated
by the Motions of two indefinite right
Lines IB and IA, of IB down IA and
of IA along IB, and from a Continuance
of the Motions of theſe Lines, be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
by the Gnomon CGK; and if
<figure/>
the generating Lines return from L and E
to K and C, with the very ſame Degrees
of Velocity in the ſeveral Points of LK
and EC which they had in thoſe Points
in moving from K and C to L and E; it
is evident, when the Gnomon CGK or
the Increment of the Rectangle CDK
evaneſces and becomes nothing as an Area,
by being converted into the Sides DK
and DC; that there will remain thoſe
Sides and their Velocities in D; neither
the Sides nor the Velocities of thoſe
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0278300400:15"/>
Sides being deſtroy'd by the Evaneſcence
of the Area of the Gnomon. But per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps
he will ſay, that when the Gnomon
evaneſces it turns into ſomething more
than the Sum of the Sides DK and DC:
For the Rectangles LD and FC turn into
thoſe Sides, and the Rectangle FH turns
into a Point at D; and therefore the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of the Gnomon in the Inſtant it eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſces,
will become the Sum of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the Sides DK and DC, and of
the Point in D; that is, putting A and
B for DK and DC, and <hi>a</hi> and <hi>b</hi> for the
Velocities in D towards F and H, and <hi>p</hi>
for a Point; it will be equal to A<hi>b</hi> + B<hi>a</hi>
+ <hi>ap</hi> + <hi>bp</hi>: Let it be ſo, and yet <hi>a</hi>+<hi>b</hi> × <hi>p</hi>
will be nothing when compared with A<hi>b</hi>
+ B<hi>a,</hi> nor make the leaſt Augmentation
to that Sum when added to it. For let
<hi>a</hi> be to <hi>b</hi> as 3 to 2, and A<hi>b</hi> + B<hi>a</hi> + <hi>ap</hi>
+ <hi>bp</hi> will be 2A + 3B + 5<hi>p</hi>: But 5<hi>p</hi> or
five Points added to a Line, make no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but the Line itſelf; a Point being
no Part of a Line; and conſequently not
in the leaſt increaſing its Length when
added to it: And therefore the Motion
of the Gnomon when it evaneſces and
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0278300400:16"/>
turns into the Sides of the Rectangle
CDK, will be A<hi>b</hi> + B<hi>a,</hi> as Sir <hi>Iſaac
Newton</hi> makes it.</p>
               <p>If the Curvilineal Area ABD be gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
by the Motion of any indefinite
Line AH down AG, While a Point ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
out from A moves in the Line AH
from A towards H; and if from a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance
of theſe two Motions that Area
be increaſed by the Augment BDFE,
<figure/>
conſiſting of the Rectangle BC and of
the Triangle CFD; the Motion with
which the Increment BDFE begins to
be generated, is the Sum of the two Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
towards C and H in the Point D;
which Sum, putting <hi>b</hi> for the Velocity
towards C, <hi>a</hi> for the Velocity towards H
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0278300400:17"/>
and <hi>p</hi> for a Point, will be BD×<hi>b</hi> + <hi>ap.</hi>
Now ſuppoſe the Ordinate EF to move
back to BD, and the Point F to move back
in the Line HE to C, and that in moving
back they have the ſame Degrees of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locity
in every Point of EB and EH,
which they had before in moving for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward;
it is manifeſt, that when the Aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
BDFE vaniſhes and becomes no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
as an Area, by being converted into
the Ordinate BD, and into a Point at the
Extremity of that Ordinate; there will
remain BD and the Point in D, together
with their Velocities in that Point; for
the Motions of that Line and Point, are
not deſtroy'd by the Evaneſcence of the
Area BDFE, In the Inſtant EF coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides
with BD, and the Point F with D,
the Area BDFE will be converted into
BD + <hi>p,</hi> and its Motion will become BD ×
<hi>b</hi> + <hi>pa,</hi> as before. But <hi>pa,</hi> being only ſo
many Points as <hi>a</hi> contains Units, is real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
and truly nothing with reſpect to
BD × <hi>b</hi>; and conſequently does not at all
increaſe it when added to it. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the <hi>Fluxion</hi> of the curvilineal Area
ABD, will be BD × <hi>b</hi>; or as BD if <hi>b</hi>
                  <pb n="18" facs="tcp:0278300400:18"/>
be given, or the Line AH move down
AG with a Velocity which is exactly
the ſame in every Part of GA.</p>
               <p>Hence it appears, that if mathematical
Quantities be increaſed in equal Times
by Motion, their iſochronal Increments
muſt be made to vaniſh by a Retroverſion
of the Motion, before we can obtain the
Motions with which they vaniſh, or begin
to be generated; that is, before we can
obtain the <hi>Fluxions</hi> of the Quantities,
the Name given by Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>
to thoſe Motions. So then, this Author
has been much out in ſuppoſing that upon
the Evaneſcence of the Gnomon CGK,
or of the curvilineal Figure BDFE, the
Momentum or <hi>Fluxion</hi> of the Rectangle
CDK, or of the Area ABD, vaniſhes.
Conſequently, he has been greatly miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken
in every one of theſe Queſtions.</p>
               <p n="5">V. But he goes on. "I wiſh he were
asked to explain the Difference between
a Magnitude infinitely ſmall and a Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude
infinitely diminiſhed. If he
ſaith there is no Difference: Then let
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0278300400:19"/>
him, be further asked, how he DARES
to explain the Method of Fluxions by
the <hi>Ratio</hi> of Magnitudes infinitely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh'd,
when Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> hath
expreſly excluded all Conſideration of
Quantities infinitely ſmall? If this able
Vindicator ſhou'd ſay that Quantities
infinitely diminiſh'd are nothing at all,
and conſequently that, according to
him, the firſt and laſt <hi>Ratios</hi> are Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portions
between nothings, let him be
deſired to make Senſe of this, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
what he means by <hi>Proportion
between nothings.</hi> If he ſhou'd ſay
the ultimate Proportions are the <hi>Ratios</hi>
of mere Limits, then let him be asked
how the Limits of Lines can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portioned
or divided?"</p>
               <p>As all this Part of the CATECHISM
relates to the Meaſures of Fluxions by
the firſt and laſt <hi>Ratios</hi> of iſochronal
Increments generated and deſtroy'd by
Motion, ſo I have taken it together, and
ſhall anſwer the whole in one Section.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0278300400:20"/>
Neither Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> nor I have
ſaid, that <hi>Fluxions</hi> are meaſured by the
Proportions of Magnitudes infinitely
ſmall, nor by the Proportions of any
Magnitudes whatever generated in equal
Times; but that <hi>they are meaſured by
the firſt or laſt Proportions of iſochro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal
Increments generated or deſtroy'd
by Motion</hi>; which Proportions are the
<hi>Ratios</hi> with which ſuch Increments be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
to exiſt before they have acquired
any Magnitude, or with which they
ceaſe to exiſt and vaniſh after they have
loſt all Magnitude. Theſe <hi>Ratios</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
when the iſochronal Increments have
no Magnitude, for as much as the Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
ſubſiſt with which thoſe Increments,
<hi>juſt now, in this very Inſtant,</hi> begin
or ceaſe to exiſt; to which Motions
theſe <hi>Ratios</hi> are proportional.</p>
               <p>For Example, the firſt or laſt <hi>Ratio</hi> of the
Increments CD and EF generated in equal
Times, has a real Exiſtence; for as much
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0278300400:21"/>
as it is equal to the <hi>Ratio</hi> of the Motions
in C and E, <figure/> 
which are the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
ſubſiſting in thoſe Points
when the iſchronal Increments
<hi>juſt</hi> begin or ceaſe to exiſt.
The Exiſtence of the Motions
preſerves the Exiſtence of <hi>theſe
Ratios</hi> of the Increments CD
and EF. If the <hi>Ratio</hi> of the
Motions in C and E, be that of
4 to 3; the firſt or laſt <hi>Ratio</hi> of
the iſochronal Increments CD
and EF, will likewiſe be that of
4 to 3, even tho' no Part of thoſe Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
has any Exiſtence.</p>
               <p>The Motions in C and E, are as the
moving Quantities and Velocities taken
together; or as two Points and their Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>locities,
taken together; or as the Veloci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
all Points being equal. And the firſt
or laſt <hi>Ratio</hi> of the iſochronal Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
CD and EF, is compounded of
the firſt or laſt <hi>Ratio</hi> of theſe Spaces,
and of the <hi>Ratio</hi> of the moving Quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
For the Velocities in C and E be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
in the firſt or laſt <hi>Ratios</hi> of theſe
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0278300400:22"/>
iſochronal Spaces, the Motions, which are
as the moving Quantities and Velocities
taken together, will be as the ſame
moving Quantities and the firſt or
laſt <hi>Ratio</hi> of the iſochronal Spaces
taken together. If Q and <hi>q</hi> denote the
moving Quantities in C and E, V and <hi>v</hi>
their Velocities, S and <hi>s</hi> the iſochronal
Spaces CD and EF, and Ṡ and <hi>ṡ</hi> the firſt
or laſt <hi>Ratio</hi> of thoſe iſochronal Spaces;
then QV will be to <hi>qv,</hi> as QṠ to <hi>qṡ</hi>;
and in this caſe V will be to <hi>v,</hi> as Ṡ to <hi>ṡ,</hi>
becauſe Q and <hi>q</hi> are equal.</p>
               <p>Again, the firſt or laſt <hi>Ratio</hi> of the
iſochronal Spaces FD and DH in the
augmented Rectangle EGL (See the <hi>Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure</hi>
in <hi>Page</hi> 14.) has a real Exiſtence;
for as much as it is equal to the <hi>Ratio</hi> of
the two Motions of two Points in D, of
one towards F, and the other towards H;
which Motions, ſubſiſting when the iſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chronal
Spaces FD and DH are nothing,
preſerve the Exiſtence of the firſt or laſt
<hi>Ratio</hi> of theſe Spaces, or keep it from
being a <hi>Ratio of nothings.</hi> If V and <hi>v,</hi>
denote the Velocities in D towards F
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0278300400:23"/>
and H, Q and <hi>q</hi> the Sides of the Rect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angle
DK and DC, and Ṡ and <hi>ṡ</hi> the firſt
or laſt <hi>Ratio</hi> of the iſochronal Spaces
FD and DH; then Q <hi>v</hi> will be to <hi>q</hi>V,
as Q<hi>ṡ</hi> to <hi>q</hi>Ṡ; but Q<hi>v</hi> + <hi>q</hi>V is the Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
or Motion of the Rectangle CDK,
as I have ſhewn before; and therefore the
Moment or Meaſure of the Fluxion of the
Rectangle will be Q<hi>ṡ</hi> + <hi>q</hi>Ṡ. This is
a full and clear Anſwer to this Part of
the CATECHISM, and ſhews that its
Author has been greatly miſtaken in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that I explained the Doctrine of
Fluxions by the <hi>Ratio of Magnitudes
infinitely deminiſh'd,</hi> or by <hi>Proportions
between nothings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">VI. I come now to the laſt Part of
the CATECHISM, which ſtands thus.
"I ſhall propoſe one ſingle Expedient,
by which his Diſciples (whom it moſt
concerns) may ſoon ſatisfy themſelves,
whether this Vindicator really under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands
what he takes upon him to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate.
It is in ſhort, that they wou'd ask
him to explain the ſecond, third, or fourth
Fluxions upon his Principles. Be this
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0278300400:24"/>
the Touchſtone of his Vindication:
If he can do it, I ſhall own my ſelf
much miſtaken: If he cannot it will
be evident that he was much miſtaken
in himſelf, when he <hi>preſumed</hi> to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſend
Fluxions without ſo much as
knowing what they are. So having
put the Merits of the Cauſe on this
Iſſue, I leave him to be tried by his
Scholars."</p>
               <p>I do not wonder that this Author ſhou'd
have no clear Ideas or Conceptions of
ſecond, third or fourth Fluxions, when
he has no clear Conceptions of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
Principles of Motion, nor of the firſt
and laſt <hi>Ratios</hi> of the iſochronal Increments
of Quantities generated and deſtroy'd
by Motion. For Fluxions, according to Sir
<hi>Iſaac Newton,</hi> are the <hi>Motions</hi> with which
the iſochronal Increments of Quantities be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
or ceaſe to exiſt, or the Motions of the
generating Quantities in the very Limits
or Extremities of the <hi>Fluents</hi>: Thus
the Fluxions of Solids are the Motions of
Surfaces; the Fluxions of Surfaces, the
Motions of Lines; the Fluxions of Lines,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0278300400:25"/>
the Motions of Points; and the Fluxions
of Points are nothing, for Points in their
own Nature are invariable, and therefore
incapable of being generated or increaſed
by Motion: And if the firſt Fluxions of
Quantities be Motions, it follows, that
the Mutations of theſe Motions and the
Mutations of thoſe Mutations, which
are the ſecond and third Fluxions of the
Quantities, muſt likewiſe be Motions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, ſecond and third Fluxions do real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
exiſt, and may be clearly and diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
conceiv'd by attending to the Motions
of the ſeveral Parts of a Cube, namely,
of its Surfaces of their Lines and Points,
in the Inſtant it begins to be increas'd by
Motion. For if A denotes the Side of a Cube
generated by an uniform Motion, whoſe
Velocity is expreſs'd by <hi>a</hi>; the firſt Fluxion
of the Cube, according to theſe Principles,
will be expreſſed by 3<hi>a</hi>A<hi rend="sup">2</hi>; its ſecond
Fluxion, which is the Fluxion of 3<hi>a</hi>A<hi rend="sup">2</hi>, will
be expreſſed by 6<hi>a2</hi>A, or by 6<hi>a</hi>A × <hi>a</hi>;
its third Fluxion, which is the firſt Fluxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
on of 6<hi>a2</hi>A, will be expreſs'd by 6<hi>a3</hi> or
by 6<hi>a2</hi> × <hi>a</hi>; and its fourth Fluxion will
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0278300400:26"/>
be nothing: But all theſe Fluxions or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
do exiſt, and may be clearly and
diſtinctly conceived in the Motion of a
Cube, at the very End of its Generation,
or at the very Beginning of its Augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,
by Motion; for it begins to be
augmented by the Sum of the Motions
of three of its Squares comprehending
any one of its ſolid Angles, each of which
Squares being denoted by A<hi rend="sup">2</hi> and their
Velocity outward by <hi>a,</hi> the Fluxion of
the Cube or the Motion with which it
begins to increaſe or to be enlarged, will
be 3<hi>a</hi>A<hi rend="sup">2</hi>; and this is the firſt Fluxion
of the Cube; and the three moving
Squares begin to be augmented, in the
very ſame Inſtant wherein the Cube be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins
to enlarge, each by the Sum of the
Motions of its two adjoining Sides, and
conſequently the Motions of thoſe Sides
to augment the cubic Surface, will be
expreſs'd by 6<hi>a</hi>A, but that Surface at
the ſame Inſtant of Time moves outward
to augment the Solid with a Velocity
which is alſo denoted by <hi>a,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
the whole Motion of the fix moving
Sides of the three Squares for increaſing
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0278300400:27"/>
or enlarging the Cube, will be expreſſed
by 6<hi>a</hi>A × <hi>a</hi> or by 6<hi>a2</hi>A; and this is the
ſecond Fluxion of the Cube; and when
the three moving Squares begin thus to
increaſe, ſideways and outwards, for the
Enlargement of the Cube, their ſix mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
Sides begin to be augmented by the
Motion of ſix Points; and the common
Velocity of thoſe Points in order to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe
the Sides of the Squares, being the
ſame with the Velocity of thoſe Sides to
increaſe the Cubic Surface, and with the
Velocity of that Surface to augment the
Solid; the whole Motion with which
thoſe Points begin to enlarge the Cube,
will be expreſs'd by 6<hi>a3</hi> or by 6<hi>a3</hi>
                  <hi>p</hi>; and
this is the third Fluxion of the Cube:
Theſe three Kinds of Motion do all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily
exiſt and may be clearly and
diſtinctly conceived in the Syſtem of
Motion whereby a Cube begins to be
augmented: And therefore the firſt, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond
and third Fluxions of Quantities
may be diſtinctly conceived, and fully ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
upon the Principles of Sir <hi>Iſaac
Newton.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:0278300400:28"/>
As firſt, ſecond and third Fluxions are
explained by the ſeveral Motions neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily
exiſting in the very Inſtant a Cube
begins to be augmented, ſo they may like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
be explain'd and distinctly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended,
by conſidering the naſcent or
evaneſcent Increments of the ſeveral Parts
of a Cube, generated by Motion; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
always that by naſcent or evane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
Increments be underſtood not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated
Increments of any Magnitude what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
but only ſuch Quantities or Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudes
as are proportional to and Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
Meaſures of the Motions with
which thoſe iſochronal Increments begin
or ceaſe to exiſt. For if <hi>a,</hi> which before
denoted Velocity, be now put for the
firſt or laſt Ratio of the Space deſcribed
by that Velocity in a given Time; 3<hi>a</hi>A<hi rend="sup">2</hi>
will denote the naſcent Increment of the
Cube generated by the Motion of three
of its Squares comprehending any one of
its ſolid Angles; and 6<hi>a</hi>A will expreſs the
Sum of the naſcent Increments of the
three moving Squares, which Sum mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply'd
into <hi>a</hi> will be the Increment of
the naſcent Solid 3<hi>a</hi>A<hi rend="sup">2</hi>; conſequently
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0278300400:29"/>
6<hi>a2</hi>A will be the ſecond naſcent Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Cube; and the naſcent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
of 6A<hi>a,</hi> or of ſix Rectangles
each denoted by A<hi>a,</hi> will be 6<hi>a2</hi>, which
multiply'd into <hi>a</hi> gives 6<hi>a3</hi> for the naſcent
Increment of 6<hi>a2</hi>A, and therefore 6<hi>a3</hi> is
the third naſcent Increment of the Cube:
All this may be clearly conceiv'd and
made evident to Senſe by the <hi>Figure</hi>
in <hi>Page</hi> 14. For let CDK repreſent one
of the three moving Squares compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending
any of the ſolid Angles of a
Cube increaſing by Motion, and then
three times CDK multiply'd into <hi>a,</hi> or
3<hi>a</hi>A<hi rend="sup">2</hi>, will expound the firſt naſcent In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crement
of the Cube; and 3FC + 3LD
or 6A<hi>a</hi> (which is the naſcent Increment
of the three moving Squares) multiply'd
into <hi>a,</hi> will be the ſecond naſcent Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of the Cube; and, the Rectangle
FH or <hi>a2</hi> being the naſcent Increment of
the Rectangle FC or LD, and 2FH or
2<hi>a2</hi> the naſcent Increment of FC + LD
or of 2A<hi>a,</hi> and 6<hi>a2</hi> the naſcent Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of 6A<hi>a,</hi> it follows that 6<hi>a2</hi> multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd
into <hi>a,</hi> or that 6<hi>a3</hi>, will be the naſcent
Increment of 6A<hi>a2</hi> and conſequently
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0278300400:30"/>
the third naſcent Increment of the Cube.
And theſe three diſtinct Orders of Incre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
all begin to exiſt together, in the
very Inſtant the Cube begins to be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
by Motion.</p>
               <p>This may ſerve as an Anſwer to the
laſt Part of the CATECHISM, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the Author's <hi>Touchſtone</hi> of my <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication</hi>:
Whether he will <hi>own himſelf
miſtaken</hi> I know not; but I think he
ought after his unjuſt and ſhameful Treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
of Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi>; who in <hi>the
Introduction to his Quadrature of
Curves,</hi> in <hi>the ſecond Lemma of the
ſecond Book, and in the Scholium to the
firſt Section of the firſt Book of his
Principles of Philoſophy,</hi> has deliver'd
his Doctrine of <hi>Fluxions</hi> in ſo clear and
diſtinct a Manner, without the leaſt <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency</hi>
in Terms or Arguments, that
one wou'd have thought it impoſſible for
any Perſon not to have underſtood him,
particularly for this Author, who ſays, <hi>he
had long and maturely conſidered thoſe
Principles, and taken as much pains as</hi>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:0278300400:31"/> 
                  <hi>any Man living to underſtand and make
Senſe of them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have now done with the CATECHISM;
but beg leave before I conclude this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,
in order to prevent my being CATE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CHISED
any more by this Author, to give
the World a ſhort Account of ſome Part
of my Faith in Religion. I believe that
there is one ſupreme, incorporeal, ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>living,
intelligent and omnipreſent Being,
called GOD, who made and governs the
World. I believe that GOD is endued
with infinite Power, Knowledge, Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
and Goodneſs; and that to <hi>deny</hi> or
<hi>limit</hi> any one of theſe Attributes, is in
Effect to <hi>deny</hi> a GOD. I believe, that
to ſay GOD <hi>cannot</hi> create Spirits with a
Power, inherent in themſelves and reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
from their own Frame and Make,
of perceiving and knowing. Things of a
quite different Nature from their own,
by Ideas and Senſations; is in Effect to
<hi>deny</hi> a GOD; for as much as by this
Principle his Almighty Power is denied.
And laſtly, I believe that this Supreme
Being has revealed his Will to Mankind
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0278300400:32"/>
by <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>
and the Apoſtles; and that the Doctrine
by them deliver'd is therefore divine,
and cannot be altered by any Power or
Authority upon Earth, nor even by an
Angel from Heaven, who is pronounced
accurſed ſhou'd he preach any other <hi>Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel</hi>
than what is delivered.</p>
