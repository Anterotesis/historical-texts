            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>1 Chap. 2 Book of Samuel, 24.</bibl>
               <q>Ye Daughters of Iſrael, weep over Saul, who cloathed
you in Scarlet, with other Delights; who put on
ornaments of Gold upon your Apparrel.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>NOW, Gentlemen, you will pardon me a
Digreſſion, when I ſhall remind you that
this is the 4th Day of <hi>November,</hi> the initial Day
of <hi>Euroupe</hi>'s Liberty, the great Dawning of this
Age's Glory; the Day that God has hallow'd or
ſet apart to be praiſed in, for that unvalued Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
of King <hi>William</hi>'s Life. On this Day it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan.
The Thankfulneſs of honeſt Men for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtimable
Gift, ſhall never fail to be revived this
Day, while they have Hearts to own it, or <hi>Britain</hi>
has honeſt Men left to know the Hand that ſaved
them, or to remember whoſe glorius Inſtrument
he was, to aſſault Tyranny, and the moſt trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phant
Enemies of God's Church, and his People's
Liberty.</p>
            <p>May this Day be Sacred to his Memory, <hi>and it</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:0522500700:3"/>
               <hi>will be ſo,</hi> while there are any ſuch thing as honeſt
Men in this Part of the World— The Reflection
upon the leaſt temporal Mercy ye enjoy, <hi>ay and
ſome ſpiritual ones too,</hi> muſt bring back your Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
to <hi>this Day,</hi> and by this Day to the Perſon
by whoſe Name 'tis call'd I know 'tis hard, as a
Reverend Prelate of this Church once took notice,
<hi>for Engliſh Men to remember Twenty long Years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind
them, eſpecially ſo diſpiſed a thing as a Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fector</hi>
But an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man cannot look round him
a Day in his Life, but he is as neceſſarily brought
to a Remembrance of King <hi>William.</hi> I had almoſt
ſaid, as he is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>of a Governing Providence in the

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> any thing prophane to joyn them;
For by Him, as Inſtrument, has Providence brought
to paſs for us all the Wonders of the laſt Age—An
Age big with mighty Events, ſwell'd with the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
Revolutions of Kingdoms, and the mighty
Downfall of Hell's monſtrous Schemes, laid deep,
and politickly derected at the Intereſt and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
of Chriſt Jeſus in the World.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>William</hi> was the Thunderbolt that ſplit all the
mighty Work, that blow up the Foundation of the
Devil's Kingdom in <hi>Europe</hi>; that ſhook the vaſt
Fabrick, and left it ſo weak, that even a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
is thought on, Can an Engliſh Man go to Bed,
or riſe up, without bleſſing the very Name of
King <hi>William</hi>? His Perils have been our Safety,
his Labours our Eaſe, his Cares our Comfort, his
continued Haraſſing and Fatigue, our continued
Calm and Tranquility.</p>
            <p>When you ſit down to eat why have you not
Soldiers quarter'd in your Houſes to command
your Servants and inſult your Tables? 'Tis becauſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0522500700:4"/>
               <hi>King William</hi> ſubjected the Military to the Civil
Authority, and made the Sword of Juſtice triumph
over the Sword of War, When you lye down at
Night why do you not bolt and bar your Chamber,
to defend the Chaſtity of your Wives and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
from the ungovern'd Luſt of raging Mercen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries?
'Tis becauſe <hi>King William</hi> reſtored the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty
and Dominion of the Laws, and made the
Red-Coat World Servants to thoſe that paid them.
When you receive your Rents, why are not arbitary
Defalcations made upon your Tennants, arbitary
Impoſts laid upon your Commerce, and oppreſſive
Taxes levied upon your Eſtates, to ſupport the
Tyranny that demands them, and your Bondage
made ſtrong at your Expence? 'Tis becauſe <hi>King
William</hi> re-eſtabliſh'd the eſſential Security of your
Properties, and put you into that happy Condition
which few Nations enjoy, of calling your Souls
your own. How came you by a Parliament to bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
between the Governed and the Governing,
but upon King <hi>William</hi>'s exalting Liberty upon the
ruin of the Oppreſſion? How came you to have
Power to abuſe your Deliverer, but by the very
Deliverance he wrought for you? He gave you that
Liberty you afterwards took to inſult him, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported
you in thoſe very Priviledges you ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
bullied him with. You could not with all
your brutiſh skill provoke him to be a Tyrant,
He abhorr'd Oppreſſion, and ſcorn'd to practiſe it,
and he that had Fire enough to aſſault all your
Oppreſſors, and a Hand ſtrong enough to wreſtle
with an eſtabliſh'd and confirm'd Tyrant, had yet
Meekneſs enough to let you oppreſs him, becauſe
he would not oppreſs you, and ſaw you ungrateful
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0522500700:5"/>
enough to oppoſe not your Benefactor only, but
your own Felicity for his ſake.</p>
            <p>Yet to the laſt he fought for you againſt foreign
Tyranny, and kept his Foot upon the Neck of
your ſecret Uſurpers; He trod upon them. And
thoſe than courted him at Home to reſent your In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude,
received his conſtant Frown; This was
the Man that liv'd for you, and yet died by you,
and hearken to it with Regret, and reproach your
ſelves with it whilſt you live, He died murther'd
by your Unkindneſs.</p>
            <p>Heaven, that honour'd him here, and receiv'd
him from hence, has ſhown ſome dreadful Inſtances
of his Abhorrence of the Manner he was treated
here, and has reſented the particular Inſults done
to his Name, as if done to himſelf; And I wiſh
I could not ſay, Heaven ſeems to puniſh us Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onally
for our National Uſage of this Prince, who
was his eminent Inſtrument to us for Good.</p>
            <p>How are we, notwithſtanding our Victories, yet
embarraſs'd in that cruel and bloody War, which
we reproach'd him for not ending ſooner? We
have not yet arriv'd to that Partition-Treaty, that
we threw in his Face, And if greater Conditions
have been ſeemingly offer'd us, they have been but
ſeemingly ſo, without any Security for their being
made effectual. We have had Reaſon now to ſee
our Reproaches of King <hi>William</hi> unjuſt, who we
redicul'd for not beating the <hi>French,</hi> while he has
rather harden'd himſelf this Year, than ſubmitted,
after he has been five Times overthrown.</p>
            <p>Let us look back to King <hi>William</hi>'s Part in this War,
and imagine <hi>Lewis</hi> XIV. in the ſtate he was in when
that War began. Not all the Princes and States of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:0522500700:6"/>
united, would have begun a War againſt him. His
Armies numerous in Men, and all thoſe Men veterans
in War, and fluſh'd with Conqueſt; his Treaſures in a
Kind infinite, his Generals experienc'd and enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing;
himſelf 20 years younger and vigorous. I tell
ye none of ye all would have ventur'd to begin the
War, nor would you have been in your Wits, if you
had. It was a Work only fit for a <hi>William,</hi> a King that
could conquer by being overthrown, that could ſtrug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle
with Impoſſibilities, and could penetrate into the
remoteſt Events.</p>
            <p>Let any Man look into the Temper of our Nation at
this time, and they will find we are not now fit for a
Diſaſter, as we were then; we have fought the <hi>French,</hi>
and beaten them, thank God for it; for Woe to us if we
had loſt the Day! How would our Credit have been
run down, our Bank being puſh'd at, our General in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted,
our Miniſtry abus'd, as if really Men were now
in God's ſtead.</p>
            <p>And that the Duke of <hi>Marlborough</hi> could not only fight
for Victory, but command it, But King <hi>William</hi> ſaw
Victory even in the want of Succeſs; He loſt the Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles,
and won the Day, and in this I am not too for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
if I ſay, he fought as never Man fought and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
He fought with a fierce victorious Enemy abroad,
with cruel and intolerable Deficiences at Home, and
yet he fought! Any body but King <hi>William</hi> would have
yielded to inſuperable Difficulties, but he fought on,
and reduc'd the King of <hi>France</hi> at laſt, to ſeek Peace,
acknowledge him King, and affront the Refugee that
he fought to reſtore.</p>
            <p>Thus he broke the firſt Power of the invincible
<hi>French</hi> Empire; He broke their old Veterans, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted
their immenſe Treaſures; He took the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<hi>Lewis</hi> by the Throat in the flower of his Strength,
and ſet his Foot againſt him, when he was another kind
of <hi>Ltwis</hi> than he is now. And tho' I would not leſſen
the Glory of the preſent Conquerors in the Field, yet as
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0522500700:7"/>
a Mine under a great Rock, tho' it cannot entirely
blow it away, yet ſhakes it, and diſlocates it, ſo as to
make it eaſier for Workmen to remove; So King <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi>
ſhook the Foundations of <hi>French</hi> Power in ſuch a
manner, as has made it much eaſier for others to cruſh
it entirely, than it would otherwiſe have been.</p>
            <p>At laſt Heaven, provok'd at your Treatment of this
Prince, removed him from us, and were it not a Debt
due to his Memory, I ſhould bury in ſilence the barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
Abuſes of him after his Deceaſe; but particularly
the Article of the Horſe. The King was thrown by his
Horſe, or rather his Horſe fell with him, by which his
Majeſty received ſome hurt in his Collar-Bone, which
as it was thought haſtned his Death, tho, it is evident
he did not die of that Hurt.</p>
            <p>Now let them not only bluſh, but tremble at the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent,
who have inſulted his Memory, by cannonizing
in their Cups the Horſe that threw down the King,
drinking a Health to the Beaſt, leſs ſo by far than the
Bruits that drink it, and rejoycing in the Diſaſter. Let
ſuch no more talk of Calves Head Clubs and Feaſts of
Triumph, tho' vile enough too, inſulting the Dead; but
nothing can match the Infamy of this Practice, odious
both to God and Man. How odious it is to Man, I
think I need not inſiſt upon; no honeſt Man can think
of it without Horror; But how odious to God it is,
you ſhall all be judge.</p>
            <p>Now, Gentlemen, pray remark it, to the Honour of
Divine Vengeance, and to the extraordinary Convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
of all that can open their Eyes to the Methods of the
Almighty, in his examplar Dealings with impious Men;
That of the ſcandalous Wretches, who have thus inſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
the Memory of King <hi>William</hi> in this Nation, by
drinking the Horſe's Health that hurt him. I can give
you Account of at leaſt Eleven, that have had their
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0522500700:8"/>
Brains daſh'd out, or their Necks broke, by falls from
their Horſes; Beſides ſome that have been very much
hurt, but have had Time ſpar'd to them for Repentance,
And if ye think it for your Inſtruction, I may hereafter
give you their ſeveral Hiſtories. Pray mark the Retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
I ſay it again, All by falls from their Horſes.</p>
            <p>Can we have have a greater Teſtimomy of the abhord
Wickedneſs of the Thing? Has Heaven, in any Age,
given a greater Witneſs to the Honour or Memory of
any Man in the World? You may read plainly, how
dear his Name is to the Divine Power, who concerns
his Juſtice ſo remarkably to retaliate the Injuries done
it. That the Party, who eſpouſe theſe People, may
read their Crime in their Puniſhment. Let the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant
take heed,</p>
            <p>Now Joy and Pleaſant Hearts be your Portion, who
commemorate this Day, that Drink a Temporate Glaſs
to the Proſperity of all that love <hi>King William</hi>: that bleſs
his Memory, and hand on a grateful Sence of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions
to the Ages to come. And may all that envy and
repine at his Glory, or at the great Things we enjoy
from his Conduct, be diſragarded and diſappointed, till
they repent, or do worſe.</p>
