            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THE following ſheets are the reſult of a long experience, acquired from a frequent attendance upon the ſick through every branch and ſtage of the Venereal Diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>The medicines directed, though in general ſimple, and eaſily prepared, are of undoubted efficacy, the whole modern practice of curing the Venereal Diſeaſe being given without reſerve in the courſe of this work; and though the Medicines here preſcribed are to be got at almoſt every Chymiſt's ſhop, yet it is not to be ſuppoſed that perſons of opulence will give themſelves the trouble of mixing the ſeveral ingredients; I therefore, hope, my brethren of the faculty will not think themſelves injured, ſince motives of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity ſolely prompted me to this under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking; which, I doubt not, will be found
<pb facs="tcp:0492801400:4"/>to anſwer the moſt ſanguine expectations of the afflicted.</p>
            <p>If this Pamphlet ſhould anſwer the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's intentions, and prove a means of delivering the vaſt numbers of poor, unhappy creatures that are groaning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the vile noſtrums of <hi>Quack Doctors,</hi> from ſure deſtruction, I flatter myſelf the public will not think my time ill employed; at any rate, I hope the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will not condemn the practice, here laid down, but ſuſpend their judgments 'till they have given the medicines a fair trial.</p>

               <p>AS this ſpecies of the Venereal Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſe is very frequently met with in practice, I ſhall take all poſſible care to lay before the reader, every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance neceſſary to give him a juſt idea of the diſeaſe, ſince upon the right manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this branch may, perhaps, depend his future peace, happineſs, and welfare.</p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:0492801400:6"/>
               <p>A Virulent Gonorrhaea or Clap, is a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of corrupted matter, either from the glands of the urethra in men, or the vagina in women, occaſioned from their having to do with an infected perſon. The quantity is always in proportion to the degree of the irritation, the quality, to the degree of malignity in the infectious matter, received from the infected perſon, in coition.</p>
               <p>After a man has had to do with an infect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon, he ſome time after perceives an itching in his yard, near the nut, and a kind of rotation of the teſticles, a day or two after, the parts begin to ſhoot, and burn, moſt ſenſibly felt when he makes water, which is attended with a ſcalding heat, ſoon after, a running enſues, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly of a cream colour. This is the firſt ſtage of a virulent gonorrhaea, and nothing can be eaſier of cure than a clap thus cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced; but when the foregoing ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms are either ſuffered to continue, or the infection is extremely virulent, theſe addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſymptoms enſue; ſmall ulcers, called ſhancres, and pocky-warts, diſcover them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon the nut or fore-ſkin: the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſkin is ſo ſwelled that it cannot be forced back over the nut, which is called a phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſis. The running is diſcharged in larger quantities, and tinges the linnen of a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0492801400:7"/>or green colour. The pain in making water becomes more violent, and a pain is felt in the yard at every erection, as if it were violently ſqueezed with the hand, which ſymptom happens chiefly when the perſon grows warm in bed, and is called a chor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dee. But when the running is reſtrained, or blocked up, either from the virulence of the infection, the patients catching cold, or the improper uſe of aſtringent medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines either internally, or by way of injec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the teſticles become ſwelled, hard, and extremely painful, and ſometimes an abſceſs is formed in the urinary paſſage, which becoming fiſtulous, diſcharges a very virulent ſanies, and is called by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons a fiſtula in perinoeo.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP. II.</hi> Some conſiderations concerning the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diet, and exerciſe, in the cure of a virulent Gonorrhaea or Clap.</head>
               <p>I SHALL diſtinguiſh the aliments moſt proper in the cure of a virulent Clap, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three kinds: firſt, thoſe that are moſt proper to temperate the Venereal Virus, to abate the inflammation of the parts, and eaſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0492801400:8"/>the ſcalding heat of urine: for this purpoſe I adviſe the patient for the firſt week or ten days to have for breakfaſt, thin milk-pottage, a meſs of ſego, or two or three diſhes of tea, with a ſlice or two of bread and butter; for dinner a bread-pudding, chicken, veal, or mutton-broth; and of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables, turnips, potatoes, and parſnips; and by all means to avoid fleſh meats for the firſt week at leaſt: new milk from the cow affords excellent nouriſhment, and is both cleanſing and cooling to the body, and therefore a meſs in the evening will be a very proper ſupper. For conſtant drink, I adviſe weak wine and water, or ſmall beer.</p>
               <p>After the virulence is deſtroyed and the matter begins to be of a better colour and conſiſtence, I then adviſe a more ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial diet, <hi>viz.</hi> chickens, veal, lamb, rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits, rice-puddings, rice-milk, chocolate, hartſhorn-jellies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which cool the body, thicken the juices, and leſſen the ſecretions, and conſequently the diſcharge of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nereal running.</p>
               <p>When the running is greatly leſſened and become quite ropy, and the pain entirely abated, I add to the foregoing diet, ſea biſcuits, or Jew's cakes, jarr-raiſins, millet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puddings, and hartſhorn-jellies, which ſtrengthen much; for a diet of this kind
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0492801400:9"/>gives great aſſiſtance to the adminiſtration of ſtrengthning medicines where they are judged proper to ſtop the running, as is ſometimes the caſe in ſtubborn gleets; but if (as is frequently the caſe) the patient's ſituation in life will not allow him to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here punctually to theſe rules, yet as he values his future health and welfare, let him avoid all ſalt meats, as pickled pork, hams, ſalt beef, and the like; for ſalts of all kinds heighten the inflammation, increaſe the virulency, and greatly lengthen the cure of the running, 'till the diſeaſe either changes into a Pox, or is attended with an incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able gleet, and for the ſame reaſons he muſt avoid too great an indulgence of all reliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing acids, rich ſauces, and ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, as things of the moſt pernicious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to thoſe that labour under a virulent clap.</p>
               <p>Exerciſe in a clap while the diſeaſe is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, muſt frequently be attended with very bad conſequences, for by violent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the body is heated, and the blood in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed, whereby both the pain, ſcalding of the urine, and virulence of the running are increaſed; therefore I would adviſe the patient during the firſt fortnight or three weeks of his cure, to avoid riding, much walking, jumping, and the like, which exaſperate the ſymptoms very much, and to
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0492801400:10"/>keep himſelf as ſtill as poſſible; for by this means the parts will recover their former tone, ſtrength, and vigour, in a much ſhorter time.</p>
               <p>Towards the cloſe of the diſeaſe, when only a weakneſs of the parts, and a gleety weeping remains, I adviſe the moderate uſe of the cold-bath, which is a remedy I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to all others, for it braces up the nerves, conſolidates the broken fibres of the ure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thra, and ſtrengthens and reſtores the tone of the genitals.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who are deſirous of experiencing the benefit of cold bathing, ought in the morning faſting to plunge over head, and to continue no longer under water than they can bear to hold their breath; for it is the firſt ſhock that gives the moſt vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous contraction to all the muſcular and nervous fibres, whereby their due ſpringi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and action are reſtored. But before the patient makes trial of the efficacy of this remedy, he ought to be perfectly ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that the virulency of the clap is totally deſtroyed; otherwiſe, by unſeaſonable bracing up the fibres, he will only tie up the pocky venom upon the habit, which in time will get into the blood, taint the juices, and produce a confirmed pox.</p>
               <p>But above all, the patient muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to moderate his paſſions, wanton pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0492801400:11"/>laſcivious books, and amorous dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liances with women, muſt be ſhunned, for the ſame ill effects will certainly follow theſe, as all other debauches, ſince they heat the body, raiſe the pulſe, and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a larger diſcharge by the part affected.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> To eſtabliſh the cure of a virulent Clap, upon the cleareſt principles of practice: I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to reduce the ſeveral curative indications under the three following heads: firſt, I ſhall lay down the moſt proper methods to aſſwage the venereal ſymptoms, by medicines that correct and purge off the infectious venom. Secondly, I ſhall attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain the running, by thoſe means that I have always known to anſwer the purpoſe, even in the moſt obſtinate caſes: And laſtly, I ſhall lay down the choiceſt rules to relieve the weakneſs of the conſtitution, and reſtore the affected parts to their former tone and vigour.</head>
               <p>TO accompliſh the firſt general indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, as an intenſe heat, pain, and inflammation of the yard, are always preſent ſymptoms of a freſh contracted clap, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0492801400:12"/>is preferable to the following method, to correct the venom, and relieve the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation and other ſymptoms. The cure muſt be begun with bleeding plentifully in the arm, which may be repeated according to the ſtrength of the patient, and the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the inflammation. After bleeding, the patient muſt take the following apozem every morning for five or ſix days.</p>
               <p>Take Epſom water two pints and an half, ſcrape a little nutmeg into it, and boil it over a gentle fire 'till it comes to a quart, then diſſolve in it an ounce of manna, and half an ounce of glaubers-ſalt, and ſtrain it off for uſe: half a pint of this is to be taken milk-warm every half hour 'till the whole quantity is taken. During the uſe of the above medicine, the patient muſt drink plentifully between whiles, of barley-water, milk and water, capillaire, or any other cooling liquor. It is impoſſible to conceive how this innocent remedy cools the paſſages, and relieves the heat and ſmart of urine,</p>
               <p>After having made uſe of the foregoing apozem for four or five days, I would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the patient to take two of the following mercurial pills, every night and morning, or according to the operation, one only every night and morning, for a week or ten days, unleſs the patient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0492801400:13"/>of his gums, or a ſore mouth, in which caſe theſe pills muſt be left off for a few days, and the quantity of a nutmeg of the purging electuary, which I ſhall give the receipt of, muſt be taken in their room 'till the ſore mouth is entirely removed, when the patient may again take two of the pills every night only, and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a doſe of the electuary, which method he muſt perſiſt in 'till the quantity of the running grows leſs, and feels more thick and ropy, when he muſt leave off the pills and continue the uſe of the electuary only, every night and morning, for a few days longer.</p>
               <div type="recipe">

                  <p>Take two drachms of quick-ſilver, and rub it with a ſufficient quantity of turpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine 'till it is entirely killed, then add a drachm of powder of gum guaicum, and half a drachm of the colocynth pill with aloes, mix them well together, and divide the maſs into twenty-four pills, two of which are to be taken every night and morning.</p>

                  <p>Take of the beſt honey an ounce and an half, balſam of copaiva three quarters of an ounce, powder of jalap, and ſalt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nella,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0492801400:14"/>of each a drachm, mix them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into an electuary: the doſe of which is the quantity of a nutmeg, every night and morning.

                     <p>Firſt, let eight or ten ounces of blood be taken from the arm, then apply a mercurial plaiſter ſpread thick on leather, the ſize of the ſwelling: this need not be changed oftner than once in four days. Take in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly the mercurial pill, directed under the article of chancres, every night going to reſt, and continue the uſe of it 'till the mouth grows hot, and the gums begin to ſwell, and a ſpitting ſeems to be coming on; but as ſoon as this happens, the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial pill muſt be immediately left off, and the purging pills, directed under the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of chancres, muſt be taken every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or every other morning, according to

This courſe muſt be purſued 'till the ſwelling diſappears. To prevent a relapſe, a quart of ſtrong ſaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fras-tea ſhould be taken every day for a fortnight or three weeks. The diet ſhould be very low and ſparing, and the ſick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould be very warmly cloathed, and great care taken to prevent catching cold.

The fore-ſkin ſhould be gently drawn back and the part waſhed with warm milk and water, two or three times in a day, and the nut of the yard ſhould at each dreſſing be covered with a ſmall bit of fine lint to ſuck up the virulent diſcharge, and if the pain and ſwelling be very violent, a pultice of white bread and milk may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the part every night; the mercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial pills muſt be taken as directed under the article of the virulent Conorrhaea; by continuing this method a fortnight or three weeks, the running generally ceaſes of its own accord; but if after uſing this method for ſome time longer, any diſcharge ſhould remain, it will be neceſſary to dab the parts with a little red wine, in which a red hot poker has been ſeveral times extinguiſhed, in order to reſtore them to their natural tone.</p>

            <p>IN the former part I have ſo fully treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of every thing that relates to the cure of a virulent clap, that I cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect any material circumſtance omitted, which might be judged neceſſary in the cure of that branch of the venereal diſeaſe: For the reader will perceive, that I have not only given the proper methods to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the moſt inveterate ſymptoms of a clap, but alſo the moſt effectual means to reſtore the conſtitution to its former ſtrength, and the ſuffering parts to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer tone and vigour.</p>
            <p>Having therefore accompliſhed every thing neceſſary in the cure of a clap, I ſhall proceed to treat of all the particular circumſtances of the Second Infection, or French Pox, from the firſt and ſlighteſt attack it makes upon the conſtitution, to its laſt and moſt deplorable ſymptoms, where the diſeaſe becomes univerſal, and the patient too frequently ſinks under the moſt excruciating tortures.</p>
            <pb n="24" facs="tcp:0492801400:28"/>
            <p>When the venereal diſeaſe firſt appeared in Europe, it was reputed epidemic and contagious, but it is now known by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted experience, and the unanimous conſent of phyſicians, that it can neither be contracted by any error in diet, the fault of the air, or any ſpontaneous corruption of the humours, but ſolely by infection, and the communication of it from one that is diſeaſed. It is therefore moſtly if not ſolely communicated by the immediate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact of one diſeaſed, with ſome part of a ſound perſon, as by coition, by the breaſt, by lewd kiſſing, by introducing the finger into the places infected by a venereal ulcer or flux, if there happens to be a hang-nail on the finger, or ſome little cut or eraſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſkin. It alſo often ariſes from the long continuance of a virulent clap, the unſeaſonable uſe of aſtringents, or the unſkilful application of ſtyptic injections, whereby the pocky venom that ought to diſcharge itſelf through the urinary paſſage in form of a running, is too haſtily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt, and the inſectious matter is thrown upon the conſtitution, and infects the blood and juices.</p>
            <p>The difference of the ſymptoms have a great dependance upon the influence of the pocky venom, whereby they are either mild, corroſive, or extremely malignant,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0492801400:29"/>though ſometimes the vicious juices of the body occaſion a variety of untoward ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, even in caſes where originally the pocky venom was very mild; this happens in bodies highly ſcorbutic, that live much upon high ſeaſoned meats, rich wines, and other hot inflammatory diet, which fire the blood, ſharpen the humours, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the pocky ſymptoms more corroſive and malignant.</p>
            <p>The ſafety or danger of the patient very much depends upon the greatneſs or ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the ſymptoms, the multitude of the parts affected, and the neceſſity of thoſe parts to life. When the ſymptoms are few, and do not affect the parts eſſential to life, provided the venereal venom does not lay hold of the bones, we may judge the cure will be eaſily and ſpeedily effected. A more favourable iſſue may be expected from a pox attended with a virulent running, than from a dry pox, without that circumſtance attending it: as alſo from a pox contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in youth, than in old people. It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways a good ſign and promiſes well to the patient, where the ſcabs and breaking-out appear full on the habit, and their heads riſe with an eminence above the ſkin, and the want of vital force is the ſole reaſon why this diſeaſe ſo frequently terminates in
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0492801400:30"/>the ſcurvy, aſthma, or dropſy in aged people.</p>
            <p>The cure of an hereditary pox is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, but not impoſſible, the ſame may be concluded of an infant, that ſuckles an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected nurſe. A pox of long ſtanding in a ſtrong, healthful young man, is eaſier to cure than a freſh pox in a weakly, ſcorbutic, or hectical conſtitution, though an invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate pox is very troubleſome and difficult to relieve, even under the beſt conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>

               <p>Buboes in the groin, and chancres on the private parts make the firſt degree of this diſtemper. The ſkin eſpecially about the neck and breaſt, and between the ſhoulders is covered with flat ſpots like freckles, of a yellow or livid colour, it is full of itchy puſtules, tetters, ringworms and ſerpigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous eruptions. There are chaps in the palms of the hands and ſoles of the feet, with itching, from whence proceeds a clear liquor like water: it abounds with hard, callous, round puſtules, riſing a little at the top, generally dry, but ſometimes moiſt, ſcaly, branny, and yellow, frequently on the corners of the lips, and the ſides of the noſtrils, but more eſpecially on the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, temples, and behind the ears, where
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0492801400:31"/>they appear in rows like a ſtring of beads, and gradually creep among the hair. The inſide of the mouth, throat, and noſe, are alſo affected. The palate and glands of the throat become hot, painful, inflamed, and ulcerated; puſtules appear in the roof of the mouth, which degenerate into round, malignant, phagaedenic ulcers, which rot the bone as far as the noſtrils. The mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane which lines the inſide of the noſtrils is likewiſe liable to puſtules, which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce ulcerations, that infect the bones of the noſe with a caries, which being eaten away, the noſe falls down having loſt its ſupport; the voice becomes hoarſe and low, the gums ulcerate and rot, the teeth ach, grow rotten, and fall out, and the breath is very offenſive. The miſerable patient is tormented with pains in the night time, when in bed and covered warm with clothes, which become ſo intenſe that the patient cannot lie in bed, theſe are either tenſive, pricking, pulſative, or rending, fixed or wandering, which ſometimes occupy the muſcular and tendious parts, like the rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matiſm; ſometimes the tendons and liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments about the joints, reſembling the gout, ſometimes they are with ſwelling or inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, ſometimes without. At the dawn of the morning theſe pains remit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come more tolerable, 'till the ſucceeding
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0492801400:32"/>evening again exaſperates the pains, and renews the tragedy, which circumſtance diſtinguiſhes venereal, from all rheumatic, gouty, or ſcorbutic pains whatever. All theſe ſymptoms gradually encreaſe; after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards nodes or exoſtoſes ariſe on the ſkull, ſhin-bones, and bones of the arms, which being attended with conſtant pain and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation, at length grow carious and rotten. The lymphatic glands become hard and callous, and form in the neck, armpits, groin, and meſentery, hard move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, circumſcribed ſwellings, like the kings-evil. The lymphatic veſſels being enlarged by a thick, ſtagnating lymph, form ſwellings, which are called Gummata; in the tendons it cauſes nodes, in the nerves ganglions, and in the ligaments of the joints tophs.</p>
               <p>Neither do the eyes eſcape the fury of this diſeaſe, for they are externally affected with pain, redneſs, itching and lippitude, and internally being loaded with humours, ſuppuration ſometimes happens and the ſight is deſtroyed. The ears are affected with a ſinging noiſe, deafneſs and pain, while their internal ſubſtance is ulcerated and rendered carious.</p>
               <p>Women have diſorders peculiar to the ſex, as cancers in the breaſt, a ſuppreſſion or overflowing of the monthly courſes, the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0492801400:33"/>whites, the hyſteric paſſion, an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, abſceſs, ſchirrus, gangrene, ulcer and cancer of the womb, they are either bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren or ſubject to miſcarry, or the children they bring into the world have an univerſal eryſipelas, are half rotten, and covered with ulcers.</p>
               <p>After this catalogue of ſymptoms, it is no wonder that all the animal, vital, and natural functions ſhould be depraved, and that the unhappy ſufferer ſhould fall into a decay, and at laſt worn out with pain, die conſumptive.</p>

Great care muſt be taken through the whole courſe of the cure, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to indulge in any exceſs, for a little error committed on this head will certainly prove of very pernicious conſequence: all violent exerciſe ought to be avoided, as riding, jumping, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for though the pox is a chronic diſeaſe, and upon that account may ſeem to require ſome degree of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or exerciſe, yet it is frequently attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with violent ſymptoms of an inflammation; for which reaſon, I ſhould adviſe the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient never to uſe more exerciſe, if it could poſſibly be avoided, than moderate walking, or gentle riding in a coach or chaiſe, for the benefit of the clear, ſerene air, which is of great efficacy in the cure of the vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real diſeaſe.

               <p>WHEN the venereal diſeaſe is diffu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through the whole habit, and taints the ſkin and fleſh, with ſerpiginous eruptions; when puſtules and pocky warts beſet the forehead, ſides of the face, lips, chin, <hi>amp;c.</hi> when ſcabbs, and ſpreading tettars, affect the arms, breaſt, ſhoulders, back, and thighs; when foul ulcers occupy the neck, loins and legs, attended with ſevere night pains, in the bones of the arms and legs, as if dogs were gnawing of them, which go off towards morning regularly; under theſe circumſtances, nothing can be done better than to aſſiſt nature, to throw off the tainted juices, as much as poſſible by the cuticular diſcharges.</p>
               <p>Gentle purges in the beginning of the cure are very ſerviceable, ſuch as the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
               <p>Take ten grains of calomel, and make it into a pill, with a little bit of conſerve of roſes. This ſhould be taken over night,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0492801400:40"/>and workt off with the following purging draught.</p>
               <p>Take three ounces of the infuſion of ſenna, and half an ounce of ſyrup of buck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorn, mix them into a draught, this pill and draught may be repeated four or ſive times, after which I recommend the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curial pills, directed under the article of the Virulent Gonorrhaea, or Clap, to be taken night and morning, drinking after each doſe, half a pint of the diet drink, prepared as directed in the preceding article, as warm as poſſible. Between whiles, the patient ſhould make uſe of the warm bath, ſince nothing ſo powerfully moiſtens, and ſoftens the fibres of the ſkin, and as warm bathing renders the perſpiration freer and more full, it conſequently removes the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and aſſiſts greatly the diſſolution of the pocky matter, ſo that by the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the warm bath, the time of cure is very much ſhortned: the method here laid down, if ſtrictly attended to, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a ſparing regular way of living will, in the worſt caſes, effect a certain cure, without the leaſt neceſſity of having recourſe to that diſagreeable and dangerous remedy, a ſalivation. Sometimes the eruptions, blotches, ulcers, <hi>amp;c.</hi> may require ſome topical application, the beſt is the following ointment, a little of which may be ſpread
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0492801400:41"/>on a piece of fine rag and applied to the larger eruptions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> once in a day, which in a little time will diſperſe them.</p>

                  <p>When the cure is fully compleated, the patient muſt be very careful not to expoſe himſelf too ſuddenly to the cold air, if the weather is extreamly ſharp, leaſt from a too ſudden conſtriction of the fibres of the ſkin, occaſioned by the intenſe cold, he ſhould be affected with rheumatic pains, frequently more tormenting, and more difficult to be removed, than thoſe occaſioned by the venereal diſeaſe.
