         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Hackney-Coach; where, I ſuppoſe, they might have been dropt, by Somebody, who had been in Poſſeſſion of that Coach, before me.</p>
            <p>But, I confeſs, the oftner I perus'd the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuſcript, the leſs I was able to comprehend of its Meaning; I had not, indeed, labour'd far in the Matter, before I diſcovered, that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, notwithſtanding he has been pleaſed to make free with the <hi>Stars,</hi> is a <hi>Novice</hi> in <hi>our Science;—</hi> ſo that what he writes, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Thinneſs of Heaven's Purlieus;—ſurmounting the Stars in a Chariot of Air,</hi> and ſuch like promiſing Conceptions, ought not (I believe) to be taken in the ſtrict Senſe of the Phraſe, but only for a Joke, or a Fancy;—However, ſome of my Profeſſion, to whom I ſhew'd it, agreed, that it was a dark Piece of Work, had more in it, than <hi>Satire;</hi> and, for any thing They, or I, knew to the contrary, might be Matter of Danger to the Government, and ought to be carried to the Secretary's Office.</p>

                  <p>Nothing is more eaſily perceived, than, that this Satire is the Conſequence of ſome Pieces, lately publiſh'd, which ſavour, to ſay Truth, of a Senſibility, too like <hi>Levity,</hi> in a Mind, ſo rich, as His, who is reputed their Author; But I cannot, without Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, obſerve the Influence of acknowledg'd Merit confining Satire to his <hi>Folly,</hi> without allowing it to attack his <hi>Wit;</hi> which is not weaker, tho' leſs lovely, when it ſtains itſelf upon a dirty Subject, than, when it orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Beauty itſelf, and adds Magnificence to Palaces.</p>
                  <p>It is an <hi>Art</hi> to <hi>trifle, importantly;</hi> and even to <hi>trifle, agreeably,</hi> has its Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction: But to trifle, unſeaſonably, indecently or improperly, let who will be the Trifler, muſt be, either, inhumane, or unguarded—Either wrong Judgment, or Ill-breeding.</p>
                  <p>What Pity, that the warmeſt of a certain Gentleman's Admirers are, lately, forc'd to confeſs, there are <hi>Groſsneſſes,</hi> in ſome of his Sallies, obſcene enough to blot out any Wit, but their Author's! <hi>Inſults,</hi> low enough to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the moſt vulgar-ſpirited among his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0647000300:11"/>
And <hi>Malice,</hi> animated enough to be beautiful, in any of his Friends, but Himſelf!</p>
                  <p>It gives, however, a Kind of ill-natur'd Comfort to us, who are his <hi>diſtant Cotem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poraries,</hi> that among Virtues, which we muſt deſpair of equalling, we diſcover Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which we diſdain to imitate.—So, pray, Sir, commit the Poem to the Preſs, and let it travel, in Search of its Author, who will, hardly, look for it in <hi>Your</hi> Hands, and, by that Means, it may be loſt to the Publick.</p>
