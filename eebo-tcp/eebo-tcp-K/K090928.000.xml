            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have been many Years a Debtor to the World, and ſince I have not as yet been able to pay off my old Scores, to my own Satisfaction, the following Diſſertation comes out by way of Compoſition:
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0209300300:3"/>which I hope will be accepted in part of Payment, till the original Debt can be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged.</p>
            <p>That this comes out alone, is from an Impreſſion that I have had upon my Spirits for ſome Weeks paſt, that it would be highly criminal in me to let another Miſletoe Seaſon paſs, without inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World what a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure God Almighty has every Year preſented to their View; and that no body, at leaſt very few, have received any Benefit from it.</p>
            <p>The Article of <hi>Convulſions</hi> in the Bills of Mortality of this great City, is by much the
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0209300300:4"/>largeſt of any, very common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly amounting to about a fifth Part of the Whole; and, as I have been credibly inform'd, happens principally amongſt Infant Children: from whence it ſeems plain, that a Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Anti-Convulſive Remedy is wanting. I have publiſh'd the Noble Qualities of this Wonderful Medicine, in the moſt plain and familiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that thereby it may be rendred of more publick Uſe; and I am not without the greateſt Hopes that People of all Ranks will receive Benefit from it.</p>
            <p>I hope I ſhall not be blamed for the Earneſtneſs of my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0209300300:5"/>of this Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, but Extraordinary Plant; becauſe my only Aim in ſo doing, is to preſs People to the Uſe of that, which every Family may one time or other receive Advantage from.</p>
            <p>The Performance is rough and unpoliſh'd; but I have choſen rather to ſuffer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon that account, than let another Seaſon ſlip, which I am ſatisfied would be to the Detriment of many.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING ſome Years ſince had a very terrible Inſtance of an Epileptical Caſe in one that was moſt near and dear unto me, and which baffled all Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours that were uſed for his Recovery; it occaſion'd me many ſad and ſerious Reflections upon the Subject. As he
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0209300300:7"/>was daily before my Eyes, ſo his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs made the more ſenſible Impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions upon me. I had recourſe to the moſt Celebrated Remedies recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in all Ages, and the Aſſiſtance of my Friends moſt Eminent in their Profeſſion.</p>
            <p>Four or five Years were ſpent in fruitleſs Attempts, he every Year grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing worſe and worſe, till at laſt he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came Cataleptick: he would be ſeiz'd as he was ſtanding, and continue in that poſture like a lifeleſs Statue, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Senſe or Motion. When he was ſo ſeiz'd, he was conſtantly laid upon a Bed or Couch; his Fit would laſt ſome Hours: but I am confident, that had he been let alone, he would have continued in the ſame poſture in which he was ſeiz'd, during the whole time of the Fit.</p>
            <p>Being one day upon a Journey, I ſaw ſome Hazle-Trees plentifully ſtock'd with Miſletoe. It immediately enter'd into my Mind, that there muſt
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0209300300:8"/>be ſomething extraordinary in that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common beautiful Plant; that the Almighty had deſign'd it for farther and more noble Uſes, than barely to feed Thruſhes, or to be hung up ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitiouſly in Houſes to drive away evil Spirits; and that the Miſletoe that grew upon other Trees, was ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of being as ſerviceable to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, as that which grew upon the Oak.</p>
            <p>Amongſt many other Authors that have wrote concerning the Epilepſy, I had lately read <hi>Marcus Marci,</hi> his <hi>Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gia Mentis;</hi> the moſt ſatisfactory Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe upon the Subject, as to Theory, that I have met with, and indeed to lay a Foundation for a Phyſician to practiſe rationally in the Cure of all Convulſive Diſtempers.</p>
            <p>Having made the moſt ſtrict Inquiry into the Nature of Miſletoe that I was capable of, I concluded, <hi>à priori,</hi> That it was a Medicine very likely to ſubdue not only the Epilepſy, but all
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0209300300:9"/>other Convulſive Diſorders, upon the foot of <hi>Marcus Marci</hi>'s Hypotheſis. I mean the ordinary and common Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſletoe. The Praiſes of Miſletoe of the Oak had been proclaim'd for many Ages paſt, and none elſe eſteem'd or regarded, as to any Medicinal Virtue.</p>
            <p>The Youth before mentioned had indeed taken Miſletoe in ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities in the <hi>Pulvis de Guttetâ,</hi> and other Compound Remedies recommended in Epileptical Caſes; but when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flected that Miſletoe was but one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient amongſt a <hi>Farrago</hi> of others, there was no determining from the Effects of thoſe Medicines, whether Miſletoe were capable of doing any thing towards the conquering of ſo <hi>Herculean</hi> a Diſtemper.</p>
            <p>In reading the ſcatter'd and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Accounts of the <hi>Druids,</hi> formerly Prieſts and Philoſophers in this Iſland and other neighbouring Countries, who were had in the higheſt Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by People of all Ranks; I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectur'd
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0209300300:10"/>that this Veneration in great meaſure proceeded from the Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Cures they wrought by means of the Miſletoe of the Oak: this Tree being ſacred to them, but none ſo, that had not Miſletoe upon them; which Conſideration alſo further prompted me to try common Miſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe in its utmoſt extent. After I had ſeen ſome of its amazing Effects, I conclude that it was from this Divine Remedy that they had almoſt Divine Honours paid them.</p>
            <p>But Miſletoe of the Oak being the only Miſletoe recommended as good for any thing, I was in great Straits how to procure a quantity of it; for I did not remember in all my Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels to have ſeen any of it: ſo amongſt all my Acquaintance, from that time to this, I do not know that I have met with above two that have.</p>
            <p>This put me upon conſidering whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no the Miſletoe receiv'd any Advantage from the Tree upon which
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0209300300:11"/>it grew, or whether all Miſletoe were not the ſame.</p>
            <p>After my Thoughts had been ſome time employ'd upon this Subject, I concluded that the Miſletoe of the Crab, the Lime, the Pear, or any other Tree, were of equal Virtue with that of the Oak, for the following Reaſons; and which has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd to me ſince by large Experience, which is beyond every thing elſe.</p>
            <p>Now ſuppoſe that the Miſletoe of the Oak does ſurpaſs that of all other Trees; yet from ten Years large Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience I find the ordinary Miſletoe to be the moſt Noble Medicine I ever knew: and ſince it's every where to be had, at leaſt in this Iſland, it ought to be eſteem'd as a great Bleſſing; and if the other excel it, thoſe that are capable of procuring it, ought to eſteem it accordingly.</p>
            <p>But if the Miſletoe were in any manner produced from the Tree upon which it grows, as the Gaul is from
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0209300300:12"/>the Oak; then it might reaſonably be expected that it ſhould partake of the Quality of the Tree that produces it, as the Gaul does, having the ſame ſtip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Qualities with the Acorn, or the Bark of the Tree. But as it's propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by the way of Inoculating, or Grafting, it's quite otherwiſe.</p>
            <p>An Apricock or a Peach grafted upon a Plumb-Stock, or a fine Apple or Pear upon a Crab-Tree one, will not produce Plumbs or Crabs, but Apricocks and Peaches, and fine Pears and Apples.</p>
            <p>As far as I can learn, Miſletoe is commonly propagated after the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing manner: There is a Bird ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known by the Name of the Miſletoe Thruſh; which Name, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it derives from its feeding upon Miſletoe-Berries during the Winter Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. From the Pulp of the Berries it is nouriſhed, but the Seeds are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged with the Excrement undigeſted. Now the Excrement being of a ſlimy
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0209300300:13"/>nature, ſticks faſt to the Branches of the Trees upon which it falls; and if there be any Crack in the Bark, there the Seed lodges itſelf, and produces a Plant the next Year. The Excrement being of the nature of Birdlime, and Birdlime, as it's ſaid, being to be made of the Berries of the Plant; I ſuppoſe gave riſe to that very old Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, That <hi>Turdus cacat in ſui Excidium.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It has been often propagated by cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Slit into the Bark of a Tree, and ſticking in a Seed. I have been told of one that has adorn'd his Trees with it, to make them delightful in the Winter-Seaſon; and ſurely a more beautiful Plant can ſcarce be ſeen.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Pliny</hi> ſays, That it is apt to exhauſt and wear out the Tree upon which it grows: in which I am inclined to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was miſtaken. The Reaſon, I ſuppoſe, that induced him to be of that Opinion, was, That it moſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently grows upon old Trees. Now I conclude, that it more frequently
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0209300300:14"/>grows upon them than young ones, becauſe the Twigs and Branches of the old Trees are more liable to Cracks and Accidents than young ones are: and being moſt commonly ſeen upon old Trees, he from thence concluded that they were worn out by it.</p>
            <p>There ſeems however to be a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt this Plant and all other Trees propagated by Grafting or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oculating; they being moſt certainly intirely nouriſhed by the Juice of the Stock into which they are inſerted: notwithſtanding which, as is before obſerv'd, they change the Nature of the Juice, brought up by the Stock, into their own. But whether Miſletoe receives its full Nouriſhment from the Juice of the Tree, ſeems to me a Doubt. It's true, it continues alive during the Summer, but it does not begin to flouriſh and appear in Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, till the Sap of the Tree is fallen, or otherwiſe ſpent, and the Leaves dropt. Its Berries are full ripe, and
<pb facs="tcp:0209300300:15"/>in perfection, about the latter end of <hi>December;</hi> and the more rigorous and ſevere the Weather is, the more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and flouriſhing is the Miſletoe. Now conſidering that the Sap or nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tritious Juice of the Tree is at this time in a manner ſpent, I am inclin'd to conjecture that it derives its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Support from the Air. I have had ſome thoughts that it was no hard matter to try, by eaſy Experiments, whether this be ſo or not; but being confin'd to the Town, I have wanted Conveniencies of ſo doing.</p>
            <p>How it thrives in hot Countries, or whether it ever grows upon thoſe Trees that never caſt their Leaves, I am ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of.</p>
            <p>Of all the antient Authors that take notice of it, which I have read, <hi>Pliny</hi> in his <hi>Natural Hiſtory</hi> ſeems to be moſt full; but what he ſays, is little to the purpoſe: and almoſt every body elſe recommends Miſletoe of the Oak in Epileptical Caſes, but none of them
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0209300300:16"/>give Directions how even that ſhould be uſed in a rational manner.</p>
            <p>Amongſt the Moderns, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> in the ſecond Part of his <hi>Uſefulneſs of Experimental Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy,</hi> pag. 174. gives the following Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p>
               <q>"A young Lady of great Birth having been long troubled with an almoſt Hereditary Epileptical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper, and after having been wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry'd by Courſes of Phyſick preſcrib'd her by the famouſeſt Doctors that could be procured, without at all mending, but rather growing worſe; ſo that ſometimes ſhe would have in one day eight or ten of ſuch diſmal Fits as you and I have ſeen her in; was cured only by the Powder of the true Miſletoe of the Oak, given as much as would lie upon a Sixpence, early in the Morning, in Black-Cherry Water, or even in Beer, for ſome days near the full Moon. And I am aſſured, partly by the Patient
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0209300300:17"/>herſelf, and partly by thoſe that gave her the Medicine, that though it had ſcarce any ſenſible Operation upon her, and did not make her ſickiſh, eſpecially when ſhe ſlept upon it; yet after the firſt day ſhe took it, ſhe never had but one Fit. And this Remedy an antient Gentleman, who, being caſually preſent when ſhe ſuddenly fell down as dead, gave it her, profeſſed himſelf conſtantly to have cured that Diſtemper with it, when he could procure the right Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, which is here exceeding ſcarce. And what further Experiments ſome Friends of yours have ſucceſsfully made, I may elſewhere have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to relate."</q>
            </p>
            <p>My moſt worthy Friend Dr. <hi>Cole,</hi> encouraged by the common Voice of Antiquity, and being farther prompted to it by this Relation of Mr. <hi>Boyle,</hi> was induced to try what it would do upon a Patient that fell into his hands by the Death of his former Phyſician,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0209300300:18"/>who for three Months had in vain been attempting his Cure. He relates the Caſe and the Circumſtances of his Cure as follows.</p>
            <p>
               <q>"A certain Youth of a ſprightly Genius, of about fifteen Years of Age, who at firſt had laboured un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Fever, from which he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly freed, was ſoon after attack'd with an Epileptical Fit, which was about three Months ſince: after a few days another, and after that with many, but without any regular Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods. Theſe Fits had ſo affected his Nerves, and brought ſuch a Weakneſs upon all his Joints, that he could not walk without difficulty, nor lift the Weight of a few Ounces with his Hands, nor hold a Pen to write withal, in which he before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celled. To this Youth various Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies having before been given without ſucceſs, I preſcribed a Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of Salt of Vitriol; then a Purge or two with ſome Calomel. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0209300300:19"/>I took care that Miſletoe of the Oak ſhould be given him twice a day, with ſome Cephalick Vehicle; and the Apothecary had procured the Miſletoe that was genuine: (Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py he! for to this time I could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver procure any.) Proceeding in this order, his Fits never returned. The Miſletoe being continued to this time, he ſenſibly perceiv'd a gradual Reſtoration of the Strength of all the Parts; ſo that he could now not only walk, but run, and write elegantly, of which I was an Eye-witneſs. So that I have reaſon to hope, that from the continued Uſe of this Medicine, he may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly freed from his Illneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>"</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Good Doctor was one of thoſe that afforded his utmoſt Aſſiſtance to the diſtreſſed Youth before mention'd; but no Miſletoe of the Oak being to be procured, all other Miſletoe was look'd upon as deſpicable; and the reaſon why the <hi>Pulvis de Guttetâ</hi> did no
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0209300300:20"/>good, was judg'd to proceed from the Apothecaries making uſe of common Miſletoe in the Compoſition of it, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that of the Oak. But be that as it will, and let the Difference be never ſo great, the quantity of Miſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe in that Compoſition is ſo ſmall, as to render it of no effect. And as for the Miſletoe contain'd in the Anti-Epileptick Waters, the Great <hi>Zwelfer</hi> has remark'd, that it will not yield any of its Virtues by ordinary Diſtillation.</p>
            <p>Miſletoe of the Oak not being to be obtain'd, I furniſh'd myſelf with a large quantity of that of the Lime; the Trees in one of the Parks at <hi>Hampton-Court</hi> affording great plenty, at leaſt they did ſo at that time. I order'd it to be gather'd at the latter end of <hi>December:</hi> The Leaves, Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and very tender Twigs, I got dry'd over a Baker's Oven, where there was a conſtant gentle Heat, and then had it made into very fine Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, to be put into a Glaſs cover'd with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0209300300:21"/>Bladder or Leather, and kept in a very dry place. If it be not kept cloſe and dry, it will contract a Dampneſs, grow mouldy, and be good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: If it be ſcorch'd by the Fire in drying, it will alſo be ſpoil'd, and of no effect.</p>
            <p>The larger Stalks muſt alſo be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dry'd and preſerv'd, for Decoc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Infuſions.</p>
            <p>Furniſh'd with my Medicine, though of no Reputation, not being ſuſpended upon the Oak; I was very impatient to ſee the Effect of it, and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went to work with it.</p>
            <p>The diſtreſſed Youth had for five Years been labouring in vain, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Month grew worſe and worſe; ſo that his Conſtitution both of Body and Mind were ſpoil'd to ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, that I could not be ſo preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous as to hope for a Cure: The ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt I could wiſh for, was ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and to render the Remainder of his Life ſomeway comfortable to him.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:0209300300:22"/>
            <p>From being one of the ſprightlieſt of Youths at Twelve Years of Age, at Seventeen he was a perfect Mope, a moſt melancholy Spectacle both in and out of his Fits. However, bad as he was, having carefully inquired into the Nature of my Medicine, I went to work with it; I was ſure it could do him no hurt, if it did him no good.</p>
            <p>His Fits in the beginning kept pace with the Moon, rarely having any but about the New or the Full; but in Tract of Time he had them at all Seaſons: ſo I began with him, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any regard to that Affair.</p>
            <p>From the firſt I gave him half a Dram of the Powder, made into a Bolus with Syrup of Pioneys, every ſix Hours; and after it a large Draught of a ſtrong Infuſion of the Stalks bruiſed, and ſweetned with Syrup of Pioneys.</p>
            <p>To my great ſurprize he had not one Fit from the time he began to take
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0209300300:23"/>this Glorious Medicine for a Month or more, and never one Cataleptick Fit to the day of his Death. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to take it on for three Years, but after ſome Months, only Night and Morning; and in the main, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that whole Space, he enjoy'd his Health tolerably well. But as his Memory had been almoſt intirely loſt by the former Five-Years Calamity, ſo it was not judg'd proper to ſet him to any ſort of hard Study, or employ him in any Buſineſs that ſhould give him any trouble: Upon which ſcore it was thought neceſſary to ſend him into the Country, to a good AIr, with one conſtantly to keep him company, and to ſecure him againſt Accidents.</p>
            <p>There he lived, with great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort to himſelf, and Pleaſure to thoſe he convers'd with; and was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times capable of applying himſelf to his Studies. He would now and then have a Fit, but ſometimes not one in three Months; and thoſe Fits he had,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0209300300:24"/>very favourable ones, which he had al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways Warnings of before-hand, ſo that he could be truſted on horſeback.</p>
            <p>At laſt he was taken ill, in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner different from what he had former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly been, and died in about four and twenty Hours. I could not ſee him after he was dead, but deſired that his Head ſhould be open'd; having great reaſon to believe, that the beginning of his Illneſs proceeded from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate Blow upon the left Temple, in which Part he would often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of great Pain, eſpecially in the firſt part of his Illneſs, before he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſtupid. And the Account I had of that matter, was, That there was a blackiſh Spot upon the <hi>Dura Mater,</hi> of the bigneſs of a Shilling, juſt under the <hi>Os Temporis.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It's true here was no Cure, neither could I expect one: I had the utmoſt Succeſs I could reaſonably propoſe to myſelf, which was to render the ſhort Remains of a miſerable Life com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0209300300:25"/>and eaſy: And by ſo doing, to have a reaſonable Opportunity of introducing to the World a moſt Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and Uſeful Medicine; which has one peculiar Property attending it, That it is capable of doing the greateſt Good in the moſt formidable of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and, I dare ſay, will never do any Hurt.</p>
            <p>The Jeſuits Bark is a moſt Noble Medicine in Fevers regularly intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and in ſome other Caſes: but I have frequently known the Miſapplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, of terrible and fatal conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But for Miſletoe, I dare en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage for it, that it will never hurt any one; and tho it be ſo innocent, yet it will frequently cure Diſeaſes, that in appearance (as the Great Dr. <hi>Willis</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents them, in his Deſcription of the Epilepſy, in his Tract <hi>de Morbis Convulſivis</hi>) do not much differ from thoſe we read of in the Goſpels, that were cured by the Redeemer of the World, the Eternal Son of God: But
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:0209300300:26"/>his Cures were wrought by a Word, and not by Medicines. Glory be to him, that in the abſence of himſelf has created ſuch Medicines for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Diſtreſſed, as this I am treating of!</p>
            <p>No one can think that I am ſo far diveſted of Reaſon, as to recommend this Medicine in the manner I do, there not being the leaſt Proſpect of Advantage to myſelf in it; but that I am ſure of its Effects, from thorough Experience, and that I have all ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginable Reaſon to believe that it will prove of general advantage to the World: there not being a Family, to which it may not at one time or other be of the greateſt uſe.</p>
            <p>I have many times known about a Scruple of the Powder, mix'd with a little Black-Cherry Water, reſtore Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that have been agonizing with the moſt exquiſite Convulſions that can be conceived; but then it has been repeated in leſs quantity very often,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0209300300:27"/>till they were perfectly well. I hardly ever knew it given to Children with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out advantage: A Cure is not always to be expected, but Relief is a great Bleſſing in ſuch miſerable Diſeaſes.</p>
            <p>It's good in their Gripes, either to obtund the Acrimony of the Bile or Pancreatick Juices; and if they will not take it any other way, may be given in their Pap, Pannadoe, or Breaſt-Milk. Even to Infants there can be no Error in giving them too much, but the more they take, the better; it being of a nouriſhing Quality, and no ways hot, or in the leaſt tending to throw them into a Fever; nay, is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of itſelf a Febrifuge. I have often found it of great uſe in the diſmal ſlow Fevers, attended with Convulſive Symptoms.</p>
            <p>I have never, through the Courſe of my Practice, ſeen but two Perſons la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under that frightful Diſtemper called the <hi>Chorea Sancti Vitis,</hi> or St. <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>'s Dance; or at leaſt that might be
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0209300300:28"/>truly called ſo. The firſt was before I knew the Uſe of Miſletoe: She had the Aſſiſtance of other Phyſicians be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides me; but in ſpite of all that could be done, ſhe died miſerably.</p>
            <p>About three Years ſince, the ſecond, a Girl of about Seven Years of Age, was brought to me. Every Muſcle of her ſeem'd to be convuls'd; if ſhe were upon her Feet, ſhe was always danc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and throwing her Arms about; the Muſcles of her Face would be variouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſtorted, and her Head moving backward or forward, or from ſide to ſide, ſo as to be a moſt moving Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Compaſſion. If ſhe were in Bed, ſhe was under the ſame Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; one being obliged to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly by her, to keep the Clothes upon her, and ſhe had no Sleep. She took about two Drams of the Powder every day, and by that time ſhe had taken twelve or fourteen Ounces, ſhe was made perfectly well, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues. She grew better by that time
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0209300300:29"/>ſhe had taken it two days, and in a manner well in about a Fortnight; but I order'd the Continuance of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, till ſhe had taken the quantity before mention'd, to ſecure her againſt Returns.</p>
            <p>I have an intimate Acquaintance, an exellent Gentlewoman, who had labour'd under Convulſive Diſorders for twenty Years, and did not want the beſt Advice; her Life was render'd thoroughly miſerable: But by the Uſe of the Powder of Miſletoe for a Year or two, ſhe is become perfectly well, enjoying the Comfort of Life as much as any one does.</p>
            <p>I have known ſo many Inſtances, both in Young and Old, in Rich and Poor of both Sexes, ſome of whom had been many Years afflicted with Epilepſies, and other Convulſive Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orders, that have been either cured or received Benefit from this Divine Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy; that I think myſelf bound in Conſcience to divulge the Uſe of it to
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0209300300:30"/>the World; ſince, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore obſerv'd, it is capable of doing greater things than ever I knew per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd by any one Remedy, and I think it uncapable of doing any Hurt.</p>
            <p>Another principal Reaſon that has induced me to it, is for the ſake of the Poor, the Meaneſt being able to procure it as well as the Rich, and that it wants little or no Skill in the Adminiſtration of it.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Virtues of Miſletoe were confin'd to that of the Oak only, it was of little or no Uſe to the World, as not being to be procured. I have been five and thirty Years a diligent Searcher after it, but never could yet ſee one Sprig; and as I have before obſerv'd, have never met with above two that had. If the common Miſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe that is to be met with in every County of our Fortunate Iſland, is capable of doing as great things, as have ever been recorded of the Miſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0209300300:31"/>of the Oak; I ſhall have that Pleaſure and Satisfaction of Mind, which generally redounds to thoſe that have the Happineſs of being Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactors to the Age they live in, which I have in every Part and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance of Life endeavour'd.</p>
            <p>But if from the common Voice of all Ages, and the modern Inſtances I have produced, Miſletoe of the Oak muſt ſtill be prefer'd; I do not doubt but every Oak in <hi>England</hi> may be made to produce Miſletoe, by the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod I have before propos'd. And perhaps the <hi>Druids</hi> took that Method to propagate it upon ſuch Oaks as were for their turn. And when that can be had in plenty, it will be no great difficulty to diſtinguiſh whether it excels or not: But I am really of opinion, that all Miſletoe is the ſame, for the Reaſons before alledg'd.</p>
            <p>In this Diſſertation I have carefully avoided entering into the Reaſon why Miſletoe is ſo excellent a Remedy in
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0209300300:32"/>Epilepſies, and of conſequence in all other Convulſive Diſtempers; but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend it to the Uſe of the World from the large Experience I have had of it, which is the ſame way that the famous <hi>Peruvian</hi> Bark was uſher'd in: and perhaps the Experience of future Practitioners may make that matter more clear, than at preſent I am ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of doing. Nay, ſhould I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt it, it would ſwell the Bulk, and of conſequence the Price of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation, and be of no advantage to the ordinary ſort of People, whoſe Benefit by this Publication I propoſe as much as the Rich.</p>
            <p>I began with it upon a Rational Foundation, and the Succeſs has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd my Expectation, even to my Amazement in ſome Inſtances. I don't doubt but others will try whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther what I have ſaid be true; and when they ſee that it anſwers their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations alſo, I hope it will exerciſe the fine Genius's of the Age, to draw
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0209300300:33"/>Conſequences from it, that may be of great uſe.</p>
            <p>As the Bark does ſometimes want an Auxiliary, to enable it intirely to overcome an obſtinate Quartan Ague; ſo I have ſometimes found that Miſle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toe has done better in ſome obſtinate old Epilepſies, with the aſſiſtance of an Auxiliary, than alone.</p>
            <p>A Dram of <hi>Sal Martis</hi> added to an Ounce of the Bark, will make that Ounce more effectually to cure an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate Quartan, than ſix times the quantity of the Bark alone will do without it: So I have ſometimes known a Dram of <hi>Aſſa-foetida</hi> added to an Ounce of the Miſletoe Powder, and made into an Electuary, make it act much more powerfully than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone.</p>
            <p>Gentle Purging, and ſometimes Bleeding, are uſeful before the giving of the Miſletoe: but I have been for ſome Years afraid of giving Vomits, even of the gentleſt ſort, in Convul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0209300300:34"/>Diſtempers, from ſome terrible Accidents that have been like to enſue, from moderate Doſes of Ipecacuana itſelf; the ſafeſt, and perhaps the beſt Vomit, that ever was made known to the World, barely as a Vomit to cleanſe the Stomach.</p>
            <p>If the Plant be not dry'd, powder'd, and preſerv'd in the manner I have directed, there is ſcarce any other way of keeping it, but that it will be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred intirely uſeleſs. This I deſire may be carefully obſerv'd by every body.</p>
            <p>I don't doubt but even Miſletoe of the Oak itſelf, or what People have called ſo, has often unſucceſsfully been given, from not being gather'd in right time; or if it has been ſo, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ill dry'd, or not carefully pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved afterwards.</p>
            <p>From the Hints I have given, I hope others will be diſpoſed to try this Medicine to a further Extent than I have been able to do: I have been
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0209300300:35"/>cramp'd in it, becauſe it was not to be had in more than two Apotheca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries Shops, that I could depend upon for its being regularly managed. But for the future, ſince it will put them but to very ſmall Expence, I hope no Shop in the Kingdom will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it.</p>
            <p>If any one will be ſo good, as to communicate to me any, either Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinal or Natural Obſervations, that they have already, or ſhall hereafter make, in relation to the Subject here treated of, they ſhall not fail of my moſt Grateful Acknowledgments.</p>
