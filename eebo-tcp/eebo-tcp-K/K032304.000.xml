            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>Do me the Honour to afford your Protection to theſe two <hi>Petites</hi> Pieces; I am ſure none ever ſtood in more need of ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Friend and a Defender

as you are; tho' I dare not ſay they deſerve this Benefit by any real Merit of their own, yet they have one Title to the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of all well natur'd People, which is, that they have Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies undeſerv'd, and were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted by thoſe that did not know 'em.</p>
            <p>If they had gone thro' a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Courſe of Theatrical Juſtice, tho' it might have been partial, yet I ſhould have ſubmitted to it, as others had done before me; but to be prejudg'd and condemn'd unheard, was har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Meaſure than any body elſe meets with at this time a Day.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Election,</hi> which had the
<pb facs="tcp:0036900100:4"/>
Honour to paſs your Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was objected againſt as a Party - Matter: I fancy both Sides will agree that there are unreaſonable Heats and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagancies belonging to each of 'em, which deſerve to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd, laugh'd at, and exploded by all true Lovers of their Country, ſince by ſuch Arts, our Enemies find the way to poiſon our Conſtitution.</p>
            <p>For the other, it was ſaid there would be Offence taken at the expoſing a <hi>Popiſh Prieſt.</hi> Good God! To what ſort of People are we chang'd! Are thoſe worthy Gentlemen (the Emiſſaries of our moſt avow'd and irreconcileable Enemy) to

YOU, whoſe good Judgment ever engaged you on the right Side, the Proteſtant Succeſſion, and the Intereſt of <hi>Britain;</hi> YOU who ſcorn'd to herd with the Betrayers of your Country, or raiſe your Fortunes on the Ruins of your Fellow Subjects; YOU who ſo generouſly eſpous'd my Intereſt, when you knew my Intention of dedicating to His Royal Highneſs, then Duke of <hi>Cambridge,</hi> will have the Goodneſs to protect a Woman who has no other Merit but her good Inclinations, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Wiſhes for the Proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

which, you know, ſhe was not aſham'd of owning, even when it was almoſt Criminal to pay any Marks of Reſpect to that Royal Family, under which our Laws and our Liberties are now ſo happily ſecur'd.</p>
            <p>I wiſh, Sir, that you may find any thing in either of theſe little Comedies, that may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain you at ſome leiſure Hour. I know very well, that your Time is at preſent, too precious to be thrown away upon Trifles; that Houſe of Commons of which you are ſo worthy, and ſo ornamental a Member, have the nobleſt and greateſt Task now lying before them, the Vindication of our

Publick Honour to all <hi>Europe,</hi> and the Extricating us out of ſuch Difficulties, as only one Sett of Men in the World could plunge us into; but they will meet their Reward; and You, with thoſe worthy Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots engag'd with You, will find yours in the Thanks of the preſent Age, and the Bleſſings of that of Poſterity.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>WHEN I writ this little <hi>Farce,</hi> I was not without Hopes of having it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented on the Stage; what I propos'd to my ſelf, was, the Honour to ſhow their Royal Highneſſes the Manner of our Elections, and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Town with a Subject entirely new: It has had the good Fortune to pleaſe ſeveral Perſons of Diſtinction, and Taſte, in the Reading, and ſome of our beſt Judges aſſur'd me, it cou'd not fail to entertain from the Stage; but the Subject being upon Elections, the Maſter of the Revels did not care to meddle with it, and the Players act nothing without his Licence, ſo that I
<pb facs="tcp:0036900100:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
had given over all Thoughts of its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in Publick. But the Word <hi>Election,</hi> it ſeems, immediately fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd out a Thouſand ſcandalous Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and I was become the Subject of every Coffee-Houſe in Town; and not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding my Friends endeavour'd to do me Juſtice as often as they heard me aſpers'd, yet for my clearer Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, they were of Opinion I ought to print it, ſince ſeveral Perſons had been ſo induſtriouſly malicious as to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that this <hi>Farce</hi> was a moſt impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent notorious Libel upon her Late Majeſty; than which there is nothing more falſe, and the World will ſee how little Ground there is for ſuch a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; its ſo far from being a Satyr upon her, that there is not one perſonal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection deſign'd thro' the whole Piece; I was oblig'd indeed to make an Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Parties, to heighten the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour; it had been impoſſible to have writ any Thing upon the Subject with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it; but I dare be poſitive, that the
<pb facs="tcp:0036900100:12"/>
Perſons among whom the Scenes lie wou'd have given more Diverſion than Offence to the Spectators of either Party. I endeavour'd to make every Thing appear as natural as I cou'd, and for that Reaſon only, I ſtuck Wool in the Hats of my <hi>Whigs,</hi> and Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel in thoſe of the <hi>Tories;</hi> tho' I wou'd be glad to know why the latter made uſe of the Lawrel to diſlinguiſh them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they were labouring to give up all the Conqueſts we had won: I ſhould have thought a Sprig of Roſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary had been the properer Emblem of the then approaching Funeral of our Church and State, ſince the <hi>Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier's</hi> Friends were endeavouring to bury our Religion, and Liberty, under Tyranny and Popiſh Superſtition. Had Parliaments been Part of the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture among the Ancients, and our Manner of Elections known to, and practis'd by them, <hi>Apollo</hi> wou'd cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly have ſhown Vengance on the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Wearers of his favourite Tree:
<pb facs="tcp:0036900100:13" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The Lawrel was ever held the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blem of Joy, and Reward of Vertue: Hence it was worn by Victors in the <hi>Olympick Games;</hi> but have <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> Reaſon to rejoyce in thoſe Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, that pav'd the Way for a <hi>French</hi> Government, and a <hi>Popiſh</hi> King?</p>
            <p>The <hi>Roman</hi> Soldiers, who follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Triumphs, were crown'd with Lawrel, to denote an Expiation of the Blood which they had ſhed in the Wars; but our Lawrel-wearers can draw no Parellel from thence, except deſerting our Allies, ſelling our Trade, diſgracing our Generals, giving up thoſe glorious Conqueſts they had won, deſerv'd to be crown'd with Lawrel, or that they wou'd be thought to wear it as an Expiation of the Blood of the <hi>Catalans,</hi> and of the Twelve Thouſand cut to Pieces at <hi>Denain,</hi> by the fatal Ceſſation of Arms.</p>
            <p>Whatever Reaſon they had for wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:0036900100:14"/>
it, I am glad they had not an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of making uſe of it, in the Triumph they deſign'd over the Laws and Liberties of their Country.</p>
            <p>Here I can't omit taking notice how much the Popiſh Faction encreaſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the traiterous Management of the late Miniſtry, and we ſee by their dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inſults, that 'tis at the hazard of Life or Intereſt, at leaſt, that we dare vindicate our Religion, and Liberty. Had the Author of Lady <hi>Jane Grey</hi> made her a Papiſt, and <hi>Gardiner</hi> a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the Play been repreſented on the <hi>French</hi> Stage, what Proteſtant would have dar'd to call it a <hi>Popiſh Play,</hi> without run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Danger of the Gallies? If the Title of a certain Monarch, who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſet up by the People, in Oppoſition to the Right Line, were to be repreſented on the Theatre of <hi>France,</hi> not even the firſt Peer of that Nation durſt to have vented one Murmur, much leſs his, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out he were furniſh'd with Philoſophy
<pb facs="tcp:0036900100:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
enough to endure the <hi>Baſtile,</hi> and yet the Papiſts and their Abettors dare to do it here. It is with the utmoſt Indignation, that I ſee thoſe wholſome Laws neglected, which ought to be put in Execution againſt ſuch profeſs'd Enemies of our Church and State; for to the Indolence of our Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Power, are all our preſent Diviſions and Diſtractions owing; tho' for the Author of that excellently writ Poem a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mention'd, I dare anſwer for him, is under no Concern for any Thing that Faction can either ſay or write, ſince 'tis very evident their Malice is not levell'd againſt him but againſt our Religion and Liberties, which he has in that Piece vindicated ſo well, and ſet the Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elties of <hi>Rome</hi> in ſo true a Light, that a great Part of our Clergy may bluſh to ſee the Stage become a better Advocate for <hi>Proteſtantiſm</hi> than the Pulpit; and as oft as that Tragedy ſhall be repreſented the Author's Memory ſhall be honoured to Poſterity, whilſt thoſe Pretenders to the Church, the <hi>High-Flying</hi> and <hi>Nonju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring-Party</hi>

               <p>No, Sir, I have four Sons and three Daughters in all, fine young Men and Women as any in the Pariſh, no diſpraiſe to the beſt. My eldeſt Son is a Lawyer, juſt out of his time, a ſmart young Fellow, I promiſe you, Sir. My ſecond I brought up to my own Trade, and he is a very great Maſter of his Buſineſs, tho' I ſay't, as any is in all <hi>Gotham.</hi> My third Son is a Bookſeller, a notable Fellow, he lives in <hi>London;</hi> he is a kind of a Wit; too, they ſay, and makes Verſes; then he has an admirable Knack at quacking Titles. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps you may know what that is, Sir, but for my part, I do not, I confeſs, underſtand it; but they tell me, when he gets an old good for nothing Book, he claps a new Title to it, and ſells off the whole Impreſſion in a Week.</p>

               <p>Why you muſt know, Sir, he is a main weakly Boy, he had the Rickets till he was ſeven Years old, which took away his Strength, and hugely dull'd his Memory; ſo that he's dull, very dull, Sir; I can't think what to breed him to, that don't require much Strength of Body, nor Application of
