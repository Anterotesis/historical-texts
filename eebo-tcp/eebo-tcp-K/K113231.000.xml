            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Our moſt ſanguine wiſhes are frequently diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed by the moſt provoking contrarieties. Some there are who poſſeſs enchanting tones, but are deſtitute of taſte; and on the other hand, we meet with thoſe who are endowed with every requiſite but a voice. When therefore a paſſion for imitation is guided by taſte and judgment, it will always give ſatisfaction; and we are ever pleas'd to view good action, fine feelings, and ſuperior taſte ſupply the deficiency of a voice.</p>

               <p>IT rarely happens that we meet with a ROSCIUS, whoſe imitative genius can comprehend the great variety of human paſſions, and arrive at ſuperior excellence in each.</p>
               <p>There are many characters in which the figure of the figure of an actor gives us a diſguſt, and were they poſſeſſed of every other requiſite, the part would always ſhew an awkward deficiency. —A crook-back'd Richard ſix feet high, will prejudice us againſt the character.—An Othello or a Mark Anthony, have the ſame effect, when repreſented by a diminutive figure.—But I have ſeen thoſe characters acted by a modern tragedian, who hath impreſſed on me ſo ſtrong an idea, that I have ſometimes thought he had juſt left the great originals, and came to mimic them on the ſtage.</p>

            <l>I'M juſt come from 'Gatta; am drench'd like a hound,</l>
            <l>'Tis twenty to one that I had not been drown'd,</l>
            <l>There were wife and myſelf, and ſome brave jolly boys,</l>
            <l>In a ſix-oar'd cutter, amidſt all the noiſe,</l>
            <l>When a blundering broad-bottom'd country barge</l>
            <l>Came bearing down on us,—and then to our charge</l>
            <l>We were all overſet; ſhould ſurely have ſunk,</l>
            <l>And have gone to the bottom if we had not been drunk;</l>
            <l>There was ne'er a one dead of us all, but my wife,</l>
            <l>But they tow'd her to ſhore, and ſoon brought her to life;</l>
            <l>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0796300300:46"/>She was dead as a fiſh, and as pale as a clout,</l>
            <l>But they rubb'd her, and ſcrubb'd her, and roll'd her about,</l>
            <l>'Till they made her to talk, and to walk, and to ſee,</l>
            <l>And now ſhe's as blithe and as briſk as a bee,</l>
            <l>But we boarded our cutter, and ventur'd again,</l>

            <l>Got wet to the ſkin and were glad to retreat,</l>

            <l>With fifes and with drums, with bones and with cleavers,</l>
            <l>The men were all red, and the women all white,</l>

            <l>To me it appear'd like a ſcene of confuſion,</l>
            <l>Without a beginning, or without a concluſion.</l>
            <l>All the folks that were,—Turk, Chriſtian, or Jew,</l>
            <l>Seem'd plaguely puzzl'd to know what to do.</l>
            <l>By the fate of St. Peter, and well too they might,</l>
            <l>'Twas the very firſt time they had ſeen ſuch a ſight,</l>
            <l>'Twas a kind of rehearſal, where none knew his part,</l>
            <l>To act a Regatta's a wonderful part!</l>
            <l>There was none of them perfect, to be ſure, it was plain,</l>
            <l>'Twill be much better done when they play it again;</l>
            <l>But they all from that day have been fond of the water,</l>
            <l>Not a father or mother, not a ſon or a daughter,</l>
            <l>But what have ſate off for a draught or a dip,</l>
            <l>To get themſelves cur'd of the ſcurvy and hyp.</l>
            <l>Oh, were you at Margate, Southampton, or Brighton,</l>
            <l>To ſee them all ſous'd—'tis enough to delight one;</l>

            <l>The firſt to be waſh'd well, and then to be fleec'd.</l>
            <l>The townſmen have all got a wonderful knack</l>
            <l>Of touching your pocket, and ſtroking your back,</l>
            <l>But give them a chance, once, of taking a pull,</l>
            <l>At a fat golden fleece, and they'll have all his wool.</l>

            <head>A LECTURE ON LECTURES, By LANCELOT LAST; As delivered with Applauſe in the COMIC MIRROUR. Written by G. S. CAREY.</head>
            <p>LADIES and Gemmen, I am going pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, as you will preſently find, to give you a Lecture on Lectures; but firſt and fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſt, I think it neceſſary that I ſhould give ſome account of myſelf, becauſe why, a man who can give no account of himſelf, is to all intents and purpoſes a <hi>vagram.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, as to my name, Lancelot Laſt, at your ſervice, by trade, when I uſed to follow it, a Shoe-maker; but happening to ſee one of your lectures in our town, I was inſpired, as it were;
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0796300300:53"/>
and knowing him to be no better a <hi>ſchollard</hi> than myſelf, I took off my <hi>apron,</hi> threw down my <hi>lap-ſtone,</hi> kick'd up my <hi>laſt,</hi> gave up my <hi>awl,</hi> and ſo ſate off to lecture.</p>
            <p>I was a long time before I could determine with myſelf what ſubject to begin upon, at laſt <hi>Stronomy</hi> came into my head, but I found the ſtars were out of my reach, and whenever I dipp'd into that ſcience, I was preſently loſt as it were, in a cloud.</p>
            <p>Then <hi>Ottamy</hi> came into my head, I was at home to a peg in <hi>Ottomy,</hi> for as to plucking out a tooth, picking out a corn, or curing the gripes, nobody is more ſkilful than myſelf; but when I came to the <hi>imputation</hi> of a leg, and as I am na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tender-hearted, I found it too <hi>cutting</hi> a buſineſs for me.</p>
            <p>Then ſays I to myſelf, what think'ſt thou Lancelot Laſt of Chymiſtry, I thought as how that buſineſs was ſomething in my way, for as to your <hi>conſalves</hi> and <hi>preſarves,</hi> nobody is more <hi>larned</hi> in that way than myſelf, but then <hi>thinks</hi> I again, ſome of my auditors may have an objection to the name of phyſic, and phyſic now-a-days is nothing but a <hi>drug.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:0796300300:54"/>Then Heraldry came into my head, but hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening to ſee the king's arms on a hackney-coach, I thought the dignity of that ſcience was gone to the dogs.</p>
            <p>I was adviſed by a friend to ſet about Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wifery. But my mind was big with a thouſand apprehenſions whenever I thought on midwifery, ſo I gave it up because I thought I ſhould never be able to <hi>deliver</hi> myſelf on that ſubject.</p>
            <p>I would have ſet about a Lecture on Heads, but my friend, Alexander Stevens, had diſſected every head in the kingdom ſo well, that I ſhould have been ſet down as one of his <hi>block-heads,</hi> if I had meddled with ever a one.</p>
            <p>I thought the <hi>Heart</hi> would be no bad ſubject, but I could find ſo very few good ones, that I had not a heart to ſet about it.</p>
            <p>Thinking of bad hearts put the <hi>Law</hi> into my head, and I thought a Lecture on the Law would be no bad thing; then ſays I to myſelf, the Law is no good thing in itſelf, but would it not be better if I could make a good ſubject out of it. I thought and I ponder'd about it 'till I found
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0796300300:55"/>
myſelf like a poor fly in a cobweb. The law always puts me in mind of a coffin—once in, your never out again.</p>
            <p>If none of theſe ſubjects will do, what in the name of Lucifer will do,—Lucifer! who the devil is Lucifer?—A great orator mayhap.— Odds-bobbs, an orator.—It directly came into my head that a lecture on oratory would be the beſt thing I could ſet about, and ſo I begins my lecture on oratory.</p>
            <p>Ladies and gemmen, now according to the learned, and I am ſomething of a <hi>ſchollard</hi> myſelf. Oratory means jawing, becauſe why, why be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no orator can ſpeak without his jaws; perhaps you'll think I can't give you a Latin <hi>devination</hi> for it, now you'll find yourſelves miſtaken, what is Engliſh for <hi>Os?</hi> why bon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap> to be ſure, and the jaws being full of bones<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they are <hi>fix'd</hi> proofs that the word oratory comes from <hi>Os.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now I think it is neceſſary that you ſhould know what an orator is——and what is it you will ſay; I anſwer, it is a man—and what is he to do?—I anſwer, to ſpeak words——and
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0796300300:56"/>
what are words?—I anſwer, letters put together, but there can be no word without a <hi>wowel</hi>;— becauſe why; why do you ſee, becauſe they can't.</p>
            <p>What are the neceſſary qualities of an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor——The firſt, he muſt ſpit, then wipe his mouth, then lay his hand upon his heart, then turn up his eyes, then out comes a word, then another follows it, and then, like a poſt horſe, let him get on as faſt as he can.</p>
            <p>An orator ſhould be a good mimic too— Odds-bobbs, now I talk of mimics, I muſt take care what I am about, for I am ſurrounded by mimics here, and they will be for taking me off, perhaps, now you ſhall ſee I will ſave them the trouble, and take off myſelf.</p>
