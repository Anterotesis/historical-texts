            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>To Mr.</hi> GARRICK.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>THE UPHOLSTERER would be a <hi>Bankrupt</hi> even in thanks, could he think of going abroad into the World, without making his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to Mr. <hi>Garrick,</hi> for the Civilities he has ſhewn him. Whatever Figure the poor broken Politician might make before the Commiſſioners of Bankruptcy at <hi>Guild-hall,</hi> you have taken care of his Appearance before the ſelf-choſen Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Criticiſm, at the Theatre Royal, in <hi>Drury-Lane.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I am not willing to flatter myſelf that you were drawn forth, on this occaſion, by any extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Touches in the capital Figure, or in the <hi>Accompagnements du Tableau.</hi> I rather ſuppoſe that you approved the Juſtneſs of the Deſign, than that you were an Admirer of the Colouring.</p>
            <p>The Deſign, Sir, was conceived and executed long ſince, becauſe the Author judged that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in this way might have a ſeaſonable tendency to allay the Intemperance of too violent a Political Spirit, or at leaſt to laugh it into good Humour: With the ſame view it was lately retouched, and given to Mr. <hi>Moſſop,</hi> to be preſented to the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic at his Benefit. And however Men of a ſerious Caſt may depreciate Amuſements of this nature, I ſhall never bluſh for having dedicated a few Hours to them, as I am of opinion that ſuch-like Avocations will more profitably unbend the Mind from graver Studies, than the ſolitary Pleaſures of the Recluſe, or any of the more open Diſſipations of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="ii" facs="tcp:0737000400:3"/>
I am aware that you, will, very probably, recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect a Paſſage in a celebrated Writer<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Monteſquicu.</hi>
               </note>, which may ſeem to render the ſcope of this little Piece ſomewhat queſtionable. <q>
                  <hi>Dans une Nation Libre</hi>
               </q> ſaith he, <q>
                  <hi>Il eſt tres Souvent indiferent que les Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticuliers Raiſonnets bien ou mal il ſufit qu'ils Raiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent: de la ſort la Liberte qui Garantit des Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fets de ces memes Raiſonnements.</hi>
               </q> But you know that the Queſtion here, is not concerning the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſputable Right of the People to canvaſs their national Concerns; but the vicious Exceſs of a propenſity to Politics, when it gives a wrong Bias to the Mind, and is attended with Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which create the ridiculous Abſurd. In this light it was conſidered by Mr. <hi>Addiſon,</hi> who tells us in the <hi>Tatler,</hi> 
               <note n="|" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Vide Number</hi> 155. <hi>and</hi> 160.</note> that he deſigned his Paper <q>for the Benefit of thoſe Citizens, who live more in a Coffee-houſe, than in their Shops, and whoſe Thoughts are ſo taken up with the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the Allies, that they forget their Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomers.</q> For the very ſame Species of People, the <hi>Upholſterer</hi> was brought on the Stage, being perhaps as proper an Object of Ridicule, as mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern I de as and Manners will afford.</p>
            <p>With regard to the Execution, I ſhall not detain you any longer on that head, than to remark that to preſerve the Gravity, which is a ſpecific Quality in Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s fine vein of Humour, has been my Endeavour throughout the Whole; though I am not inſenſible that grave Humour is ſometimes dangerous on the Stage. In the principal Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I conſidered myſelf rather deſcribing a <hi>Paſſion</hi> than a <hi>Man;</hi> and this you remember is mentioned by an excellent Critic, <note n="‡" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Hurd.</hi>
               </note> to belong to the Province of Farce. For this Reaſon the UPHOLSTERER'S
<pb n="iii" facs="tcp:0737000400:4"/>
Scenes are ſtrongly tinctured with his predominant Foible; and as this Foible is generally fed and inflamed by a ſwarm of political Writers, I judged it coincident with my Plan, to expoſe the Duplicity of their Conduct, by introducing the Character of PAMPHLET.</p>
            <p>This Character I have had the pleaſure of ſeeing ſet off with all the exquiſite Strokes of ſo fine a Comic Genius as Mr. GARRICK'S, without being indebted for Succeſs to the Aid of perſonal Satire, having entirely levelled it againſt thoſe, who are the ready Mercenaries of all Parties; and with all ſuch I have the Happineſs not to be acquainted.</p>
            <p>I could here enlarge in the juſt Praiſe of Mr. <hi>Woodward,</hi> Mr. <hi>Yates,</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Clive, &amp;c.</hi> but I have already deviated too far from the Purpoſe, I ſet out with; which was not to inſcribe a Farce to you, for neither of us thinks ſo highly of theſe Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; nor to become your Panegyriſt, for your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Reputation does not ſtand in need of it. My Intention was to embrace a public Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſubſcribing myſelf.</p>
