            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE author of the following Tragedy, has, in his former attempts of the ſame kind, avoided to trouble the reader with either dedication or preface. His chief reaſon for declining this common mode of appearing before the public, was the neceſſity, which it would lay him under, of ſpeaking concerning himſelf and his works. The ſucceſs of Alonzo calls upon him to depart from his former plan; and to break that ſilence, which might now be reckoned arrogant, and even ungrateful, to thoſe, from whom he in a great meaſure derives his ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>He embraces with pleaſure, this occaſion, to acknowledge his obligations to THE MANAGERS of the theatre, whoſe friendly, anxious, and active zeal he hath ſo often experienced: TO THE PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>FORMERS, who have ſo ſtrenuouſly contended with each other, in their very generous endeavours to embelliſh the repreſentation of the piece: To MRS. BARRY—but the public voice has exalted HER above his praiſe: Yet he claims the merit of
<pb facs="tcp:0055101000:4"/>having, before others, obſerved her now allowed and unrivalled excellency. From the colour of the dawn, he foretold the brightneſs of the day.</p>
            <p>For MRS. BARRY he wrote the part of Ormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinda, and the moſt flattering circumſtance to him, in the ſucceſs of his play, is the univerſal opinion, (vouched, not only by the loudeſt applauſe that ever ſhook the ſtage, but by the greateſt effuſion of tears) that the ACTRESS ſo much exalted THE CHARACTER, that ſhe exceeded all imagination, and reached the ſummit of perfection.</p>

                  <l>I haſten'd home, but did not find my father;</l>
                  <l>Nor was it ſaſe to wait for his return.</l>

                  <l>The night preceding the appointed day</l>

                  <l>I am no Ghoſt, but Fleſh and Blood again!</l>

                  <l>How happy, Ladies, for us all—That we,</l>
                  <l>Born in this Iſle, by Magna Charta free,</l>
                  <l>Are not like Spaniſh Wives, kept under Lock and Key.</l>
                  <l>The <hi>Spaniard now,</hi> is not like him of Yore,</l>
                  <l>Who in his whiſker'd face, his Titles bore!</l>

                  <l>She falls a weeping, and he falls a ſwearing:</l>
                  <l>With Tears and Oaths, the Storm domeſtick ends.</l>
                  <l>The Thunder dies away, the rain deſcends,</l>
                  <l>She ſabs, he melts, and then they kiſs and Friends.</l>
                  <l>Whatever caſe theſe modern Modes may bring,</l>
                  <l>A little Jealouſy is no bad thing:</l>
                  <l>To me, who ſpeak from Nature unrefin'd,</l>
                  <l>Jealouſy is the Bellows of the Mind.</l>
                  <l>Touch it but gently, and it warms deſire,</l>
                  <l>If handled roughly, you are all on Fire!</l>
                  <l>If it ſtands ſtill, Affection muſt expire!</l>
                  <l>This Truth, no true Philoſopher can doubt.</l>
