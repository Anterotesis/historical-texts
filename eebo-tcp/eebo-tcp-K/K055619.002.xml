            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                     <p>I HAVE at laſt ſent you all Lord Hailes's papers. While I was in France, I looked very often into Henault; but Lord Hailes, in my opinion, leaves him far, and far, behind. Why I did not diſpatch ſo ſhort a peruſal ſooner, when I look back, I am utterly unable to diſcover: but human moments are ſtolen away by a thouſand petty impediments which leave no trace behind them. I have been afflicted, through the whole Chriſtmas, with the general diſorder, of which the worſt effect was a cough, which is now much mitigated, though the country, on which I look from a window at Streatham, is now covered with a deep ſnow. Mrs. Williams is very ill: every body elſe is as uſual.</p>
                     <p>Among the papers, I found a letter to you, which I think you had not opened; and a paper for 'The Chronicle,' which I ſuppoſe it not neceſſary now to inſert. I return them both.</p>

               <p>At this time was in agitation a matter of great conſequence to me and my family, which I ſhould not obtrude upon the world, were it not that the part which Dr. Johnſon's friendſhip for me made him take in it was the occaſion of an exertion of his abilities, which it would be injuſtice to conceal. That what he wrote upon the ſubject may be underſtood, it is neceſſary to give a ſtate of the queſtion, which I ſhall do as briefly as I can.</p>
               <p>In the year 1504, the barony or manour of Auchinleck, (pronounced <hi>Affleck,)</hi> in Ayrſhire, which belonged to a family of the ſame name with the lands, having fallen to the Crown by forfeiture, James the Fourth, King of Scotland, granted it to Thomas Boſwell, a branch of an ancient family in the county of Fife, ſtiling him in the charter, <q rend="inline">"dilecto familiari noſtro;"</q> and aſſigning, as the cauſe of the grant, <q rend="inline">"pro bono et fideli ſervitio nobis praeſtito."</q> Thomas Boſwell was ſlain in battle, fighting along with his Sovereign, at the fatal field of Floddon, in 1513.</p>
               <p>From this very honourable founder of our family, the eſtate was tranſmitted, in a direct ſeries of heirs male, to David Boſwell, my father's great grand uncle, who had no ſons, but four daughters, who were all reſpectably married, the eldeſt to Lord Cathcart.</p>
               <p>David Boſwell, being reſolute in the military feudal principle of continuing the male ſucceſſion, paſſed by his daughters, and ſettled the eſtate on his nephew by his next brother, who approved of the deed, and renounced any pretenſions which he might poſſibly have, in preference to his ſon. But the eſtate having been burthened with large portions to the daughters, and other debts, it was neceſſary for the nephew to ſell a conſiderable part of it, and what remained was ſtill much encumbered.</p>
               <p>The frugality of the nephew preſerved, and, in ſome degree, relieved the eſtate. His ſon, my grandfather, an eminent lawyer, not only re-purchaſed a great part of what had been ſold, but acquired other lands; and my father,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0548300102:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who was one of the Judges of Scotland, and had added conſiderably to the  eſtate, now ſignified his inclination to take the privilege allowed by our law <note n="1" place="bottom">Acts of the Parliament of Scotland, 1685, Cap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 22.</note>, to ſecure it to his family in perpetuity by an entail, which, on account of marriage articles, could not be done without my conſent.</p>
               <p>In the plan of entailing the eſtate, I heartily concurred with him, though I was the firſt to be reſtrained by it; but we unhappily differed as to the ſeries of heirs which ſhould be eſtabliſhed, or in the language of our law, called to the ſucceſſion. My father had declared a predilection for heirs general, that is, males and females indiſcriminately. He was willing, however, that all males deſcending from his grandfather ſhould be preferred to females; but would not extend that privilege to males deriving their deſcent from a higher ſource. I, on the other hand, had a zealous partiality for heirs male, however remote, which I maintained, by arguments which appeared to me to have conſiderable weight <note n="2" place="bottom">
                     <p>As firſt, the opinion of ſome diſtinguiſhed naturaliſts, that our ſpecies is tranſmitted through males only, the female being all along no more than a <hi>nidus,</hi> or nurſe, as Mother Farth is to plants of every ſort; which notion ſeems to be confirmed by that text of ſcripture, <q rend="inline">"He was yet <hi>in the loins of his</hi> FATHER when Melchiſedeck met him."</q> (Heb. vi. 10.) and conſequently, that a man's grandſon by a daughter, inſtead of being his <hi>ſureſt</hi> deſcendant, as is vulgarly ſaid, has, in reality, no connection whatever with his blood.—And ſecondly, independent of this theory, (which, if true, ſhould completely exclude heirs general,) that if the preference of a male to a female, without regard to primogeniture, (as a ſon, though much younger, nay, even a grandſon by a ſon, to a daughter,) be once admitted, as it univerſally is, it muſt be equally reaſonable and proper in the moſt remote degree of deſcent from an original proprietor of an eſtate, as in the neareſt; becauſe,—however diſtant from the repreſentative at the time,—that remote heir male, upon the failure of thoſe nearer to the <hi>original propfietor</hi> than he is, becomes in fact the neareſt male to <hi>him,</hi> and is, therefore, preferable as <hi>his</hi> repreſentative, to a female deſcendant.—A little extenſion of mind will enable us eaſily to perceive that a ſon's ſon, in continuation to whatever length of time, is preferable to a ſon's daughter, in the ſucceſſion to an ancient inheritance; in which regard ſhould be had to the repreſentation of the original proprietor, and not to that of one of his deſcendants.</p>
                     <p>I am aware of Blackſtone's admirable demonſtration of the reaſonableneſs of the legal ſucceſſion, upon the principle of there being the greateſt probability that the neareſt heir of the perſon who laſt dies proprietor of an eſtate, is of the blood of the firſt purchaſer.

                     </p>
                  </note>. And in the particular caſe of our family, I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended that we were under an implied obligation, in honour and good faith, to tranſmit the eſtate by the ſame tenure which we held it, which was as heirs male, excluding nearer females. I therefore, as I thought conſcientiouſly, objected to my father's ſcheme.</p>

 My oppoſition was very diſpleaſing to my father, who was entitled to great reſpect and deference; and I had reaſon to apprehend diſagreeable conſequences from my non-compliance with his wiſhes. After much perplexity and uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I wrote to Dr. Johnſon, ſtating the caſe, with all its difficulties, at full length, and earneſtly requeſting that he would conſider it at leiſure, and favour me with his friendly opinion and advice.</p>

                     <p>I WAS much impreſſed by your letter, and, if I can form upon your caſe any reſolution ſatisfactory to myſelf, will very gladly impart it: but whether I am quite equal to it, I do not know. It is a caſe compounded of law and juſtice, and requires a mind verſed in juridical diſquiſitions. Could you not tell your whole mind to Lord Hailes? He is, you know, both a Chriſtian and a Lawyer. I ſuppoſe he is above partiality, and above loquacity; and, I believe, he will not think the time loſt in which he may quiet a diſturbed, or ſettle a wavering mind. Write to me, as any thing occurs to you; and if I find myſelf ſtopped by want of facts neceſſary to be known, I will make enquiries of you as my doubts ariſe.</p>
                     <p>If your former reſolutions ſhould be found only fanciful, you decide rightly in judging that your father's fancies may claim the preference; but whether they are fanciful or rational, is the queſtion. I really think Lord Hailes could help us.</p>
                     <p>Make my compliments to dear Mrs. Boſwell; and tell her, that I hope to be wanting in nothing that I can contribute, to bring you all out of your troubles.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>I AM going to write upon a queſtion which requires more knowledge of local law, and more acquaintance with the general rules of inheritance, than I can claim; but I write, becauſe you requeſt it.</p>
                     <p>Land is, like any other poſſeſſion, by natural right wholly in the power of its preſent owner; and may be ſold, given, or bequeathed, abſolutely or conditionally, as judgement ſhall direct, or paſſion incite.</p>
                     <p>

But natural right would avail little without the protection of law; and  the primary notion of law is reſtraint in the exerciſe of natural right. A man is therefore, in ſociety, not fully maſter of what he calls his own, but he ſtill retains all the power which law does not take from him.</p>
                     <p>In the exerciſe of the right which law either leaves or gives, regard is to be paid to moral obligations.</p>
                     <p>Of the eſtate which we are now conſidering, your father ſtill retains ſuch poſſeſſion, with ſuch power over it, that he can ſell it, and do with the money what he will, without any legal impediment. But when he extends his power beyond his own life, by ſettling the order of ſucceſſion, the law makes your conſent neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Let us ſuppoſe that he ſells the land to riſk the money in ſome ſpecious adventure, and in that adventure loſes the whole: his poſterity would be diſappointed; but they could not think themſelves injured or robbed. If he ſpent it upon vice or pleaſure, his ſucceſſors could only call him vicious and voluptuous; they could not ſay that he was injurious or unjuſt.</p>
                     <p>He that may do more, may do leſs. He that, by ſelling or ſquandering, may diſinherit a whole family, may certainly diſinherit part, by a partial ſettlement.</p>
                     <p>Laws are formed by the manners and exigencies of particular times, and it is but accidental that they laſt longer than their cauſes: the limitation of feudal ſucceſſion to the male aroſe from the obligation of the tenant to attend his chief in war.</p>
                     <p>As times and opinions are always changing, I know not whether it be not uſurpation to preſcribe rules to poſterity, by preſuming to judge of what we cannot know; and I know not whether I fully approve either your deſign or your father's, to limit that ſucceſſion which deſcended to you unlimited. If we are to leave <hi>ſartum tectum</hi> to poſterity, what we have without any merit of our own received from our anceſtors, ſhould not choice and free-will be kept unviolated? Is land to be treated with more reverence than liberty?—If this conſideration ſhould reſtrain your father from diſinheriting ſome of the males, does it leave you the power of diſinheriting all the females?</p>
                     <p>Can the poſſeſſor of a feudal eſtate make any will? Can he appoint, out of the inheritance, any portions to his daughters? There ſeems to be a very ſhadowy difference between the power of leaving land, and of leaving money to be raiſed from land; between leaving an eſtate to females, and leaving the male heir, in effect, only their ſteward.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe at one time a law that allowed only males to inherit, and during the continuance of this law many eſtates to have deſcended, paſſing by the females, to remoter heirs. Suppoſe afterwards the law repealed in cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0548300102:7"/>
 with a change of manners, and women made capable of inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; would not then the tenure of eſtates be changed? Could the women have no benefit from a law made in their favour? Muſt they be paſſed by upon moral principles for ever, becauſe they were once excluded by a legal prohibition? Or may that which paſſed only to males by one law, paſs likewiſe to females by another?</p>
                     <p>You mention your reſolution to maintain the right of your brothers <note n="3" place="bottom">Which term I applied to all the heirs male.</note>. I do not ſee how any of their rights are invaded.</p>
                     <p>As your whole difficulty ariſes from the act of your anceſtor, who diverted the ſucceſſion from the females, you enquire, very properly, what were his motives, and what was his intention; for you certainly are not bound by his act more than he intended to bind you, nor hold your land on harder or ſtricter terms than thoſe on which it was granted.</p>
                     <p>Intentions muſt be gathered from acts. When he left the eſtate to his nephew, by excluding his daughters, was it, or was it not, in his power to have perpetuated the ſucceſſion to the males? If he could have done it, he ſeems to have ſhewn, by omitting it, that he did not deſire it to be done; and, upon your own principles, you will not eaſily prove your right to deſtroy that capacity of ſucceſſion which your anceſtors have left.</p>
                     <p>If your anceſtor had not the power of making a perpetual ſettlement; and if, therefore, we cannot judge diſtinctly of his intentions, yet his act can only be conſidered as an example; it makes not an obligation. And, as you obſerve, he ſet no example of rigorous adherence to the line of ſucceſſion. He that overlooked a brother, would not wonder that little regard is ſhewn to remote relations.</p>
                     <p>As the rules of ſucceſſion are, in a great part, purely legal, no man can be ſuppoſed to bequeath any thing, but upon legal terms; he can grant no power which the law denies; and if he makes no ſpecial and definite limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he confers all the powers which the law allows.</p>
                     <p>Your anceſtor, for ſome reaſon, diſinherited his daughters; but it no more follows that he intended his act as a rule for poſterity, than the diſinheriting of his brother.</p>
                     <p>If therefore, you aſk by what right your father admits daughters to inheritance, aſk yourſelf, firſt, by what right you require them to be excluded?</p>
                     <p>It appears, upon reflection, that your father excludes nobody; he only admits nearer females to inherit before males more remote; and the excluſion is purely conſequential.</p>

               <p>I had followed his recommendation and conſulted Lord Hailes, who upon this ſubject had a firm opinion contrary to mine. His Lordſhip obligingly took the trouble to write me a letter, in which he diſcuſſed with legal and hiſtorical learning, the points in which I ſaw much difficulty, maintaining that <q rend="inline">"the ſucceſſion of heirs general was the ſucceſſion, by the law of Scotland, from the throne to the cottage, as far as we can learn it by record;"</q> obſerving that the eſtate of our family had not been limited to heirs male, and that though an heir male had in one inſtance been choſen in preference to nearer females, that had been an arbitrary act, which had ſeemed to be beſt in the embarraſſed ſtate of affairs at that time; and the fact was, that upon a fair computation of the value of land and money at the time, applied to the eſtate and the burthens upon it, there was nothing given to the heir male but the ſkeleton of an eſtate, <q rend="inline">"The plea of conſcience (ſaid his Lordſhip) which you put, is a moſt reſpectable one, eſpecially when <hi>conſcience</hi> and <hi>ſelf</hi> are on different ſides. But I think that conſcience is not well informed, and that <hi>ſelf</hi> and <hi>ſhe</hi> ought on this occaſion to be of a ſide."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This letter, which had conſiderable influence upon my mind, I ſent to Dr. Johnſon, begging to hear from him again, upon this intereſting queſtion.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>HAVING not any acquaintance with the laws or cuſtoms of Scotland, I endeavoured to conſider your queſtion upon general principles, and found nothing of much validity that I could oppoſe to this poſition. <q rend="inline">'He who inherits a fief unlimited by his anceſtor, inherits the power of limiting it according to his own judgement or opinion.'</q> If this be true you may join with your father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0548300102:9"/>
 Further conſideration produced another concluſion, <q rend="inline">'He who receives a fief unlimited by his anceſtors, gives his heirs ſome reaſon to complain if he does not tranſmit it unlimited to poſterity.'</q> For why ſhould he make the ſtate of others worſe than his own, without a reaſon? If this be true, though neither you nor your father are about to do what is quite right, but as your father violates (I think) the legal ſucceſſion leaſt, he ſeems to be nearer the right than yourſelf.</p>
                     <p>It cannot but occur that <q rend="inline">'Women have natural and equitable claims as well as men, and theſe claims are not to be capriciouſly or lightly ſuperſeded or infringed.'</q> When fiefs implied military ſervice, it is eaſily diſcerned why females could not inherit them; but that reaſon is now at an end. As manners make laws, manners likewiſe repeal them.</p>
                     <p>Theſe are the general concluſions which I have attained. None of them are very favourable to your ſcheme of entail, nor perhaps to any ſcheme. My obſervation, that only he who acquires an eſtate may bequeath it capriciouſly <note n="4" place="bottom">I had reminded him of his obſervation mentioned in Vol. I. page 423.</note>, if it contains any conviction includes this poſition likewiſe, that only he who acquires an eſtate may entail it capriciouſly. But I think it may be ſafely preſumed, that <q rend="inline">'he who inherits an eſtate inherits all the power legally concomitant.'</q> And that <q rend="inline">'He who gives or leaves unlimited an eſtate legally limitable, muſt be preſumed to give that power of limitation which he omitted to take away, and to commit future contingencies to future prudence.'</q> In theſe two poſitions I believe Lord Hailes will adviſe you to reſt; every other notion of poſſeſſion ſeems to me full of difficulties, and embarraſſed with ſcruples.</p>
                     <p>If theſe axioms be allowed, you have arrived now at full liberty without the help of particular circumſtances, which, however, have in your caſe great weight. You very rightly obſerve, that he who paſſing by his brother gave the inheritance to his nephew, could limit no more than he gave, and by Lord Hailes's eſtimate of fourteen years purchaſe, what he gave was no more than you may eaſily entail according to your own opinion, if that opinion ſhould ſinally prevail.</p>
                     <p>Lord Hailes's ſuſpicion that entails are encroachments on the dominion of Providence, may be extended to all hereditary privileges and all perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent inſtitutions; I do not ſee why it may not be extended to any proviſion but for the preſent hour, ſince all care about futurity proceeds upon a
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0548300102:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſuppoſition, that we know at leaſt in ſome degree what will be future. Of  the future we certainly know nothing; but we may form conjectures from the paſt; and the power of forming conjectures, includes, in my opinion, the duty of acting in conformity to that probability which we diſcover. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence gives the power of which reaſon teaches the uſe.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>TO the letters which I have written about your great queſtion I have nothing to add. If your conſcience is ſatisfied, you have now only your prudence to conſult. I long for a letter, that I may know how this troubleſome and vexatious queſtion is at laſt decided <note n="5" place="bottom">The entail framed by my father with various judicious clauſes, was executed by him and me, ſettling the eſtate upon the heirs male of his grandfather, which I found had been already done by my grandfather, imperfectly, but ſo as to be defeated only by ſelling the lands. I was freed by Dr. Johnſon from ſcruples of conſcientious obligation, and could, therefore, gratify my father. But my opinion and partiality for male ſucceſſion, in its full extent, remained unſhaken. Yet let me not be thought harſh or unkind to daughters; for my notion is, that they ſhould be treated with great affection and tenderneſs, and always participate of the proſperity of the family.</note>. I hope that it will at laſt end well. Lord Hailes's letter was very friendly, and very ſeaſonable, but I think his averſion from entails has ſomething in it like ſuperſtition. Providence is not counteracted by any means which Providence puts into our power. The continuance and propagation of families makes a great part of the Jewiſh law, and is by no means prohibited in the Chriſtian inſtitution, though the neceſſity of it continues no longer. Hereditary tenures are eſtabliſhed in all civiliſed countries, and are accompanied in moſt with hereditary authority. Sir William Temple conſiders our conſtitution as defective, that there is not an unalienable eſtate in land connected with a peerage: and Lord Bacon mentions as a proof that the Turks are Barbarians, their want of <hi>Stirpes,</hi> as he calls them, or hereditary rank. Do not let your mind, when it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0548300102:11" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 is freed from the ſuppoſed neceſſity of a rigorous entail, be entangled with contrary objections, and think all entails unlawful, till you have cogent arguments, which I believe you will never find; I am afraid of ſcruples.</p>
                     <p>I have now ſent all Lord Hailes's papers, part I found hidden in a drawer in which I had laid them for ſecurity, and had forgotten them. Part of theſe are written twice, I have returned both the copies. Part I had read before.</p>
                     <p>Be ſo kind as to return Lord Hailes my moſt reſpectful thanks for his firſt volume; his accuracy ſtrikes me with wonder; his narrative is far ſuperiour to that of Henault, as I have formerly mentioned.</p>
                     <p>I am afraid that the trouble, which my irregularity and delay has coſt him, is greater, far greater, than any good that I can do him will ever recompenſe, but if I have any more copy, I will try to do better.</p>
                     <p>Pray let me know if Mrs. Boſwell is friends with me, and pay my reſpects to Veronica, and Euphemia, and Alexander.</p>

               <p>Above thirty years ago, the heirs of Lord Chancellor Clarendon preſented the Univerſity of Oxford with the continuation of his Hiſtory, and ſuch other of his Lordſhip's manuſcripts as had not been publiſhed, on condition that the profits ariſing from their publication ſhould be applied to the eſtabliſhment of a <hi>Manege</hi> in the Univerſity. The gift was accepted in full convocation. A perſon being now recommended to Dr. Johnſon, as fit to ſuperintend this propoſed riding-ſchool, he exerted himſelf with that zeal for which he was remarkable upon every ſimilar occaſion. But, on enquiry into the matter, he found that the ſcheme was not likely to be ſoon carried into execution; the profits ariſing from the Clarendon preſs being, from ſome miſmanagement, very ſcanty. This having been explained to him by a reſpectable dignitary of the church, who had good means of knowing it, he wrote a letter upon the ſubject, which at once exhibits his extraordinary preciſion and acuteneſs, and his warm attachment to his ALMA MATER.</p>

                     <opener>
                        <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>FEW things are more unpleaſant than the tranſaction of buſineſs with men who are above knowing or caring what they have to do; ſuch as the truſtees for Lord Cornbury's inſtitution will, perhaps, appear, when you have read Dr. *******'s letter.</p>
                     <p>The laſt part of the Doctor's letter is of great importance. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint<note n="7" place="bottom">I ſuppoſe the complaint was, that the truſtees of the Oxford preſs did not allow the London bookſellers a ſufficient profit upon vending their publications.</note> which he makes I have heard long ago, and did not know but it was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0548300102:14"/>
redreſſed. It is unhappy that a practice ſo erroneous has not yet been altered;  for altered it muſt be, or our preſs will be uſeleſs with all its privileges. The bookſellers, who, like all other men, have ſtrong prejudices in their own favour, are enough inclined to think the practice of printing and ſelling books by any but themſelves, an encroachment on the rights of their fraternity, and have need of ſtronger inducements to circulate academical publications than thoſe of one another; for, of that mutual co-operation by which the general trade is carried on, the Univerſity can bear no part. Of thoſe whom he neither loves nor fears, and from whom he expects no reciprocation of good offices, why ſhould any man promote the intereſt but for profit? I ſuppoſe, with all our ſcholaſtick ignorance of mankind, we are ſtill too knowing to expect that the bookſellers will erect themſelves into patrons, and buy and ſell under the influence of a diſintereſted zeal for the promotion of learning.</p>
                     <p>To the bookſellers, if we look for either honour or profit from our preſs, not only their common profit, but ſomething more muſt be allowed; and if books, printed at Oxford, are expected to be rated at a high price, that price muſt be levied on the publick, and paid by the ultimate purchaſer, not by the intermediate agents. What price ſhall be ſet upon the book, is, to the bookſellers, wholly indifferent, provided that they gain a proportionate profit by negociating the ſale.</p>
                     <p>Why books printed at Oxford ſhould be particularly dear, I am, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, unable to find. We pay no rent; we inherit many of our inſtruments and materials; lodging and victuals are cheaper than at London; and, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, workmanſhip ought, at leaſt, not to be dearer. Our expences are naturally leſs than thoſe of bookſellers; and, in moſt caſes, communities are content with leſs profit than individuals.</p>
                     <p>It is, perhaps, not conſidered through how many hands a book often paſſes, before it comes into thoſe of the reader; or what part of the profit each hand muſt retain, as a motive for tranſmitting it to the next.</p>
                     <p>We will call our primary agent in London, Mr. Cadell, who receives our books from us, gives them room in his warehouſe, and iſſues them on demand; by him they are ſold to Mr. Dilly, a wholeſale bookſeller, who ſends them into the country; and the laſt ſeller is the country bookſeller. Here are three profits to be paid between the printer and the reader, or in the ſtyle of commerce, between the manufacturer and the conſumer; and if any of theſe profits is too penuriouſly diſtributed, the proceſs of commerce is interrupted.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="14" facs="tcp:0548300102:15" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 We are now come to the practical queſtion, what is to be done? You will tell me, with reaſon, that I have ſaid nothing, till I declare how much, according to my opinion, of the ultimate price ought to be diſtributed through the whole ſucceſſion of ſale.</p>
                     <p>The deduction, I am afraid, will appear very great: but let it be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered before it is refuſed. We muſt allow, for profit, between thirty and thirty-five <hi>per cent.</hi> between ſix and ſeven ſhillings in the pound; that is, for every book which coſts the laſt buyer twenty ſhillings, we muſt charge Mr. Cadell with ſomething leſs than fourteen. We muſt ſet the copies at fourteen ſhillings each, and ſuperadd what is called the quarterly-book, or for every hundred books ſo charged we muſt deliver an hundred and four.</p>
                     <p>The profits will then ſtand thus:</p>
                     <p>Mr. Cadell, who runs no hazard, and gives no credit, will be paid for warehouſe room and attendance by a ſhilling profit on each book, and his chance of the quarterly-book.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Dilly, who buys the book for fifteen ſhillings, and who will expect the quarterly-book if he takes five-and twenty, will ſell it to his country cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomer at ſixteen and ſix-pence, by which, at the hazard of loſs, and the certainty of long credit, he gains the regular profit of ten <hi>per cent.</hi> which is expected in the wholeſale trade.</p>
                     <p>The country bookſeller, buying at ſixteen and ſix-pence, and commonly truſting a conſiderable time, gains but three and ſix-pence, and, if he truſts a year, not much more than two and ſix-pence; otherwiſe than as he may, perhaps, take as long credit as he gives.</p>
                     <p>With leſs profit than this, and more you ſee he cannot have, the country bookſeller cannot live; for his receipts are ſmall, and his debts ſometimes bad.</p>
                     <p>Thus, dear Sir, I have been incited by Dr. *******'s letter to give you a detail of the circulation of books, which, perhaps, every man has not had opportunity of knowing; and which thoſe who know it, do not, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, always diſtinctly conſider.</p>

Having arrived in London late on Friday, the 15th of March, I haſtened  next morning to wait on Dr. Johnſon, at his houſe; but found he was removed from Johnſon's-court, No. 7, to Bolt-court, No. 8, ſtill keeping to his favourite Fleet-ſtreet. My reflection at the time upon this change as marked in my Journal, is, as follows, <q rend="inline">"I felt a fooliſh regret that he had left a court which bore his name; but it was not fooliſh to be affected with ſome tenderneſs of regard for a place in which I had ſeen him a great deal, from whence I had often iſſued a better and a happier man than when I went in, and which had often appeared to my imagination while I trod its pavement, in the ſolemn darkneſs of the night, to be ſacred to wiſdom and piety."</q> Being informed that he was at Mr. Thrale's, in the Borough, I haſtened thither, and found Mrs. Thrale and him at breakfaſt. I was kindly welcomed. In a moment he was in a full glow of converſation, and I felt myſelf elevated as if brought into another ſtate of being. Mrs. Thrale and I looked to each other while he talked, and our looks expreſſed our congenial admiration and affection for him. I ſhall ever recollect this ſcene with great pleaſure. I exclaimed to her, <q rend="inline">"I am now, intellectually, <hi>Hermippus redivivus,</hi> I am quite reſtored by him, by transfuſion of <hi>mind.</hi>"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"There are many (ſhe replied,) who admire and reſpect Mr. Johnſon, but you and I <hi>love</hi> him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſeemed very happy in the near proſpect of going to Italy with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale. <q rend="inline">"But (ſaid he,) before leaving England I am to take a jaunt to Oxford, Birmingham, my native city Lichfield, and my old friend, Dr. Taylor's, at Aſhbourne, in Derbyſhire. I ſhall go in a few days, and you, Boſwell, ſhall go with me."</q> I was ready to accompany him; being willing even to leave London to have the pleaſure of his converſation.</p>
               <p>I mentioned with much regret the extravagance of the repreſentative of a great family in Scotland, by which there was danger of its being ruined; and as Johnſon reſpected it for its antiquity, he joined with me in thinking it would be happy if this perſon ſhould die. Mrs. Thrale ſeemed ſhocked at this, as feudal barbarity; and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I do not underſtand this preference of the eſtate to its owner; of the land to the man who walks upon that land."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Madam, it is not a preference of the land to its owner; it is the preference of a family to an individual. Here is an eſtabliſhment in a country, which is of importance for ages not only to the chief but to his people; an eſtabliſhment which extends upwards and downwards; that this ſhould be deſtroyed by one idle fellow is a ſad thing."</q>

                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:0548300102:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 He ſaid <q rend="inline">"Entails are good, becauſe it is good to preſerve in a country, ſerieses of men, to whom the people are accuſtomed to look up as to their leaders. But I am for leaving a quantity of land in commerce, to excite induſtry and keep money in the country; for if no land were to be bought in a country, there would be no encouragement to acquire wealth, becauſe a family could not be founded there; or if it were acquired, it muſt be carried away to another country where land may be bought. And although the land in every country will remain the ſame, and be as fertile where there is no money, as where there is, yet all that portion of the happineſs of civil life, which is produced by money circulating in a country, would be loſt."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, would it be for the advantage of a country that all its lands were ſold at once?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"So far, Sir, as money produces good it would be an advantage; for, then that country would have as much money circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating in it as it is worth. But to be ſure this would be counterbalanced by diſadvantages attending a total change of proprietors."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I expreſſed my opinion that the power of entailing ſhould be limited thus: <q rend="inline">"That there ſhould be one third, or perhaps one half of the land of a country kept free for commerce; that the proportion allowed to be entailed, ſhould be parcelled out ſo as that no family could entail above a certain quantity. Let a family according to the abilities of its repreſentatives, be richer or poorer in different generations, or always rich if its repreſentatives be always wiſe: but let its abſolute permanency be moderate. In this way we ſhould be certain of there being always a number of eſtabliſhed roots; and as in the courſe of nature, there is in every age an extinction of ſome families, there would be continual openings for men ambitious of perpetuity, to plant a ſtock in the entail ground <note n="9" place="bottom">The privilege of perpetuating in a family an eſtate and arms <hi>indefeaſibly</hi> from generation to generation, is enjoyed by none of his Majeſty's ſubjects except in Scotland, where the legal fiction of a <hi>fiue and recovery</hi> is unknown. It is a privilege ſo proud, that I ſhould think it would be proper to have the exerciſe of it dependent on the royal prerogative. It ſeems abſurd to permit the power of perpetuating their repreſentation, to men, who having had no eminent merit, have truly no name. The King, as the impartial father of his people, would never refuſe to grant the privilege to thoſe who deſerved it.</note>.</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, mankind will be better able to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the ſyſtem of entails, when the evil of too much land being locked up by them is felt, than we can do at preſent when it is not felt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned Dr. Adam Smith's book on <q rend="inline">"The Wealth of Nations,"</q> which was juſt publiſhed, and that Sir John Pringle had obſerved to me, that Dr. Smith, who had never been in trade, could not be expected to write well
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0548300102:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>
on that ſubject any more than a lawyer upon phyſick. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He is  miſtaken, Sir; a man who has never been engaged in trade himſelf may undoubtedly write well upon trade, and there is nothing which requires more to be illuſtrated by philoſophy than trade does. As to mere wealth, that is to ſay, money, it is clear that one nation or one individual cannot increaſe its ſtore but by making another poorer: but trade procures what is more valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, the reciprocation of the peculiar advantages of different countries. A merchant ſeldom thinks but of his own particular trade. To write a good book upon it, a man muſt have extenſive views. It is not neceſſary to have practiſed, to write well upon a ſubject."</q> I mentioned law as a ſubject on which no man could write well without practice. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, in England, where ſo much money is to be got by the practice of the law, moſt of our writers upon it have been in practice; though Blackſtone had not been much in practice when he publiſhed his 'Commentaries.' But upon the Continent, the great writers on law have not all been in practice: Grotius, indeed, was; but Puffendorf was not, Burlamaqui was not."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When we had talked of the great conſequence which a man acquired by being employed in his profeſſion, I ſuggeſted a doubt of the juſtice of the general opinion, that it is improper in a lawyer to ſolicit employment; for why, I urged, ſhould it not be equally allowable to ſolicit that as the means of conſequence, as it is to ſolicit votes to be elected a member of parliament? Mr. Strahan had told me, that a countryman of his and mine, who had riſen to eminence in the law, had, when firſt making his way, ſolicited him to get him employed in city cauſes. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is wrong to ſtir up law-ſuits; but when once it is certain that a law-ſuit is to go on, there is nothing wrong in a lawyer's endeavouring that he ſhall have the benefit rather than another."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"You would not ſolicit employment, Sir, if you were a lawyer."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; but not becauſe I ſhould think it wrong, but becauſe I ſhould diſdain it."</q> This was a good diſtinction, which will be felt by men of juſt pride. He proceeded: <q rend="inline">"However, I would not have a lawyer to be wanting to himſelf in uſing fair means. I would have him to inject a little hint now and then, to prevent his being overlooked."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lord Mounſtuart's bill for a Scotch militia, in ſupporting which his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip had made an able ſpeech in the Houſe of Commons, was now a pretty general topick of converſation.—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"As Scotland contributes ſo little land-tax towards the general ſupport of the nation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ought not to have a militia paid out of the general fund, unleſs it ſhould be thought for the general intereſt, that Scotland ſhould be protected from an invaſion, which no man
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0548300102:19" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 can think will happen; for what enemy would invade Scotland, where there is nothing to be got? No, Sir; now that the Scotch have not the pay of Engliſh ſoldiers ſpent among them, as ſo many troops are ſent abroad, they are trying to get money another way by having a militia paid. If they are afraid, and ſeriouſly deſire to have an armed force to defend them, they ſhould pay for it. Your ſcheme is to retain a part of your little land-tax, by making us pay and clothe your militia."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"You ſhould not talk of <hi>we</hi> and <hi>you,</hi> Sir; there is now an <hi>Union.</hi>"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"There muſt be a diſtinction of intereſt, while the proportions of land-tax are ſo unequal. If Yorkſhire ſhould ſay, 'Inſtead of paying our land-tax, we will keep a greater number of militia,' it would be unreaſonable."</q> In this argument my friend was certainly in the wrong. The land-tax is as unequally proportioned between different parts of England, as between England and Scotland; nay, it is conſiderably unequal in Scotland itſelf. But the land-tax is but a ſmall part of the numerous branches of publick revenue, all of which Scotland pays preciſely as England does. A French invaſion made in Scotland would ſoon penetrate into England.</p>
               <p>He thus diſcourſed upon ſuppoſed obligations in ſettling eſtates:—<q rend="inline">"Where a man gets the unlimited property of an eſtate, there is no obligation upon him in <hi>juſtice</hi> to leave it to one perſon rather than to another. There is a motive of preference from <hi>kindneſs,</hi> and this kindneſs is generally entertained for the neareſt relation. If I <hi>owe</hi> a particular man a ſum of money, I am obliged to let that man have the next money I get, and cannot in juſtice let another have it: but if I owe money to no man, I may diſpoſe of what I get as I pleaſe. There is not a <hi>debitum juſtitiae</hi> to a man's next heir; there is only a <hi>debitum caritatis.</hi> It is plain, then, that I have morally a choice, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to my liking. If I have a brother in want, he has a claim from affection to my aſſiſtance: but if I have alſo a brother in want, whom I like better, he has a preferable claim. The right of an heir at law is only this, that he is to have the ſucceſſion to an eſtate, in caſe no other perſon is appointed to it by the owner. His right is merely preferable to that of the King."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We got into a boat to croſs over to Black-friars; and as we moved along the Thames, I talked to him of a little volume, which, altogether unknown to him, was advertiſed to be publiſhed in a few days, under the title of <q rend="inline">"<hi>Johnſoniana,</hi> or <hi>Bon Mots</hi> of Dr. Johnſon."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is a mighty impudent thing."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, could you have no redreſs if you were to proſecute a publiſher for bringing out, under your name, what you never ſaid, and aſcribing to you dull ſtupid nonſenſe, or making you ſwear profanely, as many ignorant relaters of your <hi>bon mots</hi> do?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0548300102:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Sir; there will always be ſome truth mixed with the falſehood, and how can  it be aſcertained how much is true and how much is falſe? Beſides, Sir, what damages would a jury give me for having been repreſented as ſwearing?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I think, Sir, you ſhould at leaſt diſavow ſuch a publication, becauſe the world and poſterity might with much plauſible foundation ſay, 'Here is a volume which was publickly advertiſed and came out in Dr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Johnſon's own time, and, by his ſilence, was admitted by him to be genuine<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I ſhall give myſelf no trouble about the matter."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He was, perhaps, above ſuffering from ſuch ſpurious publications; but I could not help thinking, that many men would be much injured in their reputation, by having abſurd and vicious ſayings imputed to them; and that redreſs ought in ſuch caſes to be given.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"The value of every ſtory depends on its being true. A ſtory is a picture either of an individual or of human nature in general: if it be falſe, it is a picture of nothing. For inſtance: ſuppoſe a man ſhould tell that Johnſon, before ſetting out for Italy, as he had to croſs the Alps, fat down to make himſelf wings. This many people would believe; but it would be a picture of nothing. ******* (naming a worthy friend of ours,) uſed to think a ſtory, a ſtory, till I ſhewed him that truth was eſſential to it."</q> I obſerved, that Foote entertained us with ſtories which were not true; but that, indeed, it was properly not as narratives that Foote's ſtories pleaſed us, but as collections of ludicrous images. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Foote is quite impartial, for he tells lies of every body."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The importance of ſtrict and ſcrupulous veracity cannot be too often incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. Johnſon was known to be ſo rigidly attentive to it, that even in his common converſation the ſlighteſt circumſtance was mentioned with exact preciſion. The knowledge of his having ſuch a principle and habit made his friends have a perfect reliance on the truth of every thing that he told, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it might have been doubted if told by many others. As an inſtance of this, I may mention an odd incident which he related as having happened to him one night in Fleet-ſtreet. <q rend="inline">"A gentlewoman (ſaid he) begged I would give her my arm to aſſiſt her in croſſing the ſtreet, which I accordingly did; upon which ſhe offered me a ſhilling, ſuppoſing me to be the watchman. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived that ſhe was ſomewhat in liquor."</q> This, if told by moſt people, would have been thought an invention: when told by J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>nſon, it was believed by his friends as much as if they had ſeen what paſſed.</p>
               <p>We landed at the Temple-ſtairs, where we parted.</p>

                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:0548300102:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 I found him in the evening in Mrs. Williams's room. We talked of religious orders. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is as unreaſonable for a man to go into a Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſian convent, for fear of being immoral, as for a man to cut off his hands for fear he ſhould ſteal. There is, indeed, great reſolution in the immediate act of diſmembering himſelf; but when that is once done, he has no longer any merit: for though it is out of his power to ſteal, yet he may all his life be a thief in his heart. So when a man has once become a Carthuſian, he is obliged to continue ſo, whether he chooſes it or not. Their ſilence, too, is abſurd. We read in the goſpel of the apoſtles being ſent to preach, but not to hold their tongues. All ſeverity that does not tend to increaſe good, or prevent evil, is idle. I ſaid to the Lady Abbeſs of a convent, 'Madam, you are here, not for the love of virtue, but the fear of vice.' She ſaid, 'She ſhould remember this as long as ſhe lived."</q> I thought it hard to give her this view of her ſituation, when ſhe could not help it; and, indeed, I won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at the whole of what he now ſaid; becauſe, both in his <q rend="inline">"Rambler"</q> and <q rend="inline">"Idler,"</q> he treats religious auſterities with much ſolemnity of reſpect.</p>
               <p>Finding him ſtill perſevering in his abſtinence from wine, I ventured to ſpeak to him of it.—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I have no objection to a man's drinking wine, if he can do it in moderation. I found myſelf apt to go to exceſs in it, and therefore, after having been for ſome time without it, on account of ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I thought it better not to return to it. Every man is to judge for himſelf, according to the effects which he experiences. One of the fathers tells us, he found faſting made him ſo peeviſh that he did not practiſe it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Though he often enlarged upon the evil of intoxication, he was by no means harſh and unforgiving to thoſe who indulged in occaſional exceſs in wine. One of his friends, I well remember, came to ſup at a tavern with him and ſome other gentlemen, and too plainly diſcovered that he had drunk too much at dinner. When one who loved miſchief, thinking to produce a ſevere cenſure, aſked Johnſon, ſome days afterwards, <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, what did your friend ſay to you, as an apology for being in ſuch a ſituation?"</q> Johnſon anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Sir, he ſaid all that a man <hi>ſhould</hi> ſay: he ſaid he was ſorry for it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I heard him once give a very judicious practical advice upon this ſubject: <q rend="inline">"A man, (ſaid he,) who has been drinking wine at all freely, ſhould never go into a new company<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> With thoſe who have partaken of wine with him, he may be pretty well in uniſon; but he will probably be offenſive, or appear ridiculous, to other people.</q>

He allowed very great influence to education. <q rend="inline">"I do not deny, Sir, but  there is ſome original difference in minds; but it is nothing in compariſon of what is formed by education. We may inſtance the ſcience of <hi>numbers,</hi> which all minds are equally capable of attaining; yet we find a prodigious difference in the powers of different men, in that reſpect, after they are grown up, becauſe their minds have been more or leſs exerciſed in it; and I think the ſame cauſe will explain the difference of excellence in other things, gradations admitting always ſome difference in the firſt principles."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is a difficult ſubject; but it is beſt to hope that diligence may do a great deal. We are <hi>ſure</hi> of what it can do, in increaſing our mechanical force and dexterity.</p>
               <p>I again viſited him on Monday. He took occaſion to enlarge, as he often did, upon the wretchedneſs of a ſea-life. <q rend="inline">"A ſhip is worſe than a gaol. There is, in a gaol, better air, better company, better conveniency of every kind; and a ſhip has the additional diſadvantage of being in danger. When men come to like a ſea-life, they are not fit to live on land."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Then (ſaid I,) it would be cruel in a father to breed his ſon to the ſea."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It would be cruel in a father who thinks as I do. Men go to ſea, before they know the unhappineſs of that way of life; and when they have come to know it, they cannot eſcape from it, becauſe it is then too late to chooſe another profeſſion; as indeed is generally the caſe with men, when they have once engaged in any particular way of life."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Tueſday, March 19, which was fixed for our propoſed jaunt, we met in the morning at the Somerſet coffee-houſe in the Strand, where we were taken up by the Oxford coach. He was accompanied by Mr. Gwyn, the architect; and a gentleman of Merton College, whom we did not know, had the fourth ſeat. We ſoon got into converſation; for it was very remarkable of Johnſon, that the preſence of a ſtranger was no reſtraint upon his talk. I obſerved that Garrick, who was about to quit the ſtage, would ſoon have an eaſier life. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I doubt that, Sir."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, he will be Atlas with the burthen off his back."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But I know not, Sir, if he will be ſo ſteady without his load. However, he ſhould never play any more, but be entirely the gentleman, and not partly the player: he ſhould no longer ſubject himſelf to be hiſſed by a mob, or to be inſolently treated by performers, whom he uſed to rule with a high hand, and who would gladly retaliate."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I think he ſhould play once <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:0548300102:23" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Johnſon expreſſed his diſapprobation of ornamental architecture, ſuch as mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent columns ſupporting a portico, or expenſive pilaſters ſupporting merely their own capitals, <q rend="inline">"becauſe it conſumes labour diſproportionate to its utility."</q> For the ſame reaſon he ſatyriſed ſtatuary. <q rend="inline">"Painting (ſaid he,) conſumes labour not diſproportionate to its effect; but a fellow will hack half a year at a block of marble to make ſomething in ſtone that hardly reſembles a man. The value of ſtatuary is owing to its difficulty. You would not value the fineſt head cut upon a carrot."</q> Here he ſeemed to me to be ſtrangely deficient in taſte; for ſurely ſtatuary is a noble art of imitation, and preſerves a wonderful expreſſion of the varieties of the human frame; and although it muſt be allowed that the circumſtances of difficulty enhances the value of a marble head, we ſhould conſider, that if it requires a long time in the performance, it has a proportionate value in durability.</p>
               <p>Gwyn was a fine lively rattling fellow. Dr. Johnſon kept him in ſubjection, but with a kindly authority. The ſpirit of the artiſt, however, roſe againſt what he thought a Gothick attack, and he made a briſk defence. <q rend="inline">"What, Sir, will you allow no value to beauty in architecture or in ſtatuary? Why ſhould we allow it then in writing? Why do you take the trouble to give us ſo many fine alluſions, and bright images, and elegant phraſes? You might convey all your inſtruction without theſe ornaments."</q> Johnſon ſmiled with complacency; but ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, all theſe ornaments are uſeful, becauſe they obtain an eaſier reception for truth; but a building is not at all more convenient for being decorated with ſuperfluous carved work."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Gwyn at laſt was lucky enough to make one reply to Dr. Johnſon, which he allowed to be excellent. Johnſon cenſured him for taking down a church which might have ſtood many years, and building a new one at a different place, for no other reaſon but that there might be a direct road to a new bridge; and his expreſſion was, <q rend="inline">"You are taking a church out of the way, that the people may go in a ſtraight line to the bridge."</q>—<q rend="inline">"No, Sir (ſaid Gwyn) I am putting the church <hi>in</hi> the way, that the people may not <hi>go out of the way.</hi>"</q> JOHNSON. (with a hearty loud laugh of approbation,) <q rend="inline">"Speak no more. Reſt your colloquial fame upon this."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon our arrival at Oxford, Dr. Johnſon and I went directly to Univerſity College, but were diſappointed on finding that one of the fellows, his friend Mr. Scott, who accompanied him from Newcaſtle to Edinburgh, was gone to the country. We put up at the Angel inn, and paſſed the evening by ourſelves in eaſy and familiar converſation. Talking of conſtitutional melancholy, he obſerved, <q rend="inline">"A man ſo afflicted, Sir, muſt divert diſtreſſing
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0548300102:24"/>
thoughts, and not combat with them."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"May not he think them  down, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir. To attempt to <hi>think them down</hi> is madneſs. He ſhould have a lamp conſtantly burning in his bed-chamber during the night, and if wakefully diſturbed, take a book, and read, and compoſe himſelf to reſt. To have the management of the mind is a great art, and it may be attained in a conſiderable degree by experience and habitual exerciſe."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Should not he provide amuſements for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? Would it not, for inſtance, be right for him to take a courſe of chymiſtry?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Let him take a courſe of chymiſtry, or a courſe of rope-dancing, or a courſe of any thing to which he is inclined at the time. Let him contrive to have as many retreats for his mind as he can, as many things to which it can fly from itſelf. Burton's 'Anatomy of Melancholy' is a valuable work. It is, perhaps, overloaded with quotation. But there is great ſpirit and great power in what Burton ſays, when he writes from his own mind."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Next morning we viſited Dr. Wetherell, Maſter of Univerſity College, with whom Dr. Johnſon conferred on the moſt advantageous mode of diſpoſing of the books printed at the Clarendon preſs, on which ſubject his letter has been inſerted in a former page. I often had occaſion to remark, Johnſon loved buſineſs, loved to have his wiſdom actually operate on real life. Dr. Wetherell and I talked of him without reſerve in his own preſence. WETHERELL. <q rend="inline">"I would have given him a hundred guineas if he would have written a preface to his 'Political Tracts,' by way of a Diſcourſe on the Britiſh Conſtitution."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Dr. Johnſon, though in his writings, and upon all occaſions a great friend to the conſtitution both in church and ſtate, has never written expreſsly in ſupport of either. There is really a claim upon him for both. I am ſure he could give a volume of no great bulk upon each, which would compriſe all the ſubſtance, and with his ſpirit would effectually maintain them. He ſhould erect a fort on the confines of each."</q> I could perceive that he was diſpleaſed by this dialogue. He burſt out, <q rend="inline">"Why ſhould <hi>I</hi> be always writing?"</q> I hoped he was conſcious that the debt was juſt, and meant to diſcharge it, though he diſliked being dunned.</p>
               <p>We then went to Pembroke College, and waited on his old friend Dr. Adams, the maſter of it, whom I found to be a moſt polite, pleaſing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative man. Before his advancement to the headſhip of his College, I had intended to go and viſit him at Shrewſbury, where he was rector of St. Chad's, in order to get from him what particulars he could recollect of Johnſon's academical life. He now obligingly gave me part of that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0548300102:25" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 authentick information, which, with what I afterwards owed to his kindneſs, will be found incorporated in its proper place in this work.</p>
               <p>Dr. Adams had diſtinguiſhed himſelf by an able anſwer to David Hume's <q rend="inline">"Eſſay on Miracles."</q> He told me he had once dined in company with Hume in London; that Hume ſhook hands with him, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"You have treated me much better than I deſerve;"</q> and that they exchanged viſits. I took the liberty to object to treating an infidel writer with ſmooth civility. Where there is a controverſy concerning a paſſage in a claſſick authour, or concerning a queſtion in antiquities, or any other ſubject in which human happineſs is not deeply intereſted, a man may treat his antagoniſt with politeneſs and even reſpect. But where the controverſy is concerning the truth of religion, it is of ſuch vaſt importance to him who maintains it, to obtain the victory, that the perſon of an opponent ought not to be ſpared. If a man firmly believes that religion is an invaluable treaſure, he will conſider a writer who endeavours to deprive mankind of it as a <hi>robber;</hi> he will look upon him as <hi>odious,</hi> though the Infidel may think himſelf in the right. A robber who reaſons as the gang do in the <q rend="inline">"Beggar's Opera,"</q> who call themſelves <hi>practical</hi> philoſophers, and may have as much ſincerity as pernicious <hi>ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative</hi> philoſophers, is not the leſs an object of juſt indignation. An aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned profligate may think that it is not wrong to debauch my wife; but ſhall I, therefore, not deteſt him? And if I catch him making an attempt ſhall I treat him with politeneſs? No, I will kick him down ſtairs, or run him through the body: that is, if I really love my wife, or have a true rational notion of honour. An Infidel then ſhould not be treated handſomely by a Chriſtian, merely becauſe he endeavours to rob with ingenuity. I do declare, however, that I am exceedingly unwilling to be provoked to anger, and could I be perſuaded that truth would not ſuffer from a cool moderation in its defenders, I ſhould wiſh to preſerve good humour, at leaſt, in every controverſy; nor, indeed, do I ſee why a man ſhould loſe his temper while he does all he can to refute an opponent. I think ridicule may be fairly uſed againſt an infidel; for inſtance, if he be an ugly fellow, and yet abſurdly vain of his perſon, we may contraſt his appearance with Cicero's beautiful image of Virtue, could ſhe be ſeen. Johnſon coincided with me and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"When a man voluntarily engages in an important controverſy, he is to do all he can to leſſen his antagoniſt, becauſe authority from perſonal reſpect has much weight with moſt people, and often more than reaſoning. If my antagoniſt writes bad language, though that may not be eſſential to the queſtion; I will attack him for his bad language."</q> ADAMS. <q rend="inline">"You would
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0548300102:26" rendition="simple:additions"/>
not joſtle a chimney-ſweeper."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, if it were neceſſary  to joſtle him <hi>down.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Adams told us, that in ſome of the Colleges at Oxford, the fellows had excluded the ſtudents from ſocial intercourſe with them in the common room. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"They are in the right, Sir, for there can be no real converſation, no fair exertion of mind amongſt them, if the young men are by; for a man who has a character does not chooſe to ſtake it in their preſence."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, may there not be very good converſation without a conteſt for ſuperiority?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No animated converſation, Sir, for it cannot be but one or other will come off ſuperiour. I do not mean that the victor muſt have the better of the argument, for he may take the weak ſide; but his ſuperiority of parts and knowledge will neceſſarily appear: and he to whom he thus ſhews himſelf ſuperiour is leſſened in the eyes of the young men. You know it was ſaid, <hi>'Mallem cum Scaligero errare quem cum Clavio rectè ſapere.'</hi> In the ſame manner take Bentley's and Jaſon de Neres' Comments upon Horace, you will admire Bentley more when wrong, than Jaſon when right."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We walked with Dr. Adams into the maſter's garden, and into the common room. JOHNSON. (after a reverie of meditation,) <q rend="inline">"Aye! Here I uſed to play at drafts with Phil. Jones and Fludyer. Jones loved beer, and did not get very forward in the church. Fludyer turned out a ſcoundrel, a Whig, and ſaid he was aſhamed of having been bred at Oxford. He had a living at Putney, and got under the eye of ſome retainers to the court at that time, and ſo became a violent Whig: but he had been a ſcoundrel all along, to be ſure."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Was he a ſcoundrel, Sir, in any other way than being a political ſcoundrel? Did he cheat at drafts?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, we never played for <hi>money.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>He then carried me to viſit Dr. Bentham, Canon of Chriſt-Church, and Divinity Profeſſor, with whoſe learned and lively converſation we were much pleaſed. He gave us an invitation to dinner, which Dr. Johnſon told me was a high honour. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is a great thing to dine with the Canons of Chriſt-Church."</q> We could not accept his invitation, as we were engaged to dine at Univerſity College. We had an excellent dinner there, with the Maſter and Fellows, it being St. Cuthbert's day, which is kept by them as a feſtival, as he was a ſaint of Durham, with which this College is much connected.</p>
               <p>We drank tea with Dr. Horne, Preſident of Magdalen College, now Biſhop of Norwich, of whoſe abilities, in different reſpects, the publick has had
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0548300102:27"/>
 eminent proofs, and the eſteem annexed to whoſe character was increaſed by knowing him perſonally. He had talked of publiſhing an edition of Walton's Lives, but had laid aſide that deſign, upon Dr. Johnſon's telling him, from miſtake, that Lord Hailes intended to do it. I had wiſhed to negociate between Lord Hailes and him, that one or other ſhould perform ſo good a work. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"In order to do it well, it will be neceſſary to collect all the editions of Walton's Lives. By way of adapting the book to the taſte of the preſent age, they have, in a later edition, left out a viſion which he relates Dr. Donne had, but it ſhould be reſtored; and there ſhould be a critical catalogue given of the works of the different perſons whoſe lives were written by Walton, and therefore their works muſt be carefully read by the editor."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We then went to Trinity College, where he introduced me to Mr. Thomas Warton, with whom we paſſed a part of the evening. We talked of biography.—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is rarely well executed. They only who live with a man can write his life with any genuine exactneſs and diſcrimination; and few people who have lived with a man know what to remark about him. The chaplain of a late Biſhop, whom I was to aſſiſt in writing ſome memoirs of his Lordſhip, could tell me almoſt nothing."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaid, Mr. Robert Dodſley's life ſhould be written, as he had been ſo much connected with the wits of his time, and by his literary merit had raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the ſtation of a footman. Mr. Warton ſaid, he had publiſhed a little volume under the title of <q rend="inline">"The Muſe in Livery."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I doubt whether Dodſley's brother would thank a man who ſhould write his life: yet Dodſley himſelf was not unwilling that his original low condition ſhould be recollected. When Lord Lyttelton's 'Dialogues of the Dead' came out, one of which is between Apicius, an ancient epicure, and Darteneuf, a modern epicure, Dodſley ſaid to me, 'I knew Darteneuf well, for I was once his footman."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Biography led us to ſpeak of Dr. John Campbell, who had written a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able part of the <q rend="inline">"Biographia Britannica."</q> Johnſon, though he valued him highly, was of opinion that there was not ſo much in his great work, <q rend="inline">"A Political Survey of Great-Britain,"</q> as the world had been taught to expect; and had ſaid to me, that he believed Campbell's diſappointment, on account of the bad ſucceſs of that work, had killed him. He this evening obſerved of it, <q rend="inline">"That work was his death."</q> Mr. Warton, not adverting to his meaning, anſwered, <q rend="inline">"I believe ſo; from the great attention he beſtowed on it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, he died of <hi>want</hi> of attention, if he died at all by that book."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:0548300102:28" rendition="simple:additions"/>
We talked of a work much in vogue at that time, written in a very melliflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous  ſtyle, but which, under pretext of another ſubject, contained much artful infidelity. I ſaid it was not fair to attack us thus unexpectedly; he ſhould have warned us of our danger, before we entered his garden of flowery eloquence, by advertiſing, <q rend="inline">"Spring-guns and man-traps ſet here."</q> The authour had been an Oxonian, and was remembered there for having <q rend="inline">"turned Papiſt."</q> I obſerved, that as he had changed ſeveral times—from the Church of England to the Church of Rome—from the Church of Rome to infidelity—I did not deſpair yet of ſeeing him a methodiſt preacher. JOHNSON. (laughing,) <q rend="inline">"It is ſaid, that his range has been more extenſive, and that he has once been Mahometan. However, now that he has publiſhed his infidelity, he will probably perſiſt in it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I am not quite ſure of that, Sir."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned Sir Richard Steele having publiſhed his <q rend="inline">"Chriſtian Hero,"</q> with the avowed purpoſe of obliging himſelf to lead a religious life; yet, that his conduct was by no means ſtrictly ſuitable. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Steele, I believe, practiſed the lighter vices."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Warton, being engaged, could not ſup with us at our inn; we had therefore another evening by ourſelves. I aſked Johnſon, whether a man's being forward in making himſelf known to eminent people, and ſeeing as much of life, and getting as much information as he could in every way, was not yet leſſening himſelf by his forwardneſs. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; a man always makes himſelf greater, as he increaſes his knowledge."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I cenſured ſome ludicrous fantaſtick dialogues between two coach-horſes, and other ſuch ſtuff, which Baretti had lately publiſhed. He joined with me, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Nothing odd will do long. 'Triſtram Shandy' did not laſt."</q> I expreſſed a deſire to be acquainted with a lady who had been much talked of, and univerſally celebrated for extraordinary addreſs and inſinuation. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Never believe extraordinary characters which you hear of people. Depend upon it, Sir, they are exaggerated. You do not ſee one man ſhoot a great deal higher than another."</q> I mentioned Mr. Burke. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes; Burke <hi>is</hi> an extraordinary man. His ſtream of mind is perpetual."</q> It is very pleaſing to me to record, that Johnſon's high eſtimation of the talents of this gentleman was uniform from their early acquaintance. Sir Joſhua Reynolds informs me, that when Mr. Burke was firſt elected a member of parliament, and Sir John Hawkins expreſſed a wonder at his attaining a ſeat, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Now we who know Burke, know, that he will be one of the firſt men in this country."</q> And once, when Johnſon was ill, and unable to exert himſelf as
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0548300102:29"/>
 much as uſual without fatigue, Mr. Burke having been mentioned, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"That fellow calls forth all my powers. Were I to ſee Burke now, it would kill me."</q> So much was he accuſtomed to conſider converſation as a conteſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſuch was his notion of Burke as an opponent.</p>
               <p>Next morning, Thurſday, March 21, we ſet out in a poſt-chaiſe to purſue our ramble. It was a delightful day, and we drove through Blenheim Park. When I looked at the magnificent bridge built by John Duke of Marlborough, over a ſmall rivulet, and recollected the Epigram made upon it—
<q>
                     <l>"The lofty arch his high ambition ſhows,</l>
                     <l>"The ſtream, an emblem of his bounty flows."</l>
                  </q>
and ſaw that now, by the genius of Brown, a magnificent body of water was collected, I ſaid, <q rend="inline">"They have <hi>drowned</hi> the Epigram."</q> I obſerved to him, while in the midſt of the noble ſcene around us, <q rend="inline">"You and I, Sir, have, I think, ſeen together the extremes of what can be ſeen in Britain;—the wild rough iſland of Mull, and Blenheim Park."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We dined at an excellent inn at Chapel-houſe, where he expatiated on the felicity of England in its taverns and inns, and triumphed over the French for not having, in any perfection, the tavern life. <q rend="inline">"There is no private houſe (ſaid he,) in which people can enjoy themſelves ſo well, as at a capital tavern. Let there be ever ſo great plenty of good things, ever ſo much grandeur, ever ſo much elegance, ever ſo much deſire that every body ſhould be eaſy; in the nature of things it cannot be: there muſt always be ſome degree of care and anxiety. The maſter of the houſe is anxious to entertain his gueſts; the gueſts are anxious to be agreeable to him: and no man, but a very impudent dog indeed, can as freely command what is in another man's houſe, as if it were his own. Whereas, at a tavern, there is a general freedom from anxiety. You are ſure you are welcome: and the more noiſe you make, the more trouble you give, the more good things you call for, the welcomer you are. No ſervants will attend you with the alacrity which waiters do, who are incited by the proſpect of an immediate reward, in proportion as they pleaſe. No, Sir; there is nothing which has yet been contrived by man, by which ſo much happineſs is produced as by a good tavern or inn."</q> He then repeated, with great emotion, Shenſtone's lines:</p>
               <q>

               <p>In the afternoon, as we were driven rapidly along in the poſt-chaiſe, he ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"Life has not many things better than this."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We ſtopped at Stratford-upon-Avon, and drank tea and coffee; and it pleaſed me to be with him upon the claſſick ground of Shakſpeare's native place.</p>
               <p>He ſpoke ſlightingly of Dyer's <q rend="inline">"Fleece."</q>—<q rend="inline">"The ſubject, Sir, cannot be made poetical. How can a man write poetically of ſerges and druggets? Yet you will hear many people talk to you gravely of that <hi>excellent</hi> poem, THE FLEECE."</q> Having talked of Dr. Grainger's <q rend="inline">"Sugar-Cane,"</q> I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to him Mr. Langton's having told me, that this poem, when read in manuſcript at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's, had made all the aſſembled wits burſt into a laugh, when, after much blank-verſe pomp, the poet began a new paragraph thus:
<q>
                     <l>"Now, Muſe, let's ſing of <hi>rats."</hi>
                     </l>
                  </q>
And what increaſed the ridicule was, that one of the company, who ſlily over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked the reader, perceived that the word had been originally <hi>mice,</hi> and had been altered to <hi>rats,</hi> as more dignified <note n="2" place="bottom">
                     <p>Such is this little laughable incident, which has been often related. Dr. Percy, the Biſhop of Dromore, who was an intimate friend of Dr. Grainger, and has a particular regard for his memory, has communicated to me the following explanation:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="inline">"The paſſage in queſtion was originally not liable to ſuch a perverſion; for the authour having occaſion in that part of his work to mention the havock made by rats and mice, had introduced the ſubject in a kind of mock heroick, and a parody of Homer's battle of the frogs and mice, invoking the Muſe of the old Grecian bard in an elegant and well-turned manner. In that ſtate I had ſeen it; but afterwards, unknown to me and other friends, he had been perſuaded, contrary to his own better judgement, to alter it, ſo as to produce the unlucky effect above mentioned."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Biſhop gives this character of Dr. Grainger:—<q rend="inline">"He was not only a man of genius and learning, but had many excellent virtues; being one of the moſt generous, friendly, and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent men I ever knew."</q>
                     </p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>Johnſon ſaid, that Dr. Grainger was an agreeable man; a man who would do any good that was in his power. His tranſlation of Tibullus, he thought, was very well done; but <q rend="inline">"The Sugar-Cane, a Poem,"</q> did not pleaſe him;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0548300102:31" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 for, he exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"What could he make of a ſugar-cane? One might as well write, 'The Parſley-Bed, a Poem;' or, 'The Cabbage-Garden, a Poem."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"You muſt then <hi>pickle</hi> your cabbage with the <hi>ſal atticum.</hi>"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You know there is already 'The Hop-Garden, a Poem:' and, I think, one could ſay a great deal about cabbage. The poem might begin with the advantages of civiliſed ſociety over a rude ſtate, exemplified by the Scotch, who had no cabbages till Oliver Cromwell's ſoldiers introduced them; and one might thus ſhew how arts are propagated by conqueſt, as they were by the Roman arms."</q> He ſeemed to be much diverted with the fertility of his own fancy.</p>
               <p>I told him, that I heard Dr. Percy was writing the hiſtory of the wolf in Great-Britain. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"The wolf, Sir! why the wolf? Why does he not write of the bear, which we had formerly? Nay, it is ſaid we had the beaver. Or why does he not write of the grey rat, the Hanover rat, as it is called, becauſe it is ſaid to have come into this country about the time that the family of Hanover came? I ſhould like to ſee <hi>'The Hiſtory of the Grey Rat, by Thomas Percy, D. D. Chaplain in Ordinary to his Majeſty,</hi>"</q> (laughing immoderately). BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I am afraid a court chaplain could not decently write of the grey rat."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, he need not give it the name of the Hanover rat."</q> Thus could he indulge a luxuriant ſportive imagination, when talking of a friend whom he loved and eſteemed.</p>
               <p>He mentioned to me the ſingular hiſtory of an ingenious acquaintance. <q rend="inline">"He ſettled as a phyſician in one of the Leeward Iſlands. A man was ſent out to him merely to compound his medicines. This fellow ſet up as a rival to him in his practice of phyſick, and got ſo much the better of him in the opinion of the people of the iſland, that he carried away all the buſineſs; upon which he returned to England, and ſoon after died."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Friday, March 22, having ſet out early from Henley, where we had lain the preceding night, we arrived at Birmingham about nine o'clock, and, after breakfaſt, went to call on his old ſchoolfellow Mr. Hector. A very ſtupid maid, who opened the door, told us, that <q rend="inline">"her maſter was gone out; he was gone to the country; ſhe could not tell when he would return."</q> In ſhort, ſhe gave us a miſerable reception; and Johnſon obſerved, <q rend="inline">"She would have behaved no better to people who wanted him in the way of his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion."</q> He ſaid to her, <q rend="inline">"My name is Johnſon; tell him I called. Will you remember the name?"</q> She anſwered with ruſtick ſimplicity, in the War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wickſhire pronunciation, <q rend="inline">"I don't underſtand you, Sir."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Blockhead, (ſaid he,) I'll write."</q> I never heard the word <hi>blockhead</hi> applied to a woman before,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0548300102:32"/>
though I do not ſee why it ſhould not, when there is evident occaſion for it.  He, however, made another attempt to make her underſtand him, and roared loud in her ear, <q rend="inline">"JOHNSON,"</q> and then ſhe catched the ſound.</p>
               <p>We then called on Mr. Lloyd, one of the people called Quakers. He too was not at home; but Mrs. Lloyd was, and received us courteouſly, and aſked us to dinner. Johnſon ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"After the uncertainty of all human things at Hector's, this invitation came very well."</q> We walked about the town, and he was pleaſed to ſee it increaſing.</p>
               <p>I talked of legitimation by ſubſequent marriage, which obtained in the Roman law, and ſtill obtains in the law of Scotland. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I think it a bad thing; becauſe the chaſtity of women being of the utmoſt importance, as all property depends upon it, they who forfeit it ſhould not have any poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of being reſtored to good character; nor ſhould the children, by an illicit connection, attain the full rights of lawful children, by the poſteriour conſent of the offending parties."</q> His opinion upon this ſubject deſerves conſideration. Upon his principle there may, at times, be a hardſhip, and ſeemingly a ſtrange one, upon individuals; but the general good of ſociety is better ſecured. And, after all, it is unreaſonable in an individual to repine that he has not the advantage of a ſtate which is made different from his own, by the ſocial inſtitution under which he is born. A woman does not complain that her brother, who is younger than her, gets their common father's eſtate. Why then ſhould a natural ſon complain that a younger brother, by the ſame parents lawfully begotten, gets it? The operation of law is ſimilar in both caſes. Beſides; an illegitimate ſon, who has a younger legitimate brother by the ſame father and mother, has no ſtronger claim to the father's eſtate, than if that legitimate brother had only the ſame father, from whom alone the eſtate deſcends.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lloyd joined us in the ſtreet; and in a little while we met <hi>Friend Hector,</hi> as Mr. Lloyd called him. It gave me pleaſure to obſerve the joy which Johnſon and he expreſſed on ſeeing each other again. Mr. Lloyd and I left them together, while he obligingly ſhewed me ſome of the manufactures of this very curious aſſemblage of artificers. We all met at dinner at Mr. Lloyd's, where we were entertained with great hoſpitality. Mr. and Mrs. Lloyd had been married the ſame year with their Majeſties, and, like them, had been bleſſed with a numerous family of fine children, their numbers being exactly the ſame. Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Marriage is the beſt ſtate for man in general; and every man is a worſe man, in proportion as he is unfit for the married ſtate."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:0548300102:33" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 I have always loved the ſimplicity of manners, and the ſpiritual-mindedneſs of the Quakers; and talking with Mr. Lloyd, I obſerved, that the eſſential part of religion was piety, a devout intercourſe with the Divinity; and that many a man was a Quaker without knowing it.</p>
               <p>As Dr. Johnſon had ſaid to me in the morning, while we walked together, that he liked individuals among the Quakers, but not the ſect; when we were at Mr. Lloyd's I kept clear of introducing any queſtion concerning the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities of their faith. But I having aſked to look at Baſkerville's edition of <q rend="inline">"Barclay's Apology,"</q> Johnſon laid hold of it; and the chapter on baptiſm happening to open, Johnſon remarked, <q rend="inline">"He ſays there is neither precept nor practice for baptiſm, in the ſcriptures; that is falſe."</q> Here he was the aggreſſor, by no means in a gentle manner; and the good Quakers had the advantage of him; for he had read negligently, and had not obſerved that Barclay ſpeaks of <hi>infant</hi> baptiſm, which they calmly made him perceive. Mr. Lloyd, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, was in as great a miſtake; for when inſiſting that the rite of baptiſm with water was to ceaſe, when the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> adminiſtration of CHRIST began, he maintained, that John the Baptiſt ſaid, <q rend="inline">"<hi>My baptiſm</hi> ſhall decreaſe, but <hi>his</hi> ſhall increaſe."</q> Whereas the words are, <q rend="inline">"<hi>He</hi> muſt increaſe, but <hi>I</hi> muſt decreaſe <note n="2" place="bottom">John iii. 30.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>One of them having objected to the <q rend="inline">"obſervance of days, and months, and years,"</q> Johnſon anſwered, <q rend="inline">"The Church does not ſuperſtitiouſly obſerve days, merely as days, but as memorials of important facts. Chriſtmas might be kept as well upon one day of the year as another: but there ſhould be a ſtated day for commemorating the birth of our Saviour, becauſe there is danger that what may be done on any day, will be neglected."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Hector was ſo good as to accompany me to ſee the great works of Mr. Bolton, at a place which he has called Soho, about two miles from Birmingham, which the very ingenious proprietor ſhewed me himſelf to the beſt advantage. I wiſh that Johnſon had been with us; for it was a ſcene which I ſhould have been glad to contemplate by his light. The vaſtneſs and the contrivance of ſome of the machinery would have <q rend="inline">"matched his mighty mind."</q> I ſhall never forget Mr. Bolton's expreſſion to me: <q rend="inline">"I ſell here, Sir, what all the world deſires to have,—Power."</q> He had about ſeven hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred people at work. I contemplated him as an <hi>iron chieftain,</hi> and he ſeemed to be a father to his tribe. One of them came to him, complaining grievouſly of his landlord for having diſtrained his goods. <q rend="inline">"Your landlord is in the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0548300102:34"/>
right, Smith, (ſaid Bolton). But I'll tell you what: find you a friend who  will lay down one half of your rent, and I'll lay down the other half; and you ſhall have your goods again."</q>
               </p>
               <p>From Mr. Hector I now learnt many particulars of Dr. Johnſon's early life, which, with others that he gave me at different times ſince, have contributed to the formation of this work.</p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon ſaid to me in the morning, <q rend="inline">"You will ſee, Sir, at Mr. Hector's, his ſiſter, Mrs. Careleſs, a clergyman's widow. She was the firſt woman with whom I was in love. It dropt out of my head imperceptibly; but ſhe and I ſhall always have a kindneſs for each other."</q> He laughed at the notion that a man never can be really in love but once, and conſidered it as a mere romantick fancy.</p>
               <p>On our return from Mr. Bolton's, Mr. Hector took me to his houſe, where we found Johnſon ſitting placidly at tea, with his <hi>firſt love;</hi> who, though now advanced in years, was a genteel woman, very agreeable, and well-bred.</p>
               <p>Johnſon lamented to Mr. Hector the ſtate of one of their ſchool-fellows, Mr. Charles Congreve, a clergyman, which he thus deſcribed: <q rend="inline">"He obtained, I believe, conſiderable preferment in Ireland, but now lives in London, quite as a valetudinarian, afraid to go into any houſe but his own. He takes a ſhort airing in his poſt-chaiſe every day. He has an elderly woman, whom he calls couſin, who lives with him, and jogs his elbow, when his glaſs has ſtood too long empty, and encourages him in drinking, in which he is very willing to be encouraged; not that he gets drunk, for he is a very pious man, but he is always muddy. He confeſſes to one bottle of port every day, and he probably drinks more. He is quite unſocial; his converſation is mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyllabical: and when, at my laſt viſit, I aſked him what a clock it was, that ſignal of my departure had ſo pleaſing an effect on him, that he ſprung up to look at his watch, like a greyhound bounding at a hare."</q> When Johnſon took leave of Mr. Hector, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Don't grow like Congreve; nor let me grow like him, when you are near me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When he again talked of Mrs. Careleſs to-night, he ſeemed to have had his affection revived; for he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"If I had married her, it might have been as happy for me."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, do you not ſuppoſe that there are fifty women in the world, with any one of whom a man may be as happy, as with any one woman in particular."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Aye, fifty thouſand."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, you are not of opinion with ſome who imagine that certain men and certain women are made for each other; and that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0548300102:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 be happy if they miſs their counterparts."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"To be ſure not, Sir. I believe marriages would in general be as happy, and often more ſo, if they were all made by the Lord Chancellor, upon a due conſideration of characters and circumſtances, without the parties having any choice in the matter."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I wiſhed to have ſtaid at Birmingham to-night, to have talked more with Mr. Hector; but my friend was impatient to reach his native city: ſo we drove on that ſtage in the dark, and were long penſive and ſilent. When we came within the focus of the Lichfield lamps, <q rend="inline">"Now (ſaid he,) we are getting out of a ſtate of death."</q> We put up at the Three Crowns, not one of the great inns, but a good old faſhioned one, which was kept by Mr. Wilkins, and was the very next houſe to that in which Johnſon was born and brought up, and which was ſtill his own property <note n="3" place="bottom">I went through the houſe where my illuſtrious friend was born, with a reverence with which it doubtleſs will long be viſited. An engraved view of it, with the adjacent buildings, is in <q rend="inline">"The Gentleman's Magazine"</q> for February, 1785.</note>. We had a comfortable ſupper, and got into high ſpirits. I felt all my Toryiſm glow in this old capital of Stafford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. I could have offered incenſe <hi>genio loci;</hi> and I indulged in libations of that ale, which Bonniface, in <q rend="inline">"The Beaux Stratagem,"</q> recommends with ſuch an eloquent jollity.</p>
               <p>Next morning he introduced me to Mrs. Lucy Porter, his ſtep-daughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She was now an old maid, with much ſimplicity of manner. She had never been in London. Her brother, a Captain in the navy, had left her a fortune of ten thouſand pounds; about a third of which ſhe had laid out in building a ſtately houſe, and making a handſome garden, in an elevated ſituation in Lichfield. Johnſon, when here by himſelf, uſed to live at her houſe. She reverenced him, and he had a parental tenderneſs for her.</p>
               <p>We then viſited Mr. Peter Garrick, who had that morning received a letter from his brother David, announcing our coming to Lichfield. He was engaged to dinner, but aſked us to tea, and to ſleep at his houſe. Johnſon, however, would not quit his old acquaintance Wilkins, of the Three Crowns. The family likeneſs of the Garricks was very ſtriking; and Johnſon thought that David's vivacity was not ſo peculiar to himſelf as was ſuppoſed. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) I don't know but if Peter had cultivated all the arts of gaiety as much as David has done, he might have been as briſk and lively. Depend upon it, Sir, vivacity is much an art, and depends greatly on habit."</q> I believe there is a good deal of truth in this, notwithſtanding a ludicrous ſtory told me by a lady abroad, of a heavy German baron, who had lived
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0548300102:36" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much with the young Engliſh at Geneva, and was ambitious to be as lively as  they; with which view, he, with aſſiduous exertion, was jumping over the tables and chairs in his lodgings; and when the people of the houſe ran in and aſked, with ſurprize, what was the matter, he anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Sh' apprens t'etre fif."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We dined at our inn, and had with us a Mr. Jackſon, one of Johnſon's ſchoolfellows, whom he treated with much kindneſs, though he ſeemed to be a low man, dull and untaught. He had a coarſe grey coat, black waiſtcoat, greaſy leather breeches, and a yellow uncurled wig; and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance had the ruddineſs which betokens one who is in no haſte to <q rend="inline">"leave his can."</q> He drank only ale. He had tried to be a cutler at Birmingham, but had not ſucceeded; and now he lived poorly at home, and had ſome ſcheme of dreſſing leather in a better manner than common; to his indiſtinct account of which, Dr. Johnſon liſtened with patient attention, that he might aſſiſt him with his advice. Here was an inſtance of genuine humanity and real kindneſs in this great man, who has been moſt unjuſtly repreſented as altogether harſh and deſtitute of tenderneſs. A thouſand ſuch inſtances might have been recorded in the courſe of his long life; though, that his temper was warm and haſty, and his manner often rough, cannot be denied.</p>
               <p>I ſaw here, for the firſt time, <hi>oat ale;</hi> and oat cakes not hard as in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but ſoft like a Yorkſhire cake, were ſerved at breakfaſt. It was pleaſant to me to find, that <q rend="inline">"Oats,"</q> the <q rend="inline">"food of horſes,"</q> were ſo much uſed as the <hi>food of the people</hi> in Dr. Johnſon's own town. He expatiated in praiſe of Lich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field and its inhabitants, who, he ſaid, were <q rend="inline">"the moſt ſober, decent people in England, the genteeleſt in proportion to their wealth, and ſpoke the pureſt Engliſh."</q> I doubted as to the laſt article of this eulogy; for they had ſeveral provincial ſounds; as, <hi>there,</hi> pronounced like <hi>fear,</hi> inſtead of like <hi>fair; once,</hi> pronounced <hi>woonſe,</hi> inſtead of <hi>wunſe,</hi> or <hi>wonſe.</hi> Johnſon himſelf never got entirely free of his provincial accent. Garrick ſometimes uſed to take him off, ſqueezing a lemon into a punch-bowl, with uncouth geſticulations, looking round the company, and calling out, <q rend="inline">"Who's for <hi>poonſh?</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Very little buſineſs appeared to be going forward in Lichfield. I found however two ſtrange manufactures for ſo inland a place, ſail-cloth and ſtreamers for ſhips; and I obſerved them making ſome ſaddle-cloths, and dreſſing ſheepſkins: but upon the whole, the buſy hand of induſtry ſeemed to be quite ſlackened. <q rend="inline">"Surely, Sir, (ſaid I,) you are an idle ſet of people."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) we are a city of philoſophers: we work with our heads, and make the boobies of Birmingham work for us with their hands."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0548300102:37" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 There was at this time a company of players performing at Lichfield. The manager, Mr. Stanton, ſent his compliments, and requeſted leave to wait on Dr. Johnſon. Johnſon received him very courteouſly, and he drank a glaſs of wine with us. He was a plain decent well-behaved man, and expreſſed his gratitude to Dr. Johnſon for having once got him permiſſion from Dr. Taylor at Aſhbourne to play there upon moderate terms. Garrick's name was ſoon introduced. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Garrick's converſation is gay and groteſque. It is a diſh of all ſorts, but all good things. There is no ſolid meat in it: there is a want of ſentiment in it. Not but that he has ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſometimes, and ſentiment too very powerful and very pleaſing: but it has not its full proportion in his converſation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When we were by ourſelves he told me, <q rend="inline">"Forty years ago, Sir, I was in love with an actreſs here, Mrs. Emmet, who acted Flora, in 'Hob in the Well."</q> What merit this lady had as an actreſs, or what was her figure, or her manner, I have not been informed: but, if we may believe Mr. Garrick, his old maſter's taſte in theatrical merit was by no means refined; he was not an <hi>elegans formarum ſpectator.</hi> Garrick uſed to tell, that Johnſon ſaid of an actor, who played Sir Harry Wildair at Lichfield, <q rend="inline">"There is a courtly vivacity about the fellow;"</q> when in fact, according to Garrick's account, <q rend="inline">"he was the moſt vulgar ruffian that ever went upon boards."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We had promiſed Mr. Stanton to be at his theatre on Monday. Dr. Johnſon jocularly propoſed me to write a Prologue for the occaſion: <q rend="inline">"A Prologue, by James Boſwell, Eſq. from the Hebrides."</q> I was really inclined to take the hint. Methought, <q rend="inline">"Prologue, ſpoken before Dr. Samuel Johnſon, at Lichfield, 1776;"</q> would have ſounded as well as, <q rend="inline">"Prologue, ſpoken before the Duke of York, at Oxford,"</q> in Charles the Second's time. Much might have been ſaid of what Lichfield had done for Shakſpeare, by producing Johnſon and Garrick. But I found he was averſe to it.</p>
               <p>We went and viewed the muſeum of Mr. Richard Green, apothecary here, who told me he was proud of being a relation of Dr. Johnſon's. It was, truly, a wonderful collection, both of antiquities and natural curioſities, and ingenious works of art. He had all the articles accurately arranged, with their names upon labels, printed at his own little preſs; and on the ſtaircaſe leading to it was a board, with the names of contributors marked in gold letters. A printed catalogue of the collection was to be had at a book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller's. Johnſon expreſſed his admiration of the activity and diligence and good fortune of Mr. Green, in getting together, in his ſituation, ſo great a variety of things; and Mr. Green told me, that Johnſon once ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"Sir,
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0548300102:38" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I ſhould as ſoon have thought of building a man of war, as of collecting  ſuch a muſeum."</q> Mr. Green's obliging alacrity in ſhewing it was very pleaſing. His engraved portrait, with which he has favoured me, has a motto truly characteriſtical of his diſpoſition, <q rend="inline">"Nemo ſibi vivat."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A phyſician being mentioned who had loſt his practice, becauſe his whimſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally changing his religion had made people diſtruſtful of him, I maintained that this was unreaſonable, as religion is unconnected with medical ſkill. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is not unreaſonable; for when people ſee a man abſurd in what they underſtand, they may conclude the ſame of him in what they do not underſtand. If a phyſician were to take to eating of horſe-fleſh, nobody would employ him; though one may eat horſe-fleſh, and be a very ſkilful phyſician. If a man were educated in an abſurd religion, his continuing to profeſs it would not hurt him, though his changing to it would."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We drank tea and coffee at Mr. Peter Garrick's, where was Mrs. Aſton, one of the maiden ſiſters of Mrs. Walmſley, wife of Johnſon's firſt friend, and ſiſter alſo of the lady of whom Johnſon uſed to ſpeak with the warmeſt admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, by the name of Molly Aſton, who was afterwards married to Captain Brodie of the navy.</p>
               <p>On Sunday, March 24, we breakfaſted with Mrs. Cobb, a widow lady, who lived in an agreeable ſequeſtered place cloſe by the town, called the Friary, it having been formerly a religious houſe. She and her niece, Miſs Adey, were great admirers of Dr. Johnſon; and he behaved to them with a kindneſs and eaſy pleaſantry, ſuch as we ſee between old and intimate acquaintance. He accompanied Mrs. Cobb to St. Mary's church, and I went to the cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral, where I was very much delighted with the muſick, finding it to be peculiarly ſolemn, and accordant with the words of the ſervice.</p>
               <p>We dined at Mr. Peter Garrick's, who was in a very lively humour, and verified Johnſon's ſaying, that if he had cultivated gaiety as much as his brother David, he might have equally excelled in it. He was to-day quite a London narrator, telling us a variety of anecdotes with that earneſtneſs and attempt at mimickry which we uſually find in the wits of the metropolis. Dr. Johnſon went with me to the cathedral in the afternoon. It was grand and pleaſing to contemplate this illuſtrious writer, now full of fame, worſhipping in <q rend="inline">"the ſolemn temple"</q> of his native city.</p>
               <p>I returned to tea and coffee at Mr. Peter Garrick's, and then found Dr. Johnſon at the Reverend Mr. Seward's, Canon Reſidentiary, who inhabited the Biſhop's palace, in which Mr. Walmſley lived, and which had been the ſcene of many happy hours in Johnſon's early life. Mr. Seward had, with
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0548300102:39" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 eccleſiaſtical hoſpitality and politeneſs, aſked me in the morning, merely as a ſtranger, to dine with him; and in the afternoon, when I was introduced to him, he aſked Dr. Johnſon and me to ſpend the evening and ſup with him. He was a genteel well-bred dignified clergyman, had travelled with Lord Charles Fitzroy, uncle of the preſent Duke of Grafton, who died when abroad, and he had lived much in the great world. He was an ingenious and literary man, had publiſhed an edition of Beaumont and Fletcher, and written verſes in Dodſley's collection. His lady was the daughter of Mr. Hunter, Johnſon's firſt ſchoolmaſter. And now, for the firſt time, I had the pleaſure of ſeeing his celebrated daughter, Miſs Anna Seward, to whom I have ſince been indebted for many civilities, as well as ſome obliging communications con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Johnſon.</p>
               <p>Mr. Seward mentioned to us the obſervations which he had made upon the ſtrata of earth in volcanos, from which it appeared, that they were ſo very different in depth in different periods, that no calculation whatever could be made as to the time required for their formation. This fully refuted an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſaical remark introduced into Captain Brydone's entertaining Tour, I hope heedleſsly, from a kind of vanity which is too common in thoſe who have not ſufficiently ſtudied the moſt important of all ſubjects. Dr. Johnſon, indeed, had ſaid before, independent of this obſervation, <q rend="inline">"Shall all the accumulated evidence of the hiſtory of the world;—ſhall the authority of what is unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionably the moſt ancient writing, be overturned by an uncertain remark ſuch as this?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Monday, March 25, we breakfaſted at Mrs. Lucy Porter's. He had ſent an expreſs to Dr. Taylor's, acquainting him of our being at Lichfield, and Taylor had returned an anſwer that his poſt-chaiſe ſhould come for us this day. While we ſat at breakfaſt, Dr. Johnſon received a letter by the poſt, which ſeemed to agitate him very much. When he had read it, he exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"One of the moſt dreadful things that has happened in my time."</q> The phraſe <hi>my time,</hi> like the word <hi>age,</hi> is uſually underſtood to refer to an event of a publick or general nature. I imagined ſomething like an aſſaſſination of the King—like a gunpowder plot carried into execution—or like another fire of London. When aſked, <q rend="inline">"What is it, Sir?"</q> he anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Mr. Thrale has loſt his only ſon!"</q> This was, no doubt, a very great affliction to Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, which their friends would conſider accordingly; but from the manner in which the intelligence of it was communicated by Johnſon, it appeared for the moment to be comparatively ſmall. I however, ſoon felt a ſincere concern, and was curious to obſerve how Dr. Johnſon would
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0548300102:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
be affected. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"This is a total extinction to their family, as much as  if they were ſold into captivity."</q> Upon my mentioning that Mr. Thrale had daughters, who might inherit his wealth;—<q rend="inline">"Daughters, (ſaid Johnſon, warmly,) he'll no more value his daughters than—"</q> I was going to ſpeak.—<q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) don't you know how you yourſelf think? Sir, he wiſhes to propagate his name."</q> In ſhort, I ſaw male ſucceſſion ſtrong in his mind, even where there was no name, no family of any long ſtanding. I ſaid, it was lucky he was not preſent when this misfortune happened. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is lucky for <hi>me.</hi> People in diſtreſs never think that you feel enough."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"And, Sir, they will have the hope of ſeeing you, which will be a relief in the mean time; and when you get to them, the pain will be ſo far abated, that they will be capable of being conſoled by you, which, in the firſt violence of it, I believe, would not be the caſe."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; violent pain of mind, as violent pain of body, <hi>muſt</hi> be ſeverely felt."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I own, Sir, I have not ſo much feeling for the diſtreſs of others, as ſome people have, or pretend to have: but I know this, that I would do all in my power to relieve them."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is affectation to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to feel the diſtreſs of others, as much as they do themſelves. It is equally ſo, as if one ſhould pretend to feel as much pain while a friend's leg is cutting off, as he does. No, Sir; you have expreſſed the rational and juſt nature of ſympathy. I would have gone to the extremity of the earth to have preſerved this boy."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He was ſoon quite calm. The letter was from Mr. Thrale's clerk, and concluded, <q rend="inline">"I need not ſay how much they wiſh to ſee you in London."</q> He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"We ſhall haſten back from Taylor's."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Lucy Porter and ſome other ladies of the place talked a great deal of him when he was out of the room, not only with veneration but affection. It pleaſed me to find that he was ſo much <hi>beloved</hi> in his native city.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Aſton, whom I had ſeen the preceding night, and her ſiſter, Mrs. Gaſtrel, a widow lady, had each a houſe and garden, and pleaſure ground, prettily ſituated upon Stowhill, a gentle eminence adjoining to Lichfield. Johnſon walked away to dinner there, leaving me by myſelf without any apology; I wondered at this want of that facility of manners, from which a man has no difficulty in carrying a friend to a houſe where he is intimate; I felt it very unpleaſant to be thus left in ſolitude in a country town, where I was an entire ſtranger, and began to think myſelf unkindly deſerted; but I was ſoon relieved, and convinced that my friend inſtead of being deficient in delicacy, had conducted the matter with perfect propriety, for I received the following
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0548300102:41"/>
 note in his hand-writing: <q rend="inline">"Mrs. Gaſtrel, at the lower houſe on Stowhill, deſires Mr. Boſwell's company to dinner at two."</q> I accepted of the invitation, and had here another proof how amiable his character was in the opinion of thoſe who knew him beſt. I was not informed, till afterwards, that Mrs. Gaſtrel's huſband was the clergyman who, while he lived at Stratford upon Avon, where he was proprietor of Shakſpeare's garden, with Gothick barbarity cut down his mulberry-tree, and, as Dr. Johnſon told me, did it to vex his neighbours. His lady, I have reaſon to believe, participated in the guilt of what the enthuſiaſts for our immortal bard deem almoſt a ſpecies of ſacrilege.</p>
               <p>After dinner Dr. Johnſon wrote a letter to Mrs. Thrale, on the death of her ſon. I ſaid it would be very diſtreſſing to Thrale, but ſhe would ſoon forget it, as ſhe had ſo many things to think of. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, Thrale will forget it firſt. <hi>She</hi> has many things that ſhe <hi>may</hi> think of. <hi>He</hi> has many things that he <hi>muſt</hi> think of."</q> This was a very juſt remark upon the different effect of thoſe light purſuits which occupy a vacant and eaſy mind, and thoſe ſerious engagements which arreſt attention, and keep us from brooding over grief.</p>
               <p>He obſerved of Lord Bute, <q rend="inline">"It was ſaid of Auguſtus, that it would have been better for Rome that he had never been born, or had never died. So it would have been better for this nation if Lord Bute had never been miniſter, or had never reſigned."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the evening we went to the Town-hall, which was converted into a temporary theatre, and ſaw <q rend="inline">"Theodoſius,"</q> with <q rend="inline">"The Stratford Jubilee."</q> I was happy to ſee Dr. Johnſon ſitting in a conſpicuous part of the pit, and receiving affectionate homage from all his acquaintance. We were quite gay and merry. I afterwards mentioned to him that I condemned myſelf for being ſo, when poor Mr. and Mrs. Thrale were in ſuch diſtreſs. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You are wrong, Sir; twenty years hence Mr. and Mrs. Thrale will not ſuffer much pain from the death of their ſon. Now, Sir, you are to conſider that diſtance of place, as well as diſtance of time, operates upon the human feelings. I would not have you be gay in the preſence of the diſtreſſed, becauſe it would ſhock them; but you may be gay at a diſtance. Pain for the loſs of a friend, or of a relation whom we love, is occaſioned by the want which we feel. In time the vacuity is filled with ſomething elſe; or, ſometimes the vacuity cloſes up of itſelf."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Seward and Mr. Pearſon, another clergyman here, ſupt with us at our inn, and after they left us, we ſat up late as we uſed to do in London.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0548300102:42" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Here I ſhall record ſome fragments of my friend's converſation during this  jaunt.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Marriage, Sir, is much more neceſſary to a man than to a woman; for he is much leſs able to ſupply himſelf with domeſtick comforts. You will recollect my ſaying to ſome ladies the other day, that I had often wondered why young women ſhould marry, as they have ſo much more freedom, and ſo much more attention paid to them while unmarried, than when married. I indeed did not mention the <hi>ſtrong</hi> reaſon for their marrying—the <hi>mechanical</hi> reaſon."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Why that <hi>is</hi> a ſtrong one. But does not imagination make it ſeem much more important than it is in reality? Is it not, to a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain degree, a deluſion in us as well as in women?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir; but it is a deluſion that is always beginning again."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I don't know but there is upon the whole more miſery than happineſs produced by that paſſion."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I don't think ſo, Sir."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Never ſpeak of a man in his own preſence. It is always indelicate, and may be offenſive."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Queſtioning is not the mode of converſation among gentlemen. It is aſſuming a ſuperiority, and it is particularly wrong to queſtion a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf. There may be parts of his former life which he may not wiſh to be made known to other perſons, or even brought to his own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"A man ſhould be careful never to tell tales of himſelf to his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage. People may be amuſed and laugh at the time, but they will be remembered, and brought out againſt him upon ſome ſubſequent occaſion."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Much may be done if a man puts his whole mind to a particular object. By doing ſo, Norton has made himſelf the great lawyer that he is allowed to be."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned an acquaintance of mine, a ſectary, who was a very religious man, who not only attended regularly on publick worſhip with thoſe of his communion, but made a particular ſtudy of the Scriptures, and even wrote a commentary on ſome parts of them, yet was known to be very licentious in indulging himſelf with women, maintaining that men are to be ſaved by faith alone, and that the Chriſtian religion had not preſcribed any fixed rule for the intercourſe between the ſexes. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, there is no truſting to that crazy piety."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I Obſerved that it was ſtrange how well Scotchmen were known to one another in their own country, though born in very diſtant counties; for we do not find that the gentlemen of neighbouring counties in England are
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0548300102:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 mutually known to each other. Johnſon, with his uſual acuteneſs, at once ſaw and explained the reaſon of this, <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, you have Edinburgh, where the gentlemen from all your counties meet, and which is not ſo large but that they are all known. There is no ſuch common place of collection in England, except London, where from its great ſize and diffuſion, many of thoſe who reſide in contiguous counties of England may long remain unknown to each other."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Tueſday, March 26, there came for us an equipage properly ſuited to a wealthy well-beneficed clergyman—Dr. Taylor's large, roomy poſt-chaiſe, drawn by four ſtout plump horſes, and driven by two ſteady jolly poſtillions, which conveyed us to Aſhbourne, where I found my friend's ſchoolfellow living upon an eſtabliſhment perfectly correſponding with his ſubſtantial creditable equipage. His houſe, garden, pleaſure-grounds, table, in ſhort every thing good, and no ſcantineſs appearing. Every man ſhould form ſuch a plan of living as he can execute completely. Let him not draw an outline wider than he can fill up. I have ſeen many ſkeletons of ſhew and magnificence which excite at once ridicule and pity. Dr. Taylor had a good eſtate of his own, and good preferment in the church, being a prebendary of Weſtminſter, and rector of Boſworth. He was a diligent juſtice of the peace, and preſided over the town of Aſhbourne, to the inhabitants of which I was told he was very liberal; and as a proof of this it was mentioned to me, he had the preceding winter, diſtributed two hundred pounds among ſuch of them as ſtood in need of his aſſiſtance. He had conſequently a conſiderable political intereſt in the county of Derby, which he employed to ſupport the Devonſhire family; for though the ſchoolfellow and friend of Johnſon, he was a Whig. I could not perceive in his character much congeniality of any ſort with that of Johnſon, who, however, ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"Sir, he has a very ſtrong under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding."</q> His ſize and figure, and countenance, and manner, were that of a hearty Engliſh 'Squire, with the parſon ſuper-induced; and I took particular notice of his upper ſervant, Mr. Peters, a decent grave man, in purple clothes, and a large white wig, like the butler or <hi>major domo</hi> of a Biſhop.</p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon and Dr. Taylor met with great cordiality; and Johnſon ſoon gave him the ſame ſad account of their ſchoolfellow, Congreve, that he had given to Mr. Hector; adding a remark of ſuch moment to the rational conduct of a man in the decline of life, that it deſerves to be imprinted upon every mind: <q rend="inline">"There is nothing againſt which an old man ſhould be ſo much upon his guard as putting himſelf to nurſe."</q> Innumerable have been the melancholy inſtances of men once diſtinguiſhed for firmneſs, reſolution,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0548300102:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and ſpirit, who in their latter days have been governed like children, by inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted  female artifice.</p>
               <p>Dr. Taylor commended a phyſician who was known to him and Dr. Johnſon, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I fight many battles for him, as many people in the country diſlike him."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But you ſhould conſider, Sir, that by every one of your victories he is a loſer; for, every man of whom you get the better, will be very angry, and will reſolve not to employ him; whereas if people get the better of you in argument about him, they'll think, 'We'll ſend for Dr. ****** nevertheleſs."</q> This was an obſervation deep and ſure in human nature.</p>
               <p>Next day we talked of a book in which an eminent judge was arraigned before the bar of the publick, as having pronounced an unjuſt deciſion in a great cauſe. Dr. Johnſon maintained that this publication would not give any uneaſineſs to the Judge. <q rend="inline">"For (ſaid he,) either he acted honeſtly, or he meant to do injuſtice. If he acted honeſtly, his own conſciouſneſs will protect him; if he meant to do injuſtice, he will be glad to ſee the man who attacks him, ſo much vexed."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Next day, as Dr. Johnſon had acquainted Dr. Taylor of the reaſon for his returning ſpeedily to London, it was reſolved that we ſhould ſet out after dinner. A few of Dr. Taylor's neighbours were his gueſts that day.</p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon talked with approbation of one who had attained to the ſtate of the philoſophical wiſe man, that is, to have no want of any thing. <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, (ſaid I,) the ſavage is a wiſe man."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) I do not mean ſimply being without,—but not having a want."</q> I maintained, againſt this propoſition, that it was better to have fine clothes, for inſtance, than not to feel the want of them." JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; fine clothes are good only as they ſupply the want of other means of procuring reſpect. Was Charles the Twelfth, think you, leſs reſpected for his coarſe blue coat and black ſtock? And you find the King of Pruſſia dreſſes plain, becauſe the dignity of his character is ſufficient."</q> I here brought myſelf into a ſcrape, for I heedleſsly ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Would not <hi>you,</hi> Sir, be the better for velvet and embroidery?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you put an end to all argument when you introduce your opponent himſelf. Have you no better manners? There is <hi>your want.</hi>"</q> I apologiſed by ſaying, I had mentioned him as an inſtance of one who wanted as little as any man in the world, and yet, perhaps, might receive ſome additional luſtre from dreſs.</p>
               <p>Having left Aſhbourne in the evening, we ſtopped to change horſes at Derby, and availed ourſelves of a moment to enjoy the converſation of my
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0548300102:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 countryman, Dr. Butter, then phyſician there. He was in great indignation becauſe Lord Mountſtuart's bill for a Scotch militia had been loſt. Dr. Johnſon was as violent againſt it. <q rend="inline">"I am glad, (ſaid he,) that Parliament has had the ſpirit to throw it out. You wanted to take advantage of the timidity of our ſcoundrels <note n="4" place="bottom">See page 17.</note>,"</q> (meaning, I ſuppoſe, the miniſtry). It may be obſerved, that he uſed the epithet ſcoundrel very commonly, not quite in the ſenſe in which it is generally underſtood, but as a ſtrong term of diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation; as when he abruptly anſwered Mrs. Thrale, who had aſked him how he did, <q rend="inline">"Ready to become a ſcoundrel, Madam; with a little more ſpoiling you will, I think, make me a complete raſcal <note n="5" place="bottom">Anecdotes of Johnſon, p. 176.</note>:"</q>—he meant, eaſy to become a capricious and ſelf-indulgent valetudinarian; a character for which I have heard him expreſs great diſguſt.</p>
               <p>Johnſon had with him upon this jaunt, <q rend="inline">"Il Palermino d'Inghilterra,"</q> a romance praiſed by Cervantes; but did not like it much. He ſaid, he read it for the language, by way of preparation for his Italian expedition.—We lay this night at Loughborough.</p>
               <p>On Thurſday, March 28, we purſued our journey. I mentioned that old Mr. Sheridan complained of the ingratitude of Mr. Wedderburne and General Fraſer, who had been much obliged to him when they were young Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men entering upon life in England. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, a man is very apt to complain of the ingratitude of thoſe who have riſen far above him. A man when he gets into a higher ſphere, into other habits of life, cannot keep up all his former connections. Then, Sir, thoſe who knew him formerly upon a level with themſelves, may think that they ought ſtill to be treated as on a level, which cannot be; and an acquaintance in a former ſituation may bring out things which it would be very diſagreeable to have mentioned before higher company, though, perhaps, every body knows of them."</q> He placed this ſubject in a new light to me, and ſhewed that a man, who has riſen in the world, muſt not be condemned too harſhly, for being diſtant to former acquaintance, even though he may have been much obliged to them. It is, no doubt, to be wiſhed that a proper degree of attention ſhould be ſhewn by great men to their early friends. But if either from obtuſe inſenſibility to difference of ſituation, or preſumptuous forwardneſs, which will not ſubmit even to an exteriour obſervance of it, the dignity of high place cannot be preſerved, when they are admitted into the company of thoſe raiſed above the ſtate in which they once were, encroachment muſt be repelled, and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0548300102:46" rendition="simple:additions"/>
the kinder feelings ſacrificed. To one of the very fortunate perſons whom  I have mentioned, namely, Mr. Wedderburne, now Lord Loughborough, I muſt do the juſtice to relate, that I have been aſſured by another early acquaintance of his, old Mr. Macklin, who aſſiſted him in improving his pronunciation, that he had found him very grateful. Macklin, I ſuppoſe, had not preſſed upon his elevation with ſo much eagerneſs as the gentleman who complained of him. Dr. Johnſon's remark as to the jealouſy entertained of our friends who riſe far above us, is certainly very juſt. By this was withered the early friendſhip between Charles Townſhend and Akenſide; and many ſimilar inſtances might be adduced.</p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is commonly a weak man who marries for love."</q> We then talked of marrying women of fortune; and I mentioned a common remark, that a man may be, upon the whole, richer by marrying a woman with a very ſmall portion, becauſe a woman of fortune will be proportionally expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; whereas a woman who brings none will be very moderate in expences. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Depend upon it, Sir, this is not true. A woman of fortune being uſed to the handling of money, ſpends it judiciouſly: but a woman who gets the command of money for the firſt time upon her marriage, has ſuch a guſt in ſpending it, that ſhe throws it away with great profuſion."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He praiſed the ladies of the preſent age, inſiſting that they were more faithful to their huſbands, and more virtuous in every reſpect, than in former times, becauſe their underſtandings were better cultivated. It was an undoubted proof of his good ſenſe and good diſpoſition, that he was never querulous, never prone to inveigh againſt the preſent times, as is ſo common when ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial minds are on the fret. On the contrary, he was willing to ſpeak favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably of his own age; and, indeed, maintained its ſuperiority in every reſpect, except in its reverence for government; the relaxation of which he imputed, as its grand cauſe, to the ſhock which our monarchy received at the Revolution, though neceſſary; and ſecondly, to the timid conceſſions made to faction by ſucceſſive adminiſtrations in the reign of his preſent Majeſty. I am happy to think, that he lived to ſee the Crown at laſt recover its juſt influence.</p>
               <p>At Leiceſter we read in the newſpapers that Dr. James was dead. I thought that the death of an old ſchool-fellow, and one with whom he had lived a good deal in London, would have affected my fellow-traveller much: but he only ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Ah! poor Jamy."</q> Afterwards, however, when we were in the chaiſe, he ſaid, with more tenderneſs, <q rend="inline">"Since I ſet out on this jaunt, I have loſt an old friend and a young one;—Dr. James, and poor Harry,"</q> (meaning Mr. Thrale's ſon).</p>
               <p>

 Having lain at St. Alban's on Thurſday, March 28, we breakfaſted the next morning at Barnet. I expreſſed to him a weakneſs of mind which I could not help;—an uneaſy apprehenſion that my wife-and children, who were at a great diſtance from me, might, perhaps, be ill. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) conſider how fooliſh you ſhould think it in <hi>them</hi> to be apprehenſive that <hi>you</hi> are ill."</q> This ſudden turn relieved me for the moment; but I afterwards perceived it to be an ingenious fallacy. I might, to be ſure, be ſatisfied that they had no reaſon to be apprehenſive about me, becauſe I <hi>knew</hi> that I myſelf was well: but we might have a mutual anxiety, without the charge of folly; becauſe each was, in ſome degree, uncertain as to the condition of the other.</p>
               <p>I enjoyed the luxury of our approach to London, that metropolis which we both loved ſo much, for the high and varied intellectual pleaſure which it furniſhes. I experienced immediate happineſs while whirled along with ſuch a companion, and ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"Sir, you obſerved one day at General Oglethorpe's, that a man is never happy for the preſent, but when he is drunk. Will you not add,—or when driving rapidly in a poſt-chaiſe?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, you are driving rapidly <hi>from</hi> ſomething, or <hi>to</hi> ſomething."</q>

               <p>Talking of melancholy, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Some men, and very thinking men too, have not thoſe vexing thoughts. Sir Joſhua Reynolds is the ſame all the year round. Beauclerk, except when ill and in pain, is the ſame. But I believe moſt men have them in the degree in which they are capable of having them. If I were in the country, and were diſtreſſed by that malady, I would force myſelf to take a book; and every time I did it I ſhould find it the eaſier. Melancholy, indeed, ſhould be diverted by every means but drinking."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We ſtopped at Meſſieurs Dillys, bookſellers in the Poultry; from whence he hurried away, in a hackney coach, to Mr. Thrale's in the Borough. I called at his houſe in the evening, having promiſed to acquaint Mrs. Williams of his ſafe return; when, to my ſurprize, I found him ſitting with her at tea, and, as I thought, not in a very good humour: for, it ſeems, when he got to Mr. Thrale's, he found the coach was at the door waiting to carry Mrs. and Miſs Thrale, and Signor Baretti their Italian maſter, to Bath. This was not ſhewing the attention which might have been expected to the <q rend="inline">"Guide, Philoſopher, and Friend,"</q> the <hi>Imlack</hi> who had haſtened from the country to conſole a diſtreſſed mother, who he underſtood was very anxious for his return. They had, I found, without ceremony, proceeded on their intended journey. I was glad to underſtand from him that it was ſtill reſolved that his tour to Italy with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale ſhould take place, of which he had entertained ſome doubt, on account of the loſs which they had ſuffered; and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0548300102:48" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his doubts afterwards proved to be well-founded. He obſerved, indeed very  juſtly, that <q rend="inline">"their loſs was an additional reaſon for their going abroad; and if it had not been fixed that he ſhould have been one of the party, he would force them out; but he would not adviſe them unleſs his advice was aſked, leſt they might ſuſpect that he recommended what he wiſhed on his own account."</q> I was not pleaſed that his intimacy with Mr. Thrale's family, though it no doubt contributed much to his comfort and enjoyment, was not without ſome degree of reſtraint. Not, as has been groſsly ſuggeſted, that it was required of him as a taſk to talk for the entertainment of them and their company; but that he was not quite at his eaſe; which, however, might partly be owing to his own honeſt pride—that dignity of mind which is always jealous of appearing too compliant.</p>
               <p>On Sunday, March 31, I called on him, and ſhewed him as a curioſity which I had diſcovered, his <q rend="inline">"Tranſlation of Lobo's Account of Abyſſinia,"</q> which Sir John Pringle had lent me, it being then little known as one of his works. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Take no notice of it, or don't talk of it."</q> He ſeemed to think it beneath him, though done at ſix-and-twenty. I ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"Your ſtyle, Sir, is much improved ſince you tranſlated this."</q> He anſwered with a ſort of triumphant ſmile, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I hope it is."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, April 3, in the forenoon, I found him very buſy putting his books in order, and as they were generally very old ones, clouds of duſt were flying around him. He had on a pair of large gloves, ſuch as hedgers uſe. His preſent appearance put me in mind of my uncle, Dr. Boſwell's deſcription of him, <q rend="inline">"A robuſt genius, born to grapple with whole libraries."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I gave him an account of a converſation which had paſſed between me and Captain Cook, the day before at dinner at Sir John Pringle's, and he was much pleaſed with the conſcientious accuracy of that celebrated circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>navigator, who ſet me right as to many of the exaggerated accounts given by Dr. Hawkeſworth of his Voyages. I told him that while I was with the Captain, I catched the enthuſiaſm of curioſity and adventure, and felt a ſtrong inclination to go with him on his next voyage. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, a man <hi>does</hi> ſeel ſo, till he conſiders how very little he can learn from ſuch voyages."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But one is carried away with the general grand and indiſtinct notion of A VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, but a man is to guard himſelf againſt taking a thing in general."</q> I ſaid I was certain that a great part of what we are told by the travellers to the South Sea muſt be conjecture, becauſe they had not enough of the
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0548300102:49"/>
 language of thoſe countries to underſtand ſo much as they have related. Objects falling under the obſervation of the ſenſes might be clearly known; but every thing intellectual, every thing abſtract—politicks, morals, and religion, muſt be darkly gueſſed. Dr. Johnſon was of the ſame opinion. He upon another occaſion, when a friend mentioned to him ſeveral extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary facts, as communicated to him by the circumnavigators, ſlily obſerved, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I never before knew how much I was reſpected by theſe gentlemen; they told <hi>me</hi> none of theſe things."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He had been in company with Omai, a native of one of the South Sea iſlands, after he had been ſome time in this country. He was ſtruck with the elegance of his behaviour, and accounted for it thus: <q rend="inline">"Sir, he had paſſed his time, while in England, only in the beſt company; ſo that all that he had acquired of our manners was genteel. As a proof of this, Sir, Lord Mulgrave and he dined one day at Streatham; they ſat with their backs to the light fronting me, ſo that I could not ſee diſtinctly; and there was ſo little of the ſavage in Omai, that I was afraid to ſpeak to either, left I ſhould miſtake one for the other."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We agreed to dine to-day at the Mitre-tavern, after the riſing of the Houſe of Lords, where a branch of the litigation concerning the Douglas eſtate, in which I was one of the counſel, was to come on. I brought with me Mr. Murray, Solicitor-General of Scotland, now one of the Judges of the Court of Seſſion, with the title of Lord Henderland. I mentioned Mr. Solicitor's relation, Lord Charles Hay, with whom I knew Dr. Johnſon had been acquainted. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I wrote ſomething for Lord Charles; and I thought he had nothing to fear from a court-martial. I ſuffered a great loſs when he died; he was a mighty pleaſing man in converſation, and a reading man. The character of a ſoldier is high. They who ſtand forth the foremoſt in danger, for the community, have the reſpect of mankind. An officer is much more reſpected than any other man who has as little money. In a commercial country money will always purchaſe reſpect. But you find, an officer, who has properly ſpeaking, no money, is every where well received and treated with attention. The character of a ſoldier always ſtands him in ſtead."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yet, Sir, I think that common ſoldiers are worſe thought of than other men in the ſame rank of life; ſuch as labourers."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, a common ſoldier is uſually a very groſs man, and any quality which procures reſpect may be overwhelmed by groſſneſs. A man of learning may be ſo vicious or ſo ridiculous that you cannot reſpect him. A common ſoldier too, generally eats more than he can pay for. But when a common ſoldier is civil in his quarters, his red coat procures him a degree of reſpect."</q>

                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:0548300102:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
The peculiar reſpect paid to the military character in France was mentioned  BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I ſhould think that where military men are ſo numerous, they would be leſs valued as not being rare."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, wherever a particular character or profeſſion is high in the eſtimation of a people, thoſe who are of it will be valued above other men. We value an Engliſhman highly in this country, and yet Engliſhmen are not rare in it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Murray praiſed the ancient philoſophers for the candour and good humour with which thoſe of different ſects diſputed with each other. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, they diſputed with good humour, becauſe they were not in earneſt as to religion. Had the ancients been ſerious in their belief, we ſhould not have had their Gods exhibited in the manner we find them repreſented in the Poets. The people would not have ſuffered it. They diſputed with good humour upon their fanciful theories, becauſe they were not intereſted in the truth of them. When a man has nothing to loſe, he may be in good humour with his opponent. Accordingly you ſee in Lucian, the Epicurean, who argues only negatively, keeps his temper; the Stoick, who has ſomething poſitive to preſerve, grows angry. Being angry with one who controverts an opinion which you value, is a neceſſary conſequence of the uneaſineſs which you feel. Every man who attacks my belief, diminiſhes in ſome degree my confidence in it, and therefore makes me uneaſy, and I am angry with him who makes me uneaſy. Thoſe only who believed in Revelation have been angry at having their faith called in queſtion; becauſe they only had ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing upon which they could reſt as matter of fact."</q> MURRAY. <q rend="inline">"It ſeems to me that we are not angry at a man for controverting an opinion which we believe and value; we rather pity him."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir; to be ſure when you wiſh a man to have that belief which you think is of infinite advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, you wiſh well to him; but your primary conſideration is your own quiet. If a madman were to come into this room with a ſtick in his hand, no doubt we ſhould pity the ſtate of his mind; but our primary conſideration would be to take care of ourſelves. We ſhould knock him down firſt, and pity him afterwards. No, Sir; every man will diſpute with great good humour upon a ſubject in which he is not intereſted. I will diſpute very calmly upon the probability of another man's ſon being hanged, but if a man zealouſly enforces the probability that my own ſon will be hanged, I ſhall certainly not be in very good humour with him."</q> I added this illuſtration, <q rend="inline">"If a man endeavours to convince me that my wife, whom I love very much, and in whom I have great confidence, is a diſagreeable woman, and is even unfaithful to me, I ſhall be very angry, for he is putting me in fear of being unhappy."</q> MURRAY. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, truth will always bear an
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0548300102:51" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 examination."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, but it is painful to be forced to defend it. Conſider, Sir, how ſhould you like, though conſcious of your innocence, to be tried before a jury for a capital crime, once a week."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of education at great ſchools, the advantages and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of which Johnſon diſplayed in a luminous manner; but his arguments preponderated ſo much in favour of the benefit which a boy of good parts might receive at one of them, that I have reaſon to believe Mr. Murray was very much influenced by what he had heard to-day, in his determination to ſend his own ſon to Weſtminſter ſchool.</p>
               <p>I introduced the topick, which is often ignorantly urged, that the Univerſities of England are too rich, ſo that learning does not flouriſh in them as it would do, if thoſe who teach had ſmaller ſalaries, and depended on their aſſiduity for a great part of their income. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, the very reverſe of this is the truth; the Engliſh Univerſities are not rich enough. Our fellowſhips are only ſufficient to ſupport a man during his ſtudies to fit him for the world, and accordingly in general they are held no longer than till an opportunity offers of getting away. Now and then, perhaps, there is a fellow who grows old in his college; but this is againſt his will, unleſs he be a man very indolent indeed. A hundred a year is reckoned a good fellowſhip, and that is no more than is neceſſary to keep a man decently as a ſcholar. We do not allow our fellows to marry, becauſe we conſider academical inſtitutions as preparatory to a ſettlement in the world. It is only by being employed as a tutor, that a fellow can obtain any thing more than a livelihood. To be ſure a man, who has enough without teaching, will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably not teach; for we would all be idle if we could. In the ſame manner, a man who is to get nothing by teaching, will not exert himſelf. Greſham-College was intended as a place of inſtruction for London; able Profeſſors were to read lectures gratis, they contrived to have no ſcholars; whereas, if they had been allowed to receive but ſix-pence a lecture from each ſcholar, they would have been emulous to have had many ſcholars. Every body will agree that it ſhould be the intereſt of thoſe who teach to have ſcholars; and this is the caſe in our Univerſities. That they are too rich is certainly not true; for they have nothing good enough to keep a man of eminent learning with them for his life. In the foreign Univerſities a profeſſorſhip is a high thing. It is as much almoſt as a man can make by his learning; and therefore we find the moſt learned men abroad are in the Univerſities. It is not ſo with us. Our Uiverſities are impoveriſhed of learning, by the penury of their proviſions. I wiſh there were many places of a thouſand a-year at Oxford, to keep firſt rate men of learning from quitting the Univerſity."</q> Undoubtedly,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0548300102:52" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if this were the caſe, Literature would have a ſtill greater dignity and ſplendour  at Oxford, and there would be grander living ſources of inſtruction.</p>
               <p>I mentioned Mr. Maclaurin's uneaſineſs on account of a degree of ridicule careleſsly thrown on his deceaſed father, in Goldſmith's <q rend="inline">"Hiſtory of Animated Nature,"</q> in which that celebrated mathematician is repreſented as being ſubject to fits of yawning ſo violent as to render him incapable of proceeding in his lecture; a ſtory altogether unfounded, but for the publication of which the law would give no reparation <note n="6" place="bottom">Dr. Goldſmith was dead before Mr. Maclaurin diſcovered the ludicrous errour. But Mr. Nourſe, the bookſeller, who was the proprietor of the work, upon being applied to by Sir John Pringle, agreed very handſomely to have the leaf on which it was contained cancelled, and re-printed without it, at his own expence.</note>. This led us to agitate the queſtion, whether legal redreſs could be obtained, even when a man's deceaſed relation was calumniated in a publication. Mr. Murray maintained there ſhould be repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, unleſs the authour could juſtify himſelf by proving the fact. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is of ſo much more conſequence that truth ſhould be told, than that individuals ſhould not be made uneaſy, that it is much better that the law does not reſtrain writing freely concerning the characters of the dead. Damages will be given to a man who is calumniated in his life-time, becauſe he may be hurt in his worldly intereſt, or at leaſt hurt in his mind: but the law does not regard that uneaſineſs which a man feels on having his anceſtor calumniated. That is too nice. Let him deny what is ſaid, and let the matter have a fair chance by diſcuſſion. But, if a man could ſay nothing againſt a character but what he can prove, hiſtory could not be written; for a great deal is known of men of which proof cannot be brought. A miniſter may be notoriouſly known to take bribes, and yet you may not be able to prove it."</q> Mr. Murray ſuggeſted, that the authour ſhould be obliged to ſhew ſome ſort of evidence, though he would not require a ſtrict legal proof: but Johnſon firmly and reſolutely oppoſed any reſtraint whatever, as adverſe to a free inveſtigation of the characters of mankind <note n="7" place="bottom">What Dr. Johnſon has here ſaid, is undoubtedly good ſenſe; yet I am afraid that law, though defined by Lord Coke <q rend="inline">"the perfection of reaſon,"</q> is not altogether with him; for it is held in the books, that an attack on the reputation even of a dead man, may be puniſhed as a libel, becauſe tending to a breach of the peace. There is however, I believe, no modern decided caſe to that effect. In the King's Bench, Trinity Term, 1790, the queſtion occurred on occaſion of an indictment, <hi>The King</hi> v. <hi>Topham,</hi> who, as a <hi>proprietor</hi> of a newſpaper entitled <q rend="inline">"THE WORLD,"</q> was found guilty of a libel againſt Earl Cowper, deceaſed, becauſe certain injurious charges againſt his Lordſhip were publiſhed in that paper. One of the counſel for Mr. Topham, my friend Mr. Conſt, who is very able to maintain the argument with learning and ingenuity, informs me that it is intended to move in arreſt of judgement; ſo that we ſhall probably have a ſolemn determination, upon a point of univerſal importance. No man has a higher reverence for the law of England in general than I have; but, with all deference I cannot help thinking, that proſecution by indict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, if a defendant is never to be allowed to juſtify, muſt often be very oppreſſive, unleſs Juries, who I am more and more confirmed in holding to be judges of law as well as of fact, interpoſe.</note>.</p>

 On Thurſday, April 4, having called on Dr. Johnſon, I ſaid, it was a pity that truth was not ſo firm as to bid defiance to all attacks, ſo that it might be ſhot at as much as people choſe to attempt, and yet remain unhurt. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, it would not be ſhot at. Nobody attempts to diſpute that two and two make four: but with conteſts concerning moral truth, human paſſions are generally mixed, and therefore it muſt ever be liable to aſſault and miſrepreſentation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Friday, April 5, being Good-Friday, after having attended the morning ſervice at St. Clement's church, I walked home with Johnſon. We talked of the Roman Catholick religion. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"In the barbarous ages, Sir, prieſts and people were equally deceived; but afterwards there were groſs corruptions introduced by the clergy, ſuch as indulgences to prieſts to have concubines, and the worſhip of images, not, indeed, inculcated, but knowingly permitted."</q> He ſtrongly cenſured the licenſed ſtews at Rome. BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"So then, Sir, you would allow of no irregular intercourſe whatever between the ſexes?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"To be ſure I would not, Sir. I would puniſh it much more than is done, and ſo reſtrain it. In all countries there has been fornication, as in all countries there has been theft; but there may be more or leſs of the one, as well as of the other, in proportion to the force of law. All men will naturally commit fornication, as all men will naturally ſteal. And, Sir, it is very abſurd to argue, as has been often done, that proſtitutes are neceſſary to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the violent effects of appetite from violating the decent order of life; nay, ſhould be permitted, in order to preſerve the chaſtity of our wives and daughters. Depend upon it, Sir, ſevere laws, ſteadily enforced, would be ſufficient againſt thoſe evils, and would promote marriage."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſtated to him this caſe:—<q rend="inline">"Suppoſe a man has a daughter who he knows has been ſeduced, but her misfortune is concealed from the world: ſhould he keep her in his houſe? Would he not, by doing ſo, be acceſſary to impoſition? And, perhaps, a worthy unſuſpecting man might come and marry this woman, unleſs the father inform him of the truth."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, he is acceſſary to no impoſition. His daughter is in his houſe; and if a man courts her, he takes his chance. If a friend, or, indeed, if any man aſks his opinion whether he ſhould marry her, he ought to adviſe him againſt it, without tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing why, becauſe his real opinion is then required. Or, if he has other
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0548300102:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
daughters who know of her frailty, he ought not to keep her in his houſe.  You are to conſider the ſtate of life is this; we are to judge of one another's characters as well as we can; and a man is not bound, in honeſty or honour, to tell us the faults of his daughter or of himſelf. A man who has debauched his friend's daughter is not obliged to ſay to every body—'Take care of me don't let me into your houſes without ſuſpicion. I once debauched a friend's daughter: I may debauch yours."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Thrale called upon him, and appeared to bear the loſs of his ſon with a manly compoſure. There was no affectation about him; and he talked, as uſual, upon indifferent ſubjects. He ſeemed to me to heſitate as to the intended Italian tour, on which, I flattered myſelf, he and Mrs. Thrale and Dr. Johnſon were ſoon to ſet out; and, therefore, I preſſed it as much as I could. I mentioned that Mr. Beauclerk had ſaid, that Baretti, whom they were to carry with them, would keep them ſo long in the little towns of his own diſtrict, that they would not have time to ſee Rome. I mentioned this, to put them on their guard. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, we do not thank Mr. Beauclerk for ſuppoſing that we are to be directed by Baretti. No, Sir; Mr. Thrale is to go, by my advice, to Mr. Jackſon, (the all-knowing,) and get from him a plan for ſeeing the moſt that can be ſeen in the time that we have to travel. We muſt, to be ſure, ſee Rome, Naples, Florence, and Venice, and as much more as we can,"</q> (ſpeaking with a tone of animation).</p>
               <p>When I expreſſed an earneſt wiſh for his remarks on Italy, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I do not ſee that I could make a book upon Italy; yet I ſhould be glad to get two hundred pounds, or five hundred pounds by ſuch a work.</q> This ſhewed both that a journal of his Tour upon the Continent was not wholly out of his contemplation, and that he uniformly adhered to that ſtrange opinion, which his indolent diſpoſition made him utter: <q rend="inline">"No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money."</q> Numerous inſtances to refute this will occur to all who are verſed in the hiſtory of literature.</p>
               <p>He gave us one of the many ſketches of character which were treaſured in his mind, and which he was wont to produce quite unexpectedly in a very entertaining manner. <q rend="inline">"I lately (ſaid he,) received a letter from the Eaſt-Indies, from a gentleman whom I formerly knew very well; he had returned from that country with a handſome fortune, as it was reckoned, before means were found to acquire thoſe immenſe ſums which have been brought from thence of late; he was a ſcholar, and an agreeable man, and lived very prettily in London, till his wife died. After her death, he took to diſſipation and gaming, and loſt all he had. One evening he loſt a thouſand pounds to a gentleman whoſe name I am ſorry I have forgotten. Next morning he ſent the gentleman
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0548300102:55" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 five hundred pounds, with an apology that it was all he had in the world. The gentleman ſent the money back to him, declaring he would not accept it; and adding, that if Mr.—had ocaſion for five hundred pounds more he would lend it to him. He reſolved to go out again to the Eaſt-Indies, and make his fortune anew. He got a conſiderable appointment, and I had ſome intention of accompanying him. Had I thought then as I do now, I ſhould have gone: but, at that time, I had objections to quitting England."</q>

               <p>It was a very remarkable circumſtance about Johnſon, whom ſhallow obſervers have ſuppoſed to have been ignorant of the world, that very few men had ſeen greater variety of characters; and none could obſerve them better, as was evident from the ſtrong, yet nice portraits which he often drew. I have frequently thought that if he had made out what the French call <hi>une catalogue raiſonnée</hi> of all the people who had paſſed under his obſervation, it would have afforded a very rich fund of inſtruction and entertainment. The ſuddenneſs with which his accounts of ſome of them ſtarted out in converſation, was not leſs pleaſing than ſurpriſing. I remember he once obſerved to me, <q rend="inline">"It is wonderful, Sir, what is to be found in London. The moſt literary converſation that I ever enjoyed, was at the table of Jack Ellis, a money<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcrivener behind the Royal-Exchange, with whom I at one period uſed to dine generally once a week <note n="8" place="bottom">This Mr. Ellis is, I believe, the laſt of that profeſſion called Scriveners, which is one of the London companies, but of which the buſineſs is no longer carried on ſeparately, but is tranſacted by attornies and others. He is a man of literature and talents. He is the authour of a Hudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braſtick verſion of Maphaeus's Canto, in addition to the Aeneid; of ſome poems in Dodſley's collection; and various other ſmall pieces; but being a very modeſt man, has never put his name to any thing. He has ſhewn me a tranſlation which he has made of Ovid's Epiſtles, very prettily done. There is a good engraved portrait of him by Peffer, from a picture by Fry, which hangs in the hall of the Scriveners' company. He is now a very old man. I have viſited him this day, (October 4, 1790,) in his ninety-third year, and found his judgement diſtinct and clear, and his memory, though faded ſo as to fail him occaſionally, yet, as he aſſured me, and I indeed perceived, able to ſerve him very well, after a little recollection. It was agreeable to obſerve, that he was free from the diſcontent and fretfulneſs which too often moleſt old age. He in the ſummer of this year walked to Rotherhithe, where he dined, and walked home in the evening.</note>."</q>

Robert Levett; of Lord Thurlow, and Mr. Saſtres, the Italian maſter; and  has dined one day with the beautiful, gay, and faſcinating Lady Craven <note n="9" place="bottom">Lord Macartney, who with his other diſtinguiſhed qualities, is remarkable alſo for an elegant pleaſantry, told me, that he met Johnſon at Lady Craven's, and that he ſeemed jealous of any interference; <q rend="inline">"So (ſaid his Lordſhip, ſmiling,) I kept back."</q>
                  </note>, and the next with good Mrs. Gardiner the tallow-chandler, on Snow-hill.</p>
               <p>On my expreſſing my wonder at his diſcovering ſo much of the knowledge peculiar to different profeſſions, he told me, <q rend="inline">"I learnt what I know of law, chiefly from Mr. Ballow, a very able man. I learnt ſome too from Chambers; but was not ſo teachable then. One is not willing to be taught by a young man."</q> When I expreſſed a wiſh to know more about Mr. Ballow, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I have ſeen him but once theſe twenty years. The tide of life has driven us different ways."</q> I was ſorry at the time to hear this; but whoever quits the creeks of private connections, and fairly gets into the great ocean of London, will, by imperceptible degrees, unavoidably experience this.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"My knowledge of phyſick, (he added,) I learnt from Dr. James, whom I helped in writing the propoſals for his Dictionary, and alſo a little in the Dictionary itſelf. I alſo learnt ſome from Dr. Lawrence, but was then grown more ſtubborn."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A curious incident happened to-day, while Mr. Thrale and I ſat with him. Francis announced that a large packet was brought to him from the poſt-office, ſaid to have come from Liſbon, and it was charged <hi>ſeven pounds ten ſhillings.</hi> He would not receive it, ſuppoſing it to be ſome trick, nor did he even look at it. But upon enquiry afterwards he found that it was a real packet for him, from that very friend in the Eaſt-Indies of whom he had been ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the ſhip which carried it having come to Portugal, this packet, with others, had been put into the poſt-office at Liſbon.</p>
               <p>I mentioned a new gaming club, of which Mr. Beauclerk had given me an account, where the members played to a deſperate extent. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Depend upon it, Sir, this is mere talk. <hi>Who</hi> is ruined by gaming? You will not find ſix inſtances in an age. There is a ſtrange rout made about deep play; whereas you have many more people ruined by adventurous trade, and yet we do not hear ſuch an outcry againſt it."</q> THRALE. <q rend="inline">"There may be few people abſolutely ruined by deep play; but very many are much hurt in their circumſtances by it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; and ſo are very many by other kinds of expence."</q> I had heard him talk once before in the ſame manner; and at Oxford he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"he wiſhed he had learnt to play at cards."</q> The
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0548300102:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 truth, however, is, that he loved to diſplay his ingenuity in argument; and therefore would ſometimes in converſation maintain opinions which he was ſenſible were wrong, but in ſupporting which, his reaſoning and wit would be moſt conſpicuous. He would begin thus: <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, as to the good or evil of card-playing—"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Now (ſaid Garrick,) he is thinking which ſide he ſhall take."</q> He appeared to have a pleaſure in contradiction, eſpecially when any opinion whatever was delivered with an air of confidence; ſo that there was hardly any topick, if not one of the great truths of Religion and Morality, that he might not have been incited to argue, either for or againſt it. Lord Elibank <note n="1" place="bottom">Patrick Lord Elibank, who died 1778.</note> had the higheſt admiration of his powers. He once obſerved to me, <q rend="inline">"Whatever opinion Johnſon maintains, I will not ſay that he convinces me; but he never fails to ſhow me, that he has good reaſons for it."</q> I have heard Johnſon pay his Lordſhip this high compliment: <q rend="inline">"I never was in Lord Elibank's company without learning ſomething."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We ſat together till it was too late for the afternoon ſervice. Thrale ſaid, he had come with intention to go to church with us. We went at ſeven to evening prayers at St. Clement's church, after having drank coffee; an indulgence, which I underſtood Johnſon yielded to on this occaſion, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment to Thrale.</p>
               <p>On Sunday, April 7, Eaſter-day, after having been at St. Paul's cathedral, I came to Dr. Johnſon, according to my uſual cuſtom. It ſeemed to me, that there was always ſomething peculiarly mild and placid in his manner upon this holy feſtival, the commemoration of the moſt joyful event in the hiſtory of our world, the reſurrection of our LORD and SAVIOUR, who, having triumphed over death and the grave, proclaimed immortality to mankind.</p>
               <p>I repeated to him an argument of a lady of my acquaintance, who main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, that her huſband's having been guilty of numberleſs infidelities, releaſed her from conjugal obligations, becauſe they were reciprocal. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"This is miſerable ſtuff, Sir. To the contract of marriage, beſides the man and wife, there is a third party—Society; and, if it be conſidered as a vow—GOD: and, therefore, it cannot be diſſolved by their conſent alone. Laws are not made for particular caſes, but for mankind in general. A woman may be unhappy with her huſband; but ſhe cannot be freed from him without the approbation of the civil and eccleſiaſtical power. A man may be unhappy, becauſe he is not ſo rich as another; but he is not to ſeize upon another's property with his own hand."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, this lady does not want
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0548300102:58" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that the contract ſhould be diſſolved; ſhe only argues that ſhe may indulge  herſelf in gallantries with equal freedom as her huſband does, provided ſhe takes care not to introduce a ſpurious iſſue into his family. You know, Sir, what Macrobius has told us of Julia <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <q rend="inline">"Nunquam enim niſi uavi plenâ tollo vectorem."</q> 
                        <hi>Lib. ii. c. vi.</hi>
                     </note>."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"This lady of yours, Sir, I think, is very fit for a brothel."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Macbean, authour of the <q rend="inline">"Dictionary of ancient Geography,"</q> came in. He mentioned, that he had been forty years abſent from Scotland. <q rend="inline">"Ah, Boſwell! (ſaid Johnſon, ſmiling,) what would you give to be forty years from Scotland?"</q> I ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I ſhould not like to be ſo long abſent from the ſeat of my anceſtors."</q> This gentleman, Mrs. Williams, and Mr. Levett, dined with us.</p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon made a remark, which both Mr. Macbean and I thought new. It was this: that <q rend="inline">"the law againſt uſury is for the protection of creditors as well as of debtors; for if there were no ſuch check, people would be apt, from the temptation of great intereſt, to lend to deſperate perſons, by whom they would loſe their money. Accordingly there are inſtances of ladies being ruined, by having injudiciouſly ſunk their fortunes for high annuities, which, after a few years, ceaſed to be paid, in conſequence of the ruined circumſtances of the borrower."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Williams was very peeviſh; and I wondered at Johnſon's patience with her now, as I had often done on ſimilar occaſions. The truth is, that his humane conſideration of the forlorn and indigent ſtate in which this lady was left by her father, induced him to treat her with the utmoſt tenderneſs, and even to be deſirous of procuring her amuſement, ſo as ſometimes to incommode many of his friends, by carrying her with him to their houſes, where, from her manner of eating, in conſequence of her blindneſs, ſhe could not but offend the delicacy of perſons of nice ſenſations.</p>
               <p>After coffee, we went to afternoon ſervice in St. Clement's church. Obſerving ſome beggars in the ſtreet as we walked along, I ſaid to him I ſuppoſed there was no civiliſed country in the world, where the miſery of want in the loweſt claſſes of the people was prevented. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I believe, Sir, there is not; but it is better that ſome ſhould be unhappy, than that none ſhould be happy, which would be the caſe in a general ſtate of equality."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When the ſervice was ended, I went home with him, and we ſat quietly by ourſelves. He recommended Dr. Cheyne's books. I ſaid, I thought Cheyne
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0548300102:59" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 had been reckoned whimſical.—<q rend="inline">"So he was, (ſaid he,) in ſome things; but there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s no end of objections. There are few books to which ſome objection or other may not be made."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the queſtion whether a man who had been guilty of vicious actions would do well to force himſelf into ſolitude and ſadneſs; JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, unleſs it prevent him from being vicious again. With ſome people, gloomy penitence is only madneſs turned upſide down. A man may be gloomy, till, in order to be relieved from gloom, he has recourſe again to criminal indulgences."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, April 10, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale's, where were Mr. Murphy and ſome other company. Before dinner, Dr. Johnſon and I paſſed ſome time by ourſelves. I was ſorry to find it was now reſolved that the propoſed journey to Italy ſhould not take place this year. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I am diſappointed, to be ſure; but it is not a great diſappointment."</q> I wondered to ſee him bear, with a philoſophical calmneſs, what would have made moſt people peeviſh and fretful. I perceived, however, that he had ſo warmly cheriſhed the hope of enjoying claſſical ſcenes, that he could not eaſily part with the ſcheme; for he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I ſhall probably contrive to get to Italy ſome other way. But I won't mention it to Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, as it might vex them."</q> I ſuggeſted, that going to Italy might have done Mr. and Mrs. Thrale good. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I rather believe not, Sir. While grief is freſh, every attempt to divert only irritates. You muſt wait till grief be <hi>digeſted,</hi> and then amuſement will diſſipate the remains of it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>At dinner, Mr. Murphy entertained us with the hiſtory of Mr. Joſeph Simpſon, a ſchoolfellow of Dr. Johnſon's, a barriſter at law, of good parts, but who fell into a diſſipated courſe of life, incompatible with that ſucceſs in his profeſſion which he once had, and would otherwiſe have deſervedly main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; yet he ſtill preſerved a dignity in his deportment. He wrote a tragedy on the ſtory of Leonidas, entitled <q rend="inline">"The Patriot,"</q> He read it to a company of lawyers, who found ſo many faults, that he wrote it over again: ſo then there were two tragedies on the ſame ſubject, and with the ſame title. Dr. Johnſon told us, that one of them was ſtill in his poſſeſſion. This very piece was, after his death, publiſhed by ſome perſon who had been about him, and, for the ſake of a little haſty profit, was poſitively averred to have been written by Johnſon himſelf.</p>
               <p>I ſaid, I diſliked the cuſtom which ſome people had of bringing their children into company, becauſe it in a manner forced us to pay fooliſh com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to pleaſe their parents. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You are right, Sir. We may be excuſed for not caring much about other people's children, for there are
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0548300102:60" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many who care very little about their own children. It may be obſerved,  that men, who from being engaged in buſineſs, or from their courſe of life in whatever way, ſeldom ſee their children, do not care much about them. I myſelf ſhould not have had much fondneſs for a child of my own."</q> MRS. THRALE. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, how can you talk ſo?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"At leaſt, I never wiſhed to have a child."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Murphy mentioned Dr. Johnſon's having a deſign to publiſh an edition of Cowley. Johnſon ſaid, he did not know but he ſhould; and he expreſſed his diſapprobation of Dr. Hurd, for having publiſhed a mutilated edition under the title of <q rend="inline">"Select Works of Abraham Cowley."</q> Mr. Murphy thought it a bad precedent; obſerving, that any authour might be uſed in the ſame manner; and that it was pleaſing to ſee the variety of an authour's compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, at different periods.</p>
               <p>We talked of Flatman's Poems; and Mrs. Thrale obſerved, that Pope had partly borrowed from him, <q rend="inline">"The dying Chriſtian to his Soul."</q> Johnſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated Rocheſter's verſes upon Flatman, which, I think, by much too ſevere:</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"Nor that ſlow drudge in ſwift Pindarick ſtrains,</l>
                     <l>"Flatman, who Cowley imitates with pains,</l>
                     <l>"And rides a jaded Muſe, whipt with looſe reins."</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>I like to recollect all the paſſages that I heard Johnſon repeat: it ſtamps a value on them.</p>
               <p>He told us, that the book entitled <q rend="inline">"The Lives of the Poets, by Mr. Cibber,"</q> was entirely compiled by Mr. Shiels, a Scotchman, one of his amanuenſes. <q rend="inline">"The bookſellers (ſaid he,) gave Theophilus Cibber, who was then in priſon, ten guineas, to allow <hi>Mr. Cibber</hi> to be put upon the title-page, as the authour; by this, a double impoſition was intended: in the firſt place, that it was the work of a Cibber at all; and, in the ſecond place, that it was the work of old Cibber."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Murphy ſaid, that <q rend="inline">"The Memoirs of Gray's Life ſet him much higher in his eſtimation than his poems did; for you there ſaw a man con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly at work in literature."</q> Johnſon acquieſced in this, but depreciated the book, I thought, very unreaſonably. For he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I forced myſelf to read it, only becauſe it was a common topick of converſation. I found it mighty dull; and, as to the ſtyle, it is fit for the ſecond table."</q> Why he thought ſo, I was at a loſs to conceive. He now gave it as his opinion, that <q rend="inline">"Akenſide was a ſuperiour poet both to Gray and Maſon."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:0548300102:61" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Talking of the Reviews, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I think them very impartial: I do not know an inſtance of partiality."</q> He mentioned what had paſſed upon the ſubject of the Monthly and Critical Reviews, in the converſation with which his Majeſty had honoured him. He expatiated a little more on them this evening. <q rend="inline">"The Monthly Reviewers (ſaid he) are not Deiſts; but they are Chriſtians with as little chriſtianity as may be; and are for pulling down all eſtabliſhments. The Critical Reviewers are for ſupporting the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, both in church and ſtate. The Critical Reviewers, I believe, often review without reading the books through; but lay hold of a topick, and write chiefly from their own minds. The Monthly Reviewers are duller men, and are glad to read the books through."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He talked of Lord Lyttelton's extreme anxiety as an authour; obſerving, that <q rend="inline">"he was thirty years in preparing his Hiſtory, and that he employed a man to point it for him; as if (laughing) another man could point his ſenſe better than himſelf."</q> Mr. Murphy ſaid, he underſtood his Hiſtory was kept back ſeveral years for fear of Smollet. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"This ſeems ſtrange to Murphy and me, who never felt that anxiety, but ſent what we wrote to the preſs, and let it take its chance."</q> MRS. THRALE. <q rend="inline">"The time has been, Sir, when you felt it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why really, Madam, I do not recollect a time when that was the caſe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of <q rend="inline">"The Spectator,"</q> he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is wonderful that there is ſuch a proportion of bad papers, in the half of the work which was not written by Addiſon; for there was all the world to write that half, yet not a half of that half is good. One of the fineſt pieces in the Engliſh language is the paper on Novelty, yet we do not hear it talked of. It was written by Grove, a diſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>teacher.</hi>"</q> He would not, I perceived, call him a <hi>clergyman,</hi> though he was candid enough to allow very great merit to his compoſition. Mr. Murphy ſaid, he remembered when there were ſeveral people alive in London, who enjoyed a conſiderable reputation merely from having written a paper in <q rend="inline">"The Spectator."</q> He mentioned particularly Mr. Ince, who uſed to frequent Tom's coffee-houſe. <q rend="inline">"But (ſaid Johnſon,) you muſt conſider how highly Steele ſpeaks of Mr. Ince."</q> He would not allow that the paper on carrying a boy to travel, ſigned <hi>Philip Homebred,</hi> which was written by the Lord Chancellor Hardwick, had merit. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"it was quite vulgar, and had nothing luminous."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon mentioned Dr. Barry's <q rend="inline">"Syſtem of Phyſick."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"He was a man (ſaid he,) who had acquired a high reputation in Dublin, came over to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and brought his reputation with him, but had not great ſucceſs. His notion
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0548300102:62" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was, that pulſation occaſions death by attrition; and that, therefore, the way  to preſerve life is to retard pulſation. But we know that pulſation is ſtrongeſt in infants, and that we increaſe in growth while it operates in its regular courſe; ſo it cannot be the cauſe of deſtruction."</q> Soon after this, he ſaid ſomething very flattering to Mrs. Thrale, which I do not recollect; but it concluded with wiſhing her long life. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid I,) if Dr. Barry's ſyſtem be true, you have now ſhortened Mrs. Thrale's life, perhaps, ſome minutes, by accelerating her pulſation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Thurſday, April 11, I dined with him at General Paoli's, in whoſe houſe I now reſided, and where I had ever afterwards the honour of being enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained with the kindeſt attention as his conſtant gueſt, while I was in London, till I had a houſe of my own there. I mentioned my having that morning introduced to Mr. Garrick, Count Neni, a Flemiſh nobleman of great rank and fortune, to whom Garrick talked of Abel Drugger as <hi>a ſmall part;</hi> and related, with pleaſant vanity, that a Frenchman who had ſeen him in one of his low characters, exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Comment! je ne le crois pas. Ce n'eſt pas, Monſieur Garrick, ce Grand Homme!"</q> Garrick added, with an appearance of grave recollection, <q rend="inline">"If I were to begin life again, I think I ſhould not play thoſe low characters."</q> Upon which I obſerved, <q rend="inline">"Sir, you would be in the wrong; for your great excellence is your variety of playing, your repreſenting ſo well, characters ſo very different.</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Garrick, Sir, was not in earneſt in what he ſaid; for, to be ſure, his peculiar excellence is his variety: and, perhaps, there is not any one character which has not been as well acted by ſomebody elſe, as he could do it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Why then, Sir, did he talk ſo?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, to make you anſwer as you did."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I don't know, Sir; he ſeemed to dip deep into his mind for the reflection."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He had not far to dip, Sir: he had ſaid the ſame thing, probably, twenty times before."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Of a nobleman raiſed at a very early period to high office, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"His parts, Sir, are pretty well for a Lord, but would not be diſtinguiſhed in a man who had nothing elſe but his parts."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A journey to Italy was ſtill in his thoughts. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"A man who has not been in Italy, is always conſcious of an inferiority,—from his not having ſeen what it is expected a man ſhould ſee. The grand object of travelling is to ſee the ſhores of the Mediterrannean. On thoſe ſhores were the four great empires of the world; the Aſſyrian, the Perſian, the Grecian, and the Roman.—All our religion, almoſt all our law, almoſt all our arts, almoſt all that ſets us above ſavages, has come to us from the ſhores of the Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean."</q>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:0548300102:63" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 The General obſerved, that <q rend="inline">"THE MEDITERRANEAN would be a noble ſubject for a poem."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of tranſlation. I ſaid, I could not define it, nor could I think of a ſimilitude to illuſtrate it; but that it appeared to me the tranſlation of poetry could be only imitation. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You may tranſlate books of ſcience exactly. You may alſo tranſlate hiſtory, in ſo far as it is not embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed with oratory, which is poetical. Poetry, indeed, cannot be tranſlated; and, therefore, it is the poets that preſerve languages; for we would not be at the trouble to learn a language, if we could have all that is written in it juſt as well in a tranſlation. But as the beauties of poetry cannot be preſerved in any language except that in which it was originally written, we learn the language."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A gentleman maintained that the art of printing had hurt real learning, by diſſeminating idle writings.—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, if it had not been for the art of printing, we ſhould now have no learning at all; for books would have periſhed faſter than they could have been tranſcribed."</q> This obſervation ſeems not juſt, conſidering for how many ages books were preſerved by writing alone.</p>
               <p>The ſame gentleman maintained, that a general diffuſion of knowledge among a people was a diſadvantage; for it made the vulgar riſe above their humble ſphere. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, while knowledge is a diſtinction, thoſe who are poſſeſſed of it will naturally riſe above thoſe who are not. Merely to read and write was a diſtinction at firſt; but we ſee when reading and writing have become general, the common people keep their ſtations. And ſo, were higher attainments to become general, the effect would be the ſame."</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"Goldſmith (he ſaid,) referred every thing to vanity; his virtues, and his vices too, were from that motive. He was not a ſocial man. He never exchanged mind with you."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We ſpent the evening at Mr. Hoole's. Mr. Mickle, the excellent tranſlator of <q rend="inline">"The Luſiad,"</q> was there. I have preſerved little of the converſation of this evening. Dr. Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Thomſon had a true poetical genius, the power of viewing every thing in a poetical light. His fault is ſuch a cloud of words ſometimes, that the ſenſe can hardly peep through. Shiels, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piled 'Cibber's Lives of the Poets,' was one day ſitting with me. I took down Thomſon, and read aloud a large portion of him, and then aſked,—Is not this fine? Shiels having expreſſed the higheſt admiration. Well, Sir, (ſaid I,) I have omitted every other line."</q>

I related a diſpute between Goldſmith and Mr. Robert Dodſley, one day  when they and I were dining at Tom Davies's, in 1762. Goldſmith aſſerted, that there was no poetry produced in this age. Dodſley appealed to his own Collection, and maintained, that though you could not find a Palace like Dryden's <q rend="inline">"Ode on St. Cecilia's Day,"</q> you had villages compoſed of very pretty houſes; and he mentioned particularly <q rend="inline">"The Spleen."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I think Dodſley gave up the queſtion. He and Goldſmith ſaid the ſame thing; only he ſaid it in a ſofter manner than Goldſmith did: for he acknowledged that there was no poetry, nothing that towered above the common mark. You may find wit and humour in verſe, and yet no poetry. 'Hudibras' has a profuſion of theſe; yet it is not to be reckoned a poem. 'The Spleen,' in Dodſley's collection, on which you ſay he chiefly reſted, is not poetry."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Does not Gray's poetry, Sir, tower above the common mark?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; but we muſt attend to the difference between what men in general cannot do if they would, and what every man may do if he would. Sixteen-ſtring Jack towered above the common mark."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, what is poetry?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, it is much eaſier to ſay what it is not. We all <hi>know</hi> what light is; but it is not eaſy to <hi>tell</hi> what it is."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Friday, April 12, I dined with him at our friend Tom Davies's, where we met Mr. Cradock, a Leiceſterſhire gentleman, authour of <q rend="inline">"Zobeide,"</q> a tragedy; and Dr. Harwood, who has written and publiſhed various works.</p>
               <p>I introduced Ariſtotle's doctrine in his <q rend="inline">"Art of Poetry,"</q> of <q rend="inline">"the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the purging of the paſſions,"</q> as the purpoſe of tragedy. <q rend="inline">"But how are the paſſions to be purged by terrour and pity?"</q> (ſaid I, with an aſſumed air of ignorance, to incite him to talk, for which it was often neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to employ ſome addreſs). JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, you are to conſider what is the meaning of purging in the original ſenſe. It is to expel impuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties from the human body. The mind is ſubject to the ſame imperfection. The paſſions are the great movers of human actions; but they are mixed with ſuch impurities, that it is neceſſary they ſhould be purged or refined by means of terrour and pity. For inſtance, ambition is a noble paſſion; but by ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the ſtage, that a man who is ſo exceſſively ambitious as to raiſe himſelf by injuſtice, is puniſhed, we are terrified at the fatal conſequences of ſuch a paſſion. In the ſame manner a certain degree of reſentment is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; but if we ſee that a man carries it too far, we pity the object of it, and are taught to moderate that paſſion."</q> My record upon this occaſion does great injuſtice to Johnſon's expreſſion, which was ſo forcible and brilliant, that Mr. Cradock whiſpered me, <q rend="inline">"O that his words were written in a book!"</q>
               </p>

 I obſerved the great defect of the tragedy of <q rend="inline">"Othello"</q> was, that it had not a moral, for that no man could reſiſt the circumſtances of ſuſpicion which were artfully ſuggeſted to Othello's mind. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"In the firſt place, Sir, we learn from Othello this very uſeful moral, not to make an unequal match; in the ſecond place, we learn not to yield too readily to ſuſpicion. The handkerchief is merely a trick, though a very pretty trick; but there are no other circumſtances of reaſonable ſuſpicion, except what is related by Iago of Caſſio's warm expreſſions concerning Deſdemona in his ſleep; and that depended entirely upon the aſſertion of one man. No, Sir, I think Othello has more moral than almoſt any play."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of a penurious gentleman of our acquaintance, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, he is narrow, not ſo much from avarice, as from impotence to ſpend his money. He cannot find in his heart to pour out a bottle of wine; but he would not much care if it ſhould ſour."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, he wiſhed to ſee <q rend="inline">"John Dennis's Critical Works"</q> collected. Davies ſaid they would not ſell. Dr. Johnſon ſeemed to think otherwiſe.</p>
               <p>Davies ſaid of a well known dramatick authour, that <q rend="inline">"he lived upon <hi>potted ſtories,</hi> and that he made his way as Hannibal did, by vinegar; having begun by attacking people; particularly the players."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He reminded Dr. Johnſon of Mr. Murphy's having paid him the higheſt compliment that ever was paid to a layman, by aſking his pardon for repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome oaths in the courſe of telling a ſtory.</p>
               <p>Johnſon and I ſupt this evening at the Crown and Anchor tavern, in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Mr. Nairne, now one of the Scotch Judges, with the title of Lord Dunſinan, and my very worthy friend, Sir William Forbes, of Pitſligo.</p>
               <p>We diſcuſſed the queſtion whether drinking improved converſation and benevolence. Sir Joſhua maintained it did. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir: before dinner men meet with great inequality of underſtanding; and thoſe who are conſcious of their inferiority, have the modeſty not to talk. When they have drunk wine, every man feels himſelf happy, and loſes that modeſty, and grows impudent and vociferous: but he is not improved; he is only not ſenſible of his defects."</q> Sir Joſhua ſaid that the Doctor was talking of the effects of exceſs in wine; but that a moderate glaſs enlivened the mind, by giving a proper circulation to the blood. <q rend="inline">"I am (ſaid he,) in very good ſpirits when I get up in the morning. By dinner-time I am exhauſted; wine puts me in the ſame ſtate as when I got up; and I am ſure that moderate
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0548300102:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>
drinking makes people talk better."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; wine gives not  light, gay, ideal hilarity; but tumultuous, noiſy, clamourous merriment. I have heard none of thoſe drunken,—nay, drunken is a coarſe word,—none of thoſe <hi>vinous</hi> flights."</q> SIR JOSHUA. <q rend="inline">"Becauſe you have ſat by, quite ſober, and felt an envy of the happineſs of thoſe who were drinking."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Perhaps, contempt.—And, Sir, it is not neceſſary to be drunk one's ſelf, to reliſh the wit of drunkenneſs. Do we not judge of the drunken wit of the dialogue between Iago and Caſſio, the moſt excellent in its kind, when we are quite ſober? Wit is wit, by whatever means it is produced; and, if good, will appear ſo at all times. I admit that the ſpirits are raiſed by drinking, as by the common participation of any pleaſure; cock-fighting, or bear-baiting, will raiſe the ſpirits of a company as drinking does, though ſurely they will not improve converſation. I alſo admit, that there are ſome ſluggiſh men who are improved by drinking, as there are fruits which are not good till they are rotten. There are ſuch men, but they are medlars. I indeed allow that there have been a very few men of talents who were improved by drinking; but I maintain that I am right as to the effects of drinking in general: and let it be conſidered, that there is no poſition, however falſe in its univerſality, which is not true of ſome particular man."</q> Sir William Forbes ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Might not a man warmed with wine be like a bottle of beer, which is made briſker by being ſet before the fire?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Nay, (ſaid Johnſon, laughing,) I cannot anſwer that: that is too much for me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I obſerved, that wine did ſome people harm, by inflaming, confuſing, and irritating their minds; but that the experience of mankind had declared in favour of moderate drinking. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I do not ſay it is wrong to produce ſelf-complacency by drinking; I only deny that it improves the mind. When I drank wine, I ſcorned to drink it when in company. I have drunk many a bottle by myſelf: in the firſt place, becauſe I had need of it to raiſe my ſpirits; in the ſecond place, becauſe I would have nobody to witneſs its effects upon me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He told us, <q rend="inline">"almoſt all his Ramblers were written juſt as they were wanted for the preſs; that he ſent a certain portion of the copy of an eſſay, and wrote the remainder, while the former part of it was printing. When it was wanted, and he had fairly ſat down to it, he was ſure it would be done."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, that for general improvement, a man ſhould read whatever his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inclination prompts him to; though, to be ſure, if a man has a ſcience to learn, he muſt regularly and reſolutely advance. He added, <q rend="inline">"what we read with inclination makes a much ſtronger impreſſion. If we read without
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0548300102:67"/>
 inclination, half the mind is employed in fixing the attention; ſo there is but one half to be employed on what we read."</q> He told us, he read Fielding's <q rend="inline">"Amelia"</q> through without ſtopping <note n="2" place="bottom">We have here an involuntary teſtimony to the excellence of this admirable writer, to whom we have ſeen that Dr. Johnſon <hi>directly</hi> allowed ſo little merit.</note>. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"if a man begins to read in the middle of a book, and feels an inclination to go on, let him not quit it, to go to the beginning. He may, perhaps, not feel again the inclination."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sir Joſhua mentioned Mr. Cumberland's Odes, which were juſt publiſhed. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, they would have been thought as good as Odes commonly are, if Cumberland had not put his name to them; but a name immediately draws cenſure, unleſs it be a name that bears down every thing before it. Nay, Cumberland has made his Odes ſubſidiary to the fame of another man <note n="3" place="bottom">Mr. Romney the painter, who has now deſervedly eſtabliſhed a high reputation.</note>. They might have run well enough by themſelves; but he has not only loaded them with a name, but has made them carry double."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of the Reviews, and Dr. Johnſon ſpoke of them as he did at Thrale's <note n="4" place="bottom">Page 60 of this volume.</note>. Sir Joſhua ſaid, what I have often thought, that he wondered to find ſo much good writing employed in them, when the authours were to remain unknown, and ſo could not have the motive of fame. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, thoſe who write in them, write well, in order to be paid well."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after this day, he went to Bath with Mr. and Mrs. Thrale. I had never ſeen that beautiful city, and wiſhed to take the opportunity of viſiting it, while Johnſon was there. Having written to him, I received the following anſwer:

               <p>On the 26th of April, I went to Bath; and on my arrival at the Pelican inn, found lying for me an obliging invitation from Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, by whom I was agreeably entertained almoſt conſtantly during my ſtay. They were gone to the rooms; but there was a kind note from Dr. Johnſon, that he ſhould ſit at home all the evening. I went to him directly, and before Mr. and Mrs. Thrale returned, we had by ourſelves ſome hours of tea-drinking and talk.</p>
               <p>I ſhall groupe together ſuch of his ſayings as I preſerved during the few days that I was at Bath.</p>
               <p>Of a perſon who differed from him in politicks, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"In private life he is a very honeſt gentleman; but I will not allow him to be ſo in publick life. People <hi>may</hi> be honeſt, though they are doing wrong: that is between their Maker and them. But <hi>we,</hi> who are ſuffering by their pernicious conduct, are to deſtroy them. We are ſure that—acts from intereſt. We know what his genuine principles were. They who allow their paſſions to confound the diſtinctions between right and wrong, are criminal. They may be convinced; but they have not come honeſtly by their conviction."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It having been mentioned, I know not with what truth, that a certain female political writer, whoſe doctrines he diſliked, had of late become very fond of dreſs, ſat hours together at her toilet, and even put on rouge;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"She is better employed at her toilet than uſing her pen. It is better ſhe ſhould be reddening her own cheeks, than blackening other people's characters."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He told us that <q rend="inline">"Addiſon wrote Budgell's papers in the Spectator, at leaſt mended them ſo much, that he made them almoſt all his own; and that Draper, Tonſon's partner, aſſured Mrs. Johnſon, that the much admired Epilogue to 'The Diſtreſſed Mother,' which came out in Budgell's name, was in reality written by Addiſon."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The mode of government by one may be ill adapted to a ſmall ſociety, but is beſt for a great nation. The characteriſtick of our own government at preſent is imbecillity. The magiſtrate dare not call the guards for fear of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0548300102:69" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 being hanged. The guards will not come, for fear of being given up to the blind rage of popular juries."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Of the father of one of our friends, he obſerved, <q rend="inline">"He never clarified his notions, by filtrating them through other minds. He had a canal upon his eſtate, where at one place the bank was too low.—I dug the canal deeper,"</q> ſaid he.</p>
               <p>He told me that <q rend="inline">"ſo long ago as 1748, he had read 'The Grave, a Poem <note n="5" place="bottom">I am ſorry that there are no memoirs of the Reverend Robert Blair, the authour of this poem. He was the repreſentative of the ancient family of Blair, of Blair in Ayrſhire, but the eſtate had deſcended to a female, and afterwards paſſed to the ſon of her huſband by another mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage. He was miniſter of the pariſh of Athelſtaneford, where Mr. John Home was his ſucceſſor; ſo that it may be truly called claſſick ground. His ſon, who is of the ſame name, and a man emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for talents and learning, is now, with univerſal approbation, Solicitor-General of Scotland.</note>,' but did not like it much."</q> I differed from him; for though it is not equal throughout, and is ſeldom elegantly correct, it abounds in ſolemn thought, and poetical imagery beyond the common reach. The world has differed from him; for the poem has paſſed through many editions, and is ſtill much read by people of a ſerious caſt of mind.</p>
               <p>A literary lady of large fortune was mentioned, as one who did good to many, but by no means <q rend="inline">"by ſtealth,"</q> and inſtead of <q rend="inline">"bluſhing to find it fame,"</q> acted evidently from vanity. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I have ſeen no beings who do as much good from benevolence, as ſhe does, from whatever motive. If there are ſuch under the earth, or in the clouds, I wiſh they would come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>up, or come down. What Soame Jennyns ſays upon this ſubject is not to be minded; he is a wit. No, Sir, to act from pure benevolence is not poſſible for finite beings. Human benevolence is mingled with vanity, intereſt, or ſome other motive."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He would not allow me to praiſe a lady then at Bath; obſerving, <q rend="inline">"She does not gain upon me, Sir; I think her empty-headed."</q> He was, indeed, a ſtern critick upon characters and manners. Even Mrs. Thrale did not eſcape his friendly animadverſion at times. When he and I were one day endeavouring to aſcertain article by article, how one of our friends could poſſibly ſpend as much money in his family as he told us he did, ſhe interrupted us with a lively extravagant ſally, on the expence of clothing his children, deſcribing it in a very ludicrous and fanciful manner. Johnſon looked a little angry, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Nay, Madam, when you are declaiming, declaim; and when you are calculating, calculate."</q> At another time, when ſhe ſaid, perhaps affectedly, <q rend="inline">"I don't like to fly."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"With <hi>your</hi> wings, Madam,
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0548300102:70" rendition="simple:additions"/>
you <hi>muſt</hi> fly: but have a care, there are <hi>clippers</hi> abroad."</q> How very well  was this ſaid, and how fully has experience proved the truth of it! But have they not <hi>clipped</hi> rather <hi>rudely,</hi> and gone a great deal <hi>cloſer</hi> than was neceſſary?</p>
               <p>A gentleman expreſſed a wiſh to go and live three years at Otaheite, or New-Zealand, in order to obtain a full acquaintance with people, ſo totally different from all that we have ever known, and be ſatisfied what pure nature can do for man. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"What could you learn, Sir? What can ſavages tell, but what they themſelves have ſeen? Of the paſt, or the inviſible, they can tell nothing. The inhabitants of Otaheite and New-Zealand are not in a ſtate of pure nature; for it is plain they broke off from ſome other people. Had they grown out of the ground, you might have judged of a ſtate of pure nature. Fanciful people may talk of a mythology being amongſt them, but it muſt be invention. They have once had religion, which has been gradually debaſed. And what account of their religion can you ſuppoſe to be learnt from ſavages? Only conſider, Sir, our own ſtate: Our religion is in a book; we have an order of men whoſe duty it is to teach it; we have one day in the week ſet apart for it, and this in general pretty well obſerved: Yet aſk the firſt ten groſs men you meet, and hear what they can tell of their religion."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Monday, April 29, he and I made an excurſion to Briſtol, where I was entertained with ſeeing him inquire upon the ſpot, into the authenticity of <q rend="inline">"<hi>Rowley's</hi> Poetry,"</q> as I had ſeen him inquire upon the ſpot into the authenticity of <q rend="inline">"<hi>Oſſian's</hi> Poetry."</q> George Catcot, the pewterer, who was as zealous for Rowley, as Dr. Hugh Blair was for Oſſian, (I truſt my Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend friend will excuſe the compariſon,) attended us at our inn, and with a triumphant air of lively ſimplicity called out, <q rend="inline">"I'll make Dr. Johnſon a convert."</q> Dr. Johnſon, at his deſire, read aloud ſome of Chatterton's fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated verſes, while Catcot ſtood at the back of his chair, moving himſelf like a pendulum, and beating time with his feet, and now and then looking into Dr. Johnſon's face, wondering that he was not yet convinced. We called on Mr. Barret, the ſurgeon, and ſaw ſome of the <hi>originals</hi> as they were called, which were executed very artificially; but from a careful inſpection of them, and a conſideration of the circumſtances with which they were attended, we were quite ſatisfied of the impoſture, which, indeed, has been clearly demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated from internal evidence, by ſeveral able criticks <note n="6" place="bottom">Mr. Tyrwhitt, Mr. Warton, Mr. Malone.</note>.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:0548300102:71" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Honeſt Catcot ſeemed to pay no attention whatever to any objections, but inſiſted, as an end of all controverſy, that we ſhould go with him to the tower of the church of St. Mary, Redcliff, and <hi>view with our own eyes</hi> the ancient cheſt in which the manuſcripts were found. To this, Dr. Johnſon good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturedly agreed; and though troubled with a ſhortneſs of breathing, laboured up a long flight of ſteps, till we came to the place where the wondrous cheſt ſtood. <q rend="inline">"<hi>There,</hi> (ſaid Catcot, with a bouncing confident credulity,) <hi>there</hi> is the very cheſt itſelf."</q> After this <hi>ocular demonſtration,</hi> there was no more to be ſaid. He brought to my recollection a Scotch Highlander, a man of learning too, and who had ſeen the world, atteſting, and at the ſame time giving his reaſons for the authenticity of Fingal:—<q rend="inline">"I have heard all that poem when I was young."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Have you, Sir? Pray what have you heard?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"I have heard Oſſian, Oſcar, and <hi>every one of them.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon ſaid of Chatterton, <q rend="inline">"This is the moſt extraordinary young man that has encountered my knowledge. It is wonderful how the whelp has written ſuch things."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We were by no means pleaſed with our inn at Briſtol. <q rend="inline">"Let us ſee now, (ſaid I,) how we ſhould deſcribe it."</q> Johnſon was ready with his raillery. <q rend="inline">"Deſcribe it, Sir?—Why, it was ſo bad that Boſwell wiſhed to be in Scotland!"</q>
               </p>
               <p>After Dr. Johnſon's return to London, I was ſeveral times with him at his houſe, where I occaſionally ſlept, in the room that had been aſſigned to me. I dined with him at Dr. Taylor's, at General Oglethorpe's, and at General Paoli's. To avoid a tedious minuteneſs, I ſhall groupe together what I have preſerved of his converſation during this period alſo, without ſpecifying each ſcene where it paſſed, except one, which will be found ſo remarkable as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly to deſerve a very particular relation. Where the place or the perſons do not contribute to the zeſt of the converſation, it is unneceſſary to encumber my page with mentioning them. To know of what vintage our wine is, enables us to judge of its value, and to drink it with more reliſh: but to have the produce of each vine of one vineyard, in the ſame year, kept ſeparate, would ſerve no purpoſe. To know that our wine (to uſe an advertiſing phraſe,) is <q rend="inline">"of the ſtock of an Ambaſſadour lately deceaſed,"</q> heightens its flavour: but it ſignifies nothing to know the bin where each bottle was once depoſited.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Garrick (he obſerved,) does not play the part of Archer in <q rend="inline">"The Beaux Stratagem"</q> well. The gentleman ſhould break out through the footman, which is not the caſe as he does it."</q>

Now the truth is, that luxury produces much good. Take the luxury of building in London. Does it not produce real advantage in the conveniency and elegance of accommodation, and this all from the exertion of induſtry? People will tell you, with a melancholy face, how many builders are in gaol. It is plain they are in gaol, not for building; for rents are not fallen.—A man gives half a guinea for a diſh of green peas.

               <p>During my ſtay in London this ſpring, I ſolicited his attention to another law caſe, in which I was engaged. In the courſe of a conteſted election for the borough of Dunfermline, which I attended, as one of my friend Colonel (now Sir Archibald) Campbell's counſel, a man, one of his political agents, who was charged with having been unfaithful to his employer, and having deſerted to the oppoſite party for a pecuniary reward—attacked very rudely in a newſpaper the Reverend Mr. James Thomſon, one of the miniſters of that place, on account of a ſuppoſed alluſion to him in one of his ſermons. Upon this the miniſter, on a ſubſequent Sunday, arraigned him by name from the pulpit with ſome ſeverity; and the agent, after the ſermon was over, roſe up and aſked the miniſter aloud, <q rend="inline">"What bribe he had received for telling ſo many lies from the chair of veracity."</q> I was preſent at this very extraordinary ſcene. The perſon arraigned, and his father and brother, who had alſo had a ſhare both of the reproof from the pulpit, and in the retalia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, brought an action againſt Mr. Thomſon, in the Court of Seſſion, for defamation and damages, and I was one of the counſel for the reverend defendant. <hi>The Liberty of the Pulpit</hi> was our great ground of defence; but we argued alſo on the provocation of the previous attack, and on the inſtant retaliation. The Court of Seſſion, however, the fifteen Judges, who are at the ſame time the jury, decided againſt the miniſter, contrary to my humble opinion; and ſeveral of them expreſſed themſelves with indignation againſt him. He was an aged gentleman, formerly a military chaplain, and a man of high ſpirit and honour. Johnſon was ſatisfied that the judgement
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0548300102:76"/>
was wrong, and dictated to me the following argument in confutation  of it:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>OF the cenſure pronounced from the pulpit, our determination muſt be formed, as in other caſes, by a conſideration of the action itſelf, and the particular circumſtances with which it is inveſted.</p>
                  <p>The right of cenſure and rebuke ſeems neceſſarily appendant to the paſtoral office. He, to whom the care of a congregation is entruſted, is conſidered as the ſhepherd of a flock, as the teacher of a ſchool, as the father of a family. As a ſhepherd tending not his own ſheep but thoſe of his maſter, he is anſwerable for thoſe that ſtray, and that loſe themſelves by ſtraying. But no man can be anſwerable for loſſes which he has not power to prevent, or for vagrancy which he has not authority to reſtrain.</p>
                  <p>As a teacher giving inſtruction for wages, and liable to reproach if thoſe whom he undertakes to inform make no proficiency, he muſt have the power of enforcing attendance, of awakening negligence, and repreſſing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction.</p>
                  <p>As a father, he poſſeſſes the paternal authority of admonition, rebuke, and puniſhment. He cannot without reducing his office to an empty name, be hindered from the exerciſe of any practice neceſſary to ſtimulate the idle, to reform the vicious, to check the petulant, and correct the ſtubborn.</p>
                  <p>If we enquire into the practice of the primitive church, we ſhall, I believe, find the miniſters of the Word exerciſing the whole authority of this complicated character. We ſhall find them not only encouraging the good by exhortation, but terrifying the wicked by reproof and denunciation. In the earlieſt ages of the Church, while religion was yet pure from ſecular advantages, the puniſhment of ſinners was publick cenſure, and open penance; penalties inflicted merely by eccleſiaſtical authority, at a time while the church had yet no help from the civil power, while the hand of the magiſtrate lifted only the rod of perſecution; and when governours were ready to afford a refuge to all thoſe who fled from clerical authority.</p>
                  <p>That the Church, therefore, had once a power of publick cenſure is evident, becauſe that power was frequently exerciſed. That it borrowed not its power from the civil authority, is likewiſe certain, becauſe civil authority was at that time its enemy.</p>
                  <p>The hour came at length, when after three hundred years of ſtruggle and diſtreſs, Truth took poſſeſſion of imperial power, and the civil laws lent their aid to the eccleſiaſtical conſtitutions. The magiſtrate from that time co-operated
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0548300102:77"/>
 with the prieſt, and clerical ſentences were made efficacious by ſecular force. But the State, when it came to the aſſiſtance of the Church, had no intention to diminiſh its authority. Thoſe rebukes and thoſe cenſures which were lawful before, were lawful ſtill. But they had hitherto operated only upon voluntary ſubmiſſion. The refractory and contemptuous were at firſt in no danger of temporal ſeverities, except what they might ſuffer from the reproaches of conſcience, or the deteſtation of their fellow Chriſtians. When religion obtained the ſupport of law, if admonitions and cenſures had no effect, they were ſeconded by the magiſtrates with coercion and puniſhment.</p>
                  <p>It therefore appears from eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, that the right of inflicting ſhame by publick cenſure, has been always conſidered as inherent in the Church; and that this right was not conferred by the civil power; for, it was exerciſed when the civil power operated againſt it. By the civil power it was never taken away; for the Chriſtian magiſtrate interpoſed his office not to reſcue ſinners from cenſure, but to ſupply more powerful means of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation; to add pain where ſhame was inſufficient; and when men were proclaimed unworthy of the ſociety of the faithful, to reſtrain them by impriſonment, from ſpreading abroad the contagion of wickedneſs.</p>
                  <p>It is not improbable that from this acknowledged power of publick cenſure, grew in time the practice of auricular confeſſion. Thoſe who dreaded the blaſt of publick reprehenſion, were willing to ſubmit themſelves to the prieſt, by a private accuſation of themſelves; and to obtain a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with the Church by a kind of clandeſtine abſolution and inviſible penance; conditions with which the prieſt would in times of ignorance and corruption eaſily comply, as they increaſed his influence, by adding the knowledge of ſecret ſins to that of notorious offences, and enlarged his authority, by making him the ſole arbiter of the terms of reconcilement.</p>
                  <p>From this bondage the Reformation ſet us free. The miniſter has no longer power to preſs into the retirements of conſcience, to torture us by interrogatories, or put himſelf in poſſeſſion of our ſecrets and our lives. But though we have thus controuled his uſurpations, his juſt and original power remains unimpaired. He may ſtill ſee, though he may not pry: he may yet hear, though he may not queſtion. And that knowledge which his eyes and ears force upon him it is ſtill his duty to uſe, for the benefit of his flock. A father who lives near a wicked neighbour, may forbid a ſon to frequent his company. A miniſter who has in his congregation a man of open and ſcandalous wickedneſs, may warn his pariſhioners to ſhun his converſation. To warn them is not only lawful, but not to warn them would be criminal.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0548300102:78"/>
He may warn them one by one in friendly converſe, or by a parochial  viſitation. But if he may warn each man ſingly, what ſhall forbid him to warn them all together? Of that which is to be made known to all, how is there any difference whether it be communicated to each ſingly, or to all together? What is known to all, muſt neceſſarily be publick. Whether it ſhall be publick at once, or publick by degrees, is the only queſtion. And of a ſudden and ſolemn publication the impreſſion is deeper, and the warning more effectual.</p>
                  <p>It may eaſily be urged, if a miniſter be thus left at liberty to delate ſinners from the pulpit, and to publiſh at will the crimes of a pariſhioner, he may often blaſt the innocent, and diſtreſs the timorous. He may be ſuſpicious, and condemn without evidence; he may be raſh, and judge without examination; he may be ſevere, and treat ſlight offences with too much harſhneſs; he may be malignant and partial, and gratify his private intereſt or reſentment, under the ſhelter of his paſtoral character.</p>
                  <p>Of all this there is poſſibility, and of all this there is danger. But if poſſibility of evil be to exclude good, no good ever can be done. If nothing is to be attempted in which there is danger, we muſt all ſink into hopeleſs inactivity. The evils that may be feared from this practice ariſe not from any defect in the inſtitution, but from the infirmities of human nature. Power, in whatever hands it is placed, will be ſometimes improperly exerted; yet courts of law muſt judge, though they will ſometimes judge amiſs. A father muſt inſtruct his children, though he himſelf may often want in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. A miniſter muſt cenſure ſinners, though his cenſure may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times erroneous by want of judgement, and ſometimes unjuſt by want of honeſty.</p>
                  <p>If we examine the circumſtances of the preſent caſe, we ſhall find the ſentence neither erroneous nor unjuſt; we ſhall find no breach of private confidence, no intruſion into ſecret tranſactions. The fact was notorious and indubitable; ſo eaſy to be proved, that no proof was deſired. The act was baſe and treacherous, the perpetration inſolent and open, and the example naturally miſchievous. The miniſter, however, being retired and recluſe, had not yet heard what was publickly known throughout the pariſh; and on occaſion of a publick election, warned his people, according to his duty, againſt the crimes which publick elections frequently produce. His warning was felt by one of his pariſhoners, as pointed particularly at himſelf. But inſtead of producing as might be wiſhed, private compunction and immediate reformation, it kindled only rage and reſentment. He charged his miniſter,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0548300102:79"/>
 in a publick paper, with ſcandal, defamation, and falſehood. The miniſter, thus reproached, had his own character to vindicate, upon which his paſtoral authority muſt neceſſarily depend. To be charged with a defamatory lie is an injury which no man patiently endures in common life. To be charged with polluting the paſtoral office with ſcandal and falſehood was a violation of character ſtill more atrocious, as it affected not only his perſonal but his clerical veracity. His indignation naturally roſe in proportion to his honeſty, and with all the fortitude of injured honeſty, he dared this calumniator in the church, and at once exonerated himſelf from cenſure, and reſcued his flock from deception and from danger. The man whom he accuſes pretends not to be innocent; or at leaſt only pretends, for he declines a trial. The crime of which he is accuſed has frequent opportunities and ſtrong temptations. It has already ſpread far, with much depravation of private morals, and much injury to publick happineſs. To warn the people, therefore, againſt it was not wanton and officious, but neceſſary and paſtoral.</p>
                  <p>What then is the fault with which this worthy miniſter is charged? He has uſurped no dominion over conſcience. He has exerted no authority in ſupport of doubtful and controverted opinions. He has not dragged into light a baſhful and corrigible ſinner. His cenſure was directed againſt a breach of morality, againſt an act which no man juſtifies. The man who appropriated this cenſure to himſelf, is evidently and notoriouſly guilty. His conſciouſneſs of his own wickedneſs incited him to attack his faithful reprover with open inſolence and painted accuſations. Such an attack made defence neceſſary, and we hope it will be at laſt decided that the means of defence were juſt and lawful.</p>

                           <p>I DON'T think the appeal adviſeable: not only becauſe the value of the judgement is in no degree adequate to the expence, but becauſe there are many chances, that, upon the general complexion of the caſe, the impreſſion will be taken to the diſadvantage of the appellant.</p>
                           <p>It is impoſſible to approve the ſtyle of that ſermon. But the <hi>complaint</hi> was not leſs ungracious from that man, who had behaved ſo ill by his original libel, and, at the time, when he received the reproach he complains of. In the laſt article all the plaintiffs are equally concerned.

                           <p>Upon the matter, however, I agree with them in condemning the behaviour of the miniſter; and in thinking it a ſubject fit for eccleſiaſtical cenſure; and even for an action, if any individual could qualify<note n="9" place="bottom">It is curious to obſerve that Lord Thurlow has here, perhaps in compliment to North-Britain, made uſe of a term of the Scotch law, which to an Engliſh reader may require explanation. To <hi>qualify</hi> a wrong, is to point out and eſtabliſh it.</note> a wrong, and a damage ariſing from it. But this I doubt. The circumſtance of publiſhing the reproach in a pulpit, though extremely indecent, and culpable in another view, does not conſtitute a different ſort of wrong, or any other rule of law, than would have obtained, if the ſame words had been pronounced elſewhere. I don't know, whether there be any difference in the law of Scotland, in the definition of ſlander, before the Commiſſaries, or the Court of Seſſion. The common law of England does not give way to actions for every reproachful word. An action cannot be brought for general damages, upon any words

Both laws admit the truth to be a juſtification in actions <hi>for words;</hi> and the law of England does the ſame in actions for libels. The judgement, therefore, ſeems to me to have been wrong, in that the Court repelled that defence.</p>

               <p>I am now to record a very curious incident in Dr. Johnſon's Life, which fell under my own obſervation; of which <hi>pars magna fui,</hi> and which I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded will, with the liberal-minded, be much to his credit.</p>
               <p>My deſire of being acquainted with celebrated men of every deſcription, had made me, much about the ſame time, obtain an introduction to Dr. Samuel Johnſon and to John Wilkes, Eſq. Two men more different could perhaps not be ſelected out from all mankind. They had even attacked one another with ſome aſperity in their writings; yet I lived in habits of friendſhip with both. I could fully reliſh the excellence of each; for I have ever delighted in that intellectual chymiſtry which can ſeparate good qualities from evil in the ſame perſon.</p>
               <p>Sir John Pringle, <q rend="inline">"mine own friend and my Father's friend,"</q> between whom and Dr. Johnſon I in vain wiſhed to eſtabliſh an acquaintance, as I reſpected and lived in intimacy with both of them, obſerved to me once, very ingeniouſly, <q rend="inline">"It is not in friendſhip as in mathematicks, where two things, each equal to a third, are equal between themſelves. You agree with Johnſon as a middle quality, and you agree with me as a middle quality; but Johnſon and I ſhould not agree."</q> Sir John was not ſufficiently flexible; ſo I deſiſted; knowing, indeed, that the repulſion was equally ſtrong on the part of Johnſon; who, I know not from what cauſe, unleſs his being a Scotchman, had formed a very erroneous opinion of Sir John. But I conceived an irreſiſtible wiſh, if poſſible, to bring Dr. Johnſon and Mr. Wilkes together. How to manage it, was a nice and difficult matter.</p>
               <p>My worthy bookſellers and friends, Meſſieurs Dillys in the Poultry, at whoſe hoſpitable and well-covered table I have ſeen a greater number of literary men than at any other, except that of Sir Joſhua Reynolds, had invited me to meet Mr. Wilkes and ſome more gentlemen on Wedneſday, May 15. <q rend="inline">"Pray (ſaid I,) let us have Dr. Johnſon."</q>—<q rend="inline">"What, with Mr. Wilkes? not for the world, (ſaid Mr. Edward Dilly): Dr. Johnſon would never forgive me."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Come, (ſaid I,) if you'll let me negociate for you, I will be anſwerable
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0548300102:82" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that all ſhall go well."</q> DILLY. <q rend="inline">"Nay, if you will take it upon you, I am  ſure I ſhall be very happy to ſee them both here."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the high veneration which I entertained for Dr. Johnſon, I was ſenſible that he was ſometimes a little actuated by the ſpirit of contradic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by means of that I hoped I ſhould gain my point. I was perſuaded that if I had come upon him with a direct propoſal, <q rend="inline">"Sir, will you dine in company with Jack Wilkes?"</q> he would have flown into a paſſion, and would probably have anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Dine with Jack Wilkes, Sir! I'd as ſoon dine with Jack Ketch<note place="bottom">This has been circulated as if actually ſaid by Johnſon, when the truth is it w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">

I will wait upon him—"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Provided, Sir, I ſuppoſe, that the company which he is to have is agreeable to you."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"What do you mean, Sir? What do you take me for? Do you think I am ſo ignorant of the world, as to imagine that I am to preſcribe to a gentleman what company he is to have at his table?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I beg your pardon, Sir, for wiſhing to prevent you from meeting people whom you might not like. Perhaps he may have ſome of what he calls his patriotick friends with him."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, and what then? What care <hi>I</hi> for his <hi>patriotick friends?</hi> Poh!"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I ſhould not be ſurprized to find Jack Wilkes there."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"And if Jack Wilkes <hi>ſhould</hi> be there, what is that to <hi>me,</hi> Sir? My dear friend, let us have no more of this. I am ſorry to be angry with you; but really it is treating me ſtrangely to talk to me as if I could not meet any company whatever, occaſionally."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Pray forgive me, Sir: I meant well. But you ſhall meet whoever comes, for me."</q> Thus I ſecured him, and told Dilly that he would find him very well pleaſed to be one of his gueſts on the day appointed.</p>
               <p>Upon the much-expected Wedneſday, I called on him about half an hour before dinner, as I often did when we were to dine out together, to ſee that he was ready in time, and to accompany him. I found him buffeting his books, as upon a former occaſion <hi rend="sup">1</hi>
                  <note place="bottom">See page 47 of this volume.</note>, covered with duſt, and making no preparation for going abroad. <q rend="inline">"How is this, Sir? (ſaid I). Don't you recollect that you are to dine at Mr. Dilly's?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I did not
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0548300102:83"/>
 think of going to Dilly's: it went out of my head. I have ordered dinner at home with Mrs. Williams."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, my dear Sir, you know you were engaged to Mr. Dilly, and I told him ſo. He will expect you, and will be much diſappointed if you don't come."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You muſt talk to Mrs. Williams about this."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here was a ſad dilemma. I feared that what I was ſo confident I had ſecured would yet be fruſtrated. He had accuſtomed himſelf to ſhew Mrs. Williams ſuch a degree of humane attention, as frequently impoſed ſome reſtraint upon him; and I knew that if ſhe ſhould be obſtinate, he would not ſtir. I haſtened down ſtairs to the blind lady's room, and told her I was in great uneaſineſs, for Dr. Johnſon had engaged to me to dine this day at Mr. Dilly's, but that he had told me he had forgotten his engagement, and had ordered dinner at home. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, (ſaid ſhe, pretty peeviſhly,) Dr. Johnſon is to dine at home."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Madam, (ſaid I,) his reſpect for you is ſuch, that I know he will not leave you unleſs you abſolutely deſire it. But as you have ſo much of his company, I hope you will be good enough to forego it for a day, as Mr. Dilly is a very worthy man, has frequently had agreeable parties at his houſe for Dr. Johnſon, and will be vexed if the Doctor neglects him to-day. And then, Madam, be pleaſed to conſider my ſituation;—I carried the meſſage, and I aſſured Mr. Dilly that Dr. Johnſon was to come, and no doubt he has made a dinner, and invited a company, and boaſted of the honour he expected to have. I ſhall be quite diſgraced if the Doctor is not there."</q> She gradually ſoftened to my ſolicitations, which were certainly as earneſt as moſt entreaties to ladies upon any occaſion, and was graciouſly pleaſed to empower me to tell Dr. Johnſon, <q rend="inline">"That all things conſidered, ſhe thought he ſhould certainly go."</q> I flew back to him, ſtill in duſt, and careleſs of what ſhould be the event, <q rend="inline">"indifferent in his choice to go or ſtay;"</q> but as ſoon as I had announced to him Mrs. Williams's conſent, he roared, <q rend="inline">"Frank, a clean ſhirt,"</q> and was very ſoon dreſt. When I had him fairly ſeated in a hackney-coach with me, I exulted as much as a ſortune-hunter who has got an heireſs into a poſt-chaiſe with him to ſet out for Gretna-Green.</p>
               <p>When we entered Mr. Dilly's drawing-room, he found himſelf in the midſt of a company he did not know. I kept myſelf ſnug and ſilent, watching how he would conduct himſelf. I obſerved him whiſpering to Mr. Dilly, <q rend="inline">"Who is that gentleman, Sir?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Mr. Arthur Lee."</q>—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Tut, tut, tut,"</q> (under his breath,) which was one of his habitual mutterings. Mr. Arthur Lee could not but be very obnoxious to Johnſon, for he was not only a <hi>patriot</hi> but an <hi>American.</hi> He was afterwards miniſter from the United States at the court
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0548300102:84" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of Madrid. <q rend="inline">"And who is the gentleman in lace?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Mr. Wilkes, Sir."</q>  This information confounded him ſtill more; he had ſome difficulty to reſtrain himſelf, and taking up a book, ſat down upon a window-ſeat and read, or at leaſt kept his eye upon it intently for ſome time, till he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed himſelf. His feelings, I dare ſay, were aukward enough. But he no doubt recollected his having rated me for ſuppoſing that he could be at all diſconcerted by any company, and he, therefore, reſolutely ſet himſelf to behave quite as an eaſy man of the world, who could adapt himſelf at once to the diſpoſition and manners of thoſe whom he might chance to meet.</p>
               <p>The cheering ſound of <q rend="inline">"Dinner is upon the table,"</q> diſſolved his reverie, and we <hi>all</hi> ſat down without any ſymptom of ill humour. There were preſent, beſides Mr. Wilkes, and Mr. Arthur Lee, who was an old companion of mine when he ſtudied phyſick at Edinburgh, Mr. (now Sir John) Miller, Dr. Lettſom, and Mr. Slater the druggiſt. Mr. Wilkes placed himſelf next to Dr. Johnſon, and behaved to him with ſo much attention and politeneſs, that he gained upon him inſenſibly. No man eat more heartily than Johnſon, or loved better what was nice and delicate. Mr. Wilkes was very aſſiduous in helping him to ſome fine veal. <q rend="inline">"Pray give me leave, Sir:—It is better here—A little of the brown—Some fat, Sir—A little of the ſtuffing—Some gravy—Let me have the pleaſure of giving you ſome butter—Allow me to recommend a ſqueeze of this orange—or the lemon, perhaps, may have more zeſt."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Sir, Sir, I am obliged to you, Sir,"</q> cried Johnſon, bowing, and turning his head to him with a look for ſome time of <q rend="inline">"ſurly virtue <note n="2" place="bottom">Johnſon's <q rend="inline">"London, a Poem,"</q> v. 145.</note>,"</q> but, in a ſhort while, of complacency.</p>
               <p>Foote being mentioned, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He is not a good mimick."</q> One of the company added, <q rend="inline">"A merry Andrew, a buffoon."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But he has wit too, and is not deficient in ideas, or in fertility and variety of imagery, and not empty of reading; he has knowledge enough to fill up his part. One ſpecies of wit he has in an eminent degree, that of eſcape. You drive him into a corner with both hands; but he's gone, Sir, when you think you have got him—like an animal that jumps over your head. Then he has a great range for his wit; he never lets truth ſtand between him and a jeſt, and he is ſometimes mighty coarſe. Garrick is under many reſtraints from which Foote is free."</q> WILKES. <q rend="inline">"Garrick's wit is more like Lord Cheſterfield's."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"The firſt time I was in company with Foote was at Fitzherbert's. Having no good opinion of the fellow, I was reſolved not to be pleaſed, and it is very difficult to pleaſe a man againſt his will. I went
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0548300102:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 on eating my dinner pretty ſullenly, affecting not to mind him. But the dog was ſo very comical, that I was obliged to lay down my knife and fork, throw myſelf back upon my chair, and fairly laugh it out. No, Sir, he was irreſiſtible <note n="3" place="bottom">Foote told me that Johnſon ſaid of him, <q rend="inline">"For loud obſtreperous broad-ſaced mirth, I know not his equal."</q>
                     </note>.</q> He upon one occaſion experienced, in an extraordinary degree, the efficacy of his powers of entertaining. Amongſt the many and various modes which he tried of getting money, he became a partner with a ſmall-beer brewer, and he was to have a ſhare of the profits for procuring cuſtomers amongſt his numerous acquaintance. Fitzherbert was one who took his ſmall-beer; but it was ſo bad that the ſervants reſolved not to drink it. They were at ſome loſs how to notify their reſolution, being afraid of offending their maſter, who they knew liked Foote much as a companion. At laſt they fixed upon a little black boy, who was rather a favourite, to be their deputy, and deliver their remonſtrance; and having inveſted him with the whole authority of the kitchen, he was to inform Mr. Fitzherbert, in all their names, upon a certain day, that they would drink Foote's ſmall-beer no longer. On that day Foote happened to dine at Fitzherbert's, and this boy ſerved at table; he was ſo delighted with Foote's ſtories, and merriment, and grimace, that when he went down ſtairs, he told them, <q rend="inline">"This is the fineſt man I have ever ſeen. I will not deliver your meſſage. I will drink his ſmall-beer."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Somebody obſerved that Garrick could not have done this. WILKES. <q rend="inline">"Garrick would have made the ſmall-beer ſtill ſmaller. He is now leaving the ſtage, but he will play <hi>Scrub</hi> all his life."</q> I knew that Johnſon would let nobody attack Garrick but himſelf, as Garrick once ſaid to me, and I had heard him praiſe his liberality; ſo to bring out his commendation of his celebrated pupil, I ſaid, loudly, <q rend="inline">"I have heard Garrick is liberal."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, I know that Garrick has given away more money than any man in England that I am acquainted with, and that not from oſtentatious views. Garrick was very poor when he began life; ſo when he came to have money, he probably was very unſkilful in giving away, and ſaved when he ſhould not. But Garrick began to be liberal as ſoon as he could; and I am of opinion, the reputation of avarice which he has had, has been very lucky for him, and prevented his having many enemies. You deſpiſe a man for avarice, but do not hate him. Garrick might have been much better attacked for living with more ſplendour than is ſuitable to a player: if they had had the wit to have aſſaulted him in that quarter, they might have galled him more. But
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0548300102:86" rendition="simple:additions"/>
they have kept clamouring about his avarice, which has reſcued him from  much obloquy and envy."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of the great difficulty of obtaining authentick information for biography, Johnſon told us, <q rend="inline">"When I was a young fellow I wanted to write the 'Life of Dryden,' and in order to get materials, I applied to the only two perſons then alive who had ſeen him; theſe were old Swiney, and old Cibber. Swiney's information was no more than this, 'That at Will's coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe Dryden had a particular chair for himſelf, which was ſet by the fire in winter, and was then called his winter-chair; and that it was carried out for him to the balcony in ſummer, and was then called his ſummer-chair.' Cibber could tell no more but 'That he remembered him a decent old man, arbiter of critical diſputes at Will's.' You are to conſider that Cibber was then at a great diſtance from Dryden, had perhaps one leg only in the room, and durſt not draw in the other."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yet Cibber was a man of obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I think not."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"You will allow his 'Apology' to be well done."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Very well done, to be ſure, Sir. That book is a ſtriking proof of the juſtice of Pope's remark:
<q>
                        <l>'Each might his ſeveral province well command,</l>
                        <l>'Would all but ſtoop to what they underſtand."</l>
                     </q>
                  </q>
BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"And his plays are good."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes; but that was his trade; <hi>l'eſprit du corps;</hi> he had been all his life among players and play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writers. I wondered that he had ſo little to ſay in converſation, for he had kept the beſt company, and learnt all that can be got by the ear. He abuſed Pindar to me, and then ſhewed me an Ode of his own, with an abſurd coupler, making a linnet ſoar on an eagle's wing <note n="4" place="bottom">See page 217 of Vol. I.</note>. I told him that when the ancients made a ſimile, they always made it like ſomething real."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Wilkes remarked, that <q rend="inline">"among all the bold ſlights of Shakſpeare's imagination, the boldeſt was making Birnam-wood march to Dunſinane; creating a wood where there never was a ſhrub; a wood in Scotland! ha! ha! ha!"</q> And he alſo obſerved, that <q rend="inline">"the clanniſh ſlavery of the Highlands of Scotland was the ſingle exception to Milton's remark of 'The Mountain Nymph, ſweet Liberty,' being worſhipped in all hilly countries."</q>—<q rend="inline">"When I was at Inverary (ſaid he,) on a viſit to my old friend, Archibald, Duke of Argyle, his dependents congratulated me on being ſuch a favourite of his Grace. I ſaid, 'It is then, gentlemen, truly lucky for me; for if I had
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0548300102:87"/>
 diſpleaſed the Duke, and he had wiſhed it, there is not a Campbell among you but would have been ready to bring John Wilkes's head to him in a charger. It would have been only

I was then member for Ayleſbury."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon and Mr. Wilkes talked of the conteſted paſſage in Horace's <q rend="inline">"Art of Poetry,"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Difficile eſt propriè communia dicere."</q> Mr. Wilkes, according to my note, gave the interpretation thus: <q rend="inline">"It is difficult to ſpeak with propriety of common things; as, if a poet had to ſpeak of Queen Caroline drinking tea, he muſt endeavour to avoid the vulgarity of cups and ſaucers."</q> But upon reading my note, he tells me that he meant to ſay, that <q rend="inline">"the word <hi>communia,</hi> being a Roman law term, ſignifies here things <hi>communis juris,</hi> that is to ſay, what have never yet been treated by any body; and this appears clearly from what followed,

The contrary is implied in what he urges about the ſuperiour difficulty of the latter, from which he diſſuades his country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, only in reſpect of their abilities and inexperience in theſe matters; and in order to cultivate in them, which is the main view of the Epiſtle, a ſpirit of correctneſs, by ſending them to the old ſubjects, treated by the Greek writers."</q>

                     <p>For my own part (with all deference for Dr. Hurd, who thinks the <hi>caſe clear,)</hi> I conſider the paſſage, <q rend="inline">"Difficile eſt propriè communia dicere,"</q> to be a <hi>crux</hi> for the criticks on Horace.</p>
                     <p>The explication which My Lord of Worceſter treats with ſo much contempt, is nevertheleſs countenanced by authority which I find quoted by the learned Baxter, in his edition of Horace, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Difficile eſt propriè communia dicere,</hi> h. e. res vulgares diſertis verbis enarrare, vel humile thema cum dignitate tractare. <hi>Difficile eſt communes res propriis explicare verbis.</hi> Vet.

                     <p>After all, I cannot help entertaining ſome doubt whether the words, <q rend="inline">"Difficile eſt propriè communia dicere,"</q> may not have been thrown in by Horace to form a <hi>ſeparate</hi> article in a <q rend="inline">"choice of difficulties"</q> which a poet has to encounter, who chooſes a new ſubject; in which caſe it muſt be uncertain which of the various explanations is the true one, and every reader has a right to decide as it may ſtrike his own fancy. And even ſhould the words be underſtood as they generally are, to be connected both with what goes before, and what comes after, the exact ſenſe cannot be abſolutely aſcertained; for inſtance, whether <hi>propriè</hi> is meant to ſignify <hi>in an appropriated manner,</hi> as Dr. Johnſon here underſtands it, or, as it is often uſed by Cicero, <hi>with propriety,</hi> or <hi>elegantly.</hi> In ſhort, it is a rare inſtance of a defect in perſpicuity in an admirable writer, who with almoſt every ſpecies of excellence, is peculiarly remarkable for that quality. The length of this note perhaps requires an apology. Many of my readers, I doubt not, will admit that a critical diſcuſſion of a paſſage in a favourite claſſick is very engaging.</p>

               <p>Mr. Arthur Lee mentioned ſome Scotch who had taken poſſeſſion of a barren part of America, and wondered why they ſhould chooſe it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, all barrenneſs is comparative. The <hi>Scotch</hi> would not know it to be barren."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Come, come, he is flattering the Engliſh. You have now been in Scotland, Sir, and ſay if you did not ſee meat and drink enough there."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir; meat and drink enough to give the inhabitants ſufficient ſtrength to run away from home."</q> All theſe quick and lively ſallies were ſaid ſportively, quite in jeſt, and with a ſmile, which ſhowed that he meant only wit. Upon this topick he and Mr. Wilkes could perfectly aſſimilate; here was a bond of union between them, and I was conſcious that as both of them had viſited Caledonia, both were fully ſatisfied of the ſtrange narrow ignorance of thoſe who imagine that it is a land of famine. But they amuſed themſelves with perſevering in the old jokes. When I claimed a ſuperiority for Scotland over Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in one reſpect, that no man can be arreſted there for a debt merely becauſe another ſwears it againſt him; but there muſt firſt be the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a court of law aſcertaining its juſtice; and that a ſeizure of the

(to Mr. Wilkes) <q rend="inline">"You muſt know, Sir, I lately took my friend Boſwell and ſhewed him genuine civiliſed life in an Engliſh provincial town. I turned him looſe at Lichfield, my native city, that he might ſee for once real civility: for you know he lives among ſavages in Scotland, and among rakes in London."</q> WILKES. <q rend="inline">"Except when he is with grave, ſober, decent people like you and me."</q> JOHNSON. (ſmiling) <q rend="inline">"And we aſhamed of him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>They were quite frank and eaſy. Johnſon told the ſtory of his aſking Mrs. Macaulay to allow her footman to ſit down with them, to prove the ridiculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the argument for the equality of mankind; and he ſaid to me afterwards, with a nod of ſatisfaction, <q rend="inline">"You ſaw Mr. Wilkes acquieſced."</q> Wilkes talked with all imaginable freedom of the ludicrous title given to the Attorney-General, <hi>Diabolus Regis,</hi> adding, <q rend="inline">"I have reaſon to know ſomething about that officer, for I was proſecuted for a libel."</q> Johnſon, who many people would have ſuppoſed muſt have been furiouſly angry at hearing this talked of ſo lightly, ſaid not a word. He was now, <hi>indeed,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"a good-humoured fellow."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After dinner we had an acceſſion of Mrs. Knowles, the Quaker lady, well known for her various talents, and of Mr. Alderman Lee. Amidſt ſome patriotick groans, ſomebody (I think the Alderman) ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Poor Old England is loſt."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is not ſo much to be lamented that Old Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land is loſt, as that the Scotch have found it <note n="6" place="bottom">It would not become me to expatiate on this ſtrong and pointed remark, in which a very great deal of meaning is condenſed.</note>."</q> WILKES. <q rend="inline">"Had Lord Bute governed Scotland only, I ſhould not have taken the trouble to write his eulogy, and dedicate 'MORTIMER' to him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Wilkes held a candle to ſhew a fine print of a beautiful female figure which hung in the room, and pointed out the elegant contour of the boſom with the finger of an arch connoiſſeur. He afterwards waggiſhly inſiſted with me, that all the time Johnſon ſhewed viſible ſigns of a ſervant admiration of the correſponding charms of the fair Quaker.</p>
               <p>This record, though by no means ſo perfect as I could wiſh, will ſerve to give a notion of a very curious interview, which was not only pleaſing at the time, but had the agreeable and benignant effect of reconciling any

 animoſity, and ſweetening any acidity, which in the various buſtle of political conteſt, had been produced in the minds of two men, who though widely different, had ſo many things in common—claſſical learning, modern litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wit, and humour, and ready repartee—that it would have been much to be regretted if they had been for ever at a diſtance from each other.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke gave me much credit for this ſucceſsful <hi>negociation;</hi> and pleaſantly ſaid, that <q rend="inline">"there was nothing to equal it in the whole hiſtory of the <hi>Corps Diplomatique.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>I attended Dr. Johnſon home, and had the ſatisfaction to hear him tell Mrs. Williams how much he had been pleaſed with Mr. Wilkes's company, and what an agreeable day he had paſſed.</p>
               <p>I talked a good deal to him of the celebrated Margaret Caroline Rudd, whom I had viſited, induced by the fame of her talents, addreſs, and irreſiſtible power of faſcination. To a lady who diſapproved of my viſiting her, he ſaid on a former occaſion, <q rend="inline">"Nay, Madam, Boſwell is in the right; I ſhould have viſited her myſelf, were it not that they have now a trick of putting every thing into the newſpapers."</q> This evening he exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"I envy him his acquaintance with Mrs. Rudd."</q>

               <p>How very falſe is the notion which has gone round the world of the rough, and paſſionate, and harſh manners of this great and good man. That he had occaſional ſallies of heat of temper, and that he was ſometimes, perhaps, too <q rend="inline">"eaſily provoked"</q> by abſurdity and folly, and ſometimes too deſirous of triumph in colloquial conteſt, muſt be allowed. The quickneſs both of his perception and ſenſibility diſpoſed him to ſudden exploſions of ſatire; to which his extraordinary readineſs of wit was a ſtrong and almoſt irreſiſtible incitement.

               <p>That he was occaſionally remarkable for violence of temper may be granted: but let us aſcertain the degree, and not let it be ſuppoſed that he was in a perpetual rage, and never without a club in his hand, to knock down every one who approached him. On the contrary, the truth is, that by much the greateſt part of his time he was civil, obliging, nay, polite in the true ſenſe of the word; ſo much ſo, that many gentlemen, who were long acquainted with him, never received, or even heard a ſevere expreſſion from him.</p>
               <p>It was, I think, after I had left London this year, that an Epitaph, which Dr. Johnſon had written for the monument of Dr. Goldſmith in Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter-Abbey, gave occaſion to a <hi>Remonſtrance</hi> to the MONARCH OF LITERATURE, for an account of which I am indebted to Sir William Forbes, of Pitſligo.</p>

                  <p>I encloſe the <hi>Round Robin.</hi> This <hi>jeu d'eſprit</hi> took its riſe one day at dinner at our friend Sir Joſhua Reynolds's. All the company preſent, except myſelf, were friends and acquaintance of Dr. Goldſmith. The Epitaph, written for him by Dr. Johnſon, became the ſubject of converſation, and various emendations were ſuggeſted, which it was agreed ſhould be ſubmitted to the Doctor's conſideration.—But the queſtion was, who ſhould have the courage to propoſe them to him? At laſt it was hinted, that there could be no way ſo good as that of a <hi>Round Robin,</hi> as the ſailors call it, which they make uſe of when they enter into a conſpiracy, ſo as not to let it be known who puts his name firſt or laſt to the paper. This propoſition was inſtantly aſſented to; and Dr. Barnard, Dean of Derry, now Biſhop of Killaloe, drew up an addreſs to Dr. Johnſon on the occaſion, replete with wit and humour, but which it was feared the Doctor might think treated the ſubject with too much levity. Mr. Burke then propoſed the addreſs as it ſtands in the paper in writing, to which I had the honour to officiate as clerk.</p>
                  <p>Sir Joſhua agreed to carry it to Dr. Johnſon, who received it with much good humour <note n="7" place="bottom">He however, upon ſeeing Dr. Warton's name to the ſuggeſtion that the Epitaph ſhould be in Engliſh, obſerved to Sir Joſhua, <q rend="inline">"I wonder that Joe Warton, a ſcholar by profeſſion, ſhould be ſuch a fool."</q> Mr. Langton, who was one of the company at Sir Joſhua's, like a ſturdy ſcholar, reſolutely refuſed to ſign the <hi>Round Robin.</hi> The epitaph is engraved upon Dr. Goldſmith's monument without any alteration.</note>, and deſired Sir Joſhua to tell the gentlemen, that he would alter the Epitaph in any manner they pleaſed, as to the ſenſe of it; but <hi>he would never conſent to diſgrace the walls of Weſtminſter Abbey with an Engliſh inſcription.</hi>

The anecdote now related  proves, in the ſtrongeſt manner, the reverence and awe with which Johnſon was regarded, by ſome of the moſt eminent men of his time in various departments, and even by ſuch of them as lived moſt with him; while it alſo confirms what I have again and again inculcated, that he was by no means of that ferocious and iraſcible character which has been ignorantly imagined.</p>
               <p>This haſty compoſition is alſo to be remarked as one of a thouſand inſtances which evince the extraordinary promptitude of Mr. Burke; who while he is equal to the greateſt things, can adorn the leaſt; can, with equal facility, embrace the vaſt and complicated ſpeculations of politicks, or the ingenious topicks of literary inveſtigation.</p>
               <p>Beſides this Latin Epitaph, Johnſon honoured the memory of his friend Goldſmith with a ſhort one in Greek, which has been obligingly communicated to me by my learned and ingenious friend Dr. Percy, the Biſhop of Dromore. His Lordſhip procured it from a gentleman in Ireland, who had it from Johnſon himſelf, Mr. Archdall, who was educated under Dr. Sumner, at Harrow.</p>

                     <p>I MAKE haſte to write again, leſt my laſt letter ſhould give you too much pain. If you are really oppreſſed with overpowering and involuntary melancholy, you are to be pitied rather than reproached. * * * * *.</p>
                     <p>Now, my dear Bozzy, let us have done with quarrels and with cenſure. Let me know whether I have not ſent you a pretty library. There are, perhaps, many books among them which you need never read through; but there are none which it is not proper for you to know, and ſometimes to conſult. Of theſe books, of which the uſe is only occaſional, it is often ſufficient to know the contents, that, when any queſtion ariſes, you may know where to look for information.</p>
                     <p>Since I wrote, I have looked over Mr. Maclaurin's plea, and think it excellent. How is the ſuit carried on? If by ſubſcription, I commiſſion you to contribute, in my name, what is proper. Let nothing be wanting in ſuch a caſe. Dr. Drummond <note n="1" place="bottom">The ſon of Johnſon's old friend, Mr. William Drummond. (See Vol. I. p. 286.)

                     <p>Langton's lady has brought him a girl, and both are well; I dined with him the other day. * * * * *.</p>
                     <p>It vexes me to tell you, that on the evening of the 29th of May I was ſeized by the gout, and am not quite well. The pain has not been violent,

                     <p>I HAD great pleaſure in hearing that you are at laſt on good terms with your father. Cultivate his kindneſs by all honeſt and manly means. Life is but ſhort; no time can be afforded but for the indulgence of real ſorrow, or conteſts upon queſtions ſeriouſly momentous. Let us not throw any of our days away upon uſeleſs reſentment, or contend who ſhall hold out longeſt in ſtubborn malignity. It is beſt not to be angry, and beſt, in the next place, to be quickly reconciled. May you and your father paſs the remainder of your time in reciprocal benevolence!</p>
                     <p>Do you ever hear from Mr. Langton? I viſit him ſometimes, but he does not talk. I do not like his ſcheme of life; but, as I am not permitted to underſtand it, I cannot ſet any thing right that is wrong. His children are ſweet babies.</p>
                     <p>I hope my irreconcileable enemy, Mrs. Boſwell, is well. Deſire her not to tranſmit her malevolence to the young people. Let me have Alexander, and Veronica, and Euphemia, for my friends.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Williams, whom you may reckon as one of your well-wiſhers, is in a feeble and languiſhing ſtate, with little hope of growing better. She went for ſome part of the autumn into the country, but is little benefited; and Dr. Lawrence confeſſes that his art is at an end. Death is, however, at a a diſtance; and what more than that can we ſay of ourſelves? I am ſorry for her pain, and more ſorry for her decay. Mr. Levett is ſound, wind and limb.</p>

I was ſome weeks this autumn at Brighthelmſton. The place was  very dull, and I was not well: the expedition to the Hebrides was the moſt pleaſant journey that I ever made. Such an effort annually would give the world a little diverſification.</p>
                     <p>Every year, however, we cannot wander, and muſt therefore endeavour to ſpend our time at home as well as we can. I believe it is beſt to throw life into a method, that every hour may bring its employment, and every employment have its hour. Xenophon obſerves, in his 'Treatiſe of Oeconomy,<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that if every thing be kept in a certain place, when any thing is worn out or conſumed, the vacuity which it leaves will ſhew what is wanting; ſo if every part of time has its duty, the hour will call into remembrance its proper engagement.</p>
                     <p>I have not practiſed all this prudence myſelf, but I have ſuffered much for want of it; and I would have you, by timely recollection and ſteady reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, eſcape from thoſe evils which have lain heavy upon me.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE been for ſome time ill of a cold, which, perhaps, I made an excuſe to myſelf for not writing, when in reality I knew not what to ſay.</p>
                     <p>The books you muſt at laſt diſtribute as you think beſt, in my name, or your own, as you are inclined, or as you judge moſt proper. Every body cannot be obliged, but I wiſh that nobody may be offended. Do the beſt you can.</p>
                     <p>I congratulate you on the increaſe of your family, and hope that little David is by this time well, and his mamma perfectly recovered. I am much pleaſed to hear of the re-eſtabliſhment of kindneſs between you and your father. Cultivate his paternal tenderneſs as much as you can. To live at
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0548300102:102" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 variance at all is uncomfortable; and variance with a father is ſtill more uncomfortable. Beſides that, in the whole diſpute you have the wrong ſide; at leaſt you gave the firſt provocations, and ſome of them very offenſive. Let it now be all over. As you have no reaſon to think that your new mother has ſhown you any foul play, treat her with reſpect, and with ſome degree of confidence; this will ſecure your father. When once a diſcordant family has felt the pleaſure of peace, they will not willingly loſe it. If Mrs. Boſwell would but be friends with me, we might now ſhut the temple of Janus.</p>
                     <p>What came of Dr. Memis's cauſe? Is the queſtion about the negro determined? Has Sir Allan any reaſonable hopes? What is become of poor Macquarry? Let me know the event of all theſe litigations. I wiſh particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly well to the negro and Sir Allan.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Williams has been much out of order; and though ſhe is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing better, is likely, in her phyſician's opinion, to endure her malady for life, though ſhe may, perhaps, die of ſome other. Mrs. Thrale is big, and fancies that ſhe carries a boy; if it were very reaſonable to wiſh much about it, I ſhould wiſh her not to be diſappointed. The deſire of male heirs is not appendant only to feudal tenures. A ſon is almoſt neceſſary to the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Thrale's fortune; for what can miſſes do with a brewhouſe? Lands are fitter for daughters than trades.</p>
                     <p>Baretti went away from Thrale's in ſome whimſical fit of diſguſt, or ill-nature, without taking any leave. It is well if he finds in any other place as good an habitation, and as many conveniences. He has got five-and-twenty guineas by tranſlating Sir Joſhua's Diſcourſes into Italian, and Mr. Thrale gave him an hundred in the ſpring; ſo that he is yet in no difficulties.</p>
                     <p>Colman has bought Foote's patent, and is to allow Foote for life ſixteen hundred pounds a year, as Reynolds told me, and to allow him to play ſo often on ſuch terms that he may gain four hundred pounds more. What Colman can get by this bargain, but trouble and hazard, I do not ſee.</p>

               <p>The Reverend Dr. Hugh Blair, who had long been admired as a preacher at Edinburgh, thought now of diffuſing his excellent ſermons more exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, and encreaſing his reputation, by publiſhing a collection of them. He tranſmitted the manuſcript to Mr. Strahan, the printer, who after keeping it for ſome time, wrote a letter to him, diſcouraging the publication. Such at
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0548300102:103" rendition="simple:additions"/>
firſt was the unpropitious ſtate of one of the moſt ſucceſsful theological books  that has ever appeared. Mr. Strahan, however, had ſent one of the ſermons to Dr. Johnſon for his opinion; and after his unfavourable letter to Dr. Blair had been ſent off, he received from Johnſon on Chriſtmas-eve, a note in which was the following paragraph:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I have read over Dr. Blair's firſt ſermon with more than approbation; to ſay it is good, is to ſay too little."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I believe Mr. Strahan had very ſoon after this time a converſation with Dr. Johnſon concerning them, and then he very candidly wrote again to Dr. Blair, encloſing Johnſon's note, and agreeing to purchaſe the volume, for which he and Mr. Cadell gave one hundred pounds. The ſale was ſo rapid and extenſive, and the approbation of the publick ſo high, that to their honour be it recorded, the proprietors made Dr. Blair a preſent firſt of one ſum, and afterwards of another, of fifty pounds, thus voluntarily doubling the ſtipulated price; and when he prepared another volume they gave him at once three hundred pounds, being in all five hundred pounds, by an agreement to which I am a ſubſcribing witneſs; and now for a third octavo volume he has received no leſs than ſix hundred pounds.</p>

I am indebted to you for two letters; one dated the 16th of November, upon which very day I wrote to you, ſo that our letters were exactly exchanged, and one dated the 21ſt of December laſt.</p>
                        <p>My heart was warmed with gratitude by the truly kind contents of both of them; and it is amazing and vexing that I have allowed ſo much time to elapſe without writing to you. But delay is inherent in me, by nature or by bad habit. I waited till I ſhould have an opportunity of paying you my compliments on a new year. I have procraſtinated till the year is no longer new.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Memis's cauſe was determined againſt him, with 40l. coſts. The Lord Preſident, and two other of the Judges, diſſented from the majority upon this ground:—that although there may have been no intention to injure him by calling him <hi>Doctor of Medicine,</hi> inſtead of <hi>Phyſician,</hi> yet as he remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated againſt the deſignation before the charter was printed off, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented that it was diſagreeable and even hurtful to him, it was ill-natured to refuſe to alter it, and let him have the deſignation to which he was certainly entitled. My own opinion is, that our court has judged wrong. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants were <hi>in malâ fide,</hi> to perſiſt in naming him in a way that he diſliked. You remember poor Goldſmith, when he grew important and wiſhed to appear <hi>Doctor Major,</hi> could not bear your calling him <hi>Goldy.</hi> Would it not have been wrong to have named him ſo in your 'Preface to Shakſpeare,' or in any ſerious permanent writing of any ſort? The difficulty is, whether an action ſhould be allowed on ſuch petty wrongs. <hi>De minimis non curat lex.</hi>

                        <p>Macquarry was here in the winter, and we paſſed an evening together. The ſale of his eſtate cannot be prevented.</p>

 for him yeſterday, and Maclaurin to-day; Croſbie ſpoke to-day againſt him. Three more counſel are to be heard, and next week the cauſe will be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. I ſend you the <hi>Informations</hi> or <hi>Caſes</hi> on each ſide, which I hope you will read. You ſaid to me when we were under Sir Allan's hoſpitable roof, <q rend="inline">'I will help him with my pen.'</q> You ſaid it with a generous glow; and though his Grace of Argyle did afterwards mount you upon an excellent horſe, upon which <q rend="inline">'you looked like a Biſhop,'</q> you muſt not ſwerve from your purpoſe at Inchkenneth. I wiſh you may underſtand the points at iſſue, amidſt our Scotch law principles and phraſes.</p>
                        <p>[Here followed a full ſtate of the caſe, in which I endeavoured to make it as clear as I could to an Engliſhman, who had no knowledge of the formularies and technical language of the law of Scotland.]</p>
                        <p>I ſhall inform you how the cauſe is decided here. But as it may be brought under the review of our judges, and is certainly to be carried by appeal to the Houſe of Lords, the aſſiſtance of ſuch a mind as your's will be of conſequence. Your paper on <hi>Vicious Intromiſſion</hi> is a noble proof of what you can do even in Scotch law.</p>
                        <p>I have not yet diſtributed all your books. Lord Hailes and Lord Monboddo have each received one, and return you thanks. Monboddo dined with me lately, and having drank tea, we were a good while by ourſelves, and as I knew that he had read the 'Journey' ſuperficially, as he did not talk of it as I wiſhed, I brought it to him, and read aloud ſeveral paſſages, and then he talked ſo, that I told him he was to have a copy <hi>from the authour.</hi> He begged <hi>that</hi> might be marked on it.</p>

The truths you have told, and the purity of the language in which they are expreſſed, as your 'Journey' is univerſally read, may and already appear to have a very good effect. For a man of my acquaintance, who has the largeſt nurſery for trees and hedges in this country, tells me, that of late the demand upon him for theſe articles is doubled, and ſometimes tripled. I have, therefore, liſted Dr. Samuel Johnſon in ſome of my memorandums of the principal planters and favourers of the encloſures, under a name which I took the liberty to invent from the Greek, <hi>Papadendrion.</hi> Lord Auchinleck and ſome few more are of the liſt. I am told that one gentleman in the ſhire of Aberdeen, <hi>viz.</hi> Sir Archibald Grant, has planted above fifty millions of trees on a piece of very wild ground at Monimuſk: I muſt enquire if he has fenced them well, before he enters my liſt; for, that is the ſoul of encloſing. I began myſelf to plant a little, our ground being too valuable for much, and that is now fifty years ago; and the trees, now in my ſeventy-fourth year, I look up to with reverence, and ſhew them to my eldeſt ſon, now in his fifteenth year, that they are full the heighth of my country-houſe here, where I had the pleaſure of receiving you, and hope again to have that ſatisfaction with our mutual friend, Mr. Boſwell. I ſhall always continue with the trueſt eſteem,</p>

                        <p>It is ſo long ſince I heard any thing from you <note n="9" place="bottom">By the then courſe of the poſt, my long letter of the 14th had not yet reached him.</note>, that I am not eaſy about it; write ſomething to me next poſt. When you ſent your laſt letter every thing ſeemed to be mending, I hope nothing has lately grown worſe. I ſuppoſe young Alexander continues to thrive, and Veronica is now very pretty company. I do not ſuppoſe the lady is yet reconciled to me, yet let her know that I love her very well, and value her very much.</p>
                        <p>Dr. Blair is printing ſome ſermons. If they are all like the firſt, which I have read, they are <hi>ſermones aurei, ac auro magis aurei.</hi> It is excellently written both as to doctrine and language. Mr. Watſon's book<note n="1" place="bottom">Hiſtory of Philip the Second.</note> ſeems to be much eſteemed.</p>
                        <p>Poor Beauclerk ſtill continues very ill. Langton lives on as he is uſed to do. His children are very pretty, and, I think, his lady loſes her Scotch. Paoli I never ſee.</p>
                        <p>I have been ſo diſtreſſed by difficulty of breathing, that I loſt, as was computed, ſix-and-thirty ounces of blood in a few days. I am better, but not well.</p>
                        <p>I wiſh you would be vigilant and get me Graham's 'Telemachus' that was printed at Glaſgow, a very little book, and <hi>'Johnſtoni Poemata,'</hi> another little book, printed at Middleburg.</p>
                        <p>Mrs. Williams ſends her compliments, and promiſes that when you come hither, ſhe will accommodate you as well as ever ſhe can in the old room. She wiſhes to know whether you ſent her book to Sir Alexander Gordon.</p>

                        <p>YOUR letter dated the 18th inſtant, I had the pleaſure to receive laſt poſt. Although my late long neglect, or rather delay was truly culpable,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0548300102:109" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I am tempted not to regret it, ſince it has produced me ſo valuable a proof  of your regard. I did, indeed, during that inexcuſable ſilence, ſometimes divert the reproaches of my own mind, by fancying that I ſhould hear again from you, inquiring with ſome anxiety about me, becauſe, for aught you knew, I might have been ill.</p>
                        <p>You are pleaſed to ſhew me, that my kindneſs is of ſome conſequence to you. My heart is elated at the thought. Be aſſured, my dear Sir, that my affection and reverence for you are exalted and ſteady. I do not believe that a more perfect attachment ever exiſted in the hiſtory of mankind. And it is a noble attachment, for the attractions are Genius, Learning, and Piety.</p>
                        <p>Your difficulty of breathing alarms me, and brings into my imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an event, which although in the natural courſe of things, I muſt expect at ſome period, I cannot view with compoſure.</p>

                        <p>I HAVE been much pleaſed with your late letter, and am glad that my old enemy, Mrs. Boſwell, begins to feel ſome remorſe. As to Miſs Veronica's Scotch, I think it cannot be helped. An Engliſh maid you might eaſily have; but ſhe would ſtill imitate the greater number, as they would be likewiſe thoſe whom ſhe muſt moſt reſpect. Her dialect will not be groſs. Her Mamma has not much Scotch, and you have yourſelf very little. I hope ſhe knows my name, and does not call me <hi>Johnſton.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>The immediate cauſe of my writing is this:—One Shaw, who ſeems a modeſt and a decent man, has written an Erſe Grammar, which a very learned Highlander, Macbean, has, at my requeſt examined and approved.</p>
                        <p>
                           <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0548300102:110" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 The book is very little, but Mr. Shaw has been perſuaded by his friends to ſet it at half a guinea, though I had adviſed only a crown, and thought myſelf liberal. You, whom the authour conſiders as a great encourager of ingenious men, will receive a parcel of his propoſals and receipts. I have undertaken to give you notice of them, and to ſolicit your countenance. You muſt aſk no poor man, becauſe the price is really too high. Yet ſuch a work deſerves patronage.</p>
                        <p>It is propoſed to augment our club from twenty to thirty, of which I am glad; for as we have ſeveral in it whom I do not much like to conſort with <note n="2" place="bottom">On account of their differing from his as to religion and politicks.</note>, I am for reducing it to a mere miſcellaneous collection of conſpicuous men, without any determinate character.</p>

                     <p>I think it hard that I ſhould be a whole year without ſeeing you. May I preſume to petition for a meeting with you in the autumn? You have, I believe, ſeen all the cathedrals in England, except that of Carliſle. If you are to be with Dr. Taylor, at Aſhbourne, it would not be a great journey to come thither.

                     <p>You forget that Mr. Shaw's Erſe Grammar was put into your hands by myſelf laſt year. Lord Eglintoune put it into mine. I am glad that Mr. Macbean approves of it.

                     <p>Pray get for me all the editions of 'Walton's Lives.' I have a notion that the re-publication of them with Notes will fall upon me, between Dr. Horne and Lord Hailes.</p>

Mr. Shaw's Propoſals † for <q rend="inline">"An Analyſis of the Scotch Celtick Language,"</q>  were thus illuminated by the pen of Johnſon:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>THOUGH the Erſe dialect of the Celtick language has, from the earlieſt times, been ſpoken in Britain, and ſtill ſubſiſts in the northern parts and adjacent iſlands, yet, by the negligence of a people rather warlike than lettered, it has hitherto been left to the caprice and judgement of every ſpeaker, and has floated in the living voice, without the ſteadineſs of analogy or direction of rules. An Erſe Grammar is an addition to the ſtores of literature; and its authour hopes for the indulgence always ſhewn to thoſe that attempt to do what was never done before. If his work ſhall be found defective, it is at leaſt all his own: he is not like other grammarians, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piler or tranſcriber; what he delivers, he has learned by attentive obſervation among his countrymen, who perhaps will be themſelves ſurprized to ſee that ſpeech reduced to principles, which they have uſed only by imitation.</p>
                  <p>The uſe of this book will, however, not be confined to the mountains and iſlands; it will afford a pleaſing and important ſubject of ſpeculation, to thoſe whoſe ſtudies lead them to trace the affinity of languages, and the migrations of the ancient races of mankind.</p>

                     <p>THE ſtory of Mr. Thrale's death, as he had neither been ſick nor in any other danger, made ſo little impreſſion upon me, that I never thought about obviating its effects on any body elſe. It is ſuppoſed to have been produced by the Engliſh cuſtom of making April fools, that is, of ſending one another on ſome fooliſh errand on the firſt of April.</p>

But when I find it does me no harm, I ſhall then receive it and be thankful for it, as a pledge of firm, and, I hope, of unalterable kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. She is, after all, a dear, dear lady.</p>
                     <p>Pleaſe to return Dr. Blair thanks for his ſermons. The Scotch write Engliſh wonderfully well.</p>
                     <p>Your frequent viſits to Auchinleck, and your ſhort ſtay there are very laudable and very judicious. Your preſent concord with your father gives me great pleaſure; it was all that you ſeemed to want.</p>
                     <p>My health is very bad, and my nights are very unquiet. What can I do to mend them? I have for this ſummer nothing better in proſpect than a journey into Staffordſhire and Derbyſhire, perhaps with Oxford and Birmingham in my way.</p>

But, indeed, very little time was neceſſary for Johnſon's concluding a treaty with the Bookſellers; as he had, I believe, leſs attention to profit from his labours than any man to whom literature has been a profeſſion. I ſhall here inſert from a letter to me from my late worthy friend Mr. Edward Dilly, though of a later date, an account of this plan ſo happily conceived; ſince it was the occaſion of procuring for us an elegant collection of the beſt biography and criticiſm of which our language can boaſt.</p>

I am happy to find you had ſuch an agreeable meeting with your old friend Dr. Johnſon; I have no doubt your ſtock is much increaſed by the interview; few men, nay I may ſay, ſcarcely any man has got that fund of knowledge and entertainment as Dr. Johnſon in converſation. When he opens freely, every one is attentive to what he ſays, and cannot fail of improvement as well as pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>The edition of the Poets, now printing, will do honour to the Engliſh preſs, and a conciſe account of the life of each authour, by Dr. Johnſon, will be a very valuable addition, and ſtamp the reputation of this edition ſuperior to any thing that is gone before. The firſt cauſe that gave
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0548300102:114" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 riſe to this undertaking, I believe, was owing to the little trifling edition of the Poets, printing by the Martins, at Edinburgh, and to be ſold by Bell, in London. Upon examining the volumes which were printed, the type was ſound ſo extremely ſmall, that many perſons could not read them; not only this inconvenience attended it, but the inaccuracy of the preſs was very conſpicuous. Theſe reaſons, as well as the idea of an invaſion of what we call our Literary Property, induced the London Bookſellers to print an elegant and accurate edition of all the Engliſh Poets of reputation, from Chaucer to the preſent time.</p>
                     <p>Accordingly a ſelect number of the moſt reſpectable bookſellers met on the occaſion, and, on conſulting together, agreed, that all the proprietors of copy-right in the various Poets ſhould be ſummoned together; and when their opinions were given, to proceed immediately on the buſineſs. Accordingly a meeting was held, conſiſting of about forty of the moſt reſpectable book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers of London, when it was agreed that an elegant and uniform edition of 'The Engliſh Poets' ſhould be immediately printed, with a conciſe account of the life of each author, by Dr. Samuel Johnſon; and that three perſons ſhould be deputed to wait upon Dr. Johnſon, to ſolicit him to undertake the Lives, <hi>viz.</hi> T. Davies, Strahan, and Cadell. The Doctor very politely undertook it, and ſeemed exceedingly pleaſed with the propoſal. As to the terms, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

A committee was likewiſe appointed to engage the beſt engravers, <hi>viz.</hi> Bartolozzi, Sherwin, Hall, &amp;c. Likewiſe another committee for giving directions about the paper, printing, &amp;c. ſo that the whole will be conducted with ſpirit, and in the beſt manner, with reſpect to authourſhip, editorſhip, engravings, &amp;c. &amp;c. My brother will give you a liſt of the Poets we mean to give, many of which are within the time of the Act of Queen Anne, which Martin and Bell cannot give, as they have no property in them; the proprietors are almoſt all the bookſellers in London of conſequence.</p>

                     <p>HAVING had the pleaſure of converſing with Dr. Campbell about your character and your literary undertaking, I am reſolved to gratify myſelf by renewing a correſpondence which began and ended a great while ago, and ended, I am afraid, by my fault; a fault which, if you have not forgotten it, you muſt now forgive.</p>
                     <p>If I have ever diſappointed you, give me leave to tell you, that you have likewiſe diſappointed me. I expected great diſcoveries in Iriſh antiquity, and large publications in the Iriſh language; but the world ſtill remains as it was, doubtful and ignorant. What the Iriſh language is in itſelf, and to what languages it has affinity, are very intereſting queſtions; which every man wiſhes to ſee reſolved, that has any philological or hiſtorical curioſity. Dr. Leland begins his hiſtory too late: the ages which deſerve an exact enquiry are thoſe times (for ſuch there were) when Ireland was the ſchool of the weſt, the quiet habitation of ſanctity and literature. If you could give a hiſtory, though imperfect, of the Iriſh nation, from its converſion to Chriſtianity to the invaſion from England, you would amplify knowledge with new views and new objects. Set about it, therefore, if you can: do what you can eaſily do without anxious exactneſs. Lay the foundation, and leave the ſuperſtructure to poſterity.</p>

               <p>A circumſtance which could not fail to be very pleaſing to Johnſon, occurred this year. The Tragedy of <q rend="inline">"Sir Thomas Overbury,"</q> written by his early companion in London, Richard Savage, was brought out with alterations at Drury-lane theatre.

                  <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0548300102:118" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 he concluded with an elegant compliment to Johnſon on his Dictionary, that wonderful performance which cannot be too often or too highly praiſed; of which Mr. Harris, in his <q rend="inline">"Philological Inquiries <note n="5" place="bottom">Part Firſt, Chap. 4.</note>,"</q> juſtly and liberally obſerves, <q rend="inline">"Such is its merit, that our language does not poſſeſs a more copious, learned, and valuable work."</q> The concluding lines of this Prologue were theſe:</p>

                     <l>"So pleads the tale<note n="6" place="bottom">"Life of Richard Savage, by Dr. Johnſon."</note> that gives to future times<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>Mr. Sheridan here at once did honour to his taſte and to his liberality of ſentiment, by ſhewing that he was not prejudiced from the unlucky difference which had taken place between his worthy father and Dr. Johnſon. I have already mentioned, that Johnſon was very deſirous of reconciliation with old Mr. Sheridan. It will, therefore, not ſeem at all ſurprizing that he was zealous in acknowledging the brilliant merit of his ſon. While it had as yet been diſplayed only in the drama, Johnſon propoſed him as a member of THE LITERARY CLUB, obſerving, that <q rend="inline">"He who has written the two beſt comedies of his age, is ſurely a conſiderable man."</q> And he had, accordingly, the honour to be elected; for an honour it undoubtedly muſt be allowed to be, when it is conſidered of whom that ſociety conſiſts, and that a ſingle black ball excludes a candidate.</p>

                     <p>FOR the health of my wife and children I have taken the little country-houſe at which you viſited my uncle, Dr. Boſwell, who, having loſt his wife, is gone to live with his ſon. We took poſſeſſion of our villa about a week ago; we have a garden of three quarters of an acre, well ſtocked with fruit trees and flowers, and gooſeberries and currants, and peaſe and beans, and cabbages, &amp;c. &amp;c. and my children are quite happy. I now write to you in a little ſtudy, from the window of which I ſee around me a verdant grove, and beyond it the lofty mountain, called Arthur's Seat.</p>
                     <p>Your laſt letter, in which you deſire me to ſend you ſome additional information concerning Thomſon, reached me very fortunately juſt as I was
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0548300102:119" rendition="simple:additions"/>
going to Lanark, to put my wife's two nephews, the young Campbells,  to ſchool there, under the care of Mr. Thomſon, the maſter of it, whoſe wife is ſiſter to the authour of the Seaſons. She is an old woman; but her memory is very good; and ſhe will with pleaſure give me for you every particular that you wiſh to know, and ſhe can tell. Pray then take the trouble to ſend me ſuch queſtions as may lead to biographical materials. You ſay that the Life which we have of Thomſon is ſcanty. Since I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived your letter, I have read his Life, publiſhed under the name of Cibber, but as you told me, really written by a Mr. Shiels; that written by Dr. Murdoch; one prefixed to an edition of the 'Seaſons,' publiſhed at Edinburgh, which is compounded of both, with the addition of an anecdote of Quin's relieving Thomſon from priſon; the abridgement of Murdoch's life of him, in the 'Biographia Britannica,' and another abridgement of it in the 'Biographical Dictionary,' enriched with Dr. Joſeph Warton's critical panegyrick on the 'Seaſons' in his 'Eſſay on the Genius and Writings of Pope:' from all theſe it appears to me that we have a pretty full account of this poet. However, you will, I doubt not, ſhew me many blanks, and I ſhall do what can be done to have them filled up. As Thomſon never returned to Scotland, (which <hi>you</hi> will think very wiſe,) his ſiſter can ſpeak from her own knowledge only as to the early part of his life. She has ſome letters from him, which may probably give light as to his more advanced progreſs, if ſhe will let us ſee them, which I ſuppoſe ſhe will. I believe George Lewis Scott and Dr. Armſtrong are now his only ſurviving companions, while he lived in and about London; and they, I dare ſay, can tell more of him than is yet known. My own notion is, that Thomſon was a much coarſer man than his friends are willing to acknowledge. His 'Seaſons' are indeed full of elegant and pious ſentiments: but a rank ſoil, nay a dunghill, will produce beautiful flowers.</p>
                     <p>Your edition of the 'Engliſh Poets' will be very valuable, on account of the 'Prefaces and Lives.' But I have ſeen a ſpecimen of an edition of the Poets at the Apollo preſs, at Edinburgh, which, for excellence in printing and engraving, highly deſerves a liberal encouragement.</p>
                     <p>Moſt ſincerely do I regret the bad health and bad reſt with which you have been afflicted; and I hope you are better. I cannot believe that the prologue which you generouſly gave to Mr. Kelly's widow and children the other day, is the effuſion of one in ſickneſs and in diſquietude: but external circumſtances are never ſure indications of the ſtate of man. I ſend you a letter which I wrote to you two years ago at Wilton; and did not ſend at the
<pb facs="tcp:0548300102:120" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 time, for fear of being reproved as indulging too much tenderneſs; and one written to you at the tomb of Melancthon, which I kept back, leſt I ſhould appear at once too ſuperſtitious and too enthuſiaſtick. I now imagine that perhaps they may pleaſe you.</p>
                     <p>You do not take the leaſt notice of my propoſal for our meeting at Carliſle. Though I have meritoriouſly refrained from viſiting London this year, I aſk you if it would not be wrong that I ſhould be two years without having the benefit of your converſation, when, if you come down as far as Derbyfhire, we may meet at the expence of a few days journeying, and not many pounds. I wiſh you to ſee Carliſle, which made me mention that place. But if you have not a deſire to complete your tour of the Engliſh cathedrals, I will take a larger ſhare of the road between this place and Aſhbourne. So tell me <hi>where</hi> you will fix for our paſſing a few days by ourſelves. Now don't cry 'fooliſh fellow,' or 'idle dog.' Chain your humour, and let your kindneſs play.</p>
                     <p>You will rejoice to hear that Miſs Macleod, of Raſay, is married to Colonel Mure Campbell, an excellent man, with a pretty good eſtate of his own, and the proſpect of having the Earl of Loudoun's fortune and honours. Is not this a noble lot for our fair Hebridean? How happy am I that ſhe is to be in Ayrſhire. We ſhall have the Laird of Raſay, and old Malcolm, and I know not how many gallant Macleods, and bagpipes, &amp;c. &amp;c. at Auchinleck. Perhaps you may meet them all there.</p>
                     <p>Without doubt you have read what is called 'The <hi>Life</hi> of David Hume,' written by himſelf, with the letter from Dr. Adam Smith ſubjoined to it. Is not this an age of daring effrontery? My friend Mr. Anderſon, Profeſſor of Natural Philoſophy at Glaſgow, at whoſe houſe you and I ſupped, and to whoſe care Mr. Windham, of Norfolk, was entruſted at that Univerſity, paid me a viſit lately; and after we had talked with indignation and contempt of the poiſonous productions with which this age is infeſted, he ſaid there was now an excellent opportunity for Dr. Johnſon to ſtep forth. I agreed with him that you might knock Hume's and Smith's heads together, and make vain and oſtentatious infidelity exceedingly ridiculous. Would it not be worth your while to cruſh ſuch noxious weeds in the moral garden?</p>
                     <p>You have ſaid nothing to me of Dr. Dodd. I know not how you think on that ſubject; though the newſpapers give us a ſaying of yours in favour of mercy to him. But I own I am very deſirous that the royal prerogative of remiſſion of puniſhment, ſhould be employed to exhibit an illuſtrious inſtance of the regard which GOD's VICEGERENT will ever ſhew to
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0548300102:121" rendition="simple:additions"/>
piety and virtue. If for ten righteous men the ALMIGHTY would have  ſpared Sodom, ſhall not a thouſand acts of goodneſs done by Dr. Dodd counterbalance one crime? Such an inſtance would do more to encourage goodneſs, than his execution would do to deter from vice. I am not afraid of any bad conſequence to ſociety; for who will perſevere for a long courſe of years in a diſtinguiſhed diſcharge of religious duties, with a view to commit a forgery with impunity?</p>
                     <p>Pray make my beſt compliments acceptable to Mr. and Mrs. Thrale, by aſſuring them of my hearty joy that the <hi>Maſter</hi> as you call him is alive. I hope I ſhall often taſte his Champagne—ſoberly.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE juſt received your packet from Mr. Thrale's, but have not day-light enough to look much into it. I am glad that I have credit enough with Lord Hailes to be truſted with more copy. I hope to take more care of it than of the laſt. I return Mrs. Boſwell my affectionate thanks for her preſent, which I value as a token of reconciliation.</p>
                     <p>Poor Dodd was put to death yeſterday, in oppoſition to the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the jury—the petition of the city of London—and a ſubſequent petition ſigned by three-and-twenty thouſand hands. Surely the voice of the publick, when it calls ſo loudly, and calls only for mercy, ought to be heard.</p>
                     <p>The ſaying that was given me in the papers I never ſpoke; but I wrote many of his petitions, and ſome of his letters. He applied to me very often.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0548300102:122"/>
 He was, I am afraid, long flattered with hopes of life; but I had no part in the dreadful deluſion; for as ſoon as the King had ſigned his ſentence, I obtained from Mr. Chamier an account of the diſpoſition of the court towards him, with a declaration that there was <hi>no hope even of a reſpite.</hi> This letter immediately was laid before Dodd; but he believed thoſe whom he wiſhed to be right, as it is thought, till within three days of his end. He died with pious compoſure and reſolution. I have juſt ſeen the Ordinary that attended him. His Addreſs to his fellow-convicts offended the Methodiſts; but he had a Moravian with him much of his time. His moral character is very bad: I hope all is not true that is charged upon him. Of his behaviour in priſon an account will be publiſhed.</p>
                     <p>I give you joy of your country-houſe, and your pretty garden; and hope ſome time to ſee you in your felicity. I was much pleaſed with your two letters that had been kept ſo long in ſtore <hi rend="sup">2</hi>

I cannot reſiſt the ſerious pleaſure of writing to Mr. Johnſon from the Tomb of Melancthon. My paper reſts upon the grave-ſtone of that great and good man, who was undoubtedly the worthieſt of all the reformers. He wiſhed to reform abuſes which had been introduced into the Church; but had no private reſentment to gratify. So mild was he, that when his aged mother conſulted him with anxiety on the perplexing diſputes of the times, he adviſed her <q rend="inline">'to keep to the old religion.'</q> At this tomb, then, my ever dear and reſpected friend! I vow to thee an eternal attachment.

               <p>Johnſon's benevolence to the unfortunate was, I am confident, as ſteady and active as that of any of thoſe who have been moſt eminently diſtinguiſhed for that virtue. Innumerable proofs of it I have no doubt will be for ever concealed from mortal eyes. We may, however, form ſome judgement of it, from the many and very various inſtances which have been diſcovered. One which happened in the courſe of this ſummer is remarkable from the name and connection of the perſon who was the object of it. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to which I allude is aſcertained by two letters, one to Mr. Langton, and another to the Reverend Dr. Vyſe, rector of Lambeth, ſon of the reſpectable clergyman at Lichfield, who was contemporary with Johnſon, and in whoſe father's family Johnſon had the happineſs of being kindly received in his early years.</p>

                     <p>Sir Allan Maclean has carried that branch of his cauſe of which we had good hopes: the Preſident and one other Judge only were againſt him. I wiſh the Houſe of Lords may do as well as the Court of Seſſion has done. But Sir Allan has not the lands of <hi>Brolos</hi> quite clear by this judgement, till a long account is made up of debts and intereſts on the one ſide, and rents on the other. I am, however, not much afraid of the balance.</p>
                     <p>Macquarry's eſtates, Staffa and all, were ſold yeſterday, and bought by a Campbell. I fear he will have little or nothing left out of the purchaſe money.</p>
                     <p>I ſend you the caſe againſt the negro, by Mr. Cullen, ſon to Dr. Cullen, in oppoſition to Maclaurin's for liberty, of which you have approved. Pray read this; and tell me what you think as a <hi>Politician,</hi> as well as a <hi>Poet,</hi> upon the ſubject.</p>

                     <p>YOUR notion of the neceſſity of a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> yearly interview is very pleaſing to both my vanity and tenderneſs. I ſhall, perhaps, come to Carliſle another year; but my money has not held out ſo well as it uſed to do. I ſhall go to Aſhbourne, and I purpoſe to make Dr. Taylor invite you. If you live awhile with me at his houſe, we ſhall have much time to ourſelves, and our ſtay will be no expence to us or him. I ſhall leave London the 28th; and after ſome ſtay at Oxford and Lichfield, ſhall probably come to Aſhbourne about the end of your Seſſion, but of all this you ſhall have notice. Be ſatisfied we will meet ſomewhere.</p>
                     <p>What paſſed between me and poor Dr. Dodd you ſhall know more fully when we meet.</p>
                     <p>Of lawſuits there is no end; poor Sir Allan muſt have another trial, for which, however, his antagoniſt cannot be much blamed, having two judges on his ſide. I am more afraid of the debts than of the Houſe of Lords. It is ſcarcely to be imagined to what debts will ſwell, that are daily encreaſing by ſmall additions, and how careleſsly in a ſtate of deſperation debts are contracted. Poor Macquarry was far from thinking that when he ſold his iſlands he ſhould receive nothing. For what were they ſold? And what was their yearly value? The admiſſion of money into the Highlands will ſoon put an end to the feudal modes of life, by making thoſe men landlords who were not chiefs. I do not know that the people will ſuffer by the change, but there was in the patriarchal authority ſomething venerable and pleaſing. Every eye muſt look with pain on a <hi>Campbell</hi> turning the <hi>Macquarries</hi> at will out of their <hi>ſedes avitae,</hi> their hereditary iſland.</p>
                     <p>Sir Alexander Dick is the only Scotſman liberal enough not to be angry that I could not find trees, where trees were not. I was much delighted by his kind letter.</p>
                     <p>I remember Raſay with too much pleaſure not to partake of the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of any part of that amiable family. Our ramble in the iſlands hangs
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0548300102:128" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 upon my imagination, I can hardly help imagining that we ſhall go again. Pennant ſeems to have ſeen a great deal which we did not ſee: When we travel again let us look better about us.</p>
                     <p>You have done right in taking your unkle's houſe. Some change in the form of life, gives from time to time a new epocha of exiſtence. In a new place there is ſomething new to be done, and a different ſyſtem of thoughts riſes in the mind. I wiſh I could gather currants in your garden. Now fit up a little ſtudy, and have your books ready at hand; do not ſpare a little money, to make your habitation pleaſing to yourſelf.</p>
                     <p>I have dined lately with poor dear—. I do not think he goes on well. His table is rather coarſe, and he has his children too much about him <note n="1" place="bottom">This very juſt remark I hope will be conſtantly held in remembrance by parents, who are in general too apt to indulge their own fond feelings for their children at the expence of their friends. The common cuſtom of introducing them after dinner is highly injudicious. It is agreeable enough that they ſhould appear at any other time; but they ſhould not be ſuffered to poiſon the moments of feſtivity by attracting the attention of the company, and in a manner compelling them from politeneſs to ſay what they do not <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>think.</note>. But he is a very good man.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Williams is in the country to try if ſhe can improve her health; ſhe is very ill. Matters have come ſo about that ſhe is in the country with very good accommodation; but, age and ſickneſs, and pride, have made her ſo peeviſh that I was forced to bribe the maid to ſtay with her, by a ſecret ſtipulation of half a crown a week over her wages.</p>
                     <p>Our club ended its ſeſſion about ſix weeks ago. We now only meet to dine once a fortnight. Mr. Dunning, the great lawyer, is one of our members. The Thrales are well.</p>
                     <p>I long to know how the Negro's cauſe will be decided. What is the opinion of Lord Auchinleck, or Lord Hailes, or Lord Monboddo?</p>

                     <p>ON Saturday I wrote a very ſhort letter, immediately upon my arrival hither, to ſhew you that I am not leſs deſirous of the interview than yourſelf. Life admits not of delays; when pleaſure can be had it is fit to catch
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0548300102:131"/>
it: Every hour takes away part of the things that pleaſe us, and perhaps part  of our diſpoſition to be pleaſed. When I came to Lichfield, I found my old friend Harry Jackſon dead. It was a loſs, and a loſs not to be repaired, as he was one of the companions of my childhood. I hope we may long continue to gain friends, but the friends which merit or uſefulneſs can procure us, are not able to ſupply the place of old acquaintance, with whom the days of youth may be retraced, and thoſe images revived which gave the earlieſt delight. If you and I live to be much older, we ſhall take great delight in talking over the Hebridean Journey.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time it may not be amiſs to contrive ſome other little adventure, but what it can be I know not; leave it, as Sidney ſays,

                        </q>
for I believe Mrs. Boſwell muſt have ſome part in the conſultation.</p>
                     <p>One thing you will like. The Doctor, ſo far as I can judge, is likely to leave us enough to ourſelves. He was out to-day before I came down, and, I fancy, will ſtay out till dinner. I have brought the papers about poor Dodd, to ſhow you, but you will ſoon have diſpatched them.</p>
                     <p>Before I came away I ſent poor Mrs. Williams into the country, very ill of a pituitous defluxion, which waſtes her gradually away, and which her phyſician declares himſelf unable to ſtop. I ſupplied her as far as could be deſired, with all conveniencies to make her excurſion and abode pleaſant and uſeful, but I am afraid ſhe can only linger a ſhort time in a morbid ſtate of weakneſs and pain.</p>
                     <p>The Thrales, little and great, are all well, and purpoſe to go to Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>helmſton at Michaelmas. They will invite me to go with them, and perhaps I may go, but I hardly think I ſhall like to ſtay the whole time; but of futurity we know but little.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Porter is well; but Mrs. Aſton, one of the ladies at Stowhill, has been ſtruck with a palſy, from which ſhe is not likely ever to recover. How ſoon may ſuch a ſtroke fall upon us!</p>

                     <p>[After informing him that I was to ſet out next day, in order to meet him at Aſhbourne:—]</p>
                     <p>I have a preſent for you from Lord Hailes; the fifth book of 'Lactantius,' which he has publiſhed with Latin notes. He is alſo to give you a few anecdotes for your 'Life of Thomſon,' who I find was private tutor to the preſent Earl of Hadington, Lord Hailes's couſin, a circumſtance not mentioned by Dr. Murdoch. I have keen expectations of delight from your edition of the Engliſh Poets.</p>
                     <p>I am ſorry for poor Mrs. Williams's ſituation. You will, however, have the comfort of reflecting on your kindneſs to her. Mr. Jackſon's death, and Mrs. Aſton's palſy, are gloomy circumſtances. Yet ſurely we ſhould be habituated to the uncertainty of life and health. When my mind is unclouded by melancholy, I conſider the temporary diſtreſſes of this ſtate of being, as light afflictions, by ſtretching my mental view into that glorious after exiſtence, when they will appear to be as nothing. But preſent pleaſures and preſent pains muſt be felt. I lately read 'Raſſelas' over again with great ſatisfaction.</p>
                     <p>Since you are deſirous to hear about Macquarry's ſale I ſhall inform you particularly. The gentleman who purchaſed Ulva is Mr. Campbell, of Auchnabà: our friend Macquarry was proprietor of two-thirds of it, of which the rent was 156l. 5s. 1d. 1/<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. This parcel was ſet up at 4,069l. 15s. 1d. but it ſold for no leſs than 5,540l. The other third of Ulva, with the iſland of Staffa, belonged to Macquarry of Ormaig. Its rent, including that of Staffa, 83l. 12s. 2d. 2/3—ſet up at 2178l. 16s. 4d.—ſold for no leſs than 3,540l. The Laird of Col wiſhed to purchaſe Ulva, but he thought the price too high. There may, indeed, be great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments made there, both in fiſhing and agriculture; but the intereſt of the purchaſe-money exceeds the rents ſo very much, that I doubt if the bargain will be profitable. There is an iſland called Little Colonſay, of 10l. yearly rent, which I am informed has belonged to the Macquarrys of Ulva for many ages, but which was lately claimed by the Preſbyterian Synod of Argyll, in conſequence of a grant made to them by Queen Anne. It is believed that their claim will be diſmiſſed, and that Little Colonſay will alſo be ſold for the advantage of Macquarry's creditors. What think you of

purchaſing this iſland, and endowing a ſchool or college there, the maſter to be  a clergyman of the Church of England? How venerable would ſuch an inſtitution make the name of DR. SAMUEL JOHNSON in the Hebrides! I have, like yourſelf, a wonderful pleaſure in recollecting our travels in thoſe iſlands. The pleaſure is, I think, greater than it reaſonably ſhould be, conſidering that we had not much either of beauty and elegance to charm our imaginations, or of rude novelty to aſtoniſh.

                           <p>It appears that Johnſon, now in his ſixty-eighth year, was ſeriouſly inclined to realiſe the project of our going up the Baltick, which I had ſtarted when we were in the iſle of Sky; for he thus writes to Mrs. Thrale; Letters, Vol. I. page 366:

               <p>On Sunday evening, September 14, I arrived at Aſhbourne, and drove directly up to Dr. Taylor's door. Dr. Johnſon and he appeared before I had got out of the poſt-chaiſe, and welcomed me cordially.</p>
               <p>I told them that I had travelled all the preceding night, and gone to bed at Leek, in Staffordſhire; and that when I roſe to go to church in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, I was informed there had been an earthquake, of which, it ſeems, the ſhock had been felt, in ſome degree, at Aſhbourne. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it will be much exaggerated in popular talk: for, in the firſt place, the common people do not accurately adapt their thoughts to the objects; nor, ſecondly, do they accurately adapt their words to their thoughts: they do not mean to lie; but, taking no pains to be exact, they give you very falſe accounts. A great part of their language is proverbial. If any thing rocks at all, they ſay <hi>it rocks like a cradle;</hi> and in this way they go on."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The ſubject of grief for the loſs of relations and friends being introduced, I obſerved that it was ſtrange to conſider how ſoon it in general wears away. Dr. Taylor mentioned a gentleman of the neighbourhod as the only inſtance he had ever known of a perſon who had endeavoured to <hi>retain</hi> grief. He told Dr. Taylor, that after his lady's death, which affected him deeply, he <hi>reſolved</hi> that the grief, which he cheriſhed with a kind of ſacred fondneſs, ſhould be laſting; but that he found he could not keep it long. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"All grief for what cannot in the courſe of nature be helped, ſoon wears away; in ſome ſooner, indeed, in ſome later; but it never continues very long, unleſs where there is madneſs, ſuch as will make a man have pride ſo fixed in his
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0548300102:135" rendition="simple:additions"/>
mind, as to imagine himſelf a King; or any other paſſion in an unreaſonable  way: for all unneceſſary grief is unwiſe, and therefore will not be long retained by a ſound mind. If, indeed, the cauſe of our grief is occaſioned by our own miſconduct, if grief is mingled with remorſe of conſcience, it ſhould be laſting."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, we do not approve of a man who very ſoon forgets the loſs of a wife or a friend."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, we diſapprove of him, not becauſe he ſoon forgets his grief, for the ſooner it is forgotten the better, but becauſe we ſuppoſe, that if he forgets his wife or his friend ſoon, he has not had much affection for them."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I was ſomewhat diſappointed in finding that the edition of the Engliſh Poets, ſor which he was to write Prefaces and Lives, was not an undertaking directed by him; but that he was to furniſh a Preface and Life to any poet the bookſellers pleaſed. I aſked him if he would do this to any dunce's works, if they ſhould aſk him. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; and <hi>ſay</hi> he was a dunce."</q> My friend ſeemed now not much to reliſh talking of this edition.</p>
               <p>On Monday, September 15, Dr. Johnſon obſerved, that every body com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended ſuch parts of his <q rend="inline">"Journey to the Weſtern Iſlands,"</q> as were in their own way. <q rend="inline">"For inſtance, (ſaid he,) Mr. Jackſon (the all-knowing) told me, there was more good ſenſe upon trade in it, than he ſhould hear in the Houſe of Commons in a year, except from Burke. Jones commended the part which treats of language; Burke that which deſcribes the inhabitants of mountainous countries."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After breakfaſt, Johnſon carried me to ſee the garden belonging to the ſchool of Aſhbourne, which is very prettily formed upon a bank, riſing gradually behind the houſe. The Reverend Mr. Langley, the head maſter, accompanied us.</p>
               <p>While we ſat baſking in the ſun upon a ſeat here, I introduced a common ſubject of complaint, the very ſmall ſalaries which many curates have, and I maintained, <q rend="inline">"that no man ſhould be inveſted with the character of a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, unleſs he has a ſecurity for ſuch an income as will enable him to appear reſpectable; that, therefore, a clergyman ſhould not be allowed to have a curate, unleſs he gives him a hundred pounds a year; if he cannot do that, let him perform the duty himſelf."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"To be ſure, Sir, it is wrong that any clergyman ſhould be without a reaſonable income; but as the church revenues were ſadly diminiſhed at the Reformation, the clergy who have livings cannot afford, in many inſtances, to gi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> good ſalaries to curates, without leaving themſelves too little; and, if no curate were to be permitted, unleſs he had a hundred pounds a year, their number would be
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0548300102:136" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 very ſmall, which would be a diſadvantage, as then there would not be ſuch choice in the nurſery for the church, curates being candidates for the higher eccleſiaſtical offices, according to their merit and good behaviour."</q> He explained the ſyſtem of the Engliſh Hierarchy exceedingly well. <q rend="inline">"It is not thought fit (ſaid he) to truſt a man with the care of a pariſh, till he has given proof as a curate that he ſhall deſerve ſuch a truſt."</q> This is an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent <hi>theory;</hi> and if the <hi>practice</hi> were according to it, the Church of England would be admirable indeed. However, as I have heard Dr. Johnſon obſerve as to the Univerſities, bad practice does not infer that the <hi>conſtitution</hi> is bad.</p>
               <p>We had with us at dinner ſeveral of Dr. Taylor's neighbours, good civil gentlemen, who ſeemed to underſtand Dr. Johnſon very well, and not to conſider him in the light that a certain perſon did, who being ſtruck, or rather ſtunned by his voice and manner, when he was afterwards aſked what he thought of him, anſwered, <q rend="inline">"He's a tremendous companion."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon told me, that <q rend="inline">"Taylor was a very ſenſible acute man, and had a ſtrong mind; that he had great activity in ſome reſpects, and yet ſuch a ſort of indolence, that if you ſhould put a pebble upon his chimney-piece, you would find it there, in the ſame ſtate, a year afterwards."</q>
               </p>
               <p>And here is the proper place to give an account of Johnſon's humane and zealous interference in behalf of the Reverend Dr. William Dodd, formerly Prebendary of Brecon, and chaplain in ordinary to his Majeſty; celebrated as a very popular preacher, an encourager of charitable inſtitutions, and authour of a variety of works, chiefly theological. Having unhappily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted expenſive habits of living, partly occaſioned by licentiouſneſs of manners, he in an evil hour, when preſſed by want of money, and dreading an expoſure of his circumſtances, forged a bond of which he attempted to avail himſelf to ſupport his credit, flattering himſelf with hopes that he might be able to repay its amount without being detected. The perſon, whoſe name he thus raſhly and criminally preſumed to falſify, was the Earl of Cheſterfield, to whom he had been tutor, and who, he perhaps, in the warmth of his feelings, flattered himſelf would have paid the money in caſe of an alarm being taken, rather than ſuffer him to fall a victim to the dreadful conſequences of violating the law againſt forgery, the moſt dangerous crime in a commercial country; but the unfortunate divine had the mortification to find that he was miſtaken. His noble pupil appeared againſt him, and he was capitally convicted.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="135" facs="tcp:0548300102:137" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Johnſon told me that Dr. Dodd was very little acquainted with him, having  been but once in his company, many years previous to this period (which was preciſely the ſtate of my own acquaintance with Dodd); but in his diſtreſs he bethought himſelf of Johnſon's perſuaſive power of writing, if haply it might avail to obtain for him the royal mercy. He did not apply to him directly, but, extraordinary as it may ſeem, through the late Counteſs of Harrington, who wrote a letter to Johnſon, aſking him to employ his pen in favour of Dodd. Mr. Allen, the printer, who was Johnſon's landlord and next neighbour in Bolt-court, and for whom he had much kindneſs, was one of Dodd's friends, of whom, to the credit of humanity be it recorded, that he had many who did not deſert him, even after his infringement of the law had reduced him to the ſtate of a man under ſentence of death. Mr. Allen told me that he carried Lady Harrington's letter to Johnſon, that Johnſon read it walking up and down his chamber, and ſeemed much agitated, after which he ſaid <q rend="inline">"I will do what I can;—"</q> and certainly he did make extraordinary exertions.</p>
               <p>He this evening, as he had obligingly promiſed in one of his letters, put into my hands the whole ſeries of his writings upon this melancholy occaſion, and I ſhall preſent my readers with the abſtract which I made from the col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; in doing which I ſtudied to avoid copying what had appeared in print, and now make part of the edition of <q rend="inline">"Johnſon's Works,"</q> publiſhed by the Bookſellers of London, but taking care to mark Johnſon's variations in ſome of the pieces there exhibited.</p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon wrote in the firſt place, Dr. Dodd's <q rend="inline">"Speech to the Recorder of London,"</q> at the Old-Bailey, when ſentence of death was about to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced upon him.</p>
               <p>He wrote alſo <q rend="inline">"The Convict's Addreſs to his unhappy Bretheren,"</q> a ſermon delivered by Dr. Dodd, in the chapel of Newgate. According to Johnſon's manuſcript it began thus after the text, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi>—<q rend="inline">"Theſe were the words with which the keeper, to whoſe cuſtody Paul and Silas were committed by their proſecutors, addreſſed his priſoners, when he ſaw them freed from their bonds by the perceptible agency of divine favour, and was, therefore, irreſiſtibly convinced that they were not offenders againſt the laws, but martyrs to the truth."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon was ſo good as to mark for me with his own hand, on a copy of this ſermon which is now in my poſſeſſion, ſuch paſſages as were added by Dr. Dodd. They are not many: Whoever will take the trouble to look at the printed copy and attend to what I mention, will be ſatisfied of this.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="136" facs="tcp:0548300102:138" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 There is a ſhort introduction by Dr. Dodd, and he alſo inſerted this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, <q rend="inline">"You ſee with what confuſion and diſhonour I now ſtand before you;—no more in the pulpit of inſtruction, but on this humble ſeat with yourſelves."</q> The <hi>notes</hi> are entirely Dodd's own, and Johnſon's writing ends at the words, <q rend="inline">"the thief whom he pardoned on the croſs."</q> What follows was ſupplied by Dr. Dodd himſelf.</p>
               <p>The other pieces written by Johnſon in the above mentioned collection, are two letters, one to the Lord Chancellor Bathurſt (not Lord North, as is erroneouſly ſuppoſed) and one to Lord Mansfield;—A Petition from Dr. Dodd to the King;—A Petition from Mrs. Dodd to the Queen;—Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations of ſome length inſerted in the newſpapers, on occaſion of Earl Percy's having preſented to his Majeſty a petition for mercy to Dodd, ſigned by twenty thouſand people, but all in vain. He told me that he had alſo written a petition from the city of London; <q rend="inline">"but (ſaid he, with a ſignificant ſmile) they <hi>mended</hi> it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt of theſe articles which Johnſon wrote is <q rend="inline">"Dr. Dodd's laſt ſolemn Declaration,"</q> which he left with the ſheriff at the place of execution. Here alſo my friend marked the variations on a copy of that piece now in my poſſeſſion. Dodd inſerted, <q rend="inline">"I never knew or attended to the calls of frugality, or the needful minuteneſs of painful oeconomy;"</q> and in the next ſentence he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced the words which I diſtinguiſh by <hi>Italicks,</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"My life for ſome <hi>few unhappy</hi> years paſt has been <hi>dreadfully erroneous.</hi>"</q> Johnſon's expreſſion was <hi>hypocritical;</hi> but his remark on the margin is <q rend="inline">"With this he ſaid he could not charge himſelf."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus authentically ſettled what part of the <q rend="inline">"Occaſional Papers,"</q> concerning Dr. Dodd's miſerable ſituation, came from the pen of Johnſon, I ſhall proceed to preſent my readers with my record of the unpubliſhed writings relating to that extraordinary and intereſting matter.</p>
               <p>I found a letter to Dr. Johnſon from Dr. Dodd, May 23, 1777, in which <q rend="inline">"The Convict's Addreſs"</q> ſeems clearly to be meant:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>I am ſo penetrated, my ever dear Sir, with a ſenſe of your extreme benevolence towards me, that I cannot find words equal to the ſentiments of my heart.</p>
                  <p>You are too converſant in the world to need the ſlighteſt hint from me, of what infinite utility the Speech<note n="4" place="bottom">His Speech at the Old-Bailey, when found guilty.</note> on the aweful day has been to me. I experience, every hour, ſome good effect from it. I am ſure that effects ſtill
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0548300102:139"/>
more ſalutary and important, muſt follow from <hi>your kind and intended favour.</hi>  I will labour,—GOD being my helper,—to do juſtice to it from the pulpit. I am ſure, had I your ſentiments conſtantly to deliver from thence, in all their mighty force and power, not a ſoul could be left unconvinced and unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded. * * * * * * * *.</p>
               </q>
               <p>He added, <q rend="inline">"May GOD ALMIGHTY bleſs and reward, with his choiceſt comforts, your philanthropick actions, and enable me at all times to expreſs what I feel of the high and uncommon obligations which I owe to the <hi>firſt man</hi> in our times."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Sunday, June 22, he writes, begging Dr. Johnſon's aſſiſtance in framing a ſupplicatory letter to his Majeſty:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"If his Majeſty could be moved of his royal clemency to ſpare me and my family the horrours and ignominy of a <hi>publick death,</hi> which the <hi>publick</hi> itſelf is ſolicitous to wave, and to grant me in ſome ſilent diſtant corner of the globe, to paſs the remainder of my days in penitence and prayer, I would bleſs his clemency and be humbled."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This letter was brought to Dr. Johnſon when in church. He ſtooped down and read it, and wrote, when he went home, the following letter for Dr. Dodd to the King:

                        <p>I MOST ſeriouſly enjoin you not to let it be at all known that I have written this letter, and to return the copy to Mr. Allen in a cover to me. I hope I need not tell you, that I wiſh it ſucceſs.—But do not indulge hope.—Tell nobody.</p>
                     </body>
                  </floatingText>It happened luckily that Mr. Allen was pitched on to aſſiſt in this melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly office, for he was a great friend of Mr. Akerman, the keeper of Newgate. Dr. Johnſon never went to ſee Dr. Dodd. He ſaid to me, it would have done <hi>him</hi> more harm, than good to Dodd, who once expreſſed a deſire to ſee him, but not earneſtly.</p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon, on the 20th of June, wrote the following letter:</p>
               <p>
                  <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <head>To the Right Honourable <hi>CHARLES JENKINSON.</hi>

                           <salute>SIR,</salute>

                        <p>SINCE the conviction and condemnation of Dr. Dodd, I have had, by the intervention of a friend, ſome intercourſe with him, and I am ſure I ſhall loſe nothing in your opinion by tenderneſs and commiſeration. Whatever be the crime, it is not eaſy to have any knowledge of the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent without a wiſh that his life may be ſpared, at leaſt when no life has been taken away by him. I will, therefore, take the liberty of ſuggeſting ſome reaſons for which I wiſh this unhappy being to eſcape the utmoſt rigour of his ſentence.</p>
                        <p>He is, ſo far as I can recollect, the firſt clergyman of our church who has ſuffered publick execution for immorality; and I know not whether it would not be more for the intereſt of religion to bury ſuch an offender in the obſcurity of perpetual exile, than to expoſe him in a cart, and on the gallows, to all who for any reaſon are enemies to the clergy.</p>

The ſupreme power has, in all ages, paid ſome attention to the voice of  the people; and that voice does not leaſt deſerve to be heard, when it calls out for mercy. There is now a very general deſire that Dodd's life ſhould be ſpared. More is not wiſhed; and, perhaps, this is not too much to be granted.</p>
                        <p>If you, Sir, have any opportunity of enforcing theſe reaſons; you may, perhaps, think them worthy of conſideration: but whatever you determine, I moſt reſpectfully intreat that you will be pleaſed to pardon for this intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</p>

               <p>It has been confidently circulated, with invidious remarks, that to this letter no attention whatever was paid by Mr. Jenkinſon, now Lord Hawkeſbury; and that he did not even deign to ſhew the common civility of owning the receipt of it. I could not but wonder at ſuch conduct in the noble Lord, whoſe own character and juſt elevation in life, I thought, muſt have impreſſed him with all due regard for great abilities and attainments. As the ſtory had been much talked of, and apparently from good authority, I could not but have animadverted upon it in this work, had it been as was alledged; but from my earneſt love of truth, and having found reaſon to think that there might be a miſtake, I preſumed to write to his Lordſhip, requeſting an explanation; and it is with the ſincereſt pleaſure that I am enabled to aſſure the world, that there is no foundation for it, the fact being, that owing to ſome neglect, or accident, Johnſon's letter never came to Lord Hawkeſbury's hands. I ſhould have thought it ſtrange indeed, if that noble Lord had undervalued my illuſtrious friend; but inſtead of this being the caſe, his Lordſhip, in the very polite anſwer with which he was pleaſed immediately to honour me, thus expreſſes himſelf:—<q rend="inline">"I have always reſpected the memory of Dr. Johnſon, and admire his writings; and I frequently read many parts of them with pleaſure and great improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</q>
               </p>
               <p>All applications for the Royal Mercy having failed, Dr. Dodd prepared himſelf for death; and, with a warmth of gratitude, wrote to Dr. Johnſon as follows:

                        <p>THAT which is appointed to all men is now coming upon you.

               </p>
               <p>To conclude this intereſting epiſode with an uſeful application, let us now attend to the reflections of Johnſon at the end of the <q rend="inline">"Occaſional Papers,"</q> concerning the unfortunate Dr. Dodd.—<q rend="inline">"Such were the laſt thoughts of a man whom we have ſeen exulting in popularity, and ſunk in ſhame. For
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0548300102:143" rendition="simple:additions"/>
his reputation, which no man can give to himſelf, thoſe who conferred it are  to anſwer. Of his publick miniſtry the means of judging were ſufficiently attainable. He muſt be allowed to preach well, whoſe ſermons ſtrike his audience with forcible conviction. Of his life, thoſe who thought it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his doctrine did not originally form falſe notions. He was at firſt what he endeavoured to make others; but the world broke down his reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he in time ceaſed to exemplify his own inſtructions.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>"Let thoſe who are tempted to his faults, tremble at his puniſhment; and thoſe whom he impreſſed from the pulpit with religious ſentiments, endeavour to confirm them by conſidering the regret and ſelf-abhorrence with which he reviewed in priſon his deviations from rectitude."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon gave us this evening, in his happy diſcriminative manner, a portrait of the late Mr. Fitzherbert, of Derbyſhire. <q rend="inline">"There was (ſaid he) no ſparkle, no brilliancy in Fitzherbert; but I never knew a man who was ſo generally acceptable. He made every body quite eaſy, overpowered nobody by the ſuperiority of his talents, made no man think worſe of himſelf by being his rival, ſeemed always to liſten, did not oblige you to hear much from him, and did not oppoſe what you ſaid. Every body liked him; but he had no friend, as I underſtand the word, nobody with whom he exchanged intimate thoughts. People were willing to think well of every thing about him. A gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman was making an affected rant, as many people do, of great feelings about 'his dear ſon,' who was at ſchool near London; how anxious he was leſt he might be ill, and what he would give to ſee him. 'Can't you (ſaid Fitzherbert) take a poſt-chaiſe and go to him?' This, to be ſure, <hi>finiſhed</hi> the affected man, but there was not much in it. However this was circulated as wit for a whole winter, and I believe part of a ſummer too; a proof that he was no very witty man. He was an inſtance of the truth of the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that a man will pleaſe more upon the whole by negative qualities than by poſitive; by never offending, than by giving a great deal of delight. In the firſt place, men hate more ſteadily than they love; and if I have ſaid ſomething to hurt a man once, I ſhall not get the better of this by ſaying many things to pleaſe him."</q>

               <p>Tueſday, September 16, Dr. Johnſon having mentioned to me the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary ſize and price of ſome cattle reared by Dr. Taylor, I rode out with our hoſt, ſurveyed his farm, and was ſhown one cow which he had ſold for a hundred and twenty guineas, and another for which he had been offered a hundred and thirty. Taylor thus deſcribed to me his old ſchoolfellow and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0548300102:144" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 friend, Johnſon: <q rend="inline">"He is a man of a very clear head, great power of words, and a very gay imagination; but there is no diſputing with him. He will not hear you, and having a louder voice than you, muſt roar you down."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the afternoon I tried to get Dr. Johnſon to like the Poems of Mr. Hamilton of Bangour, which I had brought with me: I had been much pleaſed with them at a very early age; the impreſſion ſtill remained on my mind: it was confirmed by the opinion of my friend the Honourable Andrew Erſkine, himſelf both a good poet and a good critick, who thought Hamilton as true a poet as ever wrote, and that his not having fame was unaccountable. Johnſon upon repeated occaſions, while I was at Aſhbourne, talked ſlightingly of Hamilton. He ſaid there was no power of thinking in his verſes, nothing that ſtrikes one, nothing better than what you generally find in magazines; and that the higheſt praiſe they deſerved was, that they were very well for a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman to hand about among his friends. He ſaid the imitation of <hi>Ne ſit ancillae tibi amor</hi> &amp;c. was too ſolemn; he read part of it at the beginning. He read the beautiful pathetick ſong, <q rend="inline">"Ah the poor ſhepherd's mournful fate,"</q> and did not ſeem to give attention to what I had been uſed to think tender elegant ſtrains, but laughed at the rhyme, in Scotch pronunciation, <hi>wiſhes</hi> and <hi>bluſhes,</hi> reading <hi>wuſhes</hi>—and there he ſtopped. He owned that the epitaph on Lord Newhall was pretty well done. He read the <q rend="inline">"Inſcription in a Summer-houſe,"</q> and a little of the imitations of Horace's Epiſtles; but ſaid, he found nothing to make him deſire to read on. When I urged that there were ſome good poetical paſſages in the book. <q rend="inline">"Where (ſaid he) will you find ſo large a collection without ſome."</q> I thought the deſcription of Winter might obtain his approbation:</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"See Winter, from the frozen north,</l>
                     <l>"Drives his iron chariot forth!</l>
                     <l>"His griſly hand in icy chains</l>
                     <l>"Fair Tweeda's ſilver ſlood conſtrains," &amp;c.</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>He aſked why an <q rend="inline">"<hi>iron</hi> chariot;"</q> and ſaid <q rend="inline">"icy chains"</q> was an old image. I was ſtruck with the uncertainty of taſte, and ſomewhat ſorry that a poet whom I had long read with fondneſs, was not approved by Dr. Johnſon. I comforted myſelf with thinking that the beauties were too delicate for his robuſt perceptions. Garrick maintained that he had not a taſte for the fineſt productions of genius: but I was ſenſible, that when he took the trouble to analyſe critically, he generally convinced us that he was right.</p>

In the evening, the Reverend Mr. Seward, of Lichfield, who was paſſing  through Aſhbourne in his way home, drank tea with us. Johnſon deſcribed him thus:—<q rend="inline">"Sir, his ambition is to be a fine talker; ſo he goes to Buxton, and ſuch places, where he may find companies to liſten to him. And, Sir, he is a valetudinarian, one of thoſe who are always mending themſelves. I do not know a more diſagreeable character than a valetudinarian, who thinks he may do any thing that is for his eaſe, and indulges himſelf in the groſſeſt freedoms: Sir, he brings himſelf to the ſtate of a hog in a ſtye."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Taylor's noſe happening to bleed, he ſaid, it was becauſe he had omitted to have himſelf blooded four days after a quarter of a year's interval. Dr. Johnſon, who was a great dabbler in phyſick, diſapproved much of periodical bleeding. <q rend="inline">"For (ſaid he) you accuſtom yourſelf to an evacuation which Nature cannot perform of herſelf, and therefore ſhe cannot help you, ſhould you, from forgetfulneſs or any other cauſe, omit it; ſo you may be ſuddenly ſuffocated. You may accuſtom yourſelf to other periodical evacuations, becauſe ſhould you omit them, Nature can ſupply the omiſſion; but Nature cannot open a vein to blood you."</q>—<q rend="inline">"I do not like to take an emetick, (ſaid Taylor,) for fear of breaking ſome ſmall veſſels."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Poh! (ſaid Johnſon) if you have ſo many things that will break, you had better break your neck at once, and there's an end on't. You will break no ſmall veſſels."</q> (blowing with high deriſion).</p>
               <p>I mentioned to Dr. Johnſon, that David Hume's perſiſting in his infidelity, when he was dying, ſhocked me much. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why ſhould it ſhock you, Sir? Hume owned he had never read the New Teſtament with attention. Here then was a man who had been at no pains to inquire into the truth of religion, and had continually turned his mind the other way. It was not to be expected that the proſpect of death would alter his way of thinking, unleſs GOD ſhould ſend an angel to ſet him right."</q> I ſaid, I had reaſon to believe that the thought of annihilation gave Hume no pain. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It was not ſo, Sir. He had a vanity in being thought eaſy. It is more probable that he ſhould aſſume an appearance of eaſe, than that ſo very improbable a thing ſhould be, as a man not afraid of going (as, in ſpite of his deluſive theory, he cannot be ſure but he may go,) into an unknown ſtate, and not being uneaſy at leaving all he knew. And you are to conſider, that upon his own principle of annihilation he had no motive to ſpeak the truth."</q> The horrour of death which I had always obſerved in Dr. Johnſon, appeared ſtrong to-night. I ventured to tell him, that I had been, for moments of my life, not afraid of death; therefore I could ſuppoſe another man in that ſtate of mind for a
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0548300102:146" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 conſiderable ſpace of time. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"he never had a moment in which death was not terrible to him."</q> He added, that it had been obſerved, that almoſt no man dies in publick, but with apparent reſolution; from that deſire of praiſe which never quits us. I ſaid, Dr. Dodd ſeemed to be willing to die, and full of hopes of happineſs. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) Dr. Dodd would have given both his hands and both his legs to have lived. The better a man is, the more afraid is he of death, having a clearer view of infinite purity."</q> He owned, that our being in an unhappy uncertainty as to our ſalvation, was myſterious; and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Ah! we muſt wait till we are in another ſtate of being, to have many things explained to us."</q> Even the powerful mind of Johnſon ſeemed foiled by futurity. But I thought, that the gloom of uncertainty in ſolemn religious ſpeculation, being mingled with hope, was yet more conſolatory than the emptineſs of infidelity. A man can live in thick air, but periſhes in an exhauſted receiver.</p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon was much pleaſed with a remark which I told him was made to me by General Paoli:—<q rend="inline">"That it is impoſſible not to be afraid of death; and that thoſe who at the time of dying are not afraid, are not thinking of death, but of applauſe, or ſomething elſe, which keeps death out of their ſight: ſo that all men are equally afraid of death when they ſee it; only ſome have a power of turning their ſight away from it better than others."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, September 17, Dr. Butter, phyſician at Derby, drank tea with us; and it was ſettled that Dr. Johnſon and I ſhould go on Friday and dine with him. Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I'm glad of this."</q> He ſeemed weary of the uniformity of life at Dr. Taylor's.</p>
               <p>Talking of biography, I ſaid, in writing a life a man's peculiarities ſhould be mentioned, becauſe they mark his character. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, there is no doubt as to peculiarities: the queſtion is, whether a man's vices ſhould be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned; for inſtance, whether it ſhould be mentioned that Addiſon and Parnel drank too freely: for people will probably more eaſily indulge in drinking from knowing this; ſo that more ill may be done by the example, than good by telling the whole truth."</q> Here was an inſtance of his varying from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in talk; for when Lord Hailes and he ſat one morning calmly converſing in my houſe at Edinburgh, I well remember that Dr. Johnſon maintained, that <q rend="inline">"if a man is to write <hi>A Panegyrick,</hi> he may keep vices out of ſight; but if he profeſſes to write <hi>A Life,</hi> he muſt repreſent it really as it was:"</q> and when I objected to the danger of telling that Parnel drank to exceſs, he ſaid, that <q rend="inline">"it would produce an inſtructive caution to avoid drinking, when it was ſeen, that even the learning and genius of Parnel could be debaſed by it."</q> And
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:0548300102:147" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in the Hebrides he maintained, as appears from my <q rend="inline">"Journal <note n="5" place="bottom">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides, 3d edit. p. 240.</note>,"</q> that a man's  intimate friend ſhould mention his faults, if he writes his life.</p>
               <p>He had this evening, partly, I ſuppoſe, from the ſpirit of contradiction to his Whig friend, a violent argument with Dr. Taylor, as to the inclinations of the people of England at this time towards the Royal Family of Stuart. He grew ſo outrageous as to ſay, <q rend="inline">"that, if England were fairly polled, the preſent King would be ſent away to-night, and his adherents hanged to-morrow."</q> Taylor, who was as violent a Whig as Johnſon was a Tory, was rouſed by this to a pitch of bellowing. He denied, loudly, what Johnſon ſaid; and maintained, that there was an abhorrence againſt the Stuart family, though he admitted that the people were not much attached to the preſent King <note n="6" place="bottom">Dr. Taylor was very ready to make this admiſſion, becauſe the party with which he was connected was not in power. There was then ſome truth in it, owing to the pertinacity of factious clamour. Had he lived till now, it would have been impoſſible for him to deny that his Majeſty poſſeſſes the warmeſt affection of his people.</note>. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, the ſtate of the country is this: the people knowing it to be agreed on all hands that this King has not the hereditary right to the crown, and there being no hope that he who has it can be reſtored, have grown cold and indifferent upon the ſubject of loyalty, and have no warm attachment to any King. They would not, therefore, riſk any thing to reſtore the exiled family. They would not give twenty ſhillings a piece to bring it about. But, if a mere vote could do it, there would be twenty to one; at leaſt, there would be a very great majority of voices for it. For, Sir, you are to conſider, that all thoſe who think a King has a right to his crown, as a man has to his eſtate, which is the juſt opinion, would be for reſtoring the King who certainly has the hereditary right, could he be truſted with it; in which there would be no danger now, when laws and every thing elſe are ſo much advanced; and every King will govern by the laws. And you muſt alſo conſider, Sir, that there is nothing on the other ſide to oppoſe to this; for it is not alledged by any one that the preſent family has any inherent right: ſo that the Whigs could not have a conteſt between two rights."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Taylor admitted, that if the queſtion as to hereditary right were to be tried by a poll of the people of England, to be ſure the abſtract doctrine would be given in favour of the family of Stuart; but he ſaid, the conduct of that family, which occaſioned their expulſion, was ſo freſh in the minds of the people, that they would not vote for a reſtoration. Dr. Johnſon, I think,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0548300102:148"/>
 was contented with the admiſſion as to the hereditary right, leaving the original point in diſpute, <hi>viz.</hi> what the people upon the whole would do, taking in right and affection; for he ſaid, people were afraid of a change, even when they thought it right. Dr. Taylor ſaid ſomething of the ſlight foundation of the here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary right of the houſe of Stuart. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) the houſe of Stuart ſucceeded to the full right of both the houſes of York and Lancaſter, whoſe common ſource had the undiſputed right. A right to a throne is like a right to any thing elſe. Poſſeſſion is ſufficient, where no better right can be ſhewn. This was the caſe with the Royal Family of England, as it is now with the King of France: for as to the firſt beginning of the right, we are in the dark."</q>

               <p>Thurſday, September 18. Laſt night Dr. Johnſon had propoſed that the cryſtal luſtre, or chandelier, in Dr. Taylor's large room, ſhould be lighted up ſome time or other. Taylor ſaid, it ſhould be lighted up next night. <q rend="inline">"That will do very well, (ſaid I,) for it is Dr. Johnſon's birth-day."</q> When we were in the Iſle of Sky, Johnſon had deſired me not to mention his birth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day. He did not ſeem pleaſed at this time that I mentioned it, and ſaid (ſomewhat ſternly) <q rend="inline">"he would <hi>not</hi> have the luſtre lighted the next night."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Some ladies, who had been preſent yeſterday when I mentioned his birth-day, came to dinner to-day, and plagued him unintentionally, by wiſhing him joy. I know not why he diſliked having his birth-day mentioned, unleſs it were that it reminded him of his approaching nearer to death, of which he had a conſtant dread.</p>
               <p>I mentioned to him a friend of mine who was formerly gloomy from low ſpirits, and much diſtreſſed by the fear of death, but was now uniformly placid, and contemplated his diſſolution without any perturbation. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) this is only a diſordered imagination taking a different turn."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of a collection being made of all the Engliſh Poets who had publiſhed a volume of poems. Johnſon told me, <q rend="inline">"that a Mr. Coxeter, whom he knew, had gone the greateſt length towards this; having collected, I think, about five hundred volumes of poets whoſe works were little known, but that upon his death Tom Oſborne bought them, and they were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, which he thought a pity, as it was curious to ſee any ſeries com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete; and in every volume of poems ſomething good may be found."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He obſerved, that a gentleman of eminence in literature had got into a bad ſtyle of poetry of late. <q rend="inline">"He puts (ſaid he) a very common thing in a ſtrange dreſs till he does not know it himſelf, and thinks other people do not

If I ſay a man is drunk, and you tell me it is owing to his taking much drink, the matter is not mended. No, Sir,—has taken to an odd mode. For example; he'd write thus:

                        <l>'Wearing out life's evening gray."</l>
                     </q>
                     <hi>Gray evening</hi> is common enough; but <hi>evening gray</hi> he'd think fine.—Stay;—we'll make out the ſtanza:

                           <p>"In ſpring, 1779, when in better humour, he made the ſecond ſtanza, as in the text.

 I cannot help thinking the firſt ſtanza very good ſolemn poetry, as alſo the three firſt lines of the ſecond. Its laſt line is an excellent burleſque ſurprize on gloomy ſentimental enquirers. And, perhaps, the advice is as good as can be given to a low-ſpirited diſſatisfied being.—<q rend="inline">"Don't trouble your head with ſickly thinking: take a cup, and be merry."</q>

               <p>Friday, September 19, after breakfaſt, Dr. Johnſon and I ſet out in Dr. Taylor's chaiſe to go to Derby. The day was fine, and we reſolved to go by Keddleſtone, the ſeat of Lord Scarſdale, that I might ſee his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's fine houſe. I was ſtruck with the magnificence of the building; and the extenſive park, with the fineſt verdure, covered with deer, and cattle, and ſheep, delighted me. The number of old oaks, of an immenſe ſize, filled me with a ſort of reſpectful admiration: for one of them ſixty pounds was offered. The excellent ſmooth gravel roads; the large piece of water formed by his Lordſhip from ſome ſmall brooks, with a handſome barge upon it; the venerable Gothick church, now the family chapel, juſt by the houſe; in ſhort, the grand groupe of objects agitated and diſtended my mind in a moſt agreeable manner. <q rend="inline">"One ſhould think (ſaid I) that the proprietor of all this <hi>muſt</hi> be happy."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) all this excludes but one evil—poverty <note n="8" place="bottom">When I mentioned Dr. Johnſon's remark to a lady of admirable good ſenſe and quickneſs of underſtanding, ſhe obſerved, <q rend="inline">"It is true, all this excludes only one evil; but how much good does it let in?"</q>
                     </note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our names were ſent up, and a well-dreſt elderly houſekeeper, a moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct articulator, ſhewed us the houſe; which I need not deſcribe, as it is publiſhed in <q rend="inline">"Adams's Works in Architecture."</q> Dr. Johnſon thought better of it to-day than when he ſaw it before; for the other night he attacked it violently, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"It would do excellently for a town hall. The large room with the pillars (ſaid he) would do for the Judges to ſit in at the aſſizes; the circular room for a jury chamber; and the rooms above for priſoners."</q> Still he thought the large room ill lighted, and of no uſe but for dancing in; and the bed-chambers but indifferent rooms; and that the immenſe ſum which it coſt was injudiciouſly laid out. Dr. Taylor had put him in mind of his <hi>appearing</hi> pleaſed with the houſe. <q rend="inline">"But (ſaid he) that was when Lord Scarſdale was preſent. Politeneſs obliges us to appear pleaſed with a man's works when he is preſent. No man will be ſo ill bred as to queſtion you. You may therefore pay compliments without ſaying what is not true. I ſhould
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:0548300102:151" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſay to Lord Scarſdale of his large room, 'My Lord, this is the moſt <hi>coſtly</hi>  room that I ever ſaw;' which is true."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Manningham, phyſician in London, who was viſiting at Lord Scarſdale's, accompanied us through many of the rooms, and ſoon afterwards my Lord himſelf, to whom Dr. Johnſon was known, appeared, and did the honours of the houſe. We talked of Mr. Langton. Johnſon, with a warm vehemence of affectionate regard, exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"The earth does not bear a worthier man than Bennet Langton."</q> We ſaw a good many fine pictures, which I think are deſcribed in one of <q rend="inline">"Young's Tours."</q> There is a printed catalogue of them which the houſekeeper put into my hand; I ſhould like to view them at leiſure. I was much ſtruck with Daniel interpreting Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar's dream by Rembrandt. We were ſhown a pretty large library. In his Lordſhip's dreſſing-room lay Johnſon's ſmall Dictionary: he ſhewed it to me, with ſome eagerneſs, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Look'ye! <hi>Quae terra noſtri non plena laboris.</hi>"</q> He obſerved, alſo, Goldſmith's <q rend="inline">"Animated Nature;"</q> and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Here's our friend! The poor Doctor would have been happy to hear of this."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In our way, Johnſon ſtrongly expreſſed his love of driving faſt in a poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaiſe. <q rend="inline">"If (ſaid he) I had no duties, and no reference to futurity, I would ſpend my life in driving briſkly in a poſt-chaiſe with a pretty woman; but ſhe ſhould be one who could underſtand me, and would add ſomething to the converſation."</q> I obſerved, that we were this day to ſtop juſt where the Highland army did in 1745. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It was a noble attempt."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I wiſh we could have an authentick hiſtory of it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"If you were not an idle dog you might write it, by collecting from every body what they can tell, and putting down your authorities."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But I could not have the advantage of it in my life-time."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You might have the ſatisfaction of its fame, by printing it in Holland; and as to profit, conſider how long it was before writing came to be conſidered in a pecuniary view. Baretti ſays, he is the firſt man that ever received copy-money in Italy."</q> I ſaid, that I would endeavour to do what Dr. Johnſon ſuggeſted; and I thought that I might write ſo as to venture to publiſh my <q rend="inline">"Hiſtory of the Civil War in Great-Britain in 1745 and 1746,"</q> without being obliged to go to a foreign preſs <note n="9" place="bottom">I am now happy to underſtand, that Mr. John Home, who was himſelf gallantly in the field for the reigning family, in that intereſting warfare, but is generous enough to do juſtice to the other ſide, is preparing an account of it for the preſs.</note>.</p>

 When we arrived at Derby, Dr. Butter accompanied us to ſee the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory of china there. I admired the ingenuity and delicate art with which a man faſhioned clay into a cup, a ſaucer, or a tea-pot, while a boy turned round a wheel to give the maſs rotundity. I thought this as excellent in its ſpecies of power, as making good verſes in <hi>its</hi> ſpecies. Yet I had no reſpect for this potter. Neither, indeed, has a man of any extent of thinking for a mere verſe-maker, in whoſe numbers, however perfect, there is no poetry, no mind. The china was beautiful; but Dr. Johnſon juſtly obſerved, it was too dear; for that he could have veſſels of ſilver, of the ſame ſize, as cheap as what were here made of porcelain.</p>
               <p>I felt a pleaſure in walking about Derby, ſuch as I always have in walking about any town to which I am not accuſtomed. There is an immediate ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of novelty; and one ſpeculates on the way in which life is paſſed in it, which, although there is a ſameneſs every where upon the whole, is yet minutely diverſified. The minute diverſities in every thing are wonderful. Talking of ſhaving the other night at Dr. Taylor's, Dr. Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, of a thouſand ſhavers, two do not ſhave ſo much alike as not to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed."</q> I thought this not poſſible, till he ſpecified ſo many of the varieties in ſhaving;—holding the razor more or leſs perpendicular;—drawing long or ſhort ſtrokes;—beginning at the upper part of the face, or the under;—at the right ſide or the left ſide. Indeed, when one conſiders what variety of ſounds can be uttered by the wind-pipe, in the compaſs of a very ſmall aperture, we may be convinced how many degrees of difference there may be in the application of a razor.</p>
               <p>We dined with Dr. Butter, whoſe lady is daughter of my couſin Sir John Douglas, whoſe grandſon is now preſumptive heir of the noble family of Queenſberry. Johnſon and he had a good deal of medical converſation. Johnſon ſaid, he had ſomewhere or other given an account of Dr. Nichols's diſcourſe <q rend="inline">"De Animâ Medicâ."</q> He told us, <q rend="inline">"that whatever a man's diſtemper was, Dr. Nichols would not attend him as a phyſician, if his mind was not at eaſe; for he believed that no medicines would have any influence. He once attended a man in trade, upon whom he found none of the medicines he preſcribed had any effect; he aſked the man's wife privately whether his affairs were not in a bad way? She ſaid no. He continued his attendance ſome time, ſtill without ſucceſs. At length the man's wife told him, ſhe had diſcovered that her huſband's affairs <hi>were</hi> in a bad way. When Goldſmith was dying, Dr. Turton ſaid to him, 'Your pulſe is in greater diſorder than it
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0548300102:153" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhould be, from the degree of fever which you have: is your mind at eaſe?'  Goldſmith anſwered it was not."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After dinner, Mrs. Butter went with me to ſee the ſilk-mill which Sir Thomas Lambe had a patent for, having brought away the contrivance from Italy. I am not very converſant with mechanicks; but the ſimplicity of this machine, and its multiplied operations, ſtruck me with an agreeable ſurprize. I had learnt from Dr. Johnſon, during this interview, not to think with a dejected indifference of the works of art, and the pleaſures of life, becauſe life is uncertain and ſhort; but to conſider ſuch indifference as a failure of reaſon, a morbidneſs of mind; for happineſs ſhould be cultivated as much as we can, and the objects which are inſtrumental to it ſhould be ſteadily conſidered as of importance, with a reference not only to ourſelves, but to multitudes in ſucceſſive ages. Though it is proper to value ſmall parts, as
<q>
                     <l>"Sands make the mountain, moments make the year <note n="9" place="bottom">Young.</note>;"</l>
                  </q>
yet we muſt contemplate, collectively, to have a juſt eſtimation of objects. One moment's being uneaſy or not, ſeems of no conſequence; yet this may be thought of the next, and the next, and ſo on, till there is a large portion of miſery. In the ſame way one muſt think of happineſs, of learning, of friendſhip. We cannot tell the preciſe moment when friendſhip is formed. As in filling a veſſel drop by drop there is at laſt a drop which makes it run over; ſo in a ſeries of kindneſſes there is at laſt one which makes the heart run over. We muſt not divide objects of our attention into minute parts, and think ſeparately of each part. It is by contemplating a large maſs of human exiſtence, that a man, while he ſets a juſt value on his own life, does not think of his death as annihilating all that is great and pleaſing in the world, as if actually <hi>contained in his mind,</hi> according to Berkeley's reverie. If his imagination be not ſickly and feeble, it <q rend="inline">"wings its diſtant way"</q> far beyond himſelf, and views the world in unceaſing activity of every ſort. It muſt be acknowledged, however, that Pope's plaintive reflection, that all things would be as gay as ever on the day of his death, is natural and common. We are apt to transfer to all around us our own gloom, without conſidering that at any given point of time there is, perhaps, as much youth and gaiety in the world as at another. Before I came into this life, in which I have had ſo many pleaſant ſcenes, have not thouſands and ten thouſands of deaths and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0548300102:154" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 funerals happened, and have not families been in grief for their neareſt relations? But have thoſe diſmal circumſtances at all affected <hi>me?</hi> Why then ſhould the gloomy ſcenes which I experience, or which I know, affect others? Let us guard againſt imagining that there is an end of felicity upon earth, when we ourſelves grow old, or are unhappy.</p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon told us at tea, that when ſome of Dr. Dodd's pious friends were trying to conſole him by ſaying that he was going to leave <q rend="inline">"a wretched world,"</q> he had honeſty enough not to join in the cant:—<q rend="inline">"No, no, (ſaid he,) it has been a very agreeable world to me."</q> Johnſon added, <q rend="inline">"I reſpect Dodd for thus ſpeaking the truth; for, to be ſure, he had for ſeveral years enjoyed a life of great voluptuouſneſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He told us, that Dodd's city friends ſtood by him ſo, that a thouſand pounds were ready to be given to the gaoler, if he would let him eſcape.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He added, that he knew a friend of Dodd's, who walked about Newgate for ſome time on the evening before the day of his execution, with five hundred pounds in his pocket, ready to be paid to any of the turnkeys who could get him out: but it was too late; for he was watched with much circumſpection. He ſaid, Dodd's friends had an image of him made of wax, which was to have been left in his place; and he believed it was carried into the priſon.</p>
               <p>Johnſon diſapproved of Dr. Dodd's leaving the world perſuaded that <q rend="inline">"The Convict's Addreſs to his unhappy Brethren,"</q> was of his own writing. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, (ſaid I,) you contributed to the deception; for when Mr. Seward expreſſed a doubt to you that it was not Dodd's own, becauſe it had a great deal more force of mind in it than any thing known to be his, you anſwered,—'Why ſhould you think ſo? Depend upon it, Sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, as Dodd got it from me to paſs as his own, while that could do him any good, there was an <hi>implied promiſe</hi> that I ſhould not own it. To own it, therefore, would have been telling a lie, with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of breach of promiſe, which was worſe than ſimply telling a lie to make it be believed it was Dodd's. Beſides, Sir, I did not <hi>directly</hi> tell a lie: I left the matter uncertain. Perhaps I thought that Seward would not believe it the leſs to be mine for what I ſaid; but I would not put it in his power to ſay I had owned it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He praiſed Blair's ſermons: <q rend="inline">"Yet,"</q> ſaid he, (willing to let us ſee he was aware that faſhionable fame, however deſerved, is not always the moſt laſting,) <q rend="inline">"perhaps, they may not be re-printed after ſeven years; at leaſt not after Blair's death."</q>

He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Goldſmith was a plant that flowered late. There appeared  nothing remarkable about him when he was young; though when he had got high in fame, one of his friends began to recollect ſomething of his being diſtinguiſhed at College. Goldſmith in the ſame manner recollected more of that friend's early years, as he grew a greater man."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned that Lord Monboddo told me, he awaked every morning at four, and then for his health got up and walked in his room naked, with the window open, which he called taking <hi>an air bath;</hi> after which he went to bed again, and ſlept two hours more. Johnſon, who was always ready to beat down any thing that ſeemed to be exhibited with diſproportionate importance, thus obſerved: <q rend="inline">"I ſuppoſe, Sir, there is no more in it than this, he awaltes at four, and cannot ſleep till he chills himſelf, and makes the warmth of the bed a grateful ſenſation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I talked of the difficulty of riſing in the morning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Dr. Johnſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> told me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <q rend="inline">"that the learned Mrs. Carter, at that period when ſhe was eager in ſtudy, did not awake as early as ſhe wiſhed, and ſhe therefore had a contrivance, that, at a certain hour, her chamber-light ſhould burn a ſtring to which a heavy weight was ſuſpended, which then fell with a ſtrong ſudden noiſe: this rouſed her from ſleep, and then ſhe had no difficulty in getting up."</q> But I ſaid that was my difficulty, and wiſhed there could be ſome medicine invented which would make one riſe without pain, which I never did, unleſs after lying in bed a very long time. Perhaps there may be ſomething in the ſtores of Nature which can do this. I have thought of a pulley to raiſe me gradually<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but that would give me pain, as it would counteract my internal inclination. I would have ſomething that can diſſipate the <hi>vis inertiae,</hi> and give elaſticity to the muſcles. As I imagine that the human body may be put, by the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of other ſubſtances, into any ſtate in which it has ever been; and as I have experienced a ſtate in which riſing from bed was not diſagreeable but eaſy, nay, ſometimes agreeable; I ſuppoſe that this ſtate may be produced, if we knew by what. We can heat the body, we can cool it; we can give it tenſion or relaxation; and ſurely it is poſſible to bring it into a ſtate in which riſing from bed will not be a pain.</p>
               <p>Johnſon obſerved, <q rend="inline">"that a man ſhould take a ſufficient quantity of ſleep, which Dr. Mead ſays is between ſeven and nine hours."</q> I told him, that Dr. Cullen ſaid to me, that a man ſhould not take more ſleep than he can take at once. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"This rule, Sir, cannot hold in all caſes; for many people have their ſleep broken by ſickneſs; and ſurely, Cullen would not have a man to get up, after having ſlept but an hour.

                     <note n="1" place="bottom">This regimen was, however, practiſed by Biſhop Ken, of whom Hawkins (not Sir John) in his Life of that venerable Prelate, page 4, tells us, <q rend="inline">"And that neither his ſtudy might be the aggreſſor on his hours of inſtruction, or what he judged his duty prevent his improvements; or both, his cloſet addreſſes to his GOD; he ſtrictly accuſtomed himſelf to but one ſleep, which often obliged him to riſe at one or two of the clock in the morning, and ſometimes ſooner; and grew ſo habitual, that it continued with him almoſt till his laſt illneſs. And ſo lively and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful was his temper, that he would be very facetious and entertaining to his friends in the evening, even when it was perceived that with difficulty he kept his eyes open; and then ſeemed to go to reſt with no other purpoſe than the refreſhing and enabling him with more vigour and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to ſing his morning hymn, as he then uſed to do to his lute, before he put on his cloaths."</q>
                     </note>."</q> Dr. Taylor remarked, I think very juſtly, <q rend="inline">"that a man who does not feel an inclination to ſleep at the ordinary time, inſtead of being ſtronger than other people, muſt not be well; for a man in health has all the natural inclinations to eat, drink, and ſleep, in a ſtrong degree."</q>

               </p>
               <p>As we drove back to Aſhbourne, Dr. Johnſon recommended to me, as he had often done, to drink water only: <q rend="inline">"For (ſaid he) you are then ſure not to get drunk; whereas if you drink wine you are never ſure."</q> I ſaid, drinking wine was a pleaſure which I was unwilling to give up. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, (ſaid he,) there is no doubt that not to drink wine is a great deduction from life; but it may be neceſſary."</q> He however owned, that in his opinion a free uſe of wine did not ſhorten life; and ſaid, he would not give leſs for the life of a certain Scotch Lord (whom he named) celebrated for hard drinking, than for that of a ſober man. <q rend="inline">"But ſtay, (ſaid he, with his uſual intelligence, and accuracy of enquiry,) does it take much wine to make him drunk?"</q> I anſwered, <q rend="inline">"a great deal either of wine or ſtrong punch."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Then (ſaid he) that is the worſe."</q> I preſume to illuſtrate my friend's obſervation thus: <q rend="inline">"A fortreſs which ſoon ſurrenders has its walls leſs ſhattered, than when a long and obſtinate reſiſtance is made."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ventured to mention a perſon who was as violent a Scotſman as he was an Engliſhman; and literally had the ſame contempt for an Engliſhman compared with a Scotſman, that he had for a Scotſman compared with an Engliſhman; and that he would ſay of Dr. Johnſon, <q rend="inline">"Damned raſcal! to talk as he does of the Scotch."</q> This ſeemed, for a moment, <q rend="inline">"to give him pauſe."</q> It, perhaps, preſented his extreme prejudice againſt the Scotch in a point of view ſomewhat new to him, by the effect of <hi>contraſt.</hi>

He was much diverted with an article which I ſhewed him in the <q rend="inline">"Critical  Review"</q> of this year, giving an account of a curious publication, entitled, <q rend="inline">"A Spiritual Diary and Soliloquies, by John Rutty, M. D."</q> Dr. Rutty was one of the people called Quakers, a phyſician of ſome eminence in Dublin, and authour of ſeveral works. This Diary, which was kept from 1753 to 1775, the year in which he died, and was now publiſhed in two volumes, octavo, exhibited, in the ſimplicity of his heart, a minute and honeſt regiſter of the ſtate of his mind; which, though frequently laughable enough, was not more ſo than the hiſtory of many men would be, if recorded with equal fairneſs.</p>
               <p>The following ſpecimens were extracted by the Reviewers:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Tenth month, 1753.</p>
                  <p>23. Indulgence in bed an hour too long.</p>
                  <p>Twelfth month, 17. An hypochondriack obnubilation from wind and indigeſtion.</p>
                  <p>Ninth month, 28. An over-doſe of whiſky.</p>
                  <p>29. A dull, croſs, cholerick day.</p>
                  <p>Firſt month, 1757—22. A little ſwiniſh at dinner and repaſt.</p>
                  <p>31. Dogged on provocation.</p>
                  <p>Second month, 5. Very dogged or ſnappiſh.</p>
                  <p>14. Snappiſh on faſting.</p>
                  <p>26. Curſed ſnappiſhneſs to thoſe under me, on a bodily indiſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>Third month, 11. On a provocation, exerciſed a dumb reſentment for two days, inſtead of ſcolding.</p>
                  <p>22. Scolded too vehemently.</p>
                  <p>23. Dogged again.</p>
                  <p>Fourth month, 29. Mechanically and ſinfully dogged.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Johnſon laughed heartily at this good Quietiſt's ſelf-condemning minutes; particularly at his mentioning, with ſuch a ſerious regret, occaſional inſtances of <q rend="inline">"<hi>ſwiniſhneſs</hi> in eating, and <hi>doggedneſs of temper.</hi>"</q> He thought the obſervations of the Critical Reviewers upon the importance of a man to himſelf ſo ingenious and ſo well expreſſed, that I ſhall here introduce them.</p>
               <p>After obſerving, that <q rend="inline">"There are few writers who have gained any reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by recording their own actions,"</q> they ſay,</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"We may reduce the egotiſts to four claſſes. In the <hi>firſt</hi> we have Julius Caeſar: he relates his own tranſactions; but he relates them with peculiar grace and dignity, and his narrative is ſupported by the greatneſs of his

 character and atchievements. In the <hi>ſecond</hi> claſs we have Marcus Antoninus: this writer has given us a ſeries of reflections on his own life; but his ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are ſo noble, his morality ſo ſublime, that his meditations are univerſally admired. In the <hi>third</hi> claſs we have ſome others of tolerable credit, who have given importance to their own private hiſtory by an intermixture of literary anecdotes, and the occurrences of their own times: the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated <hi>Huetius</hi> has publiſhed an entertaining volume upon this plan, <hi>'De rebus ad eum pertinentibus.'</hi> In the <hi>fourth</hi> claſs we have the journaliſts, temporal and ſpiritual: Elias Aſhmole, William Lilly, George Whitefield, John Weſley, and a thouſand other old women and fanatick writers of memoirs and meditations."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned to him that Dr. Hugh Blair, in his lectures on Rhetorick and Belles Lettres, which I heard him deliver at Edinburgh, had animadverted on the Johnſonian ſtyle as too pompous; and attempted to imitate it, by giving a ſentence of Addiſon in <q rend="inline">"The Spectator,"</q> No. 411, in the manner of Johnſon. When treating of the utility of the pleaſures of imagination in preſerving us from vice, it is obſerved of thoſe <q rend="inline">"who know not how to be idle and innocent,"</q> that their very firſt ſtep out of buſineſs is into vice or folly; which Dr. Blair ſuppoſed would have been expreſſed in <q rend="inline">"The Rambler,"</q> thus: <q rend="inline">"Their very firſt ſtep out of the regions of buſineſs is into the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation of vice, or the vacuity of folly <note n="2" place="bottom">When Dr. Blair publiſhed his <q rend="inline">"Lectures,"</q> he was invidiouſly attacked for having omitted his cenſure on Johnſon's ſtyle, and, on the contrary, praiſing it highly. But before that time Johnſon's <q rend="inline">"Lives of the Poets"</q> had appeared, in which his ſtyle was conſiderably eaſier than when he wrote <q rend="inline">"The Rambler."</q> It would, therefore, have been uncandid in Blair, even ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing his criticiſm to have been juſt, to have preſerved it.</note>."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, theſe are not the words I ſhould have uſed. No, Sir; the imitators of my ſtyle have not hit it. Miſs Aikin has done it the beſt; for ſhe has imitated the ſentiment as well as the diction."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I intend, before this work is concluded, to exhibit ſpecimens of imitation of my friend's ſtyle in various modes; ſome caricaturing or mimicking it, and ſome formed upon it, whether intentionally or with a degree of ſimilarity to it, of which, perhaps, the writers were not conſcious.</p>
               <p>In Baretti's Review, which he publiſhed in Italy, under the title of <q rend="inline">"Fruſta Letteraria,"</q> it is obſerved, that Dr. Robertſon the hiſtorian had formed his ſtyle upon that of <q rend="inline">"Il celebre Samuele Johnſon."</q> My friend himſelf was of that opinion; for he once ſaid to me, in a pleaſant humour, <q rend="inline">"Sir, if Robertſon's
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0548300102:159" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſtyle be faulty, he owes it to me; that is, having too many words, and thoſe  too big ones."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I read to him a letter which Lord Monboddo had written to me, containing ſome critical remarks upon the ſtyle of his <q rend="inline">"Journey to the Weſtern Iſlands of Scotland."</q> His Lordſhip praiſed the very fine paſſage upon landing at Icolmkill <note n="3" place="bottom">
                     <p>
                        <q rend="inline">"WE were now treading that illuſtrious iſland, which was once the luminary of the Caledonian regions, whence ſavage clans and roving barbarians derived the benefits of knowledge, and the bleſſings of religion. To abſtract the mind from all local emotion would be impoſſible, if it were endeavoured, and would be fooliſh if it were poſſible. Whatever withdraws us from the power of our ſenſes, whatever makes the paſt, the diſtant, or the future, predominate over the preſent, advances us in the dignity of thinking beings. Far from me, and from my friends, be ſuch frigid philoſophy, as may conduct us, indifferent and unmoved, over any ground which has been dignified by wiſdom, bravery, or virtue. That man is little to be envied, whoſe patriotiſm would not gain force upon the plain of Marathon, or whoſe piety would not grow warmer among the ruins of lona."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Had our Tour produced nothing elſe but this ſublime paſſage, the world muſt have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>now<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged that it was not made in vain. The preſent reſpectable Preſident of the Royal Society was ſo much ſtruck on reading it, that he claſped his hands together, and remained for ſome time in an attitude of ſilent admiration.</p>
                  </note>; but his own ſtyle being exceedingly dry and hard, he diſapproved of the richneſs of Johnſon's language, and of his frequent uſe of metaphorical expreſſions. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, this criticiſm would be juſt, if in my ſtyle, ſuperfluous words, or words too big for the thoughts, could be pointed out; but this I do not believe can be done. For inſtance: in the paſſage which Lord Monboddo admires, 'We were now treading that illuſtrious region,' the word <hi>illuſtrious,</hi> contributes nothing to the mere narration; for the fact might be told without it: but it is not, therefore, ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous; for it wakes the mind to peculiar attention, where ſomething of more than uſual importance is to be preſented. 'Illuſtrious!'—for what? and then the ſentence proceeds to expand the circumſtances connected with Iona. And, Sir, as to metaphorical expreſſion, that is a great excellence in ſtyle, when it is uſed with propriety, for it gives you two ideas for one;—conveys the meaning more luminouſly, and generally with a perception of delight."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He told me, that he had been aſked to undertake the new edition of the <hi>Biographia Britannica,</hi> but had declined it; which he afterwards ſaid to me he regretted. In this regret many will join, becauſe it would have procured us more of Johnſon's moſt delightful ſpecies of writing; and although my friend Dr. Kippis has hitherto diſcharged the taſk judiciouſly, diſtinctly, and with
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0548300102:160" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 more impartiality than might have been expected from a Separatiſt, it were to have been wiſhed that the ſuperintendance of this literary Temple of Fame, had been aſſigned to <q rend="inline">"a friend to the conſtitution in Church and State."</q> We ſhould not then have had it too much crowded with obſcure diſſenting teachers, doubtleſs men of merit and worth, but not quite to be numbered amongſt <q rend="inline">"the moſt eminent perſons who have flouriſhed in Great-Britain and Ireland."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Saturday, September 20, after breakfaſt, when Taylor was gone out to his farm, Dr. Johnſon and I had a ſerious converſation by ourſelves on melancholy and madneſs; which he was, I always thought, erroneouſly inclined to confound together. Melancholy, like <q rend="inline">"great wit,"</q> may be <q rend="inline">"near allied to madneſs;"</q> but there is, in my opinion, a diſtinct ſeparation between them. When he talked of madneſs, he was to be underſtood as ſpeaking of thoſe who were in any great degree diſturbed, or as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly expreſſed, <q rend="inline">"troubled in mind."</q> Some of the ancient philoſophers held, that all deviations from right reaſon were madneſs; and whoever wiſhes to ſee the opinions both of ancients and moderns upon this ſubject, collected and illuſtrated with a variety of curious facts, may read Dr. Arnold's very entertaining work <note n="4" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">"Obſervations on Inſanity,"</q> by Thomas Arnold, M. D. London, 1782.</note>.</p>
               <p>Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"A madman loves to be with people whom he fears; not as a dog fears the laſh; but of whom he ſtands in awe."</q> I was ſtruck with the juſtice of this obſervation. To be with thoſe of whom a perſon, whoſe mind is wavering and dejected, ſtands in awe, repreſſes and compoſes an uneaſy tumult of ſpirits, and conſoles him with the contemplation of ſomething ſteady, and at leaſt comparatively great.</p>
               <p>He added, <q rend="inline">"Madmen are all ſenſual in the lower ſtages of the diſtemper. They are eager for gratifications to ſooth their minds and divert their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the miſery which they ſuffer: but when they grow very ill, pleaſure is too weak for them, and they ſeek for pain <note n="5" place="bottom">We read in the Goſpels, that thoſe unfortunate perſons, who were poſſeſſed with evil ſpirits, (which, after all, I think is the moſt probable cauſe of madneſs, as was firſt ſuggeſted to me by my reſpectable friend Sir John Pringle,) had recourſe to pain, tearing themſelves, and jumping ſometimes into the fire, ſometimes into the water. Mr. Seward has furniſhed me with a remarkable anecdote in confirmation of Dr. Johnſon's obſervation. A tradeſman, who had acquired a large fortune in London, retired from buſineſs, and went to live at Worceſter. His mind, being without its uſual occupation, and having nothing elſe to ſupply its place, preyed upon itſelf, ſo that exiſtence was a torment to him. At laſt he was ſeized with the ſtone; and a friend who found him in one of its ſevereſt fits, having expreſſed his concern, <q rend="inline">"No, no, Sir, (ſaid he,) don't pity me: what I now feel is eaſe, compared with that torture of mind from which it relieves me."</q>
                     </note>. Employment, Sir, and
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0548300102:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>
hardſhips, prevent melancholy. I ſuppoſe in all our army in America there  was not one man who went mad."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We entered ſeriouſly upon a queſtion of much importance to me, which Johnſon was pleaſed to conſider with friendly attention. I had long com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to him that I felt myſelf diſcontented in Scotland, as too narrow a ſphere, and that I wiſhed to make my chief reſidence in London, the great ſcene of ambition, inſtruction, and amuſement; a ſcene, which was to me, comparatively ſpeaking, a heaven upon earth. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I never knew any one who had ſuch a <hi>guſt</hi> for London as you have; and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not blame you for your wiſh to live there: yet, Sir, were I in your father's place, I ſhould not conſent to your ſettling there; for I have the old ſeudal notions, and I ſhould be afraid that Auchinleck would be deſerted, as you would ſoon find it more deſirable to have a country-ſeat in a better climate. I own, however, that to conſider it as a <hi>duty</hi> to reſide on a family eſtate is a prejudice; for we muſt conſider, that working-people get employment equally, and the produce of land is ſold equally, whether a great family reſides at home or not; and if the rents of an eſtate be carried to London, they return again in the circulation of commerce; nay, Sir, we muſt perhaps allow, that carrying the rents to a diſtance is a good, becauſe it contributes to that circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. We muſt, however, allow, that a well-regulated great family may improve a neighbourhood in civility and elegance, and give an example of good order, virtue, and piety; and ſo its reſidence at home may be of much advantage. But if a great family be diſorderly and vicious, its reſidence at home is very pernicious to a neighbourhood. There is not now the ſame inducement to live in the country as formerly; the pleaſures of ſocial life are much better enjoyed in town; and there is no longer in the country that power and influence in proprietors of land which they had in old times, and which made the country ſo agreeable to them. The Laird of Auchinleck now is not near ſo great a man as the Laird of Auchinleck was a hundred years ago."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I told him, that one of my anceſtors never went from home without being attended by thirty men on horſeback. Johnſon's ſhrewdneſs and ſpirit of enquiry were exerted upon every occaſion. <q rend="inline">"Pray (ſaid he,) how did your anceſtor ſupport his thirty men and thirty horſes, when he went at a diſtance
<pb facs="tcp:0548300102:162" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 from home, in an age when there was hardly any money in circulation?"</q> I ſuggeſted the ſame difficulty to a friend, who mentioned Douglas's going to the Holy Land with a numerous train of followers. <q rend="inline">"Douglas could, no doubt, maintain followers enough while living upon his own lands, the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of which ſupplied them with food; but he could not carry that food to the Holy Land; and as there was no commerce by which he could be ſupplied with money, how could he maintain them in foreign countries?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſuggeſted a doubt, that if I were to reſide in London, the exquiſite zeſt with which I reliſhed it in occaſional viſits might go off, and I might grow tired of it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, you find no man, at all intellectual, who is willing to leave London. No, Sir, when a man is tired of London, he is tired of life; for there is in London all that life can afford."</q>
               </p>
               <p>To obviate his apprehenſion, that by ſettling in London I might deſert the ſeat of my anceſtors, I aſſured him, that I had old feudal principles to a degree of enthuſiaſm; and that I felt all the <hi>dulcedo</hi> of the <hi>natale ſolum.</hi> I reminded him, that the Laird of Auchinleck had an elegant houſe, in front of which he could ride ten miles forward upon his own territories, upon which he had upwards of ſix hundred people attached to him; that the family ſeat was rich in natural, romantick beauties of rock, wood, and water; and that in my <q rend="inline">"morn of life"</q> I had appropriated the fineſt deſcriptions, in the ancient Claſſicks to certain ſcenes there, which were thus aſſociated in my mind. That when all this was conſidered, I ſhould certainly paſs a part of the year at home, and enjoy it the more from variety, and from bringing with me a ſhare of the intellectual ſtores of the metropolis. He liſtened to all this, and kindly <q rend="inline">"hoped it might be as I now ſuppoſed."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"A country gentleman ſhould bring his lady to viſit London as ſoon as he can, that they may have agreeable topicks for converſation when they are by themſelves."</q>
               </p>
               <p>As I meditated trying my fortune in Weſtminſter Hall, our converſation turned upon the profeſſion of the law in England. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You muſt not indulge too ſanguine hopes, ſhould you be called to our bar. I was told, by a very ſenſible lawyer, that there are a great many chances againſt any man's ſucceſs in the profeſſion of the law; the candidates are ſo numerous, and thoſe who get large practice ſo few. He ſaid, it was by no means true that a man of good parts and application is ſure of having buſineſs, though, he, indeed, allowed that if ſuch a man could but appear in a few cauſes, his merit would be known, and he would get forward; but that the great riſk
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0548300102:163" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was, that a man might paſs half a life-time in the Courts, and never have an  opportunity of ſhewing his abilities."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of employment being abſolutely neceſſary to preſerve the mind from wearying and growing fretful, eſpecially in thoſe who have a tendency to melancholy; and I mentioned to him a ſaying which ſomebody had related of an American ſavage, who when an European was expatiating on all the advantages of money, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> this queſtion: <q rend="inline">"Will it purchaſe <hi>occupation?</hi>"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Depend upon it, Sir, this ſaying is too refined for a ſavage. And, Sir, money <hi>will</hi> purchaſe occupation; it will purchaſe all the conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies of life; it will purchaſe variety of company; it will purchaſe all ſorts of entertainment."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I talked to him of Forſter's <q rend="inline">"Voyage to the South Seas,"</q> which pleaſed me; but I found he did not like it. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) there is a great affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of fine writing in it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But he carries you along with him."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; he does not carry <hi>me</hi> along with him: he leaves me behind him: or rather, indeed, he ſets me before him; for he makes me turn over many leaves at a time."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Sunday, September 12, we went to the church of Aſhbourne, which is one of the largeſt and moſt luminous that I have ſeen in any town of the ſame ſize. I felt great ſatisfaction in conſidering that I was ſupported in my fondneſs of ſolemn publick worſhip by the general concurrence and munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of mankind.</p>
               <p>Johnſon and Taylor were ſo different from each other, that I wondered at their preſerving ſuch an intimacy. Their having been at ſchool and college together, might, in ſome degree, account for this; but Sir Joſhua Reynolds has furniſhed me with a ſtronger reaſon; for Johnſon mentioned to him, that he had been told by Taylor he was to be his heir. I ſhall not take upon me to animadvert upon this; but certain it is, that Johnſon paid great attention to Taylor. He now, however, ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I love him, but I do not love him more; my regard for him does not increaſe. As it is ſaid in the Apocrypha, 'his talk is of bullocks <note n="6" place="bottom">Eccleſiaſticus, chap. xxxviii. v. 25. The whole chapter may be read as an admirable illuſtration of the ſuperiority of cultivated minds over the groſs and illiterate.</note>:' I do not ſuppoſe he is very fond of my company. His habits are by no means ſufficiently clerical: this he knows that I ſee; and no man likes to live under the eye of perpetual diſapprobation."</q>

               <p>I have no doubt that a good many ſermons were compoſed for Taylor by Johnſon. At this time I found, upon his table, a part of one which he had
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0548300102:164" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 newly begun to write; and <hi>Concio pro Tayloro</hi> appears in one of his diaries. When to theſe circumſtances we add the internal evidence from the power of thinking and ſtyle, in the collection which the Reverend Mr. Hayes has publiſhed, with the <hi>ſignificant</hi> title of <q rend="inline">"Sermons <hi>left for publication</hi> by the Reverend John Taylor, LL. D."</q> our conviction will be complete.</p>
               <p>I, however, would not have it thought, that Dr Taylor, though he could not write like Johnſon, (as, indeed, who could?<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d not ſometimes compoſe ſermons as good as thoſe which we generally have from very reſpectable divines. He ſhewed me one with notes on the margin in Johnſon's hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>writing; and I was preſent when he read another to Johnſon, that he might have his opinion of it, and Johnſon ſaid it was <q rend="inline">"very well."</q> Theſe, we may be ſure, were not Johnſon's; for he was above little arts, or tricks of deception.</p>
               <p>Johnſon was by no means of opinion, that every man of a learned profeſſion ſhould conſider it as incumbent upon him, or as neceſſary to his credit, to appear as an authour. When in the ardour of ambition for literary fame, I regretted to him one day that an eminent Judge had nothing of it, and therefore would leave no perpetual monument of himſelf to poſterity. <q rend="inline">"Alas, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) what a maſs of confuſion ſhould we have if every Biſhop and every Judge, every Lawyer, Phyſician, and Divine, were to write books."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned to Johnſon a reſpectable perſon of a very ſtrong mind, who had little of that tenderneſs which is common to human nature; as an inſtance of which, when I ſuggeſted to him that he ſhould invite his ſon, who had been ſettled ten years in foreign parts, to come home and pay him a viſit, his anſwer was, <q rend="inline">"No, no, let him mind his buſineſs."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I do not agree with him, Sir, in this. Getting money is not all a man's buſineſs: to culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate kindneſs is a valuable part of the buſineſs of life."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the evening, Johnſon being in very good ſpirits, entertained us with ſeveral characteriſtical portraits. I regret that any of them eſcaped my retention and diligence. I found, from experience, that to collect my friend's converſation ſo as to exhibit it with any degree of its original flavour, it was neceſſary to write it down without delay. To record his ſayings, after ſome diſtance of time, was like preſerving or pickling long-kept and faded fruits or other vegetables, which, when in that ſtate, have little or nothing of their taſte when freſh.</p>
               <p>I ſhall preſent my readers with a ſeries of what I gathered this evening from the Johnſonian garden.</p>

                  <q>"My friend, the late Earl of Corke, had a great deſire to maintain the  literary character of his family: he was a genteel man, but did not keep up the dignity of his rank. He was ſo generally civil, that nobody thanked him for it."</q>

               <p>
                  <q>"Did we not hear ſo much ſaid of Jack Wilkes, we ſhould think more highly of his converſation. Jack has great variety of talk, Jack is a ſcholar, and Jack has the manners of a gentleman. But after hearing his name ſounded from pole to pole, as the phoenix of convivial felicity, we are diſappointed in his company. He has always been <hi>at me:</hi> but I would do Jack a kindneſs, rather than not. The conteſt is now over."</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"Colley Cibber once conſulted me as to one of his birth-day Odes, a long time before it was wanted. I objected very freely to ſeveral paſſages. Cibber loſt patience, and would not read his Ode to an end. When we had done with criticiſm, we walked over to Richardſon's, the authour of 'Clariſſa,' and I wondered to find Richardſon diſpleaſed that I 'did not treat Cibber with more <hi>reſpect.'</hi> Now, Sir, to talk of <hi>reſpect</hi> for a <hi>player!</hi>"</q> (ſmiling diſdainfully). BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"There, Sir, you are always heretical: you never will allow merit to a player."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Merit, Sir! what merit? Do you reſpect a rope-dancer, or a ballad-ſinger<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir: but we reſpect a great player, as a man who can conceive lofty ſentiments, and can expreſs them gracefully."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"What, Sir, a fellow who claps a hump on his back, and a lump on his leg, and cries, <hi>'I am Richard the Third?'</hi> Nay, Sir, a ballad-ſinger is a higher man, for he does two things; he repeats and he ſings: there is both recitation and muſick in his performance: the player only recites."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"My dear Sir! you may turn any thing into ridicule. I allow, that a player of farce is not entitled to reſpect; he does a little thing: but he who can repreſent exalted characters, and touch the nobleſt paſſions, has very reſpectable powers: and mankind have agreed in admiring great talents for the ſtage. We muſt conſider, too, that a great player does what very few are capable to do: his art is a very rare faculty. <hi>Who</hi> can repeat Hamlet's Soliloquy, 'To be, or not to be,' as Garrick does it?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Any body may. Jemmy, there (a boy about eight years old, who was in the room) will do it as well in a week."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"No, no, Sir: and as a proof of the merit of great acting, and of the value which mankind ſet upon it, Garrick has got a hundred thouſand pounds."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Is getting a hundred thouſand pounds a proof of excellence? That has been done by a ſcoundrel commiſſary."</q>

 This was moſt fallacious reaſoning. I was <hi>ſure,</hi> for once, that I had the beſt ſide of the argument. I boldly maintained the juſt diſtinction between a tragedian and a mere theatrical droll; between thoſe who rouſe our terrour and pity, and thoſe who only make us laugh. <q rend="inline">"If (ſaid I) Betterton and Foote were to walk into this room, you would reſpect Betterton much more than Foote."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"If Betterton were to walk into this room with Foote, Foote would ſoon drive him out of it. Foote, Sir, <hi>quatenùs</hi> Foote, has powers ſuperiour to them all."</q>

               <p>On Monday, September 22, when at breakfaſt, I unguardedly ſaid to Dr. Johnſon, <q rend="inline">"I wiſh I ſaw you and Mrs. Macaulay together."</q> He grew very angry; and, after a pauſe, while a cloud gathered on his brow, he burſt out, <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; you would not ſee us quarrel, to make you ſport. Don't you know that it is very uncivil to <hi>pit</hi> two people againſt one another?"</q> Then, checking himſelf, and wiſhing to be more gentle, he added, <q rend="inline">"I do not ſay you ſhould be hanged or drowned for this; but it <hi>is</hi> very uncivil."</q> Dr. Taylor thought him in the wrong, and ſpoke to him privately of it; but I afterwards acknowledged to Johnſon that I was to blame, for I candidly owned, that I meant to expreſs a deſire to ſee a conteſt between Mrs. Macaulay and him; but then I knew how the conteſt would end; ſo that I was to ſee him triumph. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you cannot be ſure how a conteſt will end; and no man has a right to engage two people in a diſpute by which their paſſions may be inflamed, and they may part with bitter reſentment againſt each other. I would ſooner keep company with a man from whom I muſt guard my pockets, than with a man who contrives to bring me into a diſpute with ſomebody that he may hear it. This is the great fault of—, (naming one of our friends) endeavouring to introduce a ſubject upon which he knows two people in the company differ."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But he told me, Sir, he does it for inſtruction."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Whatever the motive be, Sir, the man who does ſo, does very wrong. He has no more right to inſtruct himſelf at ſuch a riſk, than he has to make two people fight a duel, that he may learn how to defend himſelf."</q>

               <p>He found great fault with a gentleman of our acquaintance for keeping a bad table. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) when a man is invited to dinner, he is diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed if he does not get ſomething good. I adviſed Mrs. Thrale, who has no card-parties at her houſe, to give ſweet-meats, and ſuch good things, in an evening, as are not commonly given, and ſhe would find company enough come to her; for every body loves to have things which pleaſe the palate put in their way, without trouble or preparation."</q> Such was his attention to the <hi>minutiae</hi> of life and manners.</p>

He thus characteriſed the Duke of Devonſhire, grandfather of the preſent  repreſentative of that very reſpectable family: <q rend="inline">"He was not a man of ſuperiour abilities, but he was a man ſtrictly faithful to his word. If, for inſtance, he had promiſed you an acron, and none had grown that year in his woods, he would not have contented himſelf with that excuſe; he would have ſent to Denmark for it. So unconditional was he in keeping his word; ſo high as to the point of honour."</q> This was a liberal teſtimony from the Tory Johnſon to the virtue of a great Whig nobleman.</p>
               <p>Mr. Burke's <q rend="inline">"Letter to the Sheriffs of Briſtol, on the affairs of America,"</q> being mentioned, Johnſon cenſured the compoſition much, and he ridiculed the definition of a free government, <hi>viz.</hi> 
                  <q rend="inline">"For any practical purpoſe, it is what the people think ſo <note n="7" place="bottom">Edit. 2, p. 53.</note>."</q>—<q rend="inline">"I will let the King of France govern me on thoſe conditions, (ſaid he,) for it is to be governed juſt as I pleaſe."</q> And when Dr. Taylor talked of a girl being ſent to a pariſh workhouſe, and aſked how much ſhe could be obliged to work. <q rend="inline">"Why, (ſaid Johnſon,) as much as is reaſonable: and what is that? as much as <hi>ſhe thinks</hi> reaſonable."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon obligingly propoſed to carry me to ſee Iſlam, a romantick ſcene, now belonging to a family of the name of Port, but formerly the ſeat of the Congreves. I ſuppoſe it is well deſcribed in ſome of the Tours. Johnſon deſcribed it diſtinctly and vividly, at which I could not but expreſs to him my wonder; becauſe, though my eyes, as he obſerved, were better than his, I could not by any means equal him in repreſenting viſible objects. I ſaid, the difference between us in this reſpect was as that between a man who has a bad inſtrument, but plays well on it, and a man who has a good inſtrument, on which he can play very imperfectly.</p>
               <p>I recollect a very fine amphitheatre, ſurrounded with hills covered with wood, and walks neatly formed along the ſide of a rocky ſteep, on the quarter next the houſe, with receſſes under projections of rock, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed with trees; in one of which receſſes, we were told, Congreve wrote his <q rend="inline">"Old Bachelor."</q> We viewed a remarkable natural curioſity at Iſlam; two rivers burſting near each other from the rock, not from immediate ſprings, but after having run for many miles under ground. Plott, in his <q rend="inline">"Hiſtory of Staffordſhire <note n="8" place="bottom">Page 89.</note>"</q>, gives an account of this curioſity; but Johnſon would not believe it, though we had the atteſtation of the gardener, who ſaid, he had put in corks, where the river <hi>Manyfold</hi> ſinks into the ground, and had eatched them in a net, placed before one of the openings where the water
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0548300102:168" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 burſts out. Indeed, ſuch ſubterraneous courſes of water are found in various parts of our globe <note n="9" place="bottom">See Plott's <q rend="inline">"Hiſtory of Staffordſhire,"</q> p. 88, and the authorities referred to by him.</note>.</p>
               <p>Talking of Dr. Johnſon's unwillingneſs to believe extraordinary things, I ventured to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Sir, you come near Hume's argument againſt miracles, 'That it is more probable witneſſes ſhould lie, or be miſtaken, than that they ſhould happen."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, Hume, taking the propoſition ſimply, is right. But the Chriſtian revelation is not proved by the miracles alone, but as connected with prophecies, and with the doctrines in confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which the miracles were wrought."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He repeated his obſervation, that the difference among Chriſtians are really of no conſequence. <q rend="inline">"For inſtance, (ſaid he,) if a Proteſtant objects to a Papiſt, 'You worſhip images;' the Papiſt can anſwer, 'I do not inſiſt on <hi>your</hi> doing it; you may be a very good Papiſt without it: I do it only as a help to my devotion."</q> I ſaid, the great article of Chriſtianity is the revelation of immortality. Johnſon admitted it was.</p>
               <p>In the evening, a gentleman-farmer, who was on a viſit at Dr. Taylor's, attempted to diſpute with Johnſon in favour of Mungo Campbell, who ſhot Alexander, Earl of Eglintoune, upon his having fallen, when retreating from his Lordſhip, who he believed was about to ſeize his gun, as he had threatened to do. He ſaid, he ſhould have done juſt as Campbell did. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Whoever would do as Campbell did, deſerves to be hanged; not that I could, as a juryman, have found him legally guilty of murder; but I am glad they found means to convict him."</q> The gentleman-farmer ſaid, <q rend="inline">"A poor man has as much honour as a rich man; and Campbell had <hi>that</hi> to defend."</q> Johnſon exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"A poor man has no honour."</q> The Engliſh yeoman, not diſmayed, proceeded: <q rend="inline">"Lord Eglintoune was a damned fool to run on upon Campbell, after being warned that Campbell would ſhoot him if he did."</q> Johnſon, who could not bear any thing like ſwearing, angrily replied, <q rend="inline">"He was <hi>not a damned</hi> fool: he only thought too well of Campbell. He did not believe Campbell would be ſuch a <hi>damned</hi> ſcoundrel, as to do ſo <hi>damned</hi> a thing."</q> His emphaſis on <hi>damned,</hi> accompanied with frowning looks, reproved his opponent's want of decorum in <hi>his</hi> preſence.</p>
               <p>Talking of the danger of being mortified by rejection, when making approaches to the acquaintance of the great, I obſerved, <q rend="inline">"I am, however, generally for trying, 'Nothing venture, nothing have."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Very true, Sir; but I have always been more afraid of failing, than hopeful of
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0548300102:169" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſucceſs."</q> And, indeed, though he had all juſt reſpect for rank, no man  ever leſs courted the favour of the great.</p>
               <p>During this interview at Aſhbourne, Johnſon ſeemed to be more uniformly ſocial, cheerful, and alert, than I had almoſt ever ſeen him. He was prompt on great occaſions and on ſmall. Taylor, who praiſed every thing of his own to exceſs, in ſhort, <q rend="inline">"whoſe geeſe were all ſwans,"</q> as the proverb ſays, expatiated on the excellence of his bull-dog, which he told us was <q rend="inline">"perfectly well ſhaped."</q> Johnſon, after examining the animal attentively, thus repreſſed the vain-glory of our hoſt:—<q rend="inline">"No, Sir, he is <hi>not</hi> well ſhaped; for there is not the quick tranſition from the thickneſs of the fore-part to the <hi>tenuity</hi>—the thin part—behind, which a bull-dog ought to have."</q> This <hi>tenuity,</hi> was the only <hi>hard word</hi> that I heard him uſe during this interview, and it will be obſerved, he inſtantly put another expreſſion in its place. Taylor ſaid, a ſmall bull-dog was as good as a large one. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; for, in proportion to his ſize, he has ſtrength: and your argument would prove, that a good bull-dog may be as ſmall as a mouſe."</q> It was amazing how he entered with perſpicuity and keenneſs upon every thing that occurred in converſation. Moſt men, whom I know, would no more think of diſcuſſing a queſtion about a bull-dog, than of attacking a bull.</p>
               <p>I cannot allow any fragment whatever that floats in my memory concerning the great ſubject of this work to be loſt. Though a ſmall particular may appear trifling to ſome, it will be reliſhed by others; while every little ſpark adds ſomething to the general blaze: and to pleaſe the true, candid, warm admirers of Johnſon, and in any degree increaſe the ſplendour of his reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I bid defiance to the ſhafts of ridicule, or even of malignity. Showers of them have been diſcharged at my <q rend="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides;"</q> yet it ſtill ſails unhurt along the ſtream of time, and, as an attendant upon Johnſon,

               <p>One morning after breakfaſt, when the ſun ſhone bright, we walked out together, and <q rend="inline">"pored"</q> for ſome time with placid indolence upon an artificial water-fall, which Dr. Taylor had made by building a ſtrong dyke of ſtone acroſs the river behind his garden. It was now ſomewhat obſtructed by branches of trees and other rubbiſh, which had come down the river and ſettled cloſe to it. Johnſon, partly from a deſire to ſee it play more freely, and partly from that inclination to activity which will animate, at times, the moſt inert and ſluggiſh mortal, took a long pole which was lying on the bank, and puſhed down ſeveral parcels of this wreck with painful aſſiduity, while I ſtood quietly by, wondering to behold the ſage thus curiouſly employed, and ſmiling with an
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0548300102:170" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 humorous ſatisfaction each time when he carried his point. He worked till he was quite out of breath; and having found a large dead cat ſo heavy that he could not move it after ſeveral efforts, <q rend="inline">"Come, (ſaid he, throwing down the pole,) <hi>you</hi> ſhall take it now;"</q> which I accordingly did, and being a freſh man, ſoon made the cat tumble over the caſcade. This may be laughed at as too trifling to record; but it is a ſmall characteriſtick trait in the Flemiſh picture which I give of my friend, and in which, therefore, I mark the moſt minute particulars. And let it be remembered, that <q rend="inline">"Aeſop at play"</q> is one of the inſtructive apologues of antiquity.</p>
               <p>I mentioned an old gentleman of our acquaintance whoſe memory was beginning to fail.—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"There muſt be a diſeaſed mind, where there is a failure of memory at ſeventy. A man's head, Sir, muſt be morbid if he fails ſo ſoon."</q> My friend, being now himſelf ſixty-eight, might think thus: but I imagine, that <hi>threeſcore and ten,</hi> the Pſalmiſt's period of ſound human life, in later ages may have a failure, though there be no diſeaſe in the conſtitution.</p>
               <p>Talking of Rocheſter's Poems, he ſaid, he had given them to Mr. Steevens to caſtrate for the edition of the Poets, to which he was to write Prefaces. Dr. Taylor (the only time I ever heard him ſay any thing witty <note n="1" place="bottom">I am told, that the Honourable Horace Walpole has a collection of <hi>Bon Mots</hi> by perſons who never ſaid but one.</note>) ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that <q rend="inline">"if Rocheſter had been caſtrated himſelf, his exceptionable poems would not have been written."</q> I aſked if Burnet had not given a good Life of Rocheſter. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"We have a good <hi>Death:</hi> there is not much <hi>Life.</hi>"</q> I aſked whether Prior's Poems were to be printed entire: Johnſon ſaid they were. I mentioned Lord Hailes's cenſure of Prior, in his Preface to a collection of <q rend="inline">"Sacred Poems,"</q> by various hands, publiſhed by him at Edinburgh a great many years ago, where he mentions, <q rend="inline">"thoſe impure tales which will be the eternal opprobrium of their ingenious authour."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, Lord Hailes has forgot. There is nothing in Prior that will excite to lewdneſs. If Lord Hailes thinks there is, he muſt be more combuſtible than other people."</q> I inſtanced the tale of <q rend="inline">"Paulo Purgant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and his Wife."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, there is nothing there, but that his wife wanted to be kiſſed, when poor Paulo was out of pocket. No, Sir, Prior is a lady's book. No lady is aſhamed to have it ſtanding in her library."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The hypochondriack diſorder being mentioned, Dr. Johnſon did not think it ſo common as I ſuppoſed.—<q rend="inline">"Dr. Taylor (ſaid he) is the ſame one day as another. Burke and Reynolds are the ſame. Beauclerk, except when in pain, is the ſame. I am not ſo myſelf; but this I do not mention commonly."</q>

I complained of a wretched changefulneſs, ſo that I could not preſerve, for  any long continuance, the ſame views of any thing. It was moſt comfortable to me to experience, in Dr. Johnſon's company, a relief from this uneaſineſs. His ſteady vigorous mind held firm before me thoſe objects which my own feeble and tremulous imagination frequently preſented, in ſuch a wavering ſtate, that my reaſon could not judge well of them.</p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon adviſed me to-day, to have as many books about me as I could; that I might read upon any ſubject upon which I had a deſire for inſtruction at the time. <q rend="inline">"What you read <hi>then</hi> (ſaid he) you will remember; but if you have not a book immediately ready, and the ſubject moulds in your mind, it is a chance if you again have a deſire to ſtudy it."</q> He added, <q rend="inline">"If a man never has an eager deſire for inſtruction, he ſhould preſcribe a taſk for himſelf. But it is better when a man reads from im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate inclination."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He repeated a good many lines of Horace's Odes, while we were in the chaiſe. I remember particularly the Ode <q rend="inline">"Eheu fugaces."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, the diſpute as to the comparative excellence of Homer or Virgil<note n="2" place="bottom">I am informed by Mr. Langton, that a great many years ago he was preſent when this queſtion was agitated between Dr. Johnſon and Mr. Burke; and, to uſe Johnſon's phraſe, they <q rend="inline">"talked their beſt;"</q> Johnſon for Homer, Burke for Virgil. It may well be ſuppoſed to have been one of the ableſt and moſt brilliant conteſts that ever was exhibited. How much muſt we regret that it has not been preſerved.</note> was inaccurate. <q rend="inline">"We muſt conſider (ſaid he) whether Homer was not the greateſt poet, though Virgil may have produced the fineſt poem.

               </p>
               <p>He told me, that Bacon was a favourite authour with him; but he had never read his works till he was compiling the Engliſh Dictionary, in which, he ſaid, I might ſee Bacon very often quoted. Mr. Seward recollects his having mentioned, that a Dictionary of the Engliſh language might be compiled from Bacon's writings alone, and that he had once an intention of giving an edition of Bacon, at leaſt of his Engliſh works, and writing the Life of that great man. Had he executed this intention, there can be no doubt that he would have done it in a moſt maſterly manner. Mallet's Life of Bacon has no inconſiderable merit as an acute and elegant diſſertation relative to its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; but Mallet's mind was not comprehenſive enough to embrace the vaſt extent of Lord Verulam's genius and reſearch. Dr. Warburton therefore
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0548300102:172" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 obſerved, with witty juſtneſs, <q rend="inline">"that Mallet in his Life of Bacon had forgotten that he was a philoſopher; and if he ſhould write the Life of the Duke of Marlborough, which he had undertaken to do, he would probably forget that he was a General."</q>

               <p>Wiſhing to be ſatisfied what degree of truth there was in a ſtory which a friend of Johnſon's and mine had told me to his diſadvantage, I mentioned it to him in direct terms; and it was to this effect: that a gentleman who had lived in great intimacy with him, ſhewn him much kindneſs, and even relieved him from a ſpunging-houſe, having afterwards fallen into bad circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, was one day, when Johnſon was at dinner with him, ſeized for debt, and carried to priſon; that Johnſon ſat ſtill undiſturbed, and went on eating and drinking; upon which the gentleman's ſiſter, who was preſent, could not ſuppreſs her indignation: <q rend="inline">"What, Sir, (ſaid ſhe,) are you ſo unfeeling, as not even to offer to go to my brother in his diſtreſs; you who have been ſo much obliged to him?"</q> And that Johnſon anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Madam, I owe him no obligation; what he did for me he would have done for a dog."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon aſſured me, that the ſtory was abſolutely falſe; but like a man conſcious of being in the right, and deſirous of completely vindicating him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from ſuch a charge, he did not arrogantly reſt on a mere denial, and on his general character, but proceeded thus:—<q rend="inline">"Sir, I was very intimate with that gentleman, and was once relieved by him from an arreſt; but I never was preſent when he was arreſted, never knew that he was arreſted, and I believe he never was in difficulties after the time when he relieved me. I loved him much; yet, in talking of his general character, I may have ſaid, though I do not remember that I ever did ſo, that as his generoſity proceeded from no principle, but was a part of his profuſion, he would do for a dog what he would do for a friend: but I never applied this remark to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular inſtance, and certainly not to his kindneſs to me. If a profuſe man, who does not value his money, and gives a large ſum to a whore, gives half as much, or an equally large ſum to relieve a friend, it cannot be eſteemed as virtue. This was all that I could ſay of that gentleman; and, if ſaid at all, it muſt have been ſaid after his death. Sir, I would have gone to the world's end to relieve him. The remark about the dog, if made by me, was ſuch a ſally as might eſcape one when painting a man highly."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Tueſday, September 23, Johnſon was remarkably cordial to me. It being neceſſary for me to return to Scotland ſoon, I had fixed on the next day for my ſetting out, and I felt a tender concern at the thought of parting
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0548300102:173" rendition="simple:additions"/>
with him. He had, at this time, frankly communicated to me many parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars,  which are inſerted in this work in their proper places; and once, when I happened to mention that the expence of my jaunt would come to much more than I had computed, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, if the expence were to be an inconvenience, you would have reaſon to regret it: but, if you have had the money to ſpend, I know not that you could have purchaſed as much pleaſure with it in any other way."</q>
               </p>
               <p>During this interview at Aſhbourne, Johnſon and I frequently talked with wonderful pleaſure of mere trifles which had occurred in our tour to the Hebrides; for it had left a moſt agreeable and laſting impreſſion upon his mind.</p>
               <p>He found fault with me for uſing the phraſe to <hi>make</hi> money. <q rend="inline">"Don't you ſee (ſaid he) the impropriety of it? To <hi>make</hi> money is to <hi>coin</hi> it: you ſhould ſay <hi>get</hi> money."</q> The phraſe, however, is, I think, pretty current. But Johnſon was at all times jealous of infractions upon the genuine Engliſh language, and prompt to repreſs colloquial barbariſms; ſuch as, <hi>pledging myſelf,</hi> for <hi>undertaking; line,</hi> for <hi>department</hi> or <hi>branch,</hi> as, the <hi>civil line,</hi> the <hi>banking line.</hi> He was particularly indignant againſt the almoſt univerſal uſe of the word <hi>idea</hi> in the ſenſe of <hi>notion</hi> or <hi>opinion,</hi> when it is clear that <hi>idea</hi> can only ſignify ſomething of which an image can be formed in the mind. We may have an <hi>idea</hi> or <hi>image</hi> of a mountain, a tree, a building; but we cannot ſurely have an <hi>idea</hi> or <hi>image</hi> of an <hi>argument</hi> or <hi>propoſition.</hi> Yet we hear the ſages of the law <q rend="inline">"delivering their <hi>ideas</hi> upon the queſtion under conſideration;"</q> and the firſt ſpeakers in parliament <q rend="inline">"entirely coinciding in the <hi>idea</hi> which has been ably ſtated by an honourable member;"</q>—or <q rend="inline">"reprobating an <hi>idea</hi> uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional and fraught with the moſt dangerous conſequences to a great and free country."</q> Johnſon called this <q rend="inline">"modern cant."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I perceived that he pronounced the word <hi>heard,</hi> as if ſpelt with a double <hi>e, heerd,</hi> inſtead of ſounding it <hi>herd,</hi> as is moſt uſually done. He ſaid, his reaſon was, that if it were pronounced <hi>herd,</hi> there would be a ſingle exception from the Engliſh pronunciation of the ſyllable <hi>ear,</hi> and he thought it better not to have that exception.</p>
               <p>He praiſed Granger's <q rend="inline">"Ode on Solitude,"</q> in Dodſley's collection, and repeated, with great energy, the exordium:</p>
               <q>

               <p>obſerving, <q rend="inline">"This, Sir, is very noble."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the evening our gentleman-farmer, and two others, entertained them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the company with a great number of tunes on the fiddle. Johnſon deſired to have <q rend="inline">"Let ambition fire thy mind,"</q> played over again, and appeared to give a patient attention to it; though he owned to me that he was very inſenſible to the power of muſick. I told him, that it affected me to ſuch a degree, as often to agitate my nerves painfully, producing in my mind alternate ſenſations of pathetick dejection, ſo that I was ready to ſhed tears; and of daring reſolution, ſo that I was inclined to ruſh into the thickeſt part of a battle. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) I ſhould never hear it, if it made me ſuch a fool."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Much of the effect of muſick, I am ſatisfied, is owing to aſſociation of ideas. That air, which inſtantly and irreſiſtibly excites in the Swiſs, when in a foreign land, the <hi>maladie du pais,</hi> has, I am told, no intrinſick power of ſound. And I know from my own experience, that Scotch reels, though briſk, make me melancholy, becauſe I uſed to hear them in my early years, at a time when Mr. Pitt called for ſoldiers <q rend="inline">"from the mountains of the north,"</q> and numbers of brave Highlanders were going abroad, never to return. Whereas the airs in <q rend="inline">"The Beggar's Opera,"</q> many of which are very ſoft, never fail to render me gay, becauſe they are aſſociated with the warm ſenſations and high ſpirits of London. This evening, while ſome of the tunes of ordinary compoſition were played with no great ſkill, my frame was agitated, and I was conſcious of a generous attachment to Dr. Johnſon, as my preceptor and friend, mixed with an affectionate regret that he was an old man, whom I ſhould probably loſe in a ſhort time. I thought I could defend him at the point of my ſword. My reverence and affection for him were in full glow. I ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"My dear Sir, we muſt meet every year, if you don't quarrel with me."</q> JOHNSON <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, you are more likely to quarrel with me, than I with you. My regard for you is greater almoſt than I have words to expreſs; but I do not chooſe to be always repeating it,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0548300102:175" rendition="simple:additions"/>
write it down in the firſt leaf of your pocket-book, and never doubt of it  again."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I talked to him of miſery being <q rend="inline">"the doom of man,"</q> in this life, as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in his <q rend="inline">"Vanity of Human Wiſhes."</q> Yet I obſerved that things were done upon the ſuppoſition of happineſs; grand houſes were built, fine gardens were made, ſplendid places of publick amuſement were contrived, and crowded with company. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Alas, Sir, theſe are all only ſtruggles for happineſs. When I firſt entered Ranelagh, it gave an expanſion and gay ſenſation to my mind, ſuch as I never experienced any where elſe. But, as Xerxes wept when he viewed his immenſe army, and conſidered that not one of that great multitude would be alive a hundred years afterwards, ſo it went to my heart to conſider that there was not one in all that brilliant circle, that was not afraid to go home and think; but that the thoughts of each individual there, would be diſtreſſing when alone."</q> This reflection was experimentally juſt. The feeling of languor <note n="3" place="bottom">Pope mentions,
<q>
                        <l>"Stretch'd on the rack of a too eaſy chair,"</l>
                     </q>
But I recollect a couplet quite appoſite to my ſubject in <q rend="inline">"Virtue, an Ethick Epiſtle,"</q> a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful and inſtructive poem, by an anonymous writer, in 1758; who, treating of pleaſure in exceſs, ſays,
<q>
                        <l>"Till languor, ſuffering on the rack of bliſs,</l>
                        <l>"Confeſs that man was never made for this."</l>
                     </q>
                  </note>, which ſucceeds the animation of gaiety, is itſelf a very ſevere pain; and when the mind is then vacant, a thouſand diſappointments and vexations ruſh in and excruciate. Will not many even of my faireſt readers allow this to be true?</p>
               <p>I ſuggeſted, that being in love, and flattered with hopes of ſucceſs; or having ſome favourite ſcheme in view for the next day, might prevent that wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of which we had been talking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, it may ſometimes be ſo as you ſuppoſe; but my concluſion is in general but too true."</q>
               </p>
               <p>While Johnſon and I ſtood in calm conference by ourſelves in Dr. Taylor's garden, at a pretty late hour, in a ſerene autumn night, looking up to the heavens, I directed the diſcourſe to the ſubject of a future ſtate. My friend was in a placid and moſt benignant frame. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) I do not imagine that all things will be made clear to us immediately after death, but that the ways of Providence will be explained to us very gradually."</q> I ventured to aſk him whether although the words of ſome texts of Scripture ſeemed ſtrong in ſupport of the dreadful doctrine of an eternity of puniſhment, we might not hope that the denunciation was figurative, and would not literally be executed.
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0548300102:176" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you are to conſider the intention of puniſhment in a future ſtate. We have no reaſon to be ſure that we ſhall then be no longer liable to offend againſt GOD. We do not know that even the angels are quite in a ſtate of ſecurity; nay we know that ſome of them have fallen. It may, therefore, perhaps be neceſſary, in order to preſerve both men and angels in a ſtate of rectitude, that they ſhould have continually before them the puniſhment of thoſe who have deviated from it; but we may hope that by ſome other means a fall from rectitude may be prevented. Some of the texts of Scripture upon this ſubject are, as you obſerve, indeed ſtrong; but they may admit of a mitigated interpretation."</q> He talked to me upon this aweful and delicate queſtion in a gentle tone, and as if afraid to be deciſive.</p>
               <p>After ſupper I accompanied him to his apartment, and at my requeſt he dictated to me an argument in favour of the negro who was then claiming his liberty, in an action in the Court of Seſſion in Scotland <note n="4" place="bottom">This being laid up ſomewhere amidſt my multiplicity of papers at Auchinleck, has eſcaped my ſearch for this work; but, when ſound, I ſhall take care that my readers ſhall have it.</note>. He had always been very zealous againſt ſlavery in every form, in which I with all deference thought that he diſcovered <q rend="inline">"a zeal without knowledge."</q> Upon one occaſion, when in company with ſome very grave men at Oxford, his toaſt was, <q rend="inline">"Here's to the next inſurrection of the negroes in the Weſt-Indies."</q> His violent prejudice againſt our Weſt-Indian and American ſettlers appeared whenever there was an opportunity. Towards the concluſion of his <q rend="inline">"Taxation no Tyranny,"</q> he ſays, <q rend="inline">"how is it that we hear the loudeſt <hi>yelps</hi> for liberty among the drivers of negroes?"</q> and in his converſation with Mr. Wilkes <note n="5" place="bottom">See page 88 of this volume.</note>, he aſked, <q rend="inline">"Where did Beckford and Trecothick learn Engliſh?"</q> That Trecothick could both ſpeak and write good Engliſh is well known. I myſelf was favoured with his correſpondence concerning the brave Corſicans. And that Beckford could ſpeak it with a ſpirit of honeſt reſolution even to his Majeſty, as his <q rend="inline">"faithful Lord-Mayor of London,"</q> is commemorated by the noble monument erected to him in Guildhall.</p>
               <p>When I ſaid now to Johnſon, that I was afraid I kept him too late up. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, (ſaid he,) I don't care though I ſit all night with you."</q> This was an animated ſpeech from a man in his ſixty-ninth year.</p>
               <p>Had I been as attentive not to diſpleaſe him as I ought to have been, I know not but this vigil might have been fulfilled; but I unluckily entered
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0548300102:177" rendition="simple:additions"/>
upon the controverſy concerning the right of Great-Britain to tax America,  and attempted to argue in favour of our fellow-ſubjects on the other ſide of the Atlantick. I inſiſted that America might be very well governed, and made to yield a ſufficient revenue by the means of <hi>influence,</hi> as exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plified in Ireland, while the people might be pleaſed with the imagination of their participating of the Britiſh conſtitution, by having a body of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives without whoſe conſent money could not be exacted from them. Johnſon could not bear my thus oppoſing his avowed opinion, which he had exerted himſelf with an extreme degree of heat to enforce; and the violent agitation into which he was thrown while anſwering, or rather reprimanding me, alarmed me ſo that I heartily repented of my having unthinkingly introduced the ſubject. I myſelf however grew warm, and the change was great, from the calm ſtate of philoſophical diſcuſſion in which we had a little before been pleaſingly employed.</p>
               <p>I talked of the corruption of the Britiſh parliament, in which I alledged that any queſtion, however unreaſonable or unjuſt, might be carried by a venal majority, and I ſpoke with high admiration of the Roman Senate, as if compoſed of men ſincerely deſirous to reſolve what they ſhould think beſt for their country. My friend would allow no ſuch character to the Roman Senate; and he maintained that the Britiſh parliament was not corrupt, and that there was no occaſion to corrupt its members, aſſerting, that there was hardly ever any queſtion of great importance before parliament, any queſtion in which a man might not very well vote either upon one ſide or the other. He ſaid there had been none in his time except that reſpecting America.</p>
               <p>We were fatigued by the conteſt, which was produced by my want of caution; and he was not then in the humour to ſlide into eaſy and cheerful talk. It therefore ſo happened, that we were after an hour or two very willing to ſeparate and go to bed.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, September 24, I went into Dr. Johnſon's room before he got up, and finding that the ſtorm of the preceding night was quite laid, I ſat down upon his bed-ſide, and he talked with as much readineſs and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humour as ever. He recommended to me to plant a conſiderable part of a large mooriſh farm which I had purchaſed, and he made ſeveral calculations of the expence and profit, for he delighted in exerciſing his mind on the ſcience of numbers. He preſſed upon me the importance of planting at the firſt in a very ſufficient manner, quoting the ſaying <q rend="inline">"In bello non licet bis errare;"</q> and adding <q rend="inline">"this is equally true in planting."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="176" facs="tcp:0548300102:178" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 I ſpoke with gratitude of Dr. Taylor's hoſpitality; and as evidence that it was not on account of his good table alone that Johnſon viſited him often, I mentioned a little anecdote which had eſcaped my friend's recollection, and at hearing which repeated, he ſmiled. One evening when I was ſitting with him, Frank delivered this meſſage, <q rend="inline">"Sir, Dr. Taylor ſends his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to you, and begs you will dine with him to-morrow. He has got a hare."</q>—<q rend="inline">"My compliments (ſaid Johnſon,) and I'll dine with him, hare or rabbit."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After breakfaſt I departed, and purſued my journey northwards. I took my poſt-chaiſe from the Green Man, a very good inn at Aſhbourne, the miſtreſs of which, a mighty civil gentlewoman, curtſeying very low, preſented me with an engraving of the ſign of her houſe; to which ſhe had ſubjoined, in her own hand-writing, an addreſs in ſuch ſingular ſimplicity of ſtyle, that I have preſerved it paſted upon one of the boards of my original Journal at this time, and ſhall here inſert it for the amuſement of my readers:</p>

                     <p>When I look back upon our late interview, it appears to me to have anſwered expectation better than almoſt any ſcheme of happineſs that I ever put in execution.

                     <p>YOU will wonder, or you have wondered, why no letter has come from me. What you wrote at your return, had in it ſuch a ſtrain of cowardly caution as gave me no pleaſure. I could not well do what you
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0548300102:180" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 wiſhed; I had no need to vex you with a refuſal. I have ſeen Mr.—, and as to him have ſet all right, without any inconvenience, ſo far as I know, to you. Mrs. Thrale had forgot the ſtory. You may now be at eaſe.</p>
                     <p>And at eaſe I certainly wiſh you, for the kindneſs that you ſhowed in coming ſo long a journey to ſee me. It was pity to keep you ſo long in pain, but, upon reviewing the matter, I do not ſee what I could have done better than as I did.</p>
                     <p>I hope you found at your return my dear enemy and all her little people quite well, and had no reaſon to repent your journey. I think on it with great gratitude.</p>
                     <p>I was not well when you left me at the Doctor's, and I grew worſe; yet I ſtaid on, and at Lichfield was very ill. Travelling, however, did not make me worſe; and when I came to London I complied with a ſummons to go to Brighthelmſton, where I ſaw Beauclerk, and ſtaid three days.</p>
                     <p>Our club has recommenced laſt Friday, but I was not there. Langton has another wench <note n="6" place="bottom">A daughter born to him.</note>. Mrs. Thrale is in hopes of a young brewer. They got by their trade laſt year a very large ſum, and their expences are proportionate.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Williams's health is very bad. And I have had for ſome time a very difficult and laborious reſpiration, but I am better by purges, abſtinence, and other methods. I am yet however much behind-hand in my health and reſt.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Blair's ſermons are now univerſally commended<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but let him think that I had the honour of firſt finding and firſt praiſing his excellencies. I did not ſtay to add my voice to that of the publick.</p>
                     <p>My dear friend, let me thank you once more for your viſit; you did me great honour, and I hope met with nothing that diſpleaſed you. I ſtaid long at Aſhbourne, not much pleaſed, yet aukward at departing. I then went to Lichfield, where I found my friend at Stowhill<note n="7" place="bottom">Mrs. Aſton.</note> very dangerouſly diſeaſed. Such is life. Let us try to paſs it well, whatever it be, for there is ſurely ſomething beyond it.</p>
                     <p>Well, now I hope all is well, write as ſoon as you can to,</p>

                     <p>This day's poſt has at length relieved me from much uneaſineſs, by bringing me a letter from you. I was, indeed, doubly uneaſy;—on my
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0548300102:181" rendition="simple:additions"/>
own account and yours. I was very anxious to be ſecured againſt any bad  conſequences from my imprudence in mentioning the gentleman's name who had told me a ſtory to your diſadvantage; and as I could hardly ſuppoſe it poſſible, that you would delay ſo long to make me eaſy, unleſs you was ill, I was not a little apprehenſive about you. You muſt not be offended when I venture to tell you that you appear to me to have been too rigid upon this occaſion. The <hi>'cowardly caution which gave you no pleaſure,'</hi> was ſuggeſted to me by a friend here, to whom I mentioned the ſtrange ſtory and the detection of its falſity, as an inſtance how one may be deceived by what is apparently very good authority. But, as I am ſtill perſuaded, that as I might have obtained the truth, without mentioning the gentleman's name, it was wrong in me to do it, I cannot ſee that you are juſt in blaming my caution. But if you were ever ſo juſt in your diſapprobation, might you not have dealt more tenderly with me?</p>
                     <p>I went to Auchinleck about the middle of October, and paſſed ſome time with my father very comfortably.</p>
                     <p>I am engaged in a criminal proſecution againſt a country ſchoolmaſter, for indecent behaviour to his female ſcholars. There is no ſtatute againſt ſuch abominable conduct; but it is puniſhable at common law. I will be obliged to you for your aſſiſtance in this extraordinary trial.</p>

               <p>About this time I wrote to Johnſon, giving him an account of the deciſion of the <hi>Negro cauſe,</hi> by the Court of Seſſion, which by thoſe who hold even the mildeſt and beſt regulated ſlavery in abomination, (of which number I do not heſitate to declare that I am none,) ſhould be remembered with high reſpect, and to the credit of Scotland; for it went upon a much broader ground than the caſe of <hi>Somerſet,</hi> which was decided in England <note n="8" place="bottom">See State Trials, Vol. XI. p. 339, and Mr. Hargrave's argument.</note>; being truly the general queſtion, whether a perpetual obligation of ſervice to one maſter in any mode ſhould be ſanctioned by the law of a free country. A negro, then called <hi>Joſeph Knight,</hi> a native of Africa, who having been brought to Jamaica in the uſual courſe of the ſlave trade, and purchaſed by a Scotch gentleman in that iſland, had attended his maſter to Scotland, where it was
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0548300102:182"/>
 officiouſly ſuggeſted to him that he would be found entitled to his liberty without any limitation. He accordingly brought his action, in the courſe of which the advocates on both ſides did themſelves great honour. Mr. Maclaurin has had the praiſe of Johnſon, for his argument <note n="9" place="bottom">The motto to it was happily choſen:
<q>
                        <l>"—Nimium ne crede colori."</l>
                     </q>
I cannot avoid mentioning a circumſtance no leſs ſtrange than true, that a brother Advocate in conſiderable practice, but of whom it certainly cannot be ſaid, <hi>Ingenuas didicit fideliter artes,</hi> aſked Mr. Maclaurin, with a face of flippant aſſurance, <q rend="inline">"Are theſe words your own?"</q>
                  </note> in favour of the negro, and Mr. Macconochie diſtinguiſhed himſelf on the ſame ſide, by his ingenuity and extraordinary reſearch. Mr. Cullen, on the part of the maſter, diſcovered good information and ſound reaſoning; in which he was well ſupported by Mr. James Ferguſſon, a man remarkable for a manly underſtanding, and a knowledge both of books and of the world. But I cannot too highly praiſe the ſpeech which Mr. Henry Dundas generouſly contributed to the cauſe of the ſooty ſtranger. Mr. Dundas's Scottiſh accent, which has been ſo often in vain obtruded as an objection to his powerful abilities in parliament, was no diſadvantage to him in his own country. And I do declare, that upon this memorable queſtion he impreſſed me, and I believe all his audience, with ſuch feelings as were produced by ſome of the moſt eminent orations of antiquity. This teſtimony I liberally give to the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of an old friend, with whom it has been my lot to differ very widely upon many political topicks; yet I perſuade myſelf without malice. A great majority of the Lords of Seſſion decided for the negro. But four of their number, the Lord Preſident, Lord Elliock, Lord Monboddo, and Lord Covington, reſolutely maintained the lawfulneſs of a <hi>ſtatus,</hi> which has been acknowledged in all ages and countries, and that when freedom flouriſhed, as in old Greece and Rome.</p>

                     <p>The crime of the ſchoolmaſter whom you are engaged to proſecute is very great, and may be ſuſpected to be too common. In our law it would be a breach of the peace, and a miſdemeanour; that is, a kind of indefinite
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0548300102:183" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                     <p>Mr. Shaw, the authour of the Gaelick Grammar, deſires me to make a requeſt for him to Lord Eglintoune, that he may be appointed Chaplain to one of the new-raiſed regiments.</p>

                     <p>Your alarm at your lady's illneſs was reaſonable, and not diſproportionate to the appearance of the diſorder.

                     <p>WHY I have delayed, for near a month, to thank you for your laſt affectionate letter, I cannot ſay; for my mind has been in better health theſe three weeks than for ſome years paſt. I believe I have evaded till I could ſend you a copy of Lord Hailes's opinion on the negro's cauſe, which he wiſhes you to read, and correct any errours that there may be in the language; for, ſays he, <q rend="inline">'we live in a critical, though not a learned age; and I ſeek to ſcreen myſelf under the ſhield of Ajax.'</q> I communicated to him your apology for keeping the ſheets of his 'Annals' ſo long. He ſays, <q rend="inline">'I am ſorry to ſee that Dr. Johnſon is in a ſtate of languor. Why ſhould a ſober Chriſtian, neither an enthuſiaſt nor a fanatick, be very merry or very ſad?'</q> I envy his Lordſhip's comfortable conſtitution: but well do I know that languor and dejection will afflict the beſt, however excellent their principles. I am in poſſeſſion of Lord Hailes's opinion in his own hand-writing, and have had it for ſome time. My excuſe then for procraſtination muſt be, that I wanted to have it copied; and I have now put that off ſo long, that it will be better to bring it with me than ſend it, as I ſhall probably get you to look at it ſooner when I ſolicit you in perſon.</p>
                     <p>My wife, who is, I thank GOD, a good deal better, is much obliged to you for your very polite and courteous offer of your apartment: but, if ſhe goes to London, it will be beſt for her to have lodgings in the more airy vicinity of Hyde-Park. I, however, doubt much if I ſhall be able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with her to accompany me to the metropolis, for ſhe is ſo different from you and me, that ſhe diſlikes travelling; and ſhe is ſo anxious about her children, that ſhe thinks ſhe ſhould be unhappy if at a diſtance from them.

                     <p>THE alarm of your late illneſs diſtreſſed me but for a few hours; for on the evening of the day that it reached me, I found it contradicted in 'The London Chronicle,' which I could depend upon as authentick con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you, Mr. Strahan being the printer of it. I did not ſee the paper in which <q rend="inline">'the approaching extinction of a bright luminary'</q> was announced. Sir William Forbes told me of it; and he ſays, he ſaw me ſo uneaſy, that he did not give me the report in ſuch ſtrong terms as he had read it. He after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſent me a letter from Mr. Langton to him, which relieved me much. I am, however, not quite eaſy, as I have not heard from you; and now I ſhall not have that comfort before I ſee you, for I ſet out for London to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow before the poſt comes in.

               <p>On Wedneſday, March 18, I arrived in London, and was informed by good Mr. Francis that his maſter was better, and was gone to Mr. Thrale's at Streatham, to which place I wrote to him, begging to know when he would be in town. He was not expected for ſome time; but next day having called on Dr. Taylor, in Dean's-yard, Weſtminſter, I found him there, and was told he had come to town for a few hours. He met me with his
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0548300102:188" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 uſual kindneſs, but inſtantly returned to the writing of ſomething on which he was employed when I came in, and on which he ſeemed much intent. Finding him thus engaged, I made my viſit very ſhort, and had no more of his converſation, except his expreſſing a ſerious regret that a friend of ours was living at too much expence, conſidering how poor an appearance he made: <q rend="inline">"If (ſaid he) a man has ſplendour from his expence, if he ſpends his money in pride or in pleaſure, he has value: but if he lets others ſpend it for him, which is moſt commonly the caſe, he has no advantage from it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Friday, March 20, I found him at his own houſe, ſitting with Mrs. Williams, and was informed that the room formerly allotted to me was now appropriated to a charitable purpoſe; Mrs. Deſmoulins <note n="4" place="bottom">Daughter of Dr. Swinſen, Johnſon's godfather, and widow of Mr. Deſmoulins, a writing-maſter.</note>, and I think her daughter, and a Miſs Carmichael, being all lodged in it. Such was his humanity, and ſuch his generoſity, that Mrs. Deſmoulins herſelf told me, he allowed her half-a-guinea a week. Let it be remembered, that this was above a twelfth part of his penſion.</p>
               <p>His liberality, indeed, was at all periods of his life very remarkable. Mr. Howard, of Lichfield, at whoſe father's houſe Johnſon had in his early years been kindly received, told me, that when he was a boy at the Charter-Houſe, his father wrote to him to go and pay a viſit to Mr. Samuel Johnſon, which he accordingly did, and found him in an upper room, of poor appearance. Johnſon received him with much courteouſneſs, and talked a great deal to him, as to a ſchool-boy, of the courſe of his education, and other particulars. When he afterwards came to know and underſtand the high character of this great man, he recollected his condeſcenſion with wonder. He added, that when he was going away, Mr. Johnſon preſented him with half-a-guinea; and this, ſaid Mr. Howard, was at a time when he probably had not another.</p>
               <p>We retired from Mrs. Williams to another room. Tom Davies ſoon after joined us. He had now unfortunately failed in his circumſtances, and was much indebted to Dr. Johnſon's kindneſs for obtaining for him many allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his diſtreſs. After he went away, Johnſon blamed his folly in quitting the ſtage, by which he and his wife got five hundred pounds a year. I ſaid, I believed it was owing to Churchill's attack upon him,
<q>
                     <l>"He mouths a ſentence as curs mouth a bone."</l>
                  </q>
JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I believe ſo too, Sir. But what a man is he who is to be driven from the ſtage by a line? Another line would have driven him from his ſhop."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="187" facs="tcp:0548300102:189" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I told him, that I was engaged as Counſel at the bar of the Houſe of  Commons to oppoſe a road-bill in the county of Stirling, and aſked him what mode he would adviſe me to follow in addreſſing ſuch an audience. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, you muſt provide yourſelf with a good deal of extraneous matter, which you are to produce occaſionally, ſo as to fill up the time; for you muſt conſider, that they do not liſten much. If you begin with the ſtrength of your cauſe, it may be loſt before they begin to liſten. When you catch a moment of attention, preſs the merits of the queſtion upon them."</q> He ſaid, as to one point of the merits, that he thought <q rend="inline">"it would be a wrong thing to deprive the ſmall landholders of the privilege of aſſeſſing themſelves for making and repairing the high roads; <hi>it was deſtroying ſo much liberty, without a good reaſon, which was always a bad thing.</hi>"</q> When I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned this obſervation next day to Mr. Wilkes, he pleaſantly ſaid, <q rend="inline">"What! does <hi>he</hi> talk of liberty? <hi>Liberty</hi> is as ridiculous in <hi>his</hi> mouth as <hi>Religion</hi> in <hi>mine.</hi>"</q> Mr. Wilkes's advice, as to the beſt mode of ſpeaking at the bar of the Houſe of Commons, was not more reſpectful towards the ſenate, than that of Dr. Johnſon. <q rend="inline">"Be as impudent as you can, as merry as you can, and ſay whatever comes uppermoſt. Jack Lee is the beſt heard there of any Counſel; and he is the moſt impudent dog, and always abuſing us."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In my interview with Dr. Johnſon this evening, I was quite eaſy, quite as his companion; upon which I find in my Journal the following reflection: <q rend="inline">"So ready is my mind to ſuggeſt matter for diſſatisfaction, that I felt a ſort of regret that I was ſo eaſy. I miſſed that aweful reverence with which I uſed to contemplate <hi>Mr. Samuel Johnſon,</hi> in the complex magnitude of his literary, moral, and religious character. I have a wonderful ſuperſtitious love of <hi>myſtery;</hi> when, perhaps, the truth is, that it is owing to the cloudy darkneſs of my own mind. I ſhould be glad that I am more advanced in my progreſs of being, ſo that I can view Dr. Johnſon with a ſteadier and clearer eye. My diſſatisfaction to-night was fooliſh. Would it not be fooliſh to regret that we ſhall have leſs myſtery in a future ſtate? That we 'now ſee in a glaſs darkly,' but ſhall 'then ſee face to face?"</q>—This reflection, which I thus freely communicate, will be valued by the thinking part of my readers, who may have themſelves experienced ſimilar ſtates of mind.</p>
               <p>He returned next day to Streatham, to Mr. Thrale's; where, as Mr. Strahan once complained to me, <q rend="inline">"he was in a great meaſure abſorbed from the ſociety of his old friends."</q> I was kept in London by buſineſs, and wrote to him on the 27th, that <q rend="inline">"a ſeparation from him for a week, when we were
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0548300102:190" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 ſo near, was equal to a ſeparation for a year, when we were at four hundred miles diſtance."</q> I went to Streatham on Monday, March 30. Before he appeared, Mrs. Thrale made a very characteriſtical remark:—<q rend="inline">"I do not know for certain what will pleaſe Dr. Johnſon: but I know for certain that it will diſpleaſe him to praiſe any thing, even what he likes, extravagantly."</q>
               </p>
               <p>At dinner he laughed at querulous declamations againſt the age, on account of luxury—increaſe of London—ſcarcity of proviſions—and other ſuch topicks. <q rend="inline">"Houſes (ſaid he) will be built till rents fall; and corn is more plentiful now than ever it was."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I had before dinner repeated a ridiculous ſtory told me by an old man who had been a paſſenger with me in the ſtage-coach to-day. Mrs. Thrale, having taken occaſion to allude to it in talking to me, called it <q rend="inline">"The ſtory told you by the old <hi>woman.</hi>"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Now, Madam, (ſaid I,) give me leave to catch you in the fact: it was not an old <hi>woman,</hi> but an old <hi>man,</hi> whom I mentioned as having told me this."</q> I preſumed to take an opportunity, in preſence of Johnſon, of ſhewing this lively lady how ready ſhe was, uninten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally, to deviate from exact authenticity of narration.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Thomas à Kempis (he obſerved) muſt be a good book, as the world has opened its arms to receive it. It is ſaid to have been printed, in one language or other, as many times as there have been months ſince it firſt came out. I always was ſtruck with this ſentence in it: 'Be not angry that you cannot make others as you wiſh them to be, ſince you cannot make yourſelf as you wiſh to be."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I was angry with Hurd about Cowley, for having publiſhed a ſelection of his works: but, upon better conſideration, I think there is no impropriety in a man's publiſhing as much as he chooſes of any authour, if he does not put the reſt out of the way. A man, for inſtance, may print the Odes of Horace alone."</q> He ſeemed to be in a more indulgent humour than when this ſubject was diſcuſſed between him and Mr. Murphy <note n="5" place="bottom">See p. 59 of this Volume.</note>.</p>
               <p>When we were at tea and coffee, there came in Lord Trimbleſtown, in whoſe family was an ancient Iriſh peerage, but it ſuffered by taking the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous ſide in the troubles of the laſt century. He was a man of pleaſing converſation, and was accompanied by a young gentleman, his ſon.</p>
               <p>I mentioned that I had in my poſſeſſion the Life of Sir Robert Sibbald, the celebrated Scottiſh antiquary, and founder of the Royal College of Phyſicians at Edinburgh, in the original manuſcript in his own hand-writing; and
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0548300102:191" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that it was I believed the moſt natural and candid account of himſelf that ever  was given by any man. As an inſtance, he tells that the Duke of Perth, then Chancellor of Scotland, preſſed him very much to come over to the Roman-Catholick Faith; that he reſiſted all his Grace's arguments for a conſiderable time, till one day he felt himſelf as it were inſtantaneouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and with tears in his eyes ran into the Duke's arms, and embraced the ancient religion; that he continued very ſteady in it for ſome time, and accompanied his Grace to London one winter, and lived in his houſehold; that there he found the rigid faſting preſcribed by the church very ſevere upon him; that this diſpoſed him to reconſider the controverſy, and having then ſeen that he was in the wrong, he returned to Proteſtantiſm. I talked of ſome time or other publiſhing this curious life. MRS. THRALE. <q rend="inline">"I think you had as well let alone that publication. To diſcover ſuch weakneſs expoſes a man when he is gone."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, it is an honeſt picture of human nature. How often are the primary motives of our greateſt actions as ſmall as Sibbald's, for his re-converſion."</q> MRS. THRALE. <q rend="inline">"But may they not as well be forgotten?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Madam, a man loves to review his own mind. That is the uſe of a diary, or journal."</q> LORD TRIMBLESTOWN. <q rend="inline">"True, Sir. As the ladies love to ſee themſelves in a glaſs; ſo a man likes to ſee himſelf in his journal."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"A very pretty alluſion."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, indeed."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"And as a lady adjuſts her dreſs before a mirror, a man adjuſts his character by looking at his journal."</q> I next year found the very ſame thought in Atterbury's <q rend="inline">"Sermon on Lady Cutts."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"In this glaſs ſhe every day dreſſed her mind."</q> This is a proof of coincidence, and not of plagiariſm; for I had never read that ſermon before.</p>
               <p>Next morning, while we were at breakfaſt, Johnſon gave a very earneſt recommendation of what he himſelf practiſed with the utmoſt conſcientiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: I mean a ſtrict attention to truth, even in the moſt minute particulars. <q rend="inline">"Accuſtom your children (ſaid he) conſtantly to this; if a thing happened at one window, and they, when relating it, ſay that it happened at another, do not let it paſs, but inſtantly check them; you do not know where deviation from truth will end."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"It may come to the door; and when once an account is at all varied in one circumſtance, it may by degrees be varied ſo as to be totally different from what really happened."</q> Our lively hoſteſs, whoſe fancy was impatient of the rein, fidgeted at this, and ventured to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Nay, this is too much. If Mr. Johnſon ſhould forbid me to drink tea I would comply, as I ſhould feel the reſtraint only twice a day; but little variations in narrative muſt happen a thouſand times a day, if one is not
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0548300102:192" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 perpetually watching."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Well, Madam, and you <hi>ought</hi> to be perpetually watching. It is more from careleſſneſs about truth than from intentional lying, that there is ſo much falſehood in the world."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In his review of Dr. Warton's <q rend="inline">"Eſſay on the Writings and Genius of Pope,"</q> Johnſon has given the following ſalutary caution upon this ſubject: <q rend="inline">"Nothing but experience could evince the frequency of falſe information, or unable any man to conceive that ſo many groundleſs reports ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagated, as every man of eminence may hear of himſelf. Some men relate what they think, as what they know; ſome men of confuſed memories and habitual inaccuracy, aſcribe to one man what belongs to another; and ſome talk on, without thought or care. A few men are ſufficient to broach falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoods, which are afterwards innocently diffuſed by ſucceſſive relaters <note n="6" place="bottom">Literary Magazine, 1756, p. 37.</note>."</q> Had he lived to read what Sir John Hawkins and Mrs. Piozzi have related concerning himſelf, how much would he have found his obſervation illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated. He was indeed, ſo much impreſſed with the prevalence of falſehood, voluntary or unintentional, that I never knew any perſon who upon hearing an extraordinary circumſtance told, diſcovered more of the <hi>incredulus odi.</hi> He would ſay with a ſignificant look and deciſive tone, <q rend="inline">"It is not ſo. Do not tell this again."</q> He inculcated upon all his friends the importance of perpetual vigilance againſt the ſlighteſt degrees of falſehood, the effect of which, as Sir Joſhua Reynolds obſerved to me, has been, that all who were of his ſchool are diſtinguiſhed for a love of truth and accuracy, which they would not have poſſeſſed in the ſame degree, if they had not been known to Johnſon.</p>
               <p>Talking of ghoſts, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is wonderful<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that five thouſand years have now elapſed ſince the creation of the world, and ſtill it is undecided whether or not there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> has ever been an inſtance of the ſpirit of any perſon appearing after death. All argument is againſt it; but all belief is for it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"John Weſley's converſation is good, but he is never at leiſure. He is always obliged to go at a certain hour. This is very diſagreeable to a man who loves to fold his legs and have out his talk, as I do."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Friday, April 3, I dined with him in London, in a company where were preſent ſeveral eminent men, whom I ſhall not name, but diſtinguiſh their parts in the converſation by different letters.</p>
               <p>F. <q rend="inline">"I have been looking at this famous antique marble dog of Mr. Jennings, valued at a thouſand guineas, ſaid to be Alcibiades's dog."</q>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:0548300102:193" rendition="simple:additions"/>
JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"His tail then muſt be docked. That was the mark of Alci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biades's  dog."</q> E. <q rend="inline">"A thouſand guineas! The repreſentation of no animal whatever is worth ſo much. At this rate a dead dog would indeed be better than a living lion."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is not the worth of the thing, but of the ſkill in forming it which is ſo highly eſtimated. Every thing that enlarges the ſphere of human powers, that ſhows man he can do what he thought he could not do, is valuable. The firſt man who balanced a ſtraw upon his noſe; Johnſton who rode upon three horſes at a time; in ſhort, all ſuch men deſerved the applauſe of mankind, not on account of the uſe of what they did, but of the dexterity which they exhibited."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yet a miſapplication of time and aſſiduity is not to be encouraged. Addiſon, in one of his 'Spectators' commends the judgement of a King, who as a ſuitable reward to a man that by long perſeverance had attained to the art of throwing a barley-corn through the eye of a needle, gave him a buſhel of barley."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He has been a King of Scotland, where barley is ſcarce."</q> F. <q rend="inline">"One of the moſt remarkable antique figures of an animal is the boar at Florence."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"The firſt boar that is well made in marble ſhould be preſerved as a wonder. When men arrive at a facility of making boars well, then the workmanſhip is not of ſuch value, but they ſhould however be preſerved as examples, and as a greater ſecurity for the reſtoration of the art, ſhould it be loſt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>E. <q rend="inline">"We hear prodigious complaints at preſent of emigration. I am convinced that emigration makes a country more populous."</q> J. <q rend="inline">"That ſounds very much like a paradox."</q> E. <q rend="inline">"Exportation of men, like exporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all other commodities, makes more be produced."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But there would be more people were there not emigration, provided there were food for more."</q> E. <q rend="inline">"No; leave a few breeders, and you'll have more people than if there were no emigration."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, it is plain there will be more people, if there are more breeders. Thirty cows in good paſture will produce more calves than ten cows, provided they have good bulls."</q> E. <q rend="inline">"There are bulls enough in Ireland."</q> JOHNSON. (ſmiling,) <q rend="inline">"So, Sir, I ſhould think from your argument."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"You ſaid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of men, like exportation of other commodities, makes more be produced. But a bounty is given to encourage the exportation of corn, and no bounty is given for the exportation of men; though, indeed, thoſe who go gain by it."</q> R. <q rend="inline">"But the bounty on the exportation of corn is paid at home."</q> E. <q rend="inline">"That's the ſame thing."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir."</q> R. <q rend="inline">"A man who ſtays at home gains nothing by his neighbour's emigrating."</q>
                  <pb n="192" facs="tcp:0548300102:194" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I can underſtand that emigration may be the cauſe that more people may be produced in a country; but the country will not therefore be from that the more populous, for the people iſſue from it. It can only be ſaid that there is a flow of people. It is an encouragement to have children, to know that they can get a living by emigration."</q> R. <q rend="inline">"Yes, if there were an emigration of children under ſix years of age. But they don't emigrate till they could earn their livelihood in ſome way at home."</q> C. <q rend="inline">"It is remarkable that the moſt unhealthy countries, where there are the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive diſeaſes, ſuch as Egypt and Bengal, are the moſt populous."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Countries which are the moſt populous have the moſt deſtructive diſeaſes. <hi>That</hi> is the true ſtate of the propoſition."</q> C. <q rend="inline">"Holland is very unhealthy, yet it is exceedingly populous."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I know not that Holland is unhealthy. But its populouſneſs is owing to an influx of people from all other countries. Diſeaſe cannot be the cauſe of populouſneſs, for it not only carries off a great proportion of the people; but thoſe who are left are weakened, and unfit for the purpoſes of increaſe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>R. <q rend="inline">"Mr. E. I don't mean to flatter, but when poſterity reads one of your ſpeeches in parliament, it will be difficult to believe that you took ſo much pains, knowing with certainty that it could produce no effect, that not one vote would be gained by it."</q> E. <q rend="inline">"Waving your compliment to me, I ſhall ſay in general, that it is very well worth while for a man to take pains to ſpeak well in parliament. A man, who has vanity, ſpeaks to diſplay his talents; and if a man ſpeaks well, he gradually eſtabliſhes a certain reputation and conſequence in the general opinion, which ſooner or later will have its political reward. Beſides, though not one vote is gained, a good ſpeech has its effect. Though an act which has been ably oppoſed paſſes into a law, yet in its progreſs it is modelled, it is ſoftened in ſuch a manner, that we ſee plainly the miniſter has been told, that the members attached to him are ſo ſenſible of its injuſtice or abſurdity from what they have heard, that it muſt be altered."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"And, Sir, there is a gratification of pride. Though we cannot out-vote them we will out-argue them.

(I except the minority, which I hold to be pure [ſmiling] but I take the whole Houſe.)

But intereſt will not make us do every thing. In a caſe which admits of doubt, we try to think on the ſide which is for our intereſt, and generally bring our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to act accordingly. But the ſubject muſt admit of diverſity of colouring; it muſt receive a colour on that ſide. In the Houſe of Commons there are members enough who will not vote what is groſsly unjuſt or abſurd. No, Sir, there muſt always be right enough, or appearance of right, to keep wrong in countenance."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"There is ſurely always a majority in parliament who have places, or who want to have them, and who therefore will be generally ready to ſupport government without requiring any pretext."</q> E. <q rend="inline">"True, Sir; that majority will always follow

All travellers generally mean to tell truth; though Thickneſs obſerves, upon Smollet's account of his alarming a whole town in France by firing a blunderbuſs, and frightening a French nobleman till he made him tie on his portmanteau, that he would be loth to ſay Smollet had told two lies in one page; but he had found the only town in France where theſe things could have happened. Travellers muſt often be miſtaken. In every thing, except where menſuration can be applied, they may honeſtly differ. There has been, of late, a ſtrange turn in travellers to be diſpleaſed."</q>

As it is ſaid of the greateſt liar, that he tells more truth than falſehood; ſo it may be ſaid of the worſt man, that he does more good than evil."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Perhaps from experience men may be found happier than we ſuppoſe."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; the more we enquire we ſhall find men the leſs happy."</q> P. <q rend="inline">"As to thinking better or worſe of mankind from experience, ſome cunning people will not be ſatisfied unleſs they have put men to the teſt, as they think. There is a very good ſtory told of Sir Godfrey Kneller, in his character of a Juſtice of the peace. A gentleman brought his ſervant before him, upon an accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of having ſtolen ſome money from him; but it having come out that he had laid it purpoſely in the ſervant's way, in order to try his honeſty, Sir Godfrey ſent the maſter to priſon."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"To reſiſt temptation once, is not a ſufficient proof of honeſty.

<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0548300102:197" rendition="simple:additions"/>
when he is ſure his maſter does not know how much there is of it, he would  give a ſtrong proof of honeſty. But this is a proof to which you have no right to put a man. You know, humanly ſpeaking, there is a certain degree of temptation which will overcome any virtue. Now, in ſo far as you approach temptation to a man, you do him an injury; and, if he is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, you ſhare his guilt."</q> P. <q rend="inline">"And, when once overcome, it is eaſier for him to be got the better of again."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yes, you are his ſeducer; you have debauched him. I have known a man reſolve to put friendſhip to the teſt, by aſking a friend to lend him money, merely with that view, when he did not want it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That is very wrong, Sir. Your friend may be a narrow man, and yet have many good qualities: narrowneſs may be his only fault. Now you are trying his general character as a friend, by one particular ſingly, in which he happens to be defective, when, in truth, his character is compoſed of many particulars."</q>

It is hardly to be believed what abſurd and indecent images men will intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce into their writings, without being ſenſible of the abſurdity and indecency.

The Ducheſs of Buckingham aſked Lord Orrery <hi>who</hi> this perſon was? He anſwered, he did not know. She ſaid, ſhe would ſend to Mr. Pulteney, who, ſhe ſuppoſed, could inform her. So then, to prevent her from making herſelf ridiculous, Lord Orrery ſent her Grace a note, in which he gave her to underſtand what was meant."</q>

               <p>He was very ſilent this evening; and read in a variety of books; ſuddenly throwing down one, and taking up another.</p>
               <p>He talked of going to Streatham that night. TAYLOR. <q rend="inline">"You'll be robbed if you do; or you muſt ſhoot a highwayman. Now I would rather be robbed than do that: I would not ſhoot a highwayman."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But I would rather ſhoot him in the inſtant when he is attempting to rob me, than afterwards ſwear againſt him at the Old-Bailey to take away his life, after he has robbed me. I am ſurer I am right in the one caſe than in the other. I may be miſtaken as to the man when I ſwear: I cannot be miſtaken if I ſhoot him in the act. Beſides, we feel leſs reluctance to take away a man's life when we are heated by the injury, than to do it at a diſtance of time by an oath, after we have cooled."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"So, Sir, you would rather act from the motive of private paſſion, than that of publick advantage."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, when I ſhoot the highwayman I act from both."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Very well, very well.—There is no catching him."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"At the ſame time one does not know what to ſay. For perhaps one may, a year after, hang himſelf from uneaſineſs for having ſhot a man <note n="8" place="bottom">The late Duke of Montroſe was generally ſaid to have been uneaſy on that account; but I can contradict the report from his Grace's own authority. As he uſed to admit me to very eaſy conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation with him, I took the liberty to introduce the ſubject. His Grace told me, that when riding one night near London, he was attacked by two highwaymen on horſeback, and that he inſtantly ſhot one of them, upon which the other galloped off; that his ſervant, who was very well mounted, propoſed to purſue him and take him, but that his Grace ſaid, <q rend="inline">"No, we have had blood enough: I hope the man may live to repent."</q> His Grace, upon my preſuming to put the queſtion, aſſured me, that his mind was not all clouded by what he had thus done in ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defence.</note>.

               <p>Thrale's carriage not having come for him, as he expected, I accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied him ſome part of the way home to his own houſe.

               <p>On Tueſday, April 7, I breakfaſted with him at his houſe. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"nobody was content."</q> I mentioned to him a reſpectable perſon in Scotland whom he knew; and I aſſerted, that I really believed he was always content. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, he is not content with the preſent; he has always ſome new ſcheme, ſome new plantation, ſomething which is future. You know he was not content as a widower; for he married again."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But he is not reſtleſs."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, he is only locally at reſt. A chymiſt is locally at reſt; but his mind is hard at work. This gentleman has done with external exertions. It is too late for him to engage in diſtant projects."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"He ſeems to amuſe himſelf quite well; to have his attention fixed, and his tranquillity preſerved by very ſmall matters. I have tried this, but it would not do with me."</q> JOHNSON. (laughing) <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; it muſt be born with a man to be contented to take up with little things. Women have a great advantage that they may take up with little things, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gracing themſelves: a man cannot, except with fiddling. Had I learnt to fiddle, I ſhould have done nothing elſe."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, did you ever play on any muſical inſtrument?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir.

JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is ſad ſtuff, Sir, miſerably written, as books in general then were. There is now an elegance of ſtyle univerſally diffuſed. No man now writes ſo ill as Martin's Account of the Hebrides is written. A man could not write ſo ill, if he ſhould try. Set a merchant's clerk now to write, and he'll do better."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He talked to me with ſerious concern of a certain female friend's <q rend="inline">"laxity of narration, and inattention to truth."</q>—<q rend="inline">"I am as much vexed (ſaid he) at the eaſe with which ſhe hears it mentioned to her, as at the thing itſelf. I told her, 'Madam, you are contented to hear every day ſaid to you, what the higheſt of mankind have died for, rather than bear.'—You know, Sir, the higheſt of mankind have died rather than bear to be told they had uttered a falſehood. Do talk to her of it: I am weary."</q>

               <p>BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Was not Dr. John Campbell a very inaccurate man in his narrative, Sir. He once told me, that he drank thirteen bottles of port at a ſitting."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I do not know that Campbell ever lied with pen and ink; but you could not entirely depend on any thing he told you in converſation, if there was fact mixed with it. However, I loved Campbell he was a ſolid orthodox man: he had a reverence for religion.

               <p>Talking of drinking wine, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I did not leave off wine becauſe I could not bear it: I have drunk three bottles of port without being the worſe for it. Univerſity College has witneſſed this."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Why then, Sir, did you leave it off?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, becauſe it is ſo much better for a man to be ſure that he is never to be intoxicated, never to loſe the power over himſelf. I ſhall not begin to drink wine again till I grow old, and want it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I think, Sir, you once ſaid to me, that not to drink wine was a great deduction from life<note n="2" place="bottom">See p. 154 of this Volume.</note>

I have had more pleaſure from your converſation. I have indeed; I aſſure you I have."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"When we talk of pleaſure, we mean ſenſual pleaſure. When a man ſays he had pleaſure with a woman, he does not mean converſation, but ſomething of a very different nature. Philoſophers tell you, that pleaſure is <hi>contrary</hi> to happineſs.

 there are men who have preferred living among ſavages. Now what a wretch muſt he be, who is content with ſuch converſation as can be had among ſavages! You may remember an officer at Fort Auguſtus, who had ſerved in America, told us of a woman whom they were obliged to <hi>bind,</hi> in order to get her back from ſavage life."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"She muſt have been an animal, a beaſt."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, ſhe was a ſpeaking cat."</q>

A man cannot know modes of life as well in Minorca as in London; but he may ſtudy mathematicks as well in Minorca."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I don't know, Sir: if you had remained ten years in the Iſle of Col, you would not have been the man that you now are."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, if I had been there from fifteen to twenty-five; but not if from twenty-five to thirty-five."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I own, Sir, the ſpirits which I have in London make me do every thing with more readineſs and vigour.

               <p>Of Goldſmith he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He was not an agreeable companion, for he talked always for fame. A man who does ſo never can be pleaſing.

               <p>Soon after our arrival at Thrale's, I heard one of the maids calling eagerly on another, to go to Dr. Johnſon. I wondered what this could mean. I afterwards learnt, that it was to give her a Bible which he had brought from London as a preſent to her.</p>
               <p>He was for a conſiderable time occupied in reading <q rend="inline">"Memoires de Fontenelle;"</q> leaning and ſwinging upon the low gate into the court, without his hat.</p>
               <p>I looked into Lord Kames's <q rend="inline">"Sketches of the Hiſtory of Man;"</q> and mentioned to Dr. Johnſon his cenſure of Charles the Fifth, for celebrating his funeral obſequies in his life-time, which, I told him, I had been uſed to think a ſolemn and affecting act. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, a man may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his mind to think ſo of that act of Charles; but it is ſo liable to
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:0548300102:203" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ridicule, that if one man out of ten thouſand laughs at it, he'll make the  other nine thouſand nine hundred and ninety-nine laugh too."</q> I could not agree with him in this.</p>
               <p>Sir John Pringle had expreſſed a wiſh that I would aſk Dr. Johnſon's opinion what were the beſt Engliſh ſermons for ſtyle. I took an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to-day of mentioning ſeveral to him. <hi>Atterbury?</hi> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, one of the beſt."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Tillotſon?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why not now. I ſhould not adviſe a preacher at this day to imitate Tillotſon's ſtyle; though I don't know; I ſhould be cautious of objecting to what has been applauded by ſo many ſuffrages.—<hi>South</hi> is one of the beſt, if you except his peculiarities, and his violence, and ſometimes coarſeneſs of language.—<hi>Seed</hi> has a very fine ſtyle; but he is not very theological.—<hi>Jortin's</hi> ſermons are very elegant.—<hi>Sherlock's</hi> ſtyle too is very elegant, though he has not made it his principal ſtudy.—And you may add <hi>Smallridge.</hi> All the latter preachers have a good ſtyle. Indeed, nobody now talks much of ſtyle: Every body compoſes pretty well. There are no ſuch unharmonious periods as there were a hundred years ago. I ſhould recommend Dr. <hi>Clarke's</hi> ſermons, were he orthodox. However, it is very well known <hi>where</hi> he was not orthodox, which was upon the doctrine of the Trinity, as to which he is a condemned heretick; ſo one is aware of it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I like Ogden's ſermons on prayer very much, both for neatneſs of ſtyle and ſubtilty of reaſoning."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I ſhould like to read all that Ogden has written."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"What I wiſh to know is, what ſermons afford the beſt ſpecimen of Engliſh pulpit eloquence."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"We have no ſermons addreſſed to the paſſions that are good for any thing; if you mean that kind of eloquence."</q> A CLERGYMAN. (whoſe name I do not recollect) <q rend="inline">"Were not Dodd's ſermons addreſſed to the paſſions?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"They were nothing, Sir, be they addreſſed to what they may."</q>
               </p>
               <p>At dinner, Mrs. Thrale expreſſed a wiſh to go and ſee Scotland. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Seeing Scotland, Madam, is only ſeeing a worſe England. It is ſeeing the flower gradually fade away to the naked ſtalk. Seeing the Hebrides, indeed, is ſeeing quite a different ſcene."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our poor friend, Mr. Thomas Davies, was ſoon to have a benefit at Drury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lane theatre, as ſome relief to his unfortunate circumſtances. We were all warmly intereſted for his ſucceſs, and had contributed to it. However, we thought there was no harm in having our joke when he could not be hurt by it. I propoſed that he ſhould be brought on to ſpeak a Prologue upon the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; and I began to mutter fragments of what it might be: as, that when
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:0548300102:204" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 now grown <hi>old,</hi> he was obliged to cry, <q rend="inline">"Poor Tom's <hi>a-cold;</hi>"</q>—that he owned he had been driven from the ſtage by a Churchill, but that this was no diſgrace, for a Churchill had beat the French;—that he had been ſatyriſed as <q rend="inline">"mouthing a ſentence as curs mouth a bone,"</q> but he was now glad of a bone to pick.—<q rend="inline">"Nay, (ſaid Johnſon,) I would have him to ſay,
<q>
                        <l>'Mad Tom is come to ſee the world again."</l>
                     </q>

               </p>
               <p>He and I returned to town in the evening. Upon the road I endeavoured to maintain, in argument, that a landed gentleman is not under any obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to reſide upon his eſtate; and that by living in London he does no injury to his country. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, he does no injury to his country in general, becauſe the money which he draws from it gets back again in circulation; but to his particular diſtrict, his particular pariſh, he does an injury. All that he has to give away is not given to thoſe who have the firſt claim to it. And though I have ſaid that the money circulates back, it is a long time before that happens. Then, Sir, a man of family and eſtate ought to conſider himſelf as having the charge of a diſtrict, over which he is to diffuſe civility and happineſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Next day I found him at home in the forenoon. He praiſed Delaney's <q rend="inline">"Obſervations on Swift;"</q> ſaid that his book and Lord Orrery's might both be true, though one viewed Swift more, and the other leſs favourably; and that, between both, we might have a complete notion of Swift.</p>
               <p>Talking of a man's reſolving to deny himſelf the uſe of wine, from moral and religious conſiderations, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He muſt not doubt about it. When one doubts as to pleaſure, we know what will be the concluſion. I now no more think of drinking wine, than a horſe does. The wine upon the table is no more for me, than for the dog that is under the table."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Thurſday, April 9, I dined with him at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's, with the Biſhop of St. Aſaph, (Dr. Shipley,) Mr. Allan Ramſay, Mr. Gibbon, Mr. Cambridge, and Mr. Langton. Mr. Ramſay had lately returned from Italy, and entertained us with his obſervations upon Horace's villa, which he had examined with great care. I reliſhed this much, as it brought freſh into my mind what I had viewed with great pleaſure thirteen years before. The Biſhop, Dr. Johnſon, and Mr. Cambridge, joined with Mr. Ramſay, in recollecting the various lines in Horace relating to the ſubject.</p>
               <p>Horace's journey to Brunduſium being mentioned, Johnſon obſerved, that the brook which he deſcribes is to be ſeen now, exactly as at that time;
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0548300102:205" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and that he had often wondered how it happened, that ſmall brooks, ſuch as  this, kept the ſame ſituation for ages, notwithſtanding earthquakes, by which even mountains have been changed, and agriculture, which produces ſuch a variation upon the ſurface of the earth. CAMBRIDGE. <q rend="inline">"A Spaniſh writer has this thought in a poetical conceit. After obſerving that moſt of the ſolid ſtructures of Rome are totally periſhed, while the Tiber remains the ſame, he adds,
<q>
                        <l>'Lo que era Firme huió i ſolamente,</l>
                        <l>'Lo Fugitivo permanece i dura."</l>
                     </q>
                  </q>
JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, that is taken from <hi>Janus Vitalis:</hi>

                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>The Biſhop ſaid, it appeared from Horace's writings that he was a cheerful contented man. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"We have no reaſon to believe that, my Lord. Are we to think Pope was happy, becauſe he ſays ſo in his writings? We ſee in his writings what he wiſhed the ſtate of his mind to appear. Dr. Young, who pined for preferment, talks with contempt of it in his writings, and affects to deſpiſe every thing that he did not deſpiſe."</q> BISHOP OF ST. ASAPH. <q rend="inline">"He was like other chaplains, looking for vacancies: but that is not peculiar to the clergy. I remember when I was with the army, after the battle of Lafeldt, the officers ſeriouſly grumbled that no General was killed."</q> CAMBRIDGE. <q rend="inline">"We may believe Horace more when he ſays,
<q>
                        <l>'Romae Tibur amem ventoſus Tibure Romam."</l>
                     </q>
                  </q>
BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"How hard is it that man can never be at reſt."</q> RAMSAY. <q rend="inline">"It is not in his nature to be at reſt. When he is at reſt he is in the worſt ſtate that he can be in, for he has nothing to agitate him. He is then like the man in the Iriſh ſong,
<q>
                        <l>'There was an old fellow at Ballanacrazy,</l>

                  </q>
Goldſmith being mentioned, Johnſon obſerved that it was long before his merit came to be acknowledged. That he once complained to him, in ludicrous terms of diſtreſs, <q rend="inline">"Whenever I write any thing, the publick <hi>make a point</hi> to know nothing about it:"</q> but that his <q rend="inline">"Traveller"</q> brought him into high reputation. LANGTON. <q rend="inline">"There is not one bad line in that poem;
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0548300102:206" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 not one of Dryden's careleſs verſes."</q> SIR JOSHUA. <q rend="inline">"I was glad to hear Charles Fox ſay it was one of the fineſt poems in the Engliſh language."</q> LANGTON. <q rend="inline">"Why was you glad? You ſurely had no doubt of this before."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No; the merit of 'The Traveller' is ſo well eſtabliſhed, that Mr. Fox's praiſe cannot augment it, nor his cenſure diminiſh it."</q> SIR JOSHUA. <q rend="inline">"But his friends may ſuſpect they had a too great partiality for him."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, the partiality of his friends was all againſt him. It was with difficulty we could give him a hearing. Goldſmith had no ſettled notions upon any ſubject; ſo he talked always at random. It ſeemed to be his intention to blurt out whatever was in his mind, and ſee what would become of it. He was angry too when catched in an abſurdity; but it did not prevent him from falling into another the next minute. I remember Chamier, after talking with him for ſome time, ſaid, 'Well, I do believe he wrote this poem himſelf: and, let me tell you, that is believing a great deal.' Chamier once aſked him what he meant by <hi>ſlow,</hi> the laſt word in the firſt line of 'The Traveller,'
<q>
                        <l>'Remote, unfriended, melancholy, ſlow.'</l>
                     </q>
Did he mean tardineſs of locomotion? Goldſmith, who would ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing without conſideration, anſwered, 'Yes.' I was ſitting by, and ſaid, 'No, Sir; you do not mean tardineſs of locomotion; you mean, that ſlug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſhneſs of mind which comes upon a man in ſolitude. Chamier believed then that I had written the line, as much as if he had ſeen me write it. Goldſmith, however, was a man, who, whatever he wrote, did it better than any other man could do. He deſerved a place in Weſtminſter-Abbey, and every year he lived, would have deſerved it better. He had, indeed, been at no pains to fill his mind with knowledge. He tranſplanted it from one place to another; and it did not ſettle in his mind; ſo he could not tell what was in his own books."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of living in the country. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No wiſe man will go to live in the country, unleſs he has ſomething to do which can be better done in the country. For inſtance: if he is to ſhut himſelf up for a year to ſtudy a ſcience, it is better to look out to the fields, than to an oppoſite wall. Then, if a man walks out in the country, there is nobody to keep him from walking in again: but if a man walks out in London, he is not ſure when he ſhall walk in again. A great city is, to be ſure, the ſchool for ſtudying life; and 'The proper ſtudy of mankind is man,' as Pope obſerves."</q> BOSWELL.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0548300102:207" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"I fancy London is the beſt place in the world for ſociety; though I have  heard that the very firſt ſociety of Paris is ſtill beyond any thing that we have here."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I queſtion if in Paris ſuch a company as is ſitting round this table could be got together in leſs than half a year. They talk in France of the felicity, of men and women living together: the truth is, that there the men are not higher than the women, they know no more than women do, and they are not held down in their converſation by the preſence of women."</q> RAMSAY. <q rend="inline">"Literature is upon the growth, it is in its ſpring in France. Here it is rather <hi>paſſee.</hi>"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Literature was in France long before we had it. Paris was the ſecond city for the revival of letters: Italy had it firſt, to be ſure. What have we done for literature, equal to what was done by the Stephani and others in France. Our literature came to us through France. Caxton printed only two books, Chaucer and Gower, that were not tranſlations from the French; and Chaucer, we know, took much from the Italians. No, Sir, if literature be in its ſpring in France, it is a ſecond ſpring; it is after a winter. We are now before the French in literature; but we had it long after them. In England, any man who wears a ſword and a powdered wig is aſhamed to be illiterate. I believe it is not ſo in France. Yet there is, probably, a great deal of learning in France, becauſe they have ſuch a number of religious eſtabliſhments; ſo many men who have nothing elſe to do but to ſtudy. I do not know this; but I take it upon the common principles of chance. Where there are many ſhooters, ſome will hit."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of old age. Johnſon (now in his ſeventieth year) ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is a man's own fault, it is from want of uſe, if his mind grows torpid in old age."</q> The Biſhop aſked, if an old man does not loſe faſter than he gets. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I think not, my Lord, if he exerts himſelf."</q> One of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany raſhly obſerved, that he thought it was happy for an old man that inſenſibility comes upon him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> JOHNSON. (with a noble elevation and diſdain) <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, I ſhould never be happy by being leſs rational."</q> BISHOP OF ST.

               </p>
               <p>His Lordſhip mentioned a charitable eſtabliſhment in Wales, where people were maintained, and ſupplied with every thing, upon the condition of their contributing the weekly produce of their labour; and he ſaid, they grew quite torpid for want of property. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"They have no object for hope. Their condition cannot be better. It is rowing without a port."</q>
               </p>
               <p>One of the company aſked him the meaning of the expreſſion in Juvenal, <hi>unius lacertae.</hi> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I think it clear enough; as much ground as one may have a chance to find a lizard upon."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:0548300102:208" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Commentators have differed as to the exact meaning of the expreſſion by which the Poet intended to enſorce the ſentiment contained in the paſſage where theſe words occur. It is enough that they mean to denote even a very ſmall poſſeſſion, provided it be a man's own.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"Eſt aliquid quocunque loco quocunque receſſu,</l>
                  <l>"Unius ſeſe dominum feciſſe lacertae."</l>
               </q>
               <p>This ſeaſon there was a whimſical faſhion in the newſpapers of applying Shakſpeare's words to deſcribe living people well known in the world; which was done under the title of <q rend="inline">"Modern Characters from Shakſpeare;"</q> many of which were admirably adapted. The fancy took ſo much, that they were afterwards collected into a pamphlet. Somebody ſaid to Johnſon, acroſs the table, that he had not been in thoſe characters. <q rend="inline">"Yes (ſaid he) I have. I ſhould have been ſorry to be left out."</q> He then repeated what had been applied to him,
<q>
                     <l>"I muſt borrow GARAGANTUA'S mouth."</l>
                  </q>
Miſs Reynolds not perceiving at once the meaning of this, he was obliged to explain it to her, which had ſomething of an aukward and ludicrous effect. <q rend="inline">"Why, Madam, it has a reference to me as uſing big words, which require the mouth of a giant to pronounce them. Garagantua is the name of a giant in Rabelais."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, there is another amongſt them for you:
<q>
                        <l>'He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,</l>
                        <l>'Or Jove for his power to thunder."</l>
                     </q>
                  </q>
JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"There is nothing marked in that. No, Sir, Garagantua is the beſt."</q> Notwithſtanding this eaſe and good humour, when I, a little while afterwards, repeated his farcaſm on Kenrick <note n="3" place="bottom">See p. 271 of Vol. I.</note>, which was received with applauſe, he aſked, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Who</hi> ſaid that?"</q> and on my ſuddenly anſwering, <hi>Garagantua,</hi> he looked ſerious, which was a ſufficient indication that he did not wiſh it to be kept up.</p>
               <p>When we went to the drawing-room there was a rich aſſemblage. Beſides the company who had been at dinner, there were Mr. Garrick, Mr. Harris of Saliſbury, Dr. Percy, Dr. Burney, Honourable Mrs. Cholmondeley, Miſs Hannah More, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
               <p>After wandering about in a kind of pleaſing diſtraction for ſome time, I got into a corner, with Johnſon, Garrick, and Harris. GARRICK. (to Harris)
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0548300102:209" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, have you read Potter's Aeſchylus?"</q> HARRIS. <q rend="inline">"Yes; and  think it pretty."</q> GARRICK. (to Johnſon) <q rend="inline">"And what think you, Sir, of it?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I thought what I read of it <hi>verbiage:</hi> but upon Mr. Harris's recommendation I will read a play. (To Mr. Harris.) Don't pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe two."</q> Mr. Harris ſuggeſted one, I do not remember which. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"We muſt try its effect as an Engliſh poem; that is the way to judge of the merit of a tranſlation. Tranſlations are, in general, for people who cannot read the original."</q> I mentioned the vulgar ſaying, that Pope's Homer was not a good repreſentation of the original. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is the greateſt work of the kind that has ever been produced."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"The truth is, it is impoſſible perfectly to tranſlate poetry. In a different language it may be the ſame tune, but it has not the ſame tone. Homer plays it on a baſſoon; Pope on a flagelet."</q> HARRIS. <q rend="inline">"I think heroick poetry is beſt in blank verſe; yet it appears that rhyme is eſſential to Engliſh poetry, from our deficiency in metrical quantities. In my opinion, the chief excellence of our language is numerous proſe."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir William Temple was the firſt writer who gave cadence to Engliſh proſe. Before his time they were careleſs of arrangement, and did not mind whether a ſentence ended with an important word or an inſignificant word, or with what part of ſpeech it was concluded."</q> Mr. Langton, who now had joined us, commended Clarendon. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He is objected to for his parentheſes, his involved clauſes, and his want of harmony. But he is ſupported by his matter. It is, indeed, owing to a plethory of matter that his ſtyle is ſo faulty. Every <hi>ſubſtance</hi> (ſmiling to Mr. Harris) has ſo many <hi>accidents.</hi>—To be diſtinct, we muſt talk <hi>analytically.</hi> If we analyſe language, we muſt ſpeak of it grammatically; if we analyſe argument, we muſt ſpeak of it logically."</q> GARRICK. <q rend="inline">"Of all the tranſlations that ever were attempted, I think Elphinſton's Martial the moſt extraordinary. He conſulted me upon it, who am a little of an epigrammatiſt myſelf you know. I told him freely, 'You don't ſeem to have that turn.' I aſked him if he was ſerious; and finding he was, I adviſed him againſt publiſhing. Why his tranſlation is more difficult to underſtand than the original. I thought him a man of ſome talents; but he ſeems crazy in this."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you have done what I had not courage to do. But he did not aſk my advice, and I did not force it upon him to make him angry with me."</q> GARRICK. <q rend="inline">"But as a friend, Sir—"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why ſuch a friend as I am with him—no."</q> GARRICK. <q rend="inline">"But if you ſee a friend going to tumble over a precipice?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That is an extravagant caſe, Sir. You are ſure a friend will thank you for hindering him from tumbling over a precipice:
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0548300102:210" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 but, in the other caſe, I ſhould hurt his vanity, and do him no good. He would not take my advice. His brother-in-law, Strahan, ſent him a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of fifty pounds, and ſaid he would ſend him fifty more, if he would not publiſh."</q> GARRICK. <q rend="inline">"What! eh! is Strahan a good judge of an Epigram? Is not he rather an <hi>obtuſe</hi> man, eh?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, he may not be a judge of an Epigram: but you ſee he is a judge of what is <hi>not</hi> an Epigram."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"It is eaſy for you, Mr. Garrick, to talk to an authour as you talked to Elphinſton: you, who have been ſo long the manager of a theatre, rejecting the plays of poor authours. You are an old Judge, who have often pronounced ſentence of death. You are a practiſed ſurgeon, who have often amputated limbs; and though this may have been for the good of your patients, they cannot like you. Thoſe who have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone a dreadful operation are not very fond of ſeeing the operator again."</q> GARRICK. <q rend="inline">"Yes, I know enough of that. There was a reverend gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man (Mr. Hawkins) who wrote a tragedy, the ſiege of ſomething, which I refuſed."</q> HARRIS. <q rend="inline">"So the ſiege was raiſed."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Aye, he came to me and complained; and told me, that Garrick ſaid his play was wrong in the <hi>concoction.</hi> Now, what is the concoction of a play?"</q> (Here Garrick ſtarted, and twiſted himſelf, and ſeemed ſorely vexed; for Johnſon told me he believed the ſtory was true.) GARRICK. <q rend="inline">"I—I—I—ſaid <hi>firſt</hi> concoction.</q> JOHNSON. (ſmiling) <q rend="inline">"Well, he left out <hi>firſt.</hi> And Rich, he ſaid, refuſed him <hi>in falſe Engliſh:</hi> he could ſhew it under his hand."</q> GARRICK. <q rend="inline">"He wrote to me in violent wrath for having refuſed his play: 'Sir, this is growing a very ſerious and terrible affair. I am reſolved to publiſh my play. I will appeal to the world; and how will your judgement appear?' I anſwered, 'Sir, notwithſtanding all the ſeriouſneſs, and all the terrours, I have no objection to your publiſhing your play; and as you live at a great diſtance, (Devonſhire, I believe,) if you will ſend me it, I will convey it to the preſs.' I never heard more of it, ha! ha! ha!"</q>

               <p>On Friday, April 10, I found Johnſon at home in the forenoon. We reſumed the converſation of yeſterday. He put me in mind of ſome of it which had eſcaped my memory, and enabled me to record it more perfectly than I otherwiſe could have done. He was much pleaſed with my paying ſo great attention to his recommendation in 1763, the beginning of our acquaintance, to keep a journal; and I could perceive he was ſecretly pleaſed to find ſo much of the fruit of his mind preſerved; and as he had been uſed to imagine and ſay that he always laboured when he ſaid a good thing—it
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0548300102:211" rendition="simple:additions"/>
delighted him, on a review, to find that his converſation teemed with  point and imagery.</p>
               <p>I ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"You were yeſterday, Sir, in remarkably good humour: but there was nothing to offend you, nothing to produce irritation or violence. There was no bold offender. There was not one capital conviction. It was a maiden aſſize. You had on your white gloves."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He found fault with our friend Langton for having been too ſilent. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid I,) you will recollect, that he very properly took up Sir Joſhua for being glad that Charles Fox had praiſed Goldſmith's 'Traveller,' and you joined him."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, I knocked Fox on the head, without cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony. Reynolds is too much under Fox and Burke at preſent. He is under the <hi>Fox ſtar</hi> and the <hi>Iriſh conſtellation.</hi> He is always under ſome planet."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"There is no Fox ſtar."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But there is a dog ſtar."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"They ſay, indeed, a fox and a dog are the ſame animal."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I reminded him of a gentleman who, Mrs. Cholmondeley ſaid, was firſt talkative from affectation, and then ſilent from the ſame cauſe; that he firſt thought, <q rend="inline">"I ſhall be celebrated as the livelieſt man in every company;"</q> and then, all at once, <q rend="inline">"O! it is much more reſpectable to be grave and look wiſe."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"He has reverſed the Pythagorean diſcipline, by being firſt talkative, and then ſilent. He reverſes the courſe of Nature too: he was firſt the gay butterfly, and then the creeping worm."</q> Johnſon laughed loud and long at this expanſion and illuſtration of what he himſelf had told me.</p>
               <p>We dined together with Mr. Scott (now Sir William Scott, his Majeſty's Advocate) at his chambers in the Temple, nobody elſe there. The company being ſmall, Johnſon was not in ſuch ſpirits as he had been yeſterday, and for a conſiderable time little was ſaid. At laſt he burſt forth, <q rend="inline">"Subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is ſadly broken down in this age. No man, now, has the ſame authority which his father had—except a gaoler. No maſter has it over his ſervants: it is diminiſhed in our colleges; nay, in our grammar-ſchools."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"What is the cauſe of this, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why the coming in of the Scotch."</q> (laughing ſarcaſtically). BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"That is to ſay, things have been turned topſy turvey.—But your ſerious cauſe."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, there are many cauſes, the chief of which is, I think, the great increaſe of money. No man now depends upon the Lord of a Manour, when he can ſend to another country, and fetch proviſions. The ſhoe-black at the entry of my court does not depend on me. I can deprive him but of a penny a day, which he hopes ſomebody elſe will bring him; and that penny I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> carry to another ſhoe-black, ſo the trade ſuffers nothing. I have explained,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0548300102:212" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 in my 'Journey to the Hebrides,' how gold and ſilver deſtroy ſedual ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. But, beſides, there is a general relaxation of reverence. No ſon now depends upon his father as in former times. Paternity uſed to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as of itſelf a great thing, which had a right to many claims. That is, in general, reduced to very ſmall bounds. My hope is, that as anarchy produces tyranny, this extreme relaxation will produce <hi>freni ſtrictio.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of fame, for which there is ſo great a deſire, I obſerved how little there is of it in reality, compared with the other objects of human attention. <q rend="inline">"Let every man recollect, and he will be ſenſible how ſmall a part of his time is employed in talking or thinking of Shakſpeare, Voltaire, or any of the moſt celebrated men that have ever lived, or are now ſuppoſed to occupy the attention and admiration of the world. Let this be extracted and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed; into what a narrow ſpace will it go!"</q> I then ſlily introduced Mr. Garrick's fame, and his aſſuming the airs of a great man. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is wonderful how <hi>little</hi> Garrick aſſumes. No, Sir, Garrick <hi>fortunam reverenter habet.</hi> Conſider, Sir: celebrated men, ſuch as you have mentioned, have had their applauſe at a diſtance; but Garrick had it daſhed in his face, founded in his ears, and went home every night with the plaudits of a thouſand in his <hi>cranium.</hi> Then, Sir, Garrick did not <hi>find,</hi> but <hi>made</hi> his way to the tables, the levees, and almoſt the bed-chambers, of the great. Then, Sir, Garrick had under him a numerous body of people; who, from fear of his power, and hopes of his favour, and admiration of his talents, were conſtantly ſubmiſſive to him. And here is a man who has advanced the dignity of his profeſſion. Garrick has made a player a higher character."</q> SCOTT. <q rend="inline">"And he is a very ſprightly writer too."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; and all this ſupported by great wealth of his own acquiſition. If all this had happened to me, I ſhould have had a couple of fellows with long poles walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before me, to knock down every body that ſtood in the way. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, if all this had happened to Cibber or Quin, they'd have jumped over the moon.—Yet Garrick ſpeaks to <hi>us.</hi>"</q> (ſmiling). BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"And Garrick is a very good man, a charitable man."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, a liberal man. He has given away more money than any man in England. There may be a little vanity mixed: but he has ſhewn, that money is not his firſt object."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yet Foote uſed to ſay of him, that he walked out with an intention to do a generous action; but, turning the corner of a ſtreet, he met with the ghoſt of a halfpenny, which frightened him."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, that is very true, too; for I never knew a man of whom it could be ſaid with leſs certainty to-day, what he will do to-morrow, than Garrick; it depends
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0548300102:213" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſo much on his humour at the time."</q> SCOTT. <q rend="inline">"I am glad to hear of his  liberality. He has been repreſented as very ſaving."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"With his domeſtick ſaving we have nothing to do. I remember drinking tea with him long ago, when Peg Woffington made it, and he grumbled at her for making it too ſtrong <note n="4" place="bottom">When Johnſon told this little anecdote to Sir Joſhua Reynolds, he mentioned a cir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>umſtance which he omitted to-day:—<q rend="inline">"Why (ſaid Garrick) it is as red as blood."</q>
                     </note>. He had then begun to feel money in his purſe, and did not know when he ſhould have enough of it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On the ſubject of wealth, the proper uſe of it, and the effects of that art which is called oeconomy, he obſerved, <q rend="inline">"It is wonderful to think how men of very large eſtates not only ſpend their yearly income, but are often actually in want of money. It is clear, they have not value for what they ſpend. Lord Shelburne told me, that a man of high rank, who looks into his own affairs, may have all that he ought to have, all that can be of any uſe, or appear with any advantage, for five thouſand pounds a year. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a great proportion muſt go in waſte; and, indeed, this is the caſe with moſt people, whatever their fortune is."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I have no doubt, Sir, of this. But how is it? What is waſte?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bottles, and a thouſand other things. Waſte cannot be accurately told, though we are ſenſible how deſtructive it is. Oeconomy on the one hand, by which a certain income is made to maintain a man genteelly, and waſte on the other, by which, on the ſame income, another man lives ſhabbily, cannot be defined. It is a very nice thing: as one man wears his coat out much ſooner than another, we cannot tell how."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of war. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Every man thinks meanly of himſelf for not having been a ſoldier, or not having been at ſea."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Lord Mansfield does not."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, if Lord Mansfield were in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of General Officers and Admirals who have been in ſervice, he would ſhrink; he'd wiſh to creep under the table."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"No; he'd think he could <hi>try</hi> them all."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, if he could catch them: but they'd try him much ſooner. No, Sir; were Socrates and Charles the Twelfth of Sweden both preſent in any company, and Socrates to ſay, 'Follow me, and hear a lecture in philoſophy;' and Charles, laying his hand on his ſword, to ſay, 'Follow me, and dethrone the Czar;' a man would be aſhamed to follow Socrates. Sir, the impreſſion is univerſal: yet it is ſtrange. As to the ſailor, when you look down from the quarter-deck to the ſpa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e below, you ſee the utmoſt extremity of human miſery: ſuch crouding, ſuch filth, ſuch ſtench!"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yet ſailors are happy."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"They
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:0548300102:214" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 are happy as brutes are happy, with a piece of freſh meat, with the groſſeſt ſenſuality. But, Sir, the profeſſion of ſoldiers and ſailors has the dignity of danger. Mankind reverence thoſe who have got over fear, which is ſo general a weakneſs."</q> SCOTT. <q rend="inline">"But is not courage mechanical, and to be acquired?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir, in a collective ſenſe. Soldiers conſider themſelves only as parts of a great machine."</q> SCOTT. <q rend="inline">"We find people fond of being ſailors."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I cannot account for that, any more than I can account for other ſtrange perverſions of imagination."</q>
               </p>
               <p>His abhorrence of the profeſſion of a ſailor was uniformly violent; but in converſation he always exalted the profeſſion of a ſoldier. And yet I have, in my large and various collection of his writings, a letter to an eminent friend, in which he expreſſes himſelf thus: <q rend="inline">"My god-ſon called on me lately. He is weary, and rationally weary, of a military life. If you can place him in ſome other ſtate, I think you may increaſe his happineſs, and ſecure his virtue. A ſoldier's time is paſſed in diſtreſs and danger, or in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and corruption."</q> Such was his cool reflection in his ſtudy; but when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he was warmed and animated by the preſence of company, he, like other philoſophers, whoſe minds are impregnated with poetical fancy, caught the common enthuſiaſm for ſplendid renown.</p>
               <p>He talked of Mr. Charles Fox, of whoſe abilities he thought highly, but obſerved, that he did not talk much at our club. I have heard Mr. Gibbon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, <q rend="inline">"that Mr. Fox could not be afraid of Dr. Johnſon; yet he certainly was very ſhy of ſaying any thing in Dr. Johnſon's preſence."</q> Mr. Scott now quoted what was ſaid of Alcibiades by a Greek poet, to which Johnſon aſſented.</p>
               <p>He told us, that he had given Mrs. Montagu a catalogue of all Daniel Defoe's works of imagination; moſt, if not all of which, as well as of his other works, he now enumerated, allowing a conſiderable ſhare of merit to a man, who, bred a ſilverſmith, had written ſo variouſly and ſo well. Indeed, his <q rend="inline">"Robinſon Cruſoe"</q> is enough of itſelf to eſtabliſh his reputation.</p>
               <p>He expreſſed great indignation at the impoſture of the Cock-lane Ghoſt, and related, with much ſatisfaction, how he had aſſiſted in detecting the cheat, and had publiſhed an account of it in the newſpapers. Upon this ſubject I incautiouſly offended him, by preſſing him with too many queſtions, and he ſhewed his diſpleaſure. I apologiſed, ſaying that <q rend="inline">"I aſked queſtions in order to be inſtructed and entertained; I repaired eagerly to the fountain; but that the moment he gave me a hint, the moment he put a lock upon the well, I deſiſted."</q>—<q rend="inline">"But, Sir, (ſaid he,) that is forcing one to do a diſagreeable thing:"</q> and he continued to rate me. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, (ſaid I,) when you have
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:0548300102:215" rendition="simple:additions"/>
put a lock upon the well, ſo that I can no longer drink, do not make the  fountain of your wit play upon me and wet me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſometimes could not bear being teazed with queſtions. I was once preſent when a gentleman aſked ſo many, as, <q type="inline_marginal_quotes">"What did you do, Sir? What did you ſay, Sir?"</q> that he at laſt grew enraged, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I will not be put to the <hi>queſtion.</hi> Don't you conſider, Sir, that theſe are not the manners of a gentleman? I will not be baited with <hi>what,</hi> and <hi>why;</hi> what is this? what is that? why is a cow's tail long? why is a fox's tail buſhy?"</q> The gentleman, who was a good deal out of countenance, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, you are ſo good, that I venture to trouble you."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, my being ſo <hi>good</hi> is no reaſon why you ſhould be ſo <hi>ill.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of the Juſtitia hulk at Woolwich, in which criminals were puniſhed, by being confined to labour, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I do not ſee that they are puniſhed by this: they muſt have worked equally had they never been guilty of ſtealing. They now only work; ſo, after all, they have gained; what they ſtole is clear gain to them; the confinement is nothing. Every man who works is confined: the ſmith to his ſhop, the tailor to his garret."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"And Lord Mansfield to his Court."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir. You know the notion of confinement may be extended, as in the ſong, 'Every iſland is a priſon.' There is, in Dodſley's collection, a copy of verſes to the authour of that ſong."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Smith's Latin verſes on Pococke, the great traveller, were mentioned. He repeated ſome of them, and ſaid they were Smith's beſt verſes.</p>
               <p>He talked with an uncommon animation of travelling into diſtant countries; that the mind was enlarged by it, and that an acquiſition of dignity of character was derived from it. He expreſſed a particular enthuſiaſm with reſpect to viſiting the wall of China. I catched it for the moment, and ſaid I really believed I ſhould go and ſee the wall of China had I not children, of whom it was my duty to take care. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) by doing ſo, you would do what would be of importance in raiſing your children to eminence. There would be a luſtre reflected upon them from your ſpirit and curioſity. They would be at all times regarded as the children of a man who had gone to view the wall of China. I am ſerious, Sir."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When we had left Mr. Scott's, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Will you go home with me?"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid I<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) it is late; but I'll go with you for three minutes."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Or <hi>four.</hi>"</q> We went to Mrs. Williams's room, where we found Mr. Allen the printer, who was the landlord of his houſe in Bolt-court, a worthy obliging man, and his very old acquaintance; and what was exceedingly
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0548300102:216" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 amuſing, though he was of a very diminutive ſize, he uſed, even in Johnſon's preſence, to imitate the ſtately periods and ſlow and ſolemn utterance of the great man. I this evening boaſted, that although I did not write what is called ſtenography, or ſhort-hand, in appropriated characters deviſed for the purpoſe, I had a method of my own of writing half words, and leaving out ſome altogether, ſo as yet to keep the ſubſtance and language of any diſcourſe which I heard ſo much in view, that I could give it very completely ſoon after taking it down. He defied me, as he had once defied an actual ſhort-hand writer; and he made the experiment by reading ſlowly and diſtinctly a part of Robertſon's <q rend="inline">"Hiſtory of America,"</q> while I endeavoured to write it in my way of taking notes. It was found that I had it very imperfectly; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from which was, that its excellence was principally owing to a ſtudied arrangement of words, which could not be varied or abridged without an eſſential injury.</p>
               <p>On Sunday, April 12, I found him at home before dinner; Dr. Dodd's poem entitled <q rend="inline">"Thoughts in Priſon,"</q> was lying upon his table. This appearing to me an extraordinary effort by a man who was in Newgate for a capital crime, I was deſirous to hear Johnſon's opinion of it: to my ſurprize, he told me he had not read a line of it. I took up the book and read a paſſage to him. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Pretty well, if you are previouſly diſpoſed to like them."</q> I read another paſſage, with which he was better pleaſed. He then took the book into his own hands, and having looked at the prayer at the end of it, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"What <hi>evidence</hi> is there that this was compoſed the night before he ſuffered. <hi>I</hi> do not believe it."</q> He then read aloud where he prays for the King, &amp;c. and obſerved, <q rend="inline">"Sir, do you think that a man the night before he is to be hanged cares for the ſucceſſion of a royal family? Though he <hi>may</hi> have compoſed this prayer then. A man who has been canting all his life may cant to the laſt. And yet a man who has been refuſed a pardon after ſo much petitioning, would hardly be praying thus ſervently for the King."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He and I, and Mrs. Williams, went to dine with the Reverend Dr. Percy. Talking of Goldſmith, Johnſon ſaid, he was very envious. I defended him, by obſerving that he owned it frankly upon all occaſions. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you are enforcing the charge. He had ſo much envy that he could not conceal it. He was ſo full of it that he overflowed. He talked of it to be ſure often enough. Now, Sir, what a man avows, he is not aſhamed to think; though many a man thinks, what he is aſhamed to avow. We are all envious naturally; but by checking envy we get the better of it. So we are all
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:0548300102:217" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thieves naturally; a child always tries to get at what it wants, the neareſt  way; by good inſtruction and good habits this is cured, till a man has not even an inclination to ſeize what is another's; has no ſtruggle with himſelf about it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>And here I ſhall record a ſcene of too much heat between Dr. Johnſon and Dr. Percy, which I ſhould have ſuppreſſed, were it not that it gave occaſion to diſplay the truely tender and benevolent heart of Johnſon, who as ſoon as he found a friend was at all hurt by any thing which he had <q rend="inline">"ſaid in his wrath,"</q> was not only prompt and deſirous to be reconciled, but exerted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to make ample reparation.</p>
               <p>Books of Travels having been mentioned, Johnſon praiſed Pennant very highly, as he did at Dunvegan, in the Iſle of Sky <note n="5" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</q> edit. 3. p. 221.</note>. Dr. Percy ſtill holding himſelf as the heir male of the ancient Percies, and having the warmeſt and moſt dutiful attachment to the noble houſe of Northumberland, could not ſit quietly and hear a man praiſed, who had ſpoken diſreſpectfully of Alnwick-Caſtle and the Duke's pleaſure-grounds, eſpecially as he thought meanly of his travels. He therefore oppoſed Johnſon eagerly. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Pennant in what he has ſaid of Alnwick, has done what he intended; he has made you very angry."</q> PERCY. <q rend="inline">"He has ſaid the garden is <hi>trim,</hi> which is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it like a citizen's parterre, when the truth is, there is a very large extent of fine turf and gravel walks."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"According to your own account, Sir, Pennant is right. It <hi>is</hi> trim. Here is graſs cut cloſe, and gravel rolled ſmooth. Is not that trim? The extent is nothing againſt that; a mile may be as trim as a ſquare yard. Your extent puts me in mind of the citizens' enlarged dinner, two pieces of roaſt-beef, and two puddings. There is no variety, no mind exerted in laying out the ground, no trees."</q> PERCY. <q rend="inline">"He pretends to give the natural hiſtory of Northumberland, and yet takes no notice of the immenſe number of trees planted there of late."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That, Sir, has nothing to do with the <hi>natural</hi> hiſtory; that is <hi>civil</hi> hiſtory. A man who gives the natural hiſtory of the oak, is not to tell how many oaks have been planted in this place or that. A man who gives the natural hiſtory of the cow, is not to tell how many cows are milked at Iſlington. The animal is the ſame, whether milked in the Park or at Iſlington."</q> PERCY. <q rend="inline">"Pennant does not deſcribe well; a carrier who goes along the ſide of Lochlomond would deſcribe it better."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I think he deſcribes very well."</q> PERCY. <q rend="inline">"I travelled after him."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"And I travelled
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0548300102:218" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 after him."</q> PERCY. <q rend="inline">"But, my good friend, you are ſhort-ſighted, and do not ſee ſo well as I do."</q> I wondered at Dr. Percy's venturing thus. Dr. Johnſon ſaid nothing at the time; but inflammable particles were collecting for a cloud to burſt. In a little while Dr. Percy ſaid ſomething more in diſparagement of Pennant. JOHNSON. (pointedly) <q rend="inline">"This is the reſentment of a narrow mind, becauſe he did not find every thing in Northumberland."</q> PERCY. (feeling the ſtroke) <q rend="inline">"Sir, you may be as rude as you pleaſe."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Hold, Sir! Don't talk of rudeneſs; remember, Sir, you told me (puffing hard with paſſion ſtruggling for a vent) I was ſhort-ſighted. We have done with civility. We are to be as rude as we pleaſe."</q> PERCY. <q rend="inline">"Upon my honour, Sir, I did not mean to be uncivil."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay ſo, Sir; for I <hi>did</hi> mean to be uncivil, thinking <hi>you</hi> had been uncivil."</q> Dr. Percy roſe, ran up to him, and taking him by the hand, aſſured him affectionately that his meaning had been miſunderſtood; upon which a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation inſtantly took place. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"My dear Sir, I am willing you ſhall <hi>hang</hi> Pennant."</q> PERCY. (reſuming the former ſubject) <q rend="inline">"Pennant complains that the helmet is not hung out to invite to the hall of hoſpitality. Now I never heard that it was a cuſtom to hand out a <hi>helmet.</hi>"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Hang him up, hang him up."</q> BOSWELL. (humouring the joke) <q rend="inline">"Hang out his ſkull inſtead of a helmet, and you may drink ale out of it in your hall of Odin, as he is your enemy; that will be truly ancient. <hi>There</hi> will be 'Northern Antiquities."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He's a <hi>Whig,</hi> Sir; a <hi>ſad dog</hi> (ſmiling at his own violent expreſſions, merely for <hi>political</hi> difference of opinion). But he's the beſt traveller I ever read; he obſerves more things than any one elſe does."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I could not help thinking that this was too high praiſe of a writer who traverſed a wide extent of country in ſuch haſte, that he could put together only curt frittered fragments of his own, and afterwards procured ſupplemental intelligence from parochial miniſters, and others not the beſt qualified or moſt impartial narrators, whoſe ungenerous prejudice againſt the houſe of Stuart glares in miſrepreſentation; a writer, who at beſt treats merely of ſuperficial objects, and ſhews no philoſophical inveſtigation of character and manners, ſuch as Johnſon has exhibited in his maſterly <q rend="inline">"Journey,"</q> over part of the ſame ground; and who it ſhould ſeem from a deſire of ingratiating himſelf with the Scotch, has flattered the people of North-Britain ſo inordinately and with ſo little diſcrimination, that the judicious and candid amongſt them muſt be diſguſted, while they value more the plain, juſt, yet kindly report of Johnſon.</p>

We had a calm after the ſtorm, ſtaid the evening and ſupt, and were  pleaſant and gay. But Dr. Percy told me he was very uneaſy at what had paſſed; for there was a gentleman there who had recently been admitted into the confidence of the Northumberland family, to whom he hoped to appear more reſpectable, by ſhewing him how intimate he was with the great Dr. Johnſon; and now the gentleman would go away with an impreſſion much to his diſadvantage, as if Johnſon treated him with diſregard, which might do him an eſſential injury. He begged I would mention this to Dr. Johnſon, which I afterwards did. His obſervation upon it was, <q rend="inline">"This comes of <hi>ſtratagem;</hi> had he tole me that he wiſhed to appear to advantage before that gentleman, he ſhould have been at the top of the houſe all the time."</q> He ſpoke of Dr. Percy in the handſomeſt terms. <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, (ſaid I,) may I be allowed to ſuggeſt a mode by which you may effectually counteract any unfavourable report of what paſſed. I will write a letter to you upon the ſubject of the unlucky conteſt of that day, and you will be kind enough to put in writing as an anſwer to that letter, what you have now ſaid, and in ſhort all that you can ſay to Dr. Percy's advantage; and as Lord Percy is to dine with us at General Paoli's ſoon, I will take an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to read the correſpondence in his Lordſhip's preſence.</q> This friendly ſcheme was accordingly carried into execution without Dr. Percy's know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. Johnſon's letter was ſtudiouſly framed to place Dr. Percy's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable merit in the faireſt point of view; and I contrived that Lord Percy ſhould hear the correſpondence, by introducing it at General Paoli's, as an inſtance of Dr. Johnſon's kind diſpoſition towards one in whom his Lordſhip was intereſted. Thus our friend Percy was raiſed higher in the eſtimation of thoſe by whom he wiſhed moſt to be regarded. I breakfaſted the day after with him, and informed him of my ſcheme, and its happy completion, for which he thanked me in the warmeſt terms, and was highly delighted with Dr. Johnſon's letter in his praiſe, of which I gave him a copy. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I would rather have this than degrees from all the Univerſities in Europe. It will be for me, and my children and grand-children."</q> Dr. Johnſon having afterwards aſked me if I had given him a copy of it, and being told I had, was offended, and inſiſted that I ſhould get it back, which I did. As, however, he did not deſire me to deſtroy either the original or the copy, or forbid me to let it be ſeen, I think myſelf at liberty to apply to it his general declaration to me concerning his other letters, <q rend="inline">"That he did not chooſe they ſhould be publiſhed in his life-time; but had no objection to their appearing after his death."</q> I ſhall therefore

 inſert this kindly correſpondence, having faithfully narrated the circumſtances accompanying it.</p>

                     <p>THE debate between Dr. Percy and me is one of thoſe fooliſh controverſies, which begin upon a queſtion of which neither party cares how it is decided, and which is, nevertheleſs, continued to acrimony, by the vanity with which every man reſiſts confutation. Dr. Percy's warmth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from a cauſe which, perhaps, does him more honour than he could
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0548300102:221"/>
have derived from juſter criticiſm. His abhorrence of Pennant proceeded  from his opinion that Pennant had wantonly and indecently cenſured his patron. His anger made him reſolve that for having been once wrong, he never ſhould be right. Pennant has much in his notions that I do not like; but ſtill I think him a very intelligent traveller. If Percy is really offended, I am ſorry; for he is a man whom I never knew to offend any one. He is a man very willing to learn, and very able to teach; a man, out of whoſe company I never go without having learned ſomething. It is ſure that he vexes me ſometimes, but I am afraid it is by making me feel my own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. So much extenſion of mind, and ſo much minute accuracy of enquiry, if you ſurvey your whole circle of acquaintance, you will find ſo ſcarce, if you find it at all, that you will value Percy by compariſon. Lord Hailes is ſomewhat like him: but Lord Hailes does not, perhaps, go beyond him in reſearch; and I do not know that he equals him in elegance. Percy's attention to poetry has given grace and ſplendour to his ſtudies of antiquity. A mere antiquarian is a rugged being.</p>
                     <p>Upon the whole, you ſee that what I might ſay in ſport or petulance to him, is very conſiſtent with full conviction of his merit.</p>

               <p>On Monday, April 13, I dined with Johnſon at Mr. Langton's, where were Dr. Porteus, then Biſhop of Cheſter, now of London, and Dr. Stinton. He

               <p>being well applied to Soame Jennyns; who, after having wandered in the wilds of infidelity, had returned to the Chriſtian faith. Mr. Langton aſked Johnſon as to the propriety of <hi>ſapientiae conſultus.</hi> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Though <hi>conſultus</hi> was primarily an adjective, like <hi>amicus</hi> it came to be uſed as a ſubſtantive. So we have <hi>Juris-conſultus,</hi> a conſult in law."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of the ſtyles of different painters, and how certainly a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeur could diſtinguiſh them. I aſked if there was as clear a difference of ſtyles in language as in painting, or even as in hand-writing, ſo that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of every individual may be diſtinguiſhed? JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes. Thoſe who have a ſtyle of eminent excellence, ſuch as Dryden and Milton, can always be diſtinguiſhed."</q> I had no doubt of this; but what I wanted to know was, whether there was really a peculiar ſtyle to every man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as there is certainly a peculiar hand-writing, a peculiar countenance, not widely different in many, yet always enough to be diſtinctive:
<q>
                     <l>"—Facies non omnibus una</l>
                     <l>"Nec diverſa tamen."—</l>
                  </q>
The Biſhop thought not; and ſaid, he ſuppoſed that many pieces in Dodſley's collection of poems, though all very pretty, had nothing appropriated in their ſtyle, and in that particular could not be at all diſtinguiſhed. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I think every man whatever has a peculiar ſtyle, which may be
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:0548300102:223" rendition="simple:additions"/>
diſcovered by nice examination and compariſon with others: but a man muſt  write a great deal to make his ſtyle obviouſly diſcernable. As logicians ſay, this appropriation of ſtyle is infinite <hi>in poteſtate,</hi> limited <hi>in actu.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Topham Beauclerk came in the evening, and he and Dr. Johnſon and I ſtaid to ſupper. It was mentioned that Dr. Dodd had once wiſhed to be a member of THE LITERARY CLUB. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I ſhould be ſorry if any of our club were hanged. I will not ſay but ſome of them deſerve it <note n="6" place="bottom">See Note, p. 108 of this Volume.</note>."</q> BEAUCLERK. (ſuppoſing this to be aimed at perſons for whom he had at that time a wonderful fancy, which, however, did not laſt long,) was irritated, and eagerly ſaid, <q rend="inline">"You, Sir, have a friend (naming him) who deſerves to be hanged; for he ſpeaks behind their backs againſt thoſe with whom he lives on the beſt terms, and attacks them in the news-papers. <hi>He</hi> certainly ought to be <hi>kicked.</hi>"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, we all do this in ſome degree, <hi>'Veniam petimus damuſque viciſſim.'</hi> To be ſure it may be done ſo much that a man may deſerve to be kicked."</q> BEAUCLERK. <q rend="inline">"He is very malignant."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; he is not malignant. He is miſchievous, if you will. He would do no man an eſſential injury; he may, indeed, love to make ſport of people by vexing their vanity. I, however, once knew an old gentleman who was abſolutely malignant. He really wiſhed evil to others, and rejoiced at it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"The gentleman, Mr. Beauclerk, againſt whom you are ſo violent, is I know, a man of good principles."</q> BEAUCLERK. <q rend="inline">"Then he does not wear them out in practice."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon, who as I have obſerved before, delighted in diſcrimination of character, and having a maſterly knowledge of human nature, was willing to take men as they are, imperfect and with a mixture of good and bad qualities, I ſuppoſe thought he had ſaid enough in defence of his friend; of whoſe merits, notwithſtanding his exceptionable points, he had a juſt value, and added no more on the ſubject.</p>
               <p>On Tueſday, April 14, I dined with him at General Oglethorpe's, with General Paoli and Mr. Langton. General Oglethorpe declaimed againſt luxury.

Men always take the beſt they can get."</q> OGLETHORPE. <q rend="inline">"But the beſt depends much upon ourſelves; and if we can be as well<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſatisfied with plain things, we are in the wrong to accuſtom our palates to what is high-ſeaſoned and expenſive.

                     </q>
Let us us have <hi>that</hi> kind of luxury, Sir, if you will."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But hold, Sir; to be merely ſatisfied is not enough. It is in refinement and elegance that the civilized man differs from the ſavage. A great part of our induſtry, and all our ingenuity is exerciſed in procuring pleaſure; and, Sir, a hungry man has not the ſame pleaſure in eating a plain dinner, that a hungry man has in eating a luxurious dinner. You ſee I put the caſe fairly. A hungry man may have as much, nay, more pleaſure in eating a plain dinner, than a man grown faſtidious has in eating a luxurious dinner. But I ſuppoſe the man who decides between the two dinners, to be equally a hungry man."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of different governments. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"The more contracted that power is, the more eaſily it is deſtroyed. A country governed by a deſpot is an inverted cone. Government there cannot be ſo firm as when it reſts upon a broad baſis gradually contracted, as the government of Great-Britain, which is founded on the parliament, then is in the privy-council, then in the King."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Power when contracted into the perſon of a deſpot may be eaſily deſtroyed, as the prince may be cut off. So Caligula wiſhed that the people of Rome had but one neck, that he might cut them off at a blow."</q> OGLETHORPE. <q rend="inline">"It was of the Senate he wiſhed that. The Senate by its uſurpation controuled both the Emperour and the people. And don't you think that we ſee too much of that in our own parliament?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Johnſon endeavoured to trace the etymology of Maccaronick verſes, which he thought were of Italian invention from Maccaroni; but on being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that this would infer that they were the moſt common and eaſy verſes, maccaroni being the moſt ordinary and ſimple food, he was at a loſs; for he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He rather ſhould have ſuppoſed it to import in its primitive ſignification, a compoſition of ſeveral things; for Maccaronick verſes are verſes made out of a mixture of different languages, that is, of one language with the termination of another."</q> I ſuppoſe there is almoſt no language in any country where there is any learning, in which that motley ludicrous ſpecious of
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:0548300102:225" rendition="simple:additions"/>
compoſition may not be found. It is particularly droll in Low Dutch. The  <q rend="inline">"Polemomiddinia"</q> of Drummond of Hawthornden, in which there is a jumble of many languages moulded, as if it were, all in Latin, is well known. Mr. Langton made us laugh heartily at one in the Grecian mould, by Joſhua Barnes, in which are to be found ſuch comical <hi>Anglo-Elleniſms</hi> as <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. They were banged with clubs.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, April 15, I dined with Dr. Johnſon at Mr. Dilly's, and was in high ſpirits, for I had been a good part of the morning with Mr. Orme, the able and eloquent hiſtorian of Hindoſtan, who expreſſed a high admiration of Johnſon. <q rend="inline">"I do not care (ſaid he,) on what ſubject Johnſon talks; but I love better to hear him talk than any body. He either gives you new thoughts, or a new colouring. It is a ſhame to the nation that he has not been more liberally rewarded. Had I been George the Third, and thought as he did about America, I would have given Johnſon three hundred a year for his 'Taxation no Tyranny' alone."</q> I repeated this, and Johnſon was much pleaſed with ſuch praiſe from ſuch a man as Orme.</p>
               <p>At Mr. Dilly's to-day were Mrs. Knowles, the ingenious Quaker lady <note n="7" place="bottom">Dr. Johnſon, deſcribing her needle-work in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale, Vol. I. p. 326, uſes the learned word <hi>ſutile;</hi> which Mrs. Thrale has miſtaken, and made the phraſe injurious by writing <q rend="inline">"<hi>futile</hi> pictures."</q>
                  </note>, Miſs Seward, the poeteſs of Lichfield, the Rev. Dr. Mayo, and the Rev. Mr. Beresford, Tutor to the Duke of Bedford. Before dinner Dr. Johnſon ſeized upon Mr. Charles Sheridan's <q rend="inline">"Account of the late Revolution in Sweden,"</q> and ſeemed to read it ravenouſly as if he devoured it, which was to all appearance his method of ſtudying. <q rend="inline">"He knows how to read better than any one (ſaid Mrs. Knowles); he gets at the ſubſtance of a book directly; he tears out the heart of it."</q> He kept it wrapt up in the table<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth in his lap during the time of dinner, from an avidity to have one enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment in readineſs when he ſhould have finiſhed another, reſembling (if I may uſe ſo coarſe a ſimile) a dog who holds a bone in his paws in reſerve, while he eats ſomething elſe which has been thrown to him.</p>
               <p>The ſubject of cookery having been very naturally introduced at a table where Johnſon, who boaſted of the niceneſs of his palate, owned that <q rend="inline">"he always found a good dinner,"</q> he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I could write a better book of cookery than has ever yet been written; it ſhould be a book upon philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical principles. Pharmacy is now made much more ſimple. Cookery may be made ſo too. A preſcription which is now compounded of five in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, had formerly fifty in it.

Half the <hi>trade</hi> know this."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir. This ſhews how much better the ſubject of Cookery may be treated by a philoſopher. I doubt if the book be written by Dr. Hill; for, in Mrs. Glaſſe's 'Cookery,' which I have looked into, ſalt-petre and ſal-prunella are ſpoken of as different ſubſtances, whereas ſal-prunella is only ſalt-petre burnt on charcoal, and Hill could not be ignorant of this. However, as the greateſt part of ſuch a book is made by tranſcription, this miſtake may have been careleſsly adopted. But you ſhall ſee what a Book of Cookery I ſhall make! I ſhall agree with Mr. Dilly for the copy-right."</q> MISS SEWARD. <q rend="inline">"That would be Hercules with the diſtaff indeed."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Madam.

               <p>JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"O! Mr. Dilly—you muſt know that an Engliſh Benedictine Monk at Paris has tranſlated 'The Duke of Berwick's Memoirs,' from the original French, and has ſent them to me to ſell. I offered them to Strahan, who ſent them back with this anſwer:—'That the firſt book he had publiſhed was the Duke of Berwick's Life, by which he had loſt; and he hated the name.'—Now I honeſtly tell you, that Strahan has refuſed them; but I alſo honeſtly tell you, that he did it upon no principle, for he never looked into them."</q> DILLY. <q rend="inline">"Are they well tranſlated, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, very well—in a ſtyle very current and very clear. I have written to the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine to give me an anſwer upon two points—What evidence is there that the letters are authentick? For if they are not authentick they are nothing.—And how long will it be before the original French is publiſhed? For if the French edition is not to appear for a conſiderable time, the tranſlation will be almoſt as valuable as an original book. They will make two volumes in octavo; and I have undertaken to correct every ſheet as it comes from the preſs."</q> Mr. Dilly deſired to ſee them, and ſaid he would ſend for them. He aſked Dr. Johnſon if he would write a Preface to them. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir. The Benedictines were very kind to me, and I'll do what I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to do; but I will not mingle my name with them. I am to gain nothing by them. I'll turn them looſe upon the world, and let them take their chance."</q> DR. MAYO. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, are Ganganelli's letters authentick?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir.

Mrs. Knowles affected to complain that men had much more liberty  allowed them than women. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Madam, women have all the liberty they ſhould wiſh to have. We have all the labour and the danger, and the women all the advantage. We go to ſea, we build houſes, we do every thing, in ſhort, to pay our court to the women."</q> MRS. KNOWLES. <q rend="inline">"The Doctor reaſons very wittily, but not convincingly. Now, take the inſtance of building; the maſon's wife, if ſhe is ever ſeen in liquor, is ruined. The maſon may get himſelf drunk as often as he pleaſes, with little loſs of character; nay, may let his wife and children ſtarve."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Madam, you muſt conſider, if the maſon does get himſelf drunk, and let his wife and children ſtarve, the pariſh will oblige him to find ſecurity for their maintenance. We have different modes of reſtraining evil. Stocks for the men, a ducking-ſtool for women, and a pound for beaſts. If we require more perfection from women than from ourſelves, it is doing them honour. And women have not the ſame temptations that we have: they may always live in virtuous company; men muſt mix in the world indiſcriminately. If a woman has no inclination to do what is wrong, being ſecured from it is no reſtraint to her. I am at liberty to walk into the Thames; but if I were to try it, my friends would reſtrain me in Bedlam, and I ſhould be obliged to them."</q> MRS. KNOWLES. <q rend="inline">"Still, Doctor, I cannot help thinking it a hardſhip that more indulgence is allowed to men than to women. It gives a ſuperiority to men, to which I do not ſee how they are entitled."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is plain, Madam, one or other muſt have the ſuperiority. As Shakſpeare ſays, 'If two men ride on horſeback, one muſt ride behind."</q> DILLY. <q rend="inline">"I ſuppoſe, Sir, Mrs. Knowles would have them to ride in panniers, one on each ſide."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, the horſe would throw them both."</q> MRS. KNOWLES. <q rend="inline">"Well, I hope that in another world the ſexes will be equal."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"That is being too ambitious, Madam. <hi>We</hi> might as well deſire to be equal with the angels. We ſhall all, I hope, be happy in a future ſtate, but we muſt not expect to be all happy in the ſame degree. It is enough if we be happy according to our ſeveral capacities.

               <p>Upon this ſubject I had once before ſounded him, by mentioning the late Reverend Mr. Brown, of Utrecht's image; that a great and ſmall glaſs, though equally full, did not hold an equal quantity; which he threw out to refute David Hume's ſaying, that a little miſs, going to dance at a ball, in a

After ſome thought, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I come over to the parſon."</q> As an inſtance of coincidence of thinking, Mr. Dilly told me, that Dr. King, a late diſſenting miniſter in London, ſaid to him, upon the happineſs in a future ſtate of good men of different capacities, <q rend="inline">"A pail does not hold ſo much as a tub; but, if it be equally full, it has no reaſon to complain.

               <p>Dr. Mayo having aſked Johnſon's opinion of Soame Jennyns's <q rend="inline">"View of the internal Evidence of the Chriſtian Religion;"</q>—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I think it a pretty book; not very theological indeed; and there ſeems to be an affectation of eaſe and careleſſneſs, as if it were not ſuitable to his character to be very ſerious about the matter."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"He may have intended this to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce his book the better among genteel people, who might be unwilling to read too grave a treatiſe. There is a general levity in the age. We have phyſicians now with bag-wigs; may we not have airy divines, at leaſt ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what leſs ſolemn in their appearance than they uſed to be?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Jennyns might mean as you ſay."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"<hi>You</hi> ſhould like his book, Mrs. Knowles, as it maintains, as you <hi>friends</hi> do, that courage is not a Chriſtian virtue."</q> MRS. KNOWLES. <q rend="inline">"Yes, indeed, I like him there; but I cannot agree with him, that friendſhip is not a Chriſtian virtue."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Madam, ſtrictly ſpeaking, he is right. All friendſhip is preferring the intereſt of a friend, to the neglect, or, perhaps, againſt the intereſt of others; ſo that an old Greek ſaid, 'He that has <hi>friends</hi> has <hi>no friend.'</hi> Now Chriſtianity recommends univerſal benevolence, to conſider all men as our brethren, which is contrary to the virtue of friendſhip, as deſcribed by the ancient philoſophers. Surely, Madam, your ſect muſt approve of this; for, you call all men <hi>friends.</hi>"</q> MRS. KNOWLES. <q rend="inline">"We are commanded to do good to all men, 'but eſpecially to them who are of the houſehold of Faith."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Well, Madam.

               <p>DR. MAYO.

You may be bound as hard by chains when covered by leather, as when the iron appears. The argument for the moral neceſſity of human actions is always, I obſerve, fortified by ſuppoſing univerſal preſcience to be one of the attributes of the Deity."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You are ſurer that you are free, than you are of preſcience; you are ſurer that you can lift up your finger or not as you pleaſe, than you are of any concluſion from a deduction of reaſoning. But let us conſider a little the objection from preſcience. It is certain I am either to go home to-night or not; that does not prevent my freedom."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"That it is certain you are <hi>either</hi> to go home or not does not, prevent your freedom; becauſe the liberty of choice between the two is compatible with that certainty. But if <hi>one</hi> of theſe events be certain <hi>now,</hi> you have no <hi>future</hi> power of volition.

I own, indeed, there may be more virtue in giving it immediately in charity than in ſpending it in luxury; though there may be a pride in that too."</q> Miſs Seward aſked if this was not Mandeville's doctrine of <q rend="inline">"private vices publick benefits."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"The fallacy of that book is, that Mandeville defines neither vices nor benefits. He reckons among vices every thing that gives pleaſure. He takes the narroweſt ſyſtem of morality, monaſtick morality, which holds pleaſure itſelf to be a vice, ſuch as eating ſalt with our fiſh, becauſe it makes it taſte better; and he reckons wealth as a publick benefit, which is by no means always true. Pleaſure of itſelf is not a vice. Having a garden, which we all know to be perfectly innocent, is a great pleaſure. At the ſame time, in this ſtate of being there are many pleaſures vices, which however are ſo immediately agreeable that we can hardly abſtain from them. The happineſs of Heaven will be, that pleaſure and virtue will be perfectly conſiſtent. Mandeville puts the caſe of a man who gets drunk at an alehouſe; and ſays it is a publick benefit, becauſe ſo much money is got by it to the publick. But it muſt be conſidered, that all the good gained by this, through the gradation of alehouſe-keeper, brewer, maltſter, and farmer, is overbalanced by the evil cauſed to the man and his family by his getting drunk. This is the way to try what is vicious, by aſcertaining whether more evil than good is produced by it upon the whole, which is the caſe in all vice. It may happen that good is produced by vice; but not as vice; for inſtance, a robber may take money from its owner, and give it to one who will make a better uſe of it. Here is good produced; but not by the robbery as robbery, but as tranſlation of property. I read Mandeville forty, or I believe fifty years ago. He did not puzzle me; he opened my views into real life very much. No, it is clear that the happineſs of ſociety depends on virtue. In Sparta theft was allowed by general conſent; theft, therefore, was <hi>there</hi> not a crime,
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0548300102:231" rendition="simple:additions"/>
but then there was no ſecurity; and what a life muſt they have had when  there was no ſecurity. Without truth there muſt be a diſſolution of ſociety. As it is, there is ſo little truth that we are almoſt afraid to truſt our ears; but how ſhould we be, if falſehood were multiplied ten times? Society is held together by communication and information; and I remember this remark of Sir Thomas Brown's, 'Do the devils lie? No; for then Hell could not ſubſiſt."</q>

'This (ſays John) is a proof that a ghoſt knows our thoughts.' Now (laughing) it is not neceſſary to know our thoughts to tell that an attorney will ſometimes do nothing.

               <p>We remained together till it was pretty late. Notwithſtanding occaſional exploſions of violence, we were all delighted upon the whole with Johnſon.

But I always think afterwards I ſhould have done better for myſelf."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I told him that at a gentleman's houſe where there was thought to be ſuch extravagance or bad management, that he was living much beyond his income, his lady had objected to the cutting of a pickled mango, and that I had taken an opportunity to aſk the price of it, and found it was only two ſhillings; ſo here was a very poor ſaving. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, that is the blundering oeconomy of a narrow underſtanding. It is ſtopping one hole in a ſieve."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I expreſſed ſome inclination to publiſh an account of my <hi>Travels</hi> upon the continent of Europe, for which I had a variety of materials collected. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I do not ſay, Sir, you may not publiſh your travels; but I give you my opinion, that you would leſſen yourſelf by it. What can you tell of countries ſo well known as thoſe upon the continent of Europe, which you have viſited?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But I can give an entertaining narrative, with
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:0548300102:235" rendition="simple:additions"/>
many incidents, anecdotes, <hi>jeux d'eſprit,</hi> and remarks, ſo as to make very  pleaſant reading."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, moſt modern travellers in Europe who have publiſhed their travels, have been laughed at: I would not have you added to the number <note n="1" place="bottom">I believe, however<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I ſhall follow my own opinion; for the world has ſhewn a very flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing partiality to my writings, on many occaſions.</note>. The world is now not contented to be merely enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by a traveller's narrative; they want to learn ſomething. Now ſome of my friends aſked me why I did not give ſome account of my travels in France. The reaſon is plain; intelligent readers had ſeen more of France than I had. <hi>You</hi> might have liked my Travels in France, and THE CLUB might have liked them; but upon the whole there would have been more ridicule than good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by them."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I cannot agree with you, Sir. People would like to read what you ſay of any thing. Suppoſe a face has been painted by fifty painters before; ſtill we love to ſee it done by Sir Joſhua."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"True, Sir, but Sir Joſhua cannot paint a face when he has not time to look on it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Sir, a ſketch of any ſort by him is valuable. And, Sir, to talk to you in your own ſtyle (raiſing my voice, and ſhaking my head,) you <hi>ſhould</hi> have given us your Travels in France. I am <hi>ſure</hi> I am right, and <hi>there's an end on't.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſaid to him that it was certainly true as my friend Dempſter had obſerved in his letter to me upon the ſubject, that a great part of what was in his <q rend="inline">"Journey to the Weſtern Iſlands of Scotland,"</q> had been in his mind before he left London. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, yes, Sir, the topicks were; and books of travels will be good in proportion to what a man has previouſly in his mind; his knowing what to obſerve; his power of contraſting one mode of life with another. As the Spaniſh proverb ſays, 'He, who would bring home the wealth of the Indies, muſt carry the wealth of the Indies with him.' So it is in travelling; a man muſt carry knowledge with him if he would bring home knowledge."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"The proverb, I ſuppoſe, Sir, means, he muſt carry a large ſtock with him to trade with."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was a delightful day: as we walked to St. Clement's church, I again remarked that Fleet-ſtreet was the moſt cheerful ſcene in the world. <q rend="inline">"Fleet-ſtreet (ſaid I,) is in my mind more delightful than Tempé."</q> JOHNSON<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                  <q rend="inline">"Aye, Sir; but let it be compared with Mull."</q>
               </p>
               <p>There was a very numerous congregation to-day at St. Clement's church, which Dr. Johnſon ſaid he obſerved with pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="234" facs="tcp:0548300102:236" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 And now I am to give a pretty full account of one of the moſt curious incidents in Johnſon's life, of which he himſelf has made the following minute on this day: <q rend="inline">"In my return from church, I was accoſted by Edwards, an old fellow-collegian, who had not ſeen me ſince 1729. He knew me, and aſked if I remembered one Edwards; I did not at firſt recollect the name, but gradually as we walked along, recovered it, and told him a converſation that had paſſed at an alehouſe between us. My purpoſe is to continue our acquaintance <note n="2" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 16<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was in Butcher-row that this meeting happened. Mr. Edwards, who was a decent-looking elderly man in grey clothes, and a wig of many curls, accoſted Johnſon with familiar confidence, knowing who he was, while Johnſon returned his ſalutation with a courteous formality, as to a ſtranger. But as ſoon as Edwards had brought to his recollection their having been at Pembroke-College together nine-and-thirty years ago, he ſeemed much pleaſed, aſked where he lived, and ſaid he ſhould be glad to ſee him in Bolt-Court. EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"Ah, Sir! we are old men now."</q> JOHNSON. (who never liked to think of being old) <q rend="inline">"Don't let us diſcourage one another."</q> EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"Why Doctor you look ſtout and hearty, I am happy to ſee you ſo; for the news-papers told us you were very ill."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Aye, Sir, they are always telling lies of <hi>us old fellows.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Wiſhing to be preſent at more of ſo ſingular a converſation as that between two fellow collegians, who had lived near forty years in London without ever having chanced to meet, I whiſpered to Mr. Edwards that Dr. Johnſon was going home, and that he had better accompany him now. So Edwards walked along with us, I eagerly aſſiſting to keep up the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation. Mr. Edwards informed Dr. Johnſon that he had practiſed long as a ſolicitor in Chancery, but that he now lived in the country upon a little farm about ſixty acres, juſt by Stevenage in Hertfordſhire, and that he came to London (to Barnard's Inn, No. 6,) generally twice a week. Johnſon appearing to be in a reverie, Mr. Edwards addreſſed himſelf to me, and expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated on the pleaſure of living in the country. BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I have no notion of this, Sir. What you have to entertain you, is, I think, exhauſted in half an hour."</q> EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"What! don't you love to have hope realiſed? I ſee my graſs, and my corn, and my trees growing. Now, for inſtance, I am curious to ſee if this froſt has not nipped my fruit trees."</q> JOHNSON. (who we did not imagine was attending) <q rend="inline">"You find, Sir, you have fears as well as hopes."</q>—So well did he ſee the whole, when another ſaw but the half of a ſubject.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="235" facs="tcp:0548300102:237" rendition="simple:additions"/>
When we got to Dr. Johnſon's houſe, and were ſeated in his library, the  dialogue went on admirably. EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I remember you would not let us ſay <hi>prodigious</hi> at College. For even then, Sir, (turning to me,) he was delicate in language, and we all feared him <note n="2" place="bottom">Johnſon ſaid to me afterwards, <q rend="inline">"Sir, they reſpected me for my literature; and yet it was not great but by compariſon. Sir, it is amazing how little literature there is in the world."</q>
                     </note>."</q> JOHNSON. (to Edwards) <q rend="inline">"From your having practiſed the law long, Sir, I preſume you muſt be rich."</q> EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, I got a good deal of money; but I had a number of poor relations to whom I gave a great part of it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you have been rich in the moſt valuable ſenſe of the word."</q> EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"But I ſhall not die rich."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, ſure, Sir, it is better to <hi>live</hi> rich than to <hi>die</hi> rich."</q> EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"I wiſh I had continued at College."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why do you wiſh that, Sir?"</q> EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"Becauſe I think I ſhould have had a much eaſier life than mine has been. I ſhould have been a parſon, and had a good living, like Bloxam and ſeveral others, and lived comfortably."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, the life of a parſon, of a conſcientious clergyman, is not eaſy. I have always conſidered a clergyman as the father of a larger family than he is able to maintain. I would rather have Chancery ſuits upon my hands than the cure of ſouls. No, Sir, I do not envy a clergyman's life as an eaſy life, nor do I envy the clergyman who makes it an eaſy life."</q>—Here taking himſelf up all of a ſudden, he exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"O! Mr. Edwards! I'll convince you that I recollect you. Do you remember our drinking together at an alehouſe near Pembroke gate. At that time you told me of the Eton boy, who, when verſes on our SAVIOUR'S turning water into wine were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed as an exerciſe, brought up a ſingle line, which was highly admired:
<q>
                        <l>'Vidit et erubuit lympha pudica <hi>DEUM.'</hi>
                        </l>
                     </q>
and I told you of another fine line in 'Camden's Remains,' an eulogy upon one of our Kings, who was ſucceeded by his ſon, a prince of equal merit:
<q>
                        <l>'Mira cano, Sol occubuit, nox nulla ſecuta eſt."</l>
                     </q>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"You are a philoſopher, Dr. Johnſon. I have tried too in my time to be a philoſopher; but, I don't know how, cheerfulneſs was always breaking in."</q>—Mr. Burke, Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Mr. Courtenay, Mr. Malone, and, indeed, all the eminent men to whom I have mentioned this, have thought it an exquiſite trait of character. The truth is, that philoſophy,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:0548300102:238" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 like religion, is too generally ſuppoſed to be hard and ſevere, at leaſt ſo grave as to exclude all gaiety.</p>
               <p>EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"I have been twice married, Doctor. You, I ſuppoſe, have never known what it was to have a wife."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I have known what it was to have a wife, and (in a ſolemn tender faultering tone) I have known what it was to <hi>loſe a wife.</hi>—It had almoſt broke my heart."</q>
               </p>
               <p>EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"How do you live, Sir? For my part, I muſt have my regular meals, and a glaſs of good wine. I find I require it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I now drink no wine, Sir. Early in life I drank wine: for many years I drank none. I then for ſome years drank a great deal."</q> EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"Some hogſheads, I warrant you."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I then had a ſevere illneſs, and left it off, and I have never begun it again. I never felt any difference upon myſelf from eating one thing rather than another, nor from one kind of weather rather than another. There are people, I believe, who feel a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference; but I am not one of them. And as to regular meals, I have faſted from the Sunday's dinner to the Tueſday's dinner, without any inconvenience. I believe it is beſt to eat juſt as one is hungry; but a man who is in buſineſs, or a man who has a family, muſt have ſtated meals. I am a ſtraggler. I may leave this town and go to Grand Cairo, without being miſſed here or obſerved there."</q> EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"Don't you eat ſupper, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir."</q> EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"For my part now, I conſider ſupper as a turnpike through which one muſt paſs, in order to get to bed <note n="3" place="bottom">I am not abſolutely ſure but this was my own ſuggeſtion, though it is truly in the character of Edwards.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You are a lawyer, Mr. Edwards. Lawyers know life practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. A bookiſh man ſhould always have them to converſe with. They have what he wants."</q> EDWARDS. <q rend="inline">"I am grown old: I am ſixty-five."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I ſhall be ſixty-eight next birth-day. Come, Sir, drink water, and put in for a hundred."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Edwards mentioned a gentleman who had left his whole fortune to Pembroke College. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Whether to leave one's whole fortune to a College be right, muſt depend upon circumſtances. I would leave the intereſt of the fortune I bequeathed to a College to my relations or my friends, for their lives. It is the ſame thing to a College, which is a perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſociety, whether it gets the money now or twenty years hence; and I would wiſh to make my relations or friends feel the benefit of it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="237" facs="tcp:0548300102:239" rendition="simple:additions"/>
This interview confirmed my opinion of Johnſon's moſt humane and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent  heart. His cordial and placid behaviour to an old fellow-collegian, a man ſo different from himſelf; and his telling him that he would go down to his farm and viſit him, ſhewed a kindlineſs of diſpoſition very rare at an advanced age. He obſerved, <q rend="inline">"how wonderful it was that they had both been in London almoſt forty years, without having ever once met, and both walkers in the ſtreet too!"</q> Mr. Edwards, when going away, again recurred to his conſciouſneſs of ſenility, and looking full in Johnſon's face, ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"You'll find in Dr. Young,
<q>
                        <l>'O my coevals! remnants of yourſelves."</l>
                     </q>
                  </q>
Johnſon did not reliſh this at all; but ſhook his head with impatience. Edwards walked off, ſeemingly highly pleaſed with the honour of having been thus noticed by Dr. Johnſon. When he was gone, I ſaid to Johnſon, that I thought him but a weak man. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, yes, Sir. Here is a man who has paſſed through life without experience: yet I would rather have him with me than a more ſenſible man who will not talk readily. This man is always willing to ſay what he has to ſay."</q> Yet Dr. Johnſon had himſelf by no means that willingneſs which he praiſed ſo much, and I think ſo juſtly; for who has not felt the painful effect of the dreary void, when there is a total ſilence in a company for any length of time; or, which is as bad, or perhaps worſe, when the converſation is with difficulty kept up by a perpetual effort?</p>
               <p>Johnſon once obſerved to me, <q rend="inline">"Tom Tyers deſcribed me the beſt: 'Sir, (ſaid he,) you are like a ghoſt: you never ſpeak till you are ſpoken to."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The gentleman whom he thus familiarly mentioned was Mr. Thomas Tyers, ſon of Mr. Jonathan Tyers, the founder of that excellent place of publick amuſement, Vauxhall Gardens, which muſt ever be an eſtate to its proprietor, as it is peculiarly adapted to the taſte of the Engliſh nation; there being a mixture of curious ſhew—gay exhibition—muſick, vocal and inſtrumental, not too refined for the general ear—for all which only a ſhilling is paid—and, though laſt not leaſt, good eating and drinking for thoſe who chooſe to purchaſe that regale. Mr. Thomas Tyers was bred to the law; but having a handſome fortune, vivacity of temper, and eccentricity of mind, he could not confine himſelf to the regularity of practice. He therefore ran about the world with a pleaſant careleſſneſs, amuſing every body by his deſultory converſation. He abounded in anecdote, but was not ſufficiently attentive to accuracy. I therefore cannot
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:0548300102:240" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 venture to avail myſelf much of a biographical ſketch of Johnſon which he publiſhed, being one among the various perſons ambitious of appending their names to that of my illuſtrious friend. That ſketch is, however, an enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining little collection of fragments. Thoſe which he publiſhed of Pope and Addiſon are of higher merit; but his fame muſt chiefly reſt upon his <q rend="inline">"Political Conferences,"</q> in which he introduces ſeveral eminent perſons delivering their ſentiments in the way of dialogue, and diſcovers a conſiderable ſhare of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, various knowledge, and diſcernment of character. This much may I be allowed to ſay of a man who was exceedingly obliging to me, and who lived with Dr. Johnſon in as eaſy a manner as almoſt any of his very numerous acquaintance.</p>
               <p>Mr. Edwards had ſaid to me aſide, that Dr. Johnſon ſhould have been of a profeſſion. I repeated the remark to Johnſon that I might have his own thoughts on the ſubject. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it <hi>would</hi> have been better that I had been of a profeſſion. I ought to have been a lawyer."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I do not think, Sir, it would have been better, for we ſhould not have had the Engliſh Dictionary."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But you would have had Reports."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Aye; but there would not have been another who could have written the Dictionary. There have been many very good Judges. Suppoſe you had been Lord Chancellor; you would have delivered opinions with more extent of mind, and in a more ornamented manner, than perhaps any Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor ever did, or ever will do. But, I believe, cauſes have been as judiciouſly decided as you could have done."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir. Property has been as well ſettled."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon, however, had a noble ambition floating in his mind, and had, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, often ſpeculated on the poſſibility of his ſupereminent powers being rewarded in this great and liberal country by the higheſt honours of the ſtate. Sir William Scott informs me, that upon the death of the late Lord Lichfield, who was Chancellor of the Univerſity of Oxford, he ſaid to Johnſon, <q rend="inline">"What a pity it is, Sir, that you did not follow the profeſſion of the law. You might have been Lord Chancellor of Great-Britain, and attained to the dignity of the peerage; and now that the title of Lichfield, your native city, is extinct, you might have had it."</q> Johnſon, upon this, ſeemed much agitated; and, in an angry tone, exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Why will you vex me by ſuggeſting this, when it is too late?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>But he did not repine at the proſperity of others. The late Dr. Thomas Leland told Mr. Courtenay, that when Mr. Edmund Burke ſhewed Johnſon his fine houſe and lands near Beaconsfield, Johnſon coolly ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Non equidem invideo; miror magis."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:0548300102:241" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Yet no man had a higher notion of the dignity of literature than Johnſon,  or was more determined in maintaining the reſpect which he juſtly conſidered as due to it. Of this, beſides the general tenor of his conduct in ſociety, ſome characteriſtical inſtances may be mentioned.</p>
               <p>He told Sir Joſhua Reynolds, that once when he dined in a numerous company of bookſellers, where the room being ſmall, the head of the table, at which he ſat, was almoſt cloſe to the fire, he perſevered in ſuffering a great deal of inconvenience from the heat, rather than quit his place, and let one of them ſit above him.</p>
               <p>Goldſmith, in his diverting ſimplicity, complained one day, in a mixed company, of Lord Camden. <q rend="inline">"I met him (ſaid he) at Lord Clare's houſe in the country, and he took no more notice of me than if I had been an ordinary man."</q> The company having laughed heartily, Johnſon ſtood forth in defence of his friend. <q rend="inline">"Nay, gentlemen, (ſaid he,) Dr. Goldſmith is in the right. A nobleman ought to have made up to ſuch a man as Goldſmith; and I think it is much againſt Lord Camden that he neglected him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nor could he patiently endure to hear that ſuch reſpect as he thought due only to higher intellectual qualities, ſhould be beſtowed on men of ſlighter, though perhaps more amuſing talents. I told him, that one morning, when I went to breakfaſt with Garrick, who was very vain of his intimacy with Lord Camden, he accoſted me thus:—<q rend="inline">"Pray now, did you?—did you meet a little lawyer turning the corner, eh?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"No, Sir (ſaid I). Pray what do you mean by the queſtion?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Why, (replied Garrick, with an affected indifference, yet as if ſtanding on tip-toe,) Lord Camden has this moment left me. We have had a long walk together."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, Garrick talked very properly. Lord Camden <hi>was</hi> a little lawyer to be aſſociating ſo familiarly with a player."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sir Joſhua Reynolds has obſerved, with great truth, that Johnſon conſidered Garrick to be as it were his <hi>property.</hi> He would allow no man either to blame or to praiſe Garrick in his preſence, without contradicting him.</p>
               <p>Having fallen into a very ſerious frame, in which mutual expreſſions of kindneſs paſſed between us, ſuch as would be thought too vain in me to repeat, I talked with regret of the ſad inevitable certainty that one of us muſt ſurvive the other. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, that is an affecting conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. I remember Swift, in one of his letters to Pope, ſays, 'I intend to come over, that we may meet once more; and when we muſt part, it is what happens to all human beings."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"The hope that we ſhall ſee our departed friends again muſt ſupport the mind."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"There is a ſtrange unwillingneſs to part with life, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:0548300102:242" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 of ſerious fears as to futurity. A reverend friend of ours (naming him) tells me, that he feels an uneaſineſs at the thoughts of leaving his houſe, his ſtudy, his books."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"This is fooliſh in *****. A man need not be uneaſy on theſe grounds; for, as he will retain his conſciouſneſs, he may ſay with the philoſopher, <hi>Omnia mea mecum porto.</hi>"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"True, Sir: we may carry our books in our head; but ſtill there is ſomething painful in the thought of leaving for ever what has given us pleaſure. I remember many years ago, when my imagination was warm, and I happened to be in a melancholy mood, it diſtreſſed me to think of going into a ſtate of being in which Shakſpeare's poetry did not exiſt. A lady whom I then much admired, a very amiable woman, humoured my fancy, and relieved me by ſaying, 'The firſt thing you will meet in the other world, will be an elegant copy of Shakſpeare's works preſented to you."</q> Dr. Johnſon ſmiled benignantly at this, and did not appear to diſapprove of the notion.</p>
               <p>We went to St. Clement's church again in the afternoon, and then returned and drank tea and coffee in Mrs. Williams's room; Mrs. Deſmoulins doing the honours of the tea-table. I obſerved that he would not even look at a proof-ſheet of his <q rend="inline">"Life of Waller"</q> on Good-Friday.</p>
               <p>Mr. Allen, the printer, brought a book on agriculture, which was printed, and was ſoon to be publiſhed. It was a very ſtrange performance, the authour having mixed in it his own thoughts upon various topicks, along with his remarks on ploughing, ſowing, and other farming operations. He ſeemed to be an abſurd profane fellow, and had introduced in his book many ſneers at religion, with equal ignorance and conceit. Dr. Johnſon permitted me to read ſome paſſages aloud. One was, that he reſolved to work on Sunday, and did work, but he owned he felt <hi>ſome</hi> weak compunction; and he had this very curious reflection:—<q rend="inline">"I was born in the wilds of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, and the briars and thorns ſtill hang about me."</q> Dr. Johnſon could not help laughing at this ridiculous image, yet was very angry at the fellow's impiety. <q rend="inline">"However, (ſaid he,) the Reviewers will make him hang himſelf."</q> He however obſerved, <q rend="inline">"that formerly there might have been a diſpenſation obtained for working on Sunday in the time of harveſt."</q> Indeed in ritual obſervances, were all the miniſters of religion what they ſhould be, and what many of them are, ſuch a power might be wiſely and ſafely lodged with the Church.</p>
               <p>On Saturday, April 14, I drank tea with him. He praiſed the late Mr. Duncombe, of Canterbury, as a pleaſing man. <q rend="inline">"He uſed to come to me: I did not ſeek much after <hi>him.</hi> Indeed I never ſought much after any body."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Lord Orrery, I ſuppoſe."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, I never went
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:0548300102:243" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to him but when he ſent for me."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Richardſon?"</q> JOHNSON.  <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir. But I ſought after George Pſalmanazar the moſt. I uſed to go and ſit with him at an alehouſe in the city."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I am happy to mention another inſtance which I diſcovered of his <hi>ſeeking after</hi> a man of merit. Soon after the Honourable Daines Barrington had publiſhed his excellent <q rend="inline">"Obſervations on the Statutes,"</q> Johnſon waited on that worthy and learned gentleman; and, having told him his name, cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſly ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I have read your book, Sir, with great pleaſure, and wiſh to be better known to you."</q> Thus began an acquaintance, which was continued with mutual regard as long as Johnſon lived.</p>
               <p>Talking of a recent ſeditious delinquent, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"They ſhould ſet him in the pillory, that he may be puniſhed in a way that would diſgrace him."</q> I obſerved, that the pillory does not always diſgrace. And I mentioned an inſtance of a gentleman who I thought was not diſhonoured by it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Aye, but he was, Sir. He could not mouth and ſtrut as he uſed to do, after having been there. People are not very willing to aſk a man to their tables who has ſtood in the pillory."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The gentleman who had dined with us at Dr. Percy's<note n="3" place="bottom">See p. 217 of this Volume.</note> came in. Johnſon attacked the Americans with intemperate vehemence of abuſe. I ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in their favour; and added, that I was always ſorry when he talked on that ſubject. This, it ſeems, exaſperated him; though he ſaid nothing at the time. The cloud was charged with ſulphureous vapour, which was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to burſt in thunder.—We talked of a gentleman who was running out his fortune in London; and I ſaid <q rend="inline">"We muſt get him out of it. All his friends muſt quarrel with him, and that will ſoon drive him away."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, we'll ſend <hi>you</hi> to him. If your company does not drive a man out of his houſe, nothing will."</q> This was a horrible ſhock, for which there was no viſible cauſe. I afterwards aſked him why he had ſaid ſo harſh a thing. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Becauſe, Sir, you had made me angry about the Americans."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But why did not you take your revenge directly?"</q> JOHNSON. (ſmiling) <q rend="inline">"Becauſe, Sir, I had nothing ready. A man cannot ſtrike till he has his weapons."</q> This was a candid and pleaſant confeſſion.</p>
               <p>He ſhewed me to-night his drawing-room, very genteelly fitted up; and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Mrs. Thrale ſneered when I talked of my having aſked you and your lady to live at my houſe. I was obliged to tell her, that you would be in as reſpectable a ſituation in my houſe as in hers. Sir, the inſolence of wealth
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:0548300102:244" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 will creep out."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"She has a little both of the inſolence of wealth, and the conceit of parts."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"The inſolence of wealth is a wretched thing; but the conceit of parts has ſome foundation. To be ſure it ſhould not be. But who is without it?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yourſelf, Sir."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why I play no tricks: I lay no traps."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir. You are ſix feet high, and you only do not ſtoop."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of the numbers of people that ſometimes have compoſed the houſehold of great families. I mentioned that there were a hundred in the family of the preſent Earl of Eglintoune's father. Dr. Johnſon ſeeming to doubt it, I began to enumerate. <q rend="inline">"Let us ſee: my Lord and my lady two."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, if you are to count by twos, you may be long enough."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Well, but now I add two ſons and ſeven daughters, and a ſervant for each, that will make twenty; ſo we have the fifth part already."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Very true. You get at twenty pretty readily; but you will not ſo eaſily get further on. We grow to five feet pretty readily; but it is not ſo eaſy to grow to ſeven."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Sunday, April 19, being Eaſter-day, after the ſolemnities of the feſtival in St. Paul's church, I viſited him, but could not ſtay to dinner. I expreſſed a wiſh to have the arguments for Chriſtianity always in readineſs, that my religious faith might be as firm and clear as any propoſition whatever, ſo that I need not be under the leaſt uneaſineſs when it ſhould be attacked. JOHNSON <q rend="inline">"Sir you cannot anſwer all objections. You have demonſtration for a Firſt Cauſe: you ſee he muſt be good as well as powerful, becauſe there is nothing to make him otherwiſe, and goodneſs of itſelf is preferable. Yet you have againſt this, what is very certain, the unhappineſs of human life. This, however, gives us reaſon to hope for a future ſtate of compenſation, that there may be a perfect ſyſtem. But of that we were not ſure till we had a poſitive revelation."</q> I told him, that his <q rend="inline">"Raſſelas"</q> had often made me unhappy; for it repreſented the miſery of human life ſo well, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly to a thinking mind, that if at any time the impreſſion wore off, and I felt myſelf eaſy, I began to ſuſpect ſome deluſion.</p>
               <p>On Monday, April 20, I found him at home in the morning. We talked of a gentleman who we apprehended was gradually involving his circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances by bad management. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Waſting a fortune is evaporation by a thouſand imperceptible means. If it were a ſtream, they'd ſtop it. You muſt ſpeak to him. It is really miſerable. Were he a gameſter, it could be ſaid he had hopes of winning. Were he a bankrupt in trade, he might have grown rich; but he has neither ſpirit to ſpend, nor reſolution to
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:0548300102:245" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſpare. He does not ſpend faſt enough to have pleaſure from it. He has  the crime of prodigality, and the wretchedneſs of parſimony. If a man is killed in a duel, he is killed as many a one has been killed; but it is a ſad thing for a man to lie down and die; to bleed to death, becauſe he has not fortitude enough to ſear the wound, or even to ſtitch it up."</q> I cannot but pauſe a moment to admire the fecundity of fancy, and choice of language, which in this inſtance, and, indeed, on almoſt all occaſions, he diſplayed. It was well obſerved by Dr. Percy, now Biſhop of Dromore, <q rend="inline">"The converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Johnſon is ſtrong and clear, and may be compared to an antique ſtatue, where every vein and muſcle is diſtinct and bold. Ordinary converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion reſembles an inferiour caſt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Saturday, April 25, I dined with him at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's, with the learned Dr. Muſgrave, Counſellor Leland of Ireland, ſon to the hiſtorian, Mrs. Cholmondeley, and ſome more ladies. <q rend="inline">"The Project,"</q> a new poem, was read to the company by Dr. Muſgrave. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it has no power. Were it not for the well-known names with which it is filled, it would be nothing: the names carry the poet, not the poet the names."</q> MUSGRAVE. <q rend="inline">"A temporary poem always entertains us."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"So does an account of the criminals hanged yeſterday entertain us."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He proceeded:—<q rend="inline">"Demoſthenes Taylor, as he was called, (that is, the tranſlator of Demoſthenes,) was the moſt ſilent man, the mereſt ſtatue of a man that I have ever ſeen. I once dined in company with him, and all he ſaid during the whole time was no more than <hi>Richard.</hi> How a man ſhould ſay only Richard, it is not eaſy to imagine. But it was thus: Dr. Douglas was talking of Dr. Zachary Grey, and aſcribing to him ſomething that was written by Dr. Richard Grey. So to correct him, Taylor ſaid, (imitating his affected ſententious emphaſis and nod,) <hi>'Richard.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Cholmondeley, in a high flow of ſpirits, exhibited ſome lively ſallies of hyperbolical compliment to Johnſon, with whom ſhe had been long acquainted, and was very eaſy. He was quick in catching the <hi>manner</hi> of the moment, and anſwered her ſomewhat in the ſtyle of the hero of a romance, <q rend="inline">"Madam, you crown me with unſading laurels."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I happened, I know not how, to ſay that a pamphlet meant a proſe piece. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir. A few ſheets of poetry unbound are a pamphlet, as much as a few ſheets of proſe."</q> MUSGRAVE. <q rend="inline">"A pamphlet may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to mean a poetical piece, in Weſtminſter-Hall, that is in formal language; but in common language it is underſtood to mean proſe."</q> JOHNSON. (and here was one of the many inſtances of his knowing clearly
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:0548300102:246" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 and telling exactly how a thing is) <q rend="inline">"A pamphlet is underſtood in common language to mean proſe, only from this, that there is ſo much more proſe written than poetry; as when we ſay a <hi>book,</hi> proſe is underſtood for the ſame reaſon, though a book may as well be in poetry as in proſe. We under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand what is moſt general, and we name what is leſs frequent."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of a certain lady's verſes on Ireland. MISS REYNOLDS. <q rend="inline">"Have you ſeen them, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Madam. I have ſeen a tranſlation from Horace, by one of her daughters. She ſhewed it me."</q> MISS REYNOLDS. <q rend="inline">"And how was it, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why very well for a young Miſs's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>ſes;—that is to ſay, compared with excellence, nothing; but, very well, for the perſon who wrote them. I am vexed at being ſhewn verſes in that manner."</q> MISS REYNOLDS. <q rend="inline">"But if they ſhould be good, why not give them hearty praiſe?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Madam, becauſe I have not then got the better of my bad humour from having been ſhewn them. You muſt conſider, Madam; before-hand they may be bad as well as good. Nobody has a right to put another under ſuch a difficulty, that he muſt either hurt the perſon by telling the truth, or hurt himſelf by telling what is is not true."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"A man often ſhews his writings to people of eminence, to obtain from them, either from their good-nature, or from their not being able to tell the truth firmly, a commendation, of which he may afterwards avail himſelf."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Very true, Sir. Therefore a man, who is aſked by an authour what he thinks of his work, is put to the torture, and is not obliged to ſpeak the truth; ſo that what he ſays is not be conſidered as his opinion; yet he has ſaid it, and cannot retract it; and this authour, when mankind are hunting him with a canniſter at his tail, can ſay, 'I would not have publiſhed, had not Johnſon, or Reynolds, or Muſgrave, or ſome other good judge commended the work.' Yet I conſider it as a very difficult queſtion in conſcience, whether one ſhould adviſe a man not to publiſh a work, if profit be his object; for the man may ſay, 'Had it not been for you, I ſhould have had the money.' Now you cannot be ſure; for you have only your own opinion, and the publick may think very differently."</q> SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. <q rend="inline">"You muſt upon ſuch an occaſion have two judgements; one as to the real value of the work, the other as to what may pleaſe the general taſte at the time."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But you can be <hi>ſure</hi> of neither; and therefore I ſhould ſcruple much to give a ſuppreſſive vote. Both Goldſmith's comedies were once refuſed; his firſt by Garrick, his ſecond by Colman, who was prevailed on at laſt by much ſolicitation, nay, a kind of force, to bring it on. His
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:0548300102:247" rendition="simple:additions"/>
'Vicar of Wakefield' I myſelf did not think would have had much ſucceſs.  It was written and ſold to a bookſeller before his 'Traveller,' but publiſhed after; ſo little expectation had the bookſeller from it. Had it been ſold after 'The Traveller,' he might have had twice as much money for it, though ſixty guineas was no mean price. The bookſeller had the advantage of Goldſmith's reputation from 'The Traveller' in the ſale, though he had it not in ſelling the copy."</q> SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. <q rend="inline">"The Beggars Opera affords a proof how ſtrangely people will differ in opinion about a literary performance. Burke thinks it has no merit."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It was refuſed by one of the houſes; but I ſhould have thought it would ſucceed, not from any great excellence in the writing, but from the novelty, and the general ſpirit and gaiety of the piece, which keeps the audience always attentive, and diſmiſſes them in good humour."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We went to the drawing-room, where was a conſiderable increaſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany. Several of us got round Dr. Johnſon, and complained that he would not give us an exact catalogue of his works, that there might be a complete edition. He ſmiled, and evaded our intreaties. That he intended to do it I have no doubt, becauſe I have heard him ſay ſo; and I have in my poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion an imperfect liſt, fairly written out, which he entitles <hi>Hiſtoria Studiorum.</hi> I once got from one of his friends a liſt, which there was pretty good reaſon to ſuppoſe was accurate, for it was written down in his preſence by this friend, who enumerated each article aloud, and had ſome of them mentioned to him by Mr. Levett, in concert with whom it was made out; and Johnſon, who heard all this, did not contradict it. But when I ſhewed a copy of this liſt to him, and mentioned the evidence for its exactneſs, he laughed, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I was willing to let them go on as they pleaſed, and never interfered."</q> Upon which I read it to him, article by article, and got him poſitively to own or refuſe; and then having obtained certainty ſo far, I got ſome other articles confirmed by him directly, and afterwards, from time to time, made additions under his ſanction.</p>
               <p>His friend Edward Cave having been mentioned, he told us, <q rend="inline">"Cave uſed to ſell ten thouſand of 'The Gentleman's Magazine;' yet ſuch was then his minute attention and anxiety that the ſale ſhould not feel the ſmalleſt diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that he would name a particular perſon who he heard had talked of leaving off the magazine, and would ſay, 'Let us have ſomething good next month."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It was obſerved, that avarice was inherent in ſome diſpoſitions. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No man was born a miſer, becauſe no man was born to poſſeſſion. Every
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:0548300102:248" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 man is born <hi>cupidus</hi>—deſirous of getting; but not <hi>avarus</hi>—deſirous of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I have heard old Mr. Sheridan maintain, with much ingenuity, that a complete miſer is a happy man; a miſer who gives himſelf wholly to the one paſſion of ſaving."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That is flying in the face of all the world, who have called an avaricious man a <hi>miſer,</hi> becauſe he is miſerable. No, Sir; a man who both ſpends and ſaves money is the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt man, becauſe he has both enjoyments."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The converſation having turned on <hi>Bon Mots,</hi> he quoted from one of the <hi>Ana</hi> an exquiſite inſtance of flattery in a maid of honour in France, who being aſked by the Queen what o'clock it was, anſwered, <q rend="inline">"What your Majeſty pleaſes."</q> He admitted that Mr. Burke's claſſical pun upon Mr. Wilkes's being carried on the ſhoulders of the mob,
<q>
                     <l>"—Numeriſque fertur</l>
                     <l>"Lege ſolutus,"—</l>
                  </q>
was admirable; and though he was ſtrangely unwilling to allow to that extraordinary man the talent of wit <note n="4" place="bottom">See this queſtion fully inveſtigated in the Notes upon my <q rend="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</q> edit. 3, p. 21, <hi>et ſeq.</hi> And here, as a lawyer mindful of the maxim <hi>Suum cuique tribuito,</hi> I cannot forbear to mention, that the additional Note beginning with <q rend="inline">"I find ſince the former edition,"</q> is not mine, but was obligingly furniſhed by Mr. Malone, who was ſo kind as to ſuperintend the preſs while I was in Scotland, and the firſt part of the ſecond edition was printing. He would not allow me to aſcribe it to its proper authour; but as it is exquiſitely acute and elegant, I take this opportunity, without his knowledge, to do him juſtice.</note>, he alſo laughed with approbation at another of his playful conceits; which was, that <q rend="inline">"Horace has in one line given a deſcription of a good deſirable manour:
<q>
                        <l>'Eſt modus in rebus, ſunt certi denique fines.'</l>
                     </q>
that is to ſay, a <hi>modus</hi> as to the tithes and certain <hi>fines.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>He obſerved, <q rend="inline">"A man cannot with propriety ſpeak of himſelf, except he relates ſimple facts; as, 'I was at Richmond:' or what depends on menſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; as, 'I am ſix feet high." He is ſure he has been at Richmond; he is ſure he is ſix feet high: but he cannot be ſure he is wiſe, or that he has any other excellence. Then, all cenſure of a man's ſelf is oblique praiſe. It is in order to ſhew how much he can ſpare. It has all the invidiouſneſs of ſelf-praiſe, and all the reproach of falſehood."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Sometimes it may proceed from a man's ſtrong conſciouſneſs of his faults being obſerved. He knows that others would throw him down, and therefore he had better lye down ſoftly of his own accord."</q>

On Tueſday, April 28, he was engaged to dine at General Paoli's, where,  as I have already obſerved, I was ſtill entertained in elegant hoſpitality, and with all the eaſe and comfort of a home. I called on him, and accompanied him in a hackney-coach. We ſtopped firſt at the bottom of Hedge-lane, into which he went to leave a letter, <q rend="inline">"with good news for a poor man in diſtreſs,"</q> as he told me. I did not queſtion him particularly as to this. He himſelf often reſembled Lady Bolingbroke's lively deſcription of Pope: that <q rend="inline">"he was <hi>un politique aux choux et aux raves.</hi>"</q> He would ſay, <q rend="inline">"I dine to-day in Groſvenor-ſquare;"</q> this might be with a Duke: or, perhaps, <q rend="inline">"I dine to-day at the other end of the town:"</q> or, <q rend="inline">"A gentleman of great eminence called on me yeſterday."</q>—He loved thus to keep things floating in conjecture: <hi>Omne ignotum pro magnifico eſt.</hi> I believe I ventured to diſſipate the cloud, to unveil the myſtery, more freely and frequently than any of his friends. We ſtopped again at Wirgman's, the corner of St. James's-ſtreet, a <hi>toy-ſhop,</hi> to which he had been directed, but not clearly, for he ſearched about ſome time, and could not find it at firſt; and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"To direct one only to a corner ſhop is <hi>toying</hi> with one."</q> I ſuppoſe he meant this as a play upon the word <hi>toy:</hi> it was the firſt time that I knew him ſtoop to ſuch ſport. After he had been ſome time in the ſhop, he ſent for me to come out of the coach, and help him to chooſe a pair of ſilver buckles, as thoſe he had were too ſmall. Probably this alteration in dreſs had been ſuggeſted by Mrs. Thrale, by aſſociating with whom, his external appearance was much improved. He got better clothes; and the dark colour, from which he never deviated, was enlivened by metal buttons. His wigs, too, were much better; and during their travels in France, he was furniſhed with a Paris-made wig, of handſome conſtruction. This chooſing of ſilver buckles was a negociation: <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) I will not have the ridiculous large ones now in faſhion; and I will give no more than a guinea for a pair."</q> Such were the <hi>principles</hi> of the buſineſs; and, after ſome examination, he was fitted. As we drove along, I found him in a talking humour, of which I availed myſelf. BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I was this morning in Ridley's ſhop, Sir; and was told, that the collection called <hi>'Johnſoniana'</hi> has ſold very much."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yet the 'Journey to the Hebrides' has not had a great ſale <note n="5" place="bottom">Here he either was miſtaken, or had a different notion of an extenſive ſale from what is generally entertained: for the fact is, that four thouſand copies of that excellent work were ſold very quickly. A new edition has been printed ſince his death, beſides that in the collection of his works.</note>."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"That is ſtrange."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; for in that book I have told the world a great deal that they did not know before."</q>

 BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I drank chocolate, Sir, this forenoon with Mr. Eld; and, to my no ſmall ſurprize, found him to be a <hi>Staffordſhire Whig,</hi> a being which I did not believe had exiſted."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, there are raſcals in all coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Eld ſaid, a Tory was a creature generated between a non-juring parſon and one's grand-mother."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"And I have always ſaid, the firſt Whig was the Devil."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"He certainly was, Sir. The Devil was impatient of ſubordination; he was the firſt who reſiſted power:
<q>
                        <l>'Better to reign in Hell than ſerve in Heaven."</l>

               <p>At General Paoli's were Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Marcheſe Gherardi of Lombardy, and Mr. John Spottiſwoode, of Spottiſwoode <note n="6" place="bottom">In the phraſeology of Scotland, I ſhould have ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Mr. Spottiſwoode, <hi>of that ilk.</hi>"</q> Johnſon knew that ſenſe of the word very well, and has thus explained it in his Dictionary, <hi>voce</hi> ILK—<q rend="inline">"It alſo ſignifies 'the ſame;' as, <hi>Mackintoſh of that ilk,</hi> denotes a gentleman whoſe ſurname and the title of his eſtate are the ſame."</q>
                  </note>, the ſolicitor. At this time fears of an invaſion were circulated; to obviate which, Mr. Spottiſwoode obſerved, that Mr. Fraſer the engineer, who had lately come from Dunkirk, ſaid, that the French had the ſame fears of us. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is thus that mutual cowardice keeps us in peace. Were one half of mankind brave, and one half cowards, the brave would be always beating the cowards. Were all brave, they would lead a very uneaſy life; all would be continually fighting: but being all cowards, we go on very well."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of drinking wine. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I require wine only when I am alone. I have then often wiſhed for it, and often taken it."</q> SPOTTISWOODE. <q rend="inline">"What, by way of a companion, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"To get rid of myſelf, to ſend myſelf away. Wine gives great pleaſure; and every pleaſure is of itſelf a good. It is a good, unleſs counterbalanced by evil. A man may have a ſtrong reaſon not to drink wine; and that may be greater than the pleaſure. Wine makes a man better pleaſed with himſelf. I do not ſay that it makes him more pleaſing to others. Sometimes it does. But the danger is, that while a man grows better pleaſed with himſelf, he may be growing leſs pleaſing to others. Wine gives a man nothing. It neither gives him knowledge nor wit; it only animates a man, and enables him to bring out <note place="bottom">

But ſurely, a moderate uſe of wine gives a gaiety of ſpirits which water-drinkers know not.</note>

what a dread of the company has repreſſed. It only puts in motion what  has been locked up in froſt. But this may be good, or it may be bad."</q> SPOTTISWOODE. <q rend="inline">"So, Sir, wine is a key which opens a box: but this box may be either full or empty."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, converſation is the key: wine is a pick-lock which forces open the box and injures it. A man ſhould cultivate his mind ſo as to have that confidence and readineſs without wine, which wine gives."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"The great difficulty of reſiſting wine is from benevolence. For inſtance, a good worthy man aſks you to taſte his wine which he has had twenty years in his cellar."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, all this notion about benevolence ariſes from a man's imagining himſelf to be of more importance to others, than he really is. They don't care a farthing whether he drinks wine or not."</q> SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. <q rend="inline">"Yes, they do for the time."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"For the time!—If they care this minute, they forget it the next. And as for the good worthy man; how do we know he is good and worthy? No good and worthy man will inſiſt upon another man's drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wine. As to the wine twenty years in the cellar—of ten men, three ſay this, merely becauſe they muſt ſay ſomething;—three are telling a lie, when they ſay they have had the wine twenty years;—three would rather ſave the wine;—one, perhaps, cares. I allow it is ſomething to pleaſe one's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; and people are always pleaſed with thoſe who partake pleaſure with them. But after a man has brought himſelf to relinquiſh the great perſonal pleaſure which ariſes from drinking wine, any other conſideration is a trifle. To pleaſe others by drinking wine, is ſomething, only if there be nothing againſt it. I ſhould, however, be-ſorry to offend worthy men:
<q>
                        <l>'Curſt be the verſe, how well ſoe'er it flow,</l>
                        <l>'That tends to make one worthy man my foe."</l>
                     </q>
                  </q>
BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Curſt be the <hi>ſpring,</hi> the <hi>water.</hi>"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But let us conſider what a ſad thing it would be, if we were obliged to drink or do any thing elſe that may happen to be agreeable to the company where we are."</q> LANGTON. <q rend="inline">"By the ſame rule you muſt join with a gang of cut-purſes."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir: but yet we muſt do juſtice to wine; we muſt allow it the power it poſſeſſes. To make a man pleaſed with himſelf, let me tell you, is doing a very great thing;
<q>
                        <l>'Si patriae volumus, ſi <hi>Nobis</hi> vivere cari."</l>

 I was at this time myſelf a water-drinker upon trial by Johnſon's recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Boſwell is a bolder combatant than Sir Joſhua: he argues for wine without the help of wine; but Sir Joſhua with it."</q> SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. <q rend="inline">"But to pleaſe one's company is a ſtrong motive."</q> JOHNSON. (who, from drinking only water, ſuppoſed every body who drank wine to be elevated,) <q rend="inline">"I won't argue any more with you, Sir. You are too far gone."</q> SIR JOSHUA. <q rend="inline">"I ſhould have thought ſo indeed, Sir, had I made ſuch a ſpeech as you have now done."</q> JOHNSON. (drawing himſelf in, and, I really thought, bluſhing,) <q rend="inline">"Nay, don't be angry. I did not mean to offend you."</q> SIR JOSHUA. <q rend="inline">"At firſt the taſte of wine was diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to me; but I brought myſelf to drink it, that I might be like other people. The pleaſure of drinking wine is ſo connected with pleaſing your company, that altogether there is ſomething of ſocial goodneſs in it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, this is only ſaying the ſame thing over again."</q> SIR JOSHUA. <q rend="inline">"No, this is new."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You put it in new words, but it is an old thought. This is one of the diſadvantages of wine. It makes a man miſtake words for thoughts."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I think it is a new thought; at leaſt, it is in a new <hi>attitude.</hi>"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, it is only in a new coat; or an old coat with a new facing. (Then laughing heartily) It is the old dog in a new doublet.—An extraordinary inſtance however may occur where a man's patron will do nothing for him, unleſs he will drink: <hi>there</hi> may be a good reaſon for drinking."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned a nobleman who I believed was really uneaſy if his company would not drink hard. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That is from having had people about him whom he has been accuſtomed to command."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Suppoſing I ſhould be <hi>tête à tête</hi> with him at table."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, there is no more reaſon for your drinking with <hi>him,</hi> than his being ſober with <hi>you.</hi>"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Why that is true; for it would do him leſs hurt to be ſober, than it would do me to get drunk."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; and from what I have heard of him, one would not wiſh to ſacrifice himſelf to ſuch a man. If he muſt always have ſomebody to drink with him, he ſhould buy a ſlave, and then he would be ſure to have it. They who ſubmit to drink as another pleaſes, make themſelves his ſlaves."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, you will ſurely make allowance for the duty of hoſpitality. A gentleman who loves drinking comes to viſit me."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, a man knows whom he viſits; he comes to the table of a ſober man."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, you and I ſhould not have been ſo well received in the Highlands and Hebrides, if I had not drank with our worthy friends. Had I drunk water only as you did, they would not
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:0548300102:253" rendition="simple:additions"/>
have been ſo cordial."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir William Temple mentions that in  his travels through the Netherlands he had two or three gentlemen with him, and when a bumper was neceſſary he put it on <hi>them.</hi> Were I to travel again through the Highlands, I would have Sir Joſhua with me to take the bumpers."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, let me put a caſe. Suppoſe Sir Joſhua ſhould take a jaunt into Scotland; he does me the honour to pay me a viſit at my houſe in the country; I am overjoyed at ſeeing him; we are quite by ourſelves; ſhall I unſociably and churliſhly let him ſit drinking by himſelf? No, no, my dear Sir Joſhua, you ſhall not be treated ſo, I <hi>will</hi> take a bottle with you."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The celebrated Mrs. Rudd being mentioned, JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Fifteen years ago I ſhould have gone to ſee her."</q> SPOTTISWOODE. <q rend="inline">"Becauſe ſhe was fifteen years younger?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; but now they have a trick of putting every thing into the news-papers."</q>

               <p>He begged of General Paoli to repeat one of the introductory ſtanzas of the firſt book of Taſſo's <q rend="inline">"Jeruſalem,"</q> which he did, and then Johnſon found fault with the ſimile of ſweetening the edges of a cup for a child, being transferred from Lucretius into an epick poem. The General ſaid he did not imagine Homer's poetry was ſo ancient as is ſuppoſed, becauſe he aſcribes to a Greek colony circumſtances of refinement not found in Greece itſelf at a later period, when Thucydides wrote. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I recollect but one paſſage quoted by Thucydides from Homer, which is not to be found in our copies of Homer's works; I am for the antiquity of Homer, and think that a Grecian colony by being nearer Perſia might be more refined than the mother country."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, April 29, I dined with him at Mr. Allan Ramſay's, where were Lord Binning, Dr. Robertſon the hiſtorian, Sir Joſhua Reynolds, and the Honourable Mrs. Boſcawen, widow of the Admiral, and mother of the preſent Viſcount Falmouth, of whom, if it be not preſumptuous in me to praiſe her, I would ſay, that her manners are the moſt agreeable, and her converſation the beſt of any lady with whom I ever had the happineſs to be acquainted. Before Johnſon came we talked a good deal of him; Ramſay ſaid he had always found him a very polite man, and that he treated him with great reſpect, which he did very ſincerely. I ſaid I wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped him. ROBERTSON. <q rend="inline">"But ſome of you ſpoil him; you ſhould not worſhip him; you ſhould worſhip no man."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I cannot help worſhipping him, he is ſo much ſuperiour to other men."</q> ROBERTSON. <q rend="inline">"In criticiſm, and in wit in converſation he is no doubt very excellent; but in other reſpects he is not above other men; he will believe any thing, and will
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:0548300102:254" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 ſtrenuouſly defend the moſt minute circumſtance connected with the Church of England."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Believe me, Doctor, you are much miſtaken as to this; for when you talk with him calmly in private, he is very liberal in his way of thinking."</q> ROBERTSON. <q rend="inline">"He and I have been always very gracious; the firſt time I met him was one evening at Strahan's, when he had juſt had an unlucky altercation with Adam Smith, to whom he had been ſo rough, that Strahan, after Smith was gone, had remonſtrated with him, and told him that I was coming ſoon, and that he was uneaſy to think that he might behave in the ſame manner to me. 'No, no, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) I warrant you Robertſon and I ſhall do very well.' Accordingly he was gentle and good-humoured, and courteous with me the whole evening<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he has been ſo upon every occaſion that we have met ſince. I have often ſaid (laughing) that I have been in a great meaſure indebted to Smith for my good reception."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"His power of reaſoning is very ſtrong, and he has a peculiar art of drawing characters, which is as rare as good portrait painting."</q> SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS. <q rend="inline">"He is undoubtedly admirable in this; but, in order to mark the characters which he draws, he overcharges them, and gives people more than they really have, whether of good or bad."</q>
               </p>
               <p>No ſooner did he, of whom we had been thus talking ſo eaſily, arrive, than we were all as quiet as a ſchool upon the entrance of the head-maſter; and were very ſoon ſet down to a table covered with ſuch variety of good things as contributed not a little to diſpoſe him to be pleaſed.</p>
               <p>RAMSAY. <q rend="inline">"I am old enough to have been a contemporary of Pope. His poetry was highly admired in his life-time, more a great deal than after his death."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it has not been leſs admired after his death; no authours ever had ſo much fame in their own life-time as Pope and Voltaire; and Pope's poetry has been as much admired after his death as during his life; it has only not been as much talked of, but that is owing to its being now more diſtant, and people having other writings to talk of. Virgil is leſs talked of than Pope, and Homer is leſs talked of than Virgil; but they are not leſs admired. We muſt read what the world reads at the moment. It has been maintained that this ſuperfcetation, this teeming of the preſs in modern times, is prejudicial to good literature, becauſe it obliges us to read ſo much of what is of inferiour value, in order to be in the faſhion; ſo that better works are neglected for want of time, becauſe a man will have more gratification of his vanity in converſation, from having read modern books, than from having read the beſt works of antiquity. But it muſt be conſidered,
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:0548300102:255" rendition="simple:additions"/>
that we have now more knowledge generally diffuſed; all our ladies read  now, which is a great extenſion. Modern writers are the moons of literature, they ſhine with reflected light, with light borrowed from the ancients. Greece appears to me to be the fountain of knowledge; Rome of elegance."</q> RAMSAY. <q rend="inline">"I ſuppoſe Homer's 'Iliad' to be a collection of pieces which had been written before his time. I ſhould like to ſee a tranſlation of it in poetical proſe like the book of Ruth or Job."</q> ROBERTSON. <q rend="inline">"Would you, Dr. Johnſon, who are maſter of the Engliſh language, but try your hand upon a part of it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you could not read it without the pleaſure of verſe <note n="8" place="bottom">This experiment which Madame Dacier made in vain, has ſince been tried in our own language, by the editor of <q rend="inline">"Oſſian,"</q> and we muſt either think very meanly of his abilities, or allow that Dr. Johnſon was in the right.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of antiquarian reſearches. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"All that is really <hi>known</hi> of the ancient ſtate of Britain is contained in a few pages. We <hi>can</hi> know no more than what the old writers have told us; yet what large books have we upon it, the whole of which excepting ſuch parts as are taken from thoſe old writers is all a dream, ſuch as Whitaker's 'Mancheſter.' I have heard Henry's 'Hiſtory of Britain' well ſpoken of, I am told it is carried on in ſeparate diviſions, as the civil, the military, the religious hiſtory; I wiſh much to have one branch well done, and that is the hiſtory of manners, of common life."</q> ROBERTSON. <q rend="inline">"Henry ſhould have applied his attention to that alone, which is enough for any man; and he might have found a great deal ſcattered in various books, had he read ſolely with that view. Henry erred in not ſelling his firſt volume at a moderate price to the bookſellers, that they might have puſhed him on till he had got reputation. I ſold my 'Hiſtory of Scotland' at a moderate price, as a work by which the bookſellers might either gain or not; and Cadell has told me that Millar and he have got ſix thouſand pounds by it. I afterwards received a much higher price for my writings. An authour ſhould ſell his firſt work for what the bookſellers will give, till it ſhall appear whether he is an authour of merit, or, which is the ſame thing as to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>rchaſe-money, an authour who pleaſes the publick."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Robertſon expatiated on the character of a certain nobleman; that he was one of the ſtrongeſt-minded men that ever lived; that he would ſit in company quite ſluggiſh, while there was nothing to call ſorth his intellectual vigour; but the moment that any important ſubject was ſtarted, for inſtance, how this country is to be defended againſt a French invaſion, he would rouſe
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:0548300102:256" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 himſelf, and ſhew his extraordinary talents with the moſt powerful ability and animation." JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yet this man cut his own throat. The true ſtrong and ſound mind is the mind that can embrace equally great things and ſmall. Now I am told the King of Pruſſia will ſay to a ſervant, 'Bring me a bottle of ſuch a wine, which came in ſuch a year; it lies in ſuch a corner of the cellars.' I would have a man to be great in great things, and elegant in little things."</q> He ſaid to me afterwards when we were by ourſelves, <q rend="inline">"Robertſon was in a mighty romantick humour, he talked of one whom he did not know; but I <hi>downed</hi> him with the King of Pruſſia.</q>—<q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, (ſaid I,) you threw a <hi>bottle</hi> at his head."</q>
               </p>
               <p>An ingenious gentleman was mentioned, concerning whom both Robertſon and Ramſay agreed that he had a conſtant firmneſs of mind; for after a laborious day, and amidſt a multiplicity of cares and anxieties, he would ſit down with his ſiſters and be quite cheerful and good-humoured. Such a diſpoſition it was obſerved, was a happy gift of nature. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I do not think ſo; a man has from nature a certain portion of mind; the uſe he makes of it depends upon his own free will. That a man has always the ſame firmneſs of mind I do not ſay; becauſe every man feels his mind leſs firm at one time than at another; but I think a man's being in a good or bad humour depends upon his will."</q> I, however, could not help thinking that a man's humour is often uncontroulable by his will.</p>
               <p>Johnſon harangued againſt drinking wine, <q rend="inline">"A man (ſaid he) may chooſe whether he will have abſtemiouſneſs and knowledge, or claret and ignorance."</q> Dr. Robertſon (who is very companionable) was beginning to diſſent as to the proſcription of claret. JOHNSON. (with a placid ſmile) <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, you ſhall not differ with me; as I have ſaid that the man is moſt perfect who takes in the moſt things, I am for knowledge and claret."</q> ROBERTSON. (holding a glaſs of generous claret in his hand) <q rend="inline">"Sir, I can only drink your health."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I ſhould be ſorry if <hi>you</hi> ſhould be ever in ſuch a ſtate as to be able to do nothing more."</q> ROBERTSON. <q rend="inline">"Dr. Johnſon, allow me to ſay, that in one reſpect I have the advantage of you; when you were in Scotland you would not come to hear any of our preachers, whereas when I am here I attend your publick worſhip without ſcruple, and indeed, with great ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, that is not ſo extraordinary: the King of Siam ſent ambaſſadors to Louis the Fourteenth; but Louis the Fourteenth ſent none to the King of Siam <note n="9" place="bottom">Mrs. Piozzi confidently mentions this as having paſſed in Scotland. <q rend="inline">"Anecdotes,"</q> p. 62.</note>."</q>
               </p>

                  <pb n="255" facs="tcp:0548300102:257" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Here my friend for once diſcovered a want of knowledge or forgetfulneſs; for  Louis the Fourteenth did ſend an embaſſy to the King of Siam, and the Abbé Choiſis, who was employed in it, publiſhed an account of it in two volumes.</p>
               <p>Next day, Thurſday, April 30, I found him at home by himſelf. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, Ramſay gave us a ſplendid dinner, I love Ramſay. You will not find a man in whoſe converſation there is more inſtruction, more informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and more elegance, than in Ramſay's."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"What I admire in Ramſay, is his continuing to be ſo young."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir, it is to be admired. I value myſelf upon this, that there is nothing of the old man in my converſation. I am now ſixty-eight, and I have no more of it than at twenty-eight."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, would not you wiſh to know old age? He who is never an old man does not know the whole of human life; for old age is one of the diviſions of it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, what talk is this?</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I mean, Sir, the Sphinx's deſcription of it—morning, noon, and night. I would know night, as well as morning and noon."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"What, Sir, would you know what it is to feel the evils of old age? Would you have the gout? Would you have decrepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude?"</q>—Seeing him heated, I would not argue any farther; but I was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident that I was in the right. I would, in due time, be a Neſtor, an elder of the people; and there <hi>ſhould</hi> be ſome difference between the converſation of twenty-eight and ſixty-eight. A grave picture ſhould not be gay. There is a ſerene, ſolemn, placid old age. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Mrs. Thrale's mother ſaid of me what flattered me much. A clergyman was complaining of want of ſociety in the country where he lived; and ſaid, 'They talk of <hi>runts;'</hi> (that is, young cows). 'Sir, (ſaid Mrs. Saluſbury,) Mr. Johnſon would learn to talk of runts:' meaning that I was a man who would make the moſt of my ſituation, whatever it was."</q> He added, <q rend="inline">"I think myſelf a very polite man."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Saturday, May 2, I dined with him at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's, where there was a very large company, and a great deal of converſation; but owing to ſome circumſtance which I cannot now recollect, I have no record of any part of it, except that there were ſeveral people there by no means of the Johnſonian ſchool; ſo that leſs attention was paid to him than uſual, which put him out of humour; and upon ſome imaginary offence from me, he attacked me with ſuch rudeneſs, that I was vexed and angry, becauſe it gave thoſe perſons an opportunity of enlarging upon his ſuppoſed ferocity, and ill treatment of his beſt friends. I was ſo much hurt, and had my pride ſo much rouſed, that I kept away from him for a week; and, perhaps,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:0548300102:258" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 might have kept away much longer, nay, gone to Scotland without ſeeing him again, had not we fortunately met and been reconciled. To ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy chances are human friendſhips liable.</p>
               <p>On Friday, May 8, I dined with him at Mr. Langton's. I was reſerved and ſilent, which I ſuppoſe he perceived, and might recollect the cauſe. After dinner, when Mr. Langton was called out of the room, and we were by ourſelves, he drew his chair near to mine, and ſaid, in a tone of conciliating courteſy, <q rend="inline">"Well, how have you done?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you have made me very uneaſy by your behaviour to me when we were laſt at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's. You know, my dear Sir, no man has a greater reſpect and affection for you, or would ſooner go to the end of the world to ſerve you. Now to treat me ſo—."</q> He inſiſted that I had interrupted him, which I aſſured him was not the caſe; and proceeded, <q rend="inline">"But why treat me ſo before people who neither love you nor me?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Well, I am ſorry for it. I'll make it up to you twenty different ways, as you pleaſe."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I ſaid to-day to Sir Joſhua, when he obſerved that you <hi>toſſed</hi> me ſometimes, I don't care how often, or how high he toſſes me, when only friends are preſent, for then I fall upon ſoft ground: but I do not like falling on ſtones, which is the caſe when enemies are preſent.—I think this a pretty good image, Sir."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is one of the happieſt I have ever heard."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, there was no venom in the wounds which he inflicted at any time, unleſs they were irritated by ſome malignant infuſion by other hands. We were inſtantly as cordial again as ever, and joined in hearty laugh at ſome ludicrous but innocent peculiarities of one of our friends. BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Do you think, Sir, it is always culpable to laugh at a man to his face?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, that depends upon the man and the thing. If it is a ſlight man, and a ſlight thing, you may; for you take nothing valuable from him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I read yeſterday Dr. Blair's ſermon on Devotion, from the text <hi>'Cornelius, a devout man.'</hi> His doctrine is the beſt limited, the beſt expreſſed: there is the moſt warmth without fanaticiſm, the moſt rational tranſport. There is one part of it which I diſapprove, and I'd have him correct it; which is, that 'he who does not feel joy in religion is far from the kingdom of heaven.' There are many good men whoſe fear of GOD predominates over their love. It may diſcourage. It was raſhly ſaid. A noble ſermon it is indeed. I wiſh Blair would come over to the Church of England."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When Mr. Langton returned to us, the <q rend="inline">"flow of talk"</q> went on. An eminent authour being mentioned;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He is not a pleaſant man. His converſation is neither inſtructive nor brilliant. He does not talk as if
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:0548300102:259" rendition="simple:additions"/>
impelled by any fullneſs of knowledge or vivacity of imagination. His  converſation is like that of any other ſenſible man. He talks with no wiſh either to inform or to hear, but only becauſe he thinks it does not become—to ſit in a company and ſay nothing."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Langton having repeated the anecdote of Addiſon having diſtinguiſhed between his powers in converſation and in writing, by ſaying <q rend="inline">"I have only nine-pence in my pocket; but I can draw for a thouſand pounds;"</q>—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He had not that retort ready, Sir; he had prepared it before-hand."</q> LANGTON. (turning to me) <q rend="inline">"A fine ſurmiſe. Set a thief to catch a thief."</q>

               <p>Johnſon called the Eaſt-Indians barbarians. BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"You will except the Chineſe, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Have they not arts?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"They have pottery."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"What do you ſay to the written characters of their language?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, they have not an alphabet. They have not been able to form what all other nations have formed.</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"There is more learning in their language than in any other, from the immenſe number of their characters."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is only more difficult from its rudeneſs; as there is more labour in hewing down a tree with a ſtone than with an axe."</q>

               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I have been reading Lord Kames's 'Sketches of the Hiſtory of Man.' In treating of ſeverity of puniſhment, he mentions that of Madame Lapouchin, in Ruſſia, but he does not give it fairly; for I have looked at <hi>Chappe D'Auteroche,</hi> from whom he has taken it. He ſtops where it is ſaid that the ſpectators thought her innocent, and leaves out what follows; that ſhe nevertheleſs was guilty. Now this is being as culpable as one can conceive, to miſrepreſent fact in a book, and for what motive? It is like one of thoſe lies which people tell, one cannot ſee why. The woman's life was ſpared; and no puniſhment is too great for the favourite of an Empreſs who had conſpired to dethrone her miſtreſs.</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"He was only giving a picture of the lady in her ſufferings."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, don't endeavour to palliate this. Guilt is a principal feature in the picture. Kames is puzzled with a queſtion that puzzled me when I was a very young man. Why is it that the intereſt of money is lower, when money is plentiful; for five pounds has the ſame proportion of value to a hundred pounds when money is plentiful, as when it is ſcarce? A lady explained it to me. 'It is (ſaid ſhe) becauſe when money is plentiful there are ſo many more who have money to lend, that they bid down one another. Many have then a hundred pounds; and one ſays, Take mine rather than another's, and you ſhall have it at four <hi>per cent.</hi>"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Does Lord Kames decide the queſtion?"</q> JOHNSON.

                  <q rend="inline">"I think he leaves it as he found it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"This muſt have been an extraordinary lady who inſtructed you, Sir. May I aſk who ſhe was?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Molly Aſton <note n="1" place="bottom">Johnſon had an extraordinary admiration of this lady, notwithſtanding ſhe was a violent Whig. In anſwer to her high-ſlown ſpeeches for <hi>Liberty,</hi> he addreſſed to her the following Epigram, of which I preſume to offer a tranſlation:
<q>
                           <l>"Liber ut eſſe velim ſuaſiſti pulchra Maria,</l>
                           <l>"Ut maneam liber pulchra Maria val."</l>
                        </q>

                           <l>Adieu, Maria! ſince you'd have me free;</l>
                           <l>For, who beholds thy charms a ſlave muſt be,</l>
                        </q>
                     </note>, Sir, the ſiſter of thoſe ladies with whom you dined at Lichfield.—I ſhall be at home to-morrow."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Then let us dine by ourſelves at the Mitre, to keep up the old cuſtom, 'the cuſtom of the Manor,' the cuſtom of the mitre."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, ſo it ſhall be."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Saturday, May 9, we fulfilled our purpoſe of dining by ourſelves at the Mitre, according to old cuſtom. There was, on theſe occaſions, a little circumſtance of kind attention to Mrs. Williams, which muſt not be omitted. Before coming out, and leaving her to dine alone, he gave her her choice of a chicken, a ſweetbread, or any other little nice thing, which was carefully ſent to her from the tavern, ready dreſt.</p>
               <p>Our converſation to-day, I know not how, turned, (I think for the only time at any length, during our long acquaintance,) upon the ſenſual intercourſe between the ſexes, the delight of which he aſcribed chiefly to imagination. <q rend="inline">"Were it not for imagination, Sir, (ſaid he,) a man would be as happy in the arms of a chambermaid as of a Ducheſs. But ſuch is the adventitious charm of fancy, that we find men who have violated the beſt principles of ſociety, and ruined their fame and their fortune, that they might poſſeſs a woman of rank."</q> It would not be proper to record the particulars of ſuch a converſation in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of unreſerved frankneſs, when nobody was preſent on whom it could have any hurtful effect. That ſubject, when philoſophically treated, may ſurely employ the mind in as curious diſcuſſion, and as innocently as anatomy; provided that thoſe who do treat it keep clear of inflammatory incentives.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"From grave to gay, from lively to ſevere,"</q>—we were ſoon engaged in very different ſpeculation; humbly and reverently conſidering and wondering at the univerſal myſtery of all things, as our imperfect faculties can now judge of them. <q rend="inline">"There are (ſaid he) innumerable queſtions to which the inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive mind can in this ſtate receive no anſwer: Why do you and I exiſt? Why was this world created? Since it was to be created, why was it not created ſooner?"</q>

On Sunday, May 10, I ſupped with him at Mr. Hoole's, with Sir Joſhua  Reynolds. I have neglected the memorial of this evening, ſo as to remember no more of it than two particulars; one, that he ſtrenuouſly oppoſed an argument by Sir Joſhua, that virtue was preferable to vice, conſidering this life only; and that a man would be virtuous were it only to preſerve his character: and, that he expreſſed much wonder at the curious formation of the bat, a mouſe with wings; ſaying, that <q rend="inline">"it was almoſt as ſtrange a thing in phyſiology, as if the fabulous dragon could be ſeen."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Tueſday, May 12, I waited on the Earl of Marchmont, to know if his Lordſhip would favour Dr. Johnſon with information concerning Pope, whoſe Life he was about to write. Johnſon had not flattered himſelf with the hopes of receiving any civility from this nobleman; for he ſaid to me, when I mentioned Lord Marchmont as one who could tell him a great deal about Pope, <q rend="inline">"Sir, he will tell <hi>me</hi> nothing."</q> I had the honour of being known to his Lordſhip, and applied to him of myſelf, without being commiſſioned by Johnſon. His Lordſhip behaved in the moſt polite and obliging manner, promiſed to tell all he recollected about Pope, and was ſo very courteous as to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Tell Dr. Johnſon I have a great reſpect for him, and am ready to ſhew it in any way I can. I am to be in the city to-morrow, and will call at his houſe as I return."</q> His Lordſhip however aſked, <q rend="inline">"Will he write the Lives of the Poets impartially? He was the firſt that brought Whig and Tory into a Dictionary. And what do you think of his definition of Exciſe? Do you know the hiſtory of his averſion to the word <hi>tranſpire?</hi>"</q> Then taking down the folio Dictionary, he ſhewed it with this cenſure on its ſecondary ſenſe: <q rend="inline">
                     <q rend="inline">"To eſcape from ſecreſy to notice; a ſenſe lately innovated from France, without neceſſity."</q> The truth was, Lord Bolingbroke, who left the Jacobites, firſt uſed it; therefore, it was to be condemned. He ſhould have ſhewn what word would do for it, if it was unneceſſary."</q> I afterwards put the queſtion to Johnſon: <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, (ſaid he,) <hi>get abroad.</hi>"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"That, Sir, is uſing two words."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, there's no end of this. You may as well inſiſt to have a word for old age."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, <hi>Senectus.</hi>"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, to inſiſt always that there ſhould be one word to expreſs a thing in Engliſh, becauſe there is one in another language, is to change the language."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I availed myſelf of this opportunity to hear from his Lordſhip many par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars both of Pope and Lord Bolingbroke, which I have in writing.</p>
               <p>I propoſed to Lord Marchmont that he ſhould reviſe Johnſon's Life of Pope: <q rend="inline">"So (ſaid his Lordſhip) you would put me in a dangerous ſituation. You know he knocked down Oſborne the bookſeller."</q>

 Elated with the ſucceſs of my ſpontaneous exertion to procure material and reſpectable aid to Johnſon for his very favourite work, <q rend="inline">"The Lives of the Poets."</q> I haſtened down to Mr. Thrale's at Streatham, where he now was, that I might inſure his being at home next day; and after dinner, when I thought he would receive the good news in the beſt humour, I announced it eagerly: <q rend="inline">"I have been at work for you to-day, Sir. I have been with Lord Marchmont. He bid me tell you he has a great reſpect for you, and will call on you to-morrow at one o'clock, and communicate all he knows about Pope."</q>—Here I pauſed, in full expectation that he would be pleaſed with this intelligence, would praiſe my active merit, and would be alert to embrace ſuch an offer from a nobleman. But whether I had ſhewn an over exultation, which provoked his ſpleen; or whether he was ſeized with a ſuſpicion that I had obtruded him on Lord Marchmont, and had humbled him too much; or whether there was any thing more than an unlucky fit of ill humour, I know not; but, to my ſurprize, the reſult was,—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I ſhall not be in town to-morrow. I don't care to know about Pope."</q> MRS. THRALE. (ſurprized as I was, and a little angry) <q rend="inline">"I ſuppoſe, Sir, Mr. Boſwell thought, that as you are to write Pope's Life, you would wiſh to know about him."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Wiſh! why yes. If it rained know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge I'd hold out my hand; but I would not give myſelf the trouble to go in queſt of it."</q> There was no arguing with him at the moment. Some time afterwards he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Lord Marchmont will call on me, and then I ſhall call on Lord Marchmont."</q> Mr. Thrale was uneaſy at his unaccountable caprice; and told me, that if I did not take care to bring about a meeting between Lord Marchmont and him, it would never take place, which would be a great pity. I ſent a card to his Lordſhip, to be left at Johnſon's houſe, acquainting him, that Dr. Johnſon could not be in town next day, but would do himſelf the honour of waiting on him at another time.—I give this account fairly, as a ſpecimen of that unhappy temper with which this great and good man had occaſionally to ſtruggle, from ſomething morbid in his conſtitution. Let the moſt cenſorious of my readers ſuppoſe himſelf to have a violent fit of the tooth-ach, or to have received a ſevere ſtroke on the ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bone, and when in ſuch a ſtate to be aſked a queſtion; and if he has any, candour, he will not be ſurprized at the anſwers which Johnſon ſometimes gave in moments of irritation, which, let me aſſure them, is exquiſitely painful. But it muſt not be erroneouſly ſuppoſed that he was, in the ſmalleſt degree, careleſs concerning any work which he undertook, or that he wsa generally thus peeviſh. It will be ſeen, that in the following year he had a very agreeable interview with Lord Marchmont, at his Lordſhip's
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:0548300102:263" rendition="simple:additions"/>
houſe; and this very afternoon he ſoon forgot any fretfulneſs, and fell into  converſation as uſual.</p>
               <p>I mentioned a reflection having been thrown out againſt four Peers for having preſumed to riſe in oppoſition to the opinion of the twelve Judges, in a cauſe in the Houſe of Lords, as if that were indecent. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, there is no ground for cenſure. The Peers are Judges themſelves: and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them really to be of a different opinion, they might from duty be in oppoſition to the Judges, who were there only to be conſulted."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this obſervation I fully concurred with him; for, unqueſtionably, all the Peers are veſted with the higheſt judicial powers; and, when they are confident that they underſtand a cauſe, are not obliged, nay ought not to acquieſce in the opinion of the ordinary law Judges, or even in that of thoſe who from their ſtudies and experience are called the Law Lords. I conſider the Peers in general as I do a Jury, who ought to liſten with reſpectful atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſages of the law; but, if after hearing them, they have a firm opinion of their own, are bound, as honeſt men, to decide accordingly. Nor is it ſo difficult for them to underſtand even law queſtions, as is generally thought; provided they will beſtow ſufficient attention upon them. This obſervation was made by my honoured relation the late Lord Cathcart, who had ſpent his life in camps and courts; yet aſſured me, that he could form a clear opinion upon moſt of the cauſes that came before the Houſe of Lords, <q rend="inline">"as they were ſo well enucleated in the Caſes."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Thrale told us, that a curious clergyman of our acquaintance had diſcovered a licentious ſtanza, which Pope had originally in his <q rend="inline">"Univerſal Prayer,"</q> before the ſtanza
<q>
                     <l>"What conſcience dictates to be done,</l>
                     <l>"Or warns us not to do, &amp;c.</l>
                  </q>
It was this:</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"Can ſins of moment claim the rod</l>
                     <l>"Of everlaſting fires?</l>
                     <l>"And that offend great Nature's GOD,</l>
                     <l>"Which Nature's ſelf inſpires?"</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>and that Dr. Johnſon obſerved, <q rend="inline">"it had been borrowed from <hi>Guarini.</hi>"</q> There are, indeed, in <hi>Paſtor Fido,</hi> many ſuch flimſy ſuperficial reaſonings, as that in the two laſt lines of this ſtanza.</p>
               <p>BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"In that ſtanza of Pope's, <hi>'rod of ſires,'</hi> is certainly a bad metaphor."</q> MRS. THRALE. <q rend="inline">"And 'ſins of <hi>moment'</hi> is a faulty expreſſion;

 for its true import is <hi>momentous,</hi> which cannot be intended."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It muſt have been written 'of <hi>moments.'</hi> Of <hi>moment,</hi> is <hi>momentous;</hi> of <hi>moments, momentary.</hi> I warrant you, however, Pope wrote this ſtanza, and ſome friend ſtruck it out.

JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He puzzled himſelf about predeſtination.—How fooliſh was it in Pope to give all his friendſhip to Lords, who thought they honoured him by being with him; and to chooſe ſuch Lords as Burlington, and Cobham, and Bolingbroke? Bathurſt was negative, a pleaſing man; and I have heard no ill of Marchmont: and then always ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, 'I do not value you for being a Lord;' which was a ſure proof that he did. I never ſay, I do not value Boſwell more for being born to an eſtate, becauſe I do not care."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Nor for being a Scotchman?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, I do value you more for being a Scotchman. You are a Scotchman without the faults of Scotchmen. You would not have been ſo valuable as you are, had you not been a Scotchman."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of divorces, I aſked if Othello's doctrine was not plauſible:
<q>
                     <l>"He who is robb'd, not wanting what is ſtolen,</l>
                     <l>"Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all."</l>
                  </q>
Dr. Johnſon and Mrs. Thrale joined againſt this. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Aſk any man if he'd wiſh not to know of ſuch an injury."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Would you tell your friend to make him unhappy?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Perhaps, Sir, I ſhould not; but that would be from prudence on my own account. A man would tell his father."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yes; becauſe he would not have ſpurious children to get any ſhare of the family inheritance."</q> MRS. THRALE. <q rend="inline">"Or he would tell his brother."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Certainly his <hi>elder</hi> brother."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"You would tell your friend of a woman's infamy, to prevent his marrying a whore: there is the ſame reaſon to tell him of his wife's infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, when he is married, to prevent the conſequences of impoſition. It is a breach of confidence not to tell a friend."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Would you tell Mr.—?"</q> (naming a gentleman who aſſuredly was not in the leaſt danger of ſuch a miſerable diſgrace, though married to a fine woman.) JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; becauſe it would do no good: he is ſo ſluggiſh, he'd never go to parliament and get through a divorce."</q>

He ſaid of one of our friends, <q rend="inline">"He is ruining himſelf without pleaſure.  A man who loſes at play, or who runs out his fortune at court, makes his eſtate leſs, in hopes of making it bigger: (I am ſure of this word, which was often uſed by him:) but it is a ſad thing to paſs through the quagmire of parſimony, to the gulph of ruin. To paſs over the flowery path of extravagance is very well."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Amongſt the numerous prints paſted on the walls of the dining-room at Streatham, was Hogarth's <q rend="inline">"Modern Midnight Converſation."</q> I aſked him what he knew of Parſon Ford, who makes a conſpicuous figure in the riotous groupe. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, he was my acquaintance and relation, my mother's nephew. He had purchaſed a living in the country, but not ſimoniacally. I never ſaw him but in the country. I have been told he was a man of great parts; very profligate, but I never heard he was impious."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Was there not a ſtory of his ghoſt having appeared?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it was believed. A waiter at the Hummums, in which houſe Ford died, had been abſent for ſome time, and returned, not knowing that Ford was dead. Going down to the cellar, according to the ſtory, he met him; going down again he met him a ſecond time. When he came up, he aſked ſome of the people of the houſe what Ford could be doing there. They told him Ford was dead. The waiter took a fever, in which he lay for ſome time. When he recovered, he ſaid he had a meſſage to deliver to ſome women from Ford; but he was not to tell what, or to whom. He walked out; he was followed; but ſomewhere about St. Paul's they loſt him. He came back, and ſaid he had delivered the meſſage, and the women exclaimed, 'Then we are all undone!' Dr. Pellet, who was not a credulous man, inquired into the truth of this ſtory, and he ſaid, the evidence was irreſiſtible. My wife went to the Hummums; (it is a place where people get themſelves cupped.) I believe ſhe went with intention to hear about this ſtory of Ford. At firſt they made difficulty to tell her; but, after they had talked to her, ſhe came away ſatisfied that it was true. To be ſure, the man had a fever; and this viſion may have been the beginning of it. But if the meſſage to the women, and their behaviour upon it were true as related, there was ſomething ſupernatural. That reſts upon his word; and there it remains."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After Mrs. Thrale was gone to bed, Johnſon and I ſat up late. We reſumed Sir Joſhua Reynolds's argument on Sunday laſt, that a man would be virtuous though he had no other motive than to preſerve his character. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is not true: for as to this world vice does not hurt a man's character."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; debauching a friend's wife will."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No,

 Sir. Who thinks the worſe of—for it?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Lord—was not his friend."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That is only a circumſtance, Sir; a ſlight diſtinction. He could not get into the houſe but by Lord—. A man is choſen Knight of the ſhire, not the leſs for having debauched ladies."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"What, Sir, if he debauched the ladies of gentlemen in the county, will not there be a general reſentment againſt him?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir. He will loſe thoſe particular gentlemen; but the reſt will not trouble their heads about it."</q> (warmly.) BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir, I cannot think ſo."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, there is no talking with a man who will diſpute what every body knows. (angrily.) Don't you know this?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; and I wiſh to think better of your country than you repreſent it. I knew in Scotland a gentleman obliged to leave it for debauching a lady; and in one of our counties an Earl's brother loſt his election, becauſe he had debauched the lady of another Earl in that county, and broken the peace of a noble family."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Still he would not yield. He proceeded: <q rend="inline">"Will you not allow, Sir, that vice does not hurt a man's character ſo as to obſtruct his proſperity in life, when you know that—was loaded with wealth and honours; a man who had acquired his fortune by ſuch crimes, that his conſciouſneſs of them impelled him to cut his own throat."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"You will recollect, Sir, that Dr. Robertſon ſaid, he cut his throat becauſe he was weary of ſtill life; little things not being ſufficient to move his great mind."</q> JOHNSON. (very angry) <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, what ſtuff is this? You had no more this opinion after Robertſon ſaid it, than before. I know nothing more offenſive than repeating what one knows to be fooliſh things, by way of continuing a diſpute, to ſee what a man will anſwer, to make him your butt!"</q> (angrier ſtill.) BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"My dear Sir, I had no ſuch intention as you ſeem to ſuſpect; I had not indeed. Might not this nobleman have felt every thing 'weary, ſtale, flat, and unprofitable,' as Hamlet ſays?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, if you are to bring in gabble, I'll talk no more. I will not, upon my honour."</q> My readers will decide upon this diſpute.</p>
               <p>Next morning I ſtated to Mrs. Thrale at breakfaſt, before he came down, the diſpute of laſt night as to the influence of character upon ſucceſs in life. She ſaid he was certainly wrong; and told me, that a Baronet loſt an election in Wales, becauſe he had debauched the ſiſter of a gentleman in the county, whom he made one of his daughters invite as her companion at his ſeat in the country, when his lady and his other children were in London.

               <p>Looking at Meſſrs.

He added, <q rend="inline">"in this book it is maintained that virtue is natural to man, and that if we would but conſult our own hearts we ſhould be virtuous. Now after conſulting our own hearts all we can, and with all the helps we have, we find how few of us are virtuous. This is ſaying a thing which all mankind know not to be true."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Is not modeſty natural?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I cannot ſay, Sir, as we find no people quite in a ſtate of nature; but I think the more they are taught, the more modeſt they are. The French are a groſs, ill-bred, untaught people; a lady there will ſpit on the floor and rub it with her foot. What I gained by being in France was, learning to be better ſatisfied with my own country. Time may be employed to more advantage from nineteen to twenty-four almoſt in any way than in travelling; when you ſet travelling againſt mere negation, againſt doing nothing, it is better to be ſure; but how much more would a young man improve were he to ſtudy during thoſe years. Indeed, if a young man is wild, and muſt run after women and bad company, it is better this ſhould be done abroad, as, on his return, he can break off ſuch connections, and begin at home a new man, with a character to form, and acquaintances to make. How little does travelling ſupply to the converſation of any man who has travelled? how little to Beauclerk?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"What ſay you to Lord—?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I never but once heard him talk of what he had ſeen, and that was of a large ſerpent in one of the Pyramids of Egypt."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Well, I happened to hear him tell the ſame thing, which made me mention him."</q>

               <p>As he was a zealous friend of ſubordination, he was at all times watchful to repreſs the vulgar cant againſt the manners of the great; <q rend="inline">"High people, Sir, (ſaid he,) are the beſt; take a hundred ladies of quality, you'll find them better wives, better mothers, more willing to ſacrifice their own pleaſure to their children, than a hundred other women. Tradeſwomen (I mean the wives of tradeſmen) in the city, who are worth from ten to fifteen thouſand pounds, are the worſt creatures upon the earth, groſsly ignorant, and thinking viciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs faſhionable. Farmers, I think, are often worthleſs fellows. Few lords will cheat; and, if they do, they'll be aſhamed of it: farmers cheat and are not aſhamed of it: they have all the ſenſual vices too of the nobility, with cheating into the bargain. There is as much fornication and adultery amongſt farmers as amongſt noblemen."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"The notion of the world, Sir, however is, that the morals of women of quality are worſe than thoſe in lower ſtations."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, the licentiouſneſs of one woman of quality makes more noiſe than that of a number of women in lower ſtations; then, Sir, you are to conſider the malignity of women in the city againſt women of quality, which will make them believe any thing of them, ſuch as that they call their coachmen to bed. No, Sir, ſo far as I have obſerved, the higher in rank, the richer ladies are, they are the better inſtructed and the more virtuous."</q>

               <p>The diſaſter of General Burgoyne's army was then the common topick of converſation.

               <p>On Sunday, May 17, I preſented to him Mr. Fullarton, of Fullarton, who has ſince diſtinguiſhed himſelf ſo much in India, to whom he naturally talked of travels, as Mr. Brydone accompanied him in his tour to Sicily and Malta. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"The information which we have from modern travellers is much more authentick than what we had from ancient travellers; ancient travellers gueſſed; modern travellers meaſure. The Swiſs admit that there is but one errour in Stanyan. If Brydone were more attentive to his Bible, he would be a good traveller."</q>

               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Lord Chatham was a Dictator; he poſſeſſed the power of putting the State in motion; now there is no power, all order is relaxed."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Is there no hope of a change to the better?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, yes, Sir, when we are weary of this relaxation. So the City of London will appoint its Mayors again by ſeniority."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But is not that taking a

               <p>On Tueſday, May 19, I was to ſet out for Scotland in the evening. He was engaged to dine with me at Mr. Dilly's, I waited upon him to remind him of his appointment and attend him thither; he gave me ſome ſalutary counſel, and recommended vigorous reſolution againſt any deviation from moral duty. BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But you would not have me to bind myſelf by a ſolemn obligation?"</q> JOHNSON.

The man who cannot go to Heaven without a vow—may go—"</q> Here, ſtanding erect, in the middle of his library, and rolling grand, his pauſe was truly a curious compound of the ſolemn and the ludicrous; he half-whiſtled in his uſual way, when pleaſant, and he pauſed, as if checked by religious awe.—Methought he would have added—to Hell—but was reſtrained. I humoured the dilemma. <q rend="inline">"What! Sir, (ſaid I,) <hi>'In coelum juſſeris ibit;</hi>"</q> alluding to his imitation of it,

               </p>
               <p>I had mentioned to him a ſlight fault in his noble <q rend="inline">"Imitation of the Tenth Satire of Juvenal,"</q> a too near recurrence of the verb <hi>ſpread,</hi> in his deſcription of the young Enthuſiaſt at College:</p>

               <p>He had deſired me to change <hi>ſpreads</hi> to <hi>burns,</hi> but for perfect authenticity, I now had it done with his own hand <note n="3" place="bottom">The ſlip of paper on which he made the correction, is depoſited by me in the noble library to which it relates, and to which I have preſented other pieces of his hand-writing.</note>. I thought this alteration not only cured the fault, but was more poetical, as it might carry an alluſion to the ſhirt by which Hercules was inflamed.</p>
               <p>We had a quiet comfortable meeting at Mr. Dilly's; nobody there but ourſelves, Mr. Dilly mentioned ſomebody having wiſhed that Milton's <q rend="inline">"Tractate on Education"</q> ſhould be printed along with his Poems in the

edition of the Engliſh Poets then going on. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It would be  breaking in upon the plan; but would be of no great conſequence. So far as it would be any thing it would be wrong. Education in England has been in danger of being hurt by two of its greateſt men, Milton and Locke. Milton's plan is impracticable, and I ſuppoſe has never been tried. Locke's, I fancy has been tried often enough; but is very imperfect, it gives too much to one ſide, and too little to the other; it gives too little to literature. I ſhall do what I can for Dr. Watts; but my materials are very ſcanty. His poems are by no means his beſt works; I cannot praiſe his poetry itſelf highly; but I can praiſe its deſign."</q>
               </p>
               <p>My illuſtrious friend and I parted with aſſurances of affectionate regard.</p>
               <p>Johnſon maintained a long and intimate friendſhip with Mr. Welch, who ſucceeded the celebrated Henry Fielding as one of his Majeſty's Juſtices of the Peace for Weſtminſter; kept a regular office for the police of that great diſtrict; and diſcharged his important truſt, for many years, faithfully and ably. Johnſon, who had an eager and unceaſing curioſity to know human life in all its variety, told me, that he attended Mr. Welch in his office for a whole winter, to hear the examinations of the culprits; but that he found an almoſt uniform tenor of misfortune, wretchedneſs, and profligacy. Mr. Welch's health being impaired, he was adviſed to try the effect of a warm climate; and Johnſon, by his intereſt with Mr. Chamier, procured him leave of abſence to go to Italy, and a promiſe that the penſion or ſalary of two hundred pounds a year, which Government allowed him, ſhould not be diſcontinued. Mr. Welch accordingly went abroad, accompanied by his daughter Anne, a young lady of uncommon talents and literature. I have been fortunate enough, as this work was paſſing through the preſs, to obtain the following letter; which, although the firſt part of my narrative of this year was printed off before I received it, will now come in with very little deviation from chronological order.</p>

                     </opener>
                     <p>TO have ſuffered one of my beſt and deareſt friends to paſs almoſt two years in foreign countries without a letter, has a very ſhameful appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of inattention. But the truth is, that there was no particular time in
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0548300102:272"/>
 which I had any thing particular to ſay; and general expreſſions of good will, I hope, our long friendſhip is grown too ſolid to want.</p>
                     <p>Of publick affairs you have information from the news-papers where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you go, for the Engliſh keep no ſecret; and of other things, Mrs. Nollekens informs you. My intelligence could therefore be of no uſe; and Miſs Nancy's letters made it unneceſſary to write to you for information: I was likewiſe for ſome time out of humour, to find that motion, and nearer approaches to the ſun, did not reſtore your health ſo faſt as I expected. Of your health, the accounts have lately been more pleaſing; and I have the gratification of imaging to myſelf a length of years which I hope you have gained, and of which the enjoyment will be improved, by a vaſt acceſſion of images and obſervations which your journeys and various reſidence have enabled you to make and accumulate. You have travelled with this felicity, almoſt peculiar to yourſelf, that your companion is not to part from you at your journey's end; but you are to live on together, to help each other's recollection, and to ſupply each other's omiſſions. The world has few greater pleaſures than that which two friends enjoy, in tracing back, at ſome diſtant time, thoſe tranſactions and events through which they have paſſed together. One of the old man's miſeries is, that he cannot eaſily find a companion able to partake with him of the paſt. You and your fellow-traveller have this comfort in ſtore, that your converſation will be not eaſily exhauſted; one will always be glad to ſay what the other will always be willing to hear.</p>
                     <p>That you may enjoy this pleaſure long, your health muſt have your conſtant attention. I ſuppoſe you purpoſe to return this year. There is no need of haſte: do not come hither before the heighth of ſummer, that you may fall gradually into the inconveniences of your native climate. July ſeems to be the proper month. Auguſt and September will prepare you for the winter. After having travelled ſo far to find health, you muſt take care not to loſe it at home; and I hope a little care will effectually pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.</p>
                     <p>Miſs Nancy has doubtleſs kept a conſtant and copious journal. She muſt not expect to be welcome when ſhe returns without a great maſs of information. Let her review her journal often, and ſet down what ſhe finds herſelf to have omitted, that ſhe may truſt to memory as little as poſſible, for memory is ſoon confuſed by a quick ſucceſſion of things; and ſhe will grow every day leſs confident of the truth of her own narratives, unleſs ſhe can recur to ſome written memorials. If ſhe has ſatisfied herſelf with hints, inſtead of full repreſentations, let her ſupply the deficiencies now while her memory is yet
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0548300102:273"/>
freſh, and while her father's memory may help her. If ſhe obſerves this  direction, ſhe will not have travelled in vain; for ſhe will bring home a book with which ſhe may entertain herſelf to the end of life. If it were not now too late, I would adviſe her to note the impreſſion which the firſt ſight of any thing new and wonderful made upon her mind. Let her now ſet her thoughts down as ſhe can recollect them; for faint as they may already be, they will grow every day fainter.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps I do not flatter myſelf unreaſonably when I imagine that you may wiſh to know ſomething of me. I can gratify your benevolence with no account of health. The hand of time, or of diſeaſe, is very heavy upon me. I paſs reſtleſs and uneaſy nights, harraſſed with convulſions of my breaſt, and flatulencies at my ſtomach; and reſtleſs nights make heavy days. But nothing will be mended by complaints, and therefore I will make an end. When we meet, we will try to forget our cares and our maladies, and contribute, as we can, to the cheerfulneſs of each other. If I had gone with you, I believe I ſhould have been better; but I do not know that it was in my power.</p>

                     <p>SINCE my return to Scotland, I have been again at Lanark, and have had more converſation with Thomſon's ſiſter. It is ſtrange that Murdoch, who was his intimate friend, ſhould have miſtaken his mother's maiden name, which he ſays was Hume, whereas Hume was the name of his grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother by the mother's ſide. His mother's name was Beatrix Trotter <note n="5" place="bottom">Dr. Johnſon was by no means attentive to minute accuracy in his <q rend="inline">"Lives of the Poets;"</q> for notwithſtanding my having detected this miſtake, he has continued it.</note>, a daughter of Mr. Trotter, of Fogo, a ſmall proprietor of land. Thomſon had one brother, whom he had with him in England as his amanuenſis; but he was ſeized with a conſumption, and having returned to Scotland, to try what his native air would do for him, died young. He had three ſiſters, one married to Mr. Bell, miniſter of the pariſh of Strathaven; one to Mr. Craig, father of the ingenious architect, who gave the plan of the New Town of Edinburgh; and one to Mr. Thomſon, maſter of the grammar-ſchool at Lanark. He was of a humane and benevolent diſpoſition; not only ſent valuable preſents to his ſiſters, but an yearly allowance in money, and was always wiſhing to have it in his power to do them more good. Lord Lyttelton's obſervation, that <q rend="inline">'he lothed much to write,'</q> was very true. His letters to his ſiſter, Mrs. Thomſon, were not frequent, and in one of them he ſays, <q rend="inline">'All my friends who know me, know how backward I am to write letters; and never impute the negligence of my hand to the coldneſs of my heart.'</q> I ſend you a copy of the laſt letter which ſhe had from him; ſhe never heard that he had any intention of going into holy orders.

                     <p>I ſend another parcel of Lord Hailes's 'Annals,' which you will pleaſe to return to me as ſoon as you conveniently can.

                  <p>It was in the ſummer of the year 1778, that he complied with my invitation to come down to the Camp at Warley, and he ſtaid with me about a week; the ſcene appeared, notwithſtanding a great degree of ill health that he ſeemed to labour under, to intereſt and amuſe him, as agreeing with the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that I believe you know he conſtantly manifeſted towards enquiring into ſubjects of the military kind. He ſate, with a patient degree of attention, to obſerve the proceedings of a regimental court-martial, that happened to be called in the time of his ſtay with us; and one night, as late as at eleven o'clock, he accompanied the Major of the regiment in going what are ſtyled, the <hi>Rounds;</hi> where he might obſerve the forms of viſiting the guards, for the ſeeing that they and their ſentries are ready in their duty on their ſeveral poſts. He took occaſion to converſe at times on military topicks, one in particular, that I ſee the mention of, in your 'Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,' which lies open before me <note n="6" place="bottom">Third Edition, p. 111.</note>, as to gun-powder; which he ſpoke of to the ſame effect, in part, that you relate.</p>
                  <p>On one occaſion, when the regiment were going through their exerciſe, he went quite cloſe to the men at one of the extremities of it, and watched all their practices attentively; and, when he came away, his remark was, <q rend="inline">'The men indeed do load their muſquets and fire with wonderful celerity.'</q> He was likewiſe particular in requiring to know what was the weight of the muſquet-balls in uſe, and within what diſtance they might be expected to take effect when fired off.</p>
                  <p>In walking among the tents, and obſerving the difference between thoſe of the officers and private men, he ſaid that the ſuperiority of accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the better conditions of life, to that of the inferiour ones, was never exhibited to him in ſo diſtinct a view. The civilities paid to him in the camp were, from the gentlemen of the Lincolnſhire regiment, one of the officers of which accommodated him with a tent in which he ſlept; and from General Hall, who very courteouſly invited him to dine with him, where he appeared to be very well pleaſed with his entertainment, and the civilities he

 received on the part of the General <note n="7" place="bottom">When I one day at Court expreſſed to General Hall my ſenſe of the honour he had done my friend, he politely anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I did <hi>myſelf</hi> honour."</q>
                     </note>; the attention likewiſe of the General's aid-de-camp, Captain Smith, ſeemed to be very welcome to him, as appeared by their engaging in a great deal of diſcourſe together. The gentlemen of the Eaſt York regiment likewiſe on being informed of his coming, ſolicited his company at dinner, but by that time he had fixed his departure, ſo that he could not comply with the invitation.</p>

                     <p>I HAVE received two letters from you, of which the ſecond com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains of the neglect ſhown to the firſt. You muſt not tye your friends to ſuch punctual correſpondence. You have all poſſible aſſurances of my affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and eſteem; and there ought to be no need of reiterated profeſſions. When it may happen that I can give you either counſel or comfort, I hope it will never happen to me that I ſhould neglect you; but you muſt not think me criminal or cold if I ſay nothing, when I have nothing to ſay.</p>
                     <p>You are now happy enough. Mrs. Boſwell is recovered; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate you upon the probability of her long life. If general approbation will add any thing to your enjoyment, I can tell you that I have heard you mentioned as <hi>a man whom every body likes.</hi> I think life has little more to give.</p>
                     <p>—has gone to his regiment. He has laid down his coach, and talks of making more contractions of his expence: how he will ſucceed I know not. It is difficult to reform a houſehold gradually; it may be better done by a ſyſtem totally new. I am afraid he has always ſomething to hide. When we preſſed him to go to—, he objected the neceſſity of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his navigation; yet he could talk of going to Aberdeen, a place not much nearer his navigation. I believe he cannot bear the thought of living at—in a ſtate of diminution; and of appearing among the gentlemen of the neighbourhood <hi>ſhorn of his beams.</hi> This is natural, but it is cowardly. What I told him of the encreaſing expence of a growing family ſeems to have ſtruck him. He certainly had gone on with very confuſed views, and we have, I think, ſhown him that he is wrong; though, with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon deficience of adviſers, we have not ſhown him how to do right.</p>

I wiſh you would a little correct or reſtrain your imagination, and  imagine that happineſs, ſuch as life admits, may be had at other places as well as London. Without aſſerting Stoiciſm, it may be ſaid, that it is our buſineſs to exempt ourſelves as much as we can from the power of external things. There is but one ſolid baſis of happineſs; and that is, the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able hope of a happy futurity. This may be had every where.</p>
                     <p>I do not blame your preference of London to other places, for it is really to be preferred, if the choice is free; but few have the choice of their place, or their manner of life; and mere pleaſure ought not to be the prime motive of action.</p>

                     <p>GARRICK's death is a ſtriking event; not that we ſhould be ſurpriſed with the death of any man, who has lived ſixty-two years. But becauſe there was a <hi>vivacity</hi> in our late celebrated friend, which drove away the thoughts of <hi>death</hi> from any aſſociation with <hi>him;</hi> I am ſure you will be tenderly affected with his departure; and I would wiſh to hear from you upon the ſubject. I was obliged to him in my days of efferveſcence in London, when poor Derrick was my governour; and ſince that time I received many civilities from him. Do you remember how pleaſing it was, when I received a letter from him at Inverary, upon our firſt return to civilized living after our Hebridean journey. I ſhall always remember him with affection as well as admiration.</p>
                     <p>On Saturday laſt, being the 30th of January, I drank coffee and old port, and had ſolemn converſation with the Reverend Mr. Falconer, a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring biſhop, a very learned and worthy man. He gave two toaſts, which you will believe I drank with cordiality, Dr. Samuel Johnſon, and Flora Macdonald. I ſat about four hours with him, and it was really as if I had been living in the laſt century. The Epiſcopal Church of Scotland, though faithful to the royal houſe of Stuart, has never accepted of any <hi>congé d'élire,</hi> ſince the Revolution; it is the only true Epiſcopal Church in Scotland, as it has its own ſucceſſion of biſhops. For as to the epiſcopal clergy who take the oaths to the preſent government, they indeed follow the rites of the Church of England, but, as Biſhop Falconer obſerved, they are not <hi>Epiſcopals;</hi> for they are under no biſhop, as a biſhop cannot have authority beyond his dioceſe.</p>

               <p>This letter croſſed me on the road to London, where I arrived on Monday, March 15, and next morning at a late hour, found Dr. Johnſon ſitting over
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0548300102:284" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 his tea, attended by Mrs. Deſmoulins, Mr. Levett, and a clergyman, who had come to ſubmit ſome poetical pieces to his reviſion. It is wonderful what a number and variety of writers, ſome of them even unknown to him, prevailed on his good-nature to look over their works, and ſuggeſt corrections and improvements. My arrival interrupted for a little while, the important buſineſs of this true repreſentative of Bayes; upon its being reſumed, I found that the ſubject under immediate conſideration was a tranſlation, yet in manuſcript, of the <hi>Carmen Seculare</hi> of Horace, which had this year been ſet to muſick, and performed as a publick entertainment in London, for the joint benefit of Monſieur Philidor and Signor Baretti. When Johnſon had done reading, the authour aſked him bluntly, <q rend="inline">"If upon the whole it was a good tranſlation?"</q> Johnſon, whoſe regard for truth was uncommonly ſtrict, ſeemed to be puzzled for a moment, what anſwer to make, as he certainly could not honeſtly commend the performance: with exquiſite addreſs he evaded the queſtion thus, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I do not ſay that it may not be made a very good tranſlation."</q> Here nothing whatever in favour of the performance was affirmed, and yet the writer was not ſhocked. A printed <q rend="inline">"Ode to the Warlike Genius of Britain,"</q> came next in review; the bard was a lank bony figure, with ſhort black hair; he was writhing himſelf in agitation, while Johnſon read, and ſhewing his teeth in a grin of earneſtneſs, exclaimed in broken ſentences, and in a keen ſharp tone, <q rend="inline">"Is that poetry, Sir?—Is it Pindar?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, there is here a great deal of what is called poetry."</q> Then turning to me, the poet cried, <q rend="inline">"My muſe has not been long upon the town, and (pointing to the Ode) it trembles under the hand of the great critick."</q> Johnſon in a tone of diſpleaſure aſked him, <q rend="inline">"Why do you praiſe Anſon?"</q> I did not trouble him by aſking his reaſon for this queſtion. He proceeded, <q rend="inline">"Here is an errour, Sir; you have made Genius feminine."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Palpable, Sir; (cried the enthuſiaſt) I know it. But (in a lower tone) it was to pay a compliment to the Ducheſs of Devonſhire, with which her Grace was pleaſed. She is walking acroſs Coxheath, in the military uniform, and I ſuppoſe her to be the Genius of Britain."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir you are giving a reaſon for it, but that will not make it right. You may have a reaſon why two and two ſhould make five; but they will ſtill make but four."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Although I was ſeveral times with him in the courſe of the following days, ſuch it ſeems were my occupations, or ſuch my negligence, that I have preſerved no memorial of his converſation till Friday, March 26, when I viſited him. He ſaid he expected to be attacked on account of his
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0548300102:285" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"Lives of the Poets."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"However (ſaid he) I would rather be attacked  than unnoticed. For the worſt thing you can do to an authour is to be ſilent as to his works. An aſſault upon a town is a bad thing; but ſtarving it is ſtill worſe; an aſſault may be unſucceſsful; you may have more men killed than you kill; but if you ſtarve the town you are ſure of a victory."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of a friend of our's aſſociating with perſons of very diſcordant principles and characters; I ſaid he was a very univerſal man, quite a man of the world. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; but one may be ſo much a man of the world as to be nothing in the world. I remember a paſſage in Goldſmith's 'Vicar of Wakefield,' which he was afterwards fool enough to expunge: 'I do not love a man who is zealous for nothing."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"That was a fine paſſage."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir: there was another fine paſſage too, which he ſtruck out: 'When I was a young man, being anxious to diſtinguiſh myſelf, I was perpetually ſtarting new propoſitions. But I ſoon gave this over; for, I found that generally what was new was falſe."</q> I ſaid I did not like to ſit with people of whom I had not a good opinion. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But you muſt not indulge your delicacy too much; or you will be a <hi>tête à tête</hi> man all your life."</q>
               </p>
               <p>During my ſtay in London, this ſpring, I find I was unaccountably negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in preſerving Johnſon's ſayings, more ſo than at any time when I was happy enough to have an opportunity of hearing his wiſdom and wit. There is no help for it now. I muſt content myſelf with preſenting ſuch ſcraps as I have. But I am nevertheleſs aſhamed and vexed to think how much has been loſt. It is not that there was a bad crop this year; but that I was not ſufficiently careful in gathering it in. I, therefore, in ſome inſtances can only exhibit a few detached fragments.</p>
               <p>Talking of the wonderful concealment of the authour of the celebrated letters ſigned <hi>Junius;</hi> he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I ſhould have believed Burke to be Junius, becauſe I know no man but Burke who is capable of writing theſe letters; but Burke ſpontaneouſly denied it to me. The caſe would have been different had I aſked him if he was the authour; a man ſo queſtioned, as to an anonymous publication, may think he has a right to deny it.</q>
               </p>
               <p>He obſerved that his old friend, Mr. Sheridan, had been honoured with extraordinary attention in his own country, by having had an exception made in his favour in an Iriſh Act of Parliament concerning inſolvent debtors. <q rend="inline">"To be thus ſingled out (ſaid he) by a legiſlature, as an object of publick conſideration and kindneſs, is a proof of no common merit."</q>

 At Streatham, on Monday, March 29, at breakfaſt he maintained that a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> father had no right to control the inclinations of his daughters in marriage.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, March 31, when I viſited him, and confeſſed an exceſs of which I had very ſeldom been guilty; that I had ſpent a whole night in play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at cards, and that I could not look back on it with ſatisfaction. Inſtead of a harſh animadverſion, he mildly ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Alas, Sir, on how few things can we look back with ſatisfaction."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Thurſday, April 1, he commended one of the Dukes of Devonſhire for <q rend="inline">"a dogged veracity <note n="3" place="bottom">See p. 165 of this Volume.</note>."</q> He ſaid too, <q rend="inline">"London is nothing to ſome peoples<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but to a man whoſe pleaſure is intellectual, London is the place. And there is no place where oeconomy can be ſo well practiſed as in London. More can be had here for the money, even by ladies, than any where elſe. You cannot play tricks with your fortune in a ſmall place; you muſt make an uniform appearance. Here a lady may have well-furniſhed apartments, and elegant dreſs, without any meat in her kitchen."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I was amuſed by conſidering with how much eaſe and coolneſs he could write or talk to a friend, exhorting him not to ſuppoſe that happineſs was not to be found as well in other places as in London; when he himſelf was at all times ſenſible of its being, comparatively ſpeaking, a heaven upon earth. The truth is, that by thoſe who from ſagacity, attention, and experience, have learnt the full advantage of London, its pre-eminence over every other place, not only for variety of enjoyment, but for comfort, will be<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>felt with a philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical exultation. The freedom from remark and petty cenſure, with which life may be paſſed there, is a circircumſtance which a man who knows the teizing reſtraint of a narrow circle muſt reliſh highly. Mr. Burke, whoſe orderly and amiable domeſtick habits might make the eye of obſervation leſs irkſome to him than to moſt men, ſaid once very pleaſantly, in my hearing, <q rend="inline">"Though I have the honour to repreſent Briſtol, I ſhould not like to live there; I ſhould be obliged to be ſo much <hi>upon my good behaviour:</hi>"</q> In London, a man may live in ſplendid ſociety at one time, and in frugal retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment another, without animadverſion. There, and there alone, a man's own houſe is truly his <hi>caſtle,</hi> in which he can be in perfect ſafety from intruſion whenever he pleaſes. I never ſhall forget how well this was expreſſed to me one day by Mr. Meynell: <q rend="inline">"The chief advantage of London (ſaid he) is, that a man is always <hi>ſo near his burrow.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid of one of his old acquaintances, <q rend="inline">"He is very fit for a travelling governour. He knows French very well. He is a man of good principles;
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0548300102:287" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and there would be no danger that a young gentleman ſhould catch his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;  for it is ſo very bad, that it muſt be avoided. In that reſpect he would be like the drunken Helot."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Friday, April 2, being Good-Friday, I viſited him in the morning as uſual; and finding that we inſenſibly fell into a train of ridicule upon the foibles of one of our friends, a very worthy man, I, by way of a check, quoted ſome good admonition from <q rend="inline">"The Government of the Tongue,"</q> that very pious book. It happened alſo remarkably enough, that the ſubject of the ſermon preached to us to-day by Dr. Burrows, the rector of St. Clement Danes, upon the certainty that at the laſt day we muſt give an account of <q rend="inline">"the deeds done in the body;"</q> and, amongſt various acts of culpability he mentioned evil-ſpeaking. As we were moving ſlowly along in the croud from church, Johnſon jogged my elbow, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Did you attend to the ſermon?"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, (ſaid I,) it was very applicable to <hi>us.</hi>"</q> He, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſtood upon the defenſive. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, the ſenſe of ridicule is given us, and may be lawfully uſed. The authour of 'The Government of the Tongue' would have us to treat all men alike."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the interval between morning and evening ſervice, he endeavoured to employ himſelf earneſtly in devotional exerciſes; and, as he has mentioned in his <q rend="inline">"Prayers and Meditations <note n="4" place="bottom">Page 17<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it to me is marked upon it with his own hand, and I have found in it a truly divine unction. We went to church again in the afternoon.</p>
               <p>On Saturday, April 3, I viſited him at night, and found him ſitting in Mrs. Williams's room, with her, and one who he afterwards told me was a natural ſon of the ſecond Lord Southwell. The table had a ſingular appearance, being covered with a heterogeneous aſſemblage of oyſters and porter for his company, and tea for himſelf. I mentioned my having heard an eminent phyſician, who was himſelf a Chriſtian, argue in favour of univerſal toleration, and maintain, that no man could be hurt by another man's differing from him in opinion. JOHNSON <q rend="inline">"Sir, you are to a certain degree hurt by knowing that even one man does not believe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Eaſter-day, after ſolemn ſervice at St. Paul's, I dined with him: Mr. Allen the printer was alſo his gueſt. He was uncommonly ſilent; and I have not written down any thing, except a ſingle curious fact, which, having the ſanction of his inflexible veracity, may be received as a ſtriking inſtance of human inſenſibility and inconſideration. As he was paſſing by a fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0548300102:288" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 who was ſkinning an eel alive, he heard him <q rend="inline">"curſe it, becauſe it would not lye ſtill."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, April 7, I dined with him at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's. I have not marked what company was there. Johnſon harangued upon the qualities of different liquors; and ſpoke with great contempt of claret, as ſo weak, that <q rend="inline">"a man would be drowned by it before it made him drunk."</q> He was perſuaded to drink one glaſs of it, that he might judge, not from recollection, which might be dim, but from immediate ſenſation. He ſhook his head, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Poor ſtuff. No, Sir, claret is the liquor for boys; port, for men: but he who aſpires to be a hero (ſmiling) muſt drink brandy. In the firſt place, the flavour of brandy is moſt grateful to the palate; and then brandy will do ſooneſt for a man what drinking <hi>can</hi> do for him. There are, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ndeed, few who are able to drink brandy. That is a power rather to be wiſhed for than attained. And yet (proceeded he) as in all pleaſure hope is a conſiderable part, I know not but fruition comes too quick by brandy. Florence wine I think the worſt; it is wine only to the eye; it is wine neither while you are drinking it, nor after you have drunk it; it neither pleaſes the taſte, nor exhilarates the ſpirits."</q> I reminded him how heartily he and I uſed to drink wine together when we were firſt acquainted; and how I uſed to have a head-ache after ſitting up with him. He did not like to have this recalled, or, perhaps, thinking that I boaſted improperly, reſolved to have a witty ſtroke at me: <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, it was not the <hi>wine</hi> that made your head ache, but the <hi>ſenſe</hi> that I put into it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"What, Sir! will ſenſe make the head ache?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, (with a ſmile) when it is not uſed to it."</q> No man who has a true reliſh of pleaſantry could be offended at this; eſpecially if Johnſon in a long intimacy had given him repeated proofs of his regard and good eſtimation. I uſed to ſay, that as he had given me a thouſand pounds in praiſe, he had a good right now and then to take a guinea from me.</p>
               <p>On Thurſday, April 8, I dined with him at Mr. Allan Ramſay's, with Lord Graham and ſome other company. We talked of Shakſpeare's witches. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"They are beings of his own creation; they are a compound of malignity and meanneſs, without any abilities; and are quite different from the Italian magician. King James ſays, in his 'Daemonology,' 'Magicians command the devils; witches are their ſervants.' The Italian magicians are elegant beings."</q> RAMSAY. <q rend="inline">"Opera witches, not Drury-lane witches."</q> Johnſon obſerved, that abilities might be employed in a narrow ſphere, as in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:0548300102:289" rendition="simple:additions"/>
getting money, which he ſaid he believed no man could do, without vigorous  parts, though concentrated to a point. RAMSAY. <q rend="inline">"Yes, like a ſtrong horſe in a mill: he pulls better."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lord Graham, while he praiſed the beauty of Lochlomond, on the banks of which is his family ſeat, complained of the climate, and ſaid he could not bear it. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, my Lord, don't talk ſo: you may bear it well enough. Your anceſtors have borne it more years than I can tell."</q> This was a handſome compliment to the antiquity of the houſe of Montroſe. His Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip told me afterwards, that he had only affected to complain of the climate; leſt, if he had ſpoken as favourably of his country as he really thought, Dr. Johnſon might have attacked it. Johnſon was very courteous to Lady Margaret Macdonald. <q rend="inline">"Madam, (ſaid he,) when I was in the Iſle of Sky, I heard of the people running to take the ſtones off the road, leſt Lady Margaret's horſe ſhould ſtumble."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lord Graham commended Dr. Drummond at Naples, as a man of extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary talents; and added, that he had a great love of liberty. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He is <hi>young,</hi> my Lord; (looking to his Lordſhip with an arch ſmile) all <hi>boys</hi> love liberty, till experience convinces them they are not ſo fit to govern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as they imagined. We are all agreed as to our own liberty; we would have as much of it as we can get; but we are not agreed as to the liberty of others: for in proportion as we take, others muſt loſe.

               <p>On Friday, April 16, I had been preſent at the trial of the unfortunate Mr. Hackman, who, in a fit of frantick jealous love, had ſhot Miſs Ray, the favourite of a nobleman. Johnſon, in whoſe company I dined to-day, with ſome other friends, was much intereſted by my account of what paſſed, and particularly with his prayer for the mercy of heaven. He ſaid, in a ſolemn fervid tone, <q rend="inline">"I hope he <hi>ſhall</hi> find mercy."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This day a violent altercation aroſe between Johnſon and Beauclerk, which having made much noiſe at the time, I think it proper, in order to prevent any future miſrepreſentation, to give a minute account of it.</p>
               <p>In talking of Hackman, Johnſon argued, as Judge Blackſtone had done, that his being furniſhed with two piſtols was a proof that he meant to ſhoot two perſons. Mr. Beauclerk ſaid, <q rend="inline">"No; for that every wiſe man who intended to ſhoot himſelf, took two piſtols, that he might be ſure of doing it
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:0548300102:290" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 at once. Lord—'s cook ſhot himſelf with one piſtol, and lived ten days in great agony. Mr.—, who loved buttered muffins, but durſt not eat them becauſe they diſagreed with his ſtomach, reſolved to ſhoot himſelf; and then he eat three buttered muffins for breakfaſt, before ſhooting himſelf, knowing that he ſhould not be troubled with indigeſtion: <hi>he</hi> had two charged piſtols; one was found lying charged upon the table by him, after he had ſhot himſelf with the other."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Well, (ſaid Johnſon, with an air of triumph,) you ſee here one piſtol was ſufficient."</q> Beauclerk replied ſmartly, <q rend="inline">"Becauſe it happened to kill him."</q> And either then, or a very little afterwards, being piqued at Johnſon's triumphant remark, added, <q rend="inline">"This is what you don't know, and I do."</q> There was then a ceſſation of the diſpute; and ſome minutes intervened, during which, dinner and the glaſs went on cheerfully; when Johnſon ſuddenly and abruptly exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"Mr. Beauclerk, how came you to talk ſo petulantly to me, as 'This is what you don't know, but what I know?' One thing <hi>I</hi> know which <hi>you</hi> don't ſeem to know, that you are very uncivil."</q> BEAUCLERK. <q rend="inline">"Becauſe <hi>you</hi> began by being uncivil, (which you always are)."</q> The words in parentheſis were, I believe, not heard by Dr. Johnſon. Here again there was a ceſſation of arms. Johnſon told me, that the reaſon why he waited ſome time at firſt without taking any notice of what Mr. Beauclerk ſaid, was becauſe he was thinking whether he ſhould reſent it. But when he conſidered that there were preſent a young Lord and an eminent traveller, two men of the world with whom he had never dined before, he was apprehenſive that they might think they had a right to take ſuch liberties with him as Beauclerk did, and therefore reſolved he would not let it paſs; adding, that <q rend="inline">"he would not appear a coward."</q> A little while after this, the converſation turned on the violence of Hackman's temper. Johnſon then ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It was his buſineſs to <hi>command</hi> his temper, as my friend Mr. Beauclerk ſhould have done ſome time time ago."</q> BEAUCLERK. <q rend="inline">"I ſhould learn of <hi>you,</hi> Sir."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you have given <hi>me</hi> opportunities enough of learning, when I have been in <hi>your</hi> company. No man loves to be treated with contempt."</q> BEAUCLERK. (with a polite inclination towards Johnſon) <q rend="inline">"Sir, you have known me twenty years, and however I may have treated others, you may be ſure I could never treat you with contempt."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you have ſaid more than was neceſſary."</q> Thus it ended; and Beauclerk's coach not having come for him till very late, Dr. Johnſon and another gentleman ſat with him a long time after the reſt of the company were gone; and he and I dined at Beauclerk's on the Saturday ſe'nnight following.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="289" facs="tcp:0548300102:291" rendition="simple:additions"/>
After this tempeſt had ſubſided, I recollect the following particulars of his  converſation:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I am always for getting a boy forward in his learning; for that is a ſure good. I would let him at firſt read <hi>any</hi> Engliſh book which happens to engage his attention; becauſe you have done a great deal when you have brought him to have entertainment from a book. He'll get better books afterwards."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Mallet, I believe, never wrote a ſingle line of his projected Life of the Duke of Marlborough. He groped for materials; and thought of it, till he had exhauſted his mind. Thus it ſometimes happens that men entangle themſelves in their own ſchemes."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"To be contradicted, in order to force you to talk, is mighty unpleaſing. You <hi>ſhine,</hi> indeed; but it is by being <hi>ground.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Of a gentleman who made ſome figure among the <hi>Literati</hi> of his time, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"What eminence he had was by a felicity of manner: he had no more learning than what he could not help."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Saturday, April 24, I dined with him at Mr. Beauclerk's, with Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Mr. Jones, (now Sir William,) Mr. Langton, Mr. Steevens, Mr. Paradiſe, and Dr. Higgins. I mentioned that a Mr. Wilkes had attached Garrick to me, as a man who had no friend. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I believe he is right, Sir. <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>.—He had friends, but no friend. Garrick was ſo diffuſed, he had no man to whom he wiſhed to unboſom himſelf. He found people always ready to applaud him, and that always for the ſame thing: ſo he ſaw life with great uniformity."</q> I took upon me, for once, to fight with Goliath's weapons, and play the ſophiſt.—<q rend="inline">"Garrick did not need a friend, as he got from every body all he wanted. What is a friend? One who ſupports you and comforts you, while others do not. Friendſhip, you know, Sir, is the cordial drop, 'to make the nauſeous draught of life go down:' but if the draught be not nauſeous, if it be all ſweet, there is no occaſion for that drop."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Many men would not be content to live ſo. I hope I ſhould not. They would wiſh to have an intimate friend, with whom they might compare minds, and cheriſh private virtues."</q> One of the company mentioned Lord Cheſterfield, as a man who had no friend. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"There were more materials to make friendſhip in Garrick, had he not been ſo diffuſed."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Garrick was pure gold, but beat out to thin leaf. Lord Cheſterfield was tinſel."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Garrick was a very good man, the cheerfulleſt man of his age; a decent liver in a profeſſion which is ſuppoſed to give indulgence to licentiouſneſs; and a man who gave away, freely, money acquired by himſelf. He began the world with a great
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0548300102:292" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 hunger for money; the ſon of a half-pay officer, bred in a family whoſe ſtudy was to make four-pence do as much as others made four-pence halfpenny do. But, when he had got money, he was very liberal."</q>—I preſumed to animadvert on his eulogy on Garrick, in his <q rend="inline">"Lives of the Poets."</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"You ſay, Sir, his death eclipſed the gaiety of nations."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I could not have ſaid more nor leſs. It is the truth; <hi>eclipſed,</hi> not <hi>extinguiſhed;</hi> and his death <hi>did</hi> eclipſe; it was like a ſtorm."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But why nations? Did his gaiety extend farther than his own nation?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, ſome exaggeration muſt be allowed. Beſides, nations may be ſaid if we allow the Scotch to be a nation, and to have gaiety, which they have not. <hi>You</hi> are an exception though. Come, gentlemen, let us candidly admit that there is one Scotchman who is cheerful."</q> BEAUCLERK. <q rend="inline">"But he is a very unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Scotchman."</q> I, however, continued to think the compliment to Garrick hyperbolically untrue. His acting had ceaſed ſome time before his death; at any rate he had acted in Ireland but a ſhort time, at an early period of his life, and never in Scotland. I objected alſo to what appears an anticlymax of praiſe, when contraſted with the preceding panegyrick—<q rend="inline">"and diminiſhed the publick ſtock of harmleſs pleaſure!"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Is not <hi>harmleſs pleaſure</hi> very tame?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, harmleſs pleaſure is the higheſt praiſe. Pleaſure is a word of dubious import; pleaſure is in general dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, and pernicious to virtue; to be able therefore to furniſh pleaſure that is harmleſs, pleaſure pure and unalloyed, is as great a power as man can poſſeſs."</q> This was, perhaps, as ingenious a defence as could be made; ſtill, however, I was not ſatisfied.</p>
               <p>A celebrated wit being mentioned, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"One may ſay of him as was ſaid of a French wit, <hi>Il n'a de l'eſprit que contre Dieu.</hi> I have been ſeveral times in company with him, but never perceived any ſtrong power of wit. He produces a general effect by various means; he has a chearful countenance and a gay voice; beſides his trade is wit. It would be as wild in him to come into company without merriment, as for a highwayman to take the road without his piſtols."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of the effects of drinking, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Drinking may be practiſed with great prudence; a man who expoſes himſelf when he is intoxicated, has not the art of getting drunk; a ſober man who happens occaſionally to get drunk, readily enough goes into a new company, which a man who has been drinking ſhould never do. Such a man will undertake any thing; he is without ſkill in inebriation. I uſed to ſlink home when I had drunk too much. A man accuſtomed to ſelf-examination will be conſcious when he is
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:0548300102:293" rendition="simple:additions"/>
drunk, though an habitual drunkard will not be conſcious of it. I knew a  phyſician who for twenty years was not ſober; yet in a pamphlet, which he wrote upon fevers, he appealed to Garrick and me for his vindication from a charge of drunkenneſs. A bookſeller (naming him) who got a large fortune by trade, was ſo habitually and equably drunk, that his moſt intimate friends never perceived that he was more ſober at one time than another."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of celebrated and ſucceſsful irregular practiſers in phyſick; he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Taylor was the moſt ignorant man I ever knew; but ſprightly. Ward the dulleſt. Taylor challenged me once to talk Latin with him; (laughing). I quoted ſome of Horace, which he took to be a part of my own ſpeech. He ſaid a few words well enough."</q> BEAUCLERK. <q rend="inline">"I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, Sir, you ſaid that Taylor was an inſtance how far impudence could carry ignorance."</q> Mr. Beauclerk was very entertaining this day, and told us a number of ſhort ſtories in a lively elegant manner, and with that air of <hi>the world</hi> which has I know not what impreſſive effect, as if there were ſomething more than is expreſſed, or than perhaps we could perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. As Johnſon and I accompanied Sir Joſhua Reynolds in his coach, Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"There is in Beauclerk a predominance over his company, that one does not like. But he is a man who has lived ſo much in the world, that he has a ſhort ſtory on every occaſion; he is always ready to talk and is never exhauſted."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon and I paſſed the evening at Miſs Reynolds's, Sir Joſhua's ſiſter. I mentioned that an eminent friend of our's talking of the common remark, that affection deſcends, ſaid that <q rend="inline">"this was wiſely contrived for the preſervation of mankind; for which it was not ſo neceſſary that there ſhould be affection from children to parents, as from parents to children; nay there would be no harm in that view though children ſhould at a certain age eat their parents."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, if this were known generally to be the caſe, parents would not have affection for children."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"True, Sir; for it is in expectation of a return that parents are ſo attentive to their children; and I know a very pretty inſtance of a little girl of whom her father was very fond, who once when he was in a melancholy fit, and had gone to bed, perſuaded him to riſe in good-humour, by ſaying, 'My dear papa, pleaſe to get up, and let me help you on with your clothes, that I may learn to do it when you are an old man."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after this time a little incident occurred, which I will not ſuppreſs, be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>cauſe I am deſirous that my work ſhould be, as much as is conſiſtent with the ſtricteſt truth, an antidote to the falſe and injurious notions of his character,
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:0548300102:294" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 which have been given by others, and therefore I infuſe every drop of genuine ſweetneſs into my biographical cup.</p>

               <p>He came to me in the evening, and brought Sir Joſhua Reynolds. I need ſcarcely ſay, that their converſation, while they ſate by my bedſide, was the moſt pleaſing opiate to pain that could have been adminiſtered.</p>
               <p>Johnſon being now better diſpoſed to obtain information concerning Pope than he was laſt year <note n="3" place="bottom">See p. 260 of this Volume.</note>, ſent by me to my Lord Marchmont, a preſent of thoſe volumes of his <q rend="inline">"Lives of the Poets,"</q> which were at this time publiſhed, with a requeſt to have permiſſion to wait on him, and his Lordſhip, who had called on him twice, obligingly appointed Saturday, the firſt of May, for receiving us.</p>
               <p>On that morning Johnſon came to me from Streatham, and after drinking chocolate, at General Paoli's, in South-Audley-ſtreet, we proceeded to Lord Marchmont's, in Curzon-ſtreet.

was as agreeable as I could have wiſhed.

               <p>Mr. Weſley being in the courſe of his miniſtry at Edinburgh, I preſented this letter to him, and was very politely received. I begged to have it returned to me, which was accordingly done. His ſtate of the evidence as to the ghoſt, did not ſatisfy me.</p>
               <p>I did not write to Johnſon, as uſual, upon my return to my family; but tried how he would be affected by my ſilence. Mr. Dilly ſent me a copy of a note which he received from him on the 13th of July, in theſe words:

I went into the country, and returned; and yet there is no letter from Mr. Boſwell. No ill I hope has happened; and if ill ſhould happen, why ſhould it be concealed from him who loves you? Is it a fit of humour, that has diſpoſed you to try who can hold out longeſt without writing? if it be, you have the victory. But I am afraid of ſomething bad; ſet me free from my ſuſpicions.</p>

                     <p>WHAT may be juſtly denominated a ſupine indolence of mind has been my ſtate of exiſtence ſince I laſt returned to Scotland. In a livelier ſtate I had often ſuffered ſeverely from long intervals of ſilence on your part; and I had even been chid by you for expreſſing my uneaſineſs. I was willing to take advantage of my inſenſibility, and while I could bear the experiment, to try whether your affection for me, would, after an unuſual ſilence on my part, make you write firſt. This afternoon I have had very high ſatisfaction by receiving your kind letter of inquiry, for which I moſt gratefully thank you. I am doubtful if it was right to make the experiment; though I have gained by it. I was beginning to grow tender, and to upbraid myſelf, eſpecially after having dreamt two nights ago that I was with you. I and my wife, and my four children, are all well. I would not delay one poſt to anſwer your letter; but as it is late, I have not time to do more. You ſhall ſoon hear from me, upon many and various particulars; and I ſhall never again put you to any teſt.</p>

 On the 22d of July, I wrote to him again; and gave him an account of my laſt interview with my worthy friend, Mr. Edward Dilly, at his brother's houſe at Southill, in Bedfordſhire, where he died ſoon after I parted from him, leaving me a very kind remembrance of his regard.</p>
               <p>I informed him that Lord Hailes, who had promiſed to furniſh him with ſome anecdotes for his <q rend="inline">"Lives of the Poets,"</q> had ſent me three inſtances of Prior's borrowing from <hi>Gombauld,</hi> in <q rend="inline">"Recueil des Poetes,"</q> tome 3.

                        <p>ARE you playing the ſame trick again, and trying who can keep ſilence longeſt? Remember that all tricks are either knaviſh or childiſh; and that it is as fooliſh to make experiments upon the conſtancy of a friend, as upon the chaſtity of a wife.</p>
                        <p>What can be the cauſe of this ſecond fit of ſilence, I cannot conjecture; but after one trick, I will not be cheated by another, nor will harraſs my thoughts with conjectures about the motives of a man who, probably, acts only by caprice. I therefore ſuppoſe you are well, and that Mrs. Boſwell is well too; and that the fine ſummer has reſtored Lord Auchinleck. I am much better than you left me; I think I am better than when I was in Scotland.</p>
                        <p>I forgot whether I informed you that poor Thrale has been in great danger. Mrs. Thrale likewiſe has miſcarried, and been much indiſpoſed.

                        <p>Mr. Thrale goes to Brighthelmſton, about Michaelmas, to be jolly and ride a hunting. I ſhall go to town, or perhaps to Oxford. Exerciſe and gaiety, or rather careleſſneſs, will, I hope, diſſipate all remains of his malady;

               <p>On the 20th of September I defended myſelf againſt his ſuſpicion of me, which I did not deſerve; and I added, <q rend="inline">"Pray let us write frequently.

               <p>My friend Colonel James Stuart, ſecond ſon of the Earl of Bute, who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf as a good officer of the Bedfordſhire militia, had taken a publick-ſpirited reſolution to ſerve his country in its difficulties, by raiſing a regular regiment, and taking the command of it himſelf. This, in the heir of the immenſe property of Wortley, was highly honourable. Having been in Scotland recruiting, he obligingly aſked me to accompany him to Leeds, then the head-quarters of his corps; from thence to London for a ſhort time, and afterwards to other places to which the regiment might be ordered. Such an offer, at a time of the year when I had full leiſure, was very pleaſing; eſpecially as I was to accompany a man of ſterling good ſenſe, information, diſcernment, and conviviality; and was to have a ſecond crop, in one year, of London and Johnſon. Of this I informed my illuſtrious friend,
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0548300102:300" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 in characteriſtical warm terms, in a letter dated the 30th of September, from Leeds.</p>
               <p>On Monday, October 4, I called at his houſe before he was up. He ſent for me to his bedſide, and expreſſed his ſatisfaction at this incidental meeting, with as much vivacity as if he had been in the gaiety of youth. He called briſkly, <q rend="inline">"Frank, go and get coffee, and let us breakfaſt in ſplendour."</q>
               </p>
               <p>During this viſit to London I had ſeveral interviews with him, which it is unneceſſary to diſtinguiſh particularly. I conſulted him as to the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of guardians to my children, in caſe of my death. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) do not appoint a number of guardians. When they are many, they truſt one to another, and the buſineſs is neglected. I would adviſe you to chooſe only one; let him be a man of reſpectable character, who, for his own credit, will do what is right; let him be a rich man, ſo that he may be under no temptation to take advantage; and let him be a man of buſineſs, who is uſed to conduct affairs with ability and expertneſs, to whom, therefore, the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the truſt will not be burthenſome."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Sunday, October 10, we dined together at Mr. Strahan's. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation having turned on the prevailing practice of going to the Eaſt-Indies in queſt of wealth;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"A man had better have ten thouſand pounds at the end of ten years paſſed in England, than twenty thouſand pounds at the end of ten years paſſed in India, becauſe you muſt compute what you <hi>give</hi> for money; and a man who has lived ten years in India, has given up ten years of ſocial comfort and all thoſe advantages which ariſe from living in England. The ingenious Mr. Brown, diſtinguiſhed by the name of <hi>Capability Brown,</hi> told me, that he was once at the ſeat of Lord Clive, who had returned from India with great wealth; and that he ſhewed him at the door of his bed-chamber a large cheſt, which he ſaid he had once had full of gold; upon which Brown obſerved, 'I am glad you can bear it ſo near your bed-chamber."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of the ſtate of the poor in London.—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Saunders Welch, the Juſtice, who was once High-Conſtable of Holborn, and had the beſt opportunities of knowing the ſtate of the poor, told me, that I under-rated the number, when I computed that twenty a week, that is, above a thouſand a year, died of hunger; not abſolutely of immediate hunger, but of the waſting and other diſeaſes which are the conſequences of hunger. This hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens only in ſo large a place as London, where people are not known. What we are told about the great ſums got by begging is not true: the trade is overſtocked. And, you may depend upon it, there are many who
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0548300102:301" rendition="simple:additions"/>
cannot get work. A particular kind of manufacture fails. Thoſe who have  been uſed to work at it can, for ſome time, work at nothing elſe. You meet a man begging; you charge him with idleneſs: he ſays, 'I am willing to labour. Will you give me work?'—'I cannot.'—'Why then you have no right to charge me with idleneſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We left Mr. Strahan's at ſeven, as Johnſon had ſaid he intended to go to evening prayers. As we walked along, he complained of a little gout in his toe, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I ſhan't go to prayers to-night; I ſhall go to-morrow. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I miſs church on a Sunday, I reſolve to go another day. But I do not always do it."</q> This was a fair exhibition of that vibration between pious reſolutions and indolence, which many of us have too often experienced.</p>
               <p>I went home with him, and we had a long quiet converſation.</p>
               <p>I read him a letter from Dr. Hugh Blair, concerning Pope, (in writing whoſe life he was now employed,) which I ſhall inſert as a literary curioſity <note n="6" place="bottom">The Reverend Dr. Law, Biſhop of Carliſle, in the Preface to his valuable edition of Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop King's <q rend="inline">"Eſſay on the Origin of Evil,"</q> mentions that the principles maintained in it had been adopted by Pope in his <q rend="inline">"Eſſay on Man;"</q> and adds, <q rend="inline">"The fact, notwithſtanding ſuch denial, (Biſhop Warburton's,) might have been ſtrictly verified by an unexceptionable teſtimony, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the late Lord Bathurſt, who ſaw the very ſame ſyſtem of the <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>IN the year 1763, being at London, I was carried by Dr. John Blair, Prebendary of Weſtminſter, to dine at old Lord Bathurſt's; where we found the late Mr. Mallet, Sir James Porter, who had been Ambaſſadour at Conſtantinople, the late Dr. Macaulay, and two or three more. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation turning on Mr. Pope, Lord Bathurſt told us, that 'The Eſſay on Man' was originally compoſed by Lord Bolingbroke in proſe, and that Mr. Pope did no more than put it into verſe: that he had read Lord Bolingbroke's manuſcript in his own hand-writing; and remembered well, that he was at a loſs whether moſt to admire the elegance of Lord Bolingbroke's proſe, or the beauty of Mr. Pope's verſe. When Lord Bathurſt told this, Mr. Mallet bade me attend, and remember this remarkable piece of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as, by the courſe of Nature, I might ſurvive his Lordſhip, and be a
<pb n="300" facs="tcp:0548300102:302" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 witneſs of his having ſaid ſo. The converſation was indeed too remarkable to be forgotten. A few days after, meeting with you, who were then alſo at London, you will remember that I mentioned to you what had paſſed on this ſubject, as I was much ſtruck with this anecdote. But what aſcertains my recollection of it beyond doubt, is, that being accuſtomed to keep a journal of what paſſed when I was at London, which I wrote out every evening, I find the particulars of the above information, juſt as I have now given them, diſtinctly marked; and am thence enabled to fix this converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to have paſſed on Friday, the 22d of April, 1763.</p>
                     <p>I remember alſo diſtinctly, (though I have not for this the authority of my journal,) that the converſation going on concerning Mr. Pope, I took notice of a report which had been ſometimes propagated that he did not underſtand Greek. Lord Bathurſt ſaid to me, that he knew that to be falſe; for that part of the Iliad was tranſlated by Mr. Pope in his houſe in the country; and that in the mornings, when they aſſembled at breakfaſt, Mr. Pope uſed frequently to repeat, with great rapture, the Greek lines which he had been tranſlating, and then to give them his verſion of them, and to compare them together.</p>
                     <p>If theſe circumſtances can be of any uſe to Dr. Johnſon, you have my full liberty to give them to him. I beg you will, at the ſame time, preſent to him my moſt reſpectful compliments, with beſt wiſhes for his ſucceſs and fame in all his literary undertakings.</p>

               <p>JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Depend upon it, Sir, this is too ſtrongly ſtated. Pope may have had from Bolingbroke the philoſophick ſtamina of his Eſſay: and admitting this to be true, Lord Bathurſt did not intentionally falſify. But the thing is not true in the latitude that Blair ſeems to imagine; we are ſure that the poetical imagery, which makes a great part of the poem, was Pope's own. It is amazing, Sir, what deviations there are from preciſe truth, in the account which is given of almoſt every thing. I told Mrs. Thrale, 'You have ſo little anxiety about truth, that you never tax your memory with the exact thing.' Now what is the uſe of the memory to truth,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0548300102:303" rendition="simple:additions"/>
if one is careleſs of exactneſs? Lord Hailes's 'Annals of Scotland' are  very exact; but they contain mere dry particulars. They are to be conſidered as a Dictionary. You know ſuch things are there; and may be looked at when you pleaſe.

               <p>BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"By aſſociating with you, Sir, I am always getting an acceſſion of wiſdom. But perhaps a man, after knowing his own character—the limited ſtrength of his own mind, ſhould not be deſirous of having too much wiſdom, conſidering, <hi>quid valeant humeri,</hi> how little he can carry."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, be as wiſe as you can; let a man be <hi>aliis laetus, ſapiens ſibi:</hi>

               <p>I mentioned to him a diſpute between a friend of mine and his lady, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning conjugal infidelity, which my friend had maintained was by no means ſo bad in the huſband, as in the wife. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Your friend was in the right, Sir. Between a man and his Maker it is a different queſtion; but between a man and his wife, a huſband's infidelity is nothing. They are connected by children, by fortune, by ſerious conſiderations of community. Wiſe married women don't trouble themſelves about infidelity in their huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"To be ſure there is a great difference between the offence of infidelity in a man and that of his wife."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"The difference is boundleſs. The man impoſes no baſtards upon his wife."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here it may be queſtioned whether Johnſon was entirely in the right. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it will not be controverted that the difference in the degree of criminality is very great, on account of conſequences: but ſtill it may be maintained, that, independent of moral obligation, infidelity is by no means a light offence in a huſband; becauſe it muſt hurt a delicate attachment, in which a mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy is implied, with ſuch refined ſentiments as Maſſinger has exhibited in his play of <q rend="inline">"The Picture."</q> Johnſon probably at another time would have admitted this opinion. And let it be kept in remembrance, that he was very careful not to give any encouragement to irregular conduct. A gentleman, not adverting to the diſtinction made by him upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, ſuppoſed a caſe of ſingular perverſeneſs in a wife, and heedleſsly ſaid, <q rend="inline">"That then he thought a huſband might do as he pleaſed with a
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0548300102:305" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſafe conſcience."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, this is wild indeed (ſmiling); you  muſt conſider that fornication is a crime in a ſingle man; and you cannot have more liberty by being married."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He this evening expreſſed himſelf ſtrongly againſt the Roman Catholicks; obſerving, <q rend="inline">"In every thing in which they differ from us they are wrong."</q> He was even againſt the invocation of Saints; in ſhort, he was in the humour of oppoſition.</p>
               <p>Having regretted to him that I had learnt little Greek, as is too generally the caſe in Scotland, that I had for a long time hardly applied at all to the ſtudy of that noble language, and that I was deſirous of being told by him what method to follow; he recommended to me as eaſy helps, Sylvanus's <q rend="inline">"Firſt Book of the Iliad;"</q> Dawſon's <q rend="inline">"Lexicon to the Greek New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;"</q> and <q rend="inline">"Heſiod,"</q> with <hi>Paſoris Lexicon</hi> at the end of it.</p>
               <p>On Tueſday, October 12, I dined with him at Mr. Ramſay's, with Lord Newhaven, and ſome other company, none of whom I recollect, but a beautiful Miſs Graham, a relation of his Lordſhip's, who aſked Dr. Johnſon to hob or nob with her. He was flattered by ſuch pleaſing attention, and politely told her, he never drank wine; but if ſhe would drink a glaſs of water, he was much at her ſervice. She accepted. <q rend="inline">"Oho, Sir! (ſaid Lord Newhaven) you are caught."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, I do not ſee <hi>how</hi> I am <hi>caught;</hi> but if I am caught I don't want to get free again. If I am caught, I hope to be kept."</q> Then when the two glaſſes of water were brought, ſmiling placidly to the young lady, <q rend="inline">"Madam, let us <hi>reciprocate.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Lord Newhaven and Johnſon carried on an argument for ſome time, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Middleſex election. Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Parliament may be conſidered as bound by law, as a man is bound where there is nobody to tie the knot. As it is clear that the Houſe of Commons may expel, and expel again and again, why not allow of the power to incapacitate for that parliament, rather than have a perpetual conteſt kept up between parliament and the people."</q> Lord Newhaven took the oppoſite ſide, but reſpectfully ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I ſpeak with great deference to you, Dr. Johnſon; I ſpeak to be inſtructed."</q> This had its full effect upon my friend. He bowed his head almoſt as low as the table, to a complimenting nobleman; and called out, <q rend="inline">"My Lord, my Lord, I do not deſire all this ceremony; let us tell our minds to one another quietly."</q> After the debate was over, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I have got lights on the ſubject to-day, which I had not before."</q> This was a great deal from him, eſpecially as he had written a pamphlet upon it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="304" facs="tcp:0548300102:306" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 He obſerved, <q rend="inline">"The Houſe of Commons was originally not a privilege of the people, but a check for the Crown on the Houſe of Lords. I remember Henry the Eighth, wanted them to do ſomething; they heſitated in the morning, but did it in the afternoon. He told them, 'It is well you did, or half your heads ſhould have been upon Temple-bar.' But the Houſe of Commons is now no longer under the power of the crown, and therefore muſt be bribed."</q> He added, <q rend="inline">"I have no delight in talking of publick affairs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Of his fellow-collegian, the celebrated Mr. George Whitefield, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Whitefield never drew as much attention as a mountebank does; he did not draw attention by doing better than others, but by doing what was ſtrange. Were Aſtley to preach a ſermon ſtanding upon his head on a horſe's back, he would collect a multitude to hear him; but no wiſe man would ſay he had made a better ſermon for that. I never treated Whitefield's miniſtry with contempt; I believe he did good. He had devoted himſelf to the lower claſſes of mankind, and among them he was of uſe. But when familiarity and noiſe claim the praiſe due to knowledge, art, and elegance, we muſt beat down ſuch pretenſions."</q>
               </p>
               <p>What I have preſerved of his converſation during the remainder of my ſtay in London at this time, is only what follows: I told him that when I objected to keeping company with a notorious infidel, a celebrated friend of our's ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"I do not think that men who live laxly in the world, as you and I do, can with propriety aſſume ſuch an authority. Dr. Johnſon may, who is uniformly exemplary in his conduct. But it is not very conſiſtent to ſhun an infidel to-day, and get drunk to-morrow."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, this is ſad reaſoning. Becauſe a man cannot be right in all things, is he to be right in nothing? Becauſe a man ſometimes gets drunk, is he therefore to ſteal? This doctrine would very ſoon bring a man to the gallows.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>"After all, however, it is a difficult queſtion how far ſincere Chriſtians ſhould aſſociate with the avowed enemies of religion; for in the firſt place, almoſt every man's mind may be more or leſ<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'corrupted by evil communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations;' ſecondly, the world may very naturally ſuppoſe that they are not really in earneſt in religion, who can eaſily bear its opponents; and thirdly, if the proſane find themſelves quite well received by the pious, one of the checks upon an open declaration of their inſidelity, and one of the probable chances of obliging them ſeriouſly to reflect, which their being ſhunned would do, is removed."</q>

                  <pb n="305" facs="tcp:0548300102:307" rendition="simple:additions"/>
He, I know not why, ſhewed upon all occaſions an averſion to go to  Ireland, where I propoſed to him that we ſhould make a tour. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is the laſt place where I ſhould wiſh to travel."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Should you not like to ſee Dublin, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, Dublin is only a worſe capital."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Is not the Giant's-Cauſeway worth ſeeing?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Worth ſeeing, yes; but not worth going to ſee."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Of an acquaintance of ours, whoſe manners and every thing about him, though expenſive, were coarſe, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, you ſee in him vulgar proſperity."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A foreign miniſter of no very high talents, who had been in his company for a conſiderable time quite overlooked, happened luckily to mention that he had read ſome of his <q rend="inline">"Rambler"</q> in Italian, and admired it much. This pleaſed him greatly; he obſerved, that the title had been tranſlated, <hi>Il Genio errante,</hi> though I have been told it was rendered more ludicrouſly, <hi>Il Vaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bondo;</hi> and finding that this miniſter gave ſuch a proof of his taſte, he was all attention to him, and on the firſt remark which he made, however ſimple, exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"The Ambaſſadour ſays well—His Excellency obſerves—"</q> And then he expanded and enriched the little that had been ſaid in ſo ſtrong a manner, that it appeared ſomething of conſequence. This was exceedingly entertaining to the company who were preſent, and many a time afterwards it furniſhed a pleaſant topick of merriment: <q rend="inline">"The Ambaſſadour ſays well,"</q> became a laughable term of applauſe, when no mighty matter had been expreſſed.</p>
               <p>I left London on Monday, October 18, and accompanied Colonel Stuart to Cheſter, where his regiment was to lye for ſome time.</p>

                     <p>IT was not till one o'clock on Monday morning, that Colonel Stuart and I left London; for we choſe to bid a cordial adieu to Lord Mountſtuart, who was to ſet out on that day on his embaſſy to Turin. We drove on excellently, and reached Lichfield in good time enough that night. The Colonel had heard ſo preferable a character of the George, that he would not put up at the Three Crowns, ſo that I did not ſee our hoſt, Wilkins. We found at the George as good accommodation as we could wiſh to have, and I fully enjoyed the comfortable thought that <hi>I was in Lichfield again.</hi> Next morning it rained very hard; and as I had much to do in a little time, I ordered a poſt-chaiſe, and between eight and
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0548300102:308" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 nine ſallied forth to make a round of viſits. I firſt went to Mr. Green, hoping to have had him to accompany me to all my other friends, but he was engaged to attend the Biſhop of Sodor and Man, who was then lying at Lichfield very ill of the gout. Having taken a haſty glance at the additions to Green's muſeum, from which it was not eaſy to break away, I next went to the Friery, where I at firſt occaſioned ſome tumult in the ladies, who were not prepared to receive <hi>company</hi> ſo early: but my <hi>name,</hi> which has by wonderful felicity come to be ſo cloſely aſſociated with yours, ſoon made all eaſy; and Mrs. Cobb and Miſs Adye re-aſſumed their ſeats at the breakfaſt-table, which they had quitted with ſome precipitation. They received me with the kindneſs of old acquaintance; and after we had joined in a cordial chorus to <hi>your</hi> praiſe, Mrs. Cobb gave <hi>me</hi> the high ſatisfaction of hearing that you ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Boſwell is a man who I believe never left a houſe without leaving a wiſh for his return.'</q> And ſhe afterwards added, that ſhe bid you tell me, that if ever I came to Lichfield, ſhe hoped I would take a bed at the Friery. From thence, I drove to Peter Garrick's, where I alſo found a very flattering wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come. He appeared to me to enjoy his uſual cheerfulneſs; and he very kindly aſked me to come when I could, and paſs a week with him. From Mr. Garrick's I went to the Palace to wait on Mr. Seward. I was firſt enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by his lady and daughter, he himſelf being in bed with a cold, according to his valetudinary cuſtom. But he deſired to ſee me; and I found him dreſt in his black gown, with a white flannel night-gown above it; ſo that he looked like a Dominican friar. He was good-humoured and polite; and under his roof too my reception was very pleaſing. I then pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to Stowhill, and firſt paid my reſpects to Mrs. Gaſtrell, whoſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation I was not willing to quit. But my ſand-glaſs was now beginning to run low, as I could not treſpaſs too long on the Colonel's kindneſs, who obligingly waited for me; ſo I haſtened to Mrs. Aſton's, whom I found much better than I feared I ſhould; and there I met a brother-in-law of theſe ladies, who talked much of you, and very well too, as it appeared to me. It then only remained to viſit Mrs. Lucy Porter, which I did, I really believe, wth ſincere ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction on both ſides. I am ſure I was glad to ſee her again; and, as I take her to be very honeſt, I truſt ſhe was glad to ſee me again; for ſhe expreſſed herſelf ſo, that I could not doubt of her being in earneſt. What a great key-ſtone of kindneſs, my dear Sir, was you that morning! for we were all held together by our common attachment to you. I cannot ſay that I ever paſſed two hours with more ſelf-complacency than I did thoſe two at Lichfield. Let me not entertain any ſuſpicion that this is idle vanity. Will

not you confirm me in my perſuaſion, that he who finds himſelf ſo regarded  has juſt reaſon to be happy?</p>
                     <p>We got to Cheſter about midnight on Tueſday; and here again I am in a ſtate of much enjoyment. Colonel Stuart and his officers treat me with all the civility I could wiſh; and I play my part admirably. <hi>Laetus aliis, ſapiens ſibi,</hi> the claſſical ſentence which you, I imagine, invented the other day, is exemplified in my preſent exiſtence. The Biſhop, to whom I had the honour to be known ſeveral years ago, ſhews me much attention; and I am edified by his converſation. I muſt not omit to tell you, that his Lordſhip admires, very highly, your Prefaces to the Poets. I am daily obtaining an extenſion of agreeable acquaintance, ſo that I am kept in animated variety; and the ſtudy of the place itſelf, by the aſſiſtance of books, and of the Biſhop, is ſufficient occupation. Cheſter pleaſes my fancy more than any town I ever ſaw. But I will not enter upon it at all in this letter.</p>
                     <p>How long I ſhall ſtay here, I cannot yet ſay. I told a very pleaſing young lady, niece to one of the Prebendaries, at whoſe houſe I ſaw her, <q rend="inline">'I have come to Cheſter, Madam, I cannot tell how; and far leſs can I tell how I am to get away from it.'</q> Do not think me too juvenile. I beg it of you, my dear Sir, to favour me with a letter while I am here, and add to the happineſs of a happy friend, who is ever, with affectionate veneration,</p>

                     <p>WHY ſhould you importune me ſo earneſtly to write? Of what importance can it be to hear of diſtant friends, to a man who finds himſelf welcome wherever he goes, and makes new friends faſter than he can want them? If, to the delight of ſuch univerſal kindneſs of reception, any thing can be added by knowing that you retain my good-will, you may indulge yourſelf in the full enjoyment of that ſmall addition.</p>

<pb n="308" facs="tcp:0548300102:310" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 to read that Mrs. Aſton was ſo well; and that Lucy Porter was ſo glad to ſee you.</p>
                     <p>In the place where you now are, there is much to be obſerved; and you will eaſily procure yourſelf ſkilful directors. But what will you do to keep away the <hi>black dog</hi> that worries you at home? If you would, in compliance with your father's advice, enquire into the old tenures, and old charters of Scotland, you would certainly open to yourſelf many ſtriking ſcenes of the manners of the middle ages. The feudal ſyſtem, in a country half barbarous, is naturally productive of great anomalies in civil life. The knowledge of paſt times is naturally growing leſs in all caſes not of publick record; and the paſt time of Scotland is ſo unlike the preſent, that it is already difficult for a Scotchman to image the oeconomy of his grand-father. Do not be tardy, nor negligent; but gather up eagerly what can yet be found <note n="8" place="bottom">I have a valuable-collection made by my Father, which, with ſome additions and illuſtrations of my own, I intend to publiſh. I have ſome hereditary claim to be an Antiquary; not only from my Father, but as being deſcended, by the mother's ſide, of the able and learned Sir John Skene, whoſe merit bids defiance to all the attempts which have been made to leſſen his fame.</note>.</p>

                     <p>THAT I ſhould importune you to write to me at Cheſter, is not wonderful, when you conſider what an avidity I have for delight; and that the <hi>amor</hi> of pleaſure, like the <hi>amor nummi,</hi> increaſes in proportion with the
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0548300102:311" rendition="simple:additions"/>
quantity which we poſſeſs of it. Your letter, ſo full of polite kindneſs  and maſterly counſel, came like a large treaſure upon me, while already glittering with riches. I was quite enchanted at Cheſter, ſo that I could with difficulty quit it. But the enchantment was the reverſe of that of Circe; for ſo far was there from being any thing ſenſual in it, that I was <hi>all mind.</hi> I do not mean all reaſon only; for my fancy was kept finely in play. And why not?—If you pleaſe I will ſend you a copy, or an abridgement of my Cheſter journal, which is truly a log-book of felicity.</p>
                     <p>The Biſhop treated me with a kindneſs which was very flattering. I told him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that you regretted you had ſeen ſo little of Cheſter. His Lordſhip Bid me tell you, that he ſhould be glad to ſhew you more of it. I am proud to find the friendſhip with which you honour me is known in ſo many places.</p>
                     <p>I arrived here late laſt night. Our friend the Dean, has been gone from hence ſome months; but I am told at my inn, that he is very <hi>populous</hi> (popular). However, I found Mr. Law, the Archdeacon, ſon to the Biſhop, and with him I have breakfaſted and dined very agreeably. I got acquainted with him at the aſſizes here, about a year and a half ago; he is a man of great variety of knowledge, uncommon genius, and I believe, ſincere religion. I received the holy ſacrament in the cathedral in the morning, this being the firſt Sunday of the month; and was at prayers there in the evening. It is divinely cheering to me to think that there is a Cathedral ſo near Auchinleck; and I now leave Old England in ſuch a ſtate of mind as I am thankful to GOD for granting me.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>black dog</hi> that worries me at home I cannot but dread; yet as I have been for ſome time paſt in a military train, I truſt I ſhall <hi>repulſe</hi> him. To hear from you will animate me like the ſound of a trumpet, I therefore hope that ſoon after my return to the Northern field, I ſhall receive a few lines from you.</p>
                     <p>Colonel Stuart did me the honour to eſcort me in his carriage to ſhew me Liverpool, and from thence back again to Warrington, where we parted <note n="9" place="bottom">His regiment was afterwards ordered to Jamaica, where he accompanied it, and almoſt loſt his life by the climate. This impartial order I ſhould think a ſufficient refutation of the idle rumour that <q rend="inline">"there was ſtill ſomething behind the throne greater than the throne itſelf."</q>
                        </note>. In juſtice to my valuable wife, I muſt inform you, that as I was ſo happy, ſhe would not be ſo ſelfiſh as to wiſh me to return ſooner than buſineſs abſolutely required my preſence. She made my clerk write to me a poſt or two after to the ſame purpoſe, by commiſſion from her; and this day a kind letter from her met me at the Poſt-Office here, acquainting me that ſhe and

 the little ones were well, and expreſſing all their wiſhes for my return home.</p>

                     <p>YOUR laſt letter was not only kind but fond. But I wiſh you to get rid of all intellectual exceſſes, and neither to exalt your pleaſures, nor aggravate your vexations, beyond their real and natural ſtate. Why ſhould you not be as happy at Edinburgh as at Cheſter, <hi>In culpa eſt animus, qui ſe non effugit uſquam.</hi> Pleaſe yourſelf with your wife and children, and ſtudies and practice.</p>
                     <p>I have ſent a petition<note n="1" place="bottom">Requeſting me to inquire concerning the family of a gentleman who was then paying his addreſſes to Miſs Doxy.</note> from Lucy Porter, with which I leave it to your diſcretion whether it is proper to comply. Return me her letter, which I have ſent that you may know the whole caſe, and not be ſeduced to any thing that you may afterwards repent. Miſs Doxy perhaps you know to be Mr. Garrick's niece.</p>

                     <p>How near is the Cathedral to Auchinleck, that you are ſo much delighted with it? It is, I ſuppoſe, at leaſt an hundred and fifty miles off. However, if you are pleaſed, it is ſo far well.</p>
                     <p>Let me know what reception you have from your father, and the ſtate of his health. Pleaſe him as much as you can, and add no pain to his laſt years.</p>
                     <p>Of our friends here I can recollect nothing to tell you. I have neither ſeen nor heard of Langton. Beauclerk is juſt returned from Brighthelmſton, I am told, much better. Mr. Thrale and his family are ſtill there; and his health is ſaid to be viſibly improved; he has not bathed, but hunted.</p>

On November 22, and December 21, I wrote to him from Edinburgh,  giving a very favourable report of the family of Miſs Doxy's lover;—that after a good deal of inquiry I had diſcovered the ſiſter of Mr. Francis Stewart, one of his amanuenſes when writing his Dictionary;—that I had, as deſired by him, paid her a guinea for an old pocket-book of her brother's which he had retained; and that the good woman, who was in very moderate circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, but contented and placid, wondered at his ſcrupulous and liberal honeſty, and received the guinea as if ſent her by Providence.—That I had repeatedly begged of him to keep his promiſe to ſend me his letter to Lord Cheſterfield, and that this <hi>memento,</hi> like <hi>Delenda eſt Carthago,</hi> muſt be in every letter that I ſhould write to him, till I had obtained my object.</p>

Aetat. 71."/> The loſs, dear Sir, which you have lately ſuffered, I felt many years ago, and know therefore how much has been taken from you, and how little help can be had from conſolation. He that outlives a wife whom he has long loved, ſees himſelf disjoined from the only mind that has the ſame hopes, and fears, and intereſt; from the only companion with whom he has ſhared much good or evil; and with whom he could ſet his mind at liberty, to retrace the paſt, or anticipate the future. The continuity of being is lacerated; the ſettled courſe of ſentiment and action is ſtopped; and life ſtands ſuſpended and motionleſs, till it is driven by external cauſes into a new channel. But the time of ſuſpenſe is dreadful.</p>
                     <p>Our firſt recourſe in this diſtreſsful ſolitude, is, perhaps for want of ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual piety, to a gloomy acquieſcence in neceſſity. Of two mortal beings, one muſt loſe the other; but ſurely there is a higher and a better comfort to be drawn from the conſideration of that Providence which watches over all, and a belief that the living and the dead are equally in the hands of GOD, who will reunite thoſe whom he has ſeparated, or who ſees that it is beſt not to reunite them.</p>

                     <p>WELL, I had reſolved to ſend you the Cheſterfield letter; but I will write once again without it. Never impoſe taſks upon mortals. To require two things is the way to have them both undone.</p>
                     <p>For the difficulties which you mention in your affairs I am ſorry; but difficulty is now very general: it is not therefore leſs grievous, for there is leſs hope of help. I pretend not to give you advice, not knowing the ſtate of your affairs; and general counſels about prudence and frugality would do you little good. You are, however, in the right not to increaſe your own perplexity by a journey hither; and I hope that by ſtaying at home you will pleaſe your father.</p>
                     <p>Poor dear Beauclerk—<hi>nec, ut ſoles, dabis joca.</hi> His wit and his folly, his acuteneſs and maliciouſneſs, his merriment and reaſoning, are now over. Such another will not often be found among mankind. He directed himſelf to be buried by the ſide of his mother, an inſtance of tenderneſs which I
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0548300102:315"/>
hardly expected. He has left his children to the care of Lady Di. and if  ſhe dies, of Mr. Langton, and of Mr. Leiceſter, his relation, and a man of good character. His library has been offered to ſale to the Ruffian ambaſſador.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Percy, notwithſtanding all the noiſe of the newſpapers, has had no literary loſs <note n="2" place="bottom">By a fire in Northumberland-houſe, where he had an apartment, in which I have paſſed many an agreeable hour.</note>. Clothes and moveables were burnt to the value of about one hundred pounds; but his papers, and I think his books, were all preſerved.</p>
                     <p>Poor Mr. Thrale has been in extreme danger from an apoplectical diſorder, and recovered, beyond the expectation of his phyſicians; he is now at Bath, that his mind may be quiet, and Mrs. Thrale and Miſs are with him.</p>
                     <p>Having told you what has happened to your friends, let me ſay ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to you of yourſelf. You are always complaining of melancholy, and I conclude from thoſe complaints that you are fond of it. No man talks of that which he is deſirous to conceal, and every man deſires to conceal that of which he is aſhamed. Do not pretend to deny it; <hi>manifeſtum habemus furem;</hi> make it an invariable and obligatory law to yourſelf, never to mention your own mental diſeaſes; If you are never to ſpeak of them you will think on them but little, and if you think little of them, they will moleſt you rarely. When you talk of them, it is plain that you want either praiſe or pity; for praiſe there is no room, and pity will do you no good; therefore, from this hour ſpeak no more, think no more about them.</p>
                     <p>Your tranſaction with Mrs. Stuart gave me great ſatisfaction; I am much obliged to you for your attention. Do not loſe ſight of her, your countenance may be of great credit, and of conſequence of great advantage to her. The memory of her brother is yet freſh in my mind; he was an ingenious and worthy man.</p>
                     <p>Pleaſe to make my compliments to your lady, and to the young ladies. I ſhould like to ſee them, pretty loves.</p>

                     <p>Yeſterday's evening was paſſed at Mrs. Montagu's: there was Mr. Melmoth; I do not like him though, nor he me; it was expected we ſhould have pleaſed each other; he is, however, juſt Tory enough to hate the Biſhop of Peterborough for Whiggiſm, and Whig enough to abhor you for Toryiſm.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Montagu flattered him finely; ſo he had a good afternoon on't. This evening we ſpend at a concert.

Miſs Burney ſays ſhe is a great performer; and I reſpect the wench for getting her living ſo prettily; ſhe is very modeſt and pretty mannered, and not ſeventeen years old.</p>
                     <p>You live in a fine whirl indeed, if I did not write regularly you would half forget me, and that would be very wrong, for I <hi>felt</hi> my regard for you in my <hi>face</hi> laſt night, when the criticiſms were going on.</p>
                     <p>This morning it was all connoiſſeurſhip; we went to ſee ſome pictures painted by a gentleman artiſt, Mr. Taylor, of this place; my maſter makes one every where, and he has got a dawling companion to ride with him now. * * * * * * * *.

The blaze of reputation cannot be blown out, but it often dies in the ſocket; a very few names may be conſidered as perpetual lamps that ſhine unconſumed.

               <p>On the 2d of May I wrote to him, and requeſted that we might have another meeting ſomewhere in the North of England, in the autumn of this year.</p>
               <p>From Mr. Langton I received ſoon after this time a letter, of which I extract a paſſage, relative at once to Mr. Beauclerk and Dr. Johnſon.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The melancholy information you have received concerning Mr. Beauclerk's death is true. Had his talents been directed in any ſufficient degree as they ought, I have always been ſtrongly of opinion that they were calculated to make an illuſtrious figure; and that opinion, as it had been in
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0548300102:318"/>
 part formed upon Dr. Johnſon's judgement, receives more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation by hearing, that ſince his death, Dr. Johnſon has ſaid concerning them; a few evenings ago, he was at Mr. Veſey's, where Lord Althorpe, who was one of a numerous company there, addreſſed Dr. Johnſon on the ſubject of Mr. Beauclerk's death, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'Our CLUB has had a great loſs ſince we met laſt.'</q> He replied, <q rend="inline">'A loſs, that perhaps the whole nation could not repair!'</q> The Doctor then went on to ſpeak of his endowments, and particularly extolled the wonderful eaſe with which he uttered what was highly excellent. He ſaid, that no man ever was ſo free when he was going to ſay a good thing, from a <hi>look</hi> that expreſſed that it was coming; or, when he had ſaid it, from a look that expreſſed that it <hi>had</hi> come. At Mr. Thrale's, ſome days before, when we were talking on the ſame ſubject, he ſaid, referring to the ſame idea of his wonderful facility, <q rend="inline">'That Beauclerk's talents were thoſe which he had felt himſelf more diſpoſed to envy, than thoſe of any whom he had known.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the evening I have ſpoken of above, at Mr. Veſey's, you would have been much gratified, as it exhibited an inſtance of the high importance in which Dr. Johnſon's character is held, I think even beyond any I ever before was witneſs to. The company conſiſted chiefly of ladies, among whom were the Ducheſs Dowager of Portland, the Ducheſs of Beaufort, whom I ſuppoſe from her rank, I muſt name before her mother Mrs. Boſcawen, and her elder ſiſter Mrs. Lewſon, who was likewiſe there; Lady Lucan, Lady Clermont, and others of note both for their ſtation and underſtandings. Among the gentlemen were, Lord Althorpe, whom I have before named, Lord Macartney, Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Lord Lucan, Mr. Wraxal, whoſe book you have probably ſeen, <hi>'The Tour to the Northern Parts of Europe;'</hi> a very agreeable ingenious man; Dr. Warren, Mr. Pepys, the Maſter in Chancery, whom I believe you know, and Dr. Barnard, the Provoſt of Eton. As ſoon as Dr. Johnſon was come in and had taken a chair, the company began to collect round him till they became not leſs than four if not five deep; thoſe behind ſtanding, and liſtening over the heads of thoſe that were ſitting near him. The converſation for ſome time was chiefly between Dr. Johnſon and the Provoſt of Eton, while the others contributed occaſionally their remarks. Without attempting to detail the particulars of the converſation, which perhaps if I did, I ſhould ſpin my account out to a tedious length, I thought, my dear Sir, this general account of the reſpect with which our valued friend was attended to, might be acceptable.</p>

               <p>While Johnſon was thus engaged in preparing a delightful literary entertainment for the world, the tranquillity of the metropolis of Great-Britain was unexpectedly diſturbed, by the moſt horrid ſeries of outrage that ever diſgraced a civilized country. A relaxation of ſome of the ſevere penal proviſions againſt our fellow ſubjects of the Catholick communion had been granted by the legiſlature, with an oppoſition ſo inconſiderable, that the genuine mildneſs of Chriſtianity, united with liberal policy, ſeemed to have become general in this iſland. But a dark and malignant ſpirit of perſecution ſoon ſhewed itſelf, in an unworthy petition for the repeal of the wiſe and humane ſtatute. That petition was brought forward by a mob, with the evident purpoſe of intimidation, and was juſtly rejected. But the attempt was accompanied and followed by ſuch daring violence as is unexampled in hiſtory. Of this extraordinary tumult, Dr. Johnſon has given the following conciſe, lively, and juſt account in his <q rend="inline">"Letters to Mrs. Thrale <note n="6" place="bottom">Vol. II. p. 143. <hi>et ſeq.</hi> I have ſelected paſſages from ſeveral letters, without mentioning dates.</note>:"</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"On Friday, the good Proteſtants met in St. George's-Fields, at the ſummons of Lord George Gordon, and marching to Weſtminſter, inſulted the Lords and Commons, who all bore it with great tameneſs. At night the outrages began by the demolition of the maſs-houſe by Lincoln's-Inn."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"An exact journal of a week's defiance of government I cannot give you. On Monday, Mr. Strahan, who had been inſulted, ſpoke to Lord Mansfield, who had I think been inſulted too, of the licentiouſneſs of the populace; and his Lordſhip treated it as a very ſlight irregularity. On Tueſday night they pulled down Fielding's houſe, and burnt his goods in the ſtreet. They had
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0548300102:320"/>
 gutted on Monday Sir George Savile's houſe, but the building was ſaved. On Tueſday evening, leaving Fielding's ruins, they went to Newgate to demand their companions who had been ſeized demoliſhing the chapel. The keeper could not releaſe them but by the Mayor's permiſſion, which he went to aſk; at his return he found all the priſoners releaſed, and Newgate in a blaze. They then went to Bloomſbury, and faſtened upon Lord Mansfield's houſe, which they pulled down; and as for his goods, they totally burnt them. They have ſince gone to Caen-wood, but a guard was there before them. They plundered ſome Papiſts, I think, and burnt a maſs-houſe in Moorfields the ſame night."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"On Wedneſday I walked with Dr. Scot to look at Newgate, and found it in ruins, with the fire yet glowing. As I went by, the Proteſtants were plundering the Seſſions-houſe at the Old Bailey. There were not, I believe, a hundred; but they did their work at leiſure, in full ſecurity, without ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, without trepidation, as men lawfully employed, in full day. Such is the cowardice of a commercial place. On Wedneſday they broke open the Fleet, and the King's-bench, and the Marſhalſea, and Wood-ſtreet Compter, and Clerkenwell Bridewell, and releaſed all the priſoners."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"At night they ſet fire to the Fleet, and to the King's-bench, and I know not how many other places; and one might ſee the glare of conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion fill the ſky from many parts. The ſight was dreadful. Some people were threatened: Mr. Strahan adviſed me to take care of myſelf. Such a time of terrour you have been happy in not ſeeing."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The King ſaid in council, 'That the magiſtrates had not done their duty, but that he would do his own;' and a proclamation was publiſhed, directing us to keep our ſervants within doors, as the peace was now to be preſerved by force. The ſoldiers were ſent out to different parts, and the town is now at quiet."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The ſoldiers are ſtationed ſo as to be every where within call; there is no longer any body of rioters, and the individuals are haunted to their holes, and led to priſon; Lord George was laſt night ſent to the Tower. Mr. John Wilkes was this day in my neighbourhood, to ſeize the publiſhes of a ſeditious paper."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Several chapels have been deſtroyed, and ſeveral inoffenſive Papiſts have been plundered; but the high ſport was to burn the gaols. This was a good rabble trick. The debtors and the criminals were all ſet at liberty; but of the criminals, as has always happened, many are already re-taken; and two

                  <q rend="inline">"Government now acts again with its proper force; and we are all again under the protection of the King and the law. I thought that it would be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to you and my maſter to have my teſtimony to the publick ſecurity; and that you would ſleep more quietly when I told you that you are ſafe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"There has, indeed, been an univerſal panick, from which the King was the firſt that recovered. Without the concurrence of his miniſters, or the aſſiſtance of the civil magiſtrate, he put the ſoldiers in motion, and ſaved the town from calamities, ſuch as a rabble's government muſt naturally produce."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The publick has eſcaped a very heavy calamity. The rioters attempted the Bank on Wedneſday night, but in no great number; and like other thieves, with no great reſolution. Jack Wilkes headed the party that drove them away. It is agreed, that if they had ſeized the Bank on Tueſday, at the height of the panick, when no reſiſtance had been prepared, they might have carried irrecoverably away whatever they had found. Jack who was always zealous for order and decency, declares, that if he be truſted with power, he will not leave a rioter alive. There is, however, now no longer any need of heroiſm or bloodſhed; no blue ribband is any longer worn."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Such was the end of this miſerable ſedition, from which London was delivered by the magnanimity of the Sovereign himſelf. Whatever ſome may maintain, I am ſatisfied that there was no combination or plan, either domeſtick or foreign; but that the miſchief ſpread by a gradual contagion of frenzy, augmented by the quantities of fermented liquors, of which the deluded populace poſſeſſed themſelves in the courſe of their depredations.</p>
               <p>I ſhould think myſelf very much to blame, did I here neglect to do juſtice to my eſteemed friend Mr. Akerman, the keeper of Newgate, who has long diſcharged a very important truſt with an uniform intrepid firmneſs, and at the ſame time a tenderneſs and a liberal charity, which entitle him to be recorded with diſtinguiſhed honour.</p>
               <p>Upon this occaſion, from the timidity and negligence of magiſtracy on the one hand, and the almoſt incredible exertions of the mob on the other, the firſt priſon of this great country was laid open, and the priſoners ſet free; but that Mr. Akerman, whoſe houſe was burnt, would have prevented all this, had proper aid been ſent to him in due time, there can be no doubt.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="320" facs="tcp:0548300102:322"/>
 Many years ago, a fire broke out in the brick part which was built as an addition to the old gaol of Newgate. The priſoners were in conſternation and tumult, calling out, <q rend="inline">"We ſhall be burnt—we ſhall be burnt! down with the gate—down with the gate!"</q> Mr. Akerman haſtened to them, ſhewed himſelf at the gate, and having, after ſome confuſed vociferation of <q rend="inline">"Hear him—hear him!"</q> obtained a ſilent attention, he then calmly told them, that the gate muſt not go down; that they were under his care, and that they ſhould not be permitted to eſcape: but that he could aſſure them, they need not be afraid of being burnt, for that the fire was not in the priſon, properly ſo called, which was ſtrongly built with ſtone; and that if they would engage to be quiet, he himſelf would come in to them, and conduct them to the further end of the building, and would not go out till they gave him leave. To this propoſal they agreed; upon which Mr. Akerman, having firſt made them fall back from the gate, went in, and with a determined reſolution ordered the outer turnkey upon no account to open the gate, even though the priſoners (though he truſted they would not) ſhould break their word, and by force bring himſelf to order it. <q rend="inline">"Never mind me, (ſaid he,) ſhould that happen."</q> The priſoners peaceably followed him, while he conducted them through paſſages, of which he had the keys, to the extremity of the gaol, which was moſt diſtant from the fire. Having, by this very judicious conduct, fully ſatisfied them that there was no immediate riſk, if any at all, he then addreſſed them thus: <q rend="inline">"Gentlemen, you are now convinced that I told you true. I have no doubt that the engines will ſoon extinguiſh this fire: if they ſhould not, a ſufficient guard will come, and you ſhall all be taken out and lodged in the Compters. I aſſure you, upon my word and honour, that I have not a farthing inſured. I have left my houſe that I might take care of you. I will keep my promiſe, and ſtay with you, if you inſiſt upon it: but if you will allow me to go out and look after my family and property, I will be obliged to you."</q> Struck with his behaviour, they called out, <q rend="inline">"Maſter Akerman, you have done bravely; it was very kind in you: by all means go and take care of your own concerns."</q> He did ſo accordingly, while they remained and were all preſerved.</p>
               <p>Johnſon has been heard to relate the ſubſtance of this ſtory with high praiſe, in which he was joined by Mr. Burke. My illuſtrious friend, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Mr. Akerman's kindneſs to his priſoners, pronounced this eulogy upon his character:—<q rend="inline">"He who has long had conſtantly in his view the worſt of mankind, and is yet eminent for the humanity of his diſpoſition,

                     <p>I have ſate at home in Bolt-court, all the ſummer, thinking to write the Lives, and a great part of the time only thinking. Several of them, however, are done, and I ſtill think to do the reſt.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Thrale and his family have, ſince his illneſs, paſſed their time firſt at Bath, and then at Brighthelmſton; but I have been at neither place. I would have gone to Lichfield, if I could have had time, and I might have had time, if I had been active; but I have miſſed much, and done little.</p>

In the late diſturbances, Mr. Thrale's houſe and ſtock were in great  danger; the mob was pacified at their firſt invaſion, with about fifty pounds in drink and meat; and at their ſecond, were driven away by the ſoldiers. Mr. Strahan got a garriſon into his houſe, and maintained them a fortnight; he was ſo frighted that he removed part of his goods. Mrs. Williams took ſhelter in the country.</p>
                     <p>I know not whether I ſhall get a ramble this autumn; it is now about the time when we were travelling.

'Your great friend is very fond of you, you can go no where without him.—'Aye, (ſaid ſhe,) he would follow me to any part of the world.'—'Then (ſaid the Earl,) aſk him to go with you to <hi>America.</hi>"</q>

               <p>This year he wrote to a young clergyman in the country, the following very excellent letter, which contains valuable advice to Divines in general:
<floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                     <body>
                        <opener>
                           <salute>DEAR SIR,</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>NOT many days ago Dr. Lawrence ſhewed me a letter, in which you make mention of me: I hope, therefore, you will not be diſpleaſed that I endeavour to preſerve your good-will by ſome obſervations which your letter ſuggeſted to me.</p>
                        <p>You are afraid of falling into ſome improprieties in the daily ſervice, by reading to an audience that requires no exactneſs. Your fear, I hope,
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:0548300102:326"/>
 ſecures you from danger. They who contract abſurd habits are ſuch as have no fear. It is impoſſible to do the ſame thing very often, without ſome pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity of manner: but that manner may be good or bad, and a little care will at leaſt preſerve it from being bad: to make it very good, there muſt, I think, be ſomething of natural or caſual felicity, which cannot be taught.</p>
                        <p>Your preſent method of making your ſermons ſeems very judicious. Few frequent preachers can be ſuppoſed to have ſermons more their own than yours will be. Take care to regiſter, ſomewhere or other, the authours from whom your ſeveral diſcourſes are borrowed; and do not imagine that you ſhall always remember, even what perhaps you now think it impoſſible to forget.</p>
                        <p>My advice, however, is, that you attempt, from time to time, an original ſermon; and in the labour of compoſition, do not burden your mind with too much at once; do not exact from yourſelf, at one effort of excogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, propriety of thought and elegance of expreſſion. Invent firſt, and then embelliſh. The production of ſomething, where nothing was before, is an act of greater energy than the expanſion or decoration of the thing produced. Set down diligently your thoughts as they riſe, in the firſt words that occur; and, when you have matter, you will eaſily give it form: nor, perhaps, will this method be always neceſſary; for, by habit, your thoughts and diction will flow together.</p>
                        <p>The compoſition of ſermons is not very difficult: the diviſions not only help the memory of the hearer, but direct the judgement of the writer; they ſupply ſources of invention, and keep every part in its proper place.</p>
                        <p>What I like leaſt in your letter is your account of the manners of your pariſh; from which I gather, that it has been long neglected by the parſon. The Dean of Carliſle <note n="5" place="bottom">Dr. Percy, now Biſhop of Dromore.</note>, who was then a little rector in Northamptonſhire, told me, that it might be diſcerned whether or no there was a clergyman reſident in a pariſh, by the civil or ſavage manner of the people. Such a congregation as yours ſtands in much need of reformation; and I would not have you think it impoſſible to reform them. A very ſavage pariſh was civiliſed by a decayed gentlewoman, who came among them to teach a petty ſchool. My learned friend Dr. Wheeler of Oxford, when he was a young man, had the care of a neighbouring pariſh for fifteen pounds a year, which he was never paid; but he counted it a convenience that it compelled him to make a ſermon weekly. One woman he could not bring to the communion; and, when he reproved or exhorted her, ſhe only anſwered, that ſhe was no ſcholar. He was adviſed to ſet ſome good woman or man of the pariſh, a
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:0548300102:327"/>
little wiſer than herſelf, to talk to her in language level to her mind. Such  honeſt, I may call them holy artifices, muſt be practiſed by every clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; for all means muſt be tried by which ſouls may be ſaved. Talk to your people, however, as much as you can; and you will find, that the more frequently you converſe with them upon religious ſubjects, the more willingly they will attend, and the more ſubmiſſively they will learn. A clergyman's diligence always makes him venerable. I think I have now only to ſay, that in the momentous work you have undertaken, I pray GOD to bleſs you.</p>

               <p>My next letters to him were of dates Auguſt 24, September 6, and October 1, and from them I extract the following paſſages:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>My brother David and I find the long indulged fancy of our comfortable meeting again at Auchinleck, ſo well realiſed, that it in ſome degree con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the pleaſing hope of <hi>O! praeclarum diem!</hi> in a future ſtate.</p>
                  <p>I beg that you may never again harbour a ſuſpicion of my indulging a peeviſh humour, or playing tricks; you will recollect, that when I confeſſed to you, that when I had once been intentionally ſilent to try your regard, I gave you my word and honour that I ſhould not do ſo again.</p>
                  <p>I rejoice to hear of your good ſtate of health; I pray GOD to continue it long. I have often ſaid, that I would willingly have ten years added to my life, to have ten taken from yours; I mean, that I would be ten years older, to have you ten years younger. But let me be thankful for the years during which I have enjoyed your friendſhip, and pleaſe myſelf with the hopes of enjoying it many years to come in this ſtate of being, truſting always, that in another ſtate, we ſhall meet never to be ſeparated. Of this we can form no notion; but the thought, though indiſtinct, is delightful, when the mind is calm and clear.</p>
                  <p>The riots in London were certainly horrible; but you give me no account of your own ſituation, during the barbarous anarchy. A deſcription of it by DR. JOHNSON would be a great painting <note n="6" place="bottom">I had not then ſeen his Letters to Mrs. Thrale.</note>; you might write another 'LONDON, A POEM.'</p>
                  <p>I am charmed with your condeſcending affectionate expreſſion, <q rend="inline">'let us keep each other's kindneſs by all the means in our power;'</q> my revered Friend! how elevating is it to my mind, that I am found worthy to be a
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:0548300102:328" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 companion to Dr. Samuel Johnſon! All that you have ſaid in grateful praiſe of Mr. Walmſley, I have long thought of you; but we are both Tories, which has a very general influence upon our ſentiments. I hope that you will agree to meet me at York, about the end of this month; or if you will come to Carliſle, that would be better ſtill, in caſe the Dean be there. Pleaſe to conſider, that to keep each other's kindneſs, we ſhould every year have that free and intimate communication of mind which can be had only when we are together. We ſhould have both our ſolemn and our pleaſant talk.</p>
                  <p>I write now for the third time, to tell you that my deſire for our meeting this autumn, is much increaſed. I wrote to 'Squire Godfrey Boſville, my Yorkſhire Chief, that I ſhould, perhaps, pay him a viſit, as I was to hold a conference with Dr. Johnſon, at York. I give you my word and honour that I ſaid not a word of his inviting you; but he wrote to me as follows:</p>
                  <p>
                     <q>'I need not tell you I ſhall be happy to ſee you here the latter end of this month, as you propoſe; and I ſhall likewiſe be in hopes that you will perſuade Dr. Johnſon to finiſh the conference here. It will add to the favour of your own company, if you prevail upon ſuch an aſſociate, to aſſiſt your obſervations. I have often been entertained with his writings, and I once belonged to a club of which he was a member, and I never ſpent an evening there, but I heard ſomething from him well worth remembering.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have thus, my dear Sir, good comfortable quarters in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of York, where you may be aſſured we ſhall be heartily welcome. I pray you then reſolve to ſet out; and let not the year 1780 be a blank in our ſocial calendar, and in that record of wiſdom and wit, which I keep with ſo much diligence, to your honour, and the inſtruction and delight of others.</p>

                        <p>I AM ſorry to write you a letter that will not pleaſe you, and yet it is at laſt what I reſolve to do. This year muſt paſs without an interview; the ſummer has been fooliſhly loſt, like many other of my ſummers and winters. I hardly ſaw a green field, but ſtaid in town to work, without working much.</p>
                        <p>Mr. Thrale's loſs of health has loſt him the election; he is now going to Brighthelmſton, and expects me to go with him, and how long I ſhall ſtay I cannot tell. I do not much like the place, but yet I ſhall go, and ſtay while my ſtay is deſired. We muſt, therefore, content ourſelves with knowing what we know as well as man can know the mind of man, that we love one another, and that we wiſh each other's happineſs, and that the lapſe of a year cannot leſſen our mutual kindneſs.</p>
                        <p>I was pleaſed to be told that I accuſed Mrs. Boſwell unjuſtly, in ſuppoſing that ſhe bears me ill-will. I love you ſo much, that I would be glad to love all that love you, and that you love; and I have love very ready for Mrs. Boſwell, if ſhe thinks it worthy of acceptance. I hope all the young ladies and gentlemen are well.</p>
                        <p>I take a great liking to your brother. He tells me that his father received him kindly, but not fondly; however, you ſeem to have lived well enough at Auchinleck, while you ſtaid. Make your father as happy as you can.</p>
                        <p>You lately told me of your health: I can tell you in return, that my health has been for more than a year paſt, better than it has been for many years before. Perhaps it may pleaſe GOD to give us ſome time together before we are parted.</p>

Being diſappointed in my hopes of meeting Johnſon this year, ſo that I  could hear none of his admirable ſayings, I ſhall compenſate for this want by inſerting a collection of them, for which I am indebted to my worthy friend Mr. Langton, whoſe kind communications have been ſeparately interwoven in many parts of this work. A very few articles of this collection were committed to writing by himſelf, he not having that habit; which he regrets, and which thoſe who know the numerous opportunities he had of gathering the rich fruits of <hi>Johnſonian</hi> wit and wiſdom, muſt ever regret. I however found, in converſations with him, that a good ſtore of <hi>Johnſoniana</hi> was treaſured in his mind; and I compared it to Herculaneum, or ſome old Roman field, which, when dug, fully rewards the labour employed. The authenticity of every article is unqueſtionable. For the expreſſion, I, who wrote them down in his preſence, am partly anſwerable.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Theocritus is not deſerving of very high reſpect as a writer; as to the paſtoral part, Virgil is very evidently ſuperiour. He wrote when there had been a larger influx of knowledge into the world than when Theocritus lived. Theocritus does not abound in deſcription, though living in a beautiful country: the manners painted are coarſe and groſs. Virgil has much more deſcription, more ſentiment, more of Nature, and more of art. Some of the moſt excellent parts of Theocritus are, where Caſtor and Pollux, going with the other Argonauts, land on the Bebrycian coaſt, and there fall into a diſpute with Amycus, the King of that country; which is as well conducted as Euripides could have done it; and the battle is well related. Afterwards they carry off a woman, whoſe two brothers come to recover her, and expoſtulate with Caſtor and Pollux on their injuſtice; but they pay no regard to the brothers, and a battle enſues, where Caſtor and his brother are triumphant. Theocritus ſeems not to have ſeen that the brothers have the advantage in their argument over his Argonaut heroes.—'The Sicilian Goſſips' is a piece of merit.</p>
                  <p>Callimachus is a writer of little excellence. The chief thing to be learned from him is his account of Rites and Mythology; which, though deſirable to be known for the ſake of underſtanding other parts of ancient authours, is the leaſt pleaſing or valuable part of their writings.</p>
                  <p>Mattaire's account of the Stephani is a heavy book. He ſeems to have been a puzzle-headed man, with a large ſhare of ſcholarſhip, but with little geometry or logick in his head, without method, and poſſeſſed of little genius. He wrote Latin verſes from time to time, and publiſhed a ſet in his old age,
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:0548300102:332" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 which he called <hi>'Senilia;'</hi> in which he ſhews ſo little learning or taſte in writing, as to make <hi>Carteret</hi> a dactyl.—In matters of genealogy it is neceſſary to give the bare names as they are; but in poetry, and in proſe of any elegance in the writing, they require to have inflection given to them.—His book of the Dialects is a ſad heap of confuſion; the only way to write on them is to tabulate them with Notes, added at the bottom of the page, and references.</p>
                  <p>It may be queſtioned, whether there is not ſome miſtake as to the methods of employing the poor, ſeemingly on a ſuppoſition that there is a certain portion of work left undone for want of perſons to do it; but if that is otherwiſe, and all the materials we have are actually worked up, or all the manufactures we can uſe or diſpoſe of are already executed, then what is given to the poor, who are to be ſet at work, muſt be taken from ſome who now have it, as time muſt be taken for learning, according to Sir William Petty's obſervation; a certain part of thoſe very materials that, as it is, are properly worked up, muſt be ſpoiled by the unſkilfulneſs of novices. We may apply to well-meaning, but misjudging perſons in particular of this nature, what Giannone ſaid to a monk, who wanted what he called to convert him: <hi>'Tu ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> Filoſofo.'</hi>—It is an unhappy circumſtance that one might give away five hundred pounds in a year to thoſe that importune in the ſtreets, and not do any good.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing more likely to betray a man into abſurdity than <hi>condeſcenſion;</hi> when he ſeems to ſuppoſe his underſtanding too powerful for his company.</p>
                  <p>Having aſked Mr. Langton if his father and mother had ſate for their pictures, which he thought it right for each generation of a family to do, and being told they had oppoſed it, he ſaid, 'Sir, among the infractuoſities of the human mind, I know not if it may not be one, that there is a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious reluctance to ſit for a picture.</p>
                  <p>John Gilbert Cooper related, that ſoon after the publication of his Dictionary, Garrick being aſked by Johnſon what people ſaid of it, told him, that among other animadverſions, it was objected that he cited authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which were beneath the dignity of ſuch a work, and mentioned Richardſon. 'Nay, (ſaid Johnſon,) I have done worſe than that: I have cited thee, David.</p>
                  <p>Talking of expence, he obſerved, with what munificence a great mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant will ſpend his money, both from his having it at command, and from his enlarged views by calculation of a good effect upon the whole. 'Whereas
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:0548300102:333" rendition="simple:additions"/>
(ſaid he) you will hardly ever find a country gentleman who is not a good  deal diſconcerted at an unexpected occaſion for his being obliged to lay out ten pounds.</p>
                  <p>When in good humour he would talk of his own writings with a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful frankneſs and candour, and would even criticiſe them with the cloſeſt ſeverity. One day, having read over one of his Ramblers, Mr. Langton aſked him, how he liked that paper; he ſhook his head, and anſwered, 'too wordy.' And at another time, when one was reading his tragedy of 'Irene,' to a company at a houſe in the country, he left the room; and ſomebody having aſked him the reaſon of this, he replied, 'Sir, I thought it had been better.</p>
                  <p>Talking of a point of delicate ſcrupuloſity of moral conduct, he ſaid to Mr. Langton, 'Men of harder minds than ours will do many things from which you and I would ſhrink; yet, Sir, they will, perhaps, do more good in life than we. But let us try to help one another. If there be a wrong twiſt, it may be ſet right. It is not probable that two people can be wrong the ſame way.</p>
                  <p>Of the Preface to Capel's Shakſpeare, he ſaid, 'If the man would have come to me, I would have endeavoured to 'endow his purpoſes with words;' for, as it is, 'he doth gabble monſtrouſly.</p>
                  <p>He related, that he had once in a dream a conteſt of wit with ſome other perſon, and that he was very much mortified by imagining that his opponent had the better of him. 'Now (ſaid he) one may mark here the effect of ſleep in weakening the power of reflection; for had not my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment failed me, I ſhould have ſeen, that the wit of this ſuppoſed antagoniſt, by whoſe ſuperiority I felt myſelf depreſſed, was as much furniſhed by me, as that which I thought I had been uttering in my own character.</p>
                  <p>One evening in company, an ingenious and learned gentleman read a letter of compliment to him from one of the Profeſſors of a foreign Univerſity. Johnſon, in an irritable fit, thinking there was too much oſtentation, ſaid, 'I never receive any of theſe tributes of applauſe from abroad. One inſtance I recollect of a foreign publication, in which mention is made of <hi>l'illuſtre Lockman.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of Sir Joſhua Reynolds he ſaid, 'Sir, I know no man who has paſſed through life with more obſervation than Reynolds.</p>
                  <p>He repeated to Mr. Langton, with great energy, in the Greek, our SAVIOUR'S gracious expreſſion concerning the forgiveneſs of Mary Magdalen,

                  <p>He thus defined the difference between phyſical and moral truth; 'Phyſical truth, is, when you tell a thing as it actually is. Moral truth, is, when you tell a thing ſincerely and preciſely as it appears to you. I ſay ſuch a one walked acroſs the ſtreet; if he really did ſo I told a phyſical truth. If I thought ſo, though I ſhould have been miſtaken, I told a moral truth.</p>
                  <p>Huggins, the tranſlator of Arioſto, and Mr. Thomas Warton, in the early part of his literary life, had a diſpute concerning that poet, of whom Mr. Warton, in his 'Obſervations on Spencer's Fairy Queen,' gave ſome account, which Huggins attempted to anſwer with violence, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">'I will <hi>militate</hi> no longer againſt his <hi>neſcience.'</hi>
                     </q> Huggins was maſter of the ſubject, but wanted expreſſion. Mr. Warton's knowledge of it was then imperfect, but his manner lively and elegant. Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">'It appears to me, that Huggins has ball without powder, and Warton powder without ball.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Talking of the Farce of 'High Life below Stairs,' he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Here is a Farce, which is really very diverting when you ſee it acted; and yet one may read it, and not know that one has been reading any thing at all.</q>

                  <p>He uſed at one time to go occaſionally to the green-room of Drury-lane Theatre, where he was much regarded by the players, and was very eaſy and facetious with them. He had a very high opinion of Mrs. Clive's comick powers, and converſed more with her than with any of them. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Clive, Sir, is a good thing to ſit by, ſhe always underſtands what you ſay.'</q> And ſhe ſaid of him, <q rend="inline">'I love to ſit by Dr. Johnſon, he always entertains me.'</q> One night, when 'The Recruiting Officer' was acted, he ſaid to Mr. Holland, who had been expreſſing an apprehenſion that Dr. Johnſon would diſdain the works of Farquhar; <q rend="inline">'No, Sir, I think Farquhar a man whoſe writings have conſiderable merit.</q>

                  <p>His friend Garrick was ſo buſy in conducting the drama, that they could not have ſo much intercourſe as Mr. Garrick uſed to profeſs an anxious wiſh that there ſhould be. There might indeed be ſomething in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptuous ſeverity as to the merit of acting, which his old preceptor nouriſhed in himſelf, that would mortify Garrick after the great applauſe which he received from the audience. For though Johnſon ſaid of him, <q rend="inline">'Sir, a man who has a nation to admire him every night, may well be expected to be ſomewhat elated;'</q> yet he would treat theatrical matters with a

                  <p>Once he aſked Tom Davies, whom he ſaw dreſt in a fine ſuit of clothes, <q rend="inline">'And what art thou to-night?'</q> Tom anſwered, <q rend="inline">'The Thane of Roſs;'</q> (which it will be recollected is a very inconſiderable character). <q rend="inline">'O brave!'</q> ſaid Johnſon.</p>
                  <p>Of Mr. Longley, at Rocheſter, a gentleman of very conſiderable learning, whom Dr. Johnſon met there, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'My heart warms towards him.

                  <p>Talking of the minuteneſs with which people will record the ſayings of eminent perſons, a ſtory was told, that when Pope was on a viſit to Spence at Oxford, as they looked from the window they ſaw a Gentleman Commoner, who was juſt come in from riding, amuſing himſelf with whipping at a poſt. Pope took occaſion to ſay, <q rend="inline">'That young gentleman ſeems to have little to do.'</q> Mr. Beauclerk obſerved, <q rend="inline">'Then, to be ſure, Spence turned round and wrote that down;'</q> and went on to ſay to Dr. Johnſon, <q rend="inline">'Pope, Sir, would have ſaid the ſame of you, if he had ſeen you diſtilling.'</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">'Sir, if Pope had told me of my diſtilling, I would have told him of his grotto.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>He would allow no ſettled indulgence of idleneſs upon principle, and always repelled every attempt to urge excuſes for it. A friend one day ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, that it was not wholeſome to ſtudy ſoon after dinner. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">'Ah, Sir, don't give way to ſuch a fancy. At one time of my life I had taken it into my head that it was not wholeſome to ſtudy between breakfaſt and dinner.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. Beauclerk one day repeated to Dr. Johnſon, Pope's lines,
<q>
                        <l>'Let modeſt Foſter, if he will, excel</l>
                        <l>'Ten metropolitans in preaching well:'</l>
                     </q>
Then aſked the Doctor, <q rend="inline">'Why did Pope ſay this?'</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">'Sir, he hoped it would vex ſomebody.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. Goldſmith, upon occaſion of Mrs. Lennox's bringing out a play, ſaid to Dr. Johnſon at the CLUB, that a perſon had adviſed him to go and hiſs it, becauſe ſhe had attacked Shakſpeare in her book called 'Shakſpeare

 Illuſtrated.' JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">'And did not you tell him that he was a raſcal?'</q> GOLDSMITH. <q rend="inline">'No, Sir, I did not. Perhaps he might not mean what he ſaid.'</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">'Nay, Sir, if he lied it is a different thing.'</q> Colman ſlily ſaid, (but it is believed Dr. Johnſon did not hear him,) <q rend="inline">'Then the proper expreſſion ſhould have been,—Sir, if you don't lie, you're a raſcal.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>His affection for Topham Beauclerk was ſo great, that when Beauclerk was labouring under that ſevere illneſs which at laſt occaſioned his death, Johnſon ſaid, (with a voice faultering with emotion,) <q rend="inline">'Sir, I would walk to the extent of the diameter of the earth to ſave Beauclerk.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>One night at the CLUB he produced a tranſlation of an Epitaph which Lord Elibank had written in Engliſh, for his Lady, and requeſted of Johnſon to turn into Latin for him. Having read <hi>Domina de North et Gray,</hi> he ſaid to Dyer, <q rend="inline">'You ſee, Sir, what barbariſms we are compelled to make uſe of, when modern titles are to be ſpecifically mentioned in Latin inſcriptions.'</q> When he had read it once aloud, and there had been a general approbation expreſſed by the company, he addreſſed himſelf to Mr. Dyer in particular, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Sir, I beg to have your judgement, for I know your nicety.'</q> Dyer then very properly deſired to read it over again; which, having done, he pointed out an incongruity in one of the ſentences. Johnſon immediately aſſented to the obſervation, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Sir, this is owing to an alteration of a part of the ſentence, from the form in which I had firſt written it; and I believe, Sir, you may have remarked, that it is a very frequent cauſe of errour in compoſition, when one has made a partial change, without a due regard to the general ſtructure of the ſentence.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Johnſon was well acquainted with Mr. Doſſie, authour of a treatiſe on Agriculture; and ſaid of him, <q rend="inline">'Sir, of the objects which the Society of Arts have chiefly in view, the chymical effects of bodies operating upon other bodies, he knows more than almoſt any man.'</q> Johnſon, in order to give Mr. Doſſie his vote to be a member of this Society, paid up an arrear which had run on for two years. On this occaſion he mentioned a circumſtance, as characteriſtick of the Scotch. <q rend="inline">'One of that nation, (ſaid he,) who had been a candidate, againſt whom I had voted, came up to me with a civil ſaluta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Talking on the ſubject of toleration, one day when ſome friends were  with him in his ſtudy, he made his uſual remark, that the State has a right to regulate the religion of the people, who are the children of the State. A clergyman having readily acquieſced in this, Johnſon, who loved diſcuſſion, obſerved, <q rend="inline">'But, Sir, you muſt go round to other States than our own. You do not know what a Bramin has to ſay for himſelf. In ſhort, Sir, I have got no farther than this. Every man has a right to utter what he thinks truth, and every other man has a right to knock him down for it. Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the teſt.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man, he obſerved, ſhould begin to write ſoon; for, if he waits till his judgement is matured, his inability, through want of practice to expreſs his conceptions, will make the diſproportion ſo great between what he ſees, and what he can attain, that he will probably be diſcouraged from writing at all. As a proof of the juſtneſs of this remark, we may inſtance what is related of the great Lord Granville; that after he had written his letter, giving an account of the battle of Dettingen, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Here is a letter, expreſſed in terms not good enough for a tollow-chandler to have uſed.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Talking of a Court-martial that was ſitting upon a very momentous publick occaſion, he expreſſed much doubt of an enlightened deciſion; and ſaid, that perhaps there was not a member of it, who in the whole courſe of his life, had ever ſpent an hour by himſelf in balancing probabilities.</p>
                  <p>Goldſmith one day brought to the CLUB a printed Ode, which he, with others, had been hearing read by its authour in a publick room, at the rate of five ſhillings each for admiſſion. One of the company having read it aloud, Dr. Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Bolder words, and more timorous meaning, I think never were brought together.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Talking of Gray's Odes, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'They are forced plants, raiſed in a hot-bed; and they are poor plants; they are but cucumbers after all.'</q> A gentleman preſent, who had been running down Ode-writing in general, as a bad ſpecies of poetry, unluckily ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Had they been literally cucumbers, they had been better things than Odes.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Yes, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) for a <hi>hog.</hi>

                  <p>His diſtinction of the different degrees of attainment of learning was thus marked upon two occaſions.

                  <p>He uſed to quote, with great warmth, the ſaying of Ariſtotle recorded by Diogenes Laertius; that there was the ſame difference between one learned and unlearned, as between the living and the dead.</p>

 It is very remarkable, that he retained in his memory very ſlight and trivial, as well as important things. As an inſtance of this, it ſeems that an inferiour domeſtick of the Duke of Leeds had attempted to celebrate his Grace's marriage in ſuch homely rhymes as he could make; and this curious compoſition having been ſung to Dr. Johnſon he got it by heart, and uſed to repeat it in a very pleaſant manner. Two of the ſtanzas were theſe:
<q>
                        <lg>
                           <l>'When the Duke of Leeds ſhall married be</l>

                           <l>'And ride in a coach to take the air,</l>

To hear a man, of the weight and dignity of Johnſon, repeating ſuch humble attempts at poetry, had a very amuſing effect. He, however, ſeriouſly obſerved of the laſt ſtanza, that it nearly comprized all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages that wealth can give.</p>
                  <p>An eminent foreigner, when he was ſhewn the Britiſh Muſeum, was very troubleſome with many abſurd inquiries. <q rend="inline">'Now there, Sir, (ſaid he,) is the difference between an Engliſhman and a Frenchman.

                  </p>
                  <p>His unjuſt contempt for foreigners was, indeed, extreme. One evening, at Old Slaughter's coffee-houſe, when a number of them were talking loud about little matters, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Does not this confirm old Meynell's obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—For any thing I ſee, foreigners are fools.</q>
                  </p>

                  <p>Having ſpent an evening at Mr. Langton's, with the Reverend Dr. Parr, he was much pleaſed with the converſation of that learned gentleman; and, after he was gone, ſaid to Mr. Langton, <q rend="inline">'Sir, I am obliged to you for having aſked me this evening.

                  </p>
                  <p>We may fairly inſtitute a criticiſm between Shakſpeare and Corneille, as they both had, though in a different degree, the lights of a latter age. It is not ſo juſt between the Greek dramatick writers and Shakſpeare. It may be replied to what is ſaid by one of the remarkers on Shakſpeare, that though Darius's ſhade had <hi>Preſcience,</hi> it does not neceſſarily follow that he had all <hi>paſt</hi> particulars revealed to him.</p>
                  <p>Spaniſh plays, being wildly and improbably farcical, would pleaſe children here, as children are entertained with ſtories full of prodigies; their experience not being ſufficient to cauſe them to be ſo readily ſtartled at deviations from the natural courſe of life. The machinery of the Pagans is unintereſting to us: when a Goddeſs appears in Homer or Virgil, we grow weary; ſtill more ſo in the Grecian tragedies, as in that kind of compoſition a nearer approach to Nature is intended. Yet there are good reaſons for reading romances; as the fertility of invention, the beauty of ſtyle, and expreſſion, the curioſity of ſeeing with what kind of performances the age and country in which they were written was delighted: for it is to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, that at the time when very wild improbable tales were well received, the people were in a barbarous ſtate, and ſo on the footing of children, as has been explained.</p>
                  <p>It is evident enough that no one who writes now can uſe the Pagan deities and mythology; the only machinery, therefore, ſeems that of miniſtring ſpirits, the ghoſts of the departed, witches, and fairies, though theſe latter, as the vulgar ſuperſtition concerning them (which, while in its force, infected at leaſt the imagination of thoſe that had more advantage in education, and only their reaſon ſet them free from it,) is every day wearing out, ſeem likely to be of little further aſſiſtance in the machinery of poetry. As I recollect Hammond introduces a hag or witch into one of his love elegies, where the effect is unmeaning and diſguſting.</p>
                  <p>The man who uſes his talent of ridicule in creating or groſsly exag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerating the inſtances he gives, who imputes abſurdities that did not happen, or when a man was a little ridiculous, deſcribes him as having been very much ſo, abuſes his talents greatly. The great uſe of delineating abſurdities is, that we may know how far human folly can go; the account, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, ought of abſolute neceſſity to be faithful. A certain character (naming the perſon) as to the general caſt of it, is well deſcribed by Garrick, but a great deal of the phraſeology he uſes in it, is quite his own, particularly in
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:0548300102:340"/>
 the proverbial compariſons, 'obſtinate as a pig,' &amp;c. but I don't know whether it might not be true of him, that from a too great eagerneſs for praiſe and popularity, and a politeneſs carried to a ridiculous exceſs, he was likely, after aſſerting a thing in general, to give it up again in parts. For inſtance, if he had ſaid Reynolds was the firſt of painters, he was capable enough of giving up, as objections might happen to be ſeverally made; firſt, his outline—then the grace in form—then the colouring—and laſtly, to have owned that he was ſuch a manneriſt, that the diſpoſition of his pictures was all alike.</p>
                  <p>For hoſpitality, as formerly practiſed, there is no longer the ſame reaſon; heretofore the poorer people were more numerous, and from want of commerce, their means of getting a livelihood more difficult; therefore the ſupporting them was an act of great benevolence; now that the poor can find maintenance for themſelves and their labour is wanted, a general undiſcerning hoſpitality tends to ill, by withdrawing them from their work to idleneſs and drunkenneſs. Then formerly rents were received in kind, ſo that there was a great abundance of proviſions in poſſeſſion of the owners of the lands, which ſince the plenty of money afforded by commerce is no longer the caſe.</p>
                  <p>Hoſpitality to ſtrangers and foreigners in our country is now almoſt at an end, ſince from the increaſe of them that come to us, there have been a ſufficient number of people that have found an intereſt in providing inns and proper accommodations, which is in general a more expedient method for the entertainment of travellers. Where the travellers and ſtrangers are few, more of that hoſpitality ſubſiſts, as it has not been worth while to provide places of accommodation. In Ireland there is ſtill hoſpitality to ſtrangers, in ſome degree; in Hungary and Poland probably more.</p>
                  <p>Colman, in a note on his tranſlation of Terence, talking of Shakſpeare's learning, aſks, <q rend="inline">'What ſays Farmer to this?—What ſays Johnſon?'</q> Upon this he obſerved, <q rend="inline">'Sir, let Farmer anſwer for himſelf: <hi>I</hi> never engaged in this controverſy.

                  </p>
                  <p>He uſed frequently to obſerve, that men might be very eminent in a profeſſion, without our perceiving any particular power of mind in them in converſation. <q rend="inline">'It ſeems ſtrange (ſaid he,) that a man ſhould ſee ſo far to the right, who ſees ſo ſhort a way to the left. Burke is the only man whoſe common converſation correſponds with the general fame which he had in the world. Take up whatever topick you pleaſe, he is ready to meet you.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>A gentleman, by no means deficient in literature, having diſcovered leſs acquaintance with one of the Claſſicks than Johnſon expected, when the gentleman left the room he obſerved, <q rend="inline">'You ſee, now, how little any body reads.'</q> Mr. Langton happening to mention his having read a good deal in Clinardus's Greek Grammar, <q rend="inline">'Why, Sir, (ſaid he,) who is there in this town who knows any thing of Clinardus but you and I?'</q> And upon Mr. Langton's mentioning that he had taken the pains to learn by heart the Epiſtle of St. Baſil, which is given in that Grammar as a praxis, <q rend="inline">'Sir, (ſaid he,) I never made ſuch an effort to attain Greek.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of Dodſley's 'Publick Virtue: a Poem,' he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'It was fine <hi>blank;</hi> (meaning to expreſs his uſual contempt for blank verſe): however, this miſerable poem did not ſell, and my poor friend Doddy ſaid, Publick Virtue was not a ſubject to intereſt the age.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Mr. Langton, when a very young man, read Dodſley's 'Cleone: a Tragedy,' to him, not aware of his extreme impatience to be read to. As it went on he turned his face to the back of his chair, and put himſelf into various attitudes, which marked his uneaſineſs. At the end of an act, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'Come let's have ſome more, let's go into the ſlaughter-houſe again, Lanky. But I am afraid there is more blood than brains.'</q> Yet he afterwards ſaid, <q rend="inline">'When I heard you read it, I thought higher of its power of language. When I read it myſelf, I was more ſenſible of its pathetick effect,'</q> and then paid it a compliment which many will think very extravagant. <q rend="inline">'Sir, (ſaid he,) if Otway had written this play, no other of his pieces would have been remembered.'</q> Dodſley himſelf, upon this being repeated to him, ſaid,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:0548300102:342" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <q rend="inline">'It was too much:'</q> it muſt be remembered, that Johnſon always appeared not to be ſufficiently ſenſible of the merit of Otway.</p>
                  <p>Snatches of reading (ſaid he) will not make a Bentley or a Clarke. They are, however, in a certain degree advantageous. I would put a child into a library (where no unfit books are) and let him read at his choice. A child ſhould not be diſcouraged from reading any thing that he takes a liking to, from a notion that it is above his reach. If that be the caſe, the child will ſoon find it out and deſiſt; if not, he of courſe gains the inſtruction; which is ſo much the more likely to come, from the inclination with which he takes up the ſtudy.</p>
                  <p>Though he uſed to cenſure careleſſneſs with great vehemence, he owned, that he once, to avoid the trouble of locking up five guineas, hid them, he forgot where, ſo that he could not find them.</p>
                  <p>A gentleman who introduced his brother to Dr. Johnſon, was earneſt to recommend him to the Doctor's notice, which he did by ſaying, <q rend="inline">'When we have ſat together ſome time, you'll find my brother grow very enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) I can wait.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the rumour was ſtrong that we ſhould have a war, becauſe the French would aſſiſt the Americans; he rebuked a friend with ſome aſperity for ſuppoſing it, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'No, Sir, national faith is not yet ſunk ſo low.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the latter part of his life, in order to ſatisfy himſelf whether his mental faculties were impaired, he reſolved that he would try to learn a new language, and fixed upon the Low Dutch, for that purpoſe, and this he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued till he had read about one half of 'Thomas à Kempis;' and finding that there appeared no abatement of his power of acquiſition, he then deſiſted, as thinking the experiment had been duely tried. Mr. Burke juſtly obſerved, that this was not the moſt vigorous trial, Low Dutch being a language ſo near to our own; had it been one of the languages entirely different, he might have been very ſoon ſatisfied.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Langton and he having gone to ſee a Freemaſon's funeral proceſſion, when they were at Rocheſter, and ſome ſolemn muſick being played on French-horns, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">'This is the firſt time that I have ever been affected by muſical ſounds:'</q> adding, <q rend="inline">'that the impreſſion made upon him was of a melancholy kind.'</q> Mr. Langton ſaying, that this effect was a fine one. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">'Yes, if it ſoftens the mind ſo as to prepare it for the reception of ſalutary feelings, it may be good. But inaſmuch as it is melancholy <hi>per ſe,</hi> it is bad.</q>

Goldſmith had long a viſionary project, that ſome time or other when  his circumſtances ſhould be eaſier, he would go to Aleppo, in order to acquire a knowledge as far as might be, of any arts peculiar to the Eaſt, and introduce them into Britain. When this was talked of in Dr. Johnſon's company, he ſaid, 'Of all men Goldſmith is the moſt unfit to go out upon ſuch an inquiry, for he is utterly ignorant of ſuch arts as we already poſſeſs, and conſequently could not know what would be acceſſions to our preſent ſtock of mechanical knowledge. Sir, he would bring home a grinding-barrow, which you ſee in every ſtreet in London, and think that he had furniſhed a wonderful improvement.</p>

                  <p>When Lord Charles Hay, after his return from America, was preparing his defence to be offered to the Court-Martial which he had demanded, having heard Mr. Langton as high in expreſſions of admiration of Johnſon, as he uſually was, he requeſted that Dr. Johnſon might be introduced to him; and Mr. Langton having mentioned it to Johnſon, he very kindly and readily agreed; and being preſented to his Lordſhip, while under arreſt, by Mr. Langton, he ſaw him ſeveral times; upon one of which occaſions Lord Charles read to him what he had prepared, which Johnſon ſignified his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'It is a very good ſoldierly defence.'</q> Johnſon ſaid, that he had adviſed his Lordſhip, that as it was in vain to contend with thoſe who were in poſſeſſion of power, if they would offer him the rank of Lieutenant-General, and a government, it would be better judged to deſiſt from urging his complaints. It is well known that his Lordſhip died before the trial came on.</p>

                  <p>It is well known that there was formerly a rude cuſtom for thoſe who were ſailing upon the Thames, to accoſt each other as they paſſed in the moſt abuſive language they could invent, generally, however with as much ſatirical humour as they were capable of producing. Addiſon gives a ſpecimen of this ribaldry, in Number 383 of 'The Spectator,' when Sir Roger de Coverley and he are going to Spring-garden. Johnſon was once eminently ſucceſsful in this ſpecies of conteſt; a fellow having attacked him with ſome coarſe raillery, Johnſon anſwered thus, <q rend="inline">'Sir, your wife (under pretence of keeping a bawdy-houſe) is a receiver of ſtolen-goods.'</q> One evening when he and Mr. Burke, and Mr. Langton were in company together, and the admirable ſcolding of Timon of Athens was mentioned, this inſtance of Johnſon's was quoted, and thought to have at leaſt equal excellence.</p>
                  <p>As Johnſon always allowed the extraordinary talents of Mr. Burke, ſo Mr. Burke was fully ſenſible of the wonderful powers of Johnſon.

As Mr. Burke and Mr. Langton were walking home, Mr. Burke obſerved that Johnſon had been very great that night; Mr. Langton joined in this, but added, he could have wiſhed to hear more from another perſon; (plainly intimating that he meant Mr. Burke). <q rend="inline">'O, no (ſaid Mr. Burke) it is enough for me to have rung the bell to him.</q>

               <p>This was, however, but a ſmall recompence for ſuch a collection of biography, and ſuch principles and illuſtrations of criticiſm as, if digeſted and arranged in one ſyſtem by ſome modern Ariſtotle or Longinus, might form a code upon that ſubject ſuch as no other nation can ſhew.

 whoſe variety of literary inquiry and obliging diſpoſition, rendered him very uſeful to Johnſon. Mr. Steevens appears, from the papers in my poſſeſſion, to have ſupplied him with ſome anecdotes and quotations; and I obſerve the fair hand of Mrs. Thrale as one of his copyiſts of ſelect paſſages.</p>
               <p>It is not my intention to dwell upon each of Johnſon's <q rend="inline">"Lives of the Poets,"</q> or attempt an analyſis of their merits, which were I able to do it, would take up too much room in this work; yet I ſhall make a few obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions upon ſome of them, and inſert a few various readings.</p>
               <p>The Life of COWLEY he himſelf conſidered as the beſt of the whole, on account of the diſſertation which it contains on the <hi>Metaphyſical Poets.</hi> Dryden, whoſe critical abilities were equal to his poetical, had mentioned them in one of his excellent prefatory diſcourſes to his Plays, but had barely mentioned them. Johnſon has exhibited them at large, with ſuch happy illuſtration from their writings, and in ſo luminous a manner, that indeed he may be allowed the full merit of novelty, to have diſcovered to us as it were, a new planet in the poetical hemiſphere.</p>
               <p>It is remarked by Johnſon, in conſidering the works of a poet <note n="3" place="bottom">Life of Sheffield,</note>, that <q rend="inline">"amendments are ſeldom made without ſome token of a rent;"</q> but I do not find that this is applicable to proſe. We ſhall ſee that though his amendments in this work are for the better, there is nothing of the <hi>pannus aſſutus;</hi> the texture is uniform, and indeed what has been there at firſt, is very ſeldom unfit to have remained.</p>

               <p>In the Life of WALLER, Johnſon gives a diſtinct and animated narrative of publick affairs in that variegated period, with ſtrong yet nice touches of character, and having a fair opportunity to diſplay his political principles, does it with an unqualified manly confidence, and ſatisfies his readers how nobly he might have executed a <hi>Tory hiſtory</hi> of his country.</p>
               <p>So eaſy is his ſtyle in theſe Lives, that I do not recollect more than three uncommon or learned words; one, when giving an account of the approach of Waller's mortal diſeaſe, he ſays, <q rend="inline">"he found his legs grow <hi>tumid;</hi>"</q> by uſing the expreſſion his legs <hi>ſwelled,</hi> he would have avoided this; and there would have been no impropriety in its being followed by the intereſting queſtion to his phyſician, <q rend="inline">"What that <hi>ſwelling</hi> meant?"</q> Another, when he mentions that Pope had <hi>emitted</hi> propoſals; when <hi>publiſhed</hi> or <hi>iſſued,</hi> would have been more readily underſtood; and a third, when he calls Orrery and Dr. Delany, writers both undoubtedly <hi>veracious;</hi> when <hi>true, honeſt,</hi> or <hi>faithful,</hi> might have been uſed. Yet, it muſt be owned, that none of theſe are <hi>hard</hi> or <hi>too big</hi> words; that cuſtom would make them ſeem as eaſy as any others; and that a language is richer and capable of more beauty of expreſſion, by having a greater variety of ſynonimes.</p>
               <p>His diſſertation upon the unfitneſs of poetry for the aweful ſubjects of our holy religion, though I do not entirely agree with him, has all the merit of originality, with uncommon force of reaſoning.</p>

               <p>Againſt his Life of MILTON, the hounds of Whiggiſm have opened in full cry. But of Milton's great excellence as a poet, where ſhall we find ſuch a blazon as by the hand of Johnſon? I ſhall ſelect only the following paſſage concerning <q rend="inline">"Paradiſe Loſt:"</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Fancy can hardly forbear to conjecture with what temper Milton ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed the ſilent progreſs of his work, and marked his reputation ſtealing its way in a kind of ſubterraneous current, through fear and ſilence. I cannot but conceive him calm and confident, little diſappointed, not at all dejected, relying on his own merit with ſteady conſciouſneſs, and waiting without impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, the viciſſitudes of opinion, and the impartiality of a future generation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Indeed even Dr. Towers, who may be conſidered as one of the warmeſt zealots of <hi>The Revolution Society</hi> itſelf, allows, that <q rend="inline">"Johnſon has ſpoken in the higheſt terms of the abilities of that great poet, and has beſtowed on his principal poetical compoſitions, the moſt honourable encomiums <note n="5" place="bottom">
                        <p>See <q rend="inline">"An Eſſay on the Life, Character, and Writings of Dr. Samuel Johnſon,"</q> London, 1787; which is very well written, making a proper allowance for the democratical bigotry of its authour; who I cannot however but admire for his liberality in ſpeaking thus of my illuſtrious friend:</p>
                        <q>
                           <p>He poſſeſſed extraordinary powers of underſtanding, which were much cultivated by ſtudy, and ſtill more by meditation and reflection. His memory was remarkably retentive, his imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion uncommonly vigorous, and his judgement keen and penetrating. He had a ſtrong ſenſe of the importance of religion; his piety was ſincere, and ſometimes ardent; and his zeal for the intereſts of virtue was often manifeſted in his converſation and in his writings. The ſame energy which was diſplayed in his literary productions was exhibited alſo in his converſation, which was various, ſtriking, and inſtructive; and perhaps no man ever equalled him for nervous and pointed repartees.</p>
                           <p>His Dictionary, his moral Eſſays, and his productions in polite literature, will convey uſeful inſtruction, and elegant entertainment, as long as the language in which they are written ſhall be underſtood.</p>

That a man, who venerated the Church and Monarchy as Johnſon did,  ſhould ſpeak with a juſt abhorrence of Milton as a politician, or rather as a daring foe to good polity, was ſurely to be expected; and to thoſe who cenſure him, I would recommend his commentary on Milton's celebrated complaint of his ſituation, when by the lenity of Charles the Second, <q rend="inline">"A lenity of which (as Johnſon well obſerves) the world has had perhaps no other example; he, who had written in juſtification of the murder of his Sovereign, was ſafe under an <hi>Act of Oblivion.</hi>"</q> No ſooner is he ſafe than he finds himſelf in danger, <hi>fallen on evil days and evil tongues, and with darkneſs and with danger compaſs'd round.</hi> This darkneſs, had his eyes been better employed, had undoubtedly deſerved compaſſion; but to add the mention of danger was ungrateful and unjuſt. He was fallen, indeed, on <hi>evil days;</hi> the time was come in which regicides could no longer boaſt their wickedneſs. But of <hi>evil tongues</hi> to complain, required impudence at leaſt equal to his other powers: Milton, whoſe warmeſt advocates muſt allow, <q rend="inline">"that he never ſpared any aſperity of reproach, or brutality of inſolence."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have, indeed, often wondered how Milton, <q rend="inline">"an acrimonious and ſurly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican,"</q> a man <q rend="inline">"who in his domeſtick relations was ſo ſevere and arbitrary,"</q> and whoſe head was filled with the hardeſt and moſt diſmal tenets of Calviniſm, ſhould have been ſuch a poet; ſhould not only have written with ſublimity, but with beauty, and even gayety; ſhould have exquiſitely painted the ſweeteſt ſenſations of which our nature is capable; imaged the delicate raptures of connubial love; nay, ſeemed to be animated with all the ſpirit of revelry. It is a proof that in the human mind the departments of judgement and imagination, perception and temper, may ſometimes be divided by ſtrong partitions; and that the light and ſhade in the ſame character may be kept ſo diſtinct as never to be blended.</p>
               <p>In the Life of Milton, Johnſon took occaſion to maintain his own and the general opinion of the excellence of rhyme over blank verſe, in Engliſh poetry, and quotes this appoſite illuſtration of it by <q rend="inline">"an ingenious critick,"</q> that <hi>it ſeems to be verſe only to the eye</hi> 
                  <note n="6" place="bottom">One of the moſt natural inſtances of the effect of blank verſe happened to the late Earl of Hopeton. His Lordſhip obſerved one of his ſhepherds poring in the fields upon Milton's <q rend="inline">"Paradiſe Loſt;"</q> and having aſked him what book it was, the man anſwered, <q rend="inline">"An't pleaſe your Lordſhip, this is a very odd ſort of an authour: he would fain rhyme, but cannot get at it."</q>
                  </note>. The gentleman whom he thus cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſes is (as he told Mr. Seward) Mr. Lock, of Norbury Park, in Surrey, whoſe knowledge and taſte in the fine arts is univerſally celebrated; with

               <p>In drawing Dryden's character, Johnſon has given, though I ſuppoſe unintentionally, ſome touches of his own. Thus, <q rend="inline">"The power that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominated in his intellectual operations was rather ſtrong reaſon than quick ſenſibility. Upon all occaſions that were preſented, he ſtudied rather than felt; and produced ſentiments not ſuch as Nature enforces, but meditation ſupplies. With the ſimple and elemental paſſions as they ſpring ſeparate in the mind, he ſeems not much acquainted. He is, therefore, with all his variety of excellence, not often pathetick; and had ſo little ſenſibility of the power of effuſions purely natural, that he did not eſteem them in others."</q>—It may indeed be obſerved, that in all the numerous writings of Johnſon, whether in proſe or verſe, and even in his tragedy, of which the ſubject is the diſtreſs of an unfortunate Princeſs, there is not a ſingle paſſage that ever drew a tear.</p>

 The Life of POPE was written by Johnſon <hi>con amore,</hi> both from the early poſſeſſion which that writer had taken of his mind<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and from the pleaſure which he muſt have felt, in for ever ſilencing all attempts to leſſen his poetical fame, by demonſtrating his excellence, and pronouncing, a triumphant apotheoſis.—<q rend="inline">"After all this, it is ſurely ſuperfluous to anſwer the queſtion that has once been aſked, Whether Pope was a poet? otherwiſe than by aſking in return, If Pope be not a poet, where is poetry to be found? To cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcribe poetry by a definition, will only ſhew the narrowneſs of the definer; though a definition which ſhall exclude Pope will not eaſily be made. Let us look round upon the preſent time, and back upon the paſt; let enquire to whom the voice of mankind has decreed the wreath of poetry; let their productions be examined, and their claims ſtated, and the pretenſions of Pope will be no more diſputed."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I remember once to have heard Johnſon ſay, <q rend="inline">"Sir, a thouſand years may elapſe before there ſhall appear another man with a power of verſification equal to that of Pope. That power muſt undoubtedly be allowed its due ſhare in enhancing the value of his captivating compoſition."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon, who had done liberal juſtice to Warburton in his edition of Shakſpeare, which was publiſhed during the life of that powerful writer, with ſtill greater liberality took an opportunity of paying the tribute due to him when he was no longer in <q rend="inline">"high place,"</q> but numbered with the dead <note n="8" place="bottom">
                     <p>Of Johnſon's conduct towards Warburton, a very honourable notice is taken by the editor of <q rend="inline">"Tracts by Warburton, and a Warburtonian, not admitted into the Collection of their reſpective Works."</q> After an able and <q rend="inline">"fond, though not undiſtinguiſhing,"</q> conſideration of Warburton's character, he ſays, <q rend="inline">"In two immortal works, Johnſon has ſtood forth in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt rank of his admirers. By the teſtimony of ſuch a man, impertinence muſt be abaſhed, and malignity itſelf muſt be ſoftened. Of literary merit, Johnſon, as we all know, was a ſagacious but a moſt ſevere judge. Such was his diſcernment, that he pierced into the moſt ſecret Springs of human actions; and ſuch was his integrity, that he always weighed the moral characters of his fellow-creatures in the 'balance of the ſanctuary.' He was too courageous to propitiate a rival, and too proud to truckle to a ſuperiour. Warburton he knew, as I know him, and as every man of ſenſe and virtue would wiſh to be known—I mean, both from his own writings, and from the writings of thoſe who diſſented from his principles, or who envied his reputation. But, as to favours, he had never received or aſked any from the Biſhop of Glouceſter; and, if my memory fails me not, he had ſeen him only once, when they met almoſt without deſign, converſed without much effort, and parted without any laſting impreſſions of hatred or affection. Yet, with all the ardour of ſympathetick genius, Johnſon has done that ſpontaneouſly and ably, which, by ſome writers, had been before attempted injudiciouſly, and which, by others, from whom more ſucceſsful attempts might have been expected, has not <hi>hitherto</hi> been done at all. He ſpoke well of Warburton, without inſulting thoſe whom Warburton deſpiſed. He ſuppreſſed not the imperfections of this extraordinary man, while he endeavoured to do juſtice to his numerous and tranſcendental excellencies. He defended him when living, amidſt the clamours of his enemies; and praiſed him when dead, amidſt the <hi>ſilence of his friends.</hi>

                     <p>Having availed myſelf of this editor's eulogy on my departed friend, for which I warmly thank him, let me not ſuffer the luſtre of his reputation, honeſtly acquired by profound learning and vigorous eloquence, to be tarniſhed by a charge of illiberality. He has been accuſed of invidiouſly dragging again into light certain writings of a perſon reſpectable by his talents, his learning, his ſtation, and his age, which were publiſhed a great many years ago, and have ſince, it is ſaid, been ſilently given up by their authour. But when it is conſidered that theſe writings were not <hi>ſins of youth,</hi> but deliberate works of one well advanced in life, overflowing at once with flattery to a great man of great intereſt in the Church, and with unjuſt and acrimonious abuſe of two men of eminent merit; and that, though it would have been unreaſonable to expect an humiliating recantation, no apology whatever has been made in the cool of the evening, for the oppreſſive fervour of the heat of the day; no ſlight relenting indication has appeared in any note, or any corner of later publications; is it not fair to underſtand him as ſuperciliouſly perſevering? When he allows the ſhafts to remain in the wounds, and will not ſtretch forth a lenient hand, is it wrong, is it not generous to become an indignant avenger?</p>

It ſeems ſtrange, that two ſuch men as Johnſon and Warburton, who lived  in the ſame age and country, ſhould not only not have been in any degree of intimacy, but been almoſt perſonally unacquainted. But ſuch inſtances, though we muſt wonder at them, are not rare. If I am rightly informed, after a careful inquiry, they never met but once, which was at the houſe of Mrs. French, in London, well known for her elegant aſſemblies, and bringing eminent characters together. The interview proved to be mutually agreeable.</p>
               <p>I am well informed, that Warburton ſaid of Johnſon, <q rend="inline">"I admire him, but I cannot bear his ſtyle:"</q> and that Johnſon being told of this, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"That is exactly my caſe as to him."</q> The manner in which he expreſſed his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the fertility of Warburton's genius and of the variety of his materials, was, <q rend="inline">"The table is always full, Sir. He brings things from the north, and the ſouth, and from every quarter. In his 'Divine Legation,' you are always entertained. He carries you round and round, without carrying you forward to the point; but then you have no wiſh to be carried forward."</q> He ſaid to the Reverend Mr. Strahan, <q rend="inline">"Warburton is perhaps the laſt man who has written with a mind full of reading and reflection."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is remarkable, that in the Life of Broome, Johnſon takes notice of Dr. Warburton's uſing a mode of expreſſion which he himſelf uſed, and that not ſeldom, to the great offence of thoſe who did not know him. Having occaſion to mention a note, ſtating the different parts which were executed by the aſſociated tranſlators of <q rend="inline">"The Odyſſey,"</q> he ſays, <q rend="inline">"Dr. Warburton told me, in his warm language, that he thought the relation given in the note <hi>a lie.</hi>"</q> The language is <hi>warm</hi> indeed; and, I muſt own, cannot be
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:0548300102:356" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 juſtified in conſiſtency with a decent regard to the eſtabliſhed forms of ſpeech. Johnſon had accuſtomed himſelf to uſe the word <hi>lie,</hi> to expreſs a miſtake or an errour in relation; in ſhort, when the thing <hi>was not ſo as told,</hi> though the relator did not <hi>mean</hi> to deceive. When he thought there was intentional falſehood in the relator, his expreſſion was, <q rend="inline">"He <hi>lies,</hi> and he <hi>knows</hi> he <hi>lies.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Speaking of Pope's not having been known to excel in converſation, Johnſon obſerves, that <q rend="inline">"traditional memory retains no ſallies of raillery, or ſentences of obſervation; nothing either pointed or ſolid, wiſe or merry; and that one apophthegm only is recorded."</q> In this reſpect, Pope differed widely from Johnſon, whoſe converſation was, perhaps, more admirable than even his writings, however excellent. Mr. Wilkes has, however, favoured me with one repartee of Pope, of which Johnſon was not informed. Johnſon, after juſtly cenſuring him for having <q rend="inline">"nurſed in his mind a fooliſh diſ-eſteem of Kings,"</q> tells us, <q rend="inline">"yet a little regard ſhewn him by the Prince of Wales melted his obduracy; and he had not much to ſay when he was aſked by his Royal Highneſs, <hi>how he could love a Prince, while he diſliked Kings?</hi>"</q> The anſwer which Pope made, was, <q rend="inline">"The young lion is harmleſs, and even playful; but when his claws are full grown he becomes cruel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> dreadful, and miſchievous."</q>
               </p>
               <p>But although we have no collection of Pope's ſayings, it is not therefore to be concluded, that he was not agreeable in ſocial intercourſe; for Johnſon himſelf has been heard to ſay, that <q rend="inline">"the happieſt converſation is that of which nothing is diſtinctly remembered but a general effect of pleaſing impreſſion."</q> The late Lord Somerville <note n="9" place="bottom">Let me here expreſs my grateful remembrance of Lord Somerville's kindneſs to me, at a very early period. He was the firſt perſon of high rank that took particular notice of me in the way moſt flattering to a young man, fondly ambitious of being diſtinguiſhed for his literary talents; and by the honour of his encouragement made me think well of myſelf, and aſpire to deſerve it better. He had a happy art of communicating his varied knowledge of the world, in ſhort remarks and anecdotes, with a quiet pleaſant gravity, that was exceedingly engaging. Never ſhall I forget the hours which I enjoyed with him at his apartments in the Royal Palace of Holy-Rood Houſe, and at his ſeat near Edinburgh, which he himſelf had formed with an elegant taſte.</note>, who ſaw much both of great and brilliant life, told me, that he had dined in company with Pope, and that after dinner the <hi>little man,</hi> as he called him, drank his bottle of Burgundy, and was exceedingly gay and entertaining.</p>
               <p>I cannot with-hold from my great friend a cenſure of at leaſt culpable inattention, to a nobleman, who, it has been ſhewn, behaved to him with uncommon politeneſs. He ſays, <q rend="inline">"Except Lord Bathurſt, none of Pope's
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:0548300102:357" rendition="simple:additions"/>
noble friends were ſuch as that a good man would wiſh to have his inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy  with them known to poſterity."</q> This will not apply to Lord Mansfield, who was not ennobled in Pope's life-time; but Johnſon ſhould have recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, that Lord Marchmont was one of thoſe noble friends. He includes his Lordſhip along with Lord Bolingbroke, in a charge of neglect of the papers which Pope left by his will; when, in truth, as I myſelf pointed out to him, before he wrote that poet's life, the papers were <q rend="inline">"committed to <hi>the ſole care and judgement</hi> of Lord Bolingbroke, unleſs he (Lord Bolingbroke) ſhall not ſurvive me;"</q> ſo that Lord Marchmont had no concern whatever with them. After the firſt edition of the Lives, Mr. Malone, whoſe love of juſtice is equal to his accuracy, made, in my hearing, the ſame remark to Johnſon; yet he omitted to correct the erroneous ſtatement. Theſe particulars I mention, in the belief that there was only forgetfulneſs in my friend; but I owe this much to the Earl of Marchmont's reputation, who, were there no other memorials, will be immortaliſed by that line of Pope, in the verſes on his Grotto:

               <p>In the Life of ADDISON we find an unpleaſing account of his having lent Steele a hundred pounds, and <q rend="inline">"reclaimed his loan by an execution."</q> In the new edition of the <hi>Biographia Britannica,</hi> the authenticity of this anecdote is denied. But Mr. Malone has obliged me with the following note concerning it:</p>

                           <p>Many perſons having doubts concerning this fact, I applied to Dr. Johnſon to learn on what authority he aſſerted it. He told me, he had it from Savage, who lived in intimacy with Steele, and who informed him, that Steele told him the ſtory with tears in his eyes.—Ben Victor, Dr. Johnſon ſaid, likewiſe informed him of this remarkable tranſaction, from the relation of Mr. Wilkes the comedian, who was alſo an intimate of Steele's.—Some, in defence of Addiſon, have ſaid, that <q rend="inline">'the act was done with the good-natured view of rouſing Steele, and correcting that profuſion which always made him neceſſitous.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'If that were the caſe, (ſaid Johnſon,) and that he only wanted to alarm Steele, he would afterwards have <hi>returned</hi> the money to his friend, which it is not pretended he did.'</q>—<q rend="inline">'This, too, (he added,) might be retorted by an advocate for Steele, who might alledge, that he did not repay the loan <hi>intentionally,</hi> merely to ſee whether Addiſon would be mean and ungenerous enough to make uſe of legal proceſs to recover it. But of ſuch ſpeculations there is no end: we cannot dive into the hearts of men; but their actions are open to obſervation.'</q>

I then mentioned to him that ſome people thought that Mr. Addiſon's  character was ſo pure, that the fact, <hi>though true,</hi> ought to have been ſuppreſſed. He ſaw no reaſon for this. <q rend="inline">'If nothing but the bright ſide of characters ſhould be ſhewn, we ſhould ſit down in deſpondency, and think it utterly impoſſible to imitate them in <hi>any thing.</hi> The ſacred writers (he obſerved) related the vicious as well as the virtuous actions of men; which had this moral effect, that it kept mankind from <hi>deſpair,</hi> into which otherwiſe they would naturally fall, were they not ſupported by the recollection that others had offended like themſelves, and by penitence and amendment of life had been reſtored to the favour of Heaven.'</q>

               <p>In his Life of PARNELL, I wonder that Johnſon omitted to inſert an Epitaph which he had long before compoſed for that amiable man, without ever writing it down, but which he was ſo good as, at my requeſt, to dictate me, by which means it has been preſerved.</p>

               <p>In the Life of BLACKMORE, we find that writer's reputation generouſly cleared by Johnſon, from the cloud of prejudice which the malignity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporary wits had raiſed around it.

               <p>As the introduction to his critical examination of the genius and writings of YOUNG, he did Mr. Herbert Croft, then a Barriſter of Lincoln's-inn, now a clergyman, the honour to adopt a Life of Young written by that gentleman, who was the friend of Dr. Young's ſon, and wiſhed to vindicate him from ſome very miſtaken remarks to his prejudice. Mr. Croft's performance was ſubjected to the reviſion of Dr. Johnſon, as appears from the following note to Mr. John Nichols:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"This Life of Dr. Young was written by a friend of his ſon. What is croſſed with black is expunged by the authour, what is croſſed with red is expunged by me. If you find any thing more that can be well omitted, I ſhall not be ſorry to ſee it yet ſhorter."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It has always appeared to me to have a conſiderable ſhare of merit, and to diſplay a pretty ſucceſsful imitation of Johnſon's ſtyle. When I mentioned this to a very eminent literary character, he oppoſed me vehemently, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, <q rend="inline">"No, no, it is <hi>not</hi> a good imitation of Johnſon; it has all his pomp without his force; it has all the nodoſities of the oak without its ſtrength."</q> This was an image ſo happy, that one might have thought he would have
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:0548300102:364" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 been ſatisfied with it; but he was not. And ſetting his mind again to work, he added, with exquiſite felicity, <q rend="inline">"It has all the contortions of the Sybil, without the inſpiration."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Croft very properly guards us againſt ſuppoſing that Young was a gloomy man; and mentions, that <q rend="inline">"his pariſh was indebted to the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humour of the authour of the <hi>'Night Thoughts'</hi> for an Aſſembly and a Bowling-Green."</q> A letter from a noble foreigner is quoted, in which he is ſaid to have been <q rend="inline">"very pleaſant in converſation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Langton, who frequently viſited him, informs me, that there was an air of benevolence in his manner, but that he could obtain from him leſs information than he had hoped to receive from one who had lived ſo much in intercourſe with the brighteſt men of what has been called the Auguſtan age of England; and that he ſhewed a degree of eager curioſity concerning the common occurrences that were then paſſing, which appeared ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what remarkable in a man of ſuch intellectual ſtores, of ſuch an advanced age, and who had retired from life with declared diſappointment in his expectations.</p>
               <p>An inſtance at once of his penſive turn of mind, and his cheerfulneſs of temper, appeared in a little ſtory which he himſelf told to Mr. Langton, when they were walking in his garden: <q rend="inline">"Here (ſaid he) I had put a handſome ſun-dial, with this inſcription, <hi>Eheu fugaces!</hi> which (ſpeaking with a ſmile) was ſadly verified, for by the next morning my dial had been carried off."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It gives me much pleaſure to obſerve, that however Johnſon may have caſually talked, yet when he ſits, as <q rend="inline">"an ardent judge zealous to his truſt, giving ſentence,"</q> upon the excellent works of Young, he allows them the high praiſe to which they are juſtly entitled. <q rend="inline">"The <hi>Univerſal Paſſion</hi> (ſays he) is indeed a very great performance,—his diſtichs have the weight of ſolid ſentiment, and his points the ſharpneſs of reſiſtleſs truth."</q>
               </p>
               <p>But I was moſt anxious concerning Johnſon's deciſion upon <q rend="inline">"Night Thoughts,"</q> which I eſteem as a maſs of the grandeſt and richeſt poetry that human genius has ever produced; and was delighted to find this character of that work: <q rend="inline">"In his <hi>'Night Thoughts'</hi> he has exhibited a very wide diſplay of original poetry, variegated with deep reflections and ſtriking alluſions; a wilderneſs of thought, in which the fertility of fancy ſcatters flowers of every hue and of every odour. This is one of the few poems in which blank verſe could not be changed for rhime but with diſadvantage."</q> And afterwards, <q rend="inline">"Particular lines are not to be regarded, the power is in the whole, and in

               </p>
               <p>But there is in this Poem not only all that Johnſon ſo well brings in view, but a power of the <hi>Pathetick</hi> beyond almoſt any example that I have ſeen. He who does not feel his nerves ſhaken, and his heart pierced by many paſſages in this extraordinary work, particularly by that moſt affecting one, which deſcribes the gradual torment ſuffered by the contemplation of an object of affectionate attachment, viſibly and certainly decaying into diſſolution, muſt be of a hard and obſtinate frame.</p>
               <p>To all the other excellencies of <q rend="inline">"Night Thoughts,"</q> let me add the great and peculiar one, that they contain not only the nobleſt ſentiments of virtue, and the immortality of the ſoul, but the <hi>Chriſtian Sacrifice,</hi> the <hi>Divine Propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation,</hi> with all its intereſting circumſtances, and conſolations to <q rend="inline">"a wounded ſpirit,"</q> ſolemnly and poetically diſplayed in ſuch imagery and language, as cannot fail to exalt, animate, and ſoothe the truly pious. No book whatever can be recommended to young perſons, with better hopes of ſeaſoning their minds with <hi>vital religion</hi> than YOUNG'S <q rend="inline">"NIGHT THOUGHTS."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the Life of SWIFT, it appears to me that Johnſon had a certain degree of prejudice againſt that extraordinary man, of which I have elſewhere had occaſion to ſpeak. Mr. Thomas Sheridan imputed it to a ſuppoſed appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion in Johnſon, that Swift had not been ſufficiently active in obtaining for him an Iriſh degree when it was ſolicited <note n="3" place="bottom">See page 67 of Vol. I.</note>, but of this there was not ſufficient evidence; and let me not preſume to charge Johnſon with injuſtice, becauſe he did not think ſo highly of the writings of this authour, as I have done from my youth upwards. Yet that he had an unfavourable bias is evident, were it only from that paſſage in which he ſpeaks of Swift's practice of ſaving, as, <q rend="inline">"firſt ridiculous and at laſt deteſtable;"</q> and yet after ſome examination of circumſtances, finds himſelf obliged to own, that <q rend="inline">"it will perhaps appear that he only liked one mode of expence better than another, and ſaved merely that he might have ſomething to give."</q>
               </p>
               <p>One obſervation which Johnſon makes in Swift's life ſhould be often inculcated: <q rend="inline">"It may be juſtly ſuppoſed, that there was in his converſation what appears ſo frequently in his letters, an affectation of familiarity with the great, an ambition of momentary equality, ſought and enjoyed by the neglect of thoſe ceremonies which cuſtom has eſtabliſhed as the barriers between one order of ſociety and another. This tranſgreſſion of regularity was by himſelf and his admirers termed greatneſs of ſoul; but a great mind diſdains to hold

 any thing by courteſy, and therefore never uſurps what a lawful claimant may take away. He that encroaches on another's dignity puts himſelf in his power; he is either repelled with helpleſs indignity, or endured by clemency and condeſcenſion."</q>

               <p>I have not confined myſelf to the order of the <q rend="inline">"Lives,"</q> in making my few remarks. Indeed a different order is obſerved in the original publication, and in the collection of Johnſon's Works. And ſhould it be objected, that many of my various readings are inconſiderable, thoſe who make the objection will be pleaſed to conſider, that ſuch ſmall particulars are intended for thoſe who are nicely critical in compoſition, to whom they will be an acceptable ſelection.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">"Spence's Anecdotes,"</q> which are frequently quoted and referred to in  Johnſon's <q rend="inline">"Lives of the Poets,"</q> are in a manuſcript collection, made by the Reverend Dr. Joſeph Spence, containing a number of particulars concerning eminent men. To each anecdote is marked the name of the perſon on whoſe authority it is mentioned. This valuable collection is the property of the Duke of Newcaſtle, who upon the application of Sir Lucas Pepys, was pleaſed to permit it to be put into the hands of Dr. Johnſon, who I am ſorry to think made but an aukward return. <q rend="inline">"Great aſſiſtance (ſays he) has been given me by Mr. Spence's Collection, of which I conſider the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as a favour worthy of publick acknowledgement;"</q> but he has not owned to whom he was obliged; ſo that the acknowledgement is unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to his Grace.</p>
               <p>While the world in general was filled with admiration of Johnſon's <q rend="inline">"Lives of the Poets,"</q> there were narrow circles in which prejudice and reſentment were foſtered, and from whence attacks of different ſorts iſſued againſt him. By ſome violent Whigs he was arraigned of injuſtice to Milton; by ſome Cambridge men of depreciating Gray, and his expreſſing with a dignified freedom what he really thought of George, Lord Lyttelton, gave offence to ſome of the friends of that nobleman, and particularly produced a declaration of war againſt him from Mrs. Montague, the ingenious Eſſayiſt on Shakſpeare, between whom and his Lordſhip a commerce of reciprocal compliments had long been carried on. In this war the ſmaller powers in alliance with him were of courſe led to engage, at leaſt on the defenſive, and thus I for one, was excluded from the enjoyment of <q rend="inline">"A Feaſt of Reaſon,"</q> ſuch as Mr. Cumberland has deſcribed, with a keen, yet juſt and delicate pen, in his <q rend="inline">"OBSERVER."</q> Theſe minute inconveniencies gave not the leaſt diſturbance to Johnſon. He nobly ſaid, when I talked to him of the feeble, though ſhrill outcry which had been raiſed, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I conſidered myſelf as entruſted with a certain portion of truth. I have given my opinion ſincerely; let them ſhew where they think me wrong."</q>

               <p>While my friend is thus contemplated in the ſplendour derived from his laſt and perhaps moſt admirable work, I introduce him with peculiar propriety as the correſpondent of WARREN HASTINGS, a man whoſe regard reflects dignity even upon JOHNSON; a man, the extent of whoſe abilities was equal to that of his power; and who, by thoſe who are fortunate enough to know him in private life, is admired for his literature and taſte, and beloved for the candour, moderation, and mildneſs of his character.

                     <p>I HAVE been fortunately ſpared the troubleſome ſuſpenſe of a long ſearch, to which, in performance of my promiſe, I had devoted this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by lighting upon the objects of it among the firſt papers that I laid my hands on: my veneration for your great and good friend, Dr. Johnſon, and the pride, or I hope ſomething of a better ſentiment, which I indulged in poſſeſſing ſuch memorials of his good-will towards me, having induced me to bind them in a parcel containing other ſelect papers, and labelled with the titles appertaining to them. They conſiſt but of three letters, which I believe were all that I ever received from Dr. Johnſon. Of theſe, one, which was written in quadruplicate, under the different dates of its reſpective diſpatches, has already been made publick, but not from any communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mine. This, however, I have joined to the reſt; and have now the pleaſure of ſending them to you for the uſe to which you informed me it was your deſire to deſtine them.</p>
                     <p>My promiſe was pledged with the condition, that if the letters were found to contain any thing which ſhould render them improper for the publick eye, you would diſpenſe with the performance of it. You will have the goodneſs, I am ſure, to pardon my recalling this ſtipulation to your recollection, as I ſhould be loth to appear negligent of that obligation which is always implied in an epiſtolary confidence. In the reſervation of that right I have read them over with the moſt ſcrupulous attention, but have not ſeen in them the ſlighteſt cauſe on that ground to with-hold them from you. But, though not on that, yet on another ground I own I feel a little, yet but a little, reluctance to part with them: I mean on that of my own

credit, which I fear will ſuffer by the information conveyed by them, that I  was early in the poſſeſſion of ſuch valuable inſtructions for the beneficial employment of the influence of my late ſtation, and (as it may ſeem) have ſo little availed myſelf of them. Whether I could, if it were neceſſary, defend myſelf againſt ſuch an imputation, it little concerns the world to know. I look only to the effect which theſe relicks may produce, conſidered as evidences of the virtues of their authour: and believing that they will be found to diſplay an uncommon warmth of private friendſhip, and a mind ever attentive to the improvement and extenſion of uſeful knowledge, and ſolicitous for the intereſts of mankind, I can cheerfully ſubmit to the little ſacrifice of my own fame to contribute to the illuſtration of ſo great and venerable a character. They cannot be better applied, for that end, than by being entruſted to your hands. Allow me, with this offering, to infer from it a proof of the very great eſteem with which I have the honour to profeſs myſelf,</p>

                     <p>THOUGH I have had but little perſonal knowledge of you, I have had enough to make me wiſh for more; and though it be now a long time ſince I was honoured by your viſit, I had too much pleaſure from it to forget it. By thoſe whom we delight to remember, we are unwilling to be forgotten; and therefore I cannot omit this opportunity of reviving myſelf in your memory by a letter which you will receive from the hands of my friend Mr. Chambers <note n="5" place="bottom">Now Sir Robert Chalmers, one of his Majeſty's Judges in India.</note>; a man, whoſe purity of manners and vigour of mind are ſufficient to make every thing welcome that he brings.</p>

 That this is my only reaſon for writing, will be too apparent by the uſeleſſneſs of my letter to any other purpoſe. I have no queſtions to aſk; not that I want curioſity after either the ancient or preſent ſtate of regions, in which have been ſeen all the power and ſplendour of wide-extended empire; and which, as by ſome grant of natural ſuperiority, ſupply the reſt of the world with almoſt all that pride deſires, and luxury enjoys. But my knowledge of them is too ſcanty to furniſh me with proper topicks of enquiry; I can only wiſh for information; and hope, that a mind compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive like yours will find leiſure, amidſt the cares of your important ſtation, to enquire into many ſubjects of which the European world either thinks not at all, or thinks with deficient intelligence and uncertain conjecture. I ſhall hope, that he who once intended to increaſe the learning of his country by the introduction of the Perſian language, will examine nicely the traditions and hiſtories of the Eaſt; that he will ſurvey the wonders of its ancient edifices, and trace the veſtiges of its ruined cities; and that, at his return, we ſhall know the arts and opinions of a race of men, from whom very little has been hitherto derived.</p>
                     <p>You, Sir, have no need of being told by me, how much may be added by your attention and patronage to experimental knowledge and natural hiſtory. There are arts of manufacture practiſed in the countries in which you preſide, which are yet very imperfectly known here, either to artificers or philoſophers. Of the natural productions, animate and inanimate, we yet have ſo little intelligence, that our books are filled, I fear, with conjectures about things which an Indian peaſant knows by his ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>Many of thoſe things my firſt wiſh is to ſee; my ſecond to know by ſuch accounts as a man like you will be able to give.</p>
                     <p>As I have not ſkill to aſk proper queſtions, I have likewiſe no ſuch acceſs to great men as can enable me to ſend you any political informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Of the agitations of an unſettled government, and the ſtruggles of a feeble miniſtry, care is doubtleſs taken to give you more exact accounts than I can obtain. If you are inclined to intereſt yourſelf much in publick tranſactions, it is no misfortune to you to be ſo diſtant from them.</p>

                     <p>With this well-choſén motto:</p>

                  </note> of him publiſhed by Kearſley, very ſoon after his death: <q rend="inline">"When he walked the ſtreets, what with the conſtant roll of his head, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant motion of his body, he appeared to make his way by that motion, independent of his feet."</q> That he was often much ſtared at while he advanced in this manner, may eaſily be believed; but it was not ſafe to make ſport of one ſo robuſt as he was. Mr. Langton ſaw him one day, in a fit of abſence, by a ſudden ſtart, drive the load off a porter's back, and walk forward briſkly, without being conſcious of what he had done. The porter was very angry, but ſtood ſtill, and eyed the huge figure with much earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, till he was ſatisfied that his wiſeſt courſe was to be quiet, and take up his burthen again.</p>
               <p>Our accidental meeting in the ſtreet after a long ſeparation was a pleaſing ſurprize to us both. He ſtepped aſide with me into Falcon-court, and made kind inquiries about my family, and as we were in a hurry going different ways, I promiſed to call on him next day; he ſaid he was engaged to go out in the morning. <q rend="inline">"Early, Sir."</q> ſaid I. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, a London morning does not go with the ſun."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I waited on him next evening, and he gave me a quantity of his original manuſcript of his <q rend="inline">"Lives of the Poets,"</q> which he had preſerved for me.</p>
               <p>I found that his friend, Mr. Thrale, was now very ill, and had removed, I ſuppoſe by the ſolicitation of Mrs. Thrale, to a houſe in Groſvenor-ſquare. I was ſorry to find him ſadly changed in his appearance.</p>
               <p>He told me I might now have the pleaſure to ſee Dr. Johnſon drink wine again, for he had lately returned to it. When I mentioned this to Johnſon, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I drink it now ſometimes, but not ſocially."</q> The firſt evening that I was with him at Thrale's, I obſerved he poured a quantity of it into a large glaſs, and ſwallowed it greedily. Every thing about his character and manners was forcible and violent; there never was any moderation; many a day did he faſt, many a year did he refrain from wine; but when he did eat, it was voraciouſly; when he did drink wine, it was copiouſly. He could practiſe abſtinence, but not temperance.</p>

               <p>I told him of one of Mr. Burke's playful ſallies upon Dean Marlay. <q rend="inline">"I don't like the Deanery of <hi>Ferns,</hi> it ſounds ſo like a <hi>barren</hi> title."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Dr. <hi>Heath</hi> ſhould have it;"</q> ſaid I.

               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Mrs. Montagu has dropt me. Now, Sir, there are people whom one ſhould like very well to drop, but would not wiſh to be dropped by."</q> He certainly was vain of the ſociety of ladies, and could make himſelf very agreeable to them when he choſe it; Sir Joſhua Reynolds agreed with me that he could. Mr. Gibbon, with his uſual ſneer, controverted it, perhaps in reſentment of Johnſon's having talked with ſome diſguſt of his uglineſs, which one ſhould think a <hi>philoſopher</hi> would not mind. Dean Marlay wittily obſerved, <q rend="inline">"A lady may be vain when ſhe can turn a wolf-dog into a lap-dog."</q>

               <p>The election for Ayrſhire, my own county, was this ſpring tried upon a petition, before a Committee of the Houſe of Commons. I was one of the Counſel for the ſitting member, and took the liberty of previouſly ſtating different points to Johnſon, who never failed to ſee them clearly, and to ſupply me with ſome good hints. He dictated to me the following note upon the regiſtration of deeds:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"ALL laws are made for the convenience of the community; what is legally done, ſhould be legally recorded, that the ſtate of things may be
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:0548300102:375" rendition="simple:additions"/>
known, and that wherever evidence is requiſite, evidence may be had. For  this reaſon, the obligation to frame and eſtabliſh a legal regiſter is enforced by a legal penalty, which penalty is the want of that perfection and plenitude of right which a regiſter would give. Thence it follows, that this is not an objection merely legal; for the reaſon on which the law ſtands being equitable, makes it an equitable objection."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"This (ſaid he) you muſt enlarge on, when ſpeaking to the Committee. You muſt not argue there, as if you were arguing in the ſchools; cloſe reaſoning will not fix their attention; you muſt ſay the ſame thing over and over again, in different words. If you ſay it but once, they miſs it in a moment of inattention. It is unjuſt, Sir, to cenſure lawyers for multiplying words when they argue; it is <hi>neceſſary</hi> for them to multiply words."</q>
               </p>
               <p>His notion of the duty of a member of Parliament, ſitting upon an election committee was very high; and when he was told of a gentleman upon one of thoſe committees, who read the newſpapers part of the time, and ſlept the reſt, while the merits of a vote were examined by the counſel, and as an excuſe, when challenged by the chairman for ſuch behaviour, bluntly anſwered, <q rend="inline">"I had made up my mind upon that caſe."</q> Johnſon, with an indignant contempt, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"If he was ſuch a rogue as to make up his mind upon a caſe without hearing it, he ſhould not have been ſuch a fool as to tell it."</q>—<q rend="inline">"I think (ſaid Mr. Dudley Long) the Doctor has pretty plainly made him out to be both rogue and fool."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon's profound reverence for the Hierarchy made him expect from Biſhops the higheſt degree of decorum; he was offended even at their going to taverns; <q rend="inline">"A biſhop (ſaid he) has nothing to do at a tippling-houſe. It is not indeed immoral in him to go to a tavern; neither would it be immoral in him to whip a top in Groſvenor-ſquare. But, if he did, I hope the boys would fall upon him and apply the whip to <hi>him.</hi> There are gradations in conduct; there is morality—decency—propriety. None of theſe ſhould be violated by a biſhop. A biſhop ſhould not go to a houſe where he may meet a young fellow leading out a wench."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, every tavern does not admit women."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Depend upon it, Sir, any tavern will admit a well-dreſt man and a well-dreſt woman; they will not perhaps admit a woman whom they ſee every night walking by their door, in the ſtreet. But a well-dreſt man may lead in a well-dreſt woman to any tavern in London. Taverns ſell meat and drink, and will ſell them to any body who can eat and can drink. You may as well ſay that a mercer will not ſell ſilks to a woman of the town."</q>

                  <pb n="374" facs="tcp:0548300102:376" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 He alſo diſapproved of biſhops going to routs, at leaſt of their ſtaying at them longer than their preſence commanded reſpect. He mentioned a particular biſhop. <q rend="inline">"Poh (ſaid Mrs. Thrale) the Biſhop of—is never minded at a rout."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"When a Biſhop places himſelf in a ſituation where he has no diſtinct character, and is of no conſequence, he degrades the dignity of his order."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Mr. Boſwell, Madam, has ſaid it as correctly as could be."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nor was it only in the dignitaries of the Church that Johnſon required a particular decorum and delicacy of behaviour; he juſtly conſidered that the clergy, as men ſet apart for the ſacred office of ſerving at the altar, and impreſſing the minds of men with the aweful concerns of a future ſtate, ſhould be ſomewhat more ſerious than the generality of mankind, and have a ſuitable compoſure of manners. A due ſenſe of the dignity of their profeſſion, independent of higher motives, will ever prevent them from loſing their diſtinction in an indiſcriminate ſociality; and did ſuch as affect this, know how much it leſſens them in the eyes of thoſe whom they think to pleaſe by it, they would feel themſelves much mortified.</p>
               <p>Johnſon, and his friend, Beauclerk, were once together in company with ſeveral clergymen, who thought they ſhould appear to advantage, by aſſuming the lax jollity of <hi>men of the world;</hi> which, as it may be obſerved in ſimilar caſes, they carried to noiſy exceſs. Johnſon, who they expected would be <hi>enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained,</hi> ſate grave and ſilent for ſome time; at laſt, turning to Beauclerk, he ſaid, by no means in a whiſper, <q rend="inline">"This merriment of parſons is mighty offenſive."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Even the dreſs of a clergyman ſhould be in character, and nothing can be more deſpicable than conceited at<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>empts at avoiding the appearance of the clerical order; attempts, which are as ineffectual as they are pitiful. Dr. Porteus, now Biſhop of London, in his excellent charge when preſiding over the dioceſe of Cheſter, juſtly animadverts upon this ſubject; and obſerves of a reverend ſop, that he <q rend="inline">"can be but <hi>half a beau.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Addiſon, in <q rend="inline">"The Spectator,"</q> has given us a fine portrait of a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who is ſuppoſed to be a member of his <hi>Club;</hi> and Johnſon has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited a model, in the character of Mr. Mudge <note n="1" place="bottom">See Vol. I. p. 206.</note>, which has eſcaped the collectors of his works, but which he owned to me, and which indeed he ſhewed to Sir Joſhua Reynolds at the time when it was written. It bears the genuine marks of Johnſon's beſt manner, and is as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <pb n="375" facs="tcp:0548300102:377" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>The Reverend Mr. <hi>Zachariah Mudge,</hi> Prebendary of Exeter, and Vicar  of St. Andrews in Plymouth; a man equally eminent for his virtues and abilities, and at once beloved as a companion and reverenced as a paſtor. He had that general curioſity to which no kind of knowledge is indifferent or ſuperfluous; and that general benevolence by which no order of men is hated or deſpiſed.</p>
                  <p>His principles both of thought and action were great and comprehenſive. By a ſolicitous examination of objections, and judicious compariſon of oppoſite arguments, he attained what enquiry never gives but to induſtry and perſpicuity, a firm and unſhaken ſettlement of conviction. But his firmneſs was without aſperity; for, knowing with how much difficulty truth was ſometimes found, he did not wonder that many miſſed it.</p>
                  <p>The general courſe of his life was determined by his profeſſion; he ſtudied the ſacred volumes in the original languages; with what diligence and ſucceſs, his <hi>Notes upon the Pſalms</hi> give ſufficient evidence. He once endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to add the knowledge of Arabick to that of Hebrew; but finding his thoughts too much diverted from other ſtudies, after ſome time, deſiſted from his purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>His diſcharge of parochial duties was exemplary. How his <hi>Sermons</hi> were compoſed, may be learned from the excellent volume which he has given to the publick; but how they were delivered, can be known only to thoſe that heard them, for as he appeared in the pulpit, words will not eaſily deſcribe him. His delivery, though unconſtrained was not negligent, and though forcible was not turbulent; diſdaining anxious nicety of emphaſis, and laboured artifice of action, it captivated the hearer by its natural dignity, it rouſed the ſluggiſh, and fixed the volatile, and detained the mind upon the ſubject, without directing it to the ſpeaker.</p>
                  <p>The grandeur and ſolemnity of the preacher did not intrude upon his general behaviour; at the table of his friends he was a companion com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municative and attentive, of unaffected manners, of manly cheerfulneſs, willing to pleaſe, and eaſy to be pleaſed. His acquaintance was univerſally ſolicited, and his preſence obſtructed no enjoyment which religion did not forbid. Though ſtudious he was popular; though argumentative he was modeſt; though inflexible he was candid; and though metaphyſical yet orthodox <note n="2" place="bottom">

 On Friday, March 30, I dined with him at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's, with the Earl of Charlemont, Sir Anneſley Stewart, Mr. Eliot, of Port-Eliot, Mr. Burke, Dean Marlay, now Biſhop of Clonfert, Mr. Langton; a moſt agreeable day, of which I regret that every circumſtance is not preſerved; but it is unreaſonable to require ſuch a multiplication of felicity.</p>
               <p>Mr. Eliot, with whom Dr. Walter Harte had travelled, talked to us of his <q rend="inline">"Hiſtory of Guſtavus Adolphus,"</q> which he ſaid was a very good book in the German tranſlation. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Harte was exceſſively vain. He put copies of his book in manuſcript into the hands of Lord Cheſterfield and Lord Granville, that they might reviſe it. Now, how abſurd was it to ſuppoſe that two ſuch noblemen would reviſe ſo big a manuſcript. Poor man! he left London the day of the publication of his book, that he might be out of the way of the great praiſe he was to receive; and he was aſhamed to return, when he found how ill his book had ſucceeded. It was unlucky in coming out on the ſame day with Robertſon's 'Hiſtory of Scotland.' His huſbandry, however, is good."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"So he was fitter for that than for heroick hiſtory. He did well when he turned his ſword into a plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhare."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Eliot mentioned a curious liquor peculiar to his country, which the Corniſh fiſhermen drink. They call it <hi>Mahogany;</hi> and it is made of two parts gin, and one part treacle, well beat together. I begged to have ſome of it made, which was done with proper ſkill by Mr. Eliot. I thought it very good liquor; and ſaid it was a counterpart of what is called <hi>Athol Porridge</hi> in the Highlands of Scotland, which is a mixture of whiſky and honey. Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"that muſt be a better liquor than the Corniſh, for both its component parts are better."</q> He alſo obſerved, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Mahogany</hi> muſt be a modern name; for it was not long ſince the wood called mahogany was known in this country."</q> I mentioned his ſcale of liquors;—claret for boys—port for men—brandy for heroes. <q rend="inline">"Then (ſaid Mr. Burke) let me have claret: I love to be a boy; to have the careleſs gaiety of boyiſh days."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I ſhould drink claret too, if it would give me that; but it does not: it neither makes boys men, nor men boys. You'll be drowned by it before it has any effect upon you."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ventured to mention a ludicrous paragraph in the news-papers, that Dr. Johnſon was learning to dance of Veſtris. Lord Charlemont, wiſhing to excite him to talk, propoſed, in a whiſper, that he ſhould be aſked, whether it was true. <q rend="inline">"Shall I aſk him?"</q> ſaid his Lordſhip. We were, by a great majority, clear for the experiment. Upon which his Lordſhip very gravely
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:0548300102:379" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and with a courteous air ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, is it true that you are taking  leſſons of Veſtris?"</q> This was riſking a good deal, and required the boldneſs of a General of Iriſh Volunteers to make the attempt. Johnſon was at firſt ſtartled, and in ſome heat anſwered, <q rend="inline">"How can your Lordſhip aſk ſo ſimple a queſtion?"</q> But immediately recovering himſelf, whether from unwillingneſs to be deceived, or to appear deceived, or whether from real good humour, he kept up the joke: <q rend="inline">"Nay, but if any body were to anſwer the paragraph, and contradict it, I'd have a reply, and would ſay, that he who contradicted it was no friend either to Veſtris or me. For why ſhould not Dr. Johnſon add to his other powers a little corporeal agility? Socrates learnt to dance at an advanced age, and Cato learnt Greek at an advanced age. Then it might proceed to ſay, that this Johnſon, not content with dancing on the ground, might dance on the rope; and they might introduce the elephant dancing on the rope. A nobleman wrote a play, called 'Love in a hollow Tree.' He found out that it was a bad one, and therefore wiſhed to buy up all the copies, and burn them. The Ducheſs of Marlborough had kept one; and when he was againſt her at an election, ſhe had a new edition of it printed, and prefixed to it, as a frontiſpiece, an elephant dancing on a rope; to ſhew, that his Lordſhip's writing comedy was as aukward as an elephant dancing on a rope."</q>

               <p>On Sunday, April 1, I dined with him at Mr. Thrale's, with Sir Philip Jennings Clerk and Mr. Perkins, who had the ſuperintendence of Mr. Thrale's brewery, with a ſalary of five hundred pounds a year. Sir Philip had the appearance of a gentleman of ancient family, well advanced in life. He wore his own white hair in a bag of goodly ſize, a black velvet coat, with an embroidered waiſtcoat, and very rich laced ruffles; which Mrs. Thrale ſaid were old faſhioned, but which, for that reaſon, I thought the more reſpectable, more like a Tory; yet Sir Philip was then in oppoſition in parliament. <q rend="inline">"Ah, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) ancient ruffles and modern principles do not agree."</q> Sir Philip defended the oppoſition to the American war ably and with temper, and I joined him. He ſaid, the majority of the nation was againſt the miniſtry. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"<hi>I,</hi> Sir, am againſt the miniſtry; but it is for having too little of that of which oppoſition thinks they have too much. Were I miniſter, if any man wagged his finger againſt me, he ſhould be turned out; for that which it is in the power of Government to give at pleaſure to one or to another, ſhould be given to the ſupporters of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. If you will not oppoſe at the expence of loſing your place, your oppoſition will not be honeſt, you will feel no ſerious grievance; and the
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:0548300102:380" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 preſent oppoſition is only a conteſt to get what others have. Sir Robert Walpole acted as I would do. As to the American war, the <hi>ſenſe</hi> of the nation is <hi>with</hi> the miniſtry. The majority of thoſe who can <hi>underſtand</hi> is with it; the majority of thoſe who can only <hi>hear</hi> is againſt it; and as thoſe who can only hear are more numerous than thoſe who can underſtand, and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition is always loudeſt, a majority of the rabble will be for oppoſition."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This boiſterous vivacity entertained us; but the fact really was, that thoſe who could underſtand the beſt were againſt the American war, as almoſt every man now is, when the queſtion has been coolly conſidered.</p>
               <p>Mrs. Thrale gave high praiſe to a gentleman of our acquaintance. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, my dear lady, don't talk ſo. Mr. ****'s character is very <hi>ſhort.</hi> It is nothing. He fills a chair. He is a man of a genteel appearance, and that is all. I know nobody who blaſts by praiſe as you do: for whenever there is exaggerated praiſe, every body is ſet againſt a character. They are provoked to attack it. Now there is *****: you praiſed that man with ſuch diſproportion, that I was incited to leſſen him, perhaps more than he deſerves. His blood is upon your head. By the ſame principle, your malice defeats itſelf; for your cenſure is too violent. And yet (looking to her with a leering ſmile) ſhe is the firſt woman in the world could ſhe but reſtrain that wicked tongue of hers—ſhe would be the only woman could ſhe but command that little whirligig."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the ſubject of exaggerated praiſe I took the liberty to ſay, that I thought there might be very high praiſe given to a known character which deſerved it, and therefore it would not be exaggerated. Thus, one might ſay of Mr. Edmund Burke, He is a very wonderful man. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, you would not be ſafe if another man had a mind perverſely to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict. He might anſwer, Where is all the wonder? Burke is, to be ſure, a man of uncommon abilities, with a great quantity of matter in his mind, and a great fluency of language in his mouth. But we are not be ſtunned and aſtoniſhed by him. So you ſee, Sir, even Burke would ſuffer, not from any fault of his own, but from your folly."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Thrale mentioned a gentleman who had acquired a fortune of four thouſand a year in trade, but was abſolutely miſerable, becauſe he could not talk in company; ſo miſerable, that he was impelled to lament his ſituation in the ſtreet to ******, whom he hates, and who he knows deſpiſes him. <q rend="inline">"I am a moſt unhappy man (ſaid he). I am invited to converſations. I go to converſations; but, alas! I have no converſation."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Man commonly cannot be ſucceſsful in different ways. This gentleman has ſpent,
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:0548300102:381" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in getting four thouſand pounds a year, the time in which he might have  learnt to talk; and now he cannot talk."</q> Mr. Perkins made a ſhrewd and droll remark: <q rend="inline">"If he had got his four thouſand a year as a mountebank, he might have learnt to talk at the ſame time that he was getting his fortune."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Some other gentlemen came in. The converſation concerning the perſon whoſe character Dr. Johnſon had treated ſo ſlightingly, as he did not know his merit, was reſumed. Mrs. Thrale ſaid, <q rend="inline">"You think ſo of him, Sir, becauſe he is quiet, and does not exert himſelf with force. You'll be ſaying the ſame thing of Mr. ***** there, who ſits as quiet—"</q> This was not well bred; and Johnſon did not let it paſs without correction. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Madam, what right have you to talk thus? Both Mr. ***** and I have reaſon to take it ill. <hi>You</hi> may talk ſo of Mr. *****: but why do you make <hi>me</hi> do it. Have I ſaid any thing againſt Mr. *****. You have <hi>ſet</hi> him, that I might ſhoot him: but I have not ſhot him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>One of the gentlemen ſaid, he had ſeen three folio volumes of Dr. Johnſon's ſayings collected by me. <q rend="inline">"I muſt put you right, Sir (ſaid I); for I am very exact in authenticity. You could not ſee folio volumes, for I have none: you might have ſeen ſome in quarto and octavo. This is inattention which one ſhould guard againſt."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is a want of concern about veracity. He does not know that he ſaw <hi>any</hi> volumes. If he had ſeen them he could have remembered their ſize."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Thrale appeared very lethargick to-day. I ſaw him again on Monday evening, at which time he was not thought to be in immediate danger; but early in the morning of Wedneſday the 4th, he expired. Johnſon was in the houſe, and thus mentions the event: <q rend="inline">"I felt almoſt the laſt flutter of his pulſe, and looked for the laſt time upon the face that for fifteen years had never been turned upon me but with reſpect and benignity <note n="8" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 191.</note>."</q> Upon that day there was a <hi>Call</hi> of the LITERARY CLUB; but Johnſon apologiſed for his abſence by the following note:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>

 Mr. Thrale's death was a very eſſential loſs to Johnſon, who, although he did not foreſee all that afterwards happened, was ſufficiently convinced that the comforts which Mr. Thrale's family afforded him would now in a great meaſure ceaſe. He, however, continued to ſhew a kind attention to his widow and children as long as it was acceptable; and he took upon him, with a very earneſt concern, the office of one of his executors, the importance of which ſeemed greater than uſual to him, from his circumſtances having been always ſuch that he had ſcarcely any ſhare in the real buſineſs of life. His friends of the CLUB were in hopes that Mr. Thrale might have made a liberal proviſion for him for his life, which, as Mr. Thrale left no ſon, and a very large fortune, it would have been highly to his honour to have done; and, conſidering Dr. Johnſon's age, could not have been of long duration: but he bequeathed him only two hundred pounds, which was the legacy given to each of his executors. I could not but be ſomewhat diverted by hearing Johnſon talk in a pompous manner of his new office, and particularly of the concerns of the brewery, which it was at laſt reſolved ſhould be ſold. Lord Lucan tells a very good ſtory, which, if not preciſely exact, is certainly characteriſtical: that when the ſale of Thrale's brewery was going forward, Johnſon appeared buſtling about, with an ink-horn and pen in his button-hole, like an exciſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; and on being aſked what he really conſidered to be the value of the property which was to be diſpoſed of, anſwered, <q rend="inline">"We are not here to ſell a parcel of boilers and vats, but the potentiality of growing rich, beyond the dreams of avarice."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Friday, April 6, he carried me to dine at a club, which, at his deſire, had been lately formed at the Queen's Arms, in St. Paul's Church-yard. He told Mr. Hoole, that he wiſhed to have a <hi>City Club,</hi> and aſked him to collect one; but, ſaid he, <q rend="inline">"Don't let them be <hi>patriots.</hi>"</q> The company to-day were very ſenſible well-behaved men. I have preſerved only two particulars of his converſation. He ſaid, he was glad Lord George Gordon had eſcaped, rather than that a precedent ſhould be eſtabliſhed for hanging a man for <hi>conſtructive treaſon;</hi> which, in conſiſtency with his true, manly, conſtitutional Toryiſm, he conſidered would be a dangerous engine of arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power. And upon its being mentioned that an opulent and very indolent Scotch nobleman, who totally reſigned the management of his affairs to a man of knowledge and abilities, had claimed ſome merit by ſaying, <q rend="inline">"The next beſt thing to managing a man's own affairs well, is being ſenſible of incapacity, and not attempting it, but having full confidence in one who can do it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, this is paltry. There is a
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:0548300102:383" rendition="simple:additions"/>
middle courſe. Let a man give application, and depend upon it he will ſoon  get above a deſpicable ſtate of helpleſſneſs, and attain the power of acting for himſelf."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Saturday, April 7, I dined with him at Mr. Hoole's, with Governour Boucher and Captain Orme, both of whom had been long in the Eaſt-Indies; and being men of good ſenſe and obſervation, were very entertaining. Johnſon defended the oriental regulation of different <hi>caſts</hi> of men, which was objected to as totally deſtructive of the hopes of riſing in ſociety by perſonal merit. He ſhewed that there was a <hi>principle</hi> in it ſufficiently plauſible by analogy. <q rend="inline">"We ſee (ſaid he) in metals that there are different ſpecies; and ſo likewiſe in animals, though one ſpecies may not differ very widely from another, as in the ſpecies of dogs—the cur, the ſpaniel, the maſtiff. The Bramins are the maſtiffs of mankind."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Thurſday, April 12, I dined with him at a Biſhop's, where were Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Mr. Berrenger, and ſome more company. He had dined the day before at another Biſhop's. I have unfortunately recorded none of his converſation at the Biſhop's where we dined together: but I have preſerved his ingenious defence of his dining twice abroad in Paſſion-week; a laxity, in which I am convinced he would not have indulged himſelf at the time when he wrote his ſolemn paper in <q rend="inline">"The Rambler,"</q> upon that aweful ſeaſon. It appeared to me, that by being much more in company, and enjoying more in luxurious living, he had contracted a keener reliſh of pleaſure, and was conſequently leſs rigorous in his religious rites. This he would not acknowledge; but he reaſoned, with admirable ſophiſtry, as follows: <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, a Biſhop's calling company together in this week, is, to uſe the vulgar phraſe, not <hi>the thing.</hi> But you muſt conſider laxity is a bad thing; but preciſeneſs is alſo a bad thing; and your general character may be more hurt by preciſeneſs than by dining with a Biſhop in Paſſion-week. There might be a handle for reflection. It might be ſaid, 'He refuſed to dine with a Biſhop in Paſſion-week, but was three Sundays abſent from church."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Very true, Sir. But ſuppoſe a man to be uniformly of good conduct, would it not be better that he ſhould refuſe to dine with a Biſhop in this week, and ſo not encourage a bad practice by his example?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, you are to conſider whether you might not do more harm by leſſening the influence of a Biſhop's character by your diſapprobation in refuſing him, than by going to him."</q>

               <p>On Friday, April 13, being Good-Friday, I went to St. Clement's-church with him, as uſual. There I ſaw again his old fellow-collegian, Edwards, to whom I ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I think Sir, Dr. Johnſon and you meet only at church."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Sir (ſaid he) it is the beſt place we can meet in except Heaven, and I hope we ſhall meet there too."</q> Dr. Johnſon told me that there was very little com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication between Edwards and him, after their unexpected renewal of acquaintance. <q rend="inline">"But (ſaid he, ſmiling) he met me once, and ſaid, 'I am told you have written a very pretty book called <hi>The Rambler.'</hi> I was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing that he ſhould leave the world in total darkneſs, and ſent him a ſet."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Berrenger viſited him to-day, and was very pleaſing. We talked of an evening ſociety for converſation at a houſe in town, of which we were all members, but of which Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It will never do, Sir. There is nothing ſerved about there, neither tea, nor coffee, nor lemonade, nor any
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:0548300102:385" rendition="simple:additions"/>
thing whatever; and depend upon it, Sir, a man does not love to go to a  place from whence he comes out exactly as he went in.</q> I endeavoured for argument's ſake, to maintain that men of learning and talents might have very good intellectual ſociety, without the aid of any little gratifications of the ſenſes. Berrenger joined with Johnſon, and ſaid that without theſe any meeting would be dull and inſipid. He would therefore have all the ſlight refreſhments; nay, it would not be amiſs to have ſome cold meat, and a bottle of wine upon a ſide-board. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid Johnſon to me, with an air of triumph,) Mr. Berrenger knows the world. Every body loves to have good things furniſhed to them without any trouble. I told Mrs. Thrale once, that as ſhe did not chooſe to have card-tables, ſhe ſhould have a profuſion of the beſt ſweetmeats, and ſhe would be ſure to have company enough come to her."</q> The event proved the juſtice of Johnſon's opinion, as to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicability of getting people to meet, when they know there is abſolutely nothing to touch the palate; for this Society, though held at the houſe of a perſon deſervedly much eſteemed, and compoſed of very eminent men, could not be preſerved from gradual decay.</p>
               <p>On Sunday, April 15, being Eaſter-day, after ſolemn worſhip in St. Paul's church, I found him alone; Dr. Scott, of the Commons, came. He talked of its having been ſaid, that Addiſon wrote ſome of his beſt papers in <q rend="inline">"The Spectator,"</q> when warm with wine. Dr. Johnſon did not ſeem willing to admit this. Dr. Scott, as a confirmation of it related, that Blackſtone compoſed his <q rend="inline">"Commentaries"</q> with a bottle of port before him.</p>
               <p>I told him, that in a company where I had lately been, a deſire was expreſſed to know his authority for the ſhocking ſtory of Addiſon's ſending an execution into Steele's houſe. <q rend="inline">"Sir (ſaid he) it is generally known, it is known to all who are acquainted with the literary hiſtory of that period. It is as well known, as that he wrote 'Cato."</q> Mr. Thomas Sheridan once defended Addiſon to me, by alledging that he did it in order to cover Steele's goods from other creditors, who were going to ſeize them.</p>
               <p>We talked of the difference between the mode of education at Oxford, and that in the Colleges, where inſtruction is chiefly conveyed by lectures. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Lectures were once uſeful; but now, when all can read, and books are ſo numerous, lectures are unneceſſary. If your attention fails, and you miſs a part of a lecture, it is loſt, you cannot go back as you do upon a book."</q> Dr. Scott agreed with him. <q rend="inline">"But yet (ſaid I) Dr. Scott, you yourſelf gave lectures at Oxford."</q> He ſmiled. <q rend="inline">"You laughed then (ſaid I) at thoſe who came to you."</q>
               </p>

                  <pb n="384" facs="tcp:0548300102:386" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Dr. Scott left us, and ſoon afterwards we went to dinner. Our company conſiſted of Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Deſmoulins, Mr. Levett, Mr. Allen, the printer, and Mrs. Hall, ſiſter of the Reverend Mr. John Weſley, and reſembling him, as I thought, both in figure and manner. Johnſon produced now, for the firſt time, ſome handſome ſilver ſalvers, which he told me he had bought fourteen years ago; ſo it was a great day. I was not a little amuſed by obſerving Allen perpetually ſtruggling to talk in the manner of Johnſon, like the little frog in the fable, blowing himſelf up to reſemble the ſtately ox.</p>
               <p>I mentioned a kind of religious Robinhood Society, which met every Sunday evening, at Coachmakers'-hall, for free debate; and that the ſubject for this night was, the text which relates, with other miracles, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at our SAVIOUR'S death, <q rend="inline">"And the graves were opened, and many bodies of the ſaints which ſlept aroſe, and came out of the graves after his reſurrection, and went into the holy city, and appeared unto many."</q> Mrs. Hall ſaid it was a very curious ſubject, and ſhe ſhould like to hear it diſcuſſed. JOHNSON. (ſomewhat warmly) <q rend="inline">"One would not go to ſuch a place to hear it—one would not be ſeen in ſuch a place—to give coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to ſuch a meeting."</q> I, however, reſolved that I would go. <q rend="inline">"But Sir, (ſaid ſhe to Johnſon,) I ſhould like to hear <hi>you</hi> diſcuſs it."</q> He ſeemed reluctant to engage in it. She talked of the reſurrection of the human race in general, and maintained that we ſhall be raiſed with the ſame bodies. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Madam, we ſee that it is not to be the ſame body; for the Scripture uſes the illuſtration of grain ſown, and we know that the grain which grows is not the ſame with what is ſown. You cannot ſuppoſe that we ſhall riſe with a diſeaſed body; it is enough if there be ſuch a ſameneſs as to diſtinguiſh identity of perſon."</q> She ſeemed deſirous of knowing more, but he left the queſtion in obſcurity.</p>
               <p>Of apparitions, he obſerved, <q rend="inline">"A total diſbelief of them is adverſe to the opinion of the exiſtence of the ſoul between death and the laſt day; the queſtion ſimply is, whether departed ſpirits ever have the power of making themſelves perceptible to us; a man who thinks he has ſeen an apparition, can only be convinced himſelf; his authority will not convince another, and his conviction, if rational, muſt be founded on being told ſomething which cannot be known but by ſupernatural means."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He mentioned a thing as not unfrequent, of which I had never heard before—being <hi>called,</hi> that is, hearing one's name pronounced by the voice of a known perſon at a great diſtance, far beyond the poſſibility of being reached
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:0548300102:387" rendition="simple:additions"/>
by any ſound, uttered by human organs. <q rend="inline">"An acquaintance, on whoſe  veracity I can depend, told me, that walking home one evening to Kilmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nock, he heard himſelf called from a wood, by the voice of a brother who had gone to America; and the next packet brought accounts of that brother's death."</q> Macbean aſſerted that this inexplicable <hi>calling</hi> was a thing very well known. Dr. Johnſon ſaid, that one day at Oxford, as he was turning the key of his chamber, he heard his mother diſtinctly call <hi>Sam.</hi> She was then at Lichfield; but nothing enſued. This phaenomenon is, I think, as wonderful as any other myſterious fact, which many people are very ſlow to believe, or rather, indeed, reject with an obſtinate contempt.</p>
               <p>Some time after this, upon his making a remark which eſcaped my attention, Mrs. Williams and Mrs. Hall were both together ſtriving to anſwer him. He grew angry, and called out loudly, <q rend="inline">"Nay, when you both ſpeak at once it is intolerable."</q> But checking himſelf, and ſoftening, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"This one may ſay, though you <hi>are</hi> ladies."</q> Then he brightened into gay humour, and addreſſed them in the words of one of the ſongs in <q rend="inline">"The Beggar's Opera,"</q>
                  <q>
                     <l>"But two at a time there's no mortal can bear."</l>
                  </q>
                  <q rend="inline">"What, Sir, (ſaid I,) are you going to turn Captain Macheath?"</q> There was ſomething as pleaſantly ludicrous in this ſcene as can be imagined. The contraſt between Macheath, Polly, and Lucy—and Dr. Samuel Johnſon, blind, peeviſh Mrs. Williams, and lean, lank, preaching Mrs. Hall, was exquiſite.</p>
               <p>I ſtole away to Coachmaker's-hall, and heard the difficult text of which we had talked, diſcuſſed with great decency, and ſome intelligence, by ſeveral ſpeakers. There was a difference of opinion as to the appearance of ghoſts in modern times, though the arguments for it, ſupported by Mr. Addiſon's authority, preponderated. The immediate ſubject of debate was embarraſſed by the <hi>bodies</hi> of the ſaints having been ſaid to riſe, and by the queſtion what became of them afterwards; did they return again to their graves? Or were they tranſlated to Heaven? Only one evangeliſt mentions the fact <note n="9" place="bottom">St. Matthew, chap. xxvii. v. 52, 53.</note>, and the commentators whom I have looked at, do not make the paſſage clear. There is, however, no occaſion for our underſtanding it farther, than to know that it was one of the extraordinary manifeſtations of divine power, which accompanied the moſt important event that ever happened.</p>

 On Friday, April 20, I ſpent with him one of the happieſt days that I remember to have enjoyed in the whole courſe of my life. Mrs. Garrick, whoſe grief for the loſs of her huſband was, I believe, as ſincere as wounded affection and admiration could produce, had this day, for the firſt time ſince his death, a ſelect party of his friends to dine with her. The company was Miſs Hannah More, who lived with her, and whom ſhe called her Chaplain; Mrs. Boſcawen, Mrs. Elizabeth Carter, Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Dr. Burney, Dr. Johnſon, and myſelf. We found ourſelves very elegantly entertained at her houſe in the Adelphi, where I have paſſed many a pleaſing hour with him <q rend="inline">"who gladdened life."</q> She looked very well, talked of her huſband with complacency, and while ſhe caſt her eyes on his portrait, which hung over the chimney-piece, ſaid, that <q rend="inline">"death was now the moſt agreeable object to her."</q> The very ſemblance of David Garrick was cheering. Mr. Beauclerk, with happy propriety, inſcribed under that fine portrait of him, which by Lady Diana's kindneſs is now the property of my friend Mr. Langton, the following paſſage from his beloved Shakſpeare:</p>

                     <l>"—A merrier man,</l>
                     <l>"Within the limit of becoming mirth,</l>
                     <l>"I never ſpent an hour's talk withal.</l>
                     <l>"His eye begets occaſion for his wit;</l>
                     <l>"For ev'ry object that the one doth catch,</l>
                     <l>"The other turns to a mirth-moving jeſt;</l>
                     <l>"Which his fair tongue (Conceit's expoſitor)</l>
                     <l>"Delivers in ſuch apt and gracious words,</l>
                     <l>"That aged ears play truant at his tales,</l>
                     <l>"And younger hearings are quite raviſhed;</l>
                     <l>"So ſweet and voluble is his diſcourſe."</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>We were all in fine ſpirits; and I whiſpered to Mrs. Boſcawen, <q rend="inline">"I believe this is as much as can be made of life."</q> In addition to a ſplendid enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, we were regaled with Lichfield ale, which had a peculiar appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priated value. Sir Joſhua, and Dr. Burney, and I, drank cordially of it to Dr. Johnſon's health; and though he would not join us, he as cordially anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Gentlemen, I wiſh you all as well as you do me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The general effect of this day dwells upon my mind in fond remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; but I do not find much converſation recorded. What I have preſerved ſhall be faithfully given.</p>

Somebody mentioned Mr. Thomas Hollis, the ſtrenuous Whig, who uſed  to ſend over Europe preſents of democratical books, with their boards ſtamped with daggers and caps of liberty. Mrs. Carter ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He was a bad man. He uſed to talk uncharitably."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Poh! poh! Madam; who is the worſe for being talked of uncharitably? Beſides, he was a dull poor creature as ever lived. And I believe he would not have done harm to a man whom he knew to be of very oppoſite principles to his own. I remember once at the Society of Arts, when an advertiſement was to be drawn up, he pointed me out as the man who could do it beſt. This, you will obſerve was kindneſs to me. I however ſlipt away and eſcaped it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Carter having ſaid of a certain perſon, <q rend="inline">"I doubt he was an Atheiſt."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I don't know that. He might perhaps have become one, if he had had time to ripen, (ſmiling). He might have <hi>exuberated</hi> into an Atheiſt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Sir Joſhua Reynolds praiſed <q rend="inline">"Mudge's Sermons."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Mudge's Sermons' are good, but not practical. He graſps more ſenſe than he can hold; he takes more corn than he can make into meal; he opens a wide proſpect, but it is ſo diſtant, it is indiſtinct. I love 'Blair's Sermons.' Though the dog is a Scotchman, and a Preſbyterian, and every thing he ſhould not be, I was the firſt to praiſe them. Such was my candour."</q> (ſmiling). MRS. BOSCAWEN. <q rend="inline">"Such his great merit to get the better of all your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Madam, let us compound the matter; let us aſcribe it to my candour, and his merit."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the evening we had a large company in the drawing-room, ſeveral ladies, the Biſhop of Killaloe, D. Percy, Mr. Chamberlayne, of the Treaſury, &amp;c. &amp;c. Somebody ſaid the life of a mere literary man could not be very entertaining. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But it certainly may. This is a remark which has been made, and repeated, without juſtice; why ſhould the life of a literary man be leſs entertaining than the life of any other man? Are there not as intereſting varieties in ſuch a life? As a <hi>literary life</hi> it may be very entertaining."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But it muſt be better ſurely, when it is diverſified with a little active variety—ſuch as his having gone to Jamaica;—or—his having gone to the Hebrides."</q> Johnſon was not diſpleaſed at this.</p>
               <p>Talking of a very reſpectable authour, he told us a curious circumſtance in his life, which was, that he had married a printer's devil. REYNOLDS. <q rend="inline">"A printer's devil, Sir! Why, I thought a printer's devil was a creature with a black face and in rags."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir. But I ſuppoſe, he had her face waſhed, and put clean clothes on her. (Then looking very
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:0548300102:390" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 ſerious, and very earneſt) And ſhe did not diſgrace him—the woman had a bottom of good ſenſe."</q> The word <hi>bottom</hi> thus introduced, was ſo ludicrous, when contraſted with his gravity, that moſt of us could not forbear tittering and laughing, though I recollect that the Biſhop of Killaloe kept his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance with perfect ſteadineſs, while Miſs Hannah More ſlyly hid her face behind a lady's back who ſate on the ſame ſettee with her. His pride could not bear that any expreſſion of his ſhould excite ridicule, when he did not intend it; he therefore reſolved to aſſume and exerciſe deſpotick power, glanced ſternly around, and called out in a ſtrong tone, <q rend="inline">"Where's the merriment?"</q> Then collecting himſelf, and looking aweful, to make us feel how he could impoſe reſtraint, and as it were ſearching his mind for a ſtill more ludicrous word, he ſlowly pronounced, <q rend="inline">"I ſay the <hi>woman</hi> was <hi>fundamentally</hi> ſenſible;"</q> as if he had ſaid, hear this now, and laugh if you dare. We all ſat compoſed as at a funeral.</p>
               <p>He and I walked away together; we ſtopped a little while by the rails of the Adelphi, looking on the Thames, and I ſaid to him with tenderneſs, that I thought of two friends we had loſt, who once lived in the buildings behind us, Beauclerk and Garrick. <q rend="inline">"Aye, Sir, (ſaid he, tenderly,) and two ſuch friends as cannot be ſupplied."</q>
               </p>
               <p>For ſome time after this day I did not ſee him very often, and of the converſation which I did enjoy, I am ſorry to find I have preſerved but little. I was at this time engaged in a variety of other matters, which required exertion and aſſiduity, and neceſſarily occupied almoſt all my time.</p>
               <p>One day having ſpoken very freely of thoſe who were then in power, he ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"Between ourſelves, Sir, I do not like to give oppoſition the ſatisfaction of knowing how much I diſapprove of the miniſtry."</q> And when I mentioned that Mr. Burke had boaſted how quiet the nation was in George the Second's reign, when Whigs were in power, compared with the preſent reign, when Tories governed. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, (ſaid he,) you are to conſider that Tories having more reverence for government, will not oppoſe with the ſame violence as Whigs, who being unreſtrained by that principle, will oppoſe by any means."</q>
               </p>
               <p>This month he loſt not only Mr. Thrale, but another friend, Mr. William Strahan, Junior, printer, the eldeſt ſon of his old and conſtant friend, Printer to his Majeſty.</p>

               <p>On Tueſday, May 8, I had the pleaſure of again dining with him and Mr. Wilkes, at Mr. Dilly's. No <hi>negotiation</hi> was now required to bring them together; for Johnſon was ſo well ſatisfied with the former interview, that he was very glad to meet Wilkes again, who was this day ſeated between Dr. Beattie and Dr. Johnſon; (between Truth and Reaſon, as General Paoli ſaid, when I told him of it). WILKES. <q rend="inline">"I have been thinking, Dr. Johnſon, that there ſhould be a bill brought into parliament that the controverted elections for Scotland ſhould be tried in that country, at their own Abbey of Holy-Rood Houſe, and not here; for the conſequence of trying them here is, that we have an inundation of Scotchmen, who come up and never go back again. Now here is Boſwell, who has come up upon the election for his own county, which will not laſt a fortnight."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, I ſee no reaſon why they ſhould be tried at all; for, you know, one Scotchman is as good as another."</q> WILKES. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Boſwell, how much may be got in a year by an Advocate at the Scotch bar?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I believe two thouſand pounds."</q> WILKES. <q rend="inline">"How can it be poſſible to ſpend that money in Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, the money may be ſpent in England: but there is a harder queſtion. If one man in Scotland gets poſſeſſion of two thouſand pounds, what remains for all the reſt of the nation?"</q> WILKES. <q rend="inline">"You know, in the laſt war, the immenſe booty which Thurot carried off
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:0548300102:392" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 from the complete plunder of ſeven Scotch iſles. He re-imbarked with <hi>three and ſix-pence.</hi>"</q> Here again Johnſon and Wilkes joined in extravagant ſportive raillery upon the ſuppoſed poverty of Scotland, which Dr. Beattie and I did not think it worth our while to diſpute.</p>
               <p>The ſubject of quotation being introduced, Mr. Wilkes cenſured it as pedantry. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, it is a good thing; there is a community of mind in it. Claſſical quotation is the <hi>parole</hi> of literary men all over the world."</q> WILKES. <q rend="inline">"Upon the continent they all quote the vulgate Bible. Shakſpeare is chiefly quoted here; and we quote alſo Pope, Prior, Butler, Waller, and ſometimes Cowley."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of Letter-writing. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is now become ſo much the faſhion to publiſh letters, that in order to avoid it, I put as little into mine as I can."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Do what you will, Sir, you cannot avoid it. Should you even write as ill as you can, your letters would be publiſhed as curioſities.

               <p>He gave us an entertaining account of <hi>Bet Flint,</hi> a woman of the town, who, with ſome eccentrick talents and much effrontery, forced herſelf upon his acquaintance. <q rend="inline">"Bet (ſaid he) wrote her own Life in verſe <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <p>Johnſon, whoſe memory was wonderfully retentive, remembered the firſt four lines of this curious production, which have been communicated to me by a young lady of his acquaintance:</p>
                        <q>
                           <lg>
                              <l>"When firſt I drew my vital breath,</l>
                              <l>"A little minikin I came upon earth;</l>
                              <l>"And then I came from a dark abode,</l>
                              <l>"Into this gay and gaudy world."</l>
                           </lg>
                        </q>
                     </note>, which ſhe brought to me, wiſhing that I would furniſh her with a Preface to it (laughing). I uſed to ſay of her, that ſhe was generally ſlut and drunkard—occaſionally, whore and thief. She had, however, genteel lodgings, a ſpinnet on which ſhe played, and a boy that walked before her chair. Poor Bet was taken up on a charge of ſtealing a counterpane, and tried at the Old-Bailey. Chief Juſtice—, who loved a wench, ſummed up favourably, and ſhe was acquitted. After which, Bet ſaid, with a gay and ſatisfied air, 'Now that the counterpane is <hi>my own,</hi> I ſhall make a petticoat of it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of oratory, Mr. Wilkes deſcribed it as accompanied with all the charms of poetical expreſſion. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; oratory is the power
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:0548300102:393" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of beating down your adverſary's arguments, and putting better in their  place."</q> WILKES. <q rend="inline">"But this does not move the paſſions."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He muſt be a weak man who is to be ſo moved."</q> WILKES. (naming a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated orator) <q rend="inline">"Amidſt all the brilliancy of—'s imagination, and the exuberance of his wit, there is a ſtrange want of <hi>taſte.</hi> It was obſerved of Apelles's Venus, that her fleſh ſeemed as if ſhe had been nouriſhed by roſes: his oratory would ſometimes make one ſuſpect that he eats potatoes and drinks whiſky."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Wilkes obſerved, how tenacious we are of forms in this country, and gave us an inſtance, the vote of the Houſe of Commons for remitting money to pay the army in America <hi>in Portugal pieces,</hi> when, in reality, the remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is made not in Portugal money but in our own ſpecie. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Is there not a law, Sir, againſt exporting the current coin of the realm?"</q> WILKES. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir: but might not the Houſe of Commons, in caſe of real evident neceſſity, order our own current coin to be ſent into our own colonies?"</q>—Here Johnſon, with that quickneſs of recollection which diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed him ſo eminently, gave the <hi>Middleſex Patriot</hi> an admirable retort upon his own ground. <q rend="inline">"Sure, Sir, <hi>you</hi> don't think a <hi>reſolution of the Houſe of Commons</hi> equal to <hi>the law of the land.</hi>"</q> WILKES. (at once perceiving the application) <q rend="inline">"GOD forbid, Sir."</q>—To hear what had been treated with ſuch violence in <q rend="inline">"The Falſe Alarm,"</q> now turned into pleaſant repartee, was extremely agreeable. Johnſon went on—<q rend="inline">"Locke obſerves well, that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition to export the current coin is impolitick; for when the balance of trade happens to be againſt a ſtate, the current coin <hi>muſt</hi> be exported."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Beauclerk's great library was this ſeaſon ſold in London by auction. Mr. Wilkes ſaid, he wondered to find in it ſuch a numerous collection of ſermons, ſeeming to think it ſtrange that a gentleman of Mr. Beauclerk's character in the gay world, ſhould have choſen to have many compoſitions of that kind. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, you are to conſider, that ſermons make a conſiderable branch of Engliſh literature; ſo that a library muſt be very imperfect if it has not a numerous collection of ſermons <note n="2" place="bottom">
                        <p>Mr. Wilkes probably did not know that there is in an Engliſh ſermon the moſt comprehenſive and lively account of that entertaining faculty, for which he himſelf is ſo much admired. It is in Dr. Barrow's firſt volume, and fourteenth ſermon, <q rend="inline">"Againſt fooliſh Talking and Jeſting."</q> My old acquaintance, the late Corbyn Morris, in his ingenious <q rend="inline">"Eſſay on Wit, Humour, and Ridicule,"</q> calls it <q rend="inline">"a <hi>profuſe</hi> deſcription of Wit:"</q> but I do not ſee how it could be curtailed, without leaving out ſome good circumſtance of diſcrimination. As it is not generally known, and may perhaps diſpoſe ſome to read ſermons, from which they may receive real advantage, while looking only for entertainment, I ſhall here quote it.</p>
                        <p>
                           <q rend="inline">"But firſt (ſays the learned preacher) it may be demanded, what the thing we ſpeak of is? Or what this facetiouſneſs (or <hi>wit,</hi> as he calls it before,) doth import? To which queſtions I might reply, as Democritus did to him that aſked the definition of a man, "Tis that which we all ſee and know.' Any one better apprehends what it is by acquaintance, than I can inform him by deſcription. It is, indeed, a thing ſo verſatile and multiform, appearing in ſo many ſhapes, ſo many poſtures, ſo many garbs, ſo variouſly apprehended by ſeveral eyes and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that it ſeemeth no leſs hard to ſettle a clear and certain notion thereof, than to make a portrait of Proteus, or to define the figure of the fleeting air. Sometimes it lieth in pat alluſion to a known ſtory, or in ſeaſonable application of a trivial ſaying, or in forging an appoſite tale: ſometimes it playeth in words and phraſes, taking advantage from the ambiguity of their ſenſe, or the affinity of their ſound: ſometimes it is wrapped in a dreſs of humourous expreſſion: ſometimes it lurketh under an odd ſimilitude: ſometimes it is lodged in a ſly queſtion, in a ſmart anſwer, in a quirkiſh reaſon, in a ſhrewd intimation, in cunningly diverting or cleverly retorting an objection: ſometimes it is couched in a bold ſcheme of ſpeech, in a tart irony, in a luſty hyperbole, in a ſtartling metaphor, in a plauſible reconciling of contradictions, or in acute nonſenſe: ſometimes a ſcenical repreſentation of perſons or things, a counterfeit ſpeech, a mimical look or geſture, paſſeth for it: ſometimes an affected ſimplicity, ſometimes a preſumptuous bluntneſs giveth it being: ſometimes it riſeth only from a lucky hitting upon what is ſtrange, ſometimes from a crafty wreſting obvious matter to the purpoſe. Often it conſiſteth in one knows not what, and ſpringeth up one can hardly tell how. Its ways are unaccountable, and inexplicable; being anſwerable to the numberleſs rovings of fancy, and windings of language. It is, in ſhort, a manner of ſpeaking out of the ſimple and plain way, (ſuch as reaſon teacheth and proveth things by,) which by a pretty ſurprizing uncouthneſs in conceit or expreſſion, doth affect and amuſe the fancy, ſtirring in it ſome wonder, and breeding ſome delight thereto. It raiſeth admiration, as ſignifying a nimble ſagacity of apprehenſion, a ſpecial felicity of invention, a vivacity of ſpirit, and reach of wit more than vulgar; it ſeeming to argue a rare quickneſs of parts, that one can fetch in remote conceits applicable; a notable ſkill, that he can dextrouſly accommodate them to the purpoſe before him; together with a lively briſkneſs of humour, not apt to damp thoſe ſportful flaſhes of imagination. (Whence in Ariſtotle ſuch perſons are termed <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>Mr. Wilkes ſaid to me, loud enough for Dr. Johnſon to hear, <q rend="inline">"Dr. Johnſon ſhould make me a preſent of his 'Lives of the Poets,' as I am a poor patriot who cannot afford to buy them."</q> Johnſon ſeemed to take no notice of this hint; but in a little while, he called to Mr. Dilly, <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, be ſo good as to ſend a ſet of my Lives to Mr. Wilkes, with my compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments."</q> This was accordingly done; and Mr. Wilkes paid Dr. Johnſon a viſit, was courteouſly received, and ſate with him a long time.</p>
               <p>The company gradually dropped away. Mr. Dilly himſelf was called down ſtairs upon buſineſs; I left the room for ſome time; when I returned, I was ſtruck with obſerving Dr. Samuel Johnſon and John Wilkes, Eſq. literally <hi>tête à tête;</hi> for they were reclined upon their chairs, with their heads leaning almoſt cloſe to each other, and talking earneſtly, in a kind of confidential whiſper, of the perſonal quarrel between George the Second and the King of Pruſſia. Such a ſcene of perfectly eaſy ſociality between two ſuch opponents in the war of political controverſy, as that which I now beheld, would have been an excellent ſubject for a picture. It preſented to my mind the happy days which are foretold in Scripture, when the lion ſhall lye down with the kid <note n="3" place="bottom">When I mentioned this to the Biſhop of Killaloe, <q rend="inline">"With the <hi>goat,</hi>"</q> ſaid his Lordſhip. Such, however, is the engaging politeneſs and pleaſantry of Mr. Wilkes, and ſuch the ſocial good humour of the Biſhop, that when they dined together at Mr. Dilly's, where I alſo was, they were mutually agreeable.</note>.</p>
               <p>After this day there was another pretty long interval, during which Dr. Johnſon and I did not meet. When I mentioned it to him with regret, he was pleaſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, let us live double."</q>
               </p>
               <p>About this time it was much the faſhion for ſeveral ladies to have evening aſſemblies, where the fair ſex might participate in converſation with literary and ingenious men, animated by a deſire to pleaſe. Theſe ſocieties were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominated <hi>Blue-ſtocking Clubs,</hi> the origin of which title being little known, it may be worth while to relate it. One of the moſt eminent members of thoſe ſocieties, when they firſt commenced, was Mr. Stillingfleet, whoſe dreſs was remarkably grave, and in particular it was obſerved, that he wore blue-ſtockings. Such was the excellence of his converſation, that his abſence was felt as ſo great a loſs, that it uſed to be ſaid, <q rend="inline">"We can do nothing without the <hi>blue-ſtockings;</hi>
                  </q> and thus by degrees the title was eſtabliſhed. Miſs Hannah More has admirably deſcribed a <hi>Blue-ſtocking Club,</hi> in her <q rend="inline">"Bas Bleu,"</q> a
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:0548300102:396"/>
 poem in which many of the perſons who were moſt conſpicuous there are mentioned.</p>
               <p>Johnſon was prevailed with to come ſometimes into theſe circles, and did not think himſelf too grave even for the lively Miſs Monckton (now Counteſs of Corke) who uſed to have the fineſt <hi>bit of blue</hi> at the houſe of her mother, Lady Galway. Her vivacity enchanted the Sage, and they uſed to talk together with all imaginable eaſe. A ſingular inſtance happened one evening, when ſhe inſiſted that ſome of Sterne's writings were very pathetick. Johnſon bluntly denied it. <q rend="inline">"I am ſure (ſaid ſhe) they have affected <hi>me.</hi>"</q>—<q rend="inline">"Why (ſaid Johnſon, ſmiling, and rolling himſelf about) that is, becauſe, deareſt, you're a dunce."</q> When ſhe ſome time afterwards mentioned this to him, he ſaid with equal truth and politeneſs; <q rend="inline">"Madam, if I had thought ſo, I cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſhould not have ſaid it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another evening Johnſon's kind indulgence towards me had a pretty difficult trial. I had dined at the Duke of Montroſe's, with a very agreeable party, and his Grace, according to his uſual cuſtom, had circulated the bottle very freely. Lord Graham and I went together to Miſs Monckton's, where I certainly was in extraordinary ſpirits, and above all fear or awe. In the midſt of a great number of perſons of the firſt rank, amongſt whom I recollect with confuſion, a noble lady of the moſt ſtately decorum; I placed myſelf next to Johnſon, and thinking myſelf now fully his match, talked to him in a loud and boiſterous manner, deſirous to let the company know how I could contend with <hi>Ajax.</hi> I particularly remember preſſing him upon the value of the pleaſures of the imagination, and as an illuſtration of my argument, aſking him, <q rend="inline">"What, Sir, ſuppoſing I were to fancy that the (naming the moſt charming Ducheſs in his Majeſty's dominions) were in love with me, ſhould I not be very happy?"</q> My friend with much addreſs evaded my interrogatories, and kept me as quiet as poſſible; but it may eaſily be conceived how he muſt have felt <note n="4" place="bottom">
                     <p>Next day I endeavoured to give what had happened the moſt ingenious turn I could, by the following verſes:</p>

<pb n="395" facs="tcp:0548300102:397" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <hi>I</hi> waited upon him and made an apology, he behaved with the moſt friendly  gentleneſs.</p>
               <p>While I remained in London this year, Johnſon and I dined together at ſeveral places. I recollect a placid day at Dr. Butters's, who was now removed from Derby to Lower Groſvenor-ſtreet, London; but of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation on that and other occaſions during this period, I neglected to keep any regular record, and ſhall therefore inſert here ſome miſcellaneous articles which I find in my Johnſonian notes.</p>
               <p>His diſorderly habits, when <q rend="inline">"making proviſion for the day that was paſſing over him,"</q> appear from the following anecdote, communicated to me by Mr. John Nichols:—<q rend="inline">"In the year 1763, a young bookſeller, who was an apprentice to Mr. Whiſton, waited on him with a ſubſcription to his 'Shakſpeare;' and obſerving that the Doctor made no entry in any book of the ſubſcriber's name, ventured diffidently to aſk, whether he would pleaſe to have the gentleman's addreſs, that it might be properly inſerted in the printed liſt of ſubſcribers.—<hi>'I ſhall print no Liſt of Subſcribers;'</hi> ſaid Johnſon, with great abruptneſs: but almoſt immediately recollecting himſelf, added, very complacently, 'Sir, I have two very cogent reaſons for not printing any liſt of ſubſcribers—one, that I have loſt all the names—the other, that I have ſpent all the money."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="396" facs="tcp:0548300102:398" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Johnſon could not brook appearing to be worſted in argument, even when he had taken the wrong ſide, to ſhew the force and dexterity of his talents. When, therefore, he perceived that his opponent gained ground, he had recourſe to ſome ſudden mode of robuſt ſophiſtry. Once when I was preſſing upon him with viſible advantage, he ſtopped me thus:—<q rend="inline">"My dear Boſwell, let's have no more of this; you'll make nothing of it. I'd rather have you whiſtle a Scotch tune."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Care, however, muſt be taken to diſtinguiſh between Johnſon when he <q rend="inline">"talked for victory,"</q> and Johnſon when he had no deſire but to inform and illuſtrate.—<q rend="inline">"One of Johnſon's principal talents (ſays an eminent friend) was ſhewn in maintaining the wrong ſide of an argument, and in a ſplendid per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of the truth.—If you could contrive to have his fair opinion on a ſubject, and without any bias from perſonal prejudice, or from a wiſh to be victorious in argument, it was wiſdom itſelf, not only convincing, but overpowering."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He had, however, all his life habituated himſelf to conſider converſation as a trial of intellectual vigour and ſkill; and to this, I think, we may venture to aſcribe that unexampled richneſs and brilliancy which appeared in his own. As a proof at once of his eagerneſs for colloquial diſtinction, and his high notion of this eminent friend, he once addreſſed him thus: <q rend="inline">"—, we now have been ſeveral hours together; and you have ſaid but one thing for which I envied you."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He diſliked much all ſpeculative deſponding conſiderations, which tended to diſcourage men from diligence and exertion. He was in this like Dr. Shaw, the great traveller, who, Mr. Daines Barrington told me, uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"I hate a <hi>cui bono</hi> man."</q> Upon being aſked by a friend what he ſhould think of one who was apt to ſay, <hi>non eſt tanti;</hi>—<q rend="inline">"That he's a ſtupid fellow, Sir. (anſwered Johnſon) What would theſe <hi>tanti</hi> men be doing the while?"</q> When I, in a low-ſpirited fit, was talking to him with indifference of the purſuits which generally engage us in a courſe of action, and inquiring a <hi>reaſon</hi> for taking ſo much trouble; <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he, in an animated tone,) it is driving on the ſyſtem of life."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He told me, that he was glad that I had, by General Oglethorpe's means, become acquainted with Dr. Shebbeare. Indeed that gentleman, whatever objections were made to him, had knowledge and abilities much above the claſs of ordinary writers, and deſerves to be remembered as a reſpectable name in literature, were it only for his admirable <q rend="inline">"Letters on the Engliſh Nation,"</q> under the name of <q rend="inline">"Battiſta Angeloni, a Jeſuit."</q>

               <p>
                  <pb n="397" facs="tcp:0548300102:399"/>
Johnſon and Shebbeare <note n="5" place="bottom">I recollect a ludicrous paragraph in the news-papers, that the King had penſioned both a <hi>He</hi>-bear and a <hi>She</hi>-bear.</note>, were frequently named together, as having in  former reigns had no predilection for the family of Hanover. The authour of the celebrated <q rend="inline">"Heroick Epiſtle to Sir William Chambers,"</q> introduces them in one line, in a liſt of thoſe who <q rend="inline">"taſted the ſweets of his preſent Majeſty's reign."</q> Such was Johnſon's fair taſte of the merit of that ſatire, that he allowed Dr. Goldſmith, as he told me, to read it to him from beginning to end, and did not refuſe his praiſe to its execution.</p>
               <p>Goldſmith could ſometimes take adventurous liberties with him, and eſcape unpuniſhed. Beauclerk told me that when Goldſmith talked of a project for having a third Theatre in London, ſolely for the exhibition of new plays, in order to deliver authours from the ſuppoſed tyranny of managers, Johnſon treated it ſlightingly; upon which Goldſmith ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Aye, aye, this may be nothing to you, who can now ſhelter yourſelf behind the corner of a penſion;"</q> and that Johnſon bore this with good-humour.</p>
               <p>Johnſon praiſed the Earl of Carliſle's Poems, which his Lordſhip had publiſhed with his name, as not diſdaining to be a candidate for literary fame. My friend was of opinion, that when a man of rank appeared in that character, he deſerved to have his merit handſomely allowed <note n="6" place="bottom">
                     <p>Men of rank and fortune however ſhould be pretty well aſſured of having a real claim to the approbation of the publick as writers, before they venture to ſtand forth. Dryden in his Preſace to <q rend="inline">"All for Love,"</q> thus expreſſes himſelf:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="inline">"Men of pleaſant converſation (at leaſt eſteemed ſo) and endued with a trifling kind of fancy, perhaps helped out by a ſmattering of Latin, are ambitious to diſtinguiſh themſelves from the herd of gentlemen, by their poetry:
<q>
                              <l>'Rarus euim fermè ſenſus communis illâ</l>
                              <l>'Fortunâ.—</l>
                           </q>
And is not this a wretched affectation, not to be contented with what fortune has done for them, and ſit down quietly with their eſtates, but they muſt call their wits in queſtion, and needleſly expoſe their nakedneſs to publick view? Not conſidering that they are not to expect the ſame approbation from ſober men, which they have found from their flatterers after the third bottle: If a little glittering in diſcourſe has paſſed them on us for witty men, where was the neceſſity of undeceiving the world? Would a man who has an ill title to an eſtate, but yet is in poſſeſſion of it, would he bring it of his own accord to be tried at Weſtminſter? We who write, if we want the talents, yet have the excuſe that we do it for a poor ſubſiſtence; but what can be urged in their defence, who not having the vocation of poverty to ſcribble, out of mere wantonneſs take pains to make themſelves ridiculous? Horace was certainly in the right where he ſaid, 'That no man is ſatisfied with his own condition.' A Poet is not pleaſed, becauſe he is not rich; and the rich are diſcontented becauſe the poets will not admit them of their number."</q>

               <p>Johnſon had called twice on the Biſhop of Killaloe before his Lordſhip ſet out for Ireland, having miſſed him the firſt time. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It would have hung heavy on my heart if I had not ſeen him. No man ever paid more attention to another than he has done to me <note n="7" place="bottom">
                        <p>This gave me a very great pleaſure, for there had been once a pretty ſmart altercation between Dr. Barnard and him, upon a queſtion, whether a man could improve himſelf after the age of forty-five; when Johnſon in a haſty humour, expreſſed himſelf in a manner not quite civil. Dr. Barnard made it the ſubject of a copy of pleaſant verſes, in which he ſuppoſed himſelf to learn different perfections from different men. They concluded with delicate irony:</p>

                        <p>I know not if Johnſon ever ſaw the Poem, but I had occaſion to find that as Dr. Barnard and he knew each other better, their mutual regard increaſed.</p>
                     </note>; and I have neglected him, not wilfully, but from being otherwiſe occupied. Always, Sir, ſet a high value on ſpontaneous kindneſs. He, whoſe inclination prompts him to cultivate your friendſhip of his own accord, will love you more than one whom you have been at pains to attach to you."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon told me, that he was once much pleaſed to find that a carpenter, who lived near him, was very ready to ſhew him ſome things in his buſineſs which he wiſhed to ſee. <q rend="inline">"It was paying (ſaid he) reſpect to literature."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I aſked him if he was not diſſatisfied with having ſo ſmall a ſhare of wealth, and none of thoſe diſtinctions in the ſtate which are the objects of ambition. He had only a penſion of three hundred a year. Why was he not in ſuch circumſtances as to keep his coach? Why had he not ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable office? JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I have never complained of the world;
<pb n="399" facs="tcp:0548300102:401" rendition="simple:additions"/>
nor do I think that I have reaſon to complain. It is rather to be wondered  at that I have ſo much. My penſion is more out of the uſual courſe of things than any inſtance that I have known. Here, Sir, was a man avowedly no friend to the Government at the time, gets a penſion without aſking for it. I never courted the great; they ſent for me: but I think they now give me up. They are ſatisfied. They have ſeen enough of me."</q> Upon my obſerving that I could not believe this, for they muſt certainly be highly pleaſed by his converſation; conſcious of his own ſuperiority, he anſwered, <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; great Lords and great Ladies don't love to have their mouths ſtopped."</q> This was very expreſſive of the effect which the force of his underſtanding and brilliancy of his fancy could not but produce; and, to be ſure, they muſt have found themſelves ſtrangely diminiſhed in his company. When I warmly declared how happy I was at all times to hear him;—<q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir (ſaid he). But if you were Lord Chancellor, it would not be ſo: you would then conſider your own dignity."</q>
               </p>
               <p>There was much truth and knowledge of human nature in this remark. But certainly one ſhould think, that in whatever elevated ſtate of life a man who <hi>knew</hi> the value of the converſation of Johnſon might be placed, though he might prudently avoid a ſituation in which he might appear leſſened by compariſon; yet he would frequently gratify himſelf in private with the participation of the rich intellectual entertainment which Johnſon could furniſh. Strange, however, it is, to conſider how few of the great ſought his ſociety; ſo that if one were diſpoſed to take occaſion for ſatire on that account, very conſpicuous objects preſent themſelves. His noble friend, Lord Elibank, well obſerved, that if a great man procured an interview with Johnſon, and did not wiſh to ſee him more, it ſhewed a mere idle curioſity, and a wretched want of reliſh for extraordinary powers of mind. Mrs. Thrale juſtly and wittily accounted for ſuch conduct by ſaying, that Johnſon's converſation was by much too ſtrong for a perſon accuſtomed to obſequiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and flattery; it was <hi>muſtard in a young child's mouth!</hi>

                           <p>A wiſe Tory and a wiſe Whig, I believe, will agree. Their principles are the ſame, though their modes of thinking are different. A high Tory
<pb n="400" facs="tcp:0548300102:402" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 makes Government unintelligible: it is loſt in the clouds. A violent Whig makes it impracticable: he is for allowing ſo much liberty to every man, that there is not power enough to govern any man. The prejudice of the Tory is for eſtabliſhment: the prejudice of the Whig is for innovation. A Tory does not wiſh to give more real power to Government; but that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould have more reverence. Then they differ as to the Church. The Tory is not for giving more legal power to the Clergy, but wiſhes they ſhould have a conſiderable influence, founded on the opinion of mankind: the Whig is for limiting and watching them with a narrow jealouſy.</p>

               <p>On Saturday, June 2, I ſet out for Scotland, and had engaged, as I ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times did, to pay a viſit, in my way, at Southill, in Bedfordſhire, at the hoſpitable manſion of 'Squire Dilly, the elder brother of my worthy friends the bookſellers in the Poultry. Dr. Johnſon agreed to be of the party this year, with Mr. Charles Dilly and me, and to go and ſee Lord Bute's ſeat at Luton Hoe. He talked little to us in the carriage, being chiefly occupied in reading Dr. Watſon's ſecond volume of <q rend="inline">"Chemical Eſſays,"</q> which he liked very well, and his own <q rend="inline">"Prince of Abyſſinia,"</q> on which he ſeemed to be intenſely fixed; having told us, that he had not looked at it ſince it was firſt publiſhed. I happened to take it out of my pocket to-day, and he ſeized upon it with avidity. He pointed out to me the following remarkable paſſage: <q rend="inline">"By what means (ſaid the Prince) are the Europeans thus powerful; or why, ſince they can ſo eaſily viſit Aſia and Africa for trade or conqueſt, cannot the Aſiaticks and Africans invade their coaſts, plant colonies in their ports, and give laws to their natural princes? The ſame wind that carries them back would bring us hither."</q>—<q rend="inline">"They are more powerful, Sir, than we, (anſwered Imlac,) becauſe they are wiſer. Knowledge will always predominate over ignorance, as man governs the other animals. But why their knowledge is more than ours, I know not what reaſon can be given, but the unſearchable will of the Supreme Being."</q> He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"This, Sir, no man can explain otherwiſe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We ſtopped at Welwyn, where I wiſhed much to ſee, in company with Dr. Johnſon, the reſidence of the authour of <q rend="inline">"Night Thoughts,"</q> which was then poſſeſſed by his ſon, Mr. Young. Here ſome addreſs was requiſite, for I was not acquainted with Mr. Young, and had I propoſed to Dr. Johnſon that we ſhould ſend to him, he would have checked my wiſh, and perhaps been offended. I therefore concerted with Mr. Dilly, that I ſhould ſteal away from Dr. Johnſon and him, and try what reception I could procure from
<pb n="401" facs="tcp:0548300102:403" rendition="simple:additions"/>
Mr. Young; if unfavourable nothing was to be ſaid; but if agreeable I ſhould  return and notify it to them. I haſtened to Mr. Young's, found he was at home, ſent in word that a gentleman deſired to wait upon him, and was ſhewn into a parlour, where he and a young lady, his daughter, were ſitting. He appeared to be a plain, civil, country gentleman; and when I begged pardon for preſuming to trouble him, but ſaid I wiſhed much to ſee his place, if he would give me leave; he behaved very courteouſly, and anſwered, <q rend="inline">"By all means, Sir; we are juſt going to drink tea; will you ſit down?"</q> I thanked him, but ſaid, that Dr. Johnſon had come with me from London, and I muſt return to the inn and drink tea with him; that my name was Boſwell, I had travelled with him in the Hebrides. <q rend="inline">"Sir (ſaid he) I ſhould think it a great honour to ſee Dr. Johnſon here. Will you allow me to ſend for him?"</q> Availing myſelf of this opening, I ſaid that <q rend="inline">"I would go myſelf and bring him, when he had drunk tea; he knew nothing of my calling here."</q> Having been thus ſucceſsful, I haſtened back to the inn, and informed Dr. Johnſon that <q rend="inline">"Mr. Young, ſon of Dr. Young, the authour of 'Night Thoughts,' whom I had juſt left, deſired to have the honour of ſeeing him at the houſe where his father lived."</q> Dr. Johnſon luckily made no inquiry how this invitation had ariſen, but agreed to go, and when we entered Mr. Young's parlour, he addreſſed him with a very polite bow, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I had a curioſity to come and ſee this place. I had the honour to know that great man, your father."</q> We went into the garden, where we found a gravel walk, on each ſide of which was a row of trees, planted by Dr. Young, which formed a handſome Gothick arch; Dr. Johnſon called it a fine grove. I beheld it with reverence.</p>
               <p>We ſat ſome time in the ſummer-houſe, on the outſide wall of which was inſcribed, <q rend="inline">"Ambulantes in horto audiebant vocem Dei."</q> And in reference to a brook by which it is ſituated, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Vivendi rectè qui prorogat horam,</hi> &amp;c."</q> I ſaid to Mr. Young, that I had been told his father was cheerful. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) he was too well-bred a man not to be cheerful in company; but he was gloomy when alone. He never was cheerful after my mother's death, and he had met with many diſappointments."</q> Dr. Johnſon obſerved to me afterwards, <q rend="inline">"That this was no favourable account of Dr. Young; for it is not becoming in a man to have ſo little acquieſcence in the ways of Providence, as to be gloomy becauſe he has not obtained as much preferment as he expected; nor to continue gloomy for the loſs of his wife. Grief has its time."</q> The laſt part of this cenſure was theoretically made. Practically, we know that grief for the loſs of a wiſe may be continued very long, in
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:0548300102:404" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 proportion as affection has been ſincere. No man knew this better than Dr. Johnſon.</p>
               <p>We went into the church, and looked at the monument erected by Mr. Young, to his father. Mr. Young mentioned an anecdote, that his father had received ſeveral thouſand pounds of ſubſcription-money for his <q rend="inline">"Univerſal Paſſion,"</q> but had loſt it in the South-Sea. Dr. Johnſon thought this muſt be a miſtake; for he had never ſeen a ſubſcription-book.</p>
               <p>Upon the road we talked of the uncertainty of profit with which authours and bookſellers engage in the publication of literary works. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"My judgement I have found is no certain rule as to the ſale of a book."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, have you been much plagued with authours ſending you their works to reviſe?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; I have been thought a ſour ſurly fellow."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Very lucky for you, Sir—in that reſpect."</q> I muſt however obſerve, that notwithſtanding what he now ſaid, which he no doubt imagined at the time to be the fact, there was, perhaps, no man who more frequently yielded to the ſolicitations even of very obſcure authours, to read their manuſcripts, or more liberally aſſiſted them with advice and correction.</p>
               <p>He found himſelf very happy at Mr. Dilly's, where there is always abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of excellent fare and hearty welcome.</p>
               <p>On Sunday, June 3, we all went to Southill church, which is very near to Mr. Dilly's houſe. It being the firſt Sunday of the month, the holy ſacrament was adminiſtered, and I ſtaid to partake of it. When I came afterwards into Dr. Johnſon's room, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"You did right to ſtay and receive the communion; I had not thought of it."</q> This ſeemed to imply that he did not chooſe to approach the altar without a previous preparation, as to which good men entertain different opinions, ſome holding that it is irreverent to partake of that ordinance without conſiderable premeditation; others, that whoever is a ſincere Chriſtian, and in a proper frame to diſcharge any other ritual duty of our religion, may, without ſcruple, diſcharge this moſt ſolemn one. A middle notion I believe to be the juſt one, which is, that communicants need not think a long train of preparatory forms indiſpenſibly neceſſary; but neither ſhould they raſhly and lightly venture upon ſo aweful and myſterious an inſtitution. Chriſtians muſt judge each for himſelf, what degree of retirement and ſelf-examination is neceſſary upon each occaſion.</p>
               <p>Being in a frame, which, I hope for the felicity of human nature, many experience—in fine weather—at the country-houſe of a friend—conſoled and elevated by pious exerciſes—I expreſſed myſelf with an unreſtrained ſervour to my <q rend="inline">"Guide, Philoſopher, and Friend;"</q> 
                  <q rend="inline">"My dear Sir, I would fain be a good man; and I am very good now. I fear GOD, and honour the King, I wiſh
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:0548300102:405" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to do no ill, and to be benevolent to all mankind."</q> He looked at me with a  benignant indulgence; but took occaſion to give me able and ſalutary caution. <q rend="inline">"Do not, Sir, accuſtom yourſelf to truſt to <hi>impreſſions.</hi> There is a middle ſtate of mind between conviction and hypocriſy, of which many are conſcious. By truſting to impreſſions, a man may gradually come to yield to them, and at length be ſubject to them, ſo as not to be a free agent, or what is the ſame thing in effect, to <hi>ſuppoſe</hi> that he is not a free agent. A man who is in that ſtate, ſhould not be ſuffered to live; if he declares he cannot help acting in a particular way, but is irreſiſtibly impelled, there can be no confidence in him, no more than in a tyger. But, Sir, no man believes himſelf to be impelled irreſiſtibly; we know that he who ſays he believes it, lies. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable impreſſions at particular moments, as to the ſtate of our ſouls, may be deceitful and dangerous. In general no man can be ſure of his acceptance with GOD; ſome, indeed, may have had it revealed to them. St. Paul, who wrought miracles, may have had a miracle wrought on himſelf, and may have obtained ſupernatural aſſurance of pardon, and mercy, and beatitude; yet St. Paul, though he expreſſes ſtrong hope, alſo expreſſes fear, leſt having preached to others, he himſelf ſhould be a caſt-away."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The opinion of a learned Biſhop of our acquaintance, as to there being merit in religious faith, being mentioned. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, yes, Sir, the moſt licentious man, were hell open before him, would not take the moſt beautiful ſtrumpet to his arms. We muſt, as the Apoſtle ſays, live by faith, not by ſight."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I talked to him of original ſin <note n="8" place="bottom">Dr. Ogden, in his ſecond ſermon <q rend="inline">"On the Articles of the Chriſtian Faith,"</q> with admirable acuteneſs thus addreſſes the oppoſers of that doctrine, which accounts for the confuſion, ſin, and miſery, which we find in this life: <q rend="inline">"It would be ſevere in GOD, you think, to <hi>degrade</hi> us to ſuch a ſad ſtate as this, for the offence of our firſt parents; but you can allow him to <hi>place</hi> us in it, without any inducement. Are our calamities leſſened for not being aſcribed to Adam? If your condition be unhappy, is it not ſtill unhappy, whatever was the occaſion? With the aggravation of this reflection, that if it was as good as it was at firſt deſigned, there ſeems to be ſomewhat the leſs reaſon to look for its amendment."</q>
                  </note>, in conſequence of the fall of man, and of the atonement made by our SAVIOUR. After ſome converſation, which he deſired me to remember, he at my requeſt dictated to me as follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>WITH reſpect to original ſin, the inquiry is not neceſſary; for whatever is the cauſe of human corruption, men are evidently and confeſſedly ſo cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, that all the laws of heaven and earth, are inſufficient to reſtrain them from crimes.</p>
                  <p>

 Whatever difficulty there may be in the conception of vicarious puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, it is an opinion which has had poſſeſſion of mankind in all ages. There is no nation that has not uſed the practice of ſacrifices. Whoever, therefore, denies the propriety of vicarious puniſhments, holds an opinion which the ſentiments and practice of mankind have contradicted, from the beginning of the world. The great ſacrifice for the ſins of mankind was offered at the death of the MESSIAH, who is called in ſcripture, <q rend="inline">'The Lamb of GOD, that taketh away the ſins of the world.'</q> To judge of the reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the ſcheme of redemption, it muſt be conſidered as neceſſary to the government of the univerſe, that GOD ſhould make known his perpetual and irreconcileable deteſtation of moral evil. He might indeed puniſh, and puniſh only the offenders: but as the end of puniſhment is not revenge of crimes, but propagation of virtue, it was more becoming the Divine clemency to find another manner of proceeding, leſs deſtructive to man, and at leaſt equally powerful to promote goodneſs. The end of puniſhment is to reclaim and warn. <hi>That</hi> puniſhment will both reclaim and warn, which ſhews evidently ſuch abhorrence of ſin in GOD, as may deter us from it, or ſtrike us with dread of vengeance when we have committed it. This is effected by vicarious puniſhment. Nothing could more teſtify the oppoſition between the nature of GOD and moral evil, or more amply diſplay his juſtice, to men and angels, to all orders and ſucceſſions of beings, than that it was neceſſary for the higheſt and pureſt nature, even for DIVINITY itſelf, to pacify the demands of vengeance, by a painful death; of which the natural effect will be, that when juſtice is appeaſed, there is a proper place for the exerciſe of mercy; and that ſuch propitiation ſhall ſupply, in ſome degree, the imperfections of our obedience, and the inefficacy of our repentance. For, obedience and repentance, ſuch as we can perform, are ſtill neceſſary. Our SAVIOUR has told us, that he did not come to deſtroy the law, but to fulfil: to fulfil the typical law, by the performance of what thoſe types had foreſhewn; and the moral law, by precepts of greater purity and higher exaltation.</p>
               </q>
               <p>[Here he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"GOD bleſs you with it."</q> I acknowledged myſelf much obliged to him; but I begged that he would go on as to the propitiation being the chief object of our moſt holy faith. He then dictated this one other paragraph.]</p>
               <p>
                  <q>The peculiar doctrine of Chriſtianity is, that of an univerſal ſacrifice, and perpetual propitiation. Other prophets only proclaimed the will and the threatenings of GOD. CHRIST ſatisfied his juſtice.</q>

The Reverend Mr. Palmer, Fellow of Queen's-College, Cambridge, dined  with us. He expreſſed a wiſh that a better proviſion were made for pariſh-clerks. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; a pariſh-clerk ſhould be a man who is able to make a will, or write a letter for any body in the pariſh."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned Lord Monboddo's notion that the ancient Egyptians, with all their learning, and all their arts, were not only black, but woolly-haired. Mr. Palmer aſked how did it appear upon examining the mummies? Dr. Johnſon approved of this teſt.</p>
               <p>Although upon moſt occaſions I never heard a more ſtrenuous advocate for the advantages of wealth, than Dr. Johnſon; he this day, I know not from what caprice, took the other ſide. <q rend="inline">"I have not obſerved (ſaid he) that men of very large fortunes enjoy any thing extraordinary that makes happineſs. What has the Duke of Bedford? What has the Duke of Devonſhire? The only great inſtance that I have ever known of the enjoyment of wealth was, that of Jamaica Dawkins, who going to viſit Palmyra, and hearing that the way was infeſted by robbers, hired a troop of Turkiſh horſe to guard him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Gibbons, the Diſſenting miniſter, being mentioned, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I took to Dr. Gibbons."</q> And addreſſing himſelf to Mr. Charles Dilly, added, <q rend="inline">"I ſhall be glad to ſee him. Tell him, if he'll call on me, and dawdle over a diſh of tea in an afternoon, I ſhall take it kind."</q>
               </p>
               <p>The Reverend Mr. Smith, Vicar of Southill, a very reſpectable man, with a very agreeable family, ſent an invitation to us to drink tea. I remarked Dr. Johnſon's very formal politeneſs. Though always fond of changing the ſcene, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"We muſt have Mr. Dilly's leave. We cannot go from your houſe, Sir, without your permiſſion."</q> We all went, and were well ſatisfied with our viſit. I however remember nothing particular, except a nice diſtinction which Dr. Johnſon made with reſpect to the power of memory, maintaining that forgetfulneſs was a man's own fault. <q rend="inline">"To remember and to recollect (ſaid he) are different things. A man has not the power to recollect what is not in his mind; but when a thing is in his mind he may remember it."</q> The remark was occaſioned by my leaning back on a chair, which a little before I had perceived to be broken, and pleading forgetfulneſs as an excuſe. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) its being broken was certainly in your mind."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When I obſerved that a houſebreaker was in general very timorous. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No wonder, Sir; he is afraid of being ſhot getting <hi>into</hi> a houſe, or hanged when he has got <hi>out</hi> of it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He told us, that he had in one day written ſix ſheets of a tranſlation from the French; adding, <q rend="inline">"I ſhould be glad to ſee it now. I wiſh that I
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:0548300102:408" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 had copies of all the pamphlets written againſt me, as it is ſaid Pope had. Had I known that I ſhould make ſo much noiſe in the world, I ſhould have been at pains to collect them. I believe there is hardly a day in which there is not ſomething about me in the news-papers."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Monday, June 4, we all went to Luton-Hoe, to ſee Lord Bute's mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent ſeat, for which I had obtained a ticket. As we entered the park, I talked in a high ſtyle of my old friendſhip with Lord Mountſtuart, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I ſhall probably be much at this place."</q> The Sage, aware of human viciſſitudes, gently checked me: <q rend="inline">"Don't you be too ſure of that."</q> He made two or three peculiar obſervations; as when ſhewn the botanical garden, <q rend="inline">"Is not <hi>every</hi> garden a botanical garden?"</q> When told that there was a ſhrubbery to the extent of ſeveral miles; <q rend="inline">"That is making a very fooliſh uſe of the ground; a little of it is very well."</q> When it was propoſed that we ſhould walk on the pleaſure-ground; <q rend="inline">"Don't let us fatigue ourſelves. Why ſhould we walk there? Here's a fine tree, let's get to the top of it."</q> But upon the whole, he was very much pleaſed. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"This is one of the places I do not regret having come to ſee. It is a very ſtately place, indeed; in the houſe magnificence is not ſacrificed to convenience, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to magnificence. The library is very ſplendid; the dignity of the rooms is very great; and the quantity of pictures is beyond expectation, beyond hope.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It happened without any previous concert, that we viſited the ſeat of Lord Bute upon the King's birth-day; we dined and drank his Majeſty's health at an inn, in the village of Luton.</p>
               <p>In the evening I put him in mind of his promiſe to favour me with a copy of his celebrated Letter to the Earl of Cheſterfield <note n="9" place="bottom">See page 141 of Vol. I.</note>, and he was at laſt pleaſed to comply with this earneſt requeſt, by dictating it to me from his memory; for he believed that he himſelf had no copy. There was an animated glow in his countenance while he thus recalled his high-minded indignation.</p>
               <p>He laughed heartily at a ludicrous action in the Court of Seſſion, in which I was Counſel. The Society of <hi>Procurators,</hi> or Attornies, entitled to practiſe in the inferiour Courts at Edinburgh, had obtained a royal charter, in which they had taken care to have their ancient deſignation of <hi>Procurators,</hi> changed into that of <hi>Solicitors,</hi> from a notion, as they ſuppoſed, that it was more <hi>genteel;</hi> and this new title they diſplayed by a publick advertiſement for a <hi>General Meeting</hi> at their HALL.</p>

It has been ſaid, that the Scottiſh nation is not diſtinguiſhed for humour;  and, indeed, what happened on this occaſion may in ſome degree juſtify the remark: for although this ſociety had contrived to make themſelves a very prominent object for the ridicule of ſuch as might ſtoop to it, the only joke that appeared was the following paragraph, ſent as a card to the news-paper called <q rend="inline">"The Caledonian Mercury:"</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>A correſpondent informs us, that the Worſhipful Society of <hi>Chaldeans, Cadies,</hi> or <hi>Running Stationers</hi> of this city, are reſolved, in imitation, and encouraged by the ſingular ſucceſs of their brethren, of an <hi>equally reſpectable</hi> Society, to apply for a Charter of their Privileges, particularly of the ſole privilege of PROCURING, in the moſt extenſive ſenſe of the word, excluſive of chairmen, porters, penny-poſt men, and other <hi>inferiour</hi> ranks; their bretheren the R—Y—L S—LL—RS, <hi>alias</hi> P—C—RS, <hi>before the</hi> INFERIOUR Courts of this City, always excepted.</p>
                  <p>Should the Worſhipful Society be ſucceſsful, they are farther reſolved not to be <hi>puffed up</hi> thereby, but to demean themſelves with more equanimity and decency than their <hi>R-y-l, learned,</hi> and <hi>very modeſt</hi> brethren above men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned have done, upon their late dignification and exaltation.</p>
               </q>
               <p>A majority of the members of the Society proſecuted Mr. Robertſon, the publiſher of the paper, for damages; and the firſt judgement of the whole Court very wiſely diſmiſſed the action, <hi>Solventur riſu tabulae, tu miſſus abibis.</hi> But a new trial or review was granted upon a petition, according to the forms in Scotland. This petition I was engaged to anſwer, and Dr. Johnſon, with great alacrity furniſhed to-night what follows:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>All injury is either of the perſon, the fortune, or the fame. Now, it is a certain thing, it is proverbially known, that <hi>a jeſt breaks no bones.</hi> They never have gained half-a-crown leſs in the whole profeſſion ſince this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous paragraph has appeared: and, as to their reputation, What is their reputation but an inſtrument of getting money? If, therefore, they have loſt no money, the queſtion upon reputation may be anſwered by a very old poſition, <hi>De minimis non curat Praetor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whether there was, or was not, an <hi>animus injuriandi,</hi> is not worth inquiring, if no <hi>injuria</hi> can be proved. But the truth is, there was no <hi>animus injuriandi.</hi> It was only an <hi>animus irritandi</hi> 
                     <note n="1" place="bottom">Mr. Robertſon altered this word to <hi>jocandi,</hi> he having found in Blackſtone that to <hi>irritate</hi> is actionable.</note>, which, happening to be exerciſed upon a <hi>genus irritable,</hi> produced unexpected violence of reſentment. Their
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:0548300102:410"/>
 irritability aroſe only from an opinion of their own importance, and their delight in their new exaltation. What might have been borne by a <hi>Procurator</hi> could not be borne by a <hi>Solicitor.</hi> Your Lordſhips well know, that <hi>honores mutant mores.</hi> Titles and dignities play ſtrongly upon the fancy. As a mad-man is apt to think himſelf grown ſuddenly great; ſo he that grows ſuddenly great is apt to borrow a little from the mad-man. To co-operate with their reſentment would be to promote their phrenzy; nor is it poſſible to gueſs to what they might proceed, if to the new title of Solicitor, ſhould be added the elation of victory and triumph.</p>
                  <p>We conſider your Lordſhips as the protectors of our rights, and the guardians of our virtues; but believe it not included in your high office, that you ſhould flatter our vices, or ſolace our vanity: and, as vanity only dictates this proſecution, it is humbly hoped your Lordſhips will diſmiſs it.</p>
                  <p>If every attempt, however light or ludicrous, to leſſen another's reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is to be puniſhed by a judicial ſentence, what puniſhment can be ſufficiently ſevere for him who attempts to diminiſh the reputation of the Supreme Court of Juſtice, by reclaiming upon a cauſe already determined, without any change in the ſtate of the queſtion? Does it not imply hopes that the Judges will change their opinion? Is not uncertainty and inconſtancy in the higheſt degree diſreputable to a Court? Does it not ſuppoſe, that the former judgement was temerarious or negligent? Does it not leſſen the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the publick? Will it not be ſaid, that <hi>jus eſt aut incognitum, aut vagum?</hi> and will not the conſequence be drawn, <hi>miſera eſt ſervitus?</hi> Will not the rules of action be obſcure? Will not he who knows himſelf wrong to-day, hope that the Courts of Juſtice will think him right to-morrow? Surely, my Lords, theſe are attempts of dangerous tendency, which the Solicitors, as men verſed in the law, ſhould have foreſeen and avoided. It was natural for an ignorant printer to appeal from the Lord Ordinary; but from lawyers, the deſcendents of lawyers, who have practiſed for three hundred years, and have now raiſed themſelves to a higher denomination, it might be expected, that they ſhould know the reverence due to a judicial determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and, having been once diſmiſſed, ſhould ſit down in ſilence.</p>
               </q>
               <p>I am aſhamed to mention, that the Court, by a plurality of voices, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having a ſingle additional circumſtance before them, reverſed their own judgement, made a ſerious matter of this dull and fooliſh joke, and adjudged Mr. Robertſon to pay to the Society five pounds (ſterling money) and coſts of ſuit. The deciſion will ſeem ſtrange to Engliſh lawyers.</p>

On Tueſday, June 5, Johnſon was to return to London. He was very  pleaſant at breakfaſt; I mentioned a friend of mine having reſolved never to marry a pretty woman. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is a very fooliſh reſolution to reſolve not to marry a pretty woman. Beauty is of itſelf very eſtimable. No, Sir, I would prefer a pretty woman, unleſs there are objections to her. A pretty woman may be fooliſh; a pretty woman may be wicked; a pretty woman may not like me. But there is no ſuch danger in marrying a pretty woman as is apprehended; ſhe will not be perſecuted if ſhe does not invite perſecution. A pretty woman, if ſhe has a mind to be wicked, can find a readier way than another; and that is all."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I accompanied him in Mr. Dilly's chaiſe to Shefford, where talking of Lord Bute's never going to Scotland, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"As an Engliſhman, I ſhould wiſh all the Scotch gentlemen to be educated in England; Scotland would become a province; they would ſpend all their rents in England."</q> This is a ſubject of much conſequence, and much delicacy. The advantage of an Engliſh education is unqueſtionably very great to Scotch gentlemen of talents and ambition; and regular viſits, and I ſhould think other means, might be effectually uſed to prevent them from being totally eſtranged from their native country, any more than a Cumberland or Northumberland gentleman, who has been educated in the South of England. I own, indeed, that it is no ſmall misfortune for Scotch gentlemen, who have neither talents nor ambition, to be educated in England, where they may be perhaps diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed only by a nick-name, laviſh their fortune in giving expenſive enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments to thoſe who laugh at them, and ſaunter about as mere idle inſignificant hangers on even upon the fooliſh great; when if they had been judiciouſly brought up at home, they might have been comfortable and creditable members of ſociety.</p>
               <p>At Shefford, I had another affectionate parting from my revered friend, who was taken up by the Bedford coach, and carried to the metropolis. I went with Meſſieurs Dilly, to ſee ſome friends at Bedford; dined with the officers of the militia of the county, and next day proceeded on my journey.</p>

The following curious anecdote I inſert in Dr. Burney's own words. <q rend="inline">"Dr.  Burney related to Dr. Johnſon the partiality which his writings had excited in a friend of Dr. Burney's, the late Mr. Bewley, well known in Norfolk by the name of the <hi>Philoſopher of Maſſingham;</hi> who, from the Ramblers and Plan of his Dictionary, and long before the authour's fame was eſtabliſhed by the Dictionary itſelf, or any other work, had conceived ſuch a reverence for him, that he urgently begged Dr. Burney to give him the cover of the firſt letter he had received from him, as a relick of ſo eſtimable a writer. This was in 1755. In 1760, when Dr. Burney viſited Dr. Johnſon at the Temple in London, where he had then Chambers, he happened to arrive there before he was up; and being ſhewn into the room where he was to breakfaſt, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf alone, he examined the contents of the apartment, to try whether he could undiſcovered ſteal any thing to ſend to his friend Bewley, as another relick of the admirable Dr. Johnſon. But finding nothing better to his purpoſe, he cut ſome briſtles off his hearth-broom, and incloſed them in a letter to his country enthuſiaſt, who received them with due reverence. The Doctor was ſo ſenſible of the honour done him by a man of genius and ſcience, to whom he was an utter ſtranger, that he ſaid to Dr. Burney, 'Sir, there is no man poſſeſſed of the ſmalleſt portion of modeſty, but muſt be flattered with the admiration of ſuch a man. I'll give him a ſet of my Lives, if he will do me the honour to accept of them.' In this he kept his word; and Dr. Burney had not only the pleaſure of gratifying his friend with a preſent more worthy of his acceptance than the ſegment from the hearth-broom, but ſoon after of introducing him to Dr. Johnſon himſelf in Bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court, with whom he had the ſatisfaction of converſing a conſiderable time, not a fortnight before his death; which happened in St. Martin's-ſtreet, during his viſit to Dr. Burney, in the houſe where the great Sir Iſaac Newton had lived and died before."</q>

 How venerably pious does he appear in theſe moments of ſolitude, and how ſpirited are his reſolutions for the improvement of his mind, even in elegant literature at a very advanced period of life, and when afflicted with many complaints.</p>
               <p>In autumn he went to Oxford, Birmingham, Lichfield, and Aſhbourne, for which very good reaſons might be given, in the conjectural yet poſitive manner of writers, who are proud to account for every event which they relate. He himſelf however ſays, <q rend="inline">"The motives of my journey I hardly know; I omitted it laſt year, and am not willing to miſs it again <note n="3" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 201.</note>."</q> But ſome good conſiderations ariſe, amongſt which is the kindly recollection of Mr. Hector, ſurgeon, at Birmingham. <q rend="inline">"Hector is likewiſe an old friend, the only companion of my childhood that paſſed through the ſchool with me. We have always loved one another; perhaps we may be made better by ſome ſerious converſation, of which however I have no diſtinct hope."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſays too, <q rend="inline">"At Lichfield, my native place, I hope to ſhew a good example by frequent attendance on publick worſhip."</q>
               </p>
               <p>My correſpondence with him during the reſt of this year was I know not why very ſcanty, and all on my ſide. I wrote him one letter to introduce Mr. Sinclair (now Sir John) the member for Caithneſs, to his acquaintance; and informed him in another, that my wife had again been affected with alarming ſymptoms of illneſs.</p>

               <p>In one of his regiſters of this year, there occurs the following curious paſſage: <q rend="inline">"Jan. 20. The miniſtry is diſſolved. I prayed with Francis, and gave thanks <note n="8" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 209.</note>."</q> It has been the ſubject of diſcuſſion, whether there are two diſtinct particulars mentioned here, or that we are to underſtand the giving of thanks to be in conſequence of the diſſolution of the miniſtry. In ſupport of the laſt of theſe conjectures, may be urged his mean opinion of that miniſtry, which has frequently appeared in the courſe of this work; and it is ſtrongly confirmed by what he ſaid on the ſubject to Mr. Seward:—<q rend="inline">"I am glad the miniſtry is removed. Such a bunch of imbecility never diſgraced a country. If they ſent a meſſenger into the City to take up a printer, the meſſenger was taken up inſtead of the printer, and committed by the ſitting Alderman. If they ſent one army to the relief of another, the firſt army was defeated and taken before the ſecond arrived. I will not ſay that what they did was always wrong; but it was always done at a wrong time."</q>

                     <p>IT is now long ſince we ſaw one another, and whatever has been the reaſon neither you have written to me, nor I to you. To let friendſhip die away by negligence and ſilence, is certainly not wiſe. It is voluntarily to throw away one of the greateſt comforts of this weary pilgrimage, of which when it is, as it muſt be, taken finally away, he that travels on alone, will wonder how his eſteem could be ſo little. Do not forget me; you ſee that I do not forget you. It is pleaſing in the ſilence of ſolitude to think, that there is one at leaſt, however diſtant, of whoſe benevolence there is little doubt, and whom there is yet hope of ſeeing again.</p>
                     <p>Of my life, from the time we parted, the hiſtory is mournful. The ſpring of laſt year deprived me of Thrale, a man whoſe eye for fifteen years had ſcarcely been turned upon me but with reſpect or tenderneſs; for ſuch another friend, the general courſe of human things will not ſuffer man to hope. I paſſed the ſummer at Streatham, but there was no Thrale; and having idled away the ſummer with a weakly body and neglected mind, I made a journey to Staffordſhire on the edge of winter. The ſeaſon was dreary, I was ſickly, and found the friends ſickly whom I went to ſee. After a ſorrowful ſojourn, I returned to a habitation poſſeſſed for the preſent by two ſick women, where my dear old friend, Mr. Levett, to whom as he uſed to tell me, I owe your acquaintance, died a few weeks ago, ſuddenly in his bed; there paſſed not, I believe, a minute between health and death. At night, as at Mrs. Thrale's, I was muſing in my chamber, I thought with uncommon earneſtneſs, that however I might alter my mode of life, or whitherſoever I might remove,

 I would endeavour to retain Levett about me; in the morning my ſervant brought me word that Levett was called to another ſtate, a ſtate for which, I think, he was not unprepared, for he was very uſeful to the poor. How much ſoever I valued him, I now wiſh that I had valued him more.</p>
                     <p>I have myſelf been ill more than eight weeks of a diſorder, from which at the expence of about fifty ounces of blood, I hope I am now recovering.</p>

                     <p>I HOPE I do not very groſly flatter myſelf to imagine that you and dear Mrs. Careleſs will be glad to hear ſome account of me. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the journey to London with very little inconvenience, and came ſafe to my habitation, where I found nothing but ill health, and, of conſequence, very little cheerfulneſs. I then went to viſit a little way into the country, where I got a complaint by a cold which has hung eight weeks upon me, and from which I am, at the expence of fifty ounces of blood, not yet free. I am afraid I muſt once more owe my recovery to warm weather, which ſeems to make the advances towards us.</p>
                     <p>Such is my health, which will, I hope, ſoon grow better. In other reſpects I have no reaſon to complain. I know not that I have written any thing more generally commended than the Lives of the Poets; and have found the world willing enough to careſs me, if my health had invited me to be in much company: but this ſeaſon I have been almoſt wholly employed in nurſing myſelf.</p>
                     <p>When ſummer comes I hope to ſee you again, and will not put off my viſit to the end of the year. I have lived ſo long in London, that I did not remember the difference of ſeaſons.</p>

Your health, when I ſaw you, was much improved. You will be  prudent enough not to put it in danger. I hope, when we meet again, we ſhall all congratulate each other upon fair proſpects of longer life; though what are the pleaſures of the longeſt life, when placed in compariſon with a happy death?</p>

                     <p>THAT you and dear Mrs. Careleſs ſhould have care or curioſity about my health, gives me that pleaſure which every man feels from finding himſelf not forgotten. In age we feel again that love of our native place and our early friends, which, in the buſtle or amuſements of middle life, were overborn and ſuſpended. You and I ſhould now naturally cling to one another: we have outlived moſt of thoſe who could pretend to rival us in each other's kindneſs. In our walk through life we have dropped our companions, and are now to pick up ſuch as chance may offer us, or to travel on alone. You, indeed, have a ſiſter, with whom you can divide the day: I have no natural friend left; but Providence has been pleaſed to preſerve me from neglect; I have not wanted ſuch alleviations of life as friendſhip could ſupply. My health has been, from my twentieth year, ſuch as has ſeldom afforded me a ſingle day of eaſe; but it is at leaſt not worſe: and I ſometimes make myſelf believe that it is better. My diſorders are, however, ſtill ſufficiently oppreſſive.</p>

                     <p>THE pleaſure which we uſed to receive from each other on Good-Friday and Eaſter-day, we muſt be this year content to miſs. Let us, however, pray for each other, and hope to ſee one another yet from time to time with mutual delight. My diſorder has been a cold, which impeded the organs of reſpiration, and kept me many weeks in a ſtate of great uneaſineſs, but by repeated phlebotomy it is now relieved; and next to the recovery of Mrs. Boſwell, I flatter myſelf, that you will rejoice at mine.</p>
                     <p>What we ſhall do in the ſummer it is yet too early to conſider. You want to know what you ſhall do now; I do not think this time of buſtle and confuſion likely to produce any advantage to you. Every man has thoſe to reward and gratify who have contributed to his advancement. To come hither with ſuch expectations at the expence of borrowed money, which, I find, you know not where to borrow, can hardly be conſidered as prudent. I am ſorry to find, what your ſollicitation ſeems to imply, that you have already gone the whole length of your credit. This is to ſet the quiet of your whole life at hazard. If you anticipate your inheritance, you can at laſt inherit nothing; all that you receive muſt pay for the paſt. You muſt get a place, or pine in penury, with the empty name of a great eſtate. Poverty, my dear friend, is ſo great an evil, and pregnant with ſo much temptation, and ſo much miſery, that I cannot but earneſtly enjoin you to avoid it. Live on what you have, live if you can on leſs; do not borrow either for vanity or pleaſure; the vanity will end in ſhame, and the pleaſure in regret; ſtay therefore at home, till you have ſaved money for your journey hither.</p>
                     <p>The Beauties of Johnſon' are ſaid to have got money to the collector; if the 'Deformities' have the ſame ſucceſs, I ſhall be ſtill a more extenſive benefactor.</p>
                     <p>Make my compliments to Mrs. Boſwell, who is, I hope, reconciled to me; and to the young people, whom I never have offended.</p>
                     <p>You never told me the ſucceſs of your plea againſt the Solicitors.</p>

                        <p>BEING now in the country in a ſtate of recovery, as I hope, from a very oppreſſive diſorder, I cannot neglect the acknowledgement of your Chriſtian letter. The book called <q rend="inline">"The Beauties of Johnſon,"</q> is the production of I know not whom: I never ſaw it but by caſual inſpection, and conſidered myſelf as utterly diſengaged from its conſequences. Of the paſſage you mention, I remember ſome notice in ſome paper; but, knowing that it muſt be miſrepreſented, I thought of it no more, nor do I know where to find it in my own books. I am accuſtomed to think little of news-papers; but an opinion ſo weighty and ſerious as yours has determined me to do, what I ſhould, without your ſeaſonable admonition, have omitted; and I will direct my thought to be ſhewn in its true ſtate <note n="5" place="bottom">
                              <p>What follows appeared in the Morning Chronicle of May 29, 1782.—<q>
                                    <p>A correſpondent having mentioned, in the Morning Chronicle of December 12, the laſt clauſe of the following paragraph, as ſeeming to favour ſuicide; we are requeſted to print the whole paſſage, that its true meaning may appear, which is not to recommend ſuicide, but exerciſe.</p>
                                    <p>Exerciſe cannot ſecure us from that diſſolution to which we are decreed; but while the ſoul and body continue united, it can make the aſſociation pleaſing, and give probable hopes that they ſhall be disjoined by an eaſy ſeparation. It was a principle among the ancients, that a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                           </note>. If I could find the paſſage, I would direct you to it. I ſuppoſe the tenour is this:—'Acute diſeaſes are the immediate and inevitable ſtrokes of Heaven; but of them the pain is ſhort, and the concluſion ſpeedy: chronical diſorders, by which we are ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in tedious torture between life and death, are commonly the effect of

 our own miſconduct and intemperance. To die, &amp;c.'—This, Sir, you ſee, is all true, and all blameleſs. I hope, ſome time in the next week, to have all rectified.

                     </opener>
                     <p>THE earneſtneſs and tenderneſs of your letter is ſuch, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think myſelf ſhewing it more reſpect than it claims by ſitting down to anſwer it the day on which I received it.</p>
                     <p>This year has afflicted me with a very irkſome and ſevere diſorder. My reſpiration has been much impeded, and much blood has been taken away. I am now harraſſed by a catarrhous cough, from which my purpoſe is to ſeek relief by change of air; and I am, therefore, preparing to go to Oxford.</p>
                     <p>Whether I did right in diſſuading you from coming to London this ſpring, I will not determine. You have not loſt much by miſſing my com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; I have ſcarcely been well for a ſingle week. I might have received comfort from your kindneſs; but you would have ſeen me afflicted, and, perhaps, found me peeviſh. Whatever might have been your pleaſure or mine, I know not how I could have honeſtly adviſed you to come hither with borrowed money. Do not accuſtom yourſelf to conſider debts only as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience: you will find it a calamity. Poverty takes away ſo many means of doing good, and produces ſo much inability to reſiſt evil, both natural and moral, that it is by all virtuous means to be avoided. Conſider a man whoſe fortune is very narrow; whatever be his rank by birth, or whatever his reputation by intellectual excellence, what good can he do? or what evil can he prevent? That he cannot help the needy is evident, he has nothing ro ſpare. But, perhaps, his advice or admonition may be uſeful. His poverty will deſtroy his influence: many more can find that he is poor,
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:0548300102:427"/>
than that he is wiſe; and few will reverence the underſtanding that is of ſo  little advantage to its owner. I ſay nothing of the perſonal wretchedneſs of a debtor, which, however, has paſſed into a proverb. Of riches, it is not neceſſary to write the praiſe. Let it, however, be remembered, that he who has money to ſpare, has it always in his power to benefit others; and of ſuch power a good man muſt always be deſirous.</p>
                     <p>I am pleaſed with your account of Eaſter <note n="7" place="bottom">Which I celebrated in the Church-of-England chapel at Edinburgh, founded by Lord Chief Baron Smith, of reſpectable and pious memory.</note>. We ſhall meet, I hope, in autumn, both well and both chearful; and part each the better for the other's company.</p>

                     <p>Your father's death had every circumſtance that could enable you to bear it; it was at a mature age, and it was expected; and as his general life had been pious, his thoughts had doubtleſs for many years paſt been turned upon eternity. That you did not find him ſenſible muſt doubtleſs grieve you; his diſpoſition towards you was undoubtedly that of a kind, though not of a fond father. Kindneſs, at leaſt actual, is in our power, but fondneſs is not; and if by negligence or imprudence you had extinguiſhed his fondneſs, he could not at will rekindle it. Nothing then remained between you but mutual forgiveneſs of each other's faults, and mutual deſire of each other's happineſs.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall long to know his final diſpoſition of his fortune.</p>
                     <p>You, dear Sir, have now a new ſtation, and have therefore new cares, and new employments. Life, as Cowley ſeems to ſay, ought to reſemble a well ordered poem; of which one rule generally received is, that the exordium ſhould be ſimple, and ſhould promiſe little. Begin your new courſe of life with the leaſt ſhow, and the leaſt expence poſſible; you may at pleaſure encreaſe both, but you cannot eaſily diminiſh them. Do not think your eſtate your own, while any man can call upon you for money which you cannot pay; therefore, begin with timorous parſimony. Let it be your firſt care not to be in any man's debt.</p>
                     <p>When the thoughts are extended to a future ſtate, the preſent life ſeems hardly worthy of all thoſe principles of conduct, and maxims of prudence, which one generation of men has tranſmitted to another; but upon a cloſer view, when it is perceived how much evil is produced, and how much good is impeded by embarraſſment and diſtreſs, and how little room the expedients of poverty leave for the exerciſe of virtue; its ſorrows manifeſt that the boundleſs importance of the next life, enforces ſome attention to the intereſts of this.</p>
                     <p>Be kind to the old ſervants, and ſecure the kindneſs of the agents and factors; do not diſguſt them by aſperity, or unwelcome gaiety, or apparent ſuſpicion. From them you muſt learn the real ſlate of your affairs, the characters of your tenants, and the value of your lands.</p>

                     <p>HAVING paſſed almoſt this whole year in a ſucceſſion of diſorders, I went in October to Brighthelmſton, whither I came in a ſtate of ſo much weakneſs, that I reſted four times in walking between the inn and
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:0548300102:430" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 the lodging. By phyſick and abſtinence I grew better, and am now reaſonably eaſy, though at a great diſtance from health. I am afraid, however, that health begins, after ſeventy, and often long before, to have a meaning different from that which it had at thirty. But it is culpable to murmur at the eſtabliſhed order of the creation, as it is vain to oppoſe it. He that lives, muſt grow old; and he that would rather grow old than die, has GOD to thank for the infirmities of old age.</p>
                     <p>At your long ſilence I am rather angry. You do not, ſince now you are the head of your houſe, think it worth your while to try whether you or your friend can live longer without writing, nor ſuſpect after ſo many years of friendſhip, that when I do not write to you, I forget you. Put all ſuch uſeleſs jealouſies out of your head, and diſdain to regulate your own practice by the practice of another, or by any other principle than the deſire of doing right.</p>
                     <p>Your oeconomy, I ſuppoſe, begins now to be ſettled; your expences are adjuſted to your revenue, and all your people in their proper places. Reſolve not to be poor: whatever you have, ſpend leſs. Poverty is a great enemy to human happineſs, it certainly deſtroys liberty, and it makes ſome virtues impracticable, and others extremely difficult.</p>
                     <p>Let me know the hiſtory of your life, ſince your acceſſion to your eſtate. How many houſes, how many cows, how much land in your own hand, and what bargains you make with your tenants.</p>
                     <p>Of my 'Lives of the Poets,' they have printed a new edition in octavo, I hear, of three thouſand. Did I give a ſet to Lord Hailes? If I did not, I will do it out of theſe. What did you make of all your copy?</p>

The death of Mr. Thrale had made a very material alteration upon Johnſon,  with reſpect to his reception in that family. The manly authority of the huſband no longer curbed the lively exuberance of the lady; and as her vanity had been fully gratified, by having the Coloſſus of Literature attached to her for many years, ſhe gradually became leſs aſſiduous to pleaſe him. Whether her attachment to him was already divided by another object, I am unable to aſcertain; but it is plain that Johnſon's penetration was alive to her neglect or forced attention; for on the 6th of October this year, we find him making a <q rend="inline">"parting uſe of the library"</q> at Streatham, and pronouncing a prayer, which he compoſed <q rend="inline">"On leaving Mr. Thrale's family <note n="9" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 214.</note>."</q>
               </p>

                  <p>Almighty GOD, Father of all mercy, help me by thy grace, that I may, with humble and ſincere thankfulneſs, remember the comforts and conveniencies which I have enjoyed at this place; and that I may reſign them with holy ſubmiſſion, equally truſting in thy protection when Thou giveſt, and when Thou takeſt away. Have mercy upon me, O LORD, have mercy upon me.</p>
                  <p>To thy fatherly protection, O LORD, I commend this family. Bleſs, guide, and defend them, that they may ſo paſs through this world, as finally to enjoy in thy preſence everlaſting happineſs, for JESUS CHRIST'S ſake<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Amen.</p>
               </q>
               <p>One cannot read this prayer, without ſome emotions not very favourable to the lady whoſe conduct occaſioned it.</p>

Mr. Metcalfe ſhewed him great reſpect, and ſent him a note that he might have the uſe of his carriage whenever he pleaſed. Johnſon (3d October, 1782,) returned this polite anſwer:—<q rend="inline">"Mr. Johnſon is very much obliged by the kind offer of the carriage; but he has no deſire of uſing Mr. Metcalfe's carriage, except when he can have the pleaſure of Mr. Metcalfe's company."</q> Mr. Metcalfe could not but be highly pleaſed that his company was thus valued by Johnſon, and he frequently attended him in airings. They alſo went together to Cirenceſter, and they viſited Petworth and Cowdery, the venerable ſeat of the Lords Montacute. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) I ſhould like to ſtay here four-and-twenty hours.

 That his curioſity, however, was unabated, appears from two letters to Mr. John Nichols, of the 10th and 20th of October this year. In one he ſays, <q rend="inline">"I have looked into your 'Anecdotes,' and you will hardly thank a lover of literary hiſtory for telling you, that he has been much informed and gratified. I wiſh you would add your own diſcoveries and intelligence to thoſe of Dr. Rawlinſon, and undertake the Supplement to Wood.

               <p>Having given Dr. Johnſon a full account of what I was doing at Auchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leck, and particularly mentioned what I knew would pleaſe him—my having brought an old man of eighty-eight from a lonely cottage to a comfortable habitation within my encloſures, where he had good neighbours near to him, I received an anſwer in February, of which I extract what follows:</p>

               <p>On Friday, March 21, having arrived in London the night before, I was glad to find him at Mrs. Thrale's houſe, in Argyll-ſtreet, appearances of friendſhip between them being ſtill kept up.

But he ſoon aſſumed his uſual ſtrong animated ſtyle of converſation. Seeing me now for the firſt time as a <hi>Laird,</hi> or proprietor of land, he began, <q rend="inline">"Sir, the ſuperiority of a country-gentleman over the people upon his eſtate is very agreeable; and he who ſays he does not feel it to be agreeable, lies: for it muſt be agreeable to have a caſual ſuperiority over thoſe who are by nature equal with us."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Yet, Sir, we ſee great proprietors of land who prefer living in London."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, the pleaſure of living in London, the intellectual ſuperiority that is enjoyed there, may counterbalance the other. Beſides, Sir, a man may prefer the ſtate of the country-gentleman upon the whole, and yet there may never be a moment when he is willing to make the change to quit London for it."</q> He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is better to have five <hi>per cent.</hi> out of land than out of money, becauſe it is more ſecure; but the readineſs of transference, and promptneſs of intereſt, make many people rather chooſe the funds. Nay, there is another diſadvantage belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to land, compared with money. A man is not ſo much afraid of being a hard creditor as of being a hard landlord."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Becauſe there is a ſort of kindly connection between a landlord and his tenants."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; many landlords with us never ſee their tenants. It is becauſe if a landlord drives away his tenants, he may not get others; whereas the demand for money is ſo great, it may always be lent."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He talked with regret and indignation of the factious oppoſition to Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at this time, and imputed it, in a great meaſure, to the Revolution. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he, in a low voice, having come nearer to me, while his old prejudices ſeemed to be fermenting in his mind,) this Hanoverian family is <hi>iſolée</hi> here. They have no friends. Now the Stuarts had friends who ſtuck by them ſo late as 1745. When the right of the King is not reverenced, there will not be reverence for thoſe appointed by the King."</q>
               </p>
               <p>His obſervation that the preſent royal family has no friends, has been too much juſtified by the very ungrateful behaviour of many who were under great obligations to his Majeſty; at the ſame time there are honourable exceptions; and the very next year after this converſation, and ever ſince, the King has had as extenſive and generous ſupport as ever was given to any monarch, and has had the ſatisfaction of knowing that he was more and more endeared to his people.</p>
               <p>He repeated to me his verſes on Mr. Levett, with an emotion which gave them full effect; and then he was pleaſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">"You muſt be as much

               <p>He ſent a meſſage to acquaint Mrs. Thrale that I was arrived. I had not ſeen her ſince her huſband's death. She ſoon appeared, and favoured me with an invitation to ſtay to dinner, which I accepted. There was no other company but herſelf and three of her daughters, Dr. Johnſon, and I. She too, ſaid ſhe was very glad I was come, for ſhe was going to Bath, and ſhould have been ſorry to leave Dr. Johnſon before I came. This ſeemed to be attentive and kind, and I who had not been informed of any change<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> imagined all to be as well as formerly. He was little inclined to talk at dinner, and went to ſleep after it; but when he joined us in the drawing-room, he ſeemed revived, and was again himſelf.</p>
               <p>Talking of converſation, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"There muſt, in the firſt place, be knowledge, there muſt be materials;—in the ſecond place, there muſt be a command of words;—in the third place, there muſt be imagination, to place things in ſuch views as they are not commonly ſeen in;—and in the fourth place, there muſt be preſence of mind, and a reſolution that is not to be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by failures; this laſt is an eſſential requiſite; for want of it many people do not excel in converſation. Now <hi>I</hi> want it, I throw up the game upon loſing a trick."</q> I wondered to hear him talk thus of himſelf, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I don't know, Sir, how this may be, but I am ſure you beat other people's cards out of their hands."</q> I doubt whether he heard this remark. While he went on talking triumphantly, I was fixed in admiration, and ſaid to Mrs. Thrale, <q rend="inline">"O, for ſhort-hand to take this down."</q>—<q rend="inline">"You'll carry it all in your head, (ſaid ſhe;) a long head is as good as ſhort-hand."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It has been obſerved and wondered at, that Mr. Charles Fox never talked with any freedom in the preſence of Dr. Johnſon, though it is well known, and I myſelf can witneſs, that his converſation is various, fluent, and exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly agreeable. Johnſon's experience, however, founded him in going on thus: <q rend="inline">"Fox never talks in private company, not from any determination not to talk, but becauſe he has not the firſt motion. A man who is uſed to the applauſe of the Houſe of Commons, has no wiſh for that of a private company. A man accuſtomed to throw for a thouſand pounds, if ſet down to throw for ſixpence, would not be at the pains to count his dice. Burke's talk is the ebullition of his mind; he does not talk from a deſire of diſtinction, but becauſe his mind is full."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He thus curiouſly characteriſed one of our old acquaintance: <q rend="inline">"******** is a good man, Sir; but he is a vain man, and a liar. He, however, only
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:0548300102:436" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 tells lies of vanity; of victories, for inſtance, in converſation which never happened."</q> This alluded to a ſtory which I had repeated from that gentleman, to entertain Johnſon with its wild bravado: <q rend="inline">"This Johnſon, Sir, (ſaid he,) whom you are all afraid of, will ſhrink if you come cloſe to him in argument, and roar as loud as he. He once maintained the paradox, that there is no beauty but in utility. 'Sir, (ſaid I,) what ſay you to the peacock's tail, which is one of the moſt beautiful objects in nature, but would have as much utility if its feathers were all of one colour.' He <hi>felt</hi> what I thus produced, and had recourſe to his uſual expedient, ridicule; exclaiming, 'A peacock has a tail, and a fox has a tail;' and then he burſt out into a laugh. 'Well, Sir, (ſaid I, with a ſtrong voice, looking him full in the face) you have unkennelled your fox; purſue him if you dare.' He had not a word to ſay, Sir."</q> Johnſon told me that this was a fiction from beginning to end. <note n="1" place="bottom">Were I to inſert all the ſtories which have been told of conteſts boldly maintained with him, imaginary victories obtained over him, of reducing him to ſilence, and of making him own that his antagoniſts had the better of him in argument, my volumes would ſwell to an immoderate ſize. One inſtance, I find, has circulated both in converſation and in print; that when he would not allow the Scotch writers to have merit, the late Dr. Roſe, of Chiſwick, aſſerted, that he could name one Scotch writer, who Dr. Johnſon himſelf would allow to have written better than any man of the age; and upon Johnſon's aſking who it was, anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Lord Bute, when he ſigned the warrant for your penſion."</q> Upon which Johnſon, ſtruck with the repartee, acknowledged that this <hi>was</hi> true. When I mentioned it to Johnſon, <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid he,) if Roſe ſaid this, I never heard it."</q>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>After muſing for ſome time, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I wonder how I ſhould have any enemies; for I do harm to nobody <note n="2" place="bottom">This reflection was very natural in a man of a good heart, who was not conſcious of any ill-will to mankind, though the ſharp ſayings which were ſometimes produced by his diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and vivacity, and which he perhaps did not recollect, were, I am afraid, too often remembered with reſentment.</note>."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"In the firſt place, Sir, you will be pleaſed to recollect, that you ſet out with attacking the Scotch; ſo you got a whole nation for your enemies."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why I own, that by my definition of <hi>oats</hi> I meant to vex them."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, can you trace the cauſe of your antipathy to the Scotch."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I can not, Sir."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Old Mr. Sheridan ſays, it was becauſe they ſold Charles the Firſt."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, old Mr. Sheridan has found out a very good reaſon."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Surely the moſt obſtinate and ſulky nationality, the moſt determined averſion to this great and good man, muſt be cured, when he is ſeen thus playing with one of his prejudices, of which he candidly admitted that he
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:0548300102:437" rendition="simple:additions"/>
could not tell the reaſon. It was, however, probably owing to his having  had in his view the worſt part of the Scottiſh nation, the needy adventurers, many of whom he thought were advanced beyond their merits, by means which he did not approve. Had he in his early life been in Scotland, and ſeen the worthy, ſenſible, independent gentlemen, who live rationally and hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably at home, he never could have entertained ſuch unfavourable and unjuſt notions of his fellow-ſubjects. And accordingly we find, that when he did viſit Scotland, in the latter period of his life, he was fully ſenſible of all that it deſerved, as I have already pointed out, when ſpeaking of his <q rend="inline">"Journey to the Weſtern Iſlands."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Next day, Saturday, March 22, I found him ſtill at Mrs. Thrale's, but he told me that he was to go to his own houſe in the afternoon. He was better, but I perceived he was but an unruly patient, for Dr. Pepys, who viſited him, while I was with him ſaid, <q rend="inline">"If you were <hi>tractable,</hi> Sir, I ſhould preſcribe for you."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I related to him a remark which a reſpectable friend had made to me, upon the then ſtate of Government, when thoſe who had been long in oppoſition had attained to power, it was ſuppoſed againſt the inclination of the Sovereign. <q rend="inline">"You need not be uneaſy (ſaid this gentleman) about the King. He laughs at them all; he plays them one againſt another."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Don't think ſo, Sir. The King is as much oppreſſed as a man can be. If he plays them one againſt another he <hi>wins</hi> nothing."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I had paid a viſit to General Oglethorpe in the morning, and was told by him that Dr. Johnſon ſaw company on Saturday evenings, and he would meet me at Johnſon's, that night. When I mentioned this to Johnſon, not doubting that it would pleaſe him, as he had a great value for Oglethorpe, the ſretfulneſs of his diſeaſe unexpectedly ſhewed itſelf; his anger ſuddenly kindled, and he ſaid, with vehemence, <q rend="inline">"Did not you tell him not to come? Am I to be <hi>hunted</hi> in this manner?"</q> I ſatisfied him that I could not divine that the viſit would not be convenient, and that I certainly could not take it upon me of my own accord, to forbid the General.</p>
               <p>I found Dr. Johnſon in the evening in Mrs. Williams's room, at tea and coffee with her and Mrs. Deſmoulins, who were alſo both ill; it was a ſad ſcene, and he was not in a very good humour. He ſaid of a performance that had lately come out, <q rend="inline">"Sir, if you ſhould ſearch all the mad-houſes in England, you would not find ten men who would write ſo, and think it ſenſe."</q>
               </p>

 I was glad when General Oglethorpe's arrival was announced; and we left the ladies. Dr. Johnſon attended him in the parlour, and was as courteous as ever. The General ſaid he was buſy reading the writers of the middle age. Johnſon ſaid they were very curious. OGLETHORPE. <q rend="inline">"The Houſe of Commons has uſurped the power of the nation's money, and uſed it tyranni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally. Government is now carried on by corrupt influence, inſtead of the inherent right in the King."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, the want of inherent right in the King occaſions all this diſturbance. What we did at the Revolution was neceſſary: but it broke our conſtitution <note n="3" place="bottom">I have, in my <q rend="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</q> fully expreſſed my ſentiments upon this ſubject. The Revolution was <hi>neceſſary,</hi> but not a ſubject for <hi>glory;</hi> becauſe it for a long time blaſted the generous feelings of <hi>Loyalty.</hi> And now, when by the benignant effect of time the preſent Royal Family are eſtabliſhed in our <hi>affections,</hi> how unwiſe is it to revive by celebrations the memory of a ſhock, which it would ſurely have been better that our conſtitution had not required.</note>."</q> OGLETHORPE. <q rend="inline">"My father did not think it neceſſary."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Sunday, March 23, I breakfaſted with Dr. Johnſon, who ſeemed much relieved, having taken opium the night before. He however proteſted againſt it, as a remedy that ſhould be given with the utmoſt reluctance, and only in extreme neceſſity. I mentioned how commonly it was uſed in Turkey, and therefore it could not be ſo pernicious as he apprehended. He grew warm, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Turks take opium, and Chriſtians take opium; but Ruſſel, in his account of Aleppo, tells us, that it is as diſgraceful in Turkey to take too much opium, as it is with us to get drunk. Sir, it is amazing how things are exaggerated. A gentleman was lately telling in a company where I was preſent, that in France, as ſoon as a man of faſhion marries, he takes an opera girl into keeping; and this he mentioned as a general cuſtom. Pray, Sir, (ſaid I,) how many opera girls may there be? He anſwered, 'About fourſcore.' Well then, Sir, (ſaid I,) you ſee there can be no more than four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcore men of faſhion who can do this."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Deſmoulins made tea; and ſhe and I talked before him upon a topick which he had once borne patiently from me, when we were by our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves—his not complaining of the world, becauſe he was not called to ſome great office, nor had attained to great wealth. He flew into a violent paſſion, I confeſs with ſome juſtice, and commanded us to have done. <q rend="inline">"Nobody (ſaid he) has a right to talk in this manner, to bring before a man his own character, and the events of his life, when he does not chooſe it ſhould be done. I never have ſought the world; the world was not to ſeek me. It is
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:0548300102:439" rendition="simple:additions"/>
rather wonderful that ſo much has been done for me. All the complaints  which are made of the world are unjuſt. I never knew a man of merit neglected. It was generally by his own fault that he failed of ſucceſs. A man may hide his head in a hole. He may go into the country, and publiſh a book now and then, which nobody reads, and then complain he is neglected. There is no reaſon why any perſon ſhould exert himſelf for a man who has written a good book. He has not written it for any individual. I may as well make a preſent to the poſt-man who brings me a letter. When patronage was limited, an authour expected to find a Mecaenas, and complained if he did not find one. Why ſhould he complain? This Mecaenas has others as good as he, or others who have got the ſtart of him."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But ſurely, Sir, you will allow that there are many men of merit at the bar who never get practice."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you are ſure that practice is got from an opinion that the perſon employed deſerves it beſt; ſo that if a man of merit at the bar does not get practice, it is from errour, not from injuſtice. He is not neglected. A horſe that is brought to market may not be bought, though he is a very good horſe: but that is from ignorance, not from intention."</q>
               </p>
               <p>There was in this diſcourſe much novelty, ingenuity, and diſcrimination, ſuch as is ſeldom to be found. Yet I cannot help thinking that men of merit, who have no ſucceſs in life, may be forgiven for <hi>lamenting,</hi> if they are not allowed to <hi>complain.</hi> They may conſider it as <hi>hard</hi> that their merit ſhould not have its ſuitable diſtinction. If there is no internal injuſtice towards them on the part of the world, becauſe their merit has not been perceived, they may repine againſt <hi>fortune,</hi> or <hi>fate,</hi> or by whatever name they chooſe to call the ſuppoſed mythological power of <hi>Deſtiny.</hi> It has, however, occurred to me, as a conſolatory thought, that men of merit ſhould conſider thus:—How much harder would it be if the ſame men had both all the merit and all the proſperity? Would not this be a miſerable diſtribution for the poor dunces? Would men of merit exchange their intellectual ſuperiority, and the enjoyments ariſing from it, for external diſtinction, and the pleaſures of wealth? If they would not, let them not envy others, who are poor where they are rich, a compenſation which is made to them. Let them look inwards and be ſatisfied; recollecting with conſcious pride what Virgil finely ſays of the <hi>Corycius Senex,</hi> and which I have, in another place <note n="4" place="bottom">Letter to the People of Scotland againſt the Attempt to diminiſh the Number of the Lords of Seſſion. 1785.</note>, with truth and ſincerity applied to Mr. Burke:
<q>
                     <l>"Regum aequabat opes animis."</l>
                  </q>

 On the ſubject of the right employment of wealth, Johnſon obſerved, <q rend="inline">"A man cannot make a bad uſe of his money, ſo far as regards Society, if he does not hoard it. For if he either ſpends it or lends it out, Society has the benefit. It is in general better to ſpend money than to give it away; for induſtry is more promoted by ſpending money, than by giving it away. A man who ſpends his money is ſure he is doing good with it: he is not ſo ſure when he gives it away. A man who ſpends ten thouſand a year will do more good than a man who ſpends two thouſand and gives away eight."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In the evening I came to him again. He was rather fretful from his illneſs. A gentleman aſked him, whether he had been abroad to-day. <q rend="inline">"Don't talk ſo childiſhly, (ſaid he). You may as well aſk if I hanged my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to-day."</q> I mentioned politicks. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I'd as ſoon have a man to break my bones as talk to me of publick affairs, internal or external. I have lived to ſee things all as bad as they can be."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having mentioned his friend the ſecond Lord Southwell, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Lord Southwell was the higheſt bred man without inſolence that I ever was in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with; the moſt <hi>qualified</hi> I ever ſaw. Lord Orrery was not dignified: Lord Cheſterfield was, but he was inſolent. Lord ********* is a man of coarſe manners, but a man of abilities and information. I don't ſay he is a man I would ſet at the head of a nation, though perhaps he may be as good as the next Prime Miniſter that comes. But he is a man to be at the head of a Club;—I don't ſay <hi>our</hi> CLUB;—for there's no ſuch Club."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, was not he once a factious man?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"O yes, Sir; as factious a fellow as could be found: one who was for ſinking us all into the mob."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"How then, Sir, did he get into favour with the King?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Becauſe, Sir, I ſuppoſe he promiſed the King to do whatever the King pleaſed."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Goldſmith's blundering ſpeech to Lord Shelburne, which has been ſo often mentioned, and which he really did make to him, was only a blunder in emphaſis:—'I wonder they ſhould call your Lordſhip <hi>Malagrida,</hi> for Malagrida was a very good man;'—meant, I wonder they ſhould uſe <hi>Malagrida</hi> as a term of reproach."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Soon after this time I had an opportunity of ſeeing, by means of one of his friends, a proof that his talents, as well as his obliging ſervice to authours, were ready as ever. He had reviſed <q rend="inline">"The Village,"</q> an admirable poem, by the Reverend Mr. Crabbe. Its ſentiments as to the falſe notions of ruſtick happineſs and ruſtick virtue, were quite congenial with his own; and he had taken the trouble not only to ſuggeſt ſlight corrections and variations, but to
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:0548300102:441" rendition="simple:additions"/>
furniſh ſome lines, when he thought he could give the writer's meaning better  than in the words of the manuſcript <note n="5" place="bottom">

               <p>On Sunday, March 30, I found him at home in the evening, and had the pleaſure to meet with Dr. Brockleſby, whoſe reading, and knowledge of life, and good ſpirits, ſupply him with a never-failing ſource of converſation. He mentioned a reſpectable gentleman, who became extremely penurious near the cloſe of his life. Johnſon ſaid there muſt have been a degree of madneſs about him. <q rend="inline">"Not at all Sir, (ſaid Dr. Brockleſby,) his judgement was entire."</q> Unluckily, however, he mentioned that although he had a fortune of twenty-ſeven thouſand pounds, he denied himſelf many comforts, from an apprehenſion that he could not afford them. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, (cried Johnſon,) when the judgement is ſo diſturbed that a man cannot count, that is pretty well."</q>

               <p>I ſhall here inſert a few of Johnſon's ſayings, without the formality of dates, as they have no reference to any particular time or place.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"The more a man extends and varies his acquaintance the better."</q> This, however, was meant with a juſt reſtriction; for, he on another occaſion ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"Sir, a man may be ſo much of every thing, that he is nothing of any thing."</q>

               <p>

                  <q rend="inline">"It is a very good cuſtom to keep a journal for a man's own uſe; he may write upon a card a day all that is neceſſary to be written, after he has had experience of life. At firſt there is a great deal to be written, becauſe there is a great deal of novelty. But when once a man has ſettled his opinions, there is ſeldom much to be ſet down."</q>

               <p>I praiſed the accuracy of an account book of a private perſon whom I mentioned. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Keeping accounts, Sir, is of no uſe when a man is ſpending his own money, and has nobody to whom he is to account. You won't eat leſs beef to-day, becauſe you have written down what it coſt yeſterday."</q> I mentioned a lady who thought as he did, ſo that her huſband could not get her to keep an account of the expence of the family, as ſhe thought it enough that ſhe never exceeded the ſum allowed her. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is fit ſhe ſhould keep an account, becauſe her huſband wiſhes it; but I do not ſee its uſe."</q> I maintained that keeping an account has this advantage, that it ſatisfies a man that his money has not been loſt or ſtolen, which he might ſometimes be apt to imagine, were there no written ſtate of his expence; and beſides, a calculation of oeconomy ſo as not to exceed one's income, cannot be made without a view of the different articles in figures, that one may ſee how to retrench in ſome particulars leſs neceſſary than others. This he did not attempt to anſwer.</p>
               <p>Talking of an acquaintance of ours, whoſe narratives, which abounded in curious and intereſting topicks, were unhappily found to be very fabulous; I mentioned Lord Mansfield's having ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"Suppoſe we believe one <hi>half</hi> of what he tells."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Aye; but we don't know <hi>which</hi> half to believe. By his lying we loſe not only our reverence for him, but all comfort in his converſation."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"May we not take it as amuſing fiction?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, the misfortune is, that you will inſenſibly believe as much of it as you incline."</q>

               <p>It is remarkable, that notwithſtanding their congeniality in politicks, he never was acquainted with a late eminent noble judge, whom I have heard ſpeak of him as a writer, with great reſpect.

Talking of him to me one day, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is wonderful, Sir, with how little real ſuperiority of mind men can make an eminent figure in publick life."</q> He expreſſed himſelf to the ſame purpoſe concerning another law Lord, who, it ſeems, once took a fancy to aſſociate with the wits

of London; but with ſo little ſucceſs, that Foote ſaid, <q rend="inline">"What can he mean  by coming among us? He is not only dull himſelf, but the cauſe of dullneſs in others."</q> Trying him by the teſt of his colloquial powers, Johnſon had found him very defective. He once ſaid to Sir Joſhua Reynolds, <q rend="inline">"This man now has been ten years about town, and has made nothing of it;"</q> meaning as a companion <note n="6" place="bottom">Knowing as well as I do, what preciſion and elegance of oratory his Lordſhip can diſplay, I cannot but ſuſpect that his unfavourable appearance in a ſocial circle, which drew ſuch animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions upon him, muſt be owing to a cold affectation of conſequence, from being reſerved and ſtiff. If it be ſo, and he might be an agreeable man if he would, we cannot be ſorry that he miſſes his aim.</note>. He ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"I never heard any thing from him in company that was at all ſtriking; and depend upon it, Sir, it is when you come cloſe to a man in converſation, that you diſcover what his real abilities are; to make a ſpeech in a publick aſſembly is a knack. Now I honour Thurlow, Sir; Thurlow is a fine fellow; he fairly puts his mind to yours."</q>
               </p>
               <p>After repeating to him ſome of his pointed lively ſayings, I ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is a pity, Sir, you don't always remember your own good things, that you may have a laugh when you will."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, it is better that I forget them, that I may be reminded of them and have a laugh brought to my recollection."</q>
               </p>
               <p>When I recalled his having ſaid as we ſailed upon Lochlomond, <q rend="inline">"That if he wore any thing fine, it ſhould be <hi>very</hi> fine;"</q> I obſerved that all his thoughts were upon a great ſcale. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Depend upon it, Sir, every man will have as fine a thing as he can get; as a large diamond for his ring."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Pardon me, Sir; a man of a narrow mind will not think of it, a ſliight trinket will ſatisfy him.<q>

               <p>On Thurſday, April 10, I introduced to him, at his houſe in Bolt-court, the Honourable and Reverend William Stuart, ſon of the Earl of Bute; a gentleman truly worthy of being known to Johnſon, being, with all the advantages of high birth, learning, travel, and elegant manners, an exemplary pariſh prieſt in every reſpect.</p>

 After ſome compliments on both ſides, the tour which Johnſon and I had made to the Hebrides was mentioned.—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I got an acquiſition of more ideas by it than by any thing that I remember. I ſaw quite a different ſyſtem of life."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"You would not like to make the ſame journey again."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why no, Sir; not the ſame: it is a tale told. <hi>Gravina,</hi> an Italian critick, obſerves, that every man deſires to ſee that of which he has read; but no man deſires to read an account of what he has ſeen. So much does deſcription fall ſhort of reality. Deſcription only excites curioſity: ſeeing ſatisfies it. Other people may go and ſee the Hebrides."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I ſhould wiſh to go and ſee ſome country totally different from what I have been uſed to; ſuch as Turkey, where religion and every thing elſe are different."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; there are two objects of curioſity—the Chriſtian world and the Mahometan world. All the reſt may be conſidered as barbarous."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, is the 'Turkiſh Spy' a genuine book?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir. Mrs. Manley, in her Life, ſays, that her father wrote the two firſt volumes. And in another book, 'Dunton's Life and Errours,' we find that the reſt was written by one <hi>Sault,</hi> at two guineas a ſheet, under the direction of Dr. Midgeley."</q>
               </p>
               <p>BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"This has been a very factious reign, owing to the too great indulgence of Government."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"<hi>I</hi> think ſo, Sir. What at firſt was lenity, grew timidity. Yet this is reaſoning <hi>à poſteriori,</hi> and may not be juſt. Suppoſing a few had at firſt been puniſhed, I believe faction would have been cruſhed; but it might have been ſaid, that it was a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary reign. A man cannot tell <hi>à priori</hi> what will be beſt for Government to do. This reign has been very unfortunate. We have had an unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful war; but that does not prove that we have been ill governed. One ſide or other muſt prevail in war, as one or other muſt win at play. When we beat Louis, we were not better governed; nor were the French better governed when Louis beat us."</q>

               <p>On Saturday, April 12, I viſited him, in company with Mr. Windham, of Norfolk, whom, though a Whig, he highly valued. One of the beſt things he ever ſaid was to this gentleman; who, before he ſet out for Ireland as Secretary to Lord Northington, when Lord Lieutenant, expreſſed to the Sage ſome modeſt and virtuous doubts, whether he could bring himſelf to practiſe thoſe arts which it is ſuppoſed a perſon in that ſituation has occaſion to employ. <q rend="inline">"Don't be afraid, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon, with a pleaſant ſmile,) you will ſoon make a very pretty raſcal."</q>

He talked to-day a good deal of the wonderful extent and variety of London,  and obſerved, that men of curious enquiry might ſee in it ſuch modes of life as very few could even imagine. He in particular recommended to us to <hi>explore Wapping,</hi> which we reſolved to do, and certainly ſhall.</p>
               <p>Mr. Lowe the painter, who was with him, was very much diſtreſſed that a large picture which he had painted was refuſed to be received into the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of the Royal Academy. Mrs. Thrale knew Johnſon's character ſo ſuperficially, as to repreſent him as unwilling to do ſmall acts of benevolence; and mentions, in particular, that he would hardly take the trouble to write a letter in favour of his friends. The truth, however, is, that he was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, in an extraordinary degree, for what ſhe denies to him; and, above all, for this very ſort of kindneſs, writing letters for thoſe to whom his ſolicitations might be of ſervice. He now gave Mr. Lowe the following, of which I was diligent enough, with his permiſſion, to take copies at the next coffee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe, while Mr. Windham was ſo good as to ſtay by me.</p>

               <p>Such interceſſion was too powerful to be reſiſted, and Mr. Lowe's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance was admitted at Somerſet-houſe. The ſubject, as I recollect, was the Deluge, at that point of time when the water was verging to the top of the laſt uncovered mountain. Near to the ſpot was ſeen the laſt of the antediluvian race, excluſive of thoſe who were ſaved in the ark of Noah. This was one of thoſe giants, then the inhabitants of the earth, who had ſtill ſtrength to ſwim, and with one of his hands held aloft his infant child. Upon the ſmall remaining dry ſpot appeared a famiſhed lion, ready to ſpring at the child and devour it. Mr. Lowe told me that Johnſon ſaid to him, <q rend="inline">"Sir, yonr picture is noble and probable."</q>—<q rend="inline">"A compliment, indeed, (ſaid Mr. Lowe,) from a man who cannot lie, and cannot be miſtaken."</q>
               </p>
               <p>About this time he wrote to Mrs. Lucy Porter, mentioning his bad health, and that he intended a viſit to Lichfield. <q rend="inline">"It is (ſays he) with no great expectation of amendment that I make every year a journey into the country; but it is pleaſant to viſit thoſe whoſe kindneſs has been often experienced."</q>

               <p>On April 18, (being Good-Friday,) I found him at breakfaſt, in his uſual manner upon that day, drinking tea without milk, and eating a croſs-bun to prevent faintneſs; we went to St. Clement's church, as formerly. When we came home from church he placed himſelf on one of the ſtone ſeats at his garden-door, and I took the other, and thus in the open air and in a placid frame, he talked away very eaſily. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Were I a country gentleman, I ſhould not be very hoſpitable, I ſhould not have crowds in my houſe."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Sir Alexander Dick tells me, that he remembers having a thouſand people in a year to dine at his houſe; that is reckoning each perſon one each time that he dined there."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That, Sir, is about three a day."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"How your ſtatement leſſens the idea."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That, Sir, is the good of counting.

And if there is a large family the poor entertain thoſe three, for they eat what the poor would get; there muſt be ſuperfluous meat; it muſt be given to the poor, or thrown out."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I obſerve in London, that the poor go about and gather bones, which I underſtand are manufactured.</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; they boil them, and extract a greaſe from them for greaſing wheels and other purpoſes. Of the beſt pieces they make a mock ivory, which is uſed for hafts to knives, and various other things. The coarſer pieces they burn and pound them, and ſell the aſhes."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"For what purpoſe, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, for making a furnace for the chymiſts for melting iron. A paſte made of burnt bones will ſtand a ſtronger heat than any thing elſe. Conſider, Sir, if you are to melt iron, you cannot line your pot with braſs, becauſe it is ſofter than iron and would melt ſooner; nor with iron, for though malleable iron is harder than caſt iron, yet it would not do; but a paſte of burnt bones will not melt."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Do you know, Sir, I have diſcovered a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture to a great extent, of what you only piddle at—ſcraping and drying the peel of oranges. At a place in Newgate-ſtreet, there is a prodigious quantity done, which they ſell to the diſtillers."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I believe they make a higher thing out of them than a ſpirit; they make what is called orange-butter, the oil of the orange inſpiſſated, which they mix perhaps with common pomatum, and make it fragrant. The oil does not fly off in the drying."</q>
               </p>
               <p>BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I wiſh to have a good walled garden."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I don't think it would be worth the expence to you. We compute in England, a park-wall at a thouſand pounds a mile; now a garden-wall muſt coſt at leaſt as much. You intend your trees ſhould grow higher than a deer will leap. Now let us ſee—for a hundred pounds you could only have forty-four ſquare yards, which is very little; for two hundred pounds, you may have eighty-four ſquare yards, which is very well. But when will you get the value of two hundred pounds of walls in your climate? No, Sir, ſuch contention with nature is not worth while. I would plant an orchard, and have plenty of ſuch fruit as ripen well in your country. My friend, Dr. Madan, of Ireland, ſaid, that in an orchard there ſhould be enough to eat, enough to lay up, enough to be ſtolen, and enough to rot upon the ground. Cherries are an early fruit, you may have them; and you may have the early apples and
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:0548300102:448" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 pears."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"We cannot have nonpareils."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you can no more have nonpareils than you can have grapes."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"We have them, Sir; but they are very bad."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, never try to have a thing merely to ſhew that you <hi>cannot</hi> have it. For ground that would let for forty ſhillings you may have a large orchard; and you ſee it coſts you only forty ſhillings. Nay, you may graze the ground when the trees are grown up, you cannot while they are young."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Is not a good garden a very common thing in England, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Not ſo common, Sir, as you imagine. In Lincolnſhire there is hardly an orchard; in Staffordſhire very little fruit."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Has Langton no orchard?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"How ſo, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, from the general negligence of the county. He has it not, becauſe nobody elſe has it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"A hot-houſe is a certain thing; I may have that."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"A hot-houſe is pretty certain; but you muſt firſt build it, then you muſt keep fires in it, and you muſt have a gardener to take care of it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But if I have a gardener at any rate."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, yes."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I'd have it near my houſe; there is no need to have it in the orchard."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">Yes, I'd have it near my houſe—I would plant a great many currants; the fruit is good, and they make a pretty ſweetmeat."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I record this minute detail, which ſome may think trifling, in order to ſhew clearly how this great man, whoſe mind could graſp ſuch large and extenſive ſubjects as he has ſhewn in his literary labours, was yet well-informed in the common affairs of life, and loved to illuſtrate them.</p>
               <p>Mr. Walker, the celebrated maſter of elocution came, and then we went up ſtairs into the ſtudy. I aſked him if he had taught many clergymen. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I hope not."</q> WALKER. <q rend="inline">"I have taught only one, and he is the beſt reader I ever heard, not by my teaching, but by his own natural talents."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Were he the beſt reader in the world, I would not have it told that he was taught."</q> Here was one of his peculiar prejudices. Could it be any diſadvantage to the clergyman, to have it known that he was taught an eaſy and graceful delivery? BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Will you not allow, Sir, that a man may be taught to read well?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, ſo far as to read better than he might do without being taught, yes. Formerly it was ſuppoſed that there was no difference in reading, but that one read as well as another."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"It is wonderful to ſee old Sheridan as enthuſiaſtick about oratory as ever."</q> WALKER. <q rend="inline">"His enthuſiaſm as to what oratory will do may be too great. But he reads well."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"He
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:0548300102:449" rendition="simple:additions"/>
reads well, but he reads low; and you know it is much eaſier to read low  than to read high; for when you read high you are much more limited, your loudeſt note can be but one, and ſo in proportion to loudneſs. Now ſome people have occaſion to ſpeak to an extenſive audience, and muſt ſpeak loud to be heard."</q> WALKER. <q rend="inline">"The art is to read ſtrong, though low."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of the origin of language—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It muſt have come by inſpiration. A thouſand, nay a million of children could not invent a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. While the organs are pliable, there is not underſtanding enough to form a language: by the time that there is underſtanding enough, the organs are become ſtiff. We know that after a certain age we cannot learn to pronounce a new language. No foreigner, who comes to England when advanced in life, ever pronounces Engliſh tolerably well; at leaſt ſuch inſtances are very rare. When I maintain that language muſt have come by inſpiration, I do not mean that inſpiration is required for rhetorick, and all the beauties of language; for when once man has language, we can conceive that he may gradually form modifications of it. I mean only, that inſpiration ſeems to me to be neceſſary to give man the faculty of ſpeech; to inform him that he may have ſpeech; which I think he could no more find out without inſpiration, than cows or hogs would think of ſuch a faculty."</q> WALKER. <q rend="inline">"Do you think, Sir, that there are any perfect ſynonimes in any language?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Originally there were not; but by uſing words negligently, or in poetry, one word comes to be confounded with another."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He talked of Dr. Dodd. <q rend="inline">"A friend of mine (ſaid he) came to me and told me, that a lady wiſhed to have Dodd's picture in a bracelet, and aſked me for a motto. I ſaid, I could think of no better than <hi>Currat Lex.</hi> I was very willing to have him pardoned, that is, to have the ſentence changed to tranſportation: but, when he was once hanged, I did not wiſh he ſhould be made a ſaint."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Burney, wife of his friend Dr. Burney, came in, and he ſeemed to be entertained with her converſation.</p>
               <p>Garrick's funeral was talked of as extravagantly expenſive. Johnſon, from his diſlike to exaggeration, would not allow that it was diſtinguiſhed by any extraordinary pomp. <q rend="inline">"Were there not ſix horſes in each coach?"</q> ſaid Mrs. Burney. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Madam, there were no more ſix horſes than ſix phoenixes."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Burney wondered that ſome very beautiful new buildings ſhould be erected in Moorfields, in ſo ſhocking a ſituation as between Bedlam and St. Luke's Hoſpital; and ſaid, ſhe could not live there. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay,
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:0548300102:450" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Madam, you ſee nothing there to hurt you. You no more think of mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by having windows that look to Bedlam, than you think of death by having windows that look to a church-yard."</q> MRS. BURNEY. <q rend="inline">"We may look to a church-yard, Sir; for it is right that we ſhould be kept in mind of death."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Madam, if you go to that it is right that we ſhould be kept in mind of madneſs, which is occaſioned by too much indulgence of imagination. I think a very moral uſe may be made of theſe new buildings. I would have thoſe who have heated imaginations live there, and take warning."</q> MRS. BURNEY. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, many of the poor people that are mad have become ſo from diſeaſe, or from diſtreſſing events. It is, therefore, not their faults, but their misfortune; and, therefore, to think of them, is a melancholy conſideration."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Time paſſed on in converſation till it was too late for the ſervice of the church at three o'clock. I took a walk, and left him alone for ſome time; then returned, and we had coffee and converſation again by ourſelves.</p>
               <p>I ſtated the character of a noble friend of mine, as a curious caſe for his opinion:—<q rend="inline">"He is the moſt inexplicable man to me that I ever knew. Can you explain him, Sir? He is, I really believe, noble-minded, generous, and princely. But his moſt intimate friends may be ſeparated from him for years, without his ever aſking a queſtion concerning them. He will meet them with a formality, a coldneſs, a ſtately indifference; but when they come cloſe to him, and fairly engage him in converſation, they find him as eaſy, pleaſant, and kind as they could wiſh. One then ſuppoſes that what is ſo agreeable will ſoon be renewed; but ſtay away from him for half a year, and he will neither call on you, nor ſend to inquire about you."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I cannot aſcertain his character exactly, as I do not know him; but I ſhould not like to have ſuch a man for my friend. He may love ſtudy, and wiſh not to be interrupted by his friends; <hi>Amici fures temporis.</hi> He may be a frivolous man, and be ſo much occupied with petty purſuits, that he may not want friends. Or he may have a notion that there is a dignity in appearing indifferent, while he in fact may not be more indifferent at his heart than another."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We went to evening prayers at St. Clement's, at ſeven, and then parted.</p>
               <p>On Sunday, April 20, being Eaſter-day, after attending ſolemn ſervice at St. Paul's, I came to Dr. Johnſon, and found Mr. Lowe, the painter, ſitting with him. Mr. Lowe mentioned the great number of new buildings of late in London, yet that Dr. Johnſon had obſerved, that the number of inhabitants was not increaſed. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, the bills of mortality prove that
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:0548300102:451"/>
no more people die now than formerly; ſo it is plain no more live. Births  are nothing, for not one tenth of the people of London are born there."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I believe, Sir, a great many of the children born in London die early."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But thoſe who do live are as ſtout and ſtrong people as any. Dr. Price ſays, they muſt be naturally ſtronger to get through."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That is ſyſtem, Sir. A great traveller obſerves, that it is ſaid there are no weak or deformed people among the Indians; but he with much ſagacity aſſigns the reaſon of this, which is, that the hardſhip of their life as hunters and fiſhers, does not allow weak or diſeaſed children to grow up. Now had I been an Indian I muſt have died early, my eyes would not have ſerved me to get food. I indeed now could fiſh, give me Engliſh tackle; but had I been an Indian I muſt have ſtarved, or they would have knocked me on the head when they ſaw I could do nothing."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Perhaps they would have taken care of you; we are told they are fond of oratory, you would have talked to them."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, I ſhould not have lived long enough to be fit to talk; I ſhould have been dead before I was ten years old. Depend upon it, Sir, a ſavage when he is hungry will not carry about with him a looby of nine years old, who cannot help himſelf. They have no affection, Sir."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I believe natural affection of which we hear ſo much, is very ſmall."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, natural affection is nothing. But affection from principle and eſtabliſhed duty is ſometimes wonderfully ſtrong."</q> LOWE. <q rend="inline">"A hen, Sir, will feed her chickens in preference to herſelf."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But we don't know that the hen is hungry; let the hen be fairly hungry, and I'll warrant ſhe'll peck the corn herſelf. A cock, I believe, will feed hens inſtead of himſelf; but we don't know that the cock is hungry."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"And that, Sir, is not from affection but gallantry. But ſome of the Indians have affection."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, that they help ſome of their children is plain; for ſome of them live which could not do without being helped."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I dined with him; the company were, Mrs. Williams, Mrs. Deſmoulins, and Mr. Lowe. He ſeemed not to be well, talked little, grew drowſy ſoon after dinner and retired, upon which I went away.</p>
               <p>Having next day gone to Mr. Burke's ſeat in the country, from whence I was recalled by an expreſs, that a near relation of mine had killed his antagoniſt in a duel, and was himſelf dangerouſly wounded, I ſaw little of Dr. Johnſon till Monday, April 28, when I ſpent a conſiderable part of the
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:0548300102:452" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 day with him, and introduced the ſubject, which chiefly occupied my mind. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I do not ſee, Sir, that fighting is abſolutely forbidden in Scripture; I ſee revenge forbidden, but not ſelf-defence."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"The Quakers ſay it is; <q rend="inline">"Unto him that ſmiteth thee on one cheek, offer alſo the other."</q>
                  </q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But ſtay, Sir, the text is meant only to have the effect of moderating paſſion; it is plain that we are not to take it in a literal ſenſe. We ſee this from the context, where there are other recommendations, which I warrant you the Quaker will not take literally, as for inſtance, 'From him that would borrow of thee, turn thou not away.' Let a man whoſe credit is bad come to a Quaker, and ſay, 'Well, Sir, lend me a hundred pounds;' he'll find him as unwilling as any other man. No, Sir, a man may ſhoot the man who invades his character, as he may ſhoot him who attempts to break into his houſe."</q> So in 1745, my friend, Tom Cumming, the Quaker, ſaid, he would not fight, but he would drive an ammunition-cart; and we know that the Quakers have ſent flannel waiſtcoats to our ſoldiers, to enable them to fight better BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"When a man is the aggreſſor, and by ill-uſage forces on a duel in which he is killed, have we not little ground to hope that he is gone into a ſtate of happineſs?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, we are not to judge determinately of the ſtate in which a man leaves this life. He may in a moment have repented effectually, and it is poſſible may have been accepted by GOD. There is in 'Camden's Remains,' an epitaph upon a very wicked man, who was killed by a fail from his horſe, in which he is ſuppoſed to ſay,
<q>
                        <l>'Between the ſtirrup and the ground,</l>
                        <l>'I mercy aſked, I mercy found."</l>
                     </q>
                  </q>
BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Is not the expreſſion in the Burial-ſervice, 'In the <hi>ſure</hi> and <hi>certain</hi> hope of a bleſſed reſurrection;' too ſtrong to be uſed indiſcriminately, and, indeed, ſometimes when thoſe over whoſe bodies it is ſaid have been notoriouſly profane?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is ſure and certain <hi>hope,</hi> Sir; not <hi>belief.</hi>"</q> I did not inſiſt further; but cannot help thinking that leſs poſitive words would be more proper.</p>
               <p>Talking of a man who was grown very fat, ſo as to be incommoded with corpulency; he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He eats too much, Sir."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I don't know, Sir, you will ſee one man ſat who eats moderately, and another lean who eats a great deal."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, whatever may be the quantity that a man eats, it is plain that if he is too fat, he has eaten more than he ſhould have done. One man may have a digeſtion that conſumes food better than common; but it is certain that ſolidity is encreaſed by putting ſomething to
<pb n="451" facs="tcp:0548300102:453" rendition="simple:additions"/>
it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But may not ſolids ſwell and be diſtended?"</q> JOHNSON.  <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, they may ſwell and be diſtended; but that is not fat."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of the accuſation againſt a gentleman for ſuppoſed delinquencies in India. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"What foundation there is for accuſation I know not, but they will not get at him. Where bad actions are committed at ſo great a diſtance, a delinquent can obſcure the evidence till the ſcent becomes cold; there is a cloud between, which cannot be penetrated, therefore all diſtant power is bad. I am clear that the beſt plan for the government of India is a deſpotick governour; for if he be a good man it is evidently the beſt government; and ſuppoſing him to be a bad man, it is better to have one plunderer than many. A governour whoſe power is checked, lets others plunder that he himſelf may be allowed to plunder. But if deſpotick, he ſees that the more he lets others plunder the leſs there will be for himſelf, ſo he reſtrains them; and though he himſelf plunders, the country is a gainer, compared with being plundered by numbers."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned the very liberal payment which had been received for review<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, as evidence of this, that it had been proved in a trial that Dr. Shebbeare had received ſix guineas a ſheet for that kind of literary labour. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, he might get ſix guineas for a particular ſheet, but not <hi>communibus ſheetibus.</hi>"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Pray, Sir, by a ſheet of review is it meant that it ſhall be all of the writer's own compoſition; or are extracts, made from the book reviewed, deducted?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir: it is a ſheet, no matter of what."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I think that it is not reaſonable."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, it is. A man will more eaſily write a ſheet all his own than read an octavo volume to get extracts."</q> To one of Johnſon's wonderful fertility of mind, I believe writing was really eaſier than reading and extract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but with ordinary men the caſe is very different. A great deal, indeed, will depend upon the care and judgement with which the extracts are made. I can ſuppoſe the operation to be tedious and difficult: but in many inſtances we muſt obſerve crude morſels cut out of books as if at random; and when a large extract is made from one place, it ſurely may be done with very little trouble. One, however, I muſt acknowledge, might be led, from the practice of Reviewers, to ſuppoſe that they take a pleaſure in original writing; for we often find that, inſtead of giving an accurate account of what has been done by the authour whoſe work they are reviewing, which is ſurely the proper buſineſs of a literary journal, they produce ſome plauſible and ingenious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits of their own, upon the topicks which have been diſcuſſed.</p>

 Upon being told that old Mr. Sheridan, indignant at the neglect of his oratorical plans, had threatened to go to America;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I hope he will go to America."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"The Americans don't want oratory."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"But we can want Sheridan."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Monday, April 29, I found him at home in the forenoon, and Mr. Seward with him. Horace having bèen mentioned;—BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"There is a great deal of thinking in his works. One finds there almoſt every thing but religion."</q> SEWARD. <q rend="inline">"He ſpeaks of his returning to it in his Ode <hi>Parcus Deorum cultor et infrequens.</hi>"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, he was not in earneſt. This was merely poetical."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"There are, I am afraid, many people who have no religion at all."</q> SEWARD. <q rend="inline">"And ſenſible people too."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, not ſenſible in that reſpect. There muſt be either a natural or a moral ſtupidity, if one lives in a total neglect of ſo very important a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern."</q> SEWARD. <q rend="inline">"I wonder that there ſhould be people without religion."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you need not wonder at this, when you conſider how large a pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="3 letters">

               </p>
               <p>I mentioned a worthy friend of ours whom we valued much, but obſerved that he was too ready to introduce religious diſcourſe upon all occaſions. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why yes, Sir, he will introduce religious diſcourſe without ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whether it will end in inſtruction and improvement, or produce ſome profane jeſt. He would introduce it in the company of Wilkes, and twenty more ſuch."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned Dr. Johnſon's excellent diſtinction between liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and liberty of teaching. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Conſider, Sir; if you have children whom you wiſh to educate in the principles of the Church of England, and there comes a Quaker who tries to pervert them to his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; you would drive away the Quaker.

predomination of right, which you believe is in your opinions; you would  keep wrong out of their heads. Now the vulgar are the children of the State. If any one attempts to teach them doctrines contrary to what the State approves, the magiſtrate may and ought to reſtrain him."</q> SEWARD. <q rend="inline">"Would you reſtrain private converſation, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, it is difficult to ſay where private converſation begins, and where it ends. If we three ſhould diſcuſs even the great queſtion concerning the exiſtence of a Supreme Being by ourſelves, we ſhould not be reſtrained; for that would be to put an end to all improvement. But if we ſhould diſcuſs it in the preſence of ten boarding-ſchool girls, and as many boys, I think the magiſtrate would do well to put us in the ſtocks, to finiſh the debate there."</q>

               <p>Lord Hailes had ſent him a preſent of a curious little printed poem, on repairing the Univerſity of Aberdeen, by David <hi>Malloch,</hi> which he thought would pleaſe Johnſon, as affording clear evidence that Mallet had appeared even as a literary character by the name of <hi>Malloch;</hi> his changing which to one of ſofter ſound, had given Johnſon occaſion to introduce him into his Dictionary, under the article <hi>Alias.</hi> This piece was, I ſuppoſe, one of Mallet's firſt eſſays. It is preſerved in his works, with ſeveral variations. Johnſon now read aloud, from the beginning of it, where there were ſome common-place aſſertions as to the ſuperiority of ancient times. <q rend="inline">"How falſe is all this to ſay that in ancient times learning was not a diſgrace to a Peer as it is now. In ancient times a Peer was as ignorant as any one elſe. He would have been angry to have it thought he could write his name. Men in ancient times dared to ſtand forth with a degree of ignorance with which nobody would dare now to ſtand forth. I am always angry when I hear ancient times praiſed at the expence of modern times. There is now a great deal more learning in the world than than there was formerly; for it is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally diffuſed. You have, perhaps, no man who knows as much Greek and Latin as Bentley; or no man who knows as much mathematicks as Newton: but you have many more men who know Greek and Latin, and who know mathematicks."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Thurſday, May 1, I viſited him in the evening along with young Mr. Burke. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is ſtrange that there ſhould be ſo little reading in the world, and ſo much writing. People in general do not willingly read, if they can have any thing elſe to amuſe them. There muſt be an external impulſe; emulation, or vanity, or avarice. The progreſs which the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding makes through a book, has more pain than pleaſure in it. Language is ſcanty, and inadequate to expreſs the nice gradations and mixtures of our
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:0548300102:456" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 feelings. No man reads a book of ſcience from pure inclination. The books that we do read with pleaſure are light compoſitions, which contain a quick ſucceſſion of events. However, I have this year read all Virgil through. I read a book of the Aeneid every night, ſo it was done in twelve nights, and I had great delight in it. The Georgicks did not give me ſo much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, except the fourth book. The Eclogues I have almoſt all by heart. I do no think the ſtory of the Aeneid intereſting. I like the ſtory of the Odyſſey much better; and this not on account of the wonderful things which it contains; for there are wonderful things enough in the Aeneid;—the ſhips of the Trojans turned to ſea-nymphs—the tree at Polydorus's tomb dropping blood. The ſtory of the Odyſſey is intereſting, as a great part of it is domeſtick. It has been ſaid, there is pleaſure in writing, particularly in writing verſes. I allow you may have pleaſure from writing after it is over, if you have written well; but you don't go willingly to it again. I know when I have been writing verſes, I have run my finger down the margin to ſee how many I had made, and how few I had to make."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſeemed to be in a very placid humour, and although I have no note of the particulars of young Mr. Burke's converſation, it is but juſtice to mention in general, that it was ſuch that Dr. Johnſon ſaid to me afterwards, <q rend="inline">"He did very well indeed; I have a mind to tell his father."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I have no minute of any interview with Johnſon till Thurſday, May 15, when I find what follows:—BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I wiſh much to be in Parliament, Sir."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, unleſs you come reſolved to ſupport any adminiſtration, you would be the worſe for being in Parliament, becauſe you would be obliged to live more expenſively."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Perhaps, Sir, I ſhould be the leſs happy for being in Parliament. I never would ſell my vote, and I ſhould be vexed if things went wrong."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That's cant, Sir. It would not vex you more in the houſe, than in the gallery. Publick affairs vex no man."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Have not they vexed yourſelf a little, Sir? Have not you been vexed by all the turbulence of this reign, and by that abſurd vote of the Houſe of Commons, 'That the influence of the Crown has increaſed, is increaſing, and ought to be diminiſhed'?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I have never ſlept an hour leſs, nor eat an ounce leſs meat. I would have knocked the factious dogs on the head, to be ſure; but I was not <hi>vexed.</hi>"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I declare, Sir, upon my honour, I did imagine I was vexed, and took a pride in it. But it <hi>was,</hi> perhaps, cant; for I own I neither eat leſs nor ſlept leſs."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"My dear friend, clear your <hi>mind</hi> of cant. You may <hi>talk</hi> as other people do. You may ſay to a man, 'Sir, I am your
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:0548300102:457" rendition="simple:additions"/>
moſt humble ſervant.' You are <hi>not</hi> his moſt humble ſervant. You may ſay,  'Theſe are ſad times; it is a melancholy thing to be reſerved to ſuch times.' You don't mind the times. You tell a man, 'I am ſorry you had ſuch bad weather the laſt day of your journey, and were ſo much wet.' You don't care ſix-pence whether he was wet or dry. You may <hi>talk</hi> in this manner; it is a mode of talking in Society: but don't <hi>think</hi> fooliſhly."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I talked of living in the country. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Don't ſet up for what is called hoſpitality; it is a waſte of time, and a waſte of money; you are eat up, and not the more reſpected for your liberality. If your houſe be like an inn, nobody cares for you. A man who ſtays a week with another, makes him a ſlave for a week."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But there are people, Sir, who make their houſes a home to their gueſts, and are themſelves quite eaſy."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Then, Sir, home muſt be the ſame to the gueſts, and they need not come."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Here he diſcovered a notion common enough in perſons not much accuſtomed to entertain company; that there muſt be a degree of elaborate attention otherwiſe company will think themſelves neglected; and ſuch attention is no doubt very fatiguing. He proceeded, <q rend="inline">"I would not, however, be a ſtranger in my own county; I would viſit my neighbours, and receive their viſits; but I would not be in haſte to return viſits. If a gentleman comes to ſee me, I tell him he does me a great deal of honour. I do not go to ſee him perhaps for ten weeks, then we are very complaiſant to each other. No, Sir, you will have much more influence by giving or lending money where it is wanted, than by hoſpitality."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Saturday, May 17, I ſaw him for a ſhort time. Having mentioned that I had that morning been with old Mr. Sheridan, he remembered their former intimacy with a cordial warmth, and ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"Tell Mr. Sheridan, I ſhall be glad to ſee him and ſhake hands with him."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"It is to me very wonderful that reſentment ſhould be kept up ſo long."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, it is not altogether reſentment that he does not viſit me; it is partly falling out of the habit—partly diſguſt, as one has at a drug that has made him ſick. Beſides, he knows that I laugh at his oratory."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Another day I ſpoke of one of our friends, of whom he, as well as I, had a very high opinion. He expatiated in his praiſe; but added, <q rend="inline">"Sir, he is a curſed Whig, a <hi>bottomleſs</hi> Whig, as they all are now."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I mentioned my expectations from the intereſt of an eminent perſon then in power; adding, <q rend="inline">"but I have no claim but the claim of friendſhip. However, ſome people will go a great way from that motive."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, they
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:0548300102:458"/>
 will go all the way from that motive."</q> A gentleman talked of retiring. <q rend="inline">"Never think of that,"</q> ſaid Johnſon. The gentleman urged, <q rend="inline">"I ſhould then do no ill."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nor no good either. Sir, it would be a civil ſuicide."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Monday, May 26, I found him at tea, and the celebrated Miſs Burney, the authour of <q rend="inline">"Evelina and Cecilia"</q> with him. I aſked if there would be any ſpeakers in parliament, if there were no places to be obtained? JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir. Why do you ſpeak here? Either to inſtruct and entertain, which is a benevolent motive; or for diſtinction, which is a ſelfiſh motive."</q> I mentioned <q rend="inline">"Cecilia."</q> JOHNSON. (with an air of animated ſatisfaction) <q rend="inline">"Sir, if you talk of 'Cecilia,' talk on."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of Mr. Barry's exhibition of his pictures. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the hand may have done, the mind has done its part. There is a graſp of mind there which you find no where elſe <note n="7" place="bottom">In Mr. Barry's printed analyſis, or deſcription of theſe pictures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he ſpeaks of Johnſon's character in the higheſt terms.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I aſked whether a man naturally virtuous, or one who has overcome wicked inclinations is the beſt. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, to <hi>you,</hi> the man who has overcome wicked inclinations is not the beſt. He has more merit to <hi>himſelf.</hi> I would rather truſt my money to a man who has no hands, and ſo a phyſical impoſſibility to ſteal, than to a man of the moſt honeſt principles. There is a witty ſatirical ſtory of Foote. He had a ſmall buſt of Garrick placed upon his bureau.

               <p>On Friday, May 29, being to ſet out for Scotland next morning, I paſſed a part of the day with him in more than uſual earneſtneſs; as his health was in a more precarious ſtate than at any time when I had parted from him. He however was quick and lively, and critical as uſual. I mentioned one who was a very learned man. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir, he has a great deal of learning; but it never lies ſtraight. There is never one idea by the ſide of another; 'tis all entangled: and then he drives it ſo aukwardly upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſtated to him an anxious thought, by which a ſincere Chriſtian might be diſturbed, even when conſcious of having lived a good life, ſo far as is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with human infirmity; he might fear that he ſhould afterwards fall away, and be guilty of ſuch crimes as would render all his former religion vain. <q rend="inline">Could there be, upon this aweful ſubject, ſuch a thing as balancing
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:0548300102:459" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of accounts? Suppoſe a man who has led a good life for ſeven years, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits  an act of wickedneſs, and inſtantly dies; will his former good life have any effect in his favour?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, if a man has led a good life for ſeven years, and then is hurried by paſſion to do what is wrong, and is ſuddenly carried off, depend upon it he will have the reward of his ſeven years' good life; GOD will not take a catch of him. Upon this principle Richard Baxter believes, that a Suicide may be ſaved. 'If (ſays he) it ſhould be objected that what I maintain may encourage ſuicide, I anſwer, I am not to tell a lie to prevent it."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But does not the text ſay, 'As the tree falls, ſo it muſt lye'?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; as the tree falls. But—(after a little pauſe)—that is meant as to the general ſtate of the tree, not what is the effect of a ſudden blaſt."</q> In ſhort, he interpreted the expreſſion as refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to condition, not to poſition. The common notion, therefore, ſeems to be erroneous; and Shenſtone's witty remark on Divines trying to give the tree a jerk upon a death-bed, to make it lye favourably, is not well founded.</p>
               <p>I aſked him what works of Richard Baxter's I ſhould read. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Read any of them; they are all good."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Get as much force of mind as you can. Live within your income. Always have ſomething ſaved at the end of the year. Let your imports be more than your exports, and you'll never go far wrong."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I aſſured him, that in the extenſive and various range of his acquaintance there never had been any one who had a more ſincere reſpect and affection for him than I had. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I believe it, Sir. Were I in diſtreſs, there is no man to whom I ſhould ſooner come than to you. I ſhould like to come and have a cottage in your park, toddle about, live moſtly on milk, and be taken care of by Mrs. Boſwell. She and I are good friends now; are we not?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking of devotion, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Though it be true that 'GOD dwelleth not in temples made with hands,' yet in this ſtate of being our minds are more piouſly affected in places appropriated to divine worſhip, than in others. Some people have a particular room in their houſe where they ſay their prayers, of which I do not diſapprove, as it may animate their devotion."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He embraced me, and gave me his bleſſing, as uſual when I was leaving him for any length of time. I walked from his door to-day with a fearful apprehenſion of what might happen before I returned.</p>

               <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                  <body>
                     <p>On Monday the 16th I ſat for my picture, and walked a conſiderable way with little inconvenience. In the afternoon and evening I felt myſelf light and eaſy, and began to plan ſchemes of life. Thus I went to bed, and in a ſhort time walked and ſat up, as has been long my cuſtom, when I felt a confuſion and indiſtinctneſs in my head, which laſted, I ſuppoſe, about half a minute. I was alarmed, and prayed GOD, that however he might afflict my body, he would ſpare my underſtanding. This prayer, that I might try the integrity of my faculties, I made in Latin verſe. The lines were not very good, but I knew them not to be very good: I made them eaſily, and concluded myſelf to be unimpaired in my faculties.</p>
                     <p>Soon after I perceived that I had ſuffered a paralytick ſtroke, and that my ſpeech was taken from me. I had no pain, and ſo little dejection in this dreadful ſtate, that I wondered at my own apathy, and conſidered that perhaps death itſelf, when it ſhould come, would excite leſs horrour than ſeems now to attend it.</p>
                     <p>In order to rouze the vocal organs, I took two drams. Wine has been celebrated for the production of eloquence. I put myſelf into violent motion, and I think repeated it; but all was vain. I then went to bed, and, ſtrange as it may ſeem, I think, ſlept. When I ſaw light, it was time to contrive
<pb n="460" facs="tcp:0548300102:462" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 what I ſhould do. Though GOD ſtopped my ſpeech, he left me my hand, I enjoyed a mercy which was not granted to my dear friend Lawrence, who now perhaps overlooks me as I am writing, and rejoices that I have what he wanted. My firſt note was neceſſarily to my ſervant, who came in talking, and could not immediately comprehend why he ſhould read what I put into his hands.</p>
                     <p>I then wrote a card to Mr. Allen, that I might have a diſcreet friend at hand, to act as occaſion ſhould require. In penning this note, I had ſome difficulty; my hand, I knew not how nor why, made wrong letters. I then wrote to Dr. Taylor to come to me, and bring Dr. Heberden; and I ſent to Dr. Brockleſby, who is my neighbour. My phyſicians are very friendly and give me great hopes; but you may imagine my ſituation. I have ſo far recovered my vocal powers, as to repeat the Lord's Prayer with no very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect articulation. My memory, I hope, yet remains as it was; but ſuch an attack produces ſolicitude for the ſafety of every faculty.</p>

My organs were ſo obſtructed, that I could ſay <hi>no,</hi> but could ſcarcely ſay <hi>yes.</hi> I wrote the neceſſary directions, for it pleaſed GOD to ſpare my hand, and ſent for Dr. Heberden and Dr. Brockleſby. Between the time in which I diſcovered my own diſorder, and that in which I ſent for the doctors, I had, I believe, in ſpite of my ſurprize and ſolicitude, a little ſleep, and Nature began to renew its operations. They came, and gave the directions which the diſeaſe required, and from that time I have been continually improving in articulation. I can now ſpeak, but the nerves are weak, and I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue diſcourſe long; but ſtrength, I hope, will return. The phyſicians conſider me as cured. I was laſt Sunday at church. On Tueſday I took an airing to Hampſtead, and dined with the Club, where Lord Palmerſton was propoſed, and, againſt my opinion, was rejected <note n="1" place="bottom">His Lordſhip was ſoon after choſen, and is now a member of the Club.</note>.

In Auguſt he went as far as the neighbourhood of Salibury, to Heale, the ſeat of William Bowles, Eſq. a gentleman whom I have heard him praiſe for exemplary religious order in his family.

               <p>While he was here he had a letter from Dr. Brockleſby, acquainting him of the death of Mrs. Williams, which affected him a good deal. Though for ſeveral years her temper had not been complacent, ſhe had valuable quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and her departure left a blank in his houſe. Upon this occaſion he, according to his habitual courſe of piety, compoſed a prayer <note n="2" place="bottom">Prayers and Meditations, p. 226.</note>.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here inſert a few particulars concerning him, with which I have been favoured by one of his friends.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"He had once conceived the deſign of writing the Life of Oliver Cromwell, ſaying, that he thought it muſt be highly curious to trace his extraordinary riſe to the ſupreme power, from ſo obſcure a beginning. He at length laid aſide his ſcheme, on diſcovering that all that can be told of him is already in print; and that it is impracticable to procure any authentick information in addition to what the world is already poſſeſſed of."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"He had likewiſe projected, but at what part of his life is not known, a work to ſhew how ſmall a quantity of REAL FICTION there is in the world; and how the ſame images, with very little variation, have ſerved all the authours who have ever written."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"His thoughts in the latter part of his life were frequently employed on his deceaſed friends. He often muttered theſe, or ſuch like ſentences, 'Poor man! and then he died."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Speaking of a certain literary friend, 'He is a very pompous puzzling fellow, (ſays the Doctor;) he lent me a letter once that ſomebody had written to him, no matter what it was about; but he wanted to have the letter back, and expreſſed a mighty value for it, he hoped it was to be met with again, he would not loſe it for a thouſand pounds. I layed my hand upon it ſoon afterwards, and gave it him. I believe I ſaid, I was very glad to have met with it. O then he did not know that it ſignified any thing. So you ſee, when the letter was loſt it was worth a thouſand pounds, and when it was found it was not worth a farthing."</q>

                  <q rend="inline">"The ſtyle and character of his converſation is pretty generally known; it was certainly conducted in conformity with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> of Lord Bacon, but it is not clear, I apprehend, that this conformity was either perceived or intended by Johnſon. The precept alluded to is as follows: 'In all kinds of ſpeech, either pleaſant, grave, ſevere, or ordinary, it is convenient to ſpeak leiſurely, and rather drawingly than haſtily: becauſe haſty ſpeech confounds the memory, and oftentimes, beſides the unſeemlineſs, drives a man either to ſtammering, a non-plus, or harping on that which ſhould fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; whereas a ſlow ſpeech confirmeth the memory, addeth a conceit of wiſdom to the hearers, beſides a ſeemlineſs of ſpeech and countenance.' Dr. Johnſon's method of converſation was certainly calculated to excite attention, and to amufe or inſtruct, (as it happened,) without wearying or confuſing his company. He was always moſt perfectly clear and conſpicuous; and his language was ſo accurate, and his ſentences ſo neatly conſtructed, that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation might have been all printed without any correction. At the ſame time, it was eaſy and natural; the accuracy of it had no appearance of labour, conſtraint, or ſtiffneſs; he ſeemed more correct than others by the force of habit and the cuſtomary exerciſes of his powerful mind."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"He ſpoke often in praiſe of French literature. 'The French are excellent in this, (he would ſay,) they have a book on every ſubject.' From what he had ſeen of them he denied them the praiſe of ſuperiour politeneſs, and mentioned, with very viſible diſguſt, the cuſtom they have of ſpitting on the floors of their apartment. 'This (ſays the Doctor) is as groſs a thing as can well be done; and one wonders how any man, or ſet of men, can perſiſt in ſo offenſive a practice for a whole day together; one ſhould expect that the firſt effort toward civilization would remove it even amongſt ſavages."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Baxter's 'Reaſons of the Chriſtian Religion,' he thought contained the beſt collection of the evidences of the divinity of the Chriſtian ſyſtem."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Chymiſtry was always an intereſting purſuit with Dr. Johnſon. Whilſt he was in Wiltſhire, he attended ſome experiments that were made by a phyſician at Saliſbury, on the new kinds of air. In the courſe of the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments frequent mention being made of Dr. Prieſtley, Dr. Johnſon knit his brows, and in a ſtern manner enquired, 'Why do we hear ſo much of Dr. Prieſtley <note n="3" place="bottom">I do not wonder at Johnſon's diſpleaſure when the name of Dr. Prieſtley was mentioned; for I know no writer who has been ſuffered to publiſh more pernicious doctrines. I ſhall inſtance only three. Firſt, <hi>Materialiſm;</hi> by which <hi>mind</hi> is denied to human nature, which, if believed, muſt deprive us of every elevated principle. Secondly, <hi>Neceſſity;</hi> or the doctrine that every action, whether good or bad, is included in an unchangeable and unavoidable ſyſtem; a notion utterly ſubverſive of moral government. Thirdly, that we have no reaſon to think that the <hi>future</hi> world, (which, as he is pleaſed to <hi>inform</hi> us, will be adapted to our merely improved nature,) will be materially different from <hi>this;</hi> which, if believed, would ſink wretched mortals into deſpair, as they could no longer hope for the <q rend="inline">"reſt that remaineth for the people of GOD,"</q> or for that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which is revealed to us as ſomething beyond our preſent conceptions; but would ſeel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves doomed to a continuation of the uneaſy ſtate under which they now groan. I ſay nothing of the petulant intemperance with which he dares to inſult the venerable eſtabliſhments of his country.</note>?' He was very properly anſwered, 'Sir, becauſe we are indebted
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:0548300102:467" rendition="simple:additions"/>
to him for theſe important diſcoveries.' On this, Dr. Johnſon appeared well  content; and replied, 'Well, well, I believe we are; and let every man have the honour he has merited."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"A friend was one day, about two years before his death, ſtruck with ſome inſtance of Dr. Johnſon's great candour. 'Well, Sir, (ſaid he,) I will always ſay that you are a very candid man.'—'Will you (replied the Doctor) I doubt then you will be very ſingular. But, indeed, Sir, (continued he,) I look upon myſelf to be a man very much miſunderſtood. I am not an uncandid, nor am I a ſevere man. I ſometimes ſay more than I mean in jeſt, and people are apt to believe me ſerious: however, I am more candid than I was when I was younger. As I know more of mankind I expect leſs of them, and am ready now to call a man <hi>a good man,</hi> upon eaſier terms than I was formerly."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On his return from Heale he wrote to Dr. Burney. <q rend="inline">"I came home on the 18th at noon to a very diſconſolate houſe. You and I have loſt our friends, but you have more friends at home. My domeſtick companion is taken from me. She is much miſſed, for her acquiſitions were many, and her curioſity univerſal; ſo that ſhe partook of every converſation. I am not well enough to go much out; and to ſit, and eat, or faſt alone, is very weariſome. I always mean to ſend my compliments to all the ladies."</q>
               </p>
               <p>His fortitude and patience met with ſevere trials during this year. The ſtroke of the palſy has been related circumſtantially; but he was alſo afflicted with the gout, and was beſides troubled with a complaint which not only was attended with immediate inconvenience, but threatened him with a painful chirurgical operation, from which moſt men would ſhrink. The complaint was a <hi>ſarcocele,</hi> which Johnſon bore with uncommon firmneſs, and was not at all frightened while he looked forward to amputation. He was attended by Mr. Pott and alſo Mr. Cruikſhank. I have before me a letter of the 30th of July this year, to Mr. Cruikſhank, in which he ſays, <q rend="inline">"I am going to put myſelf into your hands;"</q> and another, accompanying a ſet of his <q rend="inline">"Lives of
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:0548300102:468" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 the Poets,"</q> in which he ſays, <q rend="inline">"I beg your acceptance of theſe volumes, as an acknowledgement of the great favours which you have beſtowed on, Sir, your moſt obliged and moſt humble ſervant."</q> I have in my poſſeſſion ſeveral more letters from him to Mr. Cruikſhank, and alſo to Dr. Mudge at Plymouth, which it would be improper to inſert, as they are filled with unpleaſing technical details. I ſhall, however, extract from his letters to Dr. Mudge ſuch paſſages as ſhew either a felicity of expreſſion, or the undaunted ſtate of his mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"My conviction of your ſkill, and my belief of your friendſhip, determine me to intreat your opinion and advice."</q>—<q rend="inline">"In this ſtate I with great earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs deſire you to tell me what is to be done. Exciſion is doubtleſs neceſſary to the cure, and I know not any means of palliation. The operation is doubtleſs painful; but is it dangerous? The pain I hope to endure with decency; but I am loth to put life into much hazard."</q>—<q rend="inline">"By repreſenting the gout as an antagoniſt to the palſy, you have ſaid enough to make it welcome. This is not ſtrictly the firſt fit, but I hope it is as good as the firſt; for it is the ſecond that ever confined me; and the firſt was ten years ago, much leſs fierce and fiery than this."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Write, dear Sir, what you can, to inform or encourage me. The operation is not delayed by any fears or objections of mine."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Happily the complaint abated without his being put to the torture of amputation. But we muſt ſurely admire the manly reſolution which he diſcovered while it hung over him.</p>

               <p>He this autumn received a viſit from the celebrated Mrs. Siddons. He gives this account of it in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale:—<q rend="inline">"Mrs. Siddons, in her viſit to me, behaved with great modeſty and propriety, and left nothing behind her to be cenſured or deſpiſed. Neither praiſe nor money, the two powerful corrupters of mankind, ſeem to have depraved her. I ſhall be glad to ſee her again. Her brother Kemble calls on me, and pleaſes me very well. Mrs. Siddons and I talked of plays; and ſhe told me her intention of exhibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this winter the characters of Conſtance, Catherine, and Iſabella, in Shakſpeare."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Kemble has favoured me with the following minute of what paſſed at this viſit.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>When Mrs. Siddons came into the room, there happened to be no chair ready for her, which he obſerving, ſaid with a ſmile, <q rend="inline">'Madam, you who ſo often occaſion a want of ſeats to other people, will the more eaſily excuſe the want of one yourſelf.'</q>
                  </p>

                     <pb n="468" facs="tcp:0548300102:470" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Having placed himſelf by her, he with great good humour entered upon a conſideration of the Engliſh drama; and, among other enquiries, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly aſked her which of Shakſpeare's characters ſhe was moſt pleaſed with. Upon her anſwering that ſhe thought the character of Queen Catherine in Henry the Eighth the moſt natural. <q rend="inline">'I think ſo too, Madam, (ſaid he;) and whenever you perform it I will once more hobble out to the theatre myſelf.'</q> Mrs. Siddons promiſed ſhe would do herſelf the honour of acting his favourite part for him; but many circumſtances happened to prevent the repreſentation of King Henry the Eighth during the Doctor's life.</p>
                  <p>In the courſe of the evening he thus gave his opinion upon the merits of ſome of the principal performers whom he remembered to have ſeen upon the ſtage. <q rend="inline">'Mrs. Porter, in the vehemence of rage, and Mrs. Clive in the ſprightlineſs of humour, I have never ſeen equalled. What Clive did beſt, ſhe did better than Garrick; but could not do half ſo many things well; ſhe was a better romp than any I ever ſaw in nature. Pritchard, in common life, was a vulgar ideot; ſhe would talk of her <hi>gownd:</hi> but, when ſhe appeared upon the ſtage, ſeemed to be inſpired by gentility and underſtanding. I once talked with Colley Cibber, and thought him ignorant of the principles of his art. Garrick, Madam, was no declaimer; there was not one of his own ſcene-ſhifters who could not have ſpoken <hi>To be, or not to be,</hi> better than he did; yet he was the only actor I ever ſaw whom I could call a maſter both in tragedy and comedy; though I liked him beſt in comedy. A true con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception of character, and natural expreſſion of it were his diſtinguiſhing excellencies.'</q> Having expatiated, with his uſual force and eloquence, on Mr. Garrick's extraordinary eminence as an actor, he concluded with this compliment to his ſocial talents: <q rend="inline">'And after all, Madam, I thought him leſs to be envied on the ſtage than at the head of a table.</q>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Johnſon, indeed, had thought more upon the ſubject of acting than might be generally ſuppoſed. Talking of it one day to Mr. Kemble, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Are you, Sir, one of thoſe enthuſiaſts who believe yourſelf transformed into the very character you repreſent."</q> Upon Mr. Kemble's anſwering that he had never felt ſo ſtrong a perſuaſion himſelf; <q rend="inline">"To be ſure not, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon). The thing is impoſſible. And if Garrick really believed himſelf to be that monſter Richard the Third, he deſerved to be hanged every time he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A pleaſing inſtance of the generous attention of one of his friends has been diſcovered by the publication of Mrs. Thrale's collection of Letters. In a
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:0548300102:471"/>
letter to one of the Miſs Thrales <note n="4" place="bottom">Vol. II. p. 328.</note>, he writes, <q rend="inline">"A friend, whoſe name I will  tell when your mamma has tried to gueſs it, ſent to my phyſician to enquire whether this long train of illneſs had brought me into difficulties for want of money, with an invitation to ſend to him for what occaſion required. I ſhall write this night to thank him, having no need to borrow."</q> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in a letter to Mrs. Thrale, <q rend="inline">"Since you cannot gueſs, I will tell you, that the generous man was Gerard Hamilton.

Mrs. Gardiner was very zealous for the ſupport of a Welch charity-ſchool; and Johnſon this year, I find, obtained for it a ſermon from the late Biſhop of St. Aſaph, Dr. Shipley, whom he, in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale, characteriſes as <q rend="inline">"knowing and converſible;"</q> and whom all who knew his Lordſhip, even thoſe who differed from him in poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks, remember with much reſpect.</p>

Sir Joſhua Reynolds having informed me that this letter was in Lord Carliſle's poſſeſſion, though not fortunate enough to have the honour of being known to his Lordſhip, truſting to the general courteſy of literature, I wrote to him, requeſting the favour of a copy of it, and to be permitted to inſert it in my life of Dr. Johnſon. His Lordſhip was ſo good as to comply with my requeſt, and has thus enabled me to enrich my work with a very fine piece of writing, which diſplays at once the critical ſkill and politeneſs of my illuſtrious friend; and perhaps the curioſity which it will excite, may induce the noble and elegant authour to gratify the world by the publication<note n="6" place="bottom">A few copies only of this tragedy have been printed, and given to the authour's friends.</note> of a performance, of which Dr. Johnſon has ſpoken in ſuch terms.</p>

                     <p>BY ſending the tragedy to me a ſecond time <note n="7" place="bottom">Dr. Johnſon, having been very ill when the tragedy was firſt ſent to him, had declined the conſideration of it.</note>, I think that a very honourable diſtinction has been ſhewn me, and I did not delay the peruſal, of which I am now to tell the effect.</p>
                     <p>The conſtruction of the play is not completely regular; the ſtage is too often vacant, and the ſcenes are not ſufficiently connected. This, however, would be called by Dryden only a mechanical defect; which takes away little from the power of the poem, and which is ſeen rather than felt.</p>
                     <p>A rigid examiner of the diction might, perhaps, wiſh ſome words changed, and ſome lines more vigorouſly terminated. But from ſuch petty imperfections what writer was ever free?</p>
                     <p>The general form and force of the dialogue is of more importance. It ſeems to want that quickneſs of reciprocation which characteriſes the Engliſh drama, and is not always ſufficiently fervid or animated.</p>

                     <p>LIKE all other men who have great friends, you begin to feel the pangs of neglected merit, and all the comfort that I can give you is, by telling you that you have probably more pangs to feel, and more neglect to ſuffer. You have, indeed, begun to complain too ſoon; and I hope I am the only confidant of your diſcontent. Your friends have not yet had leiſure
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:0548300102:474"/>
 to gratify perſonal kindneſs; they have hitherto been buſy in ſtrengthening their miniſterial intereſt. If a vacancy happens in Scotland, give them early intelligence; and as you can ſerve Government as powerfully as any of your probable competitors, you may make in ſome ſort a warrantable claim.</p>
                     <p>Of the exaltations and depreſſions of your mind you delight to talk, and I hate to hear. Drive all ſuch fancies from you.</p>
                     <p>On the day when I received your letter, I think, the foregoing page was written; to which, one diſeaſe or another has hindered me from making any additions. I am now a little better. But ſickneſs and ſolitude preſs me very heavily. I could bear ſickneſs better, if I were relieved from ſolitude.</p>
                     <p>The preſent dreadful confuſion of the publick ought to make you wrap yourſelf up in your hereditary poſſeſſions, which, though leſs than you may wiſh, are more than you can want; and in an hour of religious retirement return thanks to GOD, who has exempted you from any ſtrong temptation to faction, treachery, plunder, and diſloyalty.</p>
                     <p>As your neighbours diſtinguiſh you by ſuch honours as they can beſtow, content yourſelf with your ſtation, without neglecting your profeſſion. Your eſtate and the Courts will find you full employment; and your mind well occupied will be quiet.</p>
                     <p>The uſurpation of the nobility, for they apparently uſurp all the influence they gain by fraud, and miſrepreſentation, I think it certainly lawful, perhaps your duty to reſiſt. What is not their own they have only by robbery.</p>
                     <p>Your queſtion about the horſes gives me more perplexity. I know not well what advice to give you. I can only recommend a rule which you do not want—give as little pain as you can. I ſuppoſe that we have a right to their ſervice while their ſtrength laſts; what we can do with them afterwards I cannot ſo eaſily determine. But let us conſider. Nobody denies that man has a right firſt to milk the cow, and to ſheer the ſheep, and then to kill them for his table. May he not, by parity of reaſon, firſt work a horſe, and then kill him the eaſieſt way, that he may have the means of another horſe, or food for cows and ſheep? Man is influenced in both caſes by different motives of ſelf-intereſt. He that rejects the one muſt reject the other.</p>

The late ingenious Mr. Mickle, ſome time before his death, wrote me a  letter concerning Dr. Johnſon, in which he mentions, <q rend="inline">"I was upwards of twelve years acquainted with him, was frequently in his company, always talked with eaſe to him, and can truly ſay, that I never received from him one rough word."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In this letter he relates his having, while engaged in tranſlating the Luſiad, had a diſpute of conſiderable length with Johnſon, who, as, uſual declaimed upon the miſery and corruption of a ſea life, and uſed this expreſſion:—<q rend="inline">"It had been happy for the world, Sir, if your hero Gama, Prince Henry of Portugal, and Columbus, had never been born, or that their ſchemes had never gone farther than their own imaginations."</q>—<q rend="inline">"This ſentiment, (ſays Mr. Mickle,) which is to be found in his 'Introduction to the World diſplayed,' I, in my Diſſertation prefixed to the Luſiad, have controverted; and though authours are ſaid to be bad judges of their own works, I am not aſhamed to own to a friend, that that diſſertation is my favourite above all that I ever attempted in proſe. Next year, when the Luſiad was publiſhed, I waited on Dr. Johnſon, who addreſſed me with one of his good-humoured ſmiles:—'Well, you have remembered our diſpute about Prince Henry, and have cited me too. You have done your part very well indeed; you have made the beſt of your argument: but I am not convinced yet.'</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Before publiſhing the Luſiad, I ſent Mr. Hoole a proof of that part of the introduction, in which I make mention of Dr. Johnſon, yourſelf, and other well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhers to the work, begging it might be ſhewn to Dr. Johnſon. This was accordingly done; and in place of the ſimple mention of him which I had made, he dictated to Mr. Hoole the ſentence as it now ſtands.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Johnſon told me in 1772, that about twenty years before that time, he himſelf had a deſign to tranſlate the Luſiad, of the merit of which he ſpoke highly, but had been prevented by a number of other engagements.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Mr. Mickle reminds me in this letter of a converſation, when dining one day at Mr. Hoole's with Dr. Johnſon, when Mr. Nicol, the King's book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeller, and I attempted to controvert the maxim, <q rend="inline">"Better that ten guilty ſhould eſcape, than one innocent perſon ſuffer;"</q> and were anſwered by Dr. Johnſon with great power of reaſoning and eloquence. I am very ſorry that I have no record of that day; but I well recollect my illuſtrious friend's having ably ſhewn, that unleſs civil inſtitutions inſure protection to the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, all the confidence which mankind ſhould have in them would be loſt.</p>
               <p>I ſhall here mention what ſhould properly have appeared in my account of laſt year, though the controverſy was not cloſed till this. The Reverend

 Mr. Shaw, a native of one of the Hebrides, having entertained doubts of the authenticity of the poems aſcribed to Oſſian, diveſted himſelf of national bigotry; and having travelled in the Highlands and Iſlands of Scotland, and alſo in Ireland, in order to furniſh himſelf with materials for a Gaelick Dictionary, which he afterwards compiled, was ſo fully ſatisfied that Dr. Johnſon was in the right upon the queſtion, that he fairly publiſhed a pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlet, ſtating his conviction, and the proofs and reaſons on which it was founded. A perſon at Edinburgh, of the name of Clark, anſwered this pamphlet with much zeal, and much abuſe of its authour. Johnſon took Mr. Shaw under his protection, and gave him his aſſiſtance in writing a reply, which has been admired by the beſt judges, and by many been conſidered as concluſive. A few paragraphs, which ſufficiently mark their great authour, ſhall be ſelected.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>My aſſertions are, for the moſt part, purely negative: I deny the exiſtence of Fingal, becauſe in a long and curious peregrination through the Gaelick regions I have never been able to find it. What I could not ſee myſelf I ſuſpect to be equally inviſible to others; and I ſuſpect with the more reaſon, as among all thoſe who have ſeen it no man can ſhew it.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Clark compares the obſtinacy of thoſe who diſbelieve the genuine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Oſſian to a blind man, who ſhould diſpute the reality of colours, and deny that the Britiſh troops are cloathed in red. The blind man's doubt would be rational, if he did not know by experience that others have a power which he himſelf wants: but what perſpicacity has Mr. Clark which Nature has with-held from me or the reſt of mankind?</p>
                  <p>The true ſtate of the parallel muſt be this. Suppoſe a man, with eyes like his neighbours, was told by a boaſting corporal, that the troops, indeed, wore red clothes for their ordinary dreſs, but that every ſoldier had likewiſe a ſuit of black velvet, which he put on when the King reviews them. This he thinks ſtrange, and deſires to ſee the fine clothes, but finds nobody in forty thouſand men that can produce either coat or waiſtcoat. One, indeed, has left them in his cheſt at Port Mahon; another has always heard that he ought to have velvet clothes ſomewhere; and a third has heard ſomebody ſay, that ſoldiers ought to wear velvet. Can the enquirer be blamed if he goes away believing that a ſoldier's red coat is all that he has?</p>
                  <p>But the moſt obdurate incredulity may be ſhamed or ſilenced by facts. To overpower contradictions, let the ſoldier ſhew his velvet coat, and the Fingaliſt the original of Oſſian.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="475" facs="tcp:0548300102:477"/>
The difference between us and the blind man is this:—the blind man is  unconvinced, becauſe he cannot ſee; and we, becauſe though we can ſee, we find that nothing can be ſhown.</p>
               </q>
               <p>Notwithſtanding the complication of diſorders under which Johnſon now laboured, he did not reſign himſelf to deſpondency and diſcontent, but with wiſdom and ſpirit endeavoured to conſole and amuſe his mind with as many innocent enjoyments as he could procure. Sir John Hawkins has mentioned the cordiality with which he inſiſted that ſuch of the members of the old club in Ivy-lane as ſurvived ſhould meet again and dine together, which they did, twice at a tavern, and once at his houſe: and in order to inſure himſelf ſociety in the evening for three days in the week, he inſtituted a Club at the Eſſex Head, in Eſſex-ſtreet, then kept by Samuel Greaves, an old ſervant of Mr. Thrale's.</p>

It was a very ſevere winter, which probably aggravated his complaints; and the ſolitude in which Mr. Levett and Mrs. Williams had left him, rendered his life very gloomy.

                     <p>I HEAR of many inquiries which your kindneſs has diſpoſed you to make after me. I have long intended you a long letter, which perhaps the imagination of its length hindered me from beginning. I will, therefore, content myſelf with a ſhorter.</p>
                     <p>Having promoted the inſtitution of a new Club in the neighbourhood, at the houſe of an old ſervant of Thrale's, I went thither to meet the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and was ſeized with a ſpaſmodick aſthma ſo violent, that with difficulty
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:0548300102:481" rendition="simple:additions"/>
I got to my own houſe, in which I have been confined eight or nine weeks,  and from which I know not when I ſhall be able to go even to church. The aſthma, however, is not the worſt. A dropſy gains ground upon me; my legs and thighs are very much ſwollen with water, which I ſhould be content if I could keep there, but I am afraid that it will ſoon be higher. My nights are very ſleepleſs and very tedious. And yet I am extremely afraid of dying.</p>
                     <p>My phyſicians try to make me hope, that much of my malady is the effect of cold, and that ſome degree at leaſt of recovery is to be expected from vernal breezes and ſummer ſuns. If my life is prolonged to autumn, I ſhould be glad to try a warmer climate; though how to travel with a diſeaſed body, without a companion to conduct me, and with very little money, I do not well ſee. Ramſay has recovered his limbs in Italy; and Fielding was ſent to Liſbon, where, indeed, he died; but he was, I believe, paſt hope when he went. Think for me what I can do.</p>
                     <p>I received your pamphlet, and when I write again may perhaps tell you ſome opinion about it; but you will forgive a man ſtruggling with diſeaſe his neglect of diſputes, politicks, and pamphlets. Let me have your prayers. My compliments to your lady, and young ones. Aſk your phyſicians about my caſe; and deſire Sir Alexander Dick to write me his opinion.</p>

Dr. Cullen's words concerning him were, <q rend="inline">"It would give me the greateſt pleaſure to be of any ſervice to a man whom the publick properly eſteem, and whom I eſteem and reſpect as much as I do Dr. Johnſon."</q> Dr. Hope's, <q rend="inline">"Few people have a better claim on me than your friend, as hardly a day paſſes that I do not aſk his opinion about this or that word."</q> Dr. Monro's, <q rend="inline">"I moſt ſincerely join you in ſympathizing with that very worthy and ingenious character, from whom his country has derived much inſtruction and entertainment."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Hope correſponded with his friend Dr. Brockleſby. Doctors Cullen and Monro wrote their opinions and preſcriptions to me, which I afterwards carried with me to London, and, ſo far as they were encouraging, communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to Johnſon. The liberality on one hand, and grateful ſenſe of it on the other, I have great ſatisfaction in recording.</p>

The dropſy, by GOD's bleſſing, has now run almoſt totally away by natural evacuation; and the aſthma, if not irritated

by cold, gives me little trouble. While I am writing this, I have not any ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation  of debility or diſeaſe. But I do not yet venture out, having been confined to the houſe from the thirteenth of December, now a quarter of a year.</p>
                     <p>When it will be fit for me to travel as far as Auchinleck, I am not able to gueſs; but ſuch a letter as Mrs. Boſwell's might draw any man, not wholly motionleſs, a great way. Pray tell the dear lady how much her civility and kindneſs have touched and gratified me.</p>
                     <p>Our parliamentary tumults have now begun to ſubſide, and the King's authority is in ſome meaſure re-eſtabliſhed. Mr. Pitt will have great power; but you muſt remember, that what he has to give muſt, at leaſt for ſome time, be given to thoſe who gave, and thoſe who preſerve his power. A new miniſter can ſacrifice little to eſteem or friendſhip; he muſt, till he is ſettled, think only of extending his intereſt.</p>
                     <p>If you come hither through Edinburgh, ſend for Mrs. Stewart, and give from me another guinea for the letter in the old caſe, to which I ſhall not be ſatisfied with my claim, till ſhe gives it me.</p>

                     <p>YOU could do nothing ſo proper as to haſte back when you found the Parliament diſſolved. With the influence which your addreſs muſt
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:0548300102:486" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 have gained you, it may reaſonably be expected that your preſence will be of importance, and your activity of effect.</p>
                     <p>Your ſolicitude for me gives me that pleaſure which every man feels from the kindneſs of ſuch a friend; and it is with delight I relieve it by telling that Dr. Brockleſby's account is true, and that I am, by the bleſſing of GOD, wonderfully relieved.</p>
                     <p>You are entering upon a tranſaction which requires much prudence. You muſt endeavour to oppoſe without exaſperating; to practiſe temporary hoſtility, without producing enemies for life. This is, perhaps, hard to be done; yet it has been done by many, and ſeems moſt likely to be effected by oppoſing merely upon general principles, without deſcending to perſonal or particular cenſures or objections. One thing I muſt enjoin you, which is ſeldom obſerved in the conduct of elections;—I muſt entreat you to be ſcrupulous in the uſe of ſtrong liquors. One night's drunkenneſs may defeat the labours of forty days well employed. Be firm, but not clamorous; be active, but not malicious; and you may form ſuch an intereſt, as may not only exalt yourſelf, but dignify your family.</p>
                     <p>We are, as you may ſuppoſe, all buſy here. Mr. Fox reſolutely ſtands for Weſtminſter, and his friends ſay will carry the election. However that be, he will certainly have a ſeat. Mr. Hoole has juſt told me, that the city leans towards the King.</p>
                     <p>Let me hear, from time to time, how you are employed, and what progreſs you make.</p>
                     <p>Make dear Mrs. Boſwell, and all the young Boſwells, the ſincere com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments of,</p>

               <p>To Mr. Langton he wrote with that cordiality which was ſuitable to the long friendſhip which had ſubſiſted between him and that gentleman.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>March 27. Since you left me, I have continued in my own opinion, and in Dr. Brockleſby's, to grow better with reſpect to all my formidable and dangerous diſtempers; though to a body battered and ſhaken as mine has lately been, it is to be feared that weak attacks may be ſometimes miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous. I have, indeed, by ſtanding careleſsly at an open window, got a very troubleſome cough, which it has been neceſſary to appeaſe by opium, in larger quantities than I like to take, and I have not found it give way ſo readily as I expected; its obſtinacy, however, ſeems at laſt diſpoſed to ſubmit to the remedy, and I know not whether I ſhould then have a right to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of any morbid ſenſation. My aſthma is, I am afraid, conſtitutional
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:0548300102:487" rendition="simple:additions"/>
and incurable; but it is only occaſional, and unleſs it be excited by labour or  by cold, gives me no moleſtation, nor does it lay very cloſe ſiege to life; for Sir John Floyer, whom the phyſical race conſider as authour of one of the beſt books upon it, panted on to ninety, as was ſuppoſed; and why were we content with ſuppoſing a fact ſo intereſting, of a man ſo conſpicuous, becauſe he corrupted, at perhaps ſeventy or eighty, the regiſter, that he might paſs for younger than he was? He was not much leſs than eighty, when to a man of rank who modeſtly aſked him his age, he anſwered, 'Go look;' though he was in general a man of civility and elegance.</p>
                  <p>The ladies, I find, are at your houſe all well, except Miſs Langton, who will probably ſoon recover her health by light ſuppers. Let her eat at dinner as ſhe will, but not take a full ſtomach to bed. Pay my ſincere reſpects to the two principal ladies in your houſe; and when you write to dear Miſs Langton in Lincolnſhire, let her know that I mean not to break our league of friendſhip, and that I have a ſet of Lives for her, when I have the means of ſending it.</p>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <p>April 8. I am ſtill diſturbed by my cough; but what thanks have I not to pay, when my cough is the moſt painful ſenſation that I feel? and from that I expect hardly to be releaſed, while winter continues to gripe us with ſo much pertinacity. The year has now advanced eighteen days beyond the equinox, and ſtill there is very little remiſſion of the cold. When warm weather comes, which ſurely muſt come at laſt, I hope it will help both me and your young lady.</p>
                  <p>The man ſo buſy about addreſſes is neither more nor leſs than our own Boſwell, who had come as far as York towards London, but turned back on the diſſolution, and is ſaid now to ſtand for ſome place. Whether to wiſh him ſucceſs, his beſt friends heſitate.</p>
                  <p>Let me have your prayers for the completion of my recovery: I am now better than I ever expected to have been. May GOD add to his mercies the grace that may enable me to uſe them according to his will. My com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliments to all.</p>

When you are a little older, I hope you will be very diligent in learning arithmetick; and, above all, that through your whole life you will carefully ſay your prayers, and read your bible.</p>

               <p>On Wedneſday, May 5, I arrived in London, and next morning had the pleaſure to find Dr. Johnſon greatly recovered. I but juſt ſaw him; for a coach was waiting to carry him to Iſlington, to the houſe of his friend the Reverend Mr. Strahan, where he went ſometimes for the benefit of good air, which, notwithſtanding his having formerly laughed at the general opinion upon the ſubject, he now acknowledged was conducive to health.</p>
               <p>One morning afterwards, when I found him alone, he communicated to me, with ſolemn earneſtneſs, a very remarkable circumſtance which had happened in the courſe of his illneſs, when he was much diſtreſſed by the dropſy. He had ſhut himſelf up, and employed a day in particular exerciſes
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:0548300102:491" rendition="simple:additions"/>
of religion,—faſting, humiliation, and prayer. On a ſudden he obtained  extraordinary relief, for which he looked up to heaven with grateful devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He made no direct inference from this fact; but from his manner of telling it, I could perceive that it appeared to him as ſomething more than an incident in the common courſe of events. For my own part, I have no difficulty to avow that caſt of thinking, which by many modern pretenders to wiſdom, is called <hi>ſuperſtitious.</hi> But here I think even men of pretty dry rationality may believe, that there was an intermediate interpoſition of divine Providence, and that <q rend="inline">"the fervent prayer of this righteous man"</q> availed <note n="8" place="bottom">
                     <p>Upon this ſubject there is a very fair and judicious remark in the Life of Dr. Abernethy, in the firſt edition of the <hi>Biographia Britannica,</hi> which I ſhould have been glad to ſee in his Life which has been written for the ſecond edition of that valuable work. <q rend="inline">"To deny the exerciſe of a particular providence in the Deity's government of the world is certainly impious: yet nothing ſerves the cauſe of the ſcorner more than an incautious forward zeal in determining the particular inſtances of it."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>In confirmation of my ſentiments, I am alſo happy to quote that ſenſible and elegant writer Mr. <hi>Melmoth,</hi> in Letter VIII. of his collection, publiſhed under the name of <hi>Fitzoſborne.</hi> 
                        <q rend="inline">"We may ſafely aſſert, that the belief of a particular Providence is founded upon ſuch probable reaſons as may well juſtify our aſſent. It would fcarce, therefore, be wiſe to renounce an opinion which affords ſo firm a ſupport to the ſoul, in thoſe ſeaſons wherein ſhe ſtands in moſt need of aſſiſtance, merely becauſe it is not poſſible, in queſtions of this kind, to ſolve every difficulty which attends them."</q>

               <p>On Sunday, May 9, I found Colonel Vallancy, the celebrated antiquarian and engineer of Ireland, with him. On Monday the 10th I dined with him at Mr. Paradiſe's, where was a large company; Mr. Bryant, Mr. Joddrel, Mr. Hawkins Browne, &amp;c. On Thurſday the 13th I dined with him at Mr. Joddrel's, with another large company; the Biſhop of Exeter, Lord Monboddo <note n="9" place="bottom">I was ſorry to obſerve Lord Monboddo avoid any communication with Dr. Johnſon. I flattered myſelf that I had made them very good friends, (ſee <q rend="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</q> third edition, page 67,) but unhappily his Lordſhip had reſumed and cheriſhed a violent prejudice againſt my illuſtrious friend, to whom I muſt do the juſtice to ſay, there was on his part not the leaſt anger, but a good-humoured ſportiveneſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Nay, though he knew of his Lordſhip's diſpoſition towards him, he was even kindly; as appeared from his inquiring of me after him, by an abbreviation of his name, <q rend="inline">"Well, how does <hi>Monny</hi>!"</q>
                  </note>, Mr. Murphy, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>On Saturday, May 15, I dined with him at Dr. Brockleſby's, where were Colonel Vallancy, Mr. Murphy, and that ever-cheerful companion Mr. Devaynes, apothecary to his Majeſty. Of theſe days, and others on which I ſaw him, I have no memorials, except the general recollection of his being able and animated in converſation, and appearing to reliſh ſociety as much as the youngeſt man.
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:0548300102:492" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 I find only theſe three ſmall particulars:—One, when a perſon was mentioned who ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I have lived fifty-one years in this world without having had ten minutes of uneaſineſs;"</q> he exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"The man who ſays ſo lies. He attempts to impoſe on human credulity."</q> The Biſhop of Exeter in vain obſerved, that men were very different. His Lordſhip's manner was not impreſſive, and I learnt afterwards that Johnſon did not find out that the perſon who talked to him was a Prelate; if he had, I doubt not that he would have treated him with more reſpect; for once talking of George Pſalmanazar, whom he reverenced for his piety, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I ſhould as ſoon think of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting a biſhop."</q> One of the company provoked him greatly by doing what he could leaſt of all bear, which was quoting ſomething of his own writing, againſt what he then maintained. <q rend="inline">"What, Sir, (cried the gentleman,) do you ſay to
<q>
                        <l>'The buſy day, the peaceful night,</l>
                        <l>'Unfelt, uncounted, glided by?"</l>
                     </q>
                  </q>
Johnſon having thus had himſelf preſented as giving an inſtance of a man who had lived without uneaſineſs was much offended, for he looked upon ſuch quotation as unfair. His anger burſt out in an unjuſtifiable retort, inſinuating that the gentleman's remark was a ſally of ebriety; <q rend="inline">"Sir, there is one paſſion I would adviſe you to command. When you have drunk out that glaſs, don't drink another."</q> Here was exemplified what Goldſmith ſaid of him, with the aid of a very witty image from one of Cibber's Comedies, <q rend="inline">"There is no arguing with Johnſon; for if his piſtol miſſes fire, he knocks you down with the butt end of it."</q>—Another, when a gentleman of eminence in the literary world was violently cenſured for attacking people by anonymous paragraphs in news-papers; he, from the ſpririt of contradiction as I thought, took up his defence, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Come, come, this is not ſo terrible a crime; he means only to vex them a little. I do not ſay that I ſhould do it; but there is a great difference between him and me; what is fit for Hephaeſtion is not fit for Alexander."</q>—Another, when I told him that a young and handſome Counteſs had ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"I ſhould think that to be praiſed by Dr. Johnſon would make one a fool all one's life;"</q> and that I anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Madam, I ſhall make him a fool to-day, by repeating this to him,"</q> he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I am too old to be made a fool; but if you ſay I am, I ſhall not deny it. I am much pleaſed with a compliment, eſpecially from a pretty woman."</q>

               <p>On the evening of Saturday, May 15, he was in fine ſpirits, at our Eſſex-Head-Club. He told us, <q rend="inline">"I dined yeſterday at Mrs. Garrick's, with Mrs.

Carter, Miſs Hannah More, and Miſs Fanny Burney. Three ſuch women are not  to be found. I know not where I could find a fourth, except Mrs. Lennox, who is ſuperiour to them all."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"What! had you them all to yourſelf, Sir?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I had them all as much as they were had; but it might have been better had there been more company there."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Might not Mrs. Montagu have been a fourth?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, Mrs. Montagu does not make a trade of her wit. But Mrs. Montagu is a very extraordinary woman; ſhe has a conſtant ſtream of converſation, and it is always impregnated; it has always meaning."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Mr. Burke has a conſtant ſtream of converſation."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; if a man were to go by chance at the ſame time with Burke under a ſhed, to ſhun a ſhower, he would ſay this is an extraordinary man. If Burke ſhould go into a ſtable to ſee his horſe dreſt, the oſtler would ſay we have had an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary man here."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Foote was a man who never failed in converſation. If he had gone into a ſtable—"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, if he had gone into a ſtable, the oſtler would have ſaid here has been a comical fellow; but he would not have reſpected him."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"And, Sir, the oſtler would have anſwered him, would have given him as good as he brought, as the common ſaying is."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; and Foote would have anſwered the oſtler.—When Burke does not deſcend to be merry, his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation is very ſuperiour indeed. There is no proportion between the powers which he ſhews in ſerious talk and in jocularity. When he lets himſelf down to that, he is in the kennel."</q> I have in another place<note n="1" place="bottom">

Mr. Windham now ſaid low to me, that he differed from our great friend in this obſervation; for that Mr. Burke was often very happy in his merriment. It would not have been right for either of us to have contradicted Johnſon at this time, in a Society all of whom did not know and value Mr. Burke as much as we did. It might have occaſioned ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more rough, and at any rate would probably have checked the flow of Johnſon's good-humour. He called to us with a ſudden air of exultation, as the thought ſtarted into his mind, <q rend="inline">"O! Gentlemen, I muſt tell you a very great thing. The Empreſs of Ruſſia has ordered the 'Rambler' to be tranſlated into the Ruſſian language <note n="2" place="bottom">I have ſince heard that the report was not well-founded; but the elation diſcovered by Johnſon in the belief that it was true, ſhewed a noble ardour for literary fame.</note>. So I ſhall be read on the banks of

 the Wolga. Horace boaſts that his fame would extend as far as the banks of the Rhone; now the Wolga is farther from me than the Rhone was from Horace."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"You muſt certainly be pleaſed with this, Sir."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I am pleaſed, Sir, to be ſure. A man is pleaſed to find he has ſucceeded in that which he has endeavoured to do."</q>
               </p>
               <p>One of the company mentioned his having ſeen a noble perſon driving in his carriage, and looking exceedingly well, notwithſtanding his great age. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Ah, Sir; that is nothing. Bacon obſerves, that a ſtout healthy old man is like a tower undermined."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Sunday, May 16, I found him alone; he talked of Mrs. Thrale with much concern, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Sir, ſhe has done every thing wrong, ſince Thrale's bridle was off her neck;"</q> and was proceeding to mention ſome circumſtances which have ſince been the ſubject of publick diſcuſſion, when he was inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by the arrival of Dr. Douglas, now Biſhop of Carliſle.</p>
               <p>Dr. Douglas, upon this occaſion, refuted a miſtaken notion which is very common in Scotland, that the eccleſiaſtical diſcipline of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, though duly enforced, is inſufficient to preſerve the morals of the clergy, inaſmuch as all delinquents may be ſcreened by appealing to the Convocation, which being never authorized by the King to ſit for the diſpatch of buſineſs, the appeal never can be heard. Dr. Douglas obſerved, that this was founded upon ignorance; for that the Biſhops have ſufficient power to maintain diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and that the ſitting of the Convocation was wholly immaterial in this reſpect, it being not a Court of judicature, but like a parliament, to make Canons and regulations as times may require.</p>
               <p>Johnſon, talking of the fear of death, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Some people are not afraid, becauſe they look upon ſalvation as the effect of an abſolute decree, and think they feel in themſelves the marks of ſanctification. Others, and thoſe the moſt rational in my opinion, look upon ſalvation as conditional; and as they never can be ſure that they have complied with the conditions, they are afraid."</q>
               </p>
               <p>In one of his little manuſcript diaries, about this time, I find a ſhort notice, which marks his amiable diſpoſition more certainly than a thouſand ſtudied declarations.—<q rend="inline">"Afternoon ſpent cheerfully and elegantly, I hope without offence to GOD or man; though in no holy duty, yet in the general exerciſe and cultivation of benevolence."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Monday, May 17, I dined with him at Mr. Dilly's, where were Colonel Vallancy, Reverend Dr. Gibbons, and Mr. Capel Lofft, who, though a moſt zealous Whig, has a mind ſo full of learning and knowledge, and ſo
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:0548300102:495" rendition="simple:additions"/>
much in exerciſe in various exertions, and withal ſo much liberality, that  the ſtupendous powers of the literary Goliath, though they did not frighten this little David of popular ſpirit, could not but excite his admiration. There was alſo Mr. Braithwaite of the Poſt-office, that amiable and friendly man, who, with modeſt and unaſſuming manners, has aſſociated with many of the wits of the age. Johnſon was very quieſcent to-day. Perhaps too I was indolent. I find nothing more of him in my notes, but that when I mentioned that I had ſeen in the King's library ſixty-three editions of my favourite Thomas à Kempis, amongſt which it was in eight languages, Latin, German, French, Italian, Spaniſh, Engliſh, Arabick, and Armenian, he ſaid, he thought it unneceſſary to collect many editions of a book, which were all the ſame, except as to the paper and print; he would have the original, and all the tranſlations, and all the editions which had any variations in the text. He approved of the famous collection of editions of Horace by Douglas, mentioned by Pope, who is ſaid to have had a cloſet filled with them; and he ſaid, every man ſhould try to collect one book in that manner, and preſent it to a publick library.</p>
               <p>On Tueſday, May 17, I ſaw him for a ſhort time in the morning. I told him that the mob had called out, as the King paſſed, <q rend="inline">"No Fox—No Fox,"</q> which I did not like. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"They were right, Sir."</q> I ſaid, I thought not, for it ſeemed to be making Mr. Fox the King's competitor. There being no audience, ſo that there could be no triumph in a victory, he fairly agreed with me. I ſaid it might do very well, if explained thus: <q rend="inline">"Let us have no Fox;"</q> underſtanding it as a prayer to his Majeſty not to appoint that gentleman miniſter.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, May 19, I ſat a part of the evening with him, by ourſelves. I obſerved, that the death of our friends might be a conſolation againſt the fear of our own diſſolution, becauſe we might have more friends in the other world than in this. He perhaps felt this as a reflection upon his apprehenſion as to death; and ſaid, with heat, <q rend="inline">"How can a man know <hi>where</hi> his departed friends are, or whether they will be his friends in the other world. How many friendſhips have you known formed upon principles of virtue? Moſt friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips are formed by caprice or by chance, mere confederacies in vice or leagues in folly."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of our worthy friend Mr. Langton. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I know not who will go to Heaven if Langton does not. Sir, I could almoſt ſay, <hi>Sit anima mea cum Langtono.</hi>"</q> I mentioned a very eminent friend as a virtuous man. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; but—has not the evangelical virtue of Langton.—, I am afraid, would not ſcruple to pick up a wench."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="494" facs="tcp:0548300102:496" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 He however charged Mr. Langton with what he thought want of judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon an intereſting occaſion. <q rend="inline">"When I was ill (ſaid he) I deſired he would tell me ſincerely in what he thought my life was faulty. Sir, he brought me a ſheet of paper, on which he had written down ſeveral texts of Scripture, recommending chriſtian charity. And when I queſtioned him what occaſion I had given for ſuch an animadverſion, all that he could ſay amounted to this—that I ſometimes contradicted people in converſation. Now what harm does it do to any man to be contradicted?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I ſuppoſe he meant the <hi>manner</hi> of doing it; roughly—and harſhly."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"And who is the worſe for that?"</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"It hurts people of weak nerves."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I know no ſuch weak-nerved people."</q> Mr. Burke, to whom I related this conference, ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is well, if when a man comes to die, he has nothing heavier upon his conſcience than having been a little rough in converſation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon, at the time when the paper was preſented to him, though at firſt pleaſed with the attention of his friend, whom he thanked in an earneſt manner, ſoon exclaimed, in a loud and angry tone, <q rend="inline">"What is your drift, Sir?"</q> Sir Joſhua Reynolds pleaſantly obſerved, that it was a ſcene for a comedy, to ſee a penitent get into a violent paſſion and belabour his confeſſor <note n="3" place="bottom">After all, I cannot but be of opinion, that as Mr. Langton was ſeriouſly requeſted by Dr. Johnſon to mention what appeared to him erroneous in the character of his friend, he was bound, as an honeſt man, to intimate what he really thought, which he certainly did in the moſt delicate manner; ſo that Johnſon himſelf, when in a quiet frame, was pleaſed with it. The texts ſuggeſted are now before me, and I ſhall quote a few of them. <q rend="inline">"Bleſſed are the meek, for they ſhall inherit the earth."</q> 
                     <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 5.—<q rend="inline">"I therefore, the priſoner of the LORD, beſeech you, that ye walk worthy of the vocation wherewith ye are called. With all lowlineſs and meekneſs, with long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in love."</q> 
                     <hi>Epheſ.</hi> v. 1, 2.—<q rend="inline">"And above all theſe things put on charity, which is the bond of perfectneſs."</q> 
                     <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 14.—<q rend="inline">"Charity ſuffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not, charity vaunteth not itſelf, is not puffed up: doth not behave itſelf unſeemly, is not eaſily provoked."</q> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 4, 5.</note>.</p>
               <p>I have preſerved no more of his converſation at the times when I ſaw him during the reſt of this month, till Sunday, the 30th of May, when I met him in the evening at Mr. Hoole's, where there was a large company both of ladies and gentlemen; Sir James Johnſton happened to ſay, that he paid no regard to the arguments of counſel at the bar of the Houſe of Commons, becauſe they were paid for ſpeaking. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, argument is argument. You cannot help paying regard to their arguments if they are good. If it were teſtimony you might diſregard it, if you knew that it were purchaſed. There is a beautiful image in Bacon upon this ſubject; teſtimony
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:0548300102:497" rendition="simple:additions"/>
is like an arrow ſhot from a long bow; the force of it depends on the ſtrength  of the hand that draws it. Argument is like an arrow from a croſs-bow, which has equal force though ſhot by a child."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He had dined that day at Mr. Hoole's, and Miſs Helen Maria Williams being expected in the evening, Mr. Hoole put into his hands her beautiful <q rend="inline">"Ode on the Peace <note n="4" place="bottom">The Peace made by that very able ſtateſman, the Earl of Shelburne, now Marquis of Lanſdowne, which may fairly be conſidered as the foundation of all the proſperity of Great-Britain ſince that time.</note>;"</q> Johnſon read it over, and when this amiable, elegant, and accompliſhed young lady was preſented to him, he took her by the hand in the moſt courteous manner, and repeated the fineſt ſtanza of her poem; this was the moſt delicate and pleaſing compliment he could pay. Her reſpectable friend, Dr. Kippis, from whom I had this anecdote, was ſtanding by, and was not a little gratified.</p>
               <p>Miſs Williams told me, that the only other time ſhe was fortunate enough to be in Dr. Johnſon's company, he aſked her to ſit down by him, which ſhe did, and upon her enquiring how he was, he anſwered, <q rend="inline">"I am very ill indeed, Madam. I am very ill even when you are near me; what ſhould I be were you at a diſtance."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He had now a great deſire to go to Oxford, as his firſt jaunt after his illneſs; we talked of it for ſome days, and I had promiſed to accompany him. He was impatient and fretful to-night, becauſe I did not at once agree to go with him on Thurſday. When I conſidered how ill he had been, and what allowance ſhould be made for the influence of ſickneſs upon his temper, I reſolved to indulge him, though with ſome inconvenience to myſelf, as I wiſhed to attend the muſical meeting in honour of Handel, in Weſtminſter-Abbey, on the following Saturday.</p>
               <p>In the midſt of his own diſeaſes and pains, he was ever compaſſionate to the diſtreſſes of others, and actively earneſt in procuring them aid, as appears from a note to Sir Joſhua Reynolds, of June 1, in theſe words: <q rend="inline">"I am aſhamed to aſk for ſome relief for a poor man, to whom, I hope, I have given what I can be expected to ſpare. The man importunes me, and the blow goes round. I am going to try another air on Thurſday."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Thurſday, June 3, the Oxford poſt-coach took us up in the morning at Bolt-court. The other two paſſengers were Mrs. Beresford and her daughter, two very agreeable ladies from America; they were going to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſterſhire, where they then reſided. Frank had been ſent by his maſter the day before to take places for us; and I found from the way-bill, that Dr. Johnſon had made our names be put down. Mrs. Beresford, who had read
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:0548300102:498" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 it, whiſpered me, <q rend="inline">"Is this the great Dr. Johnſon?"</q> I told her it was; ſo ſhe was then prepared to liſten. As ſhe ſoon happened to mention in a voice ſo low that Johnſon did not hear it, that her huſband had been a member of the American Congreſs, I cautioned her to beware of introducing that ſubject, as ſhe muſt know how very violent Johnſon was againſt the people of that country. He talked a great deal, but I am ſorry I have preſerved little of the converſation. Miſs Beresford was ſo much charmed, that ſhe ſaid to me aſide, <q rend="inline">"How he does talk! Every ſentence is an eſſay."</q> She amuſed herſelf in the coach with knotting; he would ſcarcely allow this ſpecies of employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment any merit. <q rend="inline">"Next to mere idleneſs (ſaid he) I think knotting is to be reckoned in the ſcale of inſignificance; though I once attempted to learn knotting. Dempſter's ſiſter (looking to me) endeavoured to teach me it; but I made no progreſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I was ſurpriſed at his talking without reſerve in the publick poſt-coach of the ſtate of his affairs; <q rend="inline">"I have (ſaid he) about the world I think above a thouſand pounds, which I intend ſhall afford Frank an annuity of ſeventy pounds a year."</q>
               </p>
               <p>At the inn where we ſtopped he was exceedingly diſſatisfied with ſome roaſt mutton which we had for dinner. The ladies I ſaw wondered to ſee the great philoſopher, whoſe wiſdom and wit they had been admiring all the way, get into ill-humour from ſuch a cauſe.

               <p>He bore the journey very well, and ſeemed to feel himſelf elevated as he approached Oxford, that magnificent and venerable ſeat of Learning, Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy, and Toryiſm. Frank came in the heavy coach, in readineſs to attend him; and we were received with the moſt polite hoſpitality at the houſe of his old friend Dr. Adams, Maſter of Pembroke College, who had given us a kind invitation. Before we were ſet down, I communicated to Johnſon my having engaged to return to London directly, for the reaſon I have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, but that I would haſten down to him again. He was pleaſed that I had made this journey merely to keep him company. He was eaſy and placid, with Dr. Adams, Mrs. and Miſs Adams, and Mrs. Kennicot, widow of the learned Hebraean, who was here on a viſit. He ſoon diſpatched the inquiries which were made about his illneſs and recovery, by a ſhort and diſtinct narrative; and then aſſuming a gay air, repeated from Swift,

Dr. Newton, the Biſhop of Briſtol, having been mentioned, Johnſon,  recollecting the manner in which he had been mentioned by that Prelate <note n="4" place="bottom">Dr. Newton in his Account of his own Life, after animadverting upon Mr. Gibbon's Hiſtory, ſays, <q rend="inline">"Dr. Johnſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'Lives of the Poets' afforded more amuſement; but candour was much hurt and offended at the malevolence that predominates in every part. Some paſſages, it muſt be allowed, are judicious and well written, but make not ſufficient compenſation for ſo much ſpleen and ill humour. Never was any biographer more ſparing of his praiſe, or more abundant in his cenſures. He ſeemingly delights more in expoſing blemiſhes, than in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending beauties; ſlightly paſſes over excellencies, enlarges upon imperfections, and not content with his own ſevere reflections, revives old ſcandal, and produces large quotations from the forgotten works of former criticks. His reputation was ſo high in the republick of letters, that it wanted not to be raiſed upon the ruins of others. But theſe Eſſays, inſtead of raiſing a higher idea than was before entertained of his underſtanding, have certainly given the world a worſe opinion of his temper."</q> The Biſhop was therefore the more ſurprized and concerned for his townſman, for <hi>he</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">"reſpected him not only for his genius and learning, but valued him much more for the more amiable part of his character, his humanity and charity, his morality and religion."</q> The laſt ſentence we may conſider as the general and permanent opinion of Biſhop Newton; the remarks which precede it muſt, by all who have read Johnſon's admirable work, be imputed to the diſguſt and peeviſhneſs of old age. I wiſh it had not appeared, and that Dr. Johnſon had not been provoked by it to expreſs himſelf, not in reſpectful terms, of a Prelate, whoſe labours were certainly of conſiderable advantage both to literature and religion.</note>, thus retaliated:—<q rend="inline">"Tom knew he ſhould be dead before what he has ſaid of me would appear. He durſt not have printed it while he was alive."</q> DR. ADAMS. <q rend="inline">"I believe his 'Diſſertations on the Prophecies' is his great work."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, it is <hi>Tom's</hi> great work; but how far it is great, or how much of it is Tom's, are other queſtions. I fancy a conſiderable part of it was borrowed."</q> DR. ADAMS. <q rend="inline">"He was a very ſucceſsful man."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I don't think ſo, Sir.—He did not get very high. He was late in getting what he did get; and he did not get it by the beſt means. I believe he was a groſs flatterer."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I fulfilled my intention by going to London, and returned to Oxford on Wedneſday the 9th of June, when I was happy to find myſelf again in the ſame agreeable circle at Pembroke College, with the comfortable proſpect of making ſome ſtay. Johnſon welcomed my return with more than ordinary glee.</p>
               <p>He talked with great regard of the Honourable Archibald Campbell, whoſe character he had given at the Duke of Argyll's table, when we were at Inveraray <note n="5" place="bottom">
                     <q rend="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</q> 3d edit. p. 371.</note>; and at this time wrote out for me, in his own hand, a fuller account of that learned and venerable writer, which I have publiſhed in its
<pb n="498" facs="tcp:0548300102:500" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 proper place. Johnſon made a remark this evening which ſtruck me a good deal. <q rend="inline">"I never (ſaid he) knew a nonjuror who could reaſon."</q> Surely he did not mean to deny that faculty to many of their writers; to Hickes, Brett, and other eminent divines of that perſuaſion; and did not recollect that the ſeven Biſhops, ſo juſtly celebrated for their magnanimous reſiſtance of arbitrary power, were yet Nonjurors to the new Government. The non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juring clergy of Scotland, indeed, who, excepting a few, have lately, by a ſudden ſtroke, cut off all ties of allegiance to the houſe of Stuart, and reſolved to pray for our preſent lawful Sovereign by name, may be thought to have confirmed this remark; as it may be ſaid, that the divine indefeaſible hereditary right which they profeſſed to believe, if ever true, muſt be equally true ſtill. Many of my readers will be ſurprized when I mention, that Johnſon aſſured me he had never in his life been in a nonjuring meeting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe.</p>
               <p>Next morning at breakfaſt, he pointed out a paſſage in Savage's <q rend="inline">"Wanderer,"</q> ſaying, <q rend="inline">"Theſe are fine verſes."</q>—<q rend="inline">"If (ſaid he) I had written with hoſtility of Warburton in my Shakſpeare, I ſhould have quoted this couplet:
<q>
                        <l>'Here Learning, blinded firſt, and then beguil'd,</l>
                        <l>'Looks dark as Ignorance, as Fancy wild.'</l>
                     </q>
You ſee they'd have fitted him to a <hi>T,</hi>"</q> (ſmiling). DR. ADAMS. <q rend="inline">"But you did not write againſt Warburton."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir, I treated him with great reſpect both in my Preface and in my Notes."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Kennicot ſpoke of her brother, the Reverend Mr. Chamberlayne, who had given up good preferments in the Church of England on his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the Roman Catholick faith. Johnſon, who warmly admired every man who acted from a conſcientious regard to principle, erroneous or not, exclaimed ſervently, <q rend="inline">"GOD bleſs him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mrs. Kennicot, in confirmation of Dr. Johnſon's opinion, that the preſent was not worſe than former ages, mentioned that her brother aſſured her, there was now leſs infidelity on the Continent than there had been; Voltaire and Rouſſeau were leſs read. I aſſerted, from good authority, that Hume's infidelity was certainly leſs read. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"All infidel writers drop into oblivion, when perſonal connections and the floridneſs of novelty are gone; though now and then a fooliſh fellow, who thinks he can be witty upon them, may bring them again into notice.

the world. To ſuch defenders of Religion I would apply a ſtanza of a poem  which I remember to have ſeen in ſome old collection:
<q>
                        <lg>
                           <l>'Henceforth be quiet and agree,</l>

A good man, of a timorous diſpoſition, in great doubt of his acceptance with GOD, and pretty credulous, might be glad to be of a church where there are ſo many helps to get to Heaven. I would be a Papiſt if I could. I have fear enough; but an obſtinate rationality prevents me. I ſhall never be a Papiſt, unleſs on the near approach of death, of which I have a very great terrour.

               <p>He argued in defence of ſome of the peculiar tenets of the Church of Rome. As to the giving the bread only to the laity, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"They may think, that in what is merely ritual, deviations from the primitive mode may be admitted

                     <p>The Sermon thus opens:—<q rend="inline">"That there are angels and ſpirits good and bad; that at the head of theſe laſt there is ONE more conſiderable and malignant than the reſt, who in the form, or under the name of a <hi>ſerpent,</hi> was deeply concerned in the fall of man, and whoſe <hi>head,</hi> as the prophetick language is, the ſon of man was one day to <hi>bruiſe;</hi> that this evil ſpirit, though that prophecy be in part completed, has not yet received his death's wound, but is ſtill permitted, for ends unſearchable to us, and in ways which we cannot particularly explain, to have a certain degree of power in this world hoſtile to its virtue and happineſs, and ſometimes exerted with too much ſucceſs; all this is ſo clear from Scripture, that no believer, unleſs he be firſt of all <hi>ſpoiled by philoſophy and vain deceit,</hi> can poſſibly entertain a doubt of it."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Having treated of <hi>poſſeſſions,</hi> his Lordſhip ſays, <q rend="inline">"As I have no authority to affirm that there <hi>are</hi> now any ſuch, ſo neither may I preſume to ſay with confidence, that there are <hi>not</hi> any."</q>

                        <q rend="inline">"But then with regard to the influence of evil ſpirits at this day upon the SOULS of men, I ſhall take leave to be a great deal more peremptory.—[Then, having ſtated the various proofs], All this I ſay is ſo manifeſt to every one who reads the Scriptures, that if we reſpect their authority, the queſtion concerning the reality of the demonick influence upon the minds of men is clearly determined."</q>

                     <p>Let it be remembered, that theſe are not the words of an antiquated or obſcure enthuſiaſt, but of a learned and polite Prelate now alive; and were ſpoken, not to a vulgar congregation, but to the Honourable Society of Lincoln's-Inn. His Lordſhip in this Sermon explains the words, <q rend="inline">"deliver us from evil,"</q> in the Lord's Prayer, as ſignifying a requeſt to be protected from <q rend="inline">"the evil one,"</q> that is, the Devil. This is well illuſtrated in a ſhort but excellent Commentary by my late worthy friend, the Reverend Dr. Lort, of whom it may truly be ſaid, <hi>Multis ille bonis flebilis occidit.</hi> It is remarkable that Waller in his <q rend="inline">"Reflections on the ſeveral Petitions,"</q> in that ſacred form of devotion, has underſtood this in the ſame ſenſe,

               <p>After dinner, when one of us talked of there being a great enmity between Whig and Tory. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why not ſo much, I think, unleſs when they come into competition with each other. There is none when they are only common acquaintance, none when they are of different ſexes. A Tory will marry into a Whig family, and a Whig into a Tory family, without any reluctance. But indeed in a matter of much more concern than political tenets, and that is religion, men and women do not concern themſelves much about difference of opinion. And ladies ſet no value on the moral character of men who pay their addreſſes to them; the greateſt profligate will be as well received as the man of the greateſt virtue, and this by a very good woman, by a woman who ſays her prayers three times a day."</q> Our ladies endeavoured to defend their ſex from this charge; but he roared them down! <q rend="inline">"No, no; a lady will take Jonathan Wild as readily as St. Auſtin, if he has three-pence more; and, what is worſe, her parents will give her to him. Women have a perpetual envy of our vices; they are leſs vicious than we, not from choice, but becauſe we reſtrict them; they are the ſlaves of order and faſhion; their virtue is of more conſequence to us than our own, ſo far as concerns this world."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Miſs Adams mentioned a gentleman of licentious character, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Suppoſe I had a mind to marry that gentleman, would my parents conſent."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, they'd conſent, and you'd go. You'd go though they did not conſent."</q> MISS ADAMS. <q rend="inline">"Perhaps their oppoſing might make me go."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"O, very well; you'd take one whom you think a bad man, to have the pleaſure of vexing your parents. You put me in mind of Dr. Barrowby the phyſician, who was very fond of ſwine's fleſh. One day when he was eating it, he ſaid, 'I wiſh I was a Jew.'—'Why, ſo? (ſaid ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body); the Jews are not allowed to eat your favourite meat.'—'Becauſe (ſaid he) I ſhould then have the guſt of eating it, with the pleaſure of ſinning."</q> He then proceeded in his declamation.</p>
               <p>Miſs Adams ſoon afterwards made an obſervation that I do not recollect, which pleaſed him much; he ſaid with a good-humoured ſmile, <q rend="inline">"That there ſhould be ſo much excellence united with ſo much depravity is ſtrange."</q>

 Indeed, this lady's good qualities, merit, and accompliſhments, and her conſtant attention to Dr. Johnſon, were not loſt upon him. She happened to tell him that a little coffee-pot, in which ſhe had made his coffee, was the only thing ſhe could call her own. He turned to her with a complacent gallantry, <q rend="inline">"Don't ſay ſo, my dear<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I hope you don't reckon my heart as nothing."</q>

               <p>I aſked him if it was true as reported, that he had ſaid lately, <q rend="inline">"I am for the King againſt Fox; but I am for Fox againſt Pitt."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; the King is my maſter; but I do not know Pitt; and Fox is my friend."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Fox (added he) is a moſt extraordinary man; here is a man (deſcribing him in ſtrong terms of objection in ſome reſpects according as he appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, but which exalted his abilities the more) who has divided the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom with Caeſar; ſo that it was a doubt whether the nation ſhould be ruled by the ſceptre of George the Third, or the tongue of Fox."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Wall, phyſician at Oxford, drank tea with us. Johnſon had in general a peculiar pleaſure in the company of phyſicians, which was certainly not abated by the converſation of this learned, ingenious, and pleaſing gentleman. Johnſon ſaid, <q rend="inline">"It is wonderful how little good Radcliffe's travelling fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips have done. I know nothing that has been imported by them; yet many additions to our medical knowledge might be got in foreign countries. Inoculation, for inſtance, has ſaved more lives than war deſtroys. And the cures performed by the Peruvian-bark are innumerable. But it is in vain to ſend our travelling phyſicians to France, and Italy, and Germany, for all that is known there is known here; I'd ſend them out of Chriſtendom; I'd ſend them among barbarous nations."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Friday, June 11, we talked at breakfaſt, of forms of prayer. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I know of no good prayers but thoſe in the 'Book of Common Prayer."</q> DR. ADAMS. (in a very earneſt manner) <q rend="inline">"I wiſh, Sir, you would compoſe ſome family prayers."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I will not compoſe prayers for you, Sir, becauſe you can do it for yourſelf. But I have thought of getting together all the books of prayers which I could, ſelecting thoſe which ſhould appear to me the beſt, putting out ſome, inſerting others, adding ſome prayers of my own, and prefixing a diſcourſe on prayer."</q> We all now gathered about him, and two or three of us at a time joined in preſſing him to execute this plan. He ſeemed to be a little diſpleaſed at the manner of our importunity, and in great agitation called out, <q rend="inline">"Do not talk thus of what is ſo aweful. I know not what time GOD will allow me in this world. There are many

things which I wiſh to do."</q> Some of us perſiſted, and Dr. Adams ſaid,  <q rend="inline">"I never was more ſerious about any thing in my life."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Let me alone, let me alone; I am overpowered."</q> And then he put his hands before his face, and reclined for ſome time upon the table.</p>
               <p>I mentioned Jeremy Taylor's uſing, in his forms of prayer, <q rend="inline">"I am the chief of ſinners,"</q> and other ſuch ſelf-condemning expreſſions. <q rend="inline">"Now (ſaid I) this cannot be ſaid with truth by every man, and therefore is improper for a general printed form. I myſelf cannot ſay that I am the worſt of men. I <hi>will</hi> not ſay ſo."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"A man may know, that phyſically, that is, in the real ſtate of things, he is not the worſt man; but that morally he may be ſo. Law obſerves, that 'Every man knows ſomething worſe of himſelf, than he is ſure of in others.' You may not have committed ſuch crimes as ſome men have done; but you do not know againſt what degree of light they have ſinned. Beſides, Sir, 'the chief of ſinners' is a mode of expreſſion for 'I am a great ſinner.' So St. Paul, ſpeaking of our SAVIOUR's having died to ſave ſinners, ſays, 'of whom I am the chief:' yet he certainly did not think himſelf ſo bad as Judas Iſcariot."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But, Sir, Taylor means it literally, for he founds a conceit upon it. When praying for the converſion of ſinners, and of himſelf in particular, he ſays, 'LORD, thou wilt not leave thy <hi>chief</hi> work undone."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I do not approve of figurative expreſſions in addreſſing the Supreme Being; and I never uſe them. Taylor gives a very good advice: 'Never lie in your prayers; never confeſs more than you really believe; never promiſe more than you mean to perform."</q> I recollected this precept in his <q rend="inline">"Golden Grove."</q> But his <hi>example</hi> for prayer contradicts his <hi>precept.</hi>

               <p>Dr. Johnſon and I went in Dr. Adams's coach to dine with Dr. Nowell, Principal of St. Mary Hall, at his beautiful villa at Iffley, on the banks of the Iſis, about two miles from Oxford. While we were upon the road, I had the reſolution to aſk Johnſon whether he thought that the roughneſs of his manner had been an advantage or not, and if he would not have done more good if he had been more gentle? I proceeded to anſwer myſelf thus:—<q rend="inline">"Perhaps it has been of advantage, as it has given weight to what you ſaid. You could not, perhaps, have talked with ſuch authority without it."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; I have done more good as I am. Obſcenity and Impiety have always been repreſſed in my company."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"True, Sir; and that is more than can be ſaid of every Biſhop. Greater liberties have been taken in the preſence of a Biſhop, though a very good man, from his being milder, and therefore not commanding ſuch awe. Yet, Sir, many people who might
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:0548300102:506" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 have been benefited by your converſation, have been frightened away<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> A worthy friend of ours has told me, that he has often been afraid to talk to you."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, he need not have been afraid, if he had any thing rational to ſay. If he had not, it was better he did not talk."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Nowell is celebrated for having preached a ſermon before the Houſe of Commons, on the 30th of January, 1772, full of high Tory ſentiments, for which he was thanked as uſual, and printed it at their requeſt; but, in the midſt of that turbulence and faction which diſgraced a part of the preſent reign, the thanks were afterwards ordered to be expunged. This ſtrange conduct ſufficiently expoſes itſelf; and Dr. Nowell will ever have the honour which is due to a lofty friend of our monarchical conſtitution... Dr. Johnſon ſaid to me, <q rend="inline">"Sir, the Court will be very much to blame if he is not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted."</q> I told this to Dr. Nowell, and aſſerting my humbler, though not leſs zealous exertions in the ſame cauſe, I ſuggeſted that whatever return we might receive, we ſhould ſtill have the conſolation of being like Butler's ſteady and generous Royaliſt,
<q>
                     <l>"True as the dial to the ſun,</l>
                     <l>"Although it be not ſhone upon."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>We were well entertained and very happy at Dr. Nowell's, where was a very agreeable company, and we drank <q rend="inline">"Church and King"</q> after dinner, with true Tory cordiality.</p>
               <p>We talked of a certain clergyman of extraordinary character, who by exerting his talents in writing on temporary topicks, and diſplaying uncommon intrepidity, had raiſed himſelf to affluence. I maintained that we ought not to be indignant at his ſucceſs; for merit of every ſort was entitled to reward. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I will not allow this man to have merit. No, Sir; what he has is rather the contrary; I will, indeed, allow him courage, and on this account we ſo far give him credit. We have more reſpect for a man who robs boldly on the highway, than for a fellow who jumps out of a ditch, and knocks you down behind your back. Courage is a quality ſo neceſſary for maintaining virtue, that it is always reſpected, even when it is aſſociated with vice."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I cenſured the coarſe invective which was become faſhionable in the Houſe of Commons, and ſaid that if members of parliament muſt attack each other perſonally in the heat of debate, it ſhould be done more genteelly. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"No, Sir; that would be much worſe. Abuſe is not ſo dangerous when there is no vehicle of wit or delicacy, no ſubtle conveyance. The difference
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:0548300102:507" rendition="simple:additions"/>
between coarſe and refined abuſe is as the difference between being bruiſed  by a club, and wounded by a poiſoned arrow."</q> I have ſince obſerved his poſition elegantly expreſſed by Dr. Young:
<q>
                     <l>"As the ſoft plume gives ſwiftneſs to the dart,</l>
                     <l>"Good breeding ſends the ſatire to the heart."</l>

               </p>
               <p>On Saturday, June 12, there drank tea with us at Dr. Adams's, Mr. John Henderſon, ſtudent of Pembroke-College, celebrated for his wonderful acquirements in Alchymy, Judicial Aſtrology, and other abſtruſe and curious learning; and the Reverend Herbert Croſt, who I am afraid was ſomewhat mortified by Dr. Johnſon's not being highly pleaſed with ſome <q rend="inline">"Family Diſcourſes,"</q> which he had printed; they were in too familiar a ſtyle to be approved of by ſo manly a mind. I have no note of this evening's converſation, except a ſingle fragment. When I mentioned Thomas Lord Lyttelton's viſion, the prediction of the time of his death, and its exact fulfilment; JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">
                     <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>It is the moſt extraordinary thing that has happened in my day. I heard it with my own ears, from his uncle, Lord Weſtcote. I am ſo glad to have every evidence of the ſpiritual world, that I am willing to believe it."</q> Dr. ADAMS. <q rend="inline">"You have evidence enough; good evidence, which needs not ſuch ſupport."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I like to have more."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Henderſon, with whom I had ſauntered in the venerable walks of Merton-College, and found him a very learned and pious man, he ſupt with us. Dr. Johnſon ſurpriſed him not a little, by acknowledging with a look of horrour, that he was much oppreſſed by the fear of death. The amiable Dr. Adams ſuggeſted that GOD was infinitely good. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"That he is infinitely good, as far as the perfection of his nature will allow, I certainly believe; but it is neceſſary for good upon the whole, that individuals ſhould be puniſhed. As to an <hi>individual</hi> therefore, he is not infinitely good; and as I cannot be <hi>ſure</hi> that I have fulfilled the conditions on which ſalvation is granted, I am afraid I may be one of thoſe who ſhall be damned."</q> (looking diſmally). DR. ADAMS. <q rend="inline">"What do you mean by damned?"</q> JOHNSON. (paſſionately and loudly) <q rend="inline">"Sent to Hell, Sir, and puniſhed everlaſtingly."</q> DR. ADAMS. <q rend="inline">"I don't believe that doctrine."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Hold, Sir; do you believe that ſome will be puniſhed at all?"</q> DR. ADAMS. <q rend="inline">"Being excluded from Heaven will be a puniſhment; yet there may be no great poſitive ſuffering."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Well, Sir; but, if you admit any degree of puniſhment, there is an end of your argument for infinite goodneſs ſimply conſidered; for,
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:0548300102:508" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 infinite goodneſs would inflict no puniſhment whatever. There is not infinite goodneſs phyſically conſidered; morally there is."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"But may not a man attain to ſuch a degree of hope as not to be uneaſy from the fear o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               <p>From the ſubject of death we paſſed to diſcourſe of life, whether it was upon the whole more happy or miſerable. Johnſon was decidedly for the balance of miſery: in confirmation of which I maintained, that no man would chooſe to lead over again the life which he had experienced. Johnſon acceded to that opinion in the ſtrongeſt terms. This is an inquiry often made; and its being a ſubject of diſquiſition is a proof that much miſery preſſes upon human feelings; for thoſe who are conſcious of a felicity of exiſtence, would never heſitate to accept of a repetition of it. I have met with very few who would. I have heard Mr. Burke make uſe of a very ingenious and plauſible argument on this ſubject; <q rend="inline">"Every man (ſaid he) would lead his life over again; for, every man is willing to go on and take an addition to his life, which as he grows older, he has no reaſon to think will be better, or even ſo good as what has preceded."</q> I imagine, however, the truth is, that there is a deceitful hope that the next part of life will be free from the pains, and anxieties, and ſorrows which we have already felt. We are for wiſe purpoſes <q rend="inline">"Condemn'd to Hope's deluſive mine;"</q> as Johnſon finely ſays; and I may alſo quote the celebrated lines of Dryden, equally philoſophical and poetical:</p>

               <p>It was obſerved to Dr. Johnſon, that it ſeemed ſtrange that he, who has ſo often delighted his company by his lively and brilliant converſation, ſhould ſay he was miſerable. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Alas! it is all outſide; I may be cracking my joke and curſing the ſun. <hi>Sun, how I hate thy beams!</hi>"</q> I knew not well what to think of this declaration; whether to hold it as a genuine picture of his mind <note n="1" place="bottom">Yet there is no doubt that a man may appear very gay in company who is ſad at heart.

               </p>
               <p>On Sunday, June 13, our philoſopher was calm at breakfaſt. There was ſomething exceedingly pleaſing in our leading a College life, without reſtraint, and with ſuperiour elegance, in conſequence of our living in the Maſter's houſe, and having the company of ladies. Mrs. Kennicot related, in his preſence, a lively ſaying of Dr. Johnſon to Miſs Hannah More, who had expreſſed a wonder that the poet who had written <q rend="inline">"Paradiſe Loſt,"</q> ſhould write ſuch poor Sonnets:—<q rend="inline">"Milton, Madam, was a genius that could cut a Coloſſus from a rock; but could not carve heads upon cherry-ſtones."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We talked of the caſuiſtical queſtion, Whether it was allowable at any time to depart from <hi>Truth?</hi> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"The general rule is, that Truth ſhould never be violated, becauſe it is of the utmoſt importance to the comfort of life, that we ſhould have a full ſecurity by mutual faith; and occaſional incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies ſhould be willingly ſuffered that we may preſerve it. There muſt, however, be ſome exceptions. If, for inſtance, a murderer ſhould aſk you
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:0548300102:510" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 which way a man is gone, you may tell him what is not true, becauſe you are under a previous obligation not to betray a man to a murderer."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Suppoſing the perſon who wrote <hi>Junius</hi> were aſked whether he was the authour, might he deny it?"</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I don't know what to ſay to this. If you were <hi>ſure</hi> that he wrote <hi>Junius,</hi> would you, if he denied it, think as well of him afterwards? Yet it may be urged, that what a man has no right to aſk, you may refuſe to communicate; and there is no other effectual mode of preſerving a ſecret, and an important ſecret, the diſcovery of which may be very hurtful to you, but a flat denial; for if you are ſilent, or heſitate, or evade, it will be held equivalent to a confeſſion. But ſtay, Sir; here is another caſe. Suppoſing the authour had told me confidentially that he had written <hi>Junius,</hi> and I were aſked if he had, I ſhould hold myſelf at liberty to deny it, as being under a previous promiſe, expreſs or implied, to conceal it. Now what I ought to do for the authour, may I not do for myſelf? But I deny the lawfulneſs of telling a lie to a ſick man for fear of alarming him. You have no buſineſs with conſequences: you are to tell the truth. Beſides, you are not ſure what effect your telling him that he is in danger may have. It may bring his diſtemper to a criſis, and that may cure him. Of all lying I have the greateſt abhorrence at this, becauſe I believe it has been frequently practiſed on myſelf."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I cannot help thinking, that there is much weight in the opinion of thoſe who have held, that Truth, as an eternal and immutable principle, ought, upon no account whatever, to be violated, from ſuppoſed previous or ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour obligations, of which every man being the judge for himſelf, there is great danger that we may too often, from partial motives, perſuade ourſelves that they exiſt; and probably whatever extraordinary inſtances may ſometimes occur, where ſome evil may be prevented by violating this noble principle, it would be found that human happineſs would, upon the whole, be more perfect were Truth univerſally preſerved.</p>

               <p>It is ſurely not a little remarkable, that they ſhould appear without a name. Miſs Seward, knowing Dr. Johnſon's almoſt univerſal and minute literary information, ſignified a deſire that I ſhould aſk him who was the authour. He was prompt with his anſwer:—<q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, they were written by one Lewis, an under-maſter or uſher of Weſtminſter ſchool, who publiſhed a miſcellany, in which 'Grongar Hill' firſt came out."</q> Johnſon praiſed them highly, and repeated them with a noble animation. In the twelfth line, inſtead of <q rend="inline">"one eſtabliſhed fame,"</q> he repeated <q rend="inline">"one unclouded flame,"</q> which he thought was the reading in former editions; but I believe was a flaſh of his own genius. It is much more poetical than the other.</p>
               <p>On Monday 14, and Tueſday, June 15, Dr. Johnſon and I dined on one of them, I forget which, with Mr. Mickle, tranſlator of the <q rend="inline">"Luſiad,"</q> at Wheatley, a very pretty country place a few miles from Oxford; and on the other with Dr. Wetherell, Maſter of Univerſity-College. From Dr. We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therell's he went to viſit Mr. Sackville Parker the bookſeller; and when he returned to us, gave the following account of his viſit, ſaying, <q rend="inline">"I have been to ſee my old friend, Sack. Parker; I find he has married his maid; he has done right. She had lived with him many years in great confidence, and they had mingled minds; I do not think he could have found any wife that would have made him ſo happy. The woman was very attentive and civil to me; ſhe preſſed me to fix a day for dining with them, and to ſay what I liked, and ſhe would be ſure to get it for me. Poor Sack! He is very ill, indeed. We parted as never to meet again. It has quite broke me down."</q> This pathetick narrative was ſtrangely diverſified with the
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:0548300102:512" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 grave and earneſt defence of a man's having married his maid. I could not but feel it as in ſome degree ludicrous.</p>
               <p>In the morning of Tueſday, June 15, while we ſat at Dr. Adams's, we talked of a printed letter from the Reverend Herbert Croft, to a young gentleman who had been his pupil, in which he adviſed him to read to the end of whatever books he ſhould begin to read. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"This is ſurely a ſtrange advice; you may as well reſolve that whatever men you happen to get acquainted with, you are to keep to them for life. A book may be good for nothing; or there may be only one thing in it worth knowing; are we to read it all through?

               <p>During our viſit at Oxford, the following converſation paſſed between him and me on the ſubject of my trying my fortune at the Engliſh bar: Having aſked whether a very extenſive acquaintance in London, which was very valuable, and of great advantage to a man at large, might not be prejudicial to a lawyer, by preventing him from giving ſufficient attention to buſineſs. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, you will attend to buſineſs as buſineſs lays hold of you. When not actually employed, you may ſee your friends as much as you do now. You may dine at a Club every day, and ſup with one of the members every night; and you may be as much at publick places as one who has

ſeen them all would wiſh to be. But you muſt take care to attend conſtantly  in Weſtminſter-Hall; both to mind your buſineſs, as it is almoſt all learnt there, (for nobody reads now;) and to ſhew that you want to have buſineſs. And you muſt not be too often ſeen at publick places, that competitors may not have it to ſay, 'He is always at the Playhouſe or at Ranelagh, and never to be found at his chambers.' And, Sir, there muſt be a kind of ſolemnity in the manner of a profeſſional man. I have nothing particular to ſay to you on the ſubject. All this I ſhould ſay to any one; I ſhould have ſaid it to Lord Thurlow twenty years ago."</q>

ſome of the lawyers of this age who have riſen high, have by no means thought it abſolutely neceſſary to ſubmit to that long and painful courſe of ſtudy which a Plowden, a Coke, a Hale conſidered as requiſite. My reſpected friend, Mr. Langton, has ſhewn me in the hand-writing of his grandfather, a curious account of a converſation which he had with Lord Chief Juſtice Hale, in which that great man tells him, <q rend="inline">"That for two years after he came to the inn of court, he ſtudied ſixteen hours a day; however (his Lordſhip added) that by this intenſe application he almoſt brought himſelf to his grave, though he were of a very ſtrong conſtitution, and after reduced himſelf to eight hours; but that he would not adviſe any body to ſo much; that he thought ſix hours a day, with attention and conſtancy was ſufficient; that a man muſt uſe his body as he would his horſe, and his ſtomach; not tire him at once, but riſe with an appetite."</q>

                  <hi>The Reverend Mr. Aſtle, of Aſhbourne in Derbyſhire, brother to the learned and ingenious Thomas Aftle, Eſq. was from his early years known to Dr. Johnſon, who obligingly adviſed him as to his ſtudies, and recommended to him the following books, of which a liſt which he has been pleaſed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, lyes before me in Johnſon's own hand-writing.</hi>—Univerſal Hiſtory (ancient).—Rollin's Ancient Hiſtory.—Puffendorf's Introduction to Hiſtory.—Vertot's Hiſtory of Knights of Malta.—Vertot's Revolution of Portugal.—Vertot's Revolutions of Sweden.—Carte's Hiſtory of England.—Preſent State of England.—Geographical Grammar.—Prideaux's Connection.—Nelſon's Feaſts and Faſts.—Duty of Man.—Gentleman's Religion.—Clarendon's Hiſtory.—Watts's Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Mind.—Watts's Logick.—Nature Diſplayed.—Lowth's Engliſh Grammar.—Blackwal on the Claſſicks.—Sherlock's Sermons.—Burnet's Life of Hale.—Dupin's Hiſtory of the Church.—Shuckford's Connections.—Law's Serious Call.—Walton's Complete Angler.—Sandys's Travels.—Sprat's Hiſtory of the Royal Society.—England's Gazetteer.—Goldſmith's Roman Hiſtory.—Some Commentaries on the Bible.</p>
               <p>It having been mentioned to Dr. Johnſon that a gentleman who had a ſon whom he imagined to have an extreme degree of timidity, reſolved to ſend

him to a publick ſchool, that he might acquire confidence. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid  Johnſon,) this is a prepoſterous expedient for removing his infirmity; ſuch a diſpoſition ſhould be cultivated in the ſhade. Placing him at a publick ſchool is forcing an owl upon day."</q>

               <p>Speaking of a gentleman whoſe houſe was much frequented by low com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; <q rend="inline">"Rags, Sir, (ſaid he,) will always make their appearance where they have a right to do it."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Of the ſame gentleman's mode of living, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, the ſervants, inſtead of doing what they are bid, ſtand round the table in idle cluſters, gaping upon the gueſts; and ſeem as unfit to attend a company, as to ſteer a man of war."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A dull country magiſtrate gave Johnſon a long tedious account of his exerciſing his criminal juriſdiction, the reſult of which was his having ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced four convicts to tranſportation. Johnſon, in an agony of impatience to get rid of ſuch a companion, exclaimed, <q rend="inline">"I heartily wiſh, Sir, that I were a fifth."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Johnſon was preſent when a tragedy was read, in which there occurred this line:

               <p>Johnſon ſeldom encouraged general cenſure of any profeſſion; but he was willing to allow a due ſhare of merit to the various departments neceſſary in civiliſed life. In a ſplenetick, ſarcaſtical, or jocular frame, however, he would ſometimes utter a pointed ſaying of that nature.

 Johnſon having argued for ſome time with a pertinacious gentleman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his opponent, who had talked in a very puzzling manner, happened to ſay, <q rend="inline">"I don't underſtand you, Sir:"</q> upon which Johnſon obſerved, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I have found you an argument; but I am not obliged to find you an underſtanding."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Talking to me of Horry Walpole, (as the Honourable Horace Walpole is often called,) Johnſon allowed that he got together a great many curious little things, and told them in an elegant manner. Mr. Walpole thought Johnſon a more amiable character after reading his Letters to Mrs. Thrale; but never was one of the true admirers of that great man. We may ſuppoſe a prejudice conceived, if he ever heard Johnſon's account to Sir George Staunton, that when he made the ſpeeches in parliament for the Gentleman's Magazine, <q rend="inline">"he always took care to put Sir Robert Walpole in the wrong, and to ſay every thing he could againſt the electorate of Hanover."</q> The celebrated Heroick Epiſtle, in which Johnſon is ſatyrically introduced, has been aſcribed both to Mr. Walpole and Mr. Maſon. One day at Mr. Courtenay's, when a gentleman expreſſed his opinion that there was more energy in that poem than could be expected from Mr. Walpole; Mr. Warton, the late Laureat obſerved, <q rend="inline">"It may have been written by Walpole, and buckram'd by Maſon."</q>

               <p>He diſapproved of Lord Hailes for having moderniſed the language of the ever-memorable John Hales of Eton, in an edition which his Lordſhip pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed of that writer's works. <q rend="inline">"An authour's language, Sir, (ſaid he,) is a characteriſtical part of his compoſition, and is alſo characteriſtical of the age in which he writes.

               </p>
               <p>Here it may be obſerved, that his frequent uſe of the expreſſion, <hi>No, Sir,</hi> was not always to intimate contradiction; for he would ſay ſo, when he was about to enforce an affirmative propoſition which had not been denied, as in the inſtance laſt mentioned. I uſed to conſider it as a kind of flag of defiance; as if he had ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Any argument you may offer againſt this is not juſt. No, Sir, it is not."</q> It was like Falſtaff's <q rend="inline">"I deny your Major."</q>

               <p>Sir Joſhua Reynolds having ſaid that he took the altitude of a man's taſte by his ſtories and his wit, and of his underſtanding by the remarks which he repeated; being always ſure that he muſt be a weak man who quotes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon things with an emphaſis as if they were oracles. Johnſon agreed with him; and Sir Joſhua having alſo obſerved that the real character of a man was found out by his amuſements—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Yes, Sir; no man is a hypocrite in his pleaſures."</q>

Had Johnſon treated at large <hi>De Claris Oratoribus,</hi> he might have given  us an admirable work. When the Duke of Bedford attacked the miniſtry as vehemently as he could, for having taken upon them to extend the time for the importation of corn, Lord Chatham, in his firſt ſpeech in the Houſe of Lords, boldly avowed himſelf to be an adviſer of that meaſure. <q rend="inline">"My colleagues, (ſaid he,) as I was confined by indiſpoſition, did me the ſignal honour of coming to the bed-ſide of a ſick man, to aſk his opinion. But, had they not thus condeſcended, I ſhould have <hi>taken up my bed and walked,</hi> in order to have delivered that opinion at the Council Board."</q> Mr. Langton, who was preſent, mentioned this to Johnſon, who obſerved, <q rend="inline">"Now, Sir, we ſee that he took theſe words as he found them; without conſidering, that though the expreſſion in Scripture, <hi>take up thy bed and walk,</hi> ſtrictly ſuited the inſtance of the ſick man reſtored to health and ſtrength, who would of courſe be ſuppoſed to carry his bed with him, it could not be proper in the caſe of a man who was lying in a ſtate of feebleneſs, and who certainly would not add to the difficulty of moving at all, that of carrying his bed."</q>

               <p>When I pointed out to him in the news-paper one of Mr. Grattan's animated and glowing ſpeeches, in favour of the freedom of Ireland, in which this expreſſion occurred, (I know not if accurately taken): <q rend="inline">"We will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere, till there is not one link of the Engliſh chain left to clank upon the rags of the meaneſt beggar in Ireland."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) don't you perceive that <hi>one</hi> link cannot clank."</q>

               <p>Mr. Burke uniformly ſhewed Johnſon the greateſt reſpect; and when Mr. Townſhend, now Lord Sydney, at a period when he was conſpicuous in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, threw out ſome reflection in parliament upon the grant of a penſion to a man of ſuch political principles as Johnſon; Mr. Burke, though then of the ſame party with Mr. Townſhend, ſtood warmly forth in defence of his friend, to whom, he juſtly obſerved, the penſion was granted ſolely on account of his eminent literary merit. I am well aſſured, that Mr. Townſhend's attack upon Johnſon was the occaſion of his <q rend="inline">"hitching in a rhyme;"</q> for, that

 in the original copy of Goldſmith's character of Mr. Burke, in his <q rend="inline">"Retaliation,"</q> another perſon's name ſtood in the couplet where Mr. Townſhend is now introduced:

               </p>
               <p>It may be worth remarking, among the <hi>minutiae</hi> of my collection, that Johnſon was once drawn for the militia, the Trained Bands of the City of London, and that Mr. Rackſtrow, of the Muſeum in Fleet-ſtreet, was his Colonel. It may be believed he did not ſerve in perſon; but the idea, with all its circumſtances, is certainly laughable. He upon that occaſion provided himſelf with a muſket, and with a ſword and belt, which I have ſeen hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his cloſet.</p>
               <p>He was very conſtant to thoſe whom he once employed, if they gave him no reaſon to be diſpleaſed.

The following inſtance is well atteſted: Coming home late one night, he found a poor woman lying in the ſtreet, ſo much exhauſted that ſhe could not walk; he took her upon his back, and carried her to his houſe, where he diſcovered that ſhe was one of thoſe wretched females who had ſallen into the loweſt ſtate of vice, poverty, and diſeaſe. Inſtead of harſhly upbraiding her, he had her taken care of with all tenderneſs for a long time, at a conſiderable

 expence, till ſhe was reſtored to health, and endeavoured to put her into a virtuous way of living <note n="7" place="bottom">This circumſtance therefore alluded to in Mr. Courtenay's <q rend="inline">"Poetical Character,"</q> of him is ſtrictly true.</note>.</p>
               <p>He thought Mr. Caleb Whitefoord, ſingularly happy in hitting on the ſignature of <hi>Papyrius Curſor,</hi> to his ingenious and diverting croſs-readings of the news-papers; it being a real name of an ancient Roman, and clearly expreſſive of the thing done in this lively conceit.</p>
               <p>He once in his life was known to have uttered what is called a <hi>bull;</hi> Sir Joſhua Reynolds, when they were riding together in Devonſhire, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that he had a very bad horſe, for that even when going down hill he moved ſlowly ſtep by ſtep. <q rend="inline">"Ay (ſaid Johnſon) and when he <hi>goes</hi> up hill, he <hi>ſtands ſtill.</hi>"</q>
               </p>
               <p>He had a great averſion to geſticulating in company. He called once to a gentleman who offended him in that point, <q rend="inline">"Don't attitudeniſe."</q> And when another gentleman thought he was giving additional force to what he uttered, by expreſſive movements of his hands, Johnſon fairly ſeized them, and held them down.</p>
               <p>An authour of conſiderable eminence having engroſſed a good ſhare of the converſation in the company of Johnſon, and having ſaid nothing but what was very trifling and inſignificant; Johnſon when he was gone, obſerved to us, <q rend="inline">"It is wonderful what a difference there ſometimes is between a man's powers of writing and of talking.—writes with great ſpirit, but is a poor talker; had he held his tongue we might have ſuppoſed him to have been reſtrain'd by modeſty; but he has ſpoken a great deal to-day; and you have heard what ſtuff it was.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A gentleman having ſaid that a <hi>congé d'elire,</hi> has not perhaps the force of a command, but may be conſidered only as a ſtrong recommendation. <q rend="inline">"Sir, (replied Johnſon, who overheard him,) it is ſuch a recommendation, as if I ſhould throw you out of a two-pair-of-ſtairs window, and recommend to you to fall ſoft <note n="8" place="bottom">This has been printed in other publications, <q rend="inline">"fall <hi>to the ground.</hi>"</q> But Johnſon himſelf gave me the true expreſſion which he had uſed, as above; meaning that the recommendation left as little choice in the one caſe as the other.</note>."</q>

               <p>Mr. Steevens, who paſſed many a ſocial hour with him during their long acquaintance, which commenced when they both lived in the Temple, has preſerved a good number of particulars concerning him, moſt of which are to be found in the department of Apothegms, &amp;c. in the Collection of
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:0548300102:521" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <q rend="inline">"Johnſon's Works."</q> But he has been pleaſed to favour me with the following,  which are original:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"One evening, previous to the trial of Baretti, a conſultation of his friends was held at the houſe of Mr. Cox, the Solicitor, in Southampton-buildings, Chancery-lane. Among others preſent were, Mr. Burke and Dr. Johnſon, who differed in ſentiments concerning the tendency of ſome part of the defence the priſoner was to make. When the meeting was over, Mr. Steevens obſerved, that the queſtion between him and his friend had been agitated with rather too much warmth. 'It may be ſo, Sir, (replied the Doctor,) for Burke and I ſhould have been of one opinion, if we had had no audience."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Dr. Johnſon once aſſumed a character in which perhaps even Mr. Boſwell never ſaw him. His curioſity having been excited by the praiſes beſtowed on the celebrated Torré's fireworks at Marybone-Gardens, he deſired Mr. Steevens to accompany him thither. The evening had proved ſhowery; and ſoon after the few people preſent were aſſembled, publick notice was given, that the conductors to the wheels, ſuns, ſtars, &amp;c. were ſo thoroughly water-ſoaked, that it was impoſſible any part of the exhibition ſhould be made. 'This is a mere excuſe (ſays the Doctor) to ſave their crackers for a more profitable company. Let us but hold up our ſticks, and threaten to break thoſe coloured lamps that ſurround the Orcheſtra, and we ſhall ſoon have our wiſhes gratified. The core of the fire-works cannot be injured; let the different pieces be touched in their reſpective centers, and they will do their offices as well as ever.'—Some young men who overheard him, immediately began the violence he had recommended, and an attempt was ſpeedily made to fire ſome of the wheels which appeared to have received the ſmalleſt damage; but to little purpoſe were they lighted, for moſt of them completely failed.—The authour of 'The Rambler,' however, may be conſidered on this occaſion, as the ring-leader of a ſucceſsful riot, though not as a ſkilful pyrotechniſt."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"It has been ſuppoſed that Dr. Johnſon, ſo far as faſhion was concerned, was careleſs of his appearance in publick. But this is not altogether true, as the following ſlight inſtance may ſhow:—Goldſmith's laſt Comedy was to be repreſented during ſome court-mourning; and Mr. Steevens appointed to call on Dr. Johnſon, and carry him to the tavern where he was to dine with others of the Poet's friends. The Doctor was ready dreſſed, but in coloured cloaths; yet being told that he would find every one elſe in black, received the intelligence with a profuſion of thanks, haſtened to change his attire, all the while repeating his gratitude for the information that had ſaved him from an appearance ſo improper in the front row of a front box. 'I would not
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:0548300102:522" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 (added he) for ten pounds, have ſeemed ſo retrograde to any general obſervance."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"He would ſometimes found his diſlikes on very ſlender circumſtances. Happening one day to mention Mr. Flexman, a Diſſenting miniſter, with ſome compliment to his exact memory in chronological matters; the Doctor replied, 'Let me hear no more of him, Sir. That is the fellow who made the Index to my Ramblers, and ſet down the name of Milton thus:—Milton, <hi>Mr.</hi> John."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Steevens adds this teſtimony, <q rend="inline">"It is unfortunate however for Johnſon, that his particularities and frailties can be more diſtinctly traced than his good and amiable exertions. Could the many bounties he ſtudiouſly concealed, the many acts of humanity he performed in private, be diſplayed with equal circumſtantiality, his defects would be ſo far loſt in the blaze of his virtues, that the latter only would be regarded."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Though from my very great admiration of Johnſon, I have wondered that he was not courted by all the great and all the eminent perſons of his time, it ought fairly to be conſidered, that no man of humble birth, who lived entirely by literature, in ſhort no authour by profeſſion, ever roſe in this country, into that perſonal notice which he did. In the courſe of this work a numerous variety of names have been mentioned, to which many might be added. I cannot omit Lord and Lady Lucan, at whoſe houſe he often enjoyed all that an elegant table and the beſt company can contribute to happineſs; he found hoſpitality united with extraordinary accompliſhments, and embelliſhed with charms of which no man could be inſenſible.</p>
               <p>On Tueſday, June 22, I dined with him at THE LITERARY CLUB, the laſt time of his being in that reſpectable ſociety. The other members preſent were the Biſhop of St. Aſaph, Lord Eliot, Lord Palmerſton, Dr. Fordyce, and Mr. Malone. He looked ill; but had ſuch a manly fortitude, that he did not trouble the company with melancholy complaints. They all ſhewed evident marks of kind concern about him, with which he was much pleaſed, and he exerted himſelf to be as entertaining as his indiſpoſition allowed him.</p>
               <p>The anxiety of his friends to preſerve ſo eſtimable a life, as long as human means might be ſuppoſed to have influence, made them plan for him a retreat from the ſeverity of a Britiſh winter, to the mild climate of Italy. This ſcheme was at laſt brought to a ſerious reſolution at General Paoli's, where I had often talked of it. One eſſential matter, however, I underſtood was neceſſary to be previouſly ſettled, which was obtaining ſuch an addition to his income, as would be ſufficient to enable him to defray the expence in
<pb n="521" facs="tcp:0548300102:523" rendition="simple:additions"/>
a manner becoming the firſt literary character of a great nation, and, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent  of all his other merits, the Authour of THE DICTIONARY OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. The perſon to whom I above all others thought I ſhould apply to negotiate this buſineſs, was the Lord Chancellor <note n="9" place="bottom">Edward Lord Thurlow.</note>, becauſe I knew that he highly valued Johnſon, and that Johnſon highly valued his Lordſhip; ſo that it was no degradation of my illuſtrious friend to ſolicit for him the favour of ſuch a man. I have mentioned what Johnſon ſaid of him to me when he was at the bar <note n="1" place="bottom">Page 441 of this Volume.</note>; and after his Lordſhip was advanced to the ſeals, he ſaid of him, <q rend="inline">"I would prepare myſelf for no man in England but Lord Thurlow. When I am to meet with him I ſhould wiſh to know a day before."</q> How he would have prepared himſelf I cannot conjecture. Would he have ſelected certain topicks, and conſidered them in every view ſo as to be in readineſs to argue them at all points? and what may we ſuppoſe thoſe ropicks to have been? I once ſtarted the curious enquiry to the great man who was the ſubject of this compliment: he ſmiled, but did not purſue it.</p>
               <p>I firſt conſulted with Sir Joſhua Reynolds, who perfectly coincided in opinion with me; and I therefore, though perſonally very little known to his Lordſhip, wrote to him <note n="2" place="bottom">It is ſtrange that Sir John Hawkins ſhould have related that the application was made by Sir Joſhua Reynolds, when he could ſo eaſily have been informed of the truth by inquiring of Sir Joſhua. Sir John's careleſſneſs to aſcertain facts is very remarkable.</note>, ſtating the caſe, and requeſting his good offices for Dr. Johnſon. I mentioned that I was obliged to ſet out for Scotland early in the week after, ſo that if his Lordſhip ſhould have any commands for me as to this pious negociation, he would be pleaſed to ſend them before that time; otherwiſe Sir Joſhua Reynolds would give all attention to it.</p>
               <p>This application was made not only without any ſuggeſtion on the part of Johnſon himſelf, but was utterly unknown to him, nor had he the ſmalleſt ſuſpicion of it. Any inſinuations, therefore, which ſince his death have been thrown out, as if he had ſtooped to aſk what was ſuperfluous, are without any foundation. But, had he aſked it, it would not have been ſuperfluous; for though the money he had ſaved proved to be more than his friends imagined, or than I believe he himſelf, in his careleſſneſs concerning worldly matters, knew it to be, had he travelled upon the Continent, an augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his income would by no means have been unneceſſary.</p>

 On Wedneſday, June 23, I viſited him in the forenoon, after having been preſent at the ſhocking ſight of fifteen men executed before Newgate. I ſaid to him, I was ſure that human life was not machinery, that is to ſay, a chain of fatality planned and directed by the Supreme Being, as it had in it ſo much wickedneſs and miſery, ſo many inſtances of both, as that by which my mind was now clouded. Were it machinery it would be better than it is in theſe reſpects, though leſs noble, as not being a ſyſtem of moral government. He agreed with me now, as he always did, upon the great queſtion of the liberty of the human will, which has been in all ages perplexed with ſo much ſophiſtry. <q rend="inline">But, Sir, as to the doctrine of Neceſſity, no man believes it. If a man ſhould give me arguments that I do not ſee, though I could not anſwer them, ſhould I believe that I do not ſee?"</q> It will be obſerved, that Johnſon at all times made the juſt diſtinction between doctrines <hi>contrary</hi> to reaſon, and doctrines <hi>above</hi> reaſon.</p>
               <p>Talking of the religious diſcipline proper for unhappy convicts, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, one of our regular clergy will probably not impreſs their minds ſufficiently: they ſhould be attended by a Methodiſt preacher, or a Popiſh prieſt."</q> Let me however obſerve, in juſtice to the Reverend Mr. Vilette, who has been Ordinary of Newgate for no leſs than ſeventeen years, in the courſe of which he has attended many hundreds of wretched criminals, that his earneſt and humane exhortations have been very effectual. His extraordinary diligence is highly praiſe-worthy, and merits a diſtinguiſhed reward.</p>
               <p>On Thurſday, June 24, I dined with him at Mr. Dilly's, where were the Reverend Mr. Knox, maſter of Tunbridge-ſchool, Mr. Smith, Vicar of Southill, Dr. Beattie, Mr. Pinkerton, authour of various literary performances, and the Reverend Dr. Mayo. At my deſire old Mr. Sheridan was invited, as I was earneſt to have Johnſon and him brought together again by chance, that a reconciliation might be effected. Mr. Sheridan happened to come early, and having learnt that Dr. Johnſon was to be there, went away; ſo I found, with ſincere regret, that my friendly intentions were hopeleſs. I recollect nothing that paſſed this day, except Johnſon's quickneſs, who, when Dr. Beattie obſerved, as ſomething remarkable which had happened to him, that he had chanced to ſee both No. 1, and No. 1,000, of the hackney-coaches, the firſt and the laſt; <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, (ſaid he,) there is an equal chance for one's ſeeing thoſe two numbers as any other two."</q> He was clearly right; yet the ſeeing of the two extremes, each of which is in ſome degree more conſpicuous than the reſt, could not but ſtrike one in a ſtronger manner than the ſight of any other two numbers.—Though I have neglected to preſerve
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:0548300102:525"/>
his converſation, it was perhaps at this interview that Mr. Knox formed the  notion of it which he has exhibited in his <q rend="inline">"Winter Evenings."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Friday, June 25, I dined with him at General Paoli's, where he ſays, in one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale, <q rend="inline">"I love to dine."</q> There were a variety of diſhes much to his taſte, of all which he ſeemed to me to eat ſo much, that I was afraid he might be hurt by it; and I whiſpered to the General my fear, and begged he might not preſs him. <q rend="inline">"Alas! (ſaid the General,) ſee how very ill he looks; he can live but a very ſhort time. Would you refuſe any ſlight gratifications to a man under ſentence of death? There is a humane cuſtom in Italy, by which perſons in that melancholy ſituation are indulged with having whatever they like beſt to eat and drink, even with expenſive delicacies."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhewed him ſome verſes on Lichfield by Miſs Seward, which I had that day received from her, and had the pleaſure to hear him approve of them. He confirmed to me the truth of a high compliment which I had been told he had paid to that lady, when ſhe mentioned to him <q rend="inline">"The Colombiade,"</q> an epick poem, by Madame du Boccage:—<q rend="inline">"Madam, there is not in it any thing equal to your deſcription of the ſea round the North Pole, in your Ode on the death of Captain Cook."</q>
               </p>
               <p>On Sunday, June 27, I found him rather better. I mentioned to him a young man who was going to Jamaica with his wife and children, in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being provided for by two of her brothers ſettled in that iſland, one a clergyman and the other a phyſician. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is a wild ſcheme, Sir, unleſs he has a poſitive and deliberate invitation. There was a poor girl, who uſed to come about me, who had a couſin in Barbadoes, that, in a letter to her, expreſſed a wiſh ſhe would come out to that iſland, and expa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated on the comforts and happineſs of her ſituation. The poor girl went out: her couſin was much ſurprized, and aſked her how ſhe could think of coming. 'Becauſe (ſaid ſhe) you invited me.'—'Not I' (anſwered the couſin). The letter then was produced. 'I ſee it is true, (ſaid ſhe,) that I did invite you; but I did not think you would come.' They lodged her in an out-houſe, where ſhe paſſed her time miſerably; and as ſoon as ſhe had an opportunity ſhe returned to England. Always tell this, when you hear of people going abroad to relations, upon a notion of being well received. In the caſe which you mention, it is probable the clergyman ſpends all he gets, and the phyſician does not know how much he is to get."</q>
               </p>
               <p>We this day dined at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's, with General Paoli, Lord Eliot, (formerly Mr. Eliot, of Port Eliot,) Dr. Beattie, and ſome more
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:0548300102:526" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 company. Talking of Lord Cheſterfield;—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"His manner was exquiſitely elegant, and he had more knowledge than I expected."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"Did you find, Sir, his converſation to be of a ſuperiour ſtyle."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, in the converſation which I had with him I had the beſt right to ſuperiority, for it was upon philology and literature."</q> Lord Eliot, who had travelled at the ſame time with Mr. Stanhope, Lord Cheſterfield's natural ſon, juſtly obſerved, that it was ſtrange that a man who ſhewed he had ſo much affection for his ſon as Lord Cheſterfield did, by writing ſo many long and anxious letters to him, almoſt all of them when he was Secretary of State, which certainly was a proof of great goodneſs of diſpoſition, ſhould endeavour to make his ſon a raſcal. His Lordſhip told us, that Foote had intended to bring on the ſtage a father who had thus tutored his ſon, and to ſhew the ſon an honeſt man to every thing elſe, but practiſing his father's maxims upon him, and cheating him. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"I am much pleaſed with this deſign; but I think there was no occaſion to make the ſon honeſt at all. No; he ſhould be a conſummate rogue: the contraſt between honeſty and knavery would be the ſtronger. It ſhould be contrived ſo that the father ſhould be the only ſufferer by the ſon's villainy, and thus there would be poetical juſtice."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He put Lord Eliot in mind of Dr. Walter Harte. <q rend="inline">"I know (ſaid he) Harte was your Lordſhip's tutor, and he was alſo tutor to the Peterborough family. Pray, my Lord, do you recollect any particulars that he told you of Lord Peterborough? He is a favourite of mine, and is not enough known: his character has been only ventilated in party pamphlets."</q> Lord Eliot ſaid, if Dr. Johnſon would be ſo good as to aſk him any queſtions, he would tell what he could recollect. Accordingly ſome things were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned. <q rend="inline">"But (ſaid his Lordſhip) the beſt account of Lord Peterborough that I have happened to meet with, is, 'Captain Carleton's Memoirs.' Carleton was deſcended of an anceſtor who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf at the ſiege of Derry. He was an officer; and, what was rare at that time, had ſome knowledge of engineering."</q> Johnſon ſaid, he had never heard of the book. Lord Eliot had it at Port Eliot; but, after a good deal of enquiry, procured a copy in London, and ſent it to Johnſon, who told Sir Joſhua Reynolds that he was going to bed when it came, but was ſo much pleaſed with it, that he ſate up till he had read it through, and found in it ſuch an air of truth, that he could not doubt of its authenticity; adding, with a ſmile (in alluſion to Lord Eliot's having recently been raiſed to the peerage,) <q rend="inline">"I
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:0548300102:527" rendition="simple:additions"/>
did not think a <hi>young Lord</hi> could have mentioned to me a book in the Engliſh  hiſtory that was not known to me."</q>
               </p>
               <p>An addition to our company came after we went up to the drawing-room; Dr. Johnſon ſeemed to riſe in ſpirits as his audience increaſed. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He wiſhed that Lord Orford's pictures, and Sir Aſhton Lever's Muſeum, might be purchaſed by the publick, becauſe both the money, and the pictures, and the curioſities, would remain in the country. Whereas, if they were ſold into another kingdom, the nation would indeed get ſome money, but would loſe the pictures and curioſities, which it would be deſirable we ſhould have for improvement in taſte and natural hiſtory. The only queſtion was, that as the nation was much in want of money, whether it would not be better to take a large price from a foreign ſtate."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He entered upon a curious diſcuſſion of the difference between intuition and ſagacity, one being immediate in its effect, the other requiring a circuitous proceſs; one he obſerved, was the <hi>eye</hi> of the mind, the other the <hi>noſe</hi> of the mind.</p>
               <p>A gentleman preſent took up the argument againſt him, and maintained that no man ever thinks of the <hi>noſe of the mind,</hi> not adverting that though that figurative phraſe ſeems ſtrange to us, as very unuſual, it is truly not more forced than Hamlet's <q rend="inline">"In my <hi>mind's eye,</hi> Horatio."</q> He perſiſted much too long, and appeared to Johnſon as putting himſelf forward as his antagoniſt with too much preſumption; upon which he called to him in a loud tone, <q rend="inline">"What is it you are contending for, if you <hi>be</hi> contending?"</q>—And afterwards imagining that the gentleman retorted upon him with a kind of ſmart drollery, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Mr.—, it does not become you to talk ſo to me. Beſides, ridicule is not your talent; you have <hi>there</hi> neither intuition nor ſagacity."</q>—The gentleman proteſted that he had intended no improper freedom, but had the greateſt reſpect for Dr. Johnſon. After a ſhort pauſe, during which we were ſomewhat uneaſy—JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Give me your hand, Sir. You were too tedious, and I was too ſhort."</q> MR.—. <q rend="inline">"Sir, I am honoured by your attention in any way."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Come, Sir, let's have no more of it. We offended one another by our contention; let us not offend the company by our compliments."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He now ſaid, <q rend="inline">"He wiſhed much to go to Italy, and that he dreaded paſſing the winter in England."</q> I ſaid nothing, but enjoyed a ſecret ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in thinking that I had taken the moſt effectual meaſures to make ſuch a ſcheme practicable.</p>
               <p>On Monday, June 28, I had the honour to receive from the Lord Chancellor the following letter:

               <p>This letter gave me a very high ſatisfaction; I next day went and ſhewed it to Sir Joſhua Reynolds, who was exceedingly pleaſed with it. He thought that I ſhould now communicate the negociation to Dr. Johnſon, who might afterwards complain if the attention with which it had been honoured, ſhould be too long concealed from him. I intended to ſet out for Scotland next morning, but Sir Joſhua cordially inſiſted that I ſhould ſtay another day, that Johnſon and I might dine with him, that we three might talk of his Italian Tour, and as Sir Joſhua expreſſed himſelf, <q rend="inline">"have it all out."</q> I haſtened to Johnſon, and was told by him that he was rather better to-day. BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"I am very anxious about you, Sir, and particularly that you ſhould go to Italy for the winter, which I believe is your own wiſh."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"It is, Sir."</q> BOSWELL. <q rend="inline">"You have no objection, I preſume, but the money it would require."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Why no, Sir."</q> Upon which I gave him a particular account of what had been done, and read to him the Lord Chancellor's letter.—He liſtened with much attention; then warmly ſaid, <q rend="inline">"This is taking prodigious pains about a man."</q>—<q rend="inline">"O! Sir, (ſaid I, with moſt ſincere affection,) your friends would do every thing for you."</q> He pauſed—grew more and more agitated—till tears ſtarted into his eyes, and he exclaimed with fervent emotion, <q rend="inline">"GOD bleſs you all."</q> I was ſo affected that I alſo ſhed tears.—After a ſhort ſilence, he renewed and extended his grateful benediction, <q rend="inline">"GOD bleſs you all, for JESUS CHRIST'S ſake."</q> We both remained for ſome time unable to ſpeak.—He roſe ſuddenly and quitted the room quite melted in tenderneſs. He ſtaid but a ſhort time, till he had
<pb n="527" facs="tcp:0548300102:529" rendition="simple:additions"/>
recovered his firmneſs; ſoon after he returned I left him, having firſt engaged  him to dine at Sir Joſhua Reynolds's, next day.—I never was again under that roof which I had ſo long reverenced.</p>
               <p>On Wedneſday, June 30, the friendly confidential dinner with Sir Joſhua Reynolds took place, no other company being preſent. Had I known that this was the laſt time that I ſhould enjoy in this world, the converſation of a friend whom I ſo much reſpected, and from whom I derived ſo much inſtruction and entertainment, I ſhould have been deeply affected. When I now look back to it, I am vexed that a ſingle word ſhould have been forgotten.</p>
               <p>Both Sir Joſhua and I were ſo ſanguine in our expectations, that we expatiated with confidence on the large proviſion which we were ſure would be made for him, conjecturing whether munificence would be diſplayed in one large donation, or in an ample increaſe of his penſion. He himſelf catched ſo much of our enthuſiaſm, as to allow himſelf to ſuppoſe it not impoſſible that our hopes might in one way or other be realiſed. He ſaid that he would rather have his penſion doubled than a grant of a thouſand pounds; <q rend="inline">"For (ſaid he) though probably I may not live to receive as much as a thouſand pounds, a man would have the conſciouſneſs that he ſhould paſs the remainder of his life in ſplendour, how long ſoever it might be."</q> Conſidering what a moderate proportion an income of ſix hundred pounds a year bears to innumerable fortunes in this country, it is worthy of remark, that a man ſo truly great ſhould think it ſplendour.</p>
               <p>As an inſtance of extraordinary liberality of friendſhip, he told us, that Dr. Brockleſby had upon this occaſion, offered him a hundred a year for his life. A grateful tear ſtarted into his eye, as he ſpoke this in a faultering tone.</p>
               <p>Sir Joſhua and I endeavoured to flatter his imagination with agreeable proſpects of happineſs in Italy. <q rend="inline">"Nay (ſaid he) I muſt not expect much of that; when a man goes to Italy merely to feel how he breathes the air, he can enjoy very little."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Our converſation turned upon living in the country, which Johnſon, whoſe melancholy mind required the diſſipation of quick ſucceſſive variety, had habituated himſelf to conſider as a kind of mental impriſonment. <q rend="inline">"Yet, Sir, (ſaid I,) there are many people who are content to live in the country."</q> JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Sir, it is in the intellectual world as in the phyſical world; we are told by natural philoſophers, that a body is at reſt in the place that is fit for it; they who are content to live in the country are <hi>fit</hi> for the country."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="528" facs="tcp:0548300102:530" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Talking of various enjoyments, I argued that a refinement of taſte was a diſadvantage, as they who have attained to it muſt be ſeldomer pleaſed than thoſe who have no nice diſcrimination, and are therefore ſatisfied with every thing that comes in their way. JOHNSON. <q rend="inline">"Nay, Sir; that is a paltry notion. Endeavour to be as perfect as you can in every reſpect."</q>
               </p>
               <p>I accompanied him in Sir Joſhua Reynolds's coach, to the entry of Bolt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court. He aſked me whether I would not go with him to his houſe; I declined it, from an apprehenſion that my ſpirits would ſink. We bade adieu to each other affectionately in the carriage. When he had got down upon the foot-pavement, he called out, <q rend="inline">"Fare you well;"</q> and without looking back, ſprung away with a kind of pathetick briſkneſs, if I may uſe that expreſſion, which ſeemed to indicate a ſtruggle to conceal uneaſineſs, and impreſſed me with a foreboding of our long, long ſeparation.</p>
               <p>I remained one day more in town, to have the chance of talking over my negociation with the Lord Chancellor; but the multiplicity of his Lordſhip's important engagements did not allow of it; ſo I left the management of the buſineſs in the hands of Sir Joſhua Reynolds.</p>
               <p>Soon after this time Dr. Johnſon had the mortification of being informed by Mrs. Thrale, that <q rend="inline">"what ſhe ſuppoſed he never believed <note n="8" place="bottom">
                        <q rend="inline">"Letters to Mrs. Thrale,"</q> Vol. II. page 375.</note>,"</q> was true, namely, that ſhe was actually going to marry Signor Piozzi, an Italian muſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter. He endeavoured to prevent it, but in vain. If ſhe would publiſh the whole of the correſpondence that paſſed between Dr. Johnſon and her on the ſubject, we ſhould have a full view of his real ſentiments. As it is, our judgement muſt be biaſſed by that characteriſtick ſpecimen, which Sir John Hawkins has given us: <q rend="inline">"Poor Thrale! I thought that either her virtue or her vice would have reſtrained her from ſuch a marriage. She is now become a ſubject for her enemies to exult over, and for her friends, if ſhe has any left, to forget, or pity <note n="9" place="bottom">Dr. Johnſon's Letter to Sir John Hawkins, <q rend="inline">"Life,"</q> p. 570,</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt be admitted that Johnſon derived a conſiderable portion of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs from the comforts and elegancies which he enjoyed in Mr. Thrale's family; but Mrs. Thrale aſſures us he was indebted for theſe to her huſband alone, who certainly reſpected him ſincerely. Her words are, <q rend="inline">"<hi>Veneration for his virtue, reverence for his talents,</hi> delight <hi>in his converſation, and</hi> habitual endurance of a yoke my huſband firſt put upon me, <hi>and of which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentedly bore his ſhare for ſixteen or ſeventeen years, made me go on ſo long with</hi>

                     <hi>Mr. Johnſon; but the perpetual confinement I will own to have been</hi> terrifying,  <hi>in the firſt years of our friendſhip, and</hi> irkſome <hi>in the laſt; nor could I pretend to</hi> ſupport <hi>it without help when my coadjutor was no more.</hi>"</q> Alas! how different is this from the declarations which I have heard Mrs. Thrale make in his life-time, without a ſingle murmur againſt any peculiarities, or againſt any one circumſtance which attended their intimacy.</p>
               <p>As a ſincere friend of the great man whoſe Life I am writing, I think it neceſſary to guard my readers againſt the miſtaken notion of Dr. Johnſon's character, which this lady's <q rend="inline">"Anecdotes"</q> of him ſuggeſt; for from the very nature and form of her book, it <q rend="inline">"lends deception lighter wings to fly."</q>
               </p>
               <q>
                  <p>Let it be remembered, (ſays an eminent critick <note n="2" place="bottom">Who has been pleaſed to furniſh me with his remarks.</note>,) that ſhe has compriſed in a ſmall volume all that ſhe could recollect of Dr. Johnſon in <hi>twenty years,</hi> during which period, doubtleſs, ſome ſevere things were ſaid by him; and they who read the book in <hi>two hours,</hi> naturally enough ſuppoſe that his whole converſation was of this complexion. But the fact is, I have been often in his company, and never <hi>once</hi> heard him ſay a ſevere thing to any one; and many others can atteſt the ſame. When he did ſay a ſevere thing it was generally extorted by ignorance pretending to knowledge, or by extreme vanity or affectation.</p>
                  <p>Two inſtances of inaccuracy (adds he) are peculiarly worthy of notice:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>It is ſaid</hi> 
                     <note n="3" place="bottom">
                        <q rend="inline">"Anecdotes,"</q> p. 183.</note>, <q rend="inline">'That natural roughneſs of his manner ſo often mentioned, would, notwithſtanding the regularity of his notions burſt through them all from time to time; and he once bade a very celebrated lady, who praiſed him with too much zeal perhaps, or perhaps too ſtrong an emphaſis, (which always offended him,) conſider what her flattery was worth before ſhe chocked <hi>him</hi> with it.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let the genuine anecdote be contraſted with this.—The perſon thus repreſented as being harſhly treated, though a very celebrated lady, was <hi>then</hi> juſt come to London from an obſcure ſituation in the country. At Sir Joſhua Reynolds's one evening ſhe met Dr. Johnſon. She very ſoon began to pay her court to him in the moſt fulſome ſtrain. <q rend="inline">'Spare me, I beſeech you, dear Madam,'</q> was his reply. She ſtill <hi>laid it on.</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">'Pray, Madam, let us have no more of this,'</q> he rejoined. Not paying any attention to theſe warnings, ſhe continued ſtill her eulogy.

 How different does this ſtory appear, when accompanied with all theſe circumſtances which really belong to it, but which Mrs. Thrale either did not know, or has ſuppreſſed.</p>
                  <p>She ſays <note n="4" place="bottom">
                        <q rend="inline">"Anecdotes,"</q> p. 202.</note>, <q rend="inline">'One gentleman, however, who dined at a nobleman's houſe in his company, and that of Mr. Thrale, to whom I was obliged for the anecdote, was willing to enter the liſts in defence of King William's character; and having oppoſed and contradicted Johnſon two or three times, petulantly enough, the maſter of the houſe began to feel uneaſy, and expect diſagreeable conſequences; to avoid which, he ſaid, loud enough for the Doctor to hear—Our friend here has no meaning now in all this, except juſt to relate at club to-morrow how he teized Johnſon at dinner to-day; this is all to do himſelf <hi>honour.</hi>—No, upon my word, (replied the other,) I ſee no <hi>honour</hi> in it, whatever you may do.—Well, Sir, (returned Mr. Johnſon, ſternly,) if you do not <hi>ſee</hi> the honour, I am ſure I <hi>feel</hi> the diſgrace.'</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is all ſophiſticated. Mr. Thrale was not in the company, though he might have related the ſtory to Mrs. Thrale. A friend, from whom I had the ſtory, was preſent; and it was not at the houſe of a nobleman. On the obſervation being made by the maſter of the houſe on a gentleman's contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting Johnſon, that he had talked for the honour, &amp;c. the gentleman mut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, in a low voice, <q rend="inline">'I ſee no honour in it;'</q> and Dr. Johnſon ſaid nothing: ſo all the reſt (though <hi>bien trouvée)</hi> is mere garniſh.</p>
               </q>
               <p>I have had occaſion ſeveral times, in the courſe of this work, to point out the inccorrectneſs of Mrs. Thrale, as to particulars which conſiſted with my own knowledge. But indeed ſhe has, in flippant terms enough, expreſſed her diſapprobation of that anxious deſire of authenticity which prompts a perſon who is to record converſations, to write them down <hi>at the moment</hi> 
                  <note n="5" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 44.</note>. Unqueſtionably, if they are to be recorded at all, the ſooner it is done the better. This lady herſelf ſays <note n="6" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 23.</note>, <q rend="inline">"To recollect, however, and to repeat the ſayings of Dr. Johnſon, is almoſt all that can be done by the writers of his Life; as his life, at leaſt ſince my acquaintance with him, conſiſted in little elſe than talking, when he was not employed in ſome ſerious piece of work."</q> She boaſts of her having kept a common-place book; and, we find ſhe noted, at one time or other, in a very lively manner, ſpecimens of the converſation of Dr. Johnſon, and of thoſe who talked with him; but had ſhe done it recently, they probably would have been leſs erroneous;
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:0548300102:533"/>
and we ſhould have been relieved from thoſe diſagreeable doubts of their  authenticity, with which we muſt now peruſe them.</p>

                  <q rend="inline">"If you wanted <hi>a ſlight favour,</hi> you muſt apply to people of other diſpoſitions; for <hi>not a ſtep would Johnſon move</hi> to obtain a man a vote in a ſociety, to repay a compliment which might be uſeful or pleaſing, to write a letter of requeſt, &amp;c. or to obtain a hundred pounds a year more for a friend who perhaps had already two or three. No force could urge him to diligence, no importunity could conquer his reſolution to ſtand ſtill."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is amazing that one who had ſuch opportunities of knowing Dr. Johnſon, ſhould appear ſo little acquainted with his real character. I am ſorry this lady does not advert, that ſhe herſelf contradicts the aſſertion of his being obſtinately defective in the <hi>petite morale,</hi> in the little endearing charities of ſocial life in conferring ſmaller favours; for ſhe ſays <note n="8" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 193.</note>, <q rend="inline">"Dr. Johnſon was liberal enough in granting literary aſſiſtance to others, I think; and innumerable are the Prefaces, Sermons, Lectures, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dications which he uſed to make for people who begged of him."</q> I am certain that a <hi>more active friend</hi> has rarely been found in any age. This work, which I fondly hope will reſcue his memory from obloquy, contains a thouſand inſtances of his benevolent exertions in almoſt every way that can be conceived; and particularly in employing his pen with a generous readineſs for thoſe to whom its aid could be uſeful. Indeed his obliging activity in doing little offices of kindneſs, both by letters and perſonal appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, was one of the moſt remarkable features in his character; and for the truth of this I can appeal to a number of his reſpectable friends: Sir Joſhua Reynolds, Mr. Langton, Mr. Hamilton, Mr. Burke, Mr. Windham, Mr. Malone, the Biſhop of Dromore, Sir William Scott, Sir Robert Chambers.—And can Mrs. Thrale forget the advertiſements which he wrote for her huſband at the time of his election conteſt; the epitaphs on him and her mother; the playful and even trifling verſes, for the amuſement of her and her daughters; his correſponding with her children, and entering into their minute concerns, which ſhews him in the moſt amiable light?</p>

'Well, Sir—and what if it is Mr. Ch—lm—ley;' ſays the other, ſternly, juſt lifting his eyes a moment from his book, and returning to it again, with renewed avidity."</q> This ſurely conveys a notion of Johnſon, as if he had been groſsly rude to Mr. Cholmondeley, a gentleman whom he always loved and eſteemed. If<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore, there was an abſolute neceſſity for mentioning the ſtory at all, it might have been thought that her tenderneſs for Dr. Johnſon's character would have diſpoſed her to ſtate any thing that could ſoften it.

There is another little cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which I cannot but remark.

I certainly, then, do not claim too much in behalf of my illuſtrious friend  in ſaying, that however ſmart and entertaining Mrs. Thrale's <q rend="inline">"Anecdotes"</q> are, they muſt not be held as good evidence againſt him; for wherever an inſtance of harſhneſs and ſeverity is told, I beg leave to doubt its perfect authenticity; for though there may have been <hi>ſome</hi> foundation for it, yet, like that of his reproof to the <q rend="inline">"very celebrated lady,"</q> it may be ſo exhibited in the narration as to be very unlike the real fact.</p>

                  <hi>is to repreſent Dr. Johnſon very deficient in affection, tenderneſs, or even common civility.</hi>

Johnſon, who was ſhocked both at the fact, and her light unfeeling manner of mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, replied, 'Madam, it would give <hi>you</hi> very little concern if all your relations were ſpitted like thoſe larks, and dreſt for Preſto's ſupper <note n="5" place="bottom">Upon mentioning this to my friend Mr. Wilkes, he, with his uſual readineſs, pleaſantly matched it with the following <hi>ſentimental anecdote.</hi> He was invited by a young man of faſhion at Paris, to ſup with him and a lady, who had been for ſome time his miſtreſs, but with whom he was going to part.

               <p>Having left the <hi>pious negociation,</hi> as I called it, in the beſt hands, I ſhall here inſert what relates to it. Johnſon wrote to Sir Joſhua Reynolds on July 6, as follows: <q rend="inline">"I am going, I hope, in a few days, to try the air of Derbyſhire, but hope to ſee you before I go. Let me, however, mention to you what I have much at heart.—If the Chancellor ſhould continue his attention to Mr. Boſwell's requeſt, and confer with you on the means of relieving my languid ſtate, I am very deſirous to avoid the appearance of aſking money upon falſe pretences. I deſire you to repreſent to his Lordſhip, what, as ſoon as it is ſuggeſted, he will perceive to be reaſonable.—That, if I grow much worſe, I ſhall be afraid to leave my phyſicians, to ſuffer the inconveniences of travel, and pine in the ſolitude of a foreign country.—That, if I grow much better, of which indeed there is now little appearance, I ſhall not wiſh to leave my friends and my domeſtick comforts; for I do not travel for pleaſure or curioſity; yet if I ſhould recover, curioſity would revive.—In my preſent ſtate, I am deſirous to make a ſtruggle for a little longer life, and hope to obtain ſome help from a ſofter climate. Do for me what you can."</q> He wrote to me July 26: <q rend="inline">"I wiſh your affairs could have permitted a longer and continued exertion of your zeal and kindneſs. They that have your kindneſs may want your ardour. In the mean time I am very feeble, and very dejected."</q>
               </p>
               <p>By a letter from Sir Joſhua Reynolds I was informed, that the Lord Chancellor had called on him, and acquainted him that the application had not been ſucceſsful; but that his Lordſhip, after ſpeaking highly in praiſe of Johnſon, as a man who was an honour to his country, deſired Sir Joſhua to let him know, that on granting a mortgage of his penſion, he ſhould draw on his Lordſhip to the amount of five or ſix hundred pounds; and that his Lordſhip explained the meaning of the mortgage to be, that he wiſhed the buſineſs to be conducted in ſuch a manner, as that Dr. Johnſon ſhould appear to be under the leaſt poſſible obligation. Sir Joſhua mentioned, that he had by the ſame poſt communicated all this to Dr. Johnſon.</p>
               <p>How Johnſon was affected upon the occaſion will appear from what he wrote to Sir Joſhua Reynolds:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>Aſhbourne, Sept. 9. Many words I hope are not neceſſary between you and me, to convince you what gratitude is excited in my heart by the Chancellor's liberality, and your kind offices. * * * * * *</p>

But it has pleaſed GOD to reſtore me to ſo great a meaſure of health, that if I ſhould now appropriate ſo much of a fortune deſtined to do good, I could not eſcape from myſelf the charge of advancing a falſe claim. My journey to the continent, though I once thought it neceſſary, was never much encouraged by my phyſicians; and I was very deſirous that your Lordſhip ſhould be told of it by Sir Joſhua Reynolds, as an event very uncertain; for if I grew much better, I ſhould not be willing, if much worſe, not able, to migrate.—Your Lordſhip was firſt ſolicited without my knowledge; but, when I was told, that you were pleaſed to honour me with your patronage, I did not expect to hear of a refuſal; yet, as I have had no long time to brood hope, and have not rioted in imaginary opulence, this cold reception has been ſcarce a diſappointment; and, from your Lordſhip's kindneſs, I have received a benefit, which only men like you are able to beſtow.

 Having after repeated reaſonings, brought Dr. Johnſon to agree to my removing to London, and even to furniſh me with arguments in favour of what he had oppoſed; I wrote to him requeſting he would write them for me; he was ſo good as to comply, and I ſhall extract that part of his letter to me of June 11, as a proof how well he could exhibit a cautious yet encouraging view of it:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I remember, and intreat you to remember, that <hi>virtus eſt vitium fugere;</hi> the firſt approach to riches is ſecurity from poverty. The condition upon which you have my conſent to ſettle in London is, that your expence never exceeds your annual income. Fixing this baſis of ſecurity, you cannot be hurt, and you may be very much advanced. The loſs of your Scottiſh buſineſs, which is all that you can loſe, is not to be reckoned as any equivalent to the hopes and poſſibilities that open here upon you. If you ſucceed, the queſtion of prudence is at an end; every body will think that done right which ends happily; and though your expectations, of which I would not adviſe you to talk too much, ſhould not be totally anſwered, you can hardly fail to get friends who will do for you all that your preſent ſituation allows you to hope: and if, after a few years, you ſhould return to Scotland, you will return with a mind ſupplied by various converſation, and many opportunities of enquiry, with much knowledge and materials for reflection and inſtruction."</q>

On the ſame day he wrote to Mr. Langton: <q rend="inline">"I cannot but think that in  my languid and anxious ſtate, I have ſome reaſon to complain that I receive from you neither enquiry nor conſolation. You know how much I value your friendſhip, and with what confidence I expect your kindneſs, if I wanted any act of tenderneſs that you could perform; at leaſt, if you do not know it, I think your ignorance is your own fault. Yet how long is it that I have lived almoſt in your neighbourhood without the leaſt notice.—I do not, however, conſider this neglect as particularly ſhown to me; I hear two of your moſt valuable friends make the ſame complaint. But why are all thus overlooked? You are not oppreſſed by ſickneſs, you are not diſtracted by buſineſs; if you are ſick, you are ſick of leiſure:—And allow yourſelf to be told, that no diſeaſe is more to be dreaded or avoided. Rather to do nothing than to do good, is the loweſt ſtate of a degraded mind. Boileau ſays to his pupil,

That voluntary debility, which modern language is content to term indolence, will, if it is not counteracted by reſolution, render in time the ſtrongeſt faculties lifeleſs, and turn the flame to the ſmoke of virtue.—I do not expect nor deſire to ſee you, becauſe I am much pleaſed to find that your mother ſtays ſo long with you, and I ſhould think you neither elegant nor grateful, if you did not ſtudy her gratification. You will pay my reſpects to both the ladies, and to all the young people.—I am going Northward for a while, to try what help the country can give me; but, if you will write, the letter will come after me."</q>

               <p>During his abſence from London he kept up a correſpondence with ſeveral of his friends, from which I ſhall ſelect what appears to me proper for publication, without attending nicely to chronological order.</p>
               <p>To Dr. BROCKLESBY, he writes, Aſhbourne, July 20. <q rend="inline">"The kind attention which you have ſo long ſhewn to my health and happineſs, makes it as much a debt of gratitude as a call of intereſt, to give you an account of what befals me, when accident recovers me from your immediate care.—The journey of the firſt day was performed with very little ſenſe of fatigue; the ſecond day brought me to Lichfield, without much laſſitude, but I am afraid that I could not have borne ſuch violent agitation for many days together.
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:0548300102:540" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Tell Dr. Heberden, that in the coach I read 'Ciceronianus,' which I concluded as I entered Lichfield. My affection and underſtanding went along with Eraſmus, except that once or twice he ſomewhat unſkilfully entangles Cicero's civil or moral, with his rhetorical character.—I ſtaid five days at Lichfield, but, being unable to walk, had no great pleaſure, and yeſterday (19th) I came hither, where I am to try what air and attention can perform.—Of any improvement in my health I cannot yet pleaſe myſelf with the perception. * * * * * *.—The aſthma has no abatement. Opiates ſtop the fit, ſo as that I can ſit and ſometimes lie eaſy, but they do not now procure me the power of motion; and I am afraid that my general ſtrength of body does not encreaſe. The weather indeed is not benign; but how low is he ſunk whoſe ſtrength depends upon the weather!—I am now looking into Floyer, who lived with his aſthma to almoſt his ninetieth year. His book by want of order is obſcure, and his aſthma, I think, not of the ſame kind with mine. Something however I may perhaps learn.—My appetite ſtill continues keen enough; and what I conſider as a ſymptom of radical health, I have a voracious delight in raw ſummer fruit, of which I was leſs eager a few years ago.—You will be pleaſed to communicate this account to Dr. Heberden, and if any thing is to be done, let me have your joint opinion.—Now—<hi>abite curae</hi>—let me enquire after the Club <note n="8" place="bottom">At the Eſſex Head, Eſſex-ſtreet.</note>."</q>

My comfort is, that he appeared to live like a man that had always before his eyes the fragility of our preſent exiſtence, and was therefore, I hope, not unprepared to meet his judge.—Your attention, dear Sir, and that of Dr. Heberden, to my health is extremely kind.

I went to church yeſterday, after a very liberal dinner, without any inconvenience; it is indeed no long walk, but I never walked it without difficulty, ſince I came, before. ****** the intention was only to overpower the ſeeming <hi>vis inertiae</hi> of the pectoral and pulmonary muſcles.—I am favoured with a degree of eaſe that very much delights me, and do not deſpair of another race upon the ſtairs of the Academy.—If I were, however, of a humour to ſee, or to ſhow the ſtate of my body, on the dark ſide, I might ſay,

               <p>Auguſt 19. <q rend="inline">"The relaxation of the aſthma ſtill continues, yet I do not truſt it wholly to itſelf, but ſoothe it now and then with an opiate. I not only perform the perpetual act of reſpiration with leſs labour, but I can walk with fewer intervals of reſt, and with greater freedom of motion.—I never thought well of Dr. James's compounded medicines; his ingredients appeared to me ſometimes inefficacious and trifling, and ſometimes heterogeneous and
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:0548300102:542" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 deſtructive of each other. This preſcription exhibits a compoſition of about three hundred and thirty grains, in which there are four grains of emetick tartar, and ſix drops thebaick tincture. He that writes thus, ſurely writes for ſhow. The baſis of his medicine is the gum ammoniacum, which dear Dr. Lawrence uſed to give, but of which I never ſaw any effect.

It is pity that philoſophers have been diſappointed, and ſhame that they have been cheated; but I know not well how to prevent either. Of this experiment I have read nothing; where was it exhibited? and who was the man that ran away with ſo much money?—Continue, dear Sir, to write often and more at a time; for none of your preſcriptions operate to their proper uſes more certainly than your letters operate as cordials."</q>

But every man is moſt free with his beſt friends, becauſe he does not ſuppoſe that they can ſuſpect him of intentional incivility.—One reaſon for my omiſſion is, that
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:0548300102:545" rendition="simple:additions"/>
being in a place to which you are wholly a ſtranger, I have no topicks of  correſpondence. If you had any knowledge of Aſhbourne, I could tell you of two Aſhbourne men, who, being laſt week condemned at Derby to be hanged for a robbery, went and hanged themſelves in their cell. But this, however it may ſupply us with talk, is nothing to you.—Your kindneſs, I know, would make you glad to hear ſome good of me, but I have not much good to tell; if I grow not worſe, it is all that I can ſay.—I hope Mrs. Hoole receives more help from her migration. Make her my compliments, and write again to, dear Sir, your affectionate ſervant."</q>

I hope we ſhall both be the better for each other's friendſhip, and I hope we ſhall not very quickly be parted.—Tell Mr. Nichols, that I ſhall be glad of his correſpondence, when his buſineſs allows him a little remiſſion; though to wiſh him leſs buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that I may have more pleaſure, would be too ſelfiſh.—To pay for ſeats at the balloon is not very neceſſary, becauſe, in leſs than a minute, they who gaze at a mile's diſtance will ſee all that can be ſeen. About the wings, I am of your mind; they cannot at all aſſiſt it, nor I think regulate its motion.—I am now grown ſomewhat eaſier in my body, but my mind is ſometimes depreſſed.—About the Club, I am in no great pain.

recriminate, and to charge me with forgetfulneſs of the abſent. I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore  delay no longer to give an account of myſelf, and wiſh I could relate what would pleaſe either myſelf or my friend.—On July 13, I left London, partly in hope of help from new air and change of place, and partly excited by the ſick man's impatience of the preſent. I got to Lichfield in a ſtage vehicle, with very little fatigue, in two days, and had the conſolation to find, that ſince my laſt viſit my three old acquaintance are all dead.—July 20, I went to Aſhbourne, where I have been till now; the houſe in which we live is repair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

Let us not neglect one another for the little time which Providence allows us to hope.—Of my health I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell you, what my wiſhes perſuaded me to expect, that it is much improved by the ſeaſon or by remedies. I am ſleepleſs; my legs grow weary with a very few ſteps, and the water breaks its boundaries in ſome degree. The aſthma, however, has remitted; my breath is ſtill much obſtructed, but is more free than it was. Nights of watchfulneſs produce torpid days; I read very little, though I am alone; for I am tempted to ſupply in the day what I loſt in bed.—This is my hiſtory, like all other hiſtories, a narrative of miſery. Yet am I ſo much better than in the beginning of the year, that I ought to be aſhamed of complaining. I now ſit and write with very little ſenſibility of pain or weakneſs; but when I riſe, I ſhall find my legs betraying me.—Of the money which you mentioned I have no immediate need; keep it, however for me, unleſs ſome exigence requires it. Your papers I will ſhew you certainly when you would ſee them, but I am a little angry at you for not keeping minutes of your own <hi>acceptum et expenſum,</hi> and think a little time might be ſpared from Ariſtophanes, for the <hi>res familiares.</hi> Forgive me, for I mean well.—I hope, dear Sir, that you and Lady Rothes, and all the young people, too many to enumerate, are well and happy.

                     <p>CONSIDERING what reaſon you gave me in the ſpring to conclude that you took part in whatever good or evil might befal me, I ought not to have omitted ſo long the account which I am now about to give you.—My diſeaſes are an aſthma and a dropſy, and, what is leſs curable, ſeventy-five. Of the dropſy, in the beginning of the ſummer, or in the ſpring, I recovered to a degree which ſtruck with wonder both me and my phyſicians: the aſthma now is likewiſe, for a time, very much relieved. I went to Oxford, where the aſthma was very tyrannical, and the dropſy began again to threaten me, but ſeaſonable phyſick ſtopped the inundation: I then returned to London, and in July took a reſolution to viſit Staffordſhire and Derbyſhire, where I am yet ſtruggling with my diſeaſes. The dropſy made another attack, and was not eaſily ejected, but at laſt gave way. The aſthma ſuddenly remitted in bed, on the 13th of Auguſt, and, though now very oppreſſive, is, I think, ſtill ſomething gentler than it was before the remiſſion. My limbs are miſerably debilitated, and my nights are ſleepleſs and tedious.—When you read this, dear Sir, you are not ſorry that I wrote no ſooner. I will not prolong my complaints. I hope ſtill to ſee you <hi>in a happier hour,</hi> to talk over what we have often talked, and perhaps to find new topicks of merriment, or new incitements to curioſity.</p>

Mr. Davies ſeems to have repreſented my little tendency to recovery in terms too ſplendid. I am ſtill reſtleſs, ſtill weak, ſtill watry, but the aſthma is leſs oppreſſive.—Poor Ramſay <note n="5" place="bottom">Allan Ramſay, Eſq. painter to his Majeſty, who died about this time, much regretted by his friends.</note>! On which ſide ſoever I turn, mortality preſents its formidable frown. I left three old friends at Lichfield, when I was laſt there, and now found them all dead.

I have, however, yet a great deal to overcome, before I can yet attain  even an old man's health.—Write, do write to me now and then; we are now old acquaintance, and perhaps few people have lived ſo much and ſo long together, with leſs cauſe of complaint on either ſide.

I ſhould certainly have been very glad to give ſo ſkilful a lover of antiquities any information about my native place, of which, however, I know not much, and have reaſon to believe that not much is known.—Though I have not given you any amuſement, I have received amuſement from you. At Aſhbourne, where I had very little company, I had the luck to borrow 'Mr. Bowyer's Life;' a book ſo full of contemporary hiſtory, that a literary man muſt find ſome of his old friends. I thought that I could now and then have told you ſome hints worth your notice; and perhaps we may talk a life over. I hope we ſhall be much together; you muſt now be to me what you were before, and what dear Mr. Allen was, beſides.

               <p>This various maſs of correſpondence, which I have thus brought together, is valuable both as an addition to the ſtore which the publick already has of Johnſon's writings, and as exhibiting a genuine and noble ſpecimen of vigour and vivacity of mind, which neither age nor ſickneſs could impair or diminiſh.</p>
               <p>It may be obſerved, that his writing in every way, whether for the publick, or privately to his friends, was by fits and ſtarts; for we ſee frequently, that a number of letters are written on the ſame day.

 While in the country, notwithſtanding the accumulation of illneſs which he endured, his mind did not loſe its powers. He tranſlated an Ode of Horace, which is printed in his Works, and compoſed ſeveral prayers. I ſhall inſert one of them, which is ſo wiſe and energetick, ſo philoſophical and ſo pious, that I doubt not of its affording conſolation to many a ſincere Chriſtian, when in a ſtate of mind to which I believe the beſt are ſometimes liable <note n="6" place="bottom">

               <p>And here I am enabled fully to refute a very unjuſt reflection both againſt Dr. Johnſon, and his faithful ſervant, Mr. Francis Barber, by Sir John Hawkins, as if both of them had been guilty of culpable neglect towards a perſon of the name of Heely, whom Sir John chooſes to call a <hi>relation</hi> of Dr. Johnſon's. The fact is, that Mr. Heely was not his relation; he had indeed been married to one of his couſins, but ſhe had died without having children, and he had married another woman, ſo that even the ſlight connection which there once had been by <hi>alliance</hi> was diſſolved. Dr. Johnſon, who had ſhewn very great liberality to this man while his firſt wife was alive, as has appeared in a former part of this work <note n="7" place="bottom">Vol. I. p. 289.</note>, was humane and charitable enough to continue his bounty to him occaſionally; but ſurely there was no ſtrong call of duty upon him or upon his legatee, to do more. The following letter, obligingly communicated to me by Mr. Andrew Strahan, will confirm what I have ſtated:

               <p>Indeed it is very neceſſary to keep in mind that Sir John Hawkins has unaccountably viewed Johnſon's character and conduct in almoſt every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular with an unhappy prejudice <note n="8" place="bottom">
                     <p>I ſhall add one inſtance only to thoſe on which I have thought it incumbent on me to obſerve. Talking of Mr. Garrick's having ſignified his willingneſs to let Johnſon have the loan of any of his books to aſſiſt him in his edition of Shakſpeare; Sir John ſays (page 444) <q rend="inline">"Mr. Garrick knew not what riſque he ran by this offer. Johnſon had ſo ſtrange a forgetfulneſs of obligations of this ſort, that few who lent him books ever ſaw them again."</q> This ſurely conveys a moſt unfavourable inſinuation, and has been ſo underſtood. Sir John mentions the ſingle caſe of a curious edition of Politian, which he tells us, <q rend="inline">"appeared to belong to Pembroke-College, and which, probably, had been conſidered by Johnſon as his own, for upwards of fifty years."</q> Would it not be fairer to conſider this as an inadvertence, and draw no general inference? The truth is, that Johnſon was ſo attentive, that in one of his manuſcripts in my poſſeſſion, he has marked in two columns books borrowed, and books lent.</p>
                     <p>In Sir John Hawkins's compilation, there are, however, ſome paſſages concerning Johnſon which have unqueſtionable merit. One of them I ſhall tranſcribe, in juſtice to a writer whom I have had too much occaſion to cenſure, and to ſhew my fairneſs as the biographer of my illuſtrious friend: <q rend="inline">"There was wanting in his conduct and behaviour, that dignity which reſults from a regular and orderly courſe of action, and by an irreſiſtible power commands eſteem. He could not be ſaid to be a ſtayed man, nor ſo to have adjuſted in his mind the balance of reaſon and paſſion, as to give occaſion to ſay what may be obſerved of ſome men, that all they do is juſt, fit, and right."</q>

                  </note>.</p>
               <p>We now behold Johnſon for the laſt time, in his native city, for which he ever retained a warm affection, and which by a ſudden apoſtrophe under the word <hi>Lich,</hi> he introduces with reverence, into his immortal work THE ENGLISH DICTIONARY—<hi>Salve magna parens</hi> 
                  <note n="9" place="bottom">The following circumſtance, mutually to the honour of Johnſon and the corporation of his native city, has been communicated to me by the Reverend Dr. Vyſe, from the Town-Clerk: <q rend="inline">"Mr. Simpſon has now before him, a record of the reſpect and veneration which the Corporation of Lichfield, in the year 1767, had for the merits and learning of Dr. Johnſon. His father built the corner-houſe in the Market-place, the two fronts of which, towards Market and Broad-market-ſtreet, ſtood upon waſte land of the Corporation, under a forty years' leaſe, which was then expired. On the 15th of Auguſt, 1767, at a common-hall of the bailiffs and citizens, it was ordered (and that without any ſollicitation) that a leaſe ſhould be granted to Samuel Johnſon, Doctor of Laws, of the incroachments at his houſe, for the term of ninety-nine years, at the old rent, which was five ſhillings. Of which, as Town-Clerk, Mr. Simpſon had the honour and pleaſure of informing him, and that he was deſired to accept it, without paying any fine on the occaſion, which leaſe was afterwards granted, and the Doctor died poſſeſſed of this property."</q>
                  </note>! While here, he felt a revival of all the
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:0548300102:554" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 tenderneſs of filial affection, an inſtance of which appeared in his ordering the grave-ſtone and inſcription, over Elizabeth Blaney <note n="1" place="bottom">See Vol. I. p. 9.</note>, to be ſubſtantially and carefully renewed.</p>
               <p>To Mr. Henry White, a young clergyman, with whom he now formed an intimacy, ſo as to talk to him with great freedom, he mentioned that he could not in general accuſe himſelf of having been an undutiful ſon. <q rend="inline">"Once, indeed (ſaid he) I was diſobedient; I refuſed to attend my father to Uttoxeter-market. Pride was the ſource of that refuſal, and the remembrance of it was painful. A few years ago, I deſired to atone for this fault; I went to Uttoxeter in very bad weather, and ſtood for a conſiderable time bare-headed in the rain, on the ſpot where my father's ſtall uſed to ſtand. In contrition I ſtood, and I hope the pennance was expiatory."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"I told him (ſays Miſs Seward) in one of my lateſt viſits to him, of a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful learned pig, which I had ſeen at Nottingham; and which did all that we have obſerved exhibited by dogs and horſes. The ſubject amuſed him. 'Then (ſaid he) the pigs are a race unjuſtly calumniated. <hi>Pig</hi> has, it ſeems, <hi>not</hi> been wanting to <hi>man,</hi> but <hi>man</hi> to <hi>pig.</hi> We do not allow <hi>time</hi> for his education, we kill him at a year old.' Mr. Henry White, who was preſent, obſerved that if this inſtance had happened in or before Pope's time, he would not have been juſtified in inſtancing the ſwine as the loweſt degree of groveling inſtinct. Doctor Johnſon ſeemed pleaſed with the obſervation, while the perſon who made it proceeded to remark, that great torture muſt have been employed, ere the indocility of the animal could have been ſubdued.—'Certainly (ſaid the Doctor) but (turning to me); how old is your pig?' I told him three years old. 'Then (ſaid he) the pig has no cauſe to complain; he would have been killed the firſt year if he had not been <hi>educated,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted exiſtence is a good recompence for very conſiderable degrees of torture."</q>
               </p>
               <p>As Johnſon had now very faint hopes of recovery, and as Mrs. Thrale was no longer devoted to him, it might have been ſuppoſed that he would naturally have choſen to remain in the comfortable houſe of his beloved wife's daughter, and end his life where he began it. But there was in him an animated and lofty ſpirit <note n="2" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mr. Burke ſuggeſted to me as applicable to Johnſon, what Cicero, in his</hi> Cato Major, <hi>ſays of</hi> Appius, <q rend="inline">"Intentum enim animum tanquam arcum habebat, nec langueſcens ſuccumbebat ſenectuti;"</q> 
                     <hi>repeating at the ſame time, the following noble words in the ſame paſſage:</hi> 
                     <q rend="inline">"Ita enim ſenectus honeſta eſt ſi ſe ipſa defendit, ſi jus ſuum retinet, ſi uemini emancipata eſt, ſi uſque ad extremum vitae ſpiritum vindicet jus ſuum."</q>
                  </note>, and however complicated diſeaſes might depreſs
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:0548300102:555" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ordinary mortals, all who ſaw him, beheld and acknowledged the <hi>invictum animum Catonis.</hi> Such was his intellectual ardour even at this time, that he ſaid to one friend, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I look upon every day to be loſt in which I do not make a new acquaintance."</q> And to another, when talking of his illneſs, <q rend="inline">"I will be conquered; I will not capitulate."</q> And ſuch was his love of London, ſo high a reliſh had he of its magnificent extent, and variety of intellectual entertainment, that he languiſhed when abſent from it, his mind having become quite luxurious from the long habit of enjoying the metropolis; and therefore although at Lichfield, ſurrounded with friends, who loved and revered him, and for whom he had a very ſincere affection, he ſtill found that ſuch converſation as London affords, could be found no where elſe. Theſe feelings, joined probably to ſome flattering hopes of aid, from the eminent phyſicians and ſurgeons in London, who kindly and generouſly attended him without accepting of fees, made him reſolve to return to the capital.</p>
               <p>From Lichfield he came to Birmingham, where he paſſed a few days with his worthy old ſchoolfellow, Mr. Hector, who thus writes to me: <q rend="inline">"He was very ſolicitous with me to recollect ſome of our moſt early tranſactions, and tranſmit them to him, for I perceived nothing gave him greater pleaſure than calling to mind thoſe days of our innocence. I complied with his requeſt, and he only received them a few days before his death. I have tranſcribed for your inſpection, exactly the minutes I wrote to him."</q> This paper having been found in his repoſitories after his death, Sir John Hawkins has inſerted it entire, and I have made occaſional uſe of it, and other communications from Mr. Hector, in the courſe of this work. I have both viſited and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponded with him ſince Dr. Johnſon's death, and by aſking a great variety of particulars have obtained additional information. I followed the ſame mode with the Reverend Dr. Taylor, in whoſe preſence I wrote down a good deal of what he could tell; and he, at my requeſt, ſigned his name, to give it authenticity. It is very rare to find any perſon who is able to give a diſtinct account of the life even of one whom he has known intimately, without queſtions being put to them. My friend, Dr. Kippis, has told me, that on this account it is a practice with him to draw out a biographical catechiſm.</p>
               <p>Johnſon then proceeded to Oxford, where he was again kindly received by Dr. Adams, who was pleaſed to give me the following account in one of his letters (17th Feb. 1785): <q rend="inline">"His laſt viſit was, I believe, to my houſe, which he left after a ſtay of four or five days. We had much ſerious talk together, for which I ought to be the better as long as I live. You will remember ſome diſcourſe which we had in the ſummer upon the ſubject of prayer, and
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:0548300102:556" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 the difficulty of this ſort of compoſition. He reminded me of this, and of my having wiſhed him to try his hand, and to give us a ſpecimen of the ſtyle and manner that he approved. He added, that he was now in a right frame of mind, and as he could not poſſibly employ his time better, he would in earneſt ſet about it. But I find upon enquiry, that no papers of this ſort were left behind him, except a few ſhort ejaculatory forms ſuitable to his preſent ſituation."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Dr. Adams had not then received accurate information on this ſubject; for it has ſince appeared that various prayers had been compoſed by him at different periods, which intermingled with pious reſolutions, and ſome ſhort notes of his life, were entitled by him <q rend="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</q> and have in purſuance of his earneſt requiſition in the hopes of doing good, been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, with a judicious well-written Preface, by the Reverend Mr. Strahan, to whom he delivered them. This admirable collection, to which I have frequently referred in the courſe of this work, evinces, beyond all his compoſitions for the publick, and all the eulogies of his friends and admirers, the ſincere virtue and piety of Johnſon. It proves with unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able authenticity, that amidſt all his conſtitutional infirmities, his earneſtneſs to conform his practice to the precepts of Chriſtianity was unceaſing, and that he habitually endeavoured to refer every tranſaction of his life to the will of the Supreme Being.</p>
               <p>He arrived in London on the 16th of November, and next day ſent to Dr. Burney, the following note, which I inſert as the laſt token of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of this ingenious and amiable man, and as another of the many proofs of the tenderneſs and benignity of his heart.</p>

His correſpondence with me after his letter on the ſubject of my ſettling  in London, ſhall now ſo far as is proper, be produced in one ſeries.</p>
               <p>July 26, he wrote to me from Aſhbourne; <q rend="inline">"On the 14th I came to Lichfield, and found every body glad enough to ſee me. On the 20th, I came hither, and found a houſe half built, of very uncomfortable appearance, but my own room has not been altered. That a man worn with diſeaſes, in his ſeventy-ſecond or third year, ſhould condemn part of his remaining life to paſs among ruins and rubbiſh, and that no inconſiderable part, appears to me very ſtrange.—I know that your kindneſs makes you impatient to know the ſtate of my health, in which I cannot boaſt of much improvement. I came through the journey without much inconvenience, but when I attempt ſelf-motion I find my legs weak, and my breath very ſhort; this day I have been much diſordered. I have no company; the Doctor is buſy in his fields, and goes to bed at nine, and his whole ſyſtem is ſo different from mine, that we ſeem formed for different elements; I have, therefore, all my amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſeek within myſelf."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having written to him in bad ſpirits, a letter filled with dejection and fretfulneſs, and at the ſame time expreſſing anxious apprehenſions concerning him, on account of a dream which had diſturbed me; his anſwer was chiefly in terms of reproach, for a ſuppoſed charge of <q rend="inline">"affecting diſcontent, and indulging the vanity of complaint."</q> It however proceeded, <q rend="inline">"Write to me often, and write like a man. I conſider your fidelity and tenderneſs as a great part of the comforts which are yet left me, and ſincerely wiſh we could be nearer to each other.—* * * * * * * *.—My dear friend, life is very ſhort and very uncertain; let us ſpend it as well as we can.—My worthy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, Allen, is dead.

               </p>
               <p>Feeling very ſoon, that the manner in which he had written might hurt me, he in two days after, July 28, wrote to me again, giving me an account of his ſufferings, after which follows: <q rend="inline">"Before this letter you will have had one which I hope you will not take amiſs; for it contains only truth, and that truth kindly intended. * * * * * * *. <hi>Spartam quam nactus es orna;</hi> make the moſt and beſt of your lot, and compare yourſelf not with the few that are above you, but with the multitudes which are below you. * * * * * *.

               <p>I unfortunately was ſo much indiſpoſed during a conſiderable part of the year, that it was not, or at leaſt I thought it was not, in my power to write to my illuſtrious friend as formerly, or without expreſſing ſuch complaints as offended him.

               <p>Yet it was not a little painful to me to find, that in a paragraph of this letter, which I have omitted, he ſtill perſevered in arraigning me as before, which was ſtrange in him who had ſo much experience of what I ſuffered. I however wrote to him two as kind letters as I could; the laſt of which came too late to be read by him, for his illneſs encreaſed more rapidly upon him than I had apprehended; but I had the conſolation of being informed that he ſpoke of me on his death-bed, with affection, and I look forward with humble hope of renewing our friendſhip in a better world.</p>

               <p>Soon after Johnſon's return to the metropolis, both the aſthma and dropſy became more violent and diſtreſsful. He had for ſome time kept a journal in Latin, of the ſtate of his illneſs, and the remedies which he uſed, under the

                     <p>Johnſon's extraordinary facility of compoſition, when he ſhook off his conſtitutional indolence, and reſolutely ſate down to write, is admirably deſcribed by Mr. Courtenay, in his <q rend="inline">"Poetical Review,"</q> which I have ſeveral times quoted:</p>

                        <lg>
                           <l>"While through life's maze he ſent a piercing view,</l>

                     <p>We ſhall in vain endeavour to know with exact preciſion every production of Johnſon's pen. He owned to me, that he had written about forty ſermons; but as I underſtood that he had given or ſold them to different perſons, who were to preach them as their own, he did not conſider himſelf at liberty to acknowledge them. Would thoſe who were thus aided by him, who are ſtill alive, and the friends of thoſe who are dead, fairly inform the world, it would be obligingly gratifying a reaſonable curioſity, to which there ſhould, I think, now be no objection.—I have lying before me, in his hand-writing, a fragment of twenty quarto leaves, of a tranſlation into Engliſh of Salluſt, <hi>De Bello Catalinario.</hi> When it was done I have no notion; but it ſeems to have no very ſuperiour merit to mark it as his. Beſides thoſe publications, which with all my chronological care I have aſcertained in the courſe of this work, I am ſatisfied, from internal evidence, to admit alſo as genuine the following:</p>
                     <p>
                        <q rend="inline">"Conſiderations on the Caſe of Dr. Trapp's Sermons,†"</q> publiſhed in 1739, in the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Magazine. It is a very ingenious defence of the right of <hi>abridging</hi> an authour's work, without being held as infringing his property. This is one of the niceſt queſtions in the <hi>Law of Literature;</hi> and I cannot help thinking, that the indulgence of abridging is often exceedingly injurious to authours and bookſellers, and ſhould in very few caſes be permitted.</p>
                     <p>Dedication for Mrs. Lennox to the Earl of Middleſex, of her <q rend="inline">"Female Quixote,"</q> in 1762.†</p>
                     <p>Preface to the Catalogue of the Artiſts' Exhibition in 1762.†</p>
                     <p>Preface to Baretti's <q rend="inline">"Eaſy Leſſons in Italian and Engliſh,"</q> in 1775.†</p>
                     <p>But, though it has been confidently aſcribed to him, I cannot allow that he wrote a Dedication to both Houſes of Parliament of a book entitled <q rend="inline">"The Evangelical Hiſtory Harmonized,"</q> He was no <hi>croaker;</hi> no declaimer againſt <hi>the times.</hi> He would not have written, <q rend="inline">"That we are fallen upon an age in which corruption is not barely univerſal, is univerſally confeſſed."</q> Nor, <q rend="inline">"Rapine preys on the publick without oppoſition, and perjury betrays it without inquiry."</q> Nor would he, to excite a ſpeedy reformation, have conjured up ſuch phantoms of terrour as theſe: <q rend="inline">"A few years longer, and perhaps all endeavours will be in vain. We may be ſwallowed by an earthquake; we may be delivered to our enemies."</q> This is not Johnſonian.</p>
                     <p>There are indeed, in this Dedication, ſeveral ſentences conſtructed upon the model of thoſe of Johnſon. But the imitation of the form, without the ſpirit of his ſtyle, has been ſo general, that this of itſelf is not ſufficient evidence. Even our news-paper writers aſpire to it. In an account of the funeral of Edwin the comedian, in <q rend="inline">"The Diary"</q> of Nov. 9, 1790, that ſon of drollery is thus deſcribed: <q rend="inline">"A man who had ſo often cheered the ſullenneſs of vacancy, and ſuſpended the approaches of ſorrow."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>I have not thought it neceſſary to ſpecify every copy of verſes written by Johnſon, it being my intention to publiſh an authentick edition of all his Poetry, with Notes.</p>
                  </note> did not fail. He drew out and gave to his
<pb n="558" facs="tcp:0548300102:560"/>
 friend Mr. John Nichols, what perhaps he alone could have done, a liſt of the authours of the Univerſal Hiſtory, mentioning their ſeveral ſhares in that
<pb n="559" facs="tcp:0548300102:561" rendition="simple:additions"/>
work. It has, according to his direction, been depoſited in the Britiſh  Muſeum, and is printed in the Gentleman's Magazine for December, 1784.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="560" facs="tcp:0548300102:562" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 During his ſleepleſs nights he amuſed himſelf by tranſlating into Latin verſe, from the Greek, many of the epigrams in the <hi>Anthologia.</hi> Theſe tranſlations, with ſome other poems by him in Latin, he gave to his friend Mr. Langton, who, having added a few notes, ſold them to the bookſellers for a ſmall ſum, to be given to ſome of Johnſon's relations, which was accordingly done; and they are printed in the collection of his works.</p>
               <p>A very erroneous notion has circulated as to Johnſon's deficiency in the knowledge of the Greek language, partly owing to the modeſty with which, from knowing how much there was to be learnt, he uſed to mention his own comparative acquiſitions. When Mr. Cumberland<note n="4" place="bottom">Mr. Cumberland aſſures me, that he was always treated with great courteſy by Dr. Johnſon, who, in his <q rend="inline">"Letters to Mrs. Thrale,"</q> Vol. II. p. 68, thus ſpeaks of that learned, ingenious, and accompliſhed gentleman: <q rend="inline">"The want of company is an inconvenience: but Mr. Cumberland is a million."</q>
                  </note> talked to him of the Greek fragments which are ſo well illuſtrated in <q rend="inline">"The Obſerver,"</q> and of the Greek dramatiſts in general, he candidly acknowledged his inſufficiency in that particular branch of Greek literature. Yet it may be ſaid, that though not a great, he was a good Greek ſcholar. Mr. Burney, who is univerſally acknowledged by the beſt judges, to be one of the few men of this age who are very eminent for their ſkill in that noble language, has aſſured me, that Johnſon could give a Greek word for almoſt every Engliſh one; and that although not ſufficiently converſant in the niceties of the language, he upon ſome occaſions diſcovered, even in theſe, a conſiderable degree of critical acumen. Mr. Dalzell, Profeſſor of Greek at Edinburgh, whoſe ſkill in it is unqueſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, mentioned to me, in very liberal terms, the impreſſion which was made upon him by Johnſon, in a converſation which they had in London concerning that language. As Johnſon, therefore, was undoubtedly one of the firſt Latin ſcholars in modern times, let us not deny to his fame ſome additional ſplendour from Greek.</p>

I ſhall now fulfil my promiſe of exhibiting ſpecimens of various ſorts of  imitation of Johnſon's ſtyle.</p>
               <p>In the <q rend="inline">"Tranſactions of the Royal Iriſh Academy, 1787,"</q> there is an <q rend="inline">"Eſſay on the Style of Dr. Samuel Johnſon,"</q> by the Rev. Robert Burrowes, whoſe reſpect for the great object of his criticiſm<note n="5" place="bottom">We muſt ſmile at a little inaccuracy of metaphor in the Preface to the Tranſactions, which is written by Mr. Burrowes. The <hi>critick of the ſtyle of Johnſon</hi> having, with a juſt zeal for literature, obſerved, that the whole nation are called on to exert themſelves, afterwards ſays<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <q rend="inline">"I hey are <hi>called on</hi> by every <hi>tye</hi> which can have a laudable influence on the heart of man."</q>
                  </note> is thus evinced in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding paragraph: <q rend="inline">"I have ſingled him out from the whole body of Engliſh writers, becauſe his univerſally acknowledged beauties would be moſt apt to induce imitation; and I have treated rather on his faults than his perfections, becauſe an eſſay might comprize all the obſervations I could make upon his faults, while volumes would not be ſufficient for a treatiſe on his perfections."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. BURROWES has analyſed the compoſition of Johnſon, and pointed out its peculiarities with much acuteneſs; and I would recommend a careful peruſal of his Eſſay to thoſe, who being captivated by the union of perſpicuity and ſplendour which the writings of Johnſon contain, without having a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient portion of his vigour of mind, may be in danger of becoming bad copyiſts of his manner. I however cannot but obſerve, and I obſerve it to his credit, that this learned gentleman has himſelf caught no mean degree of the expanſion and harmony which, independent of all other circumſtances, characteriſe the ſentences of Johnſon. Thus, in the Preface to the volume in which his Eſſay appears, we find, <q rend="inline">"If it be ſaid that in ſocieties of this ſort, too much attention is frequently beſtowed on ſubjects barren and ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, it may be anſwered, that no one ſcience is ſo little connected with the reſt, as not to afford many principles whoſe uſe may extend conſiderably beyond the ſcience to which they primarily belong; and that no propoſition is ſo purely theoretical as to be totally incapable of being applied to practical purpoſes. There is no apparent connection between duration and the cycloidal arch, the properties of which duly attended to, have furniſhed us with our beſt regulated methods of meaſuring time: and he who has made himſelf maſter of the nature and affections of the logarithmick curve, is not aware that he has advanced conſiderably towards aſcertaining the proportionable denſity of the air at its various diſtances from the ſurface of the earth."</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="562" facs="tcp:0548300102:564" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 The ludicrous imitators of Johnſon's ſtyle are innumerable. Their general method is to accumulate hard words, without conſidering, that although he was fond of introducing them occaſionally, there is not a ſingle ſentence in all his writings where they are crowded together, as in the firſt verſe of the following imaginary Ode by him to Mrs. Thrale <note n="6" place="bottom">Johnſon's wiſhing to unite himſelf with this rich widow was much talked of, but I believe without foundation. The report, however, gave occaſion for a poem, not without characteriſtical merit, entitled, <q rend="inline">"Ode to Mrs. Thrale, by Samuel Johnſon, LL. D. on their ſuppoſed approaching Nuptials:"</q> printed for Mr. Faulder, in Bond-ſtreet.</note>, which appeared in the news-papers:</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"Cerviſial coctor's viduate <hi>dame,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>
                        <hi>"Opin'ſt</hi> thou this gigantick frame,</l>

               </q>
               <p>This, and a thouſand other ſuch attempts, are totally unlike the original, which the writers imagined they were turning into ridicule. There is not ſimilarity enough for burleſque, or even for caricature.</p>
               <p>Mr. COLMAN, in his <q rend="inline">"Proſe on ſeveral Occaſions,"</q> has <q rend="inline">"A Letter from LEXIPHANES; containing Propoſals for a <hi>Gloſſary</hi> or <hi>Vocabulary</hi> of the <hi>Vulgar Tongue:</hi> intended as a Supplement to a larger DICTIONARY."</q> It is evidently meant as a ſportive ſally of ridicule on Johnſon, whoſe ſtyle is thus imitated, without being groſsly overcharged. <q rend="inline">"It is eaſy to foreſee, that the idle and illiterate will complain that I have increaſed their labours by endeavouring to diminiſh them; and that I have explained what is more eaſy by what is more difficult—<hi>ignotum per ignotius.</hi> I expect, on the other hand, the liberal acknowledgements of the learned. He who is buried in ſcholaſtick retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſecluded from the aſſemblies of the gay, and remote from the circles of the polite, will at once comprehend the definitions, and be grateful for ſuch a ſeaſonable and neceſſary elucidation of his mother tongue."</q> Annexed to this letter is a ſhort ſpecimen of the work, thrown together in a vague and deſultory manner, not even adhering to alphabetical concatenation <note n="7" place="bottom">

The ſerious imitators of Johnſon's ſtyle, whether intentionally or by the  imperceptible effect of its ſtrength and animation, are, as I have had already occaſion to obſerve, ſo many, that I might introduce quotations from a great proportion of the writers in our language, ſince he appeared.

The Tartar follows his prey on the horſe which he has reared, or tends his numerous herds, which furniſh him both with food and clothing; the Arab has rendered the camel docile, and avails himſelf of its perſevering ſtrength; the Laplander has formed the rein-deer to be ſubſervient to his will; and even the people of Kamſchatka have trained their dogs to labour. This command over the inferiour creatures is one of the nobleſt prerogatives of man, and among the greateſt efforts of his wiſdom and power. Without this, his dominion is incomplete.

At ſuch a time, then, it becomes peculiarly neceſſary that the analogy of language ſhould be fully examined and underſtood; that its rules ſhould be carefully laid down; and that it ſhould be clearly known how much it contains, which being already right ſhould be defended from change and violation: how much it has that demands amendment; and how much that, for fear of greater inconveniences, muſt perhaps be left unaltered, though irregular.</p>

The  reviving power of this ſeaſon has been traced from the fields to the herds that inhabit them, and from the lower claſſes of beings up to man.

               <p>The Reverend Mr. KNOX, maſter of Tunbridge ſchool, appears to have the <hi>imitare aveo</hi> of Johnſon's ſtyle perpetually in his mind; and to his aſſiduous ſtudy of it we may partly aſcribe the extenſive popularity of his writings <note n="4" place="bottom">It were to be wiſhed, that he had imitated that great man in every reſpect, and had not followed the example of Dr. Adam Smith, in ungraciouſly attacking his venerable <hi>Alma Mater,</hi> Oxford.</note>.</p>
               <p>In his <q rend="inline">"Eſſays, Moral and Literary,"</q> No. 3, we find the following paſſage:—<q rend="inline">"The poliſh of external grace may indeed be deferred till the approach of manhood. When ſolidity is obtained by purſuing the modes preſcribed by our forefathers, then may the file be uſed. The firm ſubſtance will bear attrition, and the luſtre then acquired will be durable."</q>

               <p>There is, however, one in No. 11, which is blown up into ſuch tumidity as to be truly ludicrous. The writer means to tell us, that Members of Parliament, who have run in debt by extravagance, will ſell their votes to avoid an arreſt <note n="5" place="bottom">Mr. Knox, in his <q rend="inline">"Moral and Literary Abſtraction,"</q> may be excuſed for not knowing the political regulations of his country. No ſenator can be in the hands of a bailiff.</note>, which he thus expreſſes:—<q rend="inline">"They who build houſes and collect coſtly pictures and furniture, with the money of an honeſt artiſan or mechanick, will be very glad of emancipation from the hands of a bailiff, by a ſale of their ſenatorial ſuffrage."</q>
               </p>
               <p>But I think the moſt perfect imitation of Johnſon is a profeſſed one, entitled <q rend="inline">"A Criticiſm on Gray's Elegy in a Country Church-yard,"</q> ſaid to be written by Mr. YOUNG, Profeſſor of Greek at Glaſgow, and of which let him have the credit, unleſs a better title can be ſhewn. It has not only the peculiarities of Johnſon's ſtyle, but that very ſpecies of literary diſcuſſion and illuſtration for which he was eminent. Having already quoted ſo much from others, I ſhall refer the curious to this performance, with an aſſurance of much entertainment.</p>
               <p>Yet whatever merit there may be in any imitations of Johnſon's ſtyle, every good judge muſt ſee that they are obviouſly different from the original; for all of them are either deficient in its force, or overloaded with its pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities; and the powerful ſentiment to which it is ſuited is not to be found.</p>

 Johnſon's affection for his departed relations ſeemed to grow warmer as he approached nearer to the time when he might hope to ſee them again. It probably appeared to him that he ſhould upbraid himſelf with unkind inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, were he to leave the world, without having paid a tribute of reſpect to their memory.</p>

My readers are now at laſt to behold SAMUEL JOHNSON preparing himſelf  for that doom from which the moſt exalted powers afford no exemption to man. Death had always been to him an object of terrour; ſo that though by no means happy, he ſtill clung to life with an eagerneſs at which many have wondered. At any time when he was ill, he was very much pleaſed to be told that he looked better. An ingenious member of the <hi>Eumelian Club</hi>
                  <note n="7" place="bottom">A Club in London, founded by the learned and ingenious phyſician, Dr. Aſh, in honour of whoſe name it was called <hi>Eumelian,</hi> from the Greek <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>His own ſtate of his views of futurity will appear truly rational, and may perhaps impreſs the unthinking with ſeriouſneſs.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>You know (ſays he <note n="8" place="bottom">
                        <q rend="inline">"Letters to Mrs. Thrale,"</q> Vol. II. p. 350.</note>) I never thought confidence with reſpect to futurity any part of the character of a brave, a wife, or a good man. Bravery has no place where it can avail nothing; wiſdom impreſſes ſtrongly the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of thoſe faults, of which it is perhaps itſelf an aggravation; and goodneſs, always wiſhing to be better, and imputing every deficience to criminal negligence, and every fault to voluntary corruption, never dares to ſuppoſe the condition of forgiveneſs fulfilled, nor what is wanting in the crime ſupplied by penitence.</p>
                  <p>This is the ſtate of the beſt; but what muſt be the condition of him whoſe heart will not ſuffer him to rank himſelf among the beſt, or among the good? Such muſt be his dread of the approaching trial, as will leave him little attention to the opinion of thoſe whom he is leaving for ever; and the ſerenity that is not felt, it can be no virtue to feign.</p>
               </q>
               <p>His great fear of death, and the ſtrange dark manner in which Sir John Hawkins imparts the uneaſineſs which he expreſſed on account of offences with which he charged himſelf, may give occaſion to injurious ſuſpicions, as if there had been ſomething of more than ordinary criminality weighing upon his conſcience. On that account, therefore, as well as from the regard to truth which he inculcated <note n="9" place="bottom">See what he ſaid to Mr. Malone, p. 356 of this volume.</note>, I am to mention, (with all poſſible reſpect and
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:0548300102:570" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 delicacy however,) that his conduct after he came to London, and had aſſociated with Savage and others, was not ſo ſtrictly virtuous, in one reſpect, as when he was a younger man. It was well known, that his amorous incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations were uncommonly ſtrong and impetuous. He owned to many of his friends, that he uſed to take women of the town to taverns, and hear them relate their hiſtory. In ſhort, it muſt not be concealed, that like many other good and pious men, amongſt whom we may place the Apoſtle Paul, upon his own authority, Johnſon was not free from propenſities which were ever <q rend="inline">"warring againſt the law of his mind,"</q>—and that in his combats with them, he was ſometimes overcome.</p>
               <p>Here let the profane and licentious pauſe;—let them not thoughtleſsly ſay that Johnſon was an <hi>hypocrite,</hi> or that his <hi>principles</hi> were not firm, becauſe his <hi>practice</hi> was not uniformly conformable to what he profeſſed.</p>
               <p>Let the queſtion be conſidered independent of moral and religious aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and no man will deny that thouſands, in many inſtances, act againſt conviction. Is a prodigal, for example, an <hi>hypocrite,</hi> when he owns he is ſatisfied that his extravagance will bring him to ruin and miſery? We are <hi>ſure</hi> he <hi>believes</hi> it; but immediate inclination, ſtrengthened by indulgence, prevails over that belief in influencing his conduct. Why then ſhall credit be refuſed to the <hi>ſincerity</hi> of thoſe who acknowledge their perſuaſion of moral and religious duty, yet ſometimes fail of living as it requires? I heard Dr. Johnſon once obſerve, <q rend="inline">"There is ſomething noble in publiſhing truth, though it condemns one's ſelf <note n="1" place="bottom">
                        <q rend="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</q> 3d edit. p. 209.</note>."</q> And one who ſaid in his preſence, <q rend="inline">"he had no notion of people being in earneſt in their good profeſſions, whoſe practice was not ſuitable to them,"</q> was thus reprimanded by him:—<q rend="inline">"Sir, are you ſo groſsly ignorant of human nature as not to know that a man may be very ſincere in good principles, without having good practice <note n="2" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 374.</note>?"</q>
               </p>
               <p>But let no man encourage or ſoothe himſelf in <q rend="inline">"preſumptuous ſin,"</q> from knowing that Johnſon was ſometimes hurried into indulgences which he thought criminal. I have exhibited this circumſtance as a ſhade in ſo great a character, both from my ſacred love of truth, and to ſhew that he was not ſo weakly ſcrupulous as he has been repreſented by thoſe who imagine that the ſins of which a deep ſenſe was upon his mind, were merely ſuch little venial trifles as pouring milk into his tea on Good-Friday. His under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:0548300102:571"/>
will be defended by my ſtatement, if his conſiſtency of conduct  be in ſome degree impaired. But what wiſe man would, for momentary grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications, deliberately ſubject himſelf to ſuffer ſuch uneaſineſs as we find was experienced by Johnſon in reviewing his conduct as compared with his notion of the ethicks of the goſpel? Let the following paſſages be kept in remembrance:—<q rend="inline">"O GOD, giver and preſerver of all life, by whoſe power I was created, and by whoſe providence I am ſuſtained, look down upon me with tenderneſs and mercy; grant that I may not have been created to be finally deſtroyed; that I may not be preſerved to add wickedneſs to wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <note n="3" place="bottom">
                        <q rend="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</q> p. 47.</note>."</q>—<q rend="inline">"O LORD, let me not ſink into total depravity; look down upon me, and reſcue me at laſt from the captivity of ſin <note n="4" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 68.</note>."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Almighty and moſt merciful Father, who haſt continued my life from year to year, grant that by longer life I may become leſs deſirous of ſinful pleaſures, and more careful of eternal happineſs <note n="5" place="bottom">Ibid. 84.</note>."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Let not my years be multiplied to increaſe my guilt; but as my age advances, let me become more pure in my thoughts, more regular in my deſires, and more obedient to thy laws <note n="6" place="bottom">Ibid. 120.</note>."</q>—<q rend="inline">"Forgive, O merciful LORD, whatever I have done contrary to thy laws. Give me ſuch a ſenſe of my wickedneſs as may produce true contrition and effectual repentance; ſo that when I ſhall be called into another ſtate, I may be received among the ſinners to whom ſorrow and reformation have obtained pardon, for JESUS CHRIST'S ſake. Amen <note n="7" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 130.</note>."</q>

               <p>Such was the diſtreſs of mind, ſuch the penitence of Johnſon in his hours of privacy, and in his devout approaches to his Maker. His <hi>ſincerity</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt appear to every candid mind unqueſtionable.</p>
               <p>It is of eſſential conſequence to keep in view, that there was in this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent man's conduct no falſe principle of <hi>commutation,</hi> no <hi>deliberate</hi> indulgence in ſin, in conſideration of a counterbalance of duty.

               <p>I am conſcious that this is the moſt difficult and dangerous part of my biographical work, and I cannot but be very anxious concerning it. I truſt that I have got through it, preſerving at once my regard to truth—to my friend—and to the intereſts of virtue and religion. Nor can I apprehend that more harm can enſue from the knowledge of the irregularity of Johnſon, guarded as I have ſtated it, than from knowing that Addiſon and Parnell were intemperate in the uſe of wine; which Johnſon himſelf, in his Lives of thoſe celebrated writers, and pious men, has not forborne to record.</p>
               <p>It is not my intention to give a very minute detail of the particulars of Johnſon's remaining days, of whom it it was now evident, that the criſis was faſt approaching, when he muſt <q rend="inline">"die like men, and fall like one of the Princes."</q> Yet it will be inſtructive, as well as gratifying to the curioſity of my readers, to record a few circumſtances, on the authenticity of which they may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly rely, as I have been at the utmoſt pains to obtain them from the beſt authority.</p>
               <p>Dr. Heberden, Dr. Brockleſby, Dr. Warren, and Dr. Butter, phyſicians, generouſly attended him, without accepting of any fees, as did Mr. Cruikſhank, ſurgeon; and all that could be done from profeſſional ſkill and ability was tried, to prolong a life ſo truly valuable. He himſelf, indeed, having on account of his very bad conſtitution been perpetually applying himſelf to medical inquiries, united his own efforts with thoſe of the gentlemen who attended him; and imagining that the dropſical collection of water which oppreſſed him, might be drawn off, by making inciſions in his body, he, with his uſual reſolute defiance of pain, cut deep, when he thought that his ſurgeon had done it too tenderly <note n="1" place="bottom">This bold experiment, Sir John Hawkins has related in ſuch a manner as to ſuggeſt a charge againſt Johnſon of intentionally haſtening his end; a charge ſo very inconſiſtent with his character in every reſpect, that it is injurious even to refute it, as Sir John has thought it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to do. It is evident, that what Johnſon did in hopes of relief indicated an extraordinary eagerneſs to retard his diſſolution.</note>.</p>

About eight or ten days before his death, when Dr. Brockleſby paid him  his morning viſit, he ſeemed very low and deſponding, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"I have been as a dying man all night."</q> He then emphatically broke out, in the words of Shakſpeare,</p>
               <q>
                  <lg>
                     <l>"Can'ſt thou not miniſter to a mind diſeas'd?</l>
                     <l>"Pluck from the memory a rooted ſorrow?</l>
                     <l>"Raze out the written troubles of the brain?</l>
                     <l>"And with ſome ſweet oblivious antidote,</l>
                     <l>"Cleanſe the full boſom of that perilous ſtuff,</l>
                     <l>"Which weighs upon the heart."</l>
                  </lg>
               </q>
               <p>To which Dr. Brockleſby readily anſwered from the ſame great poet:
<q>
                     <l>"—therein the patient</l>
                     <l>"Muſt miniſter unto himſelf."</l>
                  </q>
Johnſon expreſſed himſelf much ſatisfied with the application.</p>
               <p>On another day after this, when talking on the ſubject of prayer, Dr. Brockleſby repeated from Juvenal,
<q>
                     <l>"Orandum eſt ut ſit mens ſana in corpore ſano,"</l>
                  </q>
and ſo on to the end of the tenth ſatire; but in running it quickly over he happened in the line
<q>
                     <l>"Qui ſpatium vitae extremum inter munera ponat,"</l>
                  </q>
to pronounce <hi>ſupremum</hi> for <hi>extremum;</hi> at which Johnſon's critical ear inſtantly took offence, and diſcourſing vehemently on the unmetrical effect of ſuch a lapſe, he ſhewed himſelf as full as ever of the ſpirit of the grammarian.</p>
               <p>Having no near relations, it had been for ſome time Johnſon's intention to make a liberal proviſion for his faithful ſervant, Mr. Francis Barber, whom he looked upon as particularly under his protection, and whom he had all along treated truly as an humble friend. Having aſked Dr. Brockleſby what would be a proper annuity to bequeath to a favourite ſervant, and being anſwered that it muſt depend on the circumſtances of the maſter; and that in the cafe of a nobleman fifty pounds a year was conſidered as an adequate reward for many years faithful ſervice. <q rend="inline">"Then (ſaid Johnſon) ſhall I be <hi>nobiliſſimus,</hi> for I mean to leave Frank ſeventy pounds a year, and I deſire you to tell him ſo."</q> It is ſtrange, however, to think, that Johnſon was not free from
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:0548300102:574"/>
 that general weakneſs of being averſe to execute a will, ſo that he delayed it from time to time; and had it not been for Sir John Hawkins's repeatedly urging it, I think it is probable that his kind reſolution would not have been fulfilled. After making one which, as Sir John Hawkins informs us, extended no further than the promiſed annuity, Johnſon's final diſpoſition of his property was eſtabliſhed by a Will and Codicil, of which copies are ſubjoined <note n="2" place="bottom">

                     <p>Upon theſe teſtamentary deeds it is proper to make a few obſervations.</p>
                     <p>His expreſs declaration with his dying breath of his faith as a Chriſtian, as it had been often practiſed in ſuch ſolemn writings, was of real conſequence from this great man, as the conviction of a mind equally acute and ſtrong might well overbalance the doubts of others who were his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temporaries. The expreſſion <hi>polluted</hi> may to ſome convey an impreſſion of more than ordinary contamination; but that is not warranted by its genuine meaning, as appears from <q rend="inline">"The Rambler,"</q> No. 42. The ſame word is uſed in the will of Dr. Sanderſon, Biſhop of Lincoln, who was piety itſelf.</p>
                     <p>His legacy of two hundred pounds to the repreſentatives of Mr. Innys, bookſeller in St. Paul's Church-yard, was the effect of a very worthy motive. He told Sir John Hawkins, that his father having become bankrupt, Mr. Innys had aſſiſted him with money or credit to continue his buſineſs. <q rend="inline">"This (ſaid he) I conſider as an obligation on me to be grateful to his deſcendants."</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The amount of his property proved to be conſiderably more than he had ſuppoſed it to be. Sir John Hawkins eſtimates the bequeſt to Francis Barber at a ſum little ſhort of fifteen hundred pounds, including an annuity of ſeventy pounds to be paid to him by Mr. Langton, in conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſeven hundred and fifty pounds, which Johnſon had lent to that gentleman. Sir John ſeems not a little angry at this bequeſt, and mutters <q rend="inline">"a caveat againſt oſtentatious bounty and favour to negroes."</q> But ſurely when a man has money entirely of his own acquiſition, eſpecially when he has no near relations, he may, without blame, diſpoſe of it as he pleaſes, and with great propriety to a faithful ſervant. Mr. Barber, by the recommendation of his maſter, retired to Lichfield, where he might paſs the reſt of his days in comfort.</p>
                     <p>It has been objected that Johnſon has omitted many of his beſt friends when leaving books to ſeveral as tokens of his laſt remembrance. The names of Dr. Adams, Dr. Taylor, Dr. Burney, Mr. Hector, Mr. Murphy, the Authour of this Work, and others who were intimate with him, are not to be found in his Will. This may be accounted for by conſidering, that as he was very near his diſſolution at the time, he probably mentioned ſuch as happened to occur to him; and that he may have recollected, that he had formerly ſhewn others ſuch proofs of his regard, that it was not neceſſary to crowd his Will with their names. Mrs. Lucy Porter was much diſpleaſed that nothing was left to her; but beſides what I have now ſtated, ſhe ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that ſhe had left nothing to Johnſon by her Will, which was made during his life-time, as appeared at her deceaſe.</p>
                     <p>His enumerating ſeveral perſons in one group, and leaving them <q rend="inline">"each a book at their election,"</q> might poſſibly have given occaſion to a curious queſtion as to the order of choice, had they not luckily fixed on different books. His library, though by no means handſome in its appearance, was ſold by Mr. Chriſtie for two hundred and forty-ſeven pounds, nine ſhillings, many people being deſirous to have a book which had belonged to Dr. Johnſon. In many of them he had written little notes, ſometimes tender memorials of his departed wife; as, <q rend="inline">"This was dear Tetty's book:"</q> ſometimes occaſional remarks of different ſorts. Mr. Lyſons, of Clifford's Inn, has favoured me with the two following:</p>

                     <p>In <q rend="inline">"The Reſicrucian infallible Axiomata, by John Heydon, Gent."</q> Prefixed to which are ſome verſes addreſſed to the authour, ſigned Ambr. Waters, A. M.

The conſideration of the numerous papers of which he was poſſeſſed,  ſeems to have to have ſtruck Johnſon's mind with a ſudden anxiety, and
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:0548300102:576" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 as they were in great confuſion, it is much to be lamented that he had not entruſted ſome faithful and diſcreet perſon with the care and ſelection of
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:0548300102:577" rendition="simple:additions"/>
them; inſtead of which, he, in a precipitate manner, burnt maſſes of them,  as I ſhould apprehend, with little regard to diſcrimination. Not that I ſuppoſe we have thus been deprived of any compoſitions which he had ever intended for the publick eye; but, from what eſcaped the flames, I judge that many curious circumſtances relating both to himſelf and other literary characters have periſhed.</p>
               <p>Two very valuable articles, I am ſure, we have loſt, which were two quarto volumes, containing a full, fair, and moſt particular account of his own life, from his earlieſt recollection. I owned to him, that having accidentally ſeen them, I had read a great deal in them; and apologiſing for the liberty I had taken, aſked him if I could help it. He placidly anſwered, <q rend="inline">"Why, Sir, I do not think you could have helped it."</q> I ſaid that I had for once in my life felt half an inclination to commit theft. It had come into my mind to carry off thoſe two volumes, and never ſee him more. Upon my inquiring how this would have affected him, <q rend="inline">"Sir, (ſaid h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>) I believe I ſhould have gone mad <note n="3" place="bottom">One of thoſe volumes, Sir John Hawkins informs us he put into his pocket; for which the excuſe he ſtates is, that he meant to preſerve it from falling into the hands of a perſon whom he deſcribes ſo as to make it ſufficiently clear who is meant; <q rend="inline">"having ſtrong reaſons (ſays he) to ſuſpect that this man might find and make an ill uſe of the book."</q> Why Sir John ſhould ſuppoſe that the gentleman alluded to would act in this manner, he has not thought fit to explain. But what he did was not approved of by Johnſon; who, upon being acquainted of it without delay by a friend, expreſſed great indignation, and warmly inſiſted on the book being delivered up; and, in the ſuppoſition of his afterwards miſſing it, without knowing by whom it had been taken, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"Sir, I ſhould have gone out of the world diſtruſting half mankind."</q> Sir John next day wrote a letter to Johnſon, aſſigning the reaſons for his conduct; upon which Johnſon obſerved to Mr. Langton, <q rend="inline">"Biſhop Sanderſon could not have dictated a better letter. I could almoſt ſay, <hi>Melius eſt ſic penituiſſe quam non crraſſe.</hi>"</q> The agitation into which Johnſon was thrown by this incident, probably made him haſtily burn thoſe precious records which muſt ever be regretted.</note>."</q>
               </p>
               <p>During his laſt illneſs, Johnſon experienced the ſteady and kind attachment of his numerous friends. Mr. Hoole has drawn up a narrative of what paſſed in the viſits which he paid to him during that time, from the 10th of November to the 13th of December, the day of his death incluſive, and has favoured me with a peruſal of it. Nobody was more attentive to him than
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:0548300102:578" rendition="simple:additions"/>
 Mr. Langton, to whom he tenderly ſaid, <hi>To teneam moriens deficiente manu.</hi> And I think it highly to the honour of Mr. Windham, that his important occupations as an active ſtateſman did not prevent him from paying aſſiduous reſpect to the dying Sage, whom he revered. Mr. Langton informs me, that <q rend="inline">"one day he found Mr. Burke and four or five more friends ſitting with Johnſon. Mr. Burke ſaid to him, 'I am afraid, Sir, ſuch a number of us may be oppreſſive to you.'—'No, Sir, (ſaid Johnſon,) it is not ſo; and I muſt be in a wretched ſtate indeed, when your company would not be a delight to me.' Mr. Burke, in a tremulous voice, expreſſive of being very tenderly affected, replied, 'My dear Sir, you have always been too good to me.' Immediately afterwards he went away. This was the laſt circumſtance in the acquaintance of theſe two eminent men."</q>
               </p>
               <p>It is to the mutual credit of Johnſon and divines of different communions, that although he was a ſteady Church-of-England man, there was nevertheleſs much agreeable intercourſe between him and them. Let me particularly name the late Mr. La Trobe, and Mr. Hutton of the Moravian profeſſion. His intimacy with the Engliſh Benedictines at Paris has been mentioned; and as an additional proof of the charity in which he lived with good men of the Romiſh Church, I am happy in this opportunity of recording his friendſhip with the Reverend Thomas Huſſey, D. D. His Catholick Majeſty's Chaplain of Embaſſy at the Court of London, that very reſpectable man, eminent not only for his powerful eloquence as a preacher, but for his various abilities and acquiſitions.—Nay though Johnſon loved a Preſbyterian the leaſt, this did not prevent his having a long and uninterrupted ſocial connection with the Reverend Dr. James Fordyce, who, ſince his death hath gratefully celebrated him in a warm ſtrain of devotional compoſition.</p>
               <p>Amidſt the melancholy clouds which hung over the dying Johnſon, his characteriſtical manner ſhewed itſelf on different occaſions.</p>
               <p>When Dr. Warren, in the uſual ſtyle, hoped that he was better; his anſwer was, <q rend="inline">"No, Sir. You cannot conceive with what acceleration I advance towards death."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A man whom he had never ſeen before was employed one night to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>t up with him. Being aſked next morning how he liked his attendant, his anſwer was, <q rend="inline">"Not at all, Sir. The fellow's an ideot; he is as aukward as a turn-ſpit when firſt put into the wheel, and as ſleepy as a dormouſe."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. Windham having placed a pillow conveniently to ſupport him, he thanked him for his kindneſs, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">"That will do—all that a pillow can do."</q>

He repeated with great ſpirit a poem, conſiſting of about fifteen ſtanzas  in four lines, in alternate rhymes, which he ſaid he had compoſed ſome years before, on occaſion of a young gentleman's coming of age; ſaying he had never repeated it but once ſince he compoſed it, and had given but one copy of it. From the ſpecimen of it which Mrs. Piozzi has given of it in her <q rend="inline">"Anecdotes,"</q> p. 196, it is much to be wiſhed that we could ſee the whole.</p>
               <p>As he opened a note which his ſervant brought to him, he ſaid, <q rend="inline">"An odd thought ſtrikes me.—We ſhall receive no letters in the grave."</q>
               </p>
               <p>He requeſted three things of Sir Joſhua Reynolds:—To forgive him thirty pounds which he had borrowed of him—to read the Bible—and never to uſe his pencil on a Sunday. Sir Joſhua readily acquieſced.</p>
               <p>Indeed he ſhewed the greateſt anxiety for the religious improvement of his friends, to whom he diſcourſed of its infinite conſequence. He begged of Mr. Hoole to think of what he had ſaid, and to commit it to writing; and upon being afterwards aſſured that this was done, preſſed his hands, and in an earneſt tone, thanked him. Dr. Brockleſby having attended him with the utmoſt aſſiduity and kindneſs as his phyſician and friend, he was peculiarly deſirous that this gentleman ſhould not entertain any looſe ſpeculative notions, but be confirmed in the truths of Chriſtianity, and inſiſted on his writing down in his preſence, as nearly as he could collect it, the import of what paſſed on the ſubject; and Dr. Brockleſby having complied with the requeſt, he made him ſign the paper, and urged him to keep it in his own cuſtody as long as he lived.</p>
               <p>Johnſon, with that native fortitude which amidſt all his bodily diſtreſs and mental ſufferings never forſook him, aſked Dr. Brockleſby, as a man in whom he had confidence, to tell him plainly whether he could recover. <q rend="inline">"Give me (ſaid he) a direct anſwer."</q> The Doctor having firſt aſked him if he could bear the whole truth, which way ſoever it might lead, and being anſwered that he could, declared that in his opinion he could not recover without a miracle. <q rend="inline">"Then (ſaid Johnſon) I will take no more phyſick, not even my opiates; for I have prayed that I may render up my ſoul to GOD unclouded."</q> In this reſolution he perſevered, and at the ſame time uſed only the weakeſt kinds of ſuſtenance.</p>
               <p>The Reverend Mr. Strahan, who was the ſon of his friend, and had been always one of his great favourites, had, during Johnſon's laſt illneſs, the ſatisfaction of contributing to ſoothe and comfort him. That gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's houſe at Iſlington, of which he is Vicar, afforded occaſionally and
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:0548300102:580"/>
 eaſily an agreeable change of place and freſh air; and he attended alſo upon Johnſon in town in the diſcharge of the ſacred offices of his profeſſion.</p>
               <p>Mr. Strahan has given me the agreeable aſſurance, that after being in much agitation, Johnſon became quite compoſed, and continued ſo till his death.</p>
               <p>Dr. Brockleſby, who will not be ſuſpected of fanaticiſm, obliged me with the following accounts:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>For ſome time before his death all his fears were calmed and abſorbed by the prevalence of his faith, and his truſt in the merits and <hi>propitiation</hi> of JESUS CHRIST.</p>
                  <p>He talked often to me about the neceſſity of faith in the <hi>ſacrifice</hi> of JESUS, as neceſſary beyond all good works whatever for the ſalvation of mankind.</p>
                  <p>He preſſed me to ſtudy Dr. Clarke, and to read his Sermons. I aſked him why he preſſed Dr. Clark, an Arian <note n="4" place="bottom">The change of his ſentiments with regard to Dr. Clarke, is thus mentioned to me in a letter from the late Dr. Adams, Maſter of Pembroke College, Oxford.—<q rend="inline">"The Doctor's prejudices were the ſtrongeſt, and certainly in another ſenſe the weakeſt, that ever poſſeſſed a ſenſible man. You know his extreme zeal for orthodoxy. But did you ever hear what he told me himſelf? That he had made it a rule not to admit Dr. Clarke's name in his Dictionary. This, however, wore off. At ſome diſtance of time he adviſed with me what books he ſhould read in defence of the Chriſtian Religion. I recommended 'Clarke's Evidences of Natural and Revealed Religion,' as the beſt of the kind; and I find in what is called his 'Prayers and Meditations,' that he was frequently employed in the latter part of his time in reading Clarke's Sermons.</q>
                     </note>. 'Becauſe (ſaid he) he is fulleſt on the <hi>propitiatory ſacrifice.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Johnſon having thus in his mind the true Chriſtian ſcheme, at once rational and conſolatory, uniting juſtice and mercy in the Divinity, with the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of human nature, while the Holy Sacrament was celebrating in his apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fervently uttered this prayer <note n="5" place="bottom">The Reverend Mr. Strahan took care to have it preſerved, and has inſerted it in <q rend="inline">"Prayers and Meditations,"</q> p. 222.</note>:</p>
               <p>
                  <q rend="inline">"Almighty and moſt merciful Father, I am now, as to human eyes it ſeems, about to commemorate, for the laſt time, the death of thy Son JESUS CHRIST our Saviour and Redeemer. Grant, O LORD, that my whole hope and confidence may be in his merits, and thy mercy; enforce and accept my imperfect repentance; make this commemoration available to the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my faith, the eſtabliſhment of my hope, and the enlargement of my charity; and make the death of thy Son JESUS CHRIST effectual to my

redemption. Have mercy upon me, and pardon the multitude of my  offences. Bleſs my friends; have mercy upon all men. Support me, by thy Holy Spirit, in the days of weakneſs, and at the hour of death; and receive me, at my death, to everlaſting happineſs, for the ſake of JESUS CHRIST. Amen."</q>

               <p>From my brother Thomas David I have theſe particulars:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>The Doctor, from the time that he was certain his death was near, appeared to be perfectly reſigned, was ſeldom or never fretful or out of temper, and often ſaid to his faithful ſervant, who gave me this account, <q rend="inline">'Attend, Francis, to the ſalvation of your ſoul, which is the object of greateſt importance:'</q> he alſo explained to him paſſages in the ſcripture, and ſeemed to have pleaſure in talking upon religious ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>On Monday the 13th of December, the day on which he died, a Miſs Morris, daughter to a particular friend of his, called, and ſaid to Francis, that ſhe begged to be permitted to ſee the Doctor, that ſhe might earneſtly requeſt him to give her his bleſſing. Francis went into the room, followed by the young lady, and delivered the meſſage. The Doctor turned himſelf in the bed, and ſaid, <q rend="inline">'GOD bleſs you, my dear!'</q> Theſe were the laſt words he ſpoke.—His difficulty of breathing increaſed till about ſeven o'clock in the evening, when Mr. Barber and Mrs. Deſmoulins, who were ſitting in the room, obſerving that the noiſe he made in breathing had ceaſed, went to the bed, and found he was dead.</p>
               </q>
               <p>About two days after his death, the following very agreeable account was communicated to Mr. Malone, in a letter by the Honourable John Byng, to whom I am much obliged for granting me permiſſion to introduce it in my work.</p>

                     <p>SINCE I ſaw you, I have had a long converſation with Cawſton <note n="6" place="bottom">Servant to the Right Honourable William Windham.</note>, who ſat up with Dr. Johnſon from nine o'clock on Sunday evening till ten o'clock on Monday morning. And from what I can gather from him, it ſhould ſeem, that Dr. Johnſon was perfectly compoſed, ſteady in hope, and reſigned to death. At the interval of each hour, they aſſiſted him to ſit up in his bed, and move his legs, which were in much pain; when he regularly addreſſed himſelf to ſervent prayer; and though ſometimes his voice failed him, his ſenſes never did during that time. The only ſuſtenance he received
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:0548300102:582" rendition="simple:additions"/>
was cyder and water. He ſaid his mind was prepared, and the time to his diſſolution ſeemed long. At ſix in the morning he enquired the hour, and on being informed, ſaid that all went on regularly, and he felt he had but a few hours to live.</p>
                     <p>At ten o'clock in the morning he parted from Cawſton, ſaying, <q rend="inline">'You ſhould not detain Mr. Windham's ſervant.—I thank you;—bear my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance to your maſter.'</q> Cawſton ſays, that no man could appear more collected, more devout, or leſs terrified at the thoughts of the approaching minute.</p>
                     <p>This account, which is ſo much more agreeable than, and ſomewhat different from yours, has given us the ſatisfaction of thinking that that great man died as he lived, full of reſignation, ſtrengthened in faith, and joyful in hope.</p>

               <p>A few days before his death he had aſked Sir John Hawkins, as one of his executors, where he ſhould be buried; and on being anſwered <q rend="inline">"Doubtleſs in Weſtminſter Abbey,"</q> ſeemed to feel a ſatisfaction very natural to a poet, and indeed, in my opinion, very natural to every man of any imagination, who has no family ſepulchre in which he can be laid with his fathers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Accordingly, upon Monday, December 20, his remains were depoſited in that noble and renowned edifice; and over his grave was placed a large blue flag-ſtone, with this inſcription:</p>

               <p>I truſt I ſhall not be accuſed of affectation when I declare, that I find myſelf unable to expreſs all that I felt upon the loſs of ſuch a <q rend="inline">"Guide, Philoſopher, and Friend."</q> I ſhall therefore not ſay one word of my own, but adopt thoſe of an eminent friend, which he uttered with an abrupt excellence, ſuperiour to all ſtudied compoſition:—<q rend="inline">"He has made a chaſm,

which not only nothing can fill up, but which nothing has a tendency to fill up.—Johnſon is dead.—Let us go to the next beſt.—There is nobody.—No man can be ſaid to put you in mind of Johnſon."</q>
               </p>
               <p>As Johnſon had abundant homage paid to him during his life <note n="7" place="bottom">
                     <p>Beſides the Dedications to him by Dr. Goldſmith, the Reverend Dr. Franklin, and the Reverend Mr. Wilſon, which I have mentioned according to their dates, there was one by a lady<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of a verſification of <q rend="inline">"Aningait and Ajut,"</q> and one by the ingenious Mr. Walker, of his <q rend="inline">"Rhetorical Grammar."</q> I have introduced into this work ſeveral compliments paid to him in the writings of his contemporaries; but the number of them is ſo great, that we may fairly ſay that there was almoſt a general tribute.</p>
                     <p>Let me not be forgetful of the honour done to him by Colonel Myddelton, of Gwaynynog, near Denbigh; who, on the banks of a rivulet in his Park, where Johnſon delighted to ſtand and repeat verſes, erected an urn with the following inſcription:</p>
                     <q>This ſpot was often dignified by the preſence of<lb/>SAMUEL JOHNSON, LL. D.<lb/>Whoſe moral writings, exactly conformable to the precepts of Chriſtianity,<lb/>Give ardour to Virtue and confidence to Truth.</q>

                     <p>As no inconſiderable circumſtance of his ſame, we muſt reckon the extraordinary zeal of the artiſts to extend and perpetuate his image. I can enumerate a buſt by Mr. Nollckens, and the many caſts which are made from it; ſeveral pictures by Sir Joſhua Reynolds; one by Mr. Zoffani; and one by Mr. Opie: and the following engravings of his portrait: 1. One by Cooke, from Sir Joſhua, for the Proprietors' edition of his folio Dictionary.—2. One from ditto by ditto, for their quarto edition.—3. One from Opie, by Heath, for Harriſon's edition of his Dictionary.—4. One from Nollckens's buſt of him, by Bartolozzi, for Fielding's quarto edition of his Dictionary.—5. One ſmall from Harding, by Trotter, for his <q rend="inline">"Beauties."</q>—6. One ſmall from Sir Joſhua, by Trotter, for his <q rend="inline">"Lives of the Poets."</q>—7.

One ſmall, no painter's name, etched by Taylor, for his Johnſoniana.—10. One folio whole length, with his oak ſtick, as deſcribed in Boſwell's <q rend="inline">"Tour,"</q> drawn and etched by Trotter.—11. One large mezzotinto from Sir Joſhua, by Doughty.—12. One large Roman head from Sir Joſhua, by Marchi.—13. One octavo, holding a book to his eye, from Sir Joſhua, by Hall, for his works.—14. One ſmall from a drawing from the life, and engraved by Trotter, for his Life publiſhed by Kearſley.—15. One large from Opie, by Mr. Townley, an ingenious engraver now at Berlin. This is one of the fineſt mezzotintos that ever was executed; and what renders it of extraordinary value, the plate was deſtroyed after four or five impreſſions only were taken of. One of them is in the poſſeſſion of Sir William Scott.—16. One large from Sir Joſhua's firſt picture of him, by Heath<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for this work.—17. And one for Lavater's Eſſay on Phyſiognomy, in which Johnſon's counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is analyſed upon the principles of that fanciful writer.</p>
                  </note>, ſo no writer in this nation ever had ſuch an accumulation of literary honours after his death. A ſermon upon that event was preached in St. Mary's church, Oxford, before the Univerſity, by the Reverend Mr. Agutter, of Magdalen College. The Lives, the Memoirs, the Eſſays, both in proſe and verſe,
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:0548300102:584" rendition="simple:additions"/>
which have been publiſhed concerning him, would make many volumes. The numerous attacks too upon him, I conſider as making part of his conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, upon the principle which he himſelf ſo well knew and aſſerted. Many who trembled at his preſence were forward in aſſault when they no longer apprehended danger. When one of his little pragmatical foes was invidiouſly ſnarling at his fame, the Reverend Dr. Parr exclaimed, with his uſual bold animation, <q rend="inline">"Aye, now that the old lion is dead, every ass thinks he may kick at him."</q>
               </p>
               <p>A monument for him in Weſtminſter-Abbey was reſolved upon ſoon after his death, and has been ſupported by a moſt reſpectable contribution; and in the cathedral of his native city of Lichfield a ſmaller one is to be erected. To compoſe his epitaph has excited the warmeſt competition of genius. If <hi>laudari à laudato viro</hi> be praiſe which is highly eſtimable, I ſhould not forgive myſelf were I to omit the following ſepulchral verſes on the authour of THE ENGLISH DICTIONARY, written by the Right Honourable Henry Flood:</p>

               <p>The character of SAMUEL JOHNSON has, I truſt, been ſo developed in the courſe of this work, that they who have honoured it with a peruſal, may be conſidered as well acquainted with him. As, however, it may be expected that I ſhould collect into one view the capital and diſtinguiſhing features of this extraordinary man, I ſhall endeavour to acquit myſelf of that part of my biographical undertaking <note n="8" place="bottom">As I certainly do not ſee any reaſon to give a different character of my illuſtrious friend now<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> from what I formerly gave, the greateſt part of the ſketch of him in my <q rend="inline">"Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides,"</q> is here adopted.</note>, however difficult it may be to do that which many of my readers will do better for themſelves.</p>
               <p>His figure was large and well formed, and his countenance of the caſt of an ancient ſtatue; yet his appearance was rendered ſtrange and ſomewhat uncouth, by convulſive cramps, by the ſcars of that diſtemper which it was once imagined the royal touch could cure, and by a ſlovenly mode of dreſs. He had the uſe only of one eye; yet ſo much does mind govern and even ſupply the deficiency of organs, that his viſual perceptions, as far as they
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:0548300102:585" rendition="simple:additions"/>
extended, were uncommonly quick and accurate. So morbid was his tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perament, that he never knew the natural joy of a free and vigorous uſe of his limbs: when he walked, it was like the ſtruggling gait of one in fetters; when he rode, he had no command or direction of his horſe, but was carried as if in a balloon. That with his conſtitution and habits of life he ſhould have lived ſeventy-five years, is a proof that an inherent <hi>vivida vis</hi> is a powerful preſervative of the human frame.</p>
               <p>Man is in general made up of contradictory qualities, and theſe will ever ſhew themſelves in ſtrange ſucceſſion, where a conſiſtency in appearance at leaſt, if not in reality, has not been attained by long habits of philoſophical diſcipline. In proportion to the native vigour of the mind, the contradictory qualities will be the more prominent, and more difficult to be adjuſted; and therefore we are not to wonder, that Johnſon exhibited an eminent example of this remark which I have made upon human nature. At different times he ſeemed a different man, in ſome reſpects; not, however, in any great or eſſential article, upon which he had fully employed his mind and ſettled certain principles of duty, but only in his manners, and in diſplays of argument and fancy in his talk. He was prone to ſuperſtition, but not to credulity. Though his imagination might incline him to a belief of the marvellous and the myſterious, his vigorous reaſon examined the evidence with jealouſy. He was a ſincere and zealous Chriſtian, of high Church-of-England and monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical principles, which he would not tamely ſuffer to be queſtioned; and had perhaps, at an early period, narrowed his mind ſomewhat too much, both as to religion and politicks. His being impreſſed with the danger of extreme latitude in either, though he was of a very independent ſpirit, occaſioned his appearing ſomewhat unfavourable to the prevalence of that noble freedom of ſentiment which is the beſt poſſeſſion of man. Nor can it be denied, that he had many prejudices; which, however, frequently ſuggeſted many of his pointed ſayings, that rather ſhew a playfulneſs of fancy than any ſettled malignity. He was ſteady and inflexible in maintaining the obligations of religion and morality, both from a regard for the order of ſociety, and from a veneration for the Great Source of all order; correct, nay ſtern in his taſte; hard to pleaſe, and eaſily offended; impetuous and irritable in his temper, but of a moſt humane and benevolent heart <note n="9" place="bottom">In the <hi>Olla Podrida,</hi> a collection of Eſſays publiſhed at Oxford, there is an excellent paper upon the character of Johnſon, ſaid to be written by the Reverend Dr. Horne, now Biſhop of Norwich. The following paſſage is eminently happy:—<q rend="inline">"To reject wiſdom, becauſe the perſon of him who communicates it is uncouth, and his manners are inelegant;—what is it, but to throw away a pine-apple, and aſſign for a reaſon the roughneſs of its coat?"</q>
                  </note>, which ſhewed itſelf not only
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:0548300102:586" rendition="simple:additions"/>
in a moſt liberal charity, as far as his circumſtances would allow, but in a thouſand inſtances of active benevolence. He was afflicted with a bodily diſeaſe which made him reſtleſs and fretful, and with a conſtitutional melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, the clouds of which darkened the brightneſs of his fancy, and gave a gloomy caſt to his whole courſe of thinking: we therefore ought not to wonder at his ſallies of impatience and paſſion at any time, eſpecially when provoked by obtruſive ignorance or preſuming petulance; and allowance muſt be made for his uttering haſty and ſatirical ſallies, even againſt his beſt friends. And ſurely, when it is conſidered that <q rend="inline">"amidſt ſickneſs and ſorrow"</q> he exerted his faculties in ſo many works for the benefit of mankind, and particularly that he achieved the great and admirable Dictionary of our language, we muſt be aſtoniſhed at his reſolution. The ſolemn text of <q rend="inline">"him to whom much is given, much will be required,"</q> ſeems to have been ever preſent to his mind in a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>igorous ſenſe, and to have made him diſſatisfied with his labours and acts of goodneſs, however comparatively great; ſo that the unavoidable conſciouſneſs of his ſuperiority was in that reſpect a cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet. He ſuffered ſo much from this, and from the gloom which perpetually haunted him, and made ſolitude frightful, that it may be ſaid of him, <q rend="inline">"If in this life only he had hope, he was of all men moſt miſerable."</q> He loved praiſe when it was brought to him; but was too proud to ſeek for it. He was ſomewhat ſuſceptible of flattery. As he was general and unconfined in his ſtudies, he cannot be conſidered as maſter of any one particular ſcience; but he had accumulated a vaſt and various collection of learning and knowledge, which was ſo arranged in his mind, as to be ever in readineſs to be brought forth. But his ſuperiority over other learned men conſiſted chiefly in what may be called the art of thinking, the art of uſing his mind; a certain continual power of ſeizing the uſeful ſubſtance of all that he knew, and exhibiting it in a clear and ſorcible manner; ſo that knowledge which we often ſee to be no better than lumber in men of dull underſtanding, was in him true, evident, and actual wiſdom. His moral precepts are practical; for they are drawn from an intimate acquaintance with human nature. His maxims carry conviction; for they are founded on the baſis of common ſenſe. His mind was ſo full of imagery, that he might have been perpetually a poet; yet it is remarkable, that however rich his proſe is in that reſpect, the poetical pieces which he wrote were in general not ſo, but rather ſtrong ſentiment and acute obſervation, conveyed in good verſe, particularly in heroick couplets. Though uſually grave and even aweful in his deportment, he poſſeſſed uncommon and peculiar powers of wit and humour; he frequently

indulged himſelf in colloquial pleaſantry; and the heartieſt merriment was often enjoyed in his company; with this great advantage, that as it was entirely free from any poiſonous tincture of vice or impiety, it was ſalutary to thoſe who ſhared in it. He had accuſtomed himſelf to ſuch accuracy in his common converſation <note n="1" place="bottom">

                     <p>Bayle's account of <hi>Menage</hi> may alſo be quoted as exceedingly applicable to the great ſubject of this work.—<q rend="inline">"His illuſtrious friends erected a very glorious monument to him in the collection entitled <hi>Menagiana.</hi> Thoſe, who judge of things aright, will confeſs that this collection is very proper to ſhew the extent of genius and learning which was the character of Menage. And I may be bold to ſay, that <hi>the excellent works he publiſhed will not diſtinguiſh him from other learned men ſo advantageouſly as this.</hi> To publiſh books of great learning, to make Greek and Latin verſes exceedingly well turned, is not a common talent, I own; neither is it extremely rare. It is incomparably more difficult to find men who can furniſh diſcourſe about an infinite number of things, and who can diverſify them an hundred ways. How many authours are there, who are admired for their works, on account of the vaſt learning that is diſplayed in them, who are not able to ſuſtain a converſation. Thoſe, who know Menage only by his books, might think he reſembled thoſe learned men: but if you ſhew the MENAGIANA, you diſtinguiſh him from them, and make him known by a talent which is given to very few learned men. There it appears that he was a man who ſpoke off hand a thouſand good things. His memory extended to what was ancient and modern; to the court and to the city; to the dead and to the living languages; to things ſerious and things jocoſe; in a word, to a thouſand ſorts of ſubjects. That which appeared a trifle to ſome readers of the <hi>Menagiana,</hi> who did not conſider circumſtances, cauſed admiration in other readers, who minded the difference between what a man ſpeaks without preparation, and that which he prepares for the preſs. And therefore we cannot ſufficiently commend the care which his illuſtrious friends took to erect to him a monument ſo capable of giving him immortal glory. They were not obliged to rectify what they had heard him ſay; for in ſo doing they had not been faithful hiſtorians of his converſations."</q>

                  </note>, that he at all times delivered himſelf with a force, and elegant choice of expreſſion, the effect of which was aided by his having a loud voice, and a ſlow deliberate utterance. He united a moſt logical head with a moſt fertile imagination, which gave him an extraordinary advantage in arguing; for he could reaſon cloſe or wide, as he ſaw beſt for the moment. Exulting in his intellectual ſtrength and dexterity, he could, when he pleaſed, be the greateſt ſophiſt that ever contended in the liſts of declamation; and from a ſpirit of contradiction, and a delight in ſhewing his powers, he would often maintain the wrong ſide with equal warmth and

ingenuity: ſo that, when there was an audience, his real opinions could ſeldom be gathered from his talk; though when he was in company with a ſingle friend, he would diſcuſs a ſubject with genuine fairneſs. But he was too con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious to make errour permanent and pernicious, by deliberately writing it; and in all his numerous works he earneſtly inculcated what appeared to him to be the truth. His piety was conſtant, and was the ruling principle of all his conduct; and the more we conſider his character, we ſhall be the more diſpoſed to regard him with admiration and reverence.</p>
