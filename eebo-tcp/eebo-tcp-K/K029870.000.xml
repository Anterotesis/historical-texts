            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE CASE OF THE BARBERS of <hi>LONDON.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE <hi>Barbers</hi> of <hi>London</hi> were a <hi>Fraternity</hi> before the Time of <hi>Edward the Second,</hi> and by Letters-Patent of <hi>Edward the Fourth</hi> were made a <hi>Body Corporate,</hi> and inveſted with ſeveral Powers and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges. In the 32d Year of <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> the <hi>publick</hi> Policy thought proper to <hi>unite</hi> them with another Company (not then <hi>incorporated</hi>) called the <hi>Surgeons</hi> of <hi>London,</hi> in order, (as is moſt probable) to <hi>transfer</hi> thoſe Powers and Privileges to the <hi>latter,</hi> without directly appearing to <hi>wreſt</hi> them from the <hi>former</hi> to whom they had been <hi>originally</hi> granted.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Coalition</hi> of the two Companies having now ſubſiſted above <hi>Two Hundred Years,</hi> the <hi>Barbers</hi> are ſurpris'd to find an <hi>Attempt</hi> made by the <hi>Surgeons</hi> to <hi>diſſolve</hi> it, by Authority of <hi>Parliament,</hi> without their Participation or Conſent.</p>
            <p>The <hi>principal Reaſons</hi> aſſigned by the <hi>Surgeons,</hi> in their printed Caſe, to induce the Legiſlature to this <hi>extraordinary</hi> Act of Power, are,</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Firſt,"/> That the <hi>Barbers,</hi> in the Time of <hi>Henry the Eighth,</hi> were <hi>all Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,</hi> and that the Parliament, by <hi>uniting</hi> them with others of <hi>ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior</hi> Abilities, intended <hi>their</hi> Improvement in <hi>that</hi> Profeſſion; but that they having, long ſince, <hi>ceaſed</hi> to intermeddle with any Branch of <hi>Surgery,</hi> this <hi>Intent</hi> of the Act is fruſtrated, and the laudable <hi>Purpoſe</hi> of the <hi>Union</hi> at an end.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Secondly,"/> That by this <hi>Alteration</hi> of the Circumſtances of things, the Junction of the two Companies (how advantageous ſoever in <hi>former</hi> Times) is <hi>now</hi> become highly <hi>inconvenient.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="Thirdly,"/> That the <hi>Surgeons,</hi> if <hi>diſtinctly</hi> incorporated, would be encouraged to <hi>meet</hi> and <hi>communicate</hi> to one another their Experiments and Succeſſes.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="And Fourthly,"/> That the like Separation has taken place at <hi>Paris, Edinburgh,</hi> and <hi>Glaſcow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT the <hi>firſt</hi> of theſe <hi>Reaſons</hi> is grounded on a <hi>Miſtake</hi> in point of <hi>Fact;</hi> for tho' it be <hi>true</hi> that the <hi>Barbers</hi> were <hi>all originally Surgeons,</hi> and incorporated <hi>as ſuch,</hi> yet long <hi>before</hi> the Union in queſtion, <hi>moſt</hi> of them had <hi>quitted</hi> the <hi>actual Exerciſe</hi> of that Profeſſion, and the <hi>Right</hi> itſelf of exerciſing it <hi>in virtue</hi> of their Charter, had been

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>annot <hi>now,</hi> with any Propriety, be inſiſted on as a <hi>Reaſon</hi> for their <hi>Separation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>With regard to the <hi>Inconveniencies</hi> complained of, as the Charge is <hi>general,</hi> this <hi>general</hi> Anſwer only can be given, That the <hi>Barbers</hi> have always, with the greateſt Deference, <hi>ſubmitted</hi> to the <hi>Surgeons</hi> in all Matters <hi>peculiar</hi> to them, and chearfully contributed, out of their <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Stock, towards every Expence which <hi>they</hi> have declared neceſſary for the Honour or Advancement of <hi>their</hi> Profeſſion. And ſince <hi>none</hi> of theſe Inconveniencies have been of Conſequence enough to deſerve being <hi>particularly</hi> pointed out, we may venture to pronounce them <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable,</hi> and unworthy the Attention and Redreſs of <hi>Parliament;</hi> and the rather, as <hi>all</hi> of them put together, have not prevented the <hi>Surgeons</hi> of <hi>London</hi> from carrying the Improvement of their Art, both in Speculation and Practice, to a greater Height than has been done in any other Place or Nation.</p>
            <p>That the frequent Meetings of ingenious Men, and their free Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications on the Subject of their Profeſſion, may tend <hi>to the Benefit of Mankind in general, and to the Honour of their Country in particular,</hi> is not denied: But ſurely the Conſtitution of the <hi>united</hi> Company is no obſtacle to theſe laudable Purpoſes. The <hi>Barbers</hi> have for many Years, at their Monthly Courts, ſubmitted to <hi>withdraw</hi> at a ſtated Hour, and <hi>reſigned</hi> the Parlour to the Surgeons: And if this <hi>Condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion</hi> is not ſuppoſed to afford them <hi>ſufficient</hi> Time for Converſation on theſe <hi>particular</hi> Days, nothing <hi>hinders</hi> them from holding <hi>ſeperate</hi> Aſſemblies at the Hall almoſt <hi>every</hi> other Day in the Year.</p>
            <p>As to what is ſaid to have been done at <hi>Paris, Edinburgh,</hi> and <hi>Glaſcow,</hi> no <hi>particular</hi> anſwer can be given, unleſs it appeared by what <hi>Means,</hi> for what <hi>Reaſons,</hi> and upon what <hi>Terms</hi> the <hi>Separations</hi> in thoſe Places were brought about. In <hi>London</hi> there are but two Inſtances of Separations of Companies, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Feltmakers</hi> from the <hi>Haberdaſhers</hi> in 1604, and that of the <hi>Apothecaries</hi> from the <hi>Grocers</hi> in 1617; but both theſe were effected by <hi>mutual</hi> Conſent, without the Intervention of <hi>Parliament;</hi> and it may be proper to obſerve, that the Feltmakers miſcarried in a former Application for an excluſive Charter in 1576 for <hi>want</hi> of the Haberdaſhers Conſent.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, therefore, the <hi>Barbers</hi> humbly hope the forgoing Reaſons will be deemed <hi>inſufficient</hi> to induce the <hi>Legiſlature</hi> to deſtroy an <hi>Union</hi> they <hi>themſelves</hi> thought proper to <hi>form,</hi> an Union which two hundred Years Exiſtence has rendred <hi>venerable,</hi> and which, by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0135203300:3"/>the <hi>Improvements</hi> above-mentioned, appears to have anſwered all the <hi>Purpoſes</hi> for which it was eſtabliſhed.</p>
            <p>But if for <hi>other</hi> Reaſons (which the <hi>Surgeons</hi> ſay <hi>may</hi> be given) the Parliament ſhall be inclined to favour them in <hi>this part</hi> of their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt; the <hi>Barbers,</hi> from the ſcrupulous Regard and Tenderneſs which that <hi>Auguſt Aſſembly</hi> has always ſhewn for <hi>private Property,</hi> cannot but hope they ſhall be <hi>continued</hi> in the Enjoyment of <hi>all</hi> their preſent Poſſeſſions, without any <hi>Diviſion</hi> whatſoever, and that, for the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Reaſons:</p>
