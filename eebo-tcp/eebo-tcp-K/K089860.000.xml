            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A VINDICATION OF THE AGE OF REASON, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>MANY and virulent are the Replies which have appeared to Mr. Paine's <hi>Age of Reaſon.</hi> It was not, indeed, to be expected that a work of this deſcription, which ſtruck immediately at the very root of prieſt-craft, ſhould remain long unanſwered. No ſooner was the challenge given, than a "whole hoſt of witneſſes" ſtarted up in defence of that ſyſtem, from whence (as Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius in a ſimilar caſe obſerved to his colleagues at Epheſus) they derive their wealth. Men who had long been in the habit of fattening in luxurious eaſe upon the ſpoils and contributions of credulity, bigotry, and ſuperſtition, were juſtly apprehenſive, leſt the inveſtigation of truth ſhould at length open the eyes of the community at large, and diſcover in all its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs the fallacy of that ſyſtem, by virtue of
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:1025900400:4"/>which they domineered over the ſouls and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of mankind, and which "brought no ſmall gain unto the craftsmen."</p>
            <p>Hence the Age of Reaſon no ſooner made its appearance, than the <hi>tooſin</hi> of alarm was ſounded throughout the whole Hierarchy. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion was now declared to be threatened with as great, and even greater dangers than thoſe which were ſuppoſed at a former period to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace the ſtate, in conſequence of the publication of the <hi>Rights of Man.</hi> Every diſgraceful epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thet of abuſe was conferred with liberal hand upon the author: the titles of Deiſt, Atheiſt, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidel, the Apoſtle of Beelzebub, the Agent of Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifer, with an infinite variety of the like op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious terms, now ſucceeded to the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of Jacobin, Leveller, Anarchiſt, Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioniſt, Rebel, &amp;c. which had formerly been given to Mr. Paine on the ſcore of his politics. Not only the clergy of the eſtabliſhed church, but the leading men of every religious ſect, had equal intereſt at ſtake, and were equally concerned in providing an antidote againſt the baneful influence of this deleterious poiſon: for the moment the way to God was laid open to every man alike; the moment neither <hi>maſters of the ceremonies,</hi> nor <hi>court etiquette</hi>—neither
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:1025900400:5"/>prieſts, nor religious forms—were neceſſary to introduce man to his Maker; that moment, they readily foreſaw, muſt inevitably put an end to their lucrative traffic, and totally anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate the vaſt revenues they received for acting as ambaſſadors of Chriſt, and inſtilling into the minds of the people ſpiritual knowledge and heavenly comfort. Replies, Anſwers, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futations of the Age of Reaſon, and its <hi>diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> doctrines, were therefore publiſhed in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; many of which, however, by their futi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and total want of argument, have produced the very reverſe of that effect, which their reſpective writers hoped to bring about; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as their incapacity to refute the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines they attacked, ſerved at once to ſhow their own imbecility, and the impregnable ſtrength of the fortreſs againſt which their puny efforts were directed.</p>
            <p>It cannot be expected, nor indeed will the limits I have preſcribed to the preſent work permit it, that I ſhould enter into a minute, elaborate, examination of every petty Reply to which the Age of Reaſon has given birth. Their name may truly be denominated <hi>Legion,</hi> "for they are many;" and a ſerious refutation of ſome of them is, perhaps, a moral impoſſibility. The
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:1025900400:6"/>wild, incomprehenſible ravings of a Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and other myſtical writers, are beneath the dignity of Criticiſm; and to cope with ſuch men with the weapons of ſound argument and plain reaſon, would be, to adopt the language of their favourite Apoſtle, "fighting like one that beateth the air."</p>
            <p>For theſe reaſons I ſhall confine my ſtrictures chiefly to what I conceive the two moſt reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable publications that have appeared in our language on this intereſting ſubject. Theſe are—1. AN EXAMINATION OF THE AGE OF REASON, by Gilbert Wakefield; and, 2. AN ANSWER TO MR. PAINE'S AGE OF REASON, by the celebrated Dr. Prieſtley.</p>
            <p>Both theſe gentlemen appear to agree nearly in their religious as well as in their political ſentiments; and yet the manner in which they conduct their attack upon the Age of Reaſon furniſhes a ſtriking contraſt. Mr. Wakefield but too often indulges himſelf in a ſpirit of acrimony, which, if not downright illiberality, borders, I am ſorry to ſay, immediately upon it. He acknowledges, in the very outſet of his career, that <q>the Work which he has under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken to examine (ſee page 2) is entitled to particular reſpect, not only from the genius
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:1025900400:7"/>of the Author, but alſo from the ſingular circumſtances of its compoſition:</q> but he ſoon loſes ſight of this reſpect, and deſcends to invective and abuſe
<note n="*" place="bottom">See pages 45, 51, 60, 61, 66. But I ſhall have occaſion to remark more largely upon this topic in the courſe of the work.</note>, which are quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of the high literary reputation Mr. Wakefield deſervedly enjoys. The field of literary diſpute, we apprehend, lies open to every man; but let him wield none but lawful weapons, even truth and ſound argument, and not turn the ſacred <hi>Academic Grove</hi> into the ſanguine <hi>Field of Mars!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another objection I have to the general cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Mr. Wakefield's Work, is the ſtrong vein of <hi>egotiſm</hi> which pervades many parts of it. Mr. Wakefield, contemplating himſelf as <q>a delicate bird, delighting in ſtrawberries and the choiceſt fruits,</q> (ſee page 66) may bridle his neck, and ſurvey with fond ſelf-complacency his gay plumage—may hold in ſovereign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt Thomas Paine, and every other author, who, by differing from him in opinion, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts himſelf to be <q>a crow, who prefers car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion and putreſcence, and finds a feaſt in a
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:1025900400:8"/>rotten carcaſe;</q> but ſurely he might have modeſtly left his readers an opportunity of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this flattering compariſon in his favour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Ad populum phaleras"</hi>—to imitate Mr. Wakefield's conſtant practice of introducing quotations from Latin and Greek authors on the moſt trifling occaſions
<note n="*" place="bottom">In juſtification of this remark, the reader is referred to the following pages of Mr. Wakefield's work, where he will find quotations heaped upon quotations, with all the pompo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and affectation of a ſchool-boy. See pages 2, 10, 13, 21, 22, 34, 42, 50, 51, 54, 59, 64, 66. In many of theſe paſſages Greek and Latin authorities are brought forward in ſupport of the moſt palpable, the moſt plain, trite, and (if I may be allowed the expreſſion) the moſt every-day obſervations imaginable. I am far from objecting to claſſical quotations, introduced with judgment and with a ſparing hand; but, when dealt out with extravagant profuſion, when they ſtare you in the face at every turn, where neither the ſubject nor the point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the alluſion, juſtify their inſertion, they certainly betray a pedantic diſpoſition, unworthy any gentleman of eſtabliſhed character in the republic of letters. And this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark I make the rather, as the general outcry raiſed againſt Mr. Paine, on the ſcore of his being unverſed in what are generally ſtyled the learned languages, ſeems to have led ſeveral of his opponents into this error; and I am convinced, that many an author has thereby acquired credit with unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed minds, for a greater portion of learning than he was juſtly entitled to.</note>; a practice which,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:1025900400:9"/>though it may ſerve to impreſs the common claſs of readers with a ſtupendous idea of the Author's learning, has, in the eyes of men of ſenſe, an air of pedantry, that more than any thing elſe has contributed to bring the name of ſcholar into diſrepute.</p>
            <p>Quite the reverſe is Dr. Prieſtley's mode of proceeding in this literary warfare. He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducts himſelf with becoming dignity; argues in a fair, candid, and manly manner; never deſcends to perſonalities, but confines himſelf ſtrictly to the ſubject of diſpute, which he treats with great ingenuity, and at the ſame time with a plainneſs, which forms, as I before obſerved, a ſtriking contraſt to the oſtentatious diſplay of learning exhibited by Mr. Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field.</p>
            <p>One obſervation more I muſt beg leave to premiſe before I enter upon my intended <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the Age of Reaſon</hi> in the aggregate; to wit, that I do not ſet out (and I hope I ſhall not fall into this error in the courſe of my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions) with a predetermination to defend my author at all events, whether right or wrong; or to vindicate indiſcriminately every poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion laid down by Mr. Paine, becauſe I have once been induced to take up the cudgels in
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:1025900400:10"/>his defence; or as though I deemed every aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion advanced by Mr. Paine infallible. On the contrary, I propoſe to treat the ſubject with due candour; and, much as I admire the general purport of the work under conſideration, ſhall readily ſubſcribe to the juſtice and validity of any cenſure beſtowed upon particular paſſages, (and ſuch paſſages I am well aware there are,) where hardy aſſertion and ſpecious ſophiſtry ſupply the place of ſound argument and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. It is not the perſonal cauſe of Mr. Paine, but the cauſe of what I conceive to be the Truth, that I wiſh to eſpouſe: from the free diſcuſſion and inveſtigation of which no conſideration upon earth ought to deter a rational being. To inveſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigate, and boldly avow, the Truth, as far as the meaſure of reaſon wherewith we are endowed by the all-wiſe Author of Nature enables us to aſcertain it, is a duty which man owes both to himſelf, and to ſociety at large; and whoever ſhrinks back from the taſk, whoever neglects to diſcharge this part of his moral obligations, is either a <hi>traitor</hi> or a <hi>coward.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I proceed now to an examination of the work I have undertaken to defend.</p>
            <p>After briefly ſtating the reaſon which induced him to anticipate the time he had originally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1025900400:11"/>to himſelf for the publication of his reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious ſentiments, Mr. Paine proceeds to a ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary recapitulation, or confeſſion of his creed. This may be ſaid to conſiſt of two parts—the one poſitive; the other negative. To the former part the ſtauncheſt advocate of Chriſtianity, I apprehend, cannot have the ſmalleſt objection to make: it accords with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> will not, I flatter myſelf, take upon him to deny; and concludes with a definition of religious du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which may be conſidered as a conciſe, but energetic comment upon the golden rule, <q>Do unto others as ye would that others ſhould do unto you.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With the ſecond or negative part, the caſe is widely different. Here Mr. Paine attacks, with one bold deciſive blow, the whole order of Prieſthood, of every religious ſyſtem, from the times of Moſes to the preſent day; and not only the Prieſthood, but the followers and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of every religion and ſect, that does, or
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1025900400:12"/>ever did exiſt in the whole world. His words are theſe:</p>
            <p>
               <q>I do not believe in the creed profeſſed by the Jewiſh church, by the Roman church, by the Greek church, by the Turkiſh church, by the Proteſtant church, nor by any other church that I know of—My own mind is my own church.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>All national inſtitutions of churches, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Jewiſh, Chriſtian, or Turkiſh, appear to me no other than human inventions, ſet up to terrify and enſlave mankind, and monopolize power and profit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This may be conſidered as a general chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge to the zealous ſticklers of every church eſtabliſhment. From ſuch, therefore, we muſt not look for a ready aſſent to this part of our Author's creed. The doctrines of faith, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the religion may be in which we are edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, whether the Jewiſh, Chriſtian, Turkiſh, or Pagan ſyſtems, forming, generally ſpeaking, the firſt leſſon inſtilled into the infant mind, at a time when the reaſoning faculties may be almoſt ſaid to lie dormant, naturally make a deep im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion; and, being familiariſed to us by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant repetition, we adopt them without exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; we receive them upon truſt; ſubſcribe to them as a matter of courſe; and if, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:1025900400:13"/>as we advance in years, and our reaſon attains to its proper growth, we are led to weigh, to prove, and examine, the religion we profeſs, which, by the bye, is not done, upon a very moderate calculation, by one in ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand, we have unfortunately, excluſive of the taſk, the arduous taſk, of ſeparating Truth from Error, a powerful hoſt of prejudices and aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to combat with. For my own part, I am free to confeſs, that this blind acquieſcence in the opinions of others, this eaſy indifference with which mankind in general ſit down con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented with the religion of their anceſtors, whether Jews, Chriſtians, Turks, or Pagans, furniſhes, in my mind, no mean argument againſt the truth of any of them; or, in other words, againſt their divine origin. A religion, profeſſing to be derived immediately from the Almighty, and written by divine inſpiration, ought to flaſh conviction in the face of every one who hears or reads it. But this we do not find to be the caſe with any known religion in the world. Add to this, that I do not ſee, that peace, morals, ſocial order, and the rights of humanity, are better reſpected and maintained under governments profeſſing the Chriſtian faith, than where the blindeſt Idolatry prevails.

But this is a topic which I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to diſcuſs more fully when I come to treat of the intimate connexion between religion and morals; on which occaſion I ſhall not omit to ſay a few words on the ſtale, but juſt maxim, as Mr. Wakefield very properly terms it, and which he accuſes Mr. Paine of having moſt egregiouſly violated—<q>

            <p>Meanwhile, I cannot but remark upon the ready acquieſcence with which Mr. Wakefield ſubſcribes to every part of our Author's creed, that makes in favour, and I might emphatically add, <hi>as far</hi> too as it makes in favour, of his own political creed.</p>
            <p>"All national inſtitutions of churches," writes Mr. Paine,—<q>whether Jewiſh, Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,

            </p>
            <p>How eagerly does Mr. Wakefield, who probably, in conſequence of his unfortunate ſchiſm from the doctrines of the eſtabliſhed Church of England, ſees no proſpect of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the <hi>mitre,</hi> ſubſcribe his <hi>Yea</hi> and <hi>Amen,</hi> to this juſt remark <q>conciſely and pregnantly expreſſed!</q> He immediately becomes more violent in his reprobation than our Author himſelf; and launches out into a general in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective againſt <hi>national churches,</hi> without the ſmalleſt diſcrimination or exception.</p>

            </p>
            <p>The happy ſimile of <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble</hi> in this beautiful conglomeration of metaphors we find is taken from the firſt Epiſtle of Paul to the Corinthians, where the apoſtle ſpeaks of a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be raiſed; and from his boaſt of having himſelf wrought, as a wiſe <hi>maſter-builder,</hi> upon the foundation, it ſhould ſeem that the erection of this building was a work of uſe and neceſſity. Now, if the words of the apoſtle have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference at all to <hi>national eſtabliſhments,</hi> we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, that the <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble</hi> muſt apply to corrupt eſtabliſhments that will not ſtand the teſt; ſuch, for inſtance, as the Church of Rome, in the eyes of the Proteſtant clergy, and which therefore are threatened with deſtruction by <hi>fire;</hi> whilſt the <hi>gold,</hi> the <hi>ſilver,</hi> and the <hi>precious ſtones,</hi> (as for the <hi>wood,</hi> I do not inſiſt upon that, but will give it to Mr. Wakefield, to ſhare the fate of his <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble</hi>) by a parallel chain of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:1025900400:17"/>may be ſuppoſed to deſignate and point out a pure, uncorrupted eſtabliſhment, cleared from the errors and ſuperſtitions of the Church of Rome, ſuch as our divines pronounce the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent national Church of England to be. And as by the <hi>fire,</hi> which, the apoſtle tells us, is doomed to try every man's work, the awful phaenomena and awards of the day of judgment are generally underſtood to be meant, in which day the <q>ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall melt with fervent heat, the earth alſo, and the works that are therein, (of courſe the <hi>hay</hi> and the <hi>ſtubble</hi>) ſhall be burnt up
<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Pet. iii. v. 10.</note>,</q> we are very ſorry to think that Mr. Wakefield has no nearer proſpect of getting rid of this ſelf-ſame worthleſs <hi>hay</hi> and <hi>ſtubble,</hi> and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituting his <hi>gold</hi> and <hi>ſilver</hi> and <hi>precious ſtones</hi> in their ſtead, than at the very moment when the end of all things ſhall take place.</p>
            <p>Were I as ready to lay hold of every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of finding fault with Mr. Wakefield's expreſſions, as this gentleman appears to be in the caſe of Mr. Paine, I might poſſibly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover a <hi>flaw</hi> in his <hi>Diamond of Chriſtianity,</hi> which, to quote his own words, <q>the impure incruſtation of <hi>National Churches</hi> has, by gradual concretion, enveloped to that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:1025900400:18"/>that the genuine luſtre cannot (he fears) be recovered, but by ſuch violent effort of reſtitution, as the ſeparation of ſubſtances, ſo long and cloſely connected, muſt inevitably require.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now, if we compare the religion founded by Chriſt to a Diamond (and I take it for granted that every ſincere believer and profeſſor of it muſt regard it in this light as a jewel of the firſt water, as <q>the pearl of great price, more precious than the golden wedge of Ophir</q>) it ſeems no more than fair to conclude, that this Diamond was not put into our hands by the Almighty in its rough incruſted ſtate, for man to cut and hack at pleaſure (ſuch an idea would indeed fall little ſhort of blaſphemy), but rather in a ſtate of the utmoſt purity, po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed to the higheſt degree of perfection, and, like the God from whom it profeſſes to origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, without ſpot or blemiſh. A diamond in this ſtate, once ſeparated from its incruſtation, and properly poliſhed, might, we apprehend, venture to defy all the impurities in nature, and could, perhaps, never be incruſted over again, either by ſudden or gradual concretion; inaſmuch as the hardneſs of its ſubſtance, added to the finiſhed poliſh of its ſuperficies, would
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:1025900400:19"/>reſiſt the impreſſion of every foreign body that had a tendency to ſully and debaſe it. And therefore, as Mr. Wakefield's <hi>Diamond of Chriſtianity</hi> has, according to his own confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, loſt its purity and poliſh by the impure incruſtation of <hi>National Churches,</hi> we cannot claſs it among the genuine productions of Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conda's mine, but rather conceive it to be a kind of <hi>factitious</hi> or <hi>mock diamond;</hi> a kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition-work, like the <hi>faux brillants,</hi> or <hi>Temple Diamonds,</hi> which crafty and intereſted jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ellers ſo well know how to palm upon their credulous cuſtomers for the genuine produce of Golconda or Peru.</p>
            <p>Again, let me put the queſtion to Mr. Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, how he can, conſiſtently with this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and furious invective againſt <hi>all national eſtabliſhments,</hi> ſpeak ſo highly of the <hi>Jewiſh Diſpenſation</hi>

            <p>But leſt the above remarks, which have only in view to point out the inconſiſtency of Mr. Wakefield's arguments, and the readineſs with which he attempts to throw the blame of all the corruptions, which, according to his own
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:1025900400:23"/>confeſſion, have crept into religion, upon the ſhoulders of the eſtabliſhed church, inſtead of tracing them back to their true ſource, the very principles of Chriſtianity itſelf, as we ſhall in the ſequel endeavour to ſhow; leſt, I ſay, the above remarks ſhould lead to miſconception, and render me ſuſpected of being the ſecret or avowed advocate of any one particular church-eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whatever; I take this opportunity of teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying my full and hearty execration of them all, in the concluding words of Mr. Paine's creed:</p>
            <p>
               <q>All national inſtitutions of churches appear to me no other than human inventions, ſet up to terrify and enſlave mankind, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nopolize power and profit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In proof of which aſſertion, if a ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent axiom like this, plain as the ſun in its me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian ſplendour, can require any proof, I need only refer my reader to the uniform practice of prieſts through all ages and in all countries; from the ſons of Eli, who could not keep their <hi>three-pronged fleſh-books out of the ſeething-pot, while the meat was boiling,</hi> to the good ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds of the preſent day, who, if the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate ſheep are already ſo cloſely ſhorn, that they cannot yield wool ſufficient to diſcharge the fees

               </q>) of excommunicating them at once from the pale of the church, and the benefits of ſalvation! I need only refer them to the page of hiſtory for the vaſt eſtates taken from the church under our pious Defender of the Faith, Henry VIII. of England; to the more recent events of the French Revolution, and the immenſe treaſures which the church has been made to refund in a neighbouring nation; I need only refer them, laſtly, to the eagerneſs with which people of all deſcriptions ſtrive to get into ſacred orders, an eagerneſs which in ſome countries, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in Spain, is carried to ſuch an incredible exceſs, that the number of paſtors and ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herds ſeems to be in a fair way of riſing to par with the ſheep of the flock over whom they are, by divine grace, and the expreſs calling of God, appointed to preſide.</p>
            <p>Leaving, however, the clergy for the preſent at leaſt, in the full exerciſe and enjoyment of their <hi>ſacerdotal privileges,</hi> that we may not "muzzle the mouth of the ox that treadeth out

            </p>
            <p>It is at this paſſage, that Mr. Wakefield may be ſaid to commence his attack upon our author.
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:1025900400:26"/>Hitherto we have beheld him ſubſcribing with the readieſt acquieſcence to every poſition advanced by Mr. Paine: but he now takes up the cudgels with a vengeance, and boldly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares Mr. Paine's ſtatement to be <q>not only vague and frivolous, but nonſenſical and erroneous in the extreme.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In ſupport of this aſſertion, Mr. Wakefield preſents us with a ſpecies of argument, which I have not the ſmalleſt heſitation to pronounce infinitely more <q>vague, and frivolous, and erroneous,</q> than one half of the ſtatements in Mr. Paine's book, which his antagoniſt, without any ſhow of reaſon, declares to be <q>not only the <hi>eſſence</hi> but the very <hi>quinteſſence</hi> of all weakneſs and abſurdity.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>The ſyſtem of Jeſus Chriſt, (Mr. Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field writes, page 14) proceeds upon the very ſuppoſition, here inſtituted as in direct contradiction to it, that the way to God <hi>is</hi> open to every man alike; which <hi>might</hi> be proved, as every body knows, by many paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of moſt explicit purport in the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> ſcriptures.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Nothing can well be more vague and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive than this mode of reaſoning. Mr. Paine ſays, and ſays truly, (for all hiſtorical evidence
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:1025900400:27"/>is decidedly on his ſide) that every national religion has eſtabliſhed itſelf by pretending ſome ſpecial miſſion from God, communicated to certain individuals; and this palpable aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Mr. Paine ſupports by inſtancing the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the founders of the Jewiſh, Chriſtian and Turkiſh religions, who certainly <hi>did,</hi> for we have their own words for it, (if any faith may be placed in the written biographies of theſe heavenly meſſengers) lay claim to <hi>divine delegation.</hi> Surely Mr. Wakefield cannot mean to call facts of ſuch hiſtorical notoriety in queſtion, when he pronounces our author's ſtatement to be "frivolous, noſenſical, and erroneous?" Hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, therefore, if it have any weight at all, muſt apply to the inference our author draws from this ſtatement, that the very act of granting a divine miſſion to any favoured individual, or admitting ſuch a miſſion to be granted, is in itſelf a plain, though tacit acknowledgment, that the way to God is <hi>not</hi> open to every man alike," but that we ſtand in need of <hi>mediators, plenipotentiaries, advocates,</hi> and <hi>ambaſſadors,</hi> to tranſact our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and arrange preliminaries for us; and that God is really a conſuming fire, (Deut. iv. 24.

            <p>To the divine miſſion of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> Mr. Wakefield himſelf bears teſtimony in the moſt unequivocal terms:</p>
            <p>
               <q>Our inference from theſe indubitable poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions (ſee page 17) is clearly <hi>ſome</hi> degree of ſupernatural communication, which we ſtyle <hi>Revelation,</hi> to the founders of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Chriſtianity, Moſes</hi> and <hi>Jeſus.</hi>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:1025900400:30"/>boldly charges Mr. Paine with error and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdity, and aſſerts that the <hi>Chriſtian ſyſtem</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppoſes that <q>the way to God <hi>is</hi> open to every man alike;</q> whereas the very reverſe may eaſily be proved <q>by many paſſages of moſt explicit purport in the Chriſtian ſcriptures,</q> and by the expreſs declarations of Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. If the way to God <hi>be</hi> actually, and of a truth, open to every man alike, (which it no doubt is, though prieſts would fain perſuade us to the contrary) why does Chriſt (who himſelf, according to Mr. Wakefield's doctrine was but a mere <hi>man</hi>) arrogate to himſelf the excluſive right and power of granting <hi>paſſports</hi> to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to <hi>walk</hi> in this way? <q>No man cometh unto the Father but by <hi>me.</hi>
               </q> (John xiv. 6.) Why does he, in the ſame chapter and verſe, declare <hi>himſelf</hi> to be <hi>this way?</hi> Why does he roundly aſſert, that man can have <hi>no</hi> knowledge of the <hi>Deity,</hi> but through <hi>his</hi> revelation? <q>No man knoweth the <hi>Father</hi> ſave the <hi>Son,</hi> and he to whomſoever the <hi>Son</hi> will <hi>reveal</hi> him.</q> (Matt. xi. 27.) Wherefore are we directed
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:1025900400:31"/>by his apoſtles, to look up to Chriſt as the <hi>me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator</hi> of the <hi>new covenant,</hi> (Heb. xii. 24.) through whoſe blood a <hi>new</hi> and <hi>living way</hi> has been opened unto us into the holieſt of all? (Heb. x. 19, 20.) <q>Through whom we have <hi>acceſs</hi> unto the Father.</q> (Eph. ii. 18, and iii. 12. Rom. v. 2.) who is our <hi>"advocate"</hi> with God, (1 John, ii. 1.) and <q>who ever liveth to make <hi>interceſſion</hi> for us?</q> (Heb. vii. 25.) To what purpoſe can all theſe admonitions, all theſe exhortations tend, if the ſyſtem of Jeſus Chriſt proceeds (as Mr. Wakefield aſſures us it poſitively does proceed) upon the ſuppoſition that <q>the way to God <hi>is</hi> open to every man alike?</q> Why are we then directed to look up to Chriſt, or to any other man, as our only hope of eternal life and happineſs, with the denouncement of a terrible curſe, an everlaſting <hi>Anathema Maranatha</hi> againſt us if we do not believe in this author and finiſher of our faith, as Chriſt is emphatically ſtyled? (Heb. xii. 2.) Can this, let me put the queſtion to every can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did and impartial enquirer, can this be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled with Mr. Wakefield's hardy aſſertion, that the way to God, by the Chriſtian ſyſtem, <hi>is</hi> thrown open to every man alike? Certainly it cannot; and therefore the charge of error, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtency,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:1025900400:32"/>and abſurdity recoils, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtance, from Mr. Paine upon his anta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goniſt.</p>
            <p>Mr. Wakefield next attacks our author's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition of the word <hi>Revelation,</hi> in its <hi>ſcriptural</hi> or <hi>religious ſenſe;</hi> but his attack is ſo impotent, and, at the ſame time, ſo ill-conducted, that I cannot poſſibly characterize it more aptly, than by aſking, in Mr. Wakefield's own words, <q>Can any thing in reality be more feeble and inefficient, than this objection?</q> It would amply juſtify the inſertion of the Latin quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which Mr. Wakefield has ſo ſucceſsfully introduced on this occaſion, were I ambitious of enriching my page with claſſical alluſions. Mr. Paine obſerves:</p>
            <p>
               <q>As it is neceſſary to affix right ideas to words, I will, before I proceed further into the ſubject, offer ſome obſervations on the word <hi>Revelation.</hi> Revelation, when applied to religion,</q> (and it is in <hi>this</hi> ſenſe ſolely that Mr. Paine conſiders it; and therefore Mr. Wakefield's attempt at ſarcaſm, in his caſe of the <hi>Village Dame</hi> and her <hi>horn-book</hi> (ſee page 51), is totally irrevalent, and at beſt but a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited quibble) "means ſomething commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated <hi>immediately</hi> from God to man."</p>

But, admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for the ſake of a caſe, that ſomething has been revealed to a certain perſon, and not revealed to any other perſon, it is reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to that perſon only. When he tells it to a ſecond perſon, a ſecond to a third, a third to a fourth, and ſo on, it ceaſes to be revelation to all thoſe perſons. It is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation to the firſt perſon only, and <hi>hearſay</hi> to every other, and conſequently they are not obliged to believe it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>"This ſtatement alſo," exclaims Mr. Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, with all the ſelf-ſufficiency of a Peda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogue,—<q>is inaccurate, fallacious, and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive.</q> That I deny; and till Mr. Wakefield can produce me ſome more ſatisfactory proof than mere aſſertion, I ſhall not abide by his <hi>ipſe dixit.</hi> Indeed, in all what Mr. Wakefield has advanced upon <hi>this</hi> ſubject, I cannot trace ſo much as the ſhadow of an argument. He jumbles together a few crude, ſuperficial ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations on the <hi>miſſion of Moſes,</hi> and his <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentials,</hi> which, however, unhappily make di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly againſt his own cauſe.

As to thoſe miſchievous miracles which Moſes was empowered to perform, and which the magicians of Pharaoh's court in vain eſſayed to imitate; ſuch, for inſtance, as the <hi>plague of lice;</hi> the <hi>murrain of beaſts;</hi> the ſore and grievous plague of <hi>blains and bliſters;</hi> the plague of <hi>hail;</hi> of <hi>locuſts;</hi> of <hi>palpable darkneſs;</hi> but more particularly the <hi>deſtruction of all the firſt-born in Egypt, both of man and beaſt;</hi> I reſerve my remarks upon this plaguy ſubject to a future opportunity; only obſerving in this place, that it appears very extraordinary, that Moſes ſhould be commiſſioned to preface his firſt introduction to Pharaoh with a palpable falſehood. <q>The Lord God of the Hebrews hath met with us; and now let us go, we beſeech thee, <hi>three days' journey</hi> into the wilderneſs, that we may ſacrifice to the Lord, our God;</q> (Exod. iii. 18) when it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from the 8th verſe of the ſame chapter, <q>I am come down to deliver my people out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good land flowing with milk and honey; unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:1025900400:36"/>and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebuſites;</q> (which places were cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly more than <hi>"three day's journey"</hi> diſtant from the abode of the Iſraelites); when it is evident, I ſay, that it was never intended they ſhould ſtop in the wilderneſs; much leſs return back to the land of <hi>Goſhen.</hi> Hence it ſhould ſeem, that <hi>falſehood</hi> and <hi>prevarication</hi> are to be reckoned among the <hi>credentials</hi> of the miſſion of Moſes! But to proceed.</p>
            <p>"It is a contradiction in terms and ideas," (continues Mr. Paine) <q>to call any thing a <hi>revelation,</hi> that comes to us at <hi>ſecond hand,</hi> either verbally or in writing. Revelation is neceſſarily limited to the <hi>firſt</hi> communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After this, it is only an account of ſomething which that perſon ſays was a revelation made to <hi>him:</hi> and though <hi>he</hi> may find himſelf obliged to believe it, it cannot be incumbent on <hi>me</hi> to believe it in the ſame manner; for it was no revelation made to <hi>me;</hi> and I have only <hi>his word</hi> for it that it was made to <hi>him.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe, together with Mr. Paine's former remarks on the ſubject of <hi>Revelation,</hi> in the <hi>religious</hi> acceptation of the <hi>word,</hi> appear to me to contain ſuch a clear, juſt, and maſterly defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:1025900400:37"/>of the term, that, had I not poſitive evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to the contrary before my eyes, I ſhould hardly believe it poſſible for any man to diſſent from him. And yet we find, that this, as little as other paſſages of Mr. Paine's book, can eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape cenſure, and even miſrepreſentation.</p>
            <p>Dr. Prieſtly, after pronouncing his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be <q>
                  <hi>truly curious,</hi> and as he believes <hi>quite original,</hi>
               </q> (ſee page 44.) gives us a very unfair and partial ſtatement of the caſe.</p>
            <p>
               <q>On this principle, it is not incumbent on Mr. Paine to believe what any perſon may tell him, and he may give credit to nothing but what he ſees himſelf; in which caſe his faith will be reduced to a very ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs indeed. His pretence to a <hi>contradiction in terms</hi> is a mere quibble. We do not ſay, that the revelation made immediately to Moſes or to Chriſt is ſtrictly ſpeaking a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>us;</hi> but if we ſee ſufficient reaſon to believe that the revelation <hi>was</hi> made to <hi>them,</hi> are, properly ſpeaking, believers in revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and if the revelation, whatever it be, relate to the whole human race, as well as to the perſon to whom it was immediately made, all mankind, Mr. Paine himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:1025900400:38"/>will find themſelves under an equal <hi>obligation</hi> to reſpect it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this exemplification the Doctor allows himſelf a greater latitude of conſtruction than we conceive ourſelves bound to concede to him. Had Mr. Paine, in ſtating his own individual rejection of revelation, attached any degree of blame to thoſe of an oppoſite opinion, he would have been guilty of uncharitableneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, by uſurping that controul over the opinion of others, which he very properly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to ſubmit to himſelf. But this is far from being the caſe; Mr. Paine does not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray the remoteſt diſpoſition or deſire to aim at ſuch deſpotic ſway over the ſouls and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>I do not mean (writes our author, page 2) to condemn thoſe who believe otherwiſe. They have the ſame right to <hi>their</hi> belief, as I have to <hi>mine.</hi>
                  </q>
               </note>. He contents himſelf with aſſigning his reaſons for not believing certain recorded facts and tenets, without inſinuating the ſlighteſt degree of cenſure againſt thoſe who, viewing things in a different light, deem themſelves bound to place implicit faith and confidence therein. He very modeſtly ſays: <q>I did not <hi>ſee</hi> the angel, and therefore I have a <hi>right</hi> not to believe his appearance. The
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:1025900400:39"/>revelation was not made to <hi>me,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it cannot be <hi>incumbent</hi> upon <hi>me</hi> to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it.</q> And, ſpeaking of mankind in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, he does not ſay, <q>they <hi>act wrong</hi> in believing it,</q> but merely, <q>they are not <hi>obliged</hi> to believe it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>As the liberty of thought is not, and indeed, <hi>cannot be,</hi> obnoxious to that reſtraint which arbitrary power frequently impoſes upon our words and actions, every man, we apprehend, has a right to the moſt unlimited freedom of opinion in his own individual capacity. It is, indeed, his birth-right, and perhaps of all his juſt and numerous rights, the only one which the lawleſs hand of deſpotiſm cannot invade. On this principle, therefore, inſtead of deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Dr. Prieſtley's ſtatement of the caſe any argument againſt the juſtice of Mr. Paine's remarks, we are clearly of opinion, <q>that it is <hi>not</hi> incumbent on Mr. Paine, nor upon any other man, to believe what any perſon may tell him,</q> if he has, or conceives him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to have, good and grounded reaſon for withholding his faith. And, though by refuſing to credit any tranſaction which he does not ſee with his own eyes (here the Doctor, by the bye, carries his propoſition to a much
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:1025900400:40"/>greater length than Mr. Paine's
<note n="*" place="bottom">The very reverſe of this inſinuation is abundantly apparent in many paſſages of Mr. Paine's book. Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Jeſus Chriſt, he ſays: <q>That ſuch a perſon as Jeſus Chriſt exiſted, and that he was crucified, which was the mode of execution at that day, are hiſtorical relations ſtrictly within the limits of probability.</q> So neither does he call in queſtion the exiſtence of Moſes or of Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, nor the hiſtorical tranſactions of the kings of Judah and Iſrael; all he combats is the abſurdity of beſtowing the title of <hi>God's word</hi> upon a miſcellaneous collection of <hi>Chronicles, Regiſters, Genealogies, Anecdotes, Ethics, Poetry, Rhapſody, Epiſtles, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> ſtatements will warrant; as our author only refuſes his faith to <hi>ſupernatural</hi> and <hi>miraculous</hi> events, which militate directly againſt the ordinary and eſtabliſhed courſe of nature) though by refuſing to credit any tranſaction which he does not ſee with his own eyes, a man no doubt will reduce his faith and knowledge to a very ſmall compaſs indeed; ſtill we cannot conceive ſuch a refuſal, however un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, to be culpable, immoral, and cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal to that degree as to merit the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>eternal perdition,</hi> which however, by the Chriſtian ſyſtem, is flatly denounced

            <p>Mr. Paine is further accuſed of <hi>quibbling,</hi> becauſe he ſtyles it a <hi>contradiction in terms</hi> to call any thing a <hi>revelation</hi> that comes to us at <hi>ſecond-hand;</hi> but I apprehend that the charge of quibbling will be found in the preſent inſtance to fall with greater weight and juſtice upon the party who brings this crimination againſt him. "We do not (argues Dr. Prieſtley) <q>ſay, that the revelation made immediately to Moſes or to Chriſt is, ſtrictly ſpeaking, a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to <hi>us;</hi>

            <p>Mr. Wakefield has been at ſome pains, with the ſuperaddition of a formidable <hi>trio</hi> of Latin quotations, to ſhow us the juſtice of the Moſaic doctrine of <hi>viſiting the ſins of the fathers upon the children</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Excluſive of the glaring impiety of this doctrine, which Mr. Paine juſtly obſerves <q>is contrary to every principle of moral juſtice,</q> it ſtands in direct, irrecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cileable contradiction to the moſt explicit declarations in ſeveral other parts of the Bible Thus it is expreſsly commanded in Deut. xxiv. 16. <q>The father ſhall not be put to death for the children; neither ſhall the children be put to death for the father: every man ſhall be put to death for his own ſin.</q> So likewiſe Amaziah's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct is highly applauded, (2 Kings, xiv. 5, 6. 2 Chron. xxv. 4.) becauſe, in avenging the death of his father, <q>he flew not the children of the murderers, according to that which is written in the book of the law of Moſes, &amp;c.</q> Here likewiſe may be referred the following paſſage in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiah, xxxi. 29. <q>In thoſe days they ſhall ſay no more— The fathers have eaten a four grape, and the children's teeth are ſet on edge.</q> And Ezekiel, xviii. 2, 3, 4. <q>What ſay ye, that ye uſe this proverb concerning the land of Iſrael, ſaying, The fathers have eaten four grapes, and the children's teeth are ſet on edge?

               <note n="*" place="bottom">The writer of a certain virulent attack upon our author, entitled, <hi>Chriſtianity the only true Theology,</hi> who very properly ſtyles himſelf a <hi>Churchman,</hi> for he is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently the <hi>tool of party,</hi> accuſes Mr. Paine of the moſt <hi>diſſolute</hi> and <hi>impudent buffoonery;</hi> and with that <hi>charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs</hi> which characterizes moſt of Mr. Paine's antago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts, compares him to <hi>"the ſow at its vomit."</hi> (page 58) Now I appeal to every candid examiner, whether Mr. Paine has not treated the ſubject of the <hi>immaculate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt (a ſubject which, had he really me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited the character ſo <hi>charitably</hi> beſtowed upon him, might have afforded ample ſcope for the diſplay of his talents) with a degree of delicacy and forbearance which gives the <hi>lie direct</hi> to ſuch impudent, unſupported aſperſions?</note>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:1025900400:46"/>and <hi>immaculate conception</hi> of Chriſt, as they have an obvious tendency to promote the cauſe of <hi>Unitarianiſm,</hi> meet with little or no animadverſion from our two Unitarian divines. Mr. Wakefield expreſsly acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, that <q>the immaculate conception of Jeſus Chriſt by the <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes no <hi>eſſential</hi> article of <hi>his</hi> creed, and therefore he leaves the vindication of it to the orthodox ſons of the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q> Doctor Prieſtley follows him nearly on the ſame ground; and as it is their common intereſt to reaſon the <hi>divinity of Chriſt</hi> fairly out of the Bible, they both of them have recourſe to ſuppoſed <hi>errata,</hi> and <hi>ſpurious interpolations</hi> to invalidate the plain and poſitive teſtimonies which we find
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:1025900400:47"/>on record in the ſcriptures in favour of the <hi>Godhead</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. The two firſt chapters of the Goſpel of St. Matthew are peremptorily rejected, becauſe there is no poſſibility of <hi>ſoftening down</hi> their evidence, which makes immediately againſt the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarian ſyſtem: The ſame fate, for the ſame reaſon, is awarded againſt the two firſt chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Goſpel of St. Luke, and thus they hope at once to get over a difficulty which muſt otherwiſe prove an inſurmountable ſtumbling-block and rock of offence in their way. But their hopes are far too ſanguine; and they have no alternative, but either to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally to reject <hi>all</hi> faith in the revelation, or concede this point. The miraculous birth of Chriſt does not depend upon the ſingle teſtimony of St. Matthew, or St. Luke, as its only vouchers; it ſtands plainly predicted (I am arguing on the principle of a belief in revelation) in the prophecies of Iſaiah, where it is expreſsly ſaid, and men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned emphatically as a <hi>ſign</hi> or <hi>miracle,</hi> a <hi>ſign</hi> which the Lord himſelf ſhould give after it had been ſubmitted to Ahab, to aſk a <hi>ſign</hi> of the Lord God, either in the depth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath, or in the height above: <q>Behold,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:1025900400:48"/>a <hi>Virgin</hi> ſhall <hi>conceive,</hi> and <hi>bear</hi> a Son, and ſhall call his name <hi>Immanuel.</hi>
               </q> (Iſaih, viii. 14.) So likewiſe in the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to the Hebrews, we find <hi>Chriſt</hi> declared to be a <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> after the <hi>Order of Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedec;</hi> as being <q>without father, without mother,</q> (in as far as he was not engen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered after the ordinary courſe of nature) <q>without deſcent, having neither beginning of days, nor end of life.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It would be endleſs to animadvert upon all the abſurdities and inconſiſtencies to which a <hi>partial</hi> belief in the word of God, as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſtyled, muſt neceſſarily and invari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably lead. The man who ſubſcribes to the adulteration or interpolation of a <hi>part,</hi> by that very conceſſion invalidates my faith in the <hi>whole.</hi> The ſame right by which he preſumes to reject any obnoxious paſſages that militate againſt the ſyſtem which <hi>he</hi> has been led to adopt, authorizes <hi>me</hi> to do the ſame by any part which does not accord with <hi>my</hi> ideas; and this right of rejection and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination being once admitted and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it becomes a very eaſy taſk, <q>ſuch and ſo various are the taſtes and opinions of men,</q> to argue and fritter away the <hi>whole.</hi>
               <pb n="51" facs="tcp:1025900400:49"/>And although "one defect of demonſtration" (as Mr. Wakefield obſerves) <q>has not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired the general truth of the Newtonian philoſophy,</q> the application of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to <hi>Religion</hi> and the <hi>word of God</hi> will not hold good. Newton, and every other philoſopher, however enlightened and intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, as men, are liable to error; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore claim, as ſuch, our indulgence: but the writings which we emphatically honour with the name of <hi>God's Word;</hi> and which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe in, as given by divine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>All</hi> Scripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is <q>profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs; that the Man of God may be <hi>perfect.</hi>

            <p>Viewing things in this light, it will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be aſked, why I ſhould make choice of two Unitarian publications for the ſubject of my diſquiſitions, in preference to ſo many Treatiſes written on the ſame topic, by the zealous and avowed partizans of the Eſtabliſhed Church? To this demand I make anſwer, that as the Unitarian Creed appears to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of much greater latitude of conſtruction, together with an almoſt unlimited freedom of rejection, with reſpect to whatever mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates againſt its own ſyſtem in the Scriptures, I conceived that any conviction brought home againſt the profeſſors and advocates of <hi>this faith,</hi> muſt infallibly carry with it double
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:1025900400:51"/>weight and authority, and ultimately conduce more to the <hi>Cauſe of Truth,</hi> and the <hi>Triumph of Reaſon,</hi> than my labours would have done, had I attacked the followers and diſciples of the <hi>good old way,</hi> who, from their implicit aſſent to <q>that monſtrous farrago of abſurdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and contradictions, concentrated with moſt ingenious and comprehenſive brevity in the <hi>Creeds</hi> denominated the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> and <hi>Nicene,</hi>

               </q> it ſhould ſeem unmanly to direct our aſſault againſt that quarter from which the leaſt reſiſtance is to be expected. I enter now upon the moſt ſerious part of my Defence.</p>
            <p>As the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt is made by the Apoſtles themſelves the <hi>grand teſt</hi> and <hi>criterion</hi> of his <hi>divine miſſion,</hi> and of the <hi>truth of the Chriſtian religion;</hi> for, <q>if Chriſt be not <hi>riſen,</hi> then is our <hi>preaching</hi> vain, and your <hi>Faith</hi> is vain alſo;</q> (1 Cor. xv. 14.)
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:1025900400:52"/>it will naturally be expected, that our <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pions of the Faith</hi> ſhould reſerve their moſt <hi>formidable batteries</hi> for the bold aggreſſor who dares to lift his impious hand againſt this <hi>ſtrong hold</hi> of their hope. Hence I was led to apprehend a redoubtable diſplay of <hi>heavy artillery</hi> and <hi>weighty arguments</hi> in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to Mr. Paine's bold attack upon the <hi>authenticity</hi> of this important and funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental article of the Chriſtian creed; but not a little was I diſappointed!</p>
            <p>"I ſhall confine myſelf (writes Mr. Wakefield, page 26) <q>to one only argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which appears to my mind inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of confutation upon any principles of philoſophy or experience; and will indeed, admit of no diſpute, but upon poſitions ſubverſive of all hiſtorical teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony whatſoever, and introductory of univerſal ſcepticiſm.</q>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:1025900400:53"/>manners, languages of nations and indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals; political characters of eminence, and their conduct, in connection with a moſt potent and enlightened empire, with a vaſt multiplicity of detached occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences and facts not neceſſary to be ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied at large; all theſe circumſtances, I ſay, probable in themſelves, and of fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity unimpeached, challenge (to ſpeak with moderation) as large a portion of credibility to theſe books, conſidered in the ſimple character of <hi>hiſtorical</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">This poſition, we apprehend, was never called, nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be called in queſtion by Mr. Paine, whoſe animad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions upon the ſcriptures, if we conceive aright, do not attach to them in their <hi>hiſtorical</hi> capacity, as chronicles, and records of human tranſactions and events, (in which light they certainly claim an equal portion of credibility, as long as they ſteer clear of the <hi>marvellous</hi> and <hi>ſupernatural,</hi> with the writings of any other hiſtorian of received veracity) but are ſolely directed againſt their claim to <hi>revelation,</hi> and the <hi>unwarrantable requiſition</hi> they make upon our faith, to tales of moſt <hi>monſtrous prodigy,</hi> which militate directly againſt the eſtabliſhed order of nature, and which the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der therefore has an equal right to reject in the <hi>Chranicles of the Jews,</hi> and in the <hi>Goſpel Narratives,</hi> as he has in the Greek or Roman hiſtorians, Few, it is preſumed, who have read <hi>Plutarch's Lives,</hi> entertain any doubts as to the general authenticity of the tranſactions recorded in that valuable work, and yet many, perhaps, might be found who cannot reconcile their notions of probabilities to a belief in the apparition of the phantom, ſuppoſed to be Coeſar's ghoſt, to his murderer, Brutus, at Abydos. The inference is obvious, and renders all comments upon the caſe unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary.</note> teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials,
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:1025900400:54"/>as can be claimed for any writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings whatever, received as genuine, and equally ancient and multifarious. Now, no mean preſumption ariſes in favour of the moſt <hi>extraordinary</hi> tranſactions alſo, blended in the ſame texture of narrative, by hiſtorians of ſo credible a character with reſpect to the reſt of their relations; but when thoſe <hi>extraordinary facts</hi> are found to have ſo intimate an incorpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the <hi>common</hi> and <hi>unſuſpicious</hi> occurrences of theſe hiſtories, as to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of no detachment, but to ſtand or fall with the main body of the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, ſo that one part depends upon another for conſiſtency and ſupport, I cannot ſee how any hiſtorical probability of the authenticity of theſe <hi>extraordinary</hi>
                  <pb n="57" facs="tcp:1025900400:55"/>events can riſe higher than in ſuch an inſtance.</q>

            <p>When I find ſuch lame ſubterfuge and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtry uſurp the place of ſound argument, I cannot but congratulate Mr. Paine on his triumph. If the <hi>reſurrection of Chriſt</hi> ſtands upon no better baſis than this, rotten is its ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and it muſt inevitably fall to the ground.

Peter, having given offence to the clergy by ſome of his innovations, the prieſthood, among other attempts to baffle his deſigns, had recourſe to a <hi>miracle.</hi> Suddenly it was reported, that the image of the Virgin Mary, in one of their churches, had been obſerved to <hi>weep;</hi> nor was the cauſe of theſe <hi>hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly tears</hi> pointed out in very ambiguous terms. Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes flocked to the <hi>ſacred ſhrine</hi> to convince themſelves by <hi>ocular demonſtration</hi> of the truth of this <hi>portentous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy,</hi> for ſuch the prieſts unanimouſly pronounced it to be, and returned back, like the apoſtles of old, fully ſatisfied of the fact, having <hi>heard,</hi> and <hi>ſeen,</hi> and <hi>handled,</hi> and for aught I know, <hi>taſted</hi> of theſe tears, which many, from a principle of devotion, had caught in handkerchiefs, and even vials, as they fell. At length the monarch, who eaſily penetrated into the true motives of this miracle, was induced to pay the <hi>weeping ſaint</hi> a viſit. Several of the ſuperior clergy accompanied him by his order, in whoſe preſence he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to examine into the myſtery. A ladder being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, Peter aſcended the ſteps, and pulling off the golden crown that encompaſſed the Virgin's head, made a complete diſcovery of the whole plot. The bleſſed Mother of Chriſt, it ſeems, had undergone the trepan; which having laid her ſcull open, a ſilver veſſel, containing about a pint and a half of water, was introduced, which by means of ſmall punctures, was very dexterouſly made to diſtil through the eyes in the form of tears!</note> of the Greek and Romiſh

            <p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:1025900400:58"/>As little can Mr. Wakefield hope to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh the truth of the Reſurrection of Chriſt by inſtancing the unconquered perſeverance with which the apoſtles perſiſted in profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and preaching this doctrine, in ſpite of <q>ridicule, contempt, perſecution, poverty; bodily chaſtiſements, impriſonment, and death</q>—Mr. Wakefield is not aware how ſtrongly and directly this argument makes againſt himſelf. Reaſoning upon the very ſame principle, I will eaſily prove <q>that monſtrous farrago of abſurdities and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictions, concentrated, with moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and comprehenſive brevity in the <hi>creeds</hi> denominated the <hi>Athanaſian</hi> and <hi>Nicene,</hi>
               </q> and which is ſo tough of digeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion to Mr. Wakefield's ſtomach; all this I will eaſily prove to be the <q>
                  <hi>Truth as it is in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi>
               </q> (Epheſ. iv. 21) inaſmuch as many thouſands of ſincere profeſſors, and among theſe <hi>biſhops</hi> themſelves, have ſuffered the moſt cruel and ignominious death, rather than renounce their faith in theſe creeds. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, I am fearful, that in matters of religion there cannot poſſibly be a more fallacious criterion to aſcertain the truth, than the
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:1025900400:59"/>ſtubborn pertinacity with which men adhere to their opinion.</p>
            <p>But by far the weakeſt place in Mr. Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's defence of the reſurrection is the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing paſſage, in which he attempts to invalidate the force of the objections raiſed by Mr. Paine, on the plea of this miracle not being accompanied with that degree of publicity, which the nature of the caſe ſo well admitted of, and which the magnitude of the fact, if true, demanded.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The reſurrection of a dead perſon from the grave, (writes Mr. Paine) and his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion through the air, is a thing very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, as to the evidence it admits of, from the inviſible conception of a child in the womb. The reſurrection and aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, ſuppoſing them to have taken place, admitted of public and ocular demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, like that of the aſcenſion of a balloon, or the ſun at noon-day to all Jeruſalem at leaſt. A thing, which every body is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to believe, requires that the proof and evidence of it ſhould be equal to all, and univerſal: and as the public viſibility of this laſt related act was the only evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that could give ſanction to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:1025900400:60"/>part, the whole of it falls to the ground, becauſe that evidence never was given. Inſtead of this, a ſmall number of perſons, not more than
<note n="*" place="bottom">Here Mr. Paine, as his antagoniſt juſtly obſerves, has fallen into an error, with reſpect to the number of perſons ſaid to have been witneſſes of Chriſt's reſurrection and aſcenſion. The ſtrength of the argument, however, ſuſtains no detriment by it; and furthermore it muſt be remembered, that our author is refuted only by the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle evidence of Paul, (1 Cor. xv. 6.) and that only in one ſolitary inſtance; and who knows but this paſſage, only that it makes againſt the <hi>Author of the Age of Reaſon,</hi> might have been one of Mr. Wakefield's <hi>occaſional inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polations?</hi> (see page 23.)</note> eight or nine, are introduced, as proxies for the whole world, to ſay, they <hi>ſaw</hi> it, and all the reſt of the world are called upon to believe it. But it appears that Thomas did not believe the reſurrection; and, as they ſay, would not believe, without having ocular and manual demonſtration himſelf. <hi>So neither will I:</hi> and the reaſon holds equally good for me, and every other perſon, as for Thomas.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In this ſtatement of our author, whatever Mr. Wakefield may affect to think or ſay to
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:1025900400:61"/>the contrary, I diſcern nothing but juſt and manly argument. It is an eſtabliſhed rule in the moral as well as phyſical world, that the <hi>means ſhould be adequate to the end,</hi> and it is upon this principle that Mr. Paine reaſons in the preſent inſtance. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of Chriſt, as I before obſerved, forming the grand teſt of the truth of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity: to ſubſtantiate and blazon abroad the fact beyond the power of controverſy, becomes an object of the firſt magnitude. As the belief required in it extends to all, Mr. Paine ſtands juſtified in requiring that the evidence of it ſhould be accompanied with a competent degree of publicity. The nature of the fact admitted of ſuch public demonſtration; the magnitude of the object demanded it; and yet—this public demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration is withheld:—the only evidence, which would at once have rendered all the eternal wranglings ſince maintained upon the ſubject unneceſſary; which would have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely baffled all the alledged machinations of the enemies of Chriſt to ſuppreſs the truth and invalidate its force; and which would have procured Chriſtianity a deciſive triumph over ſcepticiſm and infidelity; this
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:1025900400:62"/>only full, ſatisfactory, incontrovertible, irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fragable evidence is not granted. And why not granted? Becauſe, forſooth, its place in the eyes of Mr. Wakefield, is better ſupplied by <q>corroborating coincidencies, collateral cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, by probabilities of the higheſt kind, by indiſſoluble connexions,</q> 
               <hi>et hoc genus omne;</hi> all of which, by the bye, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the inconceivable magnitude of the object; notwithſtanding the incalcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable intereſt at ſtake, do not amount to the ſame degree of poſitive conviction, which impreſſes on the mind of the <hi>geometer</hi> the <q>equality of the <hi>three angles</hi> of a <hi>triangle</hi> to <hi>two right angles.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>We concede, indeed, to Mr. Wakefield, that in occurrences of common life the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring teſtimony of credible and diſinter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſted witneſs may be conſidered as compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent evidence in matters of <hi>plain fact,</hi> which do not militate againſt the eſtabliſhed order of things. Thus, for inſtance, to purſue Mr. Wakefield's own argument, when I firſt heard of the aſcenſion of <hi>Lunardi</hi> from
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:1025900400:63"/>the Artillery ground, in a balloon, I felt myſelf no more diſpoſed to call in queſtion the truth of the report, (notwithſtanding, from the circumſtance of my being abroad at the time, I did not enjoy the advantage of being an eye-witneſs of the fact,) than Mr. Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field could poſſibly do, who, we find, was preſent on that memorable occaſion. But, had I been ignorant of the principle on which balloons are conſtructed; had I never heard or read of the properties of air; had the experiment been made in ſome remote, far diſtant part of the globe, before only a few ſelect friends, and in only one or two ſolitary inſtances, and never afterwards repeated or attempted; had this, I ſay, been the caſe, and any one had told me, under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, that a man had been ſeen to aſcend to a prodigious height in the air, and to purſue his <hi>aerial</hi> excurſion for a conſiderable number of miles with incredible velocity; in that caſe, the faith of the relator of this marvellous account, ſuppoſing him to have been at the ſame time an eye-witneſs of the fact, would, I fancy, exceed mine by many an <hi>"evaneſcent infiniteſimal</hi> of efficacy."

<pb n="66" facs="tcp:1025900400:64"/>though no lapſe of time will probably, with reſpect to the <hi>former</hi> caſe, (the actual aſcenſion of Lunardi, in a balloon, from the Artillery ground) deſtroy a credibility ſo well founded and eſtabliſhed, with reaſonable men; nothing, I apprehend, ſhort of <hi>actual inſpection</hi> and <hi>ocular demonſtration,</hi> would attach faith with thinking minds to the <hi>latter.</hi> Neither would, I preſume, any man's refuſal to credit ſuch an aſcenſion, under the above circumſtances, without poſitive and ocular proof, draw down upon him the ſtigma of <hi>univerſal ſcepticiſm,</hi> though Mr. Wakefield is pleaſed to inſinuate this charge againſt Mr. Paine, when he talks of the man, <q>who is reſolved to believe no tranſaction, but upon <hi>ocular and manual demonſtration,</hi> and who, therefore, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to bely his own theory in every movement of his life.</q>

            <p>Before I diſmiſs the ſubject of the <hi>reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection,</hi> as far as concerns Mr. Wakefield's ſtrictures in favor of it, I muſt ſlightly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark upon a moſt <hi>curious</hi> and <hi>extraordinary</hi> argument, indeed, (ſee page 33) which he brings forward, to juſtify our being left, in this, confeſſedly highly momentous and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1025900400:65"/>affair, to <q>truſt to degrees of <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability</hi> infinitely diverſified</q> (or, in other words, being left in the <hi>dark!</hi>), <q>inſtead of having poſitive <hi>certainty</hi> for our guide.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>I might advance alſo, in aid of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks,</q> (to give the whole of Mr. Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's arguments) <q>that mankind are moſt evidently placed here in a ſtate of <hi>proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary imperfection:</hi> that, inſtead of <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty</hi> for our guide, we are compelled to truſt, on moſt occaſions, to a degree of <hi>probability</hi> infinitely diverſified; and that ſome of our nobleſt and moſt refined ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies both moral and intellectual, ſpring from a forbearance and candour, from a diffidence, and docility, and lowlineſs of underſtanding, which <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable evidence</hi> is beſt calculated to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and foſter. Beſides, that exerciſe and agitation of our mental powers, which is invariably produced by the delays and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties intervening propoſitions of this nature, and the attainment of moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, in a painful diſquiſition of evidence and a long deduction of particulars, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute eſſentially to the quickneſs, the clearneſs, the vigour and general ſalubrity of our underſtandings; juſt as the water
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:1025900400:66"/>of a river is meliorated and refined by a winding obſtructed paſſage over ſand and gravel.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Of all the wretched ſophiſtry I ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member to have met with, on this, or, I might add, on any other ſubject, the preſent furniſhes the moſt conſpicuous, and I think, the moſt contemptible inſtance! Are there not matters enough of <hi>"diſputable evidence"</hi> to generate and foſter our candour and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance, our diffidence and docility, in the <hi>Book of Nature,</hi> without borrowing from the <hi>ſacred pages of Revelation?</hi> Or, if we ſtand in need of <q>exerciſe and agitation of our mental powers, to contribute to the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the clearneſs, the vigour, and general ſalubrity of our underſtandings;</q> might not the time and talents which have been ſpent in the <q>painful diſquiſition of evidence and a long deduction of particulars,</q> to aſcertain the truth of the <hi>reſurrection,</hi> have been far more profitably employed, upon reſearches which have a more immediate reference to the happineſs and improvement of man in his preſent ſtate? We verily think they might; and <hi>maugre</hi> the <hi>profound know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> and <hi>deep metaphyſical reaſoning</hi> contained
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1025900400:67"/>in Mr. Wakefield's remarks, they appear to us in reality deſigned for little more, than to ſerve as a <hi>vehicle</hi> to the author to diſplay his <hi>extenſive reading</hi> and <hi>ready acquaintance</hi> with the Poets of the Auguſtan age.</p>
            <p>The <hi>remarks</hi> (for I cannot call them <hi>argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>) advanced by Doctor Prieſtley, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the evidence of the reſurrection, carry with them ſtill leſs weight and conviction than Mr. Wakefield's ſtrictures. He notices the error into which Mr. Paine has fallen with reſpect to the <hi>number</hi> of perſons who are ſaid to have been witneſſes of Chriſt's aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and which error I have already had oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to remark upon. But we do not find any thing new or ſtriking in his obſervations. A general challenge, indeed, is thrown out to all, who entertain any doubts upon the ſubject, <q>to propoſe any <hi>other circumſtances</hi> that would have made the Reſurrection more credible than it now is at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of time;</q> but, as this challenge has been <hi>anticipated</hi> by Mr. Paine himſelf, and the <hi>propoſal</hi> or <hi>requiſition</hi> made, which would have rendered its evidence incontrovertible, and of courſe have eſtabliſhed its credibility
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:1025900400:68"/>beyond the reach of ſuſpicion or doubt, we deem it unneceſſary to tread over again the beaten track.</p>
            <p>As my deſign is, not ſo much to write a panegyric upon Mr. Paine's work, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, and, if I can, refute the objections which have been made to it, I paſs over moſt of his propoſitions which I do not find attacked by his opponents. Hence I ſhall not dwell upon the maſterly picture he has drawn of his <hi>Satanic Majeſty,</hi> who, I am happy to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, from the readineſs with which Mr. Wakefield gives him up, (and I congratulate my readers upon the pleaſing proſpect) ſeems to be in a fair way of bidding us <hi>Adieu,</hi> and returning once more to the <hi>bottomleſs pit,</hi> where I ſincerely hope the <hi>Angel with the key and the great chain in his hand</hi> (Rev. xx. 1. ſqq.) will take good care of him, and bind and faſten him <hi>up</hi> or <hi>down,</hi> it matters little which, at leaſt a <hi>thouſand years</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:1025900400:69"/>The account given us by Mr. Paine of the <hi>Origin of Chriſtianity</hi> has been ſeverely cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured and attacked by Dr. Prieſtley, who pronounces it to be <q>the moſt <hi>curious ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance</hi> he ever met with.</q> With all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſuperior abilities, I cannot but conceive Doctor Prieſtley to be too haſty in this judgment; and though he particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly prides himſelf on his <hi>dates,</hi> in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to Mr. Paine's practice, who, he tells us, <q>does not <hi>deal in dates,</hi> any more than in <hi>quotations,</hi> writing wholly from <hi>memory,</hi>
               </q> (ſee page 63) it ſhould ſeem that Mr. Paine, without the help of a <hi>book,</hi> has even with reſpect to his <hi>dates,</hi> not erred ſo widely from the truth, as Dr. Prieſtley's ſtrictures would at firſt ſight tempt us to imagine.</p>
            <p>
               <q>The writings aſcribed to the men called Apoſtles,</q> (Mr. Paine obſerves) <q>are chiefly controverſial; and the gloomineſs of the ſubject they dwell upon, that of a man dying in agony on the croſs, is better ſuited to the gloomy genius of a <hi>monk</hi> in his <hi>cell,</hi> by whom it is not <hi>impoſſible</hi> they were written, than to any man breathing the open air of the creation.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:1025900400:70"/>This latter remark of Mr. Paine furniſhes his formidable antagoniſt with a moſt deſirable opportunity of triumph, as he apprehends; but, unfortunately, his triumph is <hi>premature,</hi> as I ſhall endeavour to prove from his own ſtatement of the caſe.</p>
            <p>"As theſe books, written by <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> men," (does Dr. Prieſtley, by this diſtinction, mean to ſignify his aſſent to the doubt ſtarted by our

                  <hi>could,</hi> but by no means to the ſatisfaction of <hi>all.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Doctor Prieſtley allows therefore, that it was nearly four hundred years after the birth of Chriſt, and at leaſt three hundred years after the writing of the major part of the books called the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> according to the common received chronology, before a <hi>ſtandard collection</hi> of theſe books was made.</p>
            <p>That <hi>interpolations</hi> and <hi>ſpurious readings,</hi> (allowing the Books themſelves to have been actually written at the early date I have juſt ſpecified, and by the writers whoſe names they bear,) <hi>might,</hi> in ſuch a long courſe of time, have crept into the text; eſpecially when we conſider that the art of printing was not known in thoſe days, but that every copy required to be individually tranſcribed by an <hi>amanuenſis;</hi> is a <hi>poſſibility,</hi> and, let me add, a <hi>probability,</hi> which I think will be readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded by every candid examiner. That ſome of them might have undergone material alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, or have been new-modelled, or even freſh vamped up, to ſuit particular purpoſes, between the time of their <hi>original compoſition,</hi> and their ſubſequent <hi>incorporation</hi> in the <hi>ſtandard collection,</hi> is likewiſe no <hi>impoſſibility;</hi>
               <pb n="74" facs="tcp:1025900400:72"/>and on this ſuppoſition Mr. Paine ſtands amply juſtified in the inference he draws from the <hi>diſmal complexion</hi> of many of thoſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings (the controverſial parts eſpecially), that it is not impoſſible (and he mentions the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance merely as a <hi>poſſibility,</hi> and by no means as a matter of <hi>poſitive fact</hi>), but they may have been written by ſome gloomy <hi>Aſcetic</hi> or <hi>Monk;</hi> a conjecture which receives addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional weight and plauſibility, when we reflect that

            <p>That Mr. Paine may have carried his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition too far, when he aſcribes the great change that took place in the whole ſyſtem of learning, after the introduction of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, to a <hi>deep, preconcerted ſcheme</hi> on the part of the ſetters-up and advocates of that religion, I ſhall not affect to diſſemble nor deny.

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:1025900400:81"/>may boaſt of the preſervation of literature, by the <hi>Chriſtian monks</hi> of the weſtern and eaſtern Roman empire, as much as he plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, it remains an incontrovertible fact, that the <hi>eternal wranglings about points of faith,</hi> and the <hi>nonſenſical jargon of prieſts,</hi> gave a new turn to the ſtate of learning, which was now made to centre almoſt entirely in <hi>polemical divinity,</hi> and of courſe rendered the acquiſition of thoſe languages, in which the books of the Bible were originally written, the moſt important, if not the only, branch of education.</p>

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:1025900400:82"/>to lay leſs ſtreſs in the ſyſtem of education upon the <hi>dead languages</hi> than is generally done. <hi>Learning</hi> and <hi>knowledge,</hi> though commonly reputed <hi>ſynonimous terms</hi> are far from being ſo in reality.

            <p>Few texts in the Bible, perhaps, are more frequently referred to by the <hi>orthodox Sons of the Church,</hi> to prove the <hi>divinity of Chriſt,</hi> than the following paſſage from St. Paul's firſt Epiſtle to Timothy: <q>And, without controverſy, great is the myſtery of god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs; <hi>GOD</hi> was manifeſt in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, ſeen of angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on

Now would it be believed, and yet the fact is well aſcertained, that the word <hi>God,</hi> in which the whole ſtreſs of the ſentence centres, is not to be met with in the original?

               <hi>Alexandrine Codex</hi> plainly proves. Mr. Prieſtley, I hope, will no longer take upon him to deny, that the truths of Revelation may depend upon very <hi>great niceties!</hi>

               <q>All this may be literally true (ſee page 54) but a palpable untruth is implied in it, that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were really a learned and ſcientific people, whereas their ſcience and their aſtronomy was juſt <hi>nothing at all</hi>

I am ſatisfied that Mr. Paine's ſtrictures contain abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of truth
<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <p>Juſtice, however, requires that I ſhould notice in this place two very palpable errors into which Mr. Paine has fallen, and which are very properly animadverted upon by Dr. Prieſtley, though they ſeem to have eſcaped the <hi>lynx-eyed</hi> criticiſm of Mr. Wakefield. The firſt of theſe errors refers to Mr. Paine's attempt to prove that the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical writings</hi> were written in <hi>poetical meaſure,</hi> by quoting paſſages from the <hi>Engliſh verſion.</hi> The truth of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition itſelf, at leaſt with reſpect to a part, is not deſigned to be called in queſtion; but the argument upon which Mr. Paine grounds his proof is altogether nugatory and fallacious.</p>
                  <p>In the ſecond inſtance, Mr. Paine lays himſelf ſtill more open to animadverſion. His hypotheſis, that there muſt be <hi>degrees</hi> in propheſying, becauſe the prophets are diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed by the appellations of the <hi>greater</hi> and the <hi>minor,</hi> is really calculated to raiſe a ſmile, as Mr. Prieſtley very juſtly obſerves; the term having no reference whatever to the <hi>quality,</hi> but only to the <hi>quantity</hi> of what theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets wrote. In both caſes Mr. Paine is <hi>vulnerable,</hi> and I cannot defend him.</p>
               </note>, and perhaps too much to go down <hi>palatably</hi> in this <hi>age of prophecy and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:1025900400:93"/>revelation.</hi> 
               <q>The axe (to quote our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's own energetic language) ſtrikes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately at the root;</q> it attacks the very <hi>fundamentals</hi> of Chriſtianity, the <hi>teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony of Jeſus being the ſpirit of prophecy.</hi>—(Rev. xix. 10.)</p>
            <p>Such being the ſtate of the caſe, it ſhould ſeem well worth our while to beſtow a little attention and enquiry upon the ſubject.</p>
            <p>"The ſuppoſed prophet (writes our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor) <q>was the ſuppoſed hiſtorian of times to come; and if he happened, in ſhooting with a <hi>long bow</hi> of a thouſand years, to
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:1025900400:94"/>ſtrike within a thouſand miles of the mark, the ingenuity of poſterity could make it point-blank; and if he happened to be directly <hi>wrong,</hi> it was only to ſuppoſe, as in the caſe of Jonah and Nineveh, that God had repented himſelf, and changed his mind.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us next examine Dr. Prieſtley's ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <q>Some parts of the book of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and alſo of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> are written in <hi>ſuch a manner,</hi> that it is probable we ſhall not underſtand them completely, till we can compare them with the events to which they correſpond.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Here then let me put the queſtion to Dr. Prieſtley—Of what ſervice can theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies be, allowing them even to merit the title, if they are ſo <hi>obſcure</hi> that they are not to be <hi>underſtood,</hi> till explained and eluci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated by <hi>fulfilment?</hi> And as by the term <hi>prophecy,</hi> a prediction, we apprehend, is meant, of certain ſpecified events to be veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied or accompliſhed at ſome future period; how are we to know that the writings in queſtion have <hi>any claim to the title,</hi> if they be ſo <hi>darkly worded</hi> that we cannot even
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:1025900400:95"/>aſcertain <hi>what</hi> tranſactions or events they are predictive of? We may on this plea wait till the <hi>end of days,</hi> and ſtill honour them with the <hi>title of prophecies,</hi> in daily hopes of ſome event or other turning up, to which our ingenuity can make theſe <hi>luminous</hi> and <hi>univerſal</hi> predictions refer; for it ſeems they are <hi>prophetical of the firſt plauſible event that ſhall befal!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But it ſeems, the moment this <hi>fortunate and long expected chance</hi> turns up, <q>it is very <hi>poſſible</hi> we may <hi>then</hi> be ſatisfied, that only <hi>He</hi> who can ſee the end from the beginning, could have deſcribed them, <hi>even in that obſcure manner,</hi> ſo long before.</q> Good bye, then, to prophecy, if even the original Revealer of it can ſcarcely ſee his way through the <hi>dark</hi> himſelf!</p>
            <p>Yet ſtill is our determined <hi>champion of the faith,</hi> (and it requires <hi>great faith,</hi> indeed, almoſt enough to remove mountains, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve on ſuch weak, unſatisfactory grounds) ſtill is he not a whit caſt down, nor diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited! He continues:</p>
            <p>
               <q>The <hi>reaſon</hi> of the obſcurity of <hi>thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular prophecies, concerning events which
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:1025900400:96"/>are yet to come,</hi> is pretty obvious
<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Obvious,</hi> indeed! for as the <hi>fortunate chance</hi> of an <hi>antitype</hi> to theſe <hi>myſtical alluſions</hi> has not yet turned up, the believers in them are ſtill <hi>groping about in the dark,</hi> and, like the <hi>prieſts of Baal,</hi> calling upon their God to know whether he be <hi>ſleeping;</hi> or <hi>buſily engaged in granting audience to ſome of his newly-commiſſioned delegates and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets;</hi> or whether, peradventure, he is on a <hi>journey in queſt of fortunate chances, to verify his predictions, and render them intelligible,</hi> that he heareth not, nor yet ſendeth <hi>one ſpark of fire, one ray of light,</hi> to enable them to <hi>ſee their way</hi> through the <hi>prophetical fog</hi> in which <hi>their ſenſes are loſt and bewildered!</hi>
                  </note>. For as theſe prophecies are now in the hands of thoſe who reſpect them, it might have been ſaid, that they contributed to their own fulfilment by the friends of revelation endeavouring ſo bring about the events predicted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>A curious mode of reaſoning, indeed! What a pity theſe prophecies were not writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in <hi>hieroglyphics,</hi> in which caſe they might, poſſibly, have been <hi>more obſcure</hi> and <hi>darker</hi> ſtill than they are in their preſent ſtate! However, as it is, I believe there is very little danger of the believers in them deſtroying the credit of the prophecies <hi>after</hi> fulfilment, by incurring the ſuſpicion of
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:1025900400:97"/>having, from their clear apprehenſion of them, contributed to their verification.</p>
            <p>But not yet, even, is our doughty champion to be diſpirited. He has followed the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice given by the ſpirit to the <hi>angel of the church of Laodicea,</hi> (Rev. iii. 18.) and has wiſely provided himſelf with <hi>eye ſalve,</hi> that <hi>he may ſee,</hi> where others are fain to <hi>ſhut their eyes,</hi> and give up all hopes of extricating themſelves.</p>
            <p>"Though <hi>ſome</hi> intermediate ſteps" (by the bye I am ſadly apprehenſive that <hi>all</hi> the ſteps in the <hi>prophetical ladder</hi> are broken down, ſince none of the admirers and advocates of the ſyſtem are able to get to the <hi>top</hi> of it, in order, from the elevated ſtation it would afford them, to take a nearer <hi>peep into futurity,</hi> and tell us when we may reaſonably expect to ſee the fulfilment of ſome one or other of theſe glorious predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Mr. <hi>Halhed's Millenium,</hi> for inſtance!) <q>though ſome intermediate ſteps in the great train of events be thus obſcure, both the great outline of the whole, and the cataſtrophe are moſt clearly expreſſed. <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure,</hi> as is,</q> (I wonder Mr. Prieſtley ſhould be perpetually harping upon this ſtring; he
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:1025900400:98"/>ſhould, methinks, have rather imitated the dutiful example of the ſons of Noah, and have thrown a <hi>mantle over the nakedneſs of his prophets,</hi> unleſs, indeed, as not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably may be the caſe, this charitable action is already performed by the prophets them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in conſequence of the <hi>thick mantle of obſcurity,</hi> and "darkneſs palpable," in which they have wiſely taken care to wrap them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves up) <q>Obſcure as is the language of theſe prophecies, they plainly enough indicate a <hi>long period of great corruption</hi> in Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity,</q> (methinks there is no need of either <hi>prieſt</hi> or <hi>prophet, apoſtle</hi> nor <hi>commentator,</hi> to tell us <hi>that.</hi> Unleſs, indeed, it be for our <hi>comfort,</hi> that we are foretold this <hi>happy ſyſtem of things,</hi> which has already continued in force a conſiderable length of time, is likely to continue ſo a <hi>great deal longer:</hi> the prophets, in this reſpect, ſeem to have taken pattern from the comforters of poor, afflicted Job!) <q>A <hi>long</hi> period of great corruption in Chriſtianity is indicated; eſpecially by the riſe of a

            <p>Moſes, whoſe views appear to have been no leſs than the eſtabliſhment of <hi>Univerſal Hierarchy,</hi> formed a ſyſtem moſt admirably adapted to promote his ambitious views. He was originally the ſon of an obſcure Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelite, ſaved by ſtealth, as the book of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus informs us, from being put to death in his infancy, in purſuance of the edict of the king of Egypt, to which country the anceſtors of Moſes had emigrated to eſcape

            <p>When advanced to manhood, he diſcovers a <hi>turbulent</hi> diſpoſition
<note n="*" place="bottom">Here I hold myſelf prepared and ready for attack.

They may however, be expreſſed in very few words. I call in doubt his <hi>written character of himſelf,</hi> becauſe it is flatly contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by his <hi>actions.</hi> He ſeeth an Egyptian ſmiting an Hebrew, and ſtraitway his ſpirit waxeth hot, and he falleth upon, and ſtayeth the Egyptian. <hi>Heroic</hi> as this action might otherwiſe appear, were it not for two untoward cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, the <hi>odds</hi> againſt the Egyptian, and the <q>looking of Moſes <hi>this way</hi> and <hi>that way,</hi>
                  </q> (Exod. ii. 12.) to aſſure himſelf that he was ſafe; I greatly doubt whether it can be conſtrued, by any polemical ambidexterity whatever, into a proof of <hi>extraordinary meekneſs.</hi> Again, when the ſeven daughters of the prieſt of Midian are rudely driven away from the watering troughs by the ſhepherds, (men ſeem to have entertained very ſtrange notions of <hi>gallantry</hi> in thoſe days) Moſes, as every gentlemen ought to have done in ſuch a caſe, feels his blood begin to boil; he ſtandeth up, takes the part of the diſtreſſed damſels, and delivereth them out of the hands of the ſhepherds. (Exod. ii. 16, 19.) I am not finding fault with this action, on the contrary, I great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly admire it; it evinces much more true heroiſm (for here we ſee <hi>one</hi> engaged againſt <hi>many</hi>) than the former inſtance. All I contend for is, that it does not ſatisfy me as to the <hi>meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of the man.

The fact is, Moſes (ſuppoſing the writings in queſtion to be actually his own) was no more a novice in the art of writing <hi>Commentaries</hi> than <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> or the moſt enlightened writer of his own memoirs among the moderns: but I am ever apt to diſtruſt the praiſes which people beſtow upon themſelves.</note>; interferes in the

The conſequence is, the Iſraelites, finding themſelves treated with aggravated rigour, remonſtrate with Moſes, and ſeem willing to relinquiſh the deſign of recovering their liberty.

            <p>Our adventurer has now got a conſiderable number of ſubjects, for whom he has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do but provide a place to ſettle in. As it was neceſſary to violate all the laws of
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:1025900400:118"/>of juſtice and humanity, in ſeizing upon the territories of other ſtates, (for none were willing to reſign their lands up to him) he pretends that the grant he had received from God of certain pleaſant lands which ſuited his purpoſe, not only authorized the invaſion of thoſe lands, but moreover enjoined him to butcher and totally extirpate the original in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, ſparing neither men, women, nor children. Thus, by an alledged commandment from the Almighty, are the hearts of the Iſraelites ſteeled to all the cruelties and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities which they afterwards perpetrated.</p>
            <p>Seeing himſelf at the head of a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and of courſe powerful nation, Moſes turns his thoughts to ſecure the continuance of that power which he had ſo ſucceſsfully and artfully uſurped. For this purpoſe he gives a <hi>code of laws</hi> to the Iſraelites, which, like thoſe of <hi>Draco,</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>written in blood!</hi> throws all the power into the hands of <hi>the prieſthood,</hi> which he makes <hi>he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary</hi> in his <hi>own</hi> tribe of Levi, becauſe their progenitor was a blood-thirſty ruffian and cut-throat! (Gen. xxiv. 25, 30.) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrates his brother Aaron <hi>high-prieſt!</hi> and confirms the deſpotiſm of his <hi>hierarchy</hi> by

            <p>That a religion founded upon ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as theſe muſt inevitably tend to bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talize the heart, and lead to the moſt dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bolical actions is ſelf-apparent. Nothing can be cloſer than the intimate connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween religion and morals.

It exhibits little elſe to our view than a black catalogue of the moſt atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious crimes that ever diſgraced human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature. Murders, rapes, enormities of every kind, at the bare mention of which huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity recoils with horror, appear on every page. A captive king is cut in pieces in cool blood <hi>before the Lord</hi> in Gilgal, by the reputed prophet of the Almighty, and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queror whoſe humanity induced him to ſpare the life of his unhappy priſoner, is declared to have forfeited his crown, and to be rejected of the Lord, becauſe he obeyed not the word of his prophet, who commanded him to <q>ſmite Amalek, and utterly deſtroy all that they had, and ſpare them not; but ſlay

            <p>Let us now turn our eye to the <hi>Chriſtian Syſtem:</hi>

            <p>The leading feature of <hi>this</hi> ſcheme is <hi>Redemption.</hi> The <hi>Chriſtian Scriptures</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur with the <hi>Jewiſh Chronicles</hi> in inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, that man, deviating from the line of rectitude, by liſtening to the ſeductions of wayward appetite
<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſtate the propoſition in Mr. Wakefield's own words (ſee page 62) to give it in its moſt unexceptionable form.</note>, entailed <hi>death</hi> and <hi>miſery</hi> upon all his numerous poſterity, not <hi>one</hi> of whom <hi>(Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elijah</hi> excepted, and why <hi>they</hi> ſhould be excepted we ſee no reaſon) eſcape the puniſhment due to Adam's diſobedience, though not one of them acceſſary to his crime.</p>
            <p>Nearly four thouſand years elapſe, man continuing all that time to ſuffer the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:1025900400:121"/>of a guilt he had not incurred, when a Saviour is born in Bethlehem; whether by <hi>divine conception</hi> or not, is nothing to the preſent queſtion. This illuſtrious perſonage is held up as the <hi>ſcape goat</hi> of the whole human race, who is to expiate the guilt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred by the original tranſgreſſor.</p>
            <p>Both theſe doctrines therefore proceed upon one and the ſame principle. The one damns all mankind for a <hi>guilt</hi> in which (one only pair excepted) they had no <hi>participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and the other profeſſes to ſave theſe wretched victims for the <hi>merit</hi> of another, in which they were equally <hi>neuter.</hi> Thus injuſtice forms the grand characteriſtic of them both.</p>
            <p>The glaring abſurdity, and, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, injuſtice, of this ſcheme, are ſo ably pointed out by Mr. Paine (whoſe <hi>notion of Redemption</hi> I conceive to be a very juſt one, though poſſibly derived from his <hi>father</hi>'s
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. Wakefield, p. 61.</note> inſtruction), that I forbear to go over the ground he has already ſo ſucceſsfully trodden However, to ſtate one argument which I do
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:1025900400:122"/>not find urged by our Author, I object to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, excluſive of every other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, on the plea that <hi>juſtice</hi> is not done by it to man.</p>
            <p>Adam tranſgreſſes, and his whole poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is doomed to <hi>die.</hi> This doom is carried into moſt rigorous execution, for not one (our two Old Teſtament worthies excepted) eſcape its force. As
<note n="*" place="bottom">Here I am well aware of a whole hoſt of quibblers, that will not fail to fall foul upon me with their ridiculous diſtinction between <hi>natural</hi> death and <hi>ſpiritual</hi> death; but, to give them their fulleſt ſwing, they muſt allow that <hi>natural death,</hi> if it did not conſtitute the <hi>whole</hi> of Adam's puniſhment, forms however, a <hi>part;</hi> and this conceſſion granted (and grant it they <hi>muſt</hi>) my argument holds equally good.</note> 
               <hi>death</hi> therefore was the puniſhment denounced againſt ſin, it was impoſſible for <hi>any</hi> Redemption to take place, after the puniſhment had once been actually inflicted. Unleſs, indeed, as ſoon as the proxy-expiation was effected, thoſe who had already paid the forfeit, that is to ſay, all the perſons who have died from Adam to Chriſt, had been reſtored to life; for, if I am arreſted for a debt, and a friend is generous enough to diſcharge it for me, I am no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in priſon.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="tcp:1025900400:123"/>Again, allowing even the <hi>poſſibility</hi> of Redemption; nay I will go a ſtep further, and ſuppoſe it to have <hi>actually taken place;</hi> ſtill I maintain, that <hi>juſtice</hi> is not done to man by it. Adam's tranſgreſſion damns me, <hi>ipſo facto,</hi> without any act of mine. I have a right, therefore, when Redemption is held out to my view, to expect that I ſhall benefit by it upon the <hi>ſame terms.</hi> I have a right to ſtand <hi>neuter</hi> in the buſineſs; and as I am damned by <hi>Adam's Fall,</hi> whether I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs to believe in it or not, I have a right to benefit by <hi>Chriſt's Redemption,</hi> whether I make it my creed of faith or not. Upon any other terms this Redemption becomes partial and unjuſt.</p>
            <p>Having thus ſtated the inconſiſtency of the ſcheme in <hi>theory,</hi> I proceed to try its merits by the touchſtone of <hi>practice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is by the <hi>fruit</hi> that we judge of the <hi>tree;</hi> and even the Chriſtian ſcheme allows the juſtice of this principle. I have already ſhown the intimate connexion between Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and Religion in the caſe of <hi>Judaiſm;</hi> I ſhall now diſcuſs the ſame topic with refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to <hi>Chriſtianity.</hi>

                  </gap>ſt Jew</hi> was the man that conformed moſt ſcrupulouſly to the outward ceremonies of the Levitical law; the <hi>beſt Chriſtian</hi> is the man who has the ſtrongeſt faith. The ſinner, who tranſgreſſed againſt any ordinance of the Moſaic diſpenſation, not puniſhable with death was made to <hi>ſmart</hi> for his crime, by the <hi>forfeit</hi> he had to pay under the name of an <hi>offering.</hi> Under the Chriſtian diſpenſation the moſt damnable ſins (provided they do not offend againſt the ſtatute) may be committed one moment, and repented of the next, and pardoned to boot, without coſting the ſinner one farthing, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he has the misfortune (for ſuch I muſt conſider it in this light) to belong to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh church; in which caſe he will have to pay (but I believe the terms are pretty mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate) for abſolution.</p>
            <p>Whether he pays, however, or not; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he be a diſciple of the Church of Rome, or a diſciple of the church of England, it makes no difference as to his conduct. In the former caſe, he can buy a licence to ſin on with impunity, for three, or four, or a dozen years together, according as his purſe
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1025900400:125"/>holds out; in the latter he may ſin and pay nothing: but then the Proteſtant who does not pay, muſt be at the trouble of repenting, which the Catholic, who pays, has no need to do. Thus they ſtand both nearly upon a level. Now let us ſee what good effects this bleſſed Religion produces in their practice.</p>
            <p>The Chriſtians, long perſecuted by the Jews and Pagans, no ſooner get out of the fire themſelves, than they begin to thruſt others into it. They retaliate upon the Jews, they retaliate upon the Pagans, and when they have no common enemies to perſecute, they fall out among themſelves, and begin to worry each other. Their religion at length branches out into two diſtinct ramiſications; which is not to be wondered at, as I have already demonſtrated Chriſtianity to be <hi>theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retical;</hi> whereas Judaiſm was <hi>practical.</hi> Theſe two <hi>branches,</hi> though originating from the <hi>ſame ſtem,</hi> harbour greater hatred to each other, than if they were <hi>rival trees.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution rages hotter now than ever; the elder branch, being the moſt powerful, as matured and invigorated by age, carries it awhile with a high and daring hand. At length the younger branch attains to ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:1025900400:126"/>growth and vigour to diſpute the day, and retaliates in its turn upon the elder branch. Thus they continue worrying each other, till their mutual intereſts compel them to live more neighbourly together: but neither ſhould a ſingle leaf on the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant branch enjoy one viſit from the genial beams of the ſun, if the Catholics could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it; nor the ſame bleſſing be allowed to the leaves of the Catholic branch, if the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants had it in their power to caſt a ſhade upon them.

            <p>Religion being thus made to conſiſt in faith, or in other words, in opinion; and opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions being as various as there are heads to harbour thoſe opinions, the moſt abſurd and monſtrous doctrines are engrafted upon it.
