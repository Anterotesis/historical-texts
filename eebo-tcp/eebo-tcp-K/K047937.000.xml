            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>WHOEVER takes a view of the late well-intended at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts to recommend a leſs painful method of ſuppreſſing the hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage from divided arteries, than is generally practiſed, will find that theſe writers have omitted to aſcertain by proper experiments the principles on which the ſuppreſſion depends; and upon enquiry the different theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which have been invented by other writers will appear to be greatly defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, and deſtitute of any fact or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment ſufficient to evince their truth.</p>
            <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0153202200:4"/>
            <p>Indeed Mr. Gooch<note n="*" place="bottom">Caſes, p. 140. London 1758.</note> has conſidered this affair nearly in its true light; but as what he ſays is only conjectural, it ſeems not to have gained preference to the other hypotheſes which have been advanced; a very ingenious ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon at this time adopting the opinion of Pouteau<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. White on Spunge.</note>.</p>
            <p>In fact, this part of practice has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways been defective, by not learning from nature the true intentions to be anſwered. Hence, from not acting upon right principles, remedies have been applied at random; and nature has often effected a cure, in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the moſt barbarous and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0153202200:5"/>applications. The different ſpecifics which have been cried up and in vogue, and the multiplicity of remedies, ſufficiently point out the uncertainty with which this ſubject has been treated; for had the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples on which we were to proceed been aſcertained, the moſt effectual applications would eaſily have been diſcovered, and the reſt diſcarded as uſeleſs. And though ſince the needle and ligature were introduced, we have been more ſteady in our practice, yet I apprehend we have, even in this particular, been not quite free from imperfection.—And were we not ſo unſettled, as to be near giving it up for remedies recommended with only ſuppoſed advantages?</p>
            <pb n="x" facs="tcp:0153202200:6"/>
            <p>The following eſſay is therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to ſupply theſe defects; and I hope, by proper experiments, and giving a new light to ſeveral facts, I have both aſcertained the principles on which a ſuppreſſion of the flux from divided arteries depends, and what method moſt ſafely and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually, under different circumſtances, anſwers this purpoſe.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the natural or ſpontaneous ſuppreſſion of Haemorrhages from divided arteries.</head>
               <p>WHEN agaric of the oak was firſt introduced in England, for ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing the haemorrhage from divided arteries, I made ſeveral experiments to try in what manner it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced its effects; and I was ſoon convinced, that it had no other property than that of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hering
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0153202200:8"/>cloſe to the mouth of the veſſel: this circumſtance, together with conſidering how often the ſmaller arteries cloſe themſelves by their own natural contraction, and that it was common for very conſiderable arteries to be cloſed in the ſame manner, when the impulſe of the blood was abated by the ſwooning of the patient<note n="*" place="bottom">See Baron Van Swieten's Comm. vol. ii, p. 34. and Phil. Tranſ. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 449. p. 313.</note>, led me to imagine that the ſame thing muſt of courſe happen in the large arteries, provided the paſſage of the blood through them be firſt intercepted for a time, and that the cloſe contraction which was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in thoſe arteries<note n="†" place="bottom">Warner's Caſes, p. 136.</note> to which the agaric had been applied, was intirely owing to the courſe of the blood being impeded by block<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the end of the veſſel.</p>
               <p>Every day's experience confirmed me in this opinion; for I found that the flux from very conſiderable arteries was eaſily and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually ſuppreſſed by only making a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendicular preſſure a few minutes upon the end of the veſſel.—But, in order to be more
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0153202200:9"/>certain about this matter, in the latter end of the year 1755 I made the following experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>After tying a large horſe down, Mr. Peale of Maidſtone, then with me, took off one of his hind legs about the middle of the thigh: immediately upon the bone being divided, the horſe drew the ſtump towards his body, at which time the tourniquet ſlipt off, and five arteries, the leaſt of them about the ſize of a wheat-ſtraw, ſome near as large as a gooſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quill, and one much larger, poured out with great vehemence; but an immediate ſtop was put to the flux by a perſon preſſing with both hands upon the wound; and by continuing this preſſure fifteen minutes, the veſſels be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo firmly cloſed as not to diſcharge the leaſt drop of blood. However I paſſed a needle and thread round one of the largeſt, intending to make an experiment with the ligature.</p>
               <p>The pulſation at firſt was very plainly ſeen at their extremities; but after ſome time it became leſs perceptible, and the wound was
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0153202200:10"/>covered with tow, which was kept on with very ſlight bandage.</p>
               <p>The horſe was kept alive forty-eight hours after the operation; and though he tumbled about and ſtruggled much in attempting to raiſe himſelf up, yet there was not any return of the haemorrhage, nor did there appear the leaſt pulſation.</p>
               <p>After he was killed we diſſected the thigh, and found that the bleeding was not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by congealed blood, but by all the veſſels being quite cloſe contracted for near an inch or more from their extremity.</p>
               <p>After this I made more experiments of the ſame kind upon brutes with the ſame ſucceſs, and always found, upon diſſection, the ends of the veſſels cloſe contracted for a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable way: by removing my fingers from time to time, while I preſſed upon the veſſel, it was eaſy to diſcover this contraction taking place by a gradual decreaſe of the ſtream of blood; but in Auguſt 1757 the following caſe gave a further light to this matter.</p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:0153202200:11"/>
               <p>Joſ. Ayre of Caudwell, about twenty years of age, in being bled had the misfortune to have the humeral artery opened along with the baſilic vein, and the operator with much difficulty ſuppreſſed the haemorrhage by ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage: however a tumor with great pulſation ſoon began to ariſe in the part wounded, which in ſix or ſeven weeks increaſed to the ſize of a pullet's egg.</p>
               <p>The nature of the tumor was at once evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, and an eſchar on the upper part of it being upon the point of ſeparation, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined me to perform the operation for the aneuriſm.</p>
               <p>The impulſe of the blood againſt the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture at the time of the operation was very great; and as part of the artery (whoſe dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter was conſiderably enlarged) was expoſed, its pulſation was remarkably viſible: but upon removing the dreſſings the third day after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the pulſation could neither be ſeen nor felt nearer to the ligature than an inch and half; whence I was led to conclude, that the artery had collapſed and gradually cloſed itſelf
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0153202200:12"/>up to the neareſt lateral branches, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance towards the ligature abated from the blood paſſing through thoſe veſſels.—And it appeared to me ſelf-evident that nature always took this ſtep to ſuppreſs the haemorrhage from divided arteries, when I reflected that the ſame circumſtance conſtantly happens, when the umbilical veſſels are divided at the birth of the foetus.</p>
               <p>However, as I did not look for the lateral branches in the experiments mentioned, I cut off another horſe's tail near his body, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed the haemorrhage by preſſing a few mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes with my fingers; and by a careful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſection the next day after he was killed, I found that the concluſion I had drawn was (in this ſubject at leaſt) perfectly right.</p>
               <p>Is it not owing to this cauſe that an hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage does not follow thoſe mortifications, where the greateſt part of the limb is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and ſeparates? For if the great veſſels were cloſed no farther than where the morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication ends, a flux of blood muſt of courſe enſue upon the coming away of the dead
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0153202200:13"/>parts. Is not this evinced in a caſe lately pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by Mr. Antrobus<note n="*" place="bottom">Med. Obſerv. &amp; Inq. vol. ii. p. 152.</note>? where, though the mortification ſtopped only two inches above the ancle, yet it is probable that the large arteries cloſed themſelves as far at leaſt as where the femoral artery divides below the knee; becauſe neither pulſation nor hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage appeared when the leg was taken off.</p>
               <p>It will not, I imagine, appear at all ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, that the cloſing of the end of the veſſel an inch only, or perhaps leſs, ſhould be ſufficient to reſiſt the force of the circulation, when it is conſidered, that this impulſe againſt the end of the artery immediately becomes leſs, and ſoon intirely ceaſes, from the blood upon meeting with reſiſtance dilating and paſſing through the neareſt lateral branches; as is fully evident from the gradual decreaſe, and at length the total diſappearance, of pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation.</p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0153202200:14"/>
               <p>Nor is this contraction of the artery and the alteration in the courſe of the blood long in taking place, as appears from the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments mentioned: and beſides theſe, in many inſtances I have obſerved, that arteries as large as thoſe we commonly meet with in cutting for the ſtone, or in taking off ſchir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous breaſts, &amp;c. will for the moſt part, if they are wholly divided, be effectually cloſed by preſſure in three or four minutes. And if in taking off a leg, we intercept the courſe of the blood longer than is uſually done, moſt of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries will often be cloſed, if the patient is in a tolerable good habit, as I have learnt by tying the large veſſels without looſening the tourniquet.</p>
               <p>I took off a woman's leg near the middle of her thigh, and tied the large artery with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out looſening the tourniquet; upon ſetting it at liberty, we obſerved ſome blood draining down the muſcles from one artery only, and though it had contracted itſelf ſo much as ſcarce to admit the paſſage of any blood, yet by the pulſation it appeared to be a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0153202200:15"/>veſſel, and on this account the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature was uſed.</p>
               <p>Several more, which did not bleed, were diſcovered by a ſtrong pulſation at their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities; and therefore, inſtead of immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately dreſſing the patient, we waited ten or fifteen minutes, and gave her wine to raiſe her ſpirits, ſo that we might ſee whether they would bleed or not, and thereby prevent our being alarmed with a freſh haemorrhage after ſhe was put to bed: but during this time the pulſation gradually diſappeared, and the bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was effectually ſtopped.</p>
               <p>Indeed, ſince I have attended to this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance I have ſeen it ſo often happen, that I am well convinced in amputations larger veſſels have been truſted with lint and flour than has generally been imagined; and that when a freſh haemorrhage returns ſome hours after an operation, it is not from ſmall arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries being dilated by an increaſed motion in the blood, as has generally been thought, but to the principal lateral branches which had cloſed themſelves being again forced open.</p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0153202200:16"/>
               <p>That the large arteries are alſo cloſed in a very little time, does not only appear from the experiment made upon the horſe's leg, but likewiſe in ſeveral of thoſe caſes where the courſe of the blood was intercepted, either by the application of agaric or other fungous ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, eſpecially a caſe related by Mr. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner<note n="*" place="bottom">Caſes, p. 147, 148.</note>, where, <q>"in an hour after the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the mouths of the veſſels were found totally contracted, ſo as to reſiſt the whole force of the circulation;"</q> after which they probably, like the umbilical veſſels, ſhrink into a perfect cord, and become impervious.— And does not nature ſeem to point out, that intercepting the paſſage of the blood for a while, is all that is required from art; as ſome animals by inſtinct, in ſeparating their young from the placenta, lacerate the cord with their teeth, whence probably the ragged fibres ſtop up the end of the veſſel by col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing over each other?</p>
               <p>Seeing then that nature ſuppreſſes the hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage from divided arteries by the natural
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0153202200:17"/>contraction of their circular fibres, when the impediment to this contraction is removed, by intercepting the impulſe of the blood, let us fairly enquire what method beſt anſwers this purpoſe, beginning with the ligature, on account of its having been long in general uſe.</p>

               </head>
               <p>THE ſucceſs which has hitherto in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral attended the ligature, is a full proof of its efficacy; and it is evident no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can more powerfully intercept the courſe of the blood, provided it can be properly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: and though it ſeems to have been a general opinion, that the veſſel only unites in that part where the ſtricture is made, and preference has on that account been lately given to other remedies<note n="*" place="bottom">Philoſ. Tranſ. vol. xlvii. art. 94.</note>; yet I imagine, from what has been ſaid, it will readily be conceived that it is alſo in this caſe cloſed by its own natural contraction, and which will be found true, if the end of the artery can be diſcovered.</p>
               <p>But this is often difficult, it being at firſt commonly covered with the ſwelled muſcles,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0153202200:19"/>and after ſome time ſends out (like all other parts) new fleſh, and cannot be diſtinguiſhed: therefore as a proof, I ſhall obſerve that the artery which was tied in the horſe's leg, was net only cloſed below, but alſo at leaſt half an inch above the ligature; ſo that every ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage poſſible, in regard to ſtopping the blood, is obtained, provided the end of the veſſel does not ſeparate and come away with the ligature; for though no inconvenience will follow, if the ſtricture is made ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from the lateral branches; yet, if it happens to be very near, a freſh flux of blood muſt enſue, which is probably one reaſon why there are ſome few inſtances to be met with of the arteries bleeding again ſome time after they have been tied.</p>
               <p>But, from attending ſeveral years to this particular, I find that the end of the veſſel does not ſo often come away as is imagined, and that a ſeparation may be generally avoided, as it only happens when the ligature is thin, and very little ſubſtance is compriſed along with the veſſel in the nooſe; whereas when we take in a proper quantity of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0153202200:20"/>parts to defend it, and the ligature is of a proper ſize, upon digeſtion coming on it becomes looſe and ſlips off, leaving the veſſel firmly cloſed and intire.</p>
               <p>However, that we may avoid with as much certainty as poſſible the ſeparation of the end of the veſſel, I would adviſe that the ligature ſhould be made of long twelve-penny flax, without either being the leaſt twiſted or waxed further than juſt the end, to make it paſs thro' the eye of the needle; and if it is rubbed over with ſome ſoft digeſtive, it will ſlip ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily through the fleſh.</p>
               <p>This will be found ſufficiently ſtrong for the purpoſe for which it is wanted, without the leaſt danger of its injuring the veſſel; nor need the compreſſure be greater than is juſt neceſſary to intercept the paſſage of the blood, which will ſtill add to the ſecurity in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, and at the ſame time produce other advantages, as will be obſerved in their proper place.</p>
               <pb n="15" facs="tcp:0153202200:21"/>
               <p>And further, if the ligature can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly applied, it is equally effectual, whether the artery be only in part or intirely divided; whether it is at liberty to retract itſelf, or ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres to an undivided muſcle or the bone. And if the needle can be paſſed a proper depth into the adjacent parts, no accident can remove it, if they are ſound, till the ſtate of contraction and inflammation is over; when, in general, all will have been done that is neceſſary, the preſſure of the ſwelled muſcles moſt effectually aſſiſting the cloſing of the veſſels.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, along with theſe advantages it muſt be confeſſed, that great pain often ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies the uſe of the ligature; which, where it cannot be avoided, would make us prefer any other remedy that is equally ſafe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attended with this inconvenience. But it very fortunately happens, that where the ligature is moſt wanted, it may be applied with very little or no pain, if properly managed; for the large arteries are commonly ſurrounded with a conſiderable quantity of cellular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brane;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0153202200:22"/>and if we only take in with the veſſel this nearly inſenſible ſubſtance, the patient ſeems undiſturbed during the operation<note n="*" place="bottom">See Monro, Ed. Med. Eſſ. vol. iv. p. 264.</note>: and upon enquiring of ſeveral at the time of tying the veſſel, whether they felt much pain, I have always been anſwered in the negative; and though the nerve which accompanies the artery is incloſed in the nooſe, it makes no difference in regard to this circumſtance.</p>
               <p>Perhaps it may ſeem ſtrange to thoſe who have not conſidered this matter, that great pain ſhould not ariſe upon a nerve, which is an organ of ſenſation, being compreſſed; but there are ſeveral inſtances in the practice of ſurgery, beſides this, which lead us to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that the nerves are incapable of being irritated, till they are diveſted of their cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, unleſs you penetrate through their coats down to the medullary ſubſtance<note n="†" place="bottom">In performing the operation upon an aneuriſm ſome time ſince, I accidentally had an opportunity of obſerving the difference betwixt pricking and tying a nerve.
<p>In paſſing the needle under the artery it penetrated the nerve, upon which the patient inſtantly cried out of great pain all down his arm, which ceaſed when the needle was withdrawn. But though the ſame nerve was afterwards incloſed in the ligature along with the artery, the patient told me he only felt a prickling and numbneſs, which ſoon went off.</p>
                  </note> conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0153202200:23"/>when they are alſo defended by the artery, fat, and cellular membrane, they will ſtill be leſs liable to be affected.</p>
               <p>This may be illuſtrated by reflecting on the ſituation of the nerves in the bones, tendons, membranes, and the like; where they ſeem to be rendered inſenſible and incapable of being irritated by the compactneſs of the parts which inveſt them<note n="*" place="bottom">It does not hence follow, that <q>"wounds of the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons are the moſt eaſily cured of all others only by the help of nature, without any trouble or bad ſymptom,"</q> as an author of eminence has aſſerted: and as it will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain part of what is hereafter ſaid about convulſions, we ſhall juſt obſerve, that though the tendons in their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſtate are void of ſenſibility, yet, when they become ſwelled and tenſe, more painful and troubleſome ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms generally ariſe in theſe than in other wounds; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably from the particular ſtructure of the part, by which the obſtruction riſes higher and is long in terminating, and the nerves during this ſtate are put more upon the ſtretch than in any other part of the body. But this does not hold good when a tendon is much lacerated, or a large wound is made in any other tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous part; for then they remain inſenſible, and give no other diſturbance than from the length of time they take to ſeparate; very likely from the obſtructed fluids being freely diſcharged, and the nerves being in a ſtate of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laxation.</note>, as appears from
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0153202200:24"/>the new fleſh which follows their being wounded, being ſenſible, and again loſing its ſenſibility, as the part acquires its natural tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
               <p>With this we may obſerve that numbneſs, the uſual conſequence of compreſſing a nerve, cannot here give any uneaſineſs, becauſe the parts to which the nerves were diſtributed are removed.</p>
               <p>However, when the veſſels are ſo ſituated that muſcular fibres muſt of courſe be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed, the ligature will unavoidably be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with conſiderable pain; owing proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the nerves being diveſted of their cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and their medullary ſubſtance alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded over every fibre of a muſcle; not, I imagine, in the form of papillae, but in the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0153202200:25"/>ſame manner, though much thinner, as the retina in the bottom of the eye<note n="*" place="bottom">If I am not much miſtaken, in tracing the nerves through the muſcles I have ſeen them become a perfect mucus in this manner; and whoever will compare, by the help of a proper glaſs, the medullary part of the brain or a nerve cut open, with muſcular fibres, which are not dried by being expoſed to the air, will find that they are covered with a kind of pulp that has exactly the ſame appearance. And does not an obſervation of Haller's (Senſib. &amp; Irritab. p. 59.) ſeem to confirm this opinion; for in attempting to prove that irritability reſides in the glutinous mucus, he ſays, <q>"the moſt irritable parts are deprived of that quality only by robbing them of this mucus by drying;"</q> which is eaſily explained, if in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of mere gluten, this proves to be the medullary part of the nerve.
<p>Hence too we may eaſily ſee, how every part of the body (except thoſe which are ſecured by a particular ſtructure) is liable to be affected by the point of the fineſt needle. And how pain is carried by conſent of parts all over the body, neither of which can be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, if the nerves are ſuppoſed to continue diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct cords to their extremities.</p>
                  </note>.</p>
               <p>But this pain is only momentary, becauſe whatever is incloſed becomes nearly inſenſible upon the ſtricture being made. If the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture recommended is uſed, the parts will be
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0153202200:26"/>leſs irritated; and whether the abſolute ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt a future haemorrhage does not fully compenſate for the uneaſineſs the patient feels on this account, may be gathered from what follows.</p>
               <p>But it is thought, <q>"that the ligature, by compreſſing the adjacent nerve, is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times productive of convulſions."</q> Now as no facts are brought to ſupport this opinion, and as I have never yet ſeen any accident of this kind happen, though I have always, without regarding the nerve, freely uſed the needle and ligature; nor, upon ſtrict enquiry, found one inſtance of its happening amongſt an extenſive chirurgical acquaintance, I am induced to think with Mr. Sharp<note n="*" place="bottom">Crit. Inq. p. 291.</note>, that the doctrine of convulſions being cauſed by the tying of a nerve is merely ſpeculative, and ſeems, though the theory is changed, to have taken its riſe from the arguments brought againſt Parey, when he firſt introduced the practice of tying the arteries, and ſince to have been copied from one to another by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding writers.</p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0153202200:27"/>
               <p>But is it not probable that in this inſtance, as well as many others in ſurgery, by quite altering the meaning of the word NERVUS we have made thoſe ſymptoms follow the tying of a nerve, which ſhould have been conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered only as the conſequence of pricking a tendon? for long after Parey's time NERVUS was uſed to ſignify TENDON, and by <q>"ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voſam aliquam partem, vel nervum<note n="†" place="bottom">Nam ſi acu nervoſam aliquam partem, vel nervum ipſum pupugerit, dum ita novo &amp; inuſitato modo venam abſurde conatur conſtringere, nova inflammatio neceſſario conſequetur, à quo convulſio, &amp; à convulſione cita mors. See Parey's Surgery, p. 1133.</note>,"</q> &amp;c. there is great reaſon to think Parey's adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary meant a tendon or any tendinous part; eſpecially as he ſupports his opinion by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that for fear of the accidents deſcribed, Galen durſt not ſtitch tranſverſe wounds till he had firſt diſcovered the <hi>aponeuroſis of the muſcles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>However, we will conſider this matter in the light it now ſtands; and for this purpoſe we may obſerve, that the ligature ſeems only
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0153202200:28"/>capable of irritating and of totally obſtructing the nerves.</p>
               <p>Now as the nerves upon the muſcular fibres are very eaſily irritated, a theory plauſible enough may be invented to ſhew, that in cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain habits convulſions will come on upon their being tied; but then this would moſt probably happen at the very time they were irritated<note n="*" place="bottom">See Sharp's Crit. Inq. p. 292.</note>: ſo far from this, no one that I know of has even pretended to ſay, that he has ſeen any patient fall into convulſions at the time the ſtricture was made. It is true there are inſtances where convulſions have inſtantly been brought on by irritation<note n="†" place="bottom">See Van Swieten's Comm. vol. ii. p. 47.</note>; but they ſeem not to have any analogy with the caſe in hand: for the parts were diſeaſed, and in all probability had a more acute feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than ever happens to the nerves in their natural ſtate, and conſequently different effects would ariſe.—May not the pain in this caſe, as it is ſmart and of ſhort duration only, ſomewhat in the manner of volatiles applied
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0153202200:29"/>to the noſe, rather enliven the ſpirits than bring on convulſions?</p>
               <p>On the other hand, if convulſions aroſe in conſequence of the nerve being obſtructed, inſtead of being a ſymptom that but very rarely happens, they would either in a greater or leſs degree appear almoſt every time a large one was tied; for if theſe are, as is generally believed, diſtinct cords from their origin, the obſtruction and its effects would be always nearly the ſame. But ſo far from this, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions of any kind are not more frequent where the large nerves are incloſed in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature, than in ſlight injuries where it is not uſed.</p>
               <p>Lately Le Dran<note n="*" place="bottom">Op. Surgery, p. 428.</note> ſeems to have biaſſed the minds of people<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Warner's Caſes, p. 146.</note> in favour of this doctrine; but unfortunately his practice immediately contradicts his theory: for ſpeaking of thoſe who, in performing the operation for the aneuriſm, incloſe the adjacent fleſh within
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0153202200:30"/>the ligature, he ſays<note n="{horizontal ‡}" place="bottom">Loc. cit. p. 409.</note>, <q>"though by this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod they tie the nerve together with the artery, yet it is very ſeldom any ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences enſue from thence, as the quantity of fleſh included by the ligature prevents the nerve from being much compreſſed."</q> And does not the ſame reaſoning hold good, as is already ſhewn in amputations, where as great a quantity of the neighbouring parts is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly incloſed? Beſides, when he tells us, <q>"that tying the nerve along with the veſſel, ſometimes brings on convulſions ſome days after the ligature is made."</q> He alſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, <q>"that there will not be any danger of this happening, if we apply a button of <hi>vitriol</hi> when the dreſſings are firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved;"</q> which, he ſays, <q>"gradually forms an eſchar that includes the ligature, and renders it uſeleſs."</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now in a few days the ligature becomes looſe ſpontaneouſly, and is no longer capable of doing injury. The parts being now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed and more ſenſible, <hi>vitriol</hi> will act with
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0153202200:31"/>great violence upon the nerves; ſo that if no ill effects aroſe from this complicated treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, much leſs could they ariſe from the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature alone.</p>
               <p>If the convulſions then were not the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the dying ſtate of the patient<note n="*" place="bottom">Sharp's Crit. Inq. p. 292.</note>, is it not probable they were owing to the nerves being irritated, either with acrid mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſome other cauſe? for it is well known after the inflammation comes on the nerves become tenſe, and acquire a more acute feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſometimes, where the fluids are very acrid, in few days are rendered ſo extremely ſenſible, as to bring on convulſions upon the ſlighteſt touch: and this ſeems to hold equally good in regard to the locked jaw, which within theſe few years has been ſaid, <q>"ſometimes to come on in conſequence of the ſtricture made upon the arteries and their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring parts by ligatures;"</q> for in all the caſes of this kind which have come to my knowledge, it appears not to have happened till the injured part has been inflamed and painful. In wounds it has often come on,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0153202200:32"/>when there has been the greateſt reaſon to believe that the habit was become bad<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Clephane ſays, <q>"In all the caſes of the locked jaw I ever ſaw, the blood appeared of a looſe texture, never ſizey."</q> Med.

But it ſeems moſt frequently to have occurred in wounds of the joints and other mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>branes<note n="†" place="bottom">See Hippoc. de Morb.

Inq. vol. i. caſe 1 and 7. and vol. 2. caſe 24.</note>, where the nerves being put more upon the ſtretch are more liable to produce this terrible ſymptom, which ſeems only to differ from other convulſions in its degree of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and affects thoſe, probably, where the whole nervous ſyſtem is in a moſt extreme degree of irritability, as appears by the large and repeated doſes of opium neceſſary to quiet the ſpaſms.</p>
               <p>From the whole then of what has been ſaid, there is reaſon to acquit the ligature of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0153202200:33"/>being productive of thoſe convulſions which ſometimes have happened to attend a wound wherein it has been uſed.</p>
               <p>Another kind of ſpaſms, that are partial and attended with pain, are ſaid conſtantly to attend the uſe of the needle and ligature; and it muſt be confeſſed, that while the needle is piercing a muſcle a ſpaſm is often produced: but it may with equal truth be obſerved, that it immediately ceaſes when the parts incloſed are numbed with the ligature. And it ſeems more likely that thoſe ſpaſms, which conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue more or leſs for ſome time after the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ariſe from the nerves being irritated by the knife, by the air, and by the dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; for whoever attends to this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance will find, that the ſpaſms which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, for inſtance, an amputation of the leg, immediately ſeize the muſcles upon their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing divided before any needle can be uſed. And we know by experience they will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue ſome time after the irritating cauſe is removed, in proportion as the nerves were more or leſs affected<note n="*" place="bottom">See Whytt on vital and invol. Mot. p. 20 and 242.</note>. That a ſimilar effect
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0153202200:34"/>will be produced by the other cauſes aſſigned, there is reaſon to conclude from obſerving, that even the muſcles of animals, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately after death, are thrown into ſpaſms by being expoſed to the cold air; and ſpaſms are alſo often brought on by touching naked wounds with dry lint.</p>
               <p>Beſides, ſpaſms follow thoſe amputations juſt in the ſame manner, where the veſſels are not tied<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. Tranſ. vol. xlviii. part 2. p. 591.</note>; nor can the abſence of this ſymptom with juſtice be aſcribed to the omiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the ligature in amputations of the breaſts<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 596.</note>, becauſe in this caſe the muſcles, which are the ſeat of ſpaſms, are ſeldom touched with the needle; the cellular and adipoſe membrane only being taken in with the veſſel, and which, from their ſmall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of ſenſibility, give but little uneaſineſs: and out of many inſtances I do not remember any patient attended with <hi>troubleſome</hi> ſpaſms after this operation, though the needle and ligature were always uſed.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0153202200:35"/>
               <p>Another objection to the ligature is, <q>"that it increaſes the ſymptomatic fever, becauſe its application gives violent pain:"</q> but though it often gives ſmart pain for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, it does not follow that it aggravates the ſymptomatic fever, for the pain is only mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary, and whatever is included in the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gature immediately becomes ſo inſenſible, as to give no future diſturbance. It is true, an inflammation will take place above the ſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; but as an inflammation of equal degree would probably have occurred, though the ligature was not uſed, very little difference of pain can ariſe from this cauſe, as is evinced by the ſymptoms following an operation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing much the ſame, whether we uſe many ligatures or few.</p>
               <p>But the ſymptomatic fever ſeems not to ariſe from the pain which accompanies or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately follows any part of the operation, but to the diſtenſion which is cauſed by the obſtruction and inflammation that comes on ſome time after in conſequence of the diviſion of the parts; for that pain which ariſes from the nerves being irritated and diſordered in
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0153202200:36"/>the operation, preſently goes off, the irritating cauſe being inſtantly removed. And does not the ſymptomatic fever gradually come on, a few hours after the operation, as the parts about the wound begin to ſwell, and again decline as the diſtenſion abates, from the lymphatic veſſels freely tranſmitting their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents?</p>
               <p>Beſides, from the account given us of the ſymptomatic fever following an amputation of the leg, where the ligature was omitted, we ſee<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. Tranſ. vol. xlviii. part 2. p. 591. or Mr. Warner's Caſes, caſe 29.</note> it came on about the uſual time, and ſeems to have been nearly the ſame as when it is uſed. And though the symptomatic fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver has been ſlight in amputations of the breaſts<note n="†" place="bottom">Ibid.</note>, where the veſſels were not tied, yet it does not appear to be a proof that it is increaſed by the uſe of the ligature, becauſe in this operation the ſymptomatic fever is for the moſt part, if not always, ſlight; for the fat in the cellular membrane eaſily melts down, and the reticular or membranous part
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0153202200:37"/>ſends out new fleſh without giving much diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbance, and in this caſe theſe, with the ſkin, are the only parts wounded; for even when a ſchirrus adheres, it is ſeparated from the pectoral muſcle without doing much in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, as this operation, I imagine, is never practiſed when the adheſion is otherwiſe than ſlight.</p>
               <p>With this we ſhould remember, that the ſymptomatic fever is always ſlight where the ſolids are relaxed and weak, in conſequence of the ſmall degree of force with which the blood is carried againſt the obſtructed veſſels. And is it not therefore more likely owing to this cauſe than to the omiſſion of the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that a ſlight fever only followed in thoſe whoſe legs were amputated by Mr. Warner<note n="*" place="bottom">Loc. cit.</note>, as all theſe patients were much reduced pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the operation? And is not, in ſuch habits, the ſymptomatic fever conſtantly ſlight, though the ligature is uſed.</p>
               <p>It is alſo ſaid that abſceſſes are the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of uſing the ligature, and that it ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0153202200:38"/>remains fixed to the laſt, ſo as to retard the healing of the wound; but theſe incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies only happen when the needle is paſſed very deep, and may therefore be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a contrary practice: nor is paſſing the needle deep at all neceſſary (if the parts are ſound) as a ſmall quantity of fleſh or cellular membrane below the ſtricture will ſufficiently prevent the ligature being puſhed off by the impulſe of the blood. However I would cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt extremes; for with paſſing the needle but a very little way the veſſel ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times may not be tied, and cauſe unneceſſary trouble; if we therefore paſs the needle only a moderate depth, the ligature will always come away in due time without inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, or at leaſt it may be taken away long before the wound is healed, without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of bringing on a freſh haemorrhage: for as ſoon as digeſtion is complete, and the new fleſh begins to riſe, the ligature makes not any preſſure upon the veſſel; and though new fleſh may have covered the nooſe, yet if we take the advice long ſince given by Monro<note n="*" place="bottom">Ed. Med. Eſſ. vol. iv. p. 275.</note>,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0153202200:39"/>it may be removed without any hazard of cutting the artery.</p>
               <p>This is the light in which I have been led to conſider the uſe and abuſe of the needle and ligature in tying the blood veſſels, and ſhall now proceed to enquire into the method of ſuppreſſing the haemorrhage by fungous ſubſtances; which, like the ligature, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have their advantage and inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience.</p>

               <p>THE late ſucceſs which has attended the application of fungous ſubſtances is a full proof that an haemorrhage from large ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries may often be effectually ſuppreſſed by their uſe; and it at the ſame time points out the truth of the doctrine advanced, and what little aſſiſtance in this caſe is wanting.</p>
               <p>But the manner of applying funguſes makes a material difference in regard to ſucceſs; for if they are preſſed cloſe againſt the end of the veſſel, they intercept the paſſage of the blood; and the artery cloſes itſelf up in the manner deſcribed: whereas, when this circumſtance is not obſerved, and they are only laid near to the orifice, in the manner Cheſelden<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. Tranſ. N<hi rend="sup">o</hi> 478. p. 33.</note> uſed
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0153202200:41" rendition="simple:additions"/>ſpunge, they ſuppreſs the haemorrhage by choaking up the mouth of the veſſel with coagulated blood, which hinders its being cloſed; and though it ſtops the bleeding at preſent, yet it may be the ſource of a future haemorrhage.</p>
               <p>This is evident from the experiments made by La Foſs<note n="*" place="bottom">Philoſ. Tranſ. vol. xlix. part. art. 10 &amp; 11.</note>, where the coagulated blood, which filled the end of the artery, was formed into a cone with its apex towards the heart; conſequently, if the plug happens to extend to the next collateral branch, a freſh flux of blood muſt enſue upon its coming away; for it does not unite with the veſſel, as ſome have imagined.</p>
               <p>I know there are inſtances, where an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice made in an artery has been ſtopped with a clot of ſolid blood, which adhering firmly to the cicatrix of the integuments, produced a conſiderable calloſity, and which ſeems to have given riſe to this opinion. But it muſt be obſerved in theſe caſes, the wound was

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0153202200:44" rendition="simple:additions"/>without coming to ſuppuration; whereas when the air has free acceſs, we well know a putrefaction of the coagulated blood, as well as digeſtion, is always the conſequence; and I make no doubt but the ſeparation of coa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulated blood is one cauſe why a freſh bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has ſometimes come on after the inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation was abated, and matter began to be freely diſcharged. In a very late inſtance, where the bleeding from a divided artery had been ſuppreſſed by coagulated blood, I ſaw it renewed again next day by taking this blood away; the artery bleeding in the ſame manner as when it was firſt opened; but upon preſſing it betwixt my fingers it was ſoon effectually cloſed. Hence we may obſerve, that the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of laying allum, or any thing elſe, at the end of the artery to coagulate the blood, is very improper, as every impediment to the contraction of the veſſel ſhould on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary be removed.</p>
               <p>This leads me to take notice of Petit's opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, who imagined that the haemorrhage from divided arteries was always ſuppreſſed by plugs of blood within the veſſel; becauſe
<pb facs="tcp:0153202200:45" rendition="simple:additions"/>

                  <pb n="37" facs="tcp:0153202200:48"/>he found in ſome of them, after the death of the patient, coagulated blood, which extended itſelf upwards a conſiderable way.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding this, it is very proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the haemorrhage was ſtopped by the natural contraction of the veſſel; for we find in the two waggoners mentioned by Monſ. Fagot<note n="*" place="bottom">Philoſ. Tranſ. for 1753; or Mr. Warner's Caſes, p. 136.</note> where, after death, coagulated blood was found in the ſame manner, <q>"their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities were contracted and ſtraitened, as if they had been tied."</q> And in the many experiments I have made on this occaſion, I never found coagulated blood but once; and then the extremity of the artery was cloſe contracted<note n="†" place="bottom">It was in the artery of a large dog which was ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled.—The horſes, &amp;c. were killed by being bled to death in the uſual manner, which ſeems to prove that the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agula are not formed while the blood circulates regularly, but when the animal is near dying, or immediately after death.</note>.</p>
               <p>Pouteau<note n="†" place="bottom">Melanges des Chirurg. p. 314.</note> opened ſeveral arteries, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found any coagulum; nor is there any
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0153202200:49"/>coagulum found in the umbilical veſſels of children after death: from all which may we not conclude, that this circumſtance is merely accidental, and no ſtep taken by nature, who is always uniform, if no impediment, is in the way? Indeed, I think with ſome other writers,<note n="†" place="bottom">Gouch, Pouteau.</note> that it is of the ſame kind, and produced in the ſame manner as the fibrous blood we often find in the great arteries near the heart: that which I ſaw had exactly the ſame appearance; nor did it ſeem ſufficient to have blocked up the veſſel. What is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſaid about coagulated blood preventing the contraction of the veſſel, here alſo takes place; and was it extended to the extremity of the artery, putrefaction and its conſequences muſt of courſe enſue, from its being in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact with the air.</p>
               <p>It follows then, that whatever fungus is uſed, it ſhould be preſſed cloſe to the end of the veſſel; and that kind which adheres clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt ſhould be choſen. Mr. White ſays<note n="†" place="bottom">Loc. cit.</note> that ſpunge is on this account preferable; and if
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0153202200:50"/>his directions, in regard to the choice, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, and manner of applying it, be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, I believe he ſays true; but even this ſticks the faſteſt when it is leaſt wanted; for though after a while it adheres ſo firm, that it is removed with difficulty, yet, till the parts begin to ſwell and become moiſt, the adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is very ſlight.</p>
               <p>Bandage therefore muſt be carefully applied to preſerve it in its proper ſituation; and if this circumſtance had been duly attended to, inſtead of relying upon a ſpecific property in agaric, better ſucceſs would probably have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it when in vogue; for where agaric itſelf proved ineffectual, tight bandage and common dreſſings ſuppreſſed the haemorrhage. And we might produce innumerable inſtances which prove, that whatever is kept firm upon the end of the veſſel is ſufficient for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. —However, if what is ſaid about tying the great arteries be true, moſt ſurgeons, I imagine, will ſtill ſecure them with the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for no ſort of bandage can with ſafety in amputations be ſo applied, but the fungus may ſometimes be diſplaced by ſpaſms, cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0153202200:51"/>vomiting, or the like: and ſhould an hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage return from theſe veſſels, we know death may enſue from the loſs of no very large quantity of blood. Mr. Sharp's<note n="†" place="bottom">Phil. Tranſ. vol. xlviii. part 2. art. 78.</note> pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, in whom the veſſels burſt open three hours and half after he had applied agaric, died in about twenty minutes with the loſs of leſs than thirty ounces of blood, including what was loſt in the operation: nor could aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance be ſpeedy enough to prevent this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophe, though it was upon the ſpot when the haemorrhage returned; and how much more likely is this to be the caſe in private practice, eſpecially in the country, where the perſon obliged to be intruſted with our pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient is often an intire ſtranger to chirurgical operations?</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe our aſſiſtant ſhould be ſo lucky as to compreſs the tourniquet time enough to ſave the patient's life, yet it is probable a quantity of blood will often be loſt, that may be injurious to him; for though the loſs of ſome blood from this accident may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable, when the patient is not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0153202200:52"/>by the diſeaſe<note n="†" place="bottom">See Mr. Warner's Caſes, caſe 44.</note>; on the other hand, the loſs of a few ounces, when he is become weak, will be very improper, and very likely retard the recovery of his health: and we may obſerve, even in ſtrong habits, that the diſcharge of blood ought not to be commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to chance, but intirely directed by the judgment of the ſurgeon. And though it ſhould happen that very little blood is loſt, the patient may not only undergo great pain from the compreſſure, till the ſurgeon can be called, perhaps from a conſiderable diſtance, but the parts may be much injured by the fluids being ſo long in a ſtate of ſtagnation.</p>
               <p>But this inconvenience will for the moſt part attend the uſe of this remedy in ampu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the limbs; for all agree that it is neceſſary to keep the limb compreſſed a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable time with the tourniquet, and which will alſo in all probability overbalance the pain cauſed in uſing the needle and ligature. Nor can we help thinking but ſome miſtake hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0153202200:53"/>in deſcribing thoſe caſes, where we are told, though the tourniquet was kept compreſſed for half an hour, that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient was remarkably eaſy during that time. Mr. Sharp's<note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. Tranſ. vol. xlviii. part 2. art. 78.</note> patient, when he uſed agaric, complained <hi>grievouſly</hi> of pain ariſing from the tourniquet; and my patients tell me, it is the worſt part of the operation: beſides, I have obſerved when a piece of fungus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heres cloſe, it gives very conſiderable pain in being removed; ſo that upon the whole, this method of ſecuring the great veſſels is attended with more pain and leſs ſafety, than the liga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture when properly applied.</p>
               <p>This reaſoning alſo holds good in regard to the leſſer arteries, when they are ſurrounded with the cellular or adipoſe membrane only; though it cannot be extended to the tying of thoſe which are ſituated amongſt the muſcles, becauſe, as is already obſerved, the ligature is here attended with conſiderable pain; nor is the tourniquet in this caſe wanted; and I make no doubt, but theſe veſſels may in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0153202200:54"/>be truſted with ſpunge, or any thing elſe that adheres cloſe to their extremities: but the ſpunge ſhould be removed the firſt or ſecond dreſſing, otherwiſe the new fleſh grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into its pores will cauſe an increaſe of pain in the removal.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, if the bleeding ſhould happen to return, though on account of the ſize of the veſſels it might not be dangerous, yet even here more blood might be diſcharged than it would be prudent to loſe; a freſh hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhage is always alarming to the patient; and as momentary pain ſeems to be the only inconvenience, perhaps many ſurgeons will think it beſt to leave their patients in perfect ſecurity: and we may juſt obſerve, that in many operations the ligature muſt of courſe be uſed upon all the veſſels, as it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſtop the bleeding as we go on.</p>
               <p>Nevertheleſs, when the fleſh is become ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and gives way to the ligature, ſpunge ſeems to be the beſt remedy; for though the large veſſels might be pulled out, and tied in
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:0153202200:55"/>the manner Dionis<note n="*" place="bottom">He deſcribes different methods, but that is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to, where the thread is paſſed through the end of the veſſel to prevent its being puſhed off by the impulſe of the blood. See chap. on Amputation.</note> deſcribes, yet, being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>defended, the end would commonly ſeparate; and unleſs the ligature was placed near its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, ſometimes bring on a freſh haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage in the manner already obſerved. And this was moſt probably the reaſon why Parey had more certain ſucceſs, when he took in, along with the veſſel, ſome of the adjacent parts, than when he incloſed it alone in the ligature.</p>
               <p>Where the veſſels are ſo deeply ſituated as not to be come at with the needle, the ſame kind of application muſt have preference, if it can be laid cloſe to the mouth of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; and it ſucceeds better in this caſe, as the ſides of the wound aſſiſt in keeping it in its proper ſituation: but before it is applied, it ſeems neceſſary to examine whether the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery is wholly divided; for without this cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we may ſometimes be diſappointed in our expectation, and aſcribe inſufficiency to
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0153202200:56"/>this method, as was done to the agaric<note n="†" place="bottom">See Neal on Agaric, p. 35.</note>, when the want of ſucceſs was owing to the veſſel being in part divided, whence it was incapable of intercepting the paſſage of the blood. Nor ſhould we forget, that in wounds which admit of cure by an immediate union of their divided parts, fungous ſubſtances are unneceſſary, as the common method of dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effectually ſuppreſſes the bleeding, though it is from conſiderable arteries.</p>
               <p>However, if the artery is large, and any difficulty occurs, if the part will admit of the practice of dilating the wound, perhaps it may ſeem more proper by that means to uſe the ligature, eſpecially if it adheres to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>divided muſcle or the bone, and bandage can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conveniently applied; and where the principal trunk of a large artery is wounded in a longitudinal direction, Mr. Lambert's<note n="†" place="bottom">Med. Inq. vol. ii. p. 360.</note> method of ſewing it up ſhould, I think, be tried.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:0153202200:57"/>
               <p>When an haemorrhage ariſes from a thin ſtate of the blood, and the diſcharge is from the whole ſurface of the wound, <hi>puff ball</hi> ſeems preferable to ſpunge, or the like, as the blood would probably eſcape through its pores. In this caſe, with tight bandage it has an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered my purpoſe, till internal medicines had their proper effect: and if upon trial it ſhould prove ſucceſsful under the like circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, will it not be more proper than <hi>ſtyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics</hi> or <hi>aſtringents,</hi> &amp;c. as theſe harden the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres, and prevent digeſtion, from which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience this remedy is free? Nor do I apprehend the bandage will be ſo unartfully applied, as to bring on a flux of blood by compreſſing the veins, as I imagine in general this obvious cauſe of an haemorrhage is well underſtood, being pointed out by ſeveral wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on ſurgery, and clearly demonſtrated by Monro<note n="*" place="bottom">Ed. Med. Eſſ. vol. iv. p. 271.</note>.</p>
               <p>Perhaps ſome will think that ſtyptics and aſtringents will forward the contraction of the veſſels: but we may learn how little they
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0153202200:58"/>are wanted, from the artery in the young fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's arm, which was evidently relaxed and weak, cloſing itſelf without any aſſiſtance; and I am perſuaded, from ſome experiments I have made, that theſe applications, inſtead of aſſiſting, would, if they were not hindered by mixing with the blood in wounds, rather prevent the collapſing of the veſſel by hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its fibres. And however contrary this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine may be to the generally received opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, experience is certainly in its favour; for though by coagulating the blood, they might ſucceed upon very ſmall arteries, yet, being applied to thoſe which were large, they were always found inſufficient to ſuppreſs the bleeding, unleſs tight bandage was at the ſame time uſed, and to which I think it is clear the ſucceſs was owing: for many of theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, which were thought to be aſtrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, had certainly no other property as blood-ſtaunchers than that of choaking up the mouths of the veſſels<note n="*" place="bottom">See Parey, p. 328. Hildanus, p. 812. Clow's Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, p. 27.</note>.</p>
               <pb n="48" facs="tcp:0153202200:59"/>
               <p>It is obvious that the fungus, when uſed, muſt be kept in its proper ſituation by ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage differently applied, according to the part wounded; and in this matter every ſurgeon's own judgment will beſt direct him. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we may juſt obſerve, that in amputations good ſlicking plaiſter, as adviſed by Mr. White<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay on Spunge.</note>, and keeping the hand preſſed harder againſt the part for a few hours, may often be ſuffcient; though the machine recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by Mr. Gooch<note n="†" place="bottom">Caſes, p. 131 and 141.</note> will, probably, be more certain; and when this is not at hand, a circular piece of leather may be made to anſwer nearly the ſame purpoſe.</p>
               <p>This piece of leather muſt be large enough to cover the end of the ſtump, and near its edge muſt be cut four ſlits in oppoſite direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that will admit each a fillet.—Suppoſing a leg taken off below the knee, two fillets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſed through theſe ſlits croſſways, and under a roller or a piece of cloth that goes round the thigh, above the knee, muſt be
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0153202200:60"/>brought back again, and tied upon the end of the ſtump, by which means the dreſſings will be fixed, and any degree of preſſure may be made: and this bandage, if it is kept from ſlipping down, by being faſtened with filleting to a roller round the waiſt, ſerves equally well when we amputate above the knee. Nor do I recommend this method without experience; for having amputated a leg, where the blood was extremely poor, and the fleſh very tender, the ligatures were forced off the veſſels a few hours after the operation, by a fit of cough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and vomiting; I immediately applied the bandage above-mentioned, with bolſters of dry lint, which effectually anſwered the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: for, though the patient vomited and coughed ſeveral times afterwards, the haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage did not return.</p>
               <p>Indeed bandage ſeems hitherto to have proved leſs ſerviceable than it might have been, merely from imagining it would be uſeleſs, unleſs the ſides of the veſſels were brought together in cloſe contact; whereas, had the preſſure been made only upon the end of the veſſel, and juſt ſufficient to reſiſt; the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0153202200:61"/>of the blood, it might much oftener have been uſed without inconvenience, and with better ſucceſs, as there is reaſon to think from many inſtances.</p>
               <p>We have only further to add on this head, that where the wounded artery cannot be come at, preſſure is ſtill the only remedy; and where things are ſo circumſtanced that we are obliged to choak up the mouths of the veſſels with coagulated blood, it ſeems neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for reaſons already given, to make a preſſure, if it can be done, againſt the end of the artery, that the contraction beyond the plug may more certainly take place.</p>

               <p>BESIDES the methods above-mentioned, Mr. Warner<note n="*" place="bottom">Caſes, p. 38.</note> has ſhewn, that when an artery is opened in the roof of the mouth, the actual cautery is ſometimes neceſſary to ſtop the bleeding: and many years ago, after ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpating a tumor from this part, I was obliged, for the ſame reaſons, to have recourſe to the ſame remedy; but the iron was no hotter than juſt ſufficient to form the neighbouring parts into an eſchar upon the end of the artery; by which means the courſe of the blood was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted, and the veſſel left at liberty to cloſe itſelf up; whereas when the cautery is very hot, it not only burns the end of the artery a conſiderable way, but hardening its fibres beyond the eſchar, renders it incapable of col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſing; ſo that it is no wonder an haemor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhage
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:0153202200:64"/>ſhould ſo often enſue upon the ſepira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the dead parts.</p>
               <p>However, the cautery is at all times a cruel application, and ſhould be avoided, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: nor do I now call to mind any other part where its uſe can be wanted. But if this is cruel, the potential cautery is more ſo, as it ſpreads itſelf further into the neighbouring parts; and yet it is not very uncommon for ſurgeons in performing operations to apply lint ſoaked in ſcalding oil of turpentine, where the artery, though not very large, cannot be readily come at: and this piece of cruelty is ſtill aggravated, when we conſider that a few minutes preſſure would, in all probability, have alone <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
