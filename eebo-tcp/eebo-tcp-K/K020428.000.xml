            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>THE moſt certain and effectual mode of ſecuring peace, right, and mutual protection, for any community, is the old Engliſh ſyſtem of mutual <hi>Frankpledge,</hi> or <hi>free ſuretyſhip,</hi> given by all <hi>the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holders,</hi> for themſelves and each other, in exact numerical diviſions of <hi>tens</hi> and hundreds; which, in the Engliſh law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>books, is called <hi>"Maxima ſecuritas"</hi>—<hi>"the greateſt ſecurity,"</hi> though it is now unhappily neglected, and conſequently crimes abound and increaſe; ſo that,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0940400400:3"/>notwithſtanding the horrible increaſe alſo of <hi>bloody laws</hi> to intimidate offenders, yet there is <hi>no effectual ſecurity</hi> from vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and robbery, either in our ſtreets or roads, or even in our chambers; ſince the houſes of the rich and great, nay of the firſt officers of the ſtate, are not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from the nocturnal intruſion of houſebreakers, inſomuch that even the Lord Chancellor and Honourable Speaker of the Houſe of Commons have lately experienced the common danger, and the deplorable want of the antient <hi>"Maxima ſecuritas."</hi> That funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental ſyſtem of <hi>Engliſh polity</hi> is ſo little known among us at preſent, that many well-meaning perſons are induced, by their fears, to wiſh for <hi>ſecurity,</hi> on a much leſs eligible plan, formed on the model of the arbitrary ſyſtem of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in France, commonly called <hi>police,</hi> the introduction of which would be an utter perverſion of the firſt principles of
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0940400400:4"/>
                  <hi>legal</hi> government in England.

               <p>The community of free African ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlers, however, have already adopted (as I am informed) a ſmall variation from the old Engliſh model of numerical di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, by forming themſelves into di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of <hi>dozens,</hi> inſtead of <hi>tithings</hi> or <hi>tens;</hi> but as this little change is by no means <hi>inconſiſtent</hi> with the true princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and intention of our legal Engliſh <hi>frankpledge,</hi> I am at liberty to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a moſt hearty approbation of it, as being an arrangement far more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient and effectual for ſecuring perfect ſubordination, peace, and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even than the antient legal divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions

               <p>To theſe muſt alſo be added the ſons, apprentices, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dentured ſervants of the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, viz. all the males of 16 years of age and upwards, who by the <hi>common law</hi> are required to be armed, and of courſe to be diſciplined in the uſe of arms. The average of males above 16 years of age may be ſtated, I believe, at three to each family, includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the perſons above de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed: ſo that in a few years, if the ſettlement ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, there may probably be added to the 100 armed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciners at leaſt 200 Privates or rank and file.</p>
               <p>In all 300 militia men in each hundred diviſion, a corps that may be rendered ſufficiently effectual to ſupport the executive juſtice of a free, legal government, within any extent of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0940400400:9"/>land which an <hi>hundred families</hi> can fairly occupy, and amply ſufficient to ſupply a roſter or rotation of very eaſy ſervice in the neceſſary <hi>watch</hi> and <hi>ward</hi> of the ſettlement.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0940400400:16"/>always bear an <hi>intrinſic value,</hi> without diminution, as hereafter explained under the head of <hi>Publick Revenue.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The daily commencement of publick labour and of hired labour, and all the neceſſary ceſſations from labour for reſt and refreſhment, ſhould be limited to ſtated periods of time, rendered uniform and general, throughout the ſettlement, by the periodical ſummons of a publick bell, as in our <hi>dock yards</hi> and great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactories, for the more effectual pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of impoſition by the employer or employed.</p>
               <p>By the limitation of labour to eight hours per day, the rateable or legal days work (inſtead of continuing from ſix in the morning to ſix in the evening, as with us) will end at four in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, including two whole hours for neceſſary refreſhment and reſt; unleſs it
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0940400400:17"/>ſhould be thought more convenient in general to begin at five in the morning, and to work three hours till eight, and then, after reſting half an hour at break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, to work three hours and an half more till noon, when a moderate and temperate meal, ſuitable to the heat of the climate, may be rendered more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing and healthful to the labourer by a <hi>general ſeſtoo,</hi> or ſleeping time, during the meridean heat till half paſt one; which reſt of one hour and an half, at one time, will be amply ſufficient to recruit them for the remaining burthen of the rateable labour, or legal day's work, viz. one hour and an half more, ending at three o'clock in the afternoon, when the <hi>evening</hi> of the antients com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, and the appointed hour of <hi>even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifice</hi> in the patriarchal times. If, therefore, the new ſociety would agree to aſſemble at <hi>that hour,</hi> in whatever place they ſhall afterwards appropriate
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0940400400:18"/>to religious worſhip, and there join toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a very ſhort <hi>general form of prayer and evening ſacrifice of thanks</hi> (in which, to remove all objections about the value of time, they need not be detained much longer than about five minutes, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs all that may be abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for every good purpoſe of prayer and thankſgiving, at leaſt as a <hi>daily</hi> ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice) they will ſoon be convinced that no human meaſure is ſo well calculated to add real dignity to the ordinary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer, as well with reſpect to his own <hi>internal</hi> improvement, as in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eſteem and conſideration which it will neceſſarily inſure to him from others, by continually reminding the rich and higher ranks of men that the daily la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourer is their brother and their <hi>equal</hi> in the ſight of God, and that all men ought to be <hi>equally</hi> ſervants to <hi>the ſame Lord!</hi> I could wiſh that a ſhort daily morning prayer might alſo be adopted at

               <p>As ſome of the <hi>out lots</hi> will be diſtant about two miles from the centre of the townſhip, it may perhaps be more expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to commence the rateable daily labour even half an hour ſooner ſtill, than I have laſt propoſed, viz. at half paſt four in the cool of the morning, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by all <hi>publick labour</hi> will end at half paſt two in the afternoon, which will allow time for labourers in the diſtant lots to repair to the general aſſembly of the townſhip, at <hi>evening prayer.</hi> And an officer from every dozen may be ordered to be prepared, by a previous examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the publick bank of all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents in courſe for each day's labour; that after being diſcharged in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick books, they may be cancelled, and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0940400400:20"/>moſt expeditiouſly returned to thoſe who have fulfilled them; all which, by the happy ſyſtem of <hi>Frankpledge,</hi> may be moſt eaſily effected with very little loſs of time; ſo that the labourers may return from the centre of the townſhip to their own private lots, and have near five hours of leiſure to themſelves to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate their own land, even if they work no later than eight at night, which will allow them ample time for reſt, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as the mid-day <hi>ſeſtoo</hi> will render leſs ſleep neceſſary at night.</p>

And if the <hi>voluntary labour of a man</hi> ſhould really be worth three times what I have eſtimated (as I really believe it is) the profit for redemption, for 11l. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed, will amount to 105l. 5s. which is 956 9/11l. per cent. in favour of the

               <p>As <hi>Labour</hi> in all new ſettlements where land is cheap, is, of courſe, much higher and more valuable than in old eſtabliſhed ſtates, the intrinſic value of the labour, in the propoſed new ſettlement, might fairly be eſtimated <hi>at double the price</hi> of labour in England; but at preſent I will rate it only at <hi>one ſhilling per day,</hi> on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the limitation of eight hours inſtead of ten, commonly required in England. About 300 males have already entered their names; which number multiplied by ſixty-two, the tax of days work due from each per annum, by this regulation, will produce 18,600 days of labour in a year, due to the publick; which, eſtimated at the low average rate of only 1s. per day, will amount to 930l.
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0940400400:66"/>per annum. And as the value or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of labour, when applied <hi>to land,</hi> (at the ordinary eſtimation of increaſe by the products of the earth in return for labour and care) is expected to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce <hi>at leaſt triple the amount</hi> of the diſburſement, even in our northern cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, ſo the value of 930l. beſtowed in labour on the publick lots of land in the fertile and productive climate of Africa, where very little labour is neceſſary, might certainly be eſtimated much higher: but even at the ordinary rate it will amount to 2790l. per annum, which is a very great publick revenue, if it be remembered that it is calculated on the very ſmall number of 300 males, reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich and poor together, which are only the ordinary average number of males in an <hi>hundred diviſion,</hi> or 100 families of a well eſtabliſhed ſettlement, at the rate of three males to a family!</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:0940400400:67"/>The general contribution, which I have propoſed, is <hi>equally</hi> laid on the poor as on the rich, the former being <hi>equally</hi> capable of paying it, and that certainly with more eaſe to themſelves, by being accuſtomed to <hi>ordinary labour.</hi> Nevertheleſs the rich (it may be ſaid) ought to contribute more than the poor, on account of the ſuperior advantages which accrue to them by their aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the poor in one well regulated political body. The ſuperior advantages I ſpeak of are—1ſt, The <hi>perſonal eaſe</hi> or exemption from labour, which their riches may always procure to them in ſuch a ſociety—and ſecondly the effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſecurity of their property, or wealth, <hi>procured in Frankpledge,</hi> or <hi>"Maxima ſecuritas,"</hi> by the equal exertion of perſons, who have <hi>no property,</hi> and by an <hi>equal</hi> riſque, alſo <hi>of their lives,</hi> in caſe of actual danger. So that it ſeems clearly reaſonable and juſt, that the rich
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0940400400:68"/>and higher ranks of citizens ſhould contribute <hi>more to the publick revenue,</hi> than the poor;—but in what proportion is rather difficult to determine; though it may be readily anſwered, that the quantity of riches ſhould, in due pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, determine the quantity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution; yet this cannot be done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a general <hi>tax on property,</hi> which, as experience teaches us, is liable to many inconveniences; ſo that even the antient and ordinary tax of <hi>tithes</hi> to the clergy is deemed grievouſly inconvenient, on account of the difficulties, diſputes, quarrels, and vexations, which too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happen, as well in compound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them as in the collection of them <hi>in kind.</hi> The only expedient, therefore, which I am able to deviſe, at preſent, for procuring a larger contribution from the rich, is a <hi>tax on pride and indolence;</hi> a tax which, though it will not produce in exact proportion to the property of
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0940400400:69"/>the wealthy, will nevertheleſs moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly obtain from the wealthy and luxurious a contribution exactly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionate to whatever <hi>pride and indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence</hi> may be occaſioned by the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous wealth of the community: and in aid to this tax on <hi>ſuperfluous wealth,</hi> the <hi>affluence</hi> likewiſe of the more uſeful members of ſociety, whoſe employments procure them a more profitable reward than they could obtain by ordinary la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, might be made to yield a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able addition to the revenue in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their ſuperior abilities to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute, which men of this reſpectable claſs certainly have.</p>

<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0940400400:78"/>work,</hi> either for <hi>circulation,</hi> as ready caſh, or for <hi>labourers,</hi> to cultivate his own lot of land, or elſe occaſionally to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate planters who want labourers, and are willing to pay the value of them, in <hi>produce,</hi> &amp;c. whereby <hi>private credit</hi> (as well as <hi>public credit,</hi> already provided for) will be amply ſupported: and the indentures for <hi>labour,</hi> by which this moſt eſſential <hi>public</hi> and <hi>private</hi> ſervice is effected, will be, in fact, A PAPER CURRENCY OF INTRINSIC VALUE, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering all the purpoſes of <hi>ready caſh,</hi> as a medium of traffic, as well as all the neceſſary purpoſes of <hi>negociable bills,</hi> to ſupport <hi>public</hi> and <hi>private</hi> credit; and yet they cannot be, at all, liable to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation!</p>
               <p>The advantages appear to me ſo great and extraordinary, that I can hardly give credit, as I proceed, to my own eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them; and am inclined to ſuſpect
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:0940400400:79"/>that I am, in ſome way or other, <hi>enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly miſtaken;</hi> but as I cannot yet find out my error, I muſt leave my cenſure to ſome more able head. A few obvious objections, however, I am prepared to remove by a timely propoſal of adequate remedies. As for inſtance—Whatever might be deemed troubleſome, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable, in exacting the payment of theſe <hi>debts of labour,</hi> may be effectually withdrawn <hi>from individuals,</hi> by inveſting the <hi>public bank of each townſhip</hi> with the ſole authority of demanding the <hi>labour</hi> for the indentures, that have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively entered and certified therein. And that the ſeveral banks may be enabled to realize the value of theſe indentures, all applications either for <hi>labourers,</hi> or <hi>labour,</hi> ſhall be made at the ſeveral <hi>town banks;</hi> where planters may be ſure of a ſupply of labourers, and the labourer equally ſure of a conſtant ſupply of work, without danger of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0940400400:80"/>or non payment of wages, being ſecured from both by the media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the bank, which employs him, and diſpoſes of his ſervice. And both parties, or at leaſt the <hi>planters,</hi> ought to pay ſome ſmall allowance per cent. to the bank, by way of commiſſion, or profit for the negociation. And each bank ſhould regularly ſummon, (with <hi>due previous notice</hi> for every day) a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient number of the indentured la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers that are entered on their books, not only to cultivate <hi>the public lots of land</hi> under their care, but alſo to ſupply the current daily demand of labour that may be wanted by planters and other private individuals; but all perſons ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned to labour, ſhall work on the <hi>public lots,</hi> until ſuch demands are made, by which means <hi>the labourers will loſe no time in waiting for work.</hi> The daily ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſes to labour, iſſued from the bank, ſhould be made <hi>in due rotation, according
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0940400400:81"/>to the dates of the indentures entered on the books,</hi> and according to the quantity of debt which each individual has to work out. And, that no man may run deeper in debt, by diſpoſing of his labour to a greater amount than he may be able to diſcharge in due time, all indentures whatſoever for the labour either of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prentices or ſervants, ſhould be entered at the bank of the townſhip, where the parties reſide, whereby not only the ſtate of every labourer's debt may be always known, and, of courſe, likewiſe his ability to diſcharge it, but alſo, on the other hand, the labourers, apprentices, and ſervants themſelves, will be thereby more eaſily protected from the oppreſſion of ſuch avaritious maſters, as might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be inclined to exact more ſervice than is due by the terms of their contract.</p>
               <p>If any perſon ſhould die before his indentured ſervice is diſcharged to the
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0940400400:82"/>
                  <hi>public</hi> bank, his land, ſtock, and effects ſhall be anſwerable to the amount of his deficiency to the <hi>publick,</hi> in preference to all other debts: whereby the <hi>paper currency,</hi> will always preſerve a <hi>ſtandard value;</hi> and, at the ſame time, afford a moſt convenient medium for traffic and exchange. If any further difficulties, more than I have foreſeen and guarded againſt, ſhould ſtill be objected, I flatter myſelf that the ſalutary eſtabliſhment of Frankpledge will be ſufficient to obviate them all. For this <hi>maxima ſecuritas,</hi> renders every individual completely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſible for all debts or demands that can juſtly be made upon him, and for all charges againſt him whatever, becauſe the reſidence of the meaneſt member of ſociety can be moſt expeditiouſly known by the public books; ſo that he may be immediately traced at any time to his very chamber, and no individual in <hi>Frankpledge</hi> can reſiſt the united power
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0940400400:83"/>of a free people—for if any one ſhould neglect or deſpiſe the ſummons of the public bank, his <hi>tithing</hi> or dozen may be compelled (on the penalty of a heavy fine for neglect) to produce him: and ſhould the tithing or dozen neglect, the hundred is ſummoned to enforce ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and ſo on with reſpect to higher diviſions, until the ſtrength of the whole community is united, as one man, to render executive juſtice, to <hi>fine,</hi> or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe puniſh all contumacious delinquents againſt common ſenſe, and to enforce obedience to the determined juſtice of the majority. This occaſional mention of <hi>miſdemeanors</hi> and <hi>fines,</hi> reminds me that I have omitted to add to the amount of my calculation of <hi>Revenue,</hi> the profit of the <hi>public fines</hi> and <hi>forfeitures,</hi> which muſt always be very conſiderable where <hi>Frankpledge</hi> is eſtabliſhed; not only, becauſe the regularity and order of the ſyſtem renders the levying of <hi>fines</hi> and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0940400400:84"/>
                  <hi>forfeitures</hi> extremely eaſy, expeditious, and free from expence, but alſo, becauſe the penalties of <hi>fines</hi> and <hi>forfeitures</hi> are, in Frankpledge, extended to the <hi>minuteſt immoralities,</hi> and <hi>negligences,</hi> in order to render the peace and regularity of ſociety as perfect as poſſible. Add to this a very particular advantage, which the ancient mode of puniſhing by <hi>fines</hi> and <hi>forfeitures,</hi> will acquire by the applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my propoſal of univerſal calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>days labour</hi>—an advantage which could never before be obtained; viz. that the <hi>pooreſt man</hi> has, thereby, <hi>ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to forfeit,</hi> even ſometimes very conſiderable, becauſe his <hi>perſonal labour</hi> is <hi>equally valuable,</hi> and probably <hi>more ſo,</hi> than the labour of a man of ſuperior rank; ſo that even the happy ſyſtem of <hi>Frankpledge itſelf</hi> is very materially im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, and rendered much <hi>more effectual,</hi> as well as more <hi>profitable,</hi> by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed addition.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:0940400400:85"/>All contempts of legal ſummonſes to <hi>labour,</hi> would, of courſe, be <hi>finable;</hi> as alſo <hi>apparent ſloth,</hi> or <hi>remiſſneſs in work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;</hi> both of which would thereby be made <hi>effectual to increaſe the value of the paper currency,</hi> inſtead of diminiſhing it, as might be expected. Likewiſe all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of court, neglects of ſummons to attend juries; want of punctuality in attending the duties of Watch and Ward, in the rotation of the public roſter; and all inattention or diſobedience while on duty; all breaches of the ſabbath, ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, drunkenneſs, and immodeſty, as well as <hi>fornication</hi> and <hi>adultery</hi> (both of which ſhould be very ſtrictly, and very ſeverely mulcted, for the more effectual promotion of <hi>honourable marriage</hi>) giving or accepting a challenge to fight, even though no miſchief ſhould enſue; all unneceſſary wrangling, fighting, or ſtriking, and even every wilful provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by word or geſture, and every other
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0940400400:86"/>miſbehaviour that is inconſiſtent with the peace, order, and quiet of a happy ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, would be puniſhed by a ſuitable <hi>fine of days' work,</hi> in proportion to the offence, by which altogether this eſſential article of <hi>fines</hi> and <hi>forfeitures</hi> (which, in England, through <hi>neglect of Frankpledge,</hi> are hardly an object of conſideration) would neceſſarily occaſion a much larger addition to the <hi>public revenue</hi> than I can venture, at preſent, to eſtimate; and, therefore, I muſt beg leave to <hi>reſerve</hi> this valuable article of <hi>fines,</hi> to make up any deficiencies, which, perhaps, may be afterwards diſcovered in my other cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations; to which muſt alſo be added, as a further reſerve, the profits ariſing from the <hi>ſale of land</hi> for <hi>day labour,</hi> not yet eſtimated, though it would probably amount even to more than the fines.</p>
               <p>I have already, without theſe profitable articles, carried my eſtimation of the
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0940400400:87"/>
                  <hi>public Revenue</hi> nearly to the amount of 4000l. per annum, for every 100 families, including equally both rich and poor, which far exceeds the proportionable revenue, I believe, of any kingdom on earth; for indeed, the ſame means are <hi>not practicable</hi> in any country or nation, unleſs the moſt excellent ſyſtem of <hi>Frankpledge</hi> be previouſly eſtabliſhed, which I muſt frequently repeat. But, for the ſake of compariſon, let us apply this ſcheme to the computed average number of taxable houſes or families in England and Wales. The one million families (as they are commonly eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated) would raiſe, by merely taking on themſelves the very moderate and equal burthen of only a 5th part of their <hi>moſt ordinary</hi> labour, eſtimated at the low rate of one ſhilling per day, together with the additional <hi>tax on pride,</hi> and the eaſy levy <hi>on profitable occupations,</hi> with the due increaſe of the whole profit, when applied
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0940400400:88"/>to <hi>the cultivation of public land,</hi> would raiſe (I ſay) at the rate of 3906l. for every hundred families, before calculated, the amazing revenue of 39 millions, and 60 thouſands of pounds ſterling, per annum. If I am queſtioned on the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of raiſing a ſum ſo enormouſly great, that it far exceeds the whole annual produce of all our accumulated taxes, cuſtoms, and other means of revenue, I muſt confeſs, that I am at a loſs how even to ſatisfy my own doubts about it; and that I know not what reaſons to aſſign for ſuch an incredible accumulation of wealth, ariſing from ſo <hi>trifling a burthen</hi> laid upon the people, unleſs it may be attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the <hi>effectual employment of all the labouring poor;</hi> and of others capable of labour, and alſo to the <hi>effectual</hi> means of which the propoſition ſeems to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of rendering that general employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>of ordinary labour</hi> profitable, not only in the circulation of the indentures
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0940400400:89"/>as <hi>bills</hi> and <hi>caſh;</hi> but alſo in the increaſe which may be naturally expected from <hi>the actual labour, when applied to the earth.</hi> But there are other advantages attending the propoſal, which are not yet reckoned.</p>
               <p>The previous re-eſtabliſhment of <hi>frankpledge,</hi> without which the raiſing of ſuch an increaſed revenue could not be practicable, would, at the ſame time, render abſolutely <hi>unneceſſary</hi> the greateſt part of our moſt expenſive eſtabliſhments both <hi>civil</hi> and <hi>military.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, upon the whole the gain might fairly be eſtimated at nearly triple the <hi>effective,</hi> or neat amount of all the other deviſeable "<hi>Ways and Means,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c."— That this is not an exaggerated ſtatement of our publick burthens, will be allowed, I believe, by all parties. I wiſh they were equally agreed in opinion about the neceſſary remedy!</p>
