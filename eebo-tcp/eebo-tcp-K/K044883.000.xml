            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
            <p>THE Thirteenth Satire of Juvenal has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways admired by the ableſt judges, not merely for its elegance and poetical ſpirit, but as a ſublime com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, containing the pureſt and moſt uſeful moral doctrine, ſuch as goes home to the breaſt and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of every man in ſociety. The Author launches out, with his uſual indignation, againſt the reigning vices of the times, and particularly FRAUD and PER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>JURY. He introduces his ſubject with an apparent intention to conſole a friend, who had depoſited a ſum of money in the hands of a man baſe enough to deny the truſt, and ſupport his fraud by a daring Perjury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0578802500:5"/>
He obſerves, in the outſet, that the guilty are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at peace; they have no reſt from their own relentleſs thoughts; and yet deceit, and treachery, and injuſtice prevail in the maſs of human life. He paints forth the vices of mankind in glaring colours; and, having by way of contraſt mentioned the times of innocence (commonly called the Golden Age), he takes occaſion to place in a ridiculous light the whole ſyſtem of the Heathen Mythology. The wit and pleaſantry, with which this part of the poem is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted, are truly beautiful: but there is reaſon to fear that the whole paſſage would now be thought an unſeaſonable digreſſion; and, for that reaſon, it was judged adviſable, in the Engliſh Poem, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute ideas drawn from modern manners.</p>
            <p>Juvenal proceeds to obſerve the intrepidity with which perjury is often committed. The fear of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0578802500:6"/>by human evidence, he ſays, is the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint: ſecure from that danger, the offender is ready, as Shakeſpeare has it, <hi>to jump the life to come.</hi> Of this depravity two cauſes are aſſigned: in the firſt place, Atheiſm; and ſecondly, even among believers, the deluſive hope of eſcaping puniſhment, or of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piating the ſin by repentance at a future day. The Poet, after this, exhibits a black liſt of crimes; and, in ſuch a general corruption of manners, exhorts his friend to appeaſe reſentment in his own particular caſe. Revenge, he ſays, is a little paſſion. He recurs to his firſt propoſition, namely, that the Perjurer, even though he may elude the hand of juſtice, is ſure to ſuffer the ſelf-condemning award of his own conſcience. He deſcribes in bold relief the horrors of a guilty mind. He traces the progreſs of vice, beginning with a petty fraud, and ruſhing on, with apparent ſucceſs, till at length ſome foul enormity
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0578802500:7"/>calls down the ſentence of the law, and gives full proof to the world that a ſuperintending Providence watches over the deeds of men, and finally overtakes the offender with ſlow, but certain vengeance.</p>
            <p>Such is the moral that inſpires and animates the whole of Juvenal's admirable performance. It may be called A POETICAL STATUTE OF FRAUDS AND PERJURIES. A compoſition ſo truly valuable ought not to remain in the hands of the ſcholar only, like a ſword in the ſcabbard, as Tully has it, <hi>tamquam in vaginâ reconditum.</hi> The doctrine ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed on every mind. For this purpoſe, the mode of imitation was thought more eligible than a direct and cloſe tranſlation. Mr. Pope had led the way, and the late Doctor Johnſon followed him with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed applauſe. The fine uſe which he made of the Third and Tenth Satires of Juvenal, in LONDON,
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0578802500:8"/>a Poem, and THE VANITY OF HUMAN WISHES, is well known to every reader of taſte. In fact, thoſe two pieces are finiſhed with ſuch vigour of ſentiment, and ſuch ſtrength and harmony of language, as may well preclude in the preſent writer all hope of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition. It is to be regretted that ſo fine a Moral Poet did not employ a portion of his time upon the Satire now before us. The author of the following lines endeavoured, at various times, to excite him to the undertaking; but the anſwer always was, "I WISH IT WAS DONE." The reader will, no doubt, wiſh the ſame, and by the pen of DOCTOR JOHN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SON. To ſupply the deficiency is the deſign of the piece now offered to the public. It is, at leaſt, a well intended attempt, and requires no apology.</p>
