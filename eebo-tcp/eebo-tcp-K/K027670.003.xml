            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THIS letter, my dear Lydia, will diſtreſs thy good heart, for from the beginning thou wilt perceive no enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſtrokes of humour in it—I
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0192301203:3"/>
cannot be chearful when a thouſand melancholy ideas ſurround me—I have met with a loſs of near fifty pounds, which I was taken in for in an extraordinary manner—but what is that loſs in compariſon of one I may experience?—Friendſhip is the balm and cordial of life, and without it, 'tis a heavy load not worth ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.—I am unhappy—thy mother and thyſelf at a diſtance from me, and what can compenſate for ſuch a deſtitution?—For God's ſake perſuade her to come and fix in England, for life is too ſhort to waſte in ſeparation—and whilſt ſhe lives in one country, and I in another, many people will ſuppoſe it proceeds from choice—

beſides I want thee near me, thou child and darling of my heart!—I am in a melancholy mood, and my Lydia's eyes will ſmart with weeping when I tell her the cauſe that now affects me.—I am apprehenſive the dear friend I mentioned in my laſt letter is going into a decline—I was with her two days ago, and I never beheld a being ſo alter'd—ſhe has a tender frame, and looks like a drooping lily, for the roſes are fled from her cheeks—I can never ſee or talk to this incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble woman without burſting into tears—I have a thouſand obligations to her, and I owe her more than her whole ſex, if not all the world put
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0192301203:5"/>
together.—She has a delicacy in her way of thinking that few poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs—our converſations are of the moſt intereſting nature, and ſhe talks to me of quitting this world with more compoſure than others think of living in it.—I have wrote an epitaph, of which I ſend thee a copy.—'Tis expreſſive of her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt worth—but may heav'n re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtore her! and may ſhe live to write mine.</p>

               <p>I Am ſincerely affected, my dear Mr. and Mrs. J.—by your friendly enquiry, and the intereſt you are ſo good to take in my health. God knows I am not able to give a good account of myſelf, having paſſed a bad night in much feveriſh agitation.—My phyſician ordered me to bed, and to keep therein 'till ſome favourable change—I fell ill the moment I got
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0192301203:9"/>
to my lodgings—he ſays it is owing to my taking James's Powder, and venturing out on ſo cold a day as Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day—but he is miſtaken, for I am certain whatever bears that name muſt have efficacy with me—I was bled yeſterday, and again to day, and have been almoſt dead, but this friendly enquiry from Gerrard-ſtreet has pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed balm into what blood I have left—I hope ſtill (and next to the ſenſe of what I owe my friends) it ſhall be the laſt pleaſurable ſenſation I will part with—if I continue mending, it will yet be ſome time before I ſhall have ſtrength enough to get out in a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage—my firſt viſit will be a viſit of true gratitude—I leave my kind

               <p>I Was yeſterday taking leave of all the town, with an intention of leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it this day, but I am detained by the kindneſs of lord and lady S—, who have made a party to dine and ſup on my account—I am impatient to ſet out for my ſolitude, for there the mind gains ſtrength, and learns to lean upon herſelf—In the world it ſeeks or accepts of a few treacherous
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0192301203:12"/>
ſupports—the feigned compaſſion of one—the flattery of a ſecond—the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilities of a third—the friendſhip of a fourth—they all deceive, and bring the mind back to where mine is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating, to retirement, reflection, and books. My departure is fixed for to-morrow morning, but I could not think of quitting a place where I have received ſuch numberleſs and unmerited civilities from your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, without returning my moſt grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thanks, as well as my hearty ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments for your friendly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry from Bath. Illneſs, my lord, has occaſioned my ſilence—Death knocked at my door, but I would not admit him—the call was both unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0192301203:13"/>
and unpleaſant—and I am ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly worn down to a ſhadow—and ſtill very weak, but weak as I am, I have as whimſical a ſtory to tell you as ever befel one of my family—Shan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's noſe, his name, his ſaſh window are fools to it—it will ſerve at leaſt to amuſe you—The injury I did myſelf laſt month in catching cold upon James's Powder—fell, you muſt know, upon the worſt part it could—the moſt painful, and moſt dangerous of any in the human body. It was on this criſis I called in an able ſurgeon and with him an able phyſician (both my friends) to inſpect my diſaſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>—'tis a venereal caſe, cried my two ſcientific friends—'tis impoſſible, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0192301203:14"/>
to be that, replied I—for I have had no commerce whatever with the ſex, not even with my wife, added I, theſe fifteen years.—You are, however, my good friend, ſaid the ſurgeon, or there is no ſuch caſe in the world—what the devil, ſaid I, without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing woman?—We will not reaſon about it, ſaid the phyſician, but you muſt undergo a courſe of mercury—I will loſe my life firſt, ſaid I—and truſt to nature, to time, or at the worſt to death—ſo I put an end, with ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, to the conference—and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to bear all the torments I underwent, and ten times more, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſubmit to be treated like a <hi>ſinner,</hi> in a point where I had acted
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0192301203:15"/>
like a <hi>ſaint.</hi>—Now as the father of miſchief would have it, who has no pleaſure like that of diſhonouring the righteous, it ſo fell out that from the moment I diſmiſſed my doctors, my pains began to rage with a violence not to be expreſſed, or ſupported. Every hour became more intolerable.—I was got to bed, cried out, and raved the whole night, and was got up ſo near dead that my friends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted upon my ſending again for my phyſician and ſurgeon. I told them upon the word of a man of honour they were both miſtaken, as to my caſe—but though they had reaſoned wrong, they might act right; but that ſharp as my ſufferings were, I
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0192301203:16"/>
felt them not ſo ſharp as the imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which a venereal treatment of my caſe laid me under—They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered that theſe taints of the blood laid dormant twenty years, but they would not reaſon with me in a point wherein I was ſo delicate, but would do all the office for which they were called in, namely to put an end to my torment, which otherwiſe would put an end to me—and ſo have I been compelled to ſurrender myſelf—and thus, my dear lord, has your poor friend with all his ſenſibilities been ſuffering the chaſtiſement of the groſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſenſualiſt.—Was it not as ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous an embarraſſment as ever Yo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick's ſpirit was involved in?—No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0192301203:17"/>
but the pureſt conſcience of innocence could have tempted me to write this ſtory to my wife, which by the bye would make no bad anecdote in Triſtram Shandy's Life—I have mentioned it in my journal to Mrs. — In ſome repects there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between my wife and herſelf—when they fare alike, neither can reaſonably complain.—I have juſt received letters from France, with ſome hints that Mrs. Sterne and my Lydia are coming to England, to pay me a viſit—if your time is not better employed, Yorick flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters himſelf he ſhall receive a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from your lordſhip, <hi>en attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant.</hi>

               <p>IT would be an inſult on your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity (or perhaps look like it,) to apologize for the liberty I am taking.—I am one of thoſe people whom the vulgar and illiberal call negroes.—The firſt part of my life was rather unlucky, as I was placed in a family who judged ignorance the beſt and
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0192301203:24"/>
only ſecurity for obedience.—A little reading and writing I got by unwea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried application.—The latter part of my life has been, thro' God's bleſſing, truly fortunate—having ſpent it in the ſervice of one of the beſt and greateſt families in the kingdom—my chief pleaſure has been books—Philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy I adore—How very much, good Sir, am I (amongſt millions) in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted to you for the character of your amiable Uncle Toby!—I declare I would walk ten miles in the dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days, to ſhake hands with the honeſt Corporal.—Your ſermons have touch'd me to the heart, and I hope have amended it, which brings me to the point—In your tenth diſcourſe, page

ſeventy-eight, in the ſecond volume—is this very affecting paſſage—<q rend="inline">"Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider how great a part of our ſpecies in all ages down to this—have been trod under the feet of cruel and capri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious tyrants, who would neither hear their cries, nor pity their diſtreſſes.—Conſider ſlavery—what it is—how bitter a draught—and how many mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions are made to drink of it."</q>—Of all my favourite authors not one has drawn a tear in favour of my miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble black brethren—excepting your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and the humane author of Sir Geo.

half hour's attention to ſlavery, as it is at this day practiſed in our Weſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.—That ſubject handled in your ſtriking manner would eaſe the yoke (perhaps) of many—but if only of one—gracious God! what a feaſt to a benevolent heart! and ſure I am, you are an epicurean in acts of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.—You who are univerſally read, and as univerſally admired—you could not fail.—Dear Sir, think in me you behold the uplifted hands of thouſands of my brother Moors.

               <p>THERE is a ſtrange coinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, Sancho, in the little events (as well as in the great ones) of this world: for I had been writing a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der tale of the ſorrows of a friendleſs poor negro-girl, and my eyes had ſcarce done ſmarting with it, when your letter of recommendation, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of ſo many of her brethren and ſiſters, came to me—but why <hi>her bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren?</hi> or yours, Sancho! any more
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0192301203:29"/>
than mine? It is by the fineſt tints, and moſt inſenſible gradations, that nature deſcends from the faireſt face about St. James's, to the ſootieſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion in Africa:—at which tint of theſe is it, that the ties of blood are to ceaſe? and how many ſhades muſt we deſcend lower ſtill in the ſcale, ere mercy is to vaniſh with them? But 'tis no uncommon thing, my good Sancho, for one half of the world to uſe the other half of it like brutes, and then endeavour to make 'em ſo.—For my own part, I never look <hi>weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> (when I am in a penſive mood at leaſt) but I think of the burthens which our brothers and ſiſters are <hi>there</hi> carrying, and could I eaſe their
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0192301203:30"/>
ſhoulders from one ounce of them, I declare I would ſet out this hour upon a pilgrimage to Mecca for their ſakes—which by the bye, Sancho, exceeds your walk of ten miles in about the ſame proportion, that a viſit of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity ſhould one of mere form.—However, if you meant my Uncle Toby more he is your debtor.—If I can weave the tale I have wrote into the work I am about—'tis at the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the afflicted—and a much greater matter; for in ſerious truth, it caſts a ſad ſhade upon the world, that ſo great a part of it are, and have been ſo long bound in chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in chains of miſery; and I cannot but both reſpect and felicitate
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0192301203:31"/>
you, that by ſo much laudable dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence you have broke the one—and that by falling into the hands of ſo good and merciful a family, Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has reſcued you from the other.</p>

               <p>YOU are perhaps the drolleſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the univerſe—Why do you banter me ſo about what I wrote to you?—Tho' I told you, every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I jump'd into Venus's lap (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereby the ſea) was you to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from that, that I leap'd into the ladies beds afterwards?—The body guides you—the mind me.—I have
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:0192301203:89"/>
wrote the moſt whimſical letter to a lady that was ever read, and talk'd of body and ſoul too—I ſaid ſhe had made me vain, by ſaying ſhe was mine more than ever woman was—but ſhe is not the lady of Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet nor — ſquare, nor the lady who ſupp'd with me in Bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreet on ſcollop'd oyſters, and other ſuch things—nor did ſhe ever go <hi>tete-a-tete</hi> with me to Salt Hill.—Enough of ſuch nonſenſe—The paſt is over—and I can juſtify myſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to myſelf—can you do as much?—No faith!—<q rend="inline">"You can feel!"</q> Aye ſo can my cat, when he hears a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male caterwauling on the houſe top—but caterwauling diſguſts me. I
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0192301203:90"/>
had rather raiſe a gentle flame, than have a different one raiſed in me.—Now, I take heav'n to witneſs, after all this <hi>badinage</hi> my heart is innocent—and the ſporting of my pen is equal, juſt equal, to what I did in my boy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh days, when I got aſtride of a ſtick, and gallop'd away—The truth is this—that my pen governs me—not me my pen.—You are much to blame if you dig for marle, unleſs you are ſure of it.—I was once ſuch a puppy myſelf, as to pare, and burn, and had my labour for my pains, and two hundred pounds out of pocket.—Curſe on farming (ſaid I) I will try if the pen will not ſucceed better than the ſpade.—The following

               <p>I Have ſuffered under a ſtrong de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire for above this fortnight, to ſend a letter of enquiries after the health and the well-being of my dear friends, Mr. and Mrs. J—, and I do aſſure you both, 'twas merely owing to a little modeſty in my temper not to make my good-will troubleſome, where I have ſo much, and to thoſe
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0192301203:99"/>
I never think of, but with ideas of ſenſibility and obligation, that I have refrain'd.—Good God! to think I could be in town, and not go the firſt ſtep I made to Gerrard Street!—My mind and body muſt be at ſad variance with each other, ſhould it ever fall out that it is not both the firſt and laſt place alſo where I ſhall betake myſelf, were it only to ſay, "God bleſs you."—May you have every bleſſing he can ſend you! 'tis a part of my litany, where you will always have a place whilſt I have a tongue to repeat it.—And ſo you heard I had left Scarborough, which you would no more credit, than the reaſons aſſign'd for it—I thank you
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0192301203:100"/>
for it kindly—tho' you have not told me what they were, being a ſhrewd divine, I think I can gueſs.—I was ten days at Scarborough in September, and was hoſpitably entertained by one of the beſt of our Biſhops; who, as he kept houſe there, preſs'd me to be with him—and his houſhold conſiſted of a gentleman, and two ladies—which, with the good Biſhop, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, made ſo good a party that we kept much to ourſelves.—I made in this time a connection of great friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip with my mitred hoſt, who would gladly have taken me with him back to Ireland.—However we all left Scarborough together, and lay fifteen miles off, where we kindly parted
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0192301203:101"/>
—Now it was ſuppoſed (and have ſince heard) that I e'en went on with the party to London, and this I ſuppoſe was the reaſon aſſign'd for my being there.—I dare ſay charity would add a little to the account, and give out that 'twas on the ſcore of one, and perhaps both of the ladies—and I will excuſe charity on that head, for a heart diſengaged could not well have done better.—I have been hard writing ever ſince—and hope by Chriſtmas I ſhall be able to give a gentle rap at your door—and tell you how happy I am to ſee my two good friends.—I aſſure you I ſpur on my Pegaſus more violently upon that account, and am now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined

as one great excellence of his writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings lies in the moſt happy choice of metaphors and alluſions—ſuch as ſhewed his philoſophic judgement, at the ſame time that they diſplayed his wit and genius—but it is not for me to comment on, or correct ſo great an original.

                  <p>No—not one farthing would I give for ſuch a coat in wet weather, or dry—If the ſun ſhines you are ſure of being melted, becauſe it cloſes ſo tight about one—if it rains it is no more a defence than a cobweb—a very ſieve, o' my conſcience! that lets through every drop, and like many other things that are put on only for a cover, mortifies you with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment and makes you curſe the impoſtor, when it is too late to avail one's ſelf of the diſcovery. Had I been wiſe I ſhould have examined the claim the coat had to the title of

                     <q rend="inline">"defender of the body"</q>—before I had truſted my body in it—I ſhould have held it up to the light like other ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious matters I have ſeen, how much it was likely to admit of that which I wanted to keep out—whether it was no more than ſuch a frail, flimſy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>texture of fleſh and blood, as I am fated to carry about with me through every tract of this dirty world, could have comfortably and ſafely diſpenſed within ſo ſhort a journey—taking into my account the chance of ſpreading trees—thick hedges o'erhanging the road—with twenty other coverts that a man may thruſt his head under—if he is not violently puſhed on by that d—d ſtimulus—you know where
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0192301203:160"/>
—that will not let a man ſit ſtill in one place for half a minute together—but like a young nettleſome tit is eternally on the fret, and is for puſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on ſtill farther—or if the poor ſcared devil is not hunted tantivy by a hue and cry with gives and a halter dangling before his eyes—now in other caſes he has not a minute to throw away in ſtanding ſtill, but like king Lear muſt brave <q rend="inline">"the peltings of a pitileſs ſtorm"</q> and give heaven leave to <q rend="inline">"rumble its belly full—ſpit fire—or ſpout rain"</q>—as ſpitefully as it pleaſeth, without finding the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination or the reſolution to ſlacken his pace leſt ſomething ſhould be loſt that might have been gained, or more

I ſhould have ſeen by the light at one glance, how little it would keep out of rain, by how little it would keep in of darkneſs—This a coat for a rainy day? do pray madam hold it up to that window—did you ever ſee ſuch an <hi>illuſtrious</hi> coat ſince the day you could diſtinguiſh between a coat and a pair of breeches?—My lady did not underſtand derivatives, and ſo ſhe could not ſee quite through my ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did pun.

Make a fan out of it for the ladies to look at their gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants with at church—It has not ſerved me for one purpoſe—it will ſerve them for two—This is coarſe ſtuff—of worſe manufacture than the cloth—put it to its proper uſe, for I love when things ſort and join well—make a philtre <note n="*" place="bottom">This alluſion is improper.

Good God! anſwered LONGINUS (making an exclamation, but taking care at the ſame time to moderate his voice) why, of the art of making all kinds of your theological, hebdodomical, roſtrummical, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drummical what d'ye call 'ems—I will be ſhot, quoth EPISTEMON, if

Thou haſt fallen twelve feet and about five inches below the mark, anſwer'd EPISTEMON, for I hold them to be <hi>Sermons</hi>—which ſaid word, (as I take the matter) being but a word of low degree, for a book of high rhetoric—LONGINUS RABELAICUS was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minded to uſher and lead into his diſſertation, with as much pomp and parade as he could afford; and for my own part, either I know no more of Latin than my horſe, or the KE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RUKOPAEDIA is nothing but the art of making 'em—And why not, quoth GYMNAST, of preaching them
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0192301203:168"/>
when we have done?—Believe me, dear ſouls, this is half in half—and if ſome ſkilful body would but put us in a way to do this to ſome <hi>tune</hi>—Thou wouldſt not have them <hi>chanted</hi> ſurely, quoth TRIBOULET, laughing?—No, nor <hi>canted</hi> neither, quoth GYMNAST, crying!—but what I mean, my friends, ſays LONGINUS RABELAICUS (who is certainly one of the greateſt criticks in the weſtern world, and as Rabelaic a fellow as ever exiſted) what I mean, ſays he, interrupting them both and reſuming his diſcourſe, is this, that if all the ſcatter'd rules of the KERUKOPAEDIA could be but once carefully collected into one code, as thick as PA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NURGE's

               <p>HOMENAS who had to preach next Sunday (before God knows whom) knowing nothing at all of the matter—was all this while at it as hard as he could drive in the very next room:—for having fouled two clean ſheets of his own, and being

quite ſtuck faſt in the entrance upon his third general <hi>diviſion,</hi> and finding himſelf unable to get either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards or backwards with any grace—<q rend="inline">"Curſe it," ſays he, (thereby ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicating every mother's ſon who ſhould think differently) "why may not a man lawfully call in for help in this, as well as any other human emergency?"</q>—So without any more argumentation, except ſtarting up and nimming down from the top ſhelf but one, the ſecond volume of CLARK—tho' without any felonious intention in ſo doing, he had begun to clap me in (making a joint firſt) five whole pages, nine round para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphs, and a dozen and a half of
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0192301203:172"/>
good thoughts all of a row; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there was a confounded high gallery—was tranſcribing it away like a little devil.—Now—quoth HOMENAS to himſelf <q rend="inline">"tho' I hold all this to be fair and ſquare, yet, if I am found out, there will be the deuce and all to pay."</q>—<hi>Why are the bells ringing backwards, you lad? what</hi> is <hi>all that crowd about, honeſt man?</hi> HOMENAS <hi>was got upon Doctor</hi> CLARK's <hi>back, ſir—and what of that, my lad?

will never preach more while breath is in his body.—No, faith, I ſhall never again be able to tickle it off as I have done. I may ſit up whole winter nights baking my blood with hectic watchings, and write as ſolid as a FATHER of the church—or, I may ſit down whole ſummer days evaporating my ſpirits into the fineſt thoughts, and write as florid as a MOTHER of it.—In a word, I may compoſe myſelf off my legs, and preach till I burſt—and when I have done, it will be worſe than if not done at all.—<hi>Pray Mr. Such-a-one, who held forth laſt Sunday?

all over the ſurface of his harangue, they not only play'd the devil and all with the ſublimity—but moreover the ſaid tears, by their ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous quality, did ſo refrigerate, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitate, and hurry down to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of his ſoul, all the unſavory par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles which lay fermenting (as you ſaw) in the middle of his conception, that he went on in the cooleſt and chaſteſt ſtile (for a <hi>ſoliloquy</hi> I think) that ever mortal man uttered.</p>

projectile force to what he was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to let fly, full in LONGINUS RA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BELAICUS's teeth who ſat over againſt him.—Yet for all that, he had the continence to contain himſelf, for he ſtopt ſhort, I ſay, without uttering one word except, Z....ds—many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons may be aſſign'd for this, but the moſt true, the moſt ſtrong, the moſt hydroſtatical, and the moſt philoſophical reaſon, why PANURGE did not go on, was—that the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mention'd <hi>torrent</hi> did ſo <hi>drown</hi> his voice, that he had none left to go on with.—God help him, poor fellow! ſo he ſtopt ſhort, (as I have told you before) and all the time HOMENAS was ſpeaking he ſaid not another
