            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>POSTSCRIPT.</head>
            <p>THE Tragedy, here offered to the Public, is founded on a paſſage in VALERIUS MAXIMUS<note place="bottom">Vide Valer. Max. lib. 5, c. 4, <hi>de Pictate in Parentes.</hi> 7.</note>. We are told by that Author, <q>That a woman of ingenuous birth was convicted before the PRAETOR of a capital crime, and delivered over to the TRIUMVIR to be put to death in priſon. The jailer received her into his cuſtody, but, touched with compaſſion, did not proceed immediately to execute the ſentence. His humanity went ſo far as to admit the daughter of the unhappy criminal into the goal; but not without a previous ſearch, left any nouriſhment ſhould be ſecretly conveyed. To ſtarve the priſoner to death was his deſign. Several days paſſed, when it became a matter of wonder how the poor woman ſubſiſted ſo long. The jailer's curioſity was excited: he watched the daughter narrowly, and ſaw her give her breaſt to the famiſhed mother, and with her milk ſupply the cravings of nature. Touched by the novelty of ſo affecting a ſight, he made his report to the TRIUMVIR, from whom it reached the PRAETOR, and, the whole matter being referred to the JUDICIAL MAGISTRATES, the mother received a free pardon. What will not filial piety undertake?—What place will it not penetrate?—What will it not deviſe, when in a dungeon it finds unheard of means to preſerve a parent's life?—Is there in the courſe of human affairs, a ſcene ſo big with wonder, as a mother nouriſhed at the daughter's breaſt?—The incident might, at the firſt view, be thought repugnant to the order of nature, if TO LOVE OUR PARENTS were not the FIRST LAW ſtamped by the hand of Nature on the human heart.</q> Thus far VALERIUS MAXIMUS. He goes on in the ſame place, and tells a Greek tale, in which the heroine performs the fame act of piety to a father in the decline of life. For the purpoſes of the drama, the latter ſtory has been preferred. The painters long ſince ſeized the ſubject,
<pb facs="tcp:0159101100:80"/>
and by them it has been called ROMAN CHARITY. The Author has taken the liberty to place it in the reign of DIONYSIUS the Younger, at the point of time when TIMOLEON laid ſiege to SYRACUSE. The general effect, it was thought, would be better produced, if the whole had an air of real hiſtory.</p>
            <q>
               <l>Atque ita mentitur, ſic veris falſa remiſcet,</l>
               <l>Primo ne medium, medio ne diſcrepet imum.</l>
            </q>
            <p>The Author does not wiſh to conceal that the ſubject of his Tragedy has been touched in ſome foreign pieces: but he thinks it has been <hi>only</hi> touched. The ZELMIRE of Monſ. BELLOY begins after the daughter has delivered her father out of priſon. The play indeed has many beauties; and if the ſentiments and buſineſs of that piece coincided with the deſign of THE GRECIAN DAUGHTER, the Author would not have bluſhed to tread in his ſteps. But a new fable was abſolutely neceſſary: and, perhaps, in the preſent humour of the times, it is not unlucky that no more than three lines could be adopted from Monſ. BELLOY. Every writer, who makes up a ſtory with characters and incidents already hackneyed on the Engliſh ſtage, and invents nothing, cries out with an air of triumph, That he has not borrowed from the wits of FRANCE. In the Iſle of Man, it is ſaid, there is an epitaph in theſe words: <hi>"He who lies here interred, was never out of this iſland."</hi> The poor man was to be pitied: a ſimilar inscription upon the tomb-ſtone of a modern poet would, perhaps, do as little honour to the memory of the deceaſed.</p>
            <p>The Author cannot diſmiſs his Play, without declaring, that, though in love with the ſubject, he has not ſatisfied even his own ideas of the drama: he laments that he had neither time nor ability to make it better. To heighten it with additional beauties was reſerved for the decorations with which the zeal of Mr. GARRICK has embelliſhed the repreſentation; for the admirable performance of Mr. BARRY, and, above all, for the enchanting powers and the genius of Mrs. BARRY.</p>
