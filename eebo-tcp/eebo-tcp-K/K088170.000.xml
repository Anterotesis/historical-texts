            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>I PRESENT the Reader with an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect
attempt on an important
topic. The materials deſigned for
this Eſſay, with others, have been
accidentally deſtroyed. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
ſketches are therefore not ſo
numerous as I could wiſh, and as
the ſubject appears to promiſe. They
claim all the indulgence of the title.</p>
            <p>I have long conſidered, what I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
will be readily acknowledged,
that there is a ſimilarity in the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters
of Men of Genius, perceivable
<pb n="iv" facs="tcp:0238000900:3"/>
to a contemplative mind, and that
reflections on their character may be
exemplified by a ſufficient number
of facts. To ſeiſe the diſpoſitions
of the Literary Character, I looked
therefore into Literary Hiſtory, and
my collections exceeded my hopes.</p>
            <p>When Rouſſeau compoſed his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertation
on the Equality of Man,
this eloquent philoſopher ſought for
<hi>facts,</hi> on which to found his reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings;
theſe he collected from an
extenſive peruſal of voyages and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
of remote nations. I conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
that to form juſt reflections on
Men of Genius, it was proper to
collect facts from their biography,
and their concatenation produced all
my reflections.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="tcp:0238000900:4"/>
The more I meditate, the more I
am perſuaded that all ſpeculations
are illuſory and unſatisfactory, unleſs
they are eſtabliſhed on prominent
facts, which are to be firſt collected
before we venture to indulge meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical
diſquiſitions. It is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
of Bolingbroke, that <q rend="inline">ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
or general propoſitions,
though never ſo true, appear ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure
or doubtful to us very often,
till they are explained by <hi>exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples</hi>—when
examples are pointed
out to us, there is a kind of appeal,
with which we are flattered, made
to our ſenſes, as well as our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings.
The inſtruction
comes then from our authority;
<hi>we yield to fact, when we reſiſt
ſpeculation.</hi>
               </q> If we compare the
<pb n="vi" facs="tcp:0238000900:5"/>
labours of Machiavel with thoſe of
Monteſquieu, we may obſerve, that
the illuſtrious Frenchman had all the
delicacy, the refinement, and the
ſenſibility of his nation, and his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
reflections are therefore brilliant,
but often fallacious, becauſe not built
on the permanent baſe of experience.
The crafty Florentine, verſant in the
manners of Princes, with ſagacity
equal to his genius, deduces all his
reflections from thoſe prominent
<hi>facts</hi> which paſſed under his eye, or
which he collected from the records
of inſtructive hiſtory. Lord Bacon
introduced that wiſe philoſophy
which is only founded on <hi>experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi>;
the ſtudy of Nature in her
operations. And I believe every ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious
phyſician prefers the manner
<pb n="vii" facs="tcp:0238000900:6"/>
of Sydenham, who derives his medical
fame from the vigilant obſervation,
and the continued experience of
tracing the progreſs of actual caſes,
in the operation of actual remedies,
to that of ſome modern medical
writers, who, dazzled by ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
phantoms, promulge paradoxes,
which, unconfirmed by facts, produce
much more ſerious conſequence than
literary paradoxes.<note n="*" place="bottom">The Readers of "A Diſſertation on Anecdotes" will pleaſe to accept theſe obſervations, as a final ſupplement to that tract.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The LITERARY CHARACTER
has, in the preſent day, ſingularly
degenerated in the public mind. The
fineſt compoſitions appear with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
exciting any alarm of admiration,
they are read, approved, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="viii" facs="tcp:0238000900:7"/>
by others; nor is the preſence
of the Author conſidered, as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly,
as conferring honour on his
companions; we paſs our evenings
ſometimes with poets and hiſtorians,
whom it is probable will be admired
by poſterity, with hardly any other
ſenſation than we feel from inferior
aſſociates.</p>
            <p>The youth who has more reading
than experience, and a finer imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation
than a ſound logic, will often
be ſurpriſed when he compares the
ſplendid facts ſtored in his memory,
with the ordinary circumſtances that
paſs under his eye. In the hiſtory of
all ages, and of all nations, he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
the higheſt honours paid to
the Literary Character. Statues,
tombs, feſtivals, and coronations,
<pb n="ix" facs="tcp:0238000900:8"/>
croud in glittering confuſion, while,
when he condeſcends to look around
him, he perceives the brilliant en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment
diſſolved, and not a veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tige
remains of the feſtivals and the
coronations.</p>
            <p>Before I attempt to alledge a reaſon
for a ſingular revolution in the human
mind, I ſhall arrange a few ſtriking
facts of the numerous honours which
have been paid to the Literary Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.</p>
            <p>I muſt not dwell on the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
beſtowed on the learned by the
Greeks and the Romans; their tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,
their ſtatues, their games, and
fleets diſpatched to invite the Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;
theſe honours were more
numerous and ſplendid than thoſe of
modern ages. I muſt not detail the
<pb n="x" facs="tcp:0238000900:9"/>
magnificent rewards and the high
veneration paid by the Perſians, the
Turks, the Arabians, the Chineſe,
&amp;c. The Perſian Ferdoſi received
ſacks of gold for his verſes; the
Arabs have ſent ambaſſadors to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulate
poets on the ſucceſs of their
works; Mahomet took off his man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
to preſent to an Author; and
literature in China confers nobility.
But I paſs this romantic celebrity, to
throw a rapid glance on our own
Europe.</p>
            <p>Not to commence more remotely
than at the thirteenth century,
when Nobles, and even Kings, aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
to literature. Authors, of courſe,
were held in the higheſt eſtimation.
Fauchet and Paſquier inform us, that
the learned received magnificent
<pb n="xi" facs="tcp:0238000900:10"/>
dreſſes, ſteeds richly capariſoned,
and arms reſplendent with diamonds
and gold. The Floral games at
Toulouſe were eſtabliſhed; and three
prizes of golden flowers were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
for the happy poets. It was
in the fourteenth century that the Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians
raiſed triumphal arches, tombs,
and coronations, for diſtinguiſhed
Authors. Ravenna erected a marble
tomb to the memory of Dante; Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taldo
a ſtatue to Boccaccio, and Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarch
was at once invited by the city
of Rome and the court of France, to
receive the crown of laurel. Rome
was preferred, and there he was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly
crowned with ſuch magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence
of pomp, and ceremonies ſo
ſplendid and numerous, that his own
imagination could not have ſurpaſſed
<pb n="xii" facs="tcp:0238000900:11"/>
the realities of this triumph.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>I lament much that Dr. Burney, whoſe learning excels my praiſe, and whoſe elegance is not inferior to his learning, has treated this ſubject with great levity. He ſays, in his valuable Hiſtory of Muſic, vol. 2. p. 332, that this was a cenſureable vanity—and that <q rend="inline">the blame can only be laid on his <hi>youth,</hi> or rather on <hi>the practice of the times.</hi>
                     </q> And he continues in a ſtrain of ridicule to cenſure theſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of national ſenſibility. But I obſerve, that the learned Doctor, while he ſmiles at this popular diſplay and vanity, has prefixed to his performance <hi>his own portrait</hi> in (what ſome may conſider) <hi>the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected poſture</hi> of <hi>beating time,</hi> painted by Reynolds, and engraved by Bartolozzi. The Doctor makes an animated appearance; but this <hi>public exhibition</hi> of Burney, has not leſs vanity than that of Petrarch; muſt not we apply to the Doctor his own words, and <q rend="inline">lay the blame on his youth, or rather <hi>on the practice of the times?</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The error of Dr. Burney, in this inſtance, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from his not confeſſing that there was <hi>no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi> in the coronation of Petrarch; for the love of glory is ſomething very ſuperior to vanity.</p>
               </note> Taſſo
died the evening of his coronation.
In the fifteenth century, Sannazarius
received from the Venetians for ſix
verſes, ſix hundred piſtoles, and
<pb n="xiii" facs="tcp:0238000900:12"/>
poets were kiſſed by princeſſes. Later
times ſaw the phlegmatic Hollander
raiſe aſtatue to the excellent Eraſmus.
Let us not omit that Charles IX. of
France reſerved apartments in his
palace, and even wrote a poetical
epiſtle to Ronſard; and Baif received
a ſilver image of Minerva from his
native city. Charles V. and Francis I.
in the ſixteenth century, poured
honours, preferments, and gifts, on
the learned of their age. Literary
merit was the road to promotion, and
ſeignories and abbeys, ſeats in the
ſtate council, and ambaſſadorſhips
were beſtowed upon the Literary
Character.</p>
            <p>Since all this is truth, yet at
preſent appears much like fiction, it
may be enquired if our anceſtors
<pb n="xiv" facs="tcp:0238000900:13"/>
were wiſer than we, or we more wiſe
than our anceſtors.</p>
            <p>It is to be recollected, that before
the art of printing exiſted, great
Authors were like their works, very
rare; learning was then only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
by the devotion of a life. It
was long after the art of multiplying
works at pleaſure was diſcovered,
that the people were capable of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating
in the novel benefit; what
Alexander feared, when he reproached
Ariſtotle for rendering learning po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular,
has happened to modern lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature;
learning and talents have
ceaſed to be learning and talents, by
an univerſal diffuſion of books, and
a continued exerciſe of the mind.
Authors became numerous, but as
the body of the people, till within
<pb n="xv" facs="tcp:0238000900:14"/>
the preſent century, was ſufficiently
unenlightened, their numbers were not
yet found inconvenient; and as dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionaries
were not yet formed, every
man was happy to ſeiſe on whatever
particles of knowledge accident of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered;
ſo late as the middle of this
century, Tranſlators were yet eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed,
and Compilers were yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected.</p>
            <p>But ſince, with inceſſant induſtry,
volumes have been multiplied, and
their prices rendered them acceſſible
to the loweſt artiſans, the Literary
Character has gradually fallen into
diſrepute. It may be urged that a
ſuperior mind, long cultivated, and
long exerciſed, adorned with polite,
and enriched with ſolid letters, muſt
ſtill retain it's pre-eminence among
<pb n="xvi" facs="tcp:0238000900:15"/>
the inferior ranks of men; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
may ſtill exact the ſame reſpect
from his fellow-citizens, and ſtill
continue the dignity of an Author
with the ſame juſt claims as in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding
ages.</p>
            <p>I believe, however, that he who
would be reverenced as an Author has
only one reſource; and that is, by
paying to himſelf that reverence,
which will be refuſed by the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
The reſpect which the higher
claſſes ſhew to the Literary Character,
proceeds from habitual politeneſs,
and not from any ſenſibility of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration;
and that this is true, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
from this circumſtance, that,
ſhould the Literary Character, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,
refuſe to accommodate himſelf
to their regulations, and have not the
<pb n="xvii" facs="tcp:0238000900:16"/>
art of diſcovering what quality they
expect to be remarked in themſelves,
he will be ſoon forſaken; and he
may ſay what Socrates did at the
court of Cyprus, <q rend="inline">what I know is
not proper for this place, and
what is proper for this place, I
know not.</q> Men of the world
are curious to have a glance at a
celebrated Author, as they would be
at ſome uncommon animal; he is
therefore ſometimes exhibited, and
ſpectators are invited. A croud of
frivoliſts gaze at a Man of Letters,
and catch the ſounds of his ideas, as
children regard the reflections of a
magic lanthorn.<note n="*" place="bottom">The obſervation of the great Eraſmus on Men of Letters, is not leſs juſt than admirable. He ſaid, that they were like the great figures in the tapeſtries of Flanders, which loſe their effect, when not ſeen at a diſtance.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xviii" facs="tcp:0238000900:17"/>
Nor will the Literary Character
find a happier reception among others
if he exacts an obſervance of his
dignity. Authors are a multitude;
and it requires no inconſiderable
leiſure and intelligence to adjuſt the
claims of ſuch numerous candidates.</p>
            <p>De Foe called the laſt age, the
age of Projectors, and Johnſon has
called the preſent, the age of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors.
But there is this difference
between them; the epidemical folly
of projecting in time cures itſelf, for
men become weary with ruination;
but writing is an interminable pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit,
and the raptures of publication
have a great chance of becoming a
permanent faſhion. When I reflect
that every literary journal conſiſts of
50 or 60 publications, and that of
<pb n="xix" facs="tcp:0238000900:18"/>
theſe, 5 or 6 at leaſt are capital per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances,
and the greater part not
contemptible, when I take the pen
and attempt to calculate, by theſe
given ſums, the number of volumes
which the next century muſt infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libly
produce, my feeble faculties
wander in a perplexed ſeries, and
as I loſe myſelf among billions, tril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions,
and quartillions, I am obliged
to lay down my pen, and ſtop at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity.</p>
            <p>
               <q rend="inline">Where all this will end, God
only knows,</q> is the reflection of
a grave hiſtorian, in concluding the
Memoirs of his Age. Nature has,
no doubt, provided ſome concealed
remedy for this future univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge.
Perhaps in the progreſs of
ſcience, ſome new ſenſes may be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="xx" facs="tcp:0238000900:19"/>
in the human character, and
this ſuperfluity of knowledge may be
eſſential to the underſtanding, We
are conſiderably indebted, doubtleſs,
to the patriotic endeavours of our
grocers and trunkmakers, whom I

               <item>IT is, perhaps, unneceſſary to remind the
Reader that Cicero has written on Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Glory—of his work on Glory, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
has reached us but the title; yet of his
numerous compoſitions, this, as a production
of eloquence, promiſed to be moſt grateful

               <item>The county of Eſſex was diſtinguiſhed by the
Romans by the name of Tribonantes, and it
was in this province that Seneca oppreſſed
the inhabitants with the loan of immenſe
ſums at an immenſe intereſt.</item>

               <item>I omitted to obſerve, that the impiety of
Satan has actually been cenſured by Clarke.
Johnſon even applauds the obſervation of our
Divine. I tranſcribe that great Biographer's
words. <q rend="inline">For there are thoughts, as he
(Clarke) juſtly remarks, which no obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation
of character can juſtify, becauſe no
good man would willingly permit them to
paſs, however tranſiently, through his own
mind.</q> Here we obſerve two of our moſt
profound <hi>thinkers,</hi> deciding on a ſubject of
<hi>taſte</hi>; but their edict I preſume is anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poetical.
Their piety was too ponderous for
the exertion of their fancy. The divinity
of Clarke, and the logic of Johnſon, were
alike fatal to certain delicious ſtrokes in the
arts of fancy; the moſt ſubtile particles of
poetical refinement eſcaped their unelaſtic or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,
and fell on the ſolidity of their minds,
like ſeeds ſcattered upon rocks; where they

            <head>CHAP. I. Of Literary Men.</head>
            <p>A NUMEROUS and an important body
of men, diffuſed over enlightened Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
and claſſed under no particular
profeſſion, are, during the moſt arduous
period of their life, unaſſiſted and unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded;
and while often devoting them
ſelves to national purpoſes, are expoſed
not only to poverty, the fate of the many;
to calumny, the portion of the great;
but to an ugly family of peculiar misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes.
Theſe are men of letters; men
whoſe particular genius often becomes
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0238000900:24"/>
that of a people; the ſovereigns of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon;
the legiſlators of morality; the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificers
of our moſt exquiſite pleaſures.</p>
            <p>Every other body of ingenious men
(whether the corporation of uſeful me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics,
or the ſociety of great artiſts)
are allowed ſome common aſſociation;
ſome domeſtic ſeat devoted to the genius
of their profeſſion, where they are mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually
enlightened and conſoled. Men
of letters, in our country reſemble
<q>Houſeleſs wanderers,</q>
ſcattered and ſolitary, diſunited and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid;
whoſe talents are frequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
to their companions, and by the
inertneſs of an unhappy ſituation, often
unperceived by themſelves.</p>
            <p>It is remarkable that thoſe men in the
nation who are moſt familiar with each
other's conceptions, and moſt capable
of reciprocal eſteem, are thoſe who are
often moſt eſtranged.</p>

            <head>CHAP. II. Of Authors.</head>
            <p>IT is neceſſary to diſtinguiſh between
an Author, and a Writer; becauſe, the
deſcriptions which I propoſe to ſketch
of the ſituations to which genius is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
expoſed, will not happen to thoſe
whoſe productions are their occaſional
effuſions; and who ſeldom propoſe in
the puerile age, to become Authors. I
ſhall conſider that no Writer, has a juſt
claim to the title of Author, whoſe
CHIEF EMPLOYMENT is not that of STUDY
and COMPOSITION. Richardſon the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veliſt,
and Geſſner the poet, were both
printers, and this will, occaſionally, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude
them from the idea I at preſent
attach to an author. Hume and Bayle,
Johnſon and Voltaire, are ſtudents who
aſſumed the profeſſion of authors. The
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0238000900:26"/>
occaſional productions of a man of genius
are ſo many ſportive offerings laid on
the altar of the Graces; the more volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minous
labours of great authors, are ſo
many trophies raiſed on a triumphal
column.</p>
            <p>I totally exclude from theſe ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
two kinds of writers. Thoſe who
diſgrace letters and humanity by an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
devotion to their private intereſts,
and who like Atalanta, for the ſake of
the apples of gold, loſe the glory of
the race; and thoſe who intrude on the
public notice without adequate talents,
whoſe vanity liſtens to a few encomiaſts
whoſe politeneſs is greater than their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment,
or who applaud loudly and
cenſure in whiſpers.</p>
            <p>If we enquire into the character of an
author, we find that every claſs of men
entertains a different notion of his occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pations.
We perceive alſo that the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0238000900:27"/>
world are divided into parties; and
that they are mutually unjuſt. Few are
capable of honouring this character; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals
err from various motives; the
public only are enlightened and juſt.</p>
            <p>The importance of an author in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,
is yet ſo little known, that it is
rarely apparent even to authors them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
            <p>The faſhionable circle conceive an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
muſt be an amuſing companion;
they conſider his preſence, like the other
ornaments of their tables. It implies
that they are perſons of taſte.</p>
            <p>The buſy part of mankind ſuppoſe an
author to be a trader; and are only aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
to obſerve men perſevere in an
occupation ſo unprofitable.</p>
            <p>The ſtateſman only regards a philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
writer as a man of dangerous ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations,
who, if left in ſecurity, is
daring, if attacked by perſecution, is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0238000900:28"/>
intrepid. One who makes him tremble
in the darkneſs of his moſt ſecret coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils.</p>
            <p>The man of ſcience regards his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions
with contempt, and at the moſt
favourable view only as ſo many amuſing
futilities. He marks his ſuperior ſucceſs
with a jealous eye; and complains of a
frivolous public. A geometrician can
draw no deductions, and ſees nothing
proved, by the fineſt verſes of a poet;
an antiquary marvels that an elegant hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian
ſhould be preferred to a chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger;
and a metaphyſician wonders at
the delight communicated by faithful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations
of human life, written by
one whom he thinks incapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending
a page of Locke.</p>
            <p>It will ſurpriſe the young and virtuous
reader, when I muſt alſo add that the
character is ſometimes conſidered as a
kind of diſgrace. To excel in thoſe ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0238000900:29"/>
which enlighten or amuſe
a poliſhed people, has ceaſed to be a
merit with ſome, becauſe of the nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
claimants for this honour. But it
is with authors as with thoſe military
fops who frequent the theatres, and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume
with their cockade, the title of
captain. Enquire, and you find that
the obſtreperous gentleman has been
only an enſign for a week, and often
that he has no claims at all to the bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed
cockade. Thus with authors, if
the pretenders are diſcerned, and the
ranks diſtinguiſhed, a man will reduce
the number to a very inconſiderable por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of a numerous acquaintance. Every
one who prints a book is not an author;
publication is the teſt of literature, and
there are an infinite number of works
which are printed, but which all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive
induſtry of the author could
never publiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:0238000900:30"/>
Many of that claſs of ſociety whoſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire
nights are rotations of inanity, and
whoſe days are too ſhort for neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
bluſh for a friend who is an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor;
and, as the daughter of Addiſon
was taught, deſpiſe even a parent who
had given to a faſhionable and unworthy
woman, an illuſtrious name. Theſe are
they who gaze in the ſilence of ſtupidity
when an unuſual topic glides into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and will pardon any ſpecies of
rudeneſs, ſooner than that of good ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Others know themſelves incapacitated
to become authors, and ficken at the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collection
of their abortions. Literary
attainments are depreciated, to conſole
their deficiencies; as bankrupts, out of
mere envy, calumniate the ſucceſsful
merchant.</p>
            <p>There is, however, a race of ingenious
men, who derive their merit and their
fortune from their ſtudies, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temn
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0238000900:31"/>
literature and literary men. This
is a paradox of the heart, of which
the ſolution may appear difficult. Adrian
VI. obtained the pontificate, as the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
of his learning; and men of letters,
indulged the moſt golden hopes, at his
acceſſion; but on the contrary, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned
literature, and perſecuted ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents.
A living orator, whoſe chief
merit conſiſts in his literary powers, it has
been ſaid, performs in the preſent day,
the part of Adrian. Such men treat
ſcience, as a barbarous ſon, who ſpurns
at that parent, the milk of whoſe boſom
nurtured him in infancy, and whoſe
hand ſupported him in youth. A lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
friend obſerves, that the pope feared
leſt men of letters might ſhake the pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate,
and the orator, leſt they might
detect the errors of his politics; an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
which ſhews the political in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence
of authors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:0238000900:32"/>
Thoſe to whom nature has beſtowed
callous organs, and who are really inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
to the charms of fancy, or the force
of reaſon, we pardon; imbecillity muſt
be accepted as an apology for errors,
ſince it often is for crimes.</p>
            <p>How hard is the fate of the author,
who, when he once publiſhes, becomes
in the minds of all, whatever they chuſe
to make him!</p>

            <head>CHAP. III. Of Men of Letters.</head>
            <p>WE diſtinguiſh two kinds of Men
of Letters. Both alike make <hi>their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal
occupation</hi> to conſiſt in ſtudy; but
the one are induced from many concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring
circumſtances not to publiſh their
labours; and the other devote their life
to communicate their ſpeculations to the
world. Few men of letters reject the
honours of an author, out of modeſty;
but ſome are inert through terror, and
ſome through eaſe. The French (rich
in expreſſions relative to polite letters)
diſtinguiſh theſe learned and tranquil
ſtudents, by the happy title of <hi>littera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teurs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The popular notion of a man of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
is as unſettled, as unjuſt. It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
that becauſe a taylor makes a
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0238000900:34"/>
faſhionable coat, and a builder erects a
houſe according to modern taſte, a man
of letters muſt therefore produce a book,
adapted to the reigning mode. It is
not neceſſary that every man of letters
ſhould become an author, though it is
the indiſpenſible duty of an author to be
a man of letters. Some ſuppoſe that it
is ſufficient when they commence au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
to ſtudy what they write, it would
be advantageous if we write alſo what we
ſtudy; for without learning, few works
are valuable; and he who employs not a
uſeful cement, will ſee his brilliant edifice
ſcattered by the winds, in ſhining frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>The man of letters, is in general, a
more amiable character than the author.
His paſſions are more ferene, his ſtudies
more regular, his ſolitude more ſoothing.
He encounters no concealed or public
enemy, and his tranquillity is not a
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0238000900:35"/>
feather in the popular gale. Every diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery
he makes is a happy conqueſt;
every charm of taſte a ſilent enjoyment.</p>
            <p>Nor are ſuch characters as the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
imagine unuſeful in the republic of
letters. To the elegant leiſure of theſe
ſtudents we are indebted for many of the
ornaments of literature; and authors
themſelves have recourſe to theſe ſages,
as their conductors, and ſometimes as
their patrons. Theſe men of letters, like
guides over the Alps, though no travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
themſelves, warn the adventurous
explorer of impending danger, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct
him in his paſſage.</p>
            <p>No literary character is more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
amiable than ſuch a man of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.
The occupations he has choſen,
are juſtly called the ſtudies of humanity;
and they communicate to his manners,
his underſtanding, and his heart, that
refined amenity, that lively ſenſibility,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0238000900:36"/>
and that luminous acuteneſs which flow
from a cultivated taſte. He is an enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt;
but an enthuſiaſt for elegance. He
loves literature, like virtue, for the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony
it diffuſes over the paſſions; and
perceives, that like religion, it has the
ſingular art of communicating with an
unknown and future ſtate. For the love
of poſterity is cheriſhed by theſe men of
letters; and though they want the energy
of genius to addreſs the public, often for
that public, they labour in ſilence. It
is they who form public libraries; father
neglected, and nurture infant genius;
project and ſupport benevolent inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and pour out the philanthropy of
their heart, in that world, which they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to have forſaken.</p>
            <p>Their mild diſpoſitions firſt led them
into the province of literature. They
found in books an occupation congenial
to their ſentiments; labour without fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue;
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0238000900:37"/>
repoſe with activity; an employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
interrupted without inconvenience,
and exhauſtleſs without ſatiety. They
remain ever attached to their ſtudies;
for to give a new direction to life, would
require a vaſt effort, and of exertion they
are incapable. Their library and their
chamber are contiguous; and often in
this contracted ſpace, does the opulent
owner conſume his delicious hours.—His purſuits are ever changing, and he
enlivens the auſtere by the lighter ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies.
It was ſaid of a great hunter, that
he did not live, but hunted; and it may
be ſaid of the man of letters, that he
does not live, but meditates. He feels
that pleaſing anxiety, which zeſts deſire,
ariſing from irritative curioſity; and he
is that happy man who creates hourly
wants, and enjoys the voluptuouſneſs of
immediate gratification. The world pity
the man of letters inhumed among his
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:0238000900:38"/>
books, and their miſtaken wit inſcribes
on his door, <q rend="inline">here lies the body of our
friend!</q> Yet unthinking men are not
without excuſe; his pleaſures are ſilent
and concealed. Whatever is not tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quil
alarms; whatever is ſerene attracts;
he therefore becomes a Mecenas, but
never a Virgil; protects letters, but never
compoſes books; a lover of art, but never
an artiſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe men of letters form penetrating
critics, whoſe taſte is habitual, and whoſe
touch is firm and unerring. Criticiſm
is happily adapted to their powers of
action; becauſe in criticiſm they par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take
of the pleaſures of genius, without
the painful exertion of invention; and as
they are incapable of exerting invention,
and direct their ſtudies to form and
poliſh judgment, this latter faculty is
often more cultivated, and more vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,
than even that of men of genius.
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:0238000900:39"/>
Few writers attain to any perfection un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſiſted
by ſuch a connoiſſeur; the viva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
and enthuſiaſm of genius are indulged
often in violations of delicacy and truth;
and what the author wants is preciſely
what this critic can alone give. It is
not to be doubted that the familiar ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance
which exiſted between Racine,
Boileau, and Moliere, was moſt precious
to them. We know that they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
their arts of compoſition, and
ſtood centinels over each other with the
ſevereſt and moſt vigilant eye. Hence
that equable power, and finiſhed elegance
which diſtinguiſh their productions.—Corneille, who aſſociated with neither,
and like a ſultan would inſpire awe, by
concealing himſelf in ſolitary grandeur,
loſt theſe invaluable conferences, and
indulged genius careleſs of the raſures of
taſte. Hence his groſs defects and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities.
In England, where ſuch
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:0238000900:40"/>
an union has been rare, we can trace the
ſame effects. Pope, Swift, and Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke,
were of mutual advantage; Pope
had not been a philoſopher without the
aid of Bolingbroke; and Swift, an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior
poet, without the ſalutary coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
of Pope. Milton, ſevered from all
literary friends, has left in his ſublime
epics, too many traces of this ſeparation;
and it may be ſaid that his greateſt works
contain his greateſt blemiſhes. In the
finiſhed pieces of his youth, when he
had a critical eye at every hour on every
page, we find no want of corrective
touches. Churchill, a great and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
genius, with ſuch friends had not
only left his fatires more terfe, and more
harmohious, but had been incapable, in
his feebleſt hours, to have ſo frequently
compoſed, ſuch a ſeries of unconnected
and proſaic rhimes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="tcp:0238000900:41"/>
Often, by an excellent diſcernment,
theſe critics give a happy direction to
the powers of a young writer. Such
was the obſervation of Walſh, whoſe ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
to Pope, that correctneſs in our
poetry was the only means which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained
to diſtinguiſh himſelf, animated
the poet, to form that prominent and
beautiful feature in his poetical character.</p>
            <p>To prove their great utility to men of
genius, the following inſtance may ſerve.
Not always he whoſe abilities are capable
of adorning the page of hiſtory, is alike
capable of diſcovering the hidden and
perplexed tracks of learned reſearch.
Men of genius rarely read catalogues. To
whom is the philoſophic writer of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
hiſtory to have recourſe, but to ſuch
a man of letters? When Robertſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
writing his various hiſtories, he
was ignorant of his ſubject, and irreſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
in his deſigns. We had nearly loſt
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0238000900:42"/>
his elegant compoſitions. He confeſſed
in letters, which I have ſeen addreſſed to
Dr. Birch, that <q rend="inline">he had never acceſs to
copious libraries, nor an extenſive
knowledge of authors.</q> Dr. Birch,
who was an admirable <hi>litterateur,</hi> in his
anſwer has given a copious and critical
catalogue of proper authors, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
by valuable information, which is
acknowledged by our elegant hiſtorian
with warmth. It was certainly that kind
of neceſſary knowledge, which only the
learning of our ſcholar could ſupply, and
without which the project of Robertſon's
hiſtories muſt have periſhed in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.
Theſe ſtudents are therefore
uſeful members in the republic of letters,
and may be compared to thoſe ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
ſtreams, which flow into ſpacious
lakes, and which, though they flow in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſibly,
enlarge the waters which attract
the public eye.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="tcp:0238000900:43"/>
Sometimes theſe men of letters diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
themſelves by their productions;
but though theſe may be excellent, they
always rank in the inferior departments
of literature; and they rarely occupy
more than the firſt place in the ſecond
claſs. Their works are finiſhed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of taſte, or eccentric reſearches
of curioſity, ſeldom the fervid labours of
high invention. They are ingenious
men, not men of genius. If they pour
forth their effuſions in verſe, we may
have ſome delicate opuſcula; elaborate
beauties, but not of an original kind.
Such are many of our minor poets, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
for the refinements, but not
the powers of their art. They may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel
in happy verſions of a claſſic; of
which we have many admirable proofs.
Their inquiries may be learned, the fruits
of inceſſant labour, and long leiſure;
and they ſometimes chuſe for their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertations,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:0238000900:44"/>
ſertations, uncommon topics. Theſe
they treat often with ingenuity, but
chiefly enchant by a ſeductive manner.
They have a certain glow, like a gentle
and regular fire; but which never flaſhes
and flames like a powerful inventive
mind. It is rather the fire raiſed in a
forge, than burſting from a natural vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cano.
Such writers are the authors of
thoſe little eſſays, which are precious to
men of taſte; on painting, and on poetry;
on beauty, and on deformity. Elegant
minds, that imbue with elegance light
ſubjects; their ſtrokes are not continued
and grand, but occaſional and brilliant;
and if they rarely excite admiration by
new combinations of reflection or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery,
often paint, with a mellow warmth,
the beauty of ſentiment. In ſuch at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
they ſucceed; becauſe they ſelect
their ſubject, with the fondneſs of a
lover, and are familiar with its reſerved
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:0238000900:45"/>
graces. When unfortunately they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
higher topics, which require ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated
conceptions, and fervid genius, we
perceive their feeble energies. Such
writers, like the lark, muſt only riſe on
a playful wing, and reſound their favou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite
notes; but a man of genius, like a
hawk, elevates himſelf to diſcover the
country, and to dart on his prey.</p>
            <p>We ſhall elucidate theſe reflections by
the character of M. Sacy. He was
modeſt, ingenious, and ſenſitive. He
cultivated his talents with ardour, and
ſoothed the labours of the bar, with the
ſtudies of polite letters. He gave a
verſion of Pliny, which has not injured
the delicacy of the original. Admitted
to the circle of the Marchioneſs de Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,
he enjoyed the familiarity of men
of genius; and by the ſenſibility of his
heart, engaged the affections of the
Marchioneſs more forcibly than even the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0238000900:46"/>
genius of ſuperior minds. Animated by
his ſocial enjoyments, he wrote with
amenity, an intereſting Eſſay on Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.
In this he ſucceeded; for no mind
could be more ſuſceptible to it's ſoft and
domeſtic raptures. He afterwards com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
an Eſſay on Glory; but here he
did not ſucceed. A man of genius alone
can write on ſuch a topic; it requires a
mind that expands from the limits of a
family to a nation; from a nation to the
world; from the world to poſterity. Vaſt
and gigantic operation of the ſoul! This
is no tranquil ſentiment of taſte, but an
impetuous paſſion of genius. A Cicero,
not a Sacy, ſhould have written on
Glory; but Cicero did not feel more
exquiſitely than the amiable Sacy, on
the ſubject of Friendſhip.</p>

            <head>CHAP. IV. On ſome Characteriſtics of a Youth of Genius.</head>
            <p>I PROPOSE to ſketch ſome of the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes
which often attend a writer, or
an artiſt. Should my picture prove to be
a faithful repreſentation, my feelings will
diſpoſe me to lament my talent.</p>
            <p>To what an unknown height might an
adequate education elevate the human
character, if it were poſſible at his birth
to detect the future genius. The oſtrich
has the ſagacity to diſcover in it's eggs,
thoſe which are worthy of her genial
warmth, and ſeparates them from the
reſt, which would have proved ſterile to
the ſolicitous cares of a mother. It is not
thus with the human race. If we could
perceive the man of genius, in "the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
hour," we might ſelect him from
the croud, and nouriſh the giant, with
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0238000900:48"/>
the aliment a giant may be ſuppoſed to
require. At the age of twenty his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity
would appear; and he would have
performed at thirty whatever a Horace
or a Livy have done; while the vigour
of life yet remained to ſhew us ſomething
more exquiſite in fancy, and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicate,
yet clear in reaſoning, than at
preſent we can poſſibly conceive. But,
alas! it is only the romantic eye of the
poet, which can obſerve the graces
wreathing his cradle with myrtles. I quit
my fantaſtic man of genius to deſcend to
nature and to experience.</p>
            <p>It is rather ſingular that none but
princes, and monſters, have the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege
or exciting public curioſity at their
birth. A man of genius is dropt among
the people, and has firſt to encounter the
difficulties of ordinary men, without that
confined talent which is adapted to a
mean deſtimation. Parents, of honeſt
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0238000900:49"/>
diſpoſitions, are the victims of the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined
propenſity of a ſon, to a Virgil
or an Euclid; and the firſt ſtep into life
of a man of genius is diſobedience and
grief.</p>
            <p>The frequent ſituation of ſuch a man
is deſcribed with great ſimplicity, by the
aſtrologer Lilly, whether he were a man
of genius or not, in the curious memoirs
of his life. He there tells us, that having
propoſed to his father that he ſhould
try his fortune in London, where he
hoped his learning and his talents might
prove ſerviceable to him, he obſerves
that his father (who was incapable of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering
his latent genius in his ſtudious
diſpoſitions) very willingly conſented to
get rid of him, <q rend="inline">for I could not <hi>work,</hi>
drive the plough, or endure any coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
labour; my father oft would ſay I
was <hi>good for nothing.</hi>
               </q>—The fathers of
moſt of our men of genius have employed
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0238000900:50"/>
the ſame expreſſions as the father of
Lilly.</p>
            <p>An apparent indolence hangs about
contemplative genius; he loves the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of the body, and the activity of the
mind. It is known that moſt men of
great abilities in their puerile days, have
retired from the ſports of their mates,
and while they were folded up in their
little wild abſtractions, have appeared
dull to dunces. We often hear, from
the early companions or intimates of a
man of genius, that at ſchool he had
been remarkably heavy and unpromiſing;
but, in truth, he was only remarkably
penſive, and often pertinaciouſly aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous.
The great Boſſuet at ſchool would
never join with his young companions,
but preferred plodding over a book.—They revenged themſelves by a boyiſh
jeſt of calling him, <hi>bos ſuetus aratro,</hi> an ox
daily toiling in the plough. It is curious
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:0238000900:51"/>
to obſerve, that the young painters, to
ridicule the conſtant labours of Domeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chino
in his youth, did him the honour
to diſtinguiſh him alſo by the title of
great Ox. Chatterton offers ſtill a
better, though a more melancholy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
It is in this manner that one man
of genius generally reſembles another.</p>
            <p>This inaction of body, and activity of
mind, they retain throughout life. A
man of genius is rarely enamoured of
common amuſements. And the boy who
was unadroit at marbles, and refuſed ſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
the wall of an orchard, when a man,
ſeldom excels as an agile hunter, or an
elegant dancer. I am deſcribing the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm
of talent, not it's unintereſting
mediocrity. A man of genius is the
ſureſt teſtimony on this point. Let us
attend to the minſtrel of Dr. Beattie.<q>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:0238000900:52"/>
                  <l>Concourſe, and noiſe, and toil he ever fled,</l>
                  <l>Nor cared to mingle in the clamorous fray</l>
                  <l>Of ſquabbling imps; but to the foreſt ſped.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>The exploit of ſtrength, dexterity or ſpeed,</l>
                  <l>To him nor vanity, nor joy could bring.</l>
               </q>
               <q>
                  <l>Would Edwin this majeſtic ſcene reſign,</l>
                  <l>For aught the huntſman's puny craft ſupplies?</l>
               </q> I repeat, his mind alone has activity.—The fire ſide in the winter, and ſome
favourite tree in the ſummer, will be his
ſeats; his amuſements become ſtudies,
and his meditations are made in his
walks, as well as in his chair. Theſe
are ſome of the marks which diſtinguiſh
him from the man of the world.</p>
            <p>We have been able to diſcover this
diſpoſition in youthful genius; the ſame
characteriſes his age. It was thus when
Mecenas, accompanied by Virgil and
Horace, retired one day into the country,
the miniſter amuſed himſelf with a ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis-ball;
the two poets repoſed on a
vernal bank, beneath a delicious ſhade.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0238000900:53"/>
Pliny was pleaſed with the Roman mode
of hunting, which admitted him to ſit a
whole day with his tablets and ſtylus,
that (he ſays) if I return with empty
nets, my tablets may at leaſt be full.</p>
            <p>Among the inauſpicious circumſtances
which frequently attend the firſt exertions
of juvenile genius, is the want of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
and diſcernment, in the literary
man or artiſt whoſe regard and counſels
he ſolicits. Remote from the world of
taſte, he cultivates with ardour, but not
with art, talents which tremble in the
feebleneſs of infancy. When the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual
offspring is ſtruggling with pain,
and fear, into exiſtence, the hand that
ſhould aid it's delivery repels with an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural
barbarity. As Churchill ſays,
<q>They cruſh a Bard, juſt burſting from the ſhell!</q>
In theſe wild hours of youth and fancy,
the juvenile writer roves like an inſulated
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0238000900:54"/>
wanderer. Thrown on an enchanted iſle,
his ear liſtens with an artleſs impatience
for the celeſtial tones of an Ariel. It is
his unhappy fate to encounter a brutal
and malicious Caliban. Such has been
the ſituation of ſeveral men of genius
when they firſt addreſſed themſelves to
an unworthy man of letters for their
protector.</p>
            <p>Another unfriendly influence over
young genius is the want of diſcernment
in thoſe, who have the direction of their
talents. Pope was often heard to ſay,
that he could learn nothing from his
maſters, for they wanted ſagacity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
the bent of his genius; and the
preceptors of Thomſon, reprimanded the
poet, for being too poetical in ſome of
his exerciſes. The judicious Quintilian
obſerves, that it is not ſufficient that a
maſter inſtructs his ſcholars in ſcience;
but he ſhould alſo cultivate thoſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0238000900:55"/>
good qualities nature has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed
on each; to add, to thoſe which
are deficient, to correct ſome, and to
change others.</p>
            <p>It is a melancholy truth, that the
period at which men receive the colour
of their life, is that which is generally
leaſt regarded. When we moſt want
judgment, we have none; and age is
often paſſed only in lamentations over
youth. The eventful moment which
determines our future years, is min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled
and loſt among hours which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
be recalled. Phyſicians tell us,
that there is a certain point in youth, at
which our conſtitution takes it's form,
and on which the ſanity of life revolves.
The exiſtence of genius, experiences a
ſimilar dangerous moment. Taſte er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneouſly
directed, or genius unſubdued;
feebleneſs not invigorated, or vigour not
ſoftened; are the accidents which render
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:0238000900:56"/>
even a ſuperior mind defective in it's
beſt performances. Children by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence
of their parents become ricketty,
and all their life retain ſome trace of the
unhappy diſtortion of their limbs. The
predominant blemiſhes of an author, if
enquired into, will be found generally to
originate in their indulgence at a time
when they wanted a Quintilian, to deter
them by exerciſing ſome contrary quality
to that, of which they were vitiouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured.
The epigrammatic points, and
ſwelling thoughts of Young; the remote
conceits of Cowley, and the turgidity of
Johnſon, might probably have been
avoided by their authors, had the bent
of their mind at an early period, been
moulded by a critic hand. Few literary
vices are radical, unleſs permitted to
ſtrike deeply in the ſoil. Oaks, are but
ſaplings, till they are ſuffered to become
oaks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:0238000900:57"/>
The peculiarities of genius are often
derived from local habits, or accidental
circumſtances; and this remark ſhews
the unwearied vigilance neceſſary to be
obſerved in the progreſs and formation
of genius. Rembrandt is one inſtance;
his peculiarity of ſhade was derived from
the circumſtance of his father's mill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
light from an aperture at the top,
which habituated him afterwards to that
ſingular manner of broad ſhades. The
ſame analogy may be traced in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
intellect. A man of genius is often
determined to ſhape his mind into a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
form, by the books of his youth.
Dr. Franklin tells us, that when young,
and wanting books, he accidentally found
De Foe's Eſſay on Projects, from which
work he thinks impreſſions were derived
that afterwards influenced ſome of the
principal events of his life. It was by a
ſtudious peruſal of Plutarch's illuſtrious
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0238000900:58"/>
men, that Rouſſeau received that gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deur
of ſentiment which diſtinguiſhes all
his compoſitions, and created him that
romantic and ſenſitive being he ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained.</p>
            <p>If we except ſome rare inſtances, no
writer can diſplay his talents ſo indiſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably
that the world ſhall be conſcious of
his exalted genius, at an early period.
Du Bos and Helvetius have fixed that
great hour in the ſhort day of man, about
the age of thirty; and I recollect an old
Spaniſh writer lays it down as an axiom,
that no author ſhould publiſh a book
under the age of thirty-five. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
that many of our firſt geniuſes,
have not evinced their abilities till forty.
Some indeed ſpring ſuddenly like a
flower; while others expand gradually
like a tree. Some are like diamonds
which receive their fine poliſh from an ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:0238000900:59"/>
art, while others reſemble pearls
which are born with their beautiful luſtre.</p>
            <p>Is it enquired if during this long pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
a man of genius does not give ſome
evident marks of his future powers? I
anſwer that ſometimes he does; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
he does not; and ſometimes they
are dubious. They are frequently dubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,
becauſe the groſſeſt pedant attends
to his ſtudies, if not with the ſame af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection,
at leaſt with as much conſtancy
as the fineſt genius. Who can diſtinguiſh
between pertinacity and genius? It is,
perhaps, impoſſible to know if a young
ſtudent will be a compiler, or an hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>The firſt effuſions of a man of genius
may be ſo rude, as were thoſe of Swift
and Dryden, that no reaſonable hope
can be formed of his happy progreſs.
The juvenile productions of many great
writers evince nothing of that perfection
they afterwards obtained; and probably
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:0238000900:60"/>
Raphael when he firſt ſhadowed his rude
man, on his father's earthenware, had
not one ſtroke of that ideal beauty, which
one day his head was to conceive, and
his hand to attempt.</p>
            <p>Sometimes a ſuperior mind gives no
evidence of it's great powers; genius
may, like Aeneas, be veiled by a cloud,
and remain unperceived even by it's aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates;
as in the caſe of Goldſmith,
whom even his literary companions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
as a compiler, not as a writer of
taſte. Hume was conſidered for his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety
and aſſiduity, as capable of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
a good merchant; of Johnſon it
was ſaid, that he would never offend in
converſation, and of Boileau, that he had
no great underſtanding, but would ſpeak
ill of no one. Farquhar, who afterwards
joined to great knowledge of the world,
the livelieſt talents, was at college a
heavy companion, and unreaſonably dull.
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:0238000900:61"/>
Theſe, from numerous inſtances, will be
ſufficient. Again, when a ſuperior mind
evinces it's early genius, it is not always
done with all it's energy; we have ſeveral
who began verſifiers, and concluded poets.</p>
            <p>It happens, however, that ſometimes
genius unequivocally diſcovers itſelf in
the puerile age. Some appear to have
meditated on the art they love, on the
boſom of their nurſe; and they are pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and poets before they know the
names of their colours, and the fabric of
their verſe. Michael Angelo, as yet a
child, wherever he went, employed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
in drawing, which ſo much alarmed
his noble parents, who were fearful their
family might be diſhonoured by a man
of genius, that they mingled caſtigations
with their reprimands. Angelo relin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed
the pencil, but it was only to
take the bruſh. When he attempted
ſtatuary, his father bluſhed to think his
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:0238000900:62"/>
ſon was a ſtone-cutter. Angelo perſiſted,
and became a great man in oppoſition to
his noble progenitors. Velaſquez, a Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh
painter, when he performed his
ſchool taſks, filled them with ſketches
and drawings; and, as ſome write their
names on their books, his were known
by exhibiting ſpecimens of his genius.</p>
            <p>An obſervation may be introduced
here which is due to the parents of a man
of genius.</p>
            <p>We never read the biography of a
great character, whether he excelled in
letters, or the fine arts, without repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating
the domeſtic perſecution of thoſe,
who oppoſed his inclinations, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured
to unfeather the tender pinion
of juvenile genius. No poet but is rouſed
with indignation, at the recollection of
the Port Royal Society thrice burning
the poetical romance, which Racine at
length got by heart; no geometrician
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:0238000900:63"/>
but bitterly criminates the father of
Paſcal for not ſuffering him to read
Euclid, which he at length underſtood
without reading; no painter, but exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates
the parents of Angelo, for ſnatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the pencil from his hand, though at
length he became ſuperior to every artiſt.
All this is unjuſt.</p>
            <p>Let us place ourſelves in the ſituation
of a parent of a man of genius, and we
ſhall find another aſſociation of ideas
concerning him than thoſe we have at
preſent. We ſee a great man, they a
diſobedient child; we ſee genius, they
obſtinacy. The career of genius is rarely
that of fortune; and very often that of
contempt. Even in it's moſt flattering
aſpect, what is it, but plucking a few
brilliant flowers from precipices, while
the reward terminates in the honour?
The anxious parent is more deſirous of
his ſon's cultivating the low-lands where
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0238000900:64"/>
induſtry may reap, in ſilent peace, no
precarious harveſt. But I even confeſs
that many parents are themſelves not ſo
inſenſible to glory, but that they would
prefer a ſplendid poverty, to an obſcure
opulence; but who is to be certain that
a young man is obeying the ſolicitation
of true genius, or merely the fondneſs
for an art, in which he muſt never be an
artiſt? Literary men themſelves fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
are averſe to encourage the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
diſpoſitions of their children.</p>
            <p>It is certain that a love for any art, in
youth, is no evidence of genius. The
caſual peruſal of Spenſer, which might
produce a Cowley, has no doubt given
birth to a croud of unknown poets. We
have a conſiderable number of minor
artiſts, of all kinds, who never attain to
any degree of eminence, and yet in their
youth felt a warm inclination for their
art. If the impulſe of genius, and the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0238000900:65"/>
perſeverance of deſire, if conception and
imitation, could ever be accurately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
in the philoſophy of the mind,
it would be one of the moſt uſeful of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical
ſpeculations. But philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers
have not yet agreed of the nature
of genius, for while ſome conceive it to
be a gift; others think it an acquiſition.</p>
            <p>We now proceed to ſome reflections
on the friends of youthful genius.</p>
            <p>The friends of a young writer are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
prejudicial. To find a ſage
Quintilian in a private circle, is as rare
as to diſcover a ſilver mine in Devon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire;
it is ſuppoſed there are ſeveral,
but it is difficult to know where nature
has placed them.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It is a duty I owe as an individual, not to paſs over in ſilence the mention of Devonſhire, which I have long conſidered as the claſſical county of England. It has it's poets and it's antiquaries, it's muſicians and it's painters. There is, perhaps, in conſequence, that diffuſion of urbanity in the manners of many of it's chief inhabitants, which graces enlightened opulence. Devonſhire has produced more illuſtrious characters than I believe any other county. A Monteſquien and a Du Bos would attribute this to the felicity of the climate, where myrtles grow unſheltered in the open air. And perhaps the air which cheriſhes myrtles in our northern clime, may have no inconſiderable effect on men. The ſpeculation may not be merely fanci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; here the earth diſplays a more luxuriant herbage on a ſofter mould; the ſkies a brighter azure, and the airs blow with what poets call,
<q>The ſilky-ſoft favonian gale. <bibl>Young.</bibl>
                     </q>
A Devonſhire poet is the only Engliſh bard who has a right to tranſpoſe the epithets of Virgil in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions of Spring. It is a ſoil favourable to myrtles and artiſts.</p>

               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0238000900:66"/>
We may obſerve, that the productions
of taſte are much more unfortunate than
thoſe of reaſoning. Every man has a
tolerable degree of judgment, and with
a ſlight exertion, atchieves the compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion
of a piece of argument; but
taſte is of ſuch rarity, that a long life
may be paſſed by ſome, without ever
meeting with a perſon of that cultured
and ſure taſte, which can touch and feel
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:0238000900:67"/>
the public opinion, before the public
forms it's opinion.</p>
            <p>When a young writer's firſt eſſay is
ſhown, ſome, through mere inability of
cenſure, ſee nothing but beauties; others,
with equal imbecillity can ſee none; and
others, out of pure malice, ſee nothing
but faults. Few great writers have been
born in that fortunate and rare circle,
where every man has taſte, and ſome
have candour. A young writer, if he
ſuffers his mind to float from uncertainty
to uncertainty, will only loſe many years
before he diſcovers the imbecillity and
defective taſte of the narrow circle of
his critics.</p>
            <p>A young artiſt muſt baniſh deſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
even in the rudeſt efforts of art.
He muſt obey the fervid impulſe at the
coſt of the pleaſures of his age, and the
contempt of his aſſociates. It may alſo
be no improper habit to preſerve his ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venile
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0238000900:68"/>
compoſitions. By contemplating
them he may perceive ſome of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dominant
errors; reflect on the gradual
corrections; reſume an old manner more
happily, invent a new one from the old
he had neglected; and often may find
ſomething ſo fine, among his moſt irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
productions, that it may ſerve to
embelliſh his moſt finiſhed compoſitions.
I cannot but apply to this ſubject, a
happy ſimile of Dryden, which a young
writer, in the progreſs of his ſtudies,
ſhould often recollect.<q>
                  <l>As thoſe who unripe veins in mines explore,</l>
                  <l>On the rich bed, again, the warm turf lay,</l>
                  <l>Till time digeſts the yet imperfect ore,</l>
                  <l>And knows it will be gold another day.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Let him therefore at once ſupply the
marble, and be himſelf the ſculptor; he
muſt learn to hew out, to form, and to
poliſh his genius. He muſt appeal from
a contracted circle, to the public; and
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0238000900:69"/>
throughout life, muſt hold this as a
maxim, if he would preſerve the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary
tranquillity to purſue his ſtudies,
that the opinion of an individual muſt be
accounted as nothing; not even if this
opinion ſhould appear in print. Helve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius
juſtly obſerves, what does the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion
of any individual mean? Only,
that if favourable, he entertains the ſame
ideas as myſelf; and if unfavourable,
that we differ.</p>
            <p>Who but the public can arbitrate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
an artiſt and his critic? Should
even the cenſures of the critic be juſt,
and the artiſt notwithſtanding pleaſe, it
is an additional evidence, that he is
among the greateſt artiſts. It is thus
with Shakeſpeare and Churchill.</p>
            <p>If ſeveral of our firſt writers had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
to the ſentiments of their friends,
we ſhould have loſt ſome of our moſt
precious compoſitions. The friends of
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0238000900:70"/>
Thomſon could diſcern nothing but
faults in his early productions, not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting
his ſublime Winter! This poet
of humanity has left a vindictive epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gram
againſt one of theſe friends, and it
is perhaps the only ill-natured lines, he
ever wrote. He came with impatience
to London, publiſhed, and made his
genius known. Voltaire, when his Brutus
was unſucceſsful, was adviſed not to turn
his attention to the ſtage. He replied to
his friends by writing Zara, Alzire, and
Mahomet. The Mirror when publiſhed
in Edinburgh was "faſtidiouſly" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived;
the authors appealed from Edin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh
to London, and they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
the literary pleaſures of thouſands!</p>
            <p>It is dangerous for a young writer to
reſign himſelf to the opinions of his
friends; it is alike dangerous to paſs
them with inattention. What an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſment!
If he has not an excellent
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0238000900:71"/>
judgment he will not know what to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
and what to receive of thoſe varying
opinions; and if he has an excellent
judgment, he wants little of their aid.</p>
            <p>A young writer muſt long and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently
ſtudy his great models without
venturing on the vanity of criticiſm. He
who begins to analyſe before he is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with the nature of his materials,
like an ignorant chymiſt, may ſuppoſe
he is making experiments, when he is in
the act of injuring his untutored and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious
hand. He muſt read for many
years his authors, as ſome the goſpels,
with the ſame faith and the ſame admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.
For what he once wanted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
reliſh, he will come to admire,
and what he admires he will imitate. He
cannot too often peruſe thoſe many criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
performances which the philoſophical
taſte of the age has produced. It ſhould
be conſidered, that by reading an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0238000900:72"/>
critic, he receives the knowledge of
many years in a few hours. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
of art are tardy, and criticiſm
ſupplies this deficiency. The more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive
an artiſt's knowledge of what has
been done, the more vaſt will be his
powers in knowing what to do. Thoſe
who do not read criticiſm, will not even
merit to be criticiſed. Yet we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reflecting
ſtudents who inquire of the
utility of criticiſm? Nothing may be
of happier conſequence than a habit of
comparing his thoughts and his ſtyle
with the compoſitions of his maſters. If
in the compariſon, the ſilent voice of
ſentiment exclaims in his heart, <q rend="inline">I alſo
am a painter,</q> it is not improbable
that the young artiſt may become a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regio.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>This ſentiment is nobly expreſſed by Monteſquieu in the cloſe of his preface to his great work on laws. There he ſays, with a conſciouſneſs of mind—<q rend="inline">I do not think that I have been totally deficient in point of genius. When I have ſeen what ſo many great men, both in France and Germany, have writ be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, I have been loſt in admiration, but I have not loſt my courage. I have ſaid with Corregio, Ed Io anche ſon Pittore.</q>

               </note> If in meditating on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:0238000900:73"/>
of Rouſſeau, he recollects that he
has experienced the ſame ſenſations from
the ſame circumſtances, and that he has
encountered the ſame difficulties, and
vanquiſhed them by the ſame means; he
may hope one day that the world will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
him as their benefactor. If in a

ſees his ſentiments ſometimes anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
and in the tumult of his mind as it
comes in contact with their's, new ones
ariſe, let him proſecute his ſtudies, with
ardour and intrepidity, with the fair
hope, that one day, he may acquire the
talents of a fine writer. Let him then,

            <head>CHAP. V. Of the domeſtic Life of a Man of Genius.</head>
            <p>IF we contemplate the domeſtic life of
a man of genius, we rarely obſerve him
placed in a ſituation congenial to his
purſuits.</p>
            <p>The houſe of a man of letters ſhould
be the ſanctuary of tranquillity and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue.
The moral duties he inculcates,
the philoſophic ſpeculations he forms,
and the refinements of taſte he diſcloſes,
ſhould be familiar to his domeſtic circle.
It is then he is great without effort, and
eloquent without art.</p>
            <p>The porch and the academy of the
ancients muſt have communicated an
enthuſiaſm the moderns can never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.
In the golden age of Greece,
a Demoſthenes ſaw himſelf encompaſſed
by future orators; and Plato liſtened to
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0238000900:75"/>
the plaudits of future philoſophers. It
was a moment of delicious rapture, not
felt in the ſolitary meditations of the
modern philoſopher, in whoſe mind ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
ariſe cold and artificial compared
to their burſt of ſentiment and their fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of paſſion.</p>
            <p>Yet a virtuous citizen, amidſt the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution
of manners, may give to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
a Roman auſterity, and diſplay
the ſublime in life, as well as in compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.
He may be ſeated at an attic
ſupper, and,
<q>Enjoy, ſpare feaſt! a radiſh and an egg.
<bibl>Cowper.</bibl>
               </q>
Nor is ſuch a purity of manners incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
with refined paſſions, and delicacy
of ſentiment; a penetrating glance, a
tender preſſure, a ſilent ſmile, may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
into his heart thoſe genuine emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
which are ever wanted and never
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0238000900:76"/>
found at tables more ſplendidly profuſe,
and more elegantly crouded. A vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
parent, a congenial friend, and a
female ſuſceptible of a kindred enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſm,
are perhaps the utmoſt number
of happy companions, which a fortunate
man could ever aſſemble around him.</p>
            <p>Is he deprived of theſe ſocial conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
like Johnſon, he calls thoſe whoſe
calamities have exiled them from ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety;
and his houſe is an aſſemblage of
the blind, the lame, and the poor. In
the ardour of his emotions, he diſcovers
that a word is wanting in the vocabulary
of humanity, and like the Abbè de Saint
Pierre, has the honour of fixing a new
word in the language; a word that
ſerves to explain his own actions—<hi>Bien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faiſance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>His look is ſerene, for ſtudy, not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune,
forms his ſole occupation; and
accident cannot injure the ſtability of his
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0238000900:77"/>
ſoul, for virtue has long been a habit.
Is it enquired why this man appears an
anomalous being among his fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens?—Becauſe he is the contemporary
of the greateſt men. He paſſes his morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
with Cicero and Demoſthenes, and
gives his nights to Socrates and Plato.</p>
            <p>Such an one is the living exemplar of
that ſublime morality which we learn
with our latin at ſchool, and which, when
we come into the world, we conſider,
like our latin, to be merely a dead lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage.</p>
            <p>He renders poverty illuſtrious, and
proves that every man may be indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.
But we would be independent
only, in commanding ſlaves. He who
lives like a Spartan in voluptuous Sybaris,
is, however, independent; and this age
has produced men who paſſed the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours
of youth in a philoſophical ſeverity,
and ſtudied (as ſome ſtudy a language)
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0238000900:78"/>
to become great characters. Such were
Franklin and Elliot, Chatham and
Hume!</p>
            <p>The actions and ſtudies of ſuch men
are not the only utility they beſtow on
the world; they leave ſomething of a
more diffuſive energy; they leave the
eternal memory of their CHARACTER;
they leave to remoteſt poſterity their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal
veſtiges, while virtuous youth
contemplates them with enthuſiaſm, and
follows them with confidence.</p>
            <p>We cloſe any further reflections on the
character of a philoſophic writer, and
reſtrain ourſelves to obſervations more
obvious, and to facts more uſual.</p>
            <p>Too often we ſee the ſublimeſt minds,
and the tendereſt hearts, ſublime and
tender only in their productions. They
are not ſurrounded by perſons of ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous
ideas, who are alone capable of
drawing forth their virtues and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0238000900:79"/>
as the powers of the magnet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main
dormant unleſs applied to particles
capable of attraction. We hear of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
great men, that they were undutiful
ſons—becauſe they diſpleaſed their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
in becoming great men—that they
were diſagreeable companions—becauſe
dullneſs or impertinence wearied—that
they were indifferent huſbands—becauſe
they were united to women who did no
honour to the ſex. Theſe are ordinary
accuſations, ever received, while it is
forgotten that an accuſation is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
a crime.</p>
            <p>It were not difficult to deſcribe the
domeſtic life of moſt men of genius, and
to obſerve that their inmates have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
their Lares but rugged deities. I
would never draw concluſions from par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
circumſtances, ſuch as, that Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon
deſcribes his lady under the
character of Oceana, and Steele deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ates
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0238000900:80"/>
his wife under that of Miſs Prue;
the one was a ſtormy ocean, and the
other a ſtagnated ſtream. But I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark
that many of the conſpicuous
blemiſhes of ſome of our great compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
may reaſonably be attributed to
the domeſtic infelicities of their authors.
The deſultory life of Camoens probably
occaſioned the want of connection in his
Epic; Milton's diſtracted family thoſe
numerous paſſages which eſcaped era<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure;
and Cervantes may have been led,
through the haſte of publication, into
thoſe little ſlips of memory obſervable
in his Satirical Romance. The beſt
years of Meng's life were embittered by
the harſhneſs of his father; and it is
probable that this domeſtic perſecution,
from which he was at length obliged to
fly, gave him thoſe moroſe and ſaturnine
habits which he ever afterwards retained.
Of Alonſo Cano, a celebrated Spaniſh
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0238000900:81"/>
painter, it is obſerved by Mr. Cumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
that he would have carried his art
much higher, had not the unceaſing per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution
of the inquiſitors deprived him
of that tranquillity which is ſo neceſſary
to the very exiſtence of the fine arts.
Our poetry had probably attained to it's
acmè, before Pope, had the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
circumſtances of Dryden not occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
his inequalities, his incorrectneſs,
and his copious page.</p>
            <p>It is therefore an intereſting obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
for a man of letters, and an artiſt,
to liberate himſelf early from domeſtic
anxieties. Let him, like Rouſſeau, leave
the rich financier, (though he might be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
one himſelf,) ſell his watch, and
iſſue from the palace, in independence
and enthuſiaſm. He muſt alſo, if ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary,
like Crebillon, be ſatisfied with
the reſpectable ſociety of a conſiderable
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0238000900:82"/>
number of grey hounds,<note n="*" place="bottom">Crebillon paſſed much of his life in ſolitude, and pleaſed himſelf with the company of a dozen fine large dogs in his room, which rendered the approach to our poet as formidable to the timorous, as to the delicate.</note> The moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
paſſion for glory can alone ſtimulate
to ſuch a retirement; and indeed it is
only in ſolitude that the moſt eminent
geniuſes have been formed. Solitude is
the nurſe of enthuſiaſm, and enthuſiaſm
is the parent of genius. Literary ſolitude
ſhall therefore form our next object for
ſpeculation.</p>

            <p>MEN of Letters are reproached with
an extreme paſſion for retirement; and
ſome of the warmeſt philanthropiſts are
calumniated as haters of the human race.</p>
            <p>Literary Retirement can have no guilt,
even if merely paſſed, in the uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
examination of the treaſures of
literature. When taſte is formed, and
curioſity becomes habitual, the mind
will not forego gratifications at once ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile
and exquiſite. If it is ſaid why the
ſame ingenuity of mind, that loves to
trace the cauſe, and to arrange the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects,
is not turned to the objects of the
times, and thus render itſelf of more
apparent utility, I anſwer, that in the
contemplation of exiſting ſcenes, the
mind finds not the ſame gratification as
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0238000900:84"/>
in thoſe of the paſt. What is preſent is
not yet terminated; the folly of the age
is not yet folly, and judgment pauſes
over myſterious paſſions. But in the
hiſtory of the human mind, to be calmly
traced in the volumes of other times,
every illuſion is diſſipated; and we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the ſame pleaſure, as the ſpectator
who beholds the cataſtrophe of the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gedy,
or the comedy, which excited his
curioſity. The hiſtory of the paſt yields
a concluſion, and therefore a perfection
which cannot accompany that of the
preſent.</p>
            <p>The horizon of Reſearch is illimitable,
and the diſcoveries of Truth are infinite.
New materials ſerve but as the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of others; we do not remain ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied
with building a houſe, a palace,
or a ſtreet; but by impereeptible gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations
we erect a city.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="tcp:0238000900:85"/>
This, perhaps, may ſerve as an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
for Men of Letters, who conſume
their days with innocence and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy;
but who are frequently conſidered
to withdraw from duties which thoſe
who live to buſtle, and thoſe who buſtle
to live, are very far themſelves from
practiſing. An active virtue, which in
the preſent day may be called heroiſm,
is frequently the amiable child of Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,
but rarely the companion of the
buſy and the gay.</p>
            <p>I propoſe to ſhew the neceſſity, the
pleaſures, and the inconveniencies of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude,
to thoſe who enlighten the world
from the obſcurity of their retirement.</p>
            <p>Solitude is indiſpenſable for literary
purſuits. Every poet repeats,<q>Carmina ſeceſſum ſcribentis et otia quaerunt.</q> No conſiderable work has yet been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
but it's author, like an ancient
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0238000900:86"/>
magician, retired firſt to the grove or
the cloſet, to invocate his ſpirits. Every
compoſition of genius is the production
of enthuſiaſm; and while enthuſiaſm
agitates the mind, the ſolitude of a man
of letters reſembles a ſcene of antient
Greece; a grove becomes ſacred, and
in every retired ſpot a divinity appears.</p>
            <p>But it's enchantments are reſerved
alone for him. When he ſighs for the
intellectual decencies, and the grace of
fancy, and languiſhes in an irkſome ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude
among crouds, that is the moment
to fly into ſecluſion and meditation. He
alone experiences the delights of that
day, which is compreſſed into a few
hours. Where can he indulge, but in
ſolitude, the delicious romances of his
ſoul? And where but in ſolitude can he
occupy himſelf in uſeful dreams by night,
and when the morning riſes, fly, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
interruption, to his unfiniſhed la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours?
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:0238000900:87"/>
He finds many ſecret pleaſures,
and ſome glowing anticipations. There
is a ſociety, in the deepeſt ſolitude, to
which a poliſhed mind ſprings with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour;
it embraces a thouſand congenial
ſentiments, and mingles with a thouſand
exquiſite ſenſations. The ſolitude of
retirement to the frivolous preſents a vaſt
and dreary deſert; but to the man of
genius it blooms like the enchanted gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
of Armida.</p>
            <p>Such is the ſituation in which the poet
of ſentiment and nature, amidſt the
works of his maſters, exclaims<q>Firſt of your kind, Society divine!
<bibl>Thomſon.</bibl>
               </q> In this ſtillneſs of ſoul, nature ſeems
more beautiful, and more vaſt. We
obſerve men of genius, in public ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſighing for this ſolitude; it is
there only they feel their ſuperiority,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0238000900:88"/>
and live in a future age. Cicero was
uneaſy amidſt applauding Rome, and he
has diſtinguiſhed his numerous works
by the titles of his various villas, where
they were compoſed. It will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
that Voltaire had talents and a taſte
for ſociety; yet he not only withdrew
by intervals, but at one period of his
life paſſed five years in the moſt ſecret
ſecluſion, and perſeverance of ſtudy.
Monteſquieu quitted the brilliant circles
of Paris for his books, his meditations,
and for his immortal work; and for this
he was ridiculed by the gay triflers he
relinquiſhed. Harrington, to compoſe
his Oceana, ſevered himſelf from the
ſociety of his friends, and was ſo wrapt
in abſtraction, that he was pitied as a
lunatic.</p>
            <p>A heart thus diſpoſed, tears itſelf,
with reluctance, from it's contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
and comes into ſociety without a
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0238000900:89"/>
poſſibility of receiving, or producing it's
pleaſures. It may be urged that ſeveral
men of genius have found no difficulty
to level themſelves to ordinary under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings.
I have heard that Hume
found great delight in the ſociety of two
old maids, at his evening whiſt; Fonte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelle
and La Motte would patiently
liſten to the frivolous and the dull; but
Fontenelle and La Motte, whoſe genius
our hiſtorian's greatly reſembled, were
two ingenious Frenchmen, celebrated
for their politeneſs and their wit, not
for their ſenſibility and enthuſiaſm.</p>
            <p>When a man of letters ſeeks the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations
of ſociety, he would reſt a
mind enfeebled with one continued pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit;
or exerciſe it by ſuffering it to take
thoſe infinite directions which the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities
of converſation offer. If it is wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried,
the ſimpleſt actions pleaſe; it is a
child that would ſport with flowers and
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:0238000900:90"/>
pebbles; if it iſſues in all it's force, it
is an athlet that leaps in the arena, and
calls for an adverſary. It is Montaigne
ſporting with his cat, or Johnſon main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining
a theſis amidſt his marvelling
friends.</p>
            <p>In either caſe, ordinary ſociety offers
no charms, and can never be charmed.
A feeble mind knows not to unbend,
becauſe it was never yet extended; nor
can it elevate itſelf becauſe the ſoul, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
to the figure of Plato, has no
wings.</p>
            <p>Thus the mind of genius feels a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
irritation in the croud. Let us
attend to the expreſſions of genius,
which can beſt deſcribe it's peculiar ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilities.
Petrarch frequently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew
to his immortal valley, alike diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted
with the groſſneſs of the vulgar,
and the frivolity of the courtier; he
could not patiently ſuffer that Being, whom
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0238000900:91"/>
he calls 'un huom del vulgo!' Cowley
regarded the common people as he did
beaſts, and was diſpleaſed as much with
what he calls <q rend="inline">the great as the little
vulgar.</q> Among the perverted images
of a living orator, is that <q rend="inline">of the hoofs
of the ſwiniſh multitude,</q> and a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable
ancient prefers the ſociety of his
dog to ſuch men. Fools (cries Du Clos)
reconcile men of genius to each other;
from the impoſſibility of living with
fools. And to cloſe our teſtimonies, with
a fine expreſſion from Milton,
<q>
                  <l>Among unequals what ſociety</l>
                  <l>Can ſort, what harmony or true delight?</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The interruption of viſitors have been
feelingly lamented by men of letters.—The mind, occupied in maturing it's
ſpeculations, feels the approach of the
viſitor by profeſſion, as the ſudden gales
of an eaſtern blaſt, paſſing over the bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0238000900:92"/>
of ſpring. We are afraid, ſaid
ſome of the viſitors to Baxter, that we
break in upon your time. To be ſure
you do, replied the diſturbed and blunt
ſcholar. Urſinus was laborious in his
literary avocations, and to hint as gently
as he could to his friends, that he was
avaricious of time; he placed an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
over the door of his ſtudy, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring,
that if any one chuſed to remain,
they muſt join in his labours. The ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
Melancthon, incapable of a harſh
expreſſion, when he received theſe idle
viſits, only noted down the time he had
expended, that he might reanimate his
induſtry, and not loſe a day. Among
the diſturbers of domeſtic tranquillity,
may be claſſed thoſe unhappy wanderers
who beſiege the houſes of their neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours,
and like the barbarian ſoldier,
enter the apartment of an Archimedes,
and murder him in the midſt of his
ſtudies.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:0238000900:93"/>
But I am how to ſketch a different
picture of literary ſolitude.</p>
            <p>Zimmerman has compoſed an elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate
work on Solitude, in a general
manner. His ſentiments are glowing,
and perhaps they are dangerous. Of
ſolitude, men of genius muſt always be
ſufficiently enamoured, without having
read that ſeducing deſcription of it's
ſublime pleaſures. Let us not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
forget nature in enthuſiaſm. A
man of genius, though he addreſſes poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity,
has ſenſibilities and deſires which
can only be gratified by his contempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raries.
When great minds cannot readily
find that in the world they ſeek, they
haſten into ſecluſion. The craving void
remains unfilled; and for him who ſighs
for popularity in ſolitude, every hour
ſharpens deſire, and aggravates diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:0238000900:94"/>
The ſolitude which is ſought by the
young ſtudent is not borne without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining.
To tame the fervid wildneſs of
youth, to the ſtrict regularities of ſtudy,
is a ſacrifice which requires all the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm
of the ſincereſt votary. The
Academic Bower is not without it's rainy
days. Milton, not apt to vent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints,
appears to have felt this irkſome
period of life. He employs theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions
in the preface to Smectymnus.
<q rend="inline">It is but juſtice, not to defraud of due
eſteem the <hi>weariſome labours</hi> and <hi>ſtudious
watchings,</hi> wherein I have ſpent, and
<hi>tired out,</hi> almoſt a whole youth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps ſolitude in a later period of
life, or rather the neglect which attends
that ſolitude, is felt with more ſenſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
It was thus that Cowley, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt
for rural ſecluſion, in his retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
called himſelf "the melancholy
Cowley;" and Mr. Maſon has judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:0238000900:95"/>
transferred the ſame epither to
Gray. Can we read his letters, and not
feel it's juſtneſs? we lament alſo, the
loſs of Cowley's correſpondence, through
the miſtaken notion of Sprat, a loſs cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly
as invaluable, as irrecoverable.
Theſe are the beſt memoirs of a man's
heart; the regiſter of his feelings. But
Shenſtone has filled his pages with the
cries of an amiable heart that bleeds in
the oblivion of ſolitude. In one of his
letters, are theſe melancholy expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions:
"Now I am come from a viſit,
every little uneaſineſs is ſufficient to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce
my whole train of melancholy
conſiderations, and to make me utterly
diſſatisfied with the life I now lead, and
the life I foreſee I ſhall lead. I am an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry,
and envious, and dejected, and fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic,
and diſregard all preſent things as
becomes a madman to do. I am infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely
pleaſed (though it is a gloomy joy)
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:0238000900:96"/>
with the application of Dr. Swift's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,
that he is forced to die in a rage,
like a poiſoned rat in a hole." Without
exciting ſimilar paſſages in proſe, let
the lover of ſolitude muſe on it's picture
throughout the year, in the following
ſtanza.<q>
                  <l>Tedious again to curſe the drizzling day!</l>
                  <l>Again to trace the wintery tracks of ſnow!</l>
                  <l>Or ſoothed by vernal airs again ſurvey,</l>
                  <l>The ſelf-ſame hawthorns bud, and cowſlips blow.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Swift's letters paint a terrifying picture
of ſolitude, and at length his deſpair
cloſed with idiotiſm. The amiable
Greſſet, could not ſport with the bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
wings of his fancy, without ſome
querulous expreſſions of an irkſome ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
In his "Epiſtle to his Muſe,"
he thus exquiſitely paints the ſituation
of men of genius.<q>
                  <l>—Je les vois, victimes du genie,</l>
                  <l>Au foible prix d'un eclat paſſager,</l>
                  <l>Vivre iſolès ſans jouir de la vie.</l>
               </q> 
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0238000900:97"/>
And afterwards he adds,<q>Vingt ans d'Ennuis pour quelque jours de gloire!</q>
            </p>
            <p>The following anecdote may amuſe
the reader. When Menage was attacked
by ſome, and abandoned by others, in
a ſplenetic humour, he retreated into the
country, and gave up his famous Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curiales,
when the literati aſſembled at
his houſe. He expected to find that
tranquillity in the country which he had
frequently deſcribed in his verſes; but,
as he was only a poetical plagiariſt, it is
not wonderful that he was greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed.
Some malicious perſon hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
killed his pigeons, it gave him more
vexation than his critics. He haſtened
his return to Paris. It is better, he
cried, ſince we are born to ſuffer, to feel
only reaſonable ſorrows.</p>
            <p>It is reaſonably to be ſuſpected, that
he only prefers ſolitude, who cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0238000900:98"/>
his wiſhes in ſociety. I have
not yet been able to diſcover a great ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
who, courted by an attentive world,
perſiſted in his retirement. Voltaire,
when his reputation was not yet eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
ſees only happineſs in ſecluſion;
all his letters abound with quotations
from the poets, of the raptures of ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.
When his tragedies gave him ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrity,
then his letters ſound a different
ſtrain, and he heſitates not to declare to
his friends, how unhappy was his ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
conſtrained to remain in ſolitude
while his tragedies were acting every
night at Paris.</p>
            <p>To have ſtood inſulated amidſt ſociety
has been the hard fate of ſome whoſe
preſence would have embelliſhed the
moſt ſelect. This neglect of the world
has inſpired their compoſitions with a
querulous ſenſibility; a ſoftening charm,
that whatever it may have coſt their
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0238000900:99"/>
feelings, renders their beautiful lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
more intereſting. The tender
ſhades of melancholy throw a grace
amidſt the brilliant lights of their fancy.
It is ſaid that the nightingale, with a
thorn in her breaſt, does not ſing with
a leſs enchanting melody. Is not the
voice of the heart heard in theſe verſes?<q>
                  <l>Poor moraliſt! and what art thou?</l>
                  <l>A ſolitary fly.</l>
                  <l>No hive haſt thou of hoarded ſweets.</l>
                  <bibl>Gray.</bibl>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>On the whole it may be ſaid, that a
great experience of the world, united
with a great love of virtue, render ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
deſirable. When they exiſt ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately,
it becomes irkſome. A great
experience of the world, without virtue,
will pine in ſolitude, to exert it's talent
on thoſe who are ſimple and unexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.
A great love of virtue, without
experience of the world, forms in the
leiſure of retirement, thoſe utopian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,
which it pants to call into exiſtence.</p>

            <head>CHAP. VII. On the Meditations and Converſations of
Men of Genius.</head>
            <p>A CONTINUITY of attention is one of
the grand characteriſtics of genius, and
in proportion to the degree of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſeneſs
of abſtraction are it's powers
often obtained. A work on ABSTRAC<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TION,
or the ART OF MEDITATION, is a
deſideratum. It would be a valuable
preſent to all, and might prove of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
advantage to him, who never had
more than one ſolitary idea.</p>
            <p>Among the regulations of this art, it
might not be improper to recommend
darkneſs. Several profound thinkers,
could never purſue the operations of
their minds, in the diſtraction of light,
when the leaſt remiſſion of thought pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces
a new object, and an extraneous
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0238000900:101"/>
idea. Mallebranche and others, cloſed
their ſhutters when they wiſhed to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtract
themſelves. That darkneſs is a
great aid to thinking, would appear from
what moſt men experience relative to
their thoughts during the night. The
ſilence and obſcurity of that time are
moſt friendly to abſtraction, and often
when ſleep forſakes us, and we muſe, our
thoughts ſurpriſe by the vividneſs of
fancy. If at that moment, in the words
of one of our moſt elegant poems, we
do not,
<q>Snatch the faithleſs fugitives to light.
<bibl>Pleaſures of Memory.</bibl>
               </q>
If Memory does not chain the children
of Imagination, they are ſcattered, and
fly the beams of the morning. Our mind,
among a tumultuous croud, ſuddenly
finds itſelf forſaken and ſolitary. It is at
that unregarded period of our exiſtence,
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:0238000900:102"/>
that men of moderate capacities feel an
extraordinary expanſion, and men of
genius ſome of their moſt original com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binations.
Yet then, how few, like Pope,
have an old woman at hand, to bring
pens and paper!</p>
            <p>Men of genius muſt conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
as ſo many vigilant guardians of
the infinity of nature. So treacherous is
Recollection, and ſo capriciouſly does
Memory ſupply her treaſures to Fancy,
that ſome of the happieſt conceptions of
genius are fortuitous; they come, we do
not know from where, and ſpring we
do not know how; but if not ſeiſed at
the moment of perception, they are like
autumnal clouds, whoſe romantic figures
diſſolve, as we gaze.</p>
            <p>It is ſaid that collections have been
made, ſmall ones no doubt, of bon mots
by perſons who never ſaid but one good
thing; it would form no incurious miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellany,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0238000900:103"/>
if it were poſſible to ſelect ſome
of thoſe thoughts of great thinkers,
which were never written. We ſhould
find many admirable ones. The painters
have this advantage over writers, their
ſlighteſt ſketches are immediately ſieſed,
and become as valuable to poſterity as
their more complete labours.</p>
            <p>The ART OF MEDITATION is an art
which we may inceſſantly exerciſe, and
need not remit for long intervals of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
as every other art. And yet, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
the facility of practice, and
we ſhould ſuppoſe the hourly ſkill we
might obtain, every manual art, is
brought to perfection, while of the art
of the mind, millions are yet ignorant
of the firſt rudiments. Quintilian finely
obſerves, that men of genius command
it at all times, and in all places. In
their walks, at table, and at aſſemblies,
they turn their eye inwards, and can
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0238000900:104"/>
form an artificial ſolitude. The powers
of abſtraction, which ſome men have
exerciſed, appear to puny thinkers to
have ſomething of the marvellous; in
the regions of the mind, they look like
ſo many Gullivers among a million of
Lilliputians. Of Socrates it is ſaid, that
he would frequently remain an entire day
and night in the ſame attitude, abſorbed
in meditation; and why ſhall we doubt
this when we know that La Fontaine
and Thomſon, Deſcartes and Newton,
experienced the ſame abſtraction? In
Cicero's Treatiſe on Old Age, Cato
praiſes Caius Sulpitius Gallus, who,
when he ſat down to write in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
was ſurpriſed by the evening, and
when he took up his pen in the evening,
was ſurpriſed by the appearance of the
morning. Of the Italian poet Marini,
it is ſaid, that he was once ſo abſorbed
in the reviſion of his Adonis, that he
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0238000900:105"/>
ſuffered his leg to be burnt, for ſome
time, without any ſenſibility.</p>
            <p>This enthuſiaſm renders every thing
that ſurrounds us as diſtant as if an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe
interval ſeparated us from the
ſcene. It is related of a modern aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomer,
that one ſummer night when he
was withdrawing to his chamber, the
brightneſs of the heavens ſhewed a phe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomenon.
He paſſed the whole night in
obſerving it, and when they came to
him early in the morning and found him
in the ſame attitude, he ſaid, like one
who had been recollecting his thoughts
for a few moments, <q rend="inline">it muſt be thus;
but I'll go to bed before 'tis late.</q> He
had gazed the entire night in meditation
and did not know it.</p>
            <p>Enthuſiaſm, which is active genius,
preſents an object more ſingular than
genius in it's quieſcent meditations. The
flowing ſtream is loſt in an ocean rolling
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0238000900:106"/>
impetuouſly. This phrenzy of abſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and wonderful agitation of the
ſoul, is required not only in the fine arts,
but wherever a great exertion muſt be
employed. It was felt by Gray in his
loftieſt excurſions; and is it not the
ſame power which impels the villager,
when to aſtoniſh his rivals, in a conteſt
for leaping, he retires back ſome ſteps,
ferments his mind to a fervent reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and clears the eventful bound? It
was a maxim with one of our ancient and
great Admirals, in the reign of Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth,
that a height of paſſion, amounting
to phrenzy, was neceſſary to qualify a
man for that place. A variety of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
might be given of this fine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm,
which has ever accompanied
the artiſt, at the moment he produced
excellencies.</p>
            <p>It has ſometimes ariſen into a delirium.
The ſoul of Rouſſeau was bewildered in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0238000900:107"/>
the deluſions of fancy, and the momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
diſpoſitions of his mind coloured
exterior objects. Petrarch in that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
narrative of a viſion in which Laura
appeared to him, and Taſſo in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
with his inviſible ſpirit, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panded
their ſublime imaginations to a
dangerous phrenzy. This delicious ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briation
of the heart, occaſions ſo intenſe
a delight, that to deſcribe this character
of the ſoul, requires, what one of theſe
exquiſite minds has called
<q>Thoughts that breathe and words that burn!</q>
The ancients ſaw nothing ſhort of a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
inſpiration in this agitation of the
mind. It affects men of genius phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally.
Fielding ſays, <q rend="inline">I do not doubt
but that the moſt pathetic and affecting
ſcenes have been writ with tears!</q>
He, perhaps, would have been pleaſed
to have confirmed his obſervation, by
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0238000900:108"/>
the following circumſtance. Metaſtaſio
has written a beautiful Sonnet, on occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
of having ſhed tears in writing an
Opera.<note n="*" place="bottom">This Sonnet ſhall be given at the cloſe of the volume.</note> When the firſt idea of the
Eſſay on the Arts and Sciences ruſhed
on the contemplation of Rouſſeau, it oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned
ſuch a fever of the mind, and
trembling of his frame, that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
to a delirium. The tremors
of Dryden, after having written an Ode,
(a circumſtance accidentally handed to
us by tradition) were probably not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual
with him.</p>
            <p>Chance has preſerved but a few of
ſimilar inſtances; this enthuſiaſm, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,
can only be obſerved by men of
genius themſelves; but when it moſt
powerfully agitates them, they can leaſt
perceive it. At that moment of exqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite
extravagance, like a religious viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary,
they pierce into "the heaven of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0238000900:109"/>
heavens," and when they return to
their chair and their table, the effect has
ceaſed, and the golden hour of ſublime
rapture muſt terminate like other hours,
in vulgar appetites that offend Fancy
and gratify Nature.</p>
            <p>This irritability of mind has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
rendered ſociety diſpleaſing to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
men of genius. Whenever Rouſſeau
paſſed a morning in company, he ſays,
it was obſerved that in the evening he
was diſſatisfied and diſturbed. Rouſſeau
may be conſidered by ſome, as a mind
too peculiar, to be taken as a guide in
our examination into the character of
men of genius. If our young authors,
however, would meditate on certain
parts of his character, their virtues might
be more elevated, and their ſtyle more
exquiſite, than the model which any
other literary character of this age pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:0238000900:110"/>
Abſorbed in his meditations, the man
of genius lives in one continued ſeries of
reflection; always himſelf, ſeldom ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
frequently the real artiſt loves
nothing but his art, and his very amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
and relaxations receive the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion
of this enthuſiaſm. Not without
an apparent haughtineſs, which often is
but the natural and dignified expreſſion
of an elevated mind; and he appears
awkward or ignorant of thoſe petty at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions
which form the ſcience of thoſe
who have no ſcience. A great Princeſs
was deſirous of ſeeing one of the firſt
Literary Characters of the age; her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment
was inconceivable; he ſat
awkwardly and ſilently on his chair, and
made the moſt perplexed bow, ſhe had
yet ſeen.</p>
            <p>We often view the man of real genius
inſulated in a brilliant circle; while the
intriguing and faſhionable author, whoſe
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:0238000900:111"/>
heart is more corrupt than his head, is
admired becauſe he has diſcovered the
art of admiring. The triflers conſider
him to be a man of genius; he employs
their own ideas; both are therefore
gratified.</p>
            <p>It is however certain, that this ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction
and awkwardneſs which render
a man of genius ridiculous and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
in the private circle, are the
cauſe of his ſucceſs with the public.
Often his private defects are the ſource
of his public qualities; his bluntneſs may
be a lively perception of truth; his cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
a rigid candour; his tedious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion
may be an accuracy of reaſoning,
and his diſagreeable warmth the ardour
which animates his works with the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic.
It was the exceſſive vanity and
ſelf-love of Cicero and Voltaire, that gave
birth to all their vaſt deſigns. To pleaſe
the public, and his circle is incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0238000900:112"/>
—to this the frivolous will not aſſent—when of their numerous body one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed
trifler ſhall be acknowledged
as a great genius, this obſervation ſhall
be deemed erroneous. But to cloſe a
diſpute of the moſt ancient date, I ſhall
quote the remark of a <hi>Lord.</hi> Shafteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury
(for nobility loſes it's title and often
it's rank in the republic of letters) has
ſaid, <q rend="inline">that it may happen that a perſon
may be ſo much the worſe author for
being the finer gentleman.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Many reaſons may be alledged why
genius is defective in ordinary conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation;
one may be ſufficient; the want
of analogous ideas. The ſpirit of faſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable
ſociety and that of ſtudy, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatible.
The language of the politeſt
circle may be defined the art of ſpeaking
idly to an idler. To ſpeak idly, is not an
acquirement of facility. A man of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
is rarely verſant in the faſhionable
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0238000900:113"/>
vocabulary, and in a dialogue of elegant
inanity, which ſhould be rapid and
various, he heſitates to find a remote
idea, and ſtops to correct an imperfect
expreſſion. How often will it be fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
for him if he eſcapes being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood!
It is rather ſingular that our
poliſhed ſociety ſhould bear ſo cloſe a
reſemblance to the converſations of the
Hottentots—of the Hottentots?—Yes!
for we are told that they conſider <hi>think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>
as the ſcourge of human nature.</p>
            <p>The refined ſenſibility of men of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
renders them uneaſy companions.
They diſcover a character too early, and
too ſagaciouſly, for the intereſts of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation.
Dunces are excellent com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions
for dunces; the ſame ideas, and
the ſame judgments; the opacity of the
intellect is no detriment, for, like the
blind, they can perform their ſtated
rounds in the night without incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0238000900:114"/>
A man of genius can rarely be a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
with ſuch a party, even if they
ſhould have ſome taſte and ſome infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation.
His works they applaud, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
that is faſhionable, but they neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect
the author, who may happen to be
very unfaſhionable.</p>
            <p>The frivoliſt author will be the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
favourite; he ſports not without
grace on the brilliant ſurface of the ſoul;
but is irrecoverably loſt when he paſſes
over it's depths; the ſwan that grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
glides down rivers, would periſh on
ſeas. The man of genius ſits like a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy
eagle whoſe pinions are clip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,
and who is placed to rooſt among
domeſtic fowls.</p>
            <p>A man of genius utters many things
in converſation which appear extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
or abſurd; when printed they are
found admirable. How often the public
differs from the individual; there may
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0238000900:115"/>
be a century's opinion betwixt them.
This reflection reminds me of an Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian
anecdote. A ſtatuary at Athens,
made a figure of Minerva. Thoſe friends
who were admitted into his ſhop (an
ancient cuſtom the moderns preſerve)
were ſurpriſed at it's rough ſtrokes and
coloſſal features. Before the artiſt they
trembled for him; behind him they ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumniated.
The man of genius ſmiled
at the one, and forgave the other. When
the figure was fixed in a public place,
and inſpected by the city, and not merely
by individuals, the attic judges admired
the ſoftneſs of the traits, and the majeſty
of the figure. We muſt never forget
that there is a certain diſtance, at which
opinions, as well as ſtatues, are to be
viewed; and he who addreſſes an attic
public, knows, that it's enlightened ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents,
are rarely to be found in a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate
circle.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="94" facs="tcp:0238000900:116"/>
It is not neceſſary to produce inſtances
of the deficiencies of men of genius in
converſation. It is ſufficient to obſerve,
that the ſublime Dante was taciturn or
ſatirical; Addiſon and Moliere were
ſilent; Corneille and Dryden were no
amuſing companions. Vaucanſon was
ſaid to be as much a machine as any he
made.</p>
            <p>To the intimates of theſe ſuperior men,
who complained of their defects, I would
thus have replied—Do their productions
not delight and ſurpriſe you?—You are
ſilent; I beg your pardon. The <hi>public</hi>
has informed you of a great name; you
would not otherwiſe have perceived the
precious talent of your neighbour.—You
have examined his compoſitions; and
would you have him reſemble <hi>yourſelves?</hi>
You know nothing of your friend but his
<hi>name.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0238000900:117"/>
A man of genius may, however, be
rendered the moſt agreeable companion.
Few artiſts but are eloquent on the art
in which they excel. He is an exquiſite
inſtrument if the hand of the performer
knows to call forth the rich confluence
of his ſounds. If,<q>The flying fingers touch into a voice.

            <head>CHAP. VIII. Men of Genius limited in their Art.</head>
            <p>WE have examined in the preceding
Chapter ſeveral reaſons why men of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
are often incapable of pleaſing in
the verſatile converſation of a mixed ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety.
Another obſervation offers; their
powers of pleaſing are even limited in
the art in which they excel. They are
confined (ſays Du Bos) to particular
branches in that art.</p>
            <p>This obſervation, reiterated without
effect, has become trite, while it would
appear by moſt authors, conſidering
themſelves univerſal geniuſes, that it was
on the contrary, a dangerous novelty.
Literary hiſtory continually confirms it's
verity; and theſe failures of eminent men
are ſo many inſtructions which Nature
dictates; but her pupils receive her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions
with contempt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0238000900:119"/>
Nature is "a jealous God," and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
of our great writers when they have
riſen in rebellion againſt her, have only
ſuffered by the violation. Fielding, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
in his novels, when his aid was
required for the theatre, could never
write a tolerable drama. Congreve, ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
for his pointed wit, when he
took up the reigning topic, wrote the
feebleſt verſe; Rowe, ſucceſsful in the
ſoft tones of tragedy, is remarkable for
a miſerable failure in comedy; La Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine,
that exquiſite fabuliſt, found that
his opera was hiſſed. The abſurdities of
Voltaire, the moſt ſucceſsful of univerſal
writers, are only forgiven for his inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſtible
wit and happy irony.</p>
            <p>The moſt original genius of our age,
with diſcernment equal to his wit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fines
himſelf to that ſpecies of poetry in
which he can fear no rival. Songs, more
delicious than the odes of Anacreon, and
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:0238000900:120"/>
ſatires, more pungent than thoſe of
Horace; compoſitions more admirable
than imitable; theſe are the limits which,
like a great politician, he draws round
his empire. He has no diſpoſition to
rival Milton in an epic, or Shakeſpeare
in a tragedy. Peter Pindar will never,
therefore, experience the fate of Louis
the Great; to make brilliant conqueſts
in the prime of life, and view his repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
die before himſelf, by a vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
at univerſal monarchy.</p>
            <p>But ſome ingenious men are willing to
oppoſe this precept, and preſume to
think that Nature is never ungrateful,
when ſhe receives the proper attentions.
It is not difficult to find ſome ingenious
artiſts, who ſhew abilities in various
modes of compoſition; but to evince
<hi>abilities,</hi> and to diſplay <hi>genius,</hi> are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved
at a long interval from each other.
True genius has rarely this ſuppleneſs;
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:0238000900:121"/>
but what the French call <hi>le bel eſprit,</hi>
has it often in a wonderful degree. Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
endowed with the <hi>bel eſprit,</hi> can
compoſe hiſtory and romance, and moral
and poetical eſſays, with the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity.
A man of genius will only write
a hiſtory, or a romance; moral, or poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical
eſſays; but his performances remain
with the language, while the reputation
of a <hi>bel eſprit,</hi> like ſome artificial fires,
become ſuddenly extinct. And it is cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
to obſerve, that the very ingenious
Du Clos is denied by the French critics,
to be a man of genius, becauſe he wrote
equally well on a variety of ſubjects.</p>
            <p>Nor is it ſurpriſing that even a man of
genius ſhould fail in preſerving an equal
power over every province of his art; the
genius of man being neceſſarily limited
compared to art itſelf; and he who raiſes
admiration by his ſkill in one depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
will never equal his faculty in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other.
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0238000900:122"/>
He who <hi>excels,</hi> like a Butler in
wit and ſatire, will find it impoſſible to
<hi>excel</hi> like a Milton, in ſentiment and
imagination. The minds of men are ſo
many different ſoils; and the great art
conſiſts in planting the trees adapted to
the ſoil.</p>
            <p>I know no inſtance to ſhew that a great
poet <hi>excelled</hi> as a painter, or that a great
muſician <hi>excelled</hi> as a ſtatuary. But it
is not difficult to prove, that the moſt
eminent men of genius have found their
talent confined to their art, and even to
departments of their art.</p>
            <p>The ancients therefore wiſely addicted
themſelves only to one ſpecies of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.
The poet was not an hiſtorian,
nor the hiſtorian a poet; but the poet
was a poet, and the hiſtorian an hiſtorian.</p>
            <p>I have been induced to touch on this
critical admonition, becauſe it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
denied; and I think the error
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0238000900:123"/>
ariſes from not diſtinguiſhing the grand
compoſitions of genius, from the pretty
curioſities of the <hi>bel eſprit,</hi> which may
be defined mimetic genius. Whenever
this well-known verſe ſhall be contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted,
it will be fatal to the progreſs of
genius,
<q>One ſcience only will one genius fit.

            </p>
            <p>He who writes on topics of different
ſpecies, cannot meditate much on any;
with him all is a beautiful diſtraction
rather than an accompliſhed beauty; he
can only repeat what has been already
given, or give what will not merit to be
repeated. Writers of mediocrity, by a
long and patient devotion to <hi>one kind</hi> of
compoſition, have often attained con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
merit; but how much more
forcibly muſt this reſolute perſeverance
act on a mind of original powers. We
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0238000900:124"/>
may compare thoſe who write on dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
arts, or multifarious topics, to
excurſive merchants, who make ſmall
fortunes in various places, and ſpend
them there; writers who concentrate
their powers on one object, are like thoſe
who inceſſantly accumulate, but exhauſt
their ſplendid opulence, in the proper
place, at their native reſidence.</p>
            <p>It is the obſervation of one of our beſt
critics and poets, in his admirable pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
to Homer, that <q rend="inline">no author or man
ever excelled all the world in more
than one faculty.</q> It is not, however,
denied that a man of genius ſhould be

            <head>CHAP. IX. Some Obſervations reſpecting the Infirmities
and Defects of Men of Genius.</head>
            <p>THE modes of life of a man of genius
are often tinctured with eccentricity and
enthuſiaſm. Theſe are in an eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict
with the uſages of common life. His
occupations, his amuſements, and his
ardour, are diſcordant to daily purſuits,
and prudential habits. It is the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſtic
of genius to diſplay no talent to
ordinary men; and it is unjuſt to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
the latter when they conſider him
as born for no human purpoſe. Their
pleaſures and their ſorrows are not his
pleaſures and his ſorrows. He often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
to ſlumber in diſhonourable eaſe,
while his days are paſſed in labours, more
conſtant and more painful than thoſe of
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0238000900:126"/>
the manufacturer. The world are not
always aware that to meditate, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,
and even to converſe with ſome,
are great labours; and as Hawkeſworth
obſerves, that <q rend="inline">wearineſs may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
in an arm chair.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Such men are alſo cenſured for an ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritability
of diſpoſition. Many reaſons
might apologize for theſe unhappy vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
of humour. The occupation of
making a great name, is, perhaps, more
anxious and precarious than that of
making a great fortune. We ſympathiſe
with the merchant when he communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates
melancholy to the ſocial circle in
conſequence of a bankruptcy, or when
he feels the elation of proſperity at the
ſucceſs of a vaſt ſpeculation. The au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
is not leſs immerſed in cares, or
agitated by ſucceſs, for literature has it's
bankruptcies and it's ſpeculations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:0238000900:127"/>
The anxieties and diſappointments of
an author, even of the moſt ſucceſsful,
are incalculable. If he is learned, learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
is the torment of unquenchable thirſt,
and his elaborate work is expoſed to the
accidental recollection of an inferior
mind, as well as the fatal omiſſions of
wearied vigilance. If he excels in the
magic of diction, and the graces of
fancy, his path is ſtrewed with roſes,
but his feet bleed on inviſible yet piercing
thorns. Rouſſeau has given a glowing
deſcription of the ceaſeleſs inquietudes
by which he acquired ſkill in the arts of
compoſition; and has ſaid, that with
whatever talent a man may be born, the
art of writing is not eaſily obtained. The
depreſſions and elevations of genius, are
deſcribed by Pope
<q>
                  <l>Who pants for glory finds but ſhort repoſe,</l>
                  <l>A breath revives him, or a breath o'erthrows.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="106" facs="tcp:0238000900:128"/>
The anxious uncertainty of an author
for his compoſitions, is like the ſtate of
the lover who writes to his miſtreſs; he
repents, and thinks he has written too
much, and he recollects that he had
omitted things of the greateſt moment.
When, indeed, his work is received with
favour, he reſembles Latona, as deſcribed
by Ovid, who contemplated with ſecret
joy, her daughter Diana, diſtinguiſhed
among the wood-nymphs, and whoſc
appearance was taller, and more lovely
than her companions.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved by M. La Harpe (an
author by profeſſion) that as it has been
proved there are ſome maladies peculiar
to artiſts, there are alſo ſorrows which
are peculiar to them; and which the
world can neither pity nor ſoften, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
it cannot have their conceptions.
We read not without a melancholy emo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
the querulous expreſſions of men of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0238000900:129"/>
genius. We have a little catalogue <hi>de
calamitate Litteratorum</hi>; we might add a
volume by the addition of moſt of our
own authors.<note n="*" place="bottom">The materials are ready for publication; but the hope of it's utility has paſt, ſince a <hi>Literary</hi> Fund eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in attic London found too many claimants and too few ſubſcribers. It has died away; while the <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical</hi> Fund is patroniſed by the Great, which ſeems to prove that they have finer ears than underſtandings.</note> The too ſenſible Smollet
has left this teſtimonial to poſterity of his
feelings. In one of his prefaces he ſays,
<q rend="inline">had ſome of thoſe who were pleaſed to
call themſelves my friends, been at any
pains to deſerve the character, and told
me ingenuouſly what I had to expect
in the capacity of an <hi>Author,</hi> I ſhould
in all probability have ſpared myſelf
the <hi>incredible labour</hi> and <hi>chagrin</hi> I have
ſince undergone.</q> This is a text
which requires no commentary. Hume
has given the hiſtory of his writings, and
we find that it required to the full, all
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:0238000900:130"/>
his patient philoſophy to ſupport his ill
reception. The reaſoning Hume pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
changing his name and his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.
Parties are formed againſt a man
of genius, as happened to Corneille and
Milton; and a Pradon and a Settle are
preferred to a Racine and a Dryden.
What muſt have been the agonies of the
neglected Collins when he burnt his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite
odes at the door of his publiſher!
The great Bacon bequeathed his name
and his works to foreigners, and to a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
age; nor muſt we forget the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
complaints of the Rambler, with
which he awefully cloſes his work in ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing
to poſterity.</p>
            <p>The votaries of the arts and ſciencies,
are called by Cicero, Heroes of Peace;
their labours, their dangers, and their
intrepidity, make them heroes; but
peace is rarely the ornament of their fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh
exiſtence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:0238000900:131"/>
It is a mortification experienced by
ſeveral men of genius, that they have
never acquired that reputation they might
have merited, by not having been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled
to carry their genius to it's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection.
A variety of circumſtances may
hinder ſuch a writer from occupying the
diſtinguiſhed place his abilities promiſed.
Some authors, of the firſt-rate genius,
are neglected, becauſe deficient in that
taſte, which is alone attained by long
culture and an enlarged education. Piron
was a writer of as great genius, and ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
powers, as any of the French poets;
but he has failed of ſecuring himſelf a
ſeat among the maſters of the French
Parnaſſus. He has himſelf, in ſome
ſketches of his life, aſſigned the reaſons
of this failure; till the age of twenty-five,
he was confined to the narrow
circle of unlettered friends; he paſſed
ten or twelve years afterwards at Paris in
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0238000900:132"/>
obſcurity; ſo that he was about forty,
when by the advice of Crebillon, he eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſayed
his powers on his faſtidious the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atre,
and though he has evinced high
genius, he has only ſatisfied his refined
nation by one performance.</p>
            <p>Some are now only agreeable, who
might have been great writers, had their
application to ſtudy, and the modes of
their life been different. In Mr. Greaves'
lively recollections of his friend Shen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone,
are ſome judicious obſervations on
this ſubject. He has drawn a compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
between the elevated abilities of Gray,
and the humble talents of Shenſtone;
and he has eſſayed to ſhew, that it was
the accidental circumſtances of Gray's
place of birth, education, his admittance
into ſome of the beſt circles, and his
aſſiduous application to ſcience, which
gave him that ſuperiority over the indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
the retirement, and the inertion
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0238000900:133"/>
of a want of patronage, which made
Shenſtone, as Gray familiarly ſaid, <q rend="inline">hop
round his walks</q> like a bird in a ſtring.
I muſt again remind the reader of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
apparent paradox of Helvetius,
who ſays, that it is the different modes
of education which influence men ſo
wonderfully; and that <hi>genius</hi> may be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired</hi>
whenever a proper ſtudy is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied
by a fervent paſſion for any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular
art or ſcience. This fervent paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
may be only another name for what
is called genius. I believe, however, that
Shenſtone, who now occupies a ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
ſeat, in the Temple of Fame, might
have been placed among the higher
claſſes. Perhaps moſt men are born
with abilities nearly equal; and Mr.
Greaves has more reaſon on his ſide than
ſome may be aware, when he ſays, <q rend="inline">of
two perſons, born to equal fortune, if
one improves his ſtock by induſtry
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0238000900:134"/>
and traffic, and the other lives idly
upon the principal, the conſequence is
obvious.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Others, by an ignorance of a fine
manner, or by a wrong direction long
purſued, waſte their talents, on the hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler
departments of art, when they have
ſufficient genius to excel in the higheſt.
This is the caſe among many of our
provincial writers, who, with no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable
talents, are placed often in ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations
where they ſtudy authors whoſe
taſte is ſurpaſſed by the more modern.
We often ſee ingenious writers, who are
about half a century removed from the
public taſte. Among the painters, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert
Durer may ſerve as an inſtance.
Vaſari (quoted by Sir Joſhua Reynolds)
juſtly remarked, that he would have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably
been one of the firſt painters of
his age, had he been initiated into the
great principles of the art, ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:0238000900:135"/>
by his Italian contemporaries.
And Sir Joſhua adds, but unluckily hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
never ſeen or heard of any other
manner, he conſidered his own, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
doubt, as perfect.</p>
            <p>Men of genius are often reverenced
only where they are known by their wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings.
In the romance of life they are
divinities, in it's hiſtory they are men.
From errors of the mind, and derelic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the heart, they may not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt;
theſe are perceived by their
acquaintance, who can often diſcern only
theſe qualities. The defects of great
men are the conſolation of the dunces.</p>
            <p>Degrading vices and ſingular follies
have diſhonoured men of the higheſt
genius. Than others, their paſſions are
more efferveſcent, and their reliſh for
enjoyment more keen. Genius is a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous
gift of Nature; for it is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged
that the ſame materials ſhe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0238000900:136"/>
to form a Cataline and a Cromwell,
make a Cicero and a Bacon. Plato, in
his viſionary ſketches of a man of genius,
lays great ſtreſs on his having the moſt
violent paſſions, with reaſon to reſtrain
them. Helvetius, an accurate obſerver
of men of genius, alſo enforces the idea
of their inflammable and phyſical paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.
Glory and infamy is the ſame
violent paſſion, but the direction is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent,
and Voltaire has expreſſed this
in one verſe,<q>Si Je n'etois Ceſar, j'aurois etè Brutus.</q> Genius, like a ſtorm of wind in Arabia,
either directs the myriads of locuſts to
the land, or with a friendly influence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſes
them away.</p>
            <p>For their foibles it appears more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult
to account than for their vices; for
a violent paſſion depends on it's direction
to become either excellence or depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity;
but why their exalted mind ſhould
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0238000900:137"/>
not preſerve them from the imbecillities
of fools, appears a mere caprice of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
A curious liſt might be formed of
<q>Fears of the brave and follies of the wiſe.

In the note underneath I have thrown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
a few facts which may be paſſed
over by thoſe who have no taſte for
literary anecdotes.<note n="*" place="bottom">Voiture was the ſon of a vintner, and like our Prior, was ſo mortified whenever reminded of his ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal occupation, that it was ſaid of him, that wine which cheared the heart of all men, ſickened that of Voiture. Rouſſeau, the poet, was the ſon of a cobler; and when his honeſt parent waited at the door of the theatre, to embrace his ſon on the ſucceſs of his firſt piece, the inhuman poet repulſed the venerable father with inſult and contempt. Akenſide ever conſidered his lameneſs as an unſupportable misfortune, ſince it continually reminded him of his origin, being occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by the fall of a cleaver from one of his father's blocks, a reſpectable butcher. Milton delighted in contemplating his own perſon, and the engraver not having reached our ſublime Bard's "ideal grace," he has pointed his indignation in four iambics. Among the complaints of Pope, is that of "the pictured ſhape." Even the ſtrong-minded Johnſon would not be painted "blinking Sam." Mr. Boſwell tells us that Goldſmith attempted to ſhew his agility to be ſuperior to the dancing of an ape, whoſe praiſe had occaſioned him a fit of jealouſy, but he failed in imitating his rival. The inſcription under Boileau's portrait, deſcribing his character with laviſh panegyric, and a preference to Juvenal and Horace, is unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately known to have been written by himſelf.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:0238000900:138"/>
But it is alſo neceſſary to acknowledge,
that men of genius are often unjuſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
with foibles. The ſports of a
vacant mind, are miſunderſtood as fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies.
The ſimplicity of truth may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
vanity, and the conſciouſneſs of
ſuperiority, envy. Nothing is more uſual
than our ſurpriſe at ſome great writer or
artiſt contemning the labours of another,
whom the public cheriſh with equal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation.
We place it to the account of
his envy, but perhaps this opinion is
erroneous, and claims a conciſe inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation.</p>
            <p>Every ſuperior writer has a MANNER of
his own, with which he has long been
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0238000900:139"/>
converſant, and too often inclines to
judge of the merit of a performance by
the degree it attains of his favourite
manner. He errs, becauſe impartial men
of taſte are addicted to no manner, but
love whatever is exquiſite. We often
ſee readers draw their degree of compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative
merit from the manner of their
favourite author; an author does the
ſame; that is, he draws it from himſelf.
Such a partial ſtandard of taſte is erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous;
but it is more excuſeable in the
author, than in the reader.</p>
            <p>This obſervation will ſerve to explain
ſeveral curious phenomena in literature.
The witty Cowley deſpiſed the natural
Chaucer; the claſſical Boileau, the rough
ſublimity of Crebillon; the forcible Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neille,
the tender Racine; the affected
Marivaux, the familiar Moliere; the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial
Gray, the ſimple Shenſtone. Each
alike judged by that peculiar manner
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0238000900:140"/>
he had long formed. In a free conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
they might have contemned each
other; and a dunce, who had liſtened
without taſte or underſtanding, if he had
been a haberdaſher in anecdotes, would
have haſtened to repoſit in his ware<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room
of literary falſities, a long decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
on the vanity and envy of theſe
great men.</p>
            <p>But the charge of vanity has been
urged with great appearance of truth
againſt authors, for the complacence they
experience in their works, and the high
admiration of themſelves. An author is
pictured as a Narciſſus.</p>
            <p>It has long been acknowledged that
every work of merit, the more it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined,
the greater the merit will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.
The moſt maſterly touches, and
the reſerved graces, which form the
pride of the artiſt, are not obſervable till
after a familiar and conſtant meditation.
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0238000900:141"/>
What is moſt refined is leaſt obvious;
and to ſome muſt remain unperceived
for ever. Churchill, in the opening of
his ſecond book of Gotham, juſtly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves,
that to form the beauties of
compoſition,
<q>
                  <l>—few can do, and ſcarcely one,</l>
                  <l>One critic in an age can find when done.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>But aſcending from theſe elaborate
ſtrokes in compoſition, to the views and
deſigns of an author, the more profound
and extenſive theſe are, the more they
elude the reader's apprehenſion. I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine
not too much when I ſay, that the
author is conſcious of <hi>beauties,</hi> that <hi>are
not in his compoſition.</hi> The happieſt wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
are compelled to ſee ſome of their
moſt magnificent ideas float along the
immenſity of mind, beyond the feeble
graſp of expreſſion. Compare the ſtate
of the author with that of the reader;
how copious and overflowing is the mind
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0238000900:142"/>
of the one to the other; how more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly
alive to a variety of exquiſite ſtrokes
which the other has not yet perceived;
the author is familiar with every part,
and the reader has but a vague notion of
the whole. How many noble conceptions
of Rouſſeau are not yet maſtered! How
many profound reflections of Monteſquieu
are not yet underſtood! How many ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile
leſſons are yet in Locke, which no
preceptor can teach!</p>
            <p>Such, among others, are the reaſons
which may induce an author to expreſs
himſelf in language which may ſound
like vanity. To be admired, is the noble
ſimplicity of the ancients, (imitated by a
few elevated minds among the moderns)
in expreſſing with ardour the conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of genius. We are not more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed
with Dryden than with Cicero,
when he acquaints us of the great things
he has done, and thoſe he purpoſes to
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0238000900:143"/>
do. Modern modeſty might, perhaps,
to ſome be more engaging, if it were
modeſty; but our artificial bluſhes are
like the ladies' temporary rouge, ever
ready to colour the face on any occaſion.
Some will not place their names to their
books, yet prefix it to their advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
others pretend to be the editors
of their own works; ſome compliment
themſelves in the third perſon; and
many, concealed under the ſhade of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nymous
criticiſm, form panegyrics, as
elaborate and long as Pliny's on Trajan,
of their works and themſelves; yet in a
converſation, ſtart at a compliment, and
quarrel at a quotation. Such modeſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
reſemble <hi>certain</hi> ladies, who in
<hi>public</hi> are equally celebrated for the
coldeſt chaſtity.</p>
            <p>Conſciouſneſs of merit characteriſes
men of genius; but it is to be lamented
that the illuſions of ſelf-love, are not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhable
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:0238000900:144"/>
from the realities of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The following are inſtances. Epicurus wrote to a Miniſter of State, <q rend="inline">if you deſire glory, nothing can beſtow it ſo much as the letters I write to you.</q> Seneca, in quoting theſe words, adds, <q rend="inline">what Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curus promiſed to his friend, that my Lucilius I promiſe you.</q> Theſe were great men. But one La Serre, a French writer of epiſtles, when he addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed them, uſed to ſay, <q rend="inline">I immortaliſe you, Sir, and this merits at leaſt your gratitude.</q> How many La Serres might we quote!</p>
               </note>
Yet if we were to take from
ſome their pride of exultation, we anni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hilate
the germ of their excellence. The
perſuaſion of a juſt poſterity ſmoothed
the ſleepleſs pillow, and ſpread a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine
in the ſolitude of Bacon, Monteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieu,
and Newton; of Cervantes, Gray,
and Milton. Men of genius anticipate
their contemporaries, and know they are
ſuch, long before the tardy conſent of
the public.</p>
            <p>They have alſo been accuſed of the
meaneſt adulations; it is certain that
many have had the weakneſs to praiſe
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0238000900:145"/>
unworthy men, and ſome the courage to
eraſe what they have written. A young
writer unknown, yet languiſhing for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
when he firſt finds the
notice of a perſon of ſome eminence, has
expreſſed himſelf in language which gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,
a finer reaſon than reaſon itſelf,
inſpired. Strongly has Milton expreſſed
the ſenſations of this paſſion, <q rend="inline">the debt
immenſe of endleſs gratitude.</q> Who
ever pays an "immenſe debt" in ſmall
ſums?</p>
            <p>Even extravagant applauſes may be
excuſed. Every man of genius has left
ſuch honourable traces of his private af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections;
from Locke, whoſe dedication of
his immortal treatiſe is more adulative
than could be ſuppoſed from a temperate
philoſopher, to Churchill, whoſe eulo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
on his friends form ſo beautiful a
contraſt with the acerbity of his ſatire.
As their ſuſceptibility is more ardent,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0238000900:146"/>
and their penetration keener, than other
men, it is not improbable that they often
diſcover traits in the characters of thoſe
with whom they are familiar, unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
and unknown to the world. The
moſt illuſtrious of the ancients placed the
name of ſome friend at the head of their
works; we too often prefix the name of
ſome patron; but the moſt graceful place
is, perhaps, in the midſt of a work,
when a man of genius ſhows that he is
not leſs mindful of his ſocial affection
than his fame.</p>

            <head>CHAP. X. Of Literary Friendſhips and Enmities.</head>
            <p>A DELIGHTFUL topic opens to our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation.
I enter the ſcene, as Eneas
the green Elyſium, where he viewed the
once illuſtrious inhabitants of the earth
repoſing in ſocial felicity. Among the
multitude, a Pythias and Damon are
rare; for friendſhip appears too ſerious
for the frivolous, and too romantic for
the buſy. The mutable paſſions of the
frivolous oblige them to forſake thoſe
boſoms in which they have repoſited
their extinct paſſions; and the varying
object of the varying hour requires a new
ſet of aſſociates. The buſy ſuffer no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timacies
to intrude on their private
views; the myſterious magnet of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
is attached only by inviſible atoms
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0238000900:148"/>
of ſympathy, but falls without coheſion,
on the ſolidity of gold.</p>
            <p>It is honourable to Literature, that
among the virtues it inſpires, is that of
ardent friendſhip, and it's hiſtory pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents
no unfrequent inſtances of it's fineſt
enthuſiaſm. The delirium of love is
often too violent a paſſion for the ſtudent,
and it's caprices are ſtill more incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patible
with his purſuits than it's deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium.
But friendſhip is not only delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,
but neceſſary to ſoothe a mind alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately
elated and depreſſed; when infirm,
it ſtrengthens, when dubious, it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightens,
when diſcouraged, it animates.</p>
            <p>That however it ſhould be rare in
literature, will excite no ſurpriſe. The
qualities neceſſary to conſtitute literary
friendſhip, compared with thoſe of men
of the world, muſt render it's occaſional
appearance a ſingularity. Literary friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
has no convivial gaieties or factious
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0238000900:149"/>
aſſemblies. Two atoms muſt meet, out
of the vaſt maſs of nature, of ſo equal a
form that when they once adhere, they
ſhall appear as one, and reſiſt the utmoſt
force of ſeparation. Their ſtudies muſt
be ſimilar, and yet ſo far from becoming
rivals, each muſt find reciprocal aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance;
when one of them is at length
found to excel, the other is to be the
protector of his fame. Each muſt live
for the other, decide with one judgment,
and feel with one taſte. In this inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe
of minds, the private paſſions are
not to be gratified, but often to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected,
and an energetic paſſion for ſtudy
muſt alone be indulged. In their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
converſations, learning is commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated
without ſtudy, and wit without
art. What is given by one is improved
by the other; fancy is enriched by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory:
and to ſuch converſations the
world is indebted for many of it's hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:0238000900:150"/>
productions. The greateſt incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience
attending ſuch a friendſhip, is
to ſurvive the friend; nor are there
wanting inſtances in which this has not
been ſuffered, and the violence of grief
has operated like a voluntary death.</p>
            <p>The friendſhips of men of the world
are different both in their features and
their complections. There we find with
facility, men of analogous diſpoſitions;
but ſuch intimacies terminate in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint
and contempt. A feeble mind
acquires ſtill more imbecillity with the
feeble; a diſſolute heart riots in guilt
with the diſſolute; and while we deſpiſe
our companion, we in return have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
deſpicable.</p>
            <p>Among the moſt pleaſing effuſions of
a man of genius, are thoſe little pieces
which he conſecrates to the cauſe of
friendſhip; and among his nobleſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
are thoſe fervid and ſpontaneous
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0238000900:151"/>
teſtimonies of affection, of which literary
hiſtory affords many examples. I ſhall
have no recourſe to the abundant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
which the ancients have left; the
moderns may be inſtructed by the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derns.
To notice a few will be ſufficient,
and not to notice them, would be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing
the young reader no ordinary
gratification. Such is the memorable
friendſhip of Beaumont and Fletcher,
that as they have ſo cloſely united their
labours that we know not the productions
of either; it is with equal difficulty bio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers
compoſe the memoirs of one,
without running into the life of the other.
They pourtrayed the ſame characters,
while they mingled ſentiment with ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,
and their days were not more
cloſely interwoven than their verſes. The
poem of Cowley, on the death of his
friend Harvey, is not, indeed, free from
ſome of his remote conceits; yet the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0238000900:152"/>
ſtanza preſents a pleaſing picture
of the employments of two young

                  <l>But ſearch of deep philoſophy,</l>

               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Milton has not only given the exquiſite
Lycidas to the memory of a young
friend, but in his <hi>Epitaphium Damonis,</hi>
to that of Deodatus, has poured forth
ſome intereſting ſentiments. It has been
verſified by Langhorne. Now, ſays the
poet,<q>
                  <l>To whom ſhall I my hopes and fears impart,</l>
                  <l>Or truſt the cares and follies of my heart.</l>
               </q> The elegy of Tickel, maliciouſly called
by Steele, "proſe in rhime," is alike
inſpired by affection and fancy; it has a
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:0238000900:153"/>
melodious languor, and a melancholy
grace. The ſonnet of Gray, to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory
of Weſt, is a beautiful effuſion, and
a model for Engliſh ſonnets. Helvetius
was the protector of men of genius,
whom he aſſiſted not only with his cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticiſm,
but his fortune. At his death,
M. Surin read in the French academy,
an epiſtle to the manes of his friend.
Saurin, wreſtling with obſcurity and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,
was drawn into literary exiſtence
by the ſupporting hand of Helvetius.

The literary friendſhip of a father with
his ſon, is one of the moſt rare alliances
in the republic of letters. We have had
a remarkable inſtance in the two Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;
and the father, in his fine original
and warm manner, has employed the
moſt glowing language to expreſs his
ſentiments on this affection. He ſays,
<q rend="inline">my time of learning was employed in

            <p>But it muſt not be ſuppoſed that men
of genius have remained ſatisfied with
only giving a few verſes to the duties of
friendſhip. The elevation of their minds
has raiſed them into domeſtic heroes,
whoſe actions are often only recorded in
the unpubliſhed regiſter of private life.
Some for their friend have died, pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
with inconſolable grief; ſome
have ſacrificed their character to his own;
ſome have ſhared their limited fortune;
and ſome have remained attached to
their friend in the worſt ſeaſon of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity.
In the note underneath I adduce
my proofs of what is ſo honourable to
literature.<note n="*" place="bottom">Jurieu denounced Bayle as an impious writer, and drew his teſtimonies from the "Avis aux Refugies." This work is written againſt Calviniſts, and therefore becomes impious in Holland. Bayle might have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culpated himſelf with facility, by declaring the work was compoſed by La Roque; but he preferred to be perſecuted, rather than to ruin his friend; he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ſilent, and condemned.—When the miniſter Fouquet was abandoned by all, it was the men of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he had patroniſed, who never forſook his priſon; and many have dedicated their works to great men in their adverſity, whom they ſcorned to notice, at the time when they were noticed by all.—The learned Goguet bequeathed his MSS. and library to his friend Fugere, with whom he had united his affections and his ſtudies. His work on the Origin of the Arts and Sciences, had been much indebted to his aid. In vain was the legacy bequeathed; Goguet died of a ſlow and painful diſorder; Fugere, who knew him to be paſt recovery, preſerved a mute deſpair, retired home, and the victim of ſenſibility and friendſhip died, a few weeks after his friend.—The Abbè de Saint Pierre gave an intereſting proof of literary friendſhip. When he was at College, he formed a union with Varignon, the geometrician. They were of congenial diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; when he went to Paris, he invited Varignon to accompany him; but Varignon had nothing, and the Abbè was far from rich. A certain income was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the tranquil purſuits of geometry. Our Abbè had an income of 1800 livres; from this he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted 300, which he gave to the geometrician, but accompanied by a delicacy which none but a man of genius could conceive. I do not give it you (he ſaid) as a ſalary, but an annuity, that you may be inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent, and quit, when you diſlike me. Something nearly ſimilar embelliſhes our own ſcanty literary hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory. When Akenſide was in great danger of experiencing famine as well as fame, Mr. Dyſon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him three hundred pounds a year. Of this gentleman, perhaps, nothing is known; yet whatever his life may be, it merits the tribute of the biographer; this ſingle action will caſt a luſtre round the meaneſt objects. The <hi>race</hi> of the Dyſons are, no doubt, long extinct; it would be raſh for another Akenſide to look round for another Dyſon. To cloſe with theſe honourable teſtimonies of literary friendſhip, we muſt not omit that of Churchill and Lloyd. It is known that when Lloyd heard of the death of our poet, he acted the port which Fugere did to Goguet. I conclude by remarking that the page is crouded, but my memory is by no means exhauſted.</note>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0238000900:157"/>
urge to diſtinguiſh literary calumny

Churchill ſays,
<q>When Reaſon's for me, God is for me too.</q>
But how rarely are ſatiriſts conducted by
reaſon! Our laws offer no protection from
a bitter epigram, and an artful ſatire.
Irony is not denominated by an attorney
a libel; by an honeſt man it may be felt
as ſomething much worſe. Fortune has
been loſt, reputation deſtroyed, and every
charity of life been extinguiſhed by witty
malice. To debaſe a man in the circle
of his acquaintance, if unfortunately his
ſenſibility is exquiſite, has not infre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
been committing a leſs crime
than murder. The Abbè Caſſagne felt
ſo acutely the cauſtic verſe of Boileau,
that, in the prime of life, he became
melancholy, and died inſane. A modern
painter fell the victim of the criticiſm
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0238000900:159"/>
and the wit of a ſatiriſt, who ſhall be
nameleſs on this occaſion. Dr. Johnſon
related of Cummyns, a celebrated quaker,
that he confeſſed he died of an anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous
letter in a public paper, which
ſaid, he <q rend="inline">faſtened on my heart, and

like Racine, have died of a ſimple re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke;
and ſome by an epigram as well

in their Writings.</head>
            <p>IT has long been a cheriſhed notion
among men of taſte, that the diſpoſitions
of an artiſt appear in his works; and the
ſublime Angelo, and the graceful Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phael,
are produced as ſplendid inſtances.
It has alſo been a very ancient opinion,
that the character of an author is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable
in his writings. The echo from
biographers has been conſtant, and often
they pourtray the man, by the mirror of
his works.<note n="*" place="bottom">

He has written a great deal about Pope and Poetry, and, as Johnſon ſaid, he knew as little of one as the other.</p>
               </note> The anecdote which Dr.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:0238000900:161"/>
Johnſon has given of Thomſon, has
ſerved at leaſt to ſuſpect it's fallibility.
The ſubject, however, demands inveſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation,
and perhaps may be finally ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated
by the facts I now adduce.</p>
            <p>We enquire whether he is a moral
man who compoſes moral eſſays; incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent,
who writes laſcivious poems;
malignant, who publiſhes bitter ſatires;
and ſavage, whoſe imagination delights
in terror and in blood.</p>
            <p>It is one characteriſtic of genius to ſay
things for their ingenuity, and to diſplay
the felicity of fancy, than from any utility
which may be drawn from them. Of
many obſcene poets, the greater part
have led chaſte lives; and this topic has
engaged the acute examination of Bayle.
La Mothe le Váier wrote two works of a
free nature; yet his life was the unble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed
life of a retired ſage. Of many of
the ancient poets, it appears that the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0238000900:162"/>
of their verſe, was by no
means communicated to their manners.
Their page was laſcivious, and their life
pure, for the fancy may be debauched,
and the heart auſtere.</p>
            <p>The licentious tales of La Fontaine
are well known, but not a ſingle amour
has been recorded of the "bon homme."
Bayle is a remarkable inſtance; no writer
is more ample in his detail of impurity,
but he reſiſted the pollution of the ſenſes
as much as Newton. He painted his
ſcenes of lewdneſs merely as a faithful
hiſtorian, and an exact compiler. Smol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let's
character is immaculate, yet what a
deſcription has he given of one of his
heroes with Lord Straddle. I cannot
but obſerve on ſuch ſcenes, that their
delineation anſwers no good purpoſe.
Modeſty cannot read, and is morality
intereſted? He aſſumed the character
of Petronius Arbiter; we applaud and
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0238000900:163"/>
we cenſure this mere playfulneſs of fancy.
It is certain, however, by theſe inſtances,
that licentious writers may be very
chaſte men.</p>
            <p>We now turn to thoſe works which, by
their caſt, promiſe that the authors were
pious and moral men. Two celebrated
ancients muſt not be paſſed over in this
enumeration, Seneca and Salluſt. The
firſt is an admirable ſtoic, elaborate in
his delineation of the moral duties; but
his eſſays on the advantages of poverty,
were written on a table of gold, and his
admonitions of ſupporting pain, on vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuous
ſophas, and in fragrant baths.
This moral declaimer ruined my county.
Eſſex, by the moſt exorbitant uſuries,
and inculcated the comforts of poverty
with a fortune of ſeven millions. Salluſt
elegantly declaims againſt the licentious
manners of his age, but we happen to
know that he was repeatedly accuſed in
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0238000900:164"/>
the ſenate for public and habitual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries.
He inveighs againſt the
ſpoilers of countries, yet, when he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
to a remote government, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
a Verres. Lucian, in his early
productions, declaims againſt the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
of the great, as another name for
ſervitude; when his talents made him
known, he accepted a place under the
Emperor. He has attempted to apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gize
for his conduct, by comparing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to thoſe quacks, who, indiſpoſed
with a ſevere cough, ſell infallible reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
for it's cure. At the moment the
poet Rouſſeau was giving verſions of the
pſalms, he was occupied on the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous
epigrams. A living painter,
whoſe pictures only repreſent acts of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
and charity, is as little generous
as he is chaſte.</p>
            <p>We have been told that the ſenſibility
of Sterne was more that of the author
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0238000900:165"/>
than the man; perhaps thoſe who gave
the information were incompetent jud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges;
but I do not find this any more
difficult to credit, than a circumſtance
which happened to Klopſtock. This
votary of Zion's muſe aſtoniſhed and
warmed the ſage Bodmer, who ſuppoſing
him a poet of an advanced age, and an
enthuſiaſt for retirement, invited him to
his reſidence; but when the epic poet
arrived, he was found no proper aſſociate
for the grave profeſſor; he had all the
levity and volatility of youth. So very
erroneous is the conception often of the
form and manners of a diſtant author.</p>
            <p>Johnſon would not believe that Horace
was a happy man, becauſe his verſes
were chearful; no more than he could
think Pope was ſo, becauſe he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
informing us of it. He obſerved
that Dr. Young, who pined for prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
contemns it in his writings. It
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0238000900:166"/>
is ſingular that the ſombrous author of
the night thoughts, was the firſt to
propoſe a ſubſcription for the balls at
Wellwyn.<note n="*" place="bottom">This anecdote is from Mr. Pye's commentary on the poetic of Ariſtotle. This work has great claims on the attention of the critical reader. It is not as it's title would ſeem to import, an arid pedantic and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphyſical diſcuſſion, but elegant, amuſing, and uſeful criticiſm.</note> Young was as chearful in
converſation as he was gloomy in his
compoſitions, and when a lady expreſſed
her ſurpriſe at his ſocial converſe, he
replied, <q rend="inline">there is much difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
writing and talking.</q> Are we
to credit the good fortune with which
ſome poets ſo often felicitate themſelves,
any more than their deſpondence and
menaces? Thomſon paints the ſcenes of
domeſtic love with all the ſplendid de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corations
of fancy, but knew nothing of
it's reality but a caſual and groſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0238000900:167"/>
Inconſtant men will write on conſtancy,
and licentious minds will elevate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
into poetry and religion. Moral
men will venture to write what they
would not act, while others of inferior
honeſty will act what they will not ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to write.</p>
            <p>To prove that the writings of an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
give no indication of his perſonal
character, we have inſtances ſo multifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious,
that to bring them forward might
weary the moſt patient curioſity. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult
my intereſt, by repreſſing the deſire
of diſplaying my detections.</p>
            <p>It is neceſſary, however, to adduce
a few, that the reader may not flatter
himſelf that he has diſcovered the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions
of an author, either by his ſtyle,
his mode of thinking, or any other lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary
appearance he may aſſume. Balzac
and Voiture are ſo well known, that I
prefer them to ſhew the illuſions of ſtyle.
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:0238000900:168"/>
The letters of the firſt are pompous and
inflated; but his converſation was light
and agreeable. Voiture, who affected
gaiety and gracefulneſs in his compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions,
was in his domeſtic language,
harſh and ſtiff, for having frequented the
nobility, he ever aſſumed the Seigneur.<note n="*" place="bottom">The comedies of M. de St. Foix are light, agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and delicate; his own character was remarkable for moroſeneſs, rudeneſs, and inſociability. Moliere, ſo gay and ſpirited in his comedy, was grave and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive in ſociety.</note>
Writers of great genius have felt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
in awkward ſituations, when the
extraordinary ſentiments they make
their dramatis perſonae utter, are malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
applied to their own character. An
enemy of Shakeſpeare, might have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached
him with his forcible deline<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
of the villain Iago. Crebillon,
indeed, complains in the preface to one
of his tragedies, of ſomething ſimilar.
He ſays, <q rend="inline">they charge me with all the
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:0238000900:169"/>
iniquities of Atreus; and they regard
me, in ſome places, as a wretch with
whom it is unfit to aſſociate; as if all
which the mind invents, muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from the heart.</q> Our poet is,
indeed, a ſtriking inſtance of the little
alliance between the literary and perſonal
diſpoſitions of an author. In his Atreus,
the father drinks the blood of his ſon;
in Rhadamiſtus, the ſon expires by the
hand of the father; and in his Electra,
the ſon aſſaſſinates his mother; yet was
Crebillon the gentleſt and moſt amiable
of men, and who exulted on his entrance
into the French academy, that he had
never tinged his pen with the gall of
ſatire. The impiety of Satan, might
equally be attributed to the poet; and
Dr. Moore might be ſuppoſed the worſt
of men, by his forcible delineation of
Zeluco. A poet is a painter of the ſoul;
if he ſeizes it's deformities, he is a great
artiſt, but not therefore a bad man.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:0238000900:170"/>
I ſpare the reader a number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
that croud on the memory, and
ſhall give only a few reflections which
offer themſelves. One may diſplay with
artful elegance, the moral brilliancy of
the mind, and with ſtrokes of ſentiment,
intereſt the heart by an animated elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.
But this may proceed from a
felicity of manner, and a flexible, verſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile,
and happy genius. The writer's
heart may be as little penetrated by the
charms and virtues he deſcribes, as the
tragic poet would be incapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting
the aſſaſſinations and maſſacres
he commands in a verſe, or details in a
ſcene.</p>
            <p>Montagne appears to have been ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
of this fact in the literary character.
Of authors, he ſays, that he likes to read

            <head>CHAP. XII. Of ſome private Advantages which induce
Men of Letters to become Authors.</head>
            <p>SOME private intereſt enters into his
view who aſſumes the profeſſion of an
author. Such a motive fortunately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſts;
for no reaſoning man would volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily
place himſelf in a ſituation, fraught
with burning anxieties, and with ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening
diſguſts; with hope mingling with
deſpondence; with felicity ſo variable,
that the utmoſt happineſs of an author is
as tranſient and rare, as thoſe fine Italian
ſkies we ſometimes ſee in our unſettled
climate.</p>
            <p>Many are the motives which induce
to become authors; their motives, like
their misfortunes, are peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves;
but the utility they produce ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertains
to the public.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:0238000900:173"/>
Some enter the perilous and brilliant
career of letters, as the only means of
diſtinguiſhing their abilities, and meriting
public eſteem. To any other purſuit,
their ſituation, or their diſpoſitions, may
be incompatible. The reſtleſs activity
of genius torments their repoſe; and
they feel like a young Columbus, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
to a petty port. Theſe are men to
whom glory becomes a kind of aliment,
deprived of which, their paſſions, like a
concealed fire, would ſecretly conſume
the frail machine of humanity. For
ſuch, it is as impoſſible to remain ſilent,
as it is for ſome to be eloquent. They
give a voice to their feelings in their
works.</p>
            <p>Others become authors, as the only
relief they find from the taedium of life.
Helvetius has maintained the ſingular
paradox, that <hi>Ennui</hi> produced many of
our ſuperior writers. Several authors have
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:0238000900:174"/>
invented their works, as ſo many ſchemes
to eſcape from the preſſure of life.
It was an aſſertion drawn, perhaps, from
his own feelings. A financier, luxuria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
in ſplendid opulence, courted by
each ſeductive form of voluptuouſneſs,
already acknowledged as an elegant wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
and a liberal Mecenas, could only
have been induced by this motive to
encounter the cloſe meditation, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borious
arrangement, and the elaborate
elegance of a work which he reſolved
ſhould be poſthumous. It is to <hi>Ennui</hi>
we owe that numerous race of opulent
ſcribblers, who after reiterated ill ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
ſtill pour their plenteous volumes
on a wearied and incurious public. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolles
perſiſted to the laſt in his uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
amuſement of printing books,
and his readers having long ceaſed, he
was compelled to preſent them to his
friends, who, however, were not his
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0238000900:175"/>
readers. There are many writers who
paſs their days in amazing labours, and
are veterans without being known as vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunteers.
Of ſome, a private preſs is
the literary horizon; compoſition pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves
their mind from what a French
writer pleaſantly calls "the horrors of
digeſtion." It is well if they would
only take their phyſic in private. Theſe
are the Shakeſpeares whoſe plays have
been refuſed, and the Addiſons whoſe
ſpectators have never been read.</p>
            <p>Others follow the avocations of an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor
as a means of ſubſiſting on the
produce of virtuous talents; their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
and precarious exiſtence is more
honourable than a ducal revenue, and
more precious than a contractor's loan.
When we know that ſuch a writer has
never violated the dignity of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
but has rigidly reverenced virtue,
and an elevation of ſoul has taught him
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0238000900:176"/>
to repel the inſulting familiarity of the
great, his works receive a new and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental
value. We purſue our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
with confidence, and we dwell on
thoſe fervid ſtrokes which are the natural
expreſſions of a great genius, wreſtling
with a heavy and oppreſſive fortune.</p>
            <p>Literature is, indeed, the only refuge
for genius, placed in obſcure ſituations.
It is an avenue to glory, open for thoſe
ingenious men, who, deprived of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
or of wealth, may by their medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations,
ſometimes obtain both; or if
they do not obtain either, may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
ſuperior to them. To many young
writers the idea may be conſolatory and
animating, that the greater part of our
firſt authors have ennobled themſelves,
and owed nothing to their parents. The
great Grecian orator, was the ſon of a
ſinith; the prince of Latin poets, of a
potter; the fineſt ſatiriſt and ode writer
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0238000900:177"/>
of antiquity, of a franchiſed man; the
brilliant Flechier, of a tallow chandler;
the eloquent Maſſillon, of a tanner; and
the philoſophers Rouſſeau and Diderot,
of a watch-maker and a cutler; in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
the moſt nervous of moral eſſayiſts,
was the ſon of one who kept a book ſtall;
the author of the Pleaſures of Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
was the ſon of a butcher; and the
greater author of the American Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
of a tallow chandler.</p>
            <p>Genius has the prerogative of raiſing
the inferior ranks of men to the higher
claſſes of ſociety. This once obtained,
the age is juſt; and the higher claſſes
become inferior.</p>
            <p>We muſt not paſs over in ſilence, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages
better known, attending the
occupations of literary men. Thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived
from ſtudious habits, would be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
to attach the elegant mind to
literature, if reaſon had much power
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0238000900:178"/>
over the paſſions; the attraction is irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtible,
when reaſon itſelf becomes a
paſſion.</p>
            <p>The pleaſures of literature have long
been a favourite amplification of elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
and I quote not the admirable
reflections or of Cicero, or of Pliny, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliar
to every man of taſte. He who
conſecrates himſelf to letters, eſcapes
from the reſtleſs deſires of the multitude.
The mephitic air of vulgar paſſions can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
reach him; as, we are informed of
the pernicious vapour of the lake of the
dogs in Italy, that if a perſon does not
bend downwards, it cannot affect him.
Is he opulent? he has ſufficient firmneſs
to remain enamoured of literary labour.
Is he poor? he has ſufficient intrepidity
to become illuſtrious. The firſt effect of
a love of letters communicates virtue and
independence; for he has ſilenced many
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0238000900:179"/>
private paſſions, and inhabits the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior,
not the ſuperficies of his ſoul.</p>
            <p>It is a curious obſervation of one
Martinelli, an Italian, who, to prove
that Study ſoftens the manners, ſays, that
rarely men of letters are aſſaſſins in Italy,
duelliſts in France, or ſuicides in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
It is true we want not the opinion
of Martinelli, becauſe it has been ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly
ſaid by Horace, repeated by the
thinking Hume, and is to be found
in every book of rhetoric, in the firſt
chapter.</p>
            <p>Literature is the only conſolation in
thoſe terrible afflictions, when we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced
by the privation of a ſenſe, to take
our laſt refuge under the domeſtic roof.
Blindneſs itſelf is no impediment to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius;
fatal to all, it is an advantage to
an active imagination. It's powers collect
more forcibly and burn more intenſely.
It is poſſible to form a catalogue of men
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0238000900:180"/>
of learning who have projected and
finiſhed conſiderable works in this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.
Often, too, has the gate of the
priſon been the porch of fame, and a
ſlight indiſpoſition conferred immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.
A man of letters can never be ſaid
to be exiled or impriſoned.</p>
            <p>It is even to be ſuppoſed, againſt the
popular opinion, that ſtudy is friendly to
the conſtitution. A life of letters is calm
and uniform, and cheriſhes the mild af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections.
An author, if he feels not too
ſenſibly an occaſional diſappointment,
and can forgive the malice of an enemy,
finds his ſtudies produce a happy influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
over his health. Hourly acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
bring new delights, and thought
from thought is purſued with tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity;
and delight and tranquillity are
medicines to the ſoul, and promoters of
health. Every production of taſte re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires
a ſoftening balm, which ſweetens
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0238000900:181"/>
that continuity of attention only expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
by men of ſtudy. If an anatomiſt
could deſcribe accurately the ſenſations
of a man of taſte, and explain this pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable
and harmonious play of the nerves,
no ſtate of exiſtence might, perhaps, be
found more friendly to the human frame.
Every one in the habits of ſtudy has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
the influence of the mind over the
body; and Addiſon has noticed the
pleaſures of the imagination as conducive
to health.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>On this ſubject the following anecdote is curious. Alphonſo of Arragon, was a prince paſſionately en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amoured of literature. When he lay much indiſpoſed, and could find no relief from his phyſicians, his cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers brought whatever preſents they imagined might amuſe him; Panormita judged proper to preſent him with books, among which was a Quintus Curtius, which appears to have had a wonderful effect over the ſtudious Alphonſo. He heard with ſuch delight, the Hiſtory of Alexander the Great, that after the firſt day he felt himſelf relieved, and before the concluſion of the work, aſtoniſhed his phyſicians, by a perfect recovery. He ever afterwards contemned the doctors and their Hippocrates and Avicenna, and ſaid he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired no other medicine while he poſſeſſed Quintus Curtius. <hi>Valeant Hippocrates, Avicena, et Medici caeteri, Vivat Curtius ſoſpitator meus.</hi>
                  </p>
               </note> The greater number of emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
writers have attained to an advanced
age. In an eſſay by Dr. Ruſhworth, a
number of ages of great ſtudents are col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected,
and his opinion is confirmed by
ſufficient teſtimonies. Bayle ſtill pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0238000900:182"/>
further, by ſaying, that ſtudy is
not hurtful to the conſtitution even in
early youth. Shenſtone has, however,
echoed in one of his elegies, the vulgar
opinion,<q>But ſoon the paths of health and and fame divide.</q> If by the path of fame, our amiable wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
meant ſtudy, his ill health was never
occaſioned by profound learning.</p>
            <p>Some, perhaps, will not deem as one
of the inferior advantages of an author,
that of his admiſſion among the higher
circles. If in the preſent age, no writer
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0238000900:183"/>
can reaſonably hope that his ſtudies will
open the golden gate of preferment, or
of fortune, he may at leaſt, when he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
to eminence, be certain of receiving
the tribute which opulent vanity pays to
his talents. But an author is little in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
to ſuch notice; the attentions of
a brilliant circle are ill-timed; it is, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
twenty years too late. It is alſo
to be obſerved, that few men of taſte can
accuſtom themſelves to the refinements
of opulent grandeur, without creating
artificial wants, which they can never
gratify; and their future life may feel
the irritation of pleaſures not to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed,
and elegance not to be found.
To ſuch may often be applied the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation
of Milton's Adam, when obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
to exile himſelf from paradiſe—
<q>
                  <l>—How ſhall I breathe in other air</l>
                  <l>Leſs pure, accuſtomed to immortal fruits?</l>

The ſociety of the great is little flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:0238000900:184"/>
for it requires a painful vigilance to
preſerve dignity with ſuch aſſociates.
D'Alembert has written an admired eſſay
on the connection between literary men,
and theſe men. A man of letters who
had the misfortune of living with a lord,
finely ſaid of him, <q rend="inline">he would familiariſe
himſelf with me; but I repel him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectfully.</q>
An anecdote related of
Piron is not leſs intereſting. This man
of genius had formed the moſt elevated
notion of the dignity of a man of letters;
nor would ſuffer the literary character to
be lowered in his preſence. Entering the
apartment of a nobleman, who was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducting
another peer to the ſtairs, the
noble ſtopped to make way for Piron,
paſs on, my lord, ſaid the noble maſter,
paſs, he is only a poet.—Piron replied,
<q rend="inline">ſince our qualities are declared, I ſhall
take my rank,</q> and he placed himſelf
before the lord.</p>

If the voice of an individual can weigh
with an author, it is when it ſpeaks in a
foreign accent. The enquiry of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent
foreigner ſounds like the diſtant
plaudit of poſterity. Fontenelle was never
more gratified than when a Swede, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riving
at the gates of Paris, enquired of
the officers of the cuſtoms where Fon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenelle
reſided, and expreſſed his indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation

            <p>There are ſome hours in the life of a
man of genius, which, it may be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed,
communicate an exquiſite ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
to his feelings. It is when he
perceives the world ſpontaneouſly pay
their tribute of reſpect to his abilities.
It is ſaid of Corneille, that he had his

when he entered, the audience roſe to

a humble livelihood by grinding glaſſes
at an obſcure village in Holland, was
viſited by the firſt general in Europe,
who, for this conference, ſuſpended the
march of his army, and traverſed a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant

as he paſſed the ſtreets; and the people
followed him with tears of affection, as
the apoſtles of genius and humanity.
Lavater, receives daily the tribute of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity

            <head>CHAP. XIII. Of the Utility of Authors to Individuals.</head>
            <p>WE have reaſon to believe, that
wherever authors are virtuous and free,
their nation partakes moſt of virtue and
of freedom; as on the contrary, where
they are diſſolute and enſlaved, their
nation have as little morals as liberty.
We want a diſſertation on the influence
of manners on taſte, and of taſte on
manners. Sir Joſhua Reynolds, in one
of his diſcourſes, obſerves, that <q rend="inline">in the
ornaments of the arts we find the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtical
mark of a national taſte,
as by throwing up a feather, we know
which way the wind blows, better than
by a more heavy matter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The morals of a nation are oftener di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected
by authors, than by thoſe modern
apoſtles who poſſeſs vaſt incomes, and
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0238000900:188"/>
ſtolen ſermons. Authors are the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers
of morality, and the arbiters of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners.
They perform the office of the
<hi>Cenſor Morum</hi>; and if they do not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways
live like the Catos of their age,
their works may effect the ſame benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
influence; for, like the language of
Cato, they are ſo many reprimands for
folly, and remonſtrances for vice.</p>
            <p>An author ſometimes appears, who
gives a new direction to the national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
In mechanics, no impulſion,
from a ſingle hand, can communicate to
a body the force of eternal movement.
In morals it is different; for there an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual
power can for ever endow with
action the TRUTH it impels. Theſe are
the few authors who form revolutions,
not, perhaps, in the ſublime ſciences,
which are reſerved for the contemplation
of a few, but in that happier knowledge
which is of daily uſe, and addreſſed to
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0238000900:189"/>
thoſe who moſt want inſtruction. Theſe
authors are not a Newton and a Locke;
but an Addiſon and a Fontenelle. Theſe
two eminent writers ſhall illuſtrate this
reflection. The Spectators introduced
literature and morals in the nation; the
young, the gay, and the fair, who flew
from the terrific form of a folio, were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
by the light graces of a fugitive
page. Since that happy moment the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
of taſte, and the curioſity of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,
have produced readers who are
now enabled to diſcern the ſhades of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance;
to appreciate compoſitions of
genius; and to adjuſt the merits of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
competitors by the ſcale of phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
taſte. We have become a
reading, and of courſe a critical nation.
A refined writer is now certain of finding
readers who can comprehend him. Of
all our great men, whatever department
they have illuſtrated, who has left to the
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0238000900:190"/>
nation a more valuable inheritance than
Addiſon? Thouſands hear the name of
Marlborough, but the battle of Blenheim
leaves no impreſſion. The name of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon
excites affection; and his Spectators
remind the modeſt reader where he firſt
gained inſtruction, and the great writer
where he firſt felt the influence of taſte,
and where he ſtill learns the art of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p>Fontenelle operated the ſame kind of
revolution in France. Before his bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
wit and exact ſcience were united,
learning was the ſolitary enjoyment of
the learned. Aſtronomy and erudition
were reſerved for the aſtronomer and the
erudit. Each ſpoke his own language;
Fontenelle was their interpreter. He
explained vaſt totalities by gradual de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions,
and ſublime conceptions, by
familiar ideas. The lady at her toilette
deſcribed the motions of a heavenly body,
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0238000900:191"/>
while ſhe was regulating her own; and
the beau monde had a finer penetration
into the nature of oracles, than the
pedant Van Dale, who had written ſo co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piouſly,
and whom no one could read.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the valued authors who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
and ſoothe their fellow-citizens;
the benefactors of every man. A mind
happily diſpoſed imbibes their felicity of
character. We read, among the Perſian
fables of Sadi, of a ſwimmer, who, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
found a piece of common earth, was
aſtoniſhed at it's fragrance, and enquired
if it were muſk or amber? <q rend="inline">No,</q> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the perfumed mould, <q rend="inline">I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
but common earth; but roſes
were planted on my ſoil, and their
odorous virtues have deliciouſly pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated
through all my pores. I have
retained the infuſion of ſweetneſs; I
had otherwiſe been but common
earth.</q>—Sadi ingeniouſly applies this
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0238000900:192"/>
poetical incident to the effect his miſtreſs
produces over him. We may alſo apply
it to an eſſay of Addiſon, or a dialogue
of Fontenelle, which, like the roſes on
the common earth, impregnate with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
ſweetneſs an uncultivated mind.</p>
            <p>Thoſe who feel with enthuſiaſm the
eloquence of a fine writer, inſenſibly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
ſome particles from it; a virtuous
writer communicates virtue; a refined
writer, a ſubtile delicacy; a ſublime
writer, an elevation of ſentiment. All
theſe characters of the mind, in a few
years, are diffuſed throughout the nation.
Among us, what acute reaſoners has the
refined penetration of Hume formed;
what amenity of manners has not Addiſon
introduced; to how many virtuous youths
have not the moral eſſays of Johnſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
fortitude, and illumined with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:0238000900:193"/>
It is preſumed, that while they thus
powerfully operate on the <hi>minds</hi> of their
<hi>readers,</hi> their <hi>own minds,</hi> in the practice
of their ſtudies, are influenced in a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
manner. One of the moſt pleaſing
paſſages in the platonic Shafteſbury, is
to this purpoſe; and though we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
proved it, not exactly conformable
to facts, it is not entirely a brilliant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie.
Our noble author, comparing the
writer with the ſculptor and the painter,
ſays, that <q rend="inline">there is this eſſential differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
between the artiſts of each kind;
that they who deſign merely after
<hi>bodies,</hi> and form the graces of this ſort,
can never, with all their accuracy, or
correctneſs of deſign, be able to reform
themſelves, or grow a jot more ſhapely
in their perſons. But for thoſe artiſts,
who copy from another life, who ſtudy
the graces and perfections of <hi>minds,</hi>
and are real maſters of thoſe rules which
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:0238000900:194"/>
conſtitute this latter ſcience, 'tis impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
they ſhould fail of being them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>improved</hi> and <hi>amended</hi> in their
better part.</q> That delightful enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſt
Richardſon the father, in one of his
fine dreams, inſiſts (as others indeed
have done) that great virtue is neceſſary
even for painters; and that genius has
been leſs or greater, as virtue and vice
prevailed in the mind of the artiſt. When
we read an amiable compoſition, and
obſerve the character of the author to be
the reverſe, there appears an indecent
oppoſition, which revolts our ſenſibility,
and makes us contemn the writer as a
miſerable impoſtor.</p>
            <p>This ſcience of the mind, noticed by
Shafteſbury, is not metaphyſics, but
what has been happily called "the
proper ſtudy of mankind;" Man acting
in ſociety. The philoſophic genius ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels
in the ſtudy of the world; he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0238000900:195"/>
this advantage from the obſcurity
of his ſituation, the verſatility of his
mind, and the habit of meditation.
Thoſe whoſe <hi>chief occupation</hi> is not <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection,</hi>
limit the knowledge of human
nature to the particular ſociety they are
accuſtomed. A courtier, a lawyer, and
a merchant, contemplate the human
heart, in different lights; but nature is
ill underſtood by thoſe whoſe capacities
are habituated to detect one principle
among many. She has no character, but
many characters; ſhe is not to be ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tematized,
but to be purſued. The
man of genius acts upon more general
principles; and makes the human heart
his amuſement and his occupation. The
theatre, conducted by ſuch writers, would
become a national ſchool; but we muſt
then have fewer pantomimes, and ſuch
operas and comedies as we have now,
ſtill fewer than pantomimes.</p>

The philoſophical traveller enters no
town but he feels the regards of a citizen,

            <head>CHAP. XIV. Of the political Influence of Authors.</head>
            <p>OPINION, ſays Sophocles, is ſtronger
than Truth; Opinion is the ſovereign of
man; and authors, who are the propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gators
of her decrees, are ſome of the
moſt important perſons in ſociety, and
may be called the miniſters of ſtate to
Opinion.</p>
            <p>An author has the ſingular prerogative
of uniting in himſelf the powers that are
portioned among the higher orders of
ſociety. This reflection may appear fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful
to thoſe who are deſtitute of fancy;
and extravagant to thoſe who conſider
paper and pens as the compoſition of the
manufacturer, and who ſee nothing in
them but rags and feathers.</p>
            <p>An eloquent author, who writes in the
immutable language of truth, will one
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0238000900:198"/>
day be ſuperior to every power in the ſtate.
His influence is active, though hidden;
every truth is an acorn which is laid in
the earth, and which often the longer
it takes to riſe, the more vigorous and
magnificent will be it's maturity. What
has been long meditated in the ſilence of
the ſtudy, will one day refound in the
aweful voice of public opinion. The
chief magiſtrate can command; the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nator
can perſuade; the judge can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide;
the ſoldier can conquer. A great
author obtains theſe various purpoſes at
once by his ſolitary labours. His truths
command; his eloquence perſuades; his
reaſon decides; and his works inſpire a
rival nation with a more enduring re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect,
than even a victorious army.</p>
            <p>An iſland, once inconſiderable in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope,
now ranks among the firſt powers,
arbitrates among other nations, and the
very title of it's inhabitants enſures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0238000900:199"/>
Is this owing, alone, to her com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial
proſperity and military force?
One nation has the moſt flouriſhing mart
of trade, and another is one of the moſt
martial people; yet neither inſpire man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind
with veneration or affection. To
themſelves is confined their rude lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage;
ſtudied, perhaps, by merchants,
and corrupted as it is ſtudied. It is
more by an interchange of opinions, than
of ſpices and ſpecie, that a nation is
eſteemed.</p>
            <p>Not thus with England; for ſhe derives
her ſplendour from her writers, as well
as her ſoldiers, and her navigators. An
empire merely founded on force, is ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded
by enemies, and often it's ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt
enemies are to be found in it's own
unparental boſom. An empire diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed
by it's literature, conceals it's
martial iron under the ſweeteſt flowers;
extends her conqueſts, and diffuſes her
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0238000900:200"/>
pleaſures, and among hoſtile foreigners,
acquires new friends.</p>
            <p>This truth we ourſelves have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.
France preceded us in the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
of humanity, and her polite litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
more forcibly operated on the world,
than even her armies and her fleet; her
civility and refinement vanquiſhed, when
theſe were defeated. At that period in
ſociety, when the intellectual taſtes of
men become ſo many wants, theſe gave
an univerſal diffuſion to her language.
The nation that ſupplies a harveſt for
this appetency of the mind, extends it's
dominions in the hearts of the ſubjects of
other powers. Thus Pope, with equal
ſagacity and taſte, writes
<q>
                  <l>We conquered France, but felt our captive's charms,</l>
                  <l>Her arts victorious triumphed o'er our arms.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Let us now contemplate the reverſe of
the medal; and the reverſe is more beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful
than the face. In the middle of the
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0238000900:201"/>
laſt century, our manners were as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
as our language; and neither
were yet formed and poliſhed. We were
nearly regarded as valorous barbarians,
partaking of the glooms of our clime;
and whom nature had benevolently ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated,
from neighbours more poliſhed,
and airs more ſerene. We now hold to
Europe models of ſolid ſenſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found
reaſoning. Our late admired
writers have made a neglected language
the ſtudy of reflecting foreigners; they
calmed the national hatred of France,
and compelled even our rivals inceſſantly
to celebrate our merits, when, unlike
themſelves, we condeſcended not to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ult,
but to perform our labours with a
modeſt ſilence. Before our preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
diſſentions, it was our nation they
ſighed to emulate; and the firſt writers
of France paſſed into England to learn
to think and write; or thought and
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0238000900:202"/>
wrote like Engliſhmen in France, undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed
by the terrors of a corrupted go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.
From our hands they received
the germs of reflection, and the flower of
liberty. This ſingular revolution in the
human mind was produced not by our
merchants or our admirals, but by our
Lockes, our Popes, and our Addiſons.
They have ſubjugated the minds of mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions
by the energy of an intellectual ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty.
The works of Engliſh authors
are now printed at foreign preſſes, and
this at leaſt as much as the commerce
and the force of England, proves the
aſcendancy of her genius.</p>
            <p>The utility of men of letters to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
purpoſes is not attended to by
every ſtateſman; for few ſtateſmen (like
other men in office) are either worthy of,
or competent to their employments. The
author is conſidered by the great as a
ſubordinate character in ſociety; as if
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0238000900:203"/>
the art of inſtructing men, the art of a
Socrates, was much inferior to that of
governing them, the art, often of a Nero,
or a Sardanapalus, and, according to
Machiavel, of a Ceſar Borgia.</p>
            <p>Political theoriſts, however, appear to
conſider the worſt actions of men, as of
far leſs conſequence than the propagation
of their opinions. A dangerous man may
infect his neighbours, but the dangerous
writer ſpreads a contagion throughout a
nation. Books, and ſometimes their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors,
have been burnt; but even this
mode of criticiſm was found ineffectual.
The flame which deſtroyed an indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual,
ever enlightened a people; and the
burning of books, has not yet been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as their refutation.</p>
            <p>If thoſe who adminiſter the public
duties of government, were more cloſely
allied with men of letters, the union
would be happy for the people, and uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0238000900:204"/>

who govern are not always the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The attic Harris of Saliſbury, in his "Philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Arrangements," has touched on this topic, and adduced ſeveral ſplendid facts to enforce his judicious reflections. He has ſhewn, <q rend="inline">that ſome of the moſt il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious actors upon the great theatre of the world, have been engaged in philoſophical ſpeculations.</q> But what is more to our purpoſe, we may obſerve that ſome of the greateſt ſtateſmen have attached themſelves to a philoſopher. Pericles had his Anaxagoras; Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pio his Polybius; Ceſar and Pompey, their Ariſto and Cratippus; Zenobia her Longinus; and Plutarch ſaid of Alexander, <q rend="inline">that he marched againſt the Perſians with better ſupplies from his preceptor Ariſtotle, than from his father Philip.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is alſo very certain, that the philoſophical is not incompatible with the political character. Sir Walter Raleigh; the De Wits; Thuanus; Grotius; Sir William Temple, Bolingbroke, &amp;c. are ſufficient to name. Literary men may become miniſters of ſtate, but it is more difficult for miniſters of ſtate to become literary men.</p>

            <p>Authors ſtand between the governors

the art of arranging their thoughts, and
of agitating the paſſions, who at once
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:0238000900:205"/>
penetrate by their reaſon, and inflame by
their eloquence, are, among the nations
of modern Europe, what the celebrated
orators of ancient Rome and Athens
were among the aſſembled citizens. They
awaken, they terrify, they excite, they

            <p>Miniſters are conſtrained to watch till
vigilance is exhauſted, and ſolicitude
ſleeps amidſt the fluctuations of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic

creation of the philoſophical writer. Is
it to be doubted, that ſince the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal
labour of Monteſquieu, the old ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems
of government have been often
changed? It is certain the minds of the
people have. Cromwell, the penetrating
Cromwell, was juſtly alarmed when he
ſaw the Oceana of Harrington, and
ſeems to have dreaded the terrible effects
of a little volume, much more than the
plots of the royaliſts. The ſingle thought
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:0238000900:206"/>
of a man of genius has ſometimes chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
the diſpoſitions of a people, and even

            <p>Wherever the liberty of the preſs is
eſtabliſhed, authors form as powerful a
claſs in ſociety, as the higheſt. For the
great, nothing remains but to annihilate
the preſs, or to reſpect the authors. In
Rome, a Perſius may have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled
to diſguiſe the name of a Nero,
but in England, the name of a tyrant
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:0238000900:207"/>
will be hitched in rhime. Authors are
moſt to be dreaded in that country where
the liberty and licentiouſneſs of the preſs,
become a mere matter of ſentiment, and
not of diſcuſſion; and this ſentiment is
left to the people. We who enjoy the
freedom of the preſs in it's extreme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
have no reaſon to complain of any
privileges of the great.</p>
            <p>The people conſider authors as their
property; and not unjuſtly, ſince the
great ſuffer them to depend on the
people. The public are never ſlow to
unite with authors, who, for the ſake of
preſerving equality, muſt continually
humble the great. The public, as pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons,
are the moſt munificent; as abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors,
the moſt formidable. Their favour
is equitably obtained; they expect an
author to be the bold interpreter of their
ſecret ſentiments, and the protector of
their liberties, as well as the artiſt of
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0238000900:208"/>
their pleaſures. If this author is perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted,
he is never forſaken; his cauſe
becomes the cauſe of the people; but if
he ſhould prove a wretched adventurer;
who artfully ſeiſed on an occaſion to ſerve
his private views, the author is juſtly
neglected, and the cauſe alone purſued.
We live in an age, in which an honeſt
man begins to know his value; and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity
and poverty, if adorned with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity
and philoſophy, are not injurious
to the opinions of a great mind. We
conſider that perſonal merit, is ſuperior
to perſonal honour; becauſe it now in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes
perſonal honour. The contrary
will not hold, nor has this always been ſo.</p>
            <p>The public are not diſpleaſed when the
great become the patrons of their emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
authors; it is a kind of homage paid
to the ſentiments of the people. But the
author may be a conſiderable loſer, if he
values fame, more than he does a penſion.</p>

It is curious to obſerve the ſolitary
man of letters in the concealment of his
obſcure ſtudy, ſeparated from the croud,
unknown to his contemporaries, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting
the materials of inſtruction from
every age and every country; combining
with the preſent the example of the paſt,
and the prediction of the future; pouring
forth the valuable ſecrets of his medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
to poſterity; ſtriking with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſion
of new light the public mind;
and forming the manners, the opinions,
the refinement, and the morals of his

obſerve ſuch a man, by ſome contemned,
by others hated; by ſome degraded to
an idler or an outcaſt, and by others
raiſed to a fancied monſter; a Briareus
extending a hundred arms, and in every

a hundred eyes, and tracing the
vermin of corruption, creeping to their
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0238000900:210"/>
moſt hidden receſſes; in a word, as awe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
a figure as that of the vaſt mountain,
to which the caprice of a tyrant attempted
to give a Coloſſal form, by commanding
the people to hew it to his immoderate
fancy.</p>
            <p>But the philoſopher is not, as of late,
too often repreſented this Coloſſal ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity.
Legal authority is moſt ſecure
when the people are moſt enlightened;
a ſimple truth, which I leave to profound
politicians to explain. I ſhall only cite
the ſentiment of an old poet.<q>
                  <l>—De la majeſtè des Loix,</l>

            <p>It is a dreadful moment when the
people and the great alike refuſe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions
of the philoſopher; whenever
he appears terrible, ſome great corruption
pervades the ſtate, for he is only armed
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0238000900:211"/>
with truth. The occupations of the
philoſophical ſtudent, as connected with
political ſpeculations, are therefore du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
of an exalted nature; ſome muſt give
their hands, ſome their blood, and ſome
their hours, to the various duties their
country exacts; but there is a ſmall
portion of men, who appear marked out
by nature, for the purpoſe of cultivating
their thoughts in peace, and to give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
to their ſentiments by diſcloſing
them to the people. The phyſiognomy
of their minds, wears all that ſhining
luſtre, which diſtinguiſhed the prophet
after his immediate conference with the
Divinity; for in their compoſitions, good
ſenſe is embelliſhed by eloquence, and
before they perſuade, they convince.
None, but thoſe who devote a life to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation,

Legiſlators of extenſive views, have
ever protected and honoured men of
letters. We have ſeen, in this age, two
great powers in Europe teſtify their pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
utility, and who have been as ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous
to aſſemble philoſophers, as to
form their armies. Pruſſia and Ruſſia,
under the government of two great ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigns,
have ſhewn how far by their aid
an obſcure principality, and hordes of
barbarians, may be elevated in the ſcale
of humanity. The great Frederick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited
to his court the perſecuted and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy
literati; and to this holy ſhrine of
philoſophy reſorted many a literary pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grim.
The imperial Catharine has not
only largely penſioned ſeveral illuſtrious
writers, but honours and animates, by her
gifts, the attempt of every philoſopher
who produces a public utility. If theſe
ſovereigns have diſplayed more art than
humanity, in forging chains for the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0238000900:213"/>
of men; it ſhews that an Antoninus and
an Alfred, are more rare than a Frederick
and a Catharine, as the love of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
is leſs difficult than practical philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophy;
the only philoſophy that merits
the name.</p>
            <p>It is the philoſophical writer who alone
reflects on what is not done, and on what
may be done. He goads the ſluggiſh
veins of government, when a cold indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
ſpreads a torpor on it's unhealth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
inactivity. He teaches philanthropy
to direct it's bounties in proper channels,
and this is no inconſiderable good; for
the humanity which diſtinguiſhes our
age, is often only retarded by an igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
of it's neceſſities; to perceive and
pathetically to deſcribe theſe neceſſities,
is reſerved for the ſenſitive philoſopher.
It is the characteriſtic of a man of genius,
in ſuch appeals to our boſoms, that his
glowing mind pours forth thoſe ſervid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0238000900:214"/>
that agitation of ideas, thoſe
pictures of truth, which communicate his
own ſenſations, and animate with his
exquiſite ſoul, the ſouls of others. The
people are a vaſt body, and men of
genius are the eyes and hands.</p>
            <p>The thouſand public utilities, I ſpeak
not of the elegancies, derived from the
multifarious diviſions of ſcience and of
art, can alone be perfected by THE PHI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LOSOPHICAL
GENIUS. Truth is a certain
point in knowledge; ages ſucceed ages;
and that point is paſſed, or not attained;
a philoſophical genius ariſes, ſeiſes and
fixes it in the vaſt expanſe of nature, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
by it's own weight from the mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of time. A Newton and a Locke ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh
that in which an Ariſtotle and
a Deſcartes failed. But theſe truths,
which form ſo many epochs in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
underſtanding, are covered in the
ſublime obſcurity of nature; how is the
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0238000900:215"/>
veil to be lifted from Iſis? A painful
meditation alone elaborates them into
exiſtence. In the arts, important diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
are obtained by accident; but
the precious idea, which depends on a
long train of reaſoning, can never be
formed by chance. Philoſophers muſt
meditate; and too often their medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
are purſued at the coſt of their
felicity.</p>
            <p>Yet let us not confound true PHILOSO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>PHERS
with dreaming THEORISTS. They
are not more engaged in cultivating the
mind, than the earth; the annals of agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture
are as valuable as the annals of
hiſtory; and while they inſtruct ſome to
think, they teach others to labour.
PHILOSOPHY extends it's thoughts on
whatever the eye has ſeen, or the hand
has touched; it herbaliſes in fields; it
ſounds mines; it is on the waters, and
in the foreſts; it is in the library, and
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:0238000900:216"/>
the laboratory; it arranges the calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of finance; it invents the police of
a city; it erects it's fortifications; it
gives velocity to our fleets; in a word,
it is alike in the ſolitude of deſerts, as in
the populouſneſs of manufactories. The
GENIUS of PHILOSOPHY pierces every
where, and on whatever it reſts, like the
ſun, it diſcovers what lay concealed, or
matures what it found imperfect.</p>

as of ſorrow.<note n="*" place="bottom">It muſt not be forgotten that ſeveral authors have received penſions; Dr. Henry, Dr. Johnſon, and at preſent Mr. Cowper the poet, have been honoured by his Majeſty's attentions. But ſuch ſolitary rewards are like fountains in the burning deſerts of Arabia.

            <p>I begin theſe obſervations with a lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
tranſcription of the opening of Sir
Joſhua Reynolds's firſt diſcourſe. The
Preſident ſays, <q rend="inline">it is indeed difficult to
give any other reaſon why an empire,
like that of BRITAIN, ſhould ſo long
have wanted an ornament ſo ſuitable
to it's greatneſs, than that ſlow pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion

makes elegance and refinement the laſt
effect of opulence and power.</q>—Of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:0238000900:219"/>
opulence and power, have the higher
claſſes of our nation a deficient meaſure?
I doubt, indeed, if they really poſſeſs, as
a body, or elegance or refinement. The
philoſopher is not dazzled by elegance
and refinement in manners; he does not
confound the brilliancy of equipages with
the energies of the mind. To his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templative
eye it is poſſible that an opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent
and ſplendid nation may be barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous
and groſs; as we obſerve in the
individual, who, adorned by the inſignia
of honour, and loaded with incalculable
wealth, may at the ſame time have all
the barbarity of mind which marks and
degrades the loweſt of the populace.
Should the greater part of the nobility of
any country be more partial to pugiliſts
and jockies, than to artiſts and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers,
the hiſtorian would be juſtified in
recording that the genius of it's nobility
was barbarous and groſs. It is almoſt
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:0238000900:220"/>
peculiar to literature, that whenever it's
profeſſors feel themſelves contemned or
neglected, to vindicate their cauſe, they
have only to record this contempt and
this neglect.</p>
            <p>I would aſk why the art of writing is
not deſerving of the ſame regard as the
art of painting? And then I would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
what painting can urge in it's
own cauſe, which will entitle it to a ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority
over the art of compoſition?</p>
            <p>But it may be urged that an inſtitution
of this kind, while it has been recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended
by ſome, has been oppoſed by
others. Perhaps, in our country, it has
never been examined with the attention
ſuch an object claims; often it's defects
have been rendered prominent, and it's
benefits omitted; it's inabilities have
been diſplayed, and it's powers have been

a common place for ridicule, not as a

Johnſon, in his Life of Swift, has
given ſome plauſible arguments againſt
the academy which Swift propoſed; the
arguments of this great man, more ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
than juſt, relate not to our preſent
ſubject; for the academy Swift was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous
of eſtabliſhing, was merely an imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
of the French academy; for the
poliſhing, refining, and embelliſhing the
language. The Engliſh language now
wants no academy for it's improvements;
it has few acquiſitions to make, but much
to preſerve.</p>
            <p>A literary inſtitution might be formed,
in which the errors of former academies
might be obviated, and the advanced
genius of our times might add it's own

There is one kind of men, to whom

the ſhady walks of the ACADEMY
(that reſort of the Muſes which has left
it's name to all future literary ſocieties)
to be torn up, and the hallowed trees to

addreſs myſelf not to the living Syllas,
who are as inimical to a modern, as their

            <p>On the firſt glance we take of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
the French academy, properly ſo

have not been great; becauſe it's

I trace the hiſtory of French ſtyle, in the
harangues of this academy. The firſt
are cold, dry, and full of thoſe common
turns of expreſſion, which were doubtleſs
conſidered as the <hi>curioſa felicitas,</hi> but
which, by their reiterated appearance,
ſhew the barrenneſs of their diction, and
the paucity of happy expreſſions. The
language was not yet formed; and the

empty treaſury. About the middle vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes,
eloquence occaſionally appears,
an acceſſion of new turns enrich the ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangues,

it is not devoid of grace. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding

a warmth of colouring, a boldneſs

            <p>I would not deny that one ſuperior
genius is capable of obtaining what forty
inferior ones can never accompliſh; and
I even add, that one great author can
perform better than forty great authors.
No celebrated work has yet been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
by the united talents of ſeveral;
but many great men have conjoined their
abilities in vain, in various works.</p>
            <p>The mechanical operation of compi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
a dictionary, however, I believe,
may be better effected by a ſociety, than
by an individual. The dictionary of
Johnſon, though perhaps it could not be
more finely executed, might have been
conſiderably augmented by a ſociety.
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:0238000900:225"/>
Does not this great man himſelf, hoſtile
as he appears to academies, inconſciouſly
acknowledge their utility, by complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
that his labour was not formed under
"the ſhelter of academic bowers."</p>
            <p>It appears to me, that the happieſt
effect is obtained when an academy and
an individual unite their powers. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain
myſelf by the following circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
            <p>D'Alembert, in his Eloge of the Abbè
Deſmarais, obſerves, that the long arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of the French dictionary were written
by him, and that the public conſidered
them as more finiſhed, and more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory
than the ſhort ones. D'Alembert
gives the reaſon. He obſerves, that
<q rend="inline">the brevity of articles of little extent,
allowed of their being the work of the
whole ſociety; and that a ſociety col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected
in a body, diſturbed in it's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſions
by twenty different opinions,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:0238000900:226"/>
which croſs and deſtroy one another,
muſt with difficulty attain to ſatisfy it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
and it's readers; but, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
the great articles, indiſpenſably
given to the care of an individual, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire,
in paſſing through his hands,
all the perfection which the ſelf-love of
the writer can give, animated alſo by
the academical fervour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This judicious reflection of one of the
moſt judicious writers of France, may
ſerve to prove that a work is beſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by an individual; but that an
individual, while he labours under the
eye of a ſociety, feels a ſtimulative in
that ſociety, which otherwiſe had been
wanting.</p>
            <p>And this is the great end and utility of
ſuch an inſtitution. It's various advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages
are, perhaps, ſufficiently obvious;
but the vaſt influence it has over writers,
has not, perhaps, been ſufficiently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked.
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:0238000900:227"/>
It animates not only the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals
of the ſociety, but every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual
who aſpires to become a member
of the ſociety, and to wear, as Voltaire
ſaid, the blue ribband of literature. By
a diſtribution of prizes, it diffuſes an
emulation to the remoteſt parts of the
kingdom, and introduces to the public
thoſe ingenuous youths, whom their ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
conceals from the world. By it's
own memoirs, written by the members,
it forms the moſt valuable literary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitories
in a nation. To reflect on
theſe advantages may not be uſeleſs.</p>
            <p>Some of the inferior benefits attending
ſuch an inſtitution, are indiſputable. In
theſe literary conferences, the taſte of
every aſſociate would become more bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant,
becauſe it would continually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
the attrition and contact, it is to
be ſuppoſed, of the fineſt underſtandings
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:0238000900:228"/>
in the nation.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>The following obſervations on <hi>Academies,</hi> cited by Goujet in his Bibliotheque Francoiſe, vol. 2. p. 453, are from one of the numerous political works of the Abbè de Saint Pierre. They are too ingenious to be paſſed in ſilence. He ſays, <q rend="inline">what ſupplies among men the method of univerſities, is the method of academies, or conferences which are held on mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of their profeſſion, or their taſte. They do not hear a profeſſor, or a regent, but they hear one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. They hear, with greater attention, thoſe who have acquired greater reputation in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; they improve by a reciprocation of obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations; they contradict their equals, and they are contradicted; and the authority of ſome, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction of others, the dread of contempt or ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule, the deſire of applauſe, and of ſurpaſſing their equals; the wiſh of being uſeful to our country, animate all in their labour, and augment their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication and attention, from which ariſes the growth and extenſion of mind.</q>
                  </p>
               </note> In caſes of emergency,
recourſe would be had to the academy,
and a Robertſon would not ſtand in ſuch
need, as we have ſeen, of the advice of an
inferior mind. The paradoxes in poetry
of a Johnſon, would have been oppoſed
before their publication, or at leaſt, the
work muſt have iſſued into the world
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:0238000900:229"/>
without the ſanction of the academy,
which would have been a tacit cenſure.
The ſociety ſhould be provided with aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſociates
in the various claſſes of litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture;
it ſhould have it's grammarians,
it's hiſtorians, and it's metaphyſicians,
as well as it's poets, it's orators, and it's
philoſophers. In this hive of literary
bees, no indolent member ſhould remain
a member; all muſt be animation, all
muſt be labour. And that no excuſe
may be framed of neglect to the cauſe of
literature, penſions ſhould be given to
thoſe who may ſtand in want of them;
for penſions to all will not be wanted,
ſince ſome will labour for glory, though
ſome may alſo want bread.</p>
            <p>But even LITERARY PENSIONS have
been ridiculed; and it is not unneceſſary
to offer ſome reflections on them.</p>
            <p>There are two opinions relative to the
ſtate of men of genius. One party ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:0238000900:230"/>
that no protection from the great,
or a court, is neceſſary for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement
of artiſts; and the other are
perſuaded, that when honours and pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
are judiciouſly diſtributed, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cites
emulation in the young, and gives
that leiſure to thoſe on whom they are
beſtowed, ſo neceſſary to ſome, to cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate
their talents. They think with
Boileau, that
<q>Un AUGUSTE aiſement peut faire des VIRGILES.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Lord Orford, honourably known un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the name of Horace Walpole (a name
that preſents to the mind, taſte, fancy,
and learning) has ſaid in his preface to
his Anecdotes of Painting, <q rend="inline">want of
protection is the apology for want of
genius. Milton and Fontaine did not
write in the baſk of court favour. A
poet or a painter may want an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
or a villa, by wanting protection:
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:0238000900:231"/>
they can always afford to buy ink and
paper, colours and pencil. Mr. Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garth
has received no honours, but
univerſal admiration.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I reply to his Lordſhip, that it is true
the favour of a court knighted Blackmore,
and penſioned Quarles; and both were
miſerable poets; but if a court cannot
convert dull men into men of genius, it
may preſerve men of genius from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming
dull men. It might have af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
Dryden that ſtudious leiſure which
he ever wanted, and which has given us
imperfect tragedies, and incorrect poems,
in lieu of finiſhed compoſitions, and the
regular flights of a noble genius. It
might have animated a Gainſborough to
form an Engliſh ſchool in landſcape,
which it is ſaid was his favourite, but
neglected purſuit. As for the equipage
and villa of the poet or the painter, theſe
they leave to the idle connoiſſeur and
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:0238000900:232"/>
the vain actor. Nor muſt we conſent to
the inſulting obſervation that they may
always buy ink and paper, colours and
pencils. Is it ſufficient for a delicate and
ſenſitive mind to have ſuch implements
to awaken the brilliancy of imagination?
Is the picture uncommon to ſee a great
genius with his pens or his pencils on the
table, leaning over them in that ſecret
agony of ſpirit, which murders fancy,
and ſpreads a torpor on the ſoul? Had
Chatterton been protected, not with an
equipage or a villa, but with a penſion,
the youth had not periſhed; but this
unhappy poet inſtructs us, that pens and
paper are not the only requiſites to cheriſh
genius.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, ſo different are the
opinions of even men of letters on this
ſubject, the French writers (and the
greateſt of them received their penſions
without any injury to their genius) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:0238000900:233"/>
point to England as a model of
literary protection. They tell us that
Addiſon was Secretary of State; Newton
and Locke, Commiſſioners; Swift al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
Prime Miniſter; and Prior an
Ambaſſador.</p>
            <p>If it is urged that the public are the
beſt patrons, and that ſeveral popular
authors have left fervid expreſſions as
memorials of their gratitude; I reply,
that the public are more munificent pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons
than princes, provided that the
genius of an author happens to take a
popular turn. But of authors, few can
be popular; for moſt of the departments
in literature require the ſtudy of many
years, and cannot be perfected till a late
period. Such are all the exact ſciences,
and every ſpecies of erudition. The
hiſtorian and the noveliſt may gratify the
public taſte, but what is to become of
the antiquary and the mathematician?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:0238000900:234"/>
It is one certain evil, conſequent to the
want of patronage, that a writer of great
genius, when he diſcovers that he has
nothing but his talents, and that the
public attention muſt be rouſed by ſome
extravagant novelty, will conſult the
worſt diſpoſitions of the public; becauſe
theſe are the moſt univerſal; and inſtead
of compoſing a beautiful poem, he will
write a dreadful ſatire; inſtead of a hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
a libel; and inſtead of a moral
romance, ſome ſcandalous memoirs.</p>
            <p>Men of genius, penſioned by a court,
will be enabled to indulge their own
manner, though it might not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
be popular. He who writes in the
proper repoſe of mind, and with regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity
of application, will give his own
natural phyſiognomy, and not that arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial
countenance which thoſe who court
the mob are obliged to aſſume.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="tcp:0238000900:235"/>
If I am told, that to accept penſions is
not congenial to the free ſpirit of a Briton,
I reply, that literary penſions, unlike
others, are honourable to the donor, and
the penſioner. There is ſurely leſs ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility
in receiving a gratuitous gift from
an enlightened monarch, than the wages
of an inhuman bookſeller.</p>
            <p>There is, I think, a reward for litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
of ſtill greater utility than even
penſions.</p>
            <p>The diſtribution of PRIZES appears of
greater utility than PENSIONS. A penſion
preſerves one man of letters, but a prize
may give birth to many. He who muſt
ſatisfy a judge, and ſurpaſs a rival, will not
ſatisfy himſelf till he has ſurpaſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;
he will not try merely to give a good
work, but the beſt; and the vigilance of
ambition will ſometimes ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiencies
of genius. If he is not yet
crowned with the ſplendid reward, he
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:0238000900:236"/>
may merit the animation of an honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
notice; if he cannot obtain a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph,
an ovation may be reſerved for
him.<note n="*" place="bottom">An <hi>ovation,</hi> among the Romans, was a <hi>leſſer tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph.</hi> At an ovation, the General entered the city on foot or on horſebock; but in a triumph he rode in a chariot.</note> Uſeful topics, which might not
have been attempted by an individual,
are diſperſed about the nation. We
have ſeen lately, a prize in the Iriſh aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy
produce a valuable "Eſſay on the
beſt means of providing for the Poor."
Subjects of national importance are not
attempted becauſe a vender of literature
may not chuſe to undertake them; a
prize would beſtow honour and aſſiſtance
on the ingenious ſpeculator. It is by
her prizes, as well as by her academies,
that France has always preceded us, and
that her ingenuity is made to ſurpaſs our
genius.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>When the imperfect ſailing of our marine was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed, January 6, in this year, Admiral Gardner al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the following reaſon for the ſuperiority of the French in this particular. He ſaid, <q rend="inline">to his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the French ſhips ſailed better than the Engliſh, owing to their different conſtruction. Whenever a ſhip was to be built in France, PREMIUMS were offered for the beſt plan; the ſeveral plans were then referred to an ACADEMY of Sciences, and the moſt perfect always adopted. He entertained no doubt, but if PREMIUMS were held out here, for good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, our ſhips would be much better.</q>—Here we obſerve, that an <hi>Admiral,</hi> on the ſubject of <hi>Marine,</hi> acknowledges the utility of PRIZES and ACADEMIES; and we preſume, that not one enlightened artiſt but would employ the ſame language reſpecting his own art. By witholding theſe encouragements, many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious artiſts have periſhed with grief, and many have renounced their country, and enriched foreigners with thoſe improvements their ungrateful nation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied even their notice.</p>

While this academy for polite litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
would be thus effecting a great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
utility, their own memoirs would
be invaluable. The Academy of the
Belles Lettres in France, has formed a
collection of hiſtorical, critical, literary,
and miſcellaneous information, unequal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
in any nation. Our moſt accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
hiſtorians cite them as their
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0238000900:238"/>
authorities. The learning of a learned
age is rendered inſtructive; and what
becomes dull and inſipid in a Salmaſius
and a Scaliger, delight with thoſe who
do not think knowledge conſiſts in the
heavy and unprofitable ſcience of dates,
unconnected facts, and titles of books;
but in reflection and in taſte. Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
is only knowledge when it is render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
acceſſible to the nation; it muſt be
ſhewn to, and handled by the multitude,
and not preſerved like an uſeleſs piece of
antiquity in the collections of the curious.</p>
            <p>France had literary ſocieties of every
kind; her provincial academies were
numerous; and I cannot but attribute her
ſuperiority in a fine and brilliant elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence;
a language of criticiſm that
analyſes and paints our ſenſations; and
their ſeductive art of compoſition to
theſe lettered confraternities. Her reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was friendly to retirement; and the
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:0238000900:239"/>
retirement of ſtudious men is rarely a
barren leiſure, and a proud indolence.
It is a juſtice we owe to letters, and to
an extinct order of men, to acknowledge
the invaluable labours of many monaſtic
ſocieties of modern times. To the Port
Royal the European youth were long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted
for the initiatory books of learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and for verſions of the ancients, not yet
neglected. To the learned Benedictines
we owe their extenſive "Literary Hiſtory
of France," which, though carried to
13 volumes in 4to. reaches only to the
12th century. Many, not leſs intereſting,
nor vaſt, might be mentioned. Labours
like theſe, can never be ſatisfactorily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
by any individual; One, may be
permitted to devote himſelf to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of the work, but many hands and
many eyes muſt collect the materials, and
muſt watch over the execution. We
have no ſuch Literary Hiſtory of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:0238000900:240"/>
and I may venture to predict we
never can, if an academy of polite lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature
is not inſtituted.</p>
            <p>There remains one obſervation to be
made on the beneficial effect of literary
ſocieties diſperſed in the kingdom.
Wherever ſuch exiſt, there will never
appear in the vicinage a youth of genius,
but the members will perceive his abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities,
and will receive him or as a parent,
or as a friend. A conſiderable number
of the illuſtrious literati of France, were
firſt induced to devote themſelves to
ſtudy by the penetration of their ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors,
or having found an aſylum in ſome
monaſtery, indulged their prevailing diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
            <p>The inſtitution of literary ſocieties is
ſo much deſired, and the want is ſo
urgent, that the diſcernment of indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals
has of late attempted to ſupply this
diſhonourable deficiency by aſſociations
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:0238000900:241"/>
in the metropolis, as well as in ſome of
our provincial towns. The Mancheſter
ſociety has merited the approbation of
the public.<note n="*" place="bottom">I have the pleaſure of announcing a volume of Miſcellanies in the preſs, by a LITERARY SOCIETY eſtabliſhed at EXETER. It is their firſt fruits.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But we cannot reaſonably expect that
a private ſociety will ever anſwer the
ideas of the public, and become of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
utility. De Foe, in his "Eſſay
on Projects, (who projected millions
for the nation, but was generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined
for his own debts) gives ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations
reſpecting the inſtitution of an
academy for polite literature, but he
chiefly regards it in the view of refining
and adjuſting the language. He ſays,
p. 229, that he was once a member of
a ſociety who attempted this noble de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign,
but it's failure he attributes to the
greatneſs of the work and the modeſty of
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:0238000900:242"/>
the gentlemen; and concludes by ſaying
that we want a Richelieu to commence
ſuch a work. I believe it was not the
modeſty of the members, nor the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
of the work, which occaſioned it's
failure; but many other reaſons, which
will always operate againſt private literary
ſocieties.</p>
            <p>A ſociety of friends find no great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty
to be pleaſed with the compoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of each other; many will be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to ſuch a ſociety, more out of
affection, than for their ability. It is
the great requiſite of an academy, that
all the members ſhould be profeſſed ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents,
whoſe SOLE OCCUPATION is litera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
and whoſe life is devoted to acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demical
functions. If PENSIONS and
PRIZES are added to the eſtabliſhment,
we have then as perfect an ACADEMY,
perhaps, as poſſibly can exiſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:0238000900:243"/>
This grand and deſirable object can
alone be obtained, as ſuch hitherto have
been obtained, by the ſanction of the
Sovereign, and the applauſe of the
People. Such an inſtitution would not
alone be a national ornament; for to
hold out rewards to genius, and to dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe
among the people the humaniſing
and peaceful purſuits of literature, has
never yet been conſidered by politicians
as a vain and an unimportant purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Such is the wonderful influence of a
love of letters in a nation, that it has
often diſguiſed the deformity of deſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm,
and rendered even a nation of
ſlaves, a poliſhed, a refined, and a happy
people.</p>
            <p>At the preſent melancholy moment,
when Europe appears hoſtile to Reaſon,
and to Humanity, let us indulge the
hope, that this inſtitution may become
the ornament of PEACE—of a Peace, that
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:0238000900:244"/>
by it's duration may reſemble the viſion
of an admirable philanthropiſt and a
poor politician, the viſion of the Abbè
de Saint Pierre,—AN UNIVERSAL PEACE.
When the principle of Government is
VIRTUE, the action of that Government
will be PEACE; Governments are, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
always in war.</p>

                  <p>In 1733, the Author compoſing his Olympiad, felt
himſelf ſuddenly moved, even to tears, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing
the ſeparation of two tender Lovers.
Surpriſed that a fictitious grief, invented too by
himſelf, could raiſe ſo true a paſſion, he reflected
how little reaſonable and ſolid a foundation the
others had, which ſo frequently agitated us in
this ſtate of our exiſtence.</p>

            <p>I TAKE this opportunity of declaring, that having
been repeatedly attacked in the moſt illiberal manner
by <hi>WILLIAM GRAHAM,</hi> reſpecting an Anecdote of
<hi>Mrs. MACAULEY'S</hi> mutilation of a Harleian MS.
that no juſt reaſon has yet been aſſigned to afford me
the pleaſure of retracting this accuſation againſt a
Lady of her eminent talents.</p>
            <p>At preſent, the myſterious note of <hi>Dr. MORTON</hi>
remains unexplained, yet if it is allowed to have
any meaning, it muſt convey a charge againſt the
Hiſtorian, and as ſuch will no doubt be received by
impartial poſterity.</p>
            <p>This, however, I concede, that I cannot <hi>prove</hi>
this circumſtance, for I was not born when it took
place. It reſts not upon the floating reports of thirty
years, but in the circumſtantial evidence of the Note
which has been inſerted in it's <hi>unmutilated</hi> ſtate, in
ſeveral literary journals. I ſay unmutilated, for
<hi>Mr. G.</hi> had the ingenuity to give it only in the ſtate
which was moſt adapted to his purpoſe.</p>
            <p>I was induced to notice this ſingular occurrence,
not by deſign, but by accident; with no other view
than that of literary inſtruction, and for no other
party than that of truth.</p>
