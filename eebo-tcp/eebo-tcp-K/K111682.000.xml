            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

All Conditions of Life are open to the Strokes of Fortune, whoſe violent and unrelenting Storms will rend alike the Hermitage, the Cottage, and the Palace. Tho' the greater part of Mankind delight in Mirth, and flee from Sorrow as from the Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of a Midnight Apparition; yet it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently overtakes them, and often pierces the very Soul of the dulleſt Peaſant, of the moſt airy Wit, of the moſt conſummate Politician. Diſhonour and Grief have many times ſoiled the Royal Purple, and ſtained the triumphant Luſtre of Imperial Enſigns. What Favourite of Nature, what Darling of Fortune can then promiſe himſelf, with Security, a long Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of Felicity? Had young <hi>Philindus</hi> well attended to ſuch Thoughts as theſe, had not his ungoverned Fancy raiſed imaginary Scenes, and dreſt them in fairy Beauties; his Diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment would not have been ſo great, nor the Tide of his Sorrows ſo conſiderable and impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.

promiſed himſelf not a little Happineſs from ſuch an agreeable Proſpect: The Comelineſs of his Perſon, the Sweetneſs of his Temper, the Bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Parts, and the Luſtre of his Fortune, conſpire to diſtinguiſh him, as a Perſon born for ſome noble End, in whoſe future Behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our one might hope diſtinctly to trace the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, the Patriot, and the Gentleman; yet, alas! this blooming Youth, enchanted with the Muſick of the <hi>Syrens,</hi> and ſeduced by Flattery and Voluptuouſneſs, loſt his Innocence, his Friends, and his Fortune: After which, he would often take a ſolitary Walk round the neighbouring Fields, and there lament, like <hi>Eve</hi> when ſhe left her Nuptial Bower, and ſurveyed, with ſtreaming Eyes, the depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Beauties of <hi>Eden.</hi> One Morning in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular he roſe very early, and being full of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, and intenſely purſuing a long Train of Thought, he wandered much farther than uſual; whilſt the Verdure of the Fields, and the Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick of the Woods, entertained his Senſes in the moſt agreeable manner. Thus roved the unfortunate <hi>Philindus,</hi> till the Heat of the Sun obliged him to ſtop at a little Grove; in the moſt retired part of which he found a pretty Arbour, and there he ſat down to reſt him. At that inſtant he was oppreſſed with a Torrent of Grief; and the unhappy Youth cry'd out in the greateſt Agony of Spirit: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Aſſiſt me, moſt merciful Redeemer, and ſend ſome ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der

            <p>He had proceeded in his Soliloquy, had not he been hindered by the Approach of a young Clergyman, who was coming to that Arbour, which he almoſt daily viſited.

               <p>Pray, Sir, before you proceed, give me leave to mention one grand Objection which is brought in behalf of Infidelity, and that is this; That we can have no Idea of God, and therefore can have no Evidence of his Exiſtence. And ſome atheiſtical Perſons argue after this manner: The Notion of a Deity, which is commonly entertain'd, is nothing but a Bundle of Incomprehenſibles, Inconceivables, and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibles; it being only a Compilement of all imaginable Attributes of Honour, Courtſhip, and Compliment, which the confounded Fear
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:0948001500:23"/>
and Aſtoniſhment of Men's Minds make them huddle up together, without any Senſe or Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical Truth. This ſeems to be intimated by a modern Writer, in theſe Words: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"The Attributes of God ſignify not true, nor falſe, nor any Opinion of our Brain, but the Reverence and Devotion of our Hearts; and therefore they are not ſufficient Premiſes to infer Truth, or convince Falſhood."</q> And the ſame Thing again is farther ſet out, with no ſmall Pretence to Wit, after this manner; They that venture to diſpute philoſophically, or reaſon of God's Nature, from theſe Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes of Honour, loſing their Underſtanding in the very firſt Attempt, fall from one Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience into another, without End, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Number; in the ſame manner as when one, ignorant of the Ceremonies of the Court, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Preſence of a greater Perſon than he is uſed to ſpeak to, and ſtumbling at his En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance, to ſave himſelf from falling, lets ſlip his Cloak; to recover his Cloak, lets fall his Hat; and with one Diſorder after another, diſcovers his Aſtoniſhment and Ruſticity.</p>

               <p>To affirm that there is no Idea of God, is all one as to affirm, that there is no Conception of the Mind anſwering to that Word or Name: And indeed the modern A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſts ſtick not to maintain, That the Word GOD has no Signification, and that there is no other Idea or Conception in Men's Minds
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:0948001500:24"/>
anſwering thereunto, beſides the mere Phantaſm of the Sound. And ſince, as the learned Dr. <hi>Cudworth</hi> obſerves, there are different Words for GOD in ſeveral Languages, and Men have the ſame Notion or Conception in their Minds an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to them all; it muſt needs be granted, that they have ſome other Idea or Conception belonging to thoſe Words, beſides the Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſms of their ſeveral Sounds. And indeed it can be nothing elſe, but either monſtrous Sot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhneſs and Stupidity of Mind, or elſe prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Impudence in theſe Atheiſts, to deny that there is any Idea of God at all in the Minds of Men, or that the Word hath any Signification. But whatever theſe Atheiſts deny in Words, it is notwithſtanding evident, that even themſelves have an Idea or Conception in their Minds, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering to the Word GOD, when they deny his Exiſtence; becauſe otherwiſe they would deny the Exiſtence of nothing. And then as to his being abſolutely perfect, and of infinite Power, the Pagan-Theiſts did acknowledge it, as might be proved from vaſt Numbers of Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in their Writings.

               <p>As to their Notion of the Equator, it is built upon a falſe Suppoſition of the Antients, That the Torrid Zone, or all between the Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks, was utterly uninhabitable, by reaſon of the Extremity of the Heat; and it is certain that there is nothing which doth more demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate a Providence, than this very thing, it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the moſt convenient Site or Diſpoſition that could be deviſed, as will appear if the Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences of other Diſpoſitions be conſidered, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially theſe three: (1.)

other in right Angles. And (3.) which is a Middle betwixt both, if they ſhould cut one another in an Angle of forty-five Degrees; for it is evident, that each of theſe Diſpoſitions would be attended with far greater Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to the terreſtrial Inhabitants, in reſpect of the Length of Days and Nights, Heat and Cold: And that theſe two Circles ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue thus to keep the ſame angular Interſection, when phyſical and mechanical Cauſes would bring them ſtill nearer together; this is a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evidence of a Providence alſo.

               <p>As to the general Opinion of Mankind, the Atheiſt would make us believe, that this Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of a God doth ſpring from an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Jealouſy in the Mind of Man, and an end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Fear of the worſt that may happen; accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that divine Saying of the Poet, which he can never ſufficiently admire:
<q>Primus in orbe DEOS fecit TIMOR. <q>FEAR firſt made GODS.</q>
                  </q>
So that it is granted on both Sides, that the Fear of a Deity doth univerſally poſſeſs the Minds of Men. <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Now the Queſtion is, (ſays the learned Archbiſhop <hi>Tillotſon</hi>) whether it be more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the Exiſtence of a God ſhould be the
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0948001500:28"/>
Cauſe of this Fear, or that this Fear ſhould be the Cauſe why Men imagine there is a God? If there be a God, who hath impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed this Image of himſelf upon the Mind of Man, there is great reaſon why all Men ſhould ſtand in awe of him; but if there be no God, it is not eaſy to conceive how Fear ſhould create an univerſal Confidence and Aſſurance in Men that there is one. For whence ſhould this Fear come? It muſt be either from without, from the Suggeſtion of others, who firſt tell us there is ſuch a Being, and then our Fear believes it; or elſe it muſt ariſe from within, from the Nature of Man, which is apt to fancy dreadful and terrible Things. If from the Suggeſtions of others, who tell us ſo, the Queſtion returns, Who told them ſo? And will never be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied till the firſt Author of this Report be found out. But if it be ſaid, that this Fear ariſeth from within, from the Nature of Man, which is apt to imagine dreadful Things; this likewiſe is liable to inexplicable Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: For, firſt, the proper Object of Fear, is ſomething that is dreadful; that is, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that threatens Men with Harm or Danger, and that in God muſt be either Power or Juſtice; and ſuch an Object as this, Fear indeed may create, but Goodneſs and Mercy are eſſential to the Notion of a God, as well as Power and Juſtice. Now
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0948001500:29"/>
how ſhould Fear put Men upon fancying a Being, that is infinitely good and merciful?"</q> Indeed, as that great Prelate, juſt now menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, obſerves, if a Man had Arguments ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to perſuade him, that there is no God, (as there is infinite Reaſon to the contrary) yet the Belief of a God is ſo neceſſary to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and Happineſs of our Lives, that a wiſe Man could not but be heartily troubled to quit ſo pleaſant an Error, and to part with a Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which is apt to yield ſuch an unſpeakable Satisfaction to the Mind of Man. Did Men but conſider the true Notion of God, he would appear to be ſo lovely a Being, and ſo full of Goodneſs, and all deſirable Perfections, that even thoſe very Perſons, who are of ſuch irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Underſtandings, as not to believe there is a God; yet could not (if they underſtood themſelves) refrain from wiſhing with all their Hearts, that there were one: For is it not really deſirable to every Man, that there ſhould be ſuch a Being in the World, as takes care of the Frame of it, that it do not run into Confuſion, and in that Diſorder ruin Mankind? That there ſhould be ſuch a Being, as takes particular care of every one of us, and loves us, and delights to do us good; as underſtands all our Wants, and is able and willing to relieve us in our grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Straits, when nothing elſe can; to preſerve us in our greateſt Dangers, to aſſiſt us againſt our worſt Enemies, and to comfort us under

I know not what ſecret Hiſtories theſe Gentlemen may have of the Golden Age; but as for us dull Believers, we can't ſee one word in all the ancient Books we meet withal, that gives us the leaſt Hint of ſuch a naked natural Religion as you ſpeak of: If we have Recourſe to the Poets, to whom we are beholden for all that is known of theſe Golden Ages, when theſe brave Men lived; they make Religion as ritual as it is now, and altogether as full of Sacrifices and Revelations: Nay, the Account we have of the Goddeſs <hi>Aſtraea,</hi> which is a principal Part of the poetical Hiſtory of the Golden Age, is, that ſhe was a <hi>Numen</hi> ſent from Heaven, to converſe with Men on Earth, to inſpire them with Juſtice and Sobriety, and to teach them Vertue and a good Life: Which Fable is but an antient Tradition of the Frequency of God's converſing with holy Men in the firſt Ages of the World.

In a very blind and obſcure Corner of the Earth, among a Crew of wild Thieves and Runa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gates, (ſuch have thoſe <hi>Arabians</hi> been always famed and known to be) this Sect had its Birth and Foſterage; among thoſe fierce and ſavage Over-runners of the World, it got its Growth and Stature: Into this Sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple (being indeed in its Conſtitution well accommodated to that Humour and Genius) it was partly inſinuated by jugling Tricks, and partly driven by ſeditious Violence; the firſt Author hereof being a Perſon, according to the Deſcription given of him in their own Legends, of no honeſt or honourable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, but having all the Marks of an Impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, rebellious and perſidious, inhuman and
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0948001500:41"/>
cruel, lewd and laſcivious, of a baſe Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of a fraudulent and turbulent Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of a vicious Life, pretending to En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm, and working of Wonders; but theſe ſuch as were in their Nature moſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd and incredible. At ſuch a Seaſon, and in ſuch a Soil, by ſuch Means, and by ſuch a Perſon, was this Religion firſt planted, and afterwards carried on by the Sword. Now that divine Wiſdom ſhould chuſe thoſe black and boiſterous Times to publiſh his Will, is as if the King ſhould purpoſely order his Proclamations to be made in a tempeſtuous Night, when no Man ſcarce dares to ſtir out, nor could well ſee what was done, or hear what was ſaid; much fitter ſurely to that Purpoſe, were a ſerene and calm Day, a Time of general Civility and Peace, like that of <hi>Auguſtus Caeſar.</hi> That the Declaration of God's Mind ſhould iſſue from the Deſarts of <hi>Arabia,</hi> (that Den of Robbers) is, as if the King ſhould cauſe his Edicts to be ſet up in the blindeſt and dirtieſt Nook of the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burbs; the Market-Croſs ſurely, or the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change, (the Place of moſt general and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Concourſe) ſuch as, in reſpect to the World, was the flouriſhing Empire of <hi>Rome,</hi> were more convenient, and wiſely choſen for that purpoſe: That paſſing over the more gentle and tractable Part of his People, a Prince ſhould ſend his Laws to a Rabble of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:0948001500:42"/>
Banditti; ſhould pick out for his Meſſenger a moſt diſſolute Varlet, attended with a Crew of deſperate Ruffians, reſolved to buffet and rifle all they met: Were an odd Way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding to communicate his Pleaſure to the better and more orderly ſort of his People, (ſuch as were the Subjects of that well-go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd Empire) by Perſons of good Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, mild Diſpoſition, and innocent Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, (ſuch as were the Apoſtles of our Lord) in a quiet and gentle manner, (ſuch as theſe only uſed) would ſurely better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a wiſe Prince. Thus even the exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior Circumſtances of <hi>Mahometiſm</hi> are ſtrong Preſumptions againſt its Divinity; but farther, if we look into the Frame and Matter of it, we ſhall find it a Maſs of abſurd Opinions, odd Stories, and uncouth Ceremonies, compounded chiefly of the Dregs of Chriſtian Hereſy, together with ſome Ingredients of <hi>Judaiſm</hi> and <hi>Paganiſm</hi> confuſedly jumbled."</q> Such Conſiderations as theſe ſeem ſufficient to demonſtrate that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion not to be of a divine Extraction.</p>

Their Gods were repreſented as cruel, indigent, and luſtful, ſubject to the meaneſt Paſſions of Human Nature; nay, ſometimes to the loweſt Inclinations of Brutes: What no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objects of Adoration muſt here be? What admirable Patterns of Sanctity and good Beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour? But Chriſtians are taught, from the holy Scriptures, to believe, that God is a Being of infinite Purity and Mercy. A ſecond great Excellency, peculiar to the Chriſtian Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is this, That it faithfully informs us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning ourſelves, concerning our Nature, our Original, our End, all our State, paſt, preſent,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:0948001500:45"/>
and final; Points about which otherwiſe by no Reaſon, no Hiſtory, no Experience, we could be well reſolved or ſatisfied. It is alſo a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Excellency of our Religion, that it preſcribes an accurate Rule of Life, moſt congruous to Reaſon, and ſuitable to our Nature; it ſets be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us a living Copy, and viſible Standard of good Practice; it frees us from a tedious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervance of numerous external Rites, and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial Formalities, and builds our Duty upon moſt ſolid Grounds, preſſes it with moſt valid Inducements, draweth it from the beſt Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and driveth it to the beſt End, and far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which no other Law or Doctrine ſo much as pretends to) provides ſufficient Help and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility to practiſe its Commandments: In a word, it alone can appeaſe and ſatisfy a Man's Conſcience, breeding therein a well-grounded Hope, and a ſolid Comfort; healing the Wounds of bitter Remorſe, and anxious Fear, and ſo appears manifeſtly to be the true and direct Way to eternal Happineſs. It is obſervable alſo, that the ſacred Oracles furniſh us with the moſt aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Deſcriptions of God's Power and Majeſty, quite different from that Tinſel Pageantry, which ſo glitters in the Machines of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Poets.

There is no Perſon of Diſtinction among us, but is willing to have his Houſe beautiful and ſtately; nay, Men of an inferior Rank will be at con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Charges to render their Apartments neat and pleaſant: And does it then become us to think that Coſt and Labour miſ-employ'd, which is ſpent in adorning the Sacred Temples? 'Tis true, the primitive Chriſtians ſometimes worſhiped God in Caves, in Fields, and the meaneſt Rooms you can imagine; and, I fear, to better Purpoſe, and with greater Ardour of Devotion, than moſt Chriſtians, now-a-days, in magnificent Churches; yet this was not of Choice, but Neceſſity: For let ſome Men think, and ſay what they pleaſe, the noble

Beauty, and ſolemn Ornaments of a Temple, ſerve to excite Reverence, and raiſe Devotion; though, at the ſame time, it muſt be confeſſed, that ſincere Worſhip, performed in the pooreſt Place, when no better can be obtained, is as grateful to our Creator, as the moſt tuneful Anthems that reſound in gilded Roofs and lofty Arches.</p>

Atheiſtical Wits very often complain of the Meanneſs of the Style of Holy Writ; let them

               <p>This Exerciſe, he thought, was exceeding refreſhing to the Spirits, and gave the Thoughts a very agreeable Turn. He was indeed very fond of Muſick, and looked upon it to be in its higheſt Uſe, when employed to celebrate the Praiſes of our Creator; not but that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he would be diverted with Compoſitions of another Nature, and ſmile at the Beauties of a Moral, Politick, or Amorous Song. He was ſo great an Admirer of Poetry, even in his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt Years, that I remember I have heard him ſay, that when he was at the Grammar-School, he wrote out all <hi>Milton</hi>'s <hi>Paradiſe Loſt</hi> very fair; ſo exceedingly was he delighted with it!

it is too Allegorical; yet the Variety of amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Images, that adorn his Writings, cannot fail of delighting a Poetical Genius.

He would take Notice, that the Country was ſo empty, that a true <hi>Engliſhman</hi> could not look into it without a great deal of juſt Pity and Concern, it being a very ungrateful Spectacle to ſee ſo many noble Houſes mouldring into Ruin, and dropping down, for want of Inhabitants. He has often wondered at ſome Gentlemen of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0948001500:65"/>
his Acquaintance, who uſed almoſt to drown thoſe laudable Qualities they were Maſters of, in Floods of Wine, and ſpent a great deal of Time in exceſſive Drinking; which Vice has very fatal Effects on the Mind of the Perſon who is devoted to it, not to ſay that it alſo waſtes his Body, and diſſipates his Fortune: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"For (as a polite Gentleman very well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves)<note n="*" place="bottom">See, a <hi>Spectator</hi> of Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi>'s.</note> as to the Mind, Drunkenneſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covers every Flaw in it: The ſober Man, by the Strength of Reaſon, may keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſubdue every Vice or Folly, to which he is moſt inclined; but Wine makes every latent Seed ſprout up in the Soul, and ſhew itſelf: It gives Fury to the Paſſions, and Force to thoſe Objects which are apt to produce them. When a young Fellow com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to an old Philoſopher, that his Wife was not handſome; <q rend="inline">"<hi>Put leſs Water in your Wine,</hi> ſays the Philoſopher, <hi>and you will quickly make her ſo.</hi>
                     </q> Wine heightens Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference into Love, Love into Jealouſy, and Jealouſy into Madneſs; it often turns the good-natured Man into an Ideot, and the Cholerick into an Aſſaſſin; it gives Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Reſentment; it makes Vanity inſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable, and diſplays every little Spot of the Soul in its utmoſt Deformity. Nor does
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0948001500:66"/>
this Vice only betray the hidden Faults of a Man, and ſhew them in the moſt odious Colours, but often occaſions Faults, to which he is not naturally ſubject. There is more of Turn than of Truth in a Saying of <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neca,</hi> That Drunkenneſs does not produce, but diſcover Faults; common Experience teaches us the contrary. Wine throws a Man out of himſelf, and infuſes Qualities into the Mind, which ſhe is a Stranger to in her ſober Moments. The Perſon you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with after the third Bottle, is not the ſame Man who at firſt ſat down at Table with you. Upon this Maxim is founded a pretty Saying of <hi>Publius Syrus</hi>; <q rend="inline">
                        <hi>Qui ebrium ludificat, laedit abſentem:</hi>
                     </q> He who jeſts upon a Man who is drunk, injures the Abſent. Thus does Drunkenneſs act in direct Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction to Reaſon, whoſe Buſineſs it is to clear the Mind of every Vice which is crept into it, and to guard it againſt all the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches of any that Endeavours to make its Entrance. But beſides theſe ill Effects which this Vice produces in the Perſon who is actually under its Dominion, it has alſo a bad Influence on the Mind, even in its ſober Moments; as it inſenſibly weakens the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, impairs the Memory, and makes thoſe Faults habitual, which are produced by frequent Exceſſes."</q> 
                  <hi>Serino</hi> was well aware of this, and therefore ſtrictly guarded
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0948001500:67"/>
againſt all Exceſſes of this kind. Another pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing Vice of the Age, which he kept at a Diſtance from, and was extreamly uneaſy when in any Company where it was practiſed, was the modiſh Rant of Oaths and Imprecations, it being an ungenteel Dialect, as well as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian, and claſhes both with the Rules of Breeding, and the Goſpel. The Folly of them is thus admirably deſcribed by a conſiderable Maſter of Learning and Language: <q rend="inline margQuotes">"Cuſtom, indeed (<hi>ſays he</hi>) has made them faſhionable, but neither civil nor lawful; for Vice can never plead Preſcription: I know it lies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Protection of Numbers and Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but ill Things have no Right to San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary. Becauſe Vermin ſwarm, muſt they be permitted to Increaſe? Shall the Number of Felons plead for Pardon? No, no; the Cuſtomarineſs of ill Things makes them worſe, and the more they muſt be diſcoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced, and taught Diſcipline. In a word, whatever jars with Religion, and cuts upon good Breeding, is below a Gentleman; and therefore, in ſpight of Example and Practice, I muſt caution young Gentlemen againſt ſome Parts of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Civility; for though they go for Conſent in the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they will not bear the Teſt of other Nations. For Example: <hi>Damn ye,</hi> ſays one, <hi>I am glad to ſee you.</hi> Is not this a quaint Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutation, firſt to pack me away to Hell, and
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:0948001500:68"/>
then proteſt he is glad to ſee me ſo conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently lodged? What Proviſion will theſe Blades make for their Enemies, if they place their Friends ſo untowardly? Certainly they fancy Hell is a fine Seat, and that the Damned are in a fair Way of Promotion. <hi>Damn ye, ye Dog, how doſt do?</hi> Cries another: This feat Compliment implies Damnation and Transformation too; it's a Compound of Curſe and Raillery, I am plunged into Hell, daſhed out of the Liſt of Rationals, and then with a Taunt asked how I do. Why, a Man in Fire and Brimſtone is not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at his Eaſe; and a reaſonable Creature, curſt into a Dog, not very fond of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis. A third very ungenteelly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſts a Friend, he has not, perhaps, ſeen of a Twelve-month; <hi>Ye Son of a Whore, where have you been?</hi> This is an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Addreſs to a tittle; it is a kind of Staple Commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Nation, and, like our Wooll, muſt not be tranſported, under Pain of Confiſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But ſurely we need not lay ſo ſevere an Embargo on the Ware, for 'tis ten to one 'twill never find vent in any other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this Side of the <hi>Canaries</hi>; a handful of Dirt, well applied, is as civil a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, though not quite ſo cleanly. <hi>Son of a Whore!</hi> There is Abundance of Freedom in the Expreſſion, but not a Grain of Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; unleſs you meaſure Behaviour by the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0948001500:69"/>
Dialect of <hi>Billingsgate</hi> and the <hi>Bear-Garden.</hi> Certainly theſe Gentlemen are Admirers of Charity, why elſe do they dignify Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom? For Whore ſtands for a Mark of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, a diſtinguiſhing Character; otherwiſe the Salutation would appear coarſe and home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But, by their leave, few are in Love with Croſs-bars, and to be Brother to a Bye-blow, is to be a Baſtard once removed. I know we fling a Veil on theſe Expreſſions, and waſh over their Foulneſs with fair Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. <hi>Damn ye</hi> (ſays one) and <hi>Son of a Whore</hi> ſtand merely for Cyphers, or only ſerve to enliven a Period, and to make the Expreſſion more bluſtering: I confeſs Whore and Damnation are near a-kin, and often go together; but for all that, the Sillineſs of the Excuſe, can't ſtifle the monſtrous Inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility of the Compliment; for though it ſignifies nothing to him who receives it, in good time it will ſignify much to him who ſpoke it; for though a Friend may let ſuch Curſes fall to the Ground, God will put them to Account; and though they ſtand for Cyphers in <hi>England,</hi> they may purchaſe Eternal Torments in Hell. They are, ſays another, Marks of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Familiarity; pure Sallies of Kindneſs, and Demonſtrations of Friendſhip. No doubt, to deliver over to <hi>Satan</hi> an old Acquaintance, without asking his Conſent to the Conveyance, is Freedom
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0948001500:70"/>
with a Vengeance; but at which End of the Compliment is his Kindneſs? In ſhort, ſuch Expreſſions grate the Organ, and turn the very Faculty of Hearing into a Burthen; they are high Symptoms of a lewd Inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of a depraved Complexion; for when the Breath ſmells rank, the Stomach is infected: In ſhort, ſuch a Jargon is a Breach of Civility, it is a ruſtick Cant, an uncredirable Dialect; nor is the whole Poſſe of Bullies able to enoble it".</q> Perſons of great Fortunes, are tempted to Pride and Haughtineſs; therefore <hi>Serino</hi> laboured by all Means to obtain that excellent Virtue of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: And was ſo happy as not to miſs of his Deſign, nor loſe his Labour; for, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, no Man, in his Circumſtances, was ever of a more meek and humble Spirit. There is an admirable Sentence in Holy Writ, which ſays, that <hi>Pride was not made for Man:</hi> There is not, indeed, any ſingle View of Human Nature, under its preſent Condition, which is not ſufficient to extinguiſh in us all the ſecret Seeds of Pride; and on the contrary, to ſink the Soul into the loweſt State of Humility, and what the School-men call Self-Annihilation: There is nothing in his Underſtanding, his Will, or in his preſent Condition, that can tempt any conſiderate Creature to Pride or Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; and yet the very Reaſons why he ſhould not be proud, are, notwithſtanding, the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0948001500:71"/>
why he is ſo. Were he not a ſinful Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, he would not be ſubject to a Paſſion which riſes from the Depravity of his Nature; were he not an ignorant Creature, he would ſee he has nothing to be proud of: And were not the whole Species miſerable, he would not have thoſe wretched Objects of Compariſon before his Eyes, which are the Occaſions of this Paſſion, and make one Man value himſelf more than another. But, methinks, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtability of Human Affairs, the Turns and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitudes of Fortune, and the ſudden Falls from the moſt ſwoln Ambition, are Subjects which ought to diſcountenance Pride. <hi>Shakeſpeare</hi> has an admirable Paſſage on this Head, (ſpoken by <hi>Wolſey</hi> in <hi>Henry</hi> VIII.) which <hi>Serino</hi> uſed of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to repeat.<q>

                  <hi>Serino</hi> did not take Notice of this with any Deſign to favour a ſceptical Humour, or a certain awkard Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of ranging one's Thoughts, which is new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called (by an evident <hi>Catechreſis</hi>) <hi>Free-Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; his Aim was only to know the diſmal Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of Diviſions in the Church of Chriſt, which as they proceed from a ſcandalous Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the plaineſt Rules of the Goſpel, ſo

might they be effectually cured, would Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians but read and conſider thoſe earneſt Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations to Meekneſs and Unity, with half that Calmneſs, in which they were delivered by the Glorious Author of our Salvation: Could they but once be perſuaded to lay aſide their furious and inordinate Paſſions, to quit their corrupt and ſiniſter Deſigns; would they but make themſelves ſo happy, as to reſolve to value a plain Direction of our Bleſſed Lord, before a thouſand quaint Gloſſes and needleſs Injunctions: Then would Joy and Peace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound, and ever-blooming Beauties adorn the Sacred Temple. The Winter being thus hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily paſt, and the Rain over and gone, the Time of Singing-Birds would ſoon commence, and every Chriſtian be refreſhed with the charming Muſick of the Turtle. But the Circumſtances of our mourning Family call for my Preſence; I can therefore only add, that when he was apprehenſive of approaching Death, inſtead of ſinking in Sorrow, he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained himſelf with recounting the many Mercies he had received through his whole Life; and called me to him, to read a Hymn, compoſed by the inimitable Mr. <hi>Addiſon</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an Indiſpoſition: And when I came to this Verſe, <q>
