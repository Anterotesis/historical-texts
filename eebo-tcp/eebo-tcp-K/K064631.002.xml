            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Century.</head>
            <p>IN the houſe of Miſs Million, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
of Emily had opportunities of
unfolding itſelf not hitherto preſented.
Rarely had ſhe quitted the ſide of a blind
parent to enter into a contracted circle;
and if this circumſtance had been detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
to her ſagacity in human nature,
it proved not unfavourable to the high
culture of her elegant accompliſhments.
In the enthuſiaſm of ſolitude fine talents
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0063300902:5"/>
are purſued with an intenſity not expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced
by thoſe whoſe active circle, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſified
by the feſtivities of diſſipation,
or the buſtle of buſineſs, can only enable
them to become lovers of art, and not
artiſts. Solitude, which ſo frequently
excites the querulouſneſs of genius, is a
ſevere mother who forms a lovely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny;
what in the great world had only
been a momentary amuſement, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes
a permanent occupation. Sweet
is the uninterrupted induſtry of genius,
magical it's contracted day, and delicious
that inebriation of taſte which becomes
an abſorbing paſſion. In ſolitude alone
can now be acquired that difficult faci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity,
which, though it performs its mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles
of art inſtantaneouſly, has been the
ſlow and painful acquiſition of great prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
and greater meditation. Emily roſe
with the fun; her prayer was a ſilent ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
of aweful pleaſure; her crayon was in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0063300902:6"/>
her hand during her morning walks, and if
ſhe brought home ſome romantic figure,
ſome tenderer tint, from the aſpect of
nature, it was a new enjoyment. The
clock told the hour of midnight, when,
with regret, ſhe relinquiſhed her volume,
and diſſolved the enchantment of her
fancy. Often, as ſhe ſat by her father,
her buſy ſpirits were ſo diffuſed in her
little employments, that Balſour could
only hear her gentleſt ſuſpirations; and
would ſay afterwards, I could almoſt <hi>ſee</hi>
you Emily very buſy.</p>
            <p>Emily, when ſhe now compared her
talents with thoſe of the favourites of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhion,
including ſome profeſſional artiſts,
felt a new confidence in her powers: but
ſhe was ſilent, as well as modeſt; for ſhe
found that ſhe was inferior to all, if that
inferiority is to be allowed becauſe ſhe
was inexpert in the dull and formal rou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine
of life. A perſon of true genius is
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0063300902:7"/>
ſoon placed beneath the level of equality
among the frivolous, becauſe talents give
no real ſuperiority among ſuch aſſociates;
they are applauded rapidly from an old
cuſtom; but having been applauded with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
feeling, are as rapidly forgotten. The
permanent intereſts of ſuch a ſociety, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
in every thing that is the reverſe of
genius; ſo that a certain mark of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ocrity
of talent, is the pleaſure which
ſuch a circle affords. To Emily their
converſation was a language, of which the
rudiments were unknown; their amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
paſſed away, too numerous and
too rapid to leave any delight; and their
moſt important concerns ſeemed the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque
of human life, while what occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned
the moſt voluble lamentations, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
her interior ſmile. Her beauty was
likely to occaſion ſome trouble from the
men; but her extreme docility, and unpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming
manners, rendered her at firſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portable
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0063300902:8"/>
to the women. She conciliated
their favour by her willingneſs to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
as an inoffenſive cypher, which of
itſelf was of no value, unleſs placed by
thoſe who made a figure in the preſent
circle.</p>
            <p>It is but performing an act of juſtice
to Miſs Million to declare, that ſhe was
infinitely delighted by the varied powers
of her new companion; ſhe told all the
world ſo; and evinced as much pleaſure
in exhibiting the performances of Emily,
as if they had been her own. Emily could
not but feel a warm gratitude for ſuch
inceſſant partiality; but it often coſt her
the pang of a deep bluſh, and the diſguſt
of an amplification, of which herſelf was
at once the divinity worſhipped and the
victim immolated. There was ſuch a
roughneſs in the gentleneſs of Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion;
of her incenſe ſhe was prodigal;
but in her zeal, ſhe ever threw cenſer
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0063300902:9"/>
and incenſe together in the face of her di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.
In vain Emily entreated the favour
of being placed in the ſhade, Miſs Million
felt too much not to exhale her admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
in panegyrics. This amiable lady,
it muſt be acknowledged, loſt nothing by
this exceſs of kindneſs; the higher the
praiſe ſhe beſtowed on Emily, the ſtronger
it's dazzling reflection fell on her own
cheriſhed perſon. Was it not evident,
that the more ſhe talked of "the old
blind lieutenant's daughter," her be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence
was amply diſplayed? The
more ſhe was enraptured by the brilliant
finger of Emily on her harp, it was clear
the nerves of her intendered ſoul caught
the melodious vibrations; and no one
could ſay, when ſhe overflowed in rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
concerning light and ſhade, as ſhe
pointed to her paintings, but that Miſs
Million muſt have a very ſenſible taſte
for the magic of her canvas. Emily,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:0063300902:10"/>
however, received the approbation and
eſteem of Lady Belfield, whoſe favour
ſhe felt an ambition to enjoy; for Lady
Belfield was herſelf a woman of talents,
and might have been a woman of genius,
and therefore knew the real value of her
varied and felicitous accompliſhments.</p>
            <p>Miſs Million's circle was by no means
confined; ſhe was proud of the acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
of every perſon of faſhion; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides
her paſſion for maſquerades and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany,
ſhe was a diſtinguiſhed patroneſs of
literary merit; her name was enrolled
among the earlieſt ſubſcriptions; ſhe had
received the honour of a dedication of a
novel, which was decorated not only by
her name, but by the ſplendour of her
engraved arms; and beſides theſe literary
diſtinctions, it was rumoured, that ſhe
herſelf had written one ſonnet, yet pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
in the virgin modeſty of a manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript.
She was indeed declared to be
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0063300902:11"/>
a prodigy of genius by ſeveral of her
friends, but particularly by three or four
great critics (one of whom it was univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally
whiſpered wrote in one Review, if
not in all of them) and who did her the
honour of dining with her regularly three
days in the week.</p>
            <p>An important perſon in the houſe of
Million, was Mrs. Bully the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper.
She was a coloſſus of vulgarity,
a daemon of religion, and a dragon of
virtue. On one occaſion "her ſtars" had
doomed her to make a ſlight ſlip; but
religion had now ſo completely varniſhed
over this ancient piece of Engliſh china,
that it was a ſecret flaw, rather than a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible
crack. Nature had been kind to
her fellow-creatures, in exhibiting her
character in her appearance, but its glar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
groſſneſs was frequently ſubdued by
her ingenuity. Philoſophy exults in
teaching men to conceal or ameliorate
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0063300902:12"/>
their defects, and ſhrewd vulgarity is not
inferior to philoſophy. The tones of a
voice, groſs as the furred porch from which
they iſſued, ſhe could render not diſpleaſing
to ſome by adulation; arms, that might
have wielded the ſpear of Goliah, were
rendered not repulſive by officiousneſs;
and the heavy circumference of her body,
could on occaſion roll with celerity to
the ſervice of her patrons. She was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
a manſion-houſe of mortality; and
to look on her was to admire the ſolidity
of thoſe materials, which Nature can form
when ſhe ſimply works with mere fleſh
and blood. Nature, indeed, had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
no error in the formation of Mrs.
Bully; every <hi>part</hi> was uniformly groſs;
but Nature's blunder conſiſted in the
<hi>whole.</hi> A being ſo nervous and athletic,
ſhould never have been a woman.</p>
            <p>Nor was her mind of an inferior ſize to
her body. Since her ſlippery adventure,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0063300902:13"/>
above hinted, ſhe had held a moſt pious
abſtinence from human fleſh; her conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional
ideas, however, occaſionally flamed
in her expreſſions, but were ſmothered in
her actions; of the latter ſhe was faſtidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
nice, ſo as to be enabled to diſcover,
in thoſe of other people, a hundred little
peccancies againſt chaſtity, which eſcaped
their conſciouſneſs; for it is obſervable,
that perſons who are themſelves not of
the cleaneſt part of the human ſpecies,
are wonderfully alert in diſcerning the
ſlighteſt atoms of dirt on a very clean
perſon. Her mind was as active as it was
robuſt; and her ſtrong paſſions, not hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
any more an opportunity of venting
themſelves in the mollifications of love,
made moſt terrible exploſions in obſolete
theology and politics. She read few
books publiſhed within this century. The
period of her reſearches was thoſe days of
fanatical controverſy, which ſo long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graced
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:0063300902:14"/>
unenlightened England, when,
neither ſtationary in her religion or her
politics, every feveriſh reformer promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated
a ſyſtem of his own. The national
genius, therefore, had no ſyſtem at all,
and branched out into reciprocal perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions.
What then was occaſioned by
the energy of religion and politics, may,
perhaps, be renewed in this age, on an
inverſe ratio, becauſe we have no religion
and no politics.</p>
            <p>Mrs. Bully had, therefore, high-church
arbitrary notions, and jacobite <hi>jure divino</hi>
principles. Some of her favourite au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
were Prynne, and Sir Roger L'Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trange.
Filmer, on the divine right of
kings, gave her political creed; ſhe ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died
the orthodoxy of that holy buffoon,
South; and was recreated by the merry
jeſts of Timothy and Philalethes. The
wickedneſs of the age ſhe derived from
Socinianiſm; it's ſpirit of ſedition from
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:0063300902:15"/>
the uſurpation of the Calviniſtic William;
and every loſs of the Engliſh, and their
allies, ſhe attributed to a judgment of
heaven, for that cool and tolerant ſpirit
of religion, which, much to her ſorrow,
ſhe now ſaw prevailing in the kitchen
as well as in the drawing-room.</p>
            <p>When Emily made her appearance in
this family, ſhe gave riſe to numerous
ſpeculations among the domeſtics. As
they could not poſſibly conceive how
Miſs Million could want a companion,
who lived in one continued ſeries of
company, ſome ſuppoſed, that the life of
Emily was as precious to Mr. Million
as that of his over-gorged Bob. Mrs.
Betty, the confidential maid of Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
being the mere looking-glaſs of her
miſtreſs, reflected her panegyrics. But
Mrs. Bully, their preſident in high coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil,
obſerving that Emily went rarely to
church, poſed Mrs. Betty, and alarmed
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0063300902:16"/>
ſome in the council, by enquiring which
was her religion? This queſtion, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
is one of the moſt difficult enquiries
that can be made in the preſent day.
Mrs. Bully had formed dreadful ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions
of Emily's orthodoxy, becauſe of
her irregular church attendance; and yet
to diſlike a church, does not indicate any
irreverence for religion; for ſince the
church is perſonated by the parſon, we
conceive it is no impiety to forſake any
houſe of God, when we find that the
faſhionable clerical ſeems more inclined
to pay his reſpects to his pariſhioners
than his reverence to his God.</p>
            <p>She one day bounced into her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
and ſeating herſelf, began her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitorial
examination. She opened by
an high eulogium of reading, which ſhe
compared to cookery. "I love (ſaid ſhe)
the old firloin, and plain round of beef,
where 'tis cut and come again; none of

your flimflams and French diſhes. Your
modern books are like enough proper for
their authors' wits, being very ſmall and
thin. I like your books big as Bibles; ay,
and the Bible is the beſt book. Novels are
the reading of your fine ladies; but if we
like love-ſtories, there's a mort of um in
the Bible."</p>
            <p>"I think, Mrs. Bully, (replied Emily)
moſt of them had better have been
omitted."</p>
            <p>"The Lord preſerve your ſoul! not

there is God's word. Read St. Auſtin's
City of God; and the church has de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.

            <p>"I am no diſſenter, Mrs. Bully; but

"What is your eternal ſalvation to be
obtained by others, as the curſed papiſts
ſay? Mayharp, Miſs, you don't believe
in the Athanaſian creed?"</p>
            <p>"I do not underſtand it."</p>
            <p>"That's an old vile excuſe for not
believing. Now a ſyllable can be done
away. Does'n't it tell you, that you
muſt be damned if you don't believe in
it? Take my word for it, that Saint
Athanaſius knew more about his own
creed than that fiend Arius. And what
think you of Conſtantine the Great?"—</p>
            <p>"Some ſay he was a felon."</p>
            <p>"I tell you, Miſs, he was a ſaint,

"Oh! that I had lived in thoſe bliſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful

of a whole city conſiſted in diſputes
about the Conſubſtantiality; when, in
quitting the ſhop of a trader, one not

but alſo the man to change his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion;
when the dear boys in the ſtreet
would fight one another for Arius and
Athanaſius! To be ſure Arius had the
beſt of it while he lived; and Conſtantine
wrote to them, that they were both fools
for diſputing about what no one could
underſtand: but didn't Arius die, like the
Empreſs of Ruſſia? Foul heretics ſhould

Have you got, Miſs, all Sir Roger's

not ſkimming like a mealy butterfly."</p>
            <p>"Really, Mrs. Bully, all your authors
are not even known to me by name.
I have only two books, I think printed
by one of Cromwell's party, and thoſe
are the Paradiſes of Milton."</p>
            <p>"Abominable! I marvel, Miſs, how
you can bear a page of ſuch "a blind

His eyes ſhewed a judgment of heaven.
No wonder he drew the devil ſo well,

Oliver. He'll protect him finely in the

you like South for his joking ſermons;
and the elegant Stanhope on the epiſtles,
who obſerves, that an unbeliever, if he
were in heaven, would find no more

and Scott, and Archbiſhop Laud,
and Biſhop Blackhall, whoſe works are in
three folios, heavier than I can hold in

            <p>"My favourite ſermons are thoſe of
Blair."</p>
            <p>"Abominable! why they contain no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing

the conſubſtantiality, grace, and juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
little aſthmatic periods, as if he

words. You have a great deal to learn,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:0063300902:22"/>
Miſs, on the ſcore of religion and politics.
You think I don't read novels; but I
like much thoſe in folio. I am now read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the great Caſſandra, and the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
Oroondates. That Oroondates was a
brave fellow; he killed above fifty he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes,
almoſt as brave as himſelf; and his
ſpeeches are ten honeſt pages in length;
none of your ſqueaking heroes, who are
afraid to ſpeak out like men; but I
know the reaſon, for their authors have
nothing for them to ſay."</p>
            <p>"I could never read (ſaid Emily) thoſe
voluminous romances. Their heroes and
heroines are a diſtinct order of beings
from ourſelves; and I have my ſuſpicions,
whether they ever exiſted but in the
prurient fancies of their authors. Their
deſcriptions are never local, one place is
depicted like another; their ſtyle is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufferably
languid; their incidents, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
being romantic, violate the known
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:0063300902:23"/>
cuſtoms of every age; and their authors
ſeem to have merely deſpoiled Homer of
his true heroes, to transform them into
the diſguſting petit-maitres of Paris. A
race that, when they exiſted, were only
ridiculed, and that now are quite obſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete.
Such are their protracted conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
that we cannot but quite forget
what we had read, ſhould we ever arrive
at the cloſe of the twelfth volume."</p>
            <p>"Abominable! I forget nothing.
Since, Miſs, you don't like bulky books,
mayhap you have never read the Bible
through?"</p>
            <p>"Many parts I have never finiſhed.
I would neither corrupt my imagination
with impurity, nor ſteel my heart by bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous
narratives and ſanguinary perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions."</p>
            <p>"Then the Lord preſerve you from
damnation! Samuel hewed Agag alive,
and he did well; he was an Arian of his

William the III. was our king. Why

Diſſentions of two great Critics, ſhewing
the Utility of Chriſtian Names.</head>
            <p>LADY Belfield contracted with
Emily a more paſſionate degree of
friendſhip than a lady of her high rank,
in general, is capable of experiencing;
but her Ladyſhip is one of thoſe not very
rare inſtances, we imagine, where we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
an amiable and ingenious female
ſtudiouſly annihilating her virtues and
her talents in the giddy, and often cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal,
vortex of diſſipation. Nature will
ſometimes prevail over Faſhion.</p>
            <p>One morning, when theſe two la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies
were converſing with Miſs Million,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:0063300902:27"/>
Charles and Vaurien were announced.
When they entered, their eyes were at
once directed on Emily; ſhe recogniſed
Vaurien, and deeply bluſhed; her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion
was fortunately concealed, while
Miſs Million introduced theſe gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.
Lady Belfield ſaid, "Dear Miſs
Emily, allow me to ſpeak a word for
one of theſe men; for that great child is
as ſilent as a Turkiſh mute, (looking on
Charles); and half a word for the other,
who, I am ſenſible, wants no aid of mine
to engage the attentions of an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
girl." Vaurien made a very ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant
compliment, and Charles a very
ſilent bow. Neither of the two ladies
ſuſpected that they had ever met before;
and they themſelves did not chuſe to
notice their former rencounter at Mrs.
Wilſon's; for which, no doubt, each had
ſome peculiar reaſon, and which to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover
may ſerve, if the reader thinks
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:0063300902:28"/>
proper, to exerciſe his thinking powers,
as well as his eyes, although the latter
are generally conſidered as the only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites
for novel reading.</p>
            <p>Vaurien was the ſoul of the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He flew from topic to topic, and
poured out to Miſs Million all the little
news that he had collected in the courſe
of that morning's perambulation. He
hinted at a marriage, narrated a duel,
diſcovered an intrigue, and informed
them, that laſt night Lady Bab loſt ten
thouſand pounds at one ſitting, and was
obliged to retire for the unexpected de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livery
of a ſon and heir. He was a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume
of ſecret memoirs; and every trifle
was embelliſhed by the graces of his
manner. To Emily he directed a richer
vein of converſation: he liſtened to the
copious catalogue of her talents, as given
by Miſs Million; and when one of her
paintings was pointed out to his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:0063300902:29"/>
he gazed on it for ſome time,
commended it in a few energetic ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions,
and, at the ſame time, exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited
his accuracy of taſte by ſome ſlight
corrections, and his pictureſque fancy,
by deſcribing how, from that ſubject,
another might be formed more romantic
to the imagination. Emily was more
gratified by this diſcriminating criticiſm
than the general applauſe of others, and
formed a high conception of that opu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence
of fancy, which ſeemed always to
enrich what it found. Lady Belfield in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated
her to touch her harp; ſhe played
with her accuſtomed eaſe; and while ſhe
was receiving the thanks of her fair
friends, Vaurien ſwept his hand careleſly
over the inſtrument, and called forth the
tendereſt air. Solicited to proceed, he
ſaid: "Ah, no! I venture not above
a prelude, after harmonies like thoſe
which have now charmed. All my ſkill
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:0063300902:30"/>
is only an effuſion of the heart, and all
my airs are only a few aſſociations of the
memory, when I wandered in the viny
vales of Languedoc." Emily, it muſt be
confeſſed, was delighted by the ſingular
verſatility of his powers. Lady Belfield
rallied Vaurien upon this diſcovery of his
harp muſic: "What a dangerous man
are you, Vaurien, when you can conceal
even little accompliſhments, that they
may be reſerved to ſurpriſe and delight
on the moſt impreſſive occaſion. It is to
Miſs Emily we owe your performance on
the harp. But you, Charles, neither ſay,
nor do any thing."</p>
            <p>"Your Ladyſhip knows (replied
Charles) that ſome are born to embel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
life by all that it has of the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
while others muſt reſtrict themſelves
to admire and love that merit they dare
not rival."</p>
            <p>Emily liked Charles for this liberal
commendation of a perſon who was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:0063300902:31"/>
his rival; that is a merit (ſhe
thought) ſuperior to the merit itſelf.</p>
            <p>Vaurien had now come down to the
very laſt morning anecdote; and he knew
that there was a certain point in conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,
when an able and ſagacious talker
takes his departure. It is that point, at
which what we have ſaid leaves a lively
impreſſion on our friends; a quarter of
an hour more would weary, or leſs would
not ſatisfy. It exacts no ordinary judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
to know when to quit a chair.
The exhauſted Frenchman was now riſing,
when the two great critics, Mr. Acrid
and Mr. Antique, were announced. With
indecent haſte Antique ruſhed in, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.
"I have," cried he "got near a whole
page traced accurately on oiled paper.
I tell you, Mr. Acrid, 'tis an original.
We have had a ſecret committee; but
no one can read it except Ireland; he is
inſpired; he reads it juſt as if it were his
own writing!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:0063300902:32"/>
"And have you a page of Shakſpeare
never read before?" ſaid Miſs Million.</p>
            <p>Antique. "I heard Dr. Parr ſay, that
he muſt expreſs his <hi>conviction</hi> in periods
more <hi>dignified</hi> than Ireland could roll. I
ſaw Boſwell fall on his knees, raiſe his
hands, and thank God!"</p>
            <p>"Mere antiquaries are ever to be
duped," replied Mr. Acrid with a dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatorial
tone. "Without taſte to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern,
penetration to decide, or that illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minating
ſagacity that combines it's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring
calculations; with a brainleſs head
and ſightleſs eyes, you pore on inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
ſepulchral monuments, and manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcripts
that would never have been ſuch,
had they merited literary honours. You
only read the dullneſs of other times, and
call this erudition; the groſs jeſts of our
groſs forefathers, and you conceive you
are men of wit. You diſcover ſome
clumſy utenſil, and you engrave it as a
model for modern elegance. The dulleſt
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:0063300902:33"/>
writer of a dull age, becomes to the mere
antiquary the moſt precious of his own
times; and yet ſuch bear no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance
to Midas than by his exterior
ſign, their touch cannot turn lead into
gold. You have already ſtifled poor
Shakſpeare by your commentaries, the
text cannot breathe freely amidſt your
incumbrances. Here is a man who
writes with an orthography of his own
invention, and in a ſtyle that has no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention
at all; and every fool of learning
is ſummoned to admire a modern ſkeleton
in an ancient leaden coffin. But did not
my friend George take the true dimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
of the intellects of the director of
your worſhipful ſociety? A curved cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of an old chimney-piece, duly ſteeped
in what ſhall be nameleſs, till it became
variegated with the dark rainbow hues
of antiquity, and, taſted by his ſagacious
finger, ſmelt of other times, was engraved
with ſome Saxon characters, and the name
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:0063300902:34"/>
of Hardycknute; at length, being pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
vinegared and verdigreaſed, it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
his antiquarian curioſity; he doats
on it to madneſs, makes ſyllables of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
and words of ſyllables, and enriches
the archives of your ſociety with a moſt
learned diſſertation on the drinking-horn

Shakſpeare on this curved corner of an
old chimney-piece."</p>
            <p>The laugh went againſt Mr. Antique,
who ſat down much cooler than he came
in, muttering vengeance. A circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
occurred to theſe two great cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics,

               </gap>ing torrent,
or quick and fiery as kindled ſtraw. Mr.
Antique was a virtuoſo and a collector,
more famous for his library than his
learning; wealthy in medals, profound in
title-pages, an ogler of ſtatues, and a
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:0063300902:35"/>
great admirer of the works of nature
when they appeared in the forms of but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terflies,
pebbles, and conchae veneris; he
therefore was tolerably read in authors
who had written on <hi>curious</hi> ſubjects; but
Mr. Acrid held ſuch authors in ſovereign
contempt, and vociferated his raptures
for writers of taſte. In point of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,
or intellectual power, he was
much on an equality with his brother
critic, whom he ſo much contemned.
Not but that his criticiſms were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
juſt, which they could not fail
to be, as they were, with little variation,
the ſentiments of the nobleſt critics; and
yet we are informed, that his entire li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary
conſiſted of only two biographical
dictionaries, ſo that he travelled on the
high roads of literature merely at the
public expence; and when it happened
that he was ſtopped at a turnpike-gate,
he only diſcovered his extreme poverty.
The following dialogue now enſued:—</p>
            <pb n="33" facs="tcp:0063300902:36"/>
            <p>Antique. "You will find a very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
detail of that picture in Richard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon."</p>
            <p>Acrid. "Richardſon detail a picture!
Not he. He was no petty virtuoſo."</p>
            <p>Antique. "Mr. Richardſon no vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuoſo!
Give me leave to affirm, that he
is at the head of our virtuoſos. He was
both a curious collector and a very mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute
deſcriber."</p>
            <p>Acrid. "Richardſon a puny col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector!
Sir, it is falſe, very falſe. That
he was a minute deſcriber I agree."</p>
            <p>Antique. "I repeat he was a curious
collector. I retort your charge. I know
he prolonged his tour, and remained
above a year at Rome. It took him
three months only to deſcribe one of
Pouſſin's pictures."</p>
            <p>Acrid. "He never was out of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.
His imagination was a true Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh
ſea-coal fire, and borrowed not a
ſpark from a foreign rival."</p>
            <pb n="34" facs="tcp:0063300902:37"/>
            <p>Antique. "Not out of England! I
ſhall grow mad! 'Tis a calumny which
only an inſidious enemy could propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.
His very minute deſcriptions teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify
his ocular examination. His works
give us the very attitudes."</p>
            <p>Acrid. "So, Sir, you think that a
man muſt travel out of England to catch
thoſe correct reſemblances which true
taſte admires. Truly your taſte is ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular;
but his works are immortal."</p>
            <p>Antique. "Immortal! Why no man of
any taſte would give them houſe-room."</p>
            <p>Acrid. "Not Richardſon's works
houſe-room! (he lifted his hands higher
than his head)</p>
            <p>"O! for ſhame, Mr. Antique," ſaid
Miſs Million. "No one can agree with
you there."</p>
            <p>Antique. "Why they are all daubs;
mere garret furniture."</p>
            <p>Acrid. "I loſe my patience—I am
nearly ſuffocated with rage. Do you
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:0063300902:38"/>
mean, Mr. Antique, to inſult me by
inſulting Richardſon?"</p>
            <p>Antique. "Mr. Acrid, do you mean
to reflect on my connoiſſeurſhip, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing
that I could approve of his wretched
works? Where are they now to be found?
All gone and forgotten!"</p>
            <p>Here Mr. Acrid roſe in great paſſion,
looked with a diſtortion of countenance
on Mr. Antique, a mixture of fierceneſs
and contempt; then ſmoothing his face
into a ſardonic ſmile, that is, with a
gay countenance and an aching heart, he
turned to the ladies, and appealed to
them, if Richardſon's works were not in
every body's hands, and in every col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection
of taſte?</p>
            <p>Antique. "In every body's hands, and
in every collection of taſte! Was ever man
ſo provoked and inſulted as I am?"</p>
            <p>Acrid. "His fable is protracted, but
his lively and delicate ſtrokes place every
object before the eye."</p>
            <pb n="36" facs="tcp:0063300902:39"/>
            <p>Antique. "What do you mean by
his fable? But I confeſs his minuteneſs
is admirable."</p>
            <p>Acrid. "Every character is ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent,
it is as in the great original of
nature."</p>
            <p>Antique. "Agreed, as to the great
original; but nature is quite a ſuperflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

I, who attend every picture ſale in town,
can read ſuch enormous novels? I have
enough to do to read through all the ſale

            <p>Antique. "Then, poſitively, my dear

never values <hi>ſuch writers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Acrid (with an air of triumph). "There,
ladies, Mr. Antique has confeſſed he has
never read the great Richardſon, the
Shakſpeare of noveliſts; and yet he will
aſſert and aſſure you, that he can decide
on Shakſpeare in manuſcript."</p>
            <p>Antique. "That, my dear friend,
entirely conſiſts in the foxineſs of the ink,

worthy of the divine man! Let us not part
in anger. Critics ſhould be more cautious

            <p>Through the interceſſion of Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
peace was eſtabliſhed between this
couple of critics; but a latent revenge
rankled in the breaſt of Antique, for
Acrid's contempt of him, and Ireland's
Shakſpeare; and when Miſs Million en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
the literary news of the day, he took
an opportunity to diſtil his gall on Acrid's
diſcernment. We ſhall therefore reſume
our dialogue.</p>
            <p>Antique. "We have ſome important
intelligence in the republic of letters; you
have not then heard concerning Eliza?"</p>
            <p>"All that we underſtand (ſaid Miſs
Million) is that the amatory effuſions of
Eliza are only known for their delicacy,
their harmony, and their poetic beauty,
ſo often admired by Mr. Acrid. The
fair ſtill is in the ſhade."</p>
            <p>Acrid here made a very curtailed bow,
and quickly retired.</p>
            <pb n="40" facs="tcp:0063300902:43"/>

            <p>"Eliza" exclaimed Miſs Million "is

            <p>
               <pb n="41" facs="tcp:0063300902:44"/>
Miſs Million. "O ſhocking! what is
Eliza, Dick Diſtich?"</p>
            <p>Antique. "Hear the anecdote! Dick
Diſtich, you know, wrote verſes in all
meaſures; but, in quantity, they were
without meaſure. As he was ſo kind as
to reverſe his name at the cloſe of his
poems, it was of uſe to the incautious.
Ridiculed, but not ſo fortunate as to be
neglected, he retreated to the country in
a nervous fever. His name he knew would
damn his works; ſo calling himſelf Eliza,
and getting a female friend to tranſcribe
his poems, he ſent them to the famous
paper. All the old Cruſcans roſe to a
man! Odes, elegies, and ſonnets, were
poured on Eliza, enough to have made
a fine ſnow-ſhower at Drury Lane.
Eliza was rather broad and warm in her
diction. She was a Sappho, a tenth muſe,
and a fourth grace. Our poets were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured
of this moſt ſenſitive Eliza.
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:0063300902:45"/>
Acrid was as clamorous in his raptures,
as fifty amorous cats on the pantiles.
He imagined her to be the old Laura;
ſo he addreſſed her with this tender billet:
"Amiable Eliza! I love you; can you
pardon the avowal? But I have made it;
and I know not to repeat of it. My
paſſion is like your genius; it terrifies or
ſoothes; hope and deſpair prey on my
ſoul. Hope! alas! I do not hope, and
yet I love." The anſwer of Eliza to this
amatory note, was the moſt conſolatory,
and bid him hope for every favour; but
ſhe added, "What if you knew me?
would your claſſical eye approve of my
perſon? Alas! I am ſhort and brown;
but ſo was Sappho; my noſe is ſnubbed;
but ſo was the beautiful Poppaea's; I
have a ſingular cuſtom when I kiſs to
bite; but ſuch were the marks of fondneſs
which Flora left on her Pompey. If my
perſonal defects can thus be forgiven, as ſo
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:0063300902:46"/>
many claſſical imitations are in my verſes;
then will Sappho receive you as her
Phaon; but, I fear, faithleſs and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed
as that boy." An appointment
was made. Dick invited ſeveral friends
to witneſs the lover's firſt interview. We
ſtood behind a ſcreen; the great critic
arrived; when lo! to the credit of his
critical talents, his Eliza ſtood before
him, in the contemned perſon of poor
Dick Diſtich. What's the conſequence?
The critic's reputation has received the
<hi>coup de grace,</hi> while Eliza's verſes are now
all condemned in one maſs. What was
ſweet fancy in Eliza, is rank dulneſs in
Dick Diſtich. The poetical hermaphro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite
has gained nothing; and the ſex are
but ill complimented; for when Dick was
ſuppoſed to be a woman, thoſe verſes
were applauded, which are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned
becauſe he is a man. So, ladies,
I recommend the poor devil to your pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection."</p>

               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:0063300902:47"/>
"Lord! I wiſh I had known all this
before," cried Miſs Million. "Here is a
confuſion in the realms of taſte! We have
been applauding the narcotic infuſions of
Dick Diſtich, while we thought them
the diſſolving effuſions of a Sappho. How
can one judge of people's poetry, if they
deceive us with names?"</p>
            <p>"In theſe caſes" obſerved Charles, "we
can never fail, if we read poems without
regarding names. Should the reader
then blunder, he muſt not blame the
author. You may now exclaim with

            <p>VAURIEN had become the <hi>friend</hi>
of Lady Belfield; and this word,
even in the dictionary of faſhionable lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
has not degenerated into a non-entity;
but the adroitneſs of vice, knows
to diſguiſe it's impurities, by adorning
them with the holy titles that are ſacred
to virtue; it is thus that it's groſſneſs is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed,
it's deformity invites, and it's horrors
are crowned with delights that are not it's
own. We think, at firſt, that we enjoy
love, when we graſp at luſt; that we are
ſoothed by friendſhip, when we liſten to ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cophancy;
and that we purſue amuſement
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:0063300902:49"/>
when we are heavily dragged through diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipation.
To the clear eye of reaſon, the
pleaſures of vice pay an involuntary tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
of honour to virtue, by aſſuming it's
name; and it is at leaſt a conſolation to
ſome, and a conviction to many, that
vice would loſe half of its ſeduction, did
it not at firſt appear in the diſguiſe of
ſome virtue.</p>
            <p>Lady Belfield, enamoured of the gay
and accompliſhed. Frenchman, was for
ſome time occupied in his enjoyment;
but it was no ſoothing alliance of the
heart; no imperiſhable union of two
kindred virtues; it was merely an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation
of the ſenſes; a flame that raged
at intervals, and often ſunk in the dying
embers of paſſion, and left behind them
the diſguſts of criminal pleaſure, the cold
aſhes of ſatiety. The modeſt and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Charles, ſtill agitated her ſoul with
thoſe delicate impreſſions, by which the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:0063300902:50"/>
bluſhing form of unpolluted man touches
and irritates even the boſom of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.
His modeſty but inflamed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
and his apathy was a myſtery
ſhe could not penetrate. In vain ſhe
planned occaſions to ſurprize him into
ſeduction; his principles were firm; and
could they ever have yielded, another
paſſion at this time came to his aid, and
his heart was filled with the image of
Emily.</p>
            <p>Charles had frequently entered into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations
with this amiable girl, and ſhe
had diſcovered in him a ſecret value which
was more delightful to her feelings when
abſent, than the recollection of Vaurien's
more applauded and dazzling qualities.
Vaurien faſcinated in her preſence; Charles
enchanted in his abſence; one was to be
looked at, and the other was remembered.
The one was all that imagination could
form of the agreeable, and the other all
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:0063300902:51"/>
that ſentiment could form of the tender.
The voice of Vaurien was muſic that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galed
the ear, but the voice of Charles
penetrated the abſtract ear of memory.
Vaurien exhibited the moſt agile graces
of form, the moſt delightful amenity of
manners; and, never uniform, varied a
thouſand ſhapes, and charmed in all.
Charles had nothing of this verſatility;
he muſed, and was rarely gay; but there
was a ſweetneſs in his ſeriouſneſs, and a
dignity in his comportment, which, by
it's very uniformity, impreſſed a heart ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptible
of reflection and ſentiment, with
features more prominent and energetic,
than the ſofter lineaments of Vaurien.
Vaurien never gained on reflection, all
was ſeen at once; nothing was concealed
for the private eye; he ſeduced the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic
applauſe, but could not fix the
individual affection. Charles exhibited
a latent merit. His commoneſt action
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:0063300902:52"/>
proceeded from a ſuperior impulſe. In
the ſilence of meditation, in that ſecret
hour when abſent from our friends, we
try, without paſſion, their merits, their
follies, and their weakneſſes, Vaurien
appeared a common man, who ſeemed to
perform uncommon actions; and Charles
an uncommon man, whoſe actions were
ſet off neither by oſtentation nor ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.
Vaurien poſſeſſed the mind of Emily,
but Charles was the inmate of her heart.</p>
            <p>Emily and Charles, amidſt their bril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant
circles, ſeemed only to taſte of a
fugitive happineſs, when they could con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trive
to ſit together, and indulge their
ſympathy of ſentiment. In the eyes of
Emily might be read her ſoul; ſhe look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her thoughts; ſhe had none to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe;
but ſome perplexities, ſome
bluſhes, ſome tremors, ſhe experienced in
theſe ſhort interviews with Charles. He
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:0063300902:53"/>
read to her, one day, the cloſe of the
Spring of Thomſon, where, with peculiar
ſenſibility, that poet of lovers raiſes a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
fairy exiſtence of conjugal felicity; a
fading dream, that claims a tear from the
eye it has ſolaced; a heaven of love, that
charms and pains it's trembling, it's ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering,
it's doubtful martyr. As he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded,
his eyes wandered from the book
to Emily; he pronounced words while
attention wandered; he ſtopped ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly;
Emily leant on his ſhoulder, to
look at the verſe; ſhe ſaw a tear gliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
on the page. "You have miſſed whole
lines, Sir," ſaid ſhe. "I will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence
the paſſage, Miſs Emily; I was
thinking that the tender Thomſon loved
and was beloved, yet knew not the only
felicity of Love. I proceed—
<q>
                  <l>What is the world to them!</l>
                  <l>Who in each other claſp, whatever fair</l>

                  <l>
                     <pb n="51" facs="tcp:0063300902:54"/>High fancy forms and laviſh hearts can wiſh,</l>
                  <l>Something than beauty dearer, ſhould they look</l>
                  <l>Or on the mind, or mind-illumin'd face—</l>
               </q>
Charles raiſed his eye from the volume;
the face of Emily was covered with
bluſhes; ſhe gazed on him, and ſeemed
to withdraw her eye with timidity, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luctance,
and alarm. When he came to
theſe lines,
<q>
                  <l>An elegant ſufficiency, content,</l>
                  <l>Retirement, rural quiet, friendſhip, books,</l>
                  <l>Eaſe and alternate labour, uſeful life,</l>
                  <l>Progreſſive virtue, and approving Heaven.</l>
               </q>
Charles uttered an audible ſigh. Emily,
ſmiling, ſaid, "Sure that ſigh was not
for Thomſon!"—"Ah! no, Miſs Emily,
I wonder why I ſigh; what lines can have
a leſs-adorned ſimplicity? and yet they
penetrate my heart. I fear that ſigh was
nothing but vanity and ſelfiſhneſs; it
was for myſelf."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="52" facs="tcp:0063300902:55"/>
It is evident, that when Thomſon is
read by two young perſons of either ſex,
with this taſte and ſenſibility, the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
threaten to diſturb the repoſe of
friendſhip by the intruſion of love; and
when love is conducted by poetry, his
armed hand is wrapt beneath a gay man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
and ſtrikes more deeply a perfidious
blow.</p>
            <p>Emily's quiet was attempted to be
diſturbed by others. The Reverend
Ephraim Dandelion enliſted among her
admirers. He was a boyiſh divine, a
caſſocked huntſman, and a clerical buck.
His viſits to Miſs Million were not ſo
uninterrupted as he deſired, owing to his
father, an opulent Rector reſiding in
the vicinity of Saliſbury, and alſo to the
Biſhop of that dioceſe, who, as he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved,
was "a blockhead of the old
ſchool." Indeed, this Biſhop was by no
means a man of faſhion; he bore a moſt
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:0063300902:56"/>
religious antipathy towards all thoſe young
clergymen who were in full poſſeſſion of a
plurality of livings, and who eſcaped from
them all to reſide in the metropolis, and
to dreſs their hair as they thought proper.
Ephraim was the hope of his family, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
he was the eldeſt ſon; he had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
been his father's favourite in his cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle;
in which place the ſacerdotal infant
may be ſaid to have felt a ſimoniacal
propenſity, for indeed ſimony was a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional</hi>
vice in that family. There, by
ſome ingenuity of his pious father the
Rector, he was inducted into two good
advowſons, ſo that ere the young gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
iſſued from his pupillage, he <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
himſelf</hi> to his own livings, and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
undertook the cure of the ſouls of
ſeveral pariſhes. He was a young man
of modeſt diſpoſitions, and held in vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
the holy profeſſion; and as he at
once was a Nimrod in the field, and a
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:0063300902:57"/>
Narciſſus within doors, he decently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
two perſons to perform his own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
For this purpoſe he found two fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers
of large families, at the market-price
then of forty pounds a year. He
was alſo a rigid obſerver of the utmoſt ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity
in the performance of all church
ſervices, and teſtified an uncommon zeal
for eccleſiaſtical rights; the former con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted
in the perſonal appearance of his
curates; and whenever he heard the
ſlighteſt complaint of a naſal twang, or a
guttural digeſtion of words, or of a brown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh
black coat, ſuch a curate was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged
at a week's notice; and his zeal
for eccleſiaſtical rights was evidently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited
in his ſeizure of all bands, black
gloves, white favours, funeral ſcarfs, and
the chriſtening or marriage guinea. On
the whole, he was a moſt orthodox ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porter
of the <hi>church</hi>; underſtanding by
this word a certain ancient building, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circled
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:0063300902:58"/>
by a burying-ground, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior
furniſhed with a certain water-ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
vulgarly denominated the baptiſmal
fount; burials and chriſtenings, therefore,
producing no inconſiderable income, he
moſt zealouſly ſupported the aforeſaid
<hi>church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But although a ſturdy advocate for
church ſubordination, he could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
to grant this to his Biſhop. Too
active in field ſports during the ſummer,
and quite exhauſted in town diſſipa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ions
during the winter, he moſt juſtly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained
of the inceſſant and perſonal at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks
of his ſaid Biſhop; who, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly
at one of his annual dinners given
to his aſſembled brethren, did moſt inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licately
reprimand our faſhionable Rector;
Vicar, and Prebendary, for all theſe ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours
and their appurtenances were united
in young Ephraim. He reſolved now
to throw off the yoke of eccleſiaſtical ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:0063300902:59"/>
and, to the great comfort of
our ſacerdotal bucks, they may enjoy the
revenues of an eccleſiaſtic, without the
<hi>boriſh</hi> performance of the functions.
Ephraim had great intereſt with the
Prince, for two reaſons: In a drunken
frolic at Brighton, he had received the
honour of being thrown into a gravel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit,
by which means he broke his leg;
but as his neck was entire, he did not
much lament the fracture, ſince it was
a kind of claim on princely patronage;
and the other reaſon was, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verend
Ephraim Dandelion was a perſon
of inimitable talent, in imitating the bray
of an aſs and the whine of a pig. The
aſs and the pig, with the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned
daſh into the gravel-pit, procured
him an honorary place in the Prince's
army of Chaplains. This honour brings
with it the uſeful privilege of enabling
the poſſeſſor to hold as many livings as
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:0063300902:60"/>
he can get, while it comfortably relieves
him of the tedious duty of reſidence; ſo
the happy Ephraim, aſpiring now to a
Biſhoprick, never more entered the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
of his Biſhop.</p>
            <p>Although we know of no facts (for of
facts ſhould all true hiſtories like the
preſent conſiſt) that might tend to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe
him of any venial liberalities to his
miſerable curates, yet he was well ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
to commit ſuch follies; for he now
held, in livings and <hi>ceteras,</hi> above two
thouſand a year, according to his own
frequent avowal, and little leſs he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected
from the worthy Rector his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who was of a moſt plethoric habit,
was a Gargantua in point of ſtomach,
one of the moſt orthodox veniſon eaters
in his county, and had been twice touched
by an apoplexy.</p>
            <p>A character more ſingular and inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting
was the voluptuous Sedley. A
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:0063300902:61"/>
paſſion for ſelf-enjoyment was the ſource
of his actions; his life was a ſyſtem of
refined Epicuriſm; his ſtudy was an art
to irritate deſire, and to protract enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;
to throw over the nudities of
imagination a thin and brilliant veil,
woven by the Graces. He was born with
a ſenſitive heart and a romantic fancy,
but his natural benevolence was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
ſacrificed to his artificial grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications;
yet of his dangerous talent,
his numerous victims rather murmured
than complained; their ruin ſeemed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorned;
deſpair was half ſoothed by the
memory of it's paſt enjoyments; and,
at leaſt, the ſincerity of their maſter was
evinced in his having become his own
victim. His fortune and his felicity were
alike exhauſted in the fatal ravages of
his paſſions; a dark vacuity in his heart
terrified his ſolitude; with all the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of affection he found he could not<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:0063300902:62"/>
love; with all the curious felicity of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
he found he had never enjoyed;
enervated by the anguiſh of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
yet ſtimulated by the fever of hope,
he wandered in a tumultuous purſuit of
that pleaſure, which, if fugitive, torment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
with deſire; and, if embraced, ſickened
with ſatiety.</p>
            <p>There was ſomething grand and ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic
in his entire eſtabliſhment. All
the luxuries of Europe were his domeſtic
enjoyments; every ſenſe was flattered,
and the imagination itſelf was attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
to be ſatisfied. He held a corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpondence
with foreign parts, to import
every novelty of refined ſenſuality; and
the ſame ſhip often conveyed to him,
a picture of Raphael, a hogſhead of
Montepulciano, and a female ſelected for
ſome peculiarity of ſeature. His houſes
reſounded with muſic; and all the arts
of amenity crouded to the opulent idler.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:0063300902:63"/>
The heats of ſummer were cooled by the
ices of winter; and his winter garden was
prodigal of the roſes of ſummer. Every
day he religiouſly gratified his five ſenſes.
It was this Engliſhman of whom Mercier
relates, that he boaſted of having ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired
a ſixth ſenſe. It conſiſted in the
ſingular fancy of aſſembling females, who
reſembled by their features the beauties
of other times. He diſperſed through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
Europe portraits of his ancient fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites;
and ſometimes prolonged his
mornings with the Scottiſh Mary and
Anne Bullen, and ſometimes was ſeated
at ſupper between Cleopatra and Poppaea.
The illuſion was ſtill further promoted by
preſerving their <hi>coſtume,</hi> and dreſſing every
beauty according to the country and the
age ſhe perſonified.</p>
            <p>In his country retreat he was charmed
by an Arcadian taſte, and realized the
romance of the golden age. There he
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:0063300902:64"/>
would habit himſelf as a ſhepherd, and
walking by the ſide of a ſtage-dancer, his
favourite ſultana, while ſhe played on a
little harp, he held a crook in his hand,
a baſket at his ſide, and wore a ſtraw hat
wreathed with roſes. In the ſemblance
of peace and enjoyment, he wandered
through the winding alleys of ſpring, and
diſported in the rich ſhrubberies of his
ground. His companions at diſtance war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled
their tendereſt airs, and the ſympho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies
of muſical inſtruments reſponded to
the harp of his ſhepherdeſs. Nightingales,
trained for this purpoſe, iſſued from their
neſts, and ſettling, ſome near the fantaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
Arcadian, and ſome on the harp of
his miſtreſs, rivalled her provoking me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodies,
fluttered, fainted, and fell at her
feet.</p>
            <p>To ſuch puerilities can deſcend the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate
indulgence of an ungoverned
fancy; and in vain will the incredulous,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:0063300902:65"/>
in his circumſcribed experience, cenſure
theſe inſtances, as the ideal pictures of an
author's heated fancy, ſince theſe are facts
ſanctioned by their truth; and others, not
of an inferior extravagance, not long ago
amuſed the tedium of the exiſtence of a
noble Lord.</p>
            <p>But in Sedley, his puerilities were not
unaccompanied with taſte, nor was his
voluptuouſneſs inhuman and void of ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.
Voluptuouſneſs had made him no
otherwiſe to be condemned, than in thoſe
ſeducing powers, and thoſe brilliant illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
which betrayed the ſenſibility of the
feminine heart. The voluptuouſneſs of a
woman can never be pardoned; chaſtity
is like a ſeal to a rich caſket, which, while
preſerved entire, we know can never have
been pillaged of it's gems. Senſuality is
maſculine, for it is groſs; let the crime
and the puniſhment be reſerved for man.
Sedley was, otherwiſe, the friend of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:0063300902:66"/>
nature, and loved the enjoyments of
others, becauſe to him it was an enjoyment.
But when, at certain intervals, his ſenſes
were exhauſted, recollection obtruded it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
on his ſtartled mind; it came in the
wan form of ſatiety, that ſpectre of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted
pleaſure! The images of thoſe he
had rendered miſerable, of ſome the ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cides,
and of others the lives, gave to his
repentant heart the pains themſelves had
experienced. The gay Sedley ſhed the
bittereſt tears in ſilence; and he mourned
at once the unhappineſs of his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions
and his own. "I am a wretch,"
he would ſay, "but not from the malice
of my heart, but from it's pervading ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
I periſh with thoſe that I have loſt,
and I have not inflicted one pang on
others, which I would not bear myſelf—Not I! but Nature is inhuman; I liſten
to her voice, the wanderings of my heart
are her inſpirations, and if ſhe betrays
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:0063300902:67"/>
thoſe whom ſhe conducts, who can wreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
with the divinity of Nature? She has
given too few ſenſes, and too numerous
deſires; and nature forms herſelf the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing
ſcourge, that affrights and afflicts
the gentleſt of the human race!" Such
was the character, and ſuch the reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of Sedley.</p>
            <p>At a morning viſit to Miſs Million,
Emily, not being preſent, became the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
of their animadverſions.</p>
            <p>"She is certainly a d<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap> fine girl,
only too modeſt," ſaid the Reverend
Ephraim Dandelion.</p>
            <p>"O!" exclaimed Miſs Million, "you
can't conceive what vaſt pleaſure it has
given me, to have found out the old blind
Lieutenant's daughter. When I ſaw her
at Exmouth, I repeatedly preſſed her
with invitations to Portman-ſquare, but
never expected to ſee the poor thing.
There ſhe was quite ſolitary and timid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:0063300902:68"/>
"We ſhall then beat her hollow,"
cried Dandelion, "for a hare is ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary
and timid, but yields as fine ſport
as a fox."</p>
            <p>"She is a delicious creature!" cried
Sedley.</p>
            <p>"The moſt amiable and accompliſhed!"
ſaid Lady Belfield.</p>
            <p>"The moſt faſcinating!" ſaid Vaurien.</p>
            <p>"I think" gravely obſerved Charles, "ſhe will be in ſome danger among
us all."</p>
            <p>"What danger, Sir?" ſharply repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
Lady Belfield. "I will anſwer
for you poſitively. A young woman is
never in danger in the great world, among
the moſt poliſhed part of ſociety. We
do not blazon forth every caſual indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion;
an honourable ſilence protects a
woman; while in your plebeian circles,
the ſlighteſt gallantries are conſtrued into
unpardonable levities; the moſt agreeable
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:0063300902:69"/>
fleurettes are ſuppoſed to be declarations
of love; and if an aſſignation ſhould be
diſcovered, the whole family, venerable
papa, the little ſiſter, and the tall brother,
and the whole generation take the alarm.
A duel and a divorce complete the vulgar
farce; nothing leſs will do than an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
Lucretia! whoſe hiſtory no one cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dits
more than Curtius leaping into the
great gulf."</p>
            <p>"Indeed, Lady Belfield," replied Miſs
Million, "I had forgot to mention to you,
that half of Mr. Charles' merits are loſt in
his morality. What is meant by this ſame
morality? I am ſure it gives no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
of the world; for Lord Cheſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's
divine works they ſay are immoral,
and the inſupportable Rambler they ſay
is a very moral work. But, Lord! don't
let us talk of morality! it always brings
on my nervous complaint. I do not know
what to do with myſelf this whole day.
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:0063300902:70"/>
(the yawned) I wiſh I had ſome new
place to go to."</p>
            <p>"Juſt now," ſaid Vaurien, "the Lord
Mayor's ſhow is ſetting off from the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion-houſe.
What do you think of a ride
to the city?"</p>
            <p>"O, vulgar!" cried Miſs Million, "I
never drive into the city but on Sundays;
the ſtreets are ſo narrow, and the carts are
ſo broad! But what does your Ladyſhip
think of this ſhow?"</p>
            <p>"I am quite diſengaged, Miſs Million,"
ſaid Lady Belfield.</p>
            <p>"Why then we'll ſet off directly. Well,
but my dear Vaurien, what ſhall we do
after the ſhow?"</p>
            <p>"Truſt to good fortune! There is the
wax-work in Fleet-ſtreet."</p>
            <p>"Abſolutely childiſh! What thinks
your Ladyſhip?"</p>
            <p>"It would be ſo great a novelty to me,
that I am ſure I ſhould be pleaſed."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:0063300902:71"/>
"Well, then we'll go to the wax-work
in Fleet-ſtreet" ſaid Miſs Million. "I
dare ſay it will be in all the papers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow.
Then where can we paſs two
hours more? I can't think of coming
home to dreſs till five. Then, from five
to ſeven are my two regular deſperate
hours; 'tis a melancholy interval of time,
when one is quite dreſs'd for dinner, and
wiſhes for it, without appetite, merely to
ſee company. All the nobility are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
from five to ſeven."</p>
            <p>"I have many!" cried Vaurien, "The
ventriloquiſt, and the ſtone-eater; the
Corſican fairy, and the Poliſh dwarf.
There's a collection of Chineſe curioſities;
three monſters, with throats as large as
their bodies; a full-grown elephant; and
a lap-dog, which may be put in a ſnuff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>box,
going to be ſhipped off for the Dutch
governor of Batavia; and, above all, there
is a <hi>poupée</hi> of Madame Tallien, who now
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:0063300902:72"/>
reigns like the Queen of France, and
which is juſt brought over by a French
milliner, as a model of the preſent Pariſian
faſhion; not three perſons in town have
ſeen it! the dreſs is richly fanciful, and
perfectly in the old Roman ſtyle; the
breaſts uncovered, one ſide of the robe
drawn up, which delightfully exhibits
the whole leg, and a little higher; it
is the moſt voluptuous and moſt brilliant
dreſs."</p>
            <p>"Delightful!" exclaimed Miſs Million,
"let us ſet off."</p>
            <p>"My dear friend," ſaid Sedley, "pray
give me the addreſs, that I may have
a copy of the poupee of Madame Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lien."</p>
            <p>Emily now entering, was invited by
Miſs Million to the whole circle of theſe
morning amuſements; but ſhe pleaded
indiſpoſition, and the company retired.
Sedley, however, gave up the poupee of
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:0063300902:73"/>
Madame Tallien, for the preſent moment,
and returning into the breakfaſt-room,
found himſelf alone with Emily. It was
a moment he had long deſired, but which
had hitherto eluded his attempts. What
paſſed between our amiable heroine and
our refined voluptuary, is, perhaps, enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
to the honours of a ſeparate chapter.</p>

            <p>"I HAVE brought," ſaid Sedley, as
he returned, "a verſion of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite
poet; here it is, Miſs Emily,
for you was it compoſed; but even you
have failed to inſpire me with the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy
and amenity of the voluptuous Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creon
of France. <hi>L'Art d'Aimer</hi> of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard
cannot be tranſlated, at leaſt permit
me thus to conſole my own inability.
Could you but catch the ſeductive graces
of the original, I ſhould trace, in the
touching languor of your eye, the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment
of your heart. He is the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bano
of poetry. In his amiable minia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:0063300902:75"/>
he paints the playful triumphs or
the children of love; fervid, yet chaſte;
true, yet flattering. It is only nature
embelliſhed.</p>
            <p>"Bernard was my friend, as well as maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter;
he was the moſt amiable man at the
moſt amiable court. An arbiter elegan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiarum
in the moſt refined circles at Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris;
the art of pleaſing in converſation was
ſtill more ſenſibly felt than the art of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighting
by his graceful and diſſolving
verſe. Voltaire conſidered him as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digy
of elegant voluptuouſneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In noticing Saint Bernard, and another Bernard celebrated for his wealth, he adds,

verſes reſpire a continued ſoftneſs, are
gay with a thouſand pictures, and are the

enamellings of poetry. In his manners,
what eaſy, yet reſiſtleſs grace! No man
had ſo much of that light flower of taſte
which blooms but for a rapid moment,
thoſe brilliant colours that fade while we
gaze on them. Ah! that any thing of
Bernard ſhould be periſhable!"</p>
            <p>"Mr. Sedley," interrupted Emily, "I
love all kinds of enthuſiam; but in this
caſe, as you labour with great perplexity
to deſcribe your maſter, tell me at once
he was an effeminate, refined, and lively
Frenchman."</p>
            <p>"For your ſex his paſſion was exceſſive;
but he was inconſtant; and yet, Miſs Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
he was beloved. Not a Pariſian beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
complained of his infidelities; for the
charms of his genius they pardoned the
wanderings of his heart; and he cenſures
his own inconſtancies with ſuch gaiety, that
they ſeem to be only ſo many triumphs.</p>
            <p>"I know not how it happened, but poor

Bernard ſurvived himſelf. In my laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence
at Paris, I found the voluptuous
poet a mere ſhadow of exiſtence; and he
who had charmed by the lightneſs and
the tenderneſs of his effuſions, was then a
mute idiot. I have been at the opera
with him when they performed his own
admirable Caſtor and Pollux. He gazed
with a vacant eye, and we could draw no
other converſation from him than inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant
enquiries if his Majeſty was ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?
If Madame de Pompadour was
pleaſed? Courtier to the laſt, the royal
favour was the ſolitary ſentiment that oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied
the inſenſate idiot. Ah! Miſs
Emily, it was an humiliation for the man
of pleaſure and the man of wit, to view
their gay and amiable chief with eyes
that diſtilled unmeaning tears, an exani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate
frame that ſat motionleſs, and whoſe
voice could not utter an expreſſion but
which confirmed his idiotiſm."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="tcp:0063300902:78"/>
"The title of his poem," obſerved
Emily, "is to me a condemning criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſm.
I ſhould be very ſorry, I aſſure
you, to be <hi>taught</hi> an "Art of Love." I
fear it is a misfortune for moſt in theſe
times to be in love without art. But by
your account of Bernard I am much gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified;
you know I am delighted by a
moral tale, and I think your's is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
moral; it is a true and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
picture of thoſe fooliſh wits, who,
abandoned to the fury of their paſſions,
are not leſs pernicious to themſelves than
to their neighbours. Since you have
printed this dangerous poem, have the
candour to give this laſt anecdote of Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard's
life, as a preface or a poſtſcript.
Mr. Sedley will believe me, when I ſay I
am not faſtidiouſly moral; I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
every deviation from our own ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed
habits to be turpitude, or even
error. I have ſeen prudes grow outrage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:0063300902:79"/>
at freedoms with their perſons, which
I ſhould conſider as very inoffenſive. If
I were in France, where, I am told, the
ladies indulge in many familiarities, more
harmleſs than they ſeem, I think I ſhould
only conſider them as local cuſtoms. But
libertiniſm, Mr. Sedley, in whatever form
it comes, whether it be gay with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
of youth, or vapid with the tremors
of age, adorned by the charms of verſe, or
ſyſtematized by the philoſophy of proſe, is
irreconcilable to my feelings. I will not
look for the reaſons that may have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
its abhorrence; it is enough for me,
that it's inſpection raiſes a diſguſt ſo na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
and energetic, that I loſe my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience
when I ſeek for reaſons. I do
not know that I could give any ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory
reaſon why I prefer perfumes to
ordures, but that my organs are ſo framed
as to be attracted by the one, and to be
repulſed by the other. In theſe caſes,
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0063300902:80"/>
the beſt reaſon will be, in not attempting
to reaſon; as, to return to your poem, all
my art of love will, I hope, be, to have
no art at all."</p>
            <p>"A ſlight miſconception, not a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
in opinion, amiable Miſs Emily!
has afforded you this vindictive exulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
How juſtly you obſerve, that there

as not to exact the frigid and impotent
efforts of an inactive reaſon. Do not

You have been told, that the deſires of
love are crimes, but they are only amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments;
you conſider him as a tyrant or a

It is this ſubmiſſive ſentiment, tender and

                  <p>Sedley is repeating in proſe what his friend Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard

               </note>. Who more
modeſt and retired than a ſenſitive lover?
In ſhade and in ſilence are all the ſurtive
careſſes of love received. Love is a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret

it is for the applauſe of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs,

and not for that of the world, a lover
pants.</p>
            <p>"Lament then with me, my dear Miſs
Emily, the prejudices of our age and our
country; how rarely does love unite two
hearts in the ſanctioned pleaſures of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimony!
The conjugal couch we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
as polluted, when two congenial
ſpirits meet—but meet too late; and
ſhould they love as nature dictates to the
heart, we reproach them, we diſgrace
them, we haraſs them with the iron ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles
of law. Unnatural laws, but moſt
natural loves! How often have I wiſhed
to have been an inmate of thoſe countries
which we call barbarous, but which I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire,
as the only regions where nature is
not offended by the haughty temerity of
man! O! happy people, where the lover
compoſes his fragrant letter with the

conſenting bluſhes of his beloved; and
the chaſte lily, the conſummation of his

lighted match to their miſtreſs, and if
ſhe blows it, they are happy. But pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitated
love loſes half it's pleaſures.
Sweet and romantic is the varied interval
between deſire and enjoyment. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
of the chace is not in it's game, but
it's purſuit. Let a baſhful miſtreſs be
capricious, be cruel, be every thing; but
let her at length be kind. We claim but
the reward of induſtry, a holiday in the
toiling year of ſlavery</p>
            <p>"If we liſten to Nature, can we err?
"To enjoy is to obey," declares your
own poet of reaſon. And what is the
arid uniformity of life, but a dull and
unmeaning paſſage, unleſs ſome tranſient
roſes are ſcattered at our feet? Our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:0063300902:84"/>
is derived from our ſenſes; corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real
ſenſibility is the ſource of our paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
the motive of our thought, the
magnet of our ſociability; and, in one
word, it is our miſery or our enjoyment.
Nature never relinquiſhes our heart; it's
emotions cuſtom may pervert, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
may condemn. But to the tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
alive how tedious is cuſtom! how
diſmal is reaſon! Ah! reaſon, Miſs
Emily, what is reaſon? nothing but a
prevailing ſyſtem of opinions, which in
time are mutilated and reverſed, and
which, directed merely by accidental cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms,
is various in every people. Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
is compelled to elaborate with ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
pangs, ſyſtem upon ſyſtem, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys
itſelf, in it's attempts of ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation;
and when a man is devoid of
ſenſibility, he is conſidered to be the
ableſt dialectician. Now, if ſenſibility is
but the ſoft workings of nature, mark
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:0063300902:85"/>
how unnatural is reaſon! But pleaſure,
that is, ſenſibility gratified, is the ſponta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous
effuſion of nature; it's language is
univerſal, it's actions are uniform; the
ſame at the burning line as on the icy
Alps. Our ſenſes are the porches of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
ever open to all our pleaſures; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
magiſterially would cloſe them; but
theſe veins are the canals of delight, and
would you freeze them? Reaſon may
make a conqueſt, but Pleaſure alone can
be loved, for ſhe is the enchanting and
the native ſovereign of the heart."</p>
            <p>To this ſubtile and tedious philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy
Emily patiently liſtened, and then
replied. "Alas! Sir, why do you em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy
your talents in a cauſe ſo feeble,
and yet ſo dangerous? All that you have
beautifully ſaid cannot conceal the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſting
reality; it is only ſpreading the
variegated hues of the rainbow on the
filthy webs of ſpiders. I anſwer you,
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:0063300902:86"/>
however, that reaſon, melancholy as you
term it, is my pleaſure. I therefore agree
with you, that I ſhould loath exiſtence,
did not indulge my pleaſure. Reaſon
is immutable, for it is truth. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
that there exiſts a falſe, as well as
a true reaſon; as there is a pleaſure that
is true, and another which is falſe. It is
therefore not difficult to deſcribe the one,
while we are only alluding to the other;
and, perhaps, had I not been rather ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular
in my habits of life, and my taſte
for reading, I might have been deluded
in liſtening to you; I might have miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en
a falſe and ſpurious pleaſure, for that
which alone is true and durable. Conſider,
therefore, the wickedneſs of propagating
maxims which all may liſten to with
pleaſure, while few can diſcriminate with
judgment."</p>
            <p>"Dear Miſs Emily, it is you who
form ſophiſms. Why will you call rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:0063300902:87"/>
pleaſure, and it's variance, immuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility?
Is that pleaſure, that commands
an abſtinence from enjoyment, and which
is frequently known to communicate an
antipathy of exiſtence? No, not all the
propoſitions of Locke can change one
organ that inebriates the heart. And is
this reaſon immutable, which is variable
as the heavens, and as changeable in a
people as in an individual? When rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
flies to the cloiſter, does pleaſure fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low?
When the anchorite ſhuts up the
human heart, what remains but the wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
ſpectre of man? Pure and trace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
is the pliability of pleaſure, pure and
traceleſs as this kiſs!" He took her hand,
and raiſed it to his inclining lips. It was
done with ſuch modeſty and gentleneſs,
that Emily could not be angry; ſhe was
only confuſed.</p>
            <p>"Mr. Sedley," ſhe ſaid, "I know
theſe freedoms are conſidered rather as
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:0063300902:88"/>
favours done to us; but allow me to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
my own ſenſations. I have lived
in retirement; I cannot grant ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidious
liberties. You would not, I am
ſure, be ſatisfied with that poor gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of ſeizing from an unprotected fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male
that which ſhe muſt not refuſe, and
will not grant."</p>
            <p>"Heaven forbid, my charming Miſs
Emily, angel as you are, in mind as in
form! Pleaſure is no ſolitary gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
it is a dividual enjoyment; if you
are miſerable, I therefore cannot be
happy. Alas! you perſiſt in refuſing
the ſupreme felicity of a chaſte voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;
in preferring the ſpiritleſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
of life, to that enchantment which
gives to one day the exiſtence of an
age, the deliciouſneſs of mutual poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
But recollect, that with the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence
of this chaſte voluptuouſneſs, no
virtue refuſes to be united; and ſuch
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:0063300902:89"/>
amiable women have adorned ſociety,
and cheriſhed the duties of humanity.

            <p>When the philoſophic voluptuary quit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
Emily, he placed his poem in a book
ſhe had been reading, unperceived by
her, and ſhe now retired to dreſs. Mrs.
Bully ſoon afterwards entered, and her
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:0063300902:90"/>
curious and inquiſitorial eye, always ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed
on the appearance of a volume,
unfortunately diſcovered in Emily's this
"Art of Love." "A pretty title in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed,"
ſhe exclaimed, "for a modeſt
young lady! Yet Miſs Emily can't
read the Bible becauſe of ſome amorous
hiſtories, which "ſhe began, but would
never finiſh." A curſe on ſuch Socinian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm!"
Here ſhe turned over the leaves,
and then cried out, "Lord ſave us!

which I ſuppoſe only means a bed.
What's this?—<q>

            <head type="sub">Of Loving by Anticipation. A Year of
Patronage.</head>
            <p>LOVE, in it's earlieſt ſtage, has a
variety of ways of exhibiting itſelf.
There is love at firſt ſight, which we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
to be a very faſhionable and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious
manner with ſome of our living
noveliſts; yet I cannot applaud them for
any invention in this reſpect. To detect
the fineſt foldings of the human heart, is
the pleaſing ſkill of us domeſtic biogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers.
Then, there is love without love,
by which we underſtand the Platonic af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection;
but what a ridiculous figure
would the amiable boy make, if he were
to hold in his hand an uſeleſs torch with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:0063300902:93"/>
a flame, which, we are inclined to
think, is the chimerical flambeau which
every Platoniſt waves. But the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable,
and, we conceive, the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious
kind of love, is when we are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
enamoured of a perſon, whom we
have never ſeen, and of whom we have
never heard. It is a kind of love to
which we are extremely partial, having
ourſelves formed a hundred delightful
miſeries of ſuch deliciouſneſs; pleaſures
of which, aſſuredly, only exquiſite ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
or exquiſite madneſs, has ever felt
the inebriation. A Spaniſh hero, in one
of the plays of Calderon, to apologize for
his moſt fervent, but moſt ſudden paſſion,
obſerves, that he loved his miſtreſs before
he knew her, becauſe he was fated to
love her. Others, the very Caeſars of love,
may exclaim, I ſaw, I loved, I conquered!
but then ſuch a happy victory will more
depend on the heroine than the hero; unleſs
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:0063300902:94"/>
the latter ſhould poſſeſs a brilliant enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>page,
a noble manſion, and a noble income;
and in that predicament, the hero may
juſtly attribute his triumph entirely to
himſelf. But of the kind of love which
we form for a perſon quite unknown to
us, the moſt pleaſing inſtance is that of
the once famous Zayde, who by the
means of an unknown portrait, hung in
her father's gallery, felt a moſt vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
paſſion for her lover, about twenty
years before ever ſhe ſaw him; ſo that,
without any violation of decency, ſhe
might have thrown herſelf into his arms
at the very firſt moment they met; but,
unfortunately, when ſhe met the man ſhe
ſo ardently loved, ſhe paſſed ſeveral years
in his ſociety, which a reſolution not to
love him, becauſe ſhe loved his picture,
which it is evident was not neceſſary for
her to know was his picture, till the laſt
page of that romance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:0063300902:95"/>
Among this claſs of lovers by anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
we muſt place our good Charles;
for he was fond of Emily, and his heart
palpitated warmly at the ſound of her
name, long before their firſt accidental
interview at Mrs. Wilſon's; he loved
without having ſeen her; for he loved
her moſt affectionately for her filial piety,
and her patient ſufferings; but when he
ſaw her, to love is but a poverty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
to deſignate with preciſion the
tumult that ruſhed on his heart, that
made him inactive in the day, and reſtleſs
in the night. With Emily, the grand
affair of love was far different; as ſhe had
not any equal impulſes to love Charles
before ſhe ſaw him, when ſhe did ſee him
the paſſion grew by ſlow gradations; ſhe
was averſe to indulge the ſuſceptibility
of her heart; ſhe had a latent propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
to a dangerous infection, rather than
that ſhe felt the immedicable diſorder.
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:0063300902:96"/>
To gain the full poſſeſſion of her virtuous
heart, it was neceſſary to merit it; and
as ſuch opportunities do not eaſily occur,
(at leaſt in true hiſtories like the preſent)
it was long before ſhe perceived the juſt
claim of Charles to that valued gift.
And when ſhe began to love, moſt unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
it occurred, that ſhe was obliged
to dread, and to hate, as we purpoſe
ſhortly to detail.</p>
            <p>Emily entered the parlour one day,
followed by the Reverend Ephraim Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delion.
She flung open the door with a
haſty violence, unuſual with her mild
manners; her face was one bluſh; her
whole frame one diſorder. "Heavens!
what is the matter, child?" enquired
Miſs Million. "Nothing, Madam;" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
the confuſed Emily, "but Mr.
Dandelion, I preſume, will be taught to
reſpect himſelf, or me, for the future. As
it aſſuredly will not be repeated, it would
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:0063300902:97"/>
be giving it too much importance to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member
it."</p>
            <p>"Well, but what was it Emily? I
dare ſay ſome country joke of our young
biſhop."</p>
            <p>Dandelion replied: "Miſs Emily is ſo
touchy, that ſhe takes fire as eaſily as the
wadding of my gun, or as a little field
of furze. What the deuce can a man do
with his hands more inoffenſively, than to
arrange the tucker of a charming girl?
True, my hand ſlipped; and Miſs Emily
was in ſuch an agitation, that, d<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>e,
ſhe frightened me."</p>
            <p>The eyes of Charles darted fire; they
were fixed on Dandelion. The Reverend
Ephraim moſt probably caught them, for
he bent his head, and employed himſelf
in pulling the ſtraps of his boots. Emily
marked the full direction of Charles's fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid
eyes; ſhe felt an emotion of gratitude
and alarm.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:0063300902:98"/>
"Indeed, is that all?" ſaid Miſs Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion,
bridling, with a look which ſhe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
between the plaintiff and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant,
but which might be diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated,
by an analyzer of a look, into an
inſulting ſneer for Emily, and a jealous
reproach for Ephraim. "I adviſe you,
child, that if ſuch harmleſs freedoms are
to occaſion ſuch violent reſentments, to
hide yourſelf from the figure of a man.
But you have ſeen ſo little of the great
world, that ſuch <hi>gaucheté</hi> of manners
muſt be the conſequence. But I do not
ſee, Mr. Dandelion, what you have to do
with Miſs Emily!"</p>
            <p>"Mr. Dandelion," obſerved Vaurien,
"would do well, when he thruſts his
hands into a roſe-buſh, to take care of
not ſcratching himſelf with the briers.
I wiſh, my good friend, the tucker had
been well armed at all points. You have
had but a bloodleſs victory, and have
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:0063300902:99"/>
taken the outworks without even the apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy
of a ſiege."</p>
            <p>"You country gentlemen," ſaid Sedley,
"are moſt robuſt in your refinements;
you cruſh in your embrace, and your rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
annihilate delicate nerves. 'Tis all
buſſing at a goſſip's chriſtening. I think
you are the only reſpectable part of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity
who perpetuate the venerable kiſſing
of Queen Beſſe's days, or her good father,
whoſe kiſſes, I think, generally concluded
with blows. I believe a woman conceives
a kiſs from a country gentleman full as
dreadful as a tug or a ſhake. You are all
for overflowing bumpers; no matter what
wine! You have done, in the turning of
a lock, what a ſenſitive man would have
taken three years about."</p>
            <p>"D<gap reason="blank" resp="#OXF" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>_…</desc>
               </gap>e," ſaid Dandelion, "you all
ſet me, like a pack in full cry. I am ſure
I am ſorry to have offended Miſs Emily;
but I never yet offended by a little play."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:0063300902:100"/>
"Play, Sir," continued Sedley, "why
it is coming to blows! I fear Miſs Emily
has received ſome marks from your cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelling
arms. I know a friend, Mr. Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delion,
who is a man of ſenſibility and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement,
and who has now paid his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voirs,
to an amiable woman, theſe twelve
years; he never paſſed an evening with her
but in the company of a third perſon; he
admires her muſick, ſhe admires his verſes.
He was ſeven years before he kiſſed her
hand; but to have touched her tucker—Sir, as ſoon would he;—but I'll ſay no
more."</p>
            <p>When the company broke up, Charles
took Dandelion aſide, and ſaid: "Miſs
Emily Balfour I am ſorry to ſee in this
houſe, without a protector. Such, I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
ſhe cannot want long; but, till
ſhe has a protector, we ſhould all of us
conſider it as our indiſpenſable duty to
perform that office. You, however, do not.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="98" facs="tcp:0063300902:101"/>
If you would conſult your own eaſe, I
muſt inſiſt that you never offer to give
pain to that Lady, by a ſingle word, or a
ſingle action."</p>
            <p>"So ho, young ſquire!" whiſtled
Dandelion, "<hi>you</hi> are the protector of
Miſs Emily! Who gave you this
right?"</p>
            <p>"My humanity. I do not mean to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terchange
any converſation. To a perſon
of your character conviction muſt be
brought by other means. Mr. Dandelion,
my father was a clergyman; it is an awful
profeſſion; and he who ſeems aſhamed of
it, has attained a degree of depravity
which I think is quite of a recent date."
So ſaying, he gave a violent ſhake to his
cropt hair and braided tail; for when
our young parſon was in town, his cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical
encircling curl was twiſted into an
elegant tail, ſuſtained by a tortoiſeſhell
comb.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:0063300902:102"/>
"And pray, Sir," calmly demanded
Dandelion, "what can you mean by
this?"</p>
            <p>"Perhaps you may underſtand me bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
now," ſaid Charles, repeating the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
to the utter diſcomfiture of his
faſhionable crop, while the braided tail
hung diſhevelled on his back.</p>
            <p>"I believe you mean to inſult me!"</p>
            <p>"Preciſely ſo. I have now only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted
you; but, mean as you are, the
next time you do not eſcape correction."</p>
            <p>While this ſhort dialogue was paſſing
between Charles and Ephraim, the door
had been left a-jar, and the maid of Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
in paſſing, had been attracted by the
firm tones of Charles. The whole ſcene
was revealed. Through the magnifying
glaſs of her eye ſhe examined every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
and, in a very poetical amplification
of our hero's conciſe proſe, ſhe detailed
the whole to Emily; who, when the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:0063300902:103"/>
deſcription was cloſed, rejoiced to
find that the duel was a bloodleſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter.
Charmed by the modeſt, the
ſenſible, and concealed manner, which
Charles had choſen to protect her, this
action was repaid, by her little heart, with
more than gratitude.</p>
            <p>In this manner Emily paſſed ſix months
in the houſe of Miſs Million, much to
her diſſatisfaction. The refinement of
Sedley was inſidious; the brutality of
Dandelion diſguſted; the intereſt ſhe
took in Vaurien was cenſurable; and the
growing affection ſhe felt for Charles was
imprudent. Miſs Million had now heard
her ſo frequently applauded by every one,
and particularly ſince the attack of the
Reverend Ephraim on the fair boſom of
our heroine, that ſhe began to feel weary
of a girl who carried the whole weight of
attention to her ſide. Her diſpleaſure
gleamed through ſeveral obſcure hints
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:0063300902:104"/>
dropped to Mrs. Betty her waiting-maid,
who blew the gleams into a kitchen flame.
They met a moſt terrible bellows in the
mouth of Mrs. Bully, who, beſides accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations
of Socinianiſm, whiſpered in cloſe
ſecrets, and talked in imperfect ſurmiſes,
that ſhe had made a moſt important de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection
of the looſe morals of Miſs Emily.
This part of her accuſation agitated the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity
of the lower part of the houſe; and
a moſt unfortunate circumſtance, which
then happened, confirmed all the foul ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſations
of the orthodox and benevolent
Mrs. Bully.</p>
            <p>Emily now viewed the altered features
of patronage; ſhe ſaw herſelf the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant
of a mean, an unfeeling, and an
uneducated woman of faſhion. To her
ſenſations every look was reproach, every
expreſſion contempt, and every civility

her vulgar ſentiments in their clear and
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:0063300902:105"/>
appropriate language; but, to the lumi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous
ſenſibility of Emily, the ſordid heart
of Miſs Million lay open; and her ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſoul now ſhivered, in all the varying
ſeaſons of a year of patronage. It was
now ſhe perceived that ſhe had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded
the counſel of her father, in ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her independence from herſelf; ſhe
ſaw her exiſtence in ſorrow or in pleaſure,
as the face of her patroneſs choſe. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely
miſerable, and humiliated in her
own mind, ſhe felt herſelf unprotected,
and knew not wher to find a refuge.</p>

            <p>THE friendſhip of Charles for Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien
had become indiſſoluble. Some
opinions, which the Gaul had at firſt
thrown out, alarmed him; but he conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
them only as thoſe dangerous para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxes,
peculiar to the intemperate philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers
of his country; nor was Charles
a little delighted, by perceiving the energy
of his own eloquence, operating on the
ſuperior intellect of Vaurien, who had
gradually relinquiſhed his own notions,
one by one, and, at preſent, ſeemed only
a mere reflection of the pure and honeſt
Charles. He repoſed on the boſom of this
cheriſhed friend; his virtues daily excited
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:0063300902:107"/>
admiration; and none ſo much as his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary
liberalities, ſince his late remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances
from France, which, as he informed
his friends, he had been ſo fortunate as to
receive. To Vaurien, Charles poured his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret
ſorrows; he touched mournfully on the
diſſipations of Lady Belfield, and lamented
the contempt he hourly received from his
former gentle patroneſs. "As for my Lord,
you acknowledge," ſaid he, "that he is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinately
loſt to reaſon, and an enemy to
that conſtitution which protects his perſon
and his property; which muſt be ſlowly
reformed, not rapidly deſtroyed; united
cloſer, not diſorganiſed. In vain I wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly
yield ſome principles, which I deem
political ſuperſtitions; but, in return, he
yields me not one opinion, however fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtic,
however deſtructive. He and his
party would innovate all things; but my
Lord does not agree with Mr. Subtile,
Mr. Subtile with Mr. Dragon, nor Mr.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:0063300902:108"/>
Sympathy with Dr. Bounce. Philoſophy
has it's prejudices, not leſs pernicious, not
leſs inhuman, than the popular prejudices
of the moſt intolerant people. And at
what aims this philoſophy? In forming a
man without a heart! It is of no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence
to me, whether a perſecuting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion
burns me in an auto-da-fe, or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
a perſecuting philoſophy conducts
me to the guillotine; it is always the
ſame thing for my neck."</p>
            <p>To ſimilar converſations Vaurien had
not only given his approbation, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
his ſurpriſe that a free Briton,
like Charles, ſhould violate his dignity by
the dependence of patronage. "Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude,"
ſaid he, "for the reception ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded
to a foreign wanderer, ſtill kept
him in the houſe of Belfield, but his day
of enfranchiſement ſhould not be far;
and he ſhould rejoice to obſerve Charles
ſpurn his ſplendid, but ignoble chains;"
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:0063300902:109"/>
and for this purpoſe offered a liberal ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
of money. Charles felt grateful, and
only refuſed the offer through delicacy,
obſerving, "that whenever his patrons
ſhould hint at a diſmiſſion, he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice
to accept it." "Tres bien," ſaid
Vaurien, muſing.</p>
            <p>Lady Belfield was exaſperated by the
inſenſibility of Charles; ſhe had exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
her whole artillery, and ſhe in vain
eſſayed to ſoften the human ſtatue into
animation. She now ſuſpected that his
heart was occupied by ſome rival. To her
confidential Vaurien ſhe opened her ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes;
their mutual paſſion had greatly
ſubſided, and, it it's height, it was a love
that knows no jealouſy. Her Ladyſhip
and Vaurien would have mutually aſſiſted
each other in procuring themſelves new
lovers.</p>
            <p>"Indeed," replied Vaurien to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry,
"it is an inſult to your Ladyſhip.
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:0063300902:110"/>
Shall I dare to ſay, you have a rival, in
an abject being?"</p>
            <p>"I deſire, Vaurien," ſaid her Ladyſhip,
reddening, "that you will inform me."</p>
            <p>"I cannot; my indignation would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
ſilence."</p>
            <p>"Senſitive Vaurien! You anticipate
my feelings. I inſiſt on knowing."</p>
            <p>"He is my friend; you muſt grant
me the moſt inviolable ſecreſy. Charles
is unworthy of your regard. Your ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,"
added Vaurien, with a ſneer half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuppreſſed,
"is a low woman, picked
from the ſtreets, and whom he has placed
in a petty ſhop." He gave the addreſs of
Mrs. Wilſon.</p>
            <p>The face of Lady Belfield burned;
her eyes caught fire; and ſhe ſaid, ſcarce
audibly: "Is the wretch ſo low? How
humiliating the villain! His preſence is
a reproach. Vaurien, he ſhall not remain
here."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:0063300902:111"/>
"At this houſe," continued Vaurien,
"Miſs Balfour accidentally hired lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
He has taken me frequently to
this woman's; but the ſweet Emily, for
whom you know I feel a paſſion, a paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
as yet ungratified, knows nothing of
her character."</p>
            <p>"I have told you, Vaurien," replied
her Ladyſhip, "that I have already ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured
that dear girl to reſide with us
ſome time. Receive that innocence with
gentleneſs; ſmile at leaſt on the victim
of my friendſhip and your love. When
ſhe bleeds, let me not hear her cries."</p>
            <p>From this converſation Vaurien haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened
to his Lordſhip. With Belfield
he had for ſome time paſt engaged in
complicate conſpiracies. "This morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
my Lord," he ſaid, "a truſty cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier
has brought me letters from Breſt.
Rowan O'Connor has ſecured Connaught.
We have a garriſon of Defenders in all
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:0063300902:112"/>
the remote towns of Ireland. Surely po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatoes
are inflammable, the Iriſh are ſo
hot. Our party gains at Paris; the Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins
are playing gently now with the
Moderés, but, rely on it, 'tis the young
tyger with his keeper, who attempted to
domeſticate the animal, but when the
tyger knew his ſtrength, he toſſed about
the head of his keeper for his amuſement.
An embarkation for England is prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
the coaſts are lined with men; the
invaſion is at no great diſtance; but your
Lordſhip wants patriotiſm, and this is the
only moment when all the Thames ſhould
roll, like another Pactolus, on ſands of
gold. Money is wanted in Ireland. Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon
holds a correſpondence with almoſt
every town in England; we have all the
idle, the diſcontented, the bankrupts, and
the hot-brained youth of every town;
you ſee our party is formidable. Rant
has become an itinerant orator, and his
ſixpenny eloquence ſcatters more ſedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:0063300902:113"/>
among the lower claſſes than all the
money of your Lordſhip; he is quite
intelligible to them; ranting, roaring,
raving; he draws his metaphors from
the very gutters of the people; and ſo
far, like Virgil, as your Addiſon ſays,
the fellow toſſes his dung about him
with ſome effect."</p>
            <p>His Lordſhip liſtened with intenſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
to this rapid ſketch of the Gaul.
What he barely touched on, his fertile
imagination expanded by anticipation.
Already, on the ruins of London, a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee
of public ſafety ſeemed to ariſe.
"Take all, my dear Vaurien, all I have
to give; but the dilatorineſs of all thoſe
projects, which you deſcribe ſo rapidly,
has left me a ruined man. Mortgage
I cannot more, and for ſwindling I have
not ſufficient credit. If this invaſion of
England fails, where ſhall I fly?"</p>
            <p>"France," replied Vaurien, "will be
proud to enrol the name of Belfield
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:0063300902:114"/>
among it's Engliſh citizens; we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
ſome Britiſh worthies of a kindred
merit. But I can proceed no further if
Charles remains in your houſe. I ſuſpect
he is a miniſterial ſpy."</p>
            <p>"He ſhall have his diſmiſſion," ſaid
his Lordſhip.</p>
            <p>Such were the friendſhips of Vaurien;
yet at the very inſtant he evinced a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
ebullition of ſympathy, which virtue
would have been proud to own. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing
the hall, he obſerved a ſervant lad,
who had retired into a dark corner, and
ſeated on a bench, was weeping and ſob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing.
"What has happened, William?"
enquired Vaurien.—"I have juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a letter, Sir, from my poor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
who tells me my father is dead.
He has been bed-ridden theſe ten years.
His death might have been borne, for
my poor mother could hardly ſupport
herſelf and a helpleſs old man. But we
are both now in ſuch deſpair, I cannot
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:0063300902:115"/>
ſleep at the thoughts; my father will
not have Chriſtian burial; the creditors
inſiſt firſt on being paid; the body is
detained, and heaven only knows where
my father's ſoul reſts; it can never reſt
ſurely if not buried in Chriſtian ground.
Ah! Sir, I remember, that when the
great Methodiſt Surgeon of our village
anatomized the ſtrong man that was
hanged for continually breaking out of
priſon, he felt a qualm of conſcience,
and employed me in the night to dig
a grave in the church-yard, that the
bones might be buried in holy ground;
for he, no doubt, could not anſwer to his
conſcience if they had remained unburied.
If people are not buried in church ground,
what will become of their ſouls? My
mother is diſtracted, and I am afraid to
walk in the night." Vaurien ſmiled at
the artleſs tremors of the lad and his
mother, and quieted their holy horror
by his liberal aſſiſtance.</p>

            <p>SINCE Emily's reſidence in Portman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſquare,
although ſo long a time had
elapſed, Mrs. Wilſon had not yet paid
her a viſit. This ſeparation had been
occaſioned by miſfortune, and not by
neglect. There are ſome beings who
ſeem ſelected by "outrageous Fortune,"
not only to receive the full weight of
her fatal "ſling," but to be stuck round
by her haraſſing and petty "arrows."
Mrs. Wilſon, in iſſuing one day for this
very purpoſe, either that really ſhe had
been ſo cloſely confined at her induſtrious
counter, that ſhe was quite a novice in
the art of walking the crouded ſtreets,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:0063300902:117"/>
or that, accuſtomed to indulge many
profound reveries of ſorrow, ſhe was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
ſeen, than that ſhe herſelf ſaw, ſhe
had hardly cleared the view of her houſe,
when ſhe encountered a porter, who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with
the full weight and the broad expanſion
of a cheſt of tea, was equally oppreſſed as
blinded, yet unfortunately determined, at
the ſame time, to be rapid in his motions;
ſo that the exertion of ſight entirely reſted
on the paſſengers, and not on the porter.
The latter indeed proceeded rapidly, but
ſecurely, for he was in no danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
reverſed; but ruſhing round the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner
of a ſtreet where Mrs. Wilſon had
arrived, at that very nicety of point of
turning when the two future contenders
are perfectly unperceived by each other—in not half a ſecond of time—the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
rounded, and Mrs. Wilſon fell! It
proved no trifling fracture, and ſhe had
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:0063300902:118"/>
hitherto been confined to her houſe.
Emily had more than once called on her,
had ſympathized, and found her more
eſtimable at every interview; yet her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
ſuſpicions had made in indelible
impreſſion on her mind; and prompt as
ſhe was at the tender call of friendſhip,
ſuſpicion made her rather tremble than
enjoy.</p>
            <p>When this poor woman found herſelf
in a ſtate of convaleſcence, ſhe came im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
to her young friend. "I hope,
Miſs Emily," ſhe ſaid, "your ſituation
is agreeable."</p>
            <p>"Alas! Mrs. Wilſon," Emily replied,
"if it is not, I muſt attribute it to my
preſent ſtate of feeling. Every ſcene
takes much, and ſometimes all it's effect,
from our exiſting ideas. I feel, that if
I were in an Elyſium it would appear
gloomy. In the image of my father,
there is yet too much life for me quietly
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:0063300902:119"/>
to remember that it has ceaſed to exiſt,
his minuteſt habits, and his accuſtomed
phraſes, ſtill engage my affections; and
I gaze, on what I cannot view, and I
liſten, to what I cannot hear. To me he
is not dead! and I ſeem to live in the
cruel torments of an abſence I never yet
knew, and cannot teach myſelf to ſuffer.
Conſider, then, my preſent ſituation;
here is nothing but mirth and ſplendour,
and my heart is agitated by a perpetual
conflict of interiour miſery, and exterior
gaiety. But with me the heart will ever
prevail over all it's conſtraints; it will
colour the ſcene I view, will prompt in my
ſorrows the languor of my converſation,
and muſt ill fit me to be the companion of
Miſs Million. Every day I feel I am an
intruder in this great houſe; and yet I
conſider myſelf as it's humbleſt ſervant.
I ſold my freedom when I united myſelf
to it's generous owner. Gratitude takes
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:0063300902:120"/>
from me the power of choice; otherwiſe,
much could I wiſh, my dear Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
that I ſtill occupied the ſmall room
of your ſmall houſe; there I think I
could feel quietneſs, and to me quietneſs
ſeems an enjoyment; I almoſt think it
felicity. My independence would then
ariſe from myſelf; temperance would be
my gratification; uſeful, yet not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing
occupations all my wealth, and
your converſation would conſtitute all
that I wiſh to hear of the world. When
I entered this ſuperb manſion, I unthink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
violated the ſolemn injunction of my
dear father, who, as if he had been aware
of this ſplendid ſlavery, this ſilken chain,
told me only to derive my ſubſiſtence
from myſelf. Ah! if I were but once
more in your little room!—but what do
I ſay? There my father would ſit before
me; every thing in your houſe would
remind me of his preſence. The arm
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:0063300902:121"/>
chair would tell me where he twice
ſwooned, and the bed would for ever
revive his laſt, his affectionate, yet dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
hour! But theſe are fooliſh tears;
the unavailing tears of memory; yet is
their ſweet ſadneſs endeared to the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
they ever relieve me; and when I
have wiped my eyes, my heart feels the
energy of fortitude, and I then ſay, I live
as Heaven chuſes."</p>
            <p>"If you would live with me," replied
Mrs. Wilſon, "I will change my houſe.
On induſtry alone depends all my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs,
and induſtry will make buſineſs
in one ſtreet as well as in another. I
have heard ſome of my neighbours, who
have quitted their firſt ſhops to get into
larger ones, complain, that their preſent
ſtreet is not half ſo <hi>lucky</hi> as their former
one. I have attempted, out of mere be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence,
and not of mere pride, to play
the philoſopher. I have ſhewn them,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:0063300902:122"/>
that in their firſt ſhops, with much leſs
buſineſs, they were much more induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;
and that when ſome people get rich,
it is a chance, that they become again
poor; and really, without ſuſpecting it,
I have purſued a certain notion of Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle's,
which I met the other evening,
that there is no good or ill fortune, but
what ariſes from our own ill or good
conduct; and that to ſay a man is very
unfortunate, is to ſay, that he wants ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,
or wants induſtry. However, I
have made no converts of my good neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours;
and one particularly, who, I fear,
by his expenſive mode of living, and by
the affected education of his daughters,
who, when their father's man is weighing
cheeſe, are employed at delighting his
ears by jarring with a concerto of Haydn,
and who have hung round their ſhop,
among Cheſhire and Wiltſhire cheeſes,
ſome ſelect views of ancient Greece, I ſay
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:0063300902:123"/>
this poor man, who made a reſpectable
fortune in his firſt ſhop by his own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry,
is now convinced, that Great
Ruſſel-ſtreet is one of the unluckieſt
ſtreets in town. But I am flying off in
a tangent when I have ſomething to
communicate, of a ſerious and intereſting
nature.</p>
            <p>"What I now impart muſt, my dear
Miſs Emily, be confided to your ſecret ear.
It is not only your delicacy which I fear
to irritate, but the kindneſs of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maneſt
man, which I tremble to offend.
A devoted friendſhip for two perſons,
whoſe happineſs is dear to me as the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence
of my children, will, if it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
but in the ſmalleſt portion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
with affection, or pardon with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cility,
what my heart has prompted me
to diſcloſe."</p>
            <p>"Why this embarraſſment, Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon?
What ſecret can you have to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:0063300902:124"/>
thus ſolemnly? Can you fear to
unfold, or I to hear, what you ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts
me? The innocent have no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets.
I aſſure you I never had a ſecret
in my life. I have indeed been made ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
with that kind of intelligence,
but I generally found that a ſecret was
only malice in diſguiſe. I muſt freely
ſay, that extorted ſilence I can violate
without any conſcientious yearnings.
Have you a ſecret which you would not
tell me as frankly as any other friend?"</p>
            <p>"Indeed I cannot agree. Yes, I muſt
ſay that innocence may have it's ſecrets,
which it would expire before it would
reveal. Ah! there are ſome delicate ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations,
which, if not fearfully and cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſly
concealed, might wear the moſt
criminal aſpect." Mrs. Wilſon here gave
a ſigh much more profound than au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:0063300902:125"/>
"Well, my dear Mrs. Wilſon," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
Emily, "you muſt know more of
human nature than myſelf. I never could
enter into any man's character but my
father's. All men aſſuredly are not pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued
by the ſame ill fortune; and all,
therefore, may not be as ſelf-ſevere. Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
has he told me, that he never con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
a thought that he was not prompt
to expreſs. Excellent man! There was
a holineſs in his mind. And reſpecting
thoſe critical ſituations to which you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lude,
where innocence takes a criminal
aſpect, he uſed to ſay, ſincerity is wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom.
What to-day we conceal may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear
to-morrow; and the explanation we
avoided will then come too late. We
have got into our uſual moralizing ſtrain,
my dear Mrs. Wilſon; but I am now
quite prepared for your ſecret."</p>
            <p>While Emily was pronouncing her
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:0063300902:126"/>
father's apophthegm on ſincerity, Mrs.
Wilſon reddened, changed her poſture,
and drew out her handkerchief to place
before her eyes. Emily was intent on
her netting. The pointed addreſs ſhe had
made, her innocent heart never ſuſpected.
When Mrs. Wilſon recovered from cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
uncomfortable ſenſations, ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
thus: "You know, Miſs Emily,
that to the ſingular benevolence of Mr.
Charles Hamilton I and my children are
indebted for our daily bread. We ſhould
now be worſe than mendicants; for men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicity
has it's friendſhips; alone in this
metropolis, God denied me one. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered
myſelf as an outcaſt; no relative
to aid me with an aſſuaſive word of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation;
poverty was combined with
deſpair. My ſoul ſickened, my exiſtence
was poignant; more than once my armed
hand was raiſed to my breaſt; but when
my eye has ſought to take a final fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:0063300902:127"/>
of my children, the weapon fell, and
the mother lived!" Here Mrs. Wilſon
burſt into tears, and her thick ſobbings
impeded her voice.</p>
            <p>"Dear Mrs. Wilſon," ſaid Emily in
emotion, "I believe your ſituation was
as ſingular as the benevolence of Mr.
Charles. His modeſty ſtudiouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceals
his merits; but no man who is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly
benevolent can ſo far indulge his
natural diſpoſitions; the voice of grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
will utter the ſecrets of modeſt
philanthropy. He has felt for me here;
I too am his debtor, but it is unknown
to him; he has ſeen me embarraſſed, and
has delicately extricated; he has ſeen me
inſulted, and has ſilently protected. It
would have been generous to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
a female, but to have done this
unknown to all but to her offender has
in it ſomething of the delicacy of thoſe
ſenſitive beings who, in an age of roman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:0063300902:128"/>
generoſity, were only alive to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe
of heroiſm."</p>
            <p>Mrs. Wilſon was now more compoſed;
and this voluntary applauſe beſtowed on
her friend cheered and animated; a ſoft
ſmile brightened her tears, like a ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beam
gilding a watery cloud. She ſaid,
"perhaps, Miſs Emily, you have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
Mr. Charles of late. How exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimate,
how pallid, how melancholy!"</p>
            <p>"He has told me," ſaid Emily, "he
is unwell."</p>
            <p>"Alas!" replied Mrs. Wilſon, "he
thinks he never can be well. Sleepleſs
nights and feveriſh days, if they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
rapidly annihilate the ſource of life,
preſs down it's elaſticity, and wear away
ſlowly but ſurely it's ſprings. Never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect
more to ſee him other than he is;
his malady is in his ſilence, and he will
prefer that ſilence to his health; he pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes
without the little conſolation of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:0063300902:129"/>
ſaying, I periſh; enamoured of his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lady,
he ſmiles in his ſufferings."</p>
            <p>"Explain yourſelf," exclaimed Emily,
earneſtly and tremblingly.</p>
            <p>"I muſt firſt," continued Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
"aſſure you, that Mr. Charles ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times,
in the native ſimplicity of his heart,
confides circumſtances which he would not
expreſsly mention. If my gratitude had
not taught me to ſtudy him minutely, to
catch every variation of his tones, every
expreſſion of his geſtures, every diſtant
combination of a caſual word, I had to
this moment, like others, only perceived
that his health decayed, while the cauſe
would have been mantled over in the
moſt reſolute concealment. Like you,
Miſs Emily, in his reſidence he is unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate.
You alike feel the tortures of
a ſplendid dependence. Similar in your
ſentiments, you are ſimilar in your ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings.
If you mutually look into your
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:0063300902:130"/>
own hearts, you will ſee that of the
other."</p>
            <p>A quick bluſh covered the face of
Emily, warm as the firſt ſuffuſion of an
early paſſion.</p>
            <p>"And now, Miſs Balfour, when I ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
to ſay, that with diffidence, but with
ardour, he loves you, muſt I be cenſured
for unburthening a truth that has long
oppreſſed my heart? Who in this world
are dear to me but my children, and
yourſelf, and Mr. Charles? Reſt only
aſſured, that he knows not of my coming
here, and ſuſpects not that I have diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
the concealed ſource of his infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.
Did I not know him the nobleſt
of men, I ſhould not have addreſſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
now to the moſt amiable of women.
Gratitude would not have exacted my
diſturbance of your repoſe. Pardon me
then, if I have acted erroneouſly; it is
the error of reſpectful affection."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:0063300902:131"/>
Emily pauſed, was diſtreſſed, and ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veled
her net-work. "I know not how
to reply," ſhe ſaid, "my dear Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
I have the higheſt regard for Mr.
Charles. Not to value him would ſhew
myſelf worthleſs. I owe him much. He
is the only friend I have of his ſex. But
when I aſſure you, that I never felt more
than reſpect for the maſculine character,
I ſpeak with my wonted ſincerity. The
paſſion of love has never moleſted my
quiet; I never could love any man but
my father. I loved him becauſe he was
great and unfortunate. But the friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips
of my own ſex form the only ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial
pleaſures I can receive from another.
There is no delicacy, none of the tender
and melting features of nature in man.
If my father had not been my father, even
him I ſhould have thought ſevere. As
for myſelf, I have found ſome relief; La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
Belfield has given me an invitation to
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:0063300902:132"/>
reſide with her during an abſence of Miſs
Million's from town. Believe me when
I ſay, that the friendſhip of her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,
an amiable and accompliſhed wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
yields a careleſs, untempered joy,
a fearleſs happineſs, which the ſeverity
of man can never communicate."</p>
            <p>"Name not Lady Belfield!" cried
Mrs. Wilſon with energy and emotion.
"I muſt not further prolong my viſit;
but, dear Miſs Emily, remember that
Charles Hamilton will be ſilent but muſt
love. I conjure you not to notice to
him, that I have mentioned his name to
you on this delicate diſcovery. Never,
perhaps, would he pardon, and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
would render the life I owe him
loathſome."</p>
            <p>She quitted the fair Emily, and left
her abſorbed in thoſe tender trepida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
of the mind, when with half-reluctant
half-aſſenting emotions the
earlieſt flame of paſſion breaks from
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:0063300902:133"/>
the heart, where it lay concealed and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt,
to diffuſe itſelf over the form, to
ſparkle in the eye, to bloom in the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
to melodize the voice, and to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
the air; while nature, ſeconding the
innocent embarraſſment, bewitches the
lover by calling forth thoſe new-born
charms, more fatal to his repoſe than
thoſe he traced ere his miſtreſs knew her
firſt amorous thought.</p>
            <p>But the ſevere fortune of Charles
doomed that this firſt amorous thought
was never known to him, and, inſtead
of charming, it terrified. The cradle
of Love is wreathed by the Graces, and
the muſic of Hope pours its faſcinating
ſound; but to our hero, Love was nurſed
by the Furies, and the melodies of Hope
were exchanged for the myſterious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches
and the averted face of his
Emily.</p>

            <p>WHEN Mrs. Wilſon had quitted the

the hall, one of the footmen familiarly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed
her, and was on the point of forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
her to an embrace, when violently
burſting from his arms, in an agony of
horror ſhe exclaimed: "And has it come
to this?"—She ruſhed from the door.</p>
            <p>"Body o'me!" cried the footman,
"why the old dame thinks I don't know
her again. She has gone off for all the

Let us follow the miſerable and humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liated
Wilſon! She reached home with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
a perception of having iſſued from the
houſe of Miſs Million. The hall and the
footman were fixed in her imagination;
a repeated geſture ſeemed as if ſhe was
continually ſhrinking from his touch;
ſhe writhed in tortures; her face was now
reddened by the deepeſt ſhame, and ſoon
ſucceeded an aſhy horror over every fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.
As ſoon as ſhe had reached her
houſe ſhe hurried to her chamber, threw
herſelf on the bed, and ſpoke incohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently
in an agony of ſpirits: "Father
of Mercies, is mercy alone denied to me?
Is not an error waſhed away by tears like
mine? No! I had not endured thy final
puniſhment; I ſee there was a degree of
miſery yet reſerved for me, ſharper than
the ſecret ſting that lay in my heart.
When I was a proſtitute, my ſhame was
reſerved for myſelf; there was no friend
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:0063300902:136"/>
to reproach; no perdition to the cheriſhed
feelings of ſocial affection; no one marked
me; I ſinned, no, I only erred, in peace.
Children, children! what have ye not coſt
me! what now will ye coſt me! Shall I
curſe ye? ſhall I abandon ye? Have ye
not extended your mother on the ſloweſt
rack of agony?—Poor children, ye are
innocent, I alone am guilty. Heaven de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees
that the puniſhment ſhall endure
when the crime has paſt. Shall I mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur
to taſte the bitterneſs my own hands
have prepared? Now, wherever I wander,
wherever I fix, 'the finger of ſcorn' will
point at me, a low, a miſerable proſtitute!
A fever ſhakes my frame. Cruel retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection!
I thought myſelf reinſtated in
virtue and comfort—one ſtroke of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
deſtroys my eternal peace! This
footman—The idea is inſupportable!—my ſhame is promulgated—Miſs Emily
muſt at length know me the wretch I am
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:0063300902:137"/>
Wiſe was her father's counſel, that ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity
is wiſdom; what we conceal to-day
may appear to-morrow. Explanation has
come too late! For the bluſh it would
have coſt me, I now muſt give the pang
that ſhall endure with life. She ſurely
addreſſed herſelf to me, to claim the elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidation
of my myſterious hiſtory. O tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture!
I will fly into the country; I will
ſeek ſome chance ſervitude; I will periſh,
and no one ſhall know where the wretched
Wilſon dies.—This then is the ſuſpended
puniſhment of heaven! I taſted bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;
I feed on gall. My children, my
children, if ye periſh, ye cannot reproach
your delirious mother—it is your country,
your God decrees it."</p>
            <p>Leaving this victim of her own error
and of public prejudice we return to the
houſe of Million. As ſoon as the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,
who had more than once known her
in her degrading character, entered the
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:0063300902:138"/>
ſervants' hall, he informed the coachman,
that the dame of Holborn-hill had juſt
paſſed from the apartment of Emily, and
that ſhe flung out as proud as if ſhe had
been a modeſt woman. The coachman
related the circumſtance to his very good
friend the cook, without "extenuating
or ſetting down aught in malice." In
theſe caſes the imaginations of men are
not apt to prove ſo fertile as thoſe of the
women, for reaſons known aſſuredly to
an obſerver of human nature. The cook
embelliſhed it, the chamber-maid refined
it, while Mrs. Bully gave it the beginning,
the middle, and the end, ſo ſeverely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted
by the great Ariſtotle in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition
of an epic. And here we muſt
obſerve, that <hi>lying</hi> is the <hi>eloquence</hi> of the
vulgar. To affect and perſuade the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
paſſions requires a forcible emotion
of the ſoul; for a gentle emotion, like the
flat uniformity of a ſleeping ſea, cannot
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:0063300902:139"/>
pleaſe long. We muſt ſtorm the mind.
Poets and orators will therefore beſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
in taking poſſeſſion of the attention
of their readers and auditors, becauſe they
alike are ſkilful in <hi>amplification,</hi> which, in
truth, is nothing but <hi>lying.</hi> An <hi>exact</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation
would not affect; we ſhould
not long read a poem, or liſten to an ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which had nothing but the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city
of truth. Of this the vulgar are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible,
although the cauſe is concealed.
There are no greater liars than the vulgar,
for experience has taught them the uti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity
of lying; they employ augmentatives
or diminutives, as they deſire to excite
a correſpondent feeling; and the vulgar
are, without knowing it, great poets and
orators.</p>
            <p>The cook mentioned, that a vile ſtrum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet,
known to John and Miſs Emily, had
juſt gone out; the chamber-maid, that
Miſs Emily and John were acquainted
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:0063300902:140"/>
with all the ſtrumpets in town; and Mrs.
Bully hurried to Mr. Million, to aſſure
him, that it was now high time to ſpeak
out; that Miſs Emily was only fit com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
for women of the town, and was
concerned with John; that ſhe herſelf
had ſeen in her poſſeſſion an abominable
book, and was beſides a profeſſed Arian.</p>
            <p>"Well, well, 'tis juſt what I thought!"
exclaimed Mr. Million. "Taking the
Lord knows who into the houſe of a bank
director, becauſe ſhe was an old blind
lieutenant's daughter. I ſhall have all
the daughters of the old knights of Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor.
Curſe her harp, twanging in my ears,
that makes me as melancholy ſometimes
as a fall of ſtocks." He haſtened to
Miſs Million, who certainly was ſingularly
ſhocked with the intelligence, conſidering
that ſhe already had heard it from Betty
two hours before, and was then quietly
doſing over the laſt new novel.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="138" facs="tcp:0063300902:141"/>
"My dear father," cried Miſs Million,
"I am all of a tremor; my poor nerves!
'tis ſhameful! not fit to be told! Pray
call in John, accuſe him before me, let
me hear all that has paſt. It will be in
the papers to-morrow; if Mr. Libel ſhould
hear it, Million-houſe will be ſcandalized.
A footman!"</p>
            <p>John being ſummoned, related his ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
ſtory; and reduced the epical lye of
Mrs. Bully to a mere aſſurance, that
the perſon who had iſſued from Miſs
Emily's apartment was a common proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute.</p>
            <p>Miſs Million being now alone, ſent in
for Emily, and began thus: "Miſs, when
I ſuffered you to make Portman-ſquare
your aſylum, it was from my benevolence."
Emily trembled. "But you have abuſed
my goodneſs, and inſtead of the girl you
was at Exmouth, I find you are the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciate
of a low proſtitute."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="139" facs="tcp:0063300902:142"/>
Emily, pale and alarmed, cried, "Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens!
what do you mean? Tell me, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech
you, quickly!"</p>
            <p>"Your alarm and your tremor are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely
adroit. Performed to admiration!
Why, one would think, to look at you,
you really trembled! But 'tis the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion
of your friend. One might ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine
that you did not know who was
the perſon who called on you this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
            <p>"Her name is Wilſon; ſhe let lodgings
to my father."</p>
            <p>"I dare ſay ſhe lets lodgings. She is
well known in this family; a very <hi>chere
amie</hi> of John's. You will have the kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
to quit Million-houſe as early as you
can. I need not recommend you a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."
So ſaying, ſhe hummed a tender
opera air, and left Emily in the parlour,
motionleſs and ſilent.</p>
            <p>At length ſenſation revived to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciouſneſs.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:0063300902:143"/>
She now relieved her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
heart in one of thoſe little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologues
her innocence had rendered ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual.</p>
            <p>"Then are my father's ſuſpicions veri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied!
All that he ſaid, how ſevere! how
true! What confidence can we beſtow on
our aſſociates! Friendſhip, how thy name
is abuſed! Simplicity, how thy air is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micked!
This wicked woman—Charles
too—They muſt be united! She is em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed
by him for the purpoſe of ſeduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
me! Every myſtery is now revealed.
He was frequently quoting Thomſon's
"boundleſs confidence of ſoul;"—ſo too
did the licentious Sedley! She was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing
to part with me at firſt; ſhe now
offers me a refuge in her houſe; ſhe would
even change her reſidence to receive me!
This day ſhe told me that Charles loved
me!—Hypocrite, how have I eſcaped your
toils? And Charles too, refined diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bler!
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:0063300902:144"/>
Does he deceive me, whoſe image
my fancy cheriſhed next to my father's?
He protected me from Dandelion—I
thought it generous; I find it mean—He would reſerve me for his prey! Oh
Emily, poor deſerted girl! I feel now as
if the whole earth had conſpired againſt
me. Where ſhall I fly?"</p>
            <p>"To theſe arms!" exclaimed Vaurien,
as he entered the parlour, throwing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
at her feet. "Your face, Miſs Emily,
is covered with tears. Refuſe me not the
conſolation of uniting mine. Not a tear
on your face but melts on my heart.
Tell me your diſtreſſes, accept my little
aid. I have heard ſome abrupt effuſions
of ſorrow; I cannot live and forget them."</p>
            <p>Emily, confuſed, heſitating, and deeply
ſobbing, had loſt her voice. Her fine
auburn treſſes fell in diſorder on her face
and her neck; ſhe raiſed two dewy eyes to
heaven; the tears fell, and glittered on her
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:0063300902:145"/>
hair; ſhe looked a Magdalen of Guido.
Vaurien, with gentleneſs placed her in a
chair; he knelt, took her hand, imprinted
a fervid kiſs; ſhe had not even the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of mind to reſiſt, or to perceive his
improper attitude. The image of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
was before her; ſhe gazed in a ſilent
agony of imagination; her tears were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed;
Vaurien was emboldened by her
inſenſibility.—At this inſtant Charles
ſlung open the door—He uttered an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible
ejaculation. Emily ſtarted. "Where
am I?" ſhe cried. "Is it you, Sir?"
and ſhe darted a glance of anger and
horror.</p>
            <p>"Think 'tis no one!" replied Charles
quickly, and hurried from the room.</p>
            <p>"Deceiver!" murmured Emily. She
covered her face with her hands, and ſat
abſorbed in grief. Vaurien compoſed his
attitude, and ſtood near her chair. Such
was the confuſion of Emily's mind, that
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:0063300902:146"/>
few traces of what had occurred left their
impreſſions on her recollection. The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance
of Charles had revived her anger
and her fear. When ſhe turned her eyes
on Vaurien, ſhe looked with kindneſs; ſhe
conſidered that his preſence had proved
her protection.</p>
            <p>Vaurien caught the inſtant change.
"Do me the honour, Miſs Balfour, of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
my aſſiſtance. What occaſions this
great diſtreſs?"</p>
            <p>"You ſee before you the moſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable
of her ſex. A woman without a
friend."</p>
            <p>"Say not ſo, adorable Miſs Emily;
whoever knows you muſt be your friend;
and if a ſofter name would not offend,
there is who would only live to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve
it."</p>
            <p>"Alas! Sir, you mean not to irritate
a ſpirit already wounded. I have hung
ever the verge of deſtruction, blindly,
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:0063300902:147"/>
feebly, yet boldly. O were my father liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing!
Angel in heaven! art thou inſenſible
to the voice of thy daughter? On earth
thou didſt open to her the volume of
her fate; and now can thy paternal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs
not reach thy miſerable wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer?"</p>
            <p>"Dear Miſs Emily, your imagination
is diſturbed. Calm the vehemence of feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
inform, but do not agitate me."</p>
            <p>"Mr. Vaurien, you perhaps can inform
me. You know where I lodged with my
father. The woman ſays, it is to you and
Mr. Charles ſhe owes her exiſtence."</p>
            <p>"Ah! Miſs Emily," replied Vaurien,
turning aſide his head, "'tis a delicate
ſubject; let your ſilence ſpare my feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings."</p>
            <p>"Nay, dear Sir, I muſt ſay more, much
more. You muſt tell me all if you would
be my friend. Miſs Million has this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

            <p>
               <pb n="145" facs="tcp:0063300902:148"/>
"Is a low proſtitute."—Vaurien ſpared
her the words.</p>
            <p>"And you, Sir, have protected her?"
ſaid Emily, quickly.</p>
            <p>"She is the friend of Charles," conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued
Vaurien; "I knew nothing of her.
Common charity makes no diſtinctions
among it's firſt claimants; I prefer aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
the worthleſs, rather than to chill the
warmth of my heart by enquiries, which
may delay too late the ſuccour due to the
worthy."</p>
            <p>"Generous man! And is it then true?
I know nothing of human nature. I
thought her a ſuffering angel."</p>
            <p>"Native goodneſs! I repeat, ſhe is an

I will never more enter that houſe: but
ſurely they have not moleſted your tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity?"</p>
            <p>"O much, much!" cried Emily. "O

There is a refinement in depravity.

            <p>"Truſt me!"ſaid Vaurien, "Lady

            <p>VAURIEN, when he met Charles
on his return, rallied him for his
abrupt departure from Emily. "She is
a finiſhed coquette," ſaid he, "when
you are preſent, but alone ſhe is one of

and contracted diſcernment, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
the Gaul to be the favoured lover,
and ſuſpected the purity of Emily.</p>
            <p>"Ah! my friend," he cried, "would
I were but baniſhed from this houſe!
Patiently I cannot ſuffer one whom I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
as an angel to become before my

eyes an aſſociate for Lady Belfield. To
view her will be hourly to revive regrets,
which, ſuppreſſed by abſence, may ſlowly
die away. Exiſtence becomes a torture
in her preſence."</p>
            <p>"<hi>Tres bien!</hi>" ſaid Vaurien, muſing.</p>
            <p>In the mean while Lady Belfield had
made exact enquiries relative to Mrs.
Wilſon; nor did Johnſon, the old friend
of Charles, heſitate to give into her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip's
idea of the entire tranſaction, ſo
prone are the beſt men to decide by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances.
His Lordſhip had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
prepared to unite with Lady Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's
meaſures; and a few days after
the above converſation with Vaurien,
Charles found on his table a note from
her Ladyſhip, in her own hand-writing,
containing a final diſmiſſion. Her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
laid conſiderable ſtreſs on his offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
and degrading connections.—"Mrs.
Wilſon," cried Charles, "will herſelf
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:0063300902:153"/>
vindicate this undeſerved obloquy."—At
this moment the following letter was
brought from this unfortunate wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man:—</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
               <body>
                  <opener>
                     <salute>My dear Sir,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>Scarcely can my ſcattered thoughts
collect to addreſs you. I have ſettled
my affairs. The ſum you ſo benevolently
aſſiſted me with will accompany this.
I have taken my departure. I fly I
know not whither.</p>
                  <p>I forget to acquaint you with the
diſtreſſing circumſtance that involves my
ruin. The hateful character in which
once I rather erred than ſinned, carries
it's puniſhment when the crime has long
ceaſed. No human benevolence can
now efface from my heart the indelible
degradation. I have mentioned to you,
that to Miſs Emily I revealed all my
hiſtory, excepting that humiliating pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:0063300902:154"/>
when your hand, prompted alone
by charity, ſnatched me from ſo many
nightly horrors. Yes, I concealed this
hideous feature of my life. Could Miſs
Emily have embraced a proſtitute? And
yet from this ſmall failure of ſincerity
I derive this agony of mind, which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taches
the miſery of turpitude and ſhame
while I can think.</p>
                  <p>I waited on her (will you forgive
me?) to reveal your ſtate of mind, which
you do not even ſuſpect I know; but
could I ſee you periſh in ſilence? Yes,
Sir, the eye of gratitude ſecretly ſtudied
your every geſture, your every inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
idea, your every evaneſcent aſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;
gratitude watched and divined
your heart. Emily has traced you in
ſome concealed offices of kindneſs; her
voice told her gratitude, her bluſhes her
love.</p>
                  <p>* * * * * * * * *</p>

It is at intervals I write—I was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognized
by a ſervant—My face glows,
my hand trembles, my tongue is parched,
a fever preys on my vitals. Others will
tell you of my ſhame. Heaven has ſet it's
mark on my face, and I wander a female
Cain. A terrible thought flies and returns
to my imagination—Shall a mother be a
murderer? An inſtant would make my
children angels. Yes, fearleſsly could I
raiſe to the Father of all Mercies an arm
of blood; the blood of my children would
to my God tell not of the cruelty, but
of the chaſtiſement and the contrition of
their mother!</p>
                  <p>* * * * * * * * *</p>
                  <p>It was but phrenſy! the agony of
thought which o'erleaps all bounds. When
the heart is exhauſted, the feelings are
quiet. I have juſt preſſed the dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
to my boſom; heaven ſurely directed
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:0063300902:156"/>
every intendering look, every winding
embrace. The eye of infancy, the kiſs
of childhood, can compoſe the perturbed
heart of maternal deſpair. How won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous
and how ſecret are the impulſes of
nature! In the exiſtence I loath, I feel an
enjoyment in when I ſeem to live for them.
My heart, worn with age and ſorrow, beats
then warm with youth and pleaſure.—I fly from London—Ah! ſhould I be
found periſhing, think of the ſurvivors!
With their mother's crimes they ſtand
unconnected; they are the children of
virtuous parents; for I was a virtuous
wife, although a criminal mother. Fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,
generous youth! Ever ſhall I be as
grateful as I muſt be miſerable,</p>

            <p>"Moſt unfortunate of her ſex!" cried
Charles, "her life points a moral. It is
a leſſon for the times. A dereliction from
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:0063300902:157"/>
chaſtity is puniſhed with exceſſive ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity,
and unjuſt puniſhments produce real
crimes. Woman muſt reſiſt the combined
attacks of love; that paſſion, which our
modes of education and our manners
have taught her to think is the important
occupation of life; but the negligence of
a parent, an accidental occurrence, an
unſuſpicious moment, a wandering of
ſenſibility, a refined intrigue, the certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of confidence, and the fondneſs of
affection, overpower or inveigle that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
ſentiment, which otherwiſe would have
perſevered in it's habitual duties. Woman
requires, therefore, a more energetic for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
than even man; but fortitude is
maſculine; and a female ſtands unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected
amidſt the illuſions of her heart.
But when the hateful life of proſtitution
is derived merely from the indigence and
deſpair of virtue, it is ſtill chaſtiſed with
the ſame torture; the domeſtic porch of
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:0063300902:158"/>
Peace is for ever cloſed. Such unhappy
wanderers are inured to viciouſneſs by our
barbarous and unrelenting accuſations.
A wiſe and philoſophical regulation of the
illuſtrious Frederick prohibited, under ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere
penalties, the aſperſion of that female
who had returned to the arms of her
friends, and to the renewal of thoſe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
virtues which ſhe had ſuſpended
rather than deſerted. How long will phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanthropy
tranquilly gaze on a vaſt multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude
of females periſhing in youth!</p>
            <p>"Poor Wilſon, thou art no criminal!—and yet thou wert a proſtitute. Child
of ſenſibility! thy heart would burſt at
the accuſation; thou didſt ruſh in the
darkneſs of the night to feed thy periſhing
children—Thou could'ſt not have been
a proſtitute in the blaze of day! And I,
who would not ſuffer a widow and her
children to periſh in the ſtreets, am now
involved in her apparent criminality.
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:0063300902:159"/>
Johnſon cenſured me for having formed
diſgraceful connections; and to her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
I can now no more refer this unhappy
fugitive. He who aids unfortunate vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue
(for this woman is moſt virtuous) po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular
prejudice decrees as a participator
in a libertiniſm he abhors!</p>
            <p>"And Emily then knows my paſſion;
and has ſo long deceived Mrs. Wilſon?—The flower that is covered with the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin
dews of innocence can then conceal a
young and foul ſerpent! Yes, her I have
ſeen; Vaurien, I have heard; her infu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riate
glance ſhivered my frame. Yet can
I never forget her. I loved her when I
thought her virtuous; and I now muſt
mourn her, as if a ſudden death had
deprived me of her whom I loved.
The pleaſures of life are not for me;
I will ſit by the ſide of their tomb,
and think of the departed happineſs it
holds."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="157" facs="tcp:0063300902:160"/>
He now framed a reſpectful reply to
Lady Belfield, related the nature of his
connection with Mrs. Wilſon, and lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
that her abrupt flight muſt render his
conduct myſterious. When he quitted
the houſe, Vaurien converſed with him
in a tenderneſs of tone, that ſeemed as
if he were ſhedding tears, and he inſiſted
on his accepting a liberal loan to aſſiſt
him in his purſuits.</p>
            <p>Old friendſhips, that have been inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted
rather through inattention than
pride, are in adverſity viewed by an eye
that, clouded with a tear, gives a peculiar
tenderneſs to the object on which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts.
Charles flew to Johnſon, and
poured in his honeſt ear the change of
his fortunes. Johnſon repeated his old
obſervation on the danger of bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections:
"However," he continued,
"truſt me, that Lady Belfield has ſome
concealed reaſon for this diſmiſſion; ſhe
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:0063300902:161"/>
cannot conſcientiouſly object to any form
of intrigue. I reſpect your ſilence; but
it inſtructs me. And what now think you
of your friend Vaurien?"</p>
            <p>Charles replied, "He is the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging
of men, and the moſt tender of
friends. My honourable connections would
have ſet me afloat on the wide ſea of life
without maſt or rudder. The prompt
kindneſs of Vaurien ſupplies the ungen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleneſs
of Fortune; he has voluntarily
lent me a conſiderable ſum of money,
which I refuſed but for his acceptance of
my bond."</p>
            <p>"So then," obſerved Johnſon, "after
inſtilling in you an abhorrence for your
dependance on Lord Belfield, the adroit
Gaul has induced you to depend ſolely
on his generoſity."</p>
            <p>Charles with warmth replied: "You
ever condemn in Vaurien thoſe actions
which you would praiſe in another."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="159" facs="tcp:0063300902:162"/>
"Yes, I have learnt, young friend,
that virtue is not always implied by
actions of virtue. Does that ſound para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxical?
I muſt even ſay, that the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal
is often virtuous; for as a vicious
character may think proper to perform the
duties of virtue, ſo may the virtuous cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter
be preſſed into the commiſſion of
crimes it abhors, but it cannot ſhun."</p>
            <p>"And there," exclaimed Charles, "you
have deſcribed Mrs. Wilſon."</p>
            <p>Charles now communicated his diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions
to adopt ſome literary avocation;
and ſoliciting Johnſon's opinion, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied
as follows:</p>
            <p>"If you deſire to be diſtinguiſhed as
a genius of the firſt claſs, in ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable
province of literature, whatever
may be your parts and abilities, you are
too poor, at leaſt by ſeveral hundreds
a year. A finiſhed genius, in this age,
is the labour of half a century; a writer
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:0063300902:163"/>
now blooms at forty, and flowers at ſixty.
We require, in this age of taſte, ſuch
hewings, and ſuch poliſhings, ſo much of
the axe, and ſo much of the file, and ſo
much fillagree work, that I conſider no
writer out of leading ſtrings before thirty,
ſuppoſing that then he has been care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully
ſwaddled, nurtured with the moſt
delicate pap, and eternally humoured in
what relates to place, connections, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
habits, coincidences, accidents, and
a crowd of ceteras, which you will find
numbered, one by one, in Helvetius.
I ſee clearly now, that we ſhall have no
more any men of genius; for after all
theſe pains, in which I am ſure no mortal
muſt expect to be ſucceſsful, the moſt
inconſiderable accident or omiſſion may
ſpoil the whole man of genius, as poor
Triſtram was ruined by the want only of
a window-pulley.</p>
            <p>"Our great authors write little, and
write rarely, and exhibit nothing of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:0063300902:164"/>
but in their compoſitions. I have
been in company with two of our fineſt
poets, four of our great hiſtorians, a dozen
of our fanciful noveliſts, and they were as
ſolemn and as dull as a court of aldermen
when there is no buſineſs to tranſact.
The fire of genius has become quite of a
culinary nature; an immenſe fire, raiſed
for the moment, for the preparation of
ſome delicious repaſt, but when that is
performed, the ſaving houſewife ſcrews
up the ſides, takes out the coals, and
leaves it in an ordinary dimenſion.</p>
            <p>"You may acquire, however, a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence
in literature if you are tolerably
ingenious. I confide a ſecret; the man
you ſee before you has obtained money
by his literary performances, as if he were
the firſt genius of the age."</p>
            <p>"You ſurpriſe. I only knew the name
of one Johnſon on the roll of modern
ſame."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="162" facs="tcp:0063300902:165"/>
"It ſhall not be my fault," replied
Johnſon, "if you ever ſee another. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral
literary men of the day have ſold
their works by a miſtake of the public
concerning <hi>names.</hi> But I have ſome ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty,
and more delicacy. I am a name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
writer, but my productions have
names. My occupation is to adjuſt, to
arrange, to reſcind, and to ramify. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body
brings me a ſolid glutinous drop,
and my pen becomes diluent. I am fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
with the raw materials, and then
I weave ſilk, cotton, or worſted, at the
order of my employer. I lardoon mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs.
Sir, I am the writer (which you
ſee is no ſynonime of author) of a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary.
I have written Travels into Ruſſia,
Tours into Scotland, Embaſſies to China,
an Earl's Philoſophical Eſſays, a Baronet's
Economical Reſearches, a Doctor's Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory,
and a Counſellor's Reports. I am
the venerable parent of a dozen as chop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:0063300902:166"/>
literary boys as walk this town. You
know this is an age of authors, and you
perceive one of the reaſons. 'Tis juſt my
employers, whoſe heads may be as bald as
Caeſar's, ſhould wear their laurels or their
literary falſe hair; for as the epigram ſays,
'they ſwear it is their own hair';—and
ſo it is, for I know where they bought it.
You were ſurpriſed the other evening,
that Sir Alexander appeared to forget in
converſation the principles of his own
book; but I aſſure you, Sir Alexander
never read his own book. The origin of
this occupation (not ſo ſingular as it
ſeems) was owing to this circumſtance;
I was a writer in a Review, and whenever
I examined a work, compoſed by a <hi>gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
I made moſt alarming ſtrictures on
the neceſſity of a knowledge of philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
grammar, which no <hi>gentleman</hi> can be
ſuppoſed to know, and I recommended an
application to ſome man of letters, who
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:0063300902:167"/>
might be no gentleman, yet a philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
grammarian. No one comprehended
what I meant by the words philoſophical
grammar; but they were formidable, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing,
and alarming. Every month I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated
the urgent neceſſity of philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
grammar; gentlemen were frightened,
applied to the printer, who gave my ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs,
and ſince that time I have been a
philoſophical grammarian, and having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
employment, not a word now ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
concerning the neceſſity of philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phical
grammar."</p>
            <p>Charles now placed himſelf under the
eye of this ſecret artiſan of literary works,
and perceived, that where invention and
imagination are not required, an author
writes on in ſunſhine and in rain, in gaiety
and in ſadneſs, and with a mechanical pen
forms a mechanical book.</p>

            <p>AMONG the characters ſelected by
Vaurien, as perſons whoſe talents
and diſpoſitions ſeemed adapted to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aleſce
with his general views, by ſome
peculiar bias of their own, was an ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal
enthuſiaſt, who in this hiſtory we
ſhall denominate the Platoniſt.</p>
            <p>He reſided in a romantic part of Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,
and had now arrived in town to
attend the progreſs of a great work on
polytheiſm. He accounted it as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour
of the gods to have been enabled
to ſubſiſt in that cheap country. There
he found a pictureſque landſcape, ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding
a cottage retaining an antique
aſpect. It was indeed formed from the
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:0063300902:169"/>
ſmall remains of an abbey; and what is
ſuppoſed to have been a watch-tower,
ſtill ſtands at the extremity of his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den,
and there he placed his library.
There, abſtracted from all things and all
men, he reads Plato and Homer, and
views nothing but the ſkies.</p>
            <p>His cottage is at the entrance of a
deep foreſt, and the windows command
a view of the high road, a circumſtance
that occaſions him much anxiety; and
he wiſhes that the cottage could only
have been viewed by the gods. His life
is ſolitary, but moſt poetical; yet we
can hardly deem that a ſolitude which is
graced by the ſociety of a beauty, ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantic,
ſenſitive, and happy. He has a
ſet of very ſingular companions; a great
variety of animals and birds. His morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings
are conſecrated in the watch-tower
to Homer and Plato; the afternoons he
gives to what he calls a converſation with
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:0063300902:170"/>
his mute friends; in the evening he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
in the foreſt, explaining Plato to
his lovely companion, and concludes the
night with a hearty ſupper, and with
the undiſturbed rapture that flows from
a heart that beats in uniſon with his
own.</p>
            <p>At ſchool he formed this devotion for
Homer, and a pedant inſpired a poet.
It was owing to the accidental literary
bigotry of his maſter, and his inceſſant
reverence of that poet, which was not
prompted by the ardour of taſte, but
by the frenzy of verbal criticiſm. The
buſt of Homer was placed over his chim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney-piece,
the head of Homer was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graven
on his ſeal, and in his hours of
ſadneſs he conſoled himſelf with an Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical
verſe, and in his hours of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment
he toaſted the old Meonian, by
pouring a generous libation to his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory.
The infatuation of the maſter
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:0063300902:171"/>
was communicated to the ſcholar; but
the impreſſions were of a more delicate
and ſublime nature. In one it was the
impotent extravagance of a frigid verbal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt;
but in the other it became a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchery
of ſenſibility, breaking from a
moſt inflammable and abſtruſe imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He had unfortunately plunged
deeply into the commentaries of certain
Platoniſts, who explain Homer into alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories,
diſcover celeſtial ſyſtems, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert
the Iliad into a Greek Bible of the
arcana of nature.</p>
            <p>When he quitted the ſchool, his mind
was deeply tinctured by all the colori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications
of the Platonic priſm. He
muſed on the bewitching notion of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
beauty, which pervades that enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtic
philoſophy; but when at length
he obtained a complete copy of Plato's
works, the intellectual malady diffuſed
itſelf in every nerve of his mind; and
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:0063300902:172"/>
ſuch was the conflict of his animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits,
that he could never read Plato with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
violent palpitations of the heart, and
more than once ſuch has been the agony
of his ſenſibility, that he fainted over the
volume as he held it with a kind of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
tremor. Theſe indeed are the peculiar
features of enthuſiaſm, that abſtraction of
the imagination which roves amidſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known
ſcenes, and gazes on poetical chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meras.
It is felt by poets in the fury of
their orgaſm, by philoſophers in the ideal
fabrication of their ſyſtems, and by myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics
in their attempts to abſtract them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
from earth to heaven.</p>
            <p>When we read the diſcoveries of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
we acquire a ſpirit of diſcovery.
The imitative genius of man becomes
every thing to which it is accuſtomed.
He read of a thouſand fine meanings in
Plato and Homer, which he could never
have imagined, but having once ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:0063300902:173"/>
them, he added a thouſand more of
his own. A mind like his only requires
the ſcattering of a ſmall handful of ſeed to
cover it's extenſive and fertile ſoil with a
vaſt effloreſcence; and like that happy
climate that feels not the rigour of a
changing ſeaſon, his mind was a year of
one continued ſummer. Every day brought
it's new diſcovery, and every day was a
day of triumph.</p>
            <p>Like other inſpired perſons (for he
conſidered his delight as inſpiration) he
now conceived it a duty to enlighten a
dark and erring world. "All Europe,"
he cried "is ſurrounded by a diſmal
night; hence men are continually mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſting
each other, and one man only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes
another while he himſelf is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded."
He obſerved old religions de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caying,
while modern ſects were filthily
ſpawned forth, and lamely crawled from
each antiquated and expiring monſter.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:0063300902:174"/>
He firſt communicated his notions to a
private circle; ſome conſidered them as
the curioſities of a ſtudent of great learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
ſome as the philoſophical amuſements
and paradoxical vanities of a man of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,
but few diſcerned that they were
the deluſions of a literary lunacy. Their
doubts ſoon ceaſed, when, to the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
even of the learned world in this
cloſe of the eighteenth century, were
publiſhed two quarto volumes, in which
he avowed himſelf a Platoniſt in it's
moſt religious ſenſe, and in which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected
to prove, that the Chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
was merely a baſtardized and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barized
Platoniſm. The divinities of
Plato were the divinities to be adored;
and he affirmed, that no people could be
virtuous and happy if they were not
taught to call God, Jupiter; the Virgin,
Venus; and Chriſt, Cupid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:0063300902:175"/>
It was now in vain to diſſemble. His
friends attempted to reaſon; but logic
reforms no enthuſiaſt. An enthuſiaſt
cannot fail to gain his cauſe, becauſe he
alone can be his own judge. In vain the
world oppoſed, and worſe than oppoſed,
neglected. He was an Atals for himſelf;
the ſolitary ſupporter of a ſyſtem even
too unreaſonable to be adopted by phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
reaſoners, and even too delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
to delight philoſophical fanciers.
He knew, he ſaid, he was the Gemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus
Pletho of the age, and he was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.
To the oppoſing world he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
oppoſed Plato and Homer; and he
looked not in this barbarous age to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded
with a garland in the ſchool of
philoſophy.</p>
            <p>He ſaw himſelf deſerted, but forgave
the unkindneſs of men, becauſe he found
himſelf conſoled, and indeed fully occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied,
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:0063300902:176"/>
by the humanity which he had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
in other animals. Even this was
myſterious, for he darkly hinted that he
was not a little verſed in the language of
beaſts. He lodged in his houſe a moſt
numerous ſociety; on the ſtairs, in his
ſtudy, from the garrets to the cellars, and
even to the very roofs, were aſſembled a
numerous retinue of the mute citizens of
the world, and he was obſerved to paſs
entire days in a very large aviary of
birds.</p>
            <p>The Platonic ſyſtem had obtained him
ſome admirers among the fair ſex. It
was not ill adapted to their capacity;
for being incomprehenſible, it's myſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs
irritated female curioſity, and it
was at leaſt more ſublime than diſcloſing
an enigma, or unfolding a charade. It
was pregnant with the diſſolving ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies
of a delicious ſentiment; for what
the Platoniſt terms "the ſcience of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſals,"
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:0063300902:177"/>
is made to conſiſt in "UNI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERSAL
BEAUTY." It was a homage
to the ſex. He uſed ſometimes to break
out in expreſſions like theſe: "Beauty
walks ſilently on the extremities of it's
feet, alluring, raviſhing, and raiſing all
things by it's power; it ſwims above the
light of forms; it covers the occult union
of the gods!" The entire ſyſtem was
elegant and brilliant; it exhibited only
forms of ſymmetry and grace; and the
female attention, that was once allured
by the ideal perfection of an eternal
beauty (the image exiſting in the mind
of the divine architect) and became ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated
into the Platonic doctrine of ideas,
was ſoon entangled in a tiſſued net of
ſilk and ſilver, that adorned rather than
perplexed the lovely captive. Where
ſhe ſought a maſter, ſhe found a lover;
and, entranced, liſtened to the eloquence
of diction, the dazzling of metaphors,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:0063300902:178"/>
the inexhauſtible poetry, and the infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious
enthuſiaſm of a man who came
recommended by many accompliſhments
of perſonal figure, and by many grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
acquirements. The Platoniſt is a
maſterly muſician, a ſublime poet, and,
when warmed, his voice is melodious,
his eye is illuminated by quick intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
his face takes all the changes of
his ſoul, every geſture is adapted to every
ſentiment, and, like the Cumean Sybil,
he looks the image of inſpiration. His
uſual ſtyle on theſe ſubjects ſhews all
the art of poetry without it's labour;
he pours forth an opulence of diction,
and his copious periods roll with mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence,
as if he were reading an Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh
imitation of Cicero's manner; with
felicitous expreſſion he intenders by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetic
ſentiment, and charms by the
gaiety of exuberant imagery. Even his
myſtic unintelligibility becomes a grace;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:0063300902:179"/>
it ſerves as a reſting-place to repoſe the
mind that has followed him in his ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations;
and they who are not void of
imagination lament when the Platoniſt
cloſes his voluble and enchanting elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</p>
            <p>He had long ſighed to unite himſelf
to a beautiful female, on whoſe boſom
he might meditate in rapture and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verie.
Solitude, deprived of ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion,
preſented nothing to his ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
ſoul but a deſolation of the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.
The beaſts and birds, with all his
vaunted knowledge of their language, he
confeſſed were not equivalent to the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
of this ineſtimable aſſociate. Among
men he could find no companions; for
ſuch was the extreme irritation of his
ſenſations, that his mind had refined it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to a feminine delicacy; it was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palled
by ſerious expoſtulation, and
ſhrunk in horror from coarſe merriment.
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:0063300902:180"/>
In explaining the principle of beauty he
found conſolers and admirers among the
women; but he diſcovered no female
whom he could ſelect from all the world;
for to a congenial diſpoſition and a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
beauty of perſon he required what is
ſtill more rare, an intimate knowledge of
Greek.</p>
            <p>Except a total ignorance of Greek,
Charlotte Fenton was the nymph of his
ſoul. Nature had caſt them in the ſame
mould; but a diverſity of education had
provided different materials to ſtore their
imagination. From childhood ſhe had
lived in a rural ſolitude, ſtudious of works
of the moſt extravagant fancy; and all
the day and part of the night were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
in a little circle of magic, from
which ſhe never iſſued. She walked
fearleſs on the utmoſt verge of romantic
fiction. With all works of reaſoning ſhe
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:0063300902:181"/>
was diſguſted; her logic conſiſted in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,
and from the impoveriſhed nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratives
of hiſtory, where all men to her
eye ſeemed dwarfs, ſhe roved to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantic
heaven of Homer, who, though
ſomewhat diſguiſed in the verſions of
Pope, were to her ſtill heroes. She read
with avidity the ancient romances of
"Amadis de Gaul," and feaſted on the
ſix folios of "Perce Foreſt;" the Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian
Tales were not diſapproved; and
Spenſer was the moſt modern poet ſhe
read; but when our Platoniſt opened
the vaſt ſcene of his philoſophical fancy,
her curioſity flew with a hundred wings;
ſhe gazed in mute aſtoniſhment, and ſat
hours in ſilent meditation.</p>
            <p>But the divine Greek was the only
language by which he could communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate
his ſenſations. She entreated his
inſtruction, and they had ſcarcely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:0063300902:182"/>
to the third book of the Iliad,
when the delighted Platoniſt thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed
a new ſyſtem of life:—</p>
            <p>"The ancient philoſophers," he ſaid,
"when they felt the impulſe of divine
energies, quitted the tumultuous habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations
of men. We muſt fruſtrate the
magic of Circe, and bid adieu to the
detaining arms of Calypſo. For many
years muſt we be exerciſed in the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartic
virtues, for the purpoſe of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating
as much as poſſible the ſoul
from the dark folds of the body, and
then at length, when we have deſtroyed
the tyranny of the paſſions, thoſe baneful
ſuitors which had ſo baſely revelled in the
palace of the ſoul, we ſhall enjoy the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful
beams of ſcience and wiſdom,
till becoming eſtabliſhed, like Ulyſſes, in
our paternal port, like him we ſhall be
united with our father, from whoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces
we have been ſo long unhappily
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:0063300902:183"/>
torn away. We ſhall find the lyre of
true philoſophy on the banks of Lethe;
there let us paſs away our lives in bliſsful
contemplations, and in liſtening to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
harmony, ſecluded from the baſe
multitude of mankind."</p>
            <p>"And this, my lovely Charlotte, has
been the only reſource of the enlightened
and pious ancients. Either we muſt tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel
or retreat; for the deluſions of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dern
religions are an impiety to the gods.
Pythagoras and Plato, the interpreters of
nature, conſidered it as neceſſary, for the
acquirement of knowledge, to traverſe
many ſeas, and inhabit many countries;
but for travelling we have no money.
Euripides compoſed his tragedies in a
cave, Democritus his philoſophy in a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered
ſpot, Demoſthenes became an
orator by the ſhores of the ſea, and
Numa conſulted the nymph Egeria in
ſilence and in ſolitude. Even the imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tators
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:0063300902:184"/>
of theſe great men, Moſes, Jeſus,
and Mahomet, alike retired at ſtated
intervals to arrange their ſyſtems, athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical
as they are! The preſence of the
gods is only viſible in ſolitude. Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medes
heard not the falling walls of his
city; Carneades, at his meals, forgot to
eat, ſo that he had nearly been famiſhed
in his own houſe; and what think you of
that philoſopher who deprived himſelf of
his ſight, that he might not be diſturbed
in his ſublime contemplations by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening
objects; and that other, who, leſt
he might be tempted to iſſue from his
ſtudious retreat, ſhaved half of his head,
that it might hinder him from appearing
in the world; for in that Platonic age no
wigs were worn.</p>
            <p>"I languiſh for retirement, that I may
compoſe a life of Homer, of whom no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
is known, and finiſh my Platonic
commentary on our divine poet. I have
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:0063300902:185"/>
calculated the verſes, arranged the mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials,
and the daily labour of three years
will eſtabliſh a ſyſtem which ſhall endure
with the elements it deſcribes. Does
Venus inſpire my Charlotte to relinquiſh
the atheiſts of an unplatonic world, and
to ſoar to the myſteries of the divine
geometrician?"</p>
            <p>Such was the converſation of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſt,
who diſcovered that Venus had
inſpired. They ſought the romantic ſpot
we have deſcribed, and the time now
arrived, when they were ſent back to the
world, enriched by the life of Homer,
and the copious diſcoveries of our Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſt,

polytheiſm was to form an univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</p>

The erection of a PANTHEON<note n="†" place="bottom">The following extracts from the Monthly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>views, on this novel extravagance of Platoniſm, I tranſcribe, being doubtful whether, otherwiſe, the greater part of what is here written on the ſubject will not appear incredible.—"There are ſome who aim to place the heatheniſm of Greece, as interpreted by the Platoniſts, among the religions publicly taught in temples, and profeſſed in ſociety. We fear it is not to be ranked among the harmleſs dreams of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary caprice. We have heard reports of ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons being willing to incur expence for opening a pantheon, in honour of the benefactors and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of ſociety." M. R. vol. xvii. 149. new ſeries.—"This is the right age for making ſuch Platonical impreſſions. There is a debility of intellect, which ſucceeds to exceſſive inquiry, whoſe morbid craving the Platonic opinions are admirably calculated to gratify. After the age of reaſon was paſt, they found ſavour with the mind-ſick inhabitants of Athens and Alexandria, of Rome and Conſtantinople, and are <hi>likely</hi> once more to accompany the progreſs of European declenſion." vol. xiv. 248.—"In modern Italy, many perſons have given into theſe chimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, and the theurgiſts have been excited the jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy of eccleſiaſtical authority." vol. xvii. 154.</note> in this
metropolis is, in ſome circles, a favourite
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:0063300902:189"/>
object. The Platoniſt terms this edifice
"a place for commemorating the aſcent
of excellent daemons." To worſhip ſuch
men would be only adoring ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular
virtue, and perpetuating by our
piety the virtue we adore. Every human
virtue forms an attribute of the divinity,
and the Creator would be reverenced,
while we felt and confeſſed his attribute
in his creature.</p>
            <p>The age ſeems propitious to every ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies
of fanaticiſm. Scepticiſm ſpreads ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidly,
and ſuperſtition gathers new energy
to oppoſe ſcepticiſm. Eſtabliſhed opinions
are too moderate for either; hence religion
breaks into ſectariſm, and philoſophy di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides
into ſyſtems. Extravagance wreſtles
with extravagance; the imagination wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
aſtoniſhed and half-delighted, but
calm ſenſe looks around, and retires in
horror. Religion and philoſophy have
become two gladiators; one departs not
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:0063300902:190"/>
without deſtroying the other; yet who
ſhall be certain that one alone will tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph?
Two gladiators have ſometimes
periſhed together by their mutual aim.</p>
            <p>One of the favourite projects of Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien
was an antichriſtian hope to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw
the religion of Jeſus. He therefore
aſſociated with all thoſe, whoſe talents or
power would co-operate with this inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
He deſired to overturn Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
not becauſe it was a ſyſtem of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
but a ſyſtem of opulence; he was
no enemy to the New Teſtament, but to
the bench of Biſhops<note n="*" place="bottom">Vaurien had alſo another reaſon for his hatred of Chriſtianity; it's principles were too peaceful, too ſelf-mortifying, and too enervating. But the preſent times are as ſanguinary as thoſe of any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer period; and we do not ſee why ſome ſhould ſo much diſlike Chriſtianity for theſe cauſes, ſince <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are now as ferocious <hi>cut-throats</hi> as thoſe of ancient times. Be it as it may, Vaurien's idea of Chriſtianity appears in the following <hi>pensée</hi> of Beaumelle, p. 177: "Paganiſm, accuſtoming men to ferocity by ſanguinary ſacrifices, in deifying great generals and courageous citizens, their wiſe legiſlators inſpired a love of liberty. Chriſtianity, in only ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſacrifices without blood, in putting ſoftneſs in the human character, canoniſing obſcure perſons detached from worldly intereſts, gives them a ſpirit of obedience. Chriſtianity talks too much of heaven, to induce much attachment to the objects of the earth, and by inculcating ſubmiſſion to monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, is an enemy to all reaſoning."</note>. He had formed
a ſtrict intimacy with the Platoniſt, and
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:0063300902:191"/>
now viſited him, to ſtimulate his induſtry
in the promulgation of polytheiſtical pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications,</p>
            <p>When he arrived at his houſe, the love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
Charlotte informed him, that the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſt
was then occupied at his prayers,
in chaunting a noon-day hymn to Apollo.
"You then," ſaid Vaurien, "do not unite
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:0063300902:192"/>
in his prayers?" Charlotte replied, "I
hold Apollo in no eſteem, becauſe of his
ill uſage of Daphne. We women are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling
to be won, but not to be forced.
It is cruel to perſecute what we cannot
ſubdue. Venus is my protector."—Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien
looked languiſhingly on Charlotte,
and exclaimed, "Venus likewiſe is the
goddeſs of young men; I worſhipped her
in the remains of her temple in Greece."
"Good Gods!" cried the romantic Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotte,
"thou then art my amiable bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;
the firſt I have met who has paid
due reverence to my divinity. The Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſt
is mindleſs of her daily oriſons.
Were we but in her temple to perform
her rites, as Herodotus deſcribes!"—"All
heaven, all earth, is her temple!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
Vaurien; "and ſure the bluſhes
that breathe like roſes on that cheek, the
liquid brilliancy of thoſe eyes, the ſoft
heavings of that boſom, proclaim the
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:0063300902:193"/>
preſence of the divinity."—"Ah!" ſaid
Charlotte, "you are the firſt man who
ever joined me in a votive teſtimony to
Venus."</p>
            <p>By this time the Platoniſt had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded
his long hymn to Apollo. Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien
now aſcended with difficulty. At the
bottom of the ſtairs was a large kennel
of dogs of various nations, who lived in
a good underſtanding with each other,
excepting when a bone was thrown among
them, for then the dogs behaved like men,
that is, they mangled and tore each other
to pieces with ſagacity and without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morſe.
Monkeys and apes were chained
on the baniſters. A little republic of cats
was peaceably eſtabliſhed on the firſt land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
place. He paſſed through one room
which was an aviary, and another which
was an apiary.</p>
            <p>From the cieling of the ſtudy of the
Platoniſt depended a poliſhed globe of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:0063300902:194"/>
plated glaſs, which ſtrongly reflected the
beams of the ſun. Amidſt this aching
ſplendor ſat the Platoniſt, changing his
ſeat with the motions of his god, ſo that
in the courſe of the day he and the ſun
went regularly round the apartment. He
was occupied in conſtructing a magic
lanthorn, which puerile amuſement ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited
the ſurpriſe of Vaurien.</p>
            <p>The Platoniſt accounted for it. "My
diſſertation on the Eleuſinian myſteries is
not all underſtood. The whole machinery,
reflected on a white ſheet, will be more
intelligible than any I could give on a
ſheet of paper. In the preſence of the
gods, in the moſt holy of the myſteries,
daemons appeared with the heads of dogs;
Pletho ſays this, who lived a thouſand
years after the myſteries. Then I have
'omniform and terrific monſters;' then
the demiurgus, the progreſs of purgation,
inſpection, crowning, torch-bearing, and,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:0063300902:195"/>
finally, friendſhip with the gods. But
here is the great difficulty. How ſhall I
repreſent 'the intolerable effulgence of the
divine light?' Much it grieves me, that
for this ſublime purpoſe a candle and a
piece of coloured tin are all I can get into
the lanthorn. The gods are not always fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable
to my attempts. After long expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riments,
I conceived I had diſcovered the
perpetual ſepulchral lamp of the ancients.
Laſt week I invited my friends to a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical
lecture on my perpetual lamp;
I triumphed in my diſcovery; but ere
my lecture cloſed my lamp was ſuddenly
extinguiſhed. Good Gods!"</p>
            <p>Vaurien condoling with him on the
imperfection of all human repreſentations
of the divinity, and the extinction of a
perpetual lamp, enquired the reaſon for
his ſingular attachment to the mute crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
Here the Platoniſt aſſumed a dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified
air, threw himſelf back in his chair,
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:0063300902:196"/>
to receive the full beams of the ſun, then
muſing, raiſed his kindled eyes on Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien,
and addreſſed him:—"To you,
whom I reſpect as the great reformer of
the age, who feel a piety for the gods,
and aid their ſolitary adorer, I will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold
the inſpirations of wiſdom."</p>
            <p>"Know then, that all men are brutes,
and all brutes are men. At firſt their figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration
appears materially different, but
it is not ſo in reality. Many brutes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach
cloſely to the human form; and
among men, many approach cloſely to
the brutal form. We have monkey
faces, bull heads, aſinine countenances,
ſpider legs, and porpoiſe obeſity; and
among females we have the face of a
tygreſs, cat-like claws, owl-like ſcreech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,

IV.—Gentile reader, we do beſeech thee to obſerve, that "the perfectibility of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind," this faſhionable phraſe of our <hi>London</hi> philoſophers, is merely an obſolete fancy imported from France.</note>; an ape
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:0063300902:198"/>
is never idle and always happy. And
juſtly has Helvetius obſerved on this
very topic, that it is to this deſire of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity
we owe all the great actions of great
men. Moſt men are deſpicable animals
when by themſelves; a brute never. All
generals, all poets, all hiſtorians, have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
ſo through rank idleneſs; a liſtleſs
exiſtence tortures; ſo, having nothing
better to do, the general ſacks or maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacres
a town, the poet writes his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorating
ode, and the hiſtorian ſhall a
thouſand years afterwards write you every
particular, and very often in the preſent
tenſe!</p>
            <p>"And this I affirm, that in thoſe arts
and ſciences which are of real utility to
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:0063300902:199"/>
animals and birds, they excel all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.
Can the weaver's loom ſpread the
fineneſs of the ſpider's web? Can the
architect build like the beaver? Sails
the mariner like the nautilus? And in
domeſtic life, can we ſkin fiſh like the
cat? Clamber like the monkey? and
ſcent like the dog? Aſk the Swiſs pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant,
Who climbs and hangs ſecurer on
the ſharp points of precipices, himſelf or
his chamois? They have, therefore, in
far greater perfection than ourſelves, that
peculiar art or ſcience they deſire. To
excel in any, we adviſe a man of genius
to apply only to a ſingle purſuit. 'Tis
preciſely what does every brute, and
therefore I aver, that every brute is a
man of genius."</p>

"To you, the confident of my heart,
I reveal it's wondrous ſecret. Know then,
I have obtained the various languages of
brutes, with whom I converſe by the

            <p>"Their language is preciſely the ſame
which men would employ in a ſimilar
predicament. Imagine to yourſelf a
company of dumb men; how would
they converſe? evidently by geſtures.
Such is the language of animals. Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture
is a vocal ſilence, an incorporated
voice. They too have their tones, but
their geſtures are exerciſed with incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
perfection; and by theſe they
preſerve a communication with their bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
brutes; I mean men. They have
few ideas, but many ſentiments; are not
logicians, but paſſionate beings; they feel

"The emotions of GESTURE conſtitute
a language far ſuperior to that of
vocal enunciation. It is the ſpontaneous
and univerſal language of nature. Our
method of communicating our ideas is
tedious, imperfect, and deceptive. By
geſture alone we can diſcover the invo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary
feelings of the heart. Say, do
not the quick and flaſhing eye; the
cheek, whoſe tints are fugitive; the half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>averted
mien; the frown, that breaks,
that paſſes, but is not forgotten; the
look that refuſes while the hand preſents,
exhibit the perſonal diſpoſitions? The
perturbed eye, the walk now quick now
ſlow of Cataline, ſhewed in his diſtracted
form the ſoul of conſpiracy. The unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
mien, the changeleſs peace of every
motion of Socrates, who, at home or

one ruffled feature; did theſe not teſtify
the regular current of his conſtant mind?

And the wretch with pliant features,
whom Titus obſerved to turn aſide the
half-ſtifled laugh at the misfortunes of
innocence, while he gave abundantly
cauſeleſs ſighs and tears, theſe indicated
to Titus the concealed villain. In that
young man, ſaid Sylla, ſpeaking of Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſar,
who walks ſo unmannerly along the
ſtreets, I ſee ſeveral Mariuſes. Cicero
relates of Anthony, that he frequently
ſtruck the ground with his knees, by the
vehemence with which he pleaded. Yes,
my friend, as the bent bow is compreſſed
with a double force, the arrow is more
impetuouſly darted; 'tis an arrow driven
by the ſtorm of heaven, that pierces where
it touches. Who knew better of nature
than Cicero, when he adviſed his brother,
that to be affable in his government, he
muſt do ſomething more than invite to
feaſts. <hi>Nil intereſt habere otium apertum,</hi>

               <hi>vultum clauſum</hi>; little it ſignifies to ſet
your doors open if your face is cloſed. We
Platoniſts have long known that geſture
is the only language of the paſſions; and
that brutes poſſeſſing this in greater per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection
than men, employ a purer and
more energetic language.</p>
            <p>"And indeed the great Campanella
affirmed, that beaſts ſpoke to each other,
becauſe they certainly underſtand each
other; for which ſimple obſervation the
Inquiſition ſinged his beard and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
to burn his body. Such was his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine
knowledge of geſture, that during
his impriſonment of many years, he tells
us, that he knew all the ſentiments of
his abſent friends or enemies by mimick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

to affirm, that he was a melancholy hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriac:

When I become a match-maker between
a dog and his female, how I envy the

lingers not with cold compliments on the
beauty of her colours, her birth, or her
age. He feels but one deſire; the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication
of his ſpecies. But then what
ſincerity in every geſture, what vivacity
in his eyes, and with what tenderneſs his
tongue careſſes his beloved. Men are ſuch
eternal bablers in love or in rage; but an
animal ſimply evinces his paſſion by a
ſingle act. Is he revengeful? he honeſtly
bites. Is he affectionate? he fervently

from a paddock, never offered to return;

been eaten. They watched, and obſerved,
every night, that they leapt over the
fences, and, after their ſtolen feaſt, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned
to their adjoining field before the
morning. Eraſmus tells us, he ſaw a dog
that had been taught to convey meat, in
a baſket, from the ſhambles: attacked by
other dogs, he would defend his maſter's
property; but when he ſaw his aſſailants
too numerous, he would then ſnatch a

            <p>"Does not hiſtory preſent us with more
numerous inſtances of the fidelity of dogs
than of men? Like men of ſtrong ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations,
their reſentment is proportioned to
their gratitude. When I was at Mount-Edgecumbe
I ſaw a monument, on which
I gazed with awe: it is raiſed to the
memory of a huntſman, who neglecting to
feed his dogs for three days, as ſoon as he
entered was torn to pieces; a dreadful

howling ſpread through the whole ſociety;
and feeling more ſenſibly the paſſion of
vengeance than that of hunger, they long
left their victuals untouched. When a
dog-butcher at Canton enters a ſtreet, all
the dogs purſue him in full cry. When a
Kamtſcadale loſes his ſtick, by which he
drives the dogs of his ſledge, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
perceive it, and run off as faſt as
poſſible, to overturn him in the ſnow.
Ill treat a dog, he will long remember it;
and, when you ſeek his reconciliation, will
preſerve his dignity, and make no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances

            <p>"The language of birds is elliptical,

Phaedon, a ſublime imitation of Plato on
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:0063300902:219"/>
the immortality of the ſoul. The Jew
deſired to conclude his meal quietly, and
proceeded in employing at once his teeth
and his eyes; but the head digeſts not
like the mouth; and the Jew had now ſo
violently abſtracted his imagination, that
Vaurien roſe with impatience. The phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher

            <p>"How long ſhall philoſophy," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
Vaurien, "mourn over the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gradation

all our European youth, and of every

preſent at one of the late earthquakes in
Italy. The multitude were gazing on the
ruins of a town; the nobles ſighed at the

citizens mourned their buried fortunes.
A voice from the multitude broke the
melancholy ſilence, exclaiming, 'Now WE
ARE ALL EQUAL.' A ſublime and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
truth! Unhappy is that country,
whatever be it's grandeur, in which a
great portion of it's citizens would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
exile as no puniſhment, and an

of delighted vengeance. And this
muſt be the feeling of every Indian Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro

            <p>"You deliver yourſelf," replied the Jew,
"with the voluble eloquence of your na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
In this temperate climate we fear

                  <p>Voltaire, but neither Rouſſeau nor Mirabeau, was their enemy. Lately, when the learned Dohm, of Berlin, publiſhed his treatiſe, 'Sur la Reforme Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique des Juiſs,' Mr. Hartmann oppoſed that work of humanity. Sheridan has pourtrayed them in the old ſtyle. Voltaire, Hartmann, and Sheridan, Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian libertines, had been duped by ſome Jewiſh uſurers. Mr. Hourwitz, a literary Jew of Poland, has compoſed the Apology of his nation with the energy of an Iſraelite rouſed into action, who, feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing deeply, writes forcibly. He tells us, that he knows many young men have conceived a hatred againſt Jews, becauſe ſeveral have ſupplied them with money, by which means they loſt their health and their fortune. He knew a German magiſtrate, who perſecuted all Jews, becauſe, when young, by their money he had contracted a ſhameful diſorder.—Such caſes only ſhew that the prudent Jew knows the value of money, and the imprudent Chriſtian is an abject ſlave of his unſubdued paſſions.</p>

His ſtyle is too beautiful to loſe itſelf on ſuch offenſive ſubjects; it is a gilding ſunſhine that exhauſt, it's ſplendour on a dunghill. Dr. Moore, in his Travels, benevolently abuſes them. The pleaſant Doctor, perhaps, envies ſome rich Jews he may happen to have met in the courſe of his peregrinations.

Longinus termed Moſes a genius of no

M. Paſtoret, in his 'Moiſe conſideré comme Legiſlateur et Moraliſte,' p. 7. has proved that Moſes is mentioned by a pagan writers; by Strabo, Juſtin, Menethon, Diodorus Siculus, Pliny, and Apuleius; but their notices are equally romantic and uncertain.—In this work the reader will find a good analyſis of the Moſaic legiſlation. It is learned, pious, and heavy. That philoſophy is very narrow that gives, for the cauſe of the Jewiſh iſolation, the ſtrict inhibition of Moſes againſt ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous practiſes. Idolatry has ceaſed, but they are ſtill iſolated.</note>. Extending his
views with a vaſtneſs that ennobles but
not exceeds human ſagacity, by rigid and
numerous cuſtoms which he conſecrated
by their holineſs, he has produced, from

generation to generation, an inheritance

What at firſt in his code ſeems mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute,
frivolous, and abſurd, is ſublimely

magnificent conception of Moſes; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving
that, mingled with other nations,
they might aſſimilate to their cuſtoms,

It was neceſſary for them to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate
that they might flouriſh. We
trace this fact in what relates to their

Their law not admitting of the military

is equally ſimple as the cauſes already aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned.
When Chriſtianity was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed,
it degraded beneath the rank of
men the children of Jacob. Not merely
vaſſals, they were frequently bond-men.
With the other cattle the circumciſed
ſlaves were transferred from proprietor to

A more remarkable inſtance is that of this

and the following year prince Edward,
being as deeply indebted as his father,

            <p>"In this ſingular ſtate induſtry was a
ſource of proſperity. Chriſtians were
then moſt religious, little wiſe, and leſs

                  <p>A ſketch of their domeſtic life is given by the quaint and witty Fuller, in his Church Hiſtory, b. III. par. 37.

Swiue's fleſh, indeed, they would not eat, but dog's meat they would; I mean beef and mutton, ſo poor and lean that the refuſe of all Chriſtians was the Jews portion in the ſhambles. Their cloaths were ſo poor and patched, beggars would not take them up to have them. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants they kept none, every one waiting on himſelf. No wonder then if eaſily they did <hi>over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grow</hi> others in wealth, who baſely did <hi>underlive</hi> themſelves in all convenient accommodations." And at par. 40. "Endleſs it were to reckon up the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities offered unto theſe Jews. Apprentices now-a-days do not throw ſticks at cocks on Shrove Tueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day ſo commonly as on that day they uſed clubs on the Jews, when they appeared out of their houſes; a people equally unhappy at feaſts or frays; for whenever the Chriſtians at any revels made great entertainments, the Jews were made to pay the reckoning; and whereſoever any brawl be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan in London, it ended always in the Old Jewry, with the pillaging of the people therein."</p>
                  <p>Such is the jocular humanity of this honeſt Eccleſiaſtic! A ſimilar character diſtinguiſhes the labours of the antiquary Tovey. Both theſe Engliſh writers of Jewiſh hiſtory felt as men, but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times reaſoned as Chriſtians.</p>

            <p>"It remains now to add, that there is a

The late Moſes Mendelſohn, by the force of his reaſoning, has been ſurnamed the Jewiſh Socrates, and by the amenity of his dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Jewiſh Plato. Denina, in his "Pruſſe Litteraire," ſays, that to this Jew is the German language indebted for many graces and ameliora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Bloch, a Jewiſh phyſician, was the firſt natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt of the age; Herz is a profeſſor with four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred auditors; Mainon, a profound metaphyſician. There are Jewiſh poets and Jewiſh artiſts of eminence; and which, perhaps, exiſt no where but in Berlin, a Jewiſh academy of ſciences, and a Jewiſh literary journal, compoſed in Hebrew. All theſe great men, during their youth, had to ſtruggle with their poverty and their Talmud; but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of Moſes Mendelſohn animated his people and his aſſociates; his fellow citizen he inſtructed as a father, and his rival he cheriſhed as a brother. Literary Jews muſt always be rare; no ſtudents are liable to ſuch numerous obſtacles; their moſt malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and powerful enemies will be found among their domeſtic aſſociates.

In the oppoſite quarters the

the fugitives who eſcaped from

very patriotically voted, when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
that they had only effected half a

One night completed the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy
of Fieſco; and Marius and Sylla
are immortal. Let us imitate the vaſt
deſigns and ſplendid deeds of great men.
In a cauſe like this the coward only is
avaricious of blood, and the fool only is
prodigal of words. A maſſacre in politics
is an electric ſhock; it calls forth a flame
from the coldeſt bodies. I have joined
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:0063300902:268"/>
in glorious maſſacres. You muſt want a
feeble conception of the ſcene:—In the
ſilence and ſhade of night, when the ſtill
air is almoſt heard, then like a ſummer
thunder ſuddenly burſting from all parts,
ſhouts and groans, the ſhrieks of women,
the claſh of ſwords, the firing of piſtols,
the lurid ſkies now dark with ſmoke now
red with flame, ſome fugitive and others
purſuing, the people now precipitating
and now precipitated, the ſtreets kennel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
with blood, the paſſage obſtructed by
corſes, and the exulting eye of a true
patriot glutted and tranquil amid bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
carnage: at ſuch a moment, my
friends, every conſpirator is ardent with
triumph, while every citizen is frozen
with terror. I entered a church at Paris
with but a few friends; above five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
prieſts had ſought an aſylum; they
were chaunting Te Deum; when we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
all their voices were united, but
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:0063300902:269"/>
not one reſiſted our daggers; we gradually
heard voice by voice decline, till only a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litary
accent ſounded in the hollow arches
of the church; we left him to his fate,
protected by the corſes of five hundred of
his ſlaughtered companions. Believe me,
the arm of an active patriot does not tire.
Let men be aſſembled, and I aſk not a
minute to a man. You have heard of the
aſſaſſin of the Princeſs of Lamballe; I had
him over, but he has been ſhipped off;
he was a maſter. The rich cannot fight,
and the poor will. Place a well-fed ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
with one who has been faſting for ten
months; the meagre one attacks, maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres,
and gorges<note n="*" place="bottom">This curious fact (verifying the ſingular abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence of ſpiders) has been lately given by Mr. Vail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant, in his travels. He confined a ſpider in a glaſs bottle during the ſpace of ten months; it lived, but it's belly was diminiſhed to a point: he then in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced a ſpider in vigour and condition. The ſpider, which had undergone ſuch a Turkiſh rama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zan, gazed on the ſtranger ſome time, and at length, alarm ceaſing with familiarity, he fraternized with him with all his claws, and the rich and corpulent ſpider was ſoon pulled to pieces by the meagre and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhed fellow citizen.</note>. Men are ſpiders in
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:0063300902:270"/>
this reſpect. Not a town in England but
will riſe. Will not the French fleets be
ſafe in our ports?"</p>
            <p>"Conſider the winds, the winds," cried
Vaurien. "You are as ſanguine as you
are ſanguinary. You ſurely are diſeaſed
with a calenture, and imagine the ſeas to
be green fields."</p>
            <p>"Damn the winds!" retorted Dragon.
"Did not Monſieur Volney tell us, he
would manage them by this time? Are
we then to poſtpone a ſalutary maſſacre
for a N.W. or a N.E.? You then have
deceived me. I depended on the winds!"</p>
            <p>"We cannot calculate the winds yet,"
obſerved Subtile; "but there is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſting
poſſibility of this next year."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:0063300902:271"/>
"Aſſuredly, or in ten thouſand years
hence," ſaid Reverberator.</p>
            <p>"Damn your gigantic ſyſtem!" ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed
Dragon; "you talk of ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand
years, and ſuffer the exiſting hour
to paſs away unnoticed, unknown, and
unuſed. Your whole life is reduced to
childhood."</p>
            <p>"Nothing can be done with the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers,"
ſaid Vaurien. "My project of an
univerſal peace charmed, but my mode
terrified. My ſyſtem is, however, well
calculated. France, by it's extent and
it's populouſneſs, can hold out a war
longer than any neighbouring country;
ſo that when other nations are half de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed,
it will retain a reſpectable and
ſelect number of republicans. In our cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culations
we look rather at the expence
of powder and ball than of men; we have
too many men, but are often in want of
ammunition. The genius of our new
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:0063300902:272"/>
tactics is to fight inceſſantly by land,
and at ſea to board the enemy, that we
may relieve ourſelves from the ſuperfluity
of our men. To deſtroy or be deſtroyed
is the only ſecret of our art. A diurnal
war of twenty years is therefore deſirable.
I flatter myſelf two millions of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies
might be annually got rid of. At
the cloſe of the twenty years we ſhould be
able to eſtabliſh, what hitherto has been
the cloſet dream of the philoſopher,—an
univerſal peace."</p>
            <p>"Your calculation is commendable,"
replied Subtile; "but this general peace
greatly reſembles the peace of a church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard.
It is a kind of peace which may
be already enjoyed in a deſert. My pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
is evidently ſuperior. I would not
ſlaughter, but <hi>reaſon</hi> with men. What are
the cauſes or motives of war? Many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed
have been aſſigned, yet they are all
reſolvable into one; the propoſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:0063300902:273"/>
obtainable by a war. Now, of
advantages or diſadvantages, no cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion
exiſts but our conviction; it is,
therefore, a matter for argument. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
at preſent make war before they
negotiate; they ſhould negotiate before
they make war. A war rarely produces
any real benefit to either party, but is
attended with inevitable evil to both.
At a peace the contending nations rejoice;
rather ſhould they mourn; then only they
perceive themſelves placed amidſt ruins
and deſolations. A war has been often
kindled by a miſterm in a treaty<note n="*" place="bottom">This obſervation is verified by a recent fact. Thomas Paine complains of a verbal inaccuracy of the American treaty with England, which might ſerve for a ſubſtantial cauſe of a war. The treaty makes a conceſſion to England to ſeize proviſions and <hi>other articles</hi> in American ſhips. The term <hi>other articles,</hi> Thomas Paine affirms, includes <hi>all other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles whatever.</hi> He conceives the detection of as much importance as our philoſopher Subtile.</note>: and
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:0063300902:274"/>
thus alſo in law, which is another kind
of war. I was ſaved at the Old Bailey,
becauſe the Attorney-general had miſpelt
my name <hi>Subtile,</hi> by <hi>Subtle.</hi> A letter more
or leſs, a comma or a full ſtop, have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
diſturbed the peace of Europe.
I am of opinion that it is neceſſary to
convince the world, that inſtead of armies
compoſed of ſoldiers, it ſhould only form
them of correct grammarians and expert
logicians. Nations quarrel becauſe they
do not underſtand each other. Reaſon is
immutable; every obſtacle is removed
by a lucid explanation. A treaty of war
would be more deſirable than a battle of
war. Who could reſiſt arguments ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
deduced, and grammar nicely correct?
There would be no miſunderſtandings,
for there would be no miſterms."</p>
            <p>"Grammer and reaſon!" exclaimed
Rant. "I give my vote of diſſent in toto!
What would become of me and my works
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:0063300902:275"/>
if grammer or reaſon were to be their cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terions?
Cannon and gunpowder are as
neceſſary as pen and ink."</p>
            <p>"I am no great admirer, I confeſs, of
grammer and reaſon," ſaid Reverberator.
"I have a natural antipathy to them;
for when I was an oſtler at Newmarket,
I ever obſerved that certain anomalies in
the Engliſh language had the greateſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect
on my horſes and my aſſociates.
Some of our moſt energetic expreſſions
are both unreaſonable and ungramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical."</p>
            <p>"Mr. Subtile is, however, juſt in what
he ſays reſpecting grammar and reaſon,"
ſaid Dr. Bounce; "for had the writer of
the firſt chapter of Geneſis but known
either, he would not have uſed the word
<hi>Elohim,</hi> which plural word, Gods, has
given to ſome a ſtrong proof of the exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
of the Trinity, by which ſo many
honeſt men like myſelf are kept out of
the hierarchy."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="273" facs="tcp:0063300902:276"/>
"I ſhould fear," ſaid Vaurien, turning
to Subtile, "that your treaties of war,
to be conducted by logic, would be as
deceptive as our preſent treaties of peace;
for it ſeems you can reaſon with equal
force on both ſides. You can, Mr. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberator
informs me, prove that man is
a ſtone, and then, that a ſtone is not a
man."</p>
            <p>"I can," replied Subtile, with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulting
tone. "It is the eaſieſt operation of
my logic; for it is performed by the mode
of the ancient ſyllogiſm. In my great
work you will find many propoſitions more
curious and extraordinary. To our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
buſineſs. I do it thus: A ſtone is a
body; an animal is a body; man is an
animal; ergo, man is a ſtone. Again:
No ſtone is an animal; man is an animal;
ergo, man is not a ſtone. Let beings, I
repeat, rational and intelligent, act with
rationality and intelligence, and I confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:0063300902:277"/>
affirm, that a ſound logic would
conduct the affairs of the world more
forcibly than an iron world of ſoldiers."</p>
            <p>"Moſt powerfully put!" replied Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien,
with a ſmile. "I am glad, however,

            <p>WHEN Vaurien reflected on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>determinations
of his ſecret com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees,
the imbecillity of his coadjutors,
and the evident ſmallneſs of the number
of true republicans in this country, he
perceived that it was neceſſary to congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate
men by other means than the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
hitherto purſued. After profound
meditation, he ſketched ſeveral plans
equally ingenious, and at length ſelected
one which appeared to promiſe an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal
confuſion; to delight the young en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſt
in his cloſet, the enlightened by
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:0063300902:279"/>
honours rendered to ſcience, the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace
by the aſtoniſhment of a new and
univerſal ſenſation, and the true republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can
by enabling ſuch to meet for mutual
ſupport, and, like David, to "number
his people."</p>
            <p>He now ſat down to compoſe this
great work. He entitled it, "A Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,
in the name and authority of all
Nations," and he called himſelf, "Agent
General of all the Arts and Sciences."</p>
            <p>It's deſign was an exhortation addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed
to all the Engliſh, the Scotch, and the
Iriſh, to commemorate the birth, the
works, and the name of Newton. He
propoſed that an act of parliament ſhould
immediately decree a national edition of
his works; that his majeſty ſhould an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually
go in ſtate to Newton's printing
preſs, and pay due homage to the art of
printing, as the emperor of China, to
reverence the art of agriculture, annually
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:0063300902:280"/>
conducts the plough. That columns
ſacred to Newton be erected in every
great town throughout the three ſiſter
kingdoms; that the name of Newton be
inſcribed among the princes of the royal
blood; that a new order of knighthood
be formed, called the Newtonian; that
his majeſty ſhould beſtow on "the agent
for all the arts and ſciences," the title of
"Sir Newton Vaurien;" that a Newtonian
fleet be prepared for new diſcoveries in
every quarter of the world; and finally,
that the houſe of the arch-philoſopher,
which, we do not bluſh to relate, is at
preſent converted into an eating-houſe,
and eating is full as uſeful as philoſophy,
ſhould be raiſed into a magnificent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
his diſcoveries to be ſet to Handel's
muſic, and philoſophical hymns to be
daily chanted to his memory throughout
theſe three kingdoms!</p>

               <pb n="278" facs="tcp:0063300902:281"/>
To defray the charges of this ſublime
project, he propoſed that two guinea
ſubſcriptions be depoſited at his banker's,
and that any ſurplus of money, after the
chop-houſe had been raiſed into a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
be applied to the relief of the poor,
in the manner ſo humanely recommended
by Dean Swift<note n="*" place="bottom">It may be neceſſary to inform moſt of my readers, that this entire project has been publiſhed in London, laſt year. See "De par toutes les Nations," a book to be purchaſed at Elmſley's. The author is Monſieur De la Blancherie, who Madame Roland mentions among her numerous train of lovers; this circumſtance is creditable to his taſte; whether it is to his politics I determine not. Monſieur De la Blancherie's intentions may be very innocent; all that I am informed is, that his zeal for the preſent project occaſioned him to be threatened with the <hi>Alien Bill</hi>; but if he now reſides in this country, it is an evidence of the juſtice of our government, and the ſimplicity of his heart. I will venture to aſſure this gentleman, that Newton is reverenced by Engliſhmen, not like <hi>true republicans,</hi> but <hi>honeſt men</hi>; not like <hi>boys,</hi> but <hi>ſtudents:</hi> they read his works with the ſame calm and ſlow ſagacity by which the Briton formed them.

Such is the literal analyſis of this ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centric
project! a cool and rational Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
will inſtantly pronounce it the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception
of infanity, and that no political
miſchief could attend any ſimilar publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation;
as if great madmen were not to
the full as dangerous as great villains. If
Vaurien were mad, there was certainly
"a method in his madneſs;" but Vaurien
was in good health, although not in high
ſpirits, when he compoſed this great work.
It was a final project. Every exertion of
deſpair, if unſucceſsful, is conſidered as
an act of lunacy, but attended with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs,
we then acknowledge it the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:0063300902:283"/>
invention of no ordinary genius.
This project ceaſes to be an abſurdity
when confronted with ſome of a kindred
character realiſed in France. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval
of the bones of Voltaire and Rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau,
carried with an idolatrous pomp to
the deification of a Pantheon, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional
commemoration of a ferocious li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty
by the exhibition of an allegorical
pantomime, and the national dreſſes,
motley and fantaſtical, in all forms and
all colours, were aſſuredly not extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies
of lunatics, but puerilites of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning
men; puerile only in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance,
invented to captivate the eye;
to pleaſe the fancies of women, to awe
youth into reſpect, and to divert the
paſſions of the multitude into any chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel
of obſervation and converſe, rather
than ſuffer them to roll their turbid
waves amidſt the ſecreted fountain of

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:0063300902:284"/>

they give them harmleſs mockeries, that

            </p>
            <p>There was ſagacity in this laſt attempt
of Vaurien. He had hitherto promiſed
to his patron rapid wonders, which ſhould
be followed by each other with undeviat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
and miraculous power. The Cardinal
De Rohan did not more revere the buſt
of Caglioſtro, whom he conſidered as the
great <hi>illuminé</hi> of the age, than Lord Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field
confided in the head of Vaurien;
but the Gaul in every event had proved
the dupe of his own impetuous imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.
The fleets of France were diſperſed,
were taken, and were burnt. The Iriſh
were loyal, and felt a Britiſh indignation
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:0063300902:285"/>
at a Gallic gaſconade. The true repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans
in London were too few to enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merate,
and too contemptible to liſten
to. Bold, firm, and diſcontented men
he found, but their audible diſcontent
proved the freedom of our country. He
ſaw that our government felt all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities
of long adminiſtrations; no go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment
can reach a ſtationary perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
all were formed by human paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions,
and all are carried on by contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
intereſts; every government is good
which is ſupportable. Vaurien ſaw that
ours could not be as pure and vigorous
as in it's youth of 1688; it's ſound con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
is rather debilitated by luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious
eaſe, than imbecile by a pithleſs
and frigid age. He ſaw our preſs was
free, our juries were holy, our judges
honeſt; a miniſter may be cenſured and
impeached, and the voice of the people
can reach the throne; and the purity of
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:0063300902:286"/>
our conſtitution had been tried in it's
fountain head. Vaurien had ſeen with
ſurpriſe, that a member, who profeſſed
himſelf independent, could expel, when
he elevated his voice, a member who had
been ſpawned forth from the filth of
commercial corruption.</p>
            <p>He perceived the imbecility of the
chiefs of his party, who aſſumed the
ſovereignty of human opinion, and one
of whom only had a juſt claim to genius.
In vain the unfeeling, the ſophiſtical, and
the metaphyſical Subtile had choſen to
characteriſe free men, like herds of Yahoos;
in vain he had, with minute malice, and
hyperbolical calumny, artiſtly painted a
ſombrous and terrific picture, which he
choſe to term the Engliſh conſtitution;
in vain he had created a being with a
petrifaction for it's heart, ice-water for
it's blood, and clock-work for it's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
which he choſe to term a man.
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:0063300902:287"/>
Still more in vain was Reverberator, the
noon-tide ſhadow of this metaphyſical
giant; his ten thouſand years could only
occaſion the laugh, forgotten with the
moment. When Vaurien heard him af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm
the wonderful influence of mind
over the exterior organization, and that
life might be prolonged at will, and
looked on this philoſopher of eternity, he
ſmiled to view a diminutive frame, a
ſhrunken countenance, a man broken
down in the maturity of life, whoſe volu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility
was interrupted by an aſthma,
whoſe vigour marched with tottering legs,
and whoſe boldneſs trembled with ſhat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
nerves. This Reverberator, who,
conceiving that all things were acquirable
by the perſerverance of habit, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
in his walk to take large ſtrides, that
he might gradually make a gigantic ſtep;
to diminiſh his food by ſlow gradations,
that in time he might exiſt with the
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:0063300902:288"/>
leaſt, or poſſibly without any food; and
on the ſame principle, ſtraining and ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciating
his mind with his body, attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
to become a man of genius, by writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
comedies without taſte, poetry with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
imagination, and politics in a rage.
From Sympathy he could expect little,
ſince although he was willing to overturn
all religion, he ſtill retained ſo much of
the prieſt as to inſiſt on becoming an
archbiſhop of Canterbury. For the reſt
of the ſociety, peace be to their manes!</p>
            <p>Situated thus, deſolate in hope, and
active in deſpair, he publiſhed this eccen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tric
proclamation, and reſigned it to the
influence of chance; chance, to which ſo
many great characters have had recourſe,
and which he knew, in the moſt complicated
and ruinous game, ſometimes turns up
the dice which decides our fortune.</p>
            <p>Vaurien had ill calculated the genius
of our nation. He had committed the
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:0063300902:289"/>
error of his Pariſian friends; they think
we reſemble them; that is, they conſider
us as men much worſe than we are.
They have examined ſome looſe rotten
bricks which have fallen from the Britiſh
edifice, and decide on the wondrous
piles by ſome natural caſualties. In vain
we are told, that all men are the ſame
men. National characters are oppoſite.
To moral, and not to phyſical cauſes, can
be aſcribed that hoſtility of opinions,
which has, from age to age, removed, at
ſo vaſt an interval, the genius of theſe
neighbouring nations. The ſame winter
and ſummer refrigerate and heat Paris and
London, but not the ſame well-poiſed
government and the ſame domeſtic vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues.
Taſte, is a criterion of national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter.
Voltaire never comprehended the
genius of Shakeſpeare; Johnſon never
taſted the ingenuity of Voltaire. An

but when Subtile followed with mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured

he could not ſoften his auſterity with

            <p>Redoubtable they are in politics, for

ſubtile in their hypocriſy, and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guinary
in their power. In France they
feel to inexpreſſible delicacy, or to incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceivable
horror; their individual mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders
have ever been characteriſed by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar
and complex barbarity<note n="*" place="bottom">Long ere their national genius broke out in recent maſſacres, it was to be traced in their <hi>private murders,</hi> which were conducted by ſingular intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy, and perpetrated with ſingular horror. A lady of rank, to revenge her lover confined in the Baſtile, poiſoned her father, her brother, and others of the family. A female rival viſiting her friend when ſhe lay-in, put arſenick in the broth. A Frenchman invited a country family, conſiſting of four perſons, to his houſe, and by a moſt inventive plan ſeparated them, murdered every individual, and took poſſeſſion of their eſtate; another in England, after having murdered his landlady, during a whole week was employed in calmly dividing the corſe in ſmall portions. A number of ſimilar authentic facts might be given. They have ever exhibited a moſt inventive method in their cruelties, and the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution has only ſhewn the world that national cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which has long been known to the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher.</note>; impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:0063300902:292"/>
feelings are fugitive, and take
an oppoſite direction; they commit
murders, and then inſcribe "ICI L'ON
DANSE." Women in all things, they
are women in vengeance. Impatient of
reſtraint, in war, a ſiege diſcourages and
repels them; in peace, an orderly conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution
could neither excite their love
nor their reverence. Terrible in aſſault,
contemptible in ſlight; vaſt in their
projects, imbecile in their purſuits; capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
of imagining all things, incapable of
performing any. They triumph for a
moment, and deſpair through a century.
Of all nations, they alone have felt that
calenture of political imagination, which
has aſpired to an univerſal monarchy or
an univerſal republic; but they have
never known that Britiſh vigour of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
which could form for Engliſhmen
the moſt perfect conſtitution humanity
can ſuffer. When the French were <hi>ſlaves,</hi>
us they reverenced; when <hi>free,</hi> us they
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:0063300902:293"/>
imitated; now <hi>licentious,</hi> they envy and

continued revolutions; yet may their
deſigns be fruſtrated; ONE revolution
was ſufficient for the Engliſh. Danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous

the imagination; they ſeduce the eye
and inflame the heart; they mingle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent
virtues, which conceal their radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal
viciouſneſs; incapable of perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance,
but they will periſh in their cauſe
if deſtruction comes rapidly; they will
declaim on freedom, when they exerciſe
tyranny; revere the humanity of peace,
while their hand is armed with death;
they will reform prejudices, while they
introduce prejudices ſtill more calamitous;
they term themſelves citizens of the world,
while they ſly from place to place, and
only leave in their career the memory
of their deſolations. They come to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy

The French reſemble water-melons, of
which, proverbially, not one in a thouſand
taſtes with perfection; their liquor is
aqueous, and rarely delicious; while the
Engliſh, like the cocoa-nut, bear a rough
and hard incruſtation, which protects the
milk of human kindneſs<note n="*" place="bottom">As this work has aſſumed in it's progreſs a deeper political caſt than the author at firſt propoſed, he conceives it neceſſary here to add, that he loves the cauſe of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom above all other human intereſts.

of Rapin in his hiſtory, who, when he
has finiſhed a certain portion of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs
of the ſtate, as we have done, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns

            <p>Emily with ſecret pleaſure now gazed
on Vaurien. She felt the ſame degree
of faſcinated affection as Charles experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced.
Placed in a ſimilar ſituation,
they mutually loved and hated. When
Emily liſtened to Lady Belfield, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived
ideas of contempt; and to Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien,
of confirmed horror relative to
Charles. Of the character of Mrs. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
ſhe had received indubitable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:0063300902:297"/>
She and Charles felt alike; for
the innocence and purity of both were
the marked victims of the diſappointed
paſſion of her Ladyſhip, and the cruel
malice of the Gaul. Yet it is worthy
of obſervation, that all theſe compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated
miſchiefs were originally derived
from a young man's charity for a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
proſtitute!</p>
            <p>Emily had ſcarcely reſided a month with
Lady Belfield when ſhe found her depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent
life even more wretched than with
the daughter of the loan-contractor. The
beauty and diſſipation of Miſs Million by
no means rivalled thoſe of her Ladyſhip;
and having been born in Pudding-lane,
ſhe was not ſo expert and creative in her
derelictions from decency and virtue as
her rival, who had been born in Groſve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor-ſquare;
and yet we ſhall not have
recourſe to <hi>climate</hi> to ſolve this problem,
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:0063300902:298"/>
as many other philoſophers would. She
had not yet ſeized on the natural genius
of diſſipation; for it is by no means a
facile labour to become the moſt aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned
and the moſt amiable of women;
an experienced taſte is required even in
the ſelection of impurities.</p>
            <p>The domeſtic manners of her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
were viewed with a ſenſation of horror.
A ſtranger to her Lord, yet reſiding un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
the ſame roof; when deſcribing
the embarraſſments of their fortune, her
high play ſhe termed a national debt;
an avowed and criminal intercourſe with
her favourites was called a <hi>fleurette,</hi>
and with her claimants a ſtamped re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt.
Her private converſations alarmed
her hourly; for her Ladyſhip, to give an
evidence of her friendſhip, threw off her
reſerve, and, like the Dueſſa of Spenſer,
diſcovered under the gay and brilliant
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:0063300902:299"/>
dreſs by which ſhe enchanted the public
eye, a form of demoniac uglineſs and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious
diſtortion.</p>
            <p>In Vaurien Emily perceived nothing
but humanity and accompliſhment. He
too wore a beautiful maſk; but art had
ſo emulated nature, that if the innocent
Emily miſtook a maſk for a face, others
of more experienced ſagacity had been
alike deceived.</p>
            <p>Sometimes when ſhe ſat alone her
thoughts wandered to Charles; his image
had been placed on the altar of her heart,
and we do not readily break the idols which
we once have worſhipped. Yet on Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien
ſhe looked as on her protector, and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilitated,
by the deſolation of her hopes
and the urgency of her wants, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
he meditated.</p>
            <p>In the mean while Vaurien perceived
the growing paſſion of his rival, who, in
the confidence of his friendſhip, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:0063300902:300"/>
the reſtleſs emotions of his boſom.
"To love her," ſaid Charles, "who me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
not love, is a faſcination. It is in
vain I combat and I reſolve; when her
image comes before me, every thought
turns to her; eternally I gaze on that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual
phantom which takes the pure
form without the impure mind of this
girl." Vaurien was alike convinced of
Emily's predilection for Charles; becauſe
not only he had caught her abrupt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologue,
which we have given, at the
moment ſhe had diſcovered the character
of Mrs. Wilſon, but alſo becauſe ſhe made
frequent enquiries concerning Charles,
and mourned over his character leſs with
the regret of diſpleaſure, than with the
grief of paſſion.</p>
            <p>Charles, although he would not enter
the houſe of Belfield, was induced, by his
reſtleſs anxiety, to enquire concerning
Emily of her maid. By her he diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
that ſhe was far from being of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:0063300902:301"/>
diſpoſitions with her Ladyſhip,
with whom ſhe did not appear on the
eaſieſt terms; that ſhe was melancholy,
and often had been obſerved in tears.
The maid, however, confeſſed that Emily
ſeemed much delighted by the ſociety of
Vaurien, that ſhe often played to him on
her harp, that they paſſed hours in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation,
and that ſhe conſulted with
him on every preſſing occaſion. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted
connection between her Lady<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip
and Emily he attributed to the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit
of rivalry, while the latter part of the
information amply confirmed her charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
according to the deſcriptions of his
friend Vaurien.</p>
            <p>His agitated ſpirits preyed on his
frame, and his health viſibly declined.
In his literary purſuits he gave marks of
the diſtraction of his mind; and ſome
ſingular blunders he had committed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced
Johnſon that he concealed ſome
powerful emotion, too apparent in it's
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:0063300902:302"/>
effects. He ſaid to him one day, "My
good friend, I did not know you was the
abſent man; but you will ruin me. You
inſerted, I find, in Mr. Snowden's Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels
to Ruſſia, Mr. Fervid's deſcription
of his newly-diſcovered iſland under the
Line; and you have ſent to the printer
of the Britiſh Critic, the article on the
aboliſhment of epiſcopacy, which was
meant for the Critical Review, while
this month the Critical contains that
orthodox diſſertation to prove the nature
of the Trinity on the principles of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
ſenſe. The literary world is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.
The Rivingtons menace with
the pillory; the Robinſons (who <hi>yet</hi> do
not command the pillory) threaten to
ſtarve me out of employment. You
know that all the arts and ſciences, all
the wit and genius of the age, are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely
under controul of the Rivingtons
and the Robinſons, brothers and book<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellers<note n="*" place="bottom">The former, publiſhers of the 'Britiſh Critic,' and the latter, of the 'Critical Review.' It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that Meſſrs. Rivingtons occaſionally write ſome of the Greek articles in the 'Britiſh Critic,' and that Meſſrs. Robinſons write what articles they chuſe. I have no objection to <hi>their</hi> writing, and return thanks for many kind notices reſpecting my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, which I will labour to merit; but I conſider them as the Anthonies and Octavius's of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic of letters, and hope they will not treat me in the preſent inſtance as the great Cicero was treated, that is, after having been maſſacred and mutilated, frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of his corſe were hung up in terrorem to the public eye. I deſire therefore they would be careful of the <hi>extracts</hi> they make, which form the fragments of an author's dead body.</note>." <pb n="300" facs="tcp:0063300902:303"/>
Charles deſired to relinquiſh
his purſuits, acknowledged himſelf ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorbed
in a paſſion fatal to his repoſe,
that he loved an object who merited
not love, and now related the hiſtory of
Emily, which he had hitherto concealed.</p>
            <p>Johnſon inſtantly inſinuated an idea,
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:0063300902:304"/>
that Vaurien had been deceiving him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting
the character of Emily.</p>
            <p>"Impoſſible!" replied Charles. "Would
the man who with one hand has given me
the means of ſubſiſtence ſnatch from me
with the other it's only enjoyment?"</p>
            <p>Johnſon having received his promiſe
that he would never more touch another
manuſcript, aſſured him that he would
ſoon give him more certain evidence of
the artifice of the Gaul.</p>
            <p>He ſeized on the earlieſt opportunity
of conferring with Emily, and delighted
her, when ſhe was aſſured that Charles
was virtuous and impaſſioned.</p>
            <p>"And whence," ſhe enquired, "his
ſhameleſs connection with an abject be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?"</p>
            <p>"Eccentric humanity! That being is
a virtuous woman. We muſt learn to
correct our prejudices if we would not
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:0063300902:305"/>
too frequently pierce with an added ſting
the bleeding boſom of virtuous misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.
What ſhe related is true; but ſhe
could not relate all. Her modeſty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed
her incontinence." Johnſon related
her intereſting connection with Charles.
When he had finiſhed, Emily raiſed her
eyes to heaven, exclaiming, "My father,
once have you erred! Virtue, then, may
aſſume a criminal appearance. Siſter of
affliction! where does ſhe now wander?
Victim of prejudice and delicacy! I could
now embrace her with the confidence of
virtue. I could preſs this woman, who
was a proſtitute, to my artleſs boſom, as
an image of maternal affection. Tell Mr.
Charles he is an excellent young man; if
I ceaſed to eſteem him, the cauſe of that
ceſſation will convince him that I now
muſt eſteem him but the more."</p>
            <p>"If you eſteem him," ſaid Johnſon,
then have I an accuſation againſt you.
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:0063300902:306"/>
Charles knows that you are attached to
Vaurien, and take a viſible delight in his
ſociety."</p>
            <p>"I am only born," replied Emily, "to
be deceived. Yes, Vaurien's accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
were eloquent, and his virtues were
ſplendid. His character now becomes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intelligible.
Is he then a villain?—Ah,
my father! are you again right? My
father, Sir, at his death, exhorted me to
'fly the agreeable.'—I ſhould not then
have incurred this juſt imputation."</p>
            <p>"Your father," obſerved Johnſon,
counſelled you wiſely; the agreeable ever
make an eaſy conqueſt of your ſex."</p>
            <p>When theſe myſteries were elucidated,
Vaurien diſcovered them in Emily's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance
and converſation. She at length
accuſed him of his ungenerous treatment
of Charles.</p>
            <p>Vaurien pauſed ſome minutes, then
raiſing his hands, exclaimed with energy,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:0063300902:307"/>
—"I appeal to heaven that I am not
ungenerous! This man, and no doubt
this woman, even at this moment, exiſt
on my bounty! Since he provokes the
diſcovery I have concealed, blame me not
for the confidence I have held religiouſly
inviolate. I will ſhew you his bond. All
this can be but a colluſion of the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
parties. As for this Charles he is no
where to be found; he has ſuddenly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appeared."</p>
            <p>He now ſhewed Emily the bond, which
was for five hundred pounds; as ſhe
looked on it, mingled ſenſations agitated;
the generous concealment of Vaurien
waked a beaming pleaſure in her eyes;
the ſilence, the connections, and the flight
of Charles gave a poignant reproach to
her heart; her face burned with indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
her eye ſoftened with delight; the
amiable character of Vaurien roſe to her
mind;—and when ſhe turned towards Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien,
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:0063300902:308"/>
ſhe gazed on an animated Adonis,
liſtened to tones that melodiſed her ſoul,
and was dazzled by eyes that melted with
their tendereſt fires. He threw himſelf
at her feet, confeſſed himſelf her adorer,
and moaned in ſuch deſpair at the treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery
and envy of Charles, that Emily, in
piteouſly liſtening, ſhed tears with the
tears of Vaurien.</p>
            <p>This was one of thoſe moments of
activity with the Gaul, in which his
genius inſtantaneouſly performed what
the ſlow conceptions of vulgar villains
could not have atchieved by repeated
deliberations. When he could force him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
to reſiſt the overflowing ſympathy of
the artleſs Emily, he had Charles imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
arreſted, and by a weighty bribe
gained over his keeper to deliver to him
any letters he might write. This done, he
forged a letter to Johnſon, in Charles's
hand-writing. Vaurien was expert in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting
hand, and at Naples his inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0063300902:309"/>
had once nearly been rewarded by
having his hand ſevered; but he had
timely decamped, preſerving, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument
of his art all it's former ſkill.
In this letter to Johnſon Charles was made
to inform him, that he was compelled
to quit the kingdom in haſte and trepi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation;
that hitherto he had played the
hypocrite; that his attachment to Mrs.
Wilſon had been of a very ancient ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
and had proved ruinous; and finally,
he deſired Johnſon would call on Vaurien,
to thank him for the conſiderable ſum he
owed him, but which he could never
repay.</p>
            <p>Johnſon read the letter with ſilent aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.
He examined and re-exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined.
Charles did not appear, and every
letter was evidently of his writing. He
haſtened to Vaurien and Emily; each
ſhared in the ſame aſtoniſhment. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
whoſe ſuſpicion had not entirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:0063300902:310"/>
him, ſcrupulouſly examined the
countenance of Vaurien; never man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
more poignantly afflicted. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed
little, and ſcarcely were his words
audible; a tear trickled on his cheek;
he wrung his hands; he looked ſometimes
on Emily, and ſometimes on Johnſon,
ſhook his head, and groaned.</p>
            <p>When Johnſon was quitting the houſe,
he heard of ſo many of Vaurien's liberali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties
to the domeſtics, that his ſpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
loan to Charles ceaſed to be extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary.
William told him, that had it
not been for Vaurien he ſhould not have
known what had become of his father's
ſoul, ſince without his generoſity it had
never reſted in church ground. A collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of mendicants was waiting at the
door to receive Vaurien's weekly ſtipend.
This man, thought Johnſon, muſt be
what he ſeems, and my national preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices
have injured him.</p>

            <p>THUS were affairs ſituated at the time
Vaurien's Newtonian ſyſtem was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed.
Charles in priſon was as melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly
as Jeremiah, forming lamentations
on modern friendſhips; and this Pythias
conceived himſelf betrayed by one Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,
and deſerted by another. Vaurien
perceived that the compaſs of his fate
was cloſing the circle it deſcribed, and
that the commemoration of Newton's
ſame ſeemed to be left entirely to the
planetary ſyſtem he had formed, and that
he, who had inſcribed his works on the
face of heaven muſt regard with a ſmile
the earthly celebrations of mortality.
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:0063300902:312"/>
Some friends of Lord Belfield had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed
his Lordſhip, that he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained
a dangerous adventurer; that
among the privileges of nobility was not
accounted that of an exemption from
impeachment; and, beſides, they aſſured
his Lordſhip, that his phyſicians were of
opinion that a change of climate was
abſolutely neceſſary for his health. His
Lordſhip, indeed, was of the ſame opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
not in reſpect to his health, which
he affirmed was vigorous, but to his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs,
which he acknowledged were diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered;
and the voice of a creditor is as awe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful
as that of a phyſician; they both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince
the patient that he can expect no
quiet unleſs he ſlies from their regular
attendance.</p>
            <p>Vaurien had now fixed the bias in the
ſenſitive heart of Emily, and he was anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipating
the moment of her fall. He had
conſulted with Lady Belfield, and the
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:0063300902:313"/>
boudoir of her ladyſhip had been ſelcted
as the altar on which the virgin victim
was to bleed.</p>
            <p>The great events of great men are go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned
by the ſame capricious influence
which directs the little events of little
men. The web of fate is woven by the
hand of fortune, and ſhe, induſtrious
yet indiſcriminate ſpinſter, takes the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual
ball from her baſket, and careleſs
works, now with threads of gold, and now
with damaged yarn. She weaves on our
fate, but makes no diſtinction of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonages.
The hero frequently envies the
bandit; for often the latter has found his
exiſtence to be a triumph over innocence,
while the former has periſhed in the act
of his injuſtice. Every thing in this
world ſeems good or ill fortune, and the
events of fortune are ſuſpended on the
ſlighteſt accidents; a plank immerges the
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:0063300902:314"/>
conſpirator into ſeas, ſtormy and profound
as his deſigns, in the hour of exultation,
and a pebble is ſlung into the head of
the giant in the hour of confidence.</p>
            <p>Lord Belfield was bitterly reproaching
Vaurien for his abortive and vaſt deſigns.
He had at length diſcovered that he was
a fertile tree, luxuriant in leaves, but void
of fruit; and complained much in the
ſtyle which a ruined lover of alchymy
would formerly have employed to ſome
beggarly gold-maker, who had promiſed
to roof and floor his apartments in the
Mexican faſhion, before the Spaniards ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived;
but after the multifarious induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try
of years, lo! a furnace had burſt with
a terrible exploſion, or at the very criſis,
the <hi>aurum potabile</hi> in the crucible was
whiſked down by a cat's tail. Great or
little cauſes, Vaurien averred, had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto
fruſtrated his comprehenſive ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem.
While they were computing, like
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:0063300902:315"/>
two Subtiles, what is evidence and what
is only equivalent to evidence, intelligence
was brought, that Meſſrs. Dragon and
Rant were arreſted for high-treaſon; a
quarter of an hour afterwards Monſieur
Vaurien received a note of epigrammatic
conciſeneſs from Mr. Dundas, without a
ſcotticiſm or a vulgariſm. It there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
that this hoſpitable country diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed
the Gaul, and in twenty-four hours
were the ſeas to receive Vaurien. A
breathleſs friend ruſhed in, to intreat his
Lordſhip to ſet off inſtantly on his tour
through Europe. "Your government
(obſerved Vaurien) are adopting Subtile's
ſyſtem of puniſhment; it makes us all
travellers. I have long been one. To
me the chances and the changes of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune
have by cuſtom an uniformity in
their varieties. My chimerical head has
conſidered Europe as the inheritance of
every ſublime politician in theſe periods
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:0063300902:316"/>
of revolution; but I fear that my ſhadow
will ever be reflected on the earth of my
neighbours, and never on my own."</p>
            <p>Vaurien was collected and intrepid,
and he would have been equally ſo had
the letter of Dundas been his Majeſty's
order, ſigned for his execution. Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates
and Hannibal carried about them
an antidote againſt poiſon; and had Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien
been now in modern Italy, he would
have continued the precaution which theſe
great men uſed in ancient Italy; but in
theſe northern climates he knew we only
poiſoned rats. What communicated this
intrepidity to the Gaul, was a perſuaſion
that he was born to ſuffer a public death.
What is inevitable, to a ſuperior mind
conveys no terror. Whether the philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher
was to be hanged, guillotined, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed,
broken on the wheel, or empaled,
he knew not, the mode entirely depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:0063300902:317"/>
on the cuſtoms of that country where
he was to make his final exit.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Eh, bien!</hi> (thought Vaurien, as he
was filling his portmanteau) the liberty
of theſe Britons is like a bottle of their
Port, locked in a glaſs beaufet; they ſee
it, and there it is—but only taſte it at
the option of their maſter, who keeps the
key at his own diſpoſal. Their liberty
will not intoxicate their heads. Here
the people ſubmit to the laws—damned fools!—the laws muſt be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
to the people—there ſhould be NO
LAWS at all, as Subtile ſays, and then, if
there were no laws, every thing would be
lawful.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Diable!</hi> (he exclaimed, as he lifted
his portmanteau) I carry nothing away
from this opulent country. I play my
cards ill. After all my ſhooting parties
with that ſchool-boy of Naples, he would
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:0063300902:318"/>
have ſpoiled my hand-writing for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery
on the Treaſury. Spain I loſt by
thoſe garlick-digeſting grandees, becauſe
I deſired to curtail their names. I miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took
the real number of my confederates
when I looked over my papers; as they
appeared in writing, I imagined every
ſingle man to be at leaſt ſix. I thought
I had an entire family when I diſcovered
I had only a hot-brained boy. The Pruſſian
idiot I had perſuaded, for I knew it would
win him, that he was an <hi>inviſible,</hi> an <hi>illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miné</hi>;
I uſed to tread on his feet, and then
entreat his pardon for my not being able to
ſee him. All my party did the ſame; his
Majeſty was buffetted about the whole
day, which quite flattered his powers of
<hi>inviſibility.</hi> The court of Berlin had been
our's, but for the miniſter, who, while he
received Engliſh money, perſiſted in aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring
his Majeſty that we were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtors,
and that his palpable obeſity was
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:0063300902:319"/>
not of ſo ſpiritual a kind, as ever to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape
the eye. Rome had been mine,
but for thoſe Cardinals who call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<hi>nephews</hi> of the Pope; but I found
that they were more accurate in calling
him their holy <hi>father.</hi> The Ottoman and
the Ruſſian empires are fair and open
fields; but they are too diſtant for the
moment. In America I have friends at
work, who will burn the place if they do
not ſucceed. There is no room for me.
I do not chuſe to be a hermit amid a
hundred thouſand acres. The Dutch are
near—ſanguinary and unfeeling I knew
the boors were; but little imagined that
thoſe unwieldly porpoiſes, ſleeping in ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated
water, ſhould ever leap out to frolic
with uncouth airineſs to the national tune
of the Marſeillois hymn.</p>
            <p>"But, the poſſeſſion of Emily I have
miſſed for a ſingle day! A kingdom I
can always diſcover, but a child of love
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:0063300902:320"/>
and nature kingdoms may not preſent.
Charles remains in priſon. From either
I derive no further benefit, and I wiſh no
being unhappy who impedes not my
political views."—He now took his
pen, and addreſſed the following letter to
Emily.</p>
            <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">

                  </opener>
                  <p>When you receive this letter, Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rien
is on the ſeas. Here my projects
are concluded, and the ſole paſſion that
now occupies my thoughts is my bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.</p>
                  <p>You have eſcaped, ſweet bird of
love! but in the depths of night the
lights were placed, and the net Lady
Belfield and myſelf have long woven
was at this moment to have cloſed on
you. Child of nature, and woman of
beauty! your unſuſpicious innocence was
the magic that attracted, and the magic
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:0063300902:321"/>
that would have precipitated your ruin.
I have already proved ſeductive to your
mind; and the mind of an accompliſhed
woman (a mere creature made up of ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
and ſenſibility) when once poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed,
is ſecuring a party in the fortreſs,
who will ſoon be too ſtrong for any oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
at the outworks.</p>
                  <p>Nature has been prodigal to me,
but art has even exceeded her liberalities.
Had I lived in England, I had rendered
you the moſt miſerable of your ſex; but
ſince I am baniſhed from it, I will render
you the moſt happy.</p>
                  <p>All that I have inſinuated relative to
Charles and Mrs. Wilſon is a foul inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
of too common a kind to have coſt
me any difficulty. Domeſtic treaſons are
beneath me; it is only national treaſons
which I feel as my genius, and conſider
as my glory. My dear girl, in this head
of mine revolve all the cabinet ſecrets of
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:0063300902:322"/>
Europe; Monarchs I have deceived,
Dukes I have ruined, and Miniſters I
have embarraſſed. You now perceive
I claim no merit in having deluded a
country lad and laſs.</p>
                  <p>Are you not ſurpriſed at my <hi>gaieté de
coeur?</hi> What, you conceive me at this
moment, immerſed in thought, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded
by diſappointment! It is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely
at moments like this, when I am
engaged in no particular project, that,
free from politics, I feel myſelf, and act
the man. With you I have ever been
ſerious and ſentimental; yet, could you
have <hi>then</hi> liſtened to my converſations
with her Ladyſhip, if your eyes had had
intelligence, I aſſure you our faces were too
frequently moſt impolitical; but I truſted
in your boundleſs ſimplicity, as you confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded
in my boundleſs art. You have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
no conception of my character. You
have often ſaid, we feel more than we
expreſs; but I expreſs more than I feel.
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:0063300902:323"/>
That is all art! <hi>Il faut toujours peindre
en beau,</hi> whether in love or in politics.
The humane, the ſenſitive, the ſublime
Vaurien (with ſuch glorious titles have
you proudly decorated my name) if he
has any ſuperior talent, it lies towards the
ſarcaſtic, the cauſtic, and the malicious.</p>
                  <p>You now imagine me to be a villain—I am ſo; and with my national vanity,
I think I am a GREAT villain—I abhor
vulgarity, even in villainy.</p>
                  <p>But do not here tear this letter with
indignation. You muſt know all of
Vaurien ere you execrate him—and then
I dare you to hate him.</p>
                  <p>The moment I diſcovered that John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
was ruining all my ſchemes, I reſolved
to deceive that ſtern and ſuſpicious An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glican.
Some little merit was in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception,
for it required my boldeſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion.
When I quitted you I arreſted
Charles; I had lent him the money that
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:0063300902:324"/>
I might command him at all times, well
knowing he could never repay me. I forged
the letter which Johnſon received. All
Charles's letters were delivered to me.
The ſimple youth is at this moment moan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
over the perfidy of modern friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips,
and the coquetry of modern
loves.</p>
                  <p>I am not now rich, yet I can be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous.
There are human ſharks, or Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don
cannibals, who would give money
for any legal inſtrument. A bond, you
may tell Charles, is no trifle; he ſigned
it as careleſsly as if it had been a private
memorandum; it is a public one. With
this you receive it; take it yourſelf to
him in the Fleet. Let him receive his
freedom and his fortune from the hand
he adores. I wiſh it had been more, for
it was not money of mine. Let him poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs
his Emily; yet I write the words with
a pang in my heart. Shew him this
<pb n="322" facs="tcp:0063300902:325"/>
letter, and let it's ſecrets periſh between
you. There aſſure him that his Emily is
a precious caſket, whoſe gems have been
unrifled, although a robber had already
poſſeſſed a falſe key. Hundreds like
yourſelves I have injured; many an honeſt
Charles I have met, but never in ſo ſoft
a form, a ſoul more chaſte, and a mind
more exquiſite.—Adorable Emily! you
are ſomething more than woman, and yet
are all woman; ſomething that the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination
gazes on with delight, yet awe;
taſte is ſilent when it would deſcribe you,
and in memory only you are viewed with
your ſingular excellence.</p>
