            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>AN ESSAY ON HOMER's Battels.</head>
            <p>PERHAPS it may be neceſſary in this Place at the Opening of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Battels, to premiſe ſome Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon them in general. I ſhall firſt endeavour to ſhew the <hi>Conduct</hi> of the Poet herein, and next collect ſome <hi>Antiquities,</hi> that tend to a more diſtinct under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of thoſe Deſcriptions which make ſo large a Part of the Poem.</p>
            <p>One may very well apply to <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf what he ſays of his Heroes at the end of the fourth Book, that whoſoever ſhould be guided thro' their Battels by <hi>Minerva,</hi> and pointed to every Scene of them, would ſee nothing through the whole but Subjects of Surprize and Applauſe. When the Reader re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects that no leſs than the Compaſs of twelve Books is taken up in theſe, he will have Reaſon to wonder by what Methods our Author could prevent Deſcriptions of ſuch a length from being tedious. It is not enough to ſay, that tho' the Subject itſelf be the ſame, the Actions are always different; That we have now diſtinct Combates, now promiſcuous Fights, now ſingle Duels, now general Engagements: Or that the Scenes are perpetually vary'd; we are now in the Fields, now at the Fortification of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> now at the Ships, now at the Gates
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:0356100102:3"/>
of <hi>Troy,</hi> now at the River <hi>Scamander:</hi> But we muſt look far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther into the Art of the Poet to find the Reaſons of this aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Variety.</p>
            <p>We may firſt obſerve that <hi>Diverſity</hi> in the <hi>Deaths</hi> of his <hi>Warriors,</hi> which he has ſupply'd by the vaſteſt Fertility of Invention that ever was. Theſe he diſtinguiſhes ſeveral ways: Sometimes by the <hi>Characters</hi> of the Men, their <hi>Age, Office, Profeſſion, Nation, Family,</hi> &amp;c. One is a blooming <hi>Youth,</hi> whoſe Father diſſuaded him from the War; one is a <hi>Prieſt</hi> whoſe Piety could not ſave him; one is a <hi>Sportſman</hi> whom <hi>Diana</hi> taught in vain; one is the <hi>Native</hi> of a far-diſtant <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try</hi> who is never to return; one is deſcended from a Noble <hi>Line</hi> which ends in his Death; one is made remarkable by his <hi>Boaſting;</hi> another by his <hi>Beſeeching;</hi> and another who is diſtinguiſh'd no way elſe is mark'd by his <hi>Habit</hi> and the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity of his Armor.</p>
            <p>Sometimes he varies theſe Deaths by the ſeveral <hi>Poſtures</hi> in which his Heroes are repreſented either fighting or falling. Some of theſe are ſo exceedingly <hi>exact,</hi> that one may gueſs from the very Poſition of the Combatant, whereabouts the Wound will light: Others ſo very <hi>peculiar</hi> and <hi>uncommon,</hi> that they could only be the Effect of an Imagination which had ſearch'd thro' all the Ideas of Nature. Such is that Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cture of <hi>Mydon</hi> in the fifth Book, whoſe Arm being numb'd by a blow on the Elbow, drops the Reins that trail on the Ground; and then being ſuddenly ſtruck on the Temples falls headlong from the Chariot in a ſoft and deep Place; where he ſinks up to the Shoulders in the Sands, and continues a while fix'd by the Weight of his Armor, with his Legs quivering in the Air, 'till he is trampled down by his Horſes.</p>
            <p>Another Cauſe of this Variety is the Difference of the <hi>Wounds</hi> that are given in the Ilaid: They are by no means like the Wounds deſcribed by moſt other Poets, which are commonly made in the ſelf-ſame obvious Places: The Heart and Head ſerve for all thoſe in general who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand no Anatomy, and ſometimes for Variety they kill Men by Wounds that are no where mortal but in their Poems. As the whole human Body is the Subject of theſe, ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is more neceſſary to him who would deſcribe them
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:0356100102:4"/>
well, than a thorough Knowledge of its Structure; even tho' the Poet is not profeſſedly to write of them as an Anatomiſt; in the ſame manner as an exact Skill in Anatomy is neceſſary to thoſe Painters that would excel in drawing the Naked, tho' they are not to make every Muſcle as viſible as in a Book of Chirurgery. It appears from ſo many Paſſages in <hi>Homer</hi> that he was perfectly Maſter of this Science, that it would be need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to cite any in particular. One may only obſerve, that if we thoroughly examine all the Wounds he has deſcribed, tho' ſo infinite in Number, and ſo many ways diverſify'd, we ſhall hardly find one which will contradict this Obſervation.</p>
            <p>I muſt juſt add a Remark, that the various Periphraſes and Circumlocutions by which <hi>Homer</hi> expreſſes the ſingle Act of <hi>Dying,</hi> have ſupply'd <hi>Virgil</hi> and the ſucceeding Poets with all their manners of phraſing it. Indeed he repeats the ſame Verſe on that Occaſion more often than they—<gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But tho' it muſt be owned he had more frequent Occaſions for a Line of this Kind than any Poet, as no other has deſcrib'd half ſo many Deaths, yet one cannot aſcribe this to any Sterility of Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but to the Genius of his Times, that delighted in thoſe reiterated Verſes. We find Repetitions of the ſame ſort affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by the ſacred Writers, ſuch as <hi>He was gathered to his People; He ſlept with his Fathers,</hi> and the like. And upon the whole they have a certain antiquated Harmony not unlike the Burthen of a Song, which the Ear is willing to ſuffer, and as it were reſts upon.</p>
            <p>As the perpetual Horror of Combates, and a Succeſſion of Images of Death, could not but keep the Imagination very much on the ſtretch; <hi>Homer</hi> has been careful to contrive ſuch Reliefs and Pauſes as might divert the Mind to ſome other Scene, without loſing Sight of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Object. His <hi>Compariſons</hi> are the more frequent on this Account; for a <hi>Compariſon</hi> ſerves this End the moſt effectually of any thing, as it is at once correſpondent to, and differing from the Subject. Thoſe Criticks who fancy that the Uſe of Compariſons diſtracts the Attention, and draws it from the firſt Image which ſhould moſt employ it (as that we loſe the Idea of the Battel itſelf, while we are led by a Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:0356100102:5"/>
to that of a Deluge or a Storm:) Thoſe, I ſay, may as well imagine we loſe the Thought of the Sun, when we ſee his Reflection in the Water; where he appears more diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and is contemplated more at eaſe than if we gaz'd direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at his Beams. For 'tis with the Eye of the Imagination as with our corporeal Eye, it muſt ſometimes be taken off from the Object in order to ſee in the better. The ſame Criticks that are diſpleaſed to have their Fancy diſtracted (as they call it) are yet ſo inconſiſtent with themſelves as to object to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> that his Similes are too much alike, and are too often derived from the ſame Animal. But is it not more reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble (according to their own Notion) to compare the ſame Man always to the ſame Animal, than to ſee him ſometimes a Sun, ſometimes a Tree, and ſometimes a River? Tho' <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> ſpeaks of the ſame Creature, he ſo diverſifies the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and Accidents of the Compariſons, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways appear quite different. And to ſay Truth, it is not ſo much the Animal or the Thing, as the Action or Poſture of them, that employs our Imagination: Two different Animals in the ſame Action are more like to each other, than one and the ſame Animal is to himſelf, in two different Actions. And thoſe who in reading <hi>Homer</hi> are ſhock'd that 'tis always a <hi>Lion,</hi> may as well be angry that 'tis always a <hi>Man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What may ſeem more exceptionable is his inſerting the ſame Compariſons in the ſame Words at length upon different Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by which Management he makes one ſingle Image afford many Ornaments to ſeveral Parts of the Poem. But may not one ſay <hi>Homer</hi> is in this like a skilful Improver, who pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces a beautiful Statue in a well-diſpoſed Garden ſo as to anſwer ſeveral Viſtas, and by that Artifice one ſingle Figure ſeems multiply'd into as many Objects as there are Openings from whence it may be viewed?</p>
            <p>What farther relieves and ſoftens theſe Deſcriptions of Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels, is the Poet's wonderful Art of introducing many pathetick Circumſtances about the Deaths of the Heroes, which raiſe a different Movement in the Mind from what thoſe Images na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally inſpire, I mean Compaſſion and Pity; when he cauſes us to look back upon the loſt Riches, Poſſeſſions, and Hopes of thoſe who die: When he tranſports us to their Native
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:0356100102:6"/>
Countries and Paternal Seats, to ſee the Griefs of their aged Fathers, the Deſpair and Tears of their Widows, or the aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd Condition of their Orphans. Thus when <hi>Proteſilaus</hi> falls, we are made to reflect on the lofty Palaces he left half finiſh'd; when the Sons of <hi>Phenops</hi> are killed, we behold the mortifying Diſtreſs of their wealthy Father, who ſaw his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate divided before his Eyes, and taken in Truſt for Strangers. When <hi>Axylus</hi> dies, we are taught to compaſſionate the hard Fate of that generous and hoſpitable Man, whoſe Houſe was the Houſe of all Men, and who deſerv'd that glorious Elogy of, <hi>The Friend of Human-kind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is worth taking Notice too, what Uſe <hi>Homer</hi> every where makes of each little Accident or Circumſtance that can natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally happen in a Battel, thereby to caſt a Variety over his Action; as well as of every Turn of Mind or Emotion a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro can poſſibly feel, ſuch as Reſentment, Revenge, Concern, Confuſion, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The former of theſe makes his Work re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble a large Hiſtory-Piece, where even the leſs important Figures and Actions have yet ſome convenient Place or Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to be ſhewn in; and the latter gives it all the Advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Tragedy in thoſe various Turns of Paſſion that animate the Speeches of his Heroes, and render his whole Poem the moſt <hi>Dramatick</hi> of any Epick whatſoever.</p>
            <p>It muſt alſo be obſerv'd that the conſtant <hi>Machines</hi> of the <hi>Gods</hi> conduce very greatly to vary theſe long Battels, by a continual Change of the Scene from Earth to Heaven. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> perceiv'd them too neceſſary for this Purpoſe to abſtain from the Uſe of them, even after <hi>Jupiter</hi> had enjoin'd the Deities not to Act on either ſide. It is remarkable how many Methods he has found to draw them into every Book; where if they dare not aſſiſt the Warriors, at leaſt they are very helpful to the Poet.</p>
            <p>But there is nothing that more contributes to the Variety, Surprize, and <hi>Eclat</hi> of <hi>Homer</hi>'s Battels, or is more perfectly admirable in itſelf, than that artful Manner of taking Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or (as one may ſay) <hi>Gaging</hi> his Heroes by each other, and thereby elevating the Character of one Perſon by the Oppoſition of it to that of ſome other whom he is made to excell. So that he many times deſcribes one only to image
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:0356100102:7"/>
another, and raiſes one only to raiſe another. I cannot bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter exemplify this Remark, than by giving an Inſtance in the Character of <hi>Diomed</hi> that lies before me. Let us obſerve by what a Scale of Oppoſitions he elevates this Hero, in the fifth Book, firſt to excell all human Valour, and after to rival the Gods themſelves. He diſtinguiſhes him firſt from the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian</hi> Captains in general, each of whom he repreſents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering a ſingle <hi>Trojan,</hi> while <hi>Diomed</hi> conſtantly encounters two at once; and while they are engag'd each in his diſtinct Poſt, he only is drawn fighting in every quarter, and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering on every ſide. Next he oppoſes him to <hi>Pandarus,</hi> next to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> and then to <hi>Hector.</hi> So of the Gods he ſhews him firſt againſt <hi>Venus,</hi> then <hi>Apollo,</hi> then <hi>Mars,</hi> and laſtly in the eighth Book againſt <hi>Jupiter</hi> himſelf in the midſt of his Thunders. The ſame Conduct is obſervable more or leſs in regard to every Perſonage of his Work.</p>
            <p>This Subordination of the Heroes is one of the Cauſes that make each of his Battels riſe above the other in Greatneſs, Terror, and Importance, to the end of the Poem. If <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med</hi> has perform'd all theſe Wonders in the firſt Combates, it is but to raiſe <hi>Hector,</hi> at whoſe Appearance he begins to fear. If in the next Battels <hi>Hector</hi> triumphs not only over <hi>Diomed,</hi> but over <hi>Ajax</hi> and <hi>Patroclus,</hi> ſets fire to the Fleet, wins the Armor of <hi>Achilles,</hi> and ſingly eclipſes all the Heroes; in the midſt of all this Glory, <hi>Achilles</hi> appears, <hi>Hector</hi> flies, and is ſlain.</p>
            <p>The Manner in which his Gods are made to act, no leſs advances the Gradation we are ſpeaking of. In the firſt Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tels they are ſeen only in ſhort and ſeparate Excurſions: <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> aſſiſts <hi>Paris, Minerva Diomed,</hi> or <hi>Mars Hector.</hi> In the next a clear Stage is left for <hi>Jupiter,</hi> to diſplay his Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence and turn the Fate of Armies alone. In the laſt, all the Powers of Heaven are let down and banded into regular Parties, Gods encountring Gods, <hi>Jove</hi> encouraging them with his Thunders, <hi>Neptune</hi> raiſing his Tempeſts, Heaven flaming, Earth trembling, and <hi>Pluto</hi> himſelf ſtarting from the Throne of Hell.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:0356100102:8"/>
I AM now to take Notice of ſome Cuſtoms of Antiquity, relating to the Arms and Art Military of thoſe Times, which are proper to be known in order to form a right Notion of our Author's Deſcriptions of War.</p>
            <p>That <hi>Homer</hi> copied the Manners and Cuſtoms of the Age he writ of, rather than of that he lived in, has been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in ſome Inſtances. As that he no where repreſents <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry</hi> or <hi>Trumpets</hi> to have been uſed in the <hi>Trojan</hi> Wars, tho' they apparently were in his own Time. It is not therefore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible but there may be found in his Works ſome Deficiencies in the Art of War, which are not to be imputed to his Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance, but to his Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Horſes</hi> had not been brought into <hi>Greece</hi> long before the Siege of <hi>Troy.</hi> They were originally Eaſtern Animals, and if we find at that very Period ſo great a Number of them reckon'd up in the Wars of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> it is the leſs a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſidering they came from <hi>Aſia.</hi> The Practice of riding them was ſo little known in <hi>Greece</hi> a few Years before, that they look'd upon the <hi>Centaurs</hi> who firſt uſed it, as Monſters compounded of Men and Horſes. <hi>Neſtor</hi> in the firſt <hi>Iliad</hi> ſays he had ſeen theſe <hi>Centaurs</hi> in his Youth, and <hi>Polypaetes</hi> in the ſecond is ſaid to have been born on the Day that his Father expelled them from <hi>Pelion</hi> to the Deſarts of <hi>Aethica.</hi> They had no other Uſe of Horſes than to draw their Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ots in Battel, ſo that whenever <hi>Homer</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>fighting from an Horſe, taming an Horſe,</hi> or the like, it is conſtantly to be underſtood of fighting from a Chariot, or taming Horſes to that Service. This (as we have ſaid) was a piece of Deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum in the Poet; for in his own Time they were arrived to ſuch a Perfection in Horſemanſhip, that in the fifteenth <hi>Iliad</hi> ℣. 680. we have a <hi>Simile</hi> taken from an extraordinary Feat of Activity, where one Man manages four Horſes at once, and leaps from the Back of one to another at full Speed.</p>
            <p>If we conſider in what high Eſteem among Warriors theſe noble Animals muſt have been at their firſt coming into <hi>Greece,</hi> we ſhall the leſs wonder at the frequent Occaſions <hi>Homer</hi> has taken to deſcribe and celebrate them. It is not ſo ſtrange to find them ſet almoſt upon a level with Men, at
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:0356100102:9"/>
the time when a <hi>Horſe</hi> in the Prizes was of equal Value with a <hi>Captive.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Chariots</hi> were in all Probability very low. For we fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently find in the <hi>Iliad,</hi> that a Perſon who ſtands erect on a Chariot is killed (and ſometimes by a Stroke on the Head) by a Foot-Soldier with a Sword. This may farther appear from the Eaſe and Readineſs with which they alight or mount on every Occaſion, to facilitate which, the Chariots were made open behind. That the Wheels were but ſmall, may be gueſt from a Cuſtom they had of taking them off and ſetting them on, as they were laid by, or made uſe of. <hi>Hebe</hi> in the fifth Book puts on the Wheels of <hi>Juno</hi>'s Chariot when ſhe calls for it in haſte. And it ſeems to be with Alluſion to the ſame Practice that it is ſaid in <hi>Exodus</hi> Ch. 14. <hi>The Lord took off their Chariot Wheels, ſo that they drove them heavily.</hi> The Sides were alſo low; for whoever is killed in his Chariot throughout the Poem, conſtantly falls to the Ground as having nothing to ſupport him. That the whole Machine was very ſmall and light, is evident from a Paſſage in the tenth <hi>Iliad,</hi> where <hi>Diomed</hi> having taken a Chariot, debates whether he ſhall draw it out of the way, or carry it on his Shoulders to a Place of Safety. All theſe Particulars agree with the Repreſentations of the Chariots on the moſt ancient <hi>Greek</hi> Coins; where the Tops of them reach not ſo high as the Backs of the Horſes, the Wheels are yet lower, and the Heroes who ſtand in them are ſeen from the Knee upwards. <note n="*" place="bottom">See the Collection of <hi>Goltzius, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note>This may ſerve to ſhew thoſe Criticks are under a Miſtake, who blame <hi>Homer</hi> for making his Warriors ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times retire behind their Chariots, as if it were a Piece of Cowardice: which was as little diſgraceful then, as it is now to alight from one's Horſe in a Battel on any neceſſary Emergency.</p>
            <p>There were generally two Perſons in each Chariot, one of whom was wholly employ'd in guiding the Horſes. They uſed indifferently two, three, or four Horſes: From hence it happens, that ſometimes when a Horſe is killed, the Hero continues the Fight with the two or more that remain; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:0356100102:10"/>
at other times a Warrior retreats upon the Loſs of one; not that he has leſs Courage than the other, but that he has fewer Horſes.</p>
            <p>Their <hi>Swords</hi> were all broad cutting Swords, for we find they never ſtab but with their Spears. The <hi>Spears</hi> were uſed two ways, either to puſh with, or to caſt from them, like the miſſive Javelins. It ſeems ſurprizing that a Man ſhould throw a Dart or Spear with ſuch Force as to pierce thro' both ſides of the Armor and the Body (as is often deſcribed in <hi>Homer.</hi>) For if the Strength of the Men was Gigantick, the Armor muſt have been ſtrong in Proportion. Some Solution might be given for this, if we imagin'd the Armor was ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Braſs, and the Weapons pointed with Iron; and if we could fancy that <hi>Homer</hi> call'd the Spears and Swords <hi>Brazen</hi> in the ſame manner that he calls the Reins of a Bridle <hi>Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> only from the Ornaments about them. But there are Paſſages where the Point of the Spear is expreſſly ſaid to be of Braſs, as in the Deſcription of that of <hi>Hector</hi> in <hi>Iliad</hi> 6. ℣. 320. <hi>Pauſanias</hi> in <hi>Laconicis</hi> takes it for granted, that the Arms, as well offenſive as defenſive, were Braſs. He ſays the Spear of <hi>Achilles</hi> was kept in his Time in the Temple of <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva,</hi> the Top and Point of which were of Braſs; and the Sword of <hi>Meriones,</hi> in that of <hi>Aeſculapius</hi> among the <hi>Nicome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> was entirely of the ſame Metal. But be it as it will, there are Examples even at this Day of ſuch a prodigious Force in caſting Darts, as almoſt exceeds Credibility. The <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Arabs</hi> will pierce thro' thick Planks with Darts of harden'd Wood; which can only be attributed to their being bred (as the Ancients were) to that Exerciſe, and to the Strength and Agility acquir'd by a conſtant Practice of it.</p>
            <p>We may aſcribe to the ſame Cauſe their Power of caſting <hi>Stones</hi> of a vaſt Weight, which appears a common Practice in theſe Battels. Thoſe are in a great Error, who imagine this to be only a fictitious Embelliſhment of the Poet, which was one of the Exerciſes of War among the ancient <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Orientals.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mos eſt in Urbibus Paleſtinae, &amp; uſque hodie per omnem Judaeam vetus conſuetudo ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vatur, ut in viculis, oppidis, &amp; caſtellis rotundi ponantur lapides graviſſimi ponderis, ad quos juvenes exercere ſe ſolent, &amp; eos pro varietate virium ſublevare, alii ad genua, alii ad umbilicum, alii ad humeros, ad caput, non nulli ſuper verticem, rectis junctiſque manibus, magnitudinem virium demonſtrantes, pondus attollunt.</note>St. <hi>Jerome</hi> tells us, it was an old Cuſtom in
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:0356100102:11"/>
               <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and in Uſe in his own Time, to have round Stones of a great Weight kept in the Caſtles and Villages for the Youth to try their Strength with. And the Cuſtom is yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant in ſome Parts of <hi>Scotland,</hi> where Stones for the ſame Purpoſe are laid at the Gates of great Houſes, which they call <hi>Putting-Stones.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Another Conſideration which will account for many things that may ſeem uncouth in <hi>Homer,</hi> is the Reflection that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Uſe of <hi>Fire-Arms</hi> there was infinitely more Scope for perſonal Valor than in the modern Battels. Now whenſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the perſonal Strength of the Combatants happen'd to be unequal, the declining a ſingle Combate could not be ſo diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honourable as it is in this Age, when the Arms we make uſe of put all Men on a level. For a Soldier of far inferior Strength may manage a Rapier or Fire-Arms ſo expertly as to be an Overmatch to his Adverſary. This may appear a ſufficient Excuſe for what in the modern Conſtruction might ſeem Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice in <hi>Homer</hi>'s Heroes, when they avoid engaging with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers whoſe bodily Strength exceeds their own. The Maxims of Valor in all Times were founded upon Reaſon, and the Cowardice ought rather in this Caſe to be imputed to him who braves his Inferior. There was alſo more <hi>Leiſure</hi> in their Battels before the Knowledge of Fire-Arms; and this in a good Degree accounts for thoſe Harangues his Heroes make to each other in the Time of Combate.</p>
            <p>There was another Practice frequently uſed by theſe ancient Warriors, which was to ſpoil an Enemy of his Arms after they had ſlain him; and this Cuſtom we ſee them frequently purſuing with ſuch Eagerneſs as if they look'd on their Victory not complete 'till this Point was gain'd. Some modern Criticks have accuſed them of Avarice on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this Practice, which might probably ariſe from the great Value and Scarceneſs of Armor in that early Time and Infancy of War. It afterwards became a Point of Honour like gaining a Standard from the Enemy. <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>David</hi> ſpeak of the Pleaſure of obtaining many Spoils. They preſerv'd them as Monuments of Victory, and even Religion at laſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came intereſted herein, when thoſe Spoils were conſecrated in the Temples of the Tutelar Deities of the Conqueror.</p>

The Reader may eaſily ſee I ſet down theſe Heads juſt as they occur to my Memory, and only as Hints to farther Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; which any one who is converſant in <hi>Homer</hi> can not fail to make, if he will but think a little in the ſame Track.</p>
            <p>It is no Part of my Deſign to enquire what Progreſs had been made in the Art of War at this early Period: The bare Peruſal of the Iliad will beſt inform us of it. But what I think tends more immediately to the better Comprehenſion of theſe Deſcriptions, is to give a ſhort View of the Scene of War, the Situation of <hi>Troy,</hi> and thoſe Places which <hi>Homer</hi> mentions, with the proper Field of each Battel: Putting to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for this Purpoſe thoſe Paſſages in my Author that give any Light to this Matter.</p>
            <p>The ancient City of <hi>Troy</hi> ſtood at a greater Diſtance from the Sea than thoſe Ruins which have ſince been ſhewn for it. This may be gather'd from Iliad 5. ℣. (of the Original) 791. where it is ſaid that the <hi>Trojans</hi> never durſt ſally out of the <hi>Walls</hi> of their Town 'till the Retirement of <hi>Achilles,</hi> but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards combated the <hi>Grecians</hi> at their very Ships, <hi>far from the City.</hi> For had <hi>Troy</hi> ſtood (as <hi>Strabo</hi> obſerves) ſo nigh the <hi>Sea-ſhore,</hi> it had been Madneſs in the <hi>Greeks</hi> not to have built any Fortification before their Fleet till the tenth Year of the Siege, when the Enemy was ſo near them: And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, it had been Cowardice in the <hi>Trojans</hi> not to have attempted any thing all that time, againſt an Army that lay unfortify'd and unintrench'd. Beſides the intermediate Space had been too ſmall to afford a Field for ſo many various Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures and Actions of War. The Places about <hi>Troy</hi> parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly mentioned by <hi>Homer</hi> lie in this Order.<list>
                  <item>1. The <hi>Scaean Gate:</hi> This open'd to the Field of Battel, and was that thro' which the <hi>Trojans</hi> made their Excurſions. Cloſe to this ſtood the <hi>Beech-Tree</hi> ſacred to <hi>Jupiter,</hi> which <hi>Homer</hi> generally mentions with it.</item>
                  <item>2. The <hi>Hill</hi> of <hi>wild Fig-trees.</hi> It join'd to the Walls of <hi>Troy</hi> on one ſide, and extended to the High-way on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The firſt appears from what <hi>Andromache</hi> ſays in Iliad 6. ℣. 432. that <hi>the Walls were in danger of being ſcaled from this Hill;</hi> and the laſt from Il. 22. ℣. 145. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <item>4. <hi>Callicolone,</hi> the Name of a pleaſant Hill, that lay near the River <hi>Simois,</hi> on the other ſide of the Town. <hi>Il.</hi> 20. ℣. 53.</item>
                  <item>5. <hi>Bateia,</hi> or the Sepulchre of <hi>Myrinne,</hi> ſtood a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the City in the Plain. <hi>Il.</hi> 2. ℣. 318. <hi>of the Catal.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>IT ſeems, by the 465<hi>th</hi> Verſe of the ſecond Iliad, that the <hi>Grecian</hi> Army was drawn up under the ſeveral Leaders by the Banks of <hi>Scamander</hi> on that ſide toward the Ships: In the mean time that of <hi>Troy</hi> and the Auxiliaries was rang'd in Order at <hi>Myrinne</hi>'s Sepulchre. <hi>Ibid.</hi> ℣. 320 <hi>of the Catal.</hi> The Place of the <hi>Firſt Battel</hi> where <hi>Diomed</hi> performs his Exploits, was near the joining of <hi>Simois</hi> and <hi>Scamander;</hi> for <hi>Juno</hi> and <hi>Pallas</hi> coming to him, alight at the Confluence of thoſe Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers. <hi>Il.</hi> 5. ℣. 776. and that the <hi>Greeks</hi> had not yet paſt the Stream, but fought on that ſide next the Fleet, appears from ℣. 791 of the ſame Book, where <hi>Juno</hi> ſays <hi>the</hi> Trojans <hi>now brave them at their very Ships.</hi> But in the beginning of the ſixth Book, the Place of Battel is ſpecify'd to be between the Rivers of <hi>Simois</hi> and <hi>Scamander;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Greeks</hi> (tho' <hi>Homer</hi> does not particularize when, or in what manner) had then croſs'd the Stream toward <hi>Troy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Engagement in the eighth Book is evidently cloſe to the <hi>Grecian</hi> Fortification on the Shore. That Night <hi>Hector</hi> lay at <hi>Ilus</hi>'s Tomb in the Field, as <hi>Dolon</hi> tells us <hi>Lib.</hi> 10. ℣. 415. And in the eleventh Book the Battel is chiefly about <hi>Ilus</hi>'s Tomb.</p>
            <p>In the twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth, about the Fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and in the fifteenth at the <hi>Ships.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the ſixteenth, the <hi>Trojans</hi> being repulſed by <hi>Patroclus,</hi> they engage between the Fleet, the River, and the <hi>Grecian</hi> Wall: See ℣. 396. <hi>Patroclus</hi> ſtill advancing they fight at the Gates of <hi>Troy</hi> ℣. 700. In the ſeventeenth the Fight about the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:0356100102:14"/>
Body of <hi>Patroclus</hi> is under the <hi>Trojan</hi> Wall ℣. 403. His Body being carried off, <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> purſue the <hi>Greeks</hi> to the Fortification ℣. 760. And in the eighteenth, upon <hi>Achilles</hi>'s appearing, they retire and encamp without the Fortification.</p>
            <p>In the twentieth, the Fight is ſtill on that ſide next the Sea; for the <hi>Trojans</hi> being purſued by <hi>Achilles,</hi> paſs over the <hi>Scamander</hi> as they run toward <hi>Troy:</hi> See the beginning of Book 21.

ſooner retired, but <hi>Homer</hi> raiſes his other <hi>Greeks</hi> to ſupply his Abſence; like Stars that ſhine each in his due Revolution, till the principal Hero riſes again, and eclipſes all others. As <hi>Diomed</hi> is the firſt in this Office, he ſeems to have more of the Character of <hi>Achilles</hi> than any beſides. He has naturally an Exceſs of Boldneſs and too much Fury in his Temper, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and intrepid like the other, and running after Gods or Men promiſcuouſly as they offer themſelves. But what differences his Character is, that he is ſoon reclaim'd by Advice, hears thoſe that are more experienced, and in a word, obeys <hi>Minerva</hi> in all things. He is aſſiſted by the Patroneſs of Wiſdom and Arms, as he is eminent both for Prudence and Valor. That which characterizes his Prudence is a quick Sagacity and Preſence of Mind in all Emergencies, and an undiſturb'd Readineſs in the very Article of Danger. And what is particular in his Valor is agreeable to theſe Qualities; his Actions being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways performed with remarkable Dexterity, Activity, and Diſpatch. As the gentle and manageable Turn of his Mind ſeems drawn with an Oppoſition to the boiſterous Temper of <hi>Achilles,</hi> ſo his bodily Excellencies ſeem deſign'd as in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſte to thoſe of <hi>Ajax,</hi> who appears with great Strength, but heavy and unwieldy. As he is forward to act in the Field, ſo is he ready to ſpeak in the Council: But 'tis obſervable that his Counſels ſtill incline to War, and are byaſs'd rather on the ſide of Bravery than Caution. Thus he adviſes to reject the Propoſals of the <hi>Trojans</hi> in the ſeventh Book, and not to accept of <hi>Helen</hi> her ſelf, tho' <hi>Paris</hi> ſhould offer her. In the ninth, he oppoſes <hi>Agamemnon</hi>'s Propoſition to return to <hi>Greece,</hi> in ſo ſtrong a manner, as to declare he will ſtay and continue the Siege himſelf, if the General ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part. And thus he hears without Concern <hi>Achilles</hi>'s Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal of a Reconciliation, and doubts not to be able to carry on the War without him. As for his private Character, he appears a gallant Lover of Hoſpitality in his Behaviour to <hi>Glaucus</hi> in the ſixth Book; a Lover of Wiſdom in his Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of <hi>Neſtor</hi> in the eighth, and his Choice of <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company him in the tenth; upon the whole, an open ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Friend, and a generous Enemy.</p>

The wonderful Actions he performs in this Battel, ſeem to be the Effect of a noble Reſentment at the Reproach he had receiv'd from <hi>Agamemnon</hi> in the foregoing Book, to which theſe Deeds are the Anſwer. He becomes immediately the ſecond Hero of <hi>Greece,</hi> and dreaded equally with <hi>Achilles</hi> by the <hi>Trojans.</hi> At the firſt Sight of him his Enemies make a Queſtion, Whether he is a Man or a God? <hi>Aeneas</hi> and <hi>Pandarus</hi> go againſt him, whoſe Approach terrifies <hi>Sthenelus,</hi> and the Apprehenſion of ſo great a Warrior marvellouſly exalts the Intrepidity of <hi>Diomed. Aeneas</hi> himſelf is not ſav'd but by the interpoſing of a Deity: He purſues and wounds that Deity, and <hi>Aeneas</hi> again eſcapes only by the Help of a ſtronger Power, <hi>Apollo.</hi> He attempts <hi>Apollo</hi> too, retreats not till the God threatens him in his own Voice, and even then retreats but a few Steps. When he ſees <hi>Hector</hi> and <hi>Mars</hi> himſelf in open Arms againſt him, he had not retir'd tho' he was wounded, but in Obedience to <hi>Minerva,</hi> and then retires with his Face toward them. But as ſoon as ſhe permits him to engage with that God, he conquers, and ſends him groaning to Heaven. What Invention and what Conduct appears in this whole Epiſode? What Boldneſs in raiſing a Character to ſuch a Pitch, and what Judgment in raiſing it by ſuch De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees? While the moſt daring Flights of Poetry are employ'd to move our Admiration, and at the ſame time the juſteſt and cloſeſt Allegory, to reconcile thoſe Flights to moral Truth and Probability? It may be farther remark'd, that the high Degree to which <hi>Homer</hi> elevates this Character, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the principal Deſign of his whole Poem; which is to ſhew, that the greateſt Perſonal Qualities and Forces are of no Effect when Union is wanting among the chief Rulers, and that nothing can avail till they are reconciled ſo as to act in Concert.</p>

Among the reſt, <hi>Plutarch</hi> in the Life of <hi>Alexander</hi> deſcribes his Helmet much in this manner. This is enough to warrant the Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and were there no ſuch Example, the ſame Author ſays very well that the Imagination of a Poet is not to be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to ſtrict Phyſical Truths. But all Objections may eaſily be removed, if we conſider it as done by <hi>Minerva,</hi> who had determined this Day to raiſe <hi>Diomed</hi> above all the Heroes, and cauſed this Apparition to render him formidable. The Power of a God makes it not only allowable but highly no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and greatly imagined by <hi>Homer;</hi> as well as correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to a Miracle in holy Scripture, where <hi>Moſes</hi> is deſcribed with a Glory ſhining on his Face at his Deſcent from Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> a Parallel which <hi>Spondanus</hi> has taken notice of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Virgil</hi> was too ſenſible of the Beauty of this Paſſage not to imitate it, and it muſt be owned he has ſurpaſſed his Original.<q>

                     </q> In <hi>Homer</hi>'s Compariſon there is no other Circumſtance allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to but that of a remarkable Brightneſs: Whereas <hi>Virgil</hi>'s Compariſon, beſide this, ſeems to foretel the immenſe Slaughter his Hero was to make, by comparing him firſt to a Comet, which is vulgarly imagin'd a Prognoſtick, if not the real Cauſe of much Miſery to Mankind; and again to the Dog-ſtar, which appearing with the greateſt Brightneſs in the latter end of Summer, is ſuppos'd the Occaſion of all the Diſtempers of that ſickly Seaſon. And methinks the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection of <hi>Macrobius</hi> to this Place is not juſt, who thinks the Simile unſeaſonably apply'd by <hi>Virgil</hi> to <hi>Aeneas,</hi> becauſe he was yet on his Ship, and had not begun the Battel. One may anſwer, that this miraculous Appearance could never be
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:0356100102:74"/>
more proper than at the firſt Sight of the Hero, to ſtrike Terror into the Enemy, and to prognoſticate his approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Victory.</p>

                     <q rend="inline">VERSE 27. Idaeus <hi>fled, Left the rich Chariot.</hi>]</q> It is finely ſaid by M. <hi>Dacier,</hi> that <hi>Homer</hi> appears perhaps greater by the Criticiſms that have been paſt upon him, than by the Praiſes which have been given him. <hi>Zoilus</hi> had a Cavil at this Place; he thought it ridiculous in <hi>Idaeus</hi> to deſcend from his Chariot to fly, which he might have done faſter by the help of his Horſes. Three things are ſaid in anſwer to this; firſt, that <hi>Idaeus</hi> knowing the Paſſion which <hi>Diomed</hi> had for Horſes, might hope the Pleaſure of ſeizing theſe would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tard him from purſuing him. Next, that <hi>Homer</hi> might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to repreſent in this Action of <hi>Idaeus</hi> the common Effect of Fear, which diſturbs the Underſtanding to ſuch a degree, as to make Men abandon the ſureſt means to ſave themſelves. And then, that <hi>Idaeus</hi> might have ſome Advantage of <hi>Diomed</hi> in Swiftneſs, which he had reaſon to confide in. But I fancy one may add another Solution which will better account for this Paſſage. <hi>Homer</hi>'s word is <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

One may add, that his alighting from his Chariot was not that he could run faſter on foot, but that he could ſooner eſcape by mixing with the Crowd of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Soldiers. There is a Particular exactly of the ſame Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Book of <hi>Judges,</hi> Ch. 4. ℣. 15. where <hi>Siſera</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights to fly in the ſame manner.</p>

                  <p>It is obſervable thro' the whole Ilaid, that he endeavours every where to repreſent the <hi>Greeks</hi> as ſuperior to the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans</hi> in Valor and the Art of War. In the beginning of the third Book he deſcribes the <hi>Trojans</hi> ruſhing on to the Battel in a barbarous and confus'd manner, with loud Shouts and Cries, while the <hi>Greeks</hi> advance in the moſt profound Silence and exact Order. And in the latter Part of the fourth Book, where the two Armies march to the Engagement, the <hi>Greeks</hi> are animated by <hi>Pallas,</hi> while <hi>Mars</hi> inſtigates the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jans,</hi> the Poet attributing by this plain Allegory to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer a well-conducted Valor, to the latter raſh Strength and brutal Force: So that the Abilities of each Nation are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh'd by the Characters of the Deities who aſſiſt them.
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:0356100102:76"/>
But in this Place, as <hi>Euſtathius</hi> obſerves, the Poet being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to ſhew how much the <hi>Greeks</hi> excell'd their Enemies when they engag'd only with their proper Force, and when each ſide was alike deſtitute of divine Aſſiſtance, takes occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to remove the Gods out of the Battel, and then each <hi>Grecian</hi> Chief gives ſignal Inſtances of Valor ſuperior to the <hi>Trojans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A modern Critick obſerves that this conſtant Superiority of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the Art of War, Valor, and Number, is contradictory to the main Deſign of the Poem, which is to make the Return of <hi>Achilles</hi> appear neceſſary for the Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the <hi>Greeks;</hi> but this Contradiction vaniſhes when we reflect that the Affront given <hi>Achilles</hi> was the occaſion of <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s interpoſing in favour of the <hi>Trojans.</hi> Wherefore the Anger of <hi>Achilles</hi> was not pernicious to the <hi>Greeks</hi> purely becauſe it kept him inactive, but becauſe it occaſion'd <hi>Jupiter</hi> to afflict them in ſuch a manner, as made it neceſſary to appeaſe <hi>Achilles</hi> in order to render <hi>Jupiter</hi> propitious.</p>

This Lady was a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of the firſt Quality, and (as it appears in the ſixth Iliad) the high Prieſteſs of <hi>Minerva:</hi> So that one cannot imagine the Education of this Child was impoſed upon her by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority or Power of <hi>Antenor; Homer</hi> himſelf takes care to remove any ſuch derogatory Notion, by particularizing the Motive of this unuſual Piece of Humanity to have been to pleaſe her Husband, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF" extent="1 span">

                     </gap>. Nor ought we to leſſen this Commendation by thinking the Wives of thoſe Times in general were more complaiſant than thoſe of our own. The Stories of <hi>Phoenix, Clytemneſtra, Medea,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, are plain Inſtances how highly the keeping of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes was reſented by the married Ladies. But there was indeed a difference between the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Aſiaticks</hi> as to their Notions of Marriage: For it is certain the latter al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed Plurality of Wives; <hi>Priam</hi> had many lawful ones, and ſome of them Princeſſes who brought great Dowries. <hi>Theano</hi> was an <hi>Aſiatick,</hi> and that is the moſt we can grant; for the Son ſhe nurs'd ſo carefully was apparently not by a Wife, but by a Miſtreſs; and her Paſſions were naturally the ſame with thoſe of the <hi>Grecian</hi> Women. As to the Degree of Regard then ſhewn to the Baſtards, they were carefully enough educated, tho' not (like this of <hi>Ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi>) as the lawful Iſſue, nor admitted to an equal ſhare of Inheritance. <hi>Megapenthes</hi> and <hi>Nicoſtratus</hi> were excluded from the Inheritance of <hi>Sparta,</hi> becauſe they were born of Bond-Women,
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:0356100102:78"/>
as <hi>Pauſanias</hi> ſays. But <hi>Neoptolemus,</hi> a natural Son of <hi>Achilles</hi> by <hi>Deidamia,</hi> ſucceeded in his Father's Kingdom, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps with reſpect to his Mother's Quality who was a Princeſs. Upon the whole, however that Matter ſtood, <hi>Homer</hi> was very favourable to Baſtards, and has paid them more Complements than one in his Works. If I am not miſtaken <hi>Ulyſſes</hi> reckons himſelf one in the <hi>Odyſſeis. Agamemnon</hi> in the eighth Iliad plainly accounts it no Diſgrace, when charm'd with the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Exploits of young <hi>Teucer,</hi> and praiſing him in the Rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Heart, he juſt then takes occaſion to mention his Illegitimacy as a kind of Panegyrick upon him. The Reader may conſult the Paſſage, ℣. 284 of the Original and ℣. 333 of the Tranſlation. From all this I ſhould not be averſe to believe that <hi>Homer</hi> himſelf was a Baſtard, as <hi>Virgil</hi> was, of which I think this Obſervation a better Proof, than what is ſaid for it in the common <hi>Lives</hi> of him.</p>

This is the Language of Poetry, which prefers a marvellous Fiction to a plain and ſimple Truth, the Recital whereof would be cold and unaffecting.

It happens frequently in very calm Weather, that the Atmoſphere is charg'd with thick Vapors, whoſe Gravity is ſuch, that they neither riſe nor fall, but remain poiz'd in the Air at a certain Height, where they continue frequently for ſeveral Days together. In a plain Country this occaſions no other viſible Appearance, but of an uniform clouded Sky; but in a Hilly Region theſe Vapors are to be ſeen covering the Tops and ſtretch'd along the Sides of the Mountains, the clouded Parts above being terminated and diſtinguiſh'd from the clear Parts below by a ſtrait Line running parallel to the Horizon, as far as the Mountains extend.

Cloſeneſs of the Ranks; the Firmneſs, Order, and Silence of the whole, are all drawn with great Reſemblance in this one Compariſon.

ſome of the Commentators, who thought <hi>Homer</hi> deſign'd it as a Reproof of an undiſtinguiſh'd Generoſity. It is evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Panegyrick on that Virtue, and not improbably on the Memory of ſome excellent, but unfortunate Man in that Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, whom the Poet honours with the noble Title of <hi>A Friend to Mankind.</hi> It is indeed a ſevere Reproof of the Ingratitude of Men, and a kind of Satyr on human Race, while he repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents this Lover of his Species miſerably periſhing without Aſſiſtance from any of thoſe Numbers he had obliged. This Death is very moving, and the Circumſtance of a faithful Servant's dying by his ſide, well imagined, and natural to ſuch a Character. His manner of keeping Houſe near a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quented Highway, and relieving all Travellers, is agreeable to that ancient Hoſpitality which we now only read of. There is Abundance of this Spirit every where in the <hi>Odyſſeis.</hi> The Patriarchs in the Old Teſtament ſit at their Gates to ſee thoſe who paſs by, and entreat them to enter into their Houſes: This cordial manner of Invitation is particularly deſcribed in the 18<hi>th</hi> and 19<hi>th</hi> Chapters of <hi>Geneſis.</hi> The <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſeem to have had a peculiar Diſpoſition to theſe Exerciſes of Humanity, which continues in a great meaſure to this Day.

Since I am upon this Head, I muſt mention one or two extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Examples of ancient Hoſpitality. <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> writes of <hi>Gallias</hi> of <hi>Agrigentum,</hi> that having built ſeverall Inns for the Relief of Strangers, he appointed Perſons at the Gates to invite all who travell'd to make uſe of them; and that this Example was followed by many others who were inclined af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ancient manner to live in a human and beneficent Correſpondence with Mankind. That this <hi>Gallias</hi> entertain'd and cloathed at one time no leſs than five hundred Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; and that there were in his Cellars three hundred Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, each of which contain'd an hundred Hogſheads of Wine.

Helenus</hi> was a Prieſt and Augur of the higheſt Rank, he enjoins it as a Point of Religion, and <hi>Hector</hi> obeys him as one inſpired from Heaven. The <hi>Trojan</hi> Army was in the utmoſt Diſtreſs, occaſion'd by the prodigious Slaughter made by <hi>Diomed:</hi> There was therefore more Reaſon and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to propitiate <hi>Minerva</hi> who aſſiſted that Hero; which <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenus</hi> might know, tho' <hi>Hector</hi> would have choſen to have ſtay'd and truſted to the Arm of Fleſh.

As to <hi>Helenus</hi> his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:0356100102:157"/>
Part, he ſaw the Straits his Countrymen were reduced to, he knew his Authority as a Prieſt, and deſign'd to revive the Courage of the Troops by a Promiſe of divine Aſſiſtance. Nothing adds more Courage to the Minds of Men than Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and perhaps it was the only Expedient then left; much like a modern Practice in the Army, to enjoin a <hi>Faſt</hi> when they wanted Proviſion. <hi>Helenus</hi> could no way have made his Promiſe more credible, than by ſending a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way <hi>Hector;</hi> which look'd like an Aſſurance that nothing could prejudice them during his Abſence on ſuch a religious Account. No Leader of leſs Authority than <hi>Hector</hi> could ſo properly have enjoin'd this ſolemn Act of Religion; and laſtly, no other whoſe Valour was leſs known than his, could have left the Army in this Juncture without a Taint upon his Honour. <hi>Homer</hi> makes this Piety ſucceed; <hi>Paris</hi> is brought back to the Fight, the <hi>Trojans</hi> afterwards prevail, and <hi>Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> appears openly in their favour, <hi>l.</hi> 8.

Monſieur <hi>Dacier</hi>'s Anſwer in Defence of <hi>Homer</hi> is ſo full, that I cannot do better than to tranſlate it from his Remarks on the 26<hi>th</hi> Chapter of <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>'s <hi>Poetic.</hi> There can be nothing more unjuſt than the Criticiſms paſt upon things that are the Effect of Cuſtom. It was uſual in ancient Times for Soldiers to talk together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they encounter'd. <hi>Homer</hi> is full of Examples of this ſort, and he very well deſerves we ſhould be ſo juſt as to believe, he had never done it ſo often, but that it was agreeable to the Manners of his Age. But this is not only a thing of Cuſtom, but founded in Reaſon itſelf. The Ties of Hoſpitality in thoſe Times were held more ſacred than thoſe of Blood; and it is on that Account <hi>Diomed</hi> gives ſo long an Audience to <hi>Glaucus,</hi> whom he acknowledges to be his Gueſt, with whom it was not lawful to engage in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate. <hi>Homer</hi> makes an admirable Uſe of this Conjuncture, to introduce an entertaining Hiſtory after ſo many Battels as he has been deſcribing, and to unbend the Mind of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der by a Recital of ſo much Variety as the Story of the Family of <hi>Siſyphus.</hi> It may be farther obſerv'd, with what
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:0356100102:159"/>
Addreſs and Management he places this long Converſation; it is not during the Heat of an obſtinate Battel, which had been too unſeaſonable to be excuſed by any Cuſtom what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; but he brings it in after he has made <hi>Hector</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire into <hi>Troy,</hi> when the Abſence of ſo powerful an Enemy had given <hi>Diomed</hi> that Leiſure which he could not have had otherwiſe. One need only read the judicious Remark of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtathius</hi> upon this Place. <hi>The Poet</hi> (ſays he) <hi>after having caus'd</hi> Hector <hi>to go out of the Fight, interrupts the Violence of Wars, and gives ſome Relaxation to the Reader, in cauſing him to paſs from the Confuſion and Diſorder of the Action to the Tranquillity and Security of an Hiſtorical Narration. For by means of the happy Epiſode of</hi> Glaucus, <hi>he caſts a thouſand pleaſing Wonders into his Poem; as Fables, that include beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Allegories, Hiſtories, Genealogies, Sentences, ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, and ſeveral other Graces that tend to the diverſifying of his Work, and which by breaking (as one may ſay) the Mono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomy of it, agreeably inſtruct the Reader.</hi> Let us obſerve, in how fine a manner <hi>Homer</hi> has hereby praiſed both <hi>Diomed</hi> and <hi>Hector.</hi> For he makes us know, that as long as <hi>Hector</hi> is in the Field, the <hi>Greeks</hi> have not the leaſt Leiſure to take breath; and that as ſoon as he quits it, all the <hi>Trojans,</hi> how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they had regain'd all their Advantages, were not able to employ <hi>Diomed</hi> ſo far as to prevent his entertaining him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with <hi>Glaucus</hi> without any danger to his Party. Some may think after all, that tho' we may juſtify <hi>Homer,</hi> we cannot excuſe the Manners of his Time; it not being natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for Men with Swords in their Hands to dialogue together in cold Blood juſt before they engage. But not to alledge, that theſe very Manners yet remain in thoſe Countries, which have not been corrupted by the Commerce of other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, (which is a great Sign of their being natural) what Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon can be offer'd that it is more natural to fall on at firſt Sight with Rage and Fierceneſs, than to ſpeak to an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy before the Encounter? Thus far Monſieur <hi>Dacier,</hi> and St. <hi>Evremont</hi> asks humourouſly, if it might not be as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in that Country for Men to harangue before they fought, as it is in <hi>England</hi> to make Speeches before they are hanged.</p>

That <hi>Homer</hi> is not in general apt to make unſeaſonable Harangues (as theſe Cenſurers would repreſent) may appear from that remarkable Care he has ſhewn in many Places to avoid them: As when in the fifth Book <hi>Aeneas</hi> being cured on a ſudden in the middle of the Fight, is ſeen with Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize by his Soldiers; he ſpecifies with particular Caution, that they <hi>asked him no Queſtions how he became cured,</hi> in a time of ſo much Buſineſs and Action.

                  <p>The Diſcourſe of <hi>Glaucus</hi> to <hi>Diomed</hi> is ſeverely cenſured, not only on Account of the Circumſtance of Time and Place, but likewiſe on the Score of the Subject, which is taxed as improper, and foreign to the End and Deſign of the Poem. But the Criticks who have made this Objection, ſeem neither to comprehend the Deſign of the Poet in general, nor the particular Aim of this Diſcourſe. Many Paſſages in the beſt ancient Poets appear unaffecting at preſent, which probably gave the greateſt Delight to their firſt Readers, becauſe they were nearly intereſted in what was there related. It is very plain that <hi>Homer</hi> deſigned this Poem as a Monument to the Honour of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> who, tho' conſiſting of ſeveral inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent Societies, were yet very national in Point of Glory, being ſtrongly affected with every thing that ſeem'd to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance the Honour of their common Country, and reſentful of any Indignity offer'd to it. This Diſpoſition was the Ground of that grand Alliance which is the Subject of this Poem. To Men ſo fond of their Country's Glory, what could be more agreeable than to read a Hiſtory fill'd with Wonders of a noble Family tranſplanted from <hi>Greece</hi> into <hi>Aſia?</hi> They might here learn with Pleaſure that the <hi>Grecian</hi> Virtues did not degenerate by removing into diſtant Climes: but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they muſt be affected with uncommon Delight to find that

The Devil was in <hi>Hector,</hi> if he knew not all this Matter, as well as ſhe who told it him; for ſhe had been his Bedfellow for many Years together: and if he knew it, then it muſt be confeſs'd, that <hi>Homer</hi> in this long Digreſſion, has rather given us his own Character, than that of the fair Lady whom he paints. His dear Friends the Commentators, who never fail him at a Pinch, will needs excuſe him, by making the preſent Sorrow of <hi>Andromache,</hi> to occaſion the Remembrance of all the paſt: But others think that ſhe had enough to do with that Grief which now oppreſs'd her, without running for Aſſiſtance to her Family."</q> But may not it be anſwer'd, that nothing was more natural in <hi>Andromache,</hi> than to recollect her paſt Calamities in order to repreſent her preſent Diſtreſs to <hi>Hector</hi> in a ſtronger Light, and ſhew her utter Deſertion if he ſhould periſh. What could more effectually work upon a generous and tender Mind like that of <hi>Hector?</hi> What could therefore be more proper to each of their Characters?

                     <hi>HOMER,</hi> like moſt of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> is thought to have travell'd into <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and brought from the Prieſts there not only their Learning, but their manner of conveying it in Fables and Hiero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glyphicks. This is neceſſary to be conſider'd by thoſe who would thoroughly penetrate into the Beauty and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of many Parts of this Author. For whoever reflects that this was the Mode of Learning in thoſe Times, will make no doubt but there are ſeveral Myſteries both of Natural and Moral Philoſophy involv'd in his Ficti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which otherwiſe in the literal Meaning appear too tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vial or irrational; and it is but juſt, when theſe are not plain or immediately intelligible, to imagine that ſomething of this kind may be hid under them. Nevertheleſs, as <hi>Homer</hi> tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell'd not with a direct View of writing Philoſophy or Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy, ſo he might often uſe theſe Hieroglyphical Fables and Traditions as Embelliſhments of his Poetry only, without taking the Pains to open their myſtical Meaning to his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and perhaps without diving very deeply into it himſelf.</p>

to the Nature of the Sovereign Being, as repreſenting him variable or inconſtant in his Rewards and Puniſhments.

                  <p>Her Behaviour in this Place is very natural to a Perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a Diſappointment: She had ſet her Heart upon preferring the <hi>Greeks,</hi> but failing in that Point, ſhe aſſumes an Air of Indifference, and ſays, whether they live or die, ſhe is uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd.</p>

                  <p>

                     <hi>Minerva</hi> to <hi>Jupiter</hi> near the beginning of this Book. What is there utter'd by Wiſdom herſelf, and approv'd by him, is here ſpoken by a Goddeſs who (as <hi>Homer</hi> tells us at this very time) imprudently manifeſted her Paſſion, and whom <hi>Jupiter</hi> anſwers with Anger. To deal fairly, I cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend this in my Author, any more than ſome other of his Repetitions; as when <hi>Ajax</hi> in the fifteenth Iliad, ℣. 561. uſes the ſame Speech word for word to encourage the <hi>Greeks,</hi> which <hi>Agamemnon</hi> had made in the fifth, ℣. 529. I think it equally an Extreme, to vindicate all the Repetitions of <hi>Homer,</hi> and to excuſe none. However <hi>Euſtathius</hi> very ingeniouſly excuſes this, by ſaying that the ſame Speeches become entirely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent by the different manner of introducing them. <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerva</hi> addreſs'd herſelf to <hi>Jupiter</hi> with Words full of Reſpect, but <hi>Juno</hi> with Terms of Reſentment. This, ſays he, ſhews the Effect of opening our Speeches with Art: It prejudices the Audience in our favour, and makes us ſpeak to Friends: whereas the Auditor naturally denies that Favour, which the Orator does not ſeem to ask; ſo that what he delivers, tho' it has equal Merit, labours under this Diſadvantage, that his Judges are his Enemies.</p>

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:0356100102:300"/>
ancient word, which cauſes the many various Conſtructions of it. So that it is probable the Author's own Words, at the time he uſed them, never meant half ſo many things as we tranſlate them into. Madam <hi>Dacier</hi> generally obſerves one Practice as to theſe throughout her Verſion: She ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders almoſt every ſuch Epithet in <hi>Greek</hi> by two or three in <hi>French,</hi> from a fear of loſing the leaſt part of its Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cance. This perhaps may be excuſable in Proſe; tho' at beſt it makes the whole much more verboſe and tedious, and is rather like writing a Dictionary than rendring an Author: But in Verſe, every Reader knows ſuch a Redoubling of Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets would not be tolerable. A Poet has therefore only to chuſe that, which moſt agrees with the Tenor and main In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the particular Paſſage, or with the Genius of Poetry itſelf.</p>
                  <p>It is plain that too ſcrupulous an Adherence to many of theſe, gives the Tranſlation an exotic, pedantic, and whimſical Air, which it is not to be imagined the Original ever had. To call a Hero the <hi>great Artificer of Flight,</hi> the <hi>ſwift of Foot,</hi> or the <hi>Horſe-tamer,</hi> theſe give us Ideas of little Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities, when in the Author's Time they were Epithets uſed only in general to ſignify Alacrity, Agility, and Vigor. A common Reader would imagine from theſe ſervile Verſions, that <hi>Diomed</hi> and <hi>Achilles</hi> were Foot-Racers, and <hi>Hector</hi> a Horſe-Courſer, rather than that any of them were Heroes.
